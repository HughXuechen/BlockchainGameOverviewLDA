Abstract. Delegated blockchain governance is the frontier of blockchain design issues that is to improve
the scalability of blockchain networks. Delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains such as EOS must
select a few super nodes for transaction verification. In particular, the blockchain community has debated
recently on whether dividend should be allowed when electing super nodes, which might be considered
as unethical or unfair, leading to an open research topic and a new research gap that has theoretical value
for both academia and industry. In this paper, we build a theoretical framework to study how dividend
affects user decisions and welfare in a DPoS blockchain. Based on game theory, we propose a three-player
Hotelling model with two policies to study the behaviors of voters and candidates. We first use a static
game analysis to show that the benefits of dividend for voters and for candidates vary with the size of
reward and there exists an interval, in which the zero dividend policy would be good for the welfare of
both candidates and voters. Then, we use an evolutionary game analysis to examine the process dynamics
of super node selection, we find that the campaign strategy of candidates has to do with the size of platform
reward given to the candidates by the blockchain platform. Especially in the asymmetric case, we find
that higher level of platform reward turns to benefit candidates with large number of votes even more.
Our findings are instrumental for designing dividend policies in DPoS blockchains and can stimulate more
potential research in blockchain governance.

1. Introduction
Blockchain, the technology that underpins Bit-
coin and other virtual currencies, is an open,
distributed ledger that can record transactions
in an immutable way (Marco 2017). It is
believed that the blockchain technology may
revolutionize the digital economy because it
can create trust between people and reduce
transaction cost (Biodun 2015). However, re-
searchers point out that numerous technolog-
ical challenges have not been solved by exist-
ing blockchain technologies(Yli-huumo 2016).
According to Swans summary (Swan 2015),
technological challenges include throughput,
latency, wasted resources (Weber 2017) and so
on (Mougayar 2016).
Decentralized nodes in a blockchain need
to maintain consistent records that are
achieved by consensus algorithms (Lamport et
al. 1982). The representative of consensus
algorithms are proof of work (PoW), proof of
stake (PoS), delegated proof of stake (DPoS)
and so on. PoW, the consensus algorithm
adopted by the Bitcoin blockchain, has been
criticized for its limitations in throughput and
latency. Furthermore, hardware competition
among miners becomes increasingly fierce and
leads to wasteful computation and energy re-
sources (Weber 2017). PoS was developed to
solve the problem of wasteful resource con-

sumption by introducing coin age instead of
computing power to the block mining process.
It was first used in PPCoin blockchain (King
and Nadal 2012) and improved by Ethereum
blockchain (Buterin and Griffith 2017). Al-
though PoS shortens the time to reach consen-
sus and it is more friendly to new nodes, it has
not resolved the fundamental problems. First,
PoS is not applicable in most business environ-
ments, because its throughput is still far from
what is required by businesses. Second, simi-
lar to PoW, PoS also cannot avoid "the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer" phenomenon,
which is harmful for the long-term sustainabil-
ity of blockchain systems.
Delegated proof of stake (DPoS), which is
a consensus algorithm proposed by Daniel
Larimer in 2013 (Larimer 2014) is believed
to solve most of the technical challenges men-
tioned above such as throughput, latency, and
wasted resources. Furthermore, DPoS signif-
icantly improves performance of blockchain
systems while retaining a certain degree of
decentralization (Gencer et al. 2018, Li and
Palanisamy 2020). This feature is very help-
ful for large-scale applications of blockchain
technology. In EOS (Enterprise Operation Sys-
tem), one of the most famous public blockchain
systems that utilize the DPoS consensus algo-
rithm, 21 super nodes are selected by voters
who hold tokens. A relatively high degree of
decentralization is retained in such a system.
The super nodes are in charge of block produc-
tion and community construction and will be
rewarded for their effort and service.
As a global platform, the EOS blockchain
draws participants from all over the world who
hold various viewpoints on super node selec-
tion. Some super nodes (mostly from China)
suggest that they will share the rewards ob-
tained from platform with voters. For exam-
ple, Huobi, one of the oldest and largest cryp-
tocurrency exchanges and most powerful can-
didates in China, has been reported to share
rewards with its voters in EOS (Solomon 2018).
Some other candidates and voters (mostly from
Northern America and Europe) call the maxi-
mum dividend strategy as vote buying which
is intolerable and should be strictly banned.
For example, Kevin Rose, the community man-
ager of EOS New York, thinks that vote trad-
ing and reward sharing would damage an or-
ganizations independence. This is called an-
other frontier of US-China geopolitical eco-
nomic warfare by Ethereum founder Vitalik
Buterin (Brady 2018). Some voters even claim
that they would never vote for any China-
based candidates. There are also other users
(e.g., users from South Korean) who are neu-
tral about reward sharing. Certainly, according
to the EOS interim constitution, Article IV - No
Vote Buying: "No Member shall offer nor ac-
cept anything of value in exchange for a vote
of any type, nor shall any Member unduly in-
fluence the vote of another", vote buying is
banned. But it has never been ratified by users
(Solomon 2018). Furthermore, the EOS plat-
form neither confirmed nor denied the divi-
dend behavior (O’NEAL 2018).
As a main feature of the DPoS consensus
algorithm, super node selection is the key com-
ponent of EOS blockchain governance. Su-
per nodes are responsible for daily operations
of a blockchain network and obtain tokens as
their rewards. Super nodes have a significant
impact on blockchain governance. Therefore,
dividend policy that affects the results of su-
per node selection is a critical component of
blockchain governance. Specifically, there are
two alternative policies: 1) the zero dividend
policy that prohibits any form of vote buying;
2) the maximum dividend policy that allows
any amount of reward sharing. Users holding
different viewpoints on super node selection
support for the two opposite policies. Candi-
dates have two strategies: share reward or not.
Consequently, we ask the following research
questions: What is the difference between two
290 Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis
policies? How would the two opposite poli-
cies affect voters’ and candidates’ profits and
social welfare? How would candidates behav-
ior evolve when reward sharing is allowed?
Building on game theory, we analyze the bene-
fit and welfare of the two voting policies. In the
model, candidates compete for as many votes
as possible to get elected. All candidates first
determine their campaign strategies and then
set dividend sizes, finally voters vote according
to their utilities.
We find that, allowing dividend is not al-
ways bad for voters and good for candidates,
which is contrary to our intuition. The plat-
form could set appropriate size of reward in or-
der to lead voters and candidates to follow the
rules. In addition, the maximum dividend pol-
icy would lessen social welfare, and there exists
a particular range of reward that can make the
zero dividend policy better for both voter and
candidate welfare. Furthermore, we extend
the three-player Hotelling model to examine
the process of evolution. We find that all the
candidates would choose the maximum div-
idend strategy when the reward size is small
enough. When the reward is in a certain range,
the two strategies can be used by candidates
simultaneously. When the reward size is big
enough, if the competing super nodes candi-
dates are in a close game, they will still choose
the maximum dividend strategy. Otherwise,
high reward only benefits the candidates with
more votes.
The rest of the paper will be organized as
follows. The related literature is discussed in
Section 2. Then, we present the setup for the
three-player Hotelling model and equilibrium
results in zero and maximum dividend policies
in Section 3. In Section 4, we compare the two
policies and derive the conditions under which
the two policies are good for voter, candidate
and social welfare respectively. Dynamic anal-
ysis based on evolutionary game and its nu-
merical simulation are presented in Section 5.
We conclude this paper with findings and fu-
ture work in Section 6.
2. Literature Review
Blockchain as a distributed database technol-
ogy has a wide range of application on cryp-
tocurrencies such as Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008).
Furthermore, blockchain has been adopted in a
variety of domains to enable the operation and
management of new business processes (Nofer
et al. 2017, Staples et al. 2017). Blockchain
can be classified into three types: public, pri-
vate and consortium blockchains. Nodes right
of using and maintaining the blockchain net-
work differs among different types. In public
blockchains, which are also called permission-
less blockchains, any node can join the network
freely. Comparatively, in private or consor-
tium blockchains, which are also called per-
missioned blockchains, nodes need to be au-
thorized (Dinh et al. 2017, Wang 2019). In this
paper, we focus on a special public blockchain
named EOS.
EOS allows anyone who wants to use the
blockchain application to join the blockchain
network. Both the data and software are open
source. Although a blockchain is "owned by
no-one", it is not "governed by no-one" (How-
ell et al. 2019). Because of self-organizing, the
capabilities of blockchain and heterogeneous
objectives would lead to new patterns of or-
ganizing and to the pursuit of new objectives
(Andersen and Bogusz 2019). As a blockchain-
based organization, the EOS community can
be seen as a "decentralized autonomous orga-
nization" (DAO) (Weill 2004, Beck et al. 2018)
which needs new IT governance (Brown and
Grant 2005). IT governance has three key di-
mensions: decision rights, accountability and
incentives (Weill 2004). Decision right con-
sists of decision management right and deci-
sion control right (Fama and Jensen 1983). Ac-
cording to the DPoS consensus utilized in EOS
blockchain, selected super nodes are granted
Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis 291
part of decision right by ceding from token
holders. Then the token holders have the de-
cision control right and super nodes hold the
decision management right. This paper adds
insights on the allocation of decision right of
IT governance.
Blockchain makes it possible for strangers
to transact with one another on the Internet by
using a combination of consensus algorithm,
cryptography and P2P network. The con-
sensus algorithm has been considered as the
bottleneck of blockchain system performance
(Bonneau et al. 2015). According to the clas-
sification in (Bonneau et al. 2015), there are
four types of consensus algorithms: 1) classi-
cal consensus, such as Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (PBFT) (Castro and Liskov 1999), 2)
proof-of-work (PoW) (Dwork and Naor 1993,
Gervais et al. 2016), 3) proof-of-X (PoX), in-
cluding proof-of-stake (Bentov et al. 2016,
David et al. 2018), Proof-of-Capacity and
Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (Park 2018), 4) hybrid
consensus including single committee (Decker
et al. 2016, Cachin 2016) and multiple com-
mittees (Syta 2017, Danezis and Meiklejohn
2015). Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) be-
longs to hybrid consensus algorithms. It is
believed that DPoS can solve most of the tech-
nological challenges, such as throughput, la-
tency and wasted resources. So far, DPoS has
been used in several major blockchains such as
Steem, Tron and EOS (Jeong 2020). This paper
contributes to the consensus mechanism litera-
ture by proposing a game theoretical model to
analyze decisions of participants in the DPoS
consensus process.
Under the rules of DPoS consensus, token
holders have to vote for candidates. Naturally,
conflict among different organizations would
emerge (Rosemann and Brocke 2015). Conflict
is expressed both on policy design and strategy
selection. A decentralized blockchain can be
used for cross-culture and cross-organizational
cooperation (Lin 2014). Huntington (2000)
argued that future wars would be fought not
between countries, but between cultures. This
paper contributes to the cooperation mecha-
nism design in DPoS blockchains. Vitalik the
co-founder and inventor of Ethereum claims
that DPoS results in rule by plutocracy (Pierson
2017). However, Daniel the co-founder of EOS
thinks that PoW and PoS will result in ruling by
plutocracy as we can see the hard forks of Bit-
coin happened in 2017, while DPoS would cre-
ate competition which is the foundation of true
decentralization. The findings from the game
theoretical analysis in this paper contributes to
the research of voter and candidate welfare in
DPoS blockchain systems.
3. The Base Model and Static Analysis
3.1 Model Setup
In this section, we use the improved Hotelling
setup (Hotelling 1990) to study behaviors of
voters and candidates in a DPoS blockchain.
The standard Hotelling model consists of two
players while our improved model (hereafter
called the three-player Hotelling model) con-
sists three players (i.e. three groups of can-
didates). We classify candidates into three
competing groups in our model and regard
candidates from the same group as a whole.
We use c to indicate the group of candidates
who favors reward sharing, a to indicate the
group of candidates who oppose reward shar-
ing, and k to indicate the group of candidates
who are neutral about reward sharing. The
three groups of candidates compete for votes
to win the super node selection. As the repre-
sentatives of two absolutely different views on
reward sharing, candidates c and a are situated
on the points 0 and 1 respectively. We assume
the k group of candidates locate on the point l
between 0.5 and 1, which means that the main-
stream viewpoint of the whole community is
close to the candidates in group a.
In this paper, zero and maximum dividend
policies are antipodal. EOS is a global public

blockchain system. When number of users is
large enough, distribution of users will tend to
uniform very closely. Therefore, without loss
of generality, we assume that the continuous
voters are uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 on
a line segment of length 1 as shown in Figure 1.
Number of voters at any point of the line seg-
ment is the same. Voter utility for each group
of candidates is the value a voter derives from
the candidate group net the disutility from the
mismatch between the candidate group and
the voter. The mismatch is measured by the
psychological distance which is equal to the
distance between the candidates and voters lo-
cations on the line (Adner et al. 2019).
3.2 Zero Dividend Policy
For group i ∈ {c , k , a}, we denote that the util-
ity obtained by a voter is ui . Under the zero
dividend policy, any form of vote buying is
banned. Therefore, the utilities for voters lo-
cating at x1 ∈ (0, l) and x2 ∈ (l , 1) derived from
different candidates is the difference between
voters preference and mismatch cost. They can
be formulated as⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
uc � σ − τx2
1
uk1 � σ − τ (l − x1)2
ua � σ − τ (1 − x2)2
uk2 � σ − τ (x2 − l)2
uc denotes the utility that a voter in (0, l) ob-
tains from voting for candidates in group c, uk1
and uk2 denote the utilities that voters in (0, l)
and (l , 1) obtain from voting for candidates in
group k respectively, ua denotes the utility that
a voter in (l , 1) obtains from voting for can-
didates in group a. σ is the utility derived
from the right candidate that complies with the
voter’s preference completely. τ denotes the
unit mismatch cost. In other word, it measures
the unit difference between candidates and vot-
ers viewpoint preference. Opposite to the pref-
erence of financial wealth, τ means the prefer-
ence of a voters subjective or abstract value,
which can be affected by many factors. For ex-
ample, pressure of public opinion and moral
may increase τ. The expression of vote buying
morally denies the maximum dividend policy.
If this expression dominates public opinions,
voter preference would be affected. It can in-
crease the importance of subjective value and
decrease the importance of reward sharing to
voters. Candidate reputation may also affect τ.
Because famous people or famous companies
(e.g., founders) in the blockchain industry have
more influence which can affect voter prefer-
ence in super node selection. Similarly, trust in
the project may affect τ. For voters who hold
low level of trust in the blockchain system, they
tend to prefer more reward sharing rather than
candidate reputation.
Voters vote for the candidates that offers the
most utility. By letting uc � uk1 and ua � uk2,
we can get the indifferent voters’ locations as

from x∗

to x∗
2
choose to vote for k group of
candidates, and from x∗

to 1 would choose to
vote for a group of candidates.
Let I denote the reward that the elected
super nodes would obtain and Di denote the
number of voters who vote for candidates i.
The more votes the group of candidates get,
the more reward the group of candidates will
Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis 293
obtain. Therefore, the groups profit function
is the product of I and Di as follows:
πi � IDi
When x∗

and x∗

are substituted into the
above equation, we can get different profits for
different candidate groups as
π∗c �

I(1 − l)
Based on the above results, we observe that
the profit of candidates in group c increases
as the distance between candidates in groups
c and k increases. Note that the profit that
candidates in group k would get is always 0.5I,
which is irrelevant to their location l.
3.3 Maximum Dividend Policy
Under the maximum dividend policy, any
amount of reward sharing is allowed. We as-
sume the reward that candidates from groups
c, k and a would share is Pc , Pk and Pa respec-
tively. Then the reward sharing will be fac-
tored into the process of voters decision mak-
ing. Then the utilities for voters are⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩

We can derive the indifferent voters locations
by letting uc � uk1 and ua � uk2, as⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩

In addition, the profit functions of the candi-
dates in different groups can be formulated as
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
πc � (I − Pc)x̃1
πk � (I − Pk) (x̃2 − x̃1)
πa � (I − Pa) (1 − x̃2)
By solving the first order conditions for the
three profit-maximizing groups of candidates,
we can derive the equilibrium reward sharing,
profits, and indifferent consumer, as summa-
rized by the following lemma. All proofs of
lemmas and propositions hereinafter are in-
cluded in the appendix section.
Lemma 1 When candidates are allowed to share
reward with voters, the equilibrium reward sharing
are ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩

As we can see, when l increases, the profit
of candidates c would also increase, but profits
of candidates k and a would decline. No matter
for self-interest or alliance interest, candidates
k have to approach to be neutral. Secondly,
πi , i ∈ {c , k , a}, are positively correlated with
τ, instead of I. This demonstrates that, in this
case, profits of candidates increase as the pref-
erence of voters increases. Consequently, the
candidates tend to lobby the voters in order to
change their viewpoint preference.
4. Policy Comparison
In this section, we would compare the equilib-
riums in two policies and get the conditions
under which the candidates will support for
one policy. We define the candidate welfare
as the sum of all candidates profits, the voter
welfare as the sum of all voters utilities and the
social welfare as the sum of candidate welfare
and voter welfare. Therefore, by comparing
candidate welfare and voter welfare in two op-
posite policies, we can get the following propo-
sitions. Hereinafter we use r to substitute I
τ
which means the relative reward value to mis-
match cost. In the rest of this paper, we find
294 Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis
that the relative reward r is very significant to
all the results we obtain.
As mentioned in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, candi-
date equilibrium profits increase as I increases
under the zero dividend policy or τ increases
under the maximum dividend policy. This
is because the zero dividend policy makes
candidates hold platform reward all to them-
selves while the maximum dividend policy in-
tensifies competition among candidates which
makes them sensitive to voters viewpoint pref-
erence. Therefore, when the relative reward
r is high enough, the zero dividend policy is
better for candidates, and when the relative
reward r is below a certain threshold, the max-
imum dividend policy is better for candidates.
In other words, the relative reward r deter-
mines which policy is better for candidates, as
formalized in the following proposition.
Figure 2 Optimal Policy for Candidates
Proposition 1 (Candidate Welfare) As shown in
Figure 2, the optimal policy for candidates as a whole
is
1) zero dividend policy, if r > 1+4l−4l2
8 ;
2) maximum dividend policy, if r < 1+4l−4l2
8 .
In contrast, when the relative reward r is
high enough, voters benefit more from the
maximum dividend policy than the loss of
mismatch cost. Thus, we have the following
proposition.
Figure 3 Optimal Policy for Voters
Proposition 2 (Voter Welfare) As shown in Figure
3, the optimal policy for voters as a whole is
1) zero dividend policy, if r < (1+2l)(3−2l)
16 ;
2) maximum dividend policy, if r > (1+2l)(3−2l)
16 .
Figure 4 Comparative Analysis
According to Propositions 1 and 2, we find
that neither policy is always good or bad,
which is contrary to popular believes. By com-
paring the above propositions, we can see that
there exists an interval, in which the zero div-
idend policy would be good for both the vot-
ers and candidates. This is because it is high
enough for candidates to give up competition
and small enough for voters to give up benefit
from dividend. The dark region in Figure 4
represents the superiority interval of zero div-
idend policy.
Proposition 3 As shown in Figure 4, zero div-
idend policy could be the best choice for both the
voters and candidates only when 1+4l−4l2
8 < r <
(1+2l)(3−2l)
16 .
Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis 295
Figure 5 Changes in Voting for Each Group of Candidates
Figure 5 indicates how voters choose candi-
dates under the two opposite policies: those on
[x̃1 , x∗1] choose the c group of candidates under
zero dividend policy, but switch to the k group
of candidates under maximum dividend pol-
icy; and those on [x̃2 , x∗2] choose the k group
of candidates under the zero dividend policy,
but switch to the a group of candidates un-
der maximum dividend policy. Hence, social
welfare is lower under the maximum dividend
policy compared to the zero dividend policy
because of inefficient voter switching. How-
ever, the interval of switching voters tends to
be 0 as l tends to be 0.5, which indicates that
the loss of social welfare tends to be 0.
Proposition 4 (Social Welfare)
1) Compared to the zero dividend policy, the max-
imum dividend policy would lessen the social wel-
fare;
2) The gap of social welfare between two policies
approaches to disappearing as l tends to be 0.5.
As demonstrated in proposition 4, maxi-
mum dividend policy indeed would lessen the
social welfare.
5. Dynamic Analysis
In order to deepen our understanding of this
game, we set up two extensions, symmetric
and asymmetric evolutionary models. The
evolutionary game is used in the dynamic anal-
ysis for two reasons. First, its assumption of
bounded rationality suits the reality better (Si-
mon 1997). Second, the dividend policy is
regarded as an endogenous choice that candi-
dates can make freely and this is more in line
with the actual situation.
In the symmetric evolutionary model, there
is no difference between the two players. As
the payoff matrix shows in Table 1, the two
players obtain the same payoff when they
choose the same strategy, and their payoffs are
symmetric when they choose different strate-
gies. In Section 5.1, we show the symmet-
ric game which is a simplified case, but it is
suitable to delineate the competition in a sin-
gle group or between two groups of players
with the same viewpoints. The asymmetric
model includes two different players because
two players case can represent the principles
inside well enough, and avoid the problem
that three or more players case can hardly be
solved mathematically. As shown in Table 2,
the two players payoffs are not symmetric in
any case. The asymmetric evolutionary model
will be used to characterize the competition be-
tween two different groups of players in Sec-
tion 5.2, as is found in the EOS blockchain sys-
tem. Furthermore, analyzing these extensions
also establishes the robustness of our results
on strategy choices and welfare comparison.
5.1 Symmetric Evolutionary Game Analy-
sis
First, we consider the symmetric case, in which
two groups of candidates (A and B) compete
for votes to win the super node selection. The
other assumptions are the same as the base
model. Compared to the zero dividend strat-
egy, the maximum dividend strategy can help
candidates win more votes under the same
condition. We can obtain the results in the
following proposition.
Proposition 5 In the symmetric game,
1) when groups A and B both choose the zero
dividend strategy, the indifferent consumer is at

x∗ � 0.5, and the equilibrium profits are πA �
πB � 0.5I;
2) when groups A and B both choose the maxi-
mum dividend strategy, the indifferent consumer
is at x∗ � 0.5, the equilibrium bonus sharing are
PA � PB � I − τ, and the equilibrium profits are
πA � πB � 0.5τ;
3) when group A choose the maximum dividend
strategy and group B choose the zero dividend strat-
egy, the indifferent consumer is at x∗ �

equilibrium bonus sharing is PA �
I−τ
2 , and the
equilibrium profits are πA �

4τ , and vice versa.
Then, we can obtain the payoff matrix of
symmetric game as shown in Table 1. Accord-
ing to the payoff matrix, we can obtain results
about ESS (evolutionary stable strategy) by the
means of replicator dynamics as follows:
Proposition 6 In the symmetric game, the ESS is
1) θ∗ � 1, when r < 1 or r > 2;
2) θ∗ � r−1
3−r , when 1 < r < 2.
θ denotes the participation of choosing the
maximum dividend strategy. This proposition
demonstrates that, in symmetric case, the cam-
paign strategy of candidates is only related to
the size of relative reward in the long term. To
be specific, when platform reward is large or
small enough, all the candidates would choose
maximum dividend strategy. When platform
reward is in a particular range, the mixed strat-
egy would be chosen by candidates. That is
to say that candidates would not choose max-
imum dividend strategy for certain, even its
not banned. This also explains and further
validates the result in Proposition 1 that both
the zero dividend policy and the maximum
dividend policy could be better for candidates
under certain conditions.
In addition, this symmetric evolutionary
game can be understood in two ways. First,
it can be used to describe the situation that two
opposite organizations of similar sizes. Sec-
ond, A and B can be seen as any two single per-
sons. Then proposition 6 represents the evolu-
tionary results of maximum dividend strategy
in a single organization.
5.2 Asymmetric Evolutionary Game Anal-
ysis
In practice, the two rival organizations are al-
ways unequal. For example, the power of can-
didates who favors reward sharing is not equal
to the power of candidates who oppose reward
sharing. Subsequently, we make an asymmet-
ric analysis about the evolutionary process that
are suitable for wider range of applications. In
this section, we denote A as the group of can-
didates c, and B as the group of candidates k
and a.
The conditions that all the candidates
choose the zero/maximum dividend strategy
have been discussed in section 2. Then the
conditions that only one side chooses maxi-
mum dividend strategy need to be addressed.
Firstly, we discuss the case that group A choose
the maximum dividend strategy while group
B choose the zero dividend strategy. In this
game, only candidates c choose maximum div-
idend strategy. And their optimal strategy is to
maximize profit rather than to strive for all the
voters. Consequently, all the candidates arrive
at the equilibrium when candidates c obtain
optimal profit. We assume that the farthermost

Then we can obtain the subsequent lemma.

This lemma demonstrates that, when rela-
tive reward r is very small, candidates c would
not choose to compete for all the votes. When
relative reward increases, candidates c would
choose to compete for more votes.
Secondly, we discuss the case that group B
chooses the maximum dividend strategy while
group A chooses the zero dividend strategy. In
this case, the game transforms into a model that
includes a pair of players candidates k and a
competing under maximum dividend policy,
and the player candidates c under zero divi-
dend policy out of participation in contest. We
could derive the equilibrium reward sharing,
profits, and indifferent consumers, as summa-
rized by the following lemma.

mum dividend strategy and candidates c choose zero
dividend strategy, the equilibrium reward sharing

According to section 3, lemma 2 and 3, we
can obtain the payoff matrix of asymmetric
game which is showed in Table 2.

We assume that participation of choosing
maximum dividend strategy in population A is
μ, zero dividend strategy is 1− μ. And in pop-
ulation B, participation of choosing maximum
dividend strategy is δ, zero dividend strategy
is 1 − δ. Thus, by the means of replicator dy-
namics, we could get the following proposi-
tion.
Proposition 7 In the asymmetric game,
when 0.5 < l < 0.6375, ESS is
1) (μ, δ) � (1, 1), if 0 < r < l
2 ;
2) (μ, δ) � (0, 1) or (1, 0), if l
2 < r < l2;
3) (μ, δ) � (1, 0), if r > l2;
when 0.6375 < l < 1, ESS is
1) (μ, δ) � (1, 1), if 0 < r < l
2 ;
2) (μ, δ) � (0, 1) or (1, 0), if l
2 < r < l(4−l)
2(l+2) ;
3) (μ, δ) � (1, 0), if r > l(4−l)
2(l+2) .
The results in proposition 7 can be sum-
marized as Table 3. Counterintuitively, this
proposition reveals several insights. When the
relative reward is small, both of population A
and B would choose the maximum dividend
strategy. When the relative reward is in a cer-
tain range, only one of them would choose the
maximum dividend strategy according to dif-
ferent initial states. When the relative reward is
high enough, only population A choose max-
imum dividend strategy while population B
gives up the maximum dividend strategy com-
pletely.
5.3 Numerical Simulation
In order to intuitively analyze the dynamic evo-
lutionary process of generalized dividend be-
havior in super node selection, we simulate the
effect of relative reward r on ESS in symmetric
and asymmetric games as shown in Figure 6
and 7 respectively.
In Figure 6, the abscissa axis denotes time
t and the ordinate axis denotes the participa-
tion of choosing maximum dividend strategy
θ. We show the dynamic process of the div-
idend behavior with different initial states in
the symmetric case. The parameter τ which
is irrelevant to ESS is chosen as 10 hereinafter.
Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show that when r < 1
or r > 2, θ tends to be 1 as time goes on.
This demonstrates that for a relatively low or
high level of reward, all the candidates would
choose the maximum dividend strategy even-
tually, no matter how many candidates choose
maximum dividend strategy initially. In Fig-
ure 6(c), we assume that r � 1.5 which belongs
to the range (1, 2). Then θ tends to be r−1
3−r �
1
3
as time goes on. This demonstrates that when
the level of reward is in a particular range, only
part of candidates would choose the maximum
dividend strategy eventually, no matter how
many candidates choose maximum dividend
strategy initially. The results shown in Figure
6 are in line with proposition 6.
In Figure 7, a series of numerical simula-
tions are performed to verify the results in
Proposition 7. The abscissa axis and the or-
dinate axis denote μ and δ, the participa-
tion of choosing maximum dividend strategy
in population A and B respectively. When
l � 0.55 ∈ (0.5, 0.6375), Figure 7(a) shows
that ESS is (1, 1) with r � 0.2 ∈ (0, l
2 ), Fig-
ure 7(b) shows that ESS is (0, 1) or (1, 0) with
r � 0.28 ∈ ( l

ESS is (1, 0) with r � 1.2 ∈ (l2 ,∞). When
l � 0.75 ∈ (0.6375, 1), Figure 7(d) shows that
ESS is (1, 1) with r � 0.3 ∈ (0, l

that ESS is (1, 0) with r � 1.5 ∈ ( l(4 − l)
2(l + 2) ,∞).
The simulation results in Figure 7 demonstrate
that no matter the location of middle force is
close to center or edge, there exist three final
states. No matter how many candidates choose
the maximum dividend strategy initially, for a
low level of reward, all the candidates would
choose the maximum dividend strategy even-
tually, but for a relatively high level of reward,
the group of candidates with more votes give
up the maximum dividend strategy completely
and all the other candidates choose the max-
imum dividend strategy. When the level of
reward is in a particular range, different ini-
tial states would result in different choices of
campaign strategies.
6. Conclusions and Future Research
In this paper, we develop a three-player
Hotelling model with two policies to study
how voting policies in DPoS blockchains affect
voter decisions, candidate strategies and their
welfare. Our analytical results present sev-
eral novel insights on blockchain governance
and campaign strategy in DPoS blockchains.
First, we derive the conditions to guarantee
the existence of the positive equilibriums in
300 Pan et al.: Dividend or No Dividend in Delegated Blockchain Governance: A Game Theoretic Analysis
different cases such as zero dividend and max-
imum dividend cases. Second, if the zero div-
idend policy is adopted, the profit of candi-
dates who are neutral about reward sharing is
constant. However, if the maximum dividend
policy is adopted, the neutral candidates profit
decreases as their viewpoint close to extreme.
Third, many voters regard offering dividend
in DPoS as an immoral practice, but the maxi-
mum dividend policy is proven to be beneficial
for voters when relative reward r is larger than
a specific threshold. To the opposite, candi-
dates tend to support the maximum dividend
policy. However, candidate profit under the
maximum dividend policy is lower than that
under the zero dividend policy when r is big
enough. The maximum dividend policy ac-
tually transfers the profit from candidates to
voters. Fourth, only when r is in a particu-
lar range, the zero dividend policy is a better
choice for both the voters and candidates. No
matter which policy the community chooses to
implement, it should manage to guide the ratio
of platform reward and mismatch cost instead
of simply forbidding the other policy. There-
fore, the community managers who oppose the
maximum dividend policy should increase the
reward that super nodes would obtain in order
to make the maximum dividend policy less at-
tractive for candidates. And certainly, the re-
ward should not be too high to hurt the voter
welfare. Fifth, our dynamic analysis of evolu-
tionary game shows when relative reward r is
big or small enough, the maximum dividend
strategy would be the dominant strategy in the
symmetric game. When the reward is in a cer-
tain range, both the maximum and zero divi-
dend strategies would coexist. However, in the
asymmetric game, we show that the strong or-
ganization with more votes in the super node
competition would not choose the maximum
dividend strategy. High reward would protect
the benefit of the candidates with more votes
and consolidate its strong position while low
reward would intensify competition among
candidates. We also perform a series of nu-
merical simulations to verify the above results.
There exist several limitations in this study.
Firstly, we made a few assumptions to sim-
plify the analysis. First, we study only the
situation in which voters are uniformly dis-
tributed from zero dividend to maximum div-
idend. Future work could find out how other
kinds of voter distribution, such as normal dis-
tribution, would affect the conditions in our
results. Secondly, due to a lack of real-world
data, we could not conduct an empirical anal-
ysis in this paper. Future work can include an
empirical component to validate the theoret-
ical results in this paper once empirical data
becomes available. Finally, while we have dis-
cussed the separation of decision rights and
the influence of decision control right (vot-
ing policy making), the resolution of conflicts
about decision-making in blockchains should
be studied in future research.

2) If x > 1

vote for candidates k at first change to vote for
candidates c now. The equilibrium could be
formulated as
σ + Pc − τx2

Then we could get Pc � 2τx−τ, and candidates

Easy to find out that
(i) πc(x) arrives at maximization π̂c2( 1+l

It is obvious that the second order conditions
are negative in each case. Solving the equa-
tions above yields the equilibrium bonus shar-
ing of Pk and Pa in the lemma. Accordingly,
we could derive the equilibrium x′1, x′2, π′c ,
π′k and π′a using the equilibrium bonus shar-
ing. �
