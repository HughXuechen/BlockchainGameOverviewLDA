Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of the research is to investigate users’ adoption of blockchain-based games in China.
Design/methodology/approach – This research applied existing technology diffusion theories to develop a
research model to examine users’ adoption of blockchain-based games. As a result, a research model with nine
research hypotheses was developed. The developed research model was empirically tested using data collected
from a survey of 210 blockchain-based games users. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyse the
collected data.
Findings – The results indicated that seven of nine research hypotheses were supported. It was found that trust,
perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use were key determinants for users’ behavioural
intention to use blockchain-based games. The most influential relationship in the research model appeared to be the
effect of perceived usefulness on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. However, subjective
norms did not have significant positive impacts on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games.
Practical implications – The regulatory support from governmental authorities is essential to provide
additional legal certainty to build users’ trust in playing blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games
providers should arrange the training program targeted to the general users to enhance their understanding
of the key features associated with blockchain-based games. Blockchain-based games developers should come
up with good design solutions to maximize user enjoyment with blockchain-based games by considering
additional entertainment elements.
Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is first of its kind in investigating
the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives. This study contributes to the existing
literature on the adoption of blockchain technology.

the debut of Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin is an entirely digital distribute currency, launched
through a white paper by Nakamoto (2008). One of Bitcoin’s key innovations is the creation
of a decentralized public transaction ledger, called the blockchain, which is transparent and
immutable, being cryptographically verifiable by all participants in the Bitcoin network
(Folkinshteyn and Lennon, 2016). Transactions are denominated in units of its own
currency, termed Bitcoin, so the system is not dependent on any particular national currency
or geographical location; hence, it is completely digital and international in scope.
The disruptive potential of blockchain technology enabled the possibility to expand the
application of this technology into a number of contexts (e.g. supply chain management,
healthcare, gaming, digital authentication, asset trading). However, previous studies on the
individual adoption behaviour of blockchain technology tended to focus on the context of
supply chain management. For instance, Kamble et al. (2019) examined the adoption of
blockchain technology in supply chain in India. Queiroz and Fosso Wamba (2019)
investigated the individual blockchain adoption behaviour in the supply chain field in both
India and the USA based on a revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
(UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Queiroz et al. (2020) studied the driving factors and
barriers to the adoption behaviour of blockchain technology in operations and supply chain
management in Brazil. Little empirical investigation has been conducted to understand the
adoption of blockchain technology on gaming.
Researchers have not systematically assessed the influence of blockchain technology on
gaming because it has been only a few years since blockchain technology applied to online
games. Before the wide implementation and adoption of blockchain technology in the
gaming industry, it is important to have a better understanding of potential factors that
would influence the adoption of blockchain-based games from the end users’ points of view.
To bridge the research gap, this study aims to provide insights into understanding the
adoption of blockchain-based games. This study develops a research model to examine user
adoption of blockchain-based games. As a result, a research model with nine research
hypotheses was developed. The research model is empirically tested using survey data
collected from 210 users of blockchain-based games in China.
This study contributes to the adoption of blockchain technology in two ways. First, this
study is one of the first empirical studies focusing on the adoption of blockchain-based
games. By building a research model based on previous technology diffusion theories, the
perspectives of end users on the adoption of blockchain-based games have been examined.
Second, this study contributes to practice by providing some insights for game developers
and providers to better promote the use and diffusion of blockchain-based games.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical
background. Then, the research model and hypotheses are presented in Section 3. After that,
an empirical study with blockchain-based games users are described in Section 4. Finally,
the conclusion and a discussion of the findings of this study are presented in Section 5.
2. Theoretical background
2.1 Blockchain technology
Blockchain technology refers to a distributed system for cryptographically capturing and
storing a consistent, immutable, linear event log of transactions between networked actors
using a consensus mechanism (Risius and Spohrer, 2017). The blockchain constitutes a set
of protocols and cryptographic methods applied to a network of nodes that collaborate to
achieve the secure recording of data within a distributed database that comprises encrypted
blocks that encapsulate the data (Macrinici et al., 2018). The blockchain technology

underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies allows for a shared digital ledger that is a
continually updated list of all transactions (Morisse, 2015).
Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin offered a new, enhanced
way of capital circulation, new markets and new decentralised autonomous organisations
(Hsieh et al., 2018). Ethereum (Buterin, 2014) is another well-known implementation of
blockchain, which is designed to facilitate smart contracts. A smart contract can be used to
eliminate the interference of any third party and further enhances the decentralization of a
network. Blockchain technology is able to offer a solution to the problem where there is a
need for a reliable ledger in a decentralized environment where not all parties, whether
humans or machines, can be fully trusted (Tshering and Gao, 2020). Blockchain technology
has been successfully applied in application scenarios, such as education (Bdiwi et al., 2017),
logistics (Christodoulou et al., 2018), health care (Dagher et al., 2018), energy (Hou et al.,
2018), supply chain management (Kshetri, 2018) and games (Min et al., 2019).
2.2 Blockchain-based games
Blockchain-based games are online games that use blockchain technology. In other words,
these games are online and designed on the basis of blockchain technology. For instance,
cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, can be used as one of the ways for
conducting financial transactions within online games. Blockchain technology has been
regarded as a disruptive innovation in many application areas, such as financial services,
supply chain management and governance models (Campbell-Verduyn and Goguen, 2017).
Blockchain technology can be applied to financial transactions in online games to ensure the
openness and fairness of financial transactions.
A blockchain-based game is able to offer the true ownership of a digital game asset, as
the link to the owner of the asset can be written on an immutable blockchain in terms of
smart contracts. Smart contracts are open source programs written on the Ethereum
blockchain platform. Smart contracts are constantly being calculated as digital game asset
transactions are verified by the involved game players. The digital game asset ownership
can be tracked via a smart contract on the blockchain. The smart contracts on the
blockchain can also be used to enable instant transfer of ownership of a digital game asset
securely without involving any third parties. As a result, smart contracts help to enforce
digital game asset ownerships and ensure the openness of digital game asset transactions.
Released in 2017, CryptoKitties is one of the most popular games based on blockchain
technology, namely, the Ethereum network. Blockchain is capable of building a clear and
reliable digital ownership through mining where a user can claim ownership of new tokens
contributing with a node. Any transaction data of the blockchain is visible, reliable and
accessible to the involved participants of blockchain (Lu, 2019). Users can breed, trade and
gift different types of virtual cats with CryptoKitties. The blockchain technology helps to
both guarantee the ownerships of virtual cats with CryptoKitties and ensure the validity of
various financial transactions on CryptoKitties. The associated financial transactions with
CryptoKitties, such as selling or breeding, are enforced by smart contracts. Each cat is
unique and cannot be handled by anyone other than its owner. The cat’s ownership is
tracked and proven by smart contract associated with CryptoKitties.
Gods Unchained is another popular blockchain-based game. It is a turn-based collectible
digital card trading game that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. The ownership of each
card is guaranteed by a smart contract. Smart contracts enable users to trade and sell their
cards freely with the true ownership of the cards. In addition, there are other examples of
existing blockchain-based games (e.g. Etheremon, HyperSnakes, HyperDragons).

2.3 Technology diffusion theories
One of the important and long-standing research questions in information systems research
is user adoption of information systems (DeLone and McLean, 1992). Several models, such
as the technology acceptance model (TAM) (Davis, 1989), UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003),
theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) and innovation diffusion theory (Rogers,
1995), have been developed to test user attitude and intention to adopt new technologies.
As listed in Table 1, TAM has been widely used in previous studies on the adoption of
blockchain technology. For instance, an extended TAMmodel has been used to examine the
adoption of cryptocurrencies (Shahzad et al., 2018) and smart lockers (Lian et al., 2020). TAM
has been expanded to investigate different study objects by taking into consideration the
characteristics of the study object in previous studies. For example, research on the adoption
of online games indicated that perceived enjoyment and subjective norms have a significant
impact on users’ behaviour intention to use online games (Lee and Tsai, 2010). Trust has
been identified as one predicting factor for the adoption of blockchain technology in supply
chain in previous studies (Queiroz et al., 2020). This study aimed to extend TAM with
additional factors, such as trust, perceived enjoyment, subjective norms, security and
privacy, to examine user adoption of blockchain-based games. The research model and
research hypotheses are presented in Section 3.
2.4 Adoption of blockchain technology
Compared to the rapid development of blockchain technology, the research on the adoption
of this technology is still in its infancy stage. Based on the literature review, some existing
research on the adoption of blockchain technology is summarized in Table 1. It appears that

most previous studies on the adoption of blockchain tended to focus on digital currencies
(Folkinshteyn and Lennon, 2016; Shahzad et al., 2018) and applications in the field of supply
chain (i.e. Kamble et al., 2019; Queiroz and FossoWamba, 2019).
Most existing studies on blockchain-based games tended to focus on the value and
fairness aspects. For instance, Serada et al. (2020) studied the value created through
blockchain-based games. They found the following three major factors determining the
value of cryptogame tokens: blockchain as a sociotechnical infrastructure, perceived
materiality of tokens and pseudo true ownership (Serada et al., 2020). In addition, Sako et al.
(2021) examined the fairness of markets in blockchain-based games. Furthermore, Li and
Gao (2019) explored the values of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives in China.
However, the research on the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives
has not yet been explored. This study is an early effort to explore the adoption of
blockchain-based games.
3. Research model and research hypotheses
According to the findings in Table 1, TAM has been mostly applied in previous studies on
the adoption of blockchain technology. Therefore, TAM has been selected as a base model to
explore the adoption of blockchain-based games in this study. The proposed research model
for studying the adoption of blockchain-based games is presented in Figure 1. The research
model is an extended model based on TAM. In addition to perceived ease of use, perceived
usefulness and behaviour intention to use from TAM, the model includes trust, perceived
security, privacy, perceived enjoyment and subjective norms as factors to study user
adoption of blockchain-based games. Nine research hypotheses based on the research model
have been proposed in this research model. Each hypothesis as labelled and elaborated in
Figure 1.
3.1 Perceived security
Perceived security has different definitions in various contexts. In the context of e-
commerce, Kalakota and Whinston (1996) defined security as a threat which creates the
“circumstance, condition, or event with the potential to cause economic hardship to data or
network resources in the form of destruction, disclosure, modification of data, fraud, and
abuse”. Previous studies (Salisbury et al., 2001) proved that security was crucial when
consumers conducted a transaction online. Moreover, perceived security has been proposed
as an antecedent of trust together with perceived privacy (Shin, 2010; Yousafzai et al., 2009).

Security is also one of the significant considerations when users decide to use the new
technology and new applications, especially among early adopters. Security issues must be
settled before it would become a feasible and viable option to adopt blockchain technology
(Angelis and da Silva, 2019). The distributed trust mechanism of blockchain can help users
reduce cybersecurity-related risks, which has been found in supply chain management
(Kshetri, 2018). Distributed branches of blockchain reduce the likelihood that the systemwill
crash under attack. Additionally, blockchain technology also enables open rules and
transparent transactions, which increase the security of game assets. Thus, the following
hypothesis has been proposed:
H1. Perceived security has a positive effect on user trust of blockchain-based games.
3.2 Privacy
In traditional online trades, consumers often worried about privacy issues (Liu et al., 2005).
In today’s mobile internet environment, while mobile users increasingly rely on the use of
various mobile applications for their daily activities, the processing of personal data through
these applications poses significant risks to user privacy. Data has been collected by various
applications to facilitate people’s daily lives. Arnott et al. (2007) found that the privacy
features of a website along with shared values were the key antecedents of trust. Using
smart contracts helps to conduct a transaction automatically, avoiding manipulation by
others (Angelis and da Silva, 2019). An anonymous mechanism can be used to protect user
privacy (Cuccuru, 2017). Yue et al. (2016) proposed a blockchain-based application to enable
a patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating
privacy, which provided a new potential way to improve the intelligence of health-care
systems while keeping patient data private. Similarly, when users use blockchain-based
games, their identity information and data can also be protected, which would in turn
positively affect user trust on blockchain-based games. Thus, the following hypothesis has
been proposed:
H2. Privacy has a positive effect on user trust of blockchain-based games.
3.3 Trust
Trust has been a topical subject with technology acceptance in previous literature. Gefen
et al. (2003) integrated trust into the TAM (Davis, 1989) and found that trust had a positive
impact on intended use and trust was influenced by perceived ease of use. Moreover,
Hoffman et al. (1999) found that distrust of security was the main reason for early users not
adopting online shopping. In addition, trust has been proven to have a significant impact on
users’ behaviour intention to play online games (Wu and Liu, 2007).
Playing blockchain-based games involves frequent transaction confirmation processes in
terms of invoking smart contracts. Fleischmann and Ivens (2019) found that trust was a key
driver in the adoption of blockchain-based applications which spans across both functional
(economic and system-related/process-related) and emotional benefit (social and personal)
dimensions. Furthermore, Folkinshteyn and Lennon (2016) indicated that trust was essential
in the adoption of digital currency because users have distinctive trust patterns in
blockchain-based applications where they have no intermediary or control centre. Because
of the encryption and anonymity brought by blockchain technology, blockchain-based
games inherit these technical characteristics, enabling users to be more trustworthy of the

trading behaviour in blockchain-based games than traditional games. Thus, the following
hypothesis has been proposed:
H3. Trust has a positive effect on users’ behaviour intention to use blockchain-based
games.
3.4 Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness from the technology acceptance model
In the classical technology adoption model, both perceived ease of use of the technology and
perceived usefulness of the technology used positively affect users’ intention to use the
technology. Also, the perceived usefulness of the technology is positively affected by
perceived ease of use of the technology. In addition, according to Gefen et al. (2003), a user’s
perceived ease of use of online shopping will affect their trust in online shopping. The easier
the users grasp the usage of new technology, the easier they will generate trust behaviour of
new technology. Blockchain-based games can be seen as the new innovations. It is believed
the hypotheses presented above would apply to blockchain-based games as well. Thus, the
following hypotheses have been proposed:
H4. Perceived usefulness has a positive effect on users’ behaviour intention to use
blockchain-based games.
H5. Perceived ease of use has a positive effect on trust of blockchain-based games.
H6. Perceived ease of use is positively related to perceived usefulness of blockchain-
based games.
H7. Perceived ease of use has a positive effect on users’ behaviour intention to use
blockchain-based games.
3.5 Perceived enjoyment
Hedonic products have the characteristics of providing users with the value of self-
satisfaction. The psychological experience is influenced by the content of products, such as
pictures, sounds, layout and so on. By contrast, users of utilitarian products are mostly
driven by the purpose of completing a specific task or by the improvement of efficiency.
Users mainly use utilitarian products as tools. Hence, there is a fundamental difference
between perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness (Van der Heijden, 2003). When the
purpose of the system is utilitarianism, the reliability coefficient of scale of perceived ease of
use and perceived usefulness is better than that of hedonism (Hess et al., 2014).
Perceived enjoyment is defined as the extent to which the activity of using a specific
system is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right, aside from any performance
consequences resulting from system use (Van der Heijden, 2003). Users can have fun when
they are playing blockchain-based games. Previous studies indicated that perceived
enjoyment had a positive impact on user intention to use a technology. For instance, Ha et al.
(2007) found that perceived enjoyment affected the adoption of mobile games in a mobile
broadband wireless access environment in a positive way. Moreover, Liu et al. (2005)
conducted a study to investigate the driving factors of mobile game adoption in China and
found that perceived enjoyment is one of the key driving factors of a person’s willingness to
play mobile games. Furthermore, Alzahrani et al. (2017) found that perceived enjoyment is
an important driving factor for the actual use of online games among Malaysian
undergraduate students. Thus, the following hypothesis has been proposed:
EL
39,4
602
H8. Perceived enjoyment has a positive effect on users’ behaviour intention to use
blockchain-based games.
3.6 Subjective norms
Subjective norms are generated by the normative beliefs that the person attributes to what a
relevant other expects them to do with respect to adopting a technology as well as their
motivation to comply with those beliefs (Karahanna et al., 1999). The previous literature
suggested that subjective norms would have a positive impact on the intention to use the
technology (Pavlou and Fygenson, 2006). For instance, TAM2 (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)
suggested a positive relationship between subjective norms and intention to use. In addition,
Bhattacherjee (2000) found that subjective norms had a positive effect on users’ behaviour
intention to use e-commerce services. It is expected that there is a positive relationship
between subjective norms and intention to use blockchain-based games. Therefore, the
following hypothesis has been proposed:
H9. Subjective norms has a positive effect on users’ behaviour intention to use
blockchain-based games.
4. An empirical study
To investigate user adoption of blockchain-based games in China, the proposed research
model and hypotheses were empirically tested using the structural equation modelling
(SEM) approach (Bollen, 1998) with subjects in China.
4.1 Instrument development
The validated measurement items from previous studies (Davis, 1989; Kim et al., 2008))
were used as the foundation to create the instrument for this study. For instance, the
scales on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behaviour intention came
from pre-validated TAM measures (Davis, 1989). Privacy was measured by adapting
the scales from Kim et al. (2008). Perceived security was measured by adapting the
scales from Kim et al. (2008) and Vatanasombut et al. (2008). Trust was measured by
adapting the scales from Jarvenpaa et al. (2000). Perceived enjoyment was measured by
adapting the scales from Van der Heijden (2003). Subjective norms were measured by
adapting the scales from Pavlou and Fygenson (2006) and Wu and Chen (2005). As a
result, 27 measurement items (Appendix) were included in the instrument survey. A
five-point Likert scale, with one being the negative end of the scale (strongly disagree)
and five being the positive end of the scale (strongly agree), was used to examine
participants’ responses to the survey items.
4.2 Data collection and sample
The questionnaire consisted of two parts. In the first part, the respondents were asked to fill
out their demographic information (i.e. age, gender, educational level). The online survey
was developed on Sojump which was the largest Chinese service provider engaged in online
questionnaires in March 2019. A survey weblink including all the survey questions was
distributed on a major Chinese social networking platform in November 2019 in China.
When the participants opened the weblink, they were briefed about the purpose of the
survey before being asked to complete the online questionnaire. Each participant received
approximately US$1 as the incentive for participation. The participants had also been
Adoption of
blockchain-

603
informed that the results would be reported only in aggregate form so that their anonymity
would be assured. A total of 328 questionnaires were collected, including 210 valid
questionnaires, and the effective questionnaire response rate was 64.02%. Among the
participants, 38.93% of the participants were male and 61.07% were female. Concerning the
educational level, 90.95% of the respondents were either university students or who had at
least earned a bachelor’s degree. Thus, the respondents’ education level was quite high in
general. Table 2 presents the demographic information of the respondents.
4.3 Test of measure
Convergence validity and discriminant validity were tested first. In the confirmatory factor
analysis, the factor loadings are all above the minimum acceptable value of 0.70, as shown in
Table 3.
To test the reliability and validity of each construct in research model, the internal
consistency of reliability of each construct was tested with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient.
Convergent validity was assessed through the average variance extracted (AVE) and
composite reliability (CR). Furthermore, Bagozzi and Yi (2012) proposed the following
measurement criteria: the CR should exceed 0.7 and the AVE of each construct should
exceed 0.5. As shown in Table 3, all constructs are in acceptable ranges. Furthermore,
Cronbach’s alpha values range from 0.881 to 0.932. All the constructs are above 0.70.
Consequently, the scales are deemed acceptable to continue.
As for discriminant validity, the square roots of AVEs by the constructs were more than
correlations among variables in Table 4. The rest in Table 4 is the correlation coefficient of
the latent variable. The correlation coefficient was greater than the square root of the mean
variance extraction value of the corresponding variable, which proved the good discriminate
validity.
In this study, the goodness-of-fit of the measurement model was examined by using five
widely-used fit indices: the chi-square/degrees of freedom (x 2/d.f.), the normed fit index
(NFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). The fitness measures in
Table 5 indicated that all measures were within acceptable ranges.

4.4 Results of hypotheses testing
To test the hypotheses proposed above, data were collected and analysed using the SEM
(Bollen, 1998). AMOS 22.0 was used to test the structural model. The result of the structural
model is shown in Figure 2.
The results of hypotheses testing are presented in Table 6. The p-value indicates the
significant degree of correlation between the two measured variables. According to the
results in Table 6, seven (H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7 and H8) of the proposed nine hypotheses
were supported.
5. Discussion and conclusion
5.1 Conclusion
This study aimed to investigate user adoption of blockchain-based games in China. To
address this, a research model based on previous technology diffusion theories was
developed and empirically tested with 210 participants in China. According to the results,
seven of the developed nine hypotheses were supported. It was found that trust, perceived
usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use were key determinants for users’
behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The most influential relationship in
the research model appeared to be the effect of perceived usefulness on users’ behavioural
intention to use blockchain-based games. However, subjective norms did not have
significant positive impacts on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games.
5.2 Theoretical contributions
From a theoretical perspective, the major contribution of this research is the proposed
research model which is useful in explaining users’ behaviour intention to use blockchain-
based games. This study is the first of its kind in investigating the adoption of blockchain-
based games from users’ perspectives. Previous studies tended to focus on the value created
through blockchain-based games (Li and Gao, 2019; Serada et al., 2020). However, there is a
research gap on the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives. This
research filled this gap by carrying out an empirical study on the adoption of

blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives in China. This research extended and
enhanced the understanding of the adoption of blockchain-based games. It contributed to
current literature on the adoption of blockchain technology.
The results indicated that perceived usefulness was the most significant influential
factor to users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The use of blockchain-
based games was helpful to solve potential problems associated with online game assets
trading. Compared with traditional online games, blockchain-based games have the
advantage of making the process of online game assets trading more transparent. For
instance, a decentralized, open and transparent trading market through smart contracts can
be established with blockchain-based games. This is consistent with the findings on the
adoption of bike sharing systems (Gao et al., 2019) and the adoption of Bitcoin (Shahzad
et al., 2018).
Perceived enjoyment was the second most significant influential factor to users’
behavioural intention to use to blockchain-based games. A well-designed blockchain-based
game would motivate users to play the game. This is in line with the findings from
Alzahrani et al. (2017). Alzahrani et al. (2017) found that perceived enjoyment in the game
was one of the major motivations for a user to play the game.
The positive influence of trust on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based
games has been supported in this study. There are many game assets transactions within
blockchain-based games. Trust is one of the important elements involved in these
transactions. Unless sufficient trust have been accumulated by blockchain-based games
among users, users would not choose to trade within these games. This finding is consistent
with the findings on the adoption of mobile payment systems (Srivastava et al., 2010), and
the adoption of blockchain in operation and supply chain management (Queiroz et al., 2020).
A user’s perceived ease of use can promote the formation of user trust in blockchain-
based games. At present, most of the blockchain-based games are built on the basis of
Ethereum. An open-source blockchain plugin is required to be installed on the blockchain-
based gaming platform to enable players to trade assets with their wallets in games. This
would give users the ability to link their blockchain wallets to their servers. To trade assets

on the blockchain-based gaming platform, users need to install the plugin on the platform.
The results from this study indicated that, if the installation process of the plugin on the
platform is easy, it would have a significant positive impact on users’ behavioural intention
to use the games on the platform. Furthermore, it was also found that perceived ease of use
had a positive impact on user trust of blockchain-based games. In other words, the
improvement on the perceived ease of use of the blockchain-based game by users would be
helpful to increase players’ trust in the game.
Subjective norms did not have a significant positive influence on users’ behavioural
intention to use blockchain-based games. This finding is consistent with the finding on the
adoption of blockchain technology in supply chains (Kamble et al., 2019). Some users
indicated that they often heard of the concept of blockchain. However, they did not have a
good understanding of the principles behind applications of blockchain technology.
Although blockchain technology is booming in China, some users might misunderstand the
concept of blockchain and applications of blockchain technology. Several major newspapers
in China have promoted the development of the blockchain industry by introducing and
describing the concept of blockchain, as well as describing innovative blockchain-based
applications. However, these newspapers also pointed out users’ improper behaviour with
blockchain-based applications and recommended that the use of blockchain-based
applications should be regulated. Therefore, this would have a negative impact on users’
willingness to use blockchain-based applications (e.g. blockchain-based games) from the
perspective of subjective norms.
Perceived security had a significant positive impact on user trust of blockchain-based games.
Blockchain has inherent characteristics that provide the means for security. For instance, advanced
cryptographic techniques are used to secure transactions on blockchain. Kshetri (2017) indicated
that the use of blockchain-based systems is secure and can avoid attacks common in present
securitymechanisms due to the fact that the systems do not have a single point of failure. A secured
blockchain-based gaming platform is of help to build user trust in playing games on the platform.
However, privacy did not have a significant positive effect on user trust of blockchain-based
games. Some users did have some concerns with the privacy of data transactions on blockchain-
based applications. As the transaction data is disclosed on the blockchain and can be viewed by
other users, the privacy of the transaction party cannot be guaranteed. One of the appealing aspects
of blockchain technology is the degree of transparency that it can provide. In other words, it means
transactions within the blockchain wallets owned by one user might be searchable through public
transaction records. It implies that it is possible to reveal transaction parties’ private transactions on
blockchain-based applications. Moreover, it could also be due to users’ knowledge on privacy
protection mechanisms of blockchain-based applications. For instance, some users might not be
aware of or may lack the knowledge of privacy protection mechanisms of blockchain-based
applications (e.g. blockchain-based games). Previous studies (Krombholz et al., 2016) also revealed
that the majority of users were not aware of backupmechanisms and the inbuilt privacy designs of
blockchains.
5.3 Practical implications
This study also provides some practical implications. It is of help for practitioners to gain a
better understanding of the factors surrounding the adoption of blockchain-based games.
First, trust was found to have a significant positive impact on user intention to use blockchain-
based games. The significant effect of trust on user intention to use blockchain-based games should
be a focus of attention for developers and providers of blockchain-based games. A good
understanding of security protectionmechanisms of blockchain technology is essential to build user
trust on blockchain-based games. Therefore, it is important for the providers of blockchain-based
EL
39,4
608
games to dedicate their time and efforts in enhancing users’ knowledge on various security issues
with blockchain technology. For instance, providers of blockchain-based games can offer some
interesting video clips to introduce key security protectionmechanisms of blockchain technology in
an easy-to-understand manner. Moreover, developers of blockchain-based games should also
improve their understanding of trust-related concerns from users’ perspectives to better fulfil user
expectations with playing blockchain-based games. Furthermore, regulatory support from
governmental authorities would provide additional legal certainty to build user trust in playing
blockchain-based games. For instance, the government can issue regulatory guidance to regulate
various issueswithfinancial transactions associatedwith blockchain-based games.
Second, perceived ease of use was another predictor for maximizing the adoption of blockchain-
based games. Some users might face problems with installing relevant plugins on the gaming
platform to play blockchain-based games due to the lack of required knowledge. Developers of
blockchain-based games should design a good solution to ease users’ efforts with plugin installation
for playing blockchain-based games. Furthermore, some users might lack knowledge of blockchain
technology when playing blockchain-based games. Providers of blockchain-based games should
arrange the training program targeted to the general users to enhance their understanding of key
features associatedwith blockchain-based games.
In addition, the findings indicated that perceived enjoyment did have a positive impact
on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The users of blockchain-
based games would like to have an enjoyable and fun experience when playing blockchain-
based games. Developers of blockchain-based games should create good design solutions to
maximize users’ enjoyment with blockchain-based games by considering additional
entertainment elements.
5.4 Limitations
There were some limitations with this study. First, the research model and hypotheses were
only tested in one country (i.e. China). Therefore, the generalizability of the results to other
countries remains to be determined. Second, the findings of this study may be limited due to
the relatively small sample size. This sample may not be fully representative of the entire
population in China. Third, all the data were collected using self-reported scales in this
study. This may lead to some cautions because common method variance may account for
some of the results. Fourth, it was found that H2 and H9 were not supported in this study.
Thus, this needs to be further investigated in additional studies. Last but not least, there
might exist other factors that influence user adoption of blockchain-based games.
5.5 Future research recommendations
There exist some recommendations for future research. First, this study found some
potential barriers for the adoption of blockchain-based games. For instance, some users had
problems with playing blockchain-based games due to a lack of knowledge of blockchain
technology. Some users did not have a good understanding of security issues based on
blockchain technology. Future studies can look further into these barriers by interviewing
users of blockchain-based games. This would provide additional opportunities to further
understand the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives. Second, as the
development of blockchain-based games is yet in an early stage, there will be more andmore
blockchain-based games in the near future. Future studies can further explore the adoption
of blockchain-based games with these new blockchain-based games. Third, generalizability
of the findings in this study can be further explored by expanding the subjects of this study
to other countries. Furthermore, some mediating factors (e.g. gender) may provide new
opportunities for future research.
