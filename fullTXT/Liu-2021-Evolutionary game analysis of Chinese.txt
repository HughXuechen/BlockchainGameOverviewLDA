Abstract. Blockchain technology is considered to be the representative technology of the fourth 
technological revolution, and logistics and supply chain field has been considered as the main application 
direction in the next step by industry and academia. In order to study the behavior and intention of Chinese 
cross-border logistics enterprises to introduce blockchain into internal supply chain, this paper constructs a 
model of cross-border logistics enterprises adopting blockchain technology on the basis of bounded 
rationality based on the game model, this paper attempts to find out the factors that affect the introduction of 
blockchain into the internal supply chain through mathematical derivation and numerical analysis. The 
game results show that the willingness of cross-border logistics enterprises to adopt blockchain is closely 
related to the technical ability of blockchain, the incremental performance after the introduction of 
blockchain, the conversion cost of blockchain technology, and other factors. Enterprises should coordinate 
various factors and choose to adopt blockchain technology according to their own situation. 
1 Introduction  
Blockchain technology, as an integrated and innovative 
product of chain data structure, distributed database, 
cryptography encryption, intelligent contract and other 
technologies, has been extended from the original 
financial field to other fields in recent years, such as data 
transaction and sharing, intellectual property 
management, information security. Logistics and supply 
chain is considered by industry and academia as the 
main application direction of this technology in the next 
few years. The core technical features of blockchain 
include the tamper and traceability of data, distributed 
accounting and storage, point-to-point transaction and 
decentralized architecture, automatic intelligent contracts. 
In the field of logistics and supply chain, the problems 
such as product tracking and quality assurance, poor 
control capability of the whole process, high risk of data 
and privacy leakage, and difficulty of information 
sharing of carrier have not been fundamentally solved. 
However, for cross-border logistics business with more 
participants, more complex processes, greater 
supervision difficulty, higher trust cost and transaction 
cost, these problems will be more prominent, especially 
in recent years, under the background of the rapid 
growth of China's digital economy and e-commerce 
industry, cross-border logistics industry also urgently 
needs to introduce new technologies to solve these 
problems. 
Many studies have involved the application of 
blockchain technology in the cross-border logistics 
industry. Davor dujak et al. believe that blockchain has 
great potential for large-scale improvement. Because 
blockchain technology is expected to overcome the 
problem of trust and allow distrust, it can provide a safe 
and reliable logistics and supply chain information 
exchange system in the supply network. The supply 
chain is moving from blockchain to a wider range of 
distributed accounting technology [1]. Edvard tijan et al. 
studied the possibility of the development of distributed 
data storage technology represented by blockchain in 
Sustainable Logistics and supply chain management. 
The main problems and challenges in logistics, such as 
order delay, commodity damage, errors and multiple 
input data, can be minimized by introducing blockchain 
technology [2]. Hanqing Wu found that the traditional 
supply chain management mechanism has many 
problems, such as insufficient information sharing, long 
data retrieval delay, unreliable product tracking and so 
on. The latest development of blockchain technology 
shows great potential to solve these problems, because it 
has the characteristics of invariance, transparency and 
decentralization [3]. Zvonko Merka Chen et al.  believe 
that the advantage of blockchain technology is to 
improve the security, speed up the transaction speed, 
decentralization, invariance, transparency and provide 
trust. The combination of blockchain technology and the 
Iot in logistics and transportation is conducive to 
business process optimization and supply chain 
traceability improvement of traceability and 
transparency and significant financial cost savings [4]. 
According to the general definition, blockchain can 
be divided into permissioned blockchain and 
permissionless blockchain (or public blockchain). 
Permissioned blockchain also includes private chain and 
consortium chain. A permissioned blockchain means that

the blockchain is only open to specific entities, and 
certain permissions are required for data writing, reading, 
and modifying. The permissions of the private chain are 
completely owned by an entity, while the permissions of 
the consortium chain are jointly owned by a certain 
number of entities. The permissionless blockchain refers 
to the decentralized database, which is open to all 
subjects and can read and write data freely. The typical 
applications of permissionless blockchain include bitcoin, 
Ethereum, IBM Hyperledger, etc. due to its low 
transaction efficiency, high transaction cost, poor 
scalability and other problems, it is difficult to be widely 
used in the fields other than digital currency and finance, 
so in the future, the permissioned blockchain will be 
widely used for enterprises. This paper studies the 
process of cross-border logistics enterprises adopting 
blockchain in the internal supply chain of the 
organization, and does not involve different enterprises 
using blockchain technology in the joint supply chain. 
Therefore, the blockchain we mentioned below refers to 
the private chain in the permissioned blockchain. 
From the existing research, we find that there is still a 
large literature gap in the research on the adoption of 
blockchain in China's specific industries, especially in 
the field of logistics and supply chain. In recent years, 
China's cross-border commerce and logistics industry 
has developed rapidly, and the application of digital 
technology in this industry is also very high. At the same 
time, China is also in the forefront of the world in the 
development and application of blockchain technology, 
but at present, China's cross-border commerce and 
logistics industry is developing rapidly The proportion of 
cross-border logistics enterprises using blockchain 
technology in the supply chain business is still very low, 
so it is necessary to study the application of blockchain 
technology in China's cross-border logistics enterprises 
under this background. 
In the research on blockchain adoption in other 
countries or industries, most scholars use structural 
equation model for empirical research, and some use 
expert interviews for qualitative research. As the 
adoption and diffusion of emerging technologies in the 
industry level is a long-term dynamic process, game 
theory is a suitable analysis tool, but the assumption of 
complete rationality of static game is difficult to achieve, 
and the evolutionary game model based on partial 
rationality and dynamic learning of game players is more 
in line with the facts. Therefore, this paper constructs a 
dynamic model for cross-border logistics enterprises to 
adopt blockchain technology This paper attempts to use 
mathematical derivation method to explore the main 
factors that affect the adoption behavior of enterprises, 
so as to provide some reference for enterprises. 
2 Model assumption  
In the dynamic game process of cross-border logistics 
enterprises adopting blockchain technology, the main 
players of the game are cross-border logistics enterprise 
groups, and the evolutionary game requires that the 
participants should be groups of a certain scale rather 
than individuals, while that of Chinese cross-border 
logistics enterprises is consistent with this assumption. 
Under the market mechanism, cross-border logistics 
enterprises independently choose their own strategies. 
Due to the uncertainty of the development of blockchain 
technology and the incomplete and asymmetric 
information, the introduction of blockchain technology 
within the organization requires higher R & D and 
operation investment. Therefore, in the initial stage, only 
partially rational enterprises will not directly choose to 
adopt blockchain technology The adoption decisions of 
enterprises will change with the continuous maturity of 
enterprises, the change of internal and external 
environment of organizations and industries. 
Based on the actual situation of China's cross-border 
logistics enterprises, we divide them into two groups: 
group A and group B. group a refers to enterprises with 
large scale and technological strength. Most of these 
enterprises are subsidiaries of China's large-scale e-
commerce platforms or have received investment 
support from these companies. The business scope of 
enterprises includes cross-border logistics and domestic 
logistics; group B refers to enterprises without Supported 
by e-commerce platform, they only carry out cross-
border logistics business. There is no absolute 
heterogeneity in their capabilities in cross-border 
logistics business. Under the market mechanism, the 
technology adoption decision-making behaviors of the 
two types of enterprises are independent. Our basic 
assumptions are as follows: 
For whether or not to introduce blockchain 
technology into the internal supply chain of an 
organization, the strategy space of the two types of 
enterprises is {adopt blockchain technology, not adopt 
blockchain technology}. The probability of individuals 
in group A of enterprise choosing to adopt blockchain 
strategy is x(x[0,1]), and the probability of choosing 
not to adopt blockchain strategy is 1-x. the probability of 
individuals in group B of enterprise choosing to adopt 
blockchain strategy is y(y[0,1]), and the probability of 
choosing not to adopt blockchain strategy is 1-y. 
The original benefits of two types of enterprises are 
R1 and R2, when they do not adopt blockchain 
technology and traditional supply chain system, and the 
original costs are C1 and C2. The benefits obtained when 
choosing to adopt blockchain technology to transform 
the traditional supply chain network are R1+R1 and 
R2+R2.The comprehensive adoption costs of 
conversion, coordination and operation required for 
introducing blockchain are recorded as C1 and C2 
respectively. Then the total cost of adopting blockchain 
technology is C1+C1 and C2+C2. It needs higher 
investment to transform from the past centralized supply 
chain architecture to multi-center blockchain architecture. 
In the initial stage, both C1 and C2 are relatively high. 
With the continuous development of technology, these 
costs will gradually decrease. When one enterprise 
adopts the blockchain technology and the other 
enterprise does not adopt the blockchain technology, the 
adopter will have a certain competitive advantage and 
bring potential loss of income to the other party. We

record them as L1 and L2.When the two types of 
enterprises choose to introduce blockchain technology to 
transform the supply chain system, due to the significant 
differences in organizational resources, technical 
capabilities and talents, the ability of enterprises to 
develop blockchain is also different. We use 1 and 2 to 
represent the ability coefficient of a and B enterprises to 
apply blockchain Technology in the supply chain 
(1[0,1], 2[0,1]). Based on the above assumptions, 
we establish the game income matrix of two types of 
cross-border logistics enterprise groups adopting 
blockchain behavior, as shown in Table 1.

3 Model derivation and analysis  
When an individual in A-class enterprise chooses to 
adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain, the 
benefits are as follows: 
 
(1) 
When an individual in A-class enterprise chooses not 
to adopt blockchain technology, the benefits are as 
follows: 
     (2) 
Therefore, the average expected income of   
enterprises A is: 
                      (3) 
The dynamic equation of enterprises A adopting 
blockchain strategy is as follows: 
                                                                    (4) 
When an individual in enterprise B chooses to adopt 
blockchain technology in the supply chain, the benefits 
are as follows: 
                                                                   (5) 
When an individual in enterprise B chooses not to 
adopt blockchain technology, the benefits are as follows: 
         (6) 
 
Therefore, the average expected income of   
enterprises B is: 
                   (7) 
The dynamic equation of  enterprises B adopting 
blockchain strategy is as follows: 
                                                                              (8) 
The game process of two types of enterprises 
adopting blockchain behavior constitutes a two-
dimensional dynamic system. Let  , 
we get five partial equilibrium points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), 
(1, 1), (x *, y *)，Where x * and y * are respectively 
.The partial 
equilibrium obtained by simultaneous replication of 
dynamic equations is not necessarily the evolutionary 
stability strategy(ESS) of evolutionary game, thus we 
need to further analyze the local stability of these five 
partial equilibrium points. The Jacobian matrix of the 
power system can be expressed as: 
            (9) 
When the local equilibrium satisfies two conditions, 
trace condition  and determinant 
condition , it will become 
an ESS. Obviously, since the trace of matrix J at the 
point (x *, y *) is 0, it does not meet the requirements of 
ESS, so the equilibrium point must not be ESS. Next, we 
further analyze the stability strategies of  other four  
points. Table 2 shows the values of the four partial 
equilibrium points.

According to the trace and determinant of four points 
substituted into the matrix J, the local stability of the 
system Jacobian matrix is analyzed, and the equilibrium 
results under different conditions are obtained, as shown 
in Table 3. For the convenience of the discussion below, 
We use  and  express 1 (R1+ R1)- R1-C1, 2 (R2+ 
R2)- R2-C2 respectively. Table 3 lists four possible

these four points in detail.

stability strategy of the system is (0, 0). In order to verify 
our derivation and show the evolution trend more 
intuitively, we use MATLAB software to simulate the 
game process. Under the condition of this situation, we 
assign values to the parameters, substituting numerical 
simulation, as shown in Figure 1, the final evolution is 
that the probability of class A enterprises and class B 
enterprises finally adopting blockchain technology will 
be close to 0. (the specific parameter values are

this situation, we assign values to the parameters,

the final evolution situation is that the probability of 
adopting blockchain technology for class A enterprises 
and class B enterprises will be close to 1. This is an ideal 
situation for us to promote the application of blockchain 
technology at the industry level. In order to achieve this 
evolution state, the net income value of two types of 
enterprises after adopting blockchain technology needs 
to be high enough, the technical ability needs to be 
strong enough, and the technology conversion cost needs 
to be low enough. (the specific parameter values are

4 Conclusion and Prospection  
This paper analyzes the dynamic evolution game process 
of the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply 
chain of the organization by cross-border logistics 
enterprises in the market mechanism. The research finds 
that the benefit added value, the cost of developing and 
transforming the operation blockchain and the technical 
capability of the enterprise will significantly affect the 
organization's adoption of block chain technology in the 
internal supply chain, whether it is the combination of e-
commerce business or the single cross-border logistics 
enterprise. In order to realize the large-scale application 
of blockchain technology in China's cross-border 
logistics enterprises, these factors must be considered 
first by the enterprises under the market mechanism. In 
terms of how to improve the technical capability of 
enterprises, whether to independently develop and 
operate blockchain system, or to adopt existing open 
source platform or cooperate with other enterprises to 
develop, this requires enterprises to choose according to 
their own actual situation. In terms of cost, in addition to 
technical cost, the internal allocation of resources for 
new and old technologies and the staff's allocation of 
traditional technology are required The effect of 
dependence on new technology resistance will have a 
great impact on the cost of adopting blockchain. In terms 
of performance increase, how to ensure the expected 
revenue after blockchain technology is used in the 
supply chain is of great importance. If the enterprise 
adopts blockchain technology in the absence of mature 
solutions, it may make the adoption of blockchain 
technology The increase in benefits is limited. 
For a diffusion process of technological innovation, 
the diffusion of technology under market mechanism is 
only the basic situationLearning from the development 
experience of similar technologies in the past, the 
government's regulation and incentive behavior will 
significantly change the application speed of 
technological innovation. In addition, for the cross-
border logistics industry, due to the rapid growth of the 
number of emerging middle-income groups in China and 
the change of consumers' consumption concept, 
consumers' preference for technology choice will also 
affect the technology adoption decisions of enterprises 
due to the demand for high-quality logistics services. In 
the future research, we can further analyze the evolution 
process of the adoption of blockchain technology in the 
supply chain of China's cross-border logistics industry 
under government incentives and consumer preferences.
