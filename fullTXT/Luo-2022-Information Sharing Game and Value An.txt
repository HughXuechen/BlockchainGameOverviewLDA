Abstract: To address the question of whether small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should
follow benchmark companies in establishing a blockchain-based information sharing platform, a
two-tier supply chain decision-making problem dominated by retailers and containing two manufac-
turers of unequal status is analyzed, including the impact on the utility and social welfare of different
game players in the supply chain and the supply chain as a whole, taking into account the fact that
consumers are sensitive to both price and quality. For this purpose, traditional cooperation models,
short-term and long-term models based on blockchain technology for information sharing were
constructed and solved, respectively. The findings suggest that in the short term, the establishment of
a blockchain technology-based information sharing platform will widen the status gap between man-
ufacturers, making the strong stronger and the weak weaker, with retailers’ profits and social welfare
suffering and no change in consumer surplus. In the long term, the quality improvement effect of
information sharing will narrow the gap between manufacturers and increase members’ profits, with
retailers and the entire supply chain experiencing a significant increase in profits after a short period
of time, as well as an increase in consumer surplus and social welfare. In addition, when consumer
price sensitivity and quality sensitivity are high, the establishment of a blockchain technology-based
information sharing platform is beneficial for the stronger manufacturers, detrimental to the weaker
manufacturers, and beneficial for the supply chain in the long term; otherwise, the absence of a
blockchain technology-based information sharing platform is beneficial for the weaker manufacturers
and the supply chain.

1. Introduction
The development of the digital economy and e-tailing has increased the randomness
of consumer demand and requirements for products and services, which requires modern
businesses to provide consumers with shorter receipt periods, higher levels of service,
and faster response times, all of which rely on the accuracy, reliability, and validity of
corporate information. As a result, information sharing along the supply chain is becoming
increasingly important [1]. The development of big data technology and network data
exchange capabilities has provided favorable conditions for supply chain enterprises to
share information, and companies have established supply chain information sharing
methods based on EDI, XML, the Internet or data warehouses. However, the above
methods have poor risk response capability, data authenticity cannot be guaranteed, and
the core enterprises have significant amount of control, which reduces the effectiveness of
information sharing among supply chain enterprises.
Blockchain was first proposed by scholar Satoshi Nakamoto, mainly by consensus
mechanism using cryptographic algorithms to achieve decentralized design and provide
point-to-point transactions on this basis. Blockchain technology can well fit the require-
ments of supply chain information sharing due to its decentralization, immutability, as well

as openness and transparency [2], overcoming the defects of existing information sharing
methods and building reliable information transmission methods in a low-cost way, which
gradually becomes a new breakthrough point for supply chain information sharing.
In December 2016, the “13th Five-Year Plan” issued by the State Council of China
included blockchain technology as a strategic technology for the first time in China’s
national development plan. According to the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) survey
of 202 logistics executives in 16 countries and regions, 14% of respondents are using and
investing in blockchain technology, 77% expect to use it in the next 3 years, and 77% of
pioneers state that blockchain can help reduce cost, time, and risk in the supply chain [3].
In fact, a number of large enterprises have already applied blockchain technology to the
supply chain. For example, Walmart joins major food retailers to build a transparent and
traceable food supply chain using IBM blockchain technology, shipping giant Maersk has
used blockchain technology to build a global digital trade platform to improve efficiency
and transparency in shipping, and China’s Lenovo Group has used blockchain and the
supply chain “double-chain fusion” has greatly improved the information sharing and
process transparency between suppliers-factories-enterprises, proving that blockchain
technology has great value in the supply chain sector.
This paper discusses whether enterprises should establish a blockchain-based infor-
mation sharing platform, and analyzes the changes in the surplus and social welfare of
suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers before and after the establishment of a blockchain-
based information sharing platform. In addition, it discusses the value and challenges
of blockchain technology for enterprises, and analyzes the decision-making process and
related impacts of blockchain technology for enterprises. Furthermore, the paper verifies
the application value of blockchain and the conclusions of the paper are presented through
a mathematical derivation and actual cases of Walmart.
2. Research Review
2.1. Supply Chain Information Sharing
In order to deal with the problem of information silos in the supply chain, supply chain
companies need to be more closely and frequently connected, and an important element
of close coordination is information sharing [4]. To this end, scholars at home and abroad
have explored information transfer and coordination among different types of supply chain
enterprises in the form of contracts. For example, Khan et al. found that the introduction of
information sharing in sustainable supply chains can also provide benefits to both buyers
and sellers, including increased profits for sellers and lower prices for buyers [5]. Ding
and Wang et al. verified that information sharing increases manufacturers’ profits and
reduces sellers’ profits and consumer surplus in green supply chains [6]. Backstrand, J and
Fredriksson, A proposed that in the construction supply chain, suppliers should be able
to act as collectors of information and thus improve the performance of the construction
supply chain, rather than only as receivers of information [7]. Xue et al. suggested
that information sharing in the construction supply chain is conducive to improving
the management and service level of general contractors [8]. Christensen, FMM et al.
used a multi-case study approach to analyze how the environmental characteristics of
food processors affect the sharing of information between supply chain members [9].
ZHOU et al. studied the mechanism to achieve coordination and information sharing
of fresh produce under uncertainty of demand [10]. Safra et al. proposed an integrated
production allocation method for apparel supply chains based on information sharing,
showing that apparel supply chains based on sales information sharing can result in
significant cost savings [11]. In low-carbon supply chains, Yang et al. studied the different
information sharing strategies of low-carbon supply chain members in a blockchain scenario
and concluded that retailers would decide whether to share information based on opaque
information in the marketplace, such as the efficiency of value-added services [12].
In terms of research content, researchers have focused on the impact of vertical in-
formation sharing and corresponding strategies under the influence of different scenarios
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 3 of 22
and factors. Cachon demonstrated the value of information sharing in vertical supply
chains in terms of costs and benefits [13]. Mittendorf et al. argued that retailer information
sharing can, in turn, increase the incentives for manufacturers to bear the costs of increased
investment in order to boost retail demand, and therefore the incentives for retailers to
share market information exist. Other scholars have incorporated different influencing
factors into the vertical supply chain information sharing process, for example, Li and
Yi et al. explored strategies for vertical information sharing under stochastic demand by
taking into account government subsidies and consumer preferences [14]. Costantino et al.
investigated the relationship between information sharing and ordering strategies to ad-
dress the bullwhip effect of inventory variation [15]. Wu introduced capacity constraints
into the information sharing strategy between manufacturers and argued that the price
of supply affects the information sharing strategy, while capacity constraints reverse the
sharing strategy [1].
2.2. Blockchain in the Supply Chain
The current use of blockchain technology in supply chains is mainly focused on the
field of supply chain finance, including mechanism design, application optimization, and
technology optimization. Thomas et al. have elaborated on the mechanism design of
blockchain technology for supply chain applications [16]. Edvard Tijan et al. provided
a comprehensive overview of the application and rising trend of blockchain technology
in the supply chain, as well as the possible obstacles in the application of blockchain [17].
Babich et al. argued that blockchain technology has advantages for supply chain operations,
but still suffers from the lack of standardization, privacy, and data validity [18]. Chod et al.
developed an open-source blockchain protocol that provides supply chain companies with
the ability to obtain favorable financing terms at a lower signal cost [19]. Through the study,
it was found that blockchain technology has advantages mainly in solving information
asymmetry in supply chain finance, enterprise supervision, improving settlement, and
clearing efficiency and financial operation risks, etc. For the application of blockchain
technology, other aspects of the supply chain are still under research. Kshetri proposed the
application of blockchain technology in the supply chain to improve the transparency and
accountability among supply chain enterprises [20]. Sily Johny and C. Priyadharsini argued
that the application of blockchain technology can provide transparency, authenticity, and
confidentiality in the supply chain, which is particularly important in the pharmaceutical
supply chain, in the context of increasing risks to the security of IoT data [21]. Further
research by Ifeyinwa Juliet Orji et al. identified the availability of specific blockchain
tools, infrastructure, government policy, and support as key influences on the adoption
of blockchain technology in the freight logistics industry [22]. Lixin Shen et al. argued
that blockchain technology can be a good solution to the bottlenecks caused by traditional
centralized data storage and can facilitate seamless operations and regulation of port cold
chain logistics, but it is a challenging task to incentivize port cold chain companies to adopt
blockchain technology [23]. Junjin Wang et al. argued that while blockchain technology has
many benefits, such as improved efficiency of port logistics clearance and transparency of
shipments, the key to being able to reap these benefits lies in the successful construction and
application of blockchain technology, and the key to construction lies in the relationship
between the operational costs of blockchain technology and the corresponding benefits [24].
Zhou Xingjian and Li Jizi analyzed the relationship between the power battery recycling
supply chain and the characteristics of blockchain, and proposed a new blockchain-based
recycling model that is higher than the traditional recycling model [25].
Furthermore, some researchers are cautious about the value of applying blockchain
technology, such as Jeong-Han Yoon, who believed that it is difficult for logistics personnel
to be clear about the benefits of blockchain, while professional consultants were concerned
about the maturity of blockchain applications in the supply chain. Moreover, through the
application of blockchain technology in port logistics, economic factors are still the core
competitive advantage of port logistics [26].

Therefore, from the perspective that SMEs expect to emulate benchmark companies
that have already adopted blockchain technology to establish a blockchain technology-
based information sharing platform, this paper develops a game model containing two
unequally positioned manufacturers and one dominant retailer. In addition, it discusses
the establishment and non-establishment of a blockchain technology-based information
sharing platform and the long-term demand, pricing strategy, and revenue distribution
after establishment. Furthermore, the paper discusses the situation of consumer surplus
and social welfare from a public perspective, thus informing the decision-making of small
and medium-sized supply chain members and the public sector.
3. Problem Description and Assumptions
3.1. Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Information Sharing Process
Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, smart contracts, as well as trans-
parency and traceability [2], which indicates that the application of blockchain technology
can promote transparency and security in the supply of goods and information transfer in
the supply chain, and advance the intelligence of product manufacturing and the platform
of information sharing [3]. For manufacturers with competitive relationships, the choice
to broadcast wholesale product information (wholesale price, quantity, lead time, etc.)
to a common blockchain information platform and make it public after establishing a
blockchain-based information sharing platform (see Figure 1) indicates that any member
of the blockchain consortium will see the information made public by the manufacturer
(including its competitors), at which point there is sufficient information in the consortium.
Similarly, retailers will choose to upload market demand information from their own
forecasts and research as well as their own inventory to the blockchain-based information
sharing platform in order to ensure the stability and benefits of the alliance. Each time
a manufacturer and retailer uploads information, it forms a block and is assigned a time
parameter to ensure the authenticity of the information, and then is used as a basis for in-
formation traceability. At the same time, the retailer’s order request and the manufacturer’s
shipping action will be automatically executed with the help of blockchain smart contract
technology when the established conditions are met, greatly reducing the costs and errors
caused by manual execution.

only the key parts of the actual shared information.

3.2. Description of the Problem
In this paper, we consider the existence of a few suppliers in the industry, i.e., an
oligopolistic market. Assume a two-tier supply chain with two unequal manufacturers
M1 and M2 and a dominant retailer R. The manufacturers compete with each other and
supply the retailer at the same time, and consumer demand is influenced by both the
quality of the product µi (i = 1, 2) and the retailer’s selling price Pr. The dominant retailer
first determines the order quantity µi (i = 1, 2) and selling price Pr based on the wholesale
market price Wi (i = 1, 2) and consumer demand Dr, and then determines different order
quantities from the two manufacturers based on their preferences r (r ≤ 1). The two
manufacturers will determine the wholesale price based on the intensity of competition
between competitors σ and the order quantity Di of sellers, respectively, and make a
maximum profit. In order to coordinate the supply chain members and reduce costs and
increase revenue, the traditional model without blockchain technology (N model) and the
model with blockchain technology (B model) are formed based on the retailers’ decision
whether to adopt blockchain technology to establish an information sharing platform (see
Figure 2).
Figure 2. N-mode and B-mode structure diagram.
Model N: The traditional supply chain model of no information sharing between the
retailer and the two manufacturers, where information on wholesale prices, demand, and
delivery times is opaque, and the closure of information makes the two manufacturers work
separately with the retailer using a decentralized decision-making model, where wholesale
prices are negotiated and set separately between the manufacturer and the retailer, where
the retailer wholesales products of quality µ1 and µ2 from the manufacturer at wholesale
prices W1 and W2, respectively, and where there is competition between manufacturers on
both wholesale prices and product quality.
Model B: A blockchain technology-based information sharing platform is established
between the retailer and the two manufacturers to share information, such as wholesale
prices and inventory. With transparent information, the two manufacturers, as oligarchs,
need to conspire to specify a uniform wholesale price to avoid falling into a vicious price
competition, when the price is the same, W1 = W2 = W, the quality and price competition
between manufacturers turns into a single quality competition, and the retailer wholesales
products of quality µ1 and µ2 from manufacturers M1 and M2 at wholesale prices W, but
manufacturers with poorer quality will suffer in terms of wholesale volume under the
retailer’s quality preference.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 6 of 22
3.3. Basic Assumptions
(a) Retailers have different base preferences r for the two manufacturers. These pref-
erences are based on a number of historical transactions between the retailer and
the manufacturer, and are increased by smooth communication between the two
parties, pleasant transactions, early delivery and payment, and represent the basis
of cooperation between the retailer and the manufacturer and the established trust
and transaction base. This indicates that despite slight differences in quality and price
between the two manufacturers, it is possible to choose to work with a manufacturer
of slightly lower quality (or slightly higher price), but with a certain trading base, if
there is little deviation in quality and price. In general, this preference is reflected in
supplier management in the form of a hierarchy of suppliers.
(b) With the establishment of a blockchain-based information sharing platform, infor-
mation transparency allows for the convergence of the two oligopolies of wholesale
prices. In an oligopolistic market where there are only two competing manufacturers,
the price of products is the same but there is a certain difference in quality. Although
one party can lower its price to obtain a larger wholesale volume, after the estab-
lishment of a blockchain-based information sharing platform, the wholesale price
of products is transparent and the other party is forced to follow the pressure of
competition and survival to choose to lower the price, thus it may fall into a vicious
circle of price wars. The best response is for both competing parties to stabilize their
products at a suitable price through an unwritten agreement, and to move away from
price as a form of competition and toward quality, brand, and service [27].
(c) For the cost-sharing problem of establishing the information sharing platform, ac-
cording to the general accounting cost-sharing principle of “Who uses who bear, who
benefits who bear” [28], the retailer, as the supply chain leader, and the manufacturer
each bear half of the construction cost 1
2 CB, and the construction cost is shared be-
tween the manufacturers according to the number of first wholesale products. The
number of first wholesale products is related to the retailer’s initial preference for
the manufacturer, thus the blockchain construction costs for both manufacturers can
be expressed as 1
2 rCB and 1
2 (1 − r)CB. To ensure the security of key information
about the business, manufacturers only share order information, including price,
quantity, delivery and lead times, and retailers only share inventory information and
order requirements.
(d) The retailer determines the order quantity based on its own forecast of market de-
mand and is influenced by the manufacturer’s quality, price, and preference for the
manufacturer. In response to the problem of the accuracy of the market forecast,
the actual order quantity of the retailer fluctuates θ, when the forecast is accurate
θ 6= 0, indicating that the retailer increases the order quantity, and when the forecast is
inaccurate θ = 0, the retailer adopts a conservative strategy. In this case, the retailer’s
order quantity and the manufacturer’s wholesale quantity can be expressed as [29–31]:
D1 = r[T − εPrst0 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ] + δ(µ1 − µ2) (1)
D2 = (1− r)[T − εPrst0 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ] + δ(µ2 − µ1) (2)
DR = T − εPrst0 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ (3)
(e) The price consumers expect for a good is positively related to the quality of the
product and the calculation of social welfare is set as the sum of the surplus of sellers
and buyers in the market, excluding government taxes. See Table 1 for a detailed
description of the symbols.

4. Traditional Supply Chain Collaboration Model (N Model)
Retailers’ wholesale products of quality µ1 and µ2 from M1 and M2 at the wholesale
price of W1 and W2, respectively, and there is competition between M1 and M2 in terms of
both quality and price. The profits of the manufacturer and the retailer can be expressed as:

5. Blockchain Technology-Based Information Sharing Platform Model (B Model)
5.1. Blockchain Technology-Based Information Sharing Platform Model Phase 1 (B Model Phase 1)
Traditional supply chains suffer from silos of information and doubtful authenticity.
In order to obtain more transparent supply chain information, improve the efficiency of
the supply chain and reduce costs, the retailer-led supply chain considers establishing an
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 8 of 22
information sharing platform based on blockchain technology. Under this mechanism,
order information is shared among supply chain members, two independent manufac-
turers in collusion provide a uniform wholesale price as a temporary single entity and
cooperate with retailers. Therefore, the retailer wholesales products of quality µ1 and µ2
from manufacturers at the same wholesale price, and there is a competition between the
manufacturers only for quality. In the short term, wholesale volumes of lower quality
manufacturers are affected, then expressed as:
D1 = r[T − εPrst1 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ] + δ(µ1 − µ2) (13)
D2 = (1− r)[T − εPrst1 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ] + δ(µ2 − µ1) (14)
Therefore, the retailer’s sales function can be expressed as:
DR = T − εPrst1 + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ (15)
The profits of the manufacturers and the retailer R are then expressed as:

In order to simplify the transaction process between supply chain members and re-
duce transaction costs, the retailer-led supply chain considers building an information
sharing platform based on blockchain technology to unify wholesale prices. After consider-
ing the blockchain construction costs, the optimal wholesale volumes and prices for the
manufacturers and the maximum sale volumes and prices for the retailer are expressed as:

(23)
where ∆ = T + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ.
See Appendix A for proof.
5.2. Blockchain Technology-Based Information Sharing Platform Model Phase 2 (B Model Phase 2)
As there is competition between the manufacturers for quality only, consider that
sellers will prefer the better quality manufacturer and reduce the purchase of products
from the poorer quality manufacturer. Therefore, both manufacturers intend to gain a
larger market by improving quality, and the lower quality manufacturer will invest more in
improving quality in order not to be eliminated from the market. At this point, the retailer
wholesales products of the quality of (1 + λ1)µ1 and (1 + λ2)µ2 from M1 and M2 at the
same wholesale price.
In this case, the wholesale volumes of the two manufacturers and the maximum sale
volumes of the retailer are expressed as:
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 9 of 22
D1 = r[T − εPrst1 + η(r(1 + λ1)µ1 + (1− r)(1 + λ2)µ2) + θ] + δ((1 + λ1)µ1 − (1 + λ2)µ2) (24)
D2 = (1− r)[T − εPrst1 + η(r(1 + λ1)µ1 + (1− r)(1 + λ2)µ2) + θ] + δ((1 + λ2)µ2 − (1 + λ1)µ1) (25)
DR = T − εPrst1 + η(r(1 + λ1)µ1 + (1− r)(1 + λ2)µ2) + θ (26)
The profits of the manufacturer and the retailer are then expressed as:

After the two manufacturers have each improved the quality of their products, the

volumes and prices for the retailer are expressed as:
D1 = r

6. Consumer Surplus and Social Welfare
Consumer surplus U (shaded in Figure 3) is the difference between a consumer’s
desired price Pc for a given quantity of goods and the actual price Pr of goods. Although it
is not an increase in the consumer’s income, this positive psychological feeling can play an
important role in increasing consumer satisfaction and happiness.

Based on the conclusions in Section 4 we can obtain the total market demand and
the actual selling price of the commodity under the traditional supply chain information
collaboration model as Equations (9) and (12), respectively. In addition, to obtain a clearer
picture of the demand function, the total market demand can be expressed as a function of
the actual selling price in the market, as follows:

6.2. Consumer Surplus in the First Phase of Model B
At this stage, it is clear from the previous conclusions that the total market demand
and the market selling price are the same for the traditional model and the first stage of
the B model; therefore, their consumer surplus is the same. Following the conclusions
in Section 5.1, the consumer surplus at the time when the blockchain technology-based
information sharing platform is first established can be obtained, and the total market
demand at that stage can be expressed as:

R
= T + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ − εPrst1 (39)

6.3. Consumer Surplus in the Second Stage of Model B
In the second stage of Model B, the total market demand and the selling price change,
corresponding to a change in consumer surplus. The specific changes can be obtained
from the conclusions in Section 5.2, where Equations (47) and (49) provide the total market
demand expressed in terms of market selling prices, as follows:
DB2
R
= T + η[r(1 + λ1)µ1 + (1− r)(1 + λ2)µ2] + θ − εPrst2 (42)
Similarly to Section 6.1, the desired price for the consumer can be obtained as:
PB2
c =
T + η[r(1 + λ1)µ1 + (1− r)(1 + λ2)µ2] + θ
ε
(43)
The final consumer surplus that can be obtained for the second stage of Model B is
expressed as:

6.4. Representation of Social Welfare
Based on the above findings, calculations are made for different models and for
different stages of the same model to obtain a picture of changes in social welfare. Social
benefits under the traditional model are expressed as:

7. The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Supply Chain Pricing Decisions and Its
Value Analysis
Proposition 1. With the establishment of an information sharing platform, manufacturers’ order
volumes are affected, with higher and lower quality increasing and decreasing order volumes,
respectively. As retailers are quality-sensitive, manufacturers with better quality will receive more
orders and manufacturers with poorer quality will have fewer orders in the case of a flat price.
Proposition 2. With the establishment of an information sharing platform, the total market demand
will remain the same without any quality or promotional efforts by the manufacturer. This will all
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 12 of 22
change the wholesale volume due to the change in retailer preference for different manufacturers,
i.e., the change in order allocation between the two manufacturers.
Proposition 3. With the establishment of the information sharing platform, the retailer’s selling
price remains the same, but the new wholesale price will be lower than the better quality manufac-
turer’s wholesale price and higher than the poorer quality manufacturer’s wholesale price, i.e., the
new wholesale price lies between the original two wholesale prices.
Proposition 4. The establishment of an information sharing platform does not lead to an increase
in total retailer profits in the short term, but rather to a decrease in retailer profits. The reason is
that with information transparency, retailer will choose to wholesale products from higher quality
manufacturers at the same price, even though this indicates higher wholesale prices and costs, which
will also reduce their net profits. At the same time, with retailers’ quality preferences, the profits
of better quality manufacturers increase while those of poorer quality manufacturers decrease. The
reason is that retailers prefer better quality products, which results in more orders for higher quality
manufacturers.
Proposition 5. After the establishment of the information sharing platform, the demand of the
manufacturer M1 before and after the quality improvement is equal when λ1
λ2
= µ2
µ1
(1− ηr
ηr2+2δ
),
and the demand of the manufacturer M2 before and after the quality improvement is equal when
λ1
λ2
= µ2
µ1
2δ+η(1−r)2
2δ−ηr(1−r) . However, for total demand, the manufacturer’s quality improvement always
results in an increase in total market demand.
Proposition 6. When the level of competition among manufacturers is more intense, manufactur-
ers will choose to improve the quality of their own products, while wholesale prices and retailer
selling prices will increase slightly, with the magnitude of the increase being closely related to the
manufacturer’s quality improvement efforts.
Proposition 7. The profit profile of manufacturers is positively correlated with their quality and
effort, and the distribution of profits between manufacturers is significantly and positively correlated
with their effort. Although the initial quality of the manufacturer M1 may be higher than the
manufacturer M2, the profits of M2 may exceed those of M1 in the second stage after the quality
effort is exerted, thus turning the dominant position of M2 into a disadvantageous one. Since the
manufacturer’s quality effort is beneficial for the retailer, the retailer’s profits always increase.

Proposition 8. At the beginning of building an information sharing platform based on blockchain
technology, the consumer surplus of those who buy these products does not change since the costs
and risks associated with the establishment of the blockchain-based information sharing platform are
shared by the manufacturers; however, social welfare is lower than in the traditional model since
the seller’s profit is compromised by the increase in wholesale costs. When the quality improvement
effect of the producer kicks in, the product quality and retailer profits are simultaneously increased,
which leads to a simultaneous increase in consumer surplus and social welfare.
8. Numerical Analysis
The following example analyzes the demand and profitability of two manufacturers
and a retailer with or without a blockchain-based information sharing platform, and follows
the quality and price sensitive changes of consumers. When η= 1, ε = 2, the maximum
market size is assumed to be 500, let C1= 120, C2= 100, CB= 500, gr = tm= s = 1, t f = 10,
r = 0.6, λ1 = 0.2, λ2 = 0.4, σ = 10, θ = 5, µ1 and µ2 are 0.9 and 0.8, respectively.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 13 of 22
In Figure 4a, it can be seen that when the information sharing platform is first estab-
lished, the retailer will prefer to wholesale products from the better quality manufacturer
and the status gap between the two manufacturers intensifies. After a period of establish-
ment, the status gap between the manufacturers will narrow due to their quality efforts
and the total demand for that supply chain will expand, contributing to the increase in
supply chain revenue. In Figure 4b, it can be seen that the establishment of an information
sharing platform will have little impact on the retailer’s profit, but will cause the stronger
manufacturer to be stronger and the weaker manufacturer to be weaker. With fierce com-
petition and quality efforts, the weaker manufacturer will gradually regain its original
supply chain position and may grab the manufacturer’s dominant position over time. In
addition, there is a slight loss of profit for the retailer as the cost of quality improvement
for the manufacturer is passed on to the retailer, but this change is beneficial for both the
manufacturer and the entire supply chain.
Figure 4. Determining demand and profitability under price and quality sensitivity. (a) Demand
from supply chain members. (b) Profitability of supply chain members.
When the quality and price sensitivity of consumers are not fixed, it can be seen in
Figure 5a that the demand will not change for the whole supply chain with or without
the establishment of a blockchain-based information sharing platform. However, in the
long term, the establishment of the blockchain will provide competitive pressure to man-
ufacturers, which will promote manufacturers’ efforts to improve quality and eventually
increase the total demand. In Figure 5b, it can be seen that when consumer price sensitiv-
ity is negative and has a large value, manufacturer M1 will gain more demand without
information sharing, and when price is insensitive or positive, information sharing is the
dominant strategy and quality has less impact on demand. In Figure 5c, it can be seen
that for manufacturer M2, not sharing information is the dominant strategy only when
consumers are extremely price sensitive to the product; otherwise, information sharing is
the optimal strategy.
Figure 6a shows that when consumers are less influenced by price and quality
(e.g., durable goods), no information sharing can maximize supply chain profits, while
when price and quality are extremely sensitive and reversed, information sharing can
only contribute to maximizing supply chain profits. Figure 6b shows that for the stronger
manufacturer, information sharing is the preferred strategy in both the long and short
term, as long as consumers are price and quality sensitive. Figure 6c shows that for weaker
manufacturers, sharing information maximizes profits when consumers are less price and
quality sensitive; otherwise, choosing not to share information is the preferred strategy.

Figure 6. Profitability of different models under price and quality sensitivity. (a) Manufacturer 1’s
profit. (b) Retailers’ profits. (c) Manufacturer 2’s profit.
With regard to consumer surplus and social welfare, it can be seen in Figure 6a that
the establishment of a blockchain technology-based information sharing platform does
not lead to changes in sales prices and market demand for consumers, but only changes
the situation of members within the supply chain; therefore, consumer surplus is constant.
With the establishment of a blockchain technology-based information sharing platform,
the quality improvement resulting from the quality improvement effect will significantly
increase the maximum acceptable price for consumers and cause an increase in market
demand, ultimately enhancing consumer surplus. As can be seen in Figure 7b, in the
first stage of Model B, with no change in consumer surplus, social welfare is also lost due
to the reduction in retailer profits. However, in the second stage of Model B, consumer
surplus and retailer profits are simultaneously increased, resulting in a significant increase
in social welfare.

9. Discussion
In response to the increasing number of applications of blockchain technology in
the supply chain, especially the successful application of blockchain technology by large
benchmark companies, it has become a difficult decision for SMEs whether to follow the
benchmark companies to establish or participate in the construction of a supply chain
information sharing platform based on blockchain technology. On the basis of this back-
ground, this paper discusses the possibility and value of following benchmark companies
in terms of the short-term and long-term value of establishing a blockchain technology-
based information sharing platform, taking into account the price and quality sensitivity
of consumers. Moreover, it considers the changes in consumer surplus and social welfare
under different models from the perspective of consumers, in order to inform the decisions
of producers, sellers, consumers, and governments. The main findings can be presented in
the following ways:
In the short term: (1) The establishment of a blockchain-based information sharing
platform will change the volume of orders from the retailer to both manufacturers, widen-
ing the gap between the positions of manufacturers, resulting in the stronger being stronger
and the weaker being weaker. (2) Whether or not a blockchain-based information sharing
platform is established will have little impact on the total demand in the supply chain, but
will only change the power comparison and benefit distribution among manufacturers
within the supply chain. (3) After the establishment of a blockchain-based information
sharing platform, the new average price will be lower than the original wholesale price of
the higher quality manufacturer and higher than the wholesale price of the lower quality
manufacturer, i.e., somewhere in between. At the same time, as the retailer obtains more
products at higher wholesale prices from manufacturers with higher quality products,
the profits of the stronger manufacturers increase and the profits of the weaker manufac-
turers decrease significantly after the establishment of the blockchain technology-based
information sharing platform, while the profits of retailer will decrease.
In the long term: (1) The quality effort effect resulting from information transparency
after the establishment of a blockchain technology-based information sharing platform
will narrow the demand gap between manufacturers and have a significant increase to
the demand of the entire supply chain. (2) The establishment of a blockchain technology-
based information sharing platform will significantly improve the quality of supply chain
products, which will affect the profitability of retailers for a certain period of time, but
will be beneficial for all manufacturers and the profitability of the entire supply chain. In
addition, it will increase the profitability of retailers after a certain period of time.
From the perspective of consumers and society: (1) The establishment of a blockchain-
based information sharing platform or not has no impact on consumer surplus, as it
only leads to the distribution of benefits within the supply chain. However, the quality
improvement effect resulting from the blockchain-based information sharing platform can
promote manufacturers to improve product quality, thus indirectly increasing consumer
surplus. (2) In a two-tier supply chain dominated by retailers, the establishment of a
blockchain technology-based information sharing platform will have an adverse impact
on social welfare since it will affect the profits of retailers without increasing consumer
surplus. However, in the long term, the establishment of a blockchain technology-based
information sharing platform will improve the profits of retailers and consumer surplus,
which will greatly improve the total social welfare and has certain social significance and
value.
Based on the findings in this paper, the following insights can be drawn for supply
chain members and government decision-making.
For manufacturers.
When its own strength is stronger than its competitors and consumers are more
sensitive to the price and quality of products, it is advantageous to establish a blockchain-
based information sharing platform. Although it may affect the wholesale volume in the
short term, it is more profitable than other models in the long term. When its own strength
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 16 of 22
is weaker than its competitors and consumers are relatively less sensitive to price and
quality, it is advantageous to choose to establish a blockchain-based information sharing
platform. Meanwhile, when consumers are more price and quality sensitive, it is a better
decision not to share information.
For retailers.
The establishment of an information sharing platform based on blockchain technology
can significantly increase the total market demand and is a better decision. With consumers’
sensitivity to both price and quality, the total market demand and their own profits will be
adversely affected in the short term, but beneficial in the long term.
For the supply chain.
The only optimal model is not to establish an information sharing platform based on
blockchain technology when consumers are insensitive to both price and quality. Otherwise,
after a short period of time, supply chain members will experience a significant increase in
market demand and profit from the quality effort effect resulting from information sharing.
For consumers and governments.
The establishment of a blockchain technology-based information sharing platform by
a consortium of producers and sellers can significantly improve the quality of products
with a slight increase in price; therefore, it is beneficial for consumers within an acceptable
range of price changes. Moreover, the establishment of a blockchain technology-based
information sharing platform by supply chain members can be beneficial for both sellers
and consumers, and can significantly increase social welfare. Therefore, the government
can provide sellers with certain policy tilts, such as subsidies and tax incentives, to promote
the development of the industry.
10. Conclusions
Through mathematical analysis and validation of whether companies in a two-tier
supply chain should establish an information sharing platform based on blockchain tech-
nology, we have identified the benefits and challenges for companies to apply blockchain
technology, and validated them in the blockchain technology-based food supply chain
established by Walmart.
10.1. Cost Reduction
In addition to the costs of raw materials and sales, there are costs associated with
ancillary services, such as inventory, research and development, fulfillment and transaction
costs. Through the analysis of this paper, it is found that when enterprises establish an
information sharing platform based on blockchain technology, the resulting real-time
sharing of inventory information can allow for the execution of a small batch and high
frequency replenishment plan by retailers as well as a replenishment of inventory in a timely
manner, thus effectively reducing inventory occupancy and inventory costs. Moreover,
smart contracts based on blockchain technology can help in the establishment of conditional
and automatic execution contracts by manufacturers and retailers, which are extremely
effective in the execution of replenishment and ordering plans of enterprises, as they can
automatically send order requests to higher-level suppliers when the enterprise’s product
or material inventory falls below a certain threshold, thus avoiding out-of-stock problems
caused by untimely orders and avoiding the out-of-stock costs while reducing transaction
costs. Finally, the communication between enterprises is not timely, the information
exchange is not smooth nor is the information true, which often provides higher fulfillment
and communication costs for enterprises, and even causes enterprises to suffer great loss
due to false information. This ensures the authenticity and timeliness of information
transmission, reduces communication costs, and avoids unnecessary losses.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 17 of 22
10.2. Efficiency Improvement
In the transmission of logistics, capital flow, and information flow between supply
chain enterprises, information flow is the key to coordinating inter-enterprise communica-
tion and cooperation and improving operational efficiency. In inter-enterprise communica-
tion, enterprises often miss business opportunities or experience delays in strategy imple-
mentation due to untimely communication or delayed information feedback. Blockchain
technology helps in the establishment of 24/7 information sharing platform by companies,
enabling real-time information sharing between manufacturers and retailers, which can
significantly reduce barriers to inter-company communication and improve the efficiency
of communication and strategy execution. Smart contract technology can automate a
significant amount of the work, reducing errors and delays caused by manual execution,
and reducing the need for requests, approvals, and feedback; therefore, improving the
efficiency of business operations.
10.3. Increase the Stickiness of Cooperation
Despite the fact that companies can establish cooperative relationships with each other
and that cooperation can significantly increase the benefits of their members, the nature
of competition between companies can still influence the deepening of partnerships. On
the one hand, enterprises need to share part of their information and resources to maintain
the partnership. On the other hand, they may choose to conceal some information or pass
on false information to gain an advantageous position and more bargaining chips in the
cooperation; therefore, there is a mutual game relationship. One of the main features of
blockchain technology is that it helps in the establishment of a consensus among multiple
parties by means of a super ledger, while the setting of timestamps enables the tracing of
information, thus ensuring the authenticity of the information passed between enterprises.
Authentic information can significantly enhance trust between companies, thus helping
them in building closer relationships. In addition, real-time information sharing can
reduce the information silo effect caused by incomplete information transmission between
enterprises and promote communication and contact between enterprises, thus increasing
the stickiness between enterprises and facilitating the establishment of closer partnerships.
10.4. Walmart Food Supply Chain and Blockchain
In the food supply chain, there have been many food safety issues due to mismanage-
ment or excessive pursuit of profit, such as the European food labeling fraud in 2013 [32]
and the contaminated egg scandal in EU countries [33], making food quality and safety a
major concern for consumers. As a result, traceability of the origin and production process
of food products has become the most pressing requirement of the food supply chain.
Food distribution is one of Walmart’s leading businesses and in the context of the growing
Chinese market, Walmart and IBM have joined forces with Chinese online retail giant
Jingdong to establish a blockchain-based food safety alliance to ensure food safety and
transportation tracking, which includes two pilot projects, Pork Safety in China and Mango
Safety in the US.
In both pilots, Walmart, as the leading food supply chain player, requires its upstream
pork or mango suppliers to set up data collection systems, including electronic data tags
and RFID, to match the blockchain information sharing platform. As the initiator and
leader of the blockchain platform, Walmart will bear the majority of the construction costs,
while its upstream suppliers will bear the infrastructure upgrade costs.
In the short term, Walmart has found that the costs it invests in the blockchain are
greater than the benefits of the blockchain, which indicates that Walmart will have to bear
significant upfront construction costs and a longer payback period. For Walmart’s pork or
mango suppliers, until the positive market effects of improved food safety and quality result
from the blockchain, there will be no significant change in the supplier market demand,
but only a change in supply due to a change in Walmart’s attitude toward suppliers. This
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16060 18 of 22
will be influenced by whether or not the pork or mango suppliers are willing to cooperate
with Walmart in building the blockchain platform.
When the food safety and quality improvements resulting from the blockchain tech-
nology are perceived and accepted by consumers, the demand for pork and mangoes at
Walmart will be significantly increased, which will not only provide positive benefits and
reputation enhancement to Walmart, but also a significant profit increase to the upstream
pork or mango suppliers of Walmart. In terms of consumers and society, the improvement
in food quality and safety will also provide consumers with greater peace of mind and
positive psychological perceptions of food consumption, reducing the negative social im-
pact of food safety issues, which will have a significant impact on consumer surplus and
social welfare. Therefore, for Walmart, the best strategy is to build a blockchain information
platform to gain long-term benefits and build consumer trust. For suppliers, the additional
short-term investment can provide long-term profits; therefore, it is the best choice to
participate in the joint construction of a blockchain information platform if they can afford
the short-term cost increase.
This article discusses the issue of whether enterprises should establish blockchain-
based information sharing platforms in the context of the establishment of information
sharing platforms based on blockchain technology by benchmarking enterprises, and the
changes in social welfare from the perspectives of supply chain and society, respectively.
Moreover, the paper uses Walmart’s blockchain-based food supply chain to validate the
findings of the article, which can provide some reference for the formulation and imple-
mentation of corporate strategies, as well as government decisions. However, this paper
only considers the game situation of the two-level supply chain, and does not take into
account the incentive policies already implemented by the government to analyze the
specific impact of government subsidies on the decision making of supply chain members.

Considering that the wholesale prices of manufacturers M1 and M2 should satisfy the
maximum total profit of the manufacturers, the specific profit distribution between the
two manufacturers is determined according to their wholesale volume and cost control.
Therefore, the total profit of manufacturers M1 and M2 is derived to obtain the wholesale
prices under this stage, as follows:

The proof of Model B Phase 2 is the same as above, which is omitted here. �
Proof of Proposition 1. From DB1
1 − DN
1 = 3δ(µ1−µ2)
4 + εr
4 (1− r)(C1 − C2) > 0,DB1
1 > DN
1 .
Similarly, from DB1
2 − DN
2 = 3δ(µ2−µ1)
4 + ε(1−r)
4 r(C2 − C1) < 0, DB1
2 < DN
2 ; therefore, the
theorem is proved. �
Proof of Proposition 2. From the above conclusion, it follows that DB1
R = DN
R = 1
4 [∆−
ε(rC1 + (1− r)C2 + tm + gr + 2s)], where ∆ = T + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ; therefore, the
theorem is proved. �
Proof of Proposition 3. From the above conclusion, it follows that Prst0 = Prst1
= gr+2s+tm+rC1+(1−r)C2
4 + 3∆
4ε , where ∆ = T + η(rµ1 + (1 − r)µ2) + θ, W − W1
= (1−r)(C2−C1)
2 − δ(µ1−µ2)
2εr < 0, W −W2 = r(C1−C2)
2 + δ(µ1−µ2)
2ε(1−r) > 0; therefore, the theo-
rem is proved. �
Proof of Proposition 4. From ΠB1

M1

(1−r)(C1−C2)

facturers with better quality M1 experienced an increase in profits compared to before
and after the information sharing platform was established, as shown by ΠB1
M2

M2

r(C1−C2)
2 Γ4 < 0. Manufacturers with lower quality M2 experienced a de-
crease in profits after the information sharing, as shown by ΠB1

2εr −
(1−r)(C2−C1)
2 )− D2(− r(C1−C2)
2 − δ(µ1−µ2)
2ε(1−r) ) < 0. Retailers’ profits experienced a decrease
in total profits after the information sharing platform was established, despite an overall
increase in the quality of products purchased, as follows:

∆ = T + η(rµ1 + (1− r)µ2) + θ

Proof of Proposition 5. Let H1 = DB2
1 −DB1
1 , the calculation yields H1 = ( ηr2
2 + δ)(λ1µ1 −
λ2µ2) +
ηr
2 λ2µ2, when λ1
λ2
= µ2
µ1
(1 − ηr
ηr2+2δ
), H1 = 0. The same reasoning leads to
H2 = (δ − ηr(1−r)
2 )(λ2µ2 − λ1µ1) +
ηr(1−r)
2 λ2µ2, when λ1
λ2
= µ2
µ1
2δ+η(1−r)2
2δ−ηr(1−r) , H2 = 0, let
H3 = DB2
R − DB1
R , H3 = η
2 [rλ1µ1 + (1− r)λ2µ2]; therefore, it will always be greater than 0
and the theorem is proved. �

Proof of Proposition 6. WB2 − WB1 = ηΓ
2ε > 0, Prst2 − Prst1 = 3ηΓ
4 > 0, where
Γ = rλ1µ1 + (1− r)λ2µ2; therefore, the theorem is proved. �
Proof of Proposition 7. For ΠB2
M1
= ΠB1
M1
to hold, both DB2
1 = DB1
1 , WB2 = WB1 , and
1
2 rCB +
µ2

2 −
(1+λ1)
2µ2

2 = 0 are required. When µ2
1 = rCB
λ1(λ1+1) and δ = 0, the above
conditions are met. Similarly, ΠB2
M2
= ΠB1
M2
can be obtained when µ2
1 = (1−r)CB
λ2(λ2+2) and δ = 0.
For ΠB2
R −ΠB1
R = (DB2
R − DB1
R )(Pr − gr − s−W) + DB1
R
µ
µ [rλ1µ1 + (1− r)λ2µ2], since
DB2
R − DB1
R > 0 and Pr > gr + s + W; therefore, ΠB2
R −ΠB1
R is always greater than 0 and the
theorem is proved. �
Proof of Proposition 8. Propositions 3 and 4 show that the selling price at the beginning
of the blockchain does not change and that consumer surplus does not change, as shown
by UB1 −UN = 0, while social welfare decreases without an increase in consumer surplus
due to some loss of profit for the retailer.
Let UB = UB2 −UB1 , UB = η[λ1µ1+(1−r)λ2µ2]
4 > 0. Despite the increase in the market
price of the product, consumer surplus is increased at that stage since consumers receive
a higher quality product as a result of the quality improvement effect. Moreover, from
Proposition 7, it is clear that retailers’ profits always increase; therefore, social welfare
always increases in the second stage of building a blockchain technology-based information
sharing platform and the theorem is proved. �
