Abstract
E-commerce supply chains and their members face risks from cyber-attacks. Con-
sumers who purchase goods online also risk having their private information stolen.
Thus, businesses are investing to improve cyber-security at a nontrivial cost. In this
paper, we conduct a Stackelberg game-theoretical analysis. In the basic model, we first
derive the equilibrium pricing and cyber-security level decisions in the e-commerce
supply chain. Based on real-world practices, we then explore whether governments
should impose cyber-security penalty schemes. Our findings show that when the gov-
ernment is characterized by having sufficiently high emphasis on consumer surplus,
implementing the penalty scheme is beneficial to social welfare. Then, we extend the
analysis to examine how adopting systems security enhancing technologies (such as
blockchain) will affect the government’s choice of imposing penalty. We uncover that
when it is beneficial to have government’s penalty scheme, the technology benefit-to-
cost ratio is a critical factor that governs whether the optimal penalty will be lower or
higher with the adoption of systems security enhancing technologies. To generate more
insights, we conduct further analyses for various extended modeling cases (e.g., with
alliance, competition, and the defense-level dependent penalty scheme) and find that
our main results remain robust. One important insight we have uncovered in this study
is that imposing government penalty schemes on cyber-security issues may do more
harm than good; while once it is beneficial to implement, the government should charge
the heaviest possible fine. This finding may explain why in the real world, governments
basically always adopt a polarized strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty or
impose a super heavy penalty, on cyber-security issues.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cyber-security issues are becoming a daily challenge for
businesses worldwide and must be addressed in e-commerce
supply chains. The number of cyber-attacks has grown
steadily during the last few years. According to Kaspersky
Lab, a cyber-attack was launched every 40 seconds in 20161
and the rate of phishing attacks in 2018 was almost dou-
bled compared to 2017.2 Cyber-attacks may take the form of
impersonation, fraudulent banking data use, blackmail, ran-
dom demands, and power cuts, and their effects range from
the theft of individuals’ personal information to the theft of

confidential industrial product data. For example, in October
2013, the personal information of 2.9 million account holders
(logins, passwords, names, and credit card numbers and expi-
ration dates) was stolen from the software company Adobe.
Both e-commerce platforms and governments treat cyber-
attacks very seriously, as they can compromise users’ privacy
and may be disastrous for the companies involved. To enjoy
the convenience of shopping online, consumers typically
need to submit their private information. This exposes their
information to serious threats. A security breach of the giant
U.S. retailer Target Corporation in December 2013, for exam-
ple, exposed the personal data of over 110 million consumers,
leading to a nearly 50% drop in profits. In January 2014, data
from 100 million South Korean credit cards were stolen. As

a result, more than 2 million South Koreans had their cards
blocked or replaced, as they feared that their bank accounts
would be emptied. In 2016, 3 billion Yahoo accounts were
hacked, and in 2018, Under Armor reported that its “MyFit-
nessPal” service had been hacked, affecting 150 million
users. Consumers’ perceptions of information security can
affect their online purchase behavior and can lead to busi-
ness losses, including an abnormally high turnover of cus-
tomers and increased customer acquisition activities (Wu
et al., 2018). For example, when Sony’s PlayStation Network
was attacked in April 2011, the personal data of 77 million
users were leaked and the banking information of tens of
thousands of players was compromised. To appease users,
Sony paid out US$15 million in compensation, plus a few
million dollars in legal fees, as well as refunding the people
whose bank accounts had been illegally used. Cyber-security
issues are undoubtedly a daily challenge for e-businesses.
To prevent consumer information from being stolen, e-
commerce companies are obligated to implement the right
technologies at a nontrivial cost. In fact, worldwide spending
on information security products and services exceeded
US$114 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 12.4%
from US$101.54 billion in 2017, according to Gartner, a
leading research firm. Gartner also predicted that end-user
spending for the information security and risk management
market will grow at a “compound annual growth rate” of
8.7% from 2018 through 2023 to reach $188.4 billion.3 In
addition to e-commerce companies’ cyber-security measures,
governments all around the world take different measures
for cyber-security-related challenges. In 2019, the U.K. gov-
ernment invested £100 million in new cyber-security R&D
and launched a fund to drive diversity across the industry.
Chinese legislators passed an e-commerce law to improve
online regulation and protect consumer privacy, which took
effect on January 1, 2019, and stated that platforms have the
responsibility to protect the security of personal information
held by e-commerce platforms. Platform operators would
face a penalty of 500,000 yuan (i.e., US$73,260) if they fail
to take necessary steps, or up to 2 million yuan in serious
cases. On February 28, 2019, Thailand passed its Cyber-
security Act, and legislators in Europe also unanimously
passed the Personal Data Protection Act, based on the Euro-
pean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
In 2016, the Australian government rolled out its Cyber
Security Strategy, which included investments of more than
US$230 million across “five areas of action” up until 2020.
Some U.S. state governments also implemented regulations
to ensure the security of online shopping environments. The
four main data oversight categories addressed in this legisla-
tion are breach notifications, data security, data disposal, and
the privacy of nonpersonally identifiable information. The
Department of Justice of the U.S. government announced
in April 2015 its “Best Practices for Victim Response and
Reporting of Cyber Incidents,” which supplements its cyber-
security regulations.4 However, not every state in the United
States has imposed the penalty rule for cyber-security issues.
For example, California recently passed the SB-317 Bill,

which imposes penalties for noncompliance, but New York
has no such restriction (see Table 1). Why this is the case
and whether the government should play a more central
regulatory role in cyber-security should be examined further.
Moreover, as shown in Table A1, in all the real-world cases
that we have found, governments basically always adopt
a polarized strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty
or impose a super heavy penalty, on cyber-security issues.
Whether there is a scientific explanation for the existence of
this type of polarized strategy deserves deeper investigation.
Motivated by the importance of cyber-security for e-
commerce supply chains and the different associated govern-
ment practices, we explore the following research questions
in this paper. (1) In terms of e-tailer’s cyber-security
investments, what are the optimal retail pricing, level of
cyber-security, and wholesale pricing decisions in the supply
chain, with and without government penalty schemes? (2)
How does the presence of a government cyber-security
penalty scheme affect the supply chain (and its members),
consumers, and social welfare? Are there any cases in which
having government’s penalty scheme does more harm than
good? If it is beneficial to implement the penalty scheme, is it
wise for the government to impose a very heavy penalty? (3)
What are the impacts brought by the e-tailer’s deployment
of technologies (such as blockchain) on our findings? How
robust are the findings? To address the above research ques-
tions, we formally build a consumer utility-based stylized
analytical model and conduct a Stackelberg game-theoretic
analysis. We also include extended modeling analyses to
show robustness of the findings. Table A2 shows features
of cyber-security for e-commerce platforms as well as how
they are being considered and modeled in this paper to
address the research issues. We argue that the models and
analyses conducted in this paper are specific to the domain
on cyber-security and hence the derived insights are relevant
and applicable to e-commerce supply chains.
To the best of our knowledge, our paper is one of the
first analytical operations management (OM) studies that
explore cyber-risk in e-commerce supply chains with the

considerations of government cyber-security penalty policies
and other associated issues (such as the use of technologies).
Cyber-attacks in e-commerce supply chains are a serious
real-world problem. Our findings give important guidance
for policy makers on how to enhance cyber-security and may
explain why in the real world, governments basically always
adopt a polarized strategy on cyber-security issues.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 describes the
basic analytical models for the e-commerce supply chains
without government intervention (Model NG) and with a
government cyber-security penalty scheme (Model G). In
Section 4, the two models are compared and the values
of government cyber-security penalty schemes (VGCPs)
are examined. Section 5 provides extended analyses, and
Section 6 concludes the study. All proofs as well as some
extended modeling analyses and supplementary results are
provided in the Supporting Information.
2 RELATED LITERATURE
The problems examined in this study are related to research
on e-commerce, cyber-security, and the role of government in
OM.
OM has entered the digital era. The advancement of e-
commerce has led to extensive research on ways of opti-
mizing e-commerce supply chains (Cai, 2010; Lim & Srai,
2018; Scholz et al., 2017; Tsay & Agrawal, 2004; Wu et al.,
2015; Zhang & Choi, 2021). Earlier studies have explored
how consumer behaviors affect e-tailing operations (e.g., Car-
rillo et al., 2014). In recent years, the operations of online
platforms are widely explored, as they support e-commerce
(e.g., Hao & Fan, 2014; Kuruzovich & Etzion, 2018). For
instance, Niu et al. (2019) model the incentives of competing
e-commerce firms for logistics cooperation. They find that if
“Firm A” forms a logistics sharing alliance with “Firm B,”
then “Firm B” can guarantee customers a promised deliv-
ery time (PDT). Wang et al. (2019) conduct a Stackelberg
game analysis of electronic business platform financing. The
authors empirically examine the effect of offline call inten-
sity on the probability of online consumers’ purchasing digi-
tal services, and the “carryover effect of call intensity.” Zhang
and Yao (2020) study a similar problem and consider simi-
lar effects. Shen et al. (2019) focus on exploring the prob-
lem of a manufacturer’s optimal channel selection between a
platform retailer and a traditional reseller. Yan et al. (2019)
examine whether a marketplace platform should be intro-
duced to e-commerce. The role of using online platforms in
e-commerce supply chain strategies has also been examined
(Abhishek et al., 2016; Hagiu & Wright, 2015; Kwark et al.,
2017; Liang et al., 2020; Tan & Carrillo, 2017). In particular,
Tian et al. (2018) conduct a study of e-commerce platform
operations to investigate the role of e-tailers, and find that
the interaction between order-fulfillment costs and upstream
competition intensity moderates the e-tailer’s selection of an
optimal mode. In this study, we also address the e-commerce
operations problem and the e-tailer in our paper can be an
e-platform (such as Amazon.com and JD.com), but we focus
on tackling the cyber-security challenge. Unlike other studies,
we also examine the government’s role in the cyber-security
of e-commerce supply chains.
Cyber-security problems are known to be important in the
OM literature (Bier & Gutfraind, 2019; Choi et al., 2018;
Paul & Zhang, 2021) but not yet well-explored analytically.
For instance, Guha and Kumar (2018) indicate that data
and cyber-security are future research directions in the fields
of OM and information systems. As Tang and Whinston
(2020) argue, security negligence is a major cause of data
breaches and can occur if a firm’s information technology
managers cannot adequately address security vulnerabilities.
Cohen (2018) notes that the availability of sensitive personal
data can attract hackers and lead to serious cyber-security
problems, including “information leakage, fraud, and iden-
tity theft.” The information privacy issue in e-commerce plat-
forms is non-trivial, as it may affect consumers’ confidence in
e-platforms and ultimately reduce profits.
In the context of analytical OM studies, Nagurney and
Shukla (2017) claim that firms and governments are sharing
threat information to arrange coordinated defenses against
attacks. The authors argue that governments and policy-
makers are pushing firms to exchange information in the
cyber space as a possible defensive mechanism. Wu et al.
(2018) explore a firm’s information security decisions using
game theory. The authors highlight that competition plays
a critical role in affecting the optimal security decisions.
Khouzani et al. (2019) present a framework to efficiently
solve a multi-objective optimization problem for cyber-
security defense. Cheung and Bell (2019) present a novel
“attacker-defender” model against a “quantal response adver-
sary” to protect critical assets. Eling and Wirfs (2019) con-
duct an analysis of over 1500 cyber risk incidents extracted
from an operational risk dataset. They note that cyber-risk is
a special risk category that warrants more research, and their
results can help insurance companies with limited data and
experience of cyber-risks to develop cyber insurance poli-
cies. More recently, Simon and Omar (2020) investigate the
cyber-security investment with the consideration of coordina-
tion and strategic attacker. Following this stream of literature,
this paper assumes that the related information in the sup-
ply chain is public. This paper supplements the OM literature
on cyber-security analyses. We focus on e-commerce supply
chains and analytically study the optimal cyber-security level
and the roles played by the government.
Governments can affect supply chain operations through
various means. For example, Arya and Mittendorf (2015)
note that governments have increasingly attempted to direct
business behavior to achieve specific socially desirable out-
comes. Hua et al. (2016) study competition and coordination
in two-tier public service systems under government fiscal
policies. The authors claim that a relatively low tax-subsidy
rate can almost perfectly coordinate the two public service
providers to achieve almost the maximum possible benefits
from the two-tier service system. Berenguer et al. (2017)

investigate the effects of subsidies on increasing consump-
tion through for-profit and not-for-profit newsvendors. They
show that subsidy programs provide stronger incentives for
not-for-profit than for-profit firms to increase consumption.
Xiao and Xu (2018) find that it is wise for the retailer to
adopt a lost-sale penalty contract, which can incentivize the
seller to install the right level of capacity and extract the full
surplus. Zhang and Zhang (2018) examine the interactions
between customer purchasing behaviors and trade-in reman-
ufacturing. They uncover how a social planner (such as the
government) should design a public policy to maximize social
welfare. Xu et al. (2018) conduct a study of the impacts of
markets and tax on transnational corporations’ procurement
strategies. They highlight the significance of a company’s
global supply chain management decisions while taking inter-
national taxation rules into consideration. Yu et al. (2018)
investigate government subsidy programs and find that gov-
ernments can improve consumer welfare by developing sub-
sidy programs that involve multiple (competing) manufactur-
ers with different market sizes and adequate capacities. More
recently, Hsu et al. (2019) find that a quality subsidy offered
by the government to farmers can decrease the quality of their
dairy products and their profits. Similar to the above stud-
ies, we also explore the role played by governments in busi-
ness operations. However, different from them, we focus on
exploring whether governments should play a role on cyber-
security, which is motivated by real-world observed practices.
In the digital era (Choi et al., 2018; Swaminathan, 2018),
cyber-security threats are being a priority for global business
operations. Many researchers investigate how to use systems
security enhancing technologies (such as blockchain) to fight
against cyber-attacks and improve operations. Doroudi et al.
(2021) explore how to mitigate the performance drop and
data breaching problems under cyber-attacks by using tech-
nologies. Cheung and Bell (2021) propose that the real-time
recovery technology is crucial in managing real-time cyber-
attacks. The authors propose how to improve connectivity of
cyber networks. Ji et al. (2016) discuss how big data analysis
and optimization tools can be used to tackle advanced cyber-
attacks. Bensoussan et al. (2020) reveal that intrusion pre-
vention is a crucial point for overcoming cyber-security risk.
The authors explore how to guarantee the information sys-
tem’s security from the perspective of maintenance practice
related to an “intrusion detection system.” They mention that
companies should continuously employ and update the rele-
vant technologies to be “sustainable” against cyber-attacks.
Cohen and Lee (2020) uncover that technologies including
robotic automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet-
of-Things (IoT) applications can help improve the design of
worldwide business networks. They claim that the incom-
plete integration of networks leads to cyber-security prob-
lems. Olsen and Tomlin (2020) discuss the practical values of
the technologies for business operations in the Industry 4.0
era. The authors point out that blockchain is a possible solu-
tion for dealing with the data security challenges. Cui et al.
(2021) explore how to make use of technologies such as AI
to improve the performance of supply chains. To enhance
systems security as well as many business operations, the
blockchain technology is commonly known to be useful. In
fact, blockchain can be viewed as a distributed ledger that
can provide a secure data platform to enhance transparency
and tractability of data. In the OM literature, Babich and
Hilary (2019) discuss how blockchain can be employed to
face cyber incidents and safety issues. The authors share
their visions on the field, including many proposals for future
research. Choi and Luo (2019) discuss the data quality chal-
lenges for sustainable operations in emerging economies.
The authors investigate how blockchain may help to enhance
operations by dampening data quality-related problems. Choi
et al. (2020) examine the service pricing problems in on-
demand-service-platform operations. The authors uncover
how blockchain can be used to improve service operations by
considering the risk sensitivity of customers. Cai et al. (2021)
analytically explore how blockchain can help to address the
cheating problems in the use of markdown contract in a sup-
ply chain with a rental platform. Luo and Choi (2021) conduct
a review related to AI and blockchain. They highlight that the
integration of these two critical disruptive technologies can
help improve cyber-security. Choi and Shi (2021) explore the
use of blockchain for ride-hailing operations under COVID-
19. For more details of using blockchain in supply chain sys-
tems, refer to Hastig and Sodhi (2020) and Choi et al. (2021).
Note that even though it is known that using the systems
security enhancing technology such as blockchain is help-
ful to deal with challenges in cyber-security, to the best of
our knowledge, no prior studies in OM have ever analytically
examined this issue. This paper bridges this gap.
3 BASIC MODELS
3.1 Model NG: Without a government
penalty scheme
Cyber-attacks potentially affect all members of e-commerce
supply chains in an online market. When consumers make
purchases online, their private information, including their
names, addresses, purchasing records, telephone numbers,
credit card numbers, etc., may be at risk of being stolen.
Thus, both supply chains and consumers are affected. To
enhance readability, the definitions of different models and
some important variables are described in Table 2. For other
notations, refer to Supporting Information A5.
In our study, we consider an e-commerce supply chain with
a supplier and an e-tailer, as shown in Figure 1. The likelihood
that e-commerce supply chains suffer cyber-attacks is 𝛾.5 Fol-
lowing Nagurney and Shukla (2017) and Simon and Omar
(2020), we explore the case in which the e-tailers and con-
sumers have a perception of the probability of cyber-attack.
Both of them form “rational expectations” regarding the like-
lihood that e-commerce supply chains suffer cyber-attacks.
Intuitively, consumers perceive their personal information

being exposed and other risks associated with cyber-attacks
as negative. Their sensitivity to the level of cyber-security risk
is denoted by the coefficient a. To protect the online shopping
environment, companies implement measures to increase the
level of cyber-security. In terms of the e-tailer’s attempts to
defend against cyber-attack, β represents the rate of success
in detecting the attack,6 and (1 − 𝛽) represents the likelihood
of failure. Thus, following Nagurney and Shukla (2017), we
call the likelihood of “having trouble” (i.e., being attacked
and failing to successfully defend against it) when the e-tailer
operates online the level of cyber-security risk (𝛼), which is
defined as 𝛾(1 − 𝛽). Note that 𝛾𝛽 represents the level of suc-
cessful defense from cyber-attack. In this paper, we assume
that α and β are common knowledge to the supplier and
e-tailer. First, we assume that the e-tailer can communicate
the information of cyber-security with the supplier. Previous
studies (e.g., Li 2002, Ha & Tian, 2017; Zhang & Zhang,
2020) have adopted the same assumption that information
sharing between the e-tailer and supplier is common. This
is also in line with what the U.S. government is advocating
now with the information sharing among private companies
on cyber-attacks.7 Second, for α (level of cyber-security risk),
it relates to the cyber-attack cases. From news, consumers
will have the experience and feeling regarding it because
major cyber-attack cases cannot be hidden. So, we argue that
these kinds of data are publicly available, and there are lots
of cyber-attack news for companies such as JD and Amazon.
For β (the rate of success in detecting cyber-attacks), it can be
judged according to the technology adopted by the platform.
Third, from history and experience, and for the analysis pur-
pose, this paper assumes that the level of cyber-security risk
and the rate of success in detecting cyber-attacks are publicly
known. In other words, in this paper, we consider the symme-
try of information and postpone the asymmetry case to future
research.
We consider a case in which consumers have a hetero-
geneous valuation, u, of the product, in which u follows a
distribution f (⋅). Following the literature and for analytical
tractability, we consider a case in which f (u) is a uniform
distribution with a lower bound of 0 and upper bound of 1,
denoted by U[0, 1].8 In addition, to focus on our main areas
of exploration and to simplify the notation, we normalize
the market population as 1. E-tailers implement measures to
increase their cyber-security, and these measures incur a non-
trivial cost. As 𝛽 also denotes the e-tailer’s level of defense
effort, when an e-tailer exerts an effort 𝛽, a defense effort
cost KDE(𝛽) is incurred, which is given by k𝛽2∕2, where
k > 0. Note that k can be treated as the cost coefficient of
defense. A higher cyber-security improvement requires more
complicated configuration and better functionality of the soft-
ware system. This leads to a higher level of systems com-
plexity, and the cost becomes much higher when the desir-
able level of cyber-security is higher. It is therefore reason-
able to apply a quadratic cost structure, which reflects the
fact that the marginal defense cost increases for achieving a
higher cyber-security level (Kim et al., 2011). What is more,
the quadratic cost structure is in line with the extant litera-
ture as follows. Shetty et al. (2010) claim that the defense
effort costs should increase with the security level. As in
Nagurney and Shukla (2017), to reach a security level 𝛽,
the e-tailer invests KDE(𝛽) with the function assumed to
be continuously differentiable and convex. Similar to Kim
et al. (2011), Nagurney and Shukla (2017), and Yang et al.
(2021), we consider the defense effort cost KDE(𝛽) given by
k𝛽2∕2 as a convex function of 𝛽, indicating that K′
DE(𝛽) >
0 and K
′′
DE(𝛽) > 0; namely, the cost increases as the rate
of success in detecting the attack increases at a growing
rate.

F I G U R E 2 Sequence of events for Model NG
When consumers decide whether to shop on an e-tailer
platform, they will consider factors such as (i) the product’s
selling price from e-tailer p; (ii) the level of security regard-
ing their private information, which can be interpreted by the
cyber-security risk level of the platform, which is equal to
𝛾(1 − 𝛽), where 𝛾 and 𝛽 represent the likelihood of being
attacked and the success rate of detecting the attack, respec-
tively; and (iii) consumer sensitivity to the level of cyber-
security risk, which we denote by a. Thus, we can derive the
number of consumers who will buy the product at a price p
and with effort level 𝛽. Noting that consumers choose to use
the platform when their valuation u is greater than or equal to
p + a𝛾(1 − 𝛽), the demand function is given as follows:
D(NG) =
1
∫
p+a𝛼
f (u)𝕕u = 1
(
1 −
(
p(NG) + a𝛾
(
1 − 𝛽(NG)
)))
= 1 − e + e𝛽(NG) − p(NG), where e = a𝛾. (1)
Observe that we use the subscript (NG) to represent the func-
tions and optimal decisions under Model NG.
As shown in Figure 1, the unit product cost for the supplier
under Model NG is m. The product is provided by the sup-
plier to the e-tailer at a unit wholesale price of w. We build a
consumer utility-based stylized analytical model to conduct a
Stackelberg game-theoretical analysis. In our model, the sup-
plier determines the wholesale price as the leader and the e-
tailer controls p and 𝛽 simultaneously as the follower. The
sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 2.
Thus, the profit functions of supplier (S) and e-tailer (E)
are given as follows:
𝜋S(NG) =
(
w(NG) − m(NG)
)
D(NG)
=
(
w(NG) − m(NG)
) (
1 − e + e𝛽(NG) − p(NG)
)
, (2)
𝜋E(NG) =
(
p(NG) − w(NG)
)
D − KDE
(
𝛽(NG)
)
=
(
p(NG) − w(NG)
) (
1 − e + e𝛽(NG) − p(NG)
)
− k𝛽2
(NG)∕2. (3)
We solve this game by backward induction. By checking
the Hessian matrix, we find that 𝜋E(NG) is jointly concave in
p(NG) and 𝛽(NG),when k > e2∕2. In this paper, we consider the
case with k > e2∕2, which is the common situation because
it means exerting effort to defend against cyber-attacks is
expensive. If it is not the case, the effort will go to the upper
bound, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. For any
given wholesale price w(NG), we characterize the equilibrium
retail price p and the likelihood of the successful defense 𝛽
that will maximize 𝜋E(NG).
We can then determine the wholesale price for the sup-
plier by maximizing the supplier’s profit function. As we
assume that k > e2∕2, it is straightforward to establish that
𝜋S(NG)(p
∗
(NG)|w, 𝛽∗(NG)|w) is concave in w (Note: 𝜕2𝜋S∕𝜕w2 =
−2k∕(2k − e2) < 0) and optimizing it yields the optimal
wholesale price and further yields the optimal selling price
and the likelihood of successful defense in Model NG. We
can thus summarize the results as follows. Under Model
NG, if k > e2∕2, there is a unique equilibrium with the
selling price p∗(NG) = A + 𝜏B, the defense effort set by e-
tailer 𝛽∗(NG) =
eJ
2𝜀
, and the wholesale price set by the sup-
plier w∗
(NG) = 𝜏, where A=
k(1−e)
2k−e2
, B =
k−e2
2k−e2
, 𝜏 =
1−e+m
2
, 𝜀 =
2k − e2, and J = 1 − e − m. We can further derive the cor-
responding optimal supplier’s profit and optimal e-tailer’s
profit. As 𝛽∗ and w∗ are positive and 1− B> 0, we can derive
that 𝜏 > 0 and J > 0. We denote CS as the consumer surplus,
which can be derived as follows:
CS(NG) =
1
2
(
1 − e + e𝛽(NG) − p(NG)
)2
. (4)
Under Model NG, at the equilibrium, the supplier’s
profit, the e-tailer’s profit, consumer surplus (CS(NG)), and
social welfare (SW(NG)) are given as follows (see Support-
ing Information A2 and A3 for more details): 𝜋∗S(NG) =
2k𝜓, 𝜋∗E(NG) = k𝜓, CS∗(NG) = k𝜓(1 − B), SW∗
(NG) = 𝜋∗S(NG) +
𝜋∗E(NG) + CS∗(NG) = (4 − B)k𝜓, where 𝜓 =
(1−e−m)2
8(2k−e2)
. A com-
plete list of abbreviations is given in the Supporting Informa-
tion A5. The results reveal that under Model NG, the equilib-
rium profit of the supplier is twice that of the e-tailer’s profit,
that is„ 𝜋∗S(NG) = 2𝜋∗E(NG). Thus, we can clearly see that when
m, a, k, or 𝛾 varies, the effects on the supplier and the e-tailer
are the same.
Now, we explore how the product cost affects the optimal
wholesale price, selling price, and cyber-security. We have
the following findings: If the unit product cost for the sup-
plier (m) increases, (i) the optimal wholesale price w∗
(NG) will
monotonically increase; (ii) the optimal selling price p∗(NG)
will increase when k ≥ e2 and decrease when e2∕2 < k < e2;
(iii) the optimal level of cyber-security 𝛽∗(NG) will mono-
tonically decrease. By differentiating w∗
(NG), p
∗
(NG), and 𝛽∗(NG)
with respect to m, we find that the optimal wholesale price
increases in m. Intuitively, if the cost of the product increases,
the supplier will increase the wholesale price. From
𝜕𝛽∗(NG)
𝜕m
<
0, we see that when the product cost (m) increases, the e-
tailer should pay a higher wholesale price (w) to the supplier.
Then the e-tailer’s motivation to defend against a cyber-attack
will also decrease. If k ≥ e2, the optimal price will increase

when m increases. However, if e2∕2 < k < e2, the optimal
price will decrease when m increases. As 𝛽∗(NG) decreases, the
cyber-security cost for the e-tailer decreases.
Next, we examine how the likelihood of being attacked
(𝛾) will affect these optimal decisions at the Stackel-
berg equilibrium. If the likelihood of being attacked (𝛾)
increases, (a) the optimal wholesale price w∗
(NG) will mono-
tonically decrease, (b) the optimal selling price p∗(NG)will
increase when
e2
2
< k < k1,where k1 =
1
12
(e(2 + 3e − 2m) +
e
√
4(1 − m)2
+ 12e(1 − m) − 15e2), otherwise p∗(NG) will
decrease when k > k1, and (c) the optimal level of cyber-
security 𝛽∗(NG) will increase when (i) 0 < e ≤ 1−m
2
, or (ii)
1−m
2
< e <
3(1−m)
2
and
e2
2
< k <
e2(1−m)
(2e+m−1)
. Otherwise, 𝛽∗(NG)
will decrease. Thus, we can see that if e and k are within
specific ranges, the optimal level of cyber-security 𝛽∗(NG)
will increase as the risk of being attacked increases. This
is because e-tailer is willing to input more effort to reduce
the chance of being attacked when the cost of improving the
level of security is relatively low. Note that the level of cyber-
security risk is defined as 𝛾(1 − 𝛽). From (3), it indicates that
the e-tailer’s demand and profit both decrease with e. If 𝛾
increases, the e-tailer is willing to increase 𝛽∗(NG) to make the
shopping environment safer when 0 < a ≤ 1−m
2𝛾
(i.e., e is suf-
ficiently small). However, when e is over a threshold, the e-
tailer will increase the likelihood of successful defense 𝛽∗(NG)
to maintain the safety level of the platform when k is rela-
tively low. The wholesale price also decreases when the like-
lihood of being attacked increases. As the online shopping
environment will then become more unsafe, the supplier must
lower the wholesale price to attract more demand. However,
as the probability of the platform being attacked increases,
the optimal selling price p∗(NG) will increase when k is within a
specific range. This can be attributed to the increasing cyber-
security cost for the e-tailer.
We now examine how consumer sensitivity to cyber-risk
(a) will affect these optimal decisions (equilibrium). We find
that under Model NG, at the Stackelberg equilibrium: (i)
when the consumer’s sensitivity (a) to the cyber-security risk
increases, the optimal wholesale price w∗
(NG) will decrease,
and if the given likelihood of being attacked (𝛾) is higher,
this effect will be more obvious; (ii) when a increases, p∗(NG)
will increase when k is within the same range as the coun-
terpart for 𝛾; and (iii) the effect of a to 𝛽∗(NG) is the same as
𝛾. When (i) 0 < 𝛾 ≤ 1−m
2a
(i.e., e is sufficiently small) or (ii)
1−m
2a
< 𝛾 <
3(1−m)
2a
and
e2
2
< k <
e2(1−m)
(2e+m−1)
, the optimal level
of cyber-security 𝛽∗(NG) will increase as consumers are more
sensitive to cyber-attack.
Consumers’ concerns about cyber-security affect their
shopping decisions on the online platform. As consumers
become more sensitive to the risk of cyber-attack, the sup-
plier has to lower the wholesale price to attract more demand.
If the cost coefficient k is moderate, the e-tailer will make
the decision to price higher when consumers become more
sensitive to an attack, mainly because the e-tailer’s cyber-
security costs increase. As we can see in the previous para-
graph, the likelihood of a successful defense cyber-attack
(𝛽∗(NG)) also increases when e is sufficiently small or k is
within a specific range. The sensitivity analysis for Model NG
is summarized in Table 3. We demonstrate above that the sup-
plier’s expected benefit is double that of the e-tailer’s benefit
(𝜋∗S(NG) = 2𝜋∗E(NG) = 2k
(1−e−m)2
8(2k−e2)
= 2k𝜓).
In summary, the results above show how the supplier’s
profit 𝜋∗S(NG) and the e-tailer’s profit 𝜋∗E(NG) are affected by
different factors. Under Model NG, (i) if the unit manufac-
turing cost (m) increases, both the supplier’s and the e-tailer’s
profits will decrease. (ii) When
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
, both profits
will increase with the chance of being attacked (𝛾). When k >
e(1−m)
2
, their profits will decrease. (iii) When
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
,
both profits will increase as consumers become more sensi-
tive to the cyber-security risk. When k >
e(1−m)
2
, their profits
will decrease.
Under Model NG, when the cost of product increases, both
the supplier’s and e-tailer’s profits decrease. For the supplier,
when 𝛾 or a increases, the wholesale price decreases, but the
demand increases. The change in profit depends on the trade-
off between the revenue per product (w − m) and demand.
As shown in (3), the e-tailer’s profit depends on two factors,
namely the revenue from selling the product ((p∗(NG) − w)D)
and the cost of exerting effort for cyber-security (
k𝛽2
2
). When
𝛾 or a increases, both the revenue and cost of exerting effort
increase simultaneously. The change in the e-tailer’s profit is
decided by the tradeoff between these two parts. The details
of the respective thresholds are given in Table 4. When k is
relatively low, that is,
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
, both profits increase
with 𝛾 and a.
3.2 Model G: With a government penalty
scheme
As mentioned in Section 1, in some countries or cities,
various government rules and regulations require compa-
nies to maintain certain levels of cyber-security. If a breach
occurs, companies are subject to significant fines, fees, penal-
ties, and punitive consequences. Violating cyber-security
laws is an expensive and disruptive process. For exam-
ple, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regu-
lation (GDPR) is designed to protect the personal infor-
mation of all its citizens. The GDPR is particularly puni-
tive, with very heavy fines potentially totaling up to tens of
millions of dollars. Based on real-world observations, after
exploring Model NG, we then consider Model G, in which

F I G U R E 3 An e-commerce supply chain with government penalty
scheme (Model G)
the government imposes a penalty on cyber-security issues
(see Figure 3).
In this scheme, the government imposes a penalty F when
the e-tailer (E) fails to defend against cyber-attack (Note: In
the extended model (see Section 5.2.3), we consider the case
when the penalty depends on the effort of defense). Observe
that compared to Model NG, the only difference of Model G
is that the e-tailer will suffer a penalty F if he fails to defend
against the cyber-attack. Thus, the number of consumers who
will buy the product at a given price p and effort level 𝛽 under
Model G is given as follows (the subscript (G) represents the
functions and optimal decisions under Model G):
D(G) =

We can simplify (6) and then find that the difference in
the e-tailer’s profit functions between Model G and Model
NG is the term F𝛼, which denotes that the e-tailer will suf-
fer a penalty F when failing to detect the cyber-attack. This
is the situation in places like European Union and Califor-
nia. Following Jiang et al. (2017), Choi (2019), and Pun and
Hou (2021), we define social welfare as the sum of sup-
plier’s profit, e-tailer’s profit, and consumer surplus: SW∗
(G) =
𝜋∗S(G) + 𝜋∗E(G) + 𝜗CS∗(G), where 𝜗 > 0 represents the relative
importance (weight) of consumer surplus in the social wel-
fare. In most prior literature, this value is set to be 1 but as we
will see later on, 𝜗 is in fact critical for our analysis and hence
we explicitly define it here. In our model, the government
decides the optimal F under a given emphasis on CS. Then
the supplier determines the wholesale price as the leader and
the e-tailer controls p and 𝛽 simultaneously as the follower.
The sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 4.
Following the similar approach to that in Section 3.1, we
summarize the equilibrium decisions and results as follows.
Under Model G, if k > e2∕2: (a) the optimal wholesale price
set by the supplier, the optimal selling price set by the e-tailer,
and the optimal defense effort determined by the e-tailer are,
respectively, given as follows (A, B, C, F, and other notations
can be found in the Supporting Information A5; some of them
have been marked bold as we will refer to them later on):
w∗

where
C =

lows:
𝜋∗S(G) =
(k(1 − e − m) + eF𝛾)2

2d𝜀
k
,
𝜋∗E(G) =
k2(1 − e − m)2
− 2Fk𝛾(8k − e(1 + 3e − m)) + F2𝛾2(8k − 3e2)
8(2k − e2)k
= M1. (12)
(c) The consumer surplus and social welfare are given as
follows:
CS∗(G) = d, SW∗
(G) =
2d𝜀
k
+ M1 + 𝜗d,
where d =
(k(1 − e − m) + eF𝛾)2
8(2k − e2)
2
. (13)
Note that in our analysis, we only discuss the case when
the e-tailer’s profit is positive and the effort level is less than
the upper bound. Then we find out that the penalty fee should
be less than F̄ ≡ k(4k−e(1+e−m))
(4k−e2)𝛾
and 4k > e(1 + e − m) under
Model G. In Table 3, we report the sensitivity analysis results
for the equilibrium decisions under Models G and NG.
We can see that the equilibrium decisions under Model G
are very similar to those for Model NG, but with two differ-
ences. First, compared with Model NG, each optimal decision
has a positive increment (as highlighted in bold, see (8) and
(9)). The details will be discussed in Section 4. Second, under
the current model, as the government’s cyber-security penalty
scheme is enforced, the optimal decisions are affected by F.
We also conduct a sensitivity analysis for Model G and its
comparison with Model NG is given in Table 3.
By differentiating w∗
(G), p∗(G), and 𝛽∗(G) with respect to m,
we derive similar results under Model NG. w∗
(G) will increase
with the unit manufacturing cost (m); the optimal selling price
p∗(G) will increase when k > e2, and vice versa. 𝛽∗(G) decreases
as m increases. If the cost of the product increases, the sup-
plier will raise the wholesale price and the e-tailer should
pay a higher wholesale price to the supplier, and the e-tailer’s
motivation to defend against a cyber-attack will decrease. If
the cost for cyber-security is relatively high (k > e2), the opti-
mal price will increase when m increases. However, if e2∕2 <
k < e2, the optimal price will decrease when m increases.
As 𝛽∗(G) decreases, the cyber-security cost for the e-tailer
decreases; thus, even if the wholesale price increases, the
retailing price decreases.
As the likelihood of being attacked (𝛾) increases,
the optimal wholesale price w∗
(G) will increase when
F >
k
2𝛾
; the optimal selling price p∗(G) will increase
when F >
k(k(6k+e(−2−3e+2m))+e4)

The sensitivity analysis of consumer sensitivity to the
cyber-security risk (i.e., a) under Model G is also conducted.
Consumers’ concerns about cyber-security affect their shop-
ping decisions on online platforms. When consumer sensitiv-
ity (a) to the cyber-security risk increases, the optimal whole-
sale price w∗
(G) will increase if F > k∕𝛾. p(G) will increase
with a when 12k ≥ k2 and F >

Under Model G, if the unit manufacturing cost (m)
increases, both the supplier’s and the e-tailer’s prof-
its will decrease. If F > max{

its will increase with the consumer’s sensitivity (a). If
F > max{

with 𝛾. As

2F2𝛾(−8k + 3a2𝛾2) + 2Fk𝛾(−3a2𝛾 + a(−1 + m − 3a𝛾)) +
2Fk(8k + a𝛾(−1 + m − 3a𝛾))]∕8k(−2k + a2𝛾2), when the
numerator is positive, the e-tailer’s profit increases with 𝛾.
After deriving the equilibrium decisions under Model G,
we summarize the impacts of F in Lemma 3.1.
Lemma 3.1. If the penalty fee F increases, (a) the opti-
mal wholesale price w∗
(G), the optimal selling price p∗(G), and
the optimal level of cyber-security 𝛽∗(G) will all monoton-
ically increase. (b) The supplier’s profit 𝜋∗S(G) will mono-
tonically increase. (c) If F > max{0,
k(8k+em−e−3e2)
(8k−3e2)𝛾
}, the e-
tailer’s profit will increase with F. (d) The consumer surplus
CS∗(G) will be greater if the government raises the penalty fee.
From Lemma 3.1, we find that as the government increases
the penalty (F), the cyber-environment will be more secure,
and consumer surplus will increase, although consumers
must pay more for the same product. When the government
increases F, the supplier will benefit unconditionally. Intu-
itively, the e-tailer’s profit is always positive under Model
NG, while for Model G, it depends on the penalty F.
From the analysis above, we summarize how the supplier’s
and the e-tailer’s profits will be affected by the different fac-
tors under the two models in Table 4. We then obtain Lemma
3.2.
Lemma 3.2. (i) When the manufacturing cost (m) increases,
the supplier’s and the e-tailer’s profits will be reduced under
both models. (ii) If the cost of cyber-security is relatively
high, both the supplier and the e-tailer will incur losses under
Model NG when the likelihood of being attacked (𝛾) increases
or the consumers become more sensitive (a) to the cyber-
security risk. (iii) When F is over a threshold, increases of a
or 𝛾 have a positive effect on the supplier’s and the e-tailer’s
profits (the existence of 𝛽 must be guaranteed).
Lemma 3.2(i) shows that when the manufacturing cost
rises, both the supplier’s and the e-tailer’s profits will
decrease.
From Table 4, we find that 𝛾 and a have different effects
on 𝜋∗S(G) and 𝜋∗E(G). For Model G, if the likelihood of
being attacked through an e-commerce platform increases
or the consumers become more sensitive to cyber-attack
risk, the supplier’s profit will increase when the penalty
fee is over a threshold. On the one hand, the wholesale
price (i.e.,w(G) − w(NG) = CF > 0) and demand (i.e., D(G) −
D(NG) = (1 − B)CF > 0) increase with the presence of gov-
ernment penalty scheme. On the other hand, as shown in
Table 3, the wholesale price increases with 𝛾 and a when F
is greater than
k
2𝛾
. For the e-tailer, compared to Model NG,
we have shown above that the e-tailer’s demand increases
under Model G. However, it does not mean that the e-tailer’s
profit will increase because the e-tailer has to bear the penalty.
As Equation (6) shows, the e-tailer’s profit depends on three
factors, namely the revenue from selling ((p(G) − w(G))D(G)),
the cost of maintain cyber security (
k𝛽(G)
2
2
), and the penalty
(F𝛾(1 − 𝛽(G))). The details of the thresholds are listed in
Table 4. Under Model NG, when k is relatively low, that is,
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
, both profits increase with 𝛾 or a. Thus, the
determining factor is k for Model NG. For Model G, the deter-
mining factor is the relationship between F and k.
If F > max{
k(2k−e+em)
4k−e2𝛾
, 0}, then the supplier’s profit will
increase with 𝛾. If F > max{
2k−e(1−m)
2𝛾
, 0} (or equivalently, if
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
is satisfied, or the penalty fee (F) is greater
than
2k−e(1−m)
2𝛾
when k >
e(1−m)
2
), then both the supplier’s and
e-tailer’s profits will increase with the consumer’s sensitiv-
ity (a). As we have proven that
e(1−m)
2
>
e2
2
, when
e2
2
< k <
e(1−m)
2
, it yields
2k−e(1−m)
2𝛾
< 0. Both the supplier’s and e-
tailer’s profits will increase with the consumer’s sensitivity
(a) under Model G. The results reveal that k and F are the key
factors.
The supplier’s profit and consumer surplus are greater
under Model G than under Model NG, and we examine this
in Section 4.
4 VALUES OF GOVERNMENT
CYBER-SECURITY PENALTY SCHEMES
After deriving the equilibrium decisions and performance
measures in the e-commerce supply chains under Models NG
and G, we define the following terms, which represent the
values of government cyber-security penalty schemes

(VGCPS) for the supplier, the e-tailer, consumers, and social
welfare under Model G:
VGCPS(S) = 𝜋∗S(G) − 𝜋∗S(NG), (14)
VGCPS(E) = 𝜋∗E(G) − 𝜋∗E(NG), (15)
VGCPS(CS) = CS∗(G) − CS∗(NG), (16)
VGCPS(SW) = SW∗
(G) − SW∗
(NG). (17)
We then compare Models NG and G, and obtain Proposi-
tion 4.1.
Proposition 4.1. For given a,m, k 𝛾 : w∗
(G) > w∗
(NG); p∗(G) >
p∗(NG); 𝛽
∗
(G) > 𝛽∗(NG);𝜋S
∗
(G) > 𝜋S
∗
(NG); CS∗(G) > CS∗(NG).
With the presence of government cyber-security penalty
schemes, the optimal wholesale price, selling price, and
defense effort all increase, as do the supplier’s profit and
consumer surplus. The optimal decisions under Model G
are similar to those under Model NG. Under Model NG, the
government is absent, so F is not a concern when making the
optimal decision. Under Model G, the government provides
a cyber-security penalty scheme to improve e-commerce
supply chain performance. When the e-tailer fails to detect
and prevent a cyber-attack, the fine (F) is imposed. Through
the equilibrium analysis, we find that the role of government
does affect the final decision of the player. First, the whole-
sale price (w∗
(G) = 𝜏 + CF) in Model G is higher than that
in Model NG and the difference term is CF, where C =
e𝛾
2k
.
Thus, the higher F is, the greater the difference between “the
wholesale prices of the two models” becomes. Second, the
optimal selling price set by the e-tailer is given as: p∗(G) =
A + 𝜏B + (2 − B)CF, which is different from p∗(NG) = A + 𝜏B
in the term (2 − B) CF. The penalty increases the selling
price (2 − B) CF. Third, when there is a government penalty
scheme, we find that the defense effort from the e-tailer 𝛽∗(G)
will be greater than that in the situation without the participa-
tion of government through the term
1
e
(3 − 2B) CF. As shown
above, when the government is involved under Model G,
the increment of the wholesale price is CF. The unit product
cost for the supplier m remains unchanged. Thus, the profit
per product also increases with CF, and the demand for the
product also increases (i.e., D(G) − D(NG) = (1 − B)CF > 0).
The supplier’s profit under Model G is therefore greater than
that under Model NG. Consumers benefit from government
cyber-security penalty schemes. Although they must pay
more for the same product p∗(G) > p∗(NG), the likelihood of a
successful defense goes up more significantly 𝛽∗(G) > 𝛽∗(NG).
Thus, the consumer surplus CS∗(G) rises compared
with CS∗(NG).
Proposition 4.1 clearly demonstrates the impact of the gov-
ernment intervention, and the differences in the equilibrium

decisions between Model NG and Model G are highlighted
(see (8)–(10)). The results also show that the supplier always
benefits from the penalty scheme. After switching from
Model NG to Model G, the selling price increases more
than the wholesale price. (Note: From (8) and (9), since
(2 − B) > 1, we have: p∗(G) − p∗(NG) > w∗
(G) − w∗
(NG)). Com-
pared to Model NG, we have shown above that the e-tailer’s
demand increases under Model G. However, it does not mean
that the e-tailer’s profit will increase because the e-tailer has
to bear the penalty. To avoid being punished, the e-tailer
attempts to further increase the level of cyber-security as
𝛽∗(G) > 𝛽∗(NG). This is also shown in Proposition 4.1. From (14)
to (17) as well as Proposition 4.1, we can see that VGCPS(S)
and VGCPS(CS) are always positive, whereas VGCPS(E)
is negative. For VGCPS(SW), we find that it is negative
when 𝜗 = 1.
To have a clearer picture regarding how various parameters
affect VGCPS(SW) with different 𝜗, we conduct a numerical
analysis. We explore how the product cost (m), the likelihood
of being attacked (𝛾), consumer sensitivity to the level of
cyber-security risk (a), and the cost coefficient of defense (k)
will affect VGCPS(SW) when the threshold of 𝜗 takes differ-
ent values. We will also find the conditions when VGCPS(SW)
becomes positive. In Figures 5–8, the basic parameters are set
as follows (except for the parameter under study when we will
vary it): a = 1, 𝛾= 0.18, e = 0.18, k = e2∕2 + 0.1 = 0.1162,
F = 0.35, m ∈ [0, 1]. From Figures 5–8, we have the follow-
ing observations: (i) Effects brought by some parameters such
as m, k, and a are monotone while the effect brought by 𝛾 is
not. (ii) VGCPS(SW) becomes positive when 𝜗 is sufficiently
big.
From the above numerical analysis, it is clear that if the
government puts a higher emphasis on CS, then VGCPS(SW)
will become positive. In fact, we can prove this result
analytically. To be specific, VGCPS(SW) ≥ 0 if and only if
𝜗 ≥ T ≡ (2k−e2)(2k(8k−e(3+e−3m))−F(8k−e2)𝛾)
ek(2k(1−e−m)+eF𝛾)
. Note that under
Model G, F is bounded above by F̄ ≡ k(4k−e(1+e−m))

approaches zero, we get lim
F→0
T =
(2k−e2)(8k−e(3+e−3m))

When F is set to be the upper bound F̄, then T(F = F̄)
is equal to

ek(e3−4ek−3e2(1−m)+8k(1−m))

We define T̄ ≡ (2k−e2)(8k−e(3+e−3m))
ek(1−e−m)
and T ≡
(2k−e2)(e4−12e2k+32k2+5e3(1−m)−16ek(1−m))
ek(e3−4ek−3e2(1−m)+8k(1−m))
. Based on the above
exploration, we have Theorem 4.1 (Note: The government
aims to maximize the social welfare).
Theorem 4.1. (a) It is wise for the government to
impose the penalty scheme if and only if 𝜗 > T ≡
(2k−e2)(2k(8k−e(3+e−3m))−F(8k−e2)𝛾)
ek(2k(1−e−m)+eF𝛾)
and the optimal F = F̄ (i.e.,
the upper bound). Otherwise, if 𝜗 ≤ T, then the government
should not impose the penalty. (b) Under Model G (in which
the government imposes a penalty fee less than F̄), when
the government’s penalty fee increases, (i) both the supplier
and consumer are always benefited from the penalty scheme.
However, the e-tailer’s profit is hurt. (ii) If the government
F I G U R E 8 How 𝛼 affects VGCPS(SW) [Color figure can be viewed at
wileyonlinelibrary.com]
puts a sufficiently high emphasis on CS (i.e., 𝜗 > T̄), social
welfare increases.
Theorem 4.1(a) highlights the condition under which
Model G outperforms Model NG. Theorem 4.1(b) indicates
the impacts brought by the government’s penalty scheme.
One interesting point to note is that, if the government has a
sufficiently high emphasis on CS (when the weight of CS (i.e.,
𝜗) is over T̄), social welfare is improved upon the implemen-
tation of the penalty scheme. As VGCPS(SW) increases with
F, if the government has a sufficiently high emphasis on CS
as mentioned in Theorem 4.1(b)(ii), then the government’s
optimal decision is to impose the highest penalty fee F̄. As
a remark, when T < 𝜗 < T̄ , Model G yields a higher social
welfare than Model NG if the government imposes a penalty
fee between [F̈, F̄], where F̈ = argF(T = 𝜗); if 𝜗 < T , the
penalty scheme should not be implemented.
To better understand Theorem 4.1(b)(ii), we explore how
the critical threshold T is affected by various factors. First, for
the factor m, the impact is obvious in which a larger m will
lead to a greater T. For other parameters, as the conditions
are indeed rather complex, we conduct a numerical sensitivity
analysis to show how the factors affect T. Please refer to the
Supporting Information A3 for the details.
While if we look at individual stakeholders, we conclude
that it is impossible to achieve the “all-win situation” under
Model G (compared to Model NG) as some parties like the
e-tailer are always worse off. An important implication from
Theorem 4.1(a) is that for the governments that value con-
sumers’ welfare more, it is appropriate to implement penalty
schemes. Theorem 4.1 may hence explain why some gov-
ernments (such as European Union) have implemented the
penalty scheme but some (e.g., New York) do not. In addi-
tion, in all the cases that we have found, once the penalty
scheme is implemented, the fine is very heavy. The real-world
cases are in line with our finding in which governments basi-
cally always adopt a polarized strategy, that is, either do not

impose any penalty or impose a super heavy penalty on cyber-
security issues.
As a remark, implementing the government’s penalty
scheme is not always preferred in all cases. Even if it is pre-
ferred, we have shown that the e-tailer still needs to suffer.
Thus, in the extended analyses in Section 5, we consider some
other measures (Section 5.1), forming alliances (Section 5.2)
that may help achieve all-win for all members of the sup-
ply chain, for both the cases with/without the government’s
penalty scheme.
5 EXTENSIONS
5.1 Using blockchain-based systems
security enhancing technologies
In e-commerce and supply chain operations, a recent topic
is about the implementation of innovative technologies such
as blockchain (Choi et al., 2021; Pun et al., 2021; Shen
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). As mentioned in Section 1,
for cyber-security, it is also widely reported that blockchain
technologies can help provide the technological platform
for operations with secure data. In the real world, Danieli,
one of the world’s largest suppliers in the steel industry,
is implementing blockchain technology to enhance cyber-
security for its networks.9 Cyber Alliance Management (cm-
alliance.com) recently even lists various application areas of
blockchain for cyber-security.10 In this section, we analyti-
cally examine how systems security enhancing technologies
(such as those blockchain-based systems)11 can play a role in
cyber-security. We extend the analysis to explore the impacts
brought by the use of technologies by the e-tailer. We gen-
erate additional insights by exploring cases in which (i) the
e-tailer adopts technologies to defense cyber-attack without
government penalty (Model NT) and (ii) the e-tailer makes
use of technologies with government penalty (Model GT).
We aim to see if adopting technologies can be an effective
way to better deal with cyber-security. Before we conduct
further analyses, we have Definition 5.1 which describes the
“all-win” scenario.
Definition 5.1. An all-win scenario is achieved under Model
x if the supply chain, consumers, and social welfare under
Model x are all better off compared to the respective ones
under Model NG.
Note that for the cases with strategic alliance, Definition
5.1 treats the supply chain as a unit. If the all-win situation
is achieved, it is just a matter of profit division between the
e-tailer and supplier in sharing the “supply chain surplus,” for
example, via a bargaining model.
5.1.1 Model NT
Before we conduct further analyses, we introduce the new
demand function and profit functions that are shown as fol-
lows:
D(NT) =
1
∫
p+a𝛼−b
f (u) du = 1 + b − e + e𝛽(NT) − p(NT),
(18)
where b > 0 is the benefit brought to consumers with the
use of technologies (e.g., blockchain) as it fosters trust and
may allow consumers to check more things with clean data.
To be specific, if the right technologies are used, consumers
will feel more secure toward the e-tailing operations and
this increases their utility. Furthermore, with technologies
such as blockchain-based platforms, transparency of the e-
commerce supply chain will usually be enhanced and con-
sumers can know more about the product (e.g., the prod-
uct provenance information). This also creates value for the
consumers:
𝜋E(NT) =
(
p(NT) − w(NT) − c
)
D(NT) − KIT
(
𝛽(NT)
)
− TIT ,
(19)
𝜋S(NT) =
(
w(NT) − m
)
D(NT), (20)
where KIT (𝛽(NT)) = kIT𝛽2
(NT)∕2 and kIT < k, which means
improved cyber-defense is cheaper with technologies than
without technologies; c > 0 is the per unit technologies oper-
ations cost; and TIT > 0 is the fixed technologies cost.
We try to explore and see if the use of technologies
is an effective measure. By checking the Hessian matrix,
we find that 𝜋E(NT) is jointly concave in p(NT) and 𝛽(NT),
when kIT > e2∕2. We solve this game by backward induc-
tion. Like the derivations and analyses conducted for Model
NG, we can derive the respective equilibrium decisions for
Model NT. There is a unique equilibrium with the whole-
sale price w∗
(NT) =
1
2
(1 + b − c − e + m), the selling price
p∗(NT) =
e3−3ekIT−e2(1+b+c+m)+kIT (3+3b+c+m)
2(2kIT−e2)
, and the defense
effort 𝛽∗(NT) =
e(1+b−c−e−m)
2(2kIT−e2)
.
The supplier’s profit, e-tailer’s profit, consumer surplus
(CS(NT)), and social welfare (SW(NT)) at the optimal deci-
sions are given as follows (see the Supporting Information
A4 for the detailed derivations): 𝜋∗S(NT) =
kIT (1+b−c−e−m)2
4(2kIT−e2)
,
𝜋∗E(NT) =
kIT (J+b−c)2
8(2kIT−e2)
− TIT , CS∗(NT) =
k2IT (1+b−c−e−m)2
8(2kIT−e2)
2 ,
SW∗
(NT) =
kIT (7kIT−3e2)(1+b−c−e−m)2
8(2kIT−e2)
2 − TIT .
We define the technology benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) as
follows:
BCR = b∕c, which is a relative measure to represent
whether the use of technologies is beneficial or not. It is crys-
tal clear to see that using technologies is beneficial, “neutral,”
and harmful if BCR > 1, = 1, and < 1, respectively.

Note that BCR is a critical factor. To be specific, we find
that the main difference between Model NG and Model NT
is related to factors including BCR (i.e., b and c) and TIT .
For w∗
(NT): If BCR ≥ 1, then w∗
(NT) ≥ w∗
(NG). If BCR < 1, then
w∗
(NT) < w∗
(NG). Since kIT < k, so we can get 0 < 2kIT − e2 <
k − e2. For 𝛽∗(NT): The denominator for 𝛽∗(NT) is smaller than
𝛽∗(NG); if BCR ≥ 1, 𝛽∗(NT) is definitely greater when technolo-
gies are adopted. If b is slightly less than c, 𝛽∗(NT) increases.
The magnitude depends on a tradeoff between the decrease
of denominator and the increase of numerator. If b ≪ c, then
𝛽∗(NT) decreases. The conditions are the same for the supplier’s
profit 𝜋∗S(NT) and consumer surplus CS∗(NT).
For the e-tailer: If BCR ≥ 1 and 0 < TIT <
kIT (J+b−c)2
8(2kIT−e2)
−
kJ2
8(2k−e2)
, then 𝜋∗E(NT) > 𝜋∗E(NG). If b is slightly less than c
and TIT is small enough, the e-tailer is still benefited from
the adoption of technologies. Otherwise, the e-tailer will be
hurt, that is, 𝜋∗E(NT) < 𝜋∗E(NG). For SW, if BCR ≥ 1 and 0 <
TIT <
kIT (7kIT−3e2)(1+b−c−e−m)2
8(2kIT−e2)
2 −
k(7k−3e2)J2
8(2k−e2)
2 , then SW∗
(NT) >
SW∗
(NG). If b is slightly less than c, and TIT is small enough,
SW will increase when technologies are present. Otherwise,
SW∗
(NT) < SW∗
(NG).
From the above analysis, we find that if BCR ≥ 1 and 0 <
TIT ≤ kIT (b−c)(b−c+2J)
8(2kIT−e2)
, then 𝜋∗E(NT) > 𝜋∗E(NG). If BCR ≥ 1 and
0 < TIT ≤ kIT (7kIT−3e2)(b−c)(b−c+2J)
8(2kIT−e2)
2 , then SW∗
(NT) > SW∗
(NG).
When BCR ≥ 1 and
kIT (b−c)(b−c+2J)
8(2kIT−e2)
< TIT ≤ kIT (b−c)(b−c+2J)
8(2kIT−e2)
,
the e-tailer’s profit is hurt with the use of technologies, but
SW increases. Exploring CS∗(NT) and 𝜋∗E(NT), we can find that
if BCR ≥ 1, then CS∗(NT) > CS∗(NG), which means using tech-
nologies is good for consumers. Moreover, using technolo-
gies is harmful to the e-tailer if TIT is over
kIT (b−c)(b−c+2J)
8(2kIT−e2)
.
We summarize the core insights from the above analysis in
Theorem 5.1
Theorem 5.1. Under the case without government penalty, if
BCR ≥ 1, the e-tailer’s use of technologies such as blockchain
(i.e., comparing between Model NG and Model NT) will yield
the following: (a) The cyber-security level is higher. (b) Both
the supplier and consumers are benefited. (c) When TIT is suf-
ficiently small, the e-tailer is benefited and social welfare is
improved. When TIT is moderate, social welfare is improved
but the e-tailer suffers a loss. When TIT is sufficiently big, the
e-tailer suffers a loss and social welfare drops.
Theorem 5.1 points out that the adoption of technologies
brings benefits to the cyber-security level. There exists an
all-win situation for all participates including the consumers,
supplier, and e-tailer, when the benefit brought to consumers
with the use of technologies is greater than the per unit tech-
nology operations cost and the fixed technology cost is rel-
atively small (0 < TIT <
kIT (J+b−c)2
8(2kIT−e2)
−
kJ2
8(2k−e2)
). However, it
may be harmful to the e-tailer when the fix cost is relatively
high. As a result, for the case when using technologies is
harmful to the e-tailer, the government may help by providing
a financial support, such as sponsoring the e-tailer to cover a
part of the fixed cost of using technologies. Note that having
government’s sponsor to support technological development
is rather common12 and hence providing this type of govern-
ment sponsor should be feasible.
In conclusion, the adoption of technologies can increase
the cyber-security level and bring benefit to all members
when the benefit brought to consumers with the use of tech-
nologies (b) is greater or slightly less than the per unit tech-
nology operations cost (c) and the fixed technology cost (TIT )
is not very high.
5.1.2 Model GT
In the above model analysis, we confirm that Model NT can
improve the performance of every member and enhance the
cyber-security level. In this section, we consider the pres-
ence of both government penalty schemes and technolo-
gies, represented by Model GT. Here, if consumers suffer a
cyber-attack, the government will impose a penalty F on the
technology-based e-commerce supply chain.
Like the derivations and analyses conducted for Model NT,
we can derive the respective equilibrium decisions for Model
GT. The equilibrium decisions under Model GT are very sim-
ilar to those for Model G. Compared with Model G, each
optimal decision has the new terms related to b and c. The
fixed technology cost (TIT ) affects the profit of e-tailer and
social welfare. Note that in our analysis, we only discuss
the case when the e-tailer’s profit is positive and the effort
level is less than the upper bound. Thus, we find that the
penalty fee should be less than F̄IT ≡ kIT (4kIT−e(1+e−m+b−c))
(4kIT−e2)𝛾
and 4kIT > e(1 + e − m + b − c) under Model GT. Since the
value of the penalty scheme for social welfare increases with
the penalty fee, the optimal decision of F for government is
F̄IT under Model GT.
By comparing the findings under Model G and Model GT,
we have Proposition 5.1.
Proposition 5.1. If it is beneficial to impose the penalty,
comparing between Model G and Model GT: When, BCR >
1, then the optimal penalty is smaller after adopting tech-
nologies (such as blockchain). Otherwise, if the BCR < 1
(BCR = 1), then the optimal penalty is larger (unchanged)
after technology adoption.
Proposition 5.1 indicates the importance of BCR in decid-
ing whether the optimal penalty will be larger or smaller after
the adoption of technologies. This finding is precise and also
in line with the above discussions. The adoption of tech-
nologies with government intervention (by comparing Model
GT and Model G) has the similar effect as the case without
government intervention (comparing Model NT and Model

NG). By comparing between the findings of Model GT and
Model G, the adoption of technologies can also improve the
cyber-security level and bring benefit to the supplier and con-
sumers when BCR ≥ 1. The profit of e-tailer and social wel-
fare only increase when the benefit derived from the use of
technologies (b) is greater or slightly less than the per unit
technologies operations cost (c) and the fixed technology cost
(TIT ) is not very high. With the utilization of technologies, if
the benefit brought to consumers with the use of technology
is greater than the per unit technology operations cost (i.e.,
BCR > 1), then we can find that F̄IT < F̄. This implies that
for the government, the optimal penalty fee decreases after
adopting technologies. Otherwise, if the BCR < 1, then F̄IT >
F̄, which indicates that the optimal penalty fee increases after
technology adoption.
Similar to the analysis in Section 4, by compar-
ing Model GT with Model NT, we can get the find-
ings like Proposition 4.1. For given a,m, k, and 𝛾, we
have: w∗
(GT) > w∗
(NT), p
∗
(GT) > p∗(NT), 𝛽
∗
(GT) > 𝛽∗(NT), 𝜋S
∗
(GT) >
𝜋S
∗
(NT),CS∗(GT) > CS∗(NT). If we look at the impacts of having
the penalty scheme under the case with technologies, we
will find that the government’s use of penalty scheme will
yield the following: (i) The cyber-security level is higher
than the case without penalty scheme. (ii) Both the supplier
and consumer are benefited from the scheme than without
penalty scheme. (iii) The e-tailer’s profit is hurt than without
penalty scheme.
As SW∗
(GT) − SW∗
(NT) increases with F, if the government
has a sufficiently high emphasis on CS, then the optimal deci-
sion for the government is to impose the highest penalty
fee F̄IT . To be specific, with technologies, it is wise for the
government to impose the penalty scheme if and only if
𝜗IT ≥ TIT ≡ (2kIT−e2)(2kIT (8kIT−e(3+3b−3c+e−3m))−F(8kIT−e2)𝛾)
ekIT (2kIT (1+b−c−e−m)+eF𝛾)
. If
the government puts a sufficiently high emphasis on CS (i.e.,
𝜗IT ≥ TIT ), social welfare increases. It shows the robustness
of our core findings in our basic models.
We define
T̄IT ≡ (2kIT − e2)(8kIT − e(3 + 3b − 3c + e − 3m))
ekIT (1 + b − c − e − m)
,
F̈IT = argF(TIT = 𝜗IT ), (21)
and
T
IT
≡ [(2kIT − e2)(e4 − 12e2kIT + 32k2IT
+ 5e3(1 + b − c − m) − 16ekIT (1 + b − c − m))]∕
[ekIT (e3 − 4ekIT + 8kIT (1 + b − c − m)
+ 3e2(−1 − b + c + m))]. (22)
Note that the subscript IT means the case with technology
adoption.
When T
IT
< 𝜗IT < T̄IT , if the government chooses the
penalty between [F̈IT , F̄IT ], then imposing penalty is good for
the social welfare and hence Model GT outperforms Model
NT (Note: F̄IT is the government’s optimal decision). Oth-
erwise, the penalty scheme should not be adopted as Model
NT is better than Model GT. If 𝜗IT < T
IT
, the penalty scheme
should not be implemented.
In the presence of the penalty scheme under the case with
technologies, we will find that (a) social welfare increases if
the government puts a sufficiently high emphasis on CS (i.e.,
𝜗IT > T̄IT ), and (b) it is wise for the government to impose
the penalty scheme if and only if 𝜗IT > TIT . These findings
are basically consistent with the findings presented in Theo-
rem 4.1, and hence we can see that the respective findings in
the basic model stay robust.
Furthermore, focusing on the thresholds (i.e., T for the
case without technologies and TIT for the case with technolo-
gies) that determine whether implementing the government’s
penalty scheme is beneficial to social welfare, we have the
following findings: If F is relatively small and BCR > 1, then
TIT is smaller than T . It means that the penalty schemes more
likely to be preferred after the introduction of technologies.
If F is relatively high and BCR< 1, then TIT is greater than
T . It indicates that the penalty scheme is more likely to be
preferred under the case without technologies.
As a remark, we also explore a scenario in which the e-
tailer outsources the cyber-security task to a third-party high-
tech company by paying a lump-sum payment to acquire
perfect security (i.e., 𝛽 = 1). This extended analysis is in
fact based on some industrial observations. For example, e-
tailers can pay and enjoy the cyber-security services from
the outside platform like IBM Blockchain, Alibaba Cloud
(Baas), etc. As claimed by Alibaba,13 Blockchain as a Ser-
vice (BaaS) is an enterprise-level platform service based on
leading blockchain technologies, which would ensure com-
panies could operate in a secure and stable environment. The
platform also declares that BaaS “provides advanced security
protection and creates a multi-dimensional blockchain secu-
rity system.” For IBM Platform, security is also guaranteed
and many successful blockchain application cases are real-
ized for various industries. Based on these cases, we build
analytical models to identify the value of this outsourcing
service by exploring the equilibrium profit of the e-tailer in
the presence of government penalty schemes and outsourcing
services. The details of this extended analysis are available
upon request.14
5.2 Other extensions15
To show further robustness of our findings and generate more
insights, we have conducted some more extended analyses.
The detailed analyses can be found in the Supporting Infor-
mation A1.
5.2.1 Alliance
We consider the case in which the supplier and e-tailer form
a strategic alliance and remain integrated. For this case, we
have shown that by forming the supply chain alliance, the
equilibrium cyber security level, the equilibrium profit of the

whole supply chain, consumer surplus, and social welfare
will all be better. Forming an alliance, as an all-win strategy,
is a very effective way for improving cyber-security level.
Thus, when it is unwise for the government to implement the
penalty scheme, it will be a good idea for the government to
encourage the e-tailer and supplier to form a strategic alliance
and this will interestingly enhance the cyber-security level.
This is consistent with the observed industrial practices that
major e-tailers like Amazon.com and JD.com all have formed
strategic alliances with many of their suppliers. In addition to
many benefits in supply chain operations (such as dampening
the bullwhip effect and improving coordination), our findings
show that this act is also helpful for cyber-security.
5.2.2 Competition
In the market, competition commonly exists. We hence con-
sider a stylized supply chain consisting of two competing e-
tailers (called e-tailers 1 and 2) selling two substitutable prod-
ucts. (a) For the case without government’s penalty, our find-
ings interestingly show that a higher level of price compe-
tition benefits all members and enhances the cyber-security
level. The larger degree of cyber-security competition also
benefits all members when the cost coefficient for cyber-
security is high enough. However, when the cost is not so
high, members are hurt. (b) For the case with government’s
penalty, we find that the results of the basic models stay
robust.
5.2.3 Defense-level dependent penalty
To check if a change of penalty scheme may affect the find-
ings, we consider in an extended model the case in which the
government’s penalty F is a function of 𝛽. In other words, we
model the case in which the more effort the e-tailer makes,
the lower the penalty fee it faces. Comparing the findings
under Model NG, we first uncover that the results of the
basic models stay robust. After that, we compare the perfor-
mance of the fixed penalty scheme (in basic models) and the
defense-level dependent penalty scheme. Our analysis shows
that when the cost for cyber-security is sufficiently low, when
the consumers become more sensitive to cyber-security, or the
chance of being attacked increases, the government should
choose the fixed penalty scheme. This finding shows that
despite simple, the fixed penalty scheme is in fact a use-
ful method that can outperform the defense-level dependent
penalty scheme. Governments should hence seriously con-
sider it.
6 CONCLUSION
Cyber-security is a critical issue nowadays but it is under-
explored in the OM literature. Motivated by observed real-
world practices, we have built formal analytical models
to explore the value of government cyber-security penalty
schemes under different settings, for example, including the
use of blockchain-based systems security enhancing tech-
nologies (Section 5.1) and others (in Section 5.2, e.g.,
alliance, competing e-tailers, and government’s defense-level
dependent penalty). In the basic models, we have consid-
ered the two situations of an e-commerce supply chain with
and without the consideration of a government cyber-security
penalty scheme (Model G and Model NG, respectively). We
have found that the government’s penalty scheme will always
benefit the supplier and consumers but hurt the e-tailer. We
have analytically proven (with the bounds derived) that when
the government’s emphasis on consumer surplus is suffi-
ciently high, implementing the penalty scheme is beneficial to
social welfare. We have also found that once the government
has decided to implement the penalty scheme, the optimal
penalty should be a very heavy fine (which goes to the upper
bound). Then we have extended the analysis to examine how
adopting technologies such as blockchain will affect the gov-
ernment’s choice of imposing penalty. We have revealed that
when it is beneficial to have government’s penalty scheme,
if the unit technology operations cost is lower (higher) than
the unit benefit brought to consumers, the optimal penalty
will be lower (higher) after adopting technologies. To gen-
erate more insights, we have conducted further analyses for
various extended modeling cases and found that our main
results remain robust. Among other findings, we have proven
that the formation of alliance is an effective way to increase
cyber-security. This is hence a good option in case govern-
ments find that imposing penalty as a way to increase cyber-
security is not beneficial to social welfare. Last but not least,
we have found that the government penalty schemes may do
more harm than good; while once it is beneficial to imple-
ment, the government should charge the heaviest possible
fine. This finding may explain a common observation: In the
real world, governments basically always adopt a polarized
strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty or impose a
super heavy penalty, on cyber-security issues.
Our findings have various practical implications and offer
managerial insights, including some guidance for industrial-
ists and governments on cyber-security issues.
6.1 When should the government impose
the cyber-security penalty scheme
Our analytical results show that the government’s implemen-
tation of cyber-security penalty scheme is beneficial to the
supplier and consumers, but always hurts the e-tailer. We
know that implementing the cyber-security penalty scheme
is beneficial to improving social welfare only for the gov-
ernment which is characterized by having a sufficiently
high emphasis on consumer surplus. This explains why
some countries such as the United Kingdom and European
Union implement cyber-security penalty schemes as they are
well known to have very high respect for consumer bene-
fits. On the contrary, some governments of cities/countries

Production and Operations Management
(like China and New York) do not impose any penalty on
cyber-security. On the basis of analytical findings, we guess
that one probable reason may be because compared to eco-
nomic benefits (i.e., profits of supply chain members), they
pay less attention to consumer benefits in a relative sense. For
example, maybe in New York, company profit is regarded as
relatively important, and there is no cyber-security penalty.
As of today (September 2021), one of the reasons why
there is no cyber-security penalty issue in China may be
that the government focuses more on economic development
and the interests of companies are relatively more impor-
tant. It is interesting to note that China is now talking about
imposing heavy and strict cyber-security measures. Accord-
ing to our findings, this may mean that the government of
China has started to put more emphasis on consumers (than
before) and hence the relevant legislations are now under
way.
6.2 The optimal penalty scheme
From our analyses, if it is beneficial to implement the cyber-
security penalty scheme, then the government should impose
a very heavy cyber-security penalty. This is in fact in line
with the observed real-world practices in which European
Union imposed a super high penalty on cyber-security prob-
lems. The same is applicable in the case of United Kingdom.
Imposing a very heavy penalty on cyber-security problems is
hence a scientifically sound practice.
6.3 What if it is not beneficial to have the
cyber-security penalty scheme
From the above findings, we can see that in the real world,
governments either do not impose penalty or impose a super
heavy penalty on cyber-security issues. Then, for the sit-
uation in which it is not beneficial for the government to
implement cyber-security penalty, what will be some alter-
native measures? In our extended analyses, we have shown
the importance of encouraging the e-tailer and supplier to
form a strategic alliance. Our analysis (see Theorems A1.1
and A1.2 in Supporting Information) has shown that estab-
lishing an alliance strategy is an essential measure in achiev-
ing an all-win situation and governments should not ignore its
importance. This finding also supports the common observa-
tions that e-commerce supply chain members love to estab-
lish strategic alliance (as evidenced by the cases of Ama-
zon.com and JD.com). This industrial practice is indeed wise
and helpful in e-commerce environments with cyber-security
considerations.
6.4 Using systems security enhancing
technologies (such as blockchain)
From the supply chain perspective, if governments only
implement penalty schemes, e-tailers and the profits of the
whole supply chain will be affected. If the benefit brought to
consumers with the use of systems security enhancing tech-
nologies (such as blockchain) is greater than the per unit tech-
nology operations cost, and the fixed technology cost is rel-
atively small, the adoption of technologies will be a good
choice. It is also interesting to note that when it is beneficial
to have the government penalty scheme, the presence of sys-
tems security enhancing technologies also affects the optimal
penalty and the specific impact depends on the technology
BCR. When BCR > 1, then the optimal penalty is smaller
after adopting technologies. Otherwise, if BCR < 1, then
the optimal penalty is larger after technology adoption. This
implies that the implementation of systems security enhanc-
ing technologies like blockchain not only affects the opti-
mal cyber-security level but also the optimal penalty that will
be charged (if the government has decided to implement the
penalty scheme).
A limitation of our study is that we do not consider a
situation involving multiple competing e-tailers in the sup-
ply chain system with different substitutability coefficients.
In future studies, applying the 𝛽-related government penalty
scheme to e-tailers under competition (Ha et al., 2017) would
thus be valuable. Investigating how technology adoption may
improve cyber-security in a competitive environment is also
an interesting future research direction. In this paper, we con-
sider the symmetry of information and postpone the asym-
metry case to future research. Last but not least, extending
the analysis to reveal how the risk-averse attitudes of e-tailers
may affect their investments in cyber-security would also be
an interesting direction to explore.

attacks associated with it. This relates to 𝛾. In our analytical model, we
assume that 𝛾 is public information, which is also based on the fact that
major e-tailers have to disclose major cyber-attack events as a part of its
corporate social responsibility in any open markets.

Real-world cases Details of penalty
Equifax (2017 data
breach)
$575 million
British Airways (2018
data breach)
The UK Information Commissioner’s
Office (“ICO”) fined BA $230 million
Uber (2016 data breach) Instead of quietly going away, the
rideshare company was hit with a $148
million fine for violation of data breach
notification laws
Marriott International
(2018 data breach)
On July 9, 2019, the ICO announced that
the breach resulted in a fine of
£99,200,396 (approximately $124
million)
Yahoo (2013 security
breach)
This breach costed Yahoo $85 million
Capital One (2019 data
breach)
The bank suffered a fine of $80 million
Google violated the
GDPR in 2019
This cyber-security issue costed Google
the equivalent of $43 million
Alibaba (Ant Group
2021)
Chinese regulators fined Alibaba a
record $2800 million. Ant agreed to
strengthen the protection of personal
information and effectively prevent the
abuse of data.b
Didi Global Inc. (2021) Bloomberg claims that Chinese
regulators are considering very heavy
penalties for Didi, for data security
issues.c

TA B L E A 2 Features of cyber-security of e-commerce platforms
Features Details
Related model
settings and analyses
Consumer’s
concerns for
security
Online consumers provide
their private information,
including their names,
addresses, and possibly
their credit card details and
other types of financial
information. This exposes
their information to serious
dangers if the e-commerce
platforms are not secure.
They risk having their
private information being
stolen. Cyber-security is
hence critical
This feature is
reflected in the
demand function in
which consumers’
sensitivity to
cyber-attacks is
present
Cyber-attack’s
impacts
Cyber-attacks can
compromise users’ privacy
and may be disastrous for
the companies involved as
mentioned previously. It is
critical and important to
defend against cyber-attack
β denotes the e-tailer’s
level of defense
effort and an
associated cost
KDE(𝛽) is incurred
Penalty
measures
Unlike other “crimes,” some
governments have imposed
very heavy penalty rules on
cyber-security while some
have not. It is hence
interesting to explore
whether governments
should impose penalty and
play a role in cyber-security
issues or not
We take government
penalty schemes
into consideration
and compare
scenarios with and
without
governments
Alliance In e-commerce, it is widely
reported that e-tailers form
strategic alliance with their
suppliers. Typical examples
include Amazon.com and
JD.com. Whether or not it is
a wise measure to deal with
cyber-security challenges
deserves deep investigation
In our extended
models, we compare
the role played by
alliance and show
that it is critically
important
