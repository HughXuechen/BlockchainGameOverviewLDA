Abstract
This paper centers around blockchain-based health services frameworks and presents an extensive review on current work, 
distinguishing existing and arising difficulties in sleep medicine. We attempt to combine health care, especially sleep medi-
cine, allied with blockchain technology. It addresses the capability of blockchain innovation and how it can potentially be a 
game-changer in sleep medicine. In the field of sleep health, blockchain technology can improve electronic medical records 
and health information exchange. Examinations around blockchain are unraveling digital identity, privacy, protection, and 
security issues in the sleep medical services field. With educated information regarding a patient’s history, doctors can set-
tle on brief clinical choices for secure and more effective consideration. Blockchain improves persistent results, improve 
consistency, lower costs, and empower better utilization of sleep medicine services related information. The framework will 
guarantee continued assurance and security concerning medical care information necessities in general and sleep medicine 
in specific.

1 Introduction
Over the past few years, the healthcare industry has been 
adopting technological innovation to enhance the automation 
of clinical processes and advance research. The healthcare 
industry works with other sectors such as financial insti-
tutions and insurance companies, among others, and there 
has been a growing demand for interoperability across the 
involved departments and institutions. Countries such as 
Taiwan [1], Estonia [2], UK, the USA, and Canada [3] are 
excellent examples of the application of this revolutionary 
blockchain technology in their healthcare, public health

infrastructure, and surveillance systems. Especially, sleep 
healthcare is set to experience development in the future. 
With today’s lifestyle, sleep-related disorders have increased 
and become a significant concern among many individuals. 
Although clinical activities and scientific opportunities in 
this field are expanding, the available research and trained 
personnel to mitigate the problem are still not sufficient to 
meet the demand.
Blockchain technology can be incorporated into health 
care and the sleep health industry to enhance research, 
patient tracking, and secure data sharing for research [4]. 
Sleep medication expansion addressing sleep disorders 
management has limited resource technology to manage 
sleep medical care considerations such as health care data 
management, security, and finances. The use of blockchain 
in sleep medicine presents a considerable weight on the cur-
rent sleep health care system. Therefore, the current situa-
tion necessitates interoperability of maintaining the security 
of medical records and sleep medicine in health care using 
blockchain technology, which facilitates medical services 
data frameworks and encourages health information sharing 
safely and proficiently. In this context, the current review is 
aimed to explore the various advantages and challenges of 
blockchain technology applications in sleep medicine.
1.1  Theoretical Frameworks
1.1.1  Sleep Healthcare Industry
Sleep disorder (or sleep/wake disorder) is a medical condi-
tion that involves a problem with the timing, quality, and 
quantity of sleep, which results in the impairment of daytime 
functioning in which the sleep patterns of an individual are 
disrupted and may have mild to severe consequences such 
as interference with normal physical, emotional, mental, or 
social function-ability of the individual (Table 1).
The maturity of the sleep field led to the development 
of several organizations and laboratories tasked to enhance 
the endeavors to promote sleep and sleep-related services, 
including research related to sleep healthcare. Some of 
these organizations include the World Sleep Society 
(WSS), National Sleep Foundation (NSF), National Center 
on Sleep Disorder Research (NCSDR), American Acad-
emy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and other professional 
societies and foundations. In 1970, only a handful of sleep 
laboratories and organizations were present, but the num-
ber increased over time, and in 2001 close to 1300 organi-
zations were reported in the United States. To facilitate 
the interchange of information, the National Institute of 
Health (NIH) formed the Trans-NIH Sleep Research Coor-
dinating Committee in 1986 and the National Centre on 
Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR) in 1993 to conduct 
and support biomedical research. The functions of the two 
organizations were intertwined, and they worked hand in 
hand to enhance sleep research.
The scientific study of sleep began in 1937 when an 
electroencephalograph was first used to observe the elec-
trical brain activity during non-rapid eye movement, lead-
ing to further advancement in sleep research. Since then, 
a convergence of research from many fields such as neu-
rology, physiology, neuroscience, among others, has led 
to a better understanding of sleep as a natural biological 
activity that affects human functioning. The electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) assessment and polysomnography pat-
terns facilitated testing human sleep, observing anomalies, 
and explaining connections between sleep and health [6]. 
Researchers and clinicians had not just recognized and 
characterized countless sleep issues.
Sleep is a time when several of the body’s hormones 
are released into the bloodstream. These include growth 
hormone, which is essential for growth and tissue repair, 
including in adults. As sleep helps to balance our appetite 
by maintaining optimal hormone ghrelin and leptin lev-
els, examining these biological factors will improvise the 
system’s performance. Today, investigators are examin-
ing the cellular and subcellular impacts of disturbed sleep 
on digestion, hormone imbalances, and other metabolic 
aspects such as melatonin often referred to as the sleep 
hormone, which is a central part of the body’s sleep/wake 
cycle [3, 4]. Its production increases with evening dark-
ness, promoting healthy sleep, and helping to orient our 
circadian rhythm. The main stages of sleep can be grouped 
into non-rapid eye movement (non-REM or NREM) and 
rapid eye movement (REM) states, where there is an 
overall reduction in heart rate and blood pressure during 
NREM sleep and a more pronounced variation in cardio-
vascular activity, with overall increases in blood pressure 
and heart rate during REM sleep [6].

When the sleep span dips under seven hours, and par-
ticularly when it begins to reduce toward six and half hours 
or less, various issues become more frequent. Roughly, 
around 70 million individuals in the US have at least one 
sleep issue [6], specialists gauge that up to 80% of sleep 
issues may go undetected or undiscovered [7]. Improving 
clinical examination in the sleep field will require a helpful, 
global exertion zeroed in on propelling information about 
sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep issues worldwide. The 
advancement of an International Sleep Research Network, 
is intended to help sleep researchers and clinicians discover 
associates with comparable clinical/research interests [8]. 
Clinical information should be controlled, worked, and per-
mitted by information subjects other than medical clinics. 
Numerous difficulties are emerging from understanding 
focused interoperability, such as information guidelines, 
security, and protection, notwithstanding innovation-related 
issues, such as versatility and speed, motivating forces, and 
administration.
1.2  Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology is a database that is decentralized 
and managed by various members of the network. The 
expression “Blockchain” refers to how blockchain stores 
exchange information in "blocks" that are connected to shape 
a “chain.” It is widely used in health care systems nowa-
days due to its interoperability, security, and data manage-
ment system [9, 10]. Blockchain can use health care data 
frameworks capacities to improve tolerant consideration; in 
any case, this has significant administrative, monetary, and 
operational implications. Private permissioned blockchains 
are a legitimate choice for the medical services area to deal 
with delicate patient information. This kind of blockchain 
organization has gainful consequences on the utilization of 
blockchain in medical services. Blockchain provides data 
integration due to which health care data is not easily tam-
pered with. It is essential to provide data security in the 
health care system; otherwise, it could be mismanaged, lead-
ing to cyber-attacks.
Two types of keys are used in encryption: the public key 
and the other being the private key [12, 13]. These keys 
are generated for each user using the encryption function. 
The expression “hash work” is obtained from the French 
word “hacher,” which intends to “slash into little pieces,” 
demonstrating how a hash work is intended to “hack” the 
information. Hashing is a method to empower security dur-
ing message transmission when the message is proposed for 
a specific beneficiary in particular. An equation creates the 
hash, which assists with ensuring the security of the trans-
mission against altering. This technique validates the data 
and avoids hacking the patient’s data available in the health 
domain system [9, 12]. Blockchain innovation can encourage 
the change from organization driven interoperability to toler-
ant focused interoperability. Blockchain innovation permits 
patients to allocate access rules for their clinical information, 
for instance, allowing explicit specialists to get to parts of 
their information for a fixed time frame. With blockchain 
innovation, patients can associate with different emergency 
clinics and gather their clinical information naturally.
1.2.1  Decentralization
Decentralization is considered one of the significant features 
of blockchain technology [8, 9]. It navigates and manages 
data that provides a streamline of a medical procedure. It 
ensures data security and allows the patient to fully access 
his records and share them with health care organizations, 
pharmacies, doctors, and other stakeholders. It provides 
unstructured data collection and data security needed for 
current health care systems [12]. Blockchain technology 
holds great promise for the future by strengthening the coun-
tries’ capacity with simplified early warning surveillance for 
diseases of epidemic potential by reducing the mortality, 
morbidity, and economic costs [10, 11]. It offers a possibil-
ity for a decentralized answer for computerized information 
capacity and administration with options for improved secu-
rity. With sleep medical services turning out to be progres-
sively information-driven, blockchain-driven arrangements 
that have been demonstrated proficient in other information-
driven enterprises have begun discovering applications in 
the spaces of medical services and biomedical sciences, too 
[11, 12].
1.2.2  Improved Data Transfer Security
All information stored on the blockchain is time-bound, 
scrambled, and affixed to the blockchain, making it per-
manent and sealed. Likewise, the information saved on the 
blockchain utilizes cryptographic keys to ensure patient 
data security and included establishments taking into 
consideration obscurity. To ensure the sleep data secu-
rity, blockchain would most adequately coordinate as a 
method of overseeing admittance to access medical data 
information, even though this could take numerous forms. 
When a doctor makes a record, it is checked, and its survey 
authorizations are approved by the patient and put away 
in a smart contract. A smart contract is a protocol that 
runs naturally when the essentials are met, and it is a sub-
stance separate from the original blockchain innovation. 
The record can never be altered without the permission 
of a majority of nodes [12, 13]. When information data is 
added to the blockchain through verification, the data can 
not be altered (immutable). In fact, data cannot be forged 
and guarantees the dependability of information storage. 
Except for individual private data being scrambled, the 
20 Sleep and Vigilance (2021) 5:17–27
1 3
whole information storage framework is transparent and 
open so that nodes can keep up the system together. Tem-
porary access can be constrained using temporary keys 
made by users and passed onto those, for example, medi-
cal services suppliers and insurance companies, and other 
stakeholders (Fig. 1). The token is independent of the 
information, containing just authorization orders, and is 
approved before the necessary reports are dispatched [14].
1.2.3  Transparency and Trust
Blockchain innovation is interlaced. The fundamental 
thought behind blockchain is that its exchanges are anony-
mous and obvious to everybody in sleep medical services 
and medication research. This encourages acknowledging 
examination discoveries, medication, and applications by 
the medical services partners [12]. Blockchain technol-
ogy provides transparency, autonomy, and the potential 
to improve healthcare quality as data is shared among all 
the participants [13]. Blockchain innovation is considered 
an innovation that enables a profoundly secure and trans-
plant plan for the medical data repository. Sleep data of the 
patient collected during treatment will have a more diverse 
opinion about its transparency. It is necessary to check the 
degree of transparency of the collected data, which may be 
influenced by many dependencies. Empowering trust has 
been distinguished as one of the key worries among the 
specialists. Blockchain assumes an essential function as 
its logic depends on the exchange of information between 
non-trusted partners, and the trust can be enabled using a 
smart contract [14].
1.2.4  Smart Contracts
To ensure secure communication, it is a necessity to estab-
lish a protocol. It facilitates an agreement managed by com-
puter code in the blockchain, where it provides the secure 
transfer of data between two parties. The code has a spe-
cific set of rules to be followed in which each party needs 
to abide by the agreement for any kind of interaction [15]. 
On the biomedical research front, blockchain with smart 
contracts carries precision and straightforwardness to a few 
issues identified with information administration in clinical 
preliminaries, running from information security and trust-
worthiness to sharing and recording. Aside from the security 
challenges, there are issues identified with the costly and 
restricted versatility of blockchain and the necessary nor-
malization [16, 21].
1.3  Implementing Blockchain Technology for Sleep 
Healthcare
A suitable set up should be provided to secure the infor-
mation transmission in sleep research. The structure should 
up-grade data security just as give a way through which 
patients can be followed and license interoperability among 
the establishments. Xia et al. proposed a MeD share system 
that ensures authenticity, accountability, and efficiency to 
the healthcare data in a blockchain-based framework using 
the cloud repositories by providing four layers of privacy 
and security [17]. In another study, High et al. proposed a 
unique method to access patient information that could not 
be communicated but can be stored securely on a wearable 
device using blockchain using an encrypted private key (can

be decrypted only by the biometric signature of the patient) 
and public key [18].
1.3.1  Blockchain in Remote Patient Monitoring
The remote patient monitoring (RPM) of sleep patients 
includes the assortment of biomedical information through 
body sensors, for example, the Internet of things (IoT) gadg-
ets, cell phones [14, 18]. Through these sensors, biomedical 
information is gathered from patients outside the custom-
ary medical services conditions. Determining sleep-related 
disorders plays a vital role in improvising the overall phe-
nomenon of sleep health care. Furthermore, this data helps 
research organizations to track the impact of specific drugs 
and treatment methods utilized. This upgrades the research 
and permits progress in the best field. The recorded infor-
mation is then transferred into the blockchain by the sen-
sors, where it is scrambled and annexed to the blockchain 
for security purposes.
1.3.2  Blockchain in Clinical Sleep Medicine
Blockchain potentially can provide a compelling use case in 
sleep healthcare and medicine research. Blockchain helps in 
eliminating any falsified data or the exclusion of undesirable 
results [19–23]. The transparent and immutable nature of 
the blockchain allows research institutions to gain access to 
patient data more efficiently and to get data or results from 
previous research. Another great potential implementation 
in sleep healthcare is the Health Professional Education 
(HPE), which offers competent and valuable education to 
medical practitioners without third parties [19]. The HPE 
creates awareness among institutions and patients in the 
sleep healthcare industry. There is an expanding pattern in 
conveying blockchain in a wide range of utilizations, includ-
ing sleep medical care (Table 2).
Blockchain is also decentralized, because the frame-
work’s design does not allow confirmation and capacity 
of exchange information by a specialist. Since information 
is recorded in the general population record and all of the 
nodes in the blockchain network have record reinforcements. 
They can get to this information whenever and anywhere, 
such a framework guarantees information straightforward-
ness and serves to manufacture trust among appropriated 
nodes in sleep medicine [20]. It likewise encourages infor-
mation review and responsibility by having the ability to 
follow alter safe, authentic records. Blockchain is also uti-
lized in maintaining Electronic Health Records (EHRs). 
Profoundly sleep clinical data put away in EHRs improves 
clinical dynamics, particularly in crises. Blockchain gives 
the essential security and places the patient in charge of her/
his information [15, 18]. Information sharing is a unique 
cycle (Tables 3, 4). 
Figure 2 depicts a typical blockchain application in sleep 
medicine.
To guarantee adaptability and take out many-to-one traffic 
streams in sleep healthcare, we need a decentralized frame-
work [22]. A distributed network [23–25] comprises explicit 
nodes, and they need to demonstrate that they are confirmed 
with a legitimate authentication. To expand network ver-
satility and evade network delay, we bunch the nodes as 
numerous groups. Each node has one cluster head that deals 
with the public keys of the node. Any node joined with any 
group can change the group whenever there should be defer-
ral occurrence. Additionally, the node appended to a bunch 
can change the group head.
In sleep stage data monitoring, our model depends on 
the organization’s dispersed nature and other extra security 
properties. Sleep data can be communicated openly in the 
blockchain network and contain additional data about both 
the sender and beneficiary. Hyperledger includes a security 
foundation for validation and approval; it’s a permissioned 
blockchain utilizing a certification authority, a substance that 
can produce authentications for key sets for marking and 
encryption for the companion nodes. Sleep clinical records 
utilized the hyperledger texture blockchain stage, where they 
were sending clinical information to the hyper record block-
chain network [22]. With the differing scope of information 
from organizations and patients put away on the Blockchain, 
this gives an interesting chance to tackle the intensity of 
other developing advancements like Machine Learning 
(ML) and Artificail Intelligence (A.I). These two advances 
upgrade the exchange of learning methods to understand the 
prescient examination of sleep issue related information and 
advance the exploration in the territory of medication and 
treatment accuracy.
According to Liang et al., mobile and wearable technol-
ogy plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of health-
care services provided; there is a secure way to share the 
healthcare data. The authors proposed a user-centric system 
to implement healthcare data’s security and privacy using 
blockchain technology [23]. The same system could be 
extended to wearable devices in sleep medicine that gives 
comprehensive information on the overnight polysomno-
graphic data, which includes sleep onset latency (SOL), 
wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), sleep 
efficiency (S.E.), and other sleep, heart, and respiratory data 
that can be uploaded on the cloud, where the user can access 
anytime (Fig. 3).
All medical data in various forms would be stored on the 
blockchain in a data repository [24, 25]. These repositories 
are profoundly versatile and can hold a wide range of infor-
mation. Sleep checking is portrayed as getting subjective 
sleep measurements by observing an individual’s sleep dur-
ing the night. These serve two capacities. One is to detail 
a target perspective on the nature of an individual’s sleep,

bearings of patient record access and control
Blockchain and digital sleep health monitoring system We can utilize smart agreements in sleep medication to make portray-
als of existing clinical records that are put away on the network inside 
individual hubs [18]
Blockchain and mobile sleep health In the Mobile sleep health framework, patients got meetings through a 
talk program each day. The program included a completely robotized 
cell phone application. Patients needed to include their m-Health 
information twice/threefold every day, toward the beginning of the 
day, evening, and at night [21]
Blockchain and development and utilization of mobile technology to 
record sleep/wake pattern
(or rest/activity pattern)
With Mobile technology like fitness wearables, a person’s sleep pattern 
is tracked daily, and scheduling timely exports of such data allows a 
better understanding of how patients implement lifestyle changes for a 
sleep-related disease like sleep apnea insomnia
Blockchain and medical information management Electronic medical record available in today’s era does not provide an 
effective relationship between patients and provide limited informa-
tion. Blockchain plays an important role in overcoming the limitation 
by establishing a strong connection between health care organizations, 
laboratories, pharmacies, and patients for better health care delivery 
[22]
Blockchain and data security in sleep healthcare Blockchain provides a solution for data security in sleep health care 
with the help of decentralizing storing mechanisms, encryption, and 
smart techniques
Blockchain and care of patients with sleep disorders Blockchain can collect comprehensive sleep data over a lifetime that is 
required to understand the sleep disorders of the patients that will help 
doctors, physicians to understand treatment plans for an individual 
based on his genetics, lifestyle, and environment
Blockchain in medical records management in sleep medicine The cloud-based medical record is associated with viewing permissions 
and data retrieval instructions, thus using the Blockchain to record 
patient’s sleep data and the medications given via smart contracts
Once a doctor creates a record, it is verified, and its viewing permis-
sions are authorized by the patient and stored in a smart contract [14]
Blockchain-Authenticated Sharing of Genomic and Clinical Outcomes 
Data of Patients With sleep disorders
Sleep is hereditarily controlled. Although ecological elements can affect 
the span of sleep, the hereditary guideline is borne out by the herit-
ability of sleep attributes
The blockchain-validated framework guarantees secure sharing of 
patient’s genomic information got from standard genomic testing, and 
electronic health records
Blockchain in telemedicine services in sleep medicine Pharmacists can get direct prescriptions of a patient for therapy on sleep 
diseases from the doctor and then the drug cart is delivered along 
with the computerized prescription to the nurse who administers the 
therapy of the patient
Blockchain-based personal health information (PHI) PHI consists of medical history, health conditions, health insurance 
information that is collected by health care officials to provide proper 
care [22]
Healthcare organization needs to ensure that all security and privacy of 
collected information is maintained using blockchain-based informa-
tion systems ensures the medical record of the patients is accessed and 
shared to different health care organizations without any interventions
A Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Remote Health Monitoring System Remote health monitoring (RHM) empowers specialists to screen 
patient’s physiological conditions from their homes and liberates 
sweeping medical care offices [27]
Wearable Sensors and information created by them to encourage RHM 
have been the subject of innovative work
Blockchain and the design of a secure protocol for cloud-assisted 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) System
As patient medical services records have been created from conven-
tional paper the executives to an electronic record the board, they can 
be securely put away and approved uniquely by real clinical focuses

while the other job is to decide the sleep patterns. Respira-
tory rate and body developments are viewed as the most 
itemized estimations for sleep checking during the sleep 
dozing session.
Ordinarily, inspecting an individual’s sleep health 
requires an overnight evaluation with the help of poly-
somnography (PSG). Polysomnography (or sleep study) 
has been considered a gold standard diagnostic tool for the

Table 3  Challenges in sleep medical care
Technical Blockchain executions are pseudonymous, specifically, personality is regularly clouded behind a public key, it cannot guarantee 
conditional security for every open key thus the estimation of exchanges is freely obvious
Blockchain-based answers for work viably, partners’ medical services suppliers, patient, and protection must be happy to col-
laborate and set norms about what information is put away on or off the blockchain, what size and configuration is offered [12, 
25, 38]
Organizational organization of co-activity of numerous nodes must be found to give the processing power important to create blocks after an 
exchange is delivered. In this manner, it needs financial, operational for participation. Integration with many medical care 
strategy producers ought to be officially cooperation and make administrative system concerning patient’s protection [18, 27]
Behavioural Blockchain is still in the progress stage thus it goes up against social difficulties social move, social acknowledgment thus it 
should be users training [39]

comprehensive evaluation of various breathing disorders. 
The PSG is a comprehensive monitoring procedure that 
requires multiple sleep-related physiological parameters 
[6]. This includes the brain wave activity (EEG; electroen-
cephalography), eye movement (EOG; electrooculogram), 
muscle activity (EMG; electromyogram), heart rate and 
rhythm (EKG; electrocardiogram), airflow and respiratory 
effort (both thoracic and abdomen), blood oxygen saturation 
level (SpO2), limb movements, and other optional measure-
ments such as the body position during sleep.
Despite several advantages, conventional PSG is an inher-
ently intensive, costly, and tedious procedure. In this way, 
the medical care network is asking for novel non-meddling 
approaches that can improve the nature of medical ser-
vices for the patient while continuing the administration’s 
expense [24]. Actigraphy is a non-invasive method for infer-
ring human rest/activity patterns based on movement data 
gathered using wrist actigraphs. Actigraphy is used as an 
alternative in collecting large-scale data in epidemiological 
investigations  [26, 27]. Nevertheless, this device is not as 
elaborate as the PSG. Nonetheless, its data, which depends 
on the patients’ movement, is basic for medical care experts 
to decipher and dissect the clients’ sleep characteristics 
[25–28].
All data put away in the data repository would be 
encrypted and digitally signed to guarantee the protection 
and genuineness of the data. This way, several sleep param-
eters, for instance, the term of a sleep period, the number of 
arousals, a span of upset sleep periods, and the time needed 
to nod off.
Each time sleep data is collected and saved; the health 
record is enrolled in the blockchain alongside the client’s 
one of a kind identifier. The sleep patient is advised that 
health information was added to his blockchain. Utiliz-
ing a hashing procedure and propose a recent encryption 
calculation to encode the exchanges containing individual 
and touchy information about patients. This calculation’s 
advantage is its capacity to cover an enormous number of 
exceptionally recognized clinical items and its extremely low 
time unpredictability [29–32]. In a similar style, a patient 
would have the option to include sleep-data with advanced 
signs and encryption from versatile applications and wear-
able sensors. The user would have full admittance to his 
information and power over how his information would be 
shared. The user would appoint access authorizations and 
assign who can question and compose information to his 
blockchain. A portable dashboard application would permit 
the user to see who has the authorization to get to his block-
chain [33–35]. A similar dashboard would permit the user 
to give and renounce access authorizations to any person 
who has a novel identifier. Yoon highlighted that Blockchain 
technology allows patients to assign access rules for their 
medical data [36, 37, 38], e. g. permitting specific research-
ers to access parts of their data for a fixed period. With this 
technology, the patients can connect to other hospitals and 
collect their medical data automatically [37]. Therefore, the 
same can apply in sleep medicine for patients and treating 
specialists in sleep clinics and making it easier for patients 
to collect their sleep data from other sleep clinics/ hospitals.
1.4  Challenges
Blockchain innovation is a rising innovation carrying with 
it a lot of preferences and openings. Notwithstanding, this

innovation accompanies several difficulties that ought to 
be tended to, with the executives’ significant information. 
Though there are security issues [26,28] with the cloud 
[17,37], the blockchain can address the health data’s secu-
rity aspects. Therefore, health data (or sleep data) sharing 
and storing with the blockchain-based cloud can address 
several issues concerning medical data management [38]. 
The health care area is vast and spreads its wings into many 
different divisions. In this way, it has a lot of information 
that must be handled daily and annexed into the Blockchain. 
With time, research inside the medical care industry is set 
to increment the information, representing a test of dealing 
with the capacity limit of the medical services blockchain 
[39]. Sleep medical care [44] conveyance comprises a wide 
range of information sources, and the medication supply 
chain is large part regarding both amount and cost and in 
this way defenseless against deceitful assaults. Besides, 
including the functionalities, such as private keys and smart 
contracts, the framework could give authenticity, depend-
ability, validness, and verification of responsibility for drug 
sources. Current executions of blockchain innovation in 
sleep medical services are either the prototyping stage or 
the improvement stage. Hence, it needs more exploration, 
trial executions, and speculations for assessing its impact 
on administrations and results.
2  Conclusions
Blockchain has evolved from the time it was introduced 
through Bitcoin. Currently, it is implemented into general-
purpose technological solutions with use cases in many 
industries. Sleep Healthcare and medicine are also rela-
tively new medical specialties that require technological 
innovativeness to enhance research and interoperability. As 
seen above, blockchain can take sleep healthcare to the next 
level by providing a platform that allows data sharing for 
research and remote patient tracking. With the fast headway 
and deployment of the blockchain in the medical services 
area, these advancements are firmly identified with individu-
als. Thus, protection and security are significant concerns 
in sleep medicine. However, more research still needs to be 
conducted to better understand and characterize the utility 
of blockchain technology in Sleep Healthcare.
