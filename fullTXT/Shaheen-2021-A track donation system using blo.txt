Abstract— Charities face a difficult funding environment, 
mainly because charities are not highly transparent. Day 
over day It became more difficult to know whether donations 
are reaching the right place, or taking another course, such 
as financing suspicious campaigns, terrorist projects, etc. As 
a result, donors lose faith in these organizations, leading to a 
halt to interactions with charitable organizations. This 
makes it more difficult for charities to raise money at a great 
cost. This research proposed a solution to the mentioned 
problem using Blockchain technology, a decentralized 
database that provides security, transparency, and lower 
funding cost by eliminating the presence of third parties 
between donors and charities. A new track donation model 
was proposed which introduced several new participants 
that control the process of donation and remove suspicion of 
the charity. All donations can be tracked in Blockchain, 
allowing donors to know where and how their money is 
being used. The proposed model was implemented using 
Hyperledger composer then it was tested to obtain a live full 
track of a donation process. All donations are made using 
smart contracts, which allow donors to know exactly when 
and how their donations will be received. The Blockchain 
track donation system results in time-saving, reducing the 
cost of donation, and reduces the risk of reaching suspicious 
campaign donations or terrorist projects. A website was 
created as a facilitator for users for ease of use of the 
proposed system. 
Keywords—Blockchain, Donation, Charity, Smart Contract 
I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a new generation of transactional 
applications technology that establishes trust or it can be 
considered as a shared immutable and permanent ledger 
for recording and tracking some required features of 
transactions like transparency, accountability and 
execution while streamlining business processes. It can be 
considered as an operating system for interactions. 
Blockchain has the potential to vastly reduce the cost, 
complexity, and existence of a third party in transactions 
between memberships. Blockchain is related to 
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It is a special kind of 
database with confirmed, authorized, validated, and 
distributed transactions  [1].The validated transactions are 
maintained by a decentralized group of computers 
distributed around the world Instead of centralized 
authority. Those transactions are packaged into blocks, 
each block is linked to previous blocks of transactions 
through a chain called Blockchain.

 In Blockchain, Four main headers are contained in 
each block: (1) Previous Hash: previous block location is 
determined by this hash address, (2) Transaction Details: 
information and details of validated transactions, (3) 
Nonce: a cryptography arbitrary number to differentiate 
the hash address for the block, (4) Hash Address of the 
Block: the previous headers are sent through a hashing 
algorithm that produces the unique hash address or the 
hash of the block. Blocks cannot be manipulated or 
changed due to the decentralized nature and the structure 
of Blockchain. Once a transaction is recorded in a block it 
cannot be manipulated or changed.  
The Blockchain technology needs to meet four main 
requirements to cope with modern business applications 
shown in figure 2, which are: (1) Immutability of shared 
ledger: no one can tamper or modify a transaction if it was 
validated or records of the shared ledger, the hash of the 
block is updated thus violating the integrity of the stored 
data Blockchain. (2) Smart contract: Software protocol that 
provides a well-defined set of constraints and rules to be 
executed automatically that accesses a shared ledger. 
Applications can execute transactions to be distributed in a 
shared ledger through smart contracts without the need of a 
third party while reducing the delay and costs associated 
with traditional contracts. Smart contracts encapsulate 
constraints, terms, rules, and conditions of transaction 
execution. (3) Privacy: achieving appropriate visibility, 
securing transactions, authentication, and verification for 
the shared ledger. Appropriate privacy terms and 
confidentiality between participants is the main issue in 
Blockchain besides a defined identity for each participant 
[2]. (4) Trust: It is accomplished by choosing specific 
members of the business network to verify and validate 
transactions in a Blockchain for business. It is also possible 
to encourage various members to support various types of 
transactions [3]. This allows any data or record across the 
network to have a verifiable audit trail. Once the 
Blockchain has met the previous requirements, it became 
applicable in many fields of business and life applications. 
This research extends the vital role of Blockchain 
technology to be applicable in the field of money tracking 
to help Nonprofits organizations to prove their 
transparency and confidence to the donors. Besides linking 
Blockchain technology to the field of money tracking, this 
paper aims to introduce a suitable solution to the problem 
of tracking donation by introducing new components of the 
traditional system of donation that manage the process of 
donation step by step. Hence, the user can track the funds 
at any step in a transparent way and the authority of 
Nonprofits in spending funds will be eliminated and passed 
to other participants including the donor. 
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Nonprofits face significant confidence-related 
challenges as they suffer from the lack of accountability 
and transparency of how funds are distributed. Some 
donors and charities asked for the intervention of third-
party websites to track charities and the transparency of 
their donation. A charity organization with supervision and 
donation track has more donations than one without 
supervision. So unsupervised charities lose trust and 
confidence over time even if they are trusted. Over time, 
the process of donation became more obscure for donors 
and makes charities lose trust and confidence.  
Some solutions were proposed to secure the process of 
donation from the donor side like [4] proposed in 1995 a 
primitive way for donation by allowing a credit cardholder 
to donate to a charity chosen by the cardholder anytime he 
makes a transaction using the credit card. Several charities 
employ individuals or organizations to collect money and 
attract potential donors. Usually, there are also costs 
associated with such organizations, a certain portion of the 
funds received by  these charities that might otherwise be 
used for the charitable purposes of the organizations must 
now be spent on costs associated with attraction and 
soliciting funds or hiring the employed organizations. It 
would therefore be useful to have a donation transaction 
apparatus and process that decreases manpower 
requirements and/or costs associated with at least some 
donation transactions.  
A technique in [5] for facilitating donations to charities 
is given for the donation transaction was proposed in 1999. 
The apparatus is designed to accept money or, in some 
modalities, authorization for the transfer of cash or funds 
or credit charges, and preferably provides the user with a 
donation receipt that can be used by the user to file or 
document income tax returns.  
Another electronic directed donor system of charitable 
donations is [6] which was explicitly designed in 2005 for 
the Internet, from which donors can direct the disposal of 
donations. Participating charitable institutions can specify 
the necessary goods and services and donors can donate 
money to be used by the institutions for these particular 
needs. 
 In [7] authors aim to build an adaptive framework for 
various charity organizations with Software Product Lines 
(SPL) as their solution to dealing with the problems of 
charities. They presented a forum to build ABS charity 
structures as a central architecture to support SPL.

All the mentioned solutions were concerned with the 
way of securing the process of donation and making it 
easier for the donor and did not concern whether the 
donations were received by needy people or not. They are 
only concerned with how donations can reach charity or 
bank in an easy and safe process using old and traditional 
techniques. 
III. RELATED WORK 
Blockchain has been employed in different fields of 
lives and applications. Some modern researches focused on 
deploying it and getting profits from it in many business 
fields. Some of these modern real-world applications are: 
A. Supply chain management:  
The overall reliability of supply chains is improved by 
Blockchain.  It offers precise identification of the position 
of goods in the supply chain. It thus eliminates the need for 
trials dependent on paper. It helps to avoid losses in 
production and to track the quality of goods. A feasibility 
study was done in [8] where the authors have investigated 
the impact of Blockchain on Supply Chain Management 
and the potential design issues by a generic stochastic 
model. 
B. Digital IDs: 
 Microsoft is working on developing IDs to empower 
disadvantaged people and refugees, with an estimation of 1 
billion people not having an identity worldwide. This will 
lead to connecting them to the formal financial sector. Via 
its Authenticator app, it aims to do this. Authenticator does 
not use a password, it uses an additional layer of security 
that recognizes a returning user or a computer using a code 
or a token. For consumers, it is an ideal way to manage 
their digital identities.[9] Discussed the potential benefits 
and impact of employing Blockchain for a more robust 
identity system where it proposed a digital identity 
verification framework with record attestation and sharing 
based on Blockchain technology. 
C. Healthcare:  
The patient has the right to access reliable data, being 
the focal point of the healthcare ecosystem. It can be 
regarded as a matter of life and death as well. Health data 
privacy and protection are very critical in the field of 
healthcare  . It helps to monitor the number of prescription 
medicines in series and batch numbers. A new security 
architecture based on Blockchain was proposed in [10] to 
cope with the requirements of electronic medical records. 
The basics of Blockchain besides the current and future 
applications of Blockchain within the healthcare industry 
were illustrated in [11], [12]. An example of these 
applications was Guardtime which is a Netherland-based 
data security foundation that has partnered with the 
government of Estonia to make a Blockchain-based 
framework to verify patient identities. 
D. Wills or inheritances:  
It is now possible to replace paper wills or inheritances 
with digital ones that can be generated and stored using the 
Blockchain network. Since it will make the document both 
legally binding and crystal clear as to who should inherit 
the properties when people pass away, it must be used 
along with smart contracts. This puts to rest the end-of-life 
worries. A neuron Blockchain algorithm was proposed in 
[13] to deal with the legal problems of inheritance. 
E. Food traceability and safety:  
The ability to track your food from its origin to your 
plate is the fascinating application of Blockchain in food 
protection. Using the immutable existence of the 
Blockchain, it is possible to track the transportation of food 
items from their source to their last destination. The source 
of the contaminant can be traced easily and reliably in the 
case of nutrition diseases. A traceability system in [14] can 
record and trace each step or movement of food in a supply 
chain. 
F. Digital voting:  
The main issues of Blockchain in digital voting [15], 
integration of digital national id with Blockchain [16], and 
secure voting systems [17] are some examples of how 
Blockchain is used in digital voting. With the transparent 
existence of the Blockchain, a trusted vote can be truly 
counted. The token-based system created using Blockchain 
technology would guarantee one unchanging vote per 
person for the system. 
G. Real estate:  
Details and special information about ownership are 
stored and saved in the Blockchain. This makes it very 
easy to trace the ownership and know the current 
ownership or any transfer of this ownership. It provides a 
clear picture of the history of any real state and legal 
ownership by eliminating the existence of any suspicious 
paper contracts. A special use case about the use of smart 
contracts in the field of real state was presented in [18]. 
H. Money Tracking: 
With the growth of Blockchain technology, some 
researchers are concerned with the transparency of the 
process of donation as in [19] where the authors proposed 
a system that concerns integration between charitable 
foundations and aggregating data in one place. The system 
aimed at integrating different systems of charities 
foundation into one platform.  
In [20], [21] authors introduced a system depending on 
tender submission between organizations to the charity 
chain. One of the Blockchain donation tracking models 
was [22] where authors depend on a strategy in which an 
electronic wallet is created for the donor and assigned a 
unique id. The charity fund verifies the applications of the 
recipient and decides the form of service, the production of 
the electronic donation collection wallet for the service 
donor's account, and the sum needed. 
 New research based on an Ethereum network was 
presented in [23]. The research proposed a decentralized 
donation monitoring system based on Blockchain using 
Ethereum Blockchain that will provide the intended 
recipients with full transparency, accountability, and direct 
reach. The authors introduced the government organization 
to approve the requirements of charities to be announced to 
donors. Hence, the system is concerned with proving the 
trust of charities. 
Many successful projects depending on Blockchain and 
money tracking were spread all over the world in various 
fields of aids such as OIN.Space, luxarity for donation 
tracking, the Leukemia Fund which is a Russian 
Blockchain reporting, The (WFP) UN world food program 
also used Blockchain tracking for distribution of assistance

to directly pay vendors in Jordan, facilitation of cash 
transfers for more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, and 
auditing of spending by beneficiaries, Akshaya Patra, the 
largest non-profit provider of cooked meals for school kids 
in the world, used a Blockchain solution to minimize the 
cost of each meal it provides, The Ethereum Blockchain 
electronic wallet for the Charity Fund for older people and 
the DataArt Blockchain project that was called Charity 
Lottery. 
IV. PROPOSED DONATION SYSTEM 
From the previous work in the field of donation, the 
authority of fund spending was passed from the charity and 
Nonprofits to another centralized foundation that controls 
the funds and this conveys the main problem of 
transparency and suspicion from charity to the new 
foundation. Hence, a new proposed system that consists of 
several new participants was proposed in that section of the 
paper where each participant was assigned a part of the 
authority of spending funds process.  With specified roles 
for each participant that complements each other, the 
process of tracking donation became more modest and 
decentralized. Each participant in the system was defined 
and presented with its main role and process in the system, 
architecture and sequence diagrams were presented to 
clarify the role of each participant. 
A. Proposed System architecture 
The proposed system concerns with eliminating the 
absence of monitoring and censorship of charities, so the 
proposed system introduces two major participants. These 
new participants act as the dominant component of the 
system as they take the decision and verify any transaction 
in the system. Donors, charities, and beneficiaries are the 
main building blocks of any system. With the aid of new 
dominant participants like monetary funds and global 
citizen, the transparency of the donation process is verified 
as illustrated in figure 3.  The main participants and their 
roles are: 
 
1) Donor: any individual or organization that needs 
to make a trusted donation process by choosing one of the 
trusted charities that are supervised by the blockchain 
system. Besides choosing a charity, a donor can also 
choose a specified beneficiary with a certain amount of 
donation that the beneficiary needs which is declared by 
temporary changing Blockchain records, depending on 
other received donations. 
2) Charity: The organization that is supervised to be 
a trusted organization by joining the Blockchain system. 
This organization is responsible for introducing social 
case research about each beneficiary and the amount of 
required donation for each one of them to the global 
citizen. After approval from the global citizen about these 
social case research, charities can announce the required 
donations for the intended donors. 
3) Monetary fund: a financial organization or 
government organization that is responsible for receiving 
the donation from the donor and send the specified 
amount of donation required by the charity after 
verification of the beneficiaries and their needs by Global 
citizen. 
4) Global citizen: a neutral and non-profitable 
organization that acts as a verifier for each social case sent 
from the charities and have the decision if the monetary 
fund can send a donation for charities or not depending on 
social case researches.  
5) Beneficiaries: needy persons who can apply a 
donation request for any donation charity in the 
Blockchain. 
B. Proposed System Scenario 
The system follows predefined steps for confirmation 
of the donation process as shown in figure 4 that can be 
simplified as follows:

1) Application and registration of beneficiaries: 
The first step before any transactions or donation to be 
executed, the beneficiary applies for a donation request to 
the charity which then introduces the available 
applications to the global citizen with the required amount 
of funds. 
2) Verification of the beneficiary social case: After 
applications have been sent to the global citizen, it makes 
social case research about the beneficiaries. After 
verification, only applications that fulfill the rules are sent 
to charities to be announced to donors. 
3) Donor decision for donation: after social state 
verification of needy people, the donor can decide 
donation for which beneficiary and which amount or type 
of donation whether it is cash or material aid. 
4) Transfer of funds to a government organization 
(monetary funds): The government organization receives 
the donations from the donor directly after verification of 
the donor's account. When the global citizen sends a 
confirmation about donations to this government 
organization, this organization transfers required funds to 
the specified charity which sends funds to the required 
beneficiary.  
5) Donation transfer to beneficiaries: charities 
receive funds from monetary fund then send it to the 
required beneficiaries which in turn sends a report to 
global citizen with the received funds and donations. 
6) Sending report to the donor: if the transaction of 
the donation was done correctly, the global citizen sends a

report to the user with the same specified donations and 
confirming the process of donation. Of course, all these 
processes were saved as immutable records in the 
Blockchain as all the mentioned participants have 
accounts and privileges to track the processes of donation 
in the Blockchain.  
C. Proposed System Implementation 
 
1) The implementation was done using Hyperledger 
Composer to build the network. By using Hyperledger 
Composer playground for defining and testing models like 
assets, participants, and scripts. The business rules in 
transactions and smart contracts are implemented and 
transactions were invoked using Hyperledger Composer. 
2) Model files are created describing assets (objects 
to be owned or controlled like goods or money), 
participants (business network members), and scripts 
(transactions processors that provide implementation with 
JavaScript of transactions). 
3) Defining privacy rules that can be simple or 
complex in access control files. 
4) The business network was created by running 
docker and fabric, then creating admin cards. 
5) Generating the skeleton of the app using Yeoman 
and filling the files with code that has been done in the 
playground. 
6) Creating the file of Business Network Archive 
(BNA) then deploying the .BNA file on the Fabric. 
7) After creating the network and participants, the 
scenario of the proposed system will be created and 
transactions will be verified. Each transaction will have a 
unique ID. The donor will receive a report for each 
transaction or donation process in the network in the form 
of figure 5. 
8) The proposed system was implemented and 
designed on a website to facilitate the donation process. 
All participants have a username and password to access 
their accounts to track any selected transaction. The donor 
can choose any charity or any project of donation with a 
specified amount of required funds that are changed 
temporarily according to current donation processes as 
illustrated in figure 6, the transaction report that is 
delivered to the donor from the system website was 
presented in figure 4 where the ID of the transaction, 
amount of money, very accurate time and date of 
transaction, and the chosen donation project number of the 
specified charity.  
V. CONCLUSION 
 
The proposed system concerns with the confirmation of 
transferring aids and donations to beneficiaries with 
predefined constraints. Third-party between donors and 
poor people was removed as all network participants were 
assigned in the Blockchain system by predetermined 
authentication techniques. The system was split into 
several participants with specified roles. The proposed 
model has been turned into a real system that was tested 
and implemented using Blockchain technology. As a 
result, each transaction has its participants and their assets 
with a smart contract which make the transaction a 
successful one. By using a smart contract, terms, and rules 
that once it has been verified the transaction will not be 
changed anymore. A report with a transaction ID was sent 
to the user to verify transactions. The implemented system 
saved time, reduced the cost of donation, and reduced the 
risk of reaching suspicious campaign donations or terrorist 
projects. A website from which users can track or send and

receive reports was created and a final report form was 
generated to ensure the transparency of the donation 
process.
