Abstract
The edge clouds in mobile edge computing networks are isolate which may belong to
different companies or organizations, and hence the communication, computation,
and storage resources are not efficiently utilized. To solve this problem, we propose the
resource-sharing model of edge clouds which is based on blockchain technology and
auction game. In this model, the blockchain platform is regarded as the bridge of the
resource sharing, composed of edge clouds, clouds, third-party spectrum and
computation management, identity authentication institutions, etc. It is used to record
the users’ transaction information and broadcast the intelligent terminals’ resource
requirements to all edge clouds in the blockchain platform through smart contracts.
Then, an optimization problem of the joint allocation of communication and
computation resources is formulated to maximize the utility of intelligent terminals.
And an efficient improved sealed second-price auction game is proposed to allocate
communication and computation resources and determine the optimal price of
resources under the intelligent terminals’ QoS constraints. Simulation results show that
the model can effectively improve the system resources utilization and the successful
transaction rate.
Keywords: Blockchain, Auction game, Edge clouds, Resource sharing
1 Introduction
Recently with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), various types of new
intelligent terminals continuously emerge and generate huge amounts of data. For exam-
ple, ubiquitous surveillance cameras generate a huge amount of data every day. Usually,
these continuously emerging data with personal privacy will not only increase the risk
of privacy leakage but also cause more data to be transferred to the cloud, which occu-
pies more bandwidth and brings higher latency, energy consumption, etc. Besides, some
new high real-time applications and privacy protection requirements such as automatic
driving and industrial automation require local data processing. Therefore, mobile edge
computing (MEC) system that can not only reduce the delay and network burden, but
also protect the privacy of users comes into being [1].

Many researchers have been engaged in the research of MEC resources allocation.
In [2], a joint multi-user resources allocation of spectrum and computation was pro-
posed, which conclude a resource allocation method for a given unloading strategy and
an optimization unloading strategy based on orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing Access (OFDMA). [3] proposed an incentive-compatible auction mechanism (ICAM)
for the resources transactions between the mobile devices as service users(buyers) and
edge clouds as service providers (sellers). However, this model can only allow one to one
matching between intelligent terminals and edge clouds. In [4], an improved double auc-
tion scheme was investigated based on the break-even and one edge cloud can allocate
resources to many intelligent terminals in one auction under the constraints of the edge
clouds computation resources.
However, the service capability of a single edge cloud is very limited and each edge
cloud belongs to different operators, enterprises, or third parties. Meanwhile, it provides
services to different industries and applications. In order to establish a data sharingmech-
anism of such heterogeneous distributed edge clouds system, three basic issues must
be solved. The first is to establish a resource sharing bridge between the autonomous
domains. The second is to effectively aggregate and manage the heterogeneous network
resources. The last is to ensure the resources sharing execution safe and reliable. There-
fore, it is difficult to achieve effective resource sharing in the distributed heterogeneous
systems by traditional centralized security management technology.
Blockchain is widely regarded as a promising technology to be used for trusted
exchanges in the digital world [5]. The immutable ledger, decentralized architecture
and identity authentication system of blockchain together ensure the data authentic-
ity and provide a technical support for the resources sharing among the heterogeneous
distributed edge clouds. Furthermore, the natural trading attributes of blockchain can
provide an incentive mechanism to charge intelligent terminals and rewards edge clouds.
According to the natural transaction attributes and decentralized trusted transaction
mechanism of blockchain, [6–9] have researched the data sharing problem of distributed
systems in different fields. [6] used the block-chain-based competitive first-come-first-
service queue to implement spectrum sharing in mobile cognitive wireless networks.
Specoins, which is a kind of virtual currency is introduced as a reward while user access-
ing the spectrum. [7] proposed a system to solve the problem of medical data sharing
among medical big data custodians in a non-trusted environment. Kim et al. [8] focused
on energy trading using blockchain (mainly household electricity). The households could
exchange electric energy using special energy COINS on consortium blockchain platform
and buy or sell energy COINS in public blockchain platform. A mechanism was studied
to solve the charging and discharging problem of electric vehicles based on blockchain
technology in [9], where charging vehicles pay discharging vehicles by energy coins. It also
performed energy bidding and trading through an iterative dual auction mechanism.
Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to the investigations of MEC based
on blockchain. Christidis K explored the feasibility of the combination of blockchain
technology and the IoT to create a service market between devices, so as to promote
the sharing of services and resources [10]. A blockchain based MEC management was
presented in [11] to guarantee service continuity in a secure, timely and efficiently man-
ner. The computation resources allocation problem for mobile devices during the mining
process underlying MEC environment based on blockchain was investigated in [12–14].
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 3 of 23
AD2D-assistedMEC computation offloading based on the blockchain was proposed [15].
And in [16], a blockchain-based MEC platform was proposed to ensure edge nodes to
work in a trustworthy environment. [17] develop a secure and intelligent task offloading
framework to reduce task offloading delay, queuing delay, and handover cost with incom-
plete information while simultaneously ensuring privacy, fairness, and security remains
an open issue. It should be noted, there are few researches on the joint resources alloca-
tion of communication and computing based on blockchain in theMEC resources sharing
system.
To fill this gap, a joint resources allocation of communication and computing in secure
MEC resources sharing system is studied based on blockchain and auction game, in this
paper. The main contributions of this paper are mainly given as follows:
• A bridge of the resources sharing is established using blockchain which is composed
of edge clouds, clouds, third-party spectrum and computation management, identity
authentication institutions, etc. In the blockchain platform, the intelligent terminals
can apply for resources from each cloud and edge cloud using smart contract.
• In order to improve the resources utilization, an efficient and improved auction game
is proposed with dynamic pricing and dynamic computation resources under the
constraints of intelligent terminals. In the auction game, the intelligent terminals are
divided into different priority according to the location of the access network to the
edge clouds and the resources will be allocated to terminals with higher priority first.
2 Methods
As depicted in Fig. 1, the system has three layers, such as clouds, edge clouds and terminal
access. Clouds are the core and the central resources provider in the network, which is
composed of a group of large servers. Edge clouds mainly include MEC Server, resources
proxy server (RPS), etc. MEC server is a small cloud computation resources pool deployed
by telecom operators at the edge of the network near or inside the base station (BS) to
supplement the central server. Therefore, the tasks of intelligent terminals can be carried
out in local sever. RPS is a new equipment addition to the system, which can be placed
near or inside theMEC server. Assume that oneMEC server corresponds to one RPS. The
terminal access layer is composed of BSs and intelligent terminals, such as smart home
equipment, smart cars, smart phones, sensors, etc.
The bridge of resource sharing among the edge clouds is built by blockchain, which
includes RPS, third-party spectrum and computation management, identity authentica-
tion institutions, etc. The most important part of the blockchain platform is RPS, which is
the key device to share resources among the heterogeneous distributed edge clouds. It has
two main functions. Primarily, it stores the external resources information of edge clouds
and BSs. Then, the terminals can request resources from the RPS to achieve resources
sharing. Secondly, it runs the smart contract, which provides an interface for applica-
tions to access the blockchain and writes global ledger. In the system, intelligent terminals
can broadcast resources application message through RPS in blockchain platform using
smart contract. Edge clouds or clouds in the blockchain network will receive the smart
contract of resources application. Then, the edge clouds or clouds provide services to the
intelligent terminals according to their requirements. Thus, the resources sharing among
heterogeneous distributed edge clouds is completed.

Fig. 1 System mode
Then, in order to improve the resources utilization rate, an efficient and improved auc-
tion game is proposed based on auction bymaximizing user’s benefit under the intelligent
terminals’ Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. After that, the implementation of data
sharing among edge clouds using blockchain is narrated.
3 Problem formulation based on auction
In this paper, a multiuser MEC system based on blockchain is adopted as shown in Fig. 1.
In this scenario,the intelligent terminal i ∈ I = {1, 2, 3, ...I} which has limited power and
computation resources will offload their tasks to the edge cloud k ∈ K = {1, 2, 3, ...K}
through the BS j ∈ J = {1, 2, 3, ...J} for saving energy or reducing execution time. There-
fore, the intelligent terminal i requests subcarrier n ∈ N = {1, 2, 3, ...N} from BS j and
requests MEC (communication and storage) resources from edge cloud k . Theoretically,
there exist two competing trading processes for resource allocation such as competing for
bandwidth resources from BSs and competing for MEC resources from edge clouds. As
a consequence, the auction game is adopted to jointly allocate the bandwidth and MEC
resources in the systems based on blockchain.
For an intelligent terminal i, an offloading task with the number of CPU cycles Di and
the transmission data size Si is sent to the adjacent BSs. Then, the BSs allocate bandwidth
to the intelligent terminal i and send the request to the blockchain for MEC resources. In
terms of system utility, the transmission efficiency (saving energy and reducing execution
time) and auction benefits are investigated in the paper.
3.1 Transmission efficiency
In the paper, the OFDMA is adopted as the multiple access schemes to avoid the same fre-
quency interference. Correspondingly, the instantaneous rate of the intelligent terminal i
in a subcarrier with a bandwidth of W Hz can be expressed as follows:
rijn = cijnW log2
(
1 + pijnHijn
Wσ 2
)
. (1)
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 5 of 23
The total transmission rate provided by BS j for intelligent terminal i can be formulated
as:
rij
(
cijn, pijn
) =
N∑
n=1
rijn. (2)
Where define an indicator cijn ∈ {0, 1}, cijn = 1 if subcarrier n of BS j is allocated
to intelligent terminal i, otherwise, cijn = 0. pijn represents the transmission power of
intelligent terminal i to BS j in subcarrier n, the maximum value of intelligent terminal
i is Pi due to the hardware limitations. The channel gain in subcarrier n from intelligent
terminal i to BS j is Hijn. And, σ 2 is the power of additive White Gaussian Noise [18].
3.1.1 Local computation
fi denotes the local computation capability of the intelligent terminal i in terms of
instructions per second. Then, the task completion time locally can be obtained as:
ti = Di
fi
. (3)
According to [19], the energy consumption of local task execution is given as:
Ei = uiDi. (4)
Where ui = 10−11f 2i is the consumed energy by the intelligent terminal i in one
computing cycle.
3.1.2 Remote computation
The task offloading time delay is composed of two parts (backhaul link delay and down-
link communication delay are ignored): the uplink communication delay tulij = Si
rij and
data processing delay texeik = Di
fik [20]. Where fik is the amount of requested computa-
tion resources for the intelligent terminal i from the edge cloud k. Then, the remote
computation time delay is defined as:
tMi = tulij + texeik (5)
For the intelligent terminal i, the remote energy consumption EMi is mainly about the
upload energy consumption for task execution is saved through offloading. Specifically,
the energy consumption can be written as:
EMi =
N∑
n=1
cijnpijnSi
rij
(6)
3.1.3 Transmission efficiency
It should be noted that the intelligent terminals offload tasks to edge clouds for saving
energy or reducing execution time. Specifically, the utility of energy and execution time
by offloading task to the edge clouds can be described as:
uITi = α
(
ti − tMi
) + β
(
Ei − EMi
)
. (7)
Where α + β = 1, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 represent normalization coefficients
of time delay and energy consumption. Additionally, if the intelligent terminals put the
emphasis on the delay cost, α will be increased. In contrast, if energy consumption is more
important, increase β correspondingly.

3.2 Auction benefits
As pointed above, there are two auction processes such as bandwidth, MEC resource
allocation. In this paper, the second-price sealed auction is selected to allocate the
resources.
3.2.1 Budget balance
The traditional auction scheme meets budget balance when the auctioneer does not lose
money in the trade. But in this paper, the buyers and sellers trade through the blockchain
and there is no auctioneer exist. Therefore, the auctioneer does not lose money in the
trade.
3.2.2 Individual rationality
Nowinning buyer is chargedmore than its bid and no winning seller is rewarded less than
its ask. In other words, a mechanism is individually rational if, for both participating buyer
and seller, the proceeds from the bid is no less than non-participation (at least equal). For
buyers, due to the selection of second-price sealed auction, the payment price is lower
than the bid, and each buyer who participates in the auction always gains more than zero.
For the winning seller, the payment price is more than the cost of the resources, such as
vSik ≥ csSk , v
F
ik ≥ csFk , v
BS
ij ≥ csBSj . Where vSik , v
F
ik and vBSij are the transaction price of storage,
computation, and bandwidth respectively, and the cost of the storage, computation, and
bandwidth are csSk , cs
F
k and csBSj .Hence, the utility of the seller is always greater than zero
too. On the other hand, if the seller loses the transaction then the utility is zero. It is
obvious that the benefits for both buyers and sellers are not less than zero. Therefore, the
action is individually rational.
3.2.3 Incentive compatible
Amechanism is incentive-compatible if both buyer and seller report their actual requests
without lying. In the second-price sealed auction, the successful bidder will pay a price
independent of his bid.Without collusion, the best strategy for each bidder is to give price
according to intelligent terminals’ own valuation of the resources. For the bidder, if the bid
price is less than the real valuation price, the chance of winning the auction will reduce.
On the contrary, if the bid price is higher than the real valuation price, the bidder may get
a non-profitable deal although the chance of winning the auction will increase. As a result,
the best strategy for each bidder is to make the bid price equal to the real valuation price.
3.2.4 Auction benefits
The auction benefits are composed of bandwidth and MEC resources allocation. In the
bandwidth auction game, intelligent terminals i request bandwidth resources from BS j
and have a bid price matrix BBS =
{
bBSij , i ∈ I, j ∈ J
}
. Where bBSij is to indicate the maxi-
mumprice howmuch intelligent terminal i is willing to pay for BS j for per unit of time and
per unit of bandwidth. Assume that after auction determination, buyer i wins the band-
width resource from seller j. Due to the regulation of the second-price sealed auction, the
transaction price vBSij is lower than the bid price bBSij . Therefore, the auction benefits of
the bandwidth can be calculated as uBSi = mijwijtulij
(
bBSij − vBSij
)
. Where mij ∈ {0, 1}, and
mij = 1 if BS j successfully allocates resources to the intelligent terminal i , otherwise,
mij = 0. wij represents the amount of bandwidth resources requested by the intelligent
terminal i.
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 7 of 23
As such, in the MEC auction game, the intelligent terminals i request MEC resources
from the edge cloud k and have bid price matrixes BF = {
bFik , i ∈ I, k ∈ K
}
, BS ={
bSik , i ∈ I, k ∈ K
}
, Where bFik and bSik are the maximum price how much intelligent termi-
nal i is willing to pay for edge cloud k for per unit of time and per unit of resources. In
the same way with bandwidth auction, the benefits for MEC resources can be written as
uMEC
i = mik
(
fiktexeik
(
bFik − vFik
) + Sitexeik
(
bSik − vSik
))
.
Where mik ∈ {0, 1}, and mik = 1, if edge cloud k allocates resources to the intelligent
terminal i, otherwise, mik = 0. The bid price and transaction price per unit of time and
per unit of resources are bFik and vFik respectively. Simultaneously, bSik and vSik are the bid
price and transaction price per unit of time and per unit of resource. To summarize, the
auction benefits can be defined as
uAUi = γuBSi + δuMEC
i . (8)
Where the normalization coefficient of auction revenue of BSs and MECs are defined
as 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1. Additionally, γ + δ = 1.
3.3 Problem formulation
As evident from the above, the system utility of edge cloud resources sharing problem
consists of transmission efficiency and auction benefits. Then, the optimization problem
of system utility is formulated as follows:
max
cijn,pijn,mij ,vBSij ,mik ,vFik ,v
S

I∑
i=1
(
uITi + uAUi
)

H : vFik ≤ csFk ∀i ∈ I,∀k ∈ K
I : vSik ≤ csSk ∀i ∈ I,∀k ∈ K .
Where constraint A indicates that the total amount of allocated bandwidth must be not
more than the maximum bandwidth WBS
j . Constraints B,H and I show that the transac-
tion price vBSij , vFik and v
S
ik should be more than the cost of the resources csBSj , csFk and cs
S
k in
the auction of bandwidth, computation and storage. According to constraint C, one chan-
nel is only allowed to be assigned to one intelligent terminal. Constraint D ensures that
uplink transmission power must be positive and must not exceed the maximum trans-
mission power Pi. Constraint E indicates that the system delay should be less than the
maximum delay dli acceptable by the intelligent terminal i. Constraints F and G guaran-
tee that the total computation and storage resources assigned by the edge cloud must be
less than the maximum edge cloud resources FM
k and SMk . Obviously, this optimization
problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear assignment problem, which is a NP-hard problem.

4 Joint resource allocation of communication and computing based on
auction
Obviously, in order to maximize the utility of resource allocation, we only need to make
the bandwidth auction benefits maximum, the transmission benefits maximum and the
MEC auction benefits maximum. Therefore,the optimization problem is divided into
three dependent sub-problems.
PBS : The first problem is auction-based resources allocation of bandwidth, which can
determine the allocation strategy of bandwidth and the transaction price of bandwidth.
The benefit function can be described as UBS = ∑I
i=1 uBSi .
PIT : Based on the result of the allocation strategy of bandwidth, the joint allocation of
subcarrier and power is decided by UIT = ∑I
i=1 uITi , in which the request computation
f ∗
ik , sub-carrier, and power strategy will be confirmed.
PMEC : The problem of auction-based resources allocation of MEC, which can deter-
mine the allocation strategy and the transaction price ofMEC resources, can be described
as UMEC = ∑I
i=1 uMEC
i , due to the result of the request computation f ∗
ik concluded in
problem UIT .
4.1 Bandwidth allocation
Intelligent terminals apply for bandwidth from all accessible BSs, and the BSs allocate
bandwidth according to the received applications. The optimization problem can be
expressed as:
PBS :
max
mij ,vBSij
UBS (10)
s.t A,B.
From an implementation point of view, the ultimate goal of a business is to get the max-
imum benefit. Therefore, choosing the user with the highest price is the most satisfying
choice for merchants. From the auction point of view, the buyers will give the maximum
price that they are willing to pay for the resources to win the auction. As a consequence, a
greedy algorithm is appropriate to be adopted in the auction, which allocates the highest
price user first, then the second-highest price user, and so on.
As shown in Algorithm 1, for all intelligent terminals i ∈ I, the winning user set is
Iac ⊆ I, BBS
i is the set of bidding prices of bandwidth, the winning transaction price set of
bandwidth is Paci , Wi is the set of the number of bandwidth resources requested, Wac
i is
the allocated bandwidth. δ : {i : i ∈ Iac} → {
i : paci ∈ Paci
}
is the mapping between Iac and
Paci . For all BS j,WBS
j is the maximum bandwidth, and the cost of unit bandwidth is csBSj .
First, sort all the bidding prices of the bandwidth BBS
i in descending order. If the second
highest bidding price is greater than the cost price of the BS request, and the rest of the
resources are enough, then, the terminal who give the highest bidder obtain the resources,
and the bidding price is the second highest price. On the contrary, there is nobody to
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 9 of 23
obtain the resources and the next round of bidding will carry out until the resources is
zero or all the terminals obtain the request resources.

5 Subcarrier and power allocation
The optimization problem of the joint allocation of subcarrier and power can be mathe-
matically formulated as PIT :
max
fik ,cijn,pijn
UIT (11)
s.t C,D,E.
It is obvious that for a given cijn and pijn, PIT is a concave function of fik , correspond to
the constraints E the optimal solution of fik can be obtained as
f ∗
ik = Dirij
dlitexeik rij − Si
. (12)
After the calculation of resources allocation, the problem of PIT can be transformed
into:
PIT1:

) =
I∑

(

) + θ
s.t C,D.
Where θ = αDi
fik − αDi
fi − βuiDi is constant. αSi + ∑N
n=1 βcijnpijnSi is a convex function
of cijn and rij
(
cijn, pijn
)
is a concave function of cijn. Thus, PIT1 is a convex function of cijn.
Nevertheless, the problem PIT1 is mixed-integer nonlinear programming and NP hard.
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 10 of 23
To solve this problem, decompose it into two dependent sub-problems, subcarrier and
power allocation problem.
5.0.1 Subcarrier allocation
For given pijn, relax the integer constraint of cijn ∈ {0, 1} into 0 < cijn < 1 [21]. With
relaxing cijn the problem can be rewritten into
PIT2:
min
cijn
U
(
cijn

s.t Ui
(
cijn
) ≤ γi ∀i ∈ I,∀j ∈ J ,∀n ∈ N∑I
i=1 cijn ≤ 1, 0 < cijn < 1 ∀i ∈ I,∀j ∈ J ,∀n ∈ N .
Define h
(
cijn
) = αSi + ∑N
n=1 βcijnpijnSi. Then Ui
(
cijn
) ≤ γi is equivalent to hi
(
cijn
) −
γirij ≤ 0, with [22], the Lagrangian of PIT2 is
L

Then, according to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, there have
∂L
∂cijn
= μiβpijnSi − μiγirijn + λn − ξin = 0. (16)
∂L

= ξin
(−cijn
) = 0, ξin ≥ 0. (20)
μi, γi, ξin, λn �= {0, 0, 0, 0}. (21)
According to condition (17), μi can be calculated as
μi = 1
rij
. (22)
From condition (18) and (22), γi is
γi = hi

rij
. (23)
Substituting (22)(23) into (16), there has
αSirijn
rij
− λn + ξin = 0. (24)
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 11 of 23
According to KKT condition, if ξin = 0, then cijn > 0. If ξin > 0, then cijn = 0. The KKT
condition λn can be concluded as
λn = αSirijn
r2ij
. (25)
In order to solve the problem, the Lagrange multipliers λn should be maximum, therefore

The detailed procedure is given in Algorithm 2. For all intelligent terminals i ∈ I, the
successful allocated intelligent terminal set is Iac ⊆ I, The set Mi = {m1,m2, ...,mI} is
the number of the requested subcarrier of the intelligent terminal i and Mac
i ⊆ Mi is the
allocated subcarrier. The total number of channels is N. The total number of successful
allocated channel set of the intelligent terminal i is Nac
i ⊆ N . Cijn is the channel capacity
set of intelligent terminal i and BS j and is a two-dimensional array with rows represent
intelligent terminals and columns represent channels, which is defined as
Cijn = {
ci1jn1 , ci1jn2 , ..., ci1jnN ; ci2jn1 , ci2jn2 , ..., ci2jnN ; ...; ciI jn1 , ciI jn2 , ..., ciI jnN
}
The mapping of Cijn, Iac and Nac
i is defined as σ :
{
i, n : cijn ∈ Cijn
} → {i : i ∈ Iac} →{
n : n ∈ Nac
i
}
. First, select the maximum subcarrier capacity in Cijn. If the terminal i with
the largest subcarrier capacity has not been allocated enough channels, allocate the chan-
nel to teminal i, otherwise all the subcarrier capacity in Cijn associated with terminal iwill
be removed from Cijn until all the terminals have been allocated enough channels or all
the subcarriers have been allocated.

5.0.2 Power allocation
After subcarrier allocation, the constraints of each intelligent terminal is independent.
Therefore, the optimization problem can be decomposed into I sub-problems. Each
sub-problem optimizes one intelligent terminal power allocation to minimize intelligent
terminals, own delay. In this paper, for each intelligent terminal, power allocation is
solved via water-filling. Then the power allocation optimization problem of the intelligent
terminal i can be mathematically formulated as

n∈Nij
W log2
(
1 + pijn|hijn|2
σ 2
)
(27)
s.t
∑
n∈Nij
pijn ≤ Pi
pijn ≥ 0, n ∈ Nij.
Obviously, the problem is convex optimization and the Lagrange multiplier method can
be employed to solve the problem, such as

According to the KKT conditions, the optimal solution p∗
ijn can be calculated as

5.1 Resources Allocation of Computation and Storage
The intelligent terminal i requests MEC resources from the adjacent RPS via the BS. The
RPS receives and broadcasts the application in the blockchain platform using the smart
contract. Each RPS who receives the smart contract will deal with the corresponding
application according to the optimization problem as follow

Intelligent terminals will require MEC resources from all the edge clouds or clouds in
the blockchain platform. However, the access network latency, overhead, etc. will be dif-
ferent due to the different locations of the access network and the edge clouds. Therefore,
this paper proposes an improved greedy algorithm, which divides intelligent terminals
into three priorities according to the location of the access network to the edge clouds.
Set the intelligent terminals in the LAN as level 1, in the MAN as level 2, and level 3 in
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 13 of 23
the WAN (the same intelligent terminal has a different priority in different edge clouds).
The resources will be allocated to intelligent terminals with higher priority firstly.

As shown in Algorithm 3, an improved sealed second-price auction is selected. The
intelligent terminal who has the highest bid price will be the successful bidder. The high-
est price with both the computation and storage bid price less than the successful bidder’s
price will be defined as the transaction price. For all intelligent terminals i ∈ I, the win-
ning intelligent terminal set is Ik ⊆ I, set BF
i and BS
i are bidding prices of computation and
storage resources, fi and si are the amount of applied resources of computation and stor-
age, the wining transaction price set of computation and storage resources are PFi and PSi
respectively. For each edge cloud, FM
k and SMk are themaximum provide resources of com-
putation and storage. Fac
k and Sack are the allocated resources of computation and storage,
csFk and csSk are the cost of computation and storage resources. The priority of the intelli-
gent terminal i is defined as πik = 1, 2, 3 πik ∈ �ik . First, calculate the average price of
computing resources and storage resources Bi. Then, sort all the average bidding prices
with different priority πk
i = m in descending order. Then, judge the average bidding
price successively except the highest one, if the computing resources bidding price and
the storage resources bidding price are both greater than the cost price of MEC request,
the price of the computing resources and storage resources will be the transaction price.
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 14 of 23
Meanwhile, if the rest of the resources are enough, then, the terminal who give the high-
est bidder obtain the resources. On the contrary, there is nobody to obtain the resources
and the next round of bidding will carry out until the resources is zero or all the terminals
obtain the resources.
6 Transaction process based on blockchain
It is can be seen from section III that the resource allocation has been completed. In
general, the edge clouds will inform the intelligent terminals’ success in the action to
start transaction processing which will run in the consortium blockchain network. The
blockchain platform architecture of MEC resources sharing is shown as Fig. 2.
The blockchain is composed of RPS, third-party spectrum and computation man-
agement, identity authentication institutions, etc. It is running by smart contracts and
adopt the Solo ordering service to attain a consensus. And there are four layers in the
system such as the application layer, interface layer, blockchain layer, and PHY layer.
Where the application layer is the applications that the blockchain platform applied to
the intelligent terminals, and the intelligent terminals call the code of the interface layer
to access the blockchain database. The blockchain layer takes the charge of member man-
agement, transaction management, and contract management. Specifically, the member
management mainly focuses on the identity authentication and permission management
of resources proposer to ensure the security and credibility of access users, including
the registration, authentication, authorization, cryptography and mathematical signa-
ture, etc. Transaction management mainly guarantees the secure and orderly transactions
between the two parties of resources allocation and records the transaction data to the
global ledger, including the content of blockmanagement and consensusmechanism. Fur-
thermore, contract management mainly refers to adding the involved resources request,
resource allocation, delivery monitoring, etc. into the network in the form of code and
running automatically. Ultimately, the PHY layer consists of edge clouds RPS and clouds
RPS.
Fig. 2 Blockchain platform architecture
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 15 of 23
As evident from above, the transaction information will be written to the global ledger
in the blockchain platform. According to the trading characteristics, there are two meth-
ods to deal with the transactions: offline and online trading model. For some real-time
and high-frequency trading, the offline tradingmodel is selected, otherwise, online. In the
following content, the online and offline trading models are described in detail. Finally, a
delivery monitoring module is designed to detect the nodes which are unable to provide
service due to attack or other reason.
6.1 Online trading model
The online transaction model process is shown in Fig. 3. The seller uses a different
account for each transaction to protect the privacy and sends the intelligent terminals’
account to the buyer. Then, the buyer creates a transaction via RPS, and eventually
sends the transaction to the blockchain platform. The blockchain platform will verify the
transaction and write the legal transaction into the global ledger. Once the correspond-
ing transaction is recorded in the global ledger the payment is completed. The buyer
will receive information about the complement of writing the global ledger from the
blockchain. Then, the buyer sends the transaction ID to the seller. If the transaction with
the accurate account and amount is notarized by the seller, the seller will begin to provide
services [23].
In the proposed payment mechanism, the payment execution is actually the process
of writing transactions into the global ledger as shown in Fig. 4 based on Hyperledger
Fabric 1.0. The buyer creates and sends transactions to the SDK (Software Development
Kit). Then, the transactions will be sent to the endorser to execute and the output will be
recorded in the response. Once, the SDK has collected enough correct responses of the
proposal, the transactions will be submitted to the order peer. The order peer uses a plug-
gable consensus protocol to produce a totally ordered sequence of endorsed transactions
in blocks and broadcasts the blocks to the committer peer. The committer peer will write
the block to the global ledger and inform all other peers to synchronize the new block.

Fig. 4 Process of writing transaction into the global ledger
6.2 Offline tradingmodel
In this paper, the offline payment mechanism is designed using the lightning network.
The idea of the lightning network is the establishment of the trading management system
using smart contracts, but it does not belong to the blockchain system [24]. Both coun-
terparts in the executive system will store and manage the deposit until they want to close
the account. The offline payment process is shown in Fig. 5.
The buyer and seller create a ledger entry (bidirectional payment channels) in the
blockchain, which requires both participants to sign off on any spending of funds. Both
participants pre-deposit a certain amount of money in the ledger entry. If a transaction
comes up, the buyer creates a transaction to reallocate the money in the ledger entry and
sends the transaction to the seller with the signature itself without broadcasting them to
the blockchain. In the same way, the seller who receives the transaction sends the corre-
sponding reallocated transaction to the buyer with the signature of the seller and does not
broadcast the transaction to the blockchain too. Then, the seller will provide services to
the buyer. They can update their reallocated transactions in the ledger entry when another
payment occurs. This entry can be closed out by broadcasting the most recent version
transaction to the blockchain at any time by either party without any trust.
6.3 Delivery monitoring module
The authentication mechanism of blockchain ensures that the intelligent terminals join-
ing the blockchain platform are reliable. However, when some nodes are attacked and
cannot provide services normally, a detection mechanism is needed to find the wicked
nodes and inform other nodes in the blockchain. Then, the node should be removed
from the blockchain system. If the node wants to rejoin the system, it needs to apply for
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 17 of 23
Fig. 5 The offline payment process
authentication again. The process of the resource delivery detection mechanism is shown
in Fig. 6.
If both actors (intelligent terminals and edge clouds) have completed their task, they will
send a proof of activity to the delivery monitoring blockchain. For example, the delivery
monitoring blockchain will receive three proofs in one transaction. First, the intelligent
terminals will publish a proof of payment completion, when the payment is accomplished.
In a similar way, proof of the service completion will be published, when intelligent ter-
minals receive the processing results of the applied task. Meanwhile, the edge clouds will
publish a proof of data processing completion to the delivery monitoring blockchain also.
Once all the proofs are collected, the transaction will be closed. If the contract detects
that any party has not fulfilled its duty, the node will be removed.

blockchain platform, and adopt the Solo ordering service to attain a consensus with 2MB
block size to implement the paymentmechanism. There are ten peers, one order peer, and
a CA (Certificate Authority) in the environment as shown in Fig. 7. The peer represents
the cloud and the order peer uses a Solo consensus protocol to produce a totally ordered
sequence of endorsed transactions in blocks and broadcasts the blocks to the other peer.
The Simulation environment parameter is shown in Table 1.
Fig. 9 The resources utilization rate in one auction
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 20 of 23
In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of the
successfully allocated number of intelligent terminals and the resource utilization rate in
one auction compared with DPDA which is dynamic pricing based on the double auc-
tion. Figure 8 compares the number of successfully allocated intelligent terminals in one
auction with 10 edge clouds and 100 intelligent terminals. The number of intelligent
terminals allocated successfully in one auction using the proposed algorithm is much
Fig. 10 Individually rationale of the proposed algorithm
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing         (2021) 2021:26 Page 21 of 23
higher than that using the DPDA algorithm. Because the resources of intelligent termi-
nals applied aren’t enough locally. In the proposed algorithm, intelligent terminals can
apply for resources from all other edge clouds instead of applying for resources from a
few of edge clouds. Hence, the successful number of allocated intelligent terminals using
the proposed algorithm is significantly higher than using DPDA.
Figure 9 compares the resources utilization rate using the proposed algorithm and
DPDA with 100 intelligent terminals and 10 edge clouds. Figure 9 illustrates that the
resource utilization rate using the proposed algorithm is much higher than using DPDA
under the condition of lacking resources locally. Both Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate that the
resources are fully shared and the utilization rate of the resources is effectively improved
in the resources shortage scenario.
To verify the individually rational of the proposed algorithm in Definition 3.1, Fig. 10a
compares the bid and transaction prices of winning buyers, and Fig. 10b shows the trans-
action prices and costs of winning sellers under the constraint of 10 edge clouds and 10
intelligent terminals. Clearly, each winning buyer receives a transaction price less than its
bid and each winning seller receives a transaction price higher than its cost. Therefore,
the proposed algorithm is individually rational.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a sharing model of computation and storage resources among
edge clouds based on blockchain and auction game. Instead of having to apply for
resources from the cloud when local edge clouds cannot meet the demand of intelligent
terminals, the intelligent terminals will apply for resources from all the edge clouds par-
ticipate in the blockchain platform. Therefore, the resources among the edge clouds are
efficient sharing, and the resource utilization rate can be significantly increased. In the
follow-up work, depth research on resource sharing of the edge cloud will be researched
combining with the benefit of intelligent terminals and edge clouds using the transaction
information stored in the blockchain.
