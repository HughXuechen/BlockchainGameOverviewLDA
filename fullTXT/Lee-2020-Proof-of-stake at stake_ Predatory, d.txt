ABSTRACT
There have been several 51% attacks on Proof-of-Work (PoW)
blockchains recently, including Verge and GameCredits, but the
most noteworthy has been the attack that saw hackers make off
with up to $18 million after a successful double-spend was executed
on the Bitcoin Gold network. For this reason, the Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) algorithm, which already has advantages of energy efficiency
and throughput, is attracting attention as an alternative to the PoW
algorithm. With a PoS, the attacker needs to obtain 51% of the cryp-
tocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. But unlike PoW, the attacker
in a PoS system is highly discouraged from launching a 51% attack
because he would have to risk losing his entire stake amount to do
so. Moreover, even if a 51% attack succeeds, the value of PoS-based
cryptocurrency will fall, and the attacker with the most stake will
eventually lose the most. In this paper, we propose a predatory,
destructive attack on PoS cryptocurrencies. The attacker destroys
the PoS cryptocurrency system. Then, using the significant depre-
ciation of cryptocurrency, our method can make a profit from a
51% attack on the PoS cryptocurrencies using the traditional stock
market’s short selling (or shorting) concept. Our findings are an
example to show that the conventional myth that “a destructive
attack that destroys the blockchain ecosystem totally will not occur
because it is fundamentally unprofitable to the attacker itself" may
be wrong.

1 INTRODUCTION
The 51% attack controlling more than half of the total hashing
power of a network is a technique which intends to fork a Proof-
of-Work (PoW) blockchain in order to conduct double-spending.
Due to the immense attacking cost to perform the 51% attack, it
was considered very unlikely for a long period. However, in recent
times, the attack has befallen at a frequent pace, costing millions
of dollars to various PoW-based cryptocurrencies such as Verge,
GameCredits, Bitcoin Gold, and so on.
For this reason, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, which al-
ready has advantages of energy efficiency and throughput, is at-
tracting attention as an alternative to the PoW algorithm. PoS was
first created in 2012 by two developers called Scott Nadal and Sunny
King, and the first-ever blockchain project to use the PoS model
was Peercoin. PoS is a category of consensus algorithms for public
blockchains that depend on a validator’s economic stake in the net-
work. While PoW rewards its miner for solving complex equations,
in PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum’s Casper implemen-
tation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the
next block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the
size of their deposit (i.e. stake).
With a PoS, the attacker needs to obtain 51% of the cryptocur-
rency to carry out a 51% attack. But unlike PoW, an attacker in
a PoS system is highly discouraged from launching 51% attack
because he would have to risk of depreciation of his entire stake
amount to do so. In comparison, a bad actor in a PoW system
will not lose their expensive mining equipment if he launches a
51% attack. Moreover, even if a 51% attack succeeds, the value
of PoS-based cryptocurrency will fall, and the attacker with
the most stake will eventually lose the most. For these reasons,
those who attempt to attack 51% of the PoS blockchain will not
be easily motivated. In “A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy
[2]", Vitalik Buterin described these characteristics as the following:
“The one-sentence philosophy of proof of stake is thus not security
comes from burning energy, but rather security comes from putting
up economic value-at-loss.”
In this paper, we will analyze the 51% attack on the PoS
blockchain more precisely. Through this, we will show that even
51% of attacks on PoS blockchain can fully benefit the attacker,
and if the attack is not properly handled, the entire PoS blockchain
ecosystem may be destroyed. Predatory shorting attacks in the con-
ventional finance area are studied in Liu [8], Brunnermeier et al. [1].
Their studies showed how shorting makes a failure in financial insti-
tutions by aggravating uncertainty. Not like them, our attack model

makes PoS cryptocurrencies failure by undermining the system
itself. Our contributions are summarized as the following:
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sophisticated
analysis on the profitability of the 51% attacker in PoS envi-
ronment.
• We propose a new attacker model, “short selling attack" or
“shorting attack”, against PoS-based cryptocurrency using
the traditional stock market’s short selling (or shorting)
concept.
This paper is organized as follows. We introduce a simple
PoS-based cryptocurrency model in section 2. Based on this model,
we propose a profitable 51% attacker model using shorting in
section 3, and discuss the limitations and the future directions of
our work in section 4. The conclusions are shown in section 5.
2 POS MODEL
In this section, we show our PoS cryptocurrency model. We call
our cryptocurrency model as ‘SimPoS’ and coin of it as ‘SimPoS
coin’ if we need in this paper. It is modeled by referring PPCoin
[6], Ethereum [9] and Ouroboros [5], and implements the basic
philosophy of PoS that stakeholders have the right to produce
blocks in proportion to staking. According to this philosophy, one
block generator is elected proportionally to the amount of stake for
each epoch. For simplicity, the cryptocurrency creates six blocks
during an epoch. It does not have the policy to punish or slash rule
breakers’ stake. Thus, it is a pure implementation of Proof-of-Stake.
SimPoS comprises four steps which are genesis, stake evaluation,
ballot, and block generation as the following description. And it is
also illustrated as a state machine in Figure 1. For reference, in our
model, there is no punishment to the block generator’s stake even
if it does not behave correctly.
Figure 1: PoS Model
Step 1. (Genesis) The genesis block is created. And the first
block creates the first coins to the first address.
Step 2. (Stake Evaluation) The total staking score is updated
for every participant. The staked coins cannot be spent for three
months, and valid for the ballot process (Step 3) for three months.
Step 3. (Ballot) Based on the previous stake evaluation, the
next block generator during one epoch is elected by the probability
proportional to the participants’ stake.
Step 4. (Block Generation) In this step, a participant who is
elected as a block generator in the previous ballot process generates
six blocks. The new six blocks contain a mathematical signature of
the block generator so that the network can check their validity.
3 SHORT SELLING ATTACK
In this section, we introduce the traditional stock market’s
short selling (or shorting) concept, which is a method to bet on
depreciation. Then, we propose a new predatory, destructive
51% attack, named ‘short selling (or shorting) attack’, in PoS
cryptocurrencies.
3.1 Short Selling Concept
Figure 2: Short selling cases
In general cases, if a person owns some stock and its value falls,
he will have to lose money. However, there are several ways to
benefit from this downside. We can handle the risk of decline of
prices by ‘short selling’ and ‘derivatives’, including ‘futures’ and
‘options’. For the convenience of explanation, this paper describes
only the short selling and proposes an attack model using short
selling.
Definition 1. (Short Selling) The short selling (as known as
a short sale, short, or shorting) is a fairly simple concept — an
investor borrows a stock, sells the stock, and then buys the stock
back to return it to the lender. Short sellers are betting that the
stock they sell will drop in price. If the stock does drop after selling,
the short seller buys it back at a lower price and returns it to the
lender. The difference between the selling price and the buying
price is the profit.
According to the short selling strategy of Definition 1, the seller
sells the borrowed asset at the market price. Then, the seller should
repurchase the asset to the lender as much as the seller borrowed
for some time. During the time interval, the market price of the
asset changes. If the market price of the asset decreased during the
time interval, the short seller profits. Conversely, if not, the short
selling results in a loss. The maximum profit of the short selling
is the market price at the time the seller borrows the asset. The
maximum loss of short selling is theoretically unlimited. In general,

the market requires a short seller to make a deposit to cover the
loss.
There are two kinds of short selling. One is ‘short selling’, and
the other is ‘naked short selling’. The short selling is what we
already described above. In the naked short selling, the seller sells
an asset without borrowing an asset. After a set time, the seller
should deliver the asset share to the market. The naked short selling
is regulated in some markets.
Like the traditional stock market, some cryptocurrency ex-
changes, like Bitmex, also provide the short selling function to
clients. Furthermore, some exchanges offer a strong feature, mar-
gin trading, to maximize gains and losses of participants. Margin
trading is a method to trade assets using funds borrowed by a third
party. If a person uses margin trading in short selling, he can make
multiplied effects of short selling.
Table 1 shows a list of cryptocurrency exchanges that provide
their features and margin trading capability. In the table, Volume
indicates the volume of traded coins in 24 hours, Derivatives indi-
cates if an exchange provides any kinds of derivatives including
options and futures, and Margin Trading indicates how much mar-
gin leverage an exchange provides.
Notice that this table does not list all active exchanges that sup-
port short selling, and we did not test transactions in them to
make sure they actually function. We got data on the listed ex-
changes in October 2019 by referring to the Coin Market Capital
and CoinGecko. For reference, CoinOne once offered public sales
and margin trading on the Korean bourse, but that function was
suspended due to the legal issues of Korea.
Based on the environment of exchanges and simplicity, we as-
sume the 51% attacker uses a cryptocurrency exchange which pro-
vides the naked short selling function, and it has big enough asset
supply.
3.2 A Predatory, Destructive But Profitable 51%
Attack On PoS Cryptocurrencies
We name our new attack strategy “short selling (or shorting)
attack". It is based on two ideas. The first is that shorting makes a
profit from the loss of market value. And, the second is that the
ratio of staked coins to owned coins is limited because of financial
liquidity. So the attacker does not need to own 51% of the total
Table 1: Cryptocurrency exchanges with short selling

amount of coins. He only needs to own 51% of the mean staking
ratio of the total amount of coins.
Definition 2. (Short Selling (or Shorting) Attack) The short
selling (or shorting) attack is a kind of 51% attack in PoS-based
cryptocurrencies. After achieving 51% stake, the attacker sabotages
the system with any methods right after short selling a massive
amount of the cryptocurrency for profit.
The attack strategy is three-step. Figure 3 shows attack
steps with time flow, T0 - T3. The attacker’s target is SimPoS
which is introduced in Section 2. Before the attack, we assume
that the attacker makes stakes over 51% of the total stake at time T0.
Assumption 1. The cryptocurrency system’s value is on
the functionality of transactions
Let the amount of the staked coins of the attacker be 𝐴.
Step 1. (Short Selling) The attacker shorts coins in a market at
time T1. Let the amount of the short selling be 𝐵.
Figure 3: Attack diagram with time flow

Step 2. (Sabotage) The attacker commits sabotage to the cryp-
tocurrency system. For simplicity, the attacker generates empty
blocks continuously from time T2.
We assume the value of the cryptocurrency system is based
on the functionality of decentralized cryptocurrency transactions
rather than long term saving or investment. Therefore, people do
not need to keep SimPoS coins in their wallets anymore. Then, the
market value of SimPoS coin declines steeply. If people believe that
SimPoS will not work anymore, its market value will decline to
nearly zero. Let’s the depreciation ratio from time T2 to T3 be Δ.
Step 3. (Buyback) At time T3, the attacker buys SimPoS coins
to deliver to the market for shorted coins.
As a result, the attacker gains Δ · (𝐵 −𝐴). To be profitable, The
short amount of 𝐵 should be more significant than 𝐴. For reference,
the attacker can gain a short amount of 𝐵 not only by owning
the cash corresponding to the market value of 𝐵 coins but also
by using the margin trading. We can see historical Δ values in
the previous security accidents in Table 2. Even though we add a
slashing policy removing rule breakers’ coins into our model, the
attacker model can be profitable if depreciation by the attack is
big enough. Furthermore, the attacker already became the majority
and generates only empty blocks. It means others’ cannot stake
anymore. The attacker can keep the majority stake and keep the
attack until stakeholders gave up SimPoS and it results in great
depreciation.

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Short Selling Can Be Combined
Our attack is not only available by the short selling but also by
futures and options. The futures, options, and swaps discussed here
are just the classic products, called plain vanilla, of derivatives. In
theory, almost infinite forms of derivatives may exist. We are not
yet sure whether the cryptocurrency will remain safe even among
these various derivatives. All we can say is that cryptocurrencies
are secure only under very limited conditions. In economics, it
is called ‘Ceteris Paribus’. In Korea, Coinone, one of the biggest
cryptocurrency exchanges, has been abolished the short selling and
the margin trading system due to state policy. In this case, people
should consider the exchange level to restrict such derivatives, but
nobody knows whether these restrictions are in the right direction
for the decentralized cryptocurrencies.
4.2 Social Cost & Punishment
Social costs and punishment policies can cause disadvantages to our
method. In this paper, our work’s scope was limited to the economic
costs in the simple PoS model. At first, Buterin’s optimistic outlook
was based on the perspective that the 51% attack would include
social costs as well as economic costs. For example, the situation
that blockchain nodes revert the context before 51% attacks can
happen. Though it is not regulated in the consensus mechanism,
it will be a cost to the attacker. Secondly, PoS is getting robust to
attacks with punishment policies [3, 4]. Blockchain participants can
make rules that regulates nullification of all of the attacker-related
assets (beyond slashing) and even the restriction of attacker-related
funds on the exchange. Then, it would decrease the revenue of our
attack methodology. These two perspectives should be included in
future work to construct a comprehensive model.
5 CONCLUSIONS
The rationale behind PoS is that entities who hold a stake in the
system are well-suited to maintain its security since their stake
will diminish in value when the security of the system erodes.
Thus, we have believed that a 51% attack that does not benefit
anyone, including attackers, will not happen on the PoS blockchain
until now. In this paper, however, we showed that a 51% attack
on the PoS blockchain could benefit the attacker sufficiently by
using short selling. Our findings will be an example to show that
the conventional myth that “a destructive attack that wrecks the
blockchain ecosystem will not occur because it is fundamentally
unprofitable to the attacker itself" may be wrong.
