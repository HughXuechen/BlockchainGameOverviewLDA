Evolutionary game 
study on the governance 
and development of online 
car‑hailing based on blockchain 
technology
Xiaoyu Wan, Jia Liu* & Siqi Zhao
Changes in the online car‑hailing industry have brought new challenges to government governance. 
Effectively enhancing governance efficiency has become the focus of academic research. Based on 
the technical governance perspective, this paper introduces the consortium blockchain to construct 
an evolutionary game model between the online car‑hailing platform and the government under 
blockchain technology. By solving the replicated dynamic equations and the Jacobian matrix, the 
influences of the change in initial conditions and decision parameters on the evolutionary stability 
results are revealed, and numerical experiments are carried out by using the Python programming 
language. This paper claims that the system presents three evolutionary stable results and a periodic 
stochastic state when the key parameters are located in different thresholds. The additional cost of 
the platform’s negative regulation and the government’s punishment intensity have a positive effect 
on the evolution of the system to the ideal state (active regulation, active governance). Platform 
technology R&D cost and government innovation input have a negative effect on the evolution of the 
system to the ideal state. Therefore, using blockchain to increase the additional cost of the platform’s 
negative regulation, appropriately increasing the government’s punishment intensity, reasonably 
controlling the government’s innovation input to the platform, and reducing the technology R&D cost 
of the platform will help the system evolve into an ideal state. This paper provides useful references to 
implement effective governance and the innovative and healthy development of the online car‑hailing 
industry.
As a product of the integration of traditional travel and next-generation information technology, online car-hail-
ing has been rapidly developed by satisfying customers’ personalised travel needs at a lower  cost1. It has become 
one of the best choices for public travel. In November 2021, a total of 255 online car-hailing platforms in China 
were licenced for  operation2. In December 2021, the number of online car-hailing customers in China reached 
453  million3. The online car-hailing industry has shown explosive growth, with great development prospects and 
market value. However, the potential safety hazards of the online car-hailing industry also frequently  occur4–7. 
From the customer perspective, drivers and passengers may face moral hazard, opportunism and other issues 
due to asymmetric information and incomplete  contracts8,9. From a platform perspective, a centralised online 
car-hailing platform may have potential unreliable issues, such as illegally tampering with data and illegally col-
lecting users’  privacy10. Therefore, the regulation and governance of the online car-hailing industry has become 
the focus of academic research.
Many scholars have carried out research on the regulation and governance of online car-hailing and have 
presented multiple paths of online car-hailing governance from the perspectives of legal norms, public manage-
ment, and governance model design. Specific governance modes include policy and regulation  formulation11,12, 
experimental  regulation13, third-party  regulation14, government-led  regulation6, platform self-regulation15,16, 
and multi-subject collaborative  governance8,9,15. These governance modes have effectively regulated the online 
car-hailing industry to a certain extent. However, the existing research is more focused on suggestions from the

perspective of governance by participants and few scholars propose solutions from the perspective of technical 
governance. The online car-hailing industry was created on the internet, and its operation and development are 
based on internet technology. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how to improve the governance efficiency of 
the online car-hailing industry from a technical perspective. At the same time, the centralisation problem of 
online car-hailing is serious, resulting in information asymmetry between the platform, the government and 
the customers. The complaint channel of customers is not smooth, and the feedback is not timely. All of these 
factors will affect the governance effect of the  platform4,6,17.
Facing the regulatory dilemma of online car-hailing, the development of blockchain technology injects 
new vitality into its governance  work18,19. With the advantages of decentralisation, openness, transparency, 
cryptographic property, tamper-proofing and immutability, blockchain technology can realise functions, such 
as depository, credit enhancement and authentication, providing security for the collaboration of transaction 
 parties20,21. Building a consortium blockchain composed of an online car-hailing platform, drivers, customers 
and government regulators enables safe and credible data sharing among participants, thereby reducing informa-
tion asymmetry among all parties. Ultimately, by providing technical credit enhancement support for the online 
car-hailing industry, blockchain resolves the trust issues of multiple  stakeholders22–24.
Based on the technical governance perspective, blockchain technology is introduced as the governing measure 
of online car-hailing. This paper constructs an evolutionary game model between the online car-hailing platform 
and the government through blockchain by using evolutionary game theory and correlated knowledge and dis-
cusses the factors that influence the strategic choices of online car-hailing platform regulation and government 
governance within the blockchain technology environment. On the basis of improving the level of government 
governance, the innovative and healthy development of the online car-hailing industry can be realised. This 
paper makes the following contributions. (1) From a technical governance perspective, this paper reveals the 
internal mechanism of behaviour evolution between the platform and the government to a certain extent and 
verifies the rationality of the results through numerical experiments. (2) This paper shows that the introduction 
of blockchain technology can effectively improve the governance efficiency of the online car-hailing industry, 
which provides new ideas for the governance and the development of this industry.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. “Literature reviews” reviews the related literature. “Model 
construction” constructs an evolutionary game model between the online car-hailing platform and the govern-
ment through no-blockchain technology. “Blockchain-based model construction” constructs an evolutionary 
game model between the online car-hailing platform and the government through blockchain technology and

Literature reviews
Online car‑hailing governance. Online car-hailing is an emerging form of the sharing economy that 
uses idle vehicles to accept orders through the internet to provide travel services. To promote the healthy and 
sustainable development of the online car-hailing industry, scholars have discussed the regulation and govern-
ance of online car-hailing. Some scholars have suggested that though affected by the traditional taxi industry 
regulatory model, the governance measures of the Chinese government are relatively simple, and the govern-
ance framework is not suitable for the emerging online car-hailing  industry15,16,25. This is mainly reflected in the 
deviations in the formulation and implementation of regulatory  policies26. Therefore, government regulators 
need to explore more flexible and diverse regulation measures and improve governance resources, channels and 
links to achieve a good connection with the regulation of online car-hailing  platforms13,17,18.
With the theme of improving the regulatory governance system, scholars have carried out analyses based on 
different research perspectives. With the goal of minimising welfare loss, Zhen constructed a control model for 
the quantity and price of online car-hailing based on two-sided market theory and concluded that the quantity 
control policy and the price control policy can effectively reduce the negative externalities of the online car-
hailing  industry11. In this regard, Wang asserted through theoretical analysis that quantity control is not in line 
with the purpose of saving social resources under the sharing economy model, and it is not appropriate to limit 
price control when the car level is high and the customer’s willingness to pay is high. The cooperative regulation 
mode of “the government governs the platform, and the platform regulates drivers and vehicles” can achieve 
more effective  governance27. Li et al. verified the feasibility of this cooperative regulation model by constructing a 
tripartite game between the government, the online car-hailing platform and the taxi  industry28. To better realise 
collaborative regulation, some scholars have claimed that government regulators should take the opportunity of 
the three-stream coupling of politics, policy and problem, comprehensively consider factors, such as the govern-
ment’s multiple motivations, customer service demand and the interest of the taxi industry, and finally carry 
out policy innovations according to local and time  conditions12,29,30. After that, some scholars supplemented the 
regulation system. Wang et al. used process-tracking methods to sort out and summarise the development process 
of China’s online car-hailing industry from 2014 to 2018 and proposed an agile regulatory model characterised 
by a “challenge-response”6. Fu and Shi constructed an evolutionary game model between government regula-
tors and the online car-hailing platform and verified the effectiveness of third-party regulation by introducing 
media  coverage14,31. By sorting out the representative studies on online car-hailing governance (see Table 1), it 
was found that the existing research mainly focuses on theoretical analysis, and there are relatively few studies 
on quantitative analysis of online car-hailing governance based on mathematical models. In addition, previous 
studies have proposed solutions from the perspective of governance by participants, and few scholars have carried 
out research on online car-hailing governance from the perspective of technical governance.

Blockchain technology. To solve the trust issues in network transactions, Satoshi Nakamoto developed 
and proposed blockchain technology. It is a digitalised ledger that integrates technologies such as consensus 
algorithms, encryption algorithms and smart contracts, which record transaction data in block form in chrono-
logical order and store them in a distributed manner in the  network32. As a distributed encrypted database with 
a decentralised consensus mechanism, blockchain combines the technical characteristics of openness, transpar-
ency, security and reliability, traceability, decentralisation, tamper-proofing and  immutability23,33. It guarantees 
secure transactions between untrusted nodes or parties by providing a complete security  solution20. According 
to the differences in data management and read permissions of transaction subjects, blockchain can be divided 
into public blockchain, private blockchain and consortium  blockchain34. Among them, the public blockchain 
has no central authority, and anyone can participate in the process of obtaining  consensus32. The private block-
chain is created by a single organisation or individual, the management permission is strictly controlled by the 
creator, and the read permission is finitely open to the  public34. The consortium blockchain is an amalgamation 
of public and private blockchains. It is composed of multiple organisations with cooperative relationships. The 
permissions of members are formulated according to the rules of the  consortium32,34. This paper is dedicated 
to introducing a consortium blockchain that is jointly maintained by the online car-hailing platform, drivers, 
customers and government regulators, which can not only meet the needs of different participants but also meet 
the regulatory requirements of all parties. Due to its unique technological advantages, blockchain has been 
widely used by scholars to conduct in-depth research in many fields, such as smart  cities20, sharing  economy23, 
public  administration35, health  care36 and energy  trading37. Almost all industries need an honest, reliable and 
trustworthy environment as a prerequisite for healthy and sustainable development. Blockchain creates trust for 
transaction subjects through mathematical principles rather than using third-party regulation. By maintaining 
the security, transparency and consistency of the ledgers among the subjects, the information asymmetry of the 
participants can be effectively  reduced16,17,37.
Evolutionary game theory. Evolutionary game theory originated from Darwin’s theory of evolution, 
which emphasises the bounded rationality of game players and the dynamic changes of the game process. Spe-
cifically, it means that players with bounded rationality cannot reach a stable equilibrium state at one time. 
They need to learn by replicated dynamic mechanisms and undergo long-term dynamic adjustments, eventu-
ally reaching an equilibrium state during  evolution38,39. Evolutionary game theory can truly reflect the diversity 
and complexity of the behaviour of economic  agents38, so it is widely used in the field of multi-participant col-
laborative governance. Zhou et al. constructed and discussed a tripartite evolutionary game model of sewage 
enterprises, governments and the public, and made suggestions for environmental pollution  control40. Yang 
et al. constructed an evolutionary game model composed of local government, food enterprises and the public

for analysis, aiming to reduce the hidden safety issues in the food  market41. Qi et al. constructed an evolutionary 
game model between the “Internet Big V” and the official media and then introduced a punishment mechanism 
and coordination mechanism for government departments, aiming to realise the proper handling of emergen-
cies and the effective governance of network public  opinion42. Evolutionary game theory has been a part of many 
governance studies in various fields, but there are few studies on the governance and development of online 
car-hailing based on evolutionary game theory. In essence, the governance of online car-hailing is a dynamic 
game problem that involves multiple parties and evolves over time. Participants constantly adjust their strategies 
through confrontation, dependence and constraints before finally reaching a state of  equilibrium43. Therefore, 
evolutionary game theory provides a scientific analysis paradigm for this paper. In this paper, it is necessary to 
analyse the interaction mechanism of government governance and platform regulation from the perspective of 
dynamic evolution and to reveal the universal laws of the governance and the development of the online car-
hailing industry.
Model construction
Model assumptions. In this paper, we consider that platforms and governments are bounded rational, 
and they usually make incomplete rational strategic choices through incomplete  information44. In the context 
of incomplete information, the platform can choose active regulation, meaning that the platform consciously 
abides by industry regulations, strictly scrutinises illegal drivers, and makes full use of the blockchain to build 
a trust system. The platform can also choose negative regulation, meaning that the platform is not strict in the 
scrutinisation of driver qualifications and vehicle standards. The platform negatively responds to the regulatory 
responsibilities and only addresses problems superficially. The government can choose active governance, mean-
ing that the government fines the platform for negative regulation. The government provides technical subsidies 
and formulates preferential policies to encourage the healthy development of the online car-hailing industry. The 
government can also choose negative governance, meaning that the government regulator has neglected its duty 
and has not strictly dealt with the illegal behaviour of the platform. The government does not provide financial 
subsidies for innovative behaviours in the online car-hailing industry. On this basis, this paper employs an 
evolutionary game to analyse the payoff matrix for both players, where the strategic space for platform is (active 
regulation x , negative regulation 1− x ) and for government is (active governance y , negative governance 1− y).
Hypothesis 1. The basic revenue of the platform is R . When the platform chooses active regulation, it pays 
operating cost C2 (the cost of scrutinising driver qualifications and vehicle standards, etc.), and generates social 
welfare S for the public to create a safe and civilised travel environment. When the platform chooses negative 
regulation, it causes social welfare losses L (the loss of customer benefits and governance benefits and impacts 
other industries, etc.). For this, the government that chooses active governance imposes fine f  on the platform, 
and f > C2 ; otherwise, the platform has no incentive to choose active regulation.
Hypothesis 2. When the government chooses active governance, it invests a great deal of governance cost 
C1 (manpower, time and material costs, etc.) to strictly control and rectify the online car-hailing industry, and 
C1 > f  . The governance cost is higher than the fine imposed on the platform that chooses negative regulation.
On this basis, we derive the payoff matrix of the platform and the government, as presented in Table 2.
Evolutionary stability analysis. According to Table 2, when the platform chooses active regulation, the 
expected revenue Ex1 is as follows:
When the platform chooses active regulation, the expected revenue Ex2 is as follows:
The average expected revenue Ex  of the platform is as follows:
Similarly, the average expected revenue Ey  of the government is as follows:
According to Malthusian dynamic equation theory, we obtain the replicated dynamic equations of the plat-
form and the government, and they are calculated as follows:
(1)Ex1 = y(R − C2)+
(

)
(R − C2) = R − C2

We calculate the replicated dynamic equations of the platform and the government when F(x) = 0 and 
F
(
y
)
= 0 . Then, the five local equilibrium points of the platform and the government strategic choices can be 
calculated as N1(0, 0) , N2(0, 1) , N3(1, 0) , N4(1, 1) , and N5
(
x∗, y∗
)
 , where x∗ =
f−C1
f  and y∗ = C2
f .
The local equilibrium point calculated by the replicated dynamic equation is not necessarily the evolutionarily 
stable result of the game system. Therefore, according to the Jacobian matrix solution method in  Friedman43, we 
calculate the Jacobian matrix of the game system as follows:
When the Jacobian matrix meets detJ > 0 and trJ < 0 , the local equilibrium point of the replicated dynamic 
equation is the ESS point. At the same time, since the solution of the evolutionary game is a strict Nash equi-
librium in this paper, we only discuss the first four points. The results of evolutionary stability analysis of the 
platform and the government are shown in Table 3.
According to Table 3, without the introduction of blockchain, only one local equilibrium point in the game 
system between the platform and the government is stable. That is,  N1(0,0) is the only ESS point. The implica-
tion of this ESS is that the online car-hailing platform chooses negative regulation and the government chooses 
negative governance. This strategy is not conducive to the healthy development of the online car-hailing industry 
and is a negative state of mutual inaction between the platform and the government.
Blockchain‑based model construction
Model assumptions. Hypothesis 1. Blockchain technology can improve the safety, synergy and efficiency 
of online car-hailing, and further enhance the efficiency of urban transportation systems. According to the inno-
vation maturity theory proposed by Jay Paap and Ralph  Katz45, we set technical efficiency as P = TC3 , where T 
is the blockchain technology maturity, and C3 is the R&D investment for the platform to introduce blockchain 
technology.
Hypothesis 2. The basic revenue of the platform is R. When the platform chooses active regulation, it pays 
operating cost C2 and technology R&D cost C3 and generates social welfare S ; when the platform chooses nega-
tive regulation, it causes social welfare losses L . In the case of the introduction of blockchain, the platform’s 
negative regulation pays high additional cost d (the cost of data tampering and information fabrication, loss of 
reputation, etc.).
Hypothesis 3. When the government chooses active governance, it pays total governance cost C consisting 
of fixed governance cost and marginal governance cost. Blockchain technology reduces the risk of informa-
tion asymmetry by reducing the probability of information distortion, thereby effectively reducing the cost of 
governance. Therefore, blockchain technology has a certain degree of substitution with governance. The higher 
blockchain technology maturity is, the lower the marginal governance cost is. We set the total governance cost 
as C = C1 + (1− T)/k , where C1 is the fixed governance cost and k is a constant representing the governance 
capacity.
Hypothesis 4. When the government chooses active governance, it encourages the online car-hailing industry 
to introduce blockchain for innovative development by increasing investment, providing financial subsidies, and 
introducing relevant policies. These inputs are set as government innovation input F . In addition, the government 
imposes fine f  on the platform that chooses negative regulation.
On this basis, we derive the payoff matrix of the platform and the government under blockchain technology, 
presented in Table 4.
Evolutionary stability analysis. According to Table 4, when the platform chooses active regulation, the 
expected revenue Ex1 is as follows:

Platform evolutionary stability analysis. The choice of evolutionary stability strategy usually depends on the 
initial state of both players. When y = y0 , x is stable at any level of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 , as shown in Fig. 1a. When y  = y0 , 
x∗ = 0 and x∗ = 1 are stable. When x∗ satisfies F ′
(x) < 0 , x∗ is an evolutionarily stable strategy. Therefore, when 
y < y0 , x = 0 is stable. When the governance is too low, the platform chooses negative regulation, as shown in 
Fig. 1b. When y > y0 , x = 1 is stable, meaning that when governance reaches a certain level, active regulation is 
the optimal strategy for the platform in the game system, as shown in Fig. 1c.
Government’s evolutionary stability analysis. When x = x0 , y is stable at any level of 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 , as shown in 
Fig. 2a. When x  = x0 , y∗ = 0 and y∗ = 1 are stable. When y∗ satisfies F ′(
y
)
< 0 , y∗ is an evolutionarily stable 
strategy. Therefore, when x < x0 , y = 1 is stable. Additionally, when the probability that the platform chooses 
active regulation is too low, active governance is the optimal strategy of the government in the game system,

as shown in Fig. 2b. When x > x0 and y = 0 is stable. When the probability that the platform chooses active 
regulation reaches a certain level, the government eventually chooses negative governance, as shown in Fig. 2c.
Evolutionary path analysis. According to the Jacobian matrix solution method, we calculate the Jacobian 
matrix of the game system as follows:
Then, we calculate the determinant (detJ) and trace (trJ) of the Jacobian matrix, and the calculation results 
are shown in Table 5.
When the Jacobian matrix meets detJ > 0 and trJ < 0 , the equilibrium point of the replicated dynamic equa-
tion is the ESS point. According to Table 5, the game system has a saddle point 
(
x0, y0
)
 . The evolutionary stability 
result of the system changes with the different value ranges of x0 and y0 . Among them, it is obviously not true 
when x0 > 1 . Therefore, we discuss the values of x0 and y0 in different situations.
(1) When x0 < 0 and y0 < 0 , f − C − F < 0 and C2 + C3 − d − TC3 < 0 so that (1, 0) is the ESS point of the 
system.
(2) When x0 < 0 and 0 < y0 < 1 , f − C − F < 0 and 0 < C2 + C3 − d − TC3 < f ,so that (0, 0) is the ESS 
point of the system.

Key parameter analysis. 
(1) Key parameters related to the platform
  In states I and IV, the platform chooses negative regulation and active regulation, respectively. It is required 
to meet ∂F(x)
∂x < 0 so that the two states tend to be stable, and the conditions are TC3 + d − C2 − C3 < 0 and 
TC3 + d − C2 − C3 > 0 , respectively. Among them, the platform technology R&D cost C3 and the addi-
tional cost of passive regulation d are important parameters that affect the platform. When the technology 
R&D cost is small and the additional cost is large, the expected revenue of the platform choosing active 
regulation is less than 0. For additional cost d , when the blockchain technology maturity is low, the platform 
chooses negative regulation to lose less, and the technical efficiency obtained by applying the blockchain is 
not enough to offset the governance cost of active regulation (C2 + C3) . Thus, the probability of the platform 
choosing active regulation is low. For technical efficiency P = TC3 , since blockchain technology maturity

T is an uncontrollable parameter, to change the platform’s strategy in the game system to an ideal state, the 
platform should not only make reasonable use of the government’s innovation subsidies but also improve 
technology R&D efficiency, thereby reducing the technology R&D cost C3.
(2) Key parameters related to the government
  In states I and II, the government chooses negative governance and active governance, respectively. It is 
required to meet ∂F(y)
∂y < 0 so that the two states tend to be stable, and the conditions are f − C − F < 0 and 
f − C − F > 0 , respectively. For total governance cost C = C1 + (1− T)/k , since blockchain technology 
maturity T is an uncontrollable parameter for the government, the key parameters for the establishment 
of f − C − F > 0 are the government innovation input F and punishment intensity f  . When punishment 
intensity is small and innovation input is large, the expected revenue of the government choosing active 
governance is less than 0. When the platform chooses negative regulation, it brings high governance costs 
to the government, resulting in the net revenue of the government choosing that the active governance is 
less than 0, meaning that the punishment intensive is less than the sum of innovation input and govern-
ance cost. Driven by interests, the government tends to choose negative governance. At the same time, 
according to the conditions, government innovation input is not the larger the better. Therefore, to change 
the government’s strategy in the game system to an ideal state, the government should not only increase 
the punishment intensity for the platform’s negative regulatory behaviours, but also provide reasonable 
subsidies for the platform’s application of blockchain to increase the willingness of the platform to apply 
blockchain technology without affecting the interests of the government, and finally achieve the optimal 
state of government governance.
Numerical experiment. Based on the above analysis, the evolutionary stability results of the system 
depend on the initial conditions and changes in the relevant parameters. To more intuitively reflect on the evolu-
tionary path of the game between the platform and the government and the influence of the parameter values on 
evolutionary stability results, this paper uses the Python programming language to carry out numerical experi-
ments. The parameter initialisation values are shown in Table 7, and the system evolution diagrams are shown 
in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. The horizontal axis in the figures represents the evolution time t  of the system, 
and the vertical axis represents the proportion x(t) of the platform choosing active regulation and the proportion 
y(t) of the government choosing active governance.

regulation.

following the change in d, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The figures show that when the additional cost is relatively 
small, as d = 2 , the platform tends to choose negative regulation, and when the additional cost increases to d = 8 , 
the platform turns to active regulation.

Results and discussion
To effectively improve the government governance efficiency and promote the innovative and healthy develop-
ment of the online car-hailing industry, based on the perspective of technology governance, this paper intro-
duces blockchain technology as the governance measure to construct an evolutionary game model between the 
online car-hailing platform and the government based on blockchain technology. This paper also analyses the 
evolutionary stability results and evolutionary paths of the system under different conditions. This paper draws 
the following results. (1) Government innovation input has a negative effect on the evolution of the system to 
an ideal state. Larger government subsidies for platform technology innovation are not better, and reasonable 
innovation input can prompt the government to choose active governance. (2) Government punishment inten-
sity has a positive effect on the evolution of the system to an ideal state. Increasing the punishment intensity for 
negative regulatory behaviour of the platform can help motivate the government to choose active governance. 
(3) The technology R&D cost has a negative effect on the evolution of the system to an ideal state. Effectively 
reducing the platform’s R&D cost for blockchain technology can prompt the platform to choose active regula-
tion. (4) The additional cost has a positive effect on the evolution of the system to the ideal state. When the 
information fraud cost and reputation loss caused by the platform’s negative regulation are high, it can help the 
platform choose active regulation.
According to the above results, to help the government better govern the online car-hailing platform and 
promote the innovation and development of the platform, this paper proposes the following countermeasures. 
From the perspective of government governance, the government should strengthen the risk assessment of 
innovation subsidies for the platform and provide appropriate subsidies to the platform that actively introduces 
blockchain technology for innovation and development. At the same time, the government should establish and 
perfect policies and regulations on the governance of the online car-hailing industry. On the basis of clarifying 
the platform’s regulatory responsibilities, the government urges the platform to earnestly fulfil its regulatory 
responsibilities and imposes high fines on the platform that defrauds subsidies and negatively responds to the 
regulatory responsibilities. From the perspective of platform regulation, the platform should make reasonable

use of government innovation subsidies, and actively improve the R&D efficiency of blockchain technology to 
effectively reduce the R&D cost of blockchain technology. At the same time, the platform should make full use 
of blockchain technology to create a trustworthy environment, which will send a safe and reliable signal to the 
public, thereby effectively enhancing the reputation of the platform and ultimately realising the innovative and 
healthy development of the online car-hailing industry.
Conclusions
The governance and the development of the online car-hailing industry is an important measure to ensure a 
safe and civilised travel environment. With the technical characteristics of openness, transparency, security 
and reliability, traceability, decentralisation, tamper-proofing and immutability, blockchain technology provides 
technical credit enhancement support and secure transaction guarantees for the online car-hailing  industry14,17. 
Therefore, based on evolutionary game theory, this paper introduces blockchain as a technical governance meas-
ure and constructs an evolutionary game model between the online car-hailing platform and the government 
based on blockchain technology. By establishing and solving the replicated dynamic equations of both players, 
the evolutionary equilibrium strategy of the participants and the stable state of the system are analysed. On this 
basis, focusing on the four key parameters of the government innovation input, punishment intensity, blockchain 
technology R&D cost and additional cost of the platform’s negative regulation, we deeply analyse the impact of 
parameter changes on the strategic choices of both players, and finally use the Python programming language 
to verify the model’s results.
From the perspective of technology governance, this paper reveals the internal mechanism of the behaviour 
evolution between the online car-hailing platform and the government to a certain extent and verifies that the 
introduction of blockchain technology can effectively realise the regulation and governance of the online car-
hailing industry. Finally, this paper provides a useful reference for the governance and the development of the 
online car-hailing industry from two levels of government governance and platform regulation. In addition, this 
paper has some limitations. First, due to the limited data collection, the numerical simulation lacks the support 
of real data. Future research can be combined with real cases in the online car-hailing industry to address the 
complex and the changeable market environment. Second, this paper only considers the two-dimensional game 
between the government and the platform. Future research can introduce more subjects, such as online car-
hailing drivers and customers, and further explore how to achieve the governance and healthy development of 
the online car-hailing industry in the case of multiple participants.
