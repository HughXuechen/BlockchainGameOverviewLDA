ABSTRACT Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, it has gained a significant popularity around the
world. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data
structure named the block-chain. Based on a fully decentralized network, the blockchain is maintained by a
community of participants. In Bitcoin system, mining is the fundamental concept. In this paper, we design a
newBitcoinmining scheme based on themulti-leader multi-follower Stackelberg gamemodel. To effectively
implement the peer-to-peer relationship of Bitcoin system agents, we assume that mining pool operators are
leaders and mining participating users are followers in our Stackelberg game. By using the dynamics of
feedback-based repeated process, leaders, and followers can be interacting with one another and make their
decisions in a way to reach an efficient system solution. Without the influence of any central authorities and
organizations, the proposed method is practically applied to a distributed Bitcoin system. Through system
level simulations, we show that our game approach outperforms the existing Bitcoin schemes in providing
a better fair-efficient system performance.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent improvement in computer technology and commu-
nication networks has created some alternatives for tradi-
tional money exchange. In particular, number of users using
financial Internet services have increased and gained a lot
of popularity. However, traditional financial services have
always been controversial and we will encounter many prob-
lems. First, people need to trust some third parties, which
are built as centralized systems. There have been many
reports about stolen credentials and financial information
from the centralized system. Usually, people sensitively
concern with their privacy and security. Second, classical
monetary system is still analog based on fiat currencies such
as US Dollar. This currency is backed by the US govern-
ment, but it is inflationary. Third, there are some difficulties
and inconveniences through traditional financial services.
For example, transaction time limitations and extra service
fees, etc. [1], [2].
In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto released a new peer-to-peer
distributed and trustless electronic cash, called Bitcoin. As the
first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has introduced
some unique features which has never done before. In par-
ticular, Bitcoin replaced the central servers with a consensus
mechanism based on the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. As a
decentralized form of currency, Bitcoin offers the opportu-
nity to have nearly anonymous transactions. A transaction
is formed when a user digitally signs a hash of the previous
transactionwhere this Bitcoin was last spent. The Bitcoin sys-
tem verifies transactions which are stored in a data structure
called the blockchain which is maintained by a community
of participating users. Nowadays, Bitcoin has received a lot
of attentions and brought many new opportunities to the next
generation financial services [1], [3].
To ensure Bitcoin system integrity, all transactions
should be verified through cryptographic proof in the net-
work system. This process is called Bitcoin mining [4].

S. Kim: Novel Bitcoin Mining Scheme Based on the Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Model
In particular, Bitcoin mining is a peer-to-peer computing
process, which is used to secure and to verify Bitcoin transac-
tions on a decentralized network. During the Bitcoin mining,
Bitcoin uses a hash-based PoW mechanism to generate
blocks; individual blocks must contain a PoW to be consid-
ered valid. This PoW is verified by other Bitcoin users at
each time they receive a block while confirming transactions
to the rest of the network as having taken place. Therefore,
Bitcoin uses a PoW function to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin
transactions from attempts to re-spend Bitcoins that have
already been spent elsewhere [4].
Any user connected to the Bitcoin network can participate
in creating a block by finding a valid PoW. When a block is
generated, the chain grows linearly, and participating users
get Bitcoins as a reward. For example, if users successfully
generate a block, they’re granted a fixed amount of Bitcoins.
This is an incentive for them to continuously support the
Bitcoin system. Therefore, the primary purpose of Bitcoin
mining serves the purpose of disseminating new Bitcoins in a
decentralized manner as well as participating users to provide
security for the system through mining [4].
However, the Bitcoin mining process requires dedicated
hardware devices and consumes intense amounts of energy.
Therefore, it is infeasible to mine a block using personal
computers or individual mining devices. To overcome this
difficulty, it is expected in the phenomenon that stresses
distributed computation situation [5], [6]. Recently, the new
concept, called pool mining, was introduced to make the
Bitcoin mining profitable. Pool mining is a mining approach
where groups of individual users contribute their computation
power to mine a block, and then split the obtained Bitcoin
reward according to their processing contributes. To adap-
tively split the reward into pool members in proportion to
their actual contributions, there is a space for algorithmic
improvements [4], [7]. Usually, each pool has its own poli-
cies for sharing the Bitcoin reward, and the profit that each
participating user gets varies. Therefore, each individual user
willing to join a pool must decide which pool would be the
most profitable to him [8].
In the widely dynamic Bitcoin mining process, individ-
ual users and pool operators can be assumed as intelligent
decision-makers, and they rationally select a best strategy
to maximize their expected profits. This situation is well-
suited for the game theory. Game theory is a field of applied
mathematics that provides an effective tool to model interac-
tions among independent decision makers. It can describe the
reactions of one set of decision makers to another and analyze
the situations in terms of conflict and cooperation [9]. During
the Bitcoin mining operation, game theory is really useful in
analyzing the mutual interactions between users and mining
operators, and can be a major control paradigm to retain an
effective solution [4].
In 1934, H. V. Stackelberg proposed a hierarchical non-
cooperative game model based on two kinds of different
decision makers; a leader and followers. In traditional Stack-
elberg games, a leader makes the first move in the game, and
multiple followers would respond to the actions of the leader.
Recently, the classical Stackelberg game model has been
extended as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game.
In this new game model, multiple leaders first predict the
behaviors of all followers while considering the correspond-
ing strategies of other leaders. And then, leaders select their
strategies. Followers choose their preferred leaders accord-
ing to the strategies set by the leaders [9], [10]. Compared
with the traditional Stackelberg game, the multi-leader multi-
follower Stackelberg game is suitable and adaptable for the
practical implementation of Bitcoin mining situation.
Motivated by the above discussion, we propose a novel
Bitcoin mining scheme based on the multi-leader multi-
follower Stackelberg game model. In the proposed scheme,
users are grouped as amining pool, andmultiplemining pools
exist in a distributed way. The main focus of our scheme is to
develop new algorithms for the reward payment and compu-
tation power distribution processes. From the viewpoint of
pool operators, the main interest is to maximize their profits
by adaptively deciding the pooling fee. From the viewpoint
of mining users, how to effectively distribute their computa-
tion power is an essential challenge. Based on the repeated
interaction, users and pool operators can highlight issues of
cooperation and competition in each mining pool and across
multiple pools. Under widely different and diversifiedBitcoin
network situations, the proposed Stackelberg game approach
can get a globally desirable system performance.
A. CONTRIBUTION
In this paper, we design a new Bitcoin mining scheme in
accordance with the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg
game. The main novelty of our scheme is the reciprocal com-
bination of the fee decision and power distribution algorithms
while paying a serious attention to the adjustable dynamics
considering the current Bitcoin system environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies the
Stackelberg game model with multiple leaders and multiple
followers to study the Bitcoin mining process. The contribu-
tions of this study can be summarized as follows:
• Stackelberg game implementation: we introduce
a novel non-cooperative multi-leader multi-follower
Stackelberg game model while capturing dynamic inter-
actions of mining operators and users. Depending on
their different viewpoints, our approach is generic and
applicable to implement the real-world Bitcoin mining
mechanism.
• Fee decision algorithm in the mining process:
we implement the fee decision algorithm in each mining
pool using a specialized learning protocol. To attract
enough mining users’ participations, the pooling fee in
each pool should be adjusted dynamically based on the
current system conditions.
• Bargaining solutions for mining participations:
we employ the basic concept of bargaining solutions
to formalize the users’ mining strategies. To maximize
their profits, users distribute their computational power

among a set of mining pools while participating in mul-
tiple mining processes.
• The synergy of combined algorithms: we explore the
sequential interaction of the fee decision and computa-
tional power distribution algorithms, and jointly design
an integrated scheme to strike an appropriate perfor-
mance balance between conflicting requirements. The
synergy effect lies in its responsiveness to the reciprocal
combination of different control algorithms.
• Practical implementation: we investigate the dynamic
system environment based on the step-by-step repeated
game process. This is a suitable and practical approach
for real-world Bitcoin network operations.
• Performance analysis: we evaluate the system perfor-
mance based on the simulation model. Numerical study
demonstrates that the overall performance of the pro-
posed scheme can be significantly improved by compar-
ing to the existing [4], [7], [13] schemes.
B. ORGANIZATION
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next
section, we review some related Bitcoin mining schemes and
their problems. Section III introduces the basics of Bitcoin
system and provides an outline of the multi-leader multi-
follower Stackelberg game model. In addition, we explain
the proposed Bitcoin mining scheme in detail, and show the
main steps of the proposed scheme to increase readability.
In Section IV, performance evaluation results are presented
along with comparisons with the schemes proposed in [4],
[7], and [13]. Finally, we end up with some concluding
remarks in Section V. In this section, we also discuss the
remaining open challenges in this research area along with
possible solutions.
II. RELATED WORK
Recently, several Bitcoin mining schemes have been pre-
sented for peer-to-peer distributed network systems. In [11],
a new game model is defined and analyzed. In this game
model, pools use some of their participants to infiltrate other
pools and perform such an attack. In addition, a new concept,
called miner’s dilemma, is introduced. The special cases
where either two pools or any number of identical pools
play the game are studied. In these cases, there exists an
equilibrium that constitutes a tragedy of the commons where
the participating pools attack one another and earn less than
they would have if none has attacked. For pools, the decision
whether or not to attack is the miner’s dilemma, an instance
of the iterative prisoner’s dilemma [11].
Beikverdi and Song [1] introduces a centralization factor
in Bitcoin’s mining which shows the state of centralization
in the network. In order to keep Bitcoin as a distributed and
decentralized network, mining process should be clear to
users. Moreover, any users with current normal processing
power should be able to contribute in the mining process.
Centralization phenomenon is something that happens to
any disciplined system by nature to make things simpler.
Therefore, in case of Bitcoin mining process, central-
ization is considered as a big concern. In the paper
Beikverdi and Song [1] show that Bitcoin is getting central-
ized, and this issue should be resolved.
Salimitari et al. [8] focus on the profit maximization
problem. It becomes challenging for a new miner to decide
the pool he must join such that the profit is maximized.
By using the prospect theory, the profit of a specific miner
can be predicted with his hash rate power and electricity
costs. A utility value is calculated for each pool based on its
recent performance, hash rate power, total number of the pool
members, reward distribution policy of the pool, electricity
fee in the newminer’s region, pool fee, and the current Bitcoin
value. Then, based on these parameters during a certain time
duration, the most profitable pool is found for each miner.
Results reveal that the proposed approach is consistent with
what users actually mine [8].
The paper [12] analyzes the pooledmining reward systems,
and seems to best capture the principles of pooled mining
process. In mining reward systems, payments are calculated
based on a division to rounds, where a round is the time
between one block found by the pool to the next. At the
end of every round, when a block is found and the pool
receives a specific reward, the operator keeps a fee, and the
rest is distributed among the miners, in direct proportion to
the number of shares they submitted during this round [12].
Fang et al. [25] employ the coordinated multiple relays
communication to improve the physical-layer security of the
wireless network. To systematically model the source and
the multiple relays’ behaviors, a stackelberg game model
is proposed based on the single-leader multiple-followers’
interactive mechanism. And then, an optimal price allocation
algorithm is also developed to achieve the cooperative com-
munication. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed
scheme in [25] performs much better in defending against the
eavesdropping attacks than those existing schemes.
In [26], a novel trust management is established based on
fuzzy logic and game theory by considering the uncertainty.
First, a multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making model is devel-
oped to predict trust in the fuzzy and complex environment.
Second, a trust updating process based on game theory and
evolutionary learning is designed. Finally, two illustrative
examples are provided to verify the proposed model. Com-
pared to the traditional trust measurement method, the simu-
lation results show that the proposed model in [26] has better
adaptability and accuracy in fuzzy large-scale networks.
The Distributed Computation based Power Splitting
(DCPS) scheme [13] proposes a new computational power
splitting game for the Bitcoin mining mechanism. This game
model includes multiple supervisors and incentivized users
to compete in solving large computation tasks in exchange
for financial rewards. Users with computation power play
a game of solving computation problems by acting as a
supervisor or joining other pools. In particular, the DCPS
scheme enables users connect to the Internet to participate
in the Bitcoin mining while splitting their computational
48904 VOLUME 6, 2018

powers among a set of competing pools. Based on the game
model, users have the choice to contribute their power to
one supervisor’s pool or anonymously spread it across many
pools. Finally, it is shown that the DCPS scheme is a pow-
erful Bitcoin protocol in competitive distributed computation
scenarios [13].
The Cooperative Game based Bitcoin Mining (CGBM)
scheme in [7] examines the dynamics of pooled mining and
reward distribution. Cooperative game theoretic tools are
used to analyze how pool members may share the reward.
According to the skewed reward mechanism, the CGBM
scheme demonstrates the fact that a hard-work pool gains
more rewards, in expectation, than its fair share. Due to the
non-linear nature of returns, this scheme creates an incentive
for some users to leave their pool and join other pools so as
to increase their expected reward. Finally, the CGBM scheme
illustrates the use of game theoretic tools applied to a real-
world Bitcoin network environment [7].
S. Kim designs the Group Bargaining based Bitcoin Min-
ing (GBBM) scheme while developing a novel incentive
payment process [4]. To effectively implement an incentive
payment mechanism, he adopts the concept of the group
bargaining solution by considering a peer-to-peer relation-
ship, and it is practically applied to a distributed computation
network system. Based on the desirable features of group bar-
gaining approach, self-regarding users are induced to actively
participate in the fair-efficient Bitcoin mining process, and
the protocol in [4] explores an effective solution that can
maximize Bitcoin users’ rewards.
All the earlier work has attracted a lot of attention and
introduced unique challenges. However, although some work
has been done to improve the performance of Bitcoin min-
ing process, no published research attempts to capture the
hierarchical interaction among users and pool operators
to get the desirable solution. In this study, we compared
the performance of our proposed scheme with that of the
DCPS scheme [13], the CGBM scheme [7] and the GBBM
scheme [4] to confirm the superiority of our approach in
Bitcoin network system operations.
III. PROPOSED FAIR-EFFICIENT BITCOIN
MINING ALGORITHMS
In this section, we consider a new Bitcoin mining process
powered by the peer-to-peer network system. Due to the
technology shift from a regular single-user mining process
to the cooperative mining pool mechanism, we focus on the
multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model.
A. STACKELBERG GAME MODEL FOR
BITCOIN NETWORKS
Recent advances in distributed computation technology have
solved large computational problems by harnessing the avail-
ability of computers connected to the Internet [13]. By having
Internet as a great platform where everyone has an access
to, distributing information has become significantly simpler,
and can easily benefit from Internet as a distributed and
decentralized peer-to-peer platform [1], [14], [15]. Based
on this situation, cryptocurrency has emerged as an impor-
tant financial software system. It is a digital asset designed
to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography
to secure its transactions while verifying the transfer of
assets. To generate and distribute currency units, participants
contribute their computational resources in exchange for
direct financial gain or monetary compensation. This process
requires distributed verifications of transactions without a
central authority [16].
Bitcoin, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, was the
first decentralized cryptocurrency while using a decentral-
ized control mechanism as opposed to centralized electronic
money and central banking systems. This decentralized con-
trol approach is related to the use of blockchain transaction
database in the role of a distributed public ledger. Blockchain
consists of a distributed, chronological chain of blocks and it
is a continuously growing list of blocks, which are added to it
with a new set of records. Each block typically contains a hash
pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and trans-
action data. As a distributed ledger, blockchain is typically
managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to
a protocol for validating new blocks. The process of adding a
new block is based on a consensus. Therefore, the data in any
given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alter-
ation of all subsequent blocks, which requires the collusion
of network majority. Based on this blockchain technology,
transactions across Bitcoin systems can be more secure than
traditional transaction processes [1], [2], [4], [8], [17].
With fiat money in traditional central banking system,
a government decides when to print and distribute money.
Bitcoin doesn’t have a central authority. Instead, Bitcoins
are generated at a predictable rate such that the eventual
total number will be 21 million. To issue Bitcoins, we use
a special software to solve math problems, which are related
to hash-cash PoW. It means that in order to add a block to
the blockchain, user should find a specific nonce value for
each block in a way that the SHA-256 hash value of the block
information and the nonce value will be less than a specific
target value [8]. The process of new Bitcoin generation is
called mining and users who create and verify blocks are
called miners. Miners keep altering the value of nonce, which
results in entirely changing the block’s header hash, until
a valid hash is found. Therefore, the higher the number of
random values a miner can generate per second, the higher
the chances to meet the target in less time [4].
As a peer-to-peer computing process, bitcoin mining
involves adding bitcoin transaction data to Bitcoin’s global
public ledger of past transactions. To maintain this process,
there must be an incentive to contribute verifying transac-
tions within the blockchain.Without miners, new transactions
cannot be added to the public ledger, and Bitcoin will not
function. However, Bitcoin mining is mathematically hard
and time consuming because it can be done only by brute
force search and the miners have to try different nonce values
randomly to search the answer. To overcome this difficulty,
VOLUME 6, 2018 48905
S. Kim: Novel Bitcoin Mining Scheme Based on the Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Model
Bitcoin miners pool their computational resources together
and share their hashing power while splitting the reward
according to the amount of shares they contributed to solving
a block [8], [18].
Bitcoin mining pool is a way to encourage miners to work
together as a team while sharing miners’ hashing powers to
generate a block. During the last several years, several mining
pool protocols have been developed to implement the coop-
erative mining process. Main differences among protocols
are pooling fee and payment system strategies. Pooling fees
vary according to the payment distribution models, which
determine which party is assuming the risk - the miners or the
mining pool operator. If the mining pool operator is assuming
the risk, then the fee is higher, and if the miners assume the
risk then the fee is lower [1], [2], [4], [7], [8].
Over the time, many different payment systems for the
Bitcoin mining process have been developed. Usually, pay-
ment systems are categorized using the concept of share.
As a scorekeeping in each mining software, share describes
how much work a miner’s computer is contributing to the
mining pool, and is awarded to miners who present a valid
PoW. It means a miner’s shares are counting substantially
towards discovering new Bitcoins. The more shares a miner
contribute, the more payout for each coin block that is found.
According to the amount of shares, the Bitcoin reward is split
into miners who contribute to solving a block. Therefore, dif-
ferent payment systems have been invented using the shares
of each miner. In an ongoing effort to come up with the fair-
efficient methods, most popular payment systems are PPS,
Prop, PPLNS and Score [19].
• Pay Per Share (PPS): This model offers a guaranteed
payout for each share of miners, who can withdraw their
payout immediately. The PPS model allows for the least
possible variance in payment for miners while transfer-
ring much of the risk to the pool operator. Therefore,
the fee is high for the risky pool operator.
• Proportional (Prop): This model offers a proportional
distribution of the reward among all miners. It is a round-
based method; one round is the time between the first
share after the last found block and the share which
solves a block. When a block is found, the reward is dis-
tributed proportionally based on the number of shares.
• Pay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS): This model looks at
the last N shares, regardless of round boundaries, and
distributes the reward like as the Prop model. It means
that the PPLNSmodel does not considers valid shares of
one round, but considers a number N of shares, nomatter
if they’re apart of the round or not.
• Score: This model uses a method that a proportional
reward is distributed and weighed by the time the work
was submitted. For each share score is updated based on
the timing rule; later shares are worth more than earlier
shares. The reward is calculated in proportion to the
scores and not shares submitted.
When a miner is deciding to join a mining pool, there are
quite a few considerations to take into account; i) payment
systems, which are the methods of distributing the block
reward, ii) pooling fees, which are charged to miners for the
pool management, and iii) each miner’s propensity. In this
study, the main contribution is the up-to-date presentation
of the mutual-interaction relationship between mining pool
operators and miners. The dynamics of this relationship can
cause cascade interactions of them, and they dynamically
make their decisions to maximize their profits. For pool oper-
ators, pooling fee adjustments are their major decisions, and
for miners, distributions of their computing power are their
main concerns. To model the autonomous interacting mech-
anism between pool operators and miners, we develop a new
multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to get an effec-
tive solution. Our game model (G) can be represented by a
tuple G =
(
{LLL,FFF} ,
(
SSSLLL
Li∈LLL,SSS
FFF
Fj∈FFF
)
,
(
ULLL
Li∈LLL,U
FFF
Fj∈FFF
)
,T
)
at each time period of gameplay.
• {LLL,FFF} is the finite superset of game players where
LLL = {L1, . . .Ll} represents the set of leaders and FFF =
{F1, . . .Ff } is a set of followers. In the G, leaders are
pool operators and followers are miners in the Bitcoin
mining process.
• SSSLLL
Li∈LLL is the strategy set of the player L1≤i≤l and SSSFFF
Fj∈FFF
is the strategy set of the player F1≤j≤f . Commonsen-
sically, payment system of each pool is initially cho-
sen and remains constant eternally. Therefore, SLLL
Li is
defined as the pooling fee levels. Through a specific
partition function, the Fj distributes his computational
power across multiple pools to maximize the profit.
Therefore, SSSFFF
Fj represents the Fj’s participating level for
each individual pool.
• ULLL
Li∈LLL is the payoff received by the player Li; it is
determined as the sum of obtained fees. UFFF
Fj∈FFF is the
payoff received by the player Fj; it is determined as the
sum of rewards from mining participations.
• T is a time period. In order to implement the Bitcoin
mining process, we partition the time-axis into equal
intervals of length unit_time. The G is repeated at each
unit_time with competitive and cooperative manner.
B. UTILITY FUNCTIONS IN THE PROPOSED STACKELBERG
GAME MODEL
In this subsection, we formulate utility functions for game
players. In our multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game
model, multiple pool operators andminers compete with each
other for their profit maximization while solving compu-
tationally large problems. Pool operators adaptively decide
their pooling fees to induce selfish miners to participate in
their mining pools. With the computational power, miners
play a game to maximize their payoffs by joining multi-
ple pools. Based on the step-by-step interactive feedback
approach, the proposed game model is designed as a repeated
game.
To quantify players’ satisfaction, their utility functions
are derived based on the outcome of the game. From the
point of view of miners, the main goal is to maximize
48906 VOLUME 6, 2018
S. Kim: Novel Bitcoin Mining Scheme Based on the Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Model
their profits through the mining process. Basically, the main
factors of a miner’s utility function are Bitcoin generation
probability (TB), share generation probability (AS ), pooling
fee (F), transaction incentive (IF ) and a miner’s allocated
computation power (TF ). When a block is discovered, the
discovering miners may award themselves a certain num-
ber of Bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the
Bitcoin network. Currently this bounty is 12.5 Bitcoins;
this value will halve every 210,000 blocks. Additionally,
the miner is incentivized by Bitcoin transactions, which will
be included in the new block. In the future, as the num-
ber of new bitcoins dwindles, this transaction incentive (IF )
will make up a much more important percentage of mining
income [1], [2], [4], [7], [8], [19].
To develop a miner’s utility function, we should consider
the distinctive features of each payment system. The profit
of a miner is strongly dependent on the payment system
of mining pool, which is selected by the miner. Therefore,
a miner’s utility function should be defined differently based
on each payment system. At each unit_time period, each
miner monitors periodically his payoff value and change
their strategies dynamically in an online distributed manner.
The miner Fj’s utility function for the PPS payment system(

From the point of view of pool operators, themajor concern
is to recruit miners; the larger participating miners, the higher

C. BITCOIN MINING PROCESS WITH
BARGAINING SOLUTIONS
Generally, all miners have unique, complex personalities
shaped by socioeconomic background, personal experience,
and current status. These diverse factors make it possible to
broadly categorize miners into three types; risk-averse, risk-
neutral and risk-seeking. When exposed to uncertainty, risk-
averse miners attempt to lower that uncertainty; they hesitate
to agree to a situation with an unknown payoff rather than
another situation with a more predictable payoff but possibly
lower expected payoff. On the contrary to this, risk-seeking
miners have a preference for risk; they prefer an investment
with an uncertain but higher expected outcome. Risk-neutral
miners are indifferent to risk when making an investment
decision; they place themselves in the middle of the risk
spectrum, represented by risk-seeking miners at one end and
risk-averse miners at the other [20].
In this study, miners distribute their computation powers
to multiple pools, differentially. Therefore, how much com-
putation power would be allotted to a specific pool is an
important issue. To allocate the computation power fairly and
optimally, we adopt the basic concept of bargaining solutions.
Bargaining solution predicts an outcome of game play based
only on information about each player’s preferences. It is
formulated by an expected utility function over the set of
feasible agreements and the outcome which would result in
case of disagreement. Over the past few decades, various
bargaining solutions have been proposed based on slightly
different assumptions about what properties are desired for
the final agreement point. For bargaining solutions, there are
desirable properties [9];
i) Individual rationality: No player is worse off than if the
bargaining agreement fails.
ii) Pareto optimality: Bargaining solution gives the maxi-
mum payoff to the players.
iii) Invariance with respect to utility transformations:
Bargaining solution is invariant if affinely scaled. This
axiom is also called Independence of Linear Transfor-
mations or scale covariance.
iv) Independence of irrelevant alternatives: Bargaining
solution should be independent of irrelevant alterna-
tives. In other words, a reasonable outcome will be
feasible after some payoff sets have been removed.
v) Symmetry: If the players’ utilities are exactly the same,
they should get symmetric payoffs. Therefore, payoff
should not discriminate between the identities of the
players, but only depend on utility functions.
vi) Individual monotonicity: The increasing of bargaining
set size in a direction favorable to a specific player
always benefits that player.
vii) Stronger monotonicity: Bargaining solution attempts to
grant equal gain to players. In other words, it is the point
which maximizes the minimum payoff among players.
Most well-known bargaining solutions are Nash Bargaining
Solution (NBS) developed by J. Nash at 1950,
Kalai-Smorodinsky Bargaining Solution (KSBS) developed
by E. Kalai and M. Smorodinsky at 1975, and Egalitar-
ian Bargaining Solution (EBS) developed by E. Kalai and
R. Myerson. These bargaining solutions have some attrac-
tive features to model the interactions among independent
decision-makers, and achieve a mutually desirable solution
between efficiency and fairness. NBS, KSBS and EBS are
formulated as follows [9], [21];
• NBS: To provide a fair-efficient bargaining solution,
NBS satisfies the i), ii), iii), iv) and v) axioms. By adap-
tively distribute a miner’s computation power

it guarantees that miners obtain nothing in case of bar-
gaining disagreement.
• KSBS: To achieve a mutually desirable solution with
a good balance between efficiency and fairness, KSBS
satisfies the i), ii), iii), v) and vi) axioms. Therefore,
KSBS is obtained as a weighted max-min solution.

To effectively spread its computation power across four
different pools, each individual miner selects one bargaining
solution, which can be an effective tool to maximize miners’
payoffs. For the bargaining selection, recent research has
shown that different bargaining solutions have a relation to
the issue of risk [22]. Usually, the NBS predicts that Risk-
averse is a disadvantage in bargaining, and the EBS is in
accordwith Risk-neutral. In this study, we concern bargaining
solutions which may consider risky outcomes based on the
share generation. Therefore, in the Bitcoin mining situation,
we characterize each bargaining solution as advantageous,
disadvantageous, or irrelevant from the point of view of
uncertainty. In our game model, the risk-averse, risk-neutral
and risk-seeking type miners select the KSBS, EBS and NBS,
respectively, to distribute their computation power across
multiple mining pools.
D. THE MAIN STEPS OF PROPOSED ALGORITHM
In this work, each pool operator is independently interested in
the sole goal of maximizing his utility function. Initially, the
payment method of each pool is decided. Therefore, the main
control issue of pool operators is to select adaptively their
pooling fees while maximizing their payoffs. In the proposed
scheme, the pooling fee decision mechanism is developed
based on the iterative learning process. In a distributed self-
regarding fashion, pool operators learn the uncertain Bitcoin
system situation and make decisions by taking into account
the online feedback mechanism.
For simplicity, we assume that pooling fees are defined
as discrete price levels where SSSLLL
L =
{
s1L . . . s
k
L
}
. In a dis-
tributed manner, each operator periodically re-evaluates the
currently selected strategy and iteratively updates its own the
probability distribution P
[
P
(
s1L
)
. . .P
(
skL
)]
for SSSLLL
L . When a
pool operator selects a pooling fee with his respective P [·],
his payoff UL (·) is obtained according to the equation (1).
Therefore, the P [·] should be adjusted adaptively in order
to cope with the payoff fluctuation. At every unit_time, each
individual pooling operator updates his probability distribu-
tion based on the modified Roth-Erev learning method [23].
If the pooling operator Li selects s1≤l≤kLi in SSSLLL
Li at the
t th unit_time, the Li updates the slLi ’s propensity φ

In this study, we formulate a novel multi-leader multi-
follower Stackelberg game model for the Bitcoin mining
process. Based on the step-by-step interactive feedback
approach, pool operators and miners adapt their strategies
to achieve the better benefit. As leaders, pool operators
select their pooling fees. As followers, miners decide their
bargaining solutions how to distribute their computational
powers. At each unit_time, their decisions are examined and
adjusted periodically. It is a realistic and appropriate Bitcoin
mining process among selfish and rational game players.
Usually, the traditional optimal algorithms have exponen-
tial time complexity. However, the proposed approach has
only polynomial time complexity. The proposed algorithm is
described by the following flowchart.
FIGURE 1. Flowchart of the proposed algorithm.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
scheme using a simulation model. In order to ensure that the
model is sufficiently generic to be valid in the real-world, the
assumptions used in our simulation model were as follows:
• The simulated system consists of four mining pools and
10∼100 miners for the Bitcoin mining process. There-
fore, there are four pool operators.
• In the Bitcoin network, the information of each pool is
publicly available; miners easily access that information
during the mining process.
• In the Bitcoin mining process, miners use a hash-based
PoW mechanism to generate blocks. It is a random
process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error
is required on average before a valid block is generated.
In this simulation, the Hash-cash PoW system is used.
• We assume that game players’ strategies are not changed
in one game round, e.g., unit_time in our system.
• SSSLLL consists of five strategies where SSSLLL
={
s1L = 1%, s2L = 2%, s3L = 3%, s4L = 4%, s5L = 5%
}
for
the Prop, PPLNS and Score payment system pools and
SSSLLL
= {s1L = 10%, s2L = 20%, s3L = 30%, s4L = 40%,
s5L = 50%} for the PPS payment system pool;
sL represents the percentage of individual miner’s
outcome.
• SSSFFF consists of three strategies where SSSFFF
=
{NBS,KSBS,EBS}.
• Floating point operations per second (FLOPS) is a mea-
sure of computation power.
• Each miner’s total computational power (TuF )
is 100 teraFLOPS. One BCU is the minimum amount,
e.g., 10 teraFLOPS in our system, of computational
power distribution.
• The share generation process is Poisson with the rate,
i.e., one Bitcoin/1 petaFLOPS/ unit_time.
• The Bitcoin generation process is Poisson with the rate,
i.e., one Bitcoin/10 petaFLOPS/ unit_time.
• System performance measures obtained based on 100
simulation runs were plotted as a function of the offered
number of users.
• The performance criteria obtained through simulation
are the normalized miner’s outcome, the relative ratio of
Bitcoin generation, and theminer’s payoff fairness under
the different number of miners.
In this study, we compare the performance of the proposed
scheme with the existing DCPS [13], CGBM [7], and GBBM
[4] schemes, and confirm the performance superiority of the
proposed approach. Asmentioned in the related work section,
the DCPS scheme introduces a new distributed computation
model which includes multiple supervisors competing with
each other to solve computationally large problems [13].
The CGBM considers how the existence of mining pools
affects the reward allocation in the Bitcoin network while
analyzing the effect of skewed rewards [7]. The GBBM
scheme adopts the dual-level cooperative game approach
to provide a suitable trade-off between efficiency and fair-
ness [4]. Table 1 shows the system parameters used in the
simulation. To emulate the Bitcoin mining system and ensure
a fair comparison, we used the system parameters given
in Table 1.
In this paper, we compared the performance of the pro-
posed scheme with existing schemes: the DCPS scheme [13],
the CGBM scheme [7], and the GBBM scheme [4]. These
existing schemeswere recently developed as effective Bitcoin
mining schemes based on the game theory.
Fig.2 presents the performance comparison of each scheme
in terms of normalized miner’s outcome in the Bitcoin net-
work systems. In this study, the miner’s outcome is defined
as the reward for the Bitcoin mining participation. In general,
48910 VOLUME 6, 2018

TABLE 1. System parameters used in the simulation experiment.
how to use effectively the individual computation power is
strongly relayed to this performance criterion. During the Bit-
coin system operations, all the schemes have similar trends.
However, to find a valid PoW, miners in our proposed scheme
adaptively distribute their computation powers based on the
different bargaining solutions. Therefore, we can get a higher
miner’s reward than the other schemes from low to heavy
miners’ intensities.
FIGURE 2. Normalized miner’s outcome.
Fig.3 shows the relative ratio of Bitcoin generation in the
Bitcoinmining process. From the simulation results obtained,
the ratio of Bitcoin generation increases proportionally to the
number of participating miners; it is intuitively correct. In the
real-world Bitcoin mining operation, the higher Bitcoin gen-
eration is the most important and desirable property. Based on
the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game approach,
we can capture the hierarchical interactions among game
players, and find an effective power distribution to reach
an effective solution. Under different numbers of miners,
FIGURE 3. Relative ratio of bitcoin generation.
the proposed scheme can get more Bitcoins than the other
existing schemes.
The curves in Fig.4 illustrate the miner’s payoff fairness
for all the schemes. In this study, the miner’s fairness is
defined as the Jain’s index of miner’s payoff difference per
computation contribution [24]. According to each miner’s
preference, the computation power is dynamically allocated
while ensuring reciprocal fairness. Therefore, the proposed
scheme can maintain the excellent payoff fairness among
miners than the other schemes.
FIGURE 4. Miner’s payoff fairness.
The simulation results presented in Figs. 2-4 show that
the proposed scheme generally exhibits a well-balanced
Bitcoin system performance compared with the other exist-
ing schemes [4], [7], [13] under different miner numbers.
The proposed scheme can monitor constantly the current
Bitcoin system condition to adapt highly dynamic environ-
ments. In particular, each individual operator andminer in our
multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model acquire
information from the system environment, gain knowledge,
and make intelligent decisions in a self-adapting manner.
Therefore, we can get an attractive system performance,
while the DCPS scheme [13], the CGBM scheme [7], and the
GBBM scheme [4] cannot offer such an appropriate Bitcoin
system performance.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In the traditional finance transaction system, all transaction
information is managed centrally, and users are not autho-
rized to freely access or to publicly review their transaction
information. Therefore, the classical centralized systems have
some problems that need to be overcome. To address this
challenge, Bitcoin has caught the attention of researchers as a
peer-to-peer electronic payment system and digital currency.
However, few work has been done to develop an effective
mining pool mechanism. In this study, we use game theory to
model the interactions among independent decision-makers,
i.e., pool operators and miners, and enforce collaborative
behaviors. To gain a fair-efficient Bitcoin mining solution,
we design a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg
game. In our game model, both leaders and followers can
benefit from the multiple mining pool mechanism, and a win-
win situation can be achieved. Based on the desirable features
of different bargaining solutions, self-regarding miners are
induced to actively participate in the fair-efficient Bitcoin
mining process. To demonstrate the validity of our scheme,
we compare our proposed approach with existing schemes,
and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing
schemes in a simulation environment.
Although we have achieved our goals in the Bitcoin mining
process, we believe there is further scope for improving the
efficiency of the Bitcoin system. Issues for further research
include the design and validation of differential privacy.
In addition, our work could be extended to investigate the
cryptography algorithm in decentralized Bitcoin network
environments. Based on the game theory, cryptography issues
in Bitcoin operations are still needed to be studied and
improved.
