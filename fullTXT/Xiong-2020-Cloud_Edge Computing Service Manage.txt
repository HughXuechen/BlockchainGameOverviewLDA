Abstract—The mining process in public blockchains with the Nakamoto consensus protocol requires solving a computational puzzle,
i.e., proof-of-work, which is resource expensive to implement in lightweight devices with limited computing resources and energy.
Thus, renting mining service from cloud providers becomes a reasonable solution, which is called cloud mining. This enables users who
want to mine, i.e., miners, to purchase and lease an amount of hashing power from the cloud/edge providers without any hassle of
managing the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the interactions among the cloud/edge providers and miners in blockchain using a
multi-leader multi-follower game-theoretic approach, in order to support proof-of-work based blockchains application. Due to the
inherent complexity of the formulated game, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to investigate
the optimum solution. Utilizing the decomposition characteristics and fast convergence of ADMM, we obtain the optimum results in a
distributed manner. Simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed solutions, the optimization of the utilities of miners and the
profits of providers can be jointly achieved.

1 INTRODUCTION
ELECTRONIC trading with digital transactions is growing
in popularity for e-commerce applications, where the
consensus is reached through trusted centralized authori-
ties. The introduction of centralized authorities incurs
additional cost, i.e., nominal fees which become more
excessive when the number of digital transactions grows.
In 2008, a new peer-to-peer electronic payment system
called “Bitcoin” was introduced that avoids this additional
cost caused by digital transactions [1]. As a popular digital
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin can record and store all digital
transactions in a decentralized append-only public ledger
called “blockchain”. The Bitcoin is the first application of
blockchain technologies with the Nakamoto consensus
protocol. Subsequently, the blockchain has attracted
remarkable public interests via a decentralized network
with independence from central authorities. With block-
chain, a transaction can take place in a decentralized fash-
ion, which greatly saves the cost and improves the
efficiency. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has
experienced an exponential growth, and its capital market
now has reached over 70 billion dollars [2]. After the
success of Bitcoin, blockchain has been applied in many
applications, such as vehicular networks [3], smart grid
systems [4], [5], and Internet of Things [6].
The core component of the public blockchain with the
Nakamoto consensus protocol is a computational process
called mining, where the transaction records are added into
the blockchain via the solution of computationally difficult
puzzle, i.e., the proof-of-work (PoW). Confirming and secur-
ing the integrity and validity of transactions are processed by
a set of peer nodes called “miners”. The security of blockchain
directly relies on the distributed consensus protocol main-
tained by these miners [7], [8]. The typical Nakamoto consen-
sus protocol works as follows. First, the miners choose and
bundle a number of transactions that are processed to form a
single “block”. Each miner broadcasts its mined block to the
rest of the blockchain network as soon as it solves the puzzle
in order to claim the mining reward. Then, this block is veri-
fied by the majority of miners in this network, i.e., to reach
consensus. After the broadcast block reaches the consensus, it
is successfully added into the globally-accessible distributed
public ledger, i.e., blockchain. The miner whichmines a block
receives the mining reward when its mined block is the first
one to be successfully added to the blockchain. This consensus
protocol guarantees the security of the PoW based blockchain
applications [9], [10].
However, the mining in blockchain applications involving
PoW is confined in dedicated mining equipments. The reason
is that mining in blockchains with the Nakamoto consensus
protocol incurs solving a PoW puzzle (i.e., a series of hashing
computation), which is a resource expensive process. As such,

cloud mining becomes a promising and viable option where
the miners purchase hashing capacity from the cloud
provider’s mining hardware already installed in data centers.
In this case, the miners with only lightweight devices are
enabled to participate in the PoW based blockchain mining
without involving the issues related to installingmining hard-
ware, managing electricity consumption, etc. Such service
exists in practice and somepopular providers, such asGenesis
Mining, CloudHashing, BootCloudChain, and MineOnCloud
offer hashing capabilities in exchange of a fee. A similar
emerging concept named EthereumFog that integrates block-
chain mining and edge computing has been recently real-
ized [11]. In EthereumFog, the miners are allowed to offload
themining task to nearby edge servers or devices. By integrat-
ing cloud/edge computing into the framework of blockchain,
more miners with lightweight devices are encouraged to par-
ticipate in mining, which is beneficial in terms of improving
the robustness of the blockchain. However, as the compensa-
tion to the cloud/edge providers providing the cloud/edge
computing service, the miners need to pay for the service cost.
Accordingly, the resource management among the cloud/
edge providers andminers turns up.
In this paper, we mainly study the interactions among
cloud/edge providers andminers to support the optimal allo-
cation of the computational resources. Therein, the cloud/
edge providers competitively sell computing service and in
turn receive revenue fromminers. In particular, we formulate
a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the first
stage, the cloud/edge providers set the price competitively
and obtain the revenue from charging the miners for offload-
ing the mining task. In the second stage, the miners decide on
the service demand to purchase from different cloud/edge
providers. Specifically, we consider the discriminatory pric-
ing scheme for the providers, in which different unit prices
are assigned to different miners.1 To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first work to study the interactions among
multiple competitive cloud/edge providers and a group of
miners in PoW based blockchain networks usingmulti-leader
multi-follower game-theoretic approach. One key challenge
in characterizing the game lies in the high dimensionality of
each miner’s strategy space, which impedes us from employ-
ing conventional backward induction method. To tackle this
challenge,we adopt theAlternatingDirectionMethod ofMul-
tipliers (ADMM) algorithm to obtain the optimum results in a
distributed manner. The main contributions of this work are
summarized as follows.
1) We formulate the interactions among cloud/edge
providers and miners as an Equilibrium Problem
with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), since there
exists equilibrium criteria at both the level of the pro-
viders and the level of miners due to the conflicts
among themselves.
2) Taking advantage of its decomposition and fast con-
vergence properties, we employ the ADMMalgorithm
to achieve the optimumresults in a distributedmanner
for such EPEC scenario, where centralized optimiza-
tion solutions are highly difficult and require great
complexity.
3) We conduct extensive numerical simulations to eval-
uate the performance of blockchain networks. The
results show that with the proposed algorithm, the
optimization of the utilities of miners and the profits
of providers can be jointly achieved. Our work helps
to achieve the PoW puzzle offloading and guide the
cloud/edge provider to strategically extract the sur-
plus through charging miners while competing with
other providers.
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2
presents a review of the related work. Section 3 describes the
systemmodel and formulates the multi-leader multi-follower
Stackelberg game. In Section 4, we investigate the game equi-
librium solutions using ADMM. We present the performance
evaluations in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 RELATED WORK
There have been many excellent work studying computation
offloading problems in the context of cloud/edge comput-
ing [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. For example, the authors in [12]
designed an optimization scheme for energy-efficient applica-
tion execution in cloud-empowered mobile application plat-
form. The authors in [13] presented a mobile edge computing
offloading framework and proposed a predictive computa-
tion mode transfer scheme to achieve low-latency communi-
cation. However, the above studies merely focused on the
cases of a single user or single cloud/edge provider. As such,
the authors in [15] formulated a multi-leader multi-follower
Stackelberg game model to solve the two-tier mobile edge
computing offloading problem. The computation offloading
mechanisms in [15] are centralized without considering the
interactions among multiple self-organizing users [16]. The
authors in [14] solved the energy-efficient workload offload-
ing in vehicular edge networks by using a distributed consen-
sus algorithm. Unlike the aforementioned studies, our work
proposed the cloud/edge computing offloading model in
PoW-based public blockchain networks. Furthermore, most
of the existing work on resource management in cloud/edge
computing formulated the computation offloading problems
by using constrained optimization and traditional game tech-
niques. Instead,we utilize the advancedAlternatingDirection
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently solve
the formulated game model with reasonable complexity in a
distributedmanner.
Further, a group of literature related to ourwork is themin-
ing schemes management for blockchain networks with the
Nakamoto consensus protocol. In [17], the authors developed
a noncooperative game among the miners. The miner’s strat-
egy is to select the number of transactions to be included in a
block. In the model, solving the PoW puzzle for mining is
modeled as a Poisson process. The solution of the game is the
Nash equilibrium which was derived only for two miners
in [17]. Then, the authors in [18] modeled the mining process
as a sequential game where the miners compete for mining
reward sequentially. Therein, the miners are assumed to be
rational, and they have to choose whether or not to broadcast
their solution, i.e., the mined block. It is proved in [18] that
1. The uniform pricing where a unit price is applied to all miners is a
special case of the discriminatory pricing, and hence the techniques
developed in the paper can be applied similarly and directly for uni-
form pricing.

there exists amultiplicity of Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, it
is found that not propagating is an optimal strategy under cer-
tain conditions. Similar to that in [18], the authors in [19] for-
mulated the stochastic game formodeling themining process,
where miners decide on which blocks to extend and whether
to broadcast the mined block. In particular, two game models
where miners play a complete information stochastic game
are studied. In the first model, eachminer broadcasts immedi-
ately its mined block. The strategy of each miner is to select an
appropriate block to mine. In the second model, the miner
selectswhich block tomine, but it maynot broadcast itsmined
block immediately. For both models, it is proved in [19] that
when the number of miners is sufficiently small, the Nash
equilibriumwith respect tomining behaviors exists.
Another research area relates to our work is the incentive
mechanisms in crowdsensing [20], [21]. In crowdsensing, the
crowdsensing service provider typically provides an incen-
tive reward to encourage the crowdsensing users’ participa-
tion. In one of the pioneering work [20], the authors
formulated the Stackelberg game to model the interaction
among the provider and users, where the provider deter-
mines the incentive reward and the users decide on the sens-
ing contribution level. Based on the same game model, the
authors in [21] proposed the socially-aware incentive mecha-
nisms for crowdsensing with the consideration of social net-
work effects that exist on the user side. The social network
effects indicate that the participants may derive more benefit
when more participants join and contribute their sensing
information to the services. It is proved that the social network
effects strongly promote the sensing contribution of partici-
pants aswell as the profit of the platform.
Previous studies mainly work on dedicated devices for
mining in general blockchain networks with the Nakamoto
consensus protocol. However, the application of blockchain
in wireless mobile networks is constrained by the challenge
brought by the PoWpuzzle during themining process. To sat-
isfy the requirement demand for the computing capacity and
storage availability in resource-limited devices, e.g., mobile
and IoT terminals, offloading the computing tasks to cloud/
edge provider is treated as a promising solution [22], [23],
[24]. In particular, some recent work investigated the exploita-
tion of cloud/edge computing for blockchain [25], [26], [27],
[28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In [25], we, for the first time, consid-
ered that users running blockchain applications on their
mobile terminals, can offload their PoW puzzle computations
to the cloud or nearby edge server operated by the cloud/
edge provider. In [26], [27], we formulated the interactions
among the single cloud/edge provider and a group of miners
using a Stackelberg game to maximize the profit of cloud/
edge provider and the utilities of miners. The authors in [28]
presented an auction-based market model to study the social
welfare optimization of the cloud/edge provider and miners.
The authors in [29] proposed to employ deep learning meth-
ods to solve the profit maximization issue in [26]. In [30], the
author proposed a novel resource trading architecture in
blockchain-based industrial Internet of Things with incom-
plete information, and applied a multi-agent reinforcement
learning algorithm for effectively searching the near-optimal
resource management policy. Reinforcement learning [33],
[34] is a promising tool to deal with the problem of informa-
tion uncertainty. The authors in [31], [32] studied the
computation offloading in wireless blockchain networks sup-
ported by cloud/edge computing for secure data trading.
Nevertheless, all the existing works made an unrealistic
assumption that there only exists a single cloud/edge provider,
which hardly captures the real-world scenarioswhere there are
multiple cloud/edge providers. Taking cloud mining for
example, CloudHashing, Genesis Mining, and MineOnCloud
can all act as cloud/edge providers to offer computing service
in exchange of the service fee. The interactions among cloud/
edge providers further complicate the corresponding mining
management and computing resource allocation.Nevertheless,
the competition among cloud/edge providers and its impacts
on the interactions on miners has not been explored yet. In
order to achieve the optimal resource management, modeling
and analyzing the competition among cloud/edge providers is
practical and necessary, which is the focus of ourwork.
3 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
In this section, we first propose the system model of cloud/
edge computing enabled blockchain networks. We then
present the problem formulation for the cloud/edge com-
puting resource management.
3.1 Blockchain Basics
Blockchain with the Nakamoto consensus protocol can be
employed to support peer-to-peer (P2P) secure data service,
e.g., P2P file transfer [35], [36]. To create a chain of blocks, the
mining needs to be performed. The mining process is used to
confirm and secure transactions to be stored in a block. This
mining process is organized as a speed game among the min-
ers with different computing powers. The problem is a PoW
puzzle, which is expensive to solve and takes high computing
power, time, and energy. In brief, this PoW puzzle includes
considering a set of transactions that are present in the net-
work, solving a mathematical problem2 that depends on this
set and propagating the result to the blockchain network for
this solution to be checked and reach consensus. Once all
these steps are done successfully, the set of transactions pro-
posed by the miner forms a block that is appended to the
blockchain. The first miner which successfully obtains the
solution of the puzzle and reaches the consensus is considered
to be the winner to which a certain reward is given. This is
referred to as the speed game among the miners under the
Nakamoto consensus protocol. The earlier studies, e.g.,
in [10], have found that the puzzle cannot be handled effi-
ciently using lightweight devices, e.g., mobile terminals. In
the following, we introduce to use the cloud/edge computing
concept for assisting to offload computational task, i.e., min-
ing process. The more details of blockchain networks and the
mining process can be found in [10].
3.2 System Model
Following [25], [26], [28], [29], [30], [37], we consider a pub-
lic blockchain supported by cloud/edge computing under
the PoW-based Nakamoto consensus protocol (See Fig. 1).
In the blockchain network, a set of N nodes with local
2. Solving the problem needs hashing the blockchain information by
the miners, and thus we use the hash power and computing power
interchangeably throughout the paper.

limited computing power want to participate in the consen-
sus process as miners and make extra profit through block
mining, which is denoted as N ¼ f1; . . . ; Ng. To participate
in the consensus process, these miners purchase the neces-
sary computing service from cloud/edge providers3 (e.g.,
Amazon EC2) without hassle of managing the infrastruc-
ture such as seeking extra electricity sources. As such, the
aforementioned PoW puzzle can be offloaded to the pro-
viders, and the offered computing service is priced by the
providers. We can consider the proposed scenario as a spe-
cific Decentralized Application (DApp) where blockchain
works as the dedicated backbone. From the perspective of
data processing, a DApp is a collection of smart contracts
and transaction data in blockchain. With public blockchain,
the realization of a DApp does not require a centralized
infrastructure. Instead, the DApp users are allowed to freely
enable their functionalities among transaction propagation
and consensus participation [10].
In particular, we consider a cloud/edge computing
enabled blockchain network with M providers and N min-
ers. A group of miners denoted as N ¼ f1; 2; . . . ; Ng access
and consume the computing service from a group of pro-
viders which is denoted as M ¼ f1; 2; . . . ;Mg. Let xij
denote the service demand of miner i 2 N from
provider j 2 M. Each miner i decides on its service demand
from different providers, denoted by xxi ¼ fxi1; xi2; . . . ; xiMg.
Then, let XX ¼D ðxx1; . . . ; xxNÞ and XX�i represent the service
demand profiles of all the miners and all other miners
except miner i, respectively. In addition, we consider that
each miner i has its initial computing power, denoted as li.
The service demand can be treated as the computing power
obtained from the providers. As such, the total computing
power of miner i 2 N with the service demand xij from dif-
ferent providers is given by
xtotal
i ¼ li þ
X
j2M
vijxij: (1)
Thus, the miner i has a relative computing power ai with
respect to the overall computing power of all miners, which
is formulated as follows:
aiðxxi;XX�iÞ ¼ xtotal
iP
k2N xtotal
k
¼ li þ
P
j2M vijxijP
k2N lk þ
P
i2N
P
j2M vijxij
; (2)
such that
P
k2N ak ¼ 1. Here, vij is the probability of miner i
to choose provider j for the computing service, andPM
j¼1 vij ¼ 1, i 2 N . For example, vij ¼ 1 (or vij ¼ 0) means
that miner i only consumes (or not consumes) the comput-
ing service from provider j.
Miners compete against each other in the mining game to
be the first one to solve the PoW puzzle and receive the con-
sequent mining reward. Following our previous works [25],
[26], [28], [29], we model the successful probability of miner
i to win the mining game, i.e., miner i wins the mining
reward, as follows:
Piðai; tiÞ ¼ aið1� PorphanðtiÞÞ; (3)
where ti denotes the size of the block mined by miner i, i.e.,
the number of transactions included in that block [17]. The
meaning of function PorphanðtiÞ is explained as follows. After
successfully solving the puzzle, the miner needs to broad-
cast its results to other miners for reaching consensus. How-
ever, the broadcast of the mining results in blockchain
suffers from a certain delay. Thus, it is possible that the
miner fails to be the first one whose mining results reach
the consensus because of long latency (even though this
miner finds the first valid block), which is called orphaning.
The function PorphanðtiÞ quantifies the above orphaning
probability.
Same as [25], [26], [28], [29], [30], [37], we consider that
block mining times follow the Poisson distribution, and the
orphaning probability is approximated as:
PorphanðtiÞ ¼ 1� e��ti ; (4)
in which the parameter � denotes the inter-arrival rate of the
Poisson distribution.4 Intuitively, the bigger the block is, the
more time needed to broadcast the block to the whole block-
chain network [38].
The mining reward is composed of a fixed reward
denoted byR, and a variable reward defined by rti which lin-
early increases with the size of block [17]. Meanwhile, the
miners need to pay the cloud/edge providers for the service
cost. Let pij denote the marginal price of provider j 2 M for
offering computing service to miner i 2 N . Then, the pricing
profile for provider j is denoted by ppj ¼ fp1j; p2j; . . . ; pNjg,
j 2 M. Eachminer i aims formaximizing its expected utility,
which is given as follows:
Fig. 1. Blockchain supported by cloud/edge computing under the
PoW-based Nakamoto consensus protocol.
3. We use the provider to denote the cloud/edge provider in the
following discussion for brevity.
4. The occurrence of solving the puzzle can be modeled as a random
variable following a Poisson process with mean � ¼ 1
600 sec [17]. Gener-
ally, the complexity of finding a block is dynamically adjusted so that
this operation takes T ¼ ��1 ¼ 600 sec in expectation. This is because
blocks are created at a rate of 1 every 10 minutes. Then, the mining Pois-
son process has a fixed parameter � for the whole network of miners.

Note that the resource may also include communic-
ation resource besides CPU time and energy. In this
regard, we can consider that the communication cost is
part of the price charged by the providers. In other
words, each provider offers the service as a bundle
which is composed of computing and wireless/wired
communication resources. The energy consumption for
the computing and communication is naturally accou-
nted in the bundle.
In addition to the revenue from charging the miners for
computing service, the providers have the service cost for
operation and maintenance. The cost is related to the electric-
ity consumption or hardware loss denote by cxi where c rep-
resents the cost coefficient. Therefore, each provider j
determines the pricing within the strategy space5 fppj ¼

Here, we adopt the incentive mechanism method pro-
posed in [39], and accordingly set the probability for each
miner i to choose provider j as
vij ¼ bijP
k2M bik
; (7)
where bij is the difference value between the largest price p
and the marginal price pij, similarly, bik is the motivation of
unit price reduction on computing service, i.e.,
bik ¼ p� pik; i 2 N ; k 2 M: (8)
In light of (7) and (8), the value of vij becomes larger,
provided that miner i accesses the service from provider
j with the lower price pij given the fixed pricing profiles
of other providers. As such, in order to encourage more
miners, each provider j 2 f1; 2; . . . ;Mg, inclines to offer
the lower price to miners. The reason is that miners are
more likely to consume the computing service from pro-
vider j when vij increases. This hence results in the pric-
ing competition among providers. We provide the
summary of notations in Table 1.
3.3 Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game
Formulation
Game theory has been regarded as a promising tool for
resource management to study the interactions among
the strategic agents. For example, in [40], the authors
employed the theory of game to formulate the resource
management problem in fog computing, and studied the
pricing strategies for the computing service provider.
The authors in [41] investigated the spectrum resource
allocation issues in the unlicensed spectrum to mitigate
the interference among multiple cellular operators. The
non-cooperative game was then developed to model the
interactions among the operators and users in unlicensed
system.
In this section, we model the interactions among
providers and miners as a multi-leader multi-follower
Stackelberg game with complete information,6 in which
we formulate the mathematical model of two sides. The
Stackelberg game has been widely adopted to capture
the sequential interactions among strategic agents, such
as [21], [42]. The providers act as the leaders to set
the price in Stage I. The miners act as the followers
to determine the service demand for offloading in
Stage II.
3.3.1 Miners’ Service Demand in Stage II
Given the pricing profiles of all providers (i.e., PP ¼
fpp1; pp2; . . . ; ppMg) and otherminers’ service demand (i.e.,XX�i),
the miner i decides on its computing service demand by
solving the followingmaximization problem:

Dmax in the second constraint denotes the maximum service
demand of one miner due to its limited total budget. Note
that each miner has no incentive to unboundedly increase
its service demand due to its financial burden.
3.3.2 Providers’ Pricing in Stage I
Considering the pricing profiles of other providers (i.e., PP�j)
as well as the service demand of all miners (i.e., XX), each
provider j 2 M determines its pricing profile ppj with the
objective to maximize the expected profit. Therefore, the opti-
mization problem for each provider is defined as follows:

Then, the profit maximization problem of provider j is for-
mulated as follows:

The key challenge in solving the formulated multi-leader
multi-follower game lies in the high dimensionality of each
miner’s strategy space, which impedes us from employing
conventional backward induction method. This exactly
motivates us to employ the ADMM algorithm to reach the
hierarchical social optimum point.
4 STACKELBERG-BASED ADMM ALGORITHM
ANALYSIS
In the framework of game theory, the miners and the pro-
viders are all assumed to be rational agents, which aim to
maximize their individual payoff. However, the maximiza-
tion of Pj for provider j influences the profits of other pro-
viders and utilities of all miners. Likewise, the maximization
of ui for miner i influences the utilities of otherminers and the
profits of all providers. Moreover, when the number of pro-
viders and miners is large, the centralized optimization solu-
tion that simultaneously maximizes all the payoff is
practically impossible. Therefore, there are no applicable
existing strategies yet to address the above problem.
Following [43], [44], [45], [46], we can treat the price pij as
the incentive factor offered by provider j to miner i, since the
provider can influence the service demand of miner xij by
controlling the price level. Therefore, we can formulate the
multi-leader multi-follower game problem in Section 3 as an
incentive mechanism design, which can lead to an optimum
result for the profits of providers in (11), while simultaneously
considering the utilities of miners in (9). By adjusting the
incentive factor pij, provider j 2 M can indirectly enable
miner i 2 N to choose the service demand xij such that the
provider’s profit, Pj is maximized. Specifically, the incentive
mechanismproblem is formulated as follows:

for all i 2 N and j 2 M.
The hierarchical optimization problem in (13) that con-
tains equilibrium problems at both the upper and lower
stages is a standard Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium
Constraints (EPEC). In such an EPEC scenario, the coordina-
tion of multiple conflicting interests, i.e., the utilities of min-
ers and the profits of providers, inevitably demand greater
complexity to address. To obtain the solution that can opti-
mize the profits of providers while simultaneously taking
the utilities of miners into account, we resort to the Alternat-
ing Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.
ADMM is known as a parallel optimization tool with
decomposition and fast convergence properties, which is
especially suitable for large-scale optimization problems.
4.1 ADMM Basics
We first briefly present the basic implementation of ADMM.
For ease of illustration, we consider a simple network with
one service provider and N users, in which the provider
aims to solve the following optimization problem
minimize

where hiðyiÞ is the cost for service provider jwhen it sells ser-
vice yi to user i. Specifically, hiðyiÞ is convex on yi, yi is a real
and scalar variable, andCi andDi are real, scalar constants.
Iteratively, the value of yy is updated by the provider such
that

It has been proved that the ADMM is guaranteed to con-
verge to the set of stationary solutions when hiðyiÞ is separa-
ble and convex [43], [44], [45], [46]. Note that for the case of
non-convex objective functions, the convergence of ADMM
can still be guaranteed under certain conditions [47].
4.2 ADMM-based Algorithm for Multi-Leader
Multi-Follower Game
In the following, we explain the iterated process of the
ADMM-based algorithm that is utilized to optimize the
profits of providers and utilities of miners in cloud/edge
computing-enabled blockchain. Each iteration consists of
two-stage optimization problem as follows:
1) Utility Optimization of miners: In this stage, each miner
i 2 N is able to observe the announced prices p
ðqÞ
ij at
the beginning of each iteration q, and decide on the
computing service purchased from each provider j xij,
to maximize its utility uiðxxiÞ. Note that the superscript
ðqÞ denotes the qth iteration of the ADMM in outer
loop. Each miner i aims to maximizing its individual
utility uiðxxiÞ to obtain the resulting values of xxi, which
forms the inner loop of the ADMM. Specifically, each
miner i updates the value of xxi at each iteration of the
inner loop as follows:
xx
ðqÞ
i ðtþ 1Þ ¼ argmaxðuiðxxðqÞi ÞÞ þ
XM
j¼1

ðqÞ
i ðtÞxij þC; (18)

and t ¼ tþ 1 if m < i, t ¼ t if m > i. Here, t is the
iteration step index of the inner loop. As aforemen-
tioned, r > 0 denotes the damping factor, and � is
the dual variable which will be updated as
�
ðqÞ
i ðtþ 1Þ ¼ �
ðqÞ
i ðtÞ þ r
XM
j¼1
x
ðqÞ
ij ðtþ 1Þ �Dmax
 !
: (20)
In each iteration of the outer loop q, the miners
obtain a set of values of service demand, x
ðqÞ
ij , which
maximize their utilities at the end of the inner loop.
In the mean time, such a set of values can be pre-
dicted by the providers, which will be utilized to
update the values of pij in the next stage.
2) Profit Optimization of providers: In this stage, the pro-
viders are aware of the behaviors of miners and hence
can predict the value of xij. Each provider j 2 M
adjusts the values of ppj within the strategy space that
maximizes its profit by invokingADMMas
pp
ðqÞ
j ðtþ 1Þ ¼ argmaxðPjðppðqÞj ÞÞ: (21)
The updated pricing profile p
ðqþ1Þ
ij are then announced
to the miners for next iteration, i.e., the ðq þ 1Þth itera-
tion. This forms the outer loop of the algorithm. The
outer loop endswhen the condition

PjðppðqÞj Þ �
X
j2M

is satisfied, where � is the predefined threshold.
The basic framework of the above ADMM algorithm is
shown in Algorithm 1. Essentially, after checking the utility
function and profit function of miner and provider, respec-
tively, we can conclude with the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The utility function of each miner i 2 N in (9),
and the profit function of each provider j 2 M in (11) are
strictly concave.
Proof. First, we take the first-order and second-order deriv-
atives of (9) with respect to xij, which can be written as
follows:

with respect to pij, which
can be expressed by (30) and (31). From (31), we know that
the upper bound of

B�pijð Þ4 . We
next resort to proving the negativity of 2Bpij

2ABpij, where 0 � pij � A, and A � B. We define the
following function gðpijÞ ¼ 2Bpij
2 þ �6B2 � 2ABð Þpij.
Clearly, the graph of function gð	Þ is a parabola curve, and
we observe that gð0Þ ¼ 0. As we have gðAÞ ¼ 2A2B�
6AB2 � 2A2B ¼ �6AB2 < 0, the negativity of gðpijÞ
within ½0; A� is satisfied, from which the concavity of Pj
follows. tu
As per [45], [46], if the optimization problems faced by
miners and providers are both convex, the ADMM can con-
verge to the optimum results, i.e., xx�
i , i 2 N and pp�j , j 2 M
in a distributed manner.
5 NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we show the simulation results to validate the
convergence performance of the ADMM algorithm to solve
the multi-leader multi-follower game. Moreover, by perform-
ing simulationwith different parameters, we evaluate the pay-
off as well as the strategies of providers and miners in cloud/
edge computing-enabled blockchain. Specifically, we consider
a group of N miners in the blockchain assisted by M cloud/
edge computing service providers under PoW-based Naka-
moto consensus protocol. We assume the size of a block to be
mined by miners ti follows the normal distributionNðmt; s
2
t Þ.
Likewise, the initial computing power of miners li also follows
the normal distributionNðml; s
2
l Þ. Unless otherwise specified,
the following simulation parameters are used by default [25],
[26]: M ¼ 3, N ¼ 60, � ¼ 10�2, p ¼ 100, ml ¼ 10, mt ¼ 200,
s2
l ¼ s2
t ¼ 5,R ¼ 104, r ¼ 20,Dmax ¼ 103, and c ¼ 10�1.
5.1 Convergence
We first show the convergence of ADMM-based iterative
algorithm in Fig. 2, for which we consider that there are 3
providers and 3 miners. For different miners, we consider
that their initial computing power are 0, 10, and 20. For dif-
ferent providers, we consider that the cost coefficients of
them are 0, 0.1, and 0.2. From Fig. 2, we first observe that
the profit of providers as well as the utility of miner all con-
verge quickly, where only a few iterations are required.
Moreover, we validate that the profit of Provider 1 after the
convergence is the highest as it has the lowest service cost
compared with other providers. We also observe that the
utility of miner is larger when its initial computing power is

higher from Fig. 2b. The reason is that the miner with local
computing power is able to save the cost of purchasing
more computing service for mining. As the initial comput-
ing power is higher, the cost savings is greater.
Fig. 3 illustrates the relation between the precision thresh-
old � versus the number of iterations required for convergence
when the number of miners and providers vary. From Fig. 3,
we observe that the relation between the required number of
iterations and lgð1=�Þ is approximately linear even when the
number of miners or providers increases, which confirms the
linear convergence as indicated in [43], [46]. This indicates
that the ADMM algorithm can be easily applicable to large-
scale optimization problems.
5.2 Performance Evaluation
We then evaluate the system performance forminers and pro-
viders under the proposedADMMalgorithm, as illustrated in
Figs. 4 and 5. In Fig. 4,we observe thatwith the increase of var-
iable reward, both the total computing service demanded by
miners and the total profit of providers increase. The reason is
that the increasing variable reward motivates the miners to
demand more computing service to win the mining, and
hence the total service demand increases. As a result, the pro-
viders achieve greater profit. Furthermore, we observe that
the total computing service demanded byminers and the total
profit of providers increase as mt decreases. The reason is that
when mt decreases, the average size of one block to be mined
becomes smaller. The propagation delay of mined block from
different miners does not differ much. This in turn increases
the mining competition among miners, and the miners hence
demand more computing service for mining. Consequently,
the total profit of providers is improved.
From Fig. 5, we observe that when the fixed reward
increases, the total utility of miners as well as the total profit of
providers increase. Similarly, this is also because the increased
fixed reward enhances greater incentive of miners, which
further increases the total utility ofminers. This in turn increases
the total computing service demanded by miners, and hence
the total profit of providers is improved aswell. In addition, we
observe that the total computing service demanded by miners
and the total profit of providers increases with the decreases of
ml. The reason is that theminers have greatermotivation to pur-
chase computing service from providers when the miners have
the limited local computing power. Therefore, the total comput-
ing service demanded by miners increases which improves the
total profit of providers. Moreover, when the local computing
power of miners is higher (higher ml), the miners are able to
save the cost of purchasing the computing service, which fur-
ther increases the total utility ofminers.
Lastly, we compare the system performance under the
ADMM-based competition and cooperation scenarios, as
shown in Fig. 6. In the cooperation scenario, the providers
cooperatewith each other in order tomaximize their aggregate
profit. We observe that the total profit of providers under the
cooperation scenario is higher than that under the ADMM-
based competition scenario. The intuition is that the providers
jointly optimize their aggregate profit under the cooperation
scenario, in which the providers will not offer the lower price
competitively to attract miners. Instead, the providers can
cooperatively encourage the miners to demand greater com-
puting service. In this case, the providers can further extract
more surplus from miners and hence the total utility of
miners decreases. Consequently, the total computing service
demanded increases and the total profit of providers increases
as well. The future studies on the collusive pricing of cloud/
edge providers can be conducted. Nevertheless, in the real

service market, the providers are selfish in nature, and hence
the cooperation scenario rarely happens.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the interactions among the
cloud/edge providers and miners in proof-of-work based
public blockchain networks, using a multi-leader multi-
follower game-theoretic approach. In particular, we have
employed the ADMM algorithm to achieve the optimum
results for both the miners and the providers in a distributed
manner. Finally, we have conducted the numerical simula-
tions to validate the convergence as well as evaluate the
network performance. The results have shown that with the
proposed solutions, the optimization for the utilities of miners
as well as the profits of providers are achieved jointly. This
work has some potential future directions. One is that we can
make the model more realistic by considering the mobility of
users as well as the characteristics of wireless channels
between different miners and their associated service pro-
viders. Nevertheless, we will further improve the practical
implementation of ADMM algorithm in future work. For
example, theADMMalgorithm cannot be applied easilywith-
out the accurate modeling parameters, e.g., utility formula-
tion. As such, we will explore how to predict such values of
parameters in a dynamic blockchain-empowered computing

service market, for example, by using the machine leaning
methods. It is also interesting to explore the practical imple-
mentation of ADMM algorithm. For example, the ADMM
algorithm cannot be applied easily without the accurate
modeling parameters. Specifically, we will study how to pre-
dict such values of parameters in a dynamic blockchain-
empowered computing service market, for example, by using
themachine leaningmethods [48].
