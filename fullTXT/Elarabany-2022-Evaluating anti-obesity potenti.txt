Abstract
There are no medical drugs that provide an acceptable weight loss with minimal ad-
verse effects. This study evaluated the Moringa peregrina (MP) seed extract's anti- 
obesity effect. Twenty- four (6/each group) male Sprague Dawley rats were divided 
into group Ι (control), group ΙΙ (high- fat diet [HFD]), group ΙΙΙ (HFD+	MP	[250 mg/kg	
b.wt]), and group ΙV (HFD+	MP	 [500 mg/kg	b.wt]).	MP	 administration	 significantly	
ameliorated body weight gains and HFD induced elevation in cholesterol, triglycerides, 
LDL, and reduced HDL. Moreover, MP seed oil showed high free radical- scavenging 
activity, delayed β- carotene bleaching and inhibited lipoprotein and pancreatic li-
pase enzymes. High- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed three 
major  active components: crypto- chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, and astragalin. Both 
quantitative Real- time PCR (RT- PCR) and western blotting revealed that MP seeds 
oil significantly decreased the expression of lipogenesis- associated genes such as 
peroxisome	proliferator-	activated	receptors	gamma	(PPARγ) and fatty acid synthase 
(FAS)	and	significantly	elevated	the	expression	of	lipolysis-	associated	genes	(acetyl-	
CoA	carboxylase1,	ACCl).	The	oil	also	enhanced	phosphorylation	of	AMP-	activated	
protein	kinase	alpha	(AMPK-	α)	and	suppressed	CCAAT/enhancer-	binding	protein	β (C/
EBPβ). In conclusion, administration of M. peregrina seeds oil has anti- obesity potential 
in HFD- induced obesity in rats.
Practical applications
M. peregrina seeds oil had a potential anti- obesity activity that may be attributed to 
different mechanisms. These included decreasing body weight, and body mass index 
and improving lipid levels by decreasing total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL- C, 
and	increasing	HDL-	C.	Also,	M. peregrina seeds oil regulated adipogenesis- associated 
genes,	such	as	downregulating	the	expression	of	(PPARγ, C/EBPα,	and	FAS)	and	im-
proving	and	upregulating	the	expression	and	phosphorylation	of	AMPKα	and	ACCl.	
Despite that M. peregrina extract has reported clear anti- obesity potential through 
animal and laboratory studies, the available evidence- based on human clinical trials 
are very limited. Therefore, further studies are needed that could focus on clinical 
trials investigating anti- obesity potential different mechanisms of M. peregrina extract 
in humans.

1  |  INTRODUC TION
In the last four decades, obesity worldwide rates have tripled and are 
constantly elevating in pandemic areas (Kinnunen et al., 2021). Thus, 
it represents a global public health issue (Kinnunen et al., 2021). 
Obesity	 and	 overweight	 are	 serious	 risk	 factors	 for	 many	 non-	
communicable	disorders	including	musculoskeletal,	kidney	and	car-
diovascular diseases, some cancers, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, 
and other chronic disorders (Nyberg et al., 2018). Elevated body mass 
index	(BMI)	is	the	fourth	leading	cause	of	risk-	associated	mortality,	
with	a	declined	life	expectancy	of	5–	20 years,	depending	on	comor-
bidities and condition severity (Kinnunen et al., 2021). Moreover, 
global health costs related to obesity and its complications are esti-
mated to be about 2 trillion US$ (Fan et al., 2021). If obesity preva-
lence remains on its elevating trend, almost half of the world's adult 
population could be obese or overweight by 2030, imposing even 
greater economic, social, and personal costs (Fan et al., 2021).
There are several ways to reduce weight, including pharmaco-
logical agents; however, some of them have withdrawn from the 
market	 for	 safety	 concerns	owing	 to	 their	 side	effects	 (Onakpoya	
et al., 2016). Other strategies were used, such as reducing energy 
intake,	rising	physical	activity,	and	increasing	polyphenols-	rich	food	
consumption (lead to great satiety and fat oxidation as well as energy 
expenditure) (Kinnunen et al., 2021). There are almost no pharma-
cological therapies that give continuous weight loss with negligible 
unfavorable side effects (Khera et al., 2016). So, many efforts have 
been done to reduce body weight using pharmacological treatments 
that possess minimal adverse effects (Xie et al., 2021). In handling 
several chronic conditions owing to their efficacy, herbal supple-
ments are being vastly used (Fan et al., 2021). When compared to 
chemically synthesized drugs, they have minimum/no toxic side ef-
fects and are cheap (Kinnunen et al., 2021). Herbals cover several 
natural products, including plant crude extracts and isolated com-
pounds	(Atanasov	et	al.,	2021).
One of the most widely naturalized and distributed monogeneric 
family species is Moringa peregrina which has several nutritional and 
medicinal values related to its fruits, seeds, leaves, flowers, roots, 
and	bark	(Islam	et	al.,	2021). M. peregrina	like	other	Moringa	family	
contains terpenoids, glycosides flavonoids, tannins, and saponins, 
all of which possess medicinal benefits (Islam et al., 2021). These 
compounds also possess effective antimicrobial, anti- carcinogenic, 
and antioxidant potential, and thus they can aid the immune sys-
tem (Islam et al., 2021). These effective roles are mediated through 
decomposing peroxides, free radicals neutralization, or quenching 
singlet or triplet oxygens (Islam et al., 2021). In addition, tannins 
and saponins have been related to reduced energy needs for lipid 
and protein biosynthesis, leading to growth performance, nutrient 
utilization, energy retention, and declined body lipid (Dongmeza 
et al., 2006). Thus, such components have been reported to have 
efficient anti- obesity potential (Islam et al., 2021).
This study aimed to evaluate the potential of M. peregrina seeds 
extract to control obesity. This aim was obtained by determining 
body weight, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, different antioxi-
dant assays, proteins, and genes expression associated with lipogen-
esis and lipolysis in male Sprague Dawley rats.
2  |  MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1  |  Plant material
Seeds of M. peregrina	were	obtained	from	a	local	market	in	Riyadh,	
KSA.	Then,	500 g	of	uncoated	seeds	were	dried	by	air	and	turned	
to powder using a scientific blender. Methanol was used for ex-
traction	by	soaking	20 g	of	seeds	crushed	with	1	L	of	solvent	and	
left	overnight.	After	evaporating	the	solvent,	the	remaining	plant	
material was further extracted twice with the same solvent to 
maximize the yield. Oil was purified by Soxhlet apparatus which 
was applied for oil extraction by dichloromethane/methanol (1:1, 
v/v)	 mixture	 (Abd	 El	 Baky	 &	 El-	Baroty,	 2013; Cequier- Sánchez 
et al., 2008).
2.2  |  High- performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC)
On	reverse-	phase	Zorbax	Eclipse	XDB-	C18	column	(4.6	× 150 mm,	
5 μm),	HPLC	(Agilent	1000)	analysis	of	M. peregrina extract phenolic 
compounds	was	performed.	According	to	Öztürk	et	al.	(2007), a gra-
dient	program	is	used	including	two	solvents	system	(A:	acetic	acid	
(0.5% in acetonitrile)/water (1/1) B: acetic acid (2% in water)) at a 
constant solvent flow rate of 1.2 ml/minute. The injection volume 
was	20 μl.	By	UV–	VIS	detection,	signals	were	detected	at	280 nm.	All	
solutions were prepared with deionized water.
2.3  |  Animals
Twenty-	four	male	Sprague	Dawley	 rats	 (110–	120 g)	were	 included	
and	kept	in	Laboratory	Animal	House,	King	Saud	University,	Riyadh,	
Saudi	Arabia.	Randomly,	they	were	assigned	into	four	groups,	with	
six rats per group. For acclimation and adaptation, rats were fed 
ad libitum control diets formulated according to National Research 
Council (1995) (see Table 1	for	ingredient	composition)	for	2 weeks,	
maintained under natural daylight rhythm and room temperature. 
According	to	Axen	and	Axen	(2006) and Kilany et al. (2020), obesity

was induced in rats by feeding HFD (see Table 1 for ingredient com-
position)	for	12 weeks.	The	study	design	was	approved	by	the	ethical	
committee of King Saud University.
2.4  |  Animals groups
Animals	were	divided	into	four	groups	as	follows:
Group Ι (control): received a control diet during the whole exper-
imental period.
Group ΙΙ (negative control): received HFD all over the experi-
mental period.
Group ΙΙΙ	 (Dose	 1):	 received	 HFD	 all	 over	 the	 12 weeks	 and	 
M. peregrina	seeds	oil	(250 mg/kg	b.wt/day)	by	intragastric	adminis-
tration	for	the	last	8 weeks.
Group ΙѴ	 (Dose	 2):	 received	 HFD	 all	 over	 the	 12 weeks	 and	 
M. peregrina	seeds	oil	(500 mg/kg	b.wt/day)	by	intragastric	adminis-
tration	for	the	last	8 weeks.
The MP doses used in this experiment was chosen according 
to	previous	 reports	where	doses	300	 to	600 mg/kg	MP	produced	
anti- obesity and anti- hyperlipidemic effects on high- fat- diet- fed rats 
(Alkhudhayri	et	al.,	2021). Moreover, Moringa oleifera was shown to 
exhibit potent hypolipidemic and anti- obesity effects in a similar an-
imal	model	at	doses	of	200,	400,	and	600 mg/kg	(Bais	et	al.,	2014; 
Metwally et al., 2017).
2.5  |  Body weight, blood sampling, and 
biochemical parameters
To obtain weight gain, final body weights were compared to initial 
weights for each rat. From each rat after overnight fasting, under the 
effect of diethyl- ether anesthesia, a retro- orbital venous blood sam-
ple was drawn and collected in a plain tube to separate sera. Serum 
levels of high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL- C), triglycerides, 
and	total	cholesterol	were	determined	by	Spinreact,	Spain	kits.	By	
the formula of Friedewald et al. (1972), low- density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL- C) was determined.
After	 blood	 samples,	 all	 rats	 were	 euthanized	 by	 an	 overdose	 of	
diethyl-	ether.	Adipose	 tissue	 from	mesenteric,	perirenal,	and	epidid-
ymal sites were dissected out, rinsed with phosphate buffer solution 
and	weighed	 immediately	 then	 stored	 in	 −80	until	 the	beginning	of	
analysis.
2.6  |  2,2′- diphenyl- 1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
antioxidant assay
M. peregrina seeds oil radical scavenging activity against DPPH radi-
cal was determined according to a previous method described by 
Zhu et al. (2015). In a 96- well plate, 10 μl of positive control solutions 
(31.25–	1000 μM,	Trolox	and	Ascorbic	acid)	or	adequate	diluted	sam-
ples	were	mixed	with	190 μl	of	methanol	solution	of	DPPH	(0.1 mM).	
After	 30	 min	 of	 reaction	 in	 darkness	 at	 room	 temperature,	 reac-
tion	mixture	absorbance	was	detected	at	517 nm	with	a	microplate	
reader	(Tecan	Infinite	M200	PRO,	TECAN,	Männedorf,	Switzerland).	
At	the	same	time	in	this	assay,	methanol	was	used	as	a	blank	control,	
and all controls and extracts were screened in triplicate. DPPH inhi-
bition percentage was computed and measured using the following 
equation: Inhibition rate (%) =	[(AbC − AbS)/AbC] × 100,	where	AbC is 
the	blank	control	absorbance	value,	Abs is the tested sample absorb-
ance value, and the IC50 value was obtained when DPPH free radi-
cals were inhibited by 50%.
2.7  |  2,2′- azinobis- (3- ethylbenzthiazoline- 6- 
sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay
M. peregrina	 seeds	oil	ABTS	 radical	 scavenging	activity	was	deter-
mined according to a previous method by Zhu et al. (2015).	Working	
ABTS+	 (radical	 cation)	 (Sigma-	Aldrich,	USA)	 solution	was	prepared	
by	mixing	potassium	persulfate	(4.9 mM	in	H2O)	and	ABTS	solution	
(7 mM	 in	H2O) in equal quantities, and allowed them to react, for 
12–	16	h,	in	darkness	at	room	temperature.	Appropriately,	ABTS+ so-
lution was diluted with methanol to achieve an absorbance value at 
734 nm	of	0.70 ± 0.10.	After	that	in	a	96-	well	plate,	the	mixture	solu-

solution	(31.25–	1000 μM)	and	ABTS+	solution	(190 μl) was incubated 
in	 darkness	 for	 30	min	 before	 reading	 the	 absorbance	 at	 734 nm.	
Vitamin	C	was	used	as	positive	control	and	methanol	as	blank.	All	
controls	and	extracts	were	tested	in	triplicate.	ABTS	assay	IC50 value 
was calculated at different concentrations using the same formula 
described in the DPPH assay.
2.8  |  Pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory assay
M. peregrina seed oil's ability to inhibit PL was determined using 
p- NPB (P- nitrophenyl butyrate) as the substrate according to Kim 
et al. (2007). Enzyme buffer was obtained by adding PL (10 units, 
30 μl)	in	1 Mm	EDTA	(pH	6.8),	10 mM	MOPS	and	850 μl of Tris- buffer 
(pH	 7.0;	 100 mM	 Tris-	HCl,	 5 mM	 CaCl2).	 With	 880 μl of enzyme 
buffer,	 the	 test	 sample	 (100 μl) was mixed and incubated at 37°C 
for	15	min.	Then,	the	substrate	solution	(20 μl;	10 mM	p-	NPB)	was	
added	and	the	enzymatic	reaction	was	allowed	at	37°C	for	15 min.	
By	 measuring	 P-	NPB	 hydrolysis	 to	 P-	Nitrophenol	 at	 405 nm,	 the	
lipase	activity	was	measured	using	an	ELISA	 reader.	 Lipase	 inhibi-
tion =	1	(Absorbance	of	sample	× 100)/Control.
2.9  |  β - carotene- linoleic acid activity
β- carotene and linoleic acid oxidation inhibition were measured ac-
cording to a previously described method by Ndhlala et al. (2014). In 
brown Schott bottle, 10 mg β- carotene was dissolved in chloroform 
(10 ml). Under vacuum, excess chloroform was evaporated resulting 
in β- carotene thin film near to dryness. Immediately to this thin film, 
200 μl of both linoleic acid and Tween 20 were added and mixed with 
497.8	 ml	 distilled	 water,	 giving	 the	 final	 β- carotene concentration 
(20 μg/ml). By vigorous agitation, this solution was further saturated 
with oxygen to form an orange- colored emulsion. Into test tubes, 
200 μl of M. peregrina	seeds	oil	or	butylated	hydroxytoluene	(6.25 mg/
ml)	were	dispensed	 to	 this	emulsion	 (4.8	ml),	giving	a	 final	 reaction	
mixtures	concentration	(250 μg/ml).	At	470 nm,	absorbance	for	each	
reaction was immediately (t = 0) determined. Then after incubation at 
50°C,	absorbance	was	measured	every	30	min	for	180	min.	Instead	of	
the sample, 50% methanol was used as a negative control. β- carotene 
bleaching rate was calculated using the following formula: rate of 
bleaching (R)= { In (At = 0)∕ (At = t) } × 1∕ t ,	Where:	At = t is the ab-
sorbance at time 90 min and At = 0 is the absorbance of the emulsion 
at	0	min.	Average	rates	were	used	to	measured	antioxidant	activity	
(ANT),	 and	expressed	as	 inhibition	percent	of	β- carotene bleaching 
rate:	%	ANT	=	((R	control-	R	sample)/(R	control)) × 100.
2.10  |  Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) assay
In	15-	ml	glass	test	tubes,	diluted	(25 units;	0.5	ml)	LPL	(Sigma-	Aldrich,	
USA)	 and	 0.5	ml	 of	 each	M. peregrina extract concentration were 
mixed and preincubated for 30 min at 4°C. Then to initiate hydrolysis, 
1 ml of prepared substrate emulsion was added to the mixture and 
incubated	 in	a	water	bath	at	37°C.	After	30	min,	the	reaction	was	
stopped	by	NaCl	(2.0	ml,	1	M,	Sigma-	Aldrich).	Concurrently,	controls	
were carried out with enzymes mixture and substrate only, without 
plant extracts. Liberated free fatty acids were then titrated with 
standardized	NaOH	(0.01 M)	to	pH	9.2.	The	liberated	free	fatty	acid	
amount was calculated from the amount of base added as previously 
described	(Chung	&	Scanu,	1974).
2.11  |  Western blotting
The total protein was extracted from adipose tissues using the Tri- 
Fasted	 kit	 (Peqlab,	 VWR	 Company,	 USA).	 According	 to	 Bradford	
method (Bradford, 1976)	using	a	reference	range	(0–	150 μg) of bo-
vine	serum	albumin	(BSA),	the	protein	concentration	was	determined	
based on the interaction between protein and Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue G250 (CBBG- 250) in acidic conditions. Extracted proteins were 
separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis	(SDS-	PAGE).	Separated	proteins	were	transferred	onto	
Hybond™ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare Biosciences, UK). With 
5%	BSA,	each	membrane	was	blocked	for	30	min.	Then,	membranes	
were incubated overnight separately at 4°C with primary antibod-
ies	[AMPK	α	(SAB4503754,	Sigma	Aldrich,	USA),	AMPK	(A	769662,	
Creative	 Biolabs),	 Anti-	C/EBP	 α	 Antibody	 (sc-	365,318	 Santa	 Cruz	
Biotechnology,	CA,	USA),	and	β-	actin	(1:2000,	ORIGENE,	USA)].	The	
next day using PBS plus Tween 20, membranes were washed five 
times. Then, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room tempera-
ture with goat anti- mouse/anti- rabbit secondary antibody conju-
gated to horseradish peroxidase (0.1– 0.5 μg/ml,	R&D	Systems,	USA)	
before they were washed five times with PBS plus Tween 20. Finally, 
protein bands were visualized and quantified with GraphPad Prism 
software	(San	Diego,	CA,	USA).
2.12  |  Quantitative gene expression using real- time 
PCR (qRT- PCR)
Total	 RNA	 was	 extracted	 from	 adipose	 tissues	 according	 to	
kit	 (TRIzols,	 15,596,026,	 Life	 Technologies,	 USA)	 instructions.	
Extracted	RNA	(1	μg)	was	used	to	synthesize	cDNA	(Qiagen,	USA),	
which then was amplified using SYBR Green master mix (Thermo 
Scientific,	 USA)	 for	 peroxisome	 proliferator-	activated	 receptor	
gamma	(PPARγ),	fatty	acid	synthase	(FAS),	and	acetyl-	CoA	carboxy-
lase	(ACCl).	The	primer	sequences	for	studied	genes	are	presented	
in Table 2. Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method in the CFX96 
Touch™	(Bio-	Rad	Co.,	USA).
2.13  |  Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using version 20 SPSS (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago).	 Variables	 were	 represented	 as	 mean ± SD. The ANOVA

3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  HPLC analysis
HPLC (Figure 1) was used for qualitative and quantitative analy-
sis of M. peregrina	 seeds	 extract.	 It	 revealed	 three	 major	 peaks	
corresponding to crypto- chlorogenic acid (at 7.01 min, con-
centration =	 36.61 μmoL/L), isoquercetin (at 19.91 min, con-
centration =	 20.11 μmoL/L), and astragalin (at 25.1 min, 
concentration =	14.48 μmoL/L).
3.2  |  Body weight, BMI, and lipid profile
After	obesity	 induction,	 rats'	body	weight	and	body	mass	 index	 in	
group II significantly (p < .05)	 increased	 in	control	 (group	I).	M. per-
egrina	 seeds	oil	 administration	 in	both	groups	 III	 (250 mg/kg	b.wt)	
and	IV	(500 mg/kg	b.wt)	significantly	decreased	final	body	weights	
and body mass index as compared to group II (p < .05,	 Table 3). 
Compared to the control group, HFD was reported to significantly 
enhance obesity induction (p < .05,	group	II)	with	elevation	in	choles-
terol, triglycerides, and LDL- C levels. Rats treated with M. peregrina 
seeds oil significantly decreased the former biochemical parameters 
than of group II (p < .05),	and	sometimes	their	levels	were	compara-
ble to controls. In contrast, HDL- C levels significantly dropped after 
HFD administration in group II (p < .05)	 and	M. peregrina seeds oil

3.3  |  M. peregrina seeds oil extract antioxidant and 
anti- obesity activities
In	 this	 study,	 we	 used	 different	 assays	 (DPPH,	 ABTS,	 β- carotene 
bleaching, Pancreatic, and Lipoprotein lipases assays) to assess 
and compare the anti- obesity and antioxidant potentials of M. per-
egrina	 seeds	oil.	 In	 the	case	of	250 mg/kg	b.wt	dose,	 IC50 values of  
M. peregrina seeds oil extract were 29.41 ± 1.1,	93.3	± 5.4,	59.81	± 4.0,	
55.14 ± 4.0,	 and	 47.82	 ± 3.1	 for	 DPPH,	 ABTS,	 β- carotene bleach-
ing, pancreatic, and lipoprotein lipases assays, respectively. Dose  
500 mg/kg	 b.wt	was	more	 active	 and	had	 IC50 values of 22.64 ± 0.8,	
89.7	± 4.2,	72.54	± 3.5,	34.84	± 2.9,	and	77.8	± 4.0,	respectively	(Table 4).
3.4  |  M. peregrina seeds oil inhibits lipogenesis and 
activates AMPK signaling
Western	 blotting	 for	AMPK	and	AMPKα proteins was used to in-
vestigate whether M. peregrina seeds oil has an inhibitory effect 
on	 lipogenesis	 due	 to	 AMPK	 activation	 or	 not.	 Results	 revealed	
that M. peregrina seeds oil significantly increased the expression of 
both	AMPK	(Figure 2a)	and	AMPKα (Figure 2b) proteins in a dose- 
dependent manner. Moreover, M. peregrina seeds oil significantly 
decreased the expression of the lipogenesis- associated protein (C/
EBPα) (Figure 2c). Interestingly, real- time PCR also revealed that 
M. peregrina seeds oil significantly decreased the expression of 
lipogenesis-	associated	genes	(PPARγ	and	FAS)	and	significantly	ele-
vated	the	expression	of	the	lipolysis-	associated	genes	ACCl	(Table 5).
4  |  DISCUSSION
Obesity is a condition that is associated with many chronic 
complications development, such as hormonal imbalance, dys-
lipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperglycemia and, 
thus,	 it	 is	 the	 main	 risk	 for	 elevated	 mortality	 and	 morbidity	
(Ali	Redha	et	 al.,	2021). There are no medical drugs or pharma-
cological management that provide an acceptable weight loss 
with	 minimal	 adverse	 effects	 (Müller	 et	 al.,	 2021). Previous 
studies regarding the lethal dose (LD50) value of some M. spe-
cies	reported	that	its	extract	was	safe	and	nontoxic	up	to	5	g/kg	
body weight (Bais et al., 2014). Some M. family members such as  
M. oleifera were reported to have wound healing, antifertility, 
anti- inflammatory, diuretic, antiulcer, and anti- obesity proper-
ties	 (Ali	Redha	et	al.,	2021). But, still, limited pieces of evidence 
are available for M. peregrina's anti- obesity potential. Hence, the 
study has been aimed to demonstrate the effect of M. peregrina 
seeds oil in high- fat- diet- induced obesity.
In this study, weight gain and relative fat mass were increased 
in	the	HFD	group	compared	to	the	control	group.	Also,	HFD	stim-
ulated the elevation in cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL- C levels.

In contrast, HDL- C levels were significantly (p < .05)	 dropped	
after HFD administration. These results were in agreement with 
Kostrycki	et	al.	(2019) and may be attributed to higher energy in-
take	 in	 the	HFD	 group	 that	 leads	 to	weight	 gain	 consequent	 to	
the elevated fat mass. Treatment with M. peregrina seeds oil ex-
tract revealed a significant reduction in body weight, cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and LDL- C and a significantincrease in HCL- C that 
was in harmony with previous findings such as these of Kilany 
et al. (2020), Bais et al. (2014), and Nahar et al. (2016), and similar 
results were achieved with the administration of MP leaves ex-
tract	(Alkhudhayri	et	al.,	2021).
These findings suggested the hypolipidemic effect of M. pere-
grina seeds oil extract as well as its ability to reduce fat mass and 
body weight.

M. peregrina seeds oil extract administration perfectly amelio-
rated oxidative stress induced by obesity and promoted antioxidant 
reserve (Kilany et al., 2020). Because of natural phytochemicals' 
complexity and their different modes of action, it is imprecise to 
determine the antioxidant potential by only a single method (Xu 
et al., 2019). Thus, in this study, we used different assays (DPPH, 
ABTS,	 β- carotene bleaching, pancreatic, and lipoprotein lipases) 
to assess the anti- obesity and antioxidant potentials of M. pere-
grina seeds oil. In a dose- dependent manner, M. peregrina seeds oil 
showed	high	DPPH	and	ABTS	radical-	scavenging	activity.	Also,	 its	
antioxidant activity was reported in the light of delayed β- carotene 
bleaching and inhibiting lipases enzymes.
M. peregrina's antioxidant effects may be associated with its great 
content of various natural antioxidant types such as ascorbic acid, 
β-	sitosterol,	vitamin	A,	phenolic	compounds,	glycosides,	terpenoids,	
flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and β-	carotene	 (Anwar	et	 al.,	2007; 
Lopez- Teros et al., 2017). Compared to a single antioxidant, these 
antioxidants combination in M. oleifera has been reported to have 
more efficacy owing to elevated antioxidant cascade mechanisms 
and their synergistic mechanisms (Tejas et al., 2012). Due to their 
ability to prevent free radicals, from hydroperoxides decomposition, 
and formation, phenolic compounds act as primary antioxidants 
(Kilany et al., 2020). These compounds constitute the main corner-
stone in the decomposition of peroxides, neutralizing free radicals, 
and quenching singlet/triplet oxygen (Kilany et al., 2020).
Crypto- chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, and astragalin were reported 
to be major active components in M.	extracts	(Vongsak	et	al.,	2013). 
Here, HPLC analysis revealed that these amino acids were the pure 
active components of M. peregrina seeds oil extract. These acids are 
powerful natural antioxidant agents that possess several potential 
pharmacological activities including inflammation attenuation, derma-
titis inhibition, antihypertension, cellular protective effect, anti- obesity, 
and	reduction	of	organ	and	plasma	lipids	(Vongsak	et	al.,	2013).
Adipogenesis	 is	 regulated	 by	 several	 genes	 including	 PPARγ 
(Ebrahimi et al., 2020).	Also,	PPARγ regulates lipogenesis and adi-
pogenesis	by	inducing	some	enzymes	activity	such	as	FAS	and	ACC	
involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipid synthesis (Ebrahimi 
et al., 2020). Here, real- time PCR revealed that M. peregrina seeds 
extract significantly decreased the expression of lipogenesis- 
associated	 genes	 (PPARγ	 and	 FAS)	 and	 significantly	 elevated	 the	
expression	of	ACCl.
Adipogenesis	 and	 adipocyte	 differentiation	 are	 the	 main	 rea-
sons	 for	 obesity	 (Sethi	 &	Vidal-	Puig,	2007). It is regulated by the 
expression of many transcription factors such as C/EBPα, which are 
activated at different stages during the adipocyte differentiation 
process to regulate genes expression in adipocytes, and gradually 
activate adipocyte metabolism and differentiation (Esteve Ràfols, 
2014).
Also,	 adipogenesis	 may	 be	 inhibited	 by	 enhancing	 the	 degree	
of	 phosphorylation	 of	 AMPK-	α, decreasing triglyceride content 
and suppressing C/EBPβ, a transcription factor that is commonly 
attributed	 to	 cellular	 PR	 peregrination	 regulation	 (Ali	 Redha	
et al., 2021).TA

In this study, western blotting revealed that M. peregrina seeds 
extract	 significantly	 enhances	 AMPK-	α expression which in turn 
inhibited adipogenesis and reduce triglyceride content in tested 
models, also MP seeds oil suppressed C/EBPβ, a transcription factor 
responsible for activation of adipocyte metabolism and differentia-
tion. Our results were in agreement with many previous studies (Kim 
et al., 2020; Muni Swamy et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2018).
In conclusion, M. peregrina seeds oil extract had a potential anti- 
obesity activity that may be attributed to different mechanisms. 
These included decreasing body weight, improving lipid levels by 
decreasing total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL- C, and increas-
ing	HDL-	C.	Also,	M. peregrina seeds extract regulated adipogenesis- 
associated	genes,	such	as	downregulating	the	expression	of	(PPARγ, 
C/EBPα,	 and	FAS)	 and	 improving	 and	upregulating	 the	expression	
and	phosphorylation	of	AMPKα	and	ACCl.	Despite	that	M. peregrina 
seeds extract has reported clear anti- obesity potential through ani-
mal and laboratory studies, the available evidence- based studies on 
human clinical trials are very limited. Therefore, further studies are 
needed that could focus on clinical trials investigating anti- obesity 
potential mechanisms of M. peregrina seeds extracted in humans.
