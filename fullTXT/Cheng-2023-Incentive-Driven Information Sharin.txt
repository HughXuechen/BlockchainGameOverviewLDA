Abstract: Blockchain technology (BCT) provides a new way to mitigate the default risks of lease
contracts resulting from the information asymmetry in leasing. The conceptual architecture of a
consortium blockchain-based leasing platform (CBLP) is first proposed to facilitate information
sharing between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, the “lessees”) and leasing firms (LFs,
the “lessors”). Then, based on evolutionary game theory (EGT), this study builds a two-party game
model and analyzes the influences of four types of factors (i.e., information sharing, credit, incentive–
penalty, and risk) on SMEs’ contract compliance or default behaviors with/without blockchain
empowerment. The primary findings of this study are as follows: (1) SMEs and LFs eventually
evolve to implement the ideal “win–win” strategies of complying with the contract and adopting
BCT. (2) The large residual value of the leased asset can tempt SMEs to conduct a default action
of unauthorized asset disposal, while leading LFs to access the CBLP to utilize information shared
on-chain. (3) When the maintenance service is outsourced instead of being provided by lessors, the
maintenance fee is not a core determinant affecting the equilibrium state. (4) There is a critical value
concerning the default penalty on-chain to incentivize the involved parties to keep their commitments.
(5) The capability of utilizing information, storage overhead, and security risk should all be taken
into consideration when deciding on the optimal strategies for SMEs and LFs. This study provides
comprehensive insights for designing an incentive mechanism to encourage lessees and lessors to
cooperatively construct a sustainable and trustworthy leasing environment.

1. Introduction
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) typically encounter capital constraints
when buying heavy machinery and industrial equipment for manufacturing, such as
forklifts, trucks, hoists, etc. [1]. To cut back on the capital expense, leasing an asset from
the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Leasing Firm (LF) is a common and
economical option to meet the demand for equipment [2]. Leasing has become a popular
financing instrument [3].
In general, a lessee (e.g., SMEs) selects the required equipment, and then a lessor
can directly lease the asset they manufacture (if the lessor is the OEM) or purchase the
requested asset from the OEM for leasing it out (if the lessor is an LF, such as a financial
institution or a firm that specializes in leasing), with the lessee paying rent to the lessor in
exchange for using the asset [4]. When the leasing service period expires, the lessee may
opt to retain, renew, or return the leased equipment depending on the lease’s contractual
provisions. The leasing business emphasizes the separation of ownership and uses the
rights of the leased asset [5].

Compared with purchasing, although leasing is more flexible and cost-efficient for
a lessee, the current leasing business could encounter some challenges, such as lacking
knowledge about the lessee’s credit history, being unable to fully track assets in real time,
and failing to discover any default behavior arising from the information asymmetry.
Blockchain technology (BCT) stores data in a tamper-proof ledger that can be shared P2P
among many nodes without the aid of a reliable third party [6], which can help to transmit
data efficiently and accurately among multiple organizations, particularly in the area
of equipment leasing (asset management). Hence, in general, the lessee and lessor are
encouraged to participate in information sharing on the blockchain.
Nonetheless, it is challenging for lessees or lessors (particularly for SMEs) to develop
or participate in a blockchain-based application system (especially for the consortium per-
missioned blockchain system) due to the budget constraints of the BCT membership fee,
heavy data storage (computation) charges, and other barriers [7]. Meanwhile, considering
that stakeholders may maliciously handle sensitive data, the participants might be reluctant
to share critical information with other parties [8] unless sufficient incentives nudge the lessee.
However, previous researchers have not performed a quantitative exploration of stakeholders’
BCT-participating behaviors in the context of leasing, where there is a trade-off between the
factors of information sharing, credit, incentive–penalty, and risk. On the other hand, although
there exists some research relating to the blockchain applied in leasing, the interactive behav-
iors among lessees and lessors rarely receive adequate attention. Hence, our study aims to
bridge this gap by addressing the following research questions.
(1) How can the blockchain technically drive information sharing and storage between
the SME (the “lessee”) and LF (the “lessor”)?
(2) How to incentivize excellent lessees to share more information while expecting that
rational lessees and lessors can both maximally benefit from the leasing business
empowered by BCT.
(3) How can the lessee and lessor adjust their behavior strategies to ensure that all parties’
payoffs reach equilibrium through continuous trial-and-error learning?
To address these questions, we need to accomplish the following research objectives.
First, a conceptual architecture of a consortium blockchain-based leasing platform (CBLP)
is devised, suitable for information sharing among SMEs and LFs in a P2P distributed
network. Secondly, we employ evolutionary game theory (EGT) to formulate a game model,
taking fully into consideration the four kinds of factors (i.e., information sharing, credit,
incentive–penalty, and risk) that affect the leasing strategies involving the two game parties
(lessee and lessor). Finally, the main impacting results are discussed in-depth, and policy
implications are provided on the ground.
In addition, compared with other similar works investigating BCT strategies using the
evolutionary game, the novelty and contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:
(1) Our evolutionary game model is developed on the blockchain-based leasing business
(specifically the operating lease) in manufacturing, which pays more attention to the
SME’s leasing behavior (i.e., making the rental payment, reverting the leased asset,
maintenance responsibility, and asset monitoring) dynamically changes with the BCT
adoption/non-adoption strategy. This study can mitigate the shortcomings of today’s
leasing management.
(2) We provide a more comprehensive analysis demonstrating that the four factors of
“information sharing, credit, incentive–penalty, and risk” dynamically impact the lessee’s
complying performance on the LC and the lessor’s decision-making on BCT adoption.
More importantly, we carefully consider technical barriers faced by the organizational
players when implementing BCT, such as on-chain and off-chain storage overheads,
leasing transaction verification overheads, and credit assessment in BCT.
(3) Based on the game analysis, our experimental results can support LFs (the “lessor”) in
comprehensively understanding how SMEs (the “lessee”) meet the obligations in the
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 208
LC and give some implications to policymakers when designing a proper incentive
mechanism on the lease.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a theoretical
background of the leasing business, BCT, leasing empowered by BCT, and the evolution-
ary game integrated with BCT. Section 3 exhibits the CBLP composed of SMEs and LFs.
Section 4 states the problem description. Section 5 builds the game model. Section 6
provides a mathematical analysis of the model stability. Section 7 conducts a numerical
simulation. Some recommendations and policy implications are provided in Section 8.
2. Literature Review
The following subsections will give an overview of crucial terminologies (i.e., leasing
and BCT), the state of the art of BCT-based leasing, and BCT strategies using evolutionary
game theory, which serve as a solid theoretical background for this study. After that, the
main challenges in conventional leasing are highlighted.
2.1. Definition of Leasing
SMEs typically need to decide between leasing and buying an expensive heavy asset
(such as real estate, transportation equipment, industrial equipment, etc.). In recent years,
leasing assets has become a popular financing tool for SMEs to solve capital problems in the
supply chain [9]. According to the Accounting Standard IAS 17, “a lease is an agreement
whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for payment or series of payment
the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time” (see, e.g., European Commission,
2012) [10]. From an accounting perspective, there are two types of lease, a capital lease and
an operating lease [11]. In a capital lease, the lessor transfers the ownership of the asset to
the lessee at the end of the lease. In contrast, an operating lease only allows the lessee to
have the right to use the assets. Still, it requires the asset to be reverted to the lessor, such
that the lessor will either re-lease the asset in another LC or sell it to release the residual
value. At present, the operating lease dominates the leasing market.
Concerning the determinants in default actions of the LC, Kaposty et al. [12] defined
an LC as having defaulted when the lessee becomes insolvent or the lessor terminates
the contract due to an overdue payment owed by the lessee. The latter case is consid-
ered in this study. Difficulty in repossessing the leased asset is also one of the results of
defaulting [13]. Altman et al. [14] discovered that a lessee with poor creditworthiness
defaults more easily, resulting in higher default losses. On the other hand, Kysucky and
Norden [15] revealed that reducing information asymmetry between the lessee and lessor
could motivate the lessee to maintain its reputation to obtain future leases. In addition,
an exhaustive inspection of asset maintenance and disposals plays an essential role in
contract defaults [12]. However, the current leasing system lacks the ability to reliably
record real-time information (including the documents) about the leased asset’s operational
activity, which hampers the lessor’s ability to ensure the lessee’s compliance with the LC.
2.2. Blockchain Technology (BCT)
Blockchain Technology (BCT) was initially proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, and it enables
transactions to be encapsulated in data blocks and appended to a ledger as a chain struc-
ture [16]. It allows distributed and mutually distrustful nodes validate transactions through
consensus mechanisms while utilizing cryptography (i.e., public–private key encryption and
hash functions) to ensure data integrity. By its nature, blockchain technology makes transac-
tions synchronous, non-reversible, immutable, and traceable in distributed databases, enabling
organizations to store and share reliable data without double-checking [17]. Blockchain tech-
nology can effectively solve the problem of information asymmetry [18] and monitor the
asset’s operation in real time, which helps the lessor to alleviate the default risks caused by a
low-credit lessee [19]. Therefore, it is beneficial to encourage SMEs (the “lessee”) to use BCT
and energetically participate in information sharing.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 209
BCT is generally classified as the permissionless blockchain and the permissioned
blockchain [20], depending on whether or not nodes are granted to participants in a
blockchain network [14,17]. The permissionless blockchain, also called public blockchain,
is open access, allowing any node to participate in the consensus procedure, such as
Bitcoin and Ethereum. The permissioned blockchain can be further categorized into private
permissioned blockchain, in which whitelisted participants in one organization are selected
in advance to join the invitation-only network, and a consortium permissioned blockchain,
which is operated under the control of several authorized organizations allowing the
identifiable participants to execute certain on-chain actions, such as Quorum, Hyperledger
Fabric, and Corda. The consortium blockchain is becoming popular with enterprises, where
a group of companies collaboratively use the blockchain to improve business processes. Any
organization can apply to join the blockchain network, but only authorized organizations
granted membership are allowed to write or read information on-chain [21]. This study
is dedicated to introducing a consortium permissioned blockchain jointly maintained by
the OEM, SMEs, LFs, third-party maintenance centers (MCs), and regulators. At present,
blockchain has been widely used in many industries for sharing information, such as supply
chain [22], energy [23], healthcare [24], industrial manufacturing [25], smart cities [26], and
online education [27].
2.3. BCT Application in Leasing
Currently, there is relatively limited research on the application of BCT in the leasing
business. Most research focuses on how BCT fosters information exchange through the
lifecycle of the leasing process and improves the efficiency and transparency of leased
asset management. For instance, to address the issues of lengthy negotiation cycles and
cumbersome financing procedures caused by information asymmetry, IBM proposed a
crane leasing model based on the IBM Blockchain Platform that requires the identity of the
leased crane to be registered on the blockchain and leasing transactions to be recorded on the
leasing blockchain [28]. Leased physical aircraft can be tokenized via blockchain, facilitating
asset management [13]. In addition, several researchers are particularly interested in BCT-
based car-leasing. Auer et al. [29] developed a prototype blockchain-IoT-based car-leasing
platform, demonstrating that the blockchain can facilitate collaboration among stakeholders
to some extent while relying on the appropriate balance among factors such as security,
authenticity, traceability, scalability, etc. It also emphasizes considering storing car-renting
events on- or off-chain to support scalability, as agreed by Faber et al. [30]. To address
the problem of inefficiency in delivering and searching records, Agyekum et al. [31] used
Ethereum to construct a car-leasing platform that enables the transfer of ownership of
a leased car by invoking a transaction on the blockchain, hence helping the regulator to
clearly monitor every leasing transaction.
The aforementioned cases imply the following potential benefits of the blockchain
applied in leasing: (1) Stakeholders (such as lessors) spend less time verifying the leasing
information’s authenticity on-chain, since the blockchain can record lease contracts and
financial transactions in a non-editable way, which reduces the credit investigation cost [32].
(2) Smart contracts deployed on a distributed ledger can help automate some lease pay-
ments or ownership transfers, speeding up the processing of rental transactions [33]. (3) All
historical events associated with the leased assets’ operation and maintenance and the
provenance-related financing activities are objectively recorded by multiple nodes on-chain,
which could guarantee asset traceability and data credibility in the leasing business [34].
Hence, BCT is conducive for SMEs and LFs to effectively choose the suitable potential
lessor/lessee to sign the LC.
2.4. Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is derived to explore the behavior of the large popu-
lation of boundedly rational agents who repeatedly engage in strategic interactions under
incomplete information circumstances [35]. In contrast with classic game theory, EGT
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 210
has the advantage of analyzing how the game player would dynamically change their
own strategic decisions over time through learning and adapting to the other’s strategic
decisions [36]. There is a core concept in EGT named evolutionary stable strategy (ESS),
which, if adopted by all players, means that the game cannot be invaded by alternative
strategies [37]. Several researchers have applied EGT to leasing issues. For example, to
study the safety supervision of town crane operation, Chen et al. [38] established a tripartite
evolutionary game model, which reveals that when the penalty amount resulting from
poor crane supervision is greater than the total safety investment cost, the stakeholders will
apply strict supervision strategies to the asset.
In addition, some scholars have conducted similar works deciding whether to adopt
BCT using evolutionary game theory. However, most of them focus on the supply chain
(finance). For instance, Su et al. [39] constructed a tripartite game model to explore BCT in
relation to the evolutionary stability strategies among CEs, SMEs, and FIs, discovering that
relatively large default losses can help SMEs to repay receivables on time. Tang et al. [40]
used an evolutionary game to demonstrate that BCT can effectively facilitate informa-
tion sharing in supply chain collaborations. Sun et al. [41] established an evolutionary
game model to reveal that BCT impacts credit risk, which plays a vital role in decid-
ing whether financial institutions accept factoring applications in supply chain finance.
Song et al. [42] analyzed a tripartite game model of an agricultural supply chain, discover-
ing that blockchain operation costs significantly affect the behaviors of governments and
agricultural enterprises.
Based on the above literature analysis, it can be found that most research mainly
focuses on proposing a blockchain-based leasing scheme or using EGT to study the SME’s
BCT strategies in the supply chain. Nevertheless, our work not only provides a consortium
blockchain-based leasing platform (CBLP) to streamline the information sharing between
lessees and lessors, but also contributes to establishing a two-player evolutionary game
model analyzing the lessee’s leasing behaviors (i.e., complying with or defaulting on the
LC) considering whether to adopt BCT for information sharing. This study will shed light
on the long-term development of the leasing industry.
3. Description of Consortium Blockchain-Based Leasing Platform (CBLP)
Since the evolutionary model that this study will construct is of significant relevance
to information storage (i.e., on- and off-chain) and consensus mechanisms (i.e., Raft with
credit evaluation and transaction verification), in this section, it is necessary first to present
the conceptual architecture of the proposed consortium blockchain-based leasing platform
(CBLP), and then the transaction verification process will be concisely explained.
3.1. Conceptual Architecture of CBLP
This research first provides a consortium blockchain-based leasing platform integrated
with RFID devices [43], which incorporates stakeholders such as OEM, SMEs, LFs, MCs,
and regulators. The platform is built by using Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) [44], which is an
enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain platform facilitating information sharing among
multiple organizations [45,46]. In general, an authorized node is required to pay fees to
access the consortium blockchain [47]. In the distributed ledger, only organizations with
valid IDs can process transactions. More specifically, all authorized lessees and lessors
have their PKI-CA certificate and unique Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) registered on a
blockchain with restricted access [48,49]. By scanning the RFID sensor tags encapsulated in
the DID, the running condition of the leased asset is recorded as a transaction, which is then
turned into a “block” and appended to the ledger. This means that the lessee cannot refute
or alter the historical logs of equipment operation and maintenance. This data reliability
is conducive to efficiently managing the whole life cycle of the physical leased asset [50],
which can help to reduce the inspection costs during the leasing period. It is also critical for
each participant involved to be certain about the asset traceability in case of fraud, damages,
dispossession, or misdisposition.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 211
On the other hand, due to the large data sets shared by many various stakeholders,
there is a need to consider data storage and scalability challenges when assessing to what
extent SMEs are willing to adopt BCT [51]. Our work leverages a hybrid on-chain and
off-chain storage mechanism to store and access information (especially complexity data)
on the CBLP [52,53]. Specifically, the encrypted raw data (e.g., file) are stored on an off-
chain cloud storage provider (CSP) or distributed storage system (e.g., InterPlanetary File
System, IPFS) [54]. The off-chain data are linked with the specific metadata via a hash
pointer, which is stored as a transaction validated to the ledger and can be used to audit the
off-chain data that were not modified [55]. The architecture of CBLP with on- and off-chain
information storage mechanisms is shown in Figure 1.

information storage mechanisms is shown in Figure 1.

3.2. Raft Consensus Based on Credit 
Since various transactions are executed through triggering relevant smart contracts 
(e.g., lease contract, asset ownership transfer contract, lease payment contract, data shar-
ing contract) using multiple organizational nodes, a consensus protocol is used by the 
CBLP. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the transactions are recorded in an agreed 
order on-chain. Meanwhile, to avoid the untrusted consortium stakeholders uploading

Meanwhile, to avoid the untrusted consortium stakeholders uploading false information
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 212
or changing the private data content on-chain to comply with the contract, we use a Raft
consensus algorithm combined with “credit” incentives to maintain the blockchain. That is,
an SME (Org-lessee node A) and an LF (Org-lessor node B) adopt the flow of “execute–order–
validate” to record the transactions on-chain [45]. This is the most fundamental transaction
process of Hyperledger Fabric at present and will not be elaborated on further due to the
limitations of this paper’s length, while it is depicted in Figure 2.

false information or changing the private data content on-chain to comply with the con-
tract, we use a Raft consensus algorithm combined with “credit” incentives to maintain 
the blockchain. That is, an SME (Org-lessee node A) and an LF (Org-lessor node B) adopt the 
flow of “execute–order–validate” to record the transactions on-chain [45]. This is the most 
fundamental transaction process of Hyperledger Fabric at present and will not be elabo-
rated on further due to the limitations of this paper’s length, while it is depicted in Figure 
2. 
 
Figure 2. Transaction flow in Hyperledger Fabric with Raft consensus algorithm. 
Notably, the Raft consensus protocol follows the “leader and follower” architecture 
[56,57] to implement the ordering service, where the leader nodes are dynamically elected 
from the Consenter Set and a node’s credit value determines whether it can join the Con-
senter Set [58]. When the credit value exceeds a predetermined threshold, the node can 
join the Consenter Set as a consensus node. On the contrary, when the credit is lower than 
the minimum threshold, the node will face a penalty imposed by the CBLP. In addition, 
we propose that the credit value is increased or decreased according to the contract com-
pliance or default behavior of the (SME) Org-lessee node in the leasing business; the more 
frequently it conforms to the lease contract, the higher its credit value and the greater the 
likelihood is that the node will be selected as the “Leader” in the Consenter Set to package 
transactions into a new block and finalize it. Credit assessed for the SME cannot be treated 
as an indicator of the lessee’s reputation and contribution to the leasing business. Still, it 
can help the enterprise earn more recognition and achieve more lease financing opportu-
nities from lessors, encouraging each lessee to share information on the CBLP [58]. 
In summary, based on the right balance of the above on- and off-chain storage costs 
and credit incentive mechanisms, the nodes will choose to actively comply with the LC 
and upload authentic information on-chain by joining the consortium blockchain for 
larger gains, resulting in the eventual emergence of a Nash equilibrium. 
4. Problem Description 
In this section, we will first describe the problem we studied. The basic lease scenario 
explored in this study is provided to better understand the game model. Afterward, the 
critical parameters are elucidated and presented in Table 1.

4.1. Description of Problem
The game model involves two types of players in a lease: the lessee (i.e., an SME) and
lessor (i.e., an LF). Under a conventional lease, the SME is responsible for paying fees for the
right to use an asset leased from the LF, and generally, the SME as a lessee must maintain
the asset to ensure that it remains in an operational condition [59]. The LF will pay the
credit investigation cost to evaluate whether an SME can pay its rent on time. Meanwhile, it
is difficult for the parties to immediately share information (including the historical default
records) and for the LF to monitor the leased equipment/assets in real time. Applying BCT
can solve the aforementioned issues [29]. If the LF requires the SME to join the consortium
so as to upload information (such as historical asset operation documents or payment
performance, etc.) on the CBLP, not only can a credit review be instantly conducted, but
the ownership and provenance of the leased asset can also be tracked in real time through
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 214
the asset’s operation. Moreover, a smart contract can be automatically executed to make
the lease payment as agreed in the lease contract (LC), which results in the synergetic gains
of the leasing process and improves the efficiency of asset management empowered by the
blockchain [60]. If stakeholders can share and process a greater quantity of information
on-chain, thereby significantly improving the precision of the decisions made by each party,
it is essential to take into consideration the corresponding data storage overheads, security
exposure, and transaction verification costs when practically using BCT. Once the SME
and LF adopt the CBLP, they need to be subject to harsher punishments resulting from
defaulting behavior, which undermines the enterprise’s reputation on the whole network.
In addition, a blockchain-based credit evaluation mechanism can enhance the effective
management of the leased asset, which is also conducive to mining reliable data blocks in
the distributed ledger.
Therefore, this study intends to model the problem that considers the SME and
LFs individual decision-makers concerning “complying with or defaulting on the LC”
and “accessing or not accessing the CBLP” and to comprehensively analyze the dynamic
influence of the four factors (i.e., information sharing, credit, incentive–penalty, and risk)
on the choice of strategy by using evolutionary games.
4.2. Basic Lease Scenarios
The game model is constructed based on an operating lease with respect to heavy
equipment (e.g., forklifts, trucks, and hoists) in the manufacturing supply chain. Generally,
the equipment is relatively expensive to purchase, and leasing it is a better option for SMEs.
The LF (the “lessor”) first acquires an asset from an OEM and lends the asset to the SME
(the “lessee”) for a specific term in exchange for periodic rental payments. Once the LC is
signed, the SME has the right to use the asset, whereas the ownership of the leased asset
remains with the LF. Therefore, the SME must comply with the contract, not only paying
the full rent on time but also reverting the asset to the LF at the maturity date of the lease;
otherwise, the SME will pay the penalty for their default. In addition, the LC specifies that
the lessee takes responsibility for the maintenance and outsources it to the OEM or MCs
other than the lessor (LF in this case).
4.3. Model Parameters
Rental Payments (R): Rental payments refer to the monthly/quarterly rent that the
SME (the “lessee”) pays to the LF (the “lessor”).
(1) Return rate (r1, r2): Return rate refers to the yield that can be earned when completing
the investment activity on the lease.
(2) Reinvestment rate (r3): Reinvestment rate refers to the yield that the lessee expects to
earn when it does not pay or defers the full rental price, which can be put into other
investments for extra gains.
(3) Maintenance fee ( f ): Maintenance fee refers to the cost of carrying out maintenance
actions to ensure that the leased asset is in a proper operating condition. In this
study, the LC states that the maintenance service must be provided by MCs and
completed until the lease termination—the maintenance fee is not embedded in the
rental payment.
(4) Loss rate (ε): Loss rate refers to the loss that could result from the lessee’s defaulting
behavior—for instance, if the lessee defaults by not returning the leased asset at the
end of the lease, which cannot be re-leased to the next lessee upon termination of the
previous LC.
The relevant parameters’ notations and definitions are shown in Table 1.
5. Model Formulation
In this section, an evolutionary game model between the SME (the “lessee”) and the
LF (the “lessor”) is developed. Before the mathematical payoff matrix is constructed, some
assumptions are first provided.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 215
5.1. Basic Assumptions
Assumption 1 (A1): Rational Participants Assumption.
All participants in the game are boundedly rational [61]. Nodes with constrained
computing power may not be able to perfectly utilize all of the information on-chain owing
to hardware faults or network congestion. Under asymmetric information, each node will
constantly select the optimal strategy to maximize its interests while being affected by
multiple factors and will eventually reach a state of equilibrium [62,63].
Assumption 2 (A2): Strategy Selection Assumption.
Assume that the SME (the “lessee”) chooses to “comply with or default on the LC”
with the respective probability of x or 1− x, x ∈ [0, 1]. The LF (the “lessor”) chooses to
“access or not access the CBLP”, utilizing the information shared by stakeholders with the
respective probability of y or 1− y, y ∈ [0, 1].
Assumption 3 (A3): Default Behavior Assumption.
For the SME’s unilateral default behavior, assume that it consists of two primary
actions: one is not making the full rental payment by the due date, and the other is failing to
return the leased asset to the lessor when the LC expires (for simplicity, this study considers
that the two actions simultaneously occur when modeling).
Assumption 4 (A4): Information Sharing Assumption.
The quantity of information shared by the player is Zi, and the ability of each player
to process and utilize the information on-chain [40] is uj, which depends on the computing
power. Hence, the amount of effective information on-chain that the SME or the LF obtains
from each other is, respectively, uAZB and uBZA.
Assumption 5 (A5): Credit Assumption.
Assume that each SME will be assigned a credit value ∆vc, which increases with the
LC compliance performance. The higher the credit value owned by the SME, the greater
the possibility of the enterprise becoming the “Leader” in the Raft Consensus Protocol
(Section 3.2) to validate the lease transaction on each consensus round, so improving the
lessee’s reputation and recognition on-chain.
Assumption 6 (A6): Incentive–Penalty Assumption.
After the SME participates in information sharing, if the enterprise breaches the LC or
tries to tamper with the existing LC to legalize the default behavior on-chain, this has a
profoundly negative effect on the leasing business, hence making the SME’s default penalty
intensity larger under the CBLP—that is, p2 > p1. The penalty can be deducted from the
lessee’s token deposit by executing a smart contract of transferring transactions [64].
Assumption 7 (A7): (Technology) Risk Assumption.
BCT can improve the data transmission efficiency (ϕ) end-to-end, but meanwhile, each
player has to bear the data validation on-chain (ω) and storage costs off-chain (λ) due to
the blockchain’s storage limitations. The player also may suffer security risks (η), such as
data leakage risks and network attack risks [65]. This has practical implications, in that the
benefits of sharing information outweigh the relevant costs after joining the blockchain
network, ϕ > ω + λ + η.
Assumption 8 (A8): Other Cost Assumption.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 216
A8.1: The blockchain can record the SME’s credit history as tamper-resistant and traceable data [66],
and if the SME joins the blockchain network, the marginal credit investigation cost (Ct) will shrink
and asymptotically approach zero.
A8.2: In leased asset management empowered by BCT, the LF can continuously monitor the
condition of the leased asset at lower costs [67]—as such, C1 > C2.
5.2. Payoff Matrix
In this model, there are four different strategies. Considering that the model is compli-
cated to understand, based on the above lease scenario and assumptions, this subsection
will thoroughly explain the players’ payoff under each strategy.
(1) Strategy I: S1 = {Comply, Access}
Since the SME (the “lessee”) fully abides by the LC, and the LF accesses the CBLP,
taking advantage of information sharing on-chain, this results in the SME obtaining the re-
wards of successfully mining the block I, effective information utilization
[(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB], the return on the lease Rr1, the incentive σ given by the
LF (the “lessor”), plus the credit value; however, the SME has to make the payments of
rental R, maintenance fee f , and the consortium membership cost Cb.
On the other hand, the LF obtains rent R, the return on the lease Rr2, effective informa-
tion utilization [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA], synergy gain g on the lease empowered by
BCT, plus the residual value of the leased asset vs after receiving the leased asset returned
from the SME, while bearing the cost of purchasing the asset from the OEM at price C0,
monitoring cost C2, and the consortium membership cost Cb.
Therefore, in Strategy I, the payoffs of the SME and LF are formulated as in
Equations (1) and (2), respectively.
PS1
A = I + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB] + R(r1 − 1) + σ + ∆vc − f − Cb (1)
PS1
B = R(r2 + 1) + vs + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA] + g− C0 − C2 − Cb (2)
(2) Strategy II: S2 = {Default, Access}
Due to default actions (Section 4.2.), the SME uses the rent to perform re-investment
and dispose of the leased asset that has been exhaustively used for manufacturing at the
end of the lease. Therefore, it gives the SME the chances to earn extra re-reinvestment
return Rr3 and sell the leased asset at the market value of the residual vs. Adopting the
BCT provides the SME with effective information utilization [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB].
However, to continuously keep the leased asset effectively operating without impacting
production, the SME still needs to pay the maintenance fee to the MC (instead of the LF)
and will be punished in p2 resulting from the default actions.
Meanwhile, although the LF can obtain the effective information utilization empow-
ered by the BCT, the default behavior by the SME not only causes the LF to be unable
to receive the rental payment R, but also leads to it losing the further earnings Rε from
re-leasing to other lessees due to the out-of-control of the leased asset when the rental
period is complete. The asset acquiring cost C0, monitoring cost C2, and the consortium
membership cost Cb occur.
Therefore, in Strategy II, the payoffs of the SME and LF are formulated as in
Equations (3) and (4), respectively.
PS2
A = Rr3 + vs + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB]− f − p2 − Cb (3)
PS2
B = [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA]− Rε− C0 − C2 − Cb (4)
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 217
(3) Strategy III: S3 = {Comply, Not-access}
When the SME actively keeps to the stipulations of the LC, the SME earns the invest-
ment return Rr1 on the lease and is rewarded by the LF with the incentive σ. However, the
SME needs to pay the maintenance fee f to ensure that the leased asset is in good condition.
For the lessor, the LF not only obtains benefit Rr2 from the leasing activity, but it also
retains the value of the leased asset vs at the end of the LC. Nonetheless, the insufficient
credit record integrity of the SME forces the LF to incur credit audit expenses Ct before
making a decision on the lease. The costs (C0, C1) of acquiring and monitoring the leased
assets are ineluctable.
Therefore, in Strategy III, the payoffs of the SME and LF are formulated as in
Equations (5) and (6), respectively.
PS3
A = R(r1 − 1) + σ− f (5)
PS3
B = R(r2 + 1) + vs − C0 − Ct − C1 (6)
(4) Strategy IV: S4 = {Default, Not-access}
Based on the above Strategies II and III, the SME will always earn the reinvestment
return Rr3 and residual value vs, but it may also suffer from the default punishment p1. In
addition, although the SME will resell the leased asset by defaulting, the enterprise has
to take responsibility for maintaining it f to ensure that the leased asset remains in an
operational condition for manufacturing.
If the SME breaches the LC without joining the blockchain network, the LF does not get
any returns, and may even be charged with the costs in credit auditing Ct, asset acquiring
C0, and monitoring C1.
Therefore, in Strategy IV, the payoffs of the SME and LF are formulated as in
Equations (7) and (8), respectively.
PS4
A = Rr3 + vs − f − p1 (7)
PS4
B = −Rε− C0 − Ct − C1 (8)
Consequently, the profit matrix of the two-party game is shown in Table 2.

6. Model Stability Analysis
This section will first construct the replicator dynamic equations between the SME and
LF and then will discuss in depth how the two rational players reach an equilibrium state
through iteratively changing strategies. A mathematical sensitivity analysis on each type of
factor (i.e., information sharing, credit, incentive–penalty, risk) will ultimately be provided.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 218
6.1. Replicator Dynamic System
Based on the above evolutionary game payoff matrix, we can calculate the expected
returns of the SME (the “lessee”) and LF (the “lessor”) when they choose different strategies,
and then construct the replicator dynamic equations for each subject.
6.1.1. Replication Dynamic Equation of the SME
Assuming the expected return of the SME’s compliance with and, defaulting on the
LC, the average returns are Ex, E1−x, and Ex, respectively. Then:
Ex = y[I + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB] + R(r1 − 1) + σ + ∆vc − f − Cb]
+(1− y)[R(r1 − 1) + σ− f ]
(9)
E1−x = y[Rr3 + vs + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZA + uAZB]− f − p2 − Cb]
+(1− y)(Rr3 + vs − f − p1)
(10)
Ex = xEx + (1− x)E1−x (11)
The replication dynamics equation (RDE) [68] of the SME is denoted as follows:
F(x) = dx
dt
= x
(
Ex − Ex
)
= x(1− x)(Ex − E1−x)
= x(1− x)[y(I + ∆vc + p2 − p1) + (r1 − r3 − 1) R + σ + p1 − vs]
(12)
Let F(x) = 0, and we obtain the stationary point of the differential equation as follows:
x∗1 = 0, x∗2 = 1 (13)
y∗ =
(1 + r3 − r1)R + vs − σ− p1
I + ∆vc + p2 − p1
(14)
Based on Equation (14), we can discover that, as shown in Figure 3:

Based on the above evolutionary game payoff matrix, we can calculate the expected 
returns of the SME (the “lessee”) and LF (the “lessor”) when they choose different strate-
gies, and then construct the replicator dynamic equations for each subject. 
6.1.1. Replication Dynamic Equation of the SME 
Assuming the expected return of the SME’s compliance with and, defaulting on the 
LC, the average returns are 𝐸 , 𝐸 , and 𝐸 , respectively. Then: 𝐸 = 𝑦 𝐼 + (𝜑 − 𝜔 − 𝜆 − 𝜂)𝓏 + 𝑢 𝓏 + 𝑅(𝑟 − 1) + 𝜎 + ∆𝑣 − 𝑓 − 𝐶+ (1 − 𝑦) 𝑅(𝑟 − 1) + 𝜎 − 𝑓  (9) 
𝐸 = 𝑦 𝑅𝑟 + 𝑣 + (𝜑 − 𝜔 − 𝜆 − 𝜂)𝓏 + 𝑢 𝓏 − 𝑓 − 𝑝 − 𝐶+ (1 − 𝑦)(𝑅𝑟 + 𝑣 − 𝑓 − 𝑝 ) (10) 
𝐸 = 𝑥𝐸 + (1 − 𝑥)𝐸  (11) 
The replication dynamics equation (RDE) [68] of the SME is denoted as follows: 𝐹(𝑥) = 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑡  = 𝑥(𝐸 − 𝐸 ) = 𝑥(1 − 𝑥)(𝐸 − 𝐸 ) = 𝑥(1 − 𝑥) 𝑦(𝐼 + ∆𝑣 + 𝑝 − 𝑝 ) + (𝑟 − 𝑟 − 1) 𝑅 + 𝜎 + 𝑝 − 𝑣  
(12) 
Let 𝐹(𝑥) = 0, and we obtain the stationary point of the differential equation as fol-
lows: 𝑥∗ = 0, 𝑥∗ = 1 (13) 
𝑦∗ = (1 + 𝑟 − 𝑟 )𝑅 + 𝑣 − 𝜎 − 𝑝𝐼 + ∆𝑣 + 𝑝 − 𝑝  (14) 
Based on Equation (14), we can discover that, as shown in Figure 3: 
  
(a) (b) 
Figure 3. (a) The dynamic trend of the SME’s strategy in the case of 𝑦 > 𝑦∗; (b) The dynamic trend 
of the SME’s strategy in the case of 𝑦 < 𝑦∗. 
When 𝑦 = 𝑦∗, the LF can access the CBLP to use the information on-chain with a 
probability of 𝑦∗, and ( ) = 0 always holds. That is, the state is always stable, regard-
less of the value of 𝑥. Moreover, any change in other exogenous variables will not alter 
the stability of the state. 𝑥 is the equilibrium point, and all states are stable.  
When 𝑦 𝑦∗, the system needs to satisfy two requirements to obtain evolutionary 
stability, i.e., 𝐹(𝑥∗) = 0 and 𝐹′(𝑥∗) < 0. Then:  
• In the case of 𝑦 > 𝑦∗, 𝐹 (1) < 0. 𝑥 = 𝑥∗ = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). 
When the probability of the LF accessing the CBLP is larger than 𝑦∗, the SME will 
Figure 3. (a) The dynamic trend of the SME’s strategy in the case of y > y∗; (b) The dynamic trend of
the SME’s strategy in the case of y < y∗.
When y = y∗, the LF can access the CBLP to use the information on-chain with a
probability of y∗, and ∂F(x)
∂x = 0 always holds. That is, the state is always stable, regardless
of the value of x. Moreover, any change in other exogenous variables will not alter the
stability of the state. x is the equilibrium point, and all states are stable.
When y 6= y∗, the system needs to satisfy two requirements to obtain evolutionary
stability, i.e., F(x∗) = 0 and F′(x∗) < 0. Then:
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 219
• In the case of y > y∗, F′(1) < 0. x = x∗2 = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).
When the probability of the LF accessing the CBLP is larger than y∗, the SME will
converge with the equilibrium strategy of “comply with the LC”. The number of SMEs
who abide by the contract will gradually increase.
• In the case of y < y∗, F′(0) < 0. x = x∗1 = 0 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). It
implies that more SMEs will eventually evolve into a stable state of defaulting on the
LC, since LFs struggle to distinguish the forgery of credit records without BCT [69].
According to Equation (14), we can find that the probability of the LF choosing to
access the CBLP, requiring the SME to join the consortium, is small, and the SME tends to
breach the LC. Moreover, the “comply with or default on the LC” decision of the SME has
nothing to do with the information sharing (Zi, uj), the asset maintenance fee ( f ), or the
consortium membership fee (Cb). In contrast, the determinant of the decision is the size of
the gap between the lease reinvestment earnings (i.e., (1 + r3 − r1)R) that the SME would
gain for the default and the rewards (i.e., σ) it would receive for its compliance.
In addition, Equation (14) gives some further insights that the residual value of the
leased asset (vs) is positively correlated with the probability y that the LF chooses to access
the CBLP. This is because if the LC provisions are that the lessors (i.e., LF) ensure that
the residual value of the leased asset is immutably recorded on-chain, it mitigates the
uncertainty of residual value risk, aiding the lessor to retain ownership of the asset at the
end of the lease. Meanwhile, the default margin penalty ( p2−p1
p1
) imposed on the SME is
negatively correlated with y. When p2−p1
p1
decreases, the probability of the LF choosing to
access the CBLP increases, the main reason for which is that the relatively small penalty
(p2) set up on-chain can effectively reduce the default risk of the SME, which makes the
LF is more willing to access the CBLP. In addition, owing to the compliance behavior, the
higher credit (∆vc) achieved by the SME will stimulate the LF to stick with the conventional
leasing mode.
6.1.2. Replication Dynamic Equation of the LF
Assuming the expected return of the LF accessing and not accessing the CBLP to utilize
the information shared on-chain, the average returns are Ey, E1−y, and Ey, respectively. Then:
Ey = x[R(r2 + 1) + vs + [(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA] + g− C0 − C2 − Cb]
+(1− x)[[(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA]− Rε− C0 − C2 − Cb]
(15)
E1−y = x[R(r2 + 1) + vs − C0 − Ct − C1] + (1− x)[−Rε− C0 − Ct − C1] (16)
Ey = yEy + (1− y)E1−y (17)
The replication dynamics equation (RDE) [68] of the LF is denoted as follows:
F(y) = dy
dt
= y
(
Ey − Ey
)
= y(1− y)
(
Ey − E1−y
)
= y(1− y)[gx + ((ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA + Ct + C1 − C2 − Cb)]
(18)
Let F(y) = 0, and we obtain the stationary point of the differential equation as follows:
y∗1 = 0, y∗2 = 1, (19)
x∗ =
Cb + C2 − (ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB − uBZA − Ct − C1
g
(20)
Based on Equation (20), we can discover that, as shown in Figure 4:

(a) (b) 
Figure 4. (a) The dynamic trend of the LF’s strategy in the case of 𝑥 > 𝑥∗; (b) The dynamic trend of 
the LF’s strategy in the case of 𝑥 < 𝑥∗. 
When 𝑥 = 𝑥∗, the SME complies with the LC with a probability of 𝑥∗, and ( ) = 0 
is always established. The state is always stable no matter how the value of 𝑦 changes. In this case, 𝑦 is the equilibrium point, and all states are stable.  
When 𝑥 𝑥∗, the system needs to satisfy two requirements to obtain evolutionary 
stability, i.e., 𝐹(𝑦∗) = 0 and 𝐹′(𝑦∗) < 0. Then:  
• In the case of 𝑥 > 𝑥∗, 𝐹 (0) < 0. 𝑦 = 𝑦∗ = 0 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). 
When the probability of SME compliance is larger than 𝑥∗, the LF converges to the 
equilibrium strategy of “not accessing the CBLP ”, and thereby the SME does not 
need to join the consortium blockchain to share information.  
• In the case of 𝑥 < 𝑥∗, 𝐹 (1) < 0. 𝑦 = 𝑦∗ = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). 
When the probability of SME compliance is less than 𝑥∗, the LF will converge with 
the equilibrium strategy of “access the CBLP ” to participate in information sharing 
on-chain to complete the lease.  
According to Equation (20), we can find that considering the long-term cooperation, 
when the SME is more likely to abide by the LC, the LF will decide not to access the CBLP 
due to the limited synergy and information utilization benefits obtained.  
In addition, Equation (20) gives some further insights that the asset maintenance cost 
(𝑓) will not affect the SME’s decision to comply or default, since once an outsourced 
maintenance action begins, it will not be interrupted until the lease expires. Both the con-
sortium membership fee (𝐶 ) and asset monitoring cost on-chain (𝐶 ) are positively corre-
lated with the 𝑥. When the CBLP sets up higher costs for stakeholders to join the consor-
tium, to improve the lease willingness of the LF, the SME is more inclined to comply with 
the LC and provide genuine lease information. When the leased asset is fully inspected 
under the CBLP, the SME will not easily default by deferring the lease payment or not 
returning the leased asset after signing the LC on-chain. Notably, the LF has a higher abil-
ity to absorb more high-quality information that the SME shares on-chain, which can ex-
pedite the SME’s default behavior. It seems to be a paradox that is contrary to the LF’s 
decision-making in terms of accessing or not accessing the CBLP. This is because when 
BCT empowers more information synergy for the LF, the LF is more willing to access the 
CBLP, which compels the SME to bear the consortium membership cost, data storage, and 
verification overhead. To compensate for the potential losses that may be suffered, the 
SME will take risks, opting for default, decreasing the likelihood of compliance. The whole 
process will finally be formed as an unstable circle.  
6.2. Analysis of Equilibrium Stability and ESS 
Based on the above analysis, the game system has five local equilibrium points: (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), and (𝑥∗, 𝑦∗). 
Figure 4. (a) The dynamic trend of the LF’s strategy in the case of x > x∗; (b) The dynamic trend of
the LF’s strategy in the case of x < x∗.
When x = x∗, the SME complies with the LC with a probability of x∗, and ∂F(y)
∂y = 0 is
always established. The state is always stable no matter how the value of y changes. In this
case, y is the equilibrium point, and all states are stable.
When x 6= x∗, the system needs to satisfy two requirements to obtain evolutionary
stability, i.e., F(y∗) = 0 and F′(y∗) < 0. Then:
• In the case of x > x∗, F′(0) < 0. y = y∗1 = 0 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).
When the probability of SME compliance is larger than x∗, the LF converges to the
equilibrium strategy of “not accessing the CBLP ”, and thereby the SME does not need
to join the consortium blockchain to share information.
• In the case of x < x∗, F′(1) < 0. y = y∗2 = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).
When the probability of SME compliance is less than x∗, the LF will converge with
the equilibrium strategy of “access the CBLP ” to participate in information sharing
on-chain to complete the lease.
According to Equation (20), we can find that considering the long-term cooperation,
when the SME is more likely to abide by the LC, the LF will decide not to access the CBLP
due to the limited synergy and information utilization benefits obtained.
In addition, Equation (20) gives some further insights that the asset maintenance
cost ( f ) will not affect the SME’s decision to comply or default, since once an outsourced
maintenance action begins, it will not be interrupted until the lease expires. Both the
consortium membership fee (Cb) and asset monitoring cost on-chain (C2) are positively
correlated with the x. When the CBLP sets up higher costs for stakeholders to join the
consortium, to improve the lease willingness of the LF, the SME is more inclined to comply
with the LC and provide genuine lease information. When the leased asset is fully inspected
under the CBLP, the SME will not easily default by deferring the lease payment or not
returning the leased asset after signing the LC on-chain. Notably, the LF has a higher
ability to absorb more high-quality information that the SME shares on-chain, which can
expedite the SME’s default behavior. It seems to be a paradox that is contrary to the LF’s
decision-making in terms of accessing or not accessing the CBLP. This is because when
BCT empowers more information synergy for the LF, the LF is more willing to access the
CBLP, which compels the SME to bear the consortium membership cost, data storage, and
verification overhead. To compensate for the potential losses that may be suffered, the
SME will take risks, opting for default, decreasing the likelihood of compliance. The whole
process will finally be formed as an unstable circle.
6.2. Analysis of Equilibrium Stability and ESS
Based on the above analysis, the game system has five local equilibrium points:
(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), and (x∗, y∗).
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 221
To find the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS), the local stability analysis of the
Jacobian matrix is employed [70,71], and thereby we take the first-order derivatives of
Equations (12) and (18), respectively, achieving the following Jacobian matrix J.

The local stability analysis of the five equilibria was performed to investigate the re-
lationship between positive and negative trJ and detJ and evolutionary stability at the five
equilibrium points. When a local equilibrium point satisfies the conditions that trace trJ < 0
and the determinant detJ > 0 of the Jacobian matrix J, it is an evolutionary stable strategy
(ESS) [72]. If the trJ > 0 and detJ > 0, the equilibrium point is unstable or a saddle point.
Nonetheless, it is obvious that the stationary point (x∗, y∗) should meet
0 ≤ x∗ ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y∗ ≤ 1, which is meaningful. Considering g > 0 and

(ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB + uBZA + Ct + C1 + g− C2 − Cb > 0
(28)
Similarly, according to Assumption 3, we know that p2 > p1, which indicates the de-
nominator of y∗, I + ∆vc + p2 − p1 > 0, then: 0 ≤ (1+r3−r1)R+vs−σ−p1

I + ∆vc + p2 − p1 > 0
I + ∆vc + p2 + σ− vs − (1 + r3 − r1)R > 0
(29)
Based on Condition 1 and Condition 2, we can use the signs of trJ and detJ to judge
the stability of the equilibrium point of the evolutionary game. The results are shown in
Table 4.

According to Table 4, we can find that E2(0, 1) and E3(1, 0) are unstable points.
E5(x∗, y∗) is a saddle point revealing that evolutionary stability is affected by the values
of x∗ and y∗. The game system has two ESS equilibrium points: E1(0, 0) and E4(1, 1). This
indicates that the game’s ultimate evolutionary strategies are “Strategy I: S1 = {Comply,
Access}” and “Strategy IV: S4 = {Default, Not-access}”, meaning that both SMEs and LFs
converge at the locations E1 and E4 in Figure 5.

That is, when both parties’ decisions are in the region E1E2E5E3, the game evolves to
point E1(0, 0), i.e., the SME breaches the LC, and the LF does not access the CBLP, requiring
the SME to access the consortium blockchain. When both parties’ decisions are located
in region E2E4E3E5, the game evolves into the ideal stable state E4(1, 1), i.e., the SME
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 223
abides by the LC and the LF requires the SME to access the consortium blockchain. The
probability of the evolutionary outcome between the game subjects can be represented in
terms of the area of the regions E1E2E5E3 and E2E4E3E5 [73], the size of which depends on
the coordinates of the point E5 (the saddle point (x∗, y∗)), where: SE1E2E5E3 = 1
2 (x∗ + y∗),
SE2E4E3E5 = 1
2 [(1− x∗) + (1− y∗)]. The possibility that the SME will conform to the contract
and be required to access the CBLP increases as the region E2E4E3E5 expands.
6.3. Sensitivity Analysis in the Evolutionary Game
The choices made by the game subjects are influenced by the exogenous variables in
the model. By taking derivatives of SE2E4E3E5 (abbreviated hereafter as ‘S’) while holding
the other parameters constant, it is possible to determine how each parameter affects the
game’s evolutionary results (i.e., SE2E4E3E5 ).

I+∆vc+p2−p1
)] (32)
The evolutionary game results are primarily related to the four main determinants:
information sharing, credit, incentive–penalty, and risk. The sensitivity analysis of the
influence of the four factors on SE2E4E3E5 is described below.
6.3.1. Impact of Information Sharing on S
Taking the derivatives of Equation (32) corresponding to ZA, ZB, and uB,
∂S

=
uB

> 0 (33)
∂S
∂ZB
=
ϕ−ω− λ− η
2g
> 0 (34)
∂S
∂uB
=
ZA
2g
> 0 (35)
S is an increasing function ofZA andZB, since Equation (34) is true under Assumption
7 (A7). That is, as the amount of information shared on-chain (Zi) increases, S will gradually
increase, indicating the possibility of evolution to the stable state E4(1, 1) as the quantity of
information shared on-chain increases. It further means that this parameter has a favorable
impact on the probability of SMEs’ decisions to comply with the contract and being required
to join the consortium. The more accurate the information that is shared on the blockchain
network, the easier it will be to create a transparent and reliable environment for leasing,
and the more SMEs will actively disclose high-quality information to ensure that leasing
transactions are executed smoothly.
S is an increasing function of uB. The more the LF can use the effective data on-chain,
the more the LF is likely to access the CBLP to clearly monitor the SME’s compliance with
the LC, thus increasing the likelihood of rental payment on time.
6.3.2. Impact of Credit on S
Taking the derivatives of Equation (32) corresponding to ∆vc,
∂S
∂∆vc
=
(1 + r3 − r1)R + vs − σ− p1
2(I + ∆vc + p2 − p1)
2 > 0 (36)
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 224
S is an increasing function of ∆vc. Therefore, as ∆vc increases, the SME has a higher
probability of conforming to the LC. Then, a higher credit value is assigned to the SME,
resulting in the SME’s nodes having a higher probability of being selected as a leader node
when performing the Raft consensus protocol. Conversely, a node will be removed from the
Consenter Set if its total credit value falls below the minimum threshold because of multiple
defaults, escalating the penalty and helping to establish a high-credit leasing environment.
6.3.3. Impact of Incentive–Penalty on S
Taking the derivative of Equation (32) corresponding to σ, I, g and p2,
∂S
∂σ
=
1
2(I + ∆vc + p2 − p1)
> 0 (37)
∂S

Cb + C2 − (ϕ−ω− λ− η)ZB − uBZA − Ct − C1
2g2 > 0 (39)
∂S
∂p2
=
(1 + r3 − r1)R + vs − σ− p1
2(I + ∆vc + p2 − p1)
2 > 0 (40)
S is an increasing function of σ, I, g, and p2. The likelihood that previously defaulting
SMEs will start to keep their contracts and that the SME is motivated to access the blockchain
increases with the incentives the LF provides to them. To encourage a node to choose the
on-chain strategy and to encourage more SMEs to become consortium nodes, the LF can
appropriately boost the compliance reward of the SMEs when creating the incentive strategy.
No matter whether the SME defers the rental payment or refuses to return the leased asset,
both default behaviors will lead to the lessee being charged a penalty, which irrevocably
damages the SME’s reputation on-chain. Hence, once the SME joins the consortium, the
likelihood of compliance rises as the default penalties rise. The LF will also keep using the
on-chain strategy to observe how the SMEs choose their payment strategies. Therefore, the
penalties for SMEs should be suitably enhanced to guarantee a prompt rental payment.
6.3.4. Impact of Risk on S
Taking the derivatives of Equation (32) corresponding to ϕ, ω, λ, and η,
∂S
∂ϕ
=
ZB

∂S
∂λ
=
−ZB
2g
< 0 (43)
∂S
∂η
=
−ZB
2g
< 0 (44)
S is an increasing function of ϕ. When more high-quality data are effectively dis-
tributed and shared by each subject on-chain, more subjects will join the consortium to
complete the leasing transactions as more return is generated.
In addition, S is a decreasing function of ω, λ, and η. If the participants bear more
consensus verification and storage costs, and take on greater security risks, they will be
more reluctant to join the consortium and the probability of default will increase.
To sum up, different types of factors will have different effects on decision-making.

7. Numerical Experiments and Implications
This section will present some simulation results. We first use VENSIM PLE to build a
system dynamics (SD) model to analyze the causal relationships among the variables and
strategies. Then, MATLAB_R2021b is employed to examine the efficacy of the evolutionary
stable strategies (ESSs) and to demonstrate the previous mathematical sensitivity analysis
of each factor. Lastly, some implications of the results are given.
The game system has intermediate variables (including Ex, E1−x, Ey, E1−y) and
a range of exogenous variables (as presented in Table 1). We set initial values for the
exogenous variables involved in the model, as shown in Table 5. In this study, it is assumed
that all exogenous variables are positive, and the return of each strategy of each game
subject is guaranteed to be positive.

7.1. System Dynamics Model Experiment
We establish the SD model of the two-party evolutionary game system as depicted in
Figure 6. The arrow tails in Table 5 are connected to the independent variables in the associated
equation, and the arrowheads are connected to the dependent variables. We set the simulation
parameters of INITIAL TIME = 0, FINAL TIME = 10, and TIME STEP = 0.0078125.
It can be seen from Figure 7a,b that when the initial states of both sides are pure
strategies (i.e., (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1)), no party in the system is willing to change
the current state to break the equilibrium. For instance, the initial state of (x = 0, y = 0) or
(x = 1, y = 1) will be unchanged if there is no interruption during the evolution. However,
this does not mean that these equilibrium states are stable, and once one or both parties
take the initiative to make a small change, the equilibrium state will be broken. Although
the SME’s compliance probability x and the LF’s CBLP access probability y (for 0.0001)
evolve with small mutations, they quickly shift to a new strategy once they find that doing
this will yield a higher expected return, thus adjusting the strategy through a mutation of
parties to bring the system into a new equilibrium. In addition, through simulating the
model, we also discover that the ultimate equilibrium state is (1, 1) when the initial state is
x = 0.5, y = 0.5, as shown in Figure 7c.
In fact, when x = 0, no matter how y ranges from 0 to 1, the system will reach an
equilibrium state (0, 0). When x = 1, no matter how y ranges from 0 to 1, the system will
reach an equilibrium state (1, 1). Similarly, when y = 0, no matter how x ranges from 0
to 1, the system will reach an equilibrium state (0, 0), and when y = 1, no matter how x
ranges from 0 to 1, the system will reach an equilibrium state (1, 1).
7.2. Effect of Parameter Changes on Evolutionary Stable Strategies
We initiate the probabilities of x and y with values ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1.
It can be seen from Figure 8 that almost all curves converge at (0, 0) and (1, 1), which is
consistent with the preceding discussion in Section 6.2.
The following subsection further discusses the impacts of the four factors on evolution.
Here, we assume the initial strategy probability for each participant is 0.5.

It can be seen from Figure 7a,b that when the initial states of both sides are pure

the current state to break the equilibrium. For instance, the initial state of (𝑥 = 0, 𝑦 = 0)

7.2.1. Evolution Impacted by Information Sharing 
The initial quantity of information sharing (𝓏𝑖) for each participant was set to 1, 3, 5, 
7, and 9. As shown in Figure 9a. there are two critical values. When 𝓏𝑖 is greater than 5 
and less than 3, the probability is that all parties will converge at 1 and 0, respectively. The 
system evolves to the states (1, 1) and (0, 0), accordingly. When the computing power 𝑢𝑗 
of each organization is less than 0.3, 𝑥 and 𝑦 both converge at 0, and the system evolves 
to the state (0, 0) (see Figure 9b). When 𝑢𝑗 is greater than 0.5, it results in an evolutionary 
state (1, 1), indicating that the parties with higher computation are more willing to be 
incentivized to join the consortium blockchain to share information.

7.2.2. Evolution Impacted by Credit 
In order to further study how different levels of credit affect the decision-making of 
SMEs and LFs, we simulate the factor “credit value” in the range from 1 to 10, with a step 
size of 2, while keeping the other parameters at their initial values. Figure 10 indicates that 
all curves gradually converged to 𝑥 = 1, 𝑦 = 1, indicating that higher credit helps to mo-
tivate the SME to fulfill the contract and join the blockchain to share their information. 
However, it also can be found that the SME’s strategy of choosing to keep the contract is 
more influenced and motivated by “credit” than the strategy of joining the blockchain.

publish a valid block during the financing transaction confirmation process. When we 
dynamically adjust the incentive value 𝐼 from 1.2 to 9.6, we are surprised to find that the 
system always evolves to the equilibrium point (1,1) in Figure 11a. This means that no

7.2.2. Evolution Impacted by Credit
In order to further study how different levels of credit affect the decision-making of
SMEs and LFs, we simulate the factor “credit value” in the range from 1 to 10, with a step
size of 2, while keeping the other parameters at their initial values. Figure 10 indicates
that all curves gradually converged to x = 1, y = 1, indicating that higher credit helps to
motivate the SME to fulfill the contract and join the blockchain to share their information.
However, it also can be found that the SME’s strategy of choosing to keep the contract is
more influenced and motivated by “credit” than the strategy of joining the blockchain.

7.2.3. Evolution Impacted by Incentive-Penalty
We award an incentive I (e.g., a kind of “gas” fee with blockchain) to the SMEs who
publish a valid block during the financing transaction confirmation process. When we
dynamically adjust the incentive value I from 1.2 to 9.6, we are surprised to find that the
system always evolves to the equilibrium point (1, 1) in Figure 11a. This means that no
matter how many block rewards are paid to the SME for being a block verifier/miner, the
SME resolutely adheres to conforming to the contract and enters the blockchain, whereas
with a higher I, the SME is more proactive in participating in information sharing on-chain.

that affects the SME’s strategy selection of SMEs joining the blockchain, which is outside 
of the initial expectations — for example, a high penalty erodes the incentive to participate 
in information sharing.

We set the risk cost of the consensus on-chain (ω) and storage off-chain (µ) to 0.2,

analyzed. As shown in Figure 12, the critical value of the initial risk cost is between 0.2 and
0.4. When the risk is less than 0.2, the SME’s and LF’s probabilities x and y both converged
at 1. Vice versa, when the risk level is greater than 0.4, the system evolves to point (1, 1).
Similar results can be inferred from the influencing security risk (η).

lyzed. As shown in Figure 12, the critical value of the initial risk cost is between 0.2 and

verged at 1. Vice versa, when the risk level is greater than 0.4, the system evolves to point (1, 1). Similar results can be inferred from the influencing security risk (𝜂).

7.3. Implications of the Results 
Based on the above replicator dynamic analysis and simulation results, this study 
provides some implications: 
(1) The results reveal that the residual value of the leased asset is a decisive factor sup-
porting the lessor’s access strategy. Before signing the LC, it is necessary to estimate 
the asset residual value; if the value is relatively large at the termination of the lease, 
LFs (lessors) have a high probability of actively adopting BCT to efficiently prove 
their ownership of the leased asset on-chain. Thus, from the perspective of reducing 
risks of leased asset default, a blockchain-based leasing service provided by the lessor 
is more beneficial for an operating lease than a capital lease. 
(2) Most leasing businesses tend to treat maintenance as a non-core activity and com-
monly outsource it to a third-party MC [10], as assumed in this study (Section 4). The 
results indicate that when the maintenance fee is not embedded in the rental pay-
ment, the maintenance charge is not a determinant impacting the lessee’s decisions 
regarding compliance with/defaulting on the LC. Hence, before the lessor decides 
whether to adopt BCT, it is necessary to take into consideration the in-house or out-
sourced maintenance problem. 
(3) To encourage lessees and lessors to evolve to the ideal equilibrium state, an incentive 
mechanism should be designed to motivate all parties to cooperatively construct a 
sustainable and more trustworthy leasing environment. More high-quality infor-
mation should be shared on-chain, and stakeholders should also improve the capa-
bility to effectively utilize the data on- and off-chain [74]. In contrast to the fixed re-
wards resulting from block mining, the incentive associated with incremental or de-
ductible credit value for consensus action tends to inspire lessees’ willingness to com-
ply with the contract under the BCT-based leasing business. An appropriate default 
penalty should be set up on-chain that can deter the lessee from defaulting and en-
courage it to make rental payments on time and return the leased asset as agreed in 
the LC. When making strategic decisions to join the consortium to share information,

ing compliance with/defaulting on the LC. Hence, before the lessor decides whether

(3) To encourage lessees and lessors to evolve to the ideal equilibrium state, an incentive

sustainable and more trustworthy leasing environment. More high-quality informa-
tion should be shared on-chain, and stakeholders should also improve the capability
to effectively utilize the data on- and off-chain [74]. In contrast to the fixed rewards
resulting from block mining, the incentive associated with incremental or deductible
credit value for consensus action tends to inspire lessees’ willingness to comply with
the contract under the BCT-based leasing business. An appropriate default penalty
should be set up on-chain that can deter the lessee from defaulting and encourage it to
make rental payments on time and return the leased asset as agreed in the LC. When
making strategic decisions to join the consortium to share information, participants
(particularly lessees) are more sensitive to the technology risk factor to which they
are subject. To reduce the cost of building and maintaining the blockchain system to
support the leasing business (e.g., on-chain and off-chain storage costs, verification
costs, etc.), it is advised and helpful to embed blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) in our
CBLP in the future [75], which will also enhance SMEs’ willingness to share more
valuable information on-chain, achieving a win–win outcome in the leasing business.
8. Conclusions and Future Works
8.1. Conclusions
BCT provides a new idea for leasing to address the challenges of the information
asymmetry and traceability of leased assets to some degree. Hence, there exists great
significance in designing an incentive mechanism to encourage lessees and lessors to
join the consortium blockchain and actively share information on-chain. This study first
proposes a conceptual architecture of the consortium blockchain-based leasing platform
(CBLP), then constructs a dynamical evolutionary game model between the SME (the
“lessee”) and LF (the “lessor”). Our primary findings are as follows:
(1) With long-term cooperation, the two parties (lessee and lessor) eventually evolve to
adopt strategies in which the lessee is more inclined to conform to the LC and the
lessor becomes more proactive in accessing the CBLP as a consortium node to share
information on-chain.
(2) According to previous basic lease scenarios that we assumed, two default actions are
explored: (i) overdue rental payment; (ii) asset disposal against the LC. For the former
default action, we found that the larger proceeds gained resulting from reinvesting the
rental payment will cause the lessee to default, and at this time, the lessor will tend to
adopt BCT to mitigate the overdue-payment default risk. In addition, the residual value
of the leased asset has a positive impact on the exposure at default, and the lessee will be
more likely to default by not returning the leased asset to the lessor due to the temptation
of the high profit achieved from asset disposal at the end of the lease. Meanwhile, the
lessee’s default on asset disposals will result in the lessor being more inclined to adopt
BCT to ensure a timely claim of repossession of the leased asset.
(3) Although blockchain can guarantee data reliability (e.g., maintenance events) [76],
maintenance cost is not a determinant of the equilibrium state once the maintenance
service is outsourced. On the contrary, in-house maintenance provided by the lessor
may affect the two parties’ strategic decisions.
(4) When the lessee and lessor have incentives to participate in sharing or utilizing
more information on-chain, the lessee will eventually evolve to conform to the LC,
which will benefit the lessor and leasing industry. Setting up a changeable credit
associated with the lessee’s LC performance to compete for a block accounting right
via a consensus mechanism [77] is an effective way to incentivize the lessee to comply
with the LC, while this method does not work much to incentive the lessor to adopt
BCT. In addition, only when the default penalty on-chain exceeds a critical value can
it work to incentivize lessees to correctly fulfill their obligations in the LC [78], once
the penalty is lower than a critical value, which will in return increase the default risk.
The technology risks and relevant costs concerning CBLP deployment play a vital role
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2023, 18 233
in encouraging the consortium to participate in information sharing on-chain, which
is consistent with what we expected in reality.
In summary, this study enables lessees and lessors to build a trustworthy cooperative
relationship on the consortium blockchain-based leasing platform, while also assisting
lessors or regulators in taking effective measures to incentivize lessees to comply with the
lease contract and share more information on-chain to enhance the management of default
risks in the leasing industry.
8.2. Limitations and Future Directions
Considering that the practical application of BCT in the leasing industry is rare, it
is difficult to obtain real data. Thus, this study focuses on mathematical modeling and
numerical simulation. The conclusions of this study can be further demonstrated and
enriched via empirical analysis of specific cases. Meanwhile, there are still some avenues
to be explored in the future. For example, it is meaningful to explore “tripartite–win”
strategies among lessees, lessors, and OEMs (or third-party MCs). Additionally, blockchain
smart contracts play an essential role in financing transactions [79]. Further research can
offer new insights into the cost reduction and value transfer of using smart contracts [80] to
motivate the related parties to share information.
