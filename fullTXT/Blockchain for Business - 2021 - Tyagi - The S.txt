Abstract
As the up gradation in modern technologies has not only resulted in an eruption 
of huge data sets being captured and recorded in various fields, but also turn up 
to the security of records to avoid forge during depository, transportation, pro-
cessing, updating and accessing. Transactions can be a commutation of an asset, 
the execution of the terms of a self-executing script-smart contract, or an upda-
tion into anecdote. Vital exposure of blockchain ecosystem and its comprehensive 
danger are entrenched in its ecosystem – the hub of miners, developers, suppliers, 
consumers, shareholders or stakeholders, and actors. Latterly blockchain tech-
nology is not limited to crypto currency but operating on financial and business 
applications. Decentralization, non changeable and clarity are the base on which 
blockchain technology working. This ecosystem is propagating with involvement 
from both sectors actors-public & private. This chapter deals with delineation 
of the foundation of the blockchain ecosystem in businesses, starting with the 
definition then blockchain act as a game changer and drilling down to a level of 
detail about effect of energy production from business ecosystem on the planet. 
In order to explicate the components of the blockchain ecosystem, this chapter 
provides examples of companies currently operating in different areas. However, 
blockchain companies (Bloq, Factom, Symbiont, Blockstream, PayStand, tZERO, 
Skuchain.) may function in more than one zone as they do not easily accommo-
date into one area of ecosystem, develop in capabilities and transition between 
areas over period of time.

30 Blockchain for Business
2.1 Introduction
BLOCK CHAIN
Blockchain is a type of database that is shared across a network of com-
puters, by allowing the transparency of transaction. Records containing 
information are added to the database, bundled together into what called 
as blocks. These blocks are then linked together to form a chain—hence 
blockchain. When we talk about blockchain ecosystems (a group of organ-
isms interacting with one another within their surroundings), there are the 
groups of actors (users, miners, developers & researchers, etc.) interacting 
with each other within the world of blockchain and with the encompassing 
off-chain world. The core interactions between these actors take place in 
the form of transactions, but these transactions are almost entirely limited 
to the blockchain itself. In lay man language to understand blockchain-at 
present some of the countries already adopted an online ballot voting sys-
tem which includes a voting registration database, electronic devices and 
software. For voting, firstly individual has to register himself which includes  
his identity number, name, phone number and personal information then 
it is stored in the software. From the cyber security perspective it is easy to 
disrupt the software by just attacking on the voter’s registration database. 
Each part in the election process whether it is hardware or software is at 
major risk of hacking. When the software system is manipulated it can lead 
to the inappropriate election result. Not limited to that, after hacking the 
database of voters they can easily access their social media accounts. So, 
the sufferers at the end are the common people. To solve this issue the new 
technology blockchain can be used to provide security during voting time.

The Scope for Blockchain Ecosystem  31
With its transparency, immutability and accountability properties this can 
be attained up to some exact level. It ensures that digital data must come 
from the trusted source by using cryptography.
Blockchain’s property once data is entered can never be destroyed 
enables it to store individual’s identity records such as biometrics, iris scan-
ning and many more for authentication voters and to record their records 
in the tabulation format. Blockchain technology is like having public 
key—visible to anyone, can help each individual voters and election con-
ducting officials in counting number of votes without any malfunctioning 
in the system and which tends to a fair election outcome. Basically, this 
new technology has completely eradicated the third party i.e. electronic 
devices (Hardware), hence does not involve disturbance in the entire sys-
tem. Moreover it enhances the security level of the entire system by pro-
viding copy of data to other nodes existing in the network. If hacker tries 
to modify the record of one node then it has to manipulate the data on the 
other nodes too on which same information exists which is quite compli-
cated. Thus blockchain acts as a shield for preventing the system against 
cyber-attacks. Fraudulency can be minimized as the data has been copied 
to more than one place.
Like in Crypto currency, its ecosystem is based on Blockchain and has 
four parts or elements: the users who use crypto currencies to receive and 
send currency, crypto currency miners who produce the crypto currency, 
investors who buy crypto currency and the developers who write programs 
related to this system and network and develop it. No part of this system 
can continue working each without the other.
An ecosystem comprises entities that collaborate along perpetuity of 
consumer’s needs to deliver greater value and bolster the addressable retail 
market. An ecosystem is defined by constructing a ring around organiza-
tions, individuals, and things that share or complement a set of interests. 
This circle will be defined by the mindsets of the stakeholders and whether 
they would want to create efficiencies, curate new markets, and improve 
collaboration. 
The collaborator-stakeholders defined ecosystem as a scope from cre-
ating economically broad and sustainable markets aligning with emerg-
ing customer preferences and leveraging open source development for 
complex problems. These interests can include intercommunications 
within and cross wide organizations, different sectors of the economy, and 
industries. A blockchain ecosystem is said to be developed if it allows the 
interconnectedness not only with producers or sellers but also with the 
consumers. Its aforementioned correlativity permits to build systems that 
can selectively take profit of the blockchain—in its trustworthiness, clarity,

and decentralization. The Blockchain ecosystem is helpful to maintain the 
environmental sustainability as it is having potential to verify the trans-
parency of the transaction records—data which has to be transferred and 
the person having the data at present can both be verified by blockchain 
technology. This can be implemented by the decentralization and digitali-
zation of the conclusion. Blockchain ecosystem also promises to improve 
the existing governance environmental models which are progressing at 
steady rate and intermediaries associated with the models taking sweat 
equities charging high by empowering broader people of stakeholders. 
Moreover, Blockchain are public—records are visible to everyone but 
none have permission to delete those records or destroy them. Basically 
Blockchain are of three types: public-like decentralized organization,  
private-degree of openness is limited to specific users like in Audit compa-
nies, Consortium—refers to an agreement between the organization and 
actors. In nature, ecosystems tend to arise naturally. To ensure the ecosys-
tems fulfill their purpose, they’re often controlled by the creation of appli-
cations, integration with external systems, added on by the creator also. 
There are Self-fulfilling agreements, the smart contracts which can manage 
the system automatically, by the members of the ecosystem just in case. 
2.2 Blockchain as Game Changer for Environment
Transformation in the existing environment ecosystem can be imported 
by the blockchain technology by adapting decentralized, efficient energy 
resources and water systems. Data like—how much water used at house-
hold level, how much energy required per area, etc. Eradication of the 
species from earth seems like becoming the trend, as the lessening of bio-
diversity at its peak. The ocean is becoming more acidic day by day as its 
plants are consuming greenhouse gases. As predicted by scientists by 2050 
we will be having fall of 30–35% water as the water’s demand is increasing 
by 1% every year. Along with that, the Earth’s atmosphere circular system 
and climatic changes, deforestation rates, are also calculated that approx 
7.5–8.5 million tons of plastic are present in the sea water which is effecting 
the food chain.
All these records can be maintained on the blockchain environment 
system with the help of smart sensors. The data which can’t be collected 
manually if collated contains partial information base on which decision 
makers of centralized organization and retailers make their conclusions. 
This inadequacy has been improved by blockchain technology by pro-
viding more informed decision making and transforming the centralized

into the decentralized one. With the help of blockchain ecosystem we can 
easily trace and verify the renewable energy resources, P2P transaction, 
make value as dynamic plus to that balance of the demand side economy. 
This technology can be used as a base to make people aware of the natural 
calamities—it prepared the communities in advance for upcoming disas-
ters. Through smart contracts it ensures the transmission of important 
information among the large range of users at the time of natural mishap. 
The role of the blockchain resembles that of a wild card for the already 
existing ecosystems which does not disturb and is effective for climate 
change and other environmental challenges, known to be as game chang-
ers can be stated as follows:
1)Supply Chain Management: see through chains-
2)Incentivizing circular economies via Recycling:
3)Energy:
4). Environmental  Agreement:
5). Pro�tless contribution :
6) Carbon Tax
7). Earth management platforms
1. Supply Chain Management: See Through Chains
 Whenever the customer buys the product a trust factor is 
associated with that brand like Johnson’s, Maggi, or Lakme. 
The information that consumer keenly is looking for is that 
the manufacturing of that product should be fair which is 
not available and sometimes it becomes difficult for them 
to verify whether the product is genuine or fake. For the 
product to reach the store it has to travel through many 
intermediaries—producers, suppliers, retailers, in-between 
reconstruction or remodeling can be done with the prod-
uct’s brand—chemicals can be added, basic materials can be 
changed or replica of the product can also be made with low 
quality constituents. At the end it is the customer who will 
be suffering. Here comes the savior for consumers i.e. block-
chain. Blockchain enables tracking of the path of product 
beginning with manufacturing, traveling till its destination

like a GPS of product’s route. Customer can get all the 
answers of the four questions:
 a. Where the products are produced?
 b. How efficiently is it produced?
 c. Where they dispose their waste?
 d. How much biasness is involved?
 Blockchain has the potential to make the supply chain trans-
parent which can help the buyers buy more environment- 
friendly products. To track the path of food also seems to be 
benefitted in cutting down the carbon emission as the con-
sumer will avoid traveling long distances. It brings all the 
stakeholders-investors, developers, workers, producers, sup-
pliers, retailers, the consumer under one roof by intercon-
necting all of them which makes this platform a unique one. 
Blockchain technology also assures that the sea food must 
be coming from the sustainable fisherman. For food tracking 
Dapp has developed Foodtrax; Provenance is one of block-
chain’s project helping actors to see through supply chains.
2. Incentivizing Circular Economies via Recycling
 Various efforts have been made to carry out the recycling 
programs in separate cities which often led to failure and 
sometimes not being able to track & compare the impact of 
the recycling plans .These reusing program give rewards for 
submitting plastic containers or bottles in the form of a token. 
With the help of blockchain technology we can easily track 
the location where this recycling program is implementing. 
It is also helpful in increasing incentives as for depositing 
each plastic article participants are getting in return crypto 
currency which overall is good for the circular economy. 
Blockchain keeps the record of the volume of the material 
that has been deposited which is value and profit for evalua-
tion. In coming years we will be using plastic money as plastic 
bank is a project which aims to convert plastic into currency 
in exchange of plastic materials by setting up collection cen-
ters at different locations. Dapp Recycle to coin also enables 
communities to receive tokens in return of plastic bottles. 
3. Energy
 It’s a common problem faced by all the commoners’ or 
businesses covering the world and not an issue for some

particular human beings. During the breakdown of natural 
calamities, poverty or extreme climate changes, interrup-
tion of electricity is a very common problem encountered 
by every citizen not accessing to power which ultimately 
leads to blackouts. Blockchain environmental ecosystem 
prepares for this kind of situation if it ever takes place. To 
decrease the requirement to transmit the electricity to far 
places it has P2P blockchain which is based on blockchain 
energy system. This can help in transmission of the elec-
tricity from local areas where it’s originally generated to the 
areas where it is required. This also supports in reducing the 
energy storage. A platform which can solve this problem 
working on the blockchain is a Trans active Grid which is a 
combined legal agreement between two blockchain compa-
nies, ConsenSys and LO3 Energy. If someone wants to get 
return or want to gain profit there is a way provided by the 
blockchain environment ecosystem. You can simply invest 
in the renewable energy installation through blockchain 
platform and get returns as a token seeking how to invest 
where to invest which can be done by dapp-EcoChain. For 
solar energy–renewable energy, sun contract is a blockchain 
which bases on P2P trading platform. Solar coin app aims to 
maximize solar installations is based on an electric chain i.e. 
a blockchain platform.
4. Environmental Agreement
 If we talk about the promises made by the leaders sometimes 
left incomplete as we are able to judge by itself or the agree-
ment between two companies had been cancelled due to not 
completing the task assign to it .But what about the environ-
mental agreement is that visible to all of us or are we going 
to observe itself only? Are we going to measure the impact 
of these agreements how much completed—how much left 
out? It is not possible for an individual to do all these things. 
For tracing the real impacts of environmental treaties there’s 
a blockchain platform. In the long run the government and 
authorities are also not interested in keeping their prom-
ises. If data is presented it presents two main concerns: one 
is scamming, other is molding. To eradicate this problem, a 
centralized system-blockchain makes the whole system crys-
tal clear by allowing the tracking of environmental data and 
peeking at every instance of all the commitments that were

fulfilled or not. Not only does it do transparent tracking its 
job but also in reporting the progress made at what loca-
tion and by what quantity Blockchain could dampen asso-
ciations, business companies and governments from taking 
u-turns from promises related to environment. Blockchain 
has the potential to remove the fraud and manipulation by 
storing legalized records. Approximately 980 million per 
annum has been spent to administrate the blockchain sys-
tem which is under scheme of global carbon credits.
5. Profitless Contribution
 In India if we say the south region, it’s common to have 
typhoon or flood. In 2007, there were terrible series of floods 
that occurred called as south Asian floods in which 30 mil-
lion people suffered so that all citizens gathered to provide 
monetary help of which they donated very huge amounts. 
But have you ever thought that the amount we do donate 
for charity whether online or offline is reaching the proper 
recipients. Many people have donated money for Covid-19 
(a viral disease)—though they have been provided IFSC 
codes. But one question that remains in our mind is will the 
amount really reach the affected people. If not, then how will 
it be spent. Looking at today’s scenario, corruption has been 
inserted deeply into the roots or as they say to the tip of the 
roots where osmosis begins. Blockchain technology assures 
that the money which is intended for this purpose will help 
the affected people or for specific programs and will not be 
filling unintended pockets. The money can undoubtedly tar-
get its correct audience if it is based on blockchain platform 
(crypto currencies). Some rural areas are still lacking bank-
ing infrastructure and when there will be a natural hazard, 
in going to the bank or ATM for withdrawing, Blockchain 
technology has the potential to transfer the amount directly 
without making interruptions from the centralized system 
or any middleman. Two charities working with crypto cur-
rencies are Bit give and Bit hope.
6. Carbon Tax
 The factors which have adverse impacts on the environment 
initiates from the automobiles, household items and so forth. 
Nowadays, sources include those that have to do with a lav-
ish lifestyle whiuch directly or indirectly affects the environ-
ment, but by how much? Can you determine how much every

product is making an effect on the environment? It can be cal-
culated if we are aware of the carbon imprints. When planning 
to buy a four-wheeler petrol, diesel or CNG vehicle, which 
one would you prefer apart from monetization point of view? 
Obviously, that one which has less carbon emission so that 
global warming will not go beyond its alarming rate. Carbon 
tax is the tax which is applied at the time of extraction of fuel 
which is an indirect strategy to control emission of green-
house gases produced when burning hydrocarbon (carbon 
compounds). The private sector imposed tax on the carbon 
with aim of lessening the emission of Co2 in the environment 
which results to degradation of forests. When these taxes are 
collected they should be used in the afforestation program but 
due to the many political winds the funds collected are used 
somewhere else. Blockchain technology has driven towards 
afforestation and degradation. It directly transfers the funds to 
the environmental ecosystem not in the pockets of intermedi-
aries. In this context, the blockchain keeps the transparency 
between all the participants so that the funds obtain by depos-
iting carbon will be applied in forest conservation program 
only. Considering the effect of CO2, manufacturers and pro-
ducers also join hands by giving incentives to those companies 
who are selling products with low carbon footprints and a lit-
tle piece of cake to the consumers also who are following this 
trend. Blockchain acts as a game changer as it is provides the 
tracking of carbon imprints of every product. However some 
companies are producing products which have high carbon 
footprints so that Blockchain technology will compel them to 
change their supply chain as well as customers to buy products 
that have less adverse effect on the environment. The score 
based on the carbon footprints of the products sold by each 
company is determined by the blockchain-based system. Thus 
by adapting blockchain, there will be more transparency and 
termination of practices which are harmful to environment. 
The main Interest of this technology is to construct a global 
market of carbon trading for communities and businesses.
7. Earth Management Platforms
 Telecom companies (such as Voda, Airtel or Jio) have to face 
new problems each day in order to increase the customer 
satisfaction and revenue. The perspective of the organization 
is the expansion of the network which involves the choice

of location which requires a geo platform—a platform 
which conveys information about the location. Similarly 
Earth’s natural system also needs attention which are under 
unknown stress due to the boundation of the planet. The 
New Blockchain Geospatial platform interprets geographic 
data and helps to understand the new patterns not only on 
the surface of the earth but deeper in the sea as well, i.e., it 
traces the data of the ocean. This platform analyzes, visualizes 
and manages the data of the earth in a ledger of geospatial 
platform. After the scaling the data blockchain technology 
ensures transaction across the globe and environmental 
domains are verifiable and trustful. This technology helps in 
protecting life not only on land but also the live of sea ani-
mals by improve their health. By removing the unbiasness 
and providing proper visualization to the water resources, 
blockchain enables to secure fishing rights whereas on land 
it strengthens the property rights of the participants and all 
the actors. The Geospatial Blockchain environmental eco-
system has the potential to observe the weather conditions 
and monitor the performance of the forecast required with 
the help of Internet of Things.
  The above-mentioned game changers provide the power 
to structure the sustainable future with the collaboration of 
upgrading technologies. The blockchain environment eco-
system should target the right problem in order to empower 
the communities.
2.3 Blockchain in Business Ecosystem
By 2025, global investment in blockchain technology in energy markets 
is set to reach $34.7 billion. Although $35 billion seems high, it’s exceed-
ing by the net worth of $1.85 trillion for the energy market as a whole. 
Key actors using blockchain and DLT in the field include Accenture, AWS, 
Bigchain db, Deloitte, IBM, Infosys, Microsoft, Nodal block, Oracle, SAP, 
Enosi, and Electron. 
Blockchain is used within energy markets for data management, finan-
cial tracking and interactions. Drivers for adoption include reducing 
operational costs and capital expenditure. Increasing automation will see 
blockchain employed for data security and integrity. On top of the list 
are banking and financial applications whereas the Medicare businesses,

regulators and retailers are progressively speeding up in this blockchain 
market. Interest in this technology is increasing rapidly which drives its 
route towards the business ecosystem. New entrepreneurs have started to 
look for the business solution within the blockchain business ecosystem.
2.3.1 Business Ecosystem
A business ecosystem comprises of a huge number of participants, which 
can either be business organization or actors. They are linked in such a 
manner that they can affect each other. Interrelation enables assorted inter-
action among the members. Interaction can be competitive or coopera-
tive. Together with interconnectedness they proportioned consequences 
between the organizations. The members are reliant on each other—the 
downfall of one organization result in failure of other firms. 
2.3.1.1 What Is Business Model?
A model which provides an overview of how the organization is going to 
make maximum profit in which field, whether in selling services or pro-
ducing products or selling businesses without any intermediate to the right 
choice of consumers. It can be online or offline mode. This model includes 
a plan of all the expenditures arising initially on the manufacturer side, 
marketing and finally reaching to the customers.
2.3.1.2 Business Model—Traditional
In this type of model the consumers are physically present for purchasing 
the goods from the market. It is just like buying products from the local 
store. This model is a purely centralized one which is controlled by some 
regulators. Different businesses exist which are centralized by different reg-
ulators, controlled and managed by the authorities which includes:
a. The organization,
b. The stakeholder or owners,
c. The workers, and
d. The consumers.
Traditional business model are divided into the following types:
1. Manufacturer
2. Distributor

 They are the ones who make products from the raw mate-
rials; they can also assemble the components to make the 
products. Common examples are computer & automobiles. 
This model can directly sell products to the customers, i.e., 
B2C or they can outsource to other businesses, i.e., B2B also. 
For example, dye manufacturers sell to the retailers which 
then sell them to the customers.
2. Distributors
 The organization with the distributor model purchases 
the products directly from the manufacturers and they 
supply to the wholesalers then to retailers or to the cus-
tomers. The main responsibility of this model is to set 
the value which in return provides profit to the company. 
Adding on to that, it makes marketing strategies which 
can bring more sales of the products. In general, its role 
is an inter-mediator between the manufacturer and the 
local users.
3. Need of Customers Fulfilled
 The companies which are having retailer business model 
have the function to sell products directly from distribu-
tors to the customers. Retailers can supply products both 
via online and offline mode. Online retailers like those 
selling products on e-commerce website include Amazon, 
Flipkart, Myntra & Shopclues. Offline retailers are sim-
ilar to those departmental stores, local shops which exit 
physically. 
4. Franchise
 This model comprises of other business models which are 
mentioned above. The purchaser of franchise is called fran-
chisee for e.g. Pizza Hut.
  A traditional business model provides services or prod-
ucts and gains profit from them. Consumers purchase the 
product or service at the recommended rate. This price is 
set correspondingly and it also has the description about the 
earnings and other expenditures aroused by the business 
while providing the goods or services.

The Scope for Blockchain Ecosystem  41
2.3.2 Are Blockchain Business Models Really Needed?
The Blockchain business models provide an opportunity to the central-
ized platform to upgrade their businesses into decentralization. It turns 
the individual elements, transactions, profits, and also assures growth. This 
technology has the potential to give benefit to both—actors and central-
ized employees. Before switching to the Blockchain models certain points 
should be memorized about it:
• Entrepreneur or startups or already established organization 
can implement the blockchain in their businesses.
• Not easy to delete records which are already on Blockchain.
• Blockchain’s main uniqueness is its transparency which 
helps in uplifting of the functioning of supply chain. 
An application of this technology can be seen in the fourth industrial 
revolution where many firms have developed their own decentralization of 
Artificial intelligence model.

2.3.2.2 Model 1: Utility Token Model
A token can be regarded as a value, stake or representation of anything 
functioning in a particular ecosystem. Unlike crypto currencies, they are 
not dependent on some platform but tokens (golem) are used for a spe-
cific platform within the ecosystem called as native token. The utility token 
provides products and services to the users. The tokens have the potential 
to promote more functionality in the business. Examples of these kinds of

models are Ripple and Stellar. The utility tokens power the network and 
expedite the network activities. A part of the utility tokens is held by busi-
nesses and the rest is liberated for the functioning of the network. The stake 
of utility token changes because it works according to the supply–demand 
criteria; if the demand of the product increases, its supply decreases which 
tends to increase in value. This way, this model provides benefit to the busi-
nesses. It involves properties such as:

This model provides the link between the organization and the com-

song, all the backend materials need consideration by the music direc-
tor including mike, lyrics, recording room and bass volume, mainte-
nance of software records, etc. which tend to be time-consuming and 
expensive. BaaS works as similar type handles, all the backend things so 
that the music director gets only focused on song without concerning 
himself about the infrastructure, costing and maintenance. It enables 
the client to focus only on the frontend instead of backend stuff. An 
agreement has been made between the organizations in which BaaS

agrees to be responsible for all the blockchain technology including 
monitoring of the system, management of bandwidth and providing 
security of system against hacking attacks. By making contract with 
the BaaS partners the startups/entrepreneurs transfer the load of infra-
structure and system performance allowing them to focus on their 
main business and competitive strategies. BaaS enables customers to 
develop their own blockchain applications by using cloud-based ser-
vices, ensuring its functioning, hosting and usage which resemble that 
with the web hosting providers.
Apart from this if entrepreneur manages to get blockchain up, then he/
she has to deal with all the maintenance. The can be overcome by mak-
ing smart contract with the organizations with blockchain technology 
platforms.
In the market there are some famous existing BaaS providers such as: 
Oracle, IBM-blue mix, Google Firebase Microsoft-Azure module and 
Amazon-AWS. It includes providing businesses with an ecosystem to help 
manage their blockchain system. The costing varies while using Baas ser-
vices. It depends on multiple factors like how much transaction has been 
done, how many simultaneous transaction made at what rate. It implies 
pay according to the units of the services that are in use.
2.3.2.4 Model 3: Securities
The security which is provided on the blockchain is called as securities. Many 
of the convenient businesses have moved towards new technology includ-
ing finance and stock market. Another name for security tokens are equity 
tokens, which are regulated by the government in comparison to the util-
ity one. They provide more speed and soothe blockchain to the traditional  
businesses by ensuring security against any bug or fraudulent activities. 
Security Token is Equal to Investment Contract
Assets like four-wheeler, real estate or stocks of organizations—which 
contain some value. For these assets, security tokens are the bonds (smart 
contracts) containing fragment of amount. This token ensures the freehold 
of any strong suit that is stored and secures on the new technology plat-
form. After verification of the proprietorship the people who hold security  
token can:
• Be beneficial for other investment.
• Be used as an assurance for sanctioning of loan.
• Can be put in distinct pocketbook.

2.3.2.5  Model 4: Development Platforms
The blockchain is a space where many entrepreneurs and startups are land-
ing with the agenda of solving their problems in a different manner. Most 
of them are developing decentralize applications.
As stated by Metcalfe’s Law, the more networks in use, the more will be 
its value. Like with two telephones, you are only able to make a single con-
nection, if there’s single phone it is useless, by using the formula
 n(n − 1) / 2
 2 ∗ 1 / 2 = 1.
However, when there are 5 phones, you can make 10 connections. 
Involvement of enormous people makes the network more in use. That’s 
why most fortunate networks can enjoy severe aggressive hike.
There are three models which are specific:
• Charging Fees for using network.
• Recruiting Auditors.
• Other Services.
a. Charging Fees for Using Network
 Ethereum requires gas for producing fuel which is helpful 
in running of blockchain 24 days and 7 nights. Anyone 
who develops dapps on this platform pays an amount 
similar to toll tax payable in the form of gas fees. The 
charges depend on the completion of the transaction, 
how much complex it is varies accordingly. Gas tokens 
are used in NEO for creating dapps. The tokens which 
can be purchased and sold are Golem Network Tokens. 
GNT is a method of payment for computation of the 
resource providers. One pays what for the service is mea-
sured by GNT.
b. Recruiting Auditors
 If in case it was found that transaction record on blockchain 
is illegal or not authorized or classification is not done cor-
rectly then this led to the need of an auditor to carry out 
its procedure on management’s estimates. Even if we say 
blockchain does not require a third party but when it comes 
to check whether the product was solely delivered and does

not require an auditor to go through the transactions pro-
cess. When the organizations make business with other par-
ties, they prefer auditors to verify smart contract as these 
contracts are for automation of the process of business. 
Decentralized applications consume a very big amount for 
the working of the code appropriately. If there is a minor 
bug it will lean towards the failure of the entire system. A 
recent example of this is a DAO smart contract which led 
to the split of Ethereum community into Ethereum and 
Ethereum Classic.
 This model can work in two ways:
• The smart contract needed to be checked—developers 
need to hire the auditing company.
• Independently auditors and developers check the code 
and look for defects if they found any in the code. Also, 
the developers put up a premium on their contract.
c. Other Services
 A blockchain startup needs lots of work. The startup first 
requires a website with good content and frameworks. 
These startups either recruit freelancers or agencies to save 
both time and money including taking care of these services 
for them.
2.3.2.6 Model 5: Blockchain-Based Software Products
This includes small scale businesses which sell to the higher scale busi-
nesses in return for reasonable amount for the applications based on the 
technology. Apart from getting a reasonable payment upfront, exposure 
of blockchain technology to the organizations is beneficial to them. They 
will also need to provide support post-implementation. Media Chain 
blockchain being sold to Spotify. To resolve royalty issues prevalent in 
the music industry. As companies don’t want to bear the load of tedious 
procedure—acquiring talent is another reason for acquiring this business 
model.
2.3.2.7 Model 6: Blockchain Professional Services
This model offers services to the entrepreneur, corporate or startup busi-
nesses to make their hands on practice on this new technology. Some com-
panies like Deloitte and IBM are already making projects on blockchain

technology that can be contacted for completion of project by other busi-
nesses. There is no need to put money in the h/w or s/w—connecting 
directly to the services offered by these companies.
2.3.2.8 Model 7: Business Model—P2P
P2P model ensures direct interaction between end-users. It allows the end 
users to use the technology (blockchain) for building software that makes 
the whole internet as non-authorized. Casting of this can be done by BaaS, 
tokens, and charging from network. Tools which based on this model are 
File coin, Sia, Etheria and IPFS. Like Wikipedia, is open to everyone—any-
one can make changes in the contents or can revise the contents. Its serve 
as a medium for true P2P exchange.
1. IPFS 
 This system works as a replacement of http—it is developed 
in such a manner that it can hold the transaction in outer 
space even i.e. the pending issues of http are solved by this 
web applications.
2. File Coin
 This is a monetary based system developed for storage 
of information and having its own crypto currency. In 
exchange of user’s not used storage space they provide them 
some value. 
3. Sia
 This tool uses the new technology for transaction aim 
towards replacing of Dropbox, Google Drive.
4. Etheria
 This protocol focused on the blockchain gaming proper-
ties by building blocks in the upgrading ecosystem. Some 
games like Beyond the Void and Spells of Genesis are built 
on blockchain gaming platform.
What makes blockchain business model different from the traditional 
one is that it assures P2P interactions, removing all the middle man. By 
creating a trustless system, vanishing mediator for verification of records 
and fasten the faith. In Pvt Ltd companies, in this platform board of 
director and owners are absent. However they are present in the block-
chain model theoretically and their interactions methods are changed 
dramatically.

2.4 Is Blockchain Business Ecosystem Profitable?
As for blockchain entrepreneurs and developers to make profit is a 
straight path—in the hope that their project will work out and value of 
their assets will increase by keeping some parts of the token as equity 
share combined with liquidity of their tokens as return of their reward. 
It’s not simple to understand though how they cover the costs. At the 
initial stage, the investors get the crypto assets at low prices. Many of the 
crypto assets developers and entrepreneurs hold an Initial coin offering 
to crowd fund their project. In this way, developer gets sufficient amount 
to cover the costs.
Revenue can be earned by any one of the following:-
1. By charging network fee for using network or gas fee.
2. Value of dapp increases with the increase in the number of 
users implies token may up in price. A utility token can be 
traded within the network. For example, in video games dig-
ital currency which help in accessing the game is taken to be 
as utility token which helps in buying game materials, and 
can be traded.
3. By selling technology to a higher business like previously 
mentioned media chain blockchain acquired by Spotify.

2.5 How Do You “Design” a Business Ecosystem?
Where Traditional business model is related to planning and planting a 
flower, designing an ecosystem is far like growing a whole forest: more 
complicated, with extra players to interact & unexpected coming results. 
Certain challenges also exist resembling that of a consumption–outcome 
problem or like chicken–egg problem.
However, business ecosystems, analogous to construction of forest, 
can’t be entirely planned and designed—they also come up. For eco-
system designing the following steps should be kept in mind which are 
interconnected:
• Knowing about the problem to be solved.1
• What are the components of the ecosystem?2
• Know about the starting governance model of ecosystem?3
• How to grab the cost of ecosystem?4
• Can you determine the consumption-outcome problem at the time of
  beginning?
5
• Assuring the reliability of ecosystem?6
1. Knowing about the problem to be solved.
2. What are the components of the ecosystem?
3. Know about the starting governance model of ecosystem?
4. How to grab the cost of ecosystem?
5. Can you determine the consumption–outcome problem at 
the time of beginning?
6. Assuring the reliability of ecosystem?
Step 1: Knowing about the problem to be solved?
Initially, problem should be defined clearly which the ecosystem is going 
to solve so that it can convince the high business investors and right actors 
for participation. If someone has ever thought 20 years ago that businesses 
like YouTube and Instagram could be built on taking selfies, then posting 
photos of your meals, and animals clips.
• Is ecosystem the best choice?
 Ecosystem–blockchain business includes everything that a 
physical ecosystem (servers, clients, h/w, s/w) contains. The 
following are key points in what scenario ecosystem might 
be preferred:

 ➢ Need for decentralization, transparency and immutability of 
records.
 ➢ When Gateways are more expensive and time consuming 
like Expedia or Airnb.
 ➢ Need for more security among users and developers.
 ➢ When the speed of the new data is increasing anonymously 
as well as previous record is also mandatory to be stored.
What type of ecosystem you required?
Since all business ecosystem functionalities are not same, some business eco-
systems work on the project completion—as small level players in the mar-
ket and then handing over the project to the higher players. Some work on 
the transaction ecosystem by linking the providers and the requestors. Some 
work on the solution ecosystem which combines all the elements of the solu-
tion of the problem. As a startup business in this technology, one needs to 
know about the type of ecosystem, as they all differ in their construction, 
purpose, monetary mechanism and most importantly, success factors. 
Step 2: What are the components of ecosystem?
Different participants get roles on the basis of the value prototype. A solu-
tion ecosystem can be understood by the examples of chorus having many 
mentors, suppliers and middleman.
In transaction ecosystems, the band director guide’s (who teaches cho-
rus) role is played by the owner of the business ecosystem whose role is to 
tie a bond between manufacturers, suppliers and customers. The director 
guide constructs the ecosystem, inspires to join the system, describes about 
regulations, standards and rules. The success of the ecosystem depends on 
the responsibility completed by the assigned role. Also equating invest-
ment needed for the longevity of ecosystem is sustained. The failure of the 
ecosystem or we can say dissociation of the system is because of the Band 
director guide not being able to fulfill the duty assigned to him.
Step 3: Know about the starting governance/authority model of ecosystem?
Determining Degree of Openness
Authority required balancing two requirements for the business ecosys-
tem to get success: amount creating & sharing.
Main governance query for business ecosystem which is emerging-what 
is the degree of its openness. Queries in 3 areas having solution:
• Admittance: In the business ecosystem that are going to be 
as partners? In order to get entry to the ecosystem and its 
resources what conditions do they have to fulfill?

The Scope for Blockchain Ecosystem  51
• Partners: To structure the business ecosystem at what extent 
are participants invited? What are the capacity, fine points, 
and severity of the rules allowing this? Who’s going to decide 
the distribution of the value among the various participants?
• Assurance: Are the participants permitted to opt for multi-
mode in competing with other businesses? In few sectors, 
they battle for their own degree of openness. If we have a 
look Android broke the superiority of Apple iOS by pro-
viding connectivity of openness, Facebook conquers the 
fragility of MySpace’s open model by providing the icon 
of accepting request or deleting i.e. providing property in 
friend’s feature. From the monetary point of view open eco-
system grows faster as compared to the others at the time 
of execution. It also encourages decentralization and allows 
variety of developers and partners.
However, to authorize the open ecosystem is not easy though, therefore 
it iswell adapted for goods and services with finite drawback and less cost 
of deterioration. Growth v/s quality, decentralized v/s interconnectedness, 
and speed v/s flexibility are various individual factors on which the exact 
degree of openness for business ecosystem will rely on.
Step 4: How to grab the cost of ecosystem?
For what charges are applicable?
The main question of the ecosystem “chorus” is the value i.e. money 
should be distributed equally among the participants and keep share of 
profit for its own. Also, the amount should be enough to be assigned among 
the participants. Apple takes itself 30% from the app that it sold from its 
application store. Similarly the businesses create ecosystem that can be sold 
as a service to higher businesses in order to capture value.
Step 5: Can you determine the consumption-outcome problem at the time 
of beginning?
What conditions led to its failure?
The failure of the ecosystem at the time of execution is because the 
authority was not able to calculate the size of the participants—how many 
buyers will be there? How many sellers will be there? Due to this, they 
are not able to protect the network which results in crash of the ecosys-
tem. Sometimes they overestimate the profit and is negligent towards the 
importance of network effects. This race is not coming at first position but 
first with complete solution. For example, Apple iPod was not first in the

digital market but it was first with a combination of software iTunes with 
hardware. Another very important factor is to get to know about the num-
ber of transactions by the number of participants. Being aware of network 
density is an important driver of amount for the actors.
Lastly, the selection of participant is important. It doesn’t matter how 
many participants are there but their quality matters. For example in Uber, 
there are equal numbers of riders and drivers so it is a balanced one. 
Step 6: How can you assure the reliability of ecosystem?
Is scaling can be possible?
Yahoo search engine initially started as a hierarchical database edited 
by employees and WebPages are classified based on tree structure. Yahoo 
gained popularity for a very small time with the advent growth in  internet—
at that time it was not scalable and ultimately taken over by Google with 
the scaling page rank algorithm. So, if you desire to have long term via-
bility of the ecosystem, it is important to get best knowledge of the scal-
ability position, design and strategy of the developing business ecosystem. 
Among the three, scalability is the main step for the availability.
How expansion of the ecosystem takes place?
Expansion. Let’s have a look on some examples—Instant change in 
technologies and customers preferences Microsoft still manages to defend 
Windows as an operating system over the three decades. Uber initially 
started its ride services but extended to the food delivery and bike riders 
services. When LinkedIn started, its aim was to establish a link with the 
professionals but at present it serves as an online recruiting and publish-
ing contents. Therefore, for the expansion of ecosystem, it should be hav-
ing two features: stability and flexibility so that new functionalities can be 
added to the system accordingly. In reference to this, we can say expansion 
of ecosystem takes places by:
1. New products can be added in to an existing system.
2. Expanding the services in the same market (Uber).
3. Creating advantage after the success of one ecosystem (Apple 
iPods). 
How can you protect against adverse reaction?
Large business ecosystem has experienced adverse reaction from the 
customers and managers. On the top of list is Amazon who was recently 
criticized for not collecting sales tax in order to come first in the race 
of competitors similarly with eBay. Also, Uber was blamed for security,

violation of the rules of transportation, insurance and rights of the drivers 
and worker’s rights that are applicable to taxis. Last on the list is Facebook 
which was criticized for not securing the data of the users. Hence, the eco-
system should be designed in such a manner that it should not only veri-
fied legally but also socially for its longevity. Business ecosystem can only 
thrive in future if it tries to persistently adhere to concrete value for their 
consumers and disseminate equal value to all its contributors.
To design an ecosystem is a main attempt so the above-mentioned six 
interconnected steps are helpful in designing a business ecosystem. Any 
entrepreneur or start up can be structured if the design is followed wisely 
or it can bring transition in the existing organization. It is also important 
to understand that any business ecosystem cannot be completely designed 
as well as planned like in the case of a forest they also emerge.
Those ecosystems that want to gain profit in the future will have to 
be flexible, ready for the up gradation in technologies—both hardware/ 
software, unwanted happenstance and also working according to customer 
preferences. 
2.6 Redesigning Future With Blockchain
To sum up, for someone to excel in new technology is not enough for 
Blockchain business ecosystem, but what is required is to reconsider the 
market role, existing industries ecosystem and their financial worth. Many 
elements have to be (re)designed in this composite system.
2.6.1 Is Earth Prepared for Blockchain?

or in business ecosystem are having bundle of advantages but with the

adoption of new technology there are many unintended outcomes also in 
the coming years—the blockchain can really become a burden that planet 
earth has to bear with. The technology require energy to keeps its lon-
gevity so in the blockchain technology the energy released by using the 
crypto currency are of very high intensity. Crypto currencies are bitcoin, 
litecoin, doge coin, bat, Ethereum, neo, ripplexrp, cardano and many more. 
Whenever in use, it require a significant amount of energy, although not 
all of them. Some operate on less amount of energy. Transaction of crypto 
currencies—Ehereum, Neo and Cardano—require 13 times lesser than the 
energy needed to transact bitcoin. This is an additional feature that block-
chain solution is adding to the next gen computers to be as energy efficient 
directed with the increase in power and computational speed but keep-
ing the low usage of energy. Many organizations are constructing energy 
bare blockchain framework which will be operating on PoA. In order to 
make earth a better planet, Building Blockchains so that the blockchain 
energy usage can be applied in the appropriate direction i.e. the incentives 
arising from the uptake of renewable resources and de-carbonization must 
be used for the reforestation. If the transaction of single Bitcoin can con-
sume power almost one fifth of the country’s houses per day then it can be 
predicted how much there is a need for blockchain solution as an energy 
savior. Moreover to that, for every 11 min a new Bitcoin transaction takes 
place. This is the need of an hour for the Blockchain technology which is at 
its beginning state that will be beneficial for many sectors if used appropri-
ately in both technology protocols and its applications parts.
To develop Effective Blockchain solution:
1. Tackle blockchain for environmental value
 Construction of international bank shared between two 
countries and multiagency blockchain initiative led to a 
number of profits that can be seen in different fields such 
as ocean health, plastic articles, electronic machines and 
management of the natural resources. If the actors want that 
blockchain will meet the expectations of the global envi-
ronment then again interconnections are necessary for the 
international organizations in order to receive the reward of 
this technology.
2. Combine blockchain with AI & IoT
 The traditional method that we were using for sharing infor-
mation whose privacy is not confirmed has transformed into 
the new blockchain technology which has given a transpar-
ency factor in sending or receiving data. Combining with

IoT, this technology has completely converted the central-
ized regulatory into the decentralized one due to the envi-
ronmental problems of the natural system of the third planet 
which can be monitored, analyzed deeply adding that cli-
mate changes can be well-observed and how much energy 
usage per crypto currency is making adverse effect on the 
environment. To date, cloud computing and big data have 
been profitable by IoT and now it’s blockchain’s.
3. Collaborate for interdisciplinary solutions
 It is clear now that blockchain builds the system as crystal 
clear providing transparency of data, but this technology 
can meet the expectations of the planet if there exists coop-
eration between all the participants. Different sectors can 
collaborate and interconnect in order to enable blockchain’s 
applications to run smoothly. Shareholders, miners, domain 
specialist and actors are required to interact with each other 
for optimizing the services provided by this new blockchain 
technology.
  To make earth a better planet, interconnectedness among 
NGO, non-profit sectors, private and public are needed. A 
successful digital infrastructure has been developed by var-
ious efforts by the energy companies and the finance orga-
nization which is openly helping towards decentralization 
and de-carbonization the energy system. To implement 
the interdisciplinary approach—combining data scientists 
with environment and industry practitioner—is possible 
by working together in a research institution. Thereby, how 
can this blockchain technology can be of use? What are its 
impacts if used excessively? And what are risks that the envi-
ronment has to face?
  The answers to the above-mentioned three queries can 
be possible if all the experienced technology scientists are 
researching together to ensure the sustainability of block-
chain technology.
4. Prediction of challenges and unintended consequences- 
political economy
 New technology has the power to change the existing 
system- industries into the authorized one. The regulators 
must be concerned about if these changes take place how 
will it affect the economy rate and the participants of the

existing systems. Stakeholders worry more about handling 
of trust factor of data privacy and security.
5. Deliver “responsible blockchain”
 While focusing on the reduction of energy consumption and 
increasing revenues for the developers and the participants, 
if the strategy becomes out of plan then the blockchain tech-
nology looks in to privacy rights and clarifications of the 
accountability. GDF organization works together with other 
companies for governance, so that stakeholders involve 
themselves directly within blockchain ecosystem in a sys-
tematic manner.
  Making important arrangements required by governance.
6. Development of rapid approach to governance and regulation
 In present scenario we are having the centralized system—
having management to control the system if any harm occurs 
in the technology where the regulators play an important 
role in monitoring the developments and taking action if 
they found any malfunction in the technology. If the differ-
ences occur between the authorities is at the greatest level 
then it will become a major challenge within the distributed 
system.
7. Frame more globally coordinated solution
 The global interconnected architecture can be structured by 
the blockchain technology as it has spread its roots in all the 
fields. Following are the points on how the blockchain eco-
system is governed:
 a. Making organization to be self-regulated
  Without worrying for the formal regulations proceedings— 
blockchain provides new choices to this system; finan-
cial freedom and self-sovereignty are underpinnings of 
self-regulation. A global code which is a supplement for 
regulations can be identified by global good practice. Some 
of the self-regulating processes already running in a few 
countries—U.S.(EQWITY), Japan(Last roots), Philippines 
(startups), and Singapore(TBD). To make relations with the 
environment, the self-regulators can be compromised and 
central regulation can develop the set of requirements. 
 b. Government policies which makes nations to be regulated
  Recently, this is the best method to command blockchain 
with local managers who are responsible to maintain area of 
authority in order to battle if any recognized fault arises.

  Greener protocol can be adopted by the blockchain com-
munities. The funds which are received by government can 
be used for blockchain research which looks for scaling  
public-private projects. 
 c. Regulations comprehensible globally
  To run blockchain technology at an international level—
The international authorities and global managers are facing 
challenges in to order to understand the regulations globally. 
If small firms are having difficulty with blockchain, global 
organization will look into it, will establish a relation with 
environment along with harmony crosswise jurisdiction.
2.7 Challenges and Opportunities
In this chapter we discuss about the blockchain as a game changer, tech-
nology in both environment and business ecosystems. No doubt, this tech-
nology is better in every field for providing the transparency, saving energy 
usage and is far better as compared to the traditional models. But whenever 
some technology comes in the market it brings some challenges along with 
it. The technical issue that blockchain technology address is limited with is 
scalability because of foreordain in terms of the size of blocks and energy 
used by the crypto currencies. Though blockchain technology is decentral-
ized, distributed and based on cryptographic techniques, it is not totally 
exempted from security issues as rising of cloud computing and quantum 
computing combined with the physical, digital and biological areas with 
the increase in speed and intelligence can prove dangerous to the block-
chain ecosystem.
The challenges can’t be avoided—they also concur with the 4th industrial 
revolution i.e., AI, IoT, where an autonomous vehicle is able to generate 
opportunities for global development and creation of value. These tech-
nologies also have the power to speed up the environment’s degradation.
No doubt that these challenges need attention as the technology is 
upgrading day-by-day. Soon there will 6G technology, though China has 
already launched 6G phones, Japan announce the startup of 7G technol-
ogy. As the advancement of revolutions is at its peak, blockchain develop-
ers have to cope-up with these technologies. Nevertheless, the opportunity 
window not be open forever.
The opportunities offered by the responsible blockchain ecosystem need 
to be authorized sincerely and regulators should be ready for not expected 
outcomes and failures. Just in case things go wrong, a variety of rules are

required assuring an agreement with privacy rights to improvising secu-
rity issues. Shareholders willingly share all these duties. The demand of 
the present time has compelled all the actors, miners, developers, produc-
ers, suppliers and retailers to use the blockchain technology for solving 
everything. For this requirement, a structured approach can help the prac-
titioners on how to use this technology. 
In the end, the future of blockchain is ready for time being, aware of the 
commitments and going through the facts and data. There are far more 
companies and people with data and views on the immediate and future of 
blockchain. Covering everything is not possible so creating a list of more 
forecasts on the future of blockchain in the real world versus the virtual 
one need focus on the practical—the real instead of the promises, the 
applications and the industries.
