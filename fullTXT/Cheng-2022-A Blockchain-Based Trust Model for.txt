Abstract: Malicious users can upload illegal data to the blockchain to spread it, resulting in serious
threats due to the tamper-proof characteristics of the blockchain. However, the existing methods
for uploading illegal data identification cannot select trust nodes and ensure the credibility of the
identification results, leading to a decrease in the credibility of the methods. To solve the problem,
this paper proposes a blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification. The trust
model mainly has the following two core modules: Reputation-based random selection algorithm
(RBRSA) and incentive mechanism. By assigning reputation attributes to nodes, the proposed RBRSA
will select nodes according to reputation values. RBRSA favors the nodes with high reputation value
to ensure the randomness and credibility of the identification nodes. The incentive mechanism is
designed to ensure the credibility of the identification results through the credibility analysis of
the model based on game theory and Nash equilibrium. Identification nodes that identify illegal
data correctly will obtain incentives. In order to obtain a higher income, the identification nodes
must identify illegal data correctly. Credibility analysis and comparative experiments show that
the probability of selecting credible nodes by RBRSA is up to 23% higher than the random selection
algorithm. The probability of selecting the nodes with a reputation value of 20 by RBRSA is 27% lower
than the random selection algorithm; that is, the probability that RBRSA selects untrusted nodes
is lower. Therefore, the nodes selected by RBRSA have superior credibility compared with other
methods. In terms of the effect of the incentive mechanism, the incentive mechanism can encourage
nodes to identify data credibly and improve the credibility of identification results. All in all, the
trusted model has higher credibility than other methods.

1. Introduction
A blockchain [1] is essentially a decentralized distributed ledger, which is composed of
a series of blocks that record data [2]. The block header of each block has the cryptographic
hash value of the previous block and is connected to the previous block through this
hash value [3]. The blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization [4], tamper-
proof [5], and anonymity [6]. Due to the tamper resistance and anonymity of the blockchain,
the blockchain attracts many malicious users who use these features to upload harmful
information and other illegal behaviors [7]. The occurrence of these security incidents has
greatly adversely affected the development of blockchain technology, so it is necessary to
control the blockchain. One of the directions is to use the technology of the blockchain to
control the uploading of illegal data. The first step is to identify the uploading of illegal
data through the technology of the blockchain. How to use the technology of the blockchain
to realize the reliable identification of uploading illegal data is an urgent problem to be
solved. It is of great significance for the long-term development of blockchain technology

to strengthen the identification of illegal acts on the blockchain and establish an effective
blockchain risk identification system.
In recent years, many scholars have discovered illegal data information on the chain.
In 2014, Spagnuolo [8] proposed a modular framework called Bitlodine for identify-
ing blockchain, investigating CryptoLocker ransomware, and accurately quantifying the
amount of ransom paid and victim information. In 2016, Matzutt [9] identified and ana-
lyzed the data stored in the blockchain, classified various contents, and found some illegal
information. In 2018, based on previous research, Matzutt [10] identified blockchain fund
transfers and uploaded illegal content and found that in more than 1600 documents, most
of them were text or images, and these documents had obvious illegal content. In 2020,
Goldsmith [11] identified and analyzed the blockchain hacker subnetwork and found
that hackers would change BTC into certain specific funds. In addition, according to the
network characteristics, hackers were classified into different hacker groups. From the
above brief literature review, it is evident that blockchain can store illegal data, but neither
of them proposes a credible method to reduce such illegal events. Therefore, it is urgent to
propose a credible identification model to reduce the occurrence of uploading illegal data.
In order to solve the problem of the low credibility of existing models, this paper
proposes a blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification by adding
a new identification blockchain to identify illegal data that is about to be on-chain in a
decentralized voting manner. Nodes are designed as anonymous participants, which can
be companies or individuals who wish to obtain income by identifying illegal data. Nodes
are only selected as identification nodes by the selection algorithm. In the trust model, the
incentive mechanism rewards or punishes the identification nodes based on their behavior.
They must act honestly in order to obtain higher returns. The analysis of game theory and
the Nash equilibrium principle proves its credibility.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. This paper proposes a trust model for uploading illegal data identification. The identi-
fication blockchain identifies the data by decentralized voting. Only when the number
of votes exceeds the specified number will the identification blockchain consider the
data as illegal data. The identification nodes can obtain benefits through the identifica-
tion service. In order to obtain a higher income, they must identify the data fairly.
2. This paper designs a reputation-based random selection algorithm. The identification
blockchain generates identification nodes by the reputation-based random selection
algorithm. The algorithm tends to nodes with high reputation values. The seed is
hashed by node total reputation value, block height, and timestamp. Each time you
select an identification node, the seeds are hashed again. Ensure the randomness and
credibility of the identification nodes.
3. This paper analyzes the model with game theory and proposes an incentive mecha-
nism based on the results. This paper conducted a game theory analysis among the
identification nodes. In order to obtain higher income, the identification nodes must
honestly identify the data. According to the analysis, this paper designs an incentive
mechanism for identification nodes. The incentive mechanism can punish or reward
the identification nodes, which can encourage identification nodes to identify data
fairly and impartially, thereby improving the credibility of the model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The Section 2 discusses the related
work on the models for uploading illegal data identification. The Section 3 introduces
the blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification. The Section 4
introduces the key technologies such as reputation-based random selection algorithms and
incentive mechanism design in detail and uses the Nash equilibrium principle to prove
its credibility. The Section 5 introduces the prototype and experiment of the model. The
Section 6 introduces the conclusions of the paper and future work.

2. Related Work
Blockchain identification can be roughly divided into the following two ways: on-chain
identification and off-chain identification [12].
Off-chain identification is similar to a traditional direct democratic structure, involving
R&D personnel and users at the core of the blockchain. The most famous examples are
Bitcoin [13] and Ethereum [14]. The off-chain identification models are relatively concen-
trated. In addition to the corresponding operation on the blockchain, some operations are
also needed outside the blockchain, which will consume time. In addition, the off-chain
identification models for uploading illegal data are not very credible, and the efficiency is
not high.
The on-chain identification model is a relatively new concept. The main difference
is that the identification models are placed on the blockchain, and the identification is
mainly realized by blockchain smart contracts. The blockchain has the characteristics of
decentralization and can provide a basis of trust for two parties [15]. A smart contract is
one of the key technologies of blockchain, which can automatically execute the contract
content under certain conditions. It can achieve credible transactions without the involve-
ment of third parties. Li [16] proposed a blockchain-based solution to the problem that
house construction operation records are easy to be forged and tampered with and used
the anti-tampering properties of the blockchain to achieve credible records of operations.
Yong [17] proposed a blockchain-based solution for problems such as the falsification of
vaccine records, which achieves a credible record of vaccine data by using the tamper-proof
features of blockchain and smart contract technology. Omar [18] used smart contracts to
design a general framework to solve the problem that it is difficult to accurately track
anti-epidemic materials during an epidemic. Zhu [19] proposed a blockchain method for
credibly recording infectious disease information, which greatly facilitates the credible trace-
ability of infectious disease paths. Zhou [20] designed a witness model using blockchain
smart contract technology to achieve a credible record of cloud service violations. Based
on this, it is feasible to use blockchain technology for credible identification of blockchain
illegal data, namely, identification on the chain.
The consensus in the on-chain identification model is usually realized by protocol
voting and is managed and executed automatically by an algorithm. Dursun [21] proposed
an on-chain identification governance model for the cumbersome blockchain identification
governance model. The model utilizes policy-based management and decentralized identi-
fication technology to realize the identification and governance of the blockchain system.
Although the model is simple and friendly, it cannot filter honest nodes, resulting in low
credibility of the model. Bao [22] proposed a multi-supervised licensing blockchain model
for the authenticity of blockchain transactions. The model supports identification and
auditing, and its security and efficiency are proved by experiments. Although the model is
safe and efficient, it is difficult to guarantee the credibility of nodes. Fan [23] proposed a
multi-chain token support voting framework for MULTAV. The framework can enhance
the security of on-chain identification through voting, but the node may make the opposite
judgment because of the interests, resulting in the low credibility of the model. Although
these models realize the identification and governance of the blockchain. However, on the
one hand, because these models lack a method of selecting nodes, the credibility of nodes is
low. On the other hand, these models lack an incentive mechanism, and nodes may make
opposite identifications because of interests, resulting in low credibility of identification
results. The two reasons will lead to a decrease in the credibility of the models.
3. Trust Model for Uploading Illegal Data Identification
This chapter will introduce the trust model and identification nodes. The overall model
architecture for implementing identification using smart contracts is then explained, and
the tasks of the identification blockchain and nodes are described.

3.1. Symbols Involved in The Trust Model
In the trust model for uploading illegal data identification, there are the following
two kinds of blockchain: the identification blockchain to identify uploading illegal data
(identification blockchain, IBC) and the identified blockchain (identified blockchain, IDBC)
that will upload the data. The paper will use a basic case to demonstrate the work, as follows.
The paper assumes that an IDBC will upload a piece of data. Before data is uploaded
to the blockchain, data needs to be identified. In order to prevent the data retransmission
problem caused by the interruption of data transmission, IDBC will upload data to IPFS and
send the returned hash to IBC. IBC broadcasts hash to each identification node (identifica-
tion node, IN). IN downloads data through hash and identifies data. During identification,
TIdenti f ication, IBC will return a corresponding token based on the IN voting identification
result. In addition, if the data is not illegal data, part of the identification fee will be reduced,
FReward. That is, IDBC will eventually pay IBC FIdenti f ication or FIdenti f ication − FReward.
There are the following two kinds of nodes in IBC: identification nodes and nor-
mal nodes (normal node, NN). Blockchain, as a trusted party, provides a platform for
businesses or individuals who wish to govern the blockchain or earn revenue through
identification services. They need to register as NNs before they can be selected as INs.
INs earn revenue by providing identification services. In order to improve credibility,
Number INs form an identification committee to participate in the identification process,
{IN1, IN2, IN3, . . . , INNumber}. INs identify illegal data together and obtain identification
fees from IDBC as a reward. Here it is assumed that the aims of INs are to gain the highest
revenue, that is, INs are selfish.
3.2. Scheme Architecture
The trust model for uploading illegal data identification is shown in Figure 1. The
trust model consists of the following two types of smart contracts: the smart contract of
identification node pool (Smart Contract of Identification Node Pool, INPSC) and the smart
contract of identification (Smart Contract of Identification, ISC). INPSC mainly has the
following three responsibilities: NN registration, NN state transition, and IN selection.
NN has the opportunity to be a member of INs only through the registration function and
being “Online”. In this trust model, the incentive mechanism of IBC is to provide credit
and token incentives for INs. The more INs, the more reliable the model is and the higher
the credibility.
The process of a trust model for uploading illegal data identification is shown in
Figure 1. Firstly, IBC generates INPSC and ISC. Before identification begins, the IBC is
required to negotiate identification treaties with the IDBC, including identification time
TIdenti f ication and identification fees FIdenti f ication. Among them, the most important thing
between IBC and IDBC is to discuss the number of INs, Number. The more INs, the higher
the credibility of the identification. At the same time, the increase in Number will also
lead to an increase in identification costs. According to the negotiation result, the IBC fills
these parameters into the ISC. Then, through the reputation-based node random selection
algorithm in Section 4.1 to select INs. These INs will form an identification committee. The
algorithm is implemented by the INPSC on the IBC, and the ISC is responsible for calling
the algorithm. The design of the algorithm is biased towards nodes with high reputation
values and is random; thereby, improving the credibility of IBC identification and realizing
mutual trust between IBC and IDBC. IDBC will send the hash value generated by the
data information and token stored in IPFS to IBC. It should be noted that IBC will send
a token to IDBC. IBC will broadcast the hash to all INs of the identification committee.
Each IN downloads data information through this hash value. If illegal data information is
identified, INs can immediately report the data information to the IBC.

data information and token stored in IPFS to IBC. It should be noted that IBC will send a 
token to IDBC. IBC will broadcast the hash to all INs of the identification committee. Each 
IN downloads data information through this hash value. If illegal data information is 
identified, INs can immediately report the data information to the IBC.

Figure 1. The overall architecture of the trust model. 
ISC will start timing since the first IN report that the data is illegal, 𝑇𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 . During 
this time period, the ISC will accept reports from other INs. When the timer ends, if the 
ISC receives no less than 𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙 reports from the identification committee, the IBC will 
automatically confirm that the data information is illegal. Among them, 𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙 is also 
the result of negotiations between IBC and IDBC, and IBC will put 𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙 into ISC as an 
important parameter. It should be noted that 𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙 must be more than half of 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟. 
The larger the 𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙, the identification result of the IBC will be more credible. For exam-
ple, if there are 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 = 5 identification nodes in the identification committee, at least 
𝐼𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑙 = 3 reports are required, and IBC can confirm that the data information is illegal. 
It should be noted that ISC will only receive identification reports from committee mem-
bers, and reports sent by non-committee nodes will be considered illegal reports and will 
be rejected. Meanwhile, INs cannot report multiple times within the same reporting pe-
riod. In a sense, the 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 identification nodes constitute a 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 man game. In this 
game, each IN is eager to obtain the maximum benefit. This paper designs the incentive 
mechanism, as shown in Section 4.2, and uses the Nash equilibrium principle of game 
theory to prove why INs must be honest players in the game; that is, they must honestly 
report illegal data information. 
Finally, the blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification 
will end in two cases. One case is that the identification time 𝑇𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  has ended, and 
the data information is not illegal. Another case is that the data information is illegal in-
formation. According to these different situations, IN and IDBC receive corresponding 
fees from the contract. Section 4.2 explains this in detail. 
  
Figure 1. The overall architecture of the trust model.
ISC will start timing since the first IN report that the data is illegal, TReport. During
this time period, the ISC will accept reports from other INs. When the timer ends, if
the ISC receives no less than Illegal reports from the identification committee, the IBC
will automatically confirm that the data information is illegal. Among them, Illegal is
also the result of negotiations between IBC and IDBC, and IBC will put Illegal into ISC
as an important parameter. It should be noted that Illegal must be more than half of
Number. The larger the Illegal, the identification result of the IBC will be more credible.
For example, if there are Number = 5 identification nodes in the identification committee,
at least Illegal = 3 reports are required, and IBC can confirm that the data information is
illegal. It should be noted that ISC will only receive identification reports from committee
members, and reports sent by non-committee nodes will be considered illegal reports and
will be rejected. Meanwhile, INs cannot report multiple times within the same reporting
period. In a sense, the Number identification nodes constitute a Number man game. In this
game, each IN is eager to obtain the maximum benefit. This paper designs the incentive
mechanism, as shown in Section 4.2, and uses the Nash equilibrium principle of game
theory to prove why INs must be honest players in the game; that is, they must honestly
report illegal data information.
Finally, the blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification
will end in two cases. One case is that the identification time TIdenti f ication has ended, and
the data information is not illegal. Another case is that the data information is illegal
information. According to these different situations, IN and IDBC receive corresponding
fees from the contract. Section 4.2 explains this in detail.
4. Key Technology
This section will describe in detail the key techniques in the trust model. The trust
model realizes the identification of illegal data, and the identification result has high
credibility. First, a reputation-based random selection algorithm is used to ensure that the
majority of INs elected to the identification committee are credible and independent. On
this basis, the incentive mechanism of INs is given. At the same time, through the principle
of Nash equilibrium, it is proved that the INs in the identification committee must be
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 6 of 18
reported honestly. Revenue can be maximized only when data information is identified
fairly. Furthermore, the paper also analyzes a malicious identification node and shows that
such behaviors can be avoided by the incentive mechanism.
4.1. The Detailed Design of RBRSA
In the blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification, it is very
important to identify the data information from IDBC fairly and impartially; that is, IN
cannot be biased towards IDBC. The paper proposes a reputation-based random selection
algorithm for committee member selection, as shown in Algorithm 1. The algorithm in this
paper is implemented in INPSC. Different from the selection algorithm of the paper [20],
the selection algorithm is based on reputation, and the higher the reputation, the greater
the probability of being selected. When the reputation value of NN is lower than 0, NN
will no longer be selected as IN.
Algorithm 1 Reputation-Based Random Selection Algorithm()
Input: A set of Registered NN, NNAddrs, a list of addresses;

3: for i = 0; i<NNAddrs.length && NN.state = WState.online; i++ do
Trust += NN.Trust;
end for
Hash =Hash(Trust, timestamp, height);
for node = 0; node < Number; node++ do
Seed = Hash % Trust;
reputation← 0;
for n = 0; n<NNAddrs.length && NN != IBC && NN != IDBC && NN.state

if InPool[NNAddrs[n]].state != WState.NNtoIN then
reputation = reputation + NN.Trust;
if Seed < reputation then
NN.state = WState.NNtoIN;
NN.confirmDeadline = now+ 5 minutes;
NN.IdentificationContract = sender;
onlineCounter–;
Trust -= NN.Trust;
INC←NN;
Break;
end if
end if
end for
Hash = Hash(Seed, timestamp);
end for
return INC;
First, the trust model has a basic smart contract that manages normal nodes. INPSC
provides a set of interfaces for any IBC node to join in the identification node pool. In
addition, the state of the NN can be changed to “Online” or “Offline”, and only the NN that
is “Online” can be selected as IN. The management of NNs state is introduced in Section 5.1.
NNs in the identification node pool are managed in registration order.
INPSC is designed with two interfaces called by ISC to select Number INs in the
identification node pool. The “Request” interface is mainly used to record some parameters
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 7 of 18
necessary for selecting the algorithm. The “Sortition” interface is used to select Number
INs from NNs.
Seed = Hash(trust, block.timestamp, block. height) (1)
Seed = Hash(Seed, block.timestamp) (2)
RBRSA uses the hash value as the seed. The hash is consisting of the total reputation
value in the node pool, timestamp and block height, as shown in the Formula (1). RBRSA
selects NNs with high reputation value according to seeds but does not rule out selecting
NNs with low reputation. In addition, every time a quasi-identification node is selected,
a new seed is generated. The new seed is generated based on the previous seed and
timestamp, as shown in Formula (2). Repeat this process until Number quasi-identification
nodes are selected. At the beginning of Algorithm 1, RBRSA will check whether the
available NNs are enough. The number of NNs is much larger than INs to ensure the
fairness and randomness of the algorithm output.
Considering the difficulty of using the hash value composed of the total reputation
value in the node pool, timestamp, and block height as the seed and it is difficult for the
outside world to know the total reputation value in the node pool. The paper can prove
that the random selection algorithm based on reputation is credible. That is, IDBC cannot
manipulate selection results to prevail in the identification committee.
4.2. Incentive Mechanism and Nash Equilibrium
Game theory is a mathematical theory and method to study the phenomenon of
competition; it is a new branch of modern mathematics. Many scholars have made great
contributions to the advancement of science and technology by combining game theory with
other applications, including economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science [24].
The goal of game theory is to mathematically predict the behavior of a target. The behavior
of these participants depends not only on themselves but also on the behavior of others.
One of the most common forms of game theory is the strategic form of multiplayer
games. The definition consists of a set of actors (IN), a set of strategy profiles, and an
incentive function. The INs constitute the basic type of dynamic game with complete
information in game theory. The so-called complete information means that the incentive
mechanism of each IN is known to others. The IN game is defined as follows:
Definition 1. Identification game. This is a game of Number INs, (INC, ST, EX).
Where INC = {IN1, IN2, . . . , INNumber} is a set with Number INs. Each IN is se-
lected through the reputation-based random selection algorithm, and these INs form an
identification committee.
ST = ST1 × ST2 × . . .× STNumber is the action strategy configuration of a group of
INs, where STh is a set of action strategies for identification node INh. INh can choose
any action ACh ∈ STh. Each IN may take different actions in each identification process,
namely, AC = {AC1, AC2, . . . , ACNumber}. (h = 1, 2, . . . , Number).
EX = {EX1, EX2, . . . , EXNumber} is a set of incentive functions. EXh is the incentive
function of identification node INh for specific action strategy ACh. EXh = {Rh, Ph} where
Rh and Ph represent reputation incentive and token incentive respectively.
In the identification process, the identification game roughly has two actions, reporting
illegal data information to IBC and keeping silent, namely, ACh =
{
ACr
h, ACs
h
}
. In the
game process of Number INs, the INs that report illegal data information are put into the
reporting set INR, and the INs that do not report illegal data information are put into
the silent set INS, where if ACh = ACr
h then INh ∈ INR; If ACh = ACs
h then INh ∈ INS.
These operations determine whether the data information is illegal. Only when the number
of elements in the INR is greater than Illegal or equal to Illegal, the data information will
be identified as illegal data. For details, refer to Definition 2. Otherwise, the IBC identifies
it as normal data information. The identification is complete now.
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 8 of 18
Definition 2. Confirmation of illegal data information.
When ||INR|| >= Illegal, where 1 < 1
2 Number < Illegal < Number. That is, if there
are no less than Illegal INs reporting the data information, the IBC considers the data
information illegal. Otherwise, IBC considers that the data information is normal.
Here Number should be as large as possible, the larger the Number, the higher the
credibility of the identification result. In addition, Illegal < Number and Illegal > 2, in
order to more fairly and credibly identify the data information. When INs identify, INs
need to pay the corresponding deposit for each report to the IBC. If the data information
is not identified as illegal data information, IN will not be able to recover the deposit and
deduct the credit value. According to the above analysis, the detailed incentive mechanism
design is shown in Definition 3.
Definition 3. Incentive mechanism. Design the incentive mechanism according to the final
identification result.
When the identification result is that the data information is illegal as follows:

When the identification result is that the data information is normal as follows:
∀INh ∈ INR, Rh(ACr) = Rh − µ× (Rh − RMIN)×

Equations (3) and (6) are the reputation and token reward formulas when the iden-
tification nodes successfully identify data. Equations (4) and (5) are the reputation and
token penalty formulas when the identification nodes identify data incorrectly. Among
them, µ is a reputation factor, which is responsible for controlling the increase and decrease
speed of the reputation in different situations. µ is suggested [0.1, 0.3]. Count is the times
of participation and Correct is the times of correct identification. It should be noted that the
advantage of doing this is that INs with a high reputation can be prevented from doing
evil. Because every time IN does evil, IN will reduce a large amount of reputation value,
thereby reducing income. At the same time, incentive mechanisms can encourage nodes
with low reputation value to identify data correctly. Because IN identifies data correctly
each time, IN will gain more reputation value, thereby increasing income. According to
game theory, if an IN knows what other INs will do in the future, IN will choose an action
strategy that maximizes payoff based on the actions taken by other INs, which is called the
optimal reaction. Therefore, the optimal reaction to IN defines is as follows.
Definition 4. The optimal reaction of identification node INh.
Let AC−h = {AC1, AC2, . . . , ACh−1, ACh+1, . . . , ACNumber} is the set of other INs
actions without INh. Then the optimal reaction action strategy for INh to other nodes
is ∀ACh ∈ STh, so that EXh(ACh, AC−h) ≥ EXh(ACh, AC−h), so that INh obtains the
maximum benefit.
The Nash equilibrium point can be regarded as a stable state between Number identi-
fication nodes. In this state, no other action strategy will be chosen by any IN. At this point,
each IN will take the best action strategy to obtain the maximum benefit.
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 9 of 18
Definition 5. Nash equilibrium: This is a special IN action point AC = (ACh, AC−h). If every INs
action ACh is the action policy of optimal reaction to the action AC−h of the other identification nodes.
That is, ∀INh ∈ INC and ∀ACh ∈ STh, you can obtain EXh(ACh, AC−h) ≥ EXh(ACh, AC−h).
Based on the above definitions, the following theorems can be deduced:
Theorem 1. In the node identification game, there are only two Nash equilibrium:
AC = (AC1, AC2, . . . , ACNumber), where ∀INh ∈ INC, ACh = ACr
h
AC = (AC1, AC2, . . . , ACNumber), where ∀INh ∈ INC, ACh = ACs
h
Proof of Theorem 1. According to definitions 1 and 2, in a game with Number INs,
Number ≥ 3, Number
2 < Illegal < Number. where Number and Illegal are both integers.
�
For the set of policy profiles ∀INh ∈ INC, ACh = ACr
h, this means ||INR|| = Number >
Illegal, so the data information is illegal. According to the incentive mechanism designed
in Definition 3, ∀INh, INh can obtain the benefit is EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+). If an IN
chooses silence instead of report. The final identification state of the data information
will not be changed, because ||INR|| = Number − 1 ≥ Illegal, the income of the IN is
EXh
(
ACs
h, AC−h
)
= (−, 0) < EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+). By Definition 5, the policy
configuration file is a Nash equilibrium point.
Similarly, for another set of policy configuration file ∀INh ∈ INC, ACh = ACs
h, this
means that ||INS|| = Number > Number− Illegal ≥ 2. Therefore, the identification result
of the data information is normal. By defining the incentive mechanism of 3, it can be known
that ∀INh, INh can obtain the benefit is EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+). If an IN chooses another
action strategy, that is reporting illegal data information, the identification result of the data
information will not change. Because ||INS|| = Number− 1 > Number− Illegal − 1 ≥ 2.
Then the income of the IN is EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (−,−) < EXh
(
ACs
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+).
By Definition 5, the action policy configuration is also a Nash equilibrium point.
Other action policies are a combination of actions, including reporting illegal data
messages and silence. It means ||INR|| 6= ∅ and ||INS|| 6= ∅. There are two cases at
this moment, the data information is illegal or normal. When the data information is
illegal, ||INR|| ≥ Illegal, ∃INh ∈ INS, it can change the operation to report the data
information. However, the identification result of this data does not change, because
||INR||+ 1 > Illegal, thereby increasing INh’s income from EXh
(
ACs
h, AC−h
)
= (−, 0) to
EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+). These examples show that the action policies of these INs are
not the Nash equilibrium point.
Therefore, in the identification game between INs, there are only two Nash equilib-
rium points, namely, AC = ACr
1, ACr
2, . . . , ACr
Number and AC = ACs
1, ACs
2, . . . , ACs
Number.
Taking five identification nodes as an example, namely, Number = 5, according to Def-
inition 2, Illegal = Number/2 = 3. Table 1 shows the incentive effects of different be-
haviors. The value elements in Table 1 are the vectors of the corresponding incentive
mechanism, which can be expressed as (EX1, EX2, EX3, EX4, EX5). According to Theo-
rem 1, the Nash equilibrium points of INs are [(+,+), (+,+), (+,+), (+,+), (+,+)] and
[(+,+), (+,+), (+,+), (+,+), (+,+)].
It can be seen from the above analysis that for a rational IN who wants to obtain more
benefits if the IN wants to maximize the benefits, with the least risk, the IN must perform
the identification work as follows. If the data information is illegal, IN knows that most
other nodes are more likely to report the data information to obtain more income. Therefore,
the IN also reports that the data information is illegal. On the contrary, if the data infor-
mation is normal, the node knows that other nodes will not report the data information to
reduce losses because each IN has to pay a deposit for each report. It can be seen from this
that when the data information is normal, all INs are more inclined to remain silent, thus
achieving a Nash equilibrium that is AC = (ACr
1, ACr
2, . . . , ACr
Number). Similarly, if the data
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 10 of 18
information is illegal, the profit-seeking nature of INs will make them report the data infor-
mation to reach another Nash equilibrium point, namely, AC = (ACs
1, ACs
2, . . . , ACs
Number).

It can be seen from the above analysis that in order to obtain maximum benefits, INs
must choose to be honest nodes; that is, INs must identify the data information fairly
and impartially.
4.3. The Analysis of the INs Uncertainty Behavior
Inspired by the uncertainty concept [25,26], this section intends to discuss and explain
the uncertainty of IN behavior. Because INs are selfish and subjective, some INs may take
different actions for their benefit. For example, IN knows that the data is illegal, but IN
does not report it because of the benefit. The uncertainty of IN behavior will decrease the
credibility of the model. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the uncertainty of IN behavior.
• Malicious Behavior: Because nodes are selfish, some INs may engage in malicious
behavior for their benefit. INs incorrectly identify data when facing benefits, leading
to a decrease in the credibility of the model.
Anonymous mechanisms and voting consensus in the trust model can avoid this
problem. First of all, each IN is anonymous. It is difficult for the outside world to know
which NN is selected as an IN, so it is difficult for the outside world to make INs do
malicious behavior through benefit. Secondly, the voting consensus of the trust model has a
certain fault tolerance. The model allows some INs to identify data incorrectly. Finally, the
incentive mechanism will punish the nodes who do malicious behavior. The income of ma-
licious nodes changes from EXh
(
ACr
h, AC−h
)
= (+,+) to EXh
(
ACs
h, AC−h
)
= (−, 0). The
reputation value of malicious nodes decreases, which will also reduce the future benefits of
nodes. Because the reward of the incentive mechanism is related to the reputation value.
• Credible Behavior: Because nodes are subjective, some INs still engage in credible
behavior when facing benefits. The incentive mechanism in the trust model will reward
the nodes that exhibit credible behaviors. The incentive mechanism will improve the
reputation of nodes. Nodes with a high reputation will have a higher probability of
participating in the identification service, so the nodes will obtain more income.
• Alliance Behavior: Some INs make the same wrong decision together, thus affecting the
results of identification. The trust model has an anonymity and selection mechanism.
On the one hand, anonymity can ensure that nodes cannot know the identity of other
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 11 of 18
nodes. On the other hand, the nodes selected by RBRSA are random, and the nodes
cannot control the results of the selection. Therefore, the model can ensure that the
INs are independent.
• Lazy Behavior: The behavior of INs does not actively work, because some INs are
lazy when faced with these incentives. Regardless of whether the data information
is illegal, INs do not report the data information to IBC. In this way, INs can obtain a
low income.
The reputation value of the node can help the trust model better manage lazy behavior.
When the data information is illegal, although the INs that fail to report the data information
will not be punished by tokens, the reputation of INs will be deducted. INs who report
the data information but whose final result is normal will not only be penalized tokens
but also have decreased reputation value. In addition, when Correct remains unchanged
but Count increases, the INs will increase less and less reputation value and will decrease
more and more reputation value. At this time, the lazy node will obtain fewer and fewer
incentives. When a node’s reputation value is 0, the node will no longer be selected as
IN. Additionally, the final incentive mechanism is also linked to the reputation value. In
this way, the number of lazy IN will reduce. Each IN will be encouraged by the incentive
mechanism to identify data information fairly and impartially.
5. Results and Discussion
According to the trust model for uploading illegal data identification and incentive
mechanism design, we use Ethereum smart contracts to conduct related experiments. In
the trust model for uploading illegal data identification, there are two types of smart
contracts, including INPSC and ISC. In this part, we expound on these two kinds of
contracts separately, describe the detailed functions of the interface in the smart contract,
and show several states of IN. Afterward, we experimented with the transaction costs of
these interfaces on the Ethereum test net.
The interfaces designed in both smart contracts are named as the text on the arrows in
Figures 2 and 3, blue for ISC and yellow for INPSC. The format of the text is role:interface,
which means that only the role or smart contract can call the interface. Smart contracts can
implement specific functions for specific roles through inspection mechanisms, which is a
feature of the programming language provided by Ethereum. Among them, IBC stands for
the identification blockchain, and IDBC stands for the identified blockchain. IN stands for
identification node, and ISC stands for the smart contract of identification. INPSC stands
for the smart contract of an identification node pool.
5.1. Implementation of INPSC
This part will focus on the implementation details of the smart contract for the iden-
tification node pool, including the management of NN and the selection of IN. Figure 2
shows the four states of the node defined in the smart contract, namely, “Online”, “Offline”,
“Quasi-IN” and “IN”. The state transition mechanism of INs is as follows.
After a blockchain node is registered in INPSC, it will become a normal node in the
identification node pool. NNs can choose between “Offline” or “Online” status. NNs in
the “Offline” state do not participate in the selection algorithm. Only NNs in the “Online”
state have the chance to be selected as “Quasi-IN” by RBRSA. At this time, NNs need
to check their status on IBC at all times. Checking their status does not require any fee,
which meets the requirements of NNs to frequently check their status anytime, anywhere.
After the status becomes “Quasi-IN”, there will be a timing window. If NN selects the
“INconfirm” interface before the time ends, the status will become “IN”. If the “Reject”
interface is chosen, the random selection algorithm will be re-executed. After calling the
interface “INconfirm” of the ISC, it represents the NN selects to become IN. Before the end
of the data information identification process, IN has the right to choose “INrelease” to
voluntarily withdraw from ISC. In addition, the IBC can also dissolve the identification
committee through the “ResetIN” interface.

To reduce malicious nodes, we set the reputation value attribute for NN to measure
its behavior. Each node will be assigned an initial reputation value Rinit when the node
registers. It can be a predefined constant or a value depending on some interest relations.
Here the initial value is set, Rinit = 50. In addition, because some NNs do not check their
status frequently when ISC selects them as candidate nodes, they cannot select and confirm
to join the identification nodes within the specified time. At this point, their status changes
to “Quasi-IN”. To return to the “Online” state, nodes need to use the “Reverse” interface.
5.2. Implementation of ISC
Figure 3 shows the state transition of the ISC identification result. There are the follow-
ing five identification states: “Free”, “Init”, “Identification”, “Illegality”, and “Completion”.
As shown by the circle in Figure 3. Arrows indicate the paths of state transition. The
Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9657 13 of 18
two squares in the figure represent the corresponding roles in the smart contract. At the
end of the identification, they can withdraw the income separately.
Smart contracts on IBC cannot run on their own. State transitions must be initiated
by some interfaces and need to pay the corresponding cost to run. We designed interfaces
to modify the state of INs, which can be used when the state needs to be modified. For
example, when the identification service ends normally, IBC can end the identification
through the “IBCEnd” interface. At the same time, INs can obtain the identification fee
through the incentive mechanism, and IDBC can be returned part of the fee as a reward.
Similarly, when the data information is identified as illegal data information, it can end the
identification through “IBCEndIllegalandWithdraw”. At this time, the identification fee will
be allocated to INs, and the identification state will also be converted from “Identification”
to “Completion”.
5.3. Trust Model Results and Analysis
In order to test the blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identifi-
cation, we conducted simulation experiments for smart contracts on “Rinkeby”. We set
up several accounts on “Rinkeby” to simulate different roles, namely, IDBC, IBC, and INs.
We use the interface by “Ether” for each account and pay different fees according to the
incentive mechanism. For experimentation, we first deployed the most basic INPSC and
registered several accounts in the identification node pool. Then, IDBC sends the hash
value returned by IPFS to IBC to start to identify the data information. After that, we test all
possible scenarios to test and validate all interfaces. The results show that the trust model
in this paper basically meets the identification needs.
The credibility of the trust model is proved by game theory and guaranteed by the
reputation-based random selection algorithm and incentive mechanism. The credibility is
supported by the technology of the blockchain itself. Therefore, we mainly analyze some
performance information from experimental studies. Among them, performance refers to
the complexity of each interface in the contract. It determines the fees that need to be paid
by INs in IBC. Because INs need to execute certain programs defined in the method, the
more complex the interface is, the higher the cost it needs to pay, that is, the higher the cost.
This is measured by Ethereum’s definition of “Gas”. The identification fee is the product
of “Gas” consumption and the price per unit. The cost is similar whether it is in the main
network or in the simulation experiment. Therefore, we recorded all “Gas” consumption
for each operation of the trust model.
Figure 4 shows the simulation results of the trust model. It can be seen that compared
with IDBC and IN, IBC needs more cost consumption in the whole identification cycle, and
IDBC and IN use less interface consumption. This is in line with the original intention of
the model design. In most cases, IBC is the maker of tokens and has more tokens, and
IBCs main purpose is to identify the illegal data that IDBC is about to upload to the chain.
INs consume less “Gas” but obtain more “Gas”. IDBC pays less “Gas”, which is very
small compared to the identification service fee paid. These cost expenditures can persuade
INs and IDBCs to participate in the trust model. In addition, “Gas” consumptions are
implemented based on smart contracts. It is possible to further optimize the complexity to
reduce gas consumption.
5.4. Algorithm Results and Analysis
In the comparative experiments of random selection algorithms, different algorithms
are applied in smart contracts, and the smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum test
network “Rinkeby”. In this paper, five nodes are placed on the test network. These nodes
are set to have the same or different reputation values. The experiments were carried out
20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 times. Experiments test the effects of different algorithms on selecting
three nodes from five nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figures 5 and 6.

the main network or in the simulation experiment. Therefore, we recorded all “Gas” con-
sumption for each operation of the trust model. 
Figure 4 shows the simulation results of the trust model. It can be seen that compared 
with IDBC and IN, IBC needs more cost consumption in the whole identification cycle, 
and IDBC and IN use less interface consumption. This is in line with the original intention 
of the model design. In most cases, IBC is the maker of tokens and has more tokens, and 
IBCs main purpose is to identify the illegal data that IDBC is about to upload to the chain. 
INs consume less “Gas” but obtain more “Gas”. IDBC pays less “Gas”, which is very small 
compared to the identification service fee paid. These cost expenditures can persuade INs 
and IDBCs to participate in the trust model. In addition, “Gas” consumptions are imple-
mented based on smart contracts. It is possible to further optimize the complexity to re-
duce gas consumption.

5.4. Algorithm Results and Analysis 
In the comparative experiments of random selection algorithms, different algorithms 
are applied in smart contracts, and the smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum test 
network “Rinkeby”. In this paper, five nodes are placed on the test network. These nodes 
are set to have the same or different reputation values. The experiments were carried out 
20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 times. Experiments test the effects of different algorithms on select-
ing three nodes from five nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figures 5 and 6. 
Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison among the node selection algorithm proposed 
in this paper, the node selection algorithm in the paper [20], and the greedy algorithm. 
There are two cases when selecting three nodes out of five nodes. Figure 5 shows the 
number of times that five nodes are selected when the reputation values are the same. 
Figure 6 shows the number of times s that 5 nodes are selected when the reputation values 
are 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20. It can be seen from Figure 5 that in the case of nodes with the 
same reputation value, the number of times that NNs are selected as INs is roughly the 
same among the three algorithms. However, RBRSA is 23% and 13% higher than the al-
gorithm [20] when the nodes have reputation values of 100 and 80. RBRSA is 11% and 
27% lower than the algorithm [20] when the nodes have reputation values of 40 and 20. 
The number of times that the two algorithms select nodes with a reputation value of 60 is 
approximately the same, as shown in Figure 6. Although the greedy algorithm can select 
honest nodes and is better than the other two algorithms, in the face of different reputation 
values, the greedy algorithm will definitely select the nodes with the highest reputation 
value. On the one hand, nodes with low reputation value will no longer be selected, which 
lacks fairness. On the other hand, once nodes with high reputation values are united, the

credibility of the identification model will be reduced. Therefore, compared with the other 
two algorithms, the nodes selected by RBRSA are more credible.

5.5. Incentive Mechanism Results and Analysis 
In the experiment of the incentive mechanism, we assume that the nodes continu-
ously correctly or incorrectly identify the data and show the effect of the incentive mech-
anism under different μ by controlling the parameter μ, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. 
Figure 7 shows the effect of reputation increase when a node has correctly identified 
data 50 consecutive times. As can be seen from the figure, when the number of correct 
identifications increases, the reputation value also increases. However, the bigger the rep-
utation value, the slower the reputation value increases. In addition, as the value of μ 
increases, the convergence of reputation value is faster. Figure 8 shows reputation de-
creases when a node incorrectly identifies data information 20 times in a row. As can be 
seen from the figure, as the number of incorrect identifications increases, the reputation 
value decreases. However, the lower the reputation value, the slower the reputation value 
decreases. In addition, as the value of μ increases, the convergence of reputation value is 
faster. Therefore, the incentive mechanism can reduce malicious nodes between high rep-
utation value nodes because the incentive mechanism will make more penalties for high 
reputation value nodes; incentive mechanism can increase credible nodes in low reputa-
tion value nodes because the incentive mechanism will reward low reputation value more.

Figure 6. Comparison of algorithms under different reputation values.
Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison among the node selection algorithm proposed in
this paper, the node selection algorithm in the paper [20], and the greedy algorithm. There
are two cases when selecting three nodes out of five nodes. Figure 5 shows the number of
times that five nodes are selected when the reputation values are the same. Figure 6 shows
the number of times s that 5 nodes are selected when the reputation values are 100, 80, 60,
40, and 20. It can be seen from Figure 5 that in the case of nodes with the same reputation
value, the number of times that NNs are selected as INs is roughly the same among the
three algorithms. However, RBRSA is 23% and 13% higher than the algorithm [20] when
the nodes have reputation values of 100 and 80. RBRSA is 11% and 27% lower than the
algorithm [20] when the nodes have reputation values of 40 and 20. The number of times
that the two algorithms select nodes with a reputation value of 60 is approximately the
same, as shown in Figure 6. Although the greedy algorithm can select honest nodes and is
better than the other two algorithms, in the face of different reputation values, the greedy
algorithm will definitely select the nodes with the highest reputation value. On the one
hand, nodes with low reputation value will no longer be selected, which lacks fairness. On
the other hand, once nodes with high reputation values are united, the credibility of the
identification model will be reduced. Therefore, compared with the other two algorithms,
the nodes selected by RBRSA are more credible.
5.5. Incentive Mechanism Results and Analysis
In the experiment of the incentive mechanism, we assume that the nodes continuously
correctly or incorrectly identify the data and show the effect of the incentive mechanism
under different µ by controlling the parameter µ, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.
Figure 7 shows the effect of reputation increase when a node has correctly identified
data 50 consecutive times. As can be seen from the figure, when the number of correct
identifications increases, the reputation value also increases. However, the bigger the
reputation value, the slower the reputation value increases. In addition, as the value
of µ increases, the convergence of reputation value is faster. Figure 8 shows reputation
decreases when a node incorrectly identifies data information 20 times in a row. As can be
seen from the figure, as the number of incorrect identifications increases, the reputation
value decreases. However, the lower the reputation value, the slower the reputation value
decreases. In addition, as the value of µ increases, the convergence of reputation value
is faster. Therefore, the incentive mechanism can reduce malicious nodes between high
reputation value nodes because the incentive mechanism will make more penalties for high

reputation value nodes; incentive mechanism can increase credible nodes in low reputation
value nodes because the incentive mechanism will reward low reputation value more.

In the experiment of the incentive mechanism, we assume that the nodes continu-
ously correctly or incorrectly identify the data and show the effect of the incentive mech-
anism under different μ by controlling the parameter μ, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. 
Figure 7 shows the effect of reputation increase when a node has correctly identified 
data 50 consecutive times. As can be seen from the figure, when the number of correct 
identifications increases, the reputation value also increases. However, the bigger the rep-
utation value, the slower the reputation value increases. In addition, as the value of μ 
increases, the convergence of reputation value is faster. Figure 8 shows reputation de-
creases when a node incorrectly identifies data information 20 times in a row. As can be 
seen from the figure, as the number of incorrect identifications increases, the reputation 
value decreases. However, the lower the reputation value, the slower the reputation value 
decreases. In addition, as the value of μ increases, the convergence of reputation value is 
faster. Therefore, the incentive mechanism can reduce malicious nodes between high rep-
utation value nodes because the incentive mechanism will make more penalties for high 
reputation value nodes; incentive mechanism can increase credible nodes in low reputa-
tion value nodes because the incentive mechanism will reward low reputation value more.

6. Conclusions 
Aiming at the credibility problems of existing models, this paper proposes a block-
chain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification. Firstly, the paper pro-
poses a trusted model for uploading illegal data identification. The trust model identifies 
the illegal data by means up decentralized voting. The model improves credibility 
through RBRA and incentive mechanisms. Secondly, the paper proposes a reputation-
based random selection algorithm. The algorithm will bias toward the nodes with high 
reputation values, but it does not exclude the selection of nodes with low reputation val-
ues, so as to ensure the randomness and credibility of the identification nodes. Finally, the 
paper analyzes the model in terms of game theory and Nash equilibrium and proposes an 
incentive mechanism. Although nodes with high reputation value increase less in reputa-
tion value, they can obtain higher token income. The nodes with low reputation value can 
obtain more reputation value, but the income is less. We experimented with the model of 
the Ethereum smart contract. The results show that RBRSA can select credible nodes and 
that incentive mechanisms can encourage nodes to make credible identification. There-
fore, the model in this paper is more credible than other models. Although RBRSA and 
the incentive mechanism improve the credibility of the model, a single reputation value 
cannot accurately describe the credibility of nodes, and the consensus efficiency among 
nodes is also low. Therefore, in future work, we will further study the attributes of nodes 
and consensus among nodes to improve the credibility and efficiency of the model.
