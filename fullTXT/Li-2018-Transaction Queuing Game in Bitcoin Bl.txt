Abstract— Abstract- Bitcoin is a novel protocol with
the potential of enabling a decentralized and trustless
cryptographic currency, and its underlying technology named
blockchain operates on a worldwide basis via a complex
set of rules originally proposed by Nakomoto in 2008. In
Bitcoin blockchain, miners provide computational services
(i.e. mining) to get profits from the fixed rewards of newly
found block and also transaction fees from recording the
users’ transactions to the blocks. With the decreasing of
the fixed new block reward, transaction fees will play the
role as the main profit source of miners, thus provide
important supports for the sustainability and vitality of the
Bitcoin system. Therefore, it is of great necessity to research
transaction fees. In this paper, we investigate transaction fees
in a queuing game with non-preemptive priority, in which
both the miners’ mining rewards and the users’ time cost
are highlighted. Then, we conduct theoretical analysis of the
game, getting five types of Nash equilibria of the game. We
also find that the over-long waiting time will bring negative
marginal profits on transaction fees to some users with low time
cost, therefore, they will not be willing to offer transaction fees.

I. INTRODUCTION
Bitcoin blockchain was designed by Nakamoto [1] as a
peer-to-peer decentralized trustless network [2], [3], in which
any update of the data could be recorded into a block after
being agreed by all participants. A new block is appended
to a chain of previously agreed upon blocks, creating a
complete record of all the data updating that have ever taken
place [4]. In the Bitcoin blockchain, miners compete to
solve the computational problem and provide the requisite
security [5]. The computational problem involves a brute

force approach to find a specific ”hash function” or the string
of numbers, which is called mining [6].
During the mining process, miners should first pick out
the unconfirmed transactions pending in the memory pool
(mempool), which significantly influences their mining dif-
ficulties and also revenues. The winning miner or pool can
determine the transaction volume within the range of zero to
the maximum block size of 1 MB currently [7]. Generally,
the larger is the transaction volume, the higher will be the
transaction fees. Miners can choose group mining through
joining a pool or individual mining just by themselves. The
one who first finds the specific hash value that solves the
computational problem will be rewarded with a fixed number
of newly issued Bitcoins known as a block reward, and also
the transaction fees from recording the packed transactions
to the new block. The fixed reward was originally set to
50 bitcoins while the protocol determines that it will be
halved each time 210,000 blocks are permanently added to
the blockchain, which happens approximately every 4 years.
When the protocol eventually stops creating new Bitcoins,
the fixed rewards for mining will be entirely replaced by
transaction fees [8].
In the past, the mining incentive is almost only due to
the new block reward creation [9], but the situation will not
last forever [10]. It is foreseeable that with the decreasing
of the fixed new block reward and the increasing mining
difficulty (Figure 1), the continuous increase of miners’ rev-
enues (Figure 2) should be greatly attributed to the growing
transaction fees (Figure3)1. As such, transaction fees are the
only way Bitcoin users can encourage miners keep mining
in the long run [7]. The long-term level of fees is uncertain,
yet they are highly relevant to the security and sustainability
of the system [11]. Therefore, it is necessary for the Bitcoin
blockchain to view high of transaction fees, since they play
the crucial role to encourage miners and mining pools to
work on computational problems thus keep the vitality of
the system.
In this paper, we strive to study the role of transaction
fees in the transaction queuing game played by miners and
users. First, miners’ mining strategies are researched to probe
the transactions flow-out rate in a stable mempool. Usually,
miners pick up transactions to the new block according to
transaction fees, which means the transaction queuing is
with non-preemptive priority determined by transaction fees.
Then, we study the flow-in rate of mempool, which is a

set of different flow-in rate of users with different priorities.
Base on the research of the flow-out and flow-in rates of
mempool, we compute users’ waiting time, and formulate
a game-theoretical model to consider their expected profits.
Also, the Nash equilibria of the game are analyzed.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly re-
views the related literature. In Section III, a game-theoretical
model will be proposed to research the transaction queuing
of users offering transaction fees. Equilibrium analysis will
also be conducted. Section IV concludes this paper.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Bitcoin blockchain economics have attracted wide re-
search interests [4], [13], [14], but transaction fees economics
still received very limited attentions. Kroll et al. (2013)[15]
considered that transaction fees have little importance, al-
though their mining game research did not include it. It
has been speculated that higher fees will lead to faster
confirmation [11], but over-high transaction fees will render
Bitcoin uneconomical for micro payments [10], [12]. Lavi et
al. (2017)[16] argued that Bitcoin’s current fee market does
not extract revenue well when blocks are not congested.
Houy (2014)[7] studied the economics of Bitcoin’s trans-
action fees in a very simple partial equilibrium setting,

Fig. 3. Transaction Fees in Bitcoin Blockchain
and showed that the fixed transaction fee is equivalently
to setting a maximum block size instead. If the transaction
fee is totally determined by a decentralized market and
the maximum block size is not constrained, the transaction
fee will eventually go to zero and miners will not have
the necessary incentives to keep mining, hence to keep
Bitcoin viable. Chalkias & Dionysiou (2016)[17] viewed
transaction fee as alternative reward schemes for miners in
blockchain systems. The larger the processing fee, the longer
a transaction could reside in the blockchain before being
considered dormant. To understand how users select their
transaction fees, Huberman et al. (2017)[18] analyzed the im-
plied congestion queuing game, calculated each user’s trade-
off between transaction fees and delay cost, and derived that
each user’s equilibrium transaction fee equals the externality
his transaction imposes. Thus, equilibrium transaction fees
coincide with the payments that result from selling priority of
service in a VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction. Easley et
al. (2017)[5] investigated the role that transaction fees play
in the Bitcoin blockchains evolution from a mining-based
structure to a market-based ecology. Lavi et al. (2017)[16]
proposed two alternative auction mechanisms: The monop-
olistic price mechanism, and the random sampling optimal
price mechanism. They proved that the monopolistic price
mechanism extracts revenue better from users, and that it is
nearly incentive compatible.
Our work is the extension of the study in [5] to consider
the research setting where miners are with different hashing
powers and the users are with different transaction fees,
which makes the transaction queuing game much more
complicated and the closer to the real Bitcoin system.
III. MODEL
In Bitcoin blockchain, the main players are users and
miners. Here, we consider the common case that M miners
operate in a pool, and they solve computational problems to
get the new block’s reward S and also the transaction fees
collection F from recording transactions in the blocks, and
115

we have
F =
N
∑
i=1
f i
where f i is the transaction fee from user i, and there are
N users who has transactions unconfirmed in the mempool.
With the purpose of optimizing the expected profits, miners
pick up transactions with high fees, and users offer transac-
tion fees to move forward in the queue and thus shorten the
waiting time.
A. Miners and Mining Profit
Assume the hash power of a miner j is h j, and the fixed
mining cost is c j, and the variant unit cost of time spent
on mining is e j. In the pool, miners work independently to
find the particular hash, and get rewards according to their
contributions, therefore, the probability that the miner j is
the first one to find the hash value is h j/H, and
H =
M
∑
j=1
h j.
Therefore, the miner j has the expected revenue as:
Pj =
h j
H
(S+F)
We assume that the success of each miner to find the
particular hash value is subject to a Poisson distribution with
the arrival rate λ j, so the expected time until the first success
is 1/∑ j λ j. Then, the expected profit for the miner j is
P̃j =
h j
H
(S+F)− 1
M
∑
j=1
λ j
e j − c j
The mining game of these miners are free entry-exit, there-
fore, the Nash equilibria should have zero profit, otherwise
there will be miners quit from or join in the game. As such, at
the equilibria with stable M∗ miners in the pool, the condition
that P̃j(M∗) = 0,∀ j ∈ M∗ must be satisfied.
In the mempool, the arrival rate of a miner’s successful
mining λ j is greatly determined by the miners’ hashing
power, therefore, it is not exogenous. However, from the
perspective of the whole pool, the difficulty of mining
problem set by protocol infers an approximately exogenous
arrival rate of a new block as Λ. Thus, we have
Λ =
M∗
∑
j=1
λ j
=
e j
h j
H∗ (S+
N
∑
i=1
fi)−c j
We can say that Λ stays unchanged because more competitive
miners are accompanied with higher mining difficulty for
each miner, while less active miners will also reduce the
individual difficulty of mining.
B. Non-preemptive priority of transaction fee
Assume that a block consists of only one transaction.
The processing order of all users’ transactions is completely
dependent on transaction fee f . Users who do not pay trans-
action fees for miners to solve the computational problems
have the lowest priority. Sort all N users’ transaction fees
in a descending order, we have f1 >,...,> fk, ...,> fK . Thus,
there are K priorities for arriving transactions. A user with
the kth priority has non-preemptive priority over all users
with the k + 1th priority. Within a priority type, users are
served on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis.
Considering the flow-out of transactions in the mempool at
rate Λ. Users with kth priority submit transactions according
to a Poisson process with rate γk, thus the arrival rate of
mempool is Γ = ∑k γk. First, we analyze the stability of the
mempool. If the arrival rate of transactions Γ is greater than
the removing rate of transactions Λ, the size of the mempool
will grow infinitely. If Γ < Λ, the mempool will be stable in
the long run. The mean mempool size is
L =
Γ
Λ−Γ
Since users of each priority are independent Poisson flows,
the probability that a user arriving at any time belongs to
kth priority is γk/Γ. The average processing time of each
transaction can be computed as
s =
K
∑
k=1
γk
Γ
E(sk) =
1
Λ
1
Γ
K
∑
k=1
γk =
1
Λ
Furthermore, we have ρ = Γ/Λ < 1 representing the transac-
tion intensity in the mempool, and p0 = 1−ρ representing
the probability that the miners are all idle. According to
Little’s Law, the average time, including the waiting time
and processing time, for a user’s transactions being recorded
in the block can be given as
w = L/Γ =
1
Λ−Γ
and the waiting time is w = w− s.
In the stable mempool, we can see that the priority only
captures the change in the waiting time distributions but not
the average waiting time of all users. The waiting time of
high-priority users are shortened, while that of low-priority
users are prolonged. With the purpose of probing the influ-
ence of the non-preemptive priority on miners’ transaction
processing, we should compute the average waiting time wk
and numbers of users Lk at each priority. Since the waiting
time of users with highest priority will not be influenced
by other classes, thus w1 is the same under situations with
different γk,k = 2, ...,K. Therefore, we consider the special
case that γ2 = γ3 =, ...,γK = 0 to compute w1.
When a highest-priority user submits the transaction pro-
cessing request in the mempool, his waiting time is equal
to the sum of time for miners to solve the computational
116

problems for in-service users. Therefore, we have his waiting
time as:
w1 =
Γ
Λ2(1−ρ1)
where ρ1 = γ1/Λ. According to the Little’s Law, the waiting
users with the first priority is L1 = w1γ1.
Similarly, we can compute the average waiting time for
the users with kth priority as
wk =
Γ
Λ2(1−
k
∑
z=1
ρz)(1−
k−1
∑
i=z
ρz)
We have ρk = γk/Λ and Lk = wkγk. It is easy to find that
w1 < w2, ...,< wK .
From above, we can see that the waiting time of a
user depends heavily on the numbers of users with higher
priorities than himself/herself.
C. Users’ expected revenues
For the user i, only if his transaction is written to the
blockchain, the revenue vi can be generated. α i represents
the time cost on the delayed computational service provided
by miners. As such, the expected profit is formulated as:
Ri = vi − f i −α iwi
If the user does not pay transaction fee, he still will get the
revenue if the transaction is recorded to the blockchain, but
will be reduced by a long waiting time. If the user pays a
high enough transaction fee to get the first place, and his
transaction will be processed immediately after its arrival,
then his revenue will not be reduced by the time delay, but be
subtracted by the transaction fee. Therefore, the user should
make the trad-off between the cost and revenue from paying
the transaction fee.
D. Transaction queuing game
In this section, we investigate transaction fees in the
transaction queuing game played by users. In principle, the
game of N users has Nash equilibria for the reason that each
user has finite choices of transaction fees. Nash equilibria
can be realized under the cases that no users, all users and
a part of users pay transaction fees.
First, we consider the case that no users pay transaction
fees. That means there is no priority, which can happen when
the mempool size L is small enough and the average waiting
time w is very short. In this case, for a user i who pays
transaction fee fi to get the first place in the waiting queue,
his expected profit should be
Ri = vi − f i
So the Nash equilibria with no user paying transaction fee
exist if for any f i, there is
vi − f i < vi −α iw
That is, ∀ f i > 0, the following inequality holds in a stable
mempool,
f i
α i >
ρ
Λ(1−ρ)
Then, we analyze the case that all users pay transaction
fees. In this case, the volume of unconfirmed transactions in
the mempool should be large enough and the average waiting
time should be long enough, thus every user wants to pay the
transaction fee to move forward in the queue. In this case, a
user i who does not pay the transaction fee will be with the
lowest priority, his/her expected profit should be
Ri = vi −α iwK
So the Nash equilibria with all users paying transaction fees
exist if for any f i, there is
vi −α iwK < vi − f i −α iwK−1
That is, ∀ f i > 0, the following inequality holds in a stable
mempool,
f i
α i <
ρ(ρK−1 +ρK)
Λx
where,
x = (1−
K−2
∑
z=1
ρz)(1−
K−1
∑
z=1
ρz)(1−
K
∑
z=1
ρz)
There are two types of equilibria for this case: 1) all users pay
the same transaction fee, 2) users pay different transaction
fees.
Finally, we study the equilibria in case that only a part of
users pay transaction fees but others don’t. Those who do
not pay transaction fees will be at the lowest priority K, and
those who pay transaction fees will be at a certain priority
k ≤ K −1. According to the above analysis, we can get that
the Nash equilibria in this case should be achieved under the
condition that
ρ(ρK−1 +ρK)
Λx
≤ f i
α i ≤
ρ
Λ(1−ρ)
Under the Nash equilibria, no user can improve the expect-
ed profit through increasing or reducing transaction fees. If
the equilibrium transaction fee of the user i is f i∗ = fk, and
the waiting time should be wk, then the equilibrium profit
for him/her is
Ri∗ = vi − fk −α iwk
If he/she changes the transaction fee to access to priority k
′
,
k
′
= (0, ..,k−1,k+1, ...,K), the expected profit will be
Ri
k′
= vi − fk′ −α iwk′
Since Ri∗ ≥ Ri
k′
, calculations show that
fk − fk′ ≤ α i(wk′ −wk)
Thus, the Nash equilibria should satisfy the condition that
for each user, the increase (decrease) of the transaction fee
117

must be no more than the decrease (increase) of time cost
under the optimal transaction fee.
Consider the competitive user i
′
in the mempool, who is
with the k
′
th priority under the Nash equilibria. Similarly,
we have Ri
′∗ ≥ Ri
′
k , where
Ri
′∗ = vi
′
− fk′ −α i
′
wk′
Ri
′
k = vi
′
− fk −α i
′
wk
From the above two inequalities, we can get that
(α i
′
−α i)wk ≥ (α i
′
−α i)wk′
If k
′
> k, there is wk′ > wk, therefore, we have α i
′
≤ α i; and
if k
′
< k, there is wk′ < wk, therefore, we have α i
′
≥ α i. The
equilibria conditions indicate the trade-off between costs and
benefits from paying the transaction fee.
From the above analysis, there are five types of Nash
equilibria of the transaction queuing game shown in Figure
4:
• If f i > α iρ/Λ(1−ρ), ∀i, there is a the unique equilib-
rium in which no user pays the transaction fee;
• If f i < α iρ(ρK−1+ρK)/Λx, ∀i, there exist two types of
equilibria, in which all users pay the same transaction
fee or different transaction fees;
• If α iρ(ρK−1 +ρK)/Λx ≤ f i ≤ α iρ/Λ(1−ρ), ∀i, there
are two types of equilibria, in which are a part of users
pay the same transaction fee or different transaction
fees.
Fig. 4. Equilibria of transaction queuing game
Generally, the equilibrium transaction fees of all users are
determined by his/her waiting time and time cost.
The user’s waiting time is influenced not only by his/her
own transaction fee, but also the flow-in rate of competitive
users with higher transaction fees than him/her and the flow-
out rate of the mempool. The transaction fee determines the
user’s queue position thus his/her waiting time, and a higher
transaction fee will lead to a shorter waiting time. Also, the
flow-in rate of higher-priority users and the flow-out rate of
the mempool determine the queue length in front of him/her
and thus affect his/her waiting time. For the user, a higher
flow-in rate of higher-priority users’s transactions will lead
to a longer waiting time, and a higher flow-out rate will lead
to a shorter waiting time.
The time cost is endogenous and individual for the user.
For the impatient user with higher time cost, he may be
willing to offer a higher transaction fee to shorten the waiting
time which has also been validated in the research of Moser
et al. (2015)[11] through a longitudinal study. However, there
is no evidence that the transaction fee is influenced by the
transaction value.

It is known that dwi/d f i < 0. The marginal profit is deter-
mined by the fact that how long the waiting time is shorten
due to a certain amount of transaction fee.
As time goes by, the transactions flow-in rate increases
greatly as shown in Figure 5, but the flow-out rate does
not increase commensurately. As a result, the size of the
mempool with unconfirmed transactions keeps growing and
even clogs up in year 2017 (Figure 6). With the service
strength ρ grows, the waiting time for users is prolonged.
Since the average waiting time will not decrease, the contin-
uously growing ρ may result in a situation that the marginal
profits for some users with the low time cost α will turn
to be negative when the waiting time is over-long or even
divergent. Accordingly, in the equilibrium state, the users
with the enough high time cost will increase transaction fees
while those with the enough low time cost probably refuse to
offer transaction fees. Therefore, the continuous congestion
of the mempool may not produce over-high total transaction
fees. Also, if the scalability of Bitcoin block size is realized,
miners’ revenue from transaction fees may decrease, since
the average waiting time for all users will decrease.
IV. CONCLUSION
Transaction fees play a critical role for the stability and
vitality of the Bitcoin system. In this paper, we highlight
the critical role of transaction fees, and formulate the com-
putational service of miners for users as a queuing prob-
lem with non-preemptive priority completely determined by
transaction fees. Then, we investigate the problem through a
game-theoretical model, in which the miners’ mining rewards
and users’ time cost are emphasized. Also, we conducted
equilibrium analysis of the model, and find that there are five
types of Nash equilibria of the transaction queuing game. We
also find that the over-long waiting time caused by continued
congestions of the mempool may make some users with low
enough time cost give up paying transaction fees.
When a specific priority has a lot of users, the average
waiting time for them will not decrease significantly, instead,
the average waiting time for those who have lower and
no priority will be greatly prolonged. The practical Bitcoin
transactions in mempool are precisely in line with this
situation that most users pay transaction fees. Therefore,
in our ongoing work, we will probe the problem to take
more factors, including waiting time and transaction size into
consideration to explore the limited priority of transaction
fees.
Also, in the future, we will adopt ACP (Artificial systems
+ Computational experiments + Parallel execution) approach
[19], [20], [21], [22] to study the transaction fee problem in
Bitcoin blockchain. We will first construct an artificial Bit-
coin blockchain network, design computational experiments
in the artificial system, and then conduct parallel execution
bridging the real-world system and the artificial system to
make an in-depth research of the role and the influence of
transaction fees [23], [24].
