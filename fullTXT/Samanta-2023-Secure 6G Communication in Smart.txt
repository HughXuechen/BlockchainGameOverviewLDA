Abstract The next-generation cellular network will aim to overcome the existing 
Fifth Generation (5G) networks’ shortcomings. At the moment, academics and busi-
ness are concentrating their efforts on the Sixth Generation (6G) network. This 6G 
technology is expected to be the next great game-changer in the telecommunica-
tions sector. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the entire globe has turned to virtual 
meetings and live video interactions in various fields as healthcare, business, and 
education. We explore the most recent viewpoints and future technology trends that 
are most likely to drive 6G in this paper. The incorporation of blockchain in 6G, 
will allow the network to efficiently monitor and manage resource consumption and 
sharing. We explore the potential of blockchain for sharing in 6G utilizing a variety 
of application scenarios in the smart city. To strengthen security and privacy in 6G 
networks, we introduce potential difficulties and solutions with various 6G technolo-
gies. In addition, we examine the security and privacy issues that may arise as a result 
of the current 6G standards and prospective 6G uses. Overall, our study aims to give 
insightful direction for future 6G security and privacy research.

1 Introduction 
The 5G wireless communication standardization process is complete, and implemen-
tation has begun in several nations throughout the world. A variety of technologies 
can be developed to play important roles after the 6G research phase to achieve 
complete specifications for a 6G worldwide standard [1]. Major research efforts are 
now focused on quantum technologies, which will interact with 6G implementation. 
The architectural and performance components of the 6G mobile system are still 
mostly unknown. 
One of the goals of this research is to develop a new comprehensive, effective 
and coherent vision for a 6G-enabled Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) system. The 
6G IIoT system can be formed by the convergence of Information Communication 
Technology (ICT), Operational Technology (OT), and future 6G communications. 
The fact is that the 5G communication system is not yet complete but experts have 
already anticipated 6G mobile communication [2]. 
Blockchain is considered to be a crucial technology for 6G applications. 
Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that uses cryptography and hash func-
tions to construct a chain of data blocks that are created when an event happens 
and validated in a decentralized manner using consensus methods. Blockchain is 
currently being utilized in various application domains in smart cities, while it was 
previously exclusively used for cryptocurrency. In blockchain systems, the consensus 
is a critical feature that guarantees that all nodes agree on the network state. 6G can 
be utilized with communication-intensive techniques like Practical Byzantine Fault 
Tolerance (PBFT) if the system has to converge quickly. 
Our study focuses on the security of communication in smart city using integrated 
technology of 6G blockchain. The remaining paper is divided into parts. Section 2 
explains the literature review, while Sect. 3 presents 6G applications in the smart city. 
Section 4 discusses the 6G challenges and Sect. 5 presents discussions and future 
studies. Section 6 concludes our work. 
2 Literature Review 
There is so much considerable research that has been conducted on the security 
and privacy solution of 6G technology in recent years. We summarize some recent 
literature analyses and show how our approach differs from previous research. 
Alsharif et al. published a paper on the 6G wireless network in 2020. The authors 
of this paper focused on the most promising areas of research in common directions 
for the 6G project [3]. The authors of [4] highlight technologies that will help wireless 
networks advance to 6G, and which we see as enablers for a variety of 6G use cases. 
Another approach for emphasizing the major difficulties and potential in developing

Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output Surface (HMIMOS) enabled commu-
nications is discussed in [5]. In [6], the authors described the future 6G wireless 
communication vision and network design. 
In addition, the authors in [7] provided a system for delivering Distributed AI as a 
Service (DAIaaS) in the Internet of Everything (IoE) and 6G settings. The author of 
the paper [8] incorporates a comprehensive literature analysis of 6G, IoT, IoE, and 
IIoT to advance understanding and enable theory building. Similarly, the researchers 
of [9] proposed a new set of service classes, as well as corresponding 6G performance 
targets. 
The ideas mentioned above present a broad vision of the future for research and 
innovation in these fields. We propose a blockchain integrated 6G architecture with 
the best resource management and data sharing via smart contracts to manage data 
access in smart city networks. 
3  Application Area of 6G in Smart  City  
Most recent technologies and applications are being introduced in 6G with greater 
data speeds, high dependability, less latency, and secure transmission. The following 
sections will concentrate on a few of the most important 6G application fields 
recognized by the literature as shown in Fig. 1. At the same time, the security 
requirements for these application domains are strict. Here is a brief overview of 
the domain-specific security standards. 
3.1 Automation 
Automation, robotics, and autonomous systems are some of the topics studied by 
researchers. These technologies will be supported by 6G, which will allow direct 
communication between them. 6G will enable complete automation, including auto-
mated control processes, automated systems, and automated devices. Smart city plan-
ners can use blockchain to help them build an efficient transit network that allows 
people to check for and pay for services directly. The efficiency of public transit can 
be improved with smart mobility systems built on the blockchain. 
3.2 Industrial Applications 
In recent years, the integration of Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT), IoT, and intelligent devices has revolutionized manufacturing and produc-
tion systems Industrial IoT has changed the design of production units, transforming 
them from automated to autonomous [10]. 6G is a technique that is at the top of the
490 S. Samanta et al.

IIoT. The leaking of sensitive production information and the denial of access to a 
manufacturing device are two typical security attacks used in smart manufacturing 
systems. These security risks aim to interrupt either the manufacturing process or 
the production plan. 
3.3 Wireless Power Transfer 
Wireless Information and Energy Transport (WIET) is a revolutionary technology 
that will enable the creation of battery-free smart gadgets [11]. Traditional energy 
structures are centralized, fuel or coal-based. The wireless power transfer is a network 
of electricity generators, producers, and customers that is created by communication 
systems [12]. The primary goal of this system should be to ensure low-cost, and 
efficient energy transfer. WIET protection standards derive from domain-specific 
issues, including ensuring the integrity of data exchanged between power operators 
and customers.

3.4 Wireless Brain-Computer Interface 
Wearable gadgets have become more popular in recent years with brain-computer 
interface (BCI) applications. The brain will be able to connect using BCI technology, 
which processes and translate brain signals. Computing technologies will also be 
used in BCI, in which gadgets will work differently based on the user’s mood [13]. 
BCI application needs additional spectrum resources, a high data rate, extremely 
low latency, and excellent dependability. Five sense information transmissions will 
be supported by 6G, which will transport data created by the human’s five senses, 
allowing interaction with the environment [14]. 
3.5 Healthcare 
Health services have begun to adopt innovations to make healthcare more efficient and 
accurate. Such smart healthcare systems must deal with computational and security 
issues. Blockchain technology has several applications in smart healthcare. In this 
regard, blockchain will solve data protection, data confidentiality, accountability 
problems. 6G will enable the complete existence of remote surgeries through robotics, 
automation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) [15]. Tera Hertz (THz) band’s short 
wavelength facilitates communication and the creation of nano sensors, enabling the 
development of novel nanosized devices that can function inside the human body 
[16]. 
3.6 Underwater Communication 
The underwater environment is unpredictable and difficult. Due to the significant 
attenuation of radio signals in saltwater, auditory communication is the only alterna-
tive for communication. The velocity and density variations in the water make node 
movement problematic [17]. Underwater sensors are costly, and they are intended to 
resist the harsh conditions of the ocean. It needs powerful transceivers and a huge 
memory. Because solar power cannot be used, the power source must be big. Optical 
fiber is the greatest option, but it is also the most expensive. 6G must overcome the 
obstacles of underwater conditions to provide effective underwater communication. 
4 6G Communication Challenges in Smart City 
The deployment of 5G technology has just recently begun and there is no user expe-
rience on 5G. The 5G should experience many things in a real-world scenario rather
492 S. Samanta et al.
Fig. 2 6G communication challenges in smart cities 
than in a laboratory [18]. Some challenging criteria in 6G wireless communication 
must be met to global technological demands shown in Fig. 2. The main challenging 
problems are analyzed and discussed in this part. 
4.1 Lack of Technology 
The 6G claims to deliver many promises, however, it is hampered by a lack of genuine 
technologies. The needs grow dramatically from 5 to 6G mobile communications. 
People have little experience with 5G technology, therefore a lack of 5G user expe-
riences is a major concern. To accomplish 6G, significant changes to 5G technology 
are necessary. To progress 6G, AI must be integrated into 5G technology. 
4.2 Over Expectation from 5G 
Before creating 6G technology, problems with 5G must be resolved. Furthermore, 
5G is primarily a campus-based solution that does not enable high mobility. Satellite
Secure 6G Communication in Smart City Using Blockchain 493
communication can help with high mobility, but it is highly expensive and beyond 
the reach of many people. Although there is no defined path for providing low-cost 
access to solve the problem. 
4.3 THz Band 
The THz band is the major issue in the 6G technology. The high data speeds and 
high frequencies will overcome the high path loss. To solve the problem of frequency 
dispersion, new multipath channel models must be created. Existing modulation and 
coding techniques are insufficient for the THz band [19]. Thus, developing new 
modulation and coding techniques is a difficult task. Furthermore, the researchers 
face significant health and safety problems as a result of the high power and frequency. 
4.4 Device Capabilities 
All wireless communication methods were not compatible with all devices. Industries 
have just begun developing 5G equipment, which should be able to handle 6G as 
well. Smartphones are consuming far more energy than in the past. Wireless energy 
transfer methods should be designed to enable multiple charging ways. 
4.5 Network Security 
Smart devices, AI, smart cities, and satellites will be connected via the 6G wireless 
communications network [20]. The security approaches applied in 5G will not suffi-
cient in 6G. Thus, new security strategies based on creative cryptographic methods 
should be explored. 
5 Discussion and Future Direction 
This section gives an overview of issues, precautions, and potential research 
directions of blockchain and 6G integrated smart city applications as shown in 
Table 1. 
The path to 6G is undoubtedly long, and the existing 5G will continue to improve. 
6G will be a revolution rather than an evolution. Blockchain may be used to imple-
ment network security, surveillance, accountability, and governance. 6G networks 
must address the security concerns raised by innovative 6G applications. Blockchain 
systems can provide the highest level of security.

With various combinations of computer science and telecommunication research, 
it will be fascinating to look into the commercial implications of the many options 
available when adopting IoE. Furthermore, it is still unclear how edge, fog, and cloud 
technologies should be distributed and used in diverse areas. Intelligent Transporta-
tion Systems (ITS) will likely be one of the most important applications to emerge 
in the next decade. 
6 Conclusions 
We explored the possibilities of blockchain and 6G for securing smart city commu-
nication. To make the relationship clearer, we have split 6G application needs into 
performance and security categories. We have demonstrated how blockchain’s fully 
decentralized nature makes it easier to manage 6G networks with complicated struc-
tures. We listed the active 6G research projects that are mostly related to security 
and privacy. Furthermore, security-related concerns of 6G applications might be 
easily handled by selecting the right blockchain type and consensus methods. The 
combination of blockchain with 6G may enable safe and pervasive communication.
