Abstract: Advancements in sensor-enabled devices led to the emergence of resource trading models
for smart communities, such as the smart marketplace (SMP). Most of the proposed SMP architectures
are based on blockchain technology, which has a public ledger to achieve transparency. Consequently,
safeguarding the participant’s anonymity, untraceability, and transactional data privacy during
trading becomes a challenging task. Most of the existing solutions to achieve anonymity are based on
multiple account mapping, which is prone to identity-based attacks, and cryptographic techniques
are used to achieve transactional data privacy, which often has a high computational overhead. In
this work, we propose a lightweight privacy-enabled message exchange mechanism to accomplish
our privacy goals in a blockchain-based SMP. Evaluation of the scheme was conducted to measure
its resilience toward safeguarding participants’ anonymity, untraceability, and transactional data
privacy during trading cycles. Statistical game theory-based security analysis and simulation based
performance analysis of the proposed scheme showed that it achieved the desired privacy goals with
a low computational overhead compared with existing state-of-the-art schemes.

1. Introduction
Increasing demand for resources in smart communities has prompted researchers to
develop resource trading solutions in the form of the SMP [1,2]. The SMP is the result
of advancements in network innovation, using sensor-enabled devices in smart homes
to facilitate trade and the exchange of resources such as water, internet bandwidth and
energy among the participants of a smart community. Most of the recently proposed
SMP architectures are based on blockchain technology [3,4]. The blockchain is based on
a public ledger and communication transparency between participants, which allow any
participant to access information regarding transaction history, events and actions taking
place in the SMP. Due to this very feature of the blockchain, ensuring privacy preservation
of the participants becomes a challenging task, as participants may suffer from disclosure
of confidential information, such as a participant’s identity and details of the executed
transactions [5].
Privacy parameters with respect to the participant are classified into two categories:
(1) preservation of the participant’s anonymity and untraceability, making the participant’s
identity unknown and untraceable, and (2) preservation of transactional data by hiding
the transaction details of the participant [3–5]. Various techniques have been proposed to
achieve these privacy parameters in an SMP that includes the use of multiple accounts
and a Merkle tree [6,7] to achieve anonymity and untraceability for the participants. Cryp-
tographic approaches such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures Algorithm (ECDSA)

and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) have been used to provide transactional data pri-
vacy [5,6,8]. The Bitmessage [9] method of decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) message
authentication and delivery based on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm was
adopted by many approaches, such as those in [6,10], to provide anonymity in a trustless
network by broadcasting encrypted messages in messaging streams.
With respect to the use of the above approaches to accomplish the desired privacy parame-
ters in a blockchain-based SMP, the following issues and limitations have been identified:
• The use of multiple accounts and Merkle trees, as in [6,7], is not very successful against
blockchain analysis and other similar techniques [1,2,11]. Thus, they can be used to
link multiple accounts of a participant to infer the participant’s identity. On the other
hand, the implementation of a Merkle tree in a blockchain-based network, such as the
Ethereum network, may inevitably require a large-scale computing resource [12].
• Cryptographic approaches, such as the ECDSA and ECC [5,6,8], utilizes time-consuming
procedures, such as bilinear pairings [13,14]. The process may lead to high compu-
tational and storage overheads, thus posing practical problems due to the resource
constraint nature of the smart gateway in smart homes [15–17].
• Instead of using an encryption method that often makes the content of the encrypted
blocks mutually dependent, Bitmessage encrypts each block individually. Through
this, the adversary will be able to rearrange the message blocks in such a way that
the recipient can interpret it as a legitimate message [18]. With this, the adversary can
infer the transactional data stored in the blocks as well as identify the participants
involved in the transactions.
The situation is further aggravated when one takes into account the type of trading
mechanism used in the SMP. The trading approaches may allow a participant to have only
a single (one-to-one) or multiple (one-to-many) simultaneous transactions. The objective
of this work is to ensure the anonymity and untraceability of the participant and provide
transactional data privacy under a one-to-many trading model. To achieve these goals,
a novel lightweight scheme is presented that utilizes a pair of public/private IDs with
anonymous messaging streams. Security analysis and experimental evaluation of the
proposed solution is performed to evaluate and compare it against existing state-of-the-
art schemes.
Contributions: The following are the contributions of this paper:
• A protocol is presented to ensure the participant’s anonymity and untraceability
during one-to-many trading in the SMP, using public/private pairs of communicating
sessional IDs.
• A protocol is also presented to ensure privacy preservation of the transactional data of
the participants during one-to-many trading in the SMP at a reduced computational
overhead.
• Our results show that the proposed system is more resilient against identity-based
attacks such as blockchain analysis attacks and achieves a lower probability of success
of the adversary compared with that in [6,7] with a reduced computational overhead.
Organization of the Paper: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 pro-
vides an overview of the related work. In Section 3, we present the system model. Section 4
describes the proposed security protocol. Section 5 discusses the security analysis. Section 6
explains the experimental analysis and results, and Section 7 presents the conclusions.
2. Related Work
Recently the use of the blockchain for the development of P2P resource trading models
in SMPs has attracted huge attention [1]. Several approaches, such as those in [19–29],
were proposed to realize participants’ anonymity and transactional data privacy in SMPs.
An account mapping technique was used in [21] to prevent attackers from directly accessing
transactional data. In this method, the characteristics of both active and inactive users’
accounts can be effectively obscured by creating multiple accounts. Similarly, in [22], it was
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 3 of 16
proposed to protect the privacy of participants by dividing them into various groups. Then,
a miner is chosen among the group members to collect data from the group and add them
into the community’s private blockchain. This process protects the participant’s data from
leaking to other participants in the network. However, recent works [1,2,11] have shown
that, using a detailed analysis process [11], multiple public addresses and accounts can be
connected to infer and expose the identity of the participants in blockchain-based networks.
One such method is known as blockchain analysis, where transactions, addresses and entity
graphs are used to expose the true identites of blockchain users [1].
Some techniques [6,8,30] use elliptic curve-based security mechanisms, such as ECC
and the ECDSA, to preserve the privacy of participants and enable them to anonymously
trade with each other. These schemes protect participants against attacks such as address
reuse, Sybil, inferential and collusive attacks. However, the techniques presented in [6,8]
can be subjected to 51 percent attacks, high latency due to a long block generation time and
other mining issues. In another approach [7], a participant, such as a resource buyer, uses
digital currencies to generate multiple accounts and preserve the mapping information to
avoid tracking. It also involves the use of a Merkle tree [12] to create a large pool of key
pairs and achieve high anonymity. However, this approach may be prone to a blockchain
analysis attack, and the implementation of Merkle trees in a blockchain-based network,
such as the Ethereum network, can be computationally costly, which can slow down the
execution of trading transactions. Therefore, there is a need to come up with a more scalable
solution that will provide user anonymity, untraceability and transactional data privacy in
the resource trading environment of SMPs. Table 1 summarizes some of the most recent
and relevant research conducted in this domain.

3. System Model
This section discusses our system models, including the network model and trading
model. Moreover, it presents the security requirements and the threat model.
3.1. Network Model
The SMP has a temper-proof smart gateway, referred to here as the Smart Market
Gateway (SmGW), that is connected with several participating smart homes within the
smart community through their respective temper-proof sensor-enabled smart gateways.
Each smart home gateway in the SMP is presumed to be registered and authenticated as a
trusted member via the SmGW. A smart home in the SMP can take part in resource trading
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 4 of 16
either as a resource provider (ProGW), resource requester (ReqGW) or both, as depicted in
Figure 1. The system is based on private Ethereum blockchain technology accessible by the
connected smart gateways, which are presumed to be computationally capable. Thus, it is
assumed that all SMP participants have direct access to Ethereum smart contracts through
the network, and each participant uses separate Ethereum accounts (EAs) to participate
in the SMP. As a result, they can be identified by their Ethereum addresses (public keys)
in the network. In addition, all participants have direct access to the public ledger of the
blockchain, where all transactions are recorded and can be retrieved.
Figure 1. System model.
3.2. Trading Model
In Figure 1, three entities are involved in each transaction: the requester gateway
(ReqGW), provider gateway (ProGW) and Smart Market Gateway (SmGW). ProGWj, being
the resource supplier (seller), first feeds the amount of the resource (e.g., energy) it is
willing to sell out to the SMP resource chamber, such as the smart grid (energy grid),
via a transmission channel. ProGWj then broadcasts the offerings anonymously to the
blockchain auction board, also including the price, volume (amount), unit and type of the
resource to be sold. ReqGWi, being the potential resource requester (buyer), receives the
copy of ProGWj’s broadcasted message. If ReqGWi selects ProGWj as the potential supplier,
then it sends a trading negotiation message to the respective ProGWj to initiate the trading
negotiation process. After the successful negotiation, ReqGWi releases the agreed price,
and the resource is released by ProGWj, thereby completing the trading activity.
3.3. Privacy Requirements
In the context of the presented network and trading model, it is desired that the
following two requirements regarding a participant’s privacy should be accomplished:
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 5 of 16
• Participant’s anonymity and untraceability: Protect the identities of participants and make
them untraceable in the SMP. Their identities should be protected from identity-related
attacks, such as address reuse, Sybil and blockchain analysis attacks during trading
in the SMP.
• Transactional data privacy: Ensure protection against transactional data privacy attacks,
such as inferential attacks and data leakage.
3.4. Threat Model
In this work, we consider the following features for the adversary A:
• The adversary A has the ability to influence the means of communication of the SMP
and to intercept all messages transmitted between the smart gateways.
• The adversary A has the ability to capture all of the session IDs in the SMP.
• A has the ability to launch identity-related attacks and transactional data privacy at-
tacks.
• It was assumed that the smart gateways are temper-proof and therefore cannot
be compromised.
• We assumed that the adversary cannot compromise the blockchain.
4. Anonymity, Untraceability and Transactional Data Privacy (AUT) Protocol
A secure protocol to achieve a participant’s anonymity, untraceability and transac-
tional data privacy in the SMP is presented in this section. Note that the anonymity,
untraceability and transactional data privacy solutions in this work were provided during
trading activities between participants. Thus, the protocol ensured the desired privacy pa-
rameters independent of the type of trading model (one-to-one or one-to-many) used in the
SMP. In order to establish trusted message streams among the participants, a lightweight
Bitmessage (L-Bitmessage) technique was adopted. This technique uses cryptographic
proof-of-authority (PoA) and the sped up Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem
along with a Chinese reminder theorem (CRT) for the encryption or decryption processes.
The RSA cryptosystem is a commonly used public key cryptosystem for secure data trans-
fers [31,32]. Additionally, it is one of the oldest. The proposed protocol is presented in
Algorithm 1, and the workflow is depicted in Figure 2. Similarly, Table 2 provides a brief
description of the important notations used in this work.

Figure 2. Proposed Anonymity and transactional data Privacy protection protocol operation flow
During the first stage in Figure 2, both ProGWj and ReqGWi create new pair of176
session IDs (MSIDProGWPub , MSIDProGWPrv) and (MSIDReqGWPub
,177
MSIDReqGWPrv
) respectively from their original pair of public/private keys at the be-178
ginning of each trading activities in the system. The IDs are used to represent ProGWj179
and ReqGWi respectively during trading activities. The IDs are sessional; therefore, they180
are discarded after one complete trading transactions session. Both ProGW and ReqGW181
public pair session ID are generally chosen to be of relatively small prime values of182
low hamming weight owing to ensure speedup in encryption process with a negligible183
computing overhead. Thus, the ProGWj and ReqGWi remains anonymous under the184
pseudonyms of MSIDProGwPub and MSIDReqGwPub
respectively as well as untraceable185
without revealing their true identities (public keys). As depicted from line 1 to 13 of186
the Algorithm-1, the ProGWj send a transaction (TBroadcast) to broadcast its bids anony-187
mously in the auction board as in Equation (1) which also include the ProGWj’s public188
ID (MSIDProGwPub), the block timestamp and nonce.189

From the second stage of Figure 2 and line 14 to 18 of Algorithm-1, the ReqGWi190
selects ProGWj’s ID as the potential supplier, and then encrypts a negotiation message191
using the chosen public ID of the potential ProGWj and then broadcast it anonymously192
in the blockchain network. This is achieved by encrypting the message with ProGWj’s193
ID (MSIDProGwPub ) as:194
MSIDProGWPub(MSIDReqGWPub

Where ωi is the request message, Ti is the block timestamp and MSIDReqGWPub
195
is the ReqGWi public ID. ReqGWi identity remains anonymous behind a pseudonym196
Figure 2. Proposed Anonymity and transactional data privacy protection protocol operation flow.
During the first stage in Figure 2, both ProGWj and ReqGWi create new pairs of
session IDs (MSIDProGWPub , MSIDProGWPrv) and (MSIDReqGWPub
, MSIDReqGWPrv
), respec-
tively, from their original pairs of public and private keys at the beginning of each trading
activity in the system. The IDs are used to represent ProGWj and ReqGWi during trading
activities. The IDs are sessional, and therefore, they are discarded after one complete trad-
ing transaction session. Both the ProGW and ReqGW public pair session IDs are generally
chosen to be of relatively small prime values and of low hamming weights to ensure speed-
ing up of the encryption process with a negligible computing overhead. Thus, ProGWj and
ReqGWi remain anonymous under the pseudonyms of MSIDProGwPub and MSIDReqGwPub
,
respectively, as well as untraceable without revealing their true identities (public keys).
As depicted from line 1 to 13 of Algorithm 1, ProGWj sends a transaction (TBroadcast) to
broadcast its bids anonymously in the auction board as in Equation (1), which also includes
ProGWj’s public ID (MSIDProGwPub), the block timestamp and the nonce:
TBroadcast = MSIDProGwPub ‖ Type ‖ Volume ‖
Price ‖ Timestamp ‖ Nonce ‖ Unit
(1)
In the second stage of Figure 2 and from line 14 to 18 in Algorithm 1, ReqGWi selects
ProGWj’s ID as the potential supplier and then encrypts a negotiation message using
the chosen public ID of the potential ProGWj before broadcasting it anonymously in
the blockchain network. This is achieved by encrypting the message with ProGWj’s ID
(MSIDProGwPub ) as follows:
MSIDProGWPub(MSIDReqGWPub
, ωi, Ti) = φi (2)
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 7 of 16
where ωi is the request message, Ti is the block timestamp and MSIDReqGWPub
is ReqGWi’s
public ID. ReqGWi’s identity remains anonymous behind a pseudonym MSIDReqGWPub
. How-
ever, its important to note that each time a message is broadcasted in the system, a validating
authority (node) validates the message and adds it to the blockchain based on the proof-of-
authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. With this, the encrypted message is published in the
blockchain network, where all participant nodes will receive a copy of the package. In the
third stage of Figure 2 and line 20 in Algorithm 1, only ProGWj, which has the right private
ID, will be able to decrypt the message:
MSIDProGwPrv(φi) = ωi, Ti, MSIDReqGwPub

In the fourth through sixth stage of Figure 2 and from line 21 to 37 of Algorithm 1,
acknowledgement reply and payment messages are encrypted and decrypted accordingly
to ensure speedy transmission of transactional messages in a secure and private manner at
both sides of ProGWj and ReqGWi with a relatively low overhead until the trading activities
are concluded. A new trading activity begins again with both ProGWj and ReqGWi, creating
new IDs from their public and private keys as depicted in stage one-B in Figure 2, which
marks the beginning of the next trading session.
5. Security Analysis
Motivated by [32], blockchain-based game theory has been developed, comprising
an adversary A and a challenger C in order to evaluate participant P ’s anonymity and
untraceability. It is assumed that C knows the assigned addresses (public keys) of the
blockchain users. The adversary A chooses an ID α0 from the set of public pairs of the
session IDs that were used in the SMP within a given time frame ∆, for which the adversary
has no prior knowledge (conveyed in ρA), and submits it to C. Then, C chooses an arbitrary
bit δ evenly. If δ = 1, then C selects another ID α1 arbitrarily from the SMP, where α0
and α1 belong to the same participant; otherwise, C arbitrarily chooses α1 so that the two
IDs belong to different participants. C directs {α0, α1} to A, which replies with his or her
estimate δ
′
for whether the two IDs are owned by the same participant. A wins the game if
he or she responds appropriately (i.e., δ = δ
′
).
5.1. Anonymity and Untraceability
Proposition 1. The system achieves (preserves) P ’s anonymity and untraceability if for an ad-
versary A and ∀{α0, α1}, in a probabilistic polynomial time, A has only at most an insignificant
advantage over Aτ to win; that is, this is true if
Prob[δ
′ ← A(SMP, ρA, α0, α1) : δ = δ
′
]−
Prob[δ
′ ← Aτ(ρA, α0, α1) : δ = δ
′
] ≤ ε,
(4)
where Aτ is an adversary that reacts to all game difficulties with statistical inferences and ε is the
difference in probabilities for the adversary A, which is insignificant with respect to the security
parameter ρ.
Proof. The proposed approach leverages the E-Bitmessage process during the course of
communication in the SMP. Thus, the pair of session IDs is changed every time a session
starts, therefore being used once and discarded. Hence, this makes it to almost impossible
forA to reply with a correct estimate δ
′
. As a result,A has no or a less significant advantage
over Aτ to win the game. Thus, changing the session IDs for each connection improves
the security in terms of perfect forward secrecy [10]. This implies that even if the private
pair of the session IDs gets stolen by any means, such as correlation of the public pair of
the session IDs in the SMP, not only are past communications still secure, but all following
communications will also be secure. This feature strengthens and ensures transactional
data privacy in the system.
All pairs of IDs only last for one trading session. However, encryption always needs
the public key of the recipient, as well as decryption always needing the decryptor’s private
key. Unlike the public/private pairs of the session IDs, the original private/public key
pairs are never dropped. Thus, even if the adversary is able to obtain one single ID out of
the communication, it will neither be able to read messages from the past nor upcoming
messages at a probabilistic polynomial time.
Theorem 1. If anonymity and untraceability are achieved (preserved) for a given participant P ,
then it is presumed that the adversary A cannot be able to launch any identity-related attacks.
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 9 of 16
Proof. (By contradiction) Assuming that A is able to launch any of the aforementioned
attacks even when the participants are anonymous and untraceable, this implies that for all
adversaries A and ∀{α0}, A has a significant advantage over Aτ to win the game at a
probabilistic polynomial time, even though the system has satisfied transactional data
privacy, anonymity and untraceability for the participant P . This statement contradicts
Proposition 1. Hence, Theorem 1 holds.
Theorem 2. The participants’ anonymity and untraceability offered by the proposed blockchain-
based approach can be realized by measuring the degree to which the public pair of session IDs in the
SMP can be linked to a particular address (public key) of a given participant.
Proof. This can be achieved by computing the estimate of A using an nAXnA matrix
and Etrack, where Etrack[i, j] = {Probi,j}, i, j ∈ [1, nA]. Then, the attacker A calculates the
probability Probi,j for which, in every ID αi, a given αi belongs to the same participant as
every αi in the SMP. However, Etrack also consists of extra information that can be extracted
from the SMP by A. This can be accomplished by means of statistical analysis or any other
processes. Furthermore, the success of A in the game can be computed as follows.
Given the actual ID correlation matrix ACMtrack, then ACMtrack = 1 if αi and αj are
of the same participant; otherwise, ACMtrack = 0, ∀i, j ∈ [1, nA]. Moreover, for each αi,
the error in A’s estimate can be calculated by taking the distance of Etrack[i, ∗] from the
actual ID correlation of αi with other IDs in the SMP:
‖ Etrack[i, ∗]− ACMtrack[i, ∗] ‖, (5)
where ‖ . ‖ implies the L1 rule of the corresponding row matrix.
Therefore, the success ofA in the game SucA can be computed viaA’s maximum error:
max∀αi∈ρA(‖ Etrack[i, ∗]− ACMtrack[i, ∗] ‖). (6)
Equally, the estimate of Aτ for all possible pairs of IDs can be represented in the game
by the nAXnA matrix Eτ
track, given as
Eτ [i, j] = ϑi,j. (7)
If α0, α1 ∈ ρA, then
Eτ
track[i, j] = γ + (1− γ)1/2. (8)
where ϑi,j denotes the probability that IDs α0 and α1 imply the same participant given
ρA, while γ denotes the fraction of IDs that cannot be correlated with other IDs. How-
ever, the probability of other IDs not included in ρA is given as 1/2(1 + γ), which is the
probability that one of the following occurs:
1. α0 is the only ID of its owner;
2. Aτ was not successful in guessing δ.
Thus, with this, the degree of achievement of P ’s anonymity and untraceability
features can be measured by evaluating the extra success recorded by A in the SMP
compared with that of Aτ . This success is computed as
SuccessA = (SucA − SucAτ /SucAτ ). (9)
while failure is computed as
FailureA = 1− (SucA − SucAτ /SucAτ ). (10)

5.2. Transactional Data Privacy
To achieve faster encryption and decryption processes for transactional data privacy,
RSA cryptosystem speedup techniques [33] were used. The decryption process is achieved
using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), while the encryption process is achieved by
choosing a very small value for the public ID. The objective is to provide a fast, secure and
lighter cryptographic approach to the IoT-based resource-constraining devices for their
transactional data privacy:
Proposition 2. A secure encryption process can be accomplished with a relatively low prime value
for a public ID e while at the same time achieving absolute speeding up of the entire process for
data transactions.
Remark 1. The use of such public IDs, particularly those with a number of ones in binary represen-
tation (low hamming weight) such as e = 3, e = 17 and e = 216 + 1, can result in a low number of
exponentiation operations, thus speeding up the encryption process [33].
Proof. For a given encryption or decryption process, the RSA bit length of the modulus
n is given as t + 1 (i.e., [log2 n] = t + 1), where t is some integers. Therefore, the private
ID d does not have its complete bit length of t + 1 yet, even with small value for e. As a
result, the RSA cryptosystem is still secure with these short public keys, as described in
Proposition 2.
Proposition 3. A secure decryption speeding up process with a factor of four can be achieved using
the CRT technique.
Remark 2. In CRT exponentiation, all associated values (i.e., dp, dq, xp and xq) are bounded by
p and q and also have a bit length almost equal to t/2 bits, where p and q are prime figures, x is
the base element and d is the decryption exponent. If the square-and-multiply method is used to
compute two exponentiations, then each requires an average of 1.5t/2 modular multiplications and
squarings. In total, the number of modular multiplications and squarings is given as [33]
SQ + MULT = 2× 1.5t/2 = 1.5t. (11)
Proof. The CRT version of decryption requires both primes p and q as well as the de-
cryption exponent d, so this may seem to be an extra source of insecurity. Nevertheless,
factoring in the modulus n may be easy if the decryption exponent d is given, and therefore
no security is lost while using this technique.
From Equation (11), we can observe that the computational complexity is the same
with regular exponentiation without the CRT. Nevertheless, all the values associated with
the process have t/2 bits, which contrasts with operation without the CRT, where t bit
variables are computed for each multiplication. In a nutshell, it can be observed that the
complexity of the multiplication increases quadratically with the increase in the bit length.
As a result, each t/2 bit multiplication is four times faster than a t bit multiplication.
6. Experimental Analysis and Results
In this section we have selected the benchmark models of Aitzhan et al. [6] and Dorri
et al. [7] based on contextual resemblance and the state of the art, while the model from
Folha et al. [30] was based on similitude and recency to our proposed model.
The efficiency of our proposed approach was compared with that of the benchmark
models in terms of the success of A in discovering the participant’s anonymity and un-
traceability in the SMP. All of these studies provided blockchain-based solutions in which
interactions were based on transactions. These experiments were executed on the Ethereum
blockchain, where all interactions are handled as transactions which can be quantified in
terms of Ethereum gas per unit transaction.
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 11 of 16
Similarly, the efficacy of the chosen speeding up RSA cryptographic process at provid-
ing transactional data privacy was examined and compared to that of the standard RSA
cryptographic process.
6.1. Experimental Set-Up
The experimental environment was built using the Solidity language. All the partic-
ipants’ smart gateways were defined during our implementation as mappings from the
Ethereum addresses of the participating smart homes. In addition, the Ethereum address of
the SmGW was also initialized. Twenty different authorized participants and their trading
transactions were considered in the SMP to measure the success of A in the game against
Aτ . Furthermore, we evaluated the success of A in recovering the public IDs of the partici-
pants in the proposed approach and the other base approaches in [6,7,30]. We also analyzed
the trading transaction messages to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
at achieving transactional data privacy. The messages were encrypted and decrypted using
both the traditional RSA and the sped up RSA, each of which was enabled in the approach
for separate scenarios.
Across our tests, we replicated a simulation scenario to consider both the limited infor-
mation and no information situations. In the limited information situation, we assumed
that A was aware of the position or delivery of all SMP participants and, as such, could
determine if a transaction was rendered in return for traded resources. In this scenario,
we had both the IDs of the provider and requester in the prior knowledge of A while
processing SuccessA. In the no information situation, we assumed a situation where A
did not know the position or operation of all participants and, as such, did not have any
previous information but believed that some trading transactions took place between some
participants in the network.
6.2. Evaluating the Success of A at Discovering Participant’s Anonymity and Untraceability in
the SMP
We analyzed the metrics SuccessA for the benchmark approaches [6,7,30] to check
for the performance of A in exposing the participant’s session ID with respect to our E-
Bitmessage-based approach. The results in Figure 3 show that the probability of A’s failure
in our approach was more pronounced compared with that in [6,7,30]. This shows that
the degree of achievement of P ’s anonymity and untraceability could be observed with
high probability (0.848 on average) in our approach. Hence, the results confirm the claim
made in Proposition 1 and Theorem 1.
Furthermore, it can be observed that there was no definite trend in Figure 3 with
respect to the increasing number of participants. This was due to the fact that the system at
a given time instance ∆ was composed of multiple participants, each carrying a different
number of trading transactions with a different number of parties (trading activities). Thus,
the computational complexities applied to each participant during the trading activities
depends on the number of activities carried out by that participant at the given time instance.
For instance, participant 9, which had fewer trading activities (having two trading sessions)
at given time instance ∆, would have a lower computational overhead as well as the lowest
probability of A’s success compared with participant 16 with the most trading activities
(having eight trading sessions) at a given time instance ∆. In a nutshell, the findings show
that the fewer trading activities a participant P has, the lower the computational complexity
applied to it, and the lower the probability of A’s success is with it.
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 12 of 16
Figure 3. Probability of success recorded by A in the SMP.
To have a better understanding of the trend in the results, they are further summarized
in Table 3, which is based on the sample of 20 participants categorized in an increasing
order of five groups. The table shows that A had a negligible effect on the participants
when using our approach, with an average efficiency of around 15% in terms of linking
IDs to their correct owners. Similarly, it can be seen that the adversary exceeded Aτ for the
groups of Aitzhan et al. [6], Dorri et al. [7] and Folha et al. [30] by an average of about 75%,
68% and 53%, respectively, in the overall system. In addition, it can be realized that the
success of A increased slightly as the fraction of the participants increased in our approach.
The above disparities may result from the fact that Bitmessage users may add a little noise
to the blockchain log during transactions. Similarly, it can be seen from Table 3 that the
values in [6,7,30] were close to one. This implies thatA performed much better thanAτ and
that the approximation selected by A was near a valid address linking to the appropriate
participants. Thus, we infer that the anonymity of blockchain users can still be breached
even though users manually generate new addresses to keep their addresses from being
linked together.
Table 3. Results for A’s success per group of participants in the system.
Groups of Participants 1–5 6–10 11–15 16–20
AUT-Protocol 0.12 ± 0.01 0.13 ± 0.01 0.19 ± 0.01 0.17 ± 0.02
Aitzhan et al. [6] 0.76 ± 0.01 0.72 ± 0.02 0.81 ± 0.01 0.73 ± 0.02
Dorri et al. [7] 0.67 ± 0.01 0.68 ± 0.02 0.66 ± 0.01 0.71 ± 0.02
Folha et al. [30] 0.52 ± 0.01 0.51 ± 0.02 0.56 ± 0.01 0.53 ± 0.02
In addition, our findings demonstrate that the benefit of A over Aτ was not substan-
tially influenced in the proposed approach by the number of SMP participants. This is
because of the explanations given in Proposition 1 and Theorem 1. However, the findings
demonstrate that the benefit of A in [6,7,30] increased equally as the number of partici-
pants rose. This is mostly attributed to the assumption that as the number of participants
rises, the allocation of addresses to the appropriate participants becomes absolute due
to a blockchain analysis attack. However, it is important to note that the system allows
a participant P to execute O2M trading transactions at the same time. Therefore, it is
probable for a participant to be present concurrently in two or more transactions.

6.3. Achieving Fast Encryption and Decryption for Transactional Data Privacy
Figures 4 and 5 provide the encryption and decryption times for a message observed
for each participant in the SMP, respectively. The average encryption time for the proposed
approach was 0.0095 s, while it was 0.1322, 0.1376 and 0.028 s for the approaches in [6,7,30],
respectively. Similarly, the average decryption time of the proposed approach was 0.010 s,
while for the approaches in [6,7,30], it was 0.029, 0.051 and 0.0176 s, respectively. This
shows that the speedup factor of the proposed scheme was approximately 14 for encryption
and 3.5 for decryption when compared with the results in [6,7,30].

6.4. Security and Privacy Comparison
To summarize, Table 4 compares the proposed AUT protocol to two previously existing
schemes from Aitzhan et al. [6], Dorri et al. [7] and Folha et al. [30]. We used the words
“Yes” and “No” to indicate whether or not a scheme fulfilled the security and privacy
Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 2914 14 of 16
requirements that were evaluated. As can be seen in the Table, none of the schemes in [6,7]
ensured the privacy of a participant’s data throughout the data transfers.
Similarly, the table illustrates that the schemes in [6,7,30] failed to ensure the confiden-
tiality of participant data in blockchain network applications. Finally, as shown before in
this work, the schemes in [6,7,30] could not guarantee participant anonymity or untrace-
ability. Additionally, recent studies have revealed flaws in the approaches used in these
schemes [1]. Nonetheless, the proposed AUT protocol passed all of the considered security
and privacy criteria in this work.

6.5. Limitations of This Study
This study has two major limitations regarding its scalability. The first is that a smaller
sample size was used to assess the proposed model. The second refers to the blockchain’s
architectural design. In the context of resource trade, malicious behavior is multifaceted
and impacted by a number of circumstances. In the future, there will be a greater focus on
participant behavior related to trust throughout the trading cycle in a blockchain network
setting. Determining the characteristics that influence user behavior on blockchain-based
trading platforms is another topic for future research that has been investigated. In addition,
the influence of the proposed model on human behavior in a big trading environment
can only be shown if the model’s basic functions and components are technically possible.
The major limitation of blockchain technology is its scalability. As generic solutions for
improving the scalability of blockchain technology are established, it is fair to expect that
these solutions can also be relevant to SMP-based trading environments. Therefore, future
research should emphasize tackling the scalability issue.
7. Conclusions
Existing privacy-enabling schemes are not effective against identity-based attacks
or ensuring transactional data privacy in blockchain-based network applications, such
as resource trading in the SMP. In order to achieve a participant’s anonymity, untrace-
ability and transactional data privacy, we proposed a privacy-enabled message exchange
mechanism among the participants of the SMP. Security analysis of the proposed scheme
under different threat scenarios has shown that it is much more resilient to identity-based
attacks compared with the benchmark protocols. Moreover, the simulation-based analysis
showed that the proposed scheme not only minimizes the probability of success for the
attacker but is also less computationally expensive.
