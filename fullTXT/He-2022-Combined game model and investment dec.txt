Abstract
Distributed energy based on clean energy has gradually become a progressively impor-
tant part of the energy system due to increasingly prominent environmental problems and 
energy crises. Presently, the development of distributed energy has the phenomena of 
investment chaos, resource waste, and information asymmetry. We propose a grid-distrib-
uted energy system joint decision-making model based on the alliance blockchain to solve 
problems including the power generation strategy of distributed energy users and the grid 
investment plan connected to the distributed system. Firstly, we construct the return models 
of the distributed energy system and the power grid system separately. Secondly, combined 
with the analysis of the game mechanism of different entities, we propose a multi-agent 
decision-making model of the distributed energy system based on the alliance blockchain. 
Thirdly, based on this model, we optimize the revenue of the entire system through the 
dynamic game and use the alliance chain and smart contract to automatically execute. 
Finally, the model is solved by the iterative search method, and the entire simulation pro-
cess is implemented in Ethereum using python. Based on the idea of joint decision making, 
our study considers the interests of all participants, ensures that the participants maximize 
their benefits in the game process, optimizes the investment decisions of each entity, and 
improves the effectiveness of the grid-distributed energy system decision making.

has such disadvantages as disorder investment, wasted resources, as well as asymmetric 
information. According to the provisions in Regulations of Full Guarantee Acquisition for 
Renewable Energy Generation (National Energy Administration., 2016), there is no region 
where renewable energy generation is limited, and power grid enterprises should guarantee 
the grid-connected project of the renewable energy generation, purchasing all the generated 
energy. Generally, distributed energy generation is combined to the grid or included into 
the power-purchasing plan ahead of time in the manner of contract presently. But distrib-
uted energy system is characterized by disabling power generation, which results in the 
possible difference between the generation plan and actual power generation, as well as 
an increase in difficulty of power grid dispatching; and the distributed energy system is 
asymmetric with the power grid in the information, which causes waste investment in the 
power grid. The thesis puts forward the combined decision-making model of power grid-
distributed energy systems based on the consortium blockchain, the decision-making issues 
include generating strategies of distributed energy users; furthermore, the thesis studies 
the plan of power grid investment linking with the distributed system. The investment in 
various subjects is optimized from the angle of combined decision making of power grid-
distributed energy systems based on the blockchain technology and game theory in this 
research. The trading platform is established with blockchain to ensure the automatic and 
standard running of the trade. Interest demands for different subjects are independent of 
each other, their decision makings are carried out based on individual rationality and are 
balanced in the process of the game.
Presently, there is rare literature about the research on the combination of the power 
grid and distributed energy system, not to speak of the literature about the research on 
the combination of blockchain technology and game theory. In the thesis, a combined 
decision-making model of power grid-distributed energy system is put forward, and the 
model considering a combined game when many subjects make decisions are executed 
automatically based on a consortium blockchain. Firstly the return model of distributed 
energy system and the relative power grid companies is established; Secondly, a dynamic 
game model related to combined decision making of power grid-distributed energy system 
is put forward based on analysis on the game mechanism, and a mixed trend model based 
on sequence solving method is put forward to conduct the safety correction on many deci-
sion-making schemes; finally, the model is solved by iterative search method. The game 
relations among different subjects are fully considered based on the thinking of the com-
bined decision making in the thesis so that the economic safety and reliability for decision 
making are ensured from the integrated angle of the power grid-distributed energy system. 
What’s more, the maximization of earnings for the participants in the process of the game 
is guaranteed to improve the effectiveness of decision making of power grid-distributed 
energy systems. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the model are verified in the 
thesis based on the simulation results of the typical cases.
There are three main contributions of this study. Firstly, based on the dynamic game 
theory, a joint decision model for power grid and distributed energy system is established, 
to maximize the value of the objective function to achieve the maximum economic benefits 
and social welfare of each agent, which optimizes system resource allocation and increases 
the penetration rate of distributed energy. A typical power system is taken as a case to sim-
ulate and solve the Nash bargaining to illustrate the feasibility of the constructed model. 
Secondly, the integrated application of blockchain technology plays an important role in 
the field of business process reconstruction and industrial interaction model innovation. 
This research introduces blockchain technology to design an investment decision-making 
system based on the alliance chain. Meanwhile, the smart contracts are deployed on the

blockchain to automatically execute power grid-distributed energy system transactions. It’s 
a preliminary exploration for the development of distributed energy transactions. Thirdly, 
from the perspective of each investment agent, this paper uses multi-agent technology to 
analyze the game transfer relationship between the main agents, and further studies the 
dynamic game decision-making behaviors, which meets the interests of different agents, 
which also enhances the economy and reliability of investment in power grid companies 
and distributed energy systems.
The structure of the remainder is as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the lit-
erature about the application of blockchain technology in the distributed energy system and 
game theory in the decision model. Section 3 elaborates the dynamic game method used 
in this paper and the game behaviors of each agent, which also provides Nash equilibrium 
strategy. In Sect. 4, a typical case is simulated; the results and discussion under different 
investment strategy scenarios are obtained. Based on the above research, the main conclu-
sions of this paper are drawn in Sect. 5.
2  Literature review
Blockchain is a series of lists related to the data blocks, the trading data can be stored in the 
distributed system with de-trust, traceability, and un-modification. The blockchain is char-
acterized by decentralization and automation of contract execution. In blockchain technolo-
gies, consortium blockchain which is similar to distributed database technology is more 
suitable for the scene with more trading nodes, more trade quantity, and higher trading 
frequency (Tai et al., 2017; Wang & Liu, 2019), and more suitable for being applied to the 
distributed energy system. Wu and Tran (2018) discussed the application of blockchain in 
the sustainable energy system and analyzed the challenges existing in the application of it 
to the energy Internet. Ahl et al. (2019) established the peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids anal-
ysis frame for blockchain based on a general survey of peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids and 
put forward the actual significance of the frame on the development of distributed energy 
institutions. Hou et  al. (2020) analyzed the competitiveness of the distributed energy by 
using Michael Porter’s five competitive models, and analyzed the combined development 
mode of “blockchain technology + distributed energy” by using the SWOT model, and con-
cluded that blockchain technology can enhance the competitiveness of distributed energy. 
In the literature (Ding, 2015; Lu et al., 2017), settlement smart contract of electric market 
trade was designed, the key technical difficulties were analyzed, and provided the solutions. 
Li et al., (2019) put forward a hierarchical structure frame of energy demand-side manage-
ment which is realized by P2P exchange of energy in the real-time market, so as to realize 
the safety and efficiency of multi-sectoral demands and distributed energy system manage-
ment of renewable energy generation by utilizing smart contract and blockchain scheme. 
In the literature (Jin et al., 2019), the charging and trading model of electro mobiles based 
on consortium blockchains, and the feasibility of the above methods was verified by taking 
the actual distribution scene of the charging stations in the region of Tianjin City as the 
example. In the literature (Xie et al., 2019; Zheng, 2019), the model of microgrid economic 
dispatching based on blockchain was studied, the decentralization economic dispatching 
was realized by blockchain. In the literature (She et al., 2019), a kind of model of multi-
energy complementary safe trading based on isomeric energy blockchain was put forward 
to solve the issues related to multi-energy complementation and integrated trading of dis-
tributed energy in energy trading systems. The combined decision-making model of power

grid-distributed energy system based on the consortium chain can be automatically exe-
cuted while various subjects’ privacy is kept.
Nowadays, the application of blockchain technology in distributed energy trading can 
be divided into three categories: transaction process design, consensus mechanism design, 
and system optimization design. The research on transaction process design can be divided 
into four aspects. Firstly, there is some research about the market transaction model. Wang 
et  al., (2018) proposed a parallel bidding framework based on the three-layer distribu-
tion network architecture and the decentralized characteristics of the blockchain to sup-
port energy transactions between microgrids. Wei et al., (2021) constructed a distributed 
energy peer-to-peer trading framework based on blockchain, using technologies such as 
credit value evaluation, intelligent contracts, and energy currency incentive mechanisms 
to support fast and frequent energy transactions and overcome the confirmation delay of 
energy blockchain transactions. Luo et  al., (2019) proposed a distributed power trading 
system for producers in the active distribution network (ADN), which uses technologies 
such as multi-agent system, agent alliance mechanism, and blockchain transaction settle-
ment mechanism to solve the problem of determining energy transaction prices separately 
and promote peer-to-peer power-sharing among producers. Okoye et al., (2020) proposed a 
network-enhanced transaction microgrid model that uses blockchain technology and opti-
mized participant license agreements to improve transaction speed and convenience. Sec-
ondly, there is research about auction mechanisms. Zhao et al., (2020) proposed a two-layer 
framework of energy transaction between the multi-layer microgrid and internal microgrid 
based on blockchain and adopted a transaction method of continuous double auction mech-
anism to effectively reduce the transaction volume with the main grid and improve energy 
efficiency. Wang Jianmin et al. proposed a decentralized power trading system for micro-
grids based on blockchain and a continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. The system 
can quickly achieve market balance and is suitable for short-term microgrid trading. It pro-
motes the development of an integrated energy trading protocol based on blockchain and 
the engineering application of integrated energy trading (Wang et  al., 2017; Zhao et  al., 
2018).
Thirdly, there is research about demand response management. Noor et  al., (2018) 
introduced a distributed energy management model based on blockchain, including 
energy supply control, storage management, and game theory algorithms, to achieve 
decentralized demand-side management and promote peer-to-peer transactions accord-
ing to the optimized demand profile. Claudia et al., (2018) proposed a distributed con-
trol model of medium / low voltage smart grid based on blockchain by establishing and 
running decentralized peer-to-peer energy flexibility. It is found that distributed DSM 
based on the blockchain can be used to match energy demand and production at the 
smart grid level, improve the tracking accuracy of demand response signals, and reduce 
the energy flexibility required for convergence. Afzal et al., (2020) proposed a distrib-
uted demand-side management system based on blockchain technology among multi-
ple households in the community microgrid. The equipment of a single household in 
the intelligence community is scheduled through electricity price so that the generated 
renewable energy is consumed locally in the community microgrid, while the trans-
action is carried out on the blockchain without the need for a central control entity, 
to achieve the purpose of reducing energy consumption. Wu et al., (2017) proposed a 
demand-side response resource point-to-point transaction framework based on block-
chain technology and energy management system EMS to realize dynamic real-time 
scheduling of energy transactions. Fourthly, there is research about security and pri-
vacy. Gai et  al., (2019) proposed a transaction model using federated blockchain in a 
8671Combined game model and investment decision making of power…

smart grid. This model proposes a privacy protection method based on noise to hide the 
transaction distribution trend of adjacent energy trading systems supported by block-
chain to protect the problem of privacy leakage in energy transactions. She et al., (2018) 
proposed a kind of distributed energy transaction authentication model based on an alli-
ance chain. The model protects the private data of all parties to a certain extent through 
blockchain rights proof, data encryption, timestamp, distributed consensus, and data 
separation. Guan et al., (2021) proposed a distributed energy transaction scheme based 
on privacy protection based on blockchain. by introducing the encryption algorithm 
based on ciphertext policy (CP-ABE) as the core algorithm to reconstruct the transac-
tion model, this algorithm realizes fine-grained access control through transaction arbi-
tration in the form of ciphertext. This design greatly improves the security and reliabil-
ity of the transaction model.
Game theory has been applied widely in the aspects of generation decision making 
related to the power system, grid structure decision, etc. (Chen, et al., 2017; Contreras & 
Wu, 2000; Lu et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2009). Saeed et al., (2017) studied the market prices of 
suppliers and consumers in the uncontrolled retail electricity market based on game theory 
and Nash equilibrium theory, putting forward a highly dynamic electricity market frame, 
and as a result, the effectiveness of the frame was verified. Mei et al., (2012) discussed the 
cooperative game problem of stroke, light, and storage in a hybrid power system, and pro-
posed, analyzed, and compared four typical distribution strategies. Based on the dynamic 
game theory of complete information, Jin et al., (2017) built a decision model for photovol-
taic, energy storage, and power grid, which could realize rational optical storage layout and 
coordinated decision of power grid while ensuring the maximum benefit of participants. 
Based on the analysis of the game mechanism of different investment entities, Yang et al., 
(2019) proposed a dynamic game model for joint decision making of power-natural gas 
integrated energy system, and the simulation results verified the effectiveness and ration-
ality of the model. Lu, (2017) proposed a cooperative evolution model considering node 
altruism, and introduced the evolutionary game theory, which shows that individual altru-
ism can effectively promote cooperation in the cooperative evolution model considering 
individual altruism.
With the wide application of game theory in power systems, the combination of game 
theory and blockchain technology has gradually become a new trend of distributed energy 
development. Gong et al., (2021) have constructed a co-governance trading environment 
between aggregators and multiple microgrid trading agents in microgrid groups and a new 
energy trading model between aggregators and microgrid nodes based on blockchain tech-
nology. The blockchain aggregator–microgrid group alliance transaction architecture, block 
data structure, environmental identification factor incentive mechanism of dynamic coop-
erative game, and intelligent contract supported by the multi-objective evolutionary algo-
rithm are designed. The co-governance coefficient is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the microgrid group operation strategy, which shows that the co-governance transaction 
model can effectively promote the local consumption of renewable energy, improve the 
energy supply structure of microgrid nodes, and promote the low-carbon sustainable devel-
opment of microgrid groups.  She et al., (2019) constructed a multi-energy complementary 
security transaction model MCST-HEB of heterogeneous energy blockchain. By construct-
ing the energy index transaction relay chain and the energy supply parallel chain, the model 
realizes the integration of a variety of distributed energy uplinks into the grid and can carry 
out multi-energy complementary and integrated scheduling of various kinds of distributed 
energy connected to the grid, so that the transaction of multiple energy can be carried out 
directly between the energy supplier and the energy consumer.

Considering the role of game theory in joint decision making, Wang et al., (2018) 
proposed the construction and simulation of a single-agent new energy seller decision-
making model in spot market based on stochastic–robust hybrid optimization method, 
construction, and simulation of a single-agent buyer decision model in spot market 
based on stochastic integer mixed optimization method, construction, and simulation 
of spot market multi-agent decision model based on GDCAC algorithm, improve-
ment of spot market-clearing model and construction and simulation of multi-agent 
decision-making model under new energy bidding based on robust optimization and 
LSCAC algorithm. On the one hand, the multi-agent decision-making model can pro-
vide quantitative decision-making tools for “price influencers” participants to trade in 
the spot electricity market. On the other hand, it can provide quantitative analysis tools 
and simulation platforms for market economy operation simulation, market planning, 
and design, policy effect estimation, and other related research.
For the application of complete-information game theory in decision making, Jen-
abi et al., (2013) put forward an extended decision-making model considering power 
generation companies and transmission companies. The results show that joint deci-
sion making of generation and transmission can fully tap the transmission capacity of 
the power grid and effectively alleviate transmission congestion, and achieve win–win 
results for both generation and transmission. The extended decision-making model 
related to power generating companies and transmission companies was built based on 
complete-information game theory, and the result showed that the combined decision 
making of power generating and transmission can explore the transmission capacity 
of the power grid and relieve transmission block effectively to realize a win–win of 
power generating party and transmission party. Yu et  al., (2017) put forward a kind 
of new DR (demand response) resource trading frame based on incentive mechanism, 
analyzed the interaction among the different participants in the electricity market by 
using two-loop Stackelberg game, proving that the method can compensate for the 
lack of resource with the minimized cost. Furthermore, Wang et  al., (2020) put for-
ward a kind of comprehensive risk evaluation method of the independent power system 
operator (ESO) and independent heat supply system operator (HSO) and established 
The post-contingency dispatch model for The integrated electricity and heat system 
(IEHS) based on Stackelberg game model, and the result proved that the method can 
coordinate the after-emergency dispatching of energy operator effectively, reducing 
the anticipated cost. Liang et al., (2017) put forward a kind of smart grid-distributed 
demand-side energy management plan based on an ordered state based on game the-
ory, minimizing the gross of energy procurement of total power cost, supply capacity 
of power-distribution infrastructure, individual appliance, and users’ energy demand 
target by using distribution algorithm. Li and Yan, (2020) put forward a kind of real-
time pricing (RTP) scheme balancing real-time demand and transferring peak demand 
based on the non-cooperative game, analyzing the best strategy associated with energy 
consumption, power generating, and storage power arranged for users, in the mean-
time, the privacy of users and power suppliers were protected, and the effectiveness 
of the scheme was verified by the simulation result. There is a rarely combined appli-
cation of game theory and blockchain. Amin et al., (2020) put forward a kind of P2P 
electricity transaction frame of incorporating both non-cooperative and cooperative 
games to ensure the stability of contract between prosumers and consumers, realizing 
win–win.

The typical participants in the power grid-distributed energy system include distributed 
energy system and its linked power grid. See Fig. 1.
A distributed energy system can generate power to be included in the grid, and purchase 
power from the grid. The model only considers the game between power generation to be 
included in the grid and investment in the power grid for distributed energy. The distrib-
uted energy system hopes to improve the investment benefits of its power generating facili-
ties to reduce running costs. Furthermore, the distributed energy is governed by renewable 
clean energy which will result in environmental benefits. Power grid companies hope to 
improve investment benefits in the power grid. Different subjects which are independent 
of each other have different targets when making a decision. In the thesis, the difference 
between the total income of the grid and the total cost of the grid was calculated to obtain

3.2  Combined decision‑making model of power grid‑distributed energy system 
based on a consortium blockchain
The requirements for processing information in the combined decision-making model of 
power grid-distributed energy system mainly include information safety for trading; protection 
of privacy of participants; protection of the important assets and commercially confidential 
information; prevention from fabrication and modification of trading data; improvement of 
transparency and reliability of settlement of trading and insurance real-time data. The alliance 
chain is introduced to construct the joint decision-making model of power grid-distributed 
energy system, and the alliance chain records information, including power supply plan and 
user information of distributed energy system, user purchase plan, investment information of 
power grid company, energy information, and transaction information. Smart contracts consist 
of three sub-contracts, namely, the matching contract, the credit mechanism contract, and the 
payment contract. Each subject uploads the supply and demand requirements, plans, and so on 
to the chain. After the intelligent contract is loaded with the algorithm, the buyers and sellers 
on the chain carry out point-to-point matching and match the buying and selling transactions. 
The transaction results affect the decision-making investment among the subjects, and then 
continue to affect the market trading results. To pursue the maximum income, each subject 
continues to adjust investment decisions, so repeatedly, the formation of a game, as shown in 
Fig. 2. Among them, the game process includes game relationship transmission, game deci-
sion making, mixed power flow, and game solution. Smart contracts are simply understood as 
the terms of the digital version and the agreements required to enforce them. Smart contracts 
are deployed on the blockchain and are executed automatically as part of transaction valida-
tion. After the contract is created, the contract will be represented as a special identity string, 
and the smart contract consists of the contract address, the contract account balance, a prede-
fined executable code, and several status variables. Different users interact with the intelligent 
contract by sending the transaction of the calling contract to the known contract address.
The decision-making target is to optimize the equilibrium state of the power grid-dis-
tributed energy system in the process of the dynamic game through the interaction of game 
relationships among the subjects. The overall model related to the combined decision mak-
ing of power grid-distributed energy systems based on consortium blockchain is shown in 
Fig. 2. In Figs. 2.1–2.4, the model is analyzed specifically. In Fig. 2.1, distributed energy 
system and transfer of game relations of power grid company are described; In Fig. 2.2, 
dynamic game decision-making behavior is described; In Fig. 2.3, mixed currents in the 
game process is described; In Fig. 2.4, the model is solved by sequence solving method.

3.2.1  Game relationship transfer
Through mixed current model, distributed energy system and grid company influence 
mutually in the process of safety correction. In the decision process, distributed energy sys-
tems can make decisions in the aspects of investment of its power generating equipment, 
power utilization plan, and on-grid scheme, to influence the investment decision making of 
grid company. Grid companies can decide the aspect of the net rack construction invest-
ment plan to optimize investment. Grid companies and users can influence the network 
topology structure through current information transferred by coupling nodes. The subjects 
make the decision independently while influence mutually to form a game relationship. 
The game relationship transfer is shown in Fig. 3, in which the set to be selected for dis-
tributed power investment includes a decision to be selected for distributed generator unit 
within the whole life cycle; on-grid scheme and power utilization plan refer to scheme and 
plan for each time interval. The model is realized in blockchain, and an on-grid scheme and 
power utilization plan can be adjusted automatically. Net rack construction investment cov-
ers major distribution network construction plans within the whole life cycle.
3.2.2  Dynamic game decision‑making behavior
The distributed system is considered as a whole in the model, without consideration of 
the game among various users inside the distributed system. In the process of the game,

the initial electricity generation strategy is given firstly by the distributed system, then a 
decision-making plan is given by the grid company, which on the contrary influences strat-
egy of distributed system. Dynamic game pattern is formed between grid company and 
distributed system. The game behavior is automatically completed in blockchain and smart 
contracts, as shown in Fig. 4.
As shown in Fig. 4, in the first game round, the distributed system decides the initial 
power generating plan according to its situation firstly, providing decision  MF
0, to store 
into the blockchain, and transfer information to grid company. While grid company pro-
vides  ME
0 by adjusting the net rack construction investment plan, calculating grid currents, 
then transfer current information to coupling nodes which convert current information to 
feedback to the distributed system, and step into the next game round after topology is 
updated. The game reaches Nash equilibrium state when distributed system and grid com-
pany fail to gain more returns even if a strategy is changed in the process of the game, as 
shown in the following formula:
In formula 14, M∗
F
 and M∗
E
 refer to the optimized strategy of one party, when the other 
party selects the optimized strategy. Both distributed systems and grid companies can gain 
the equilibrium maximum return by such a kind of strategy profile. Argmax () refers to 
the variable set when the targeted function has the maximum value. The game process is 
executed in the smart contract automatically.
3.2.3  Mixed currents in the process of game
In the process of the game, decision-making plans influence each other through the transfer 
and conversion of current parameters indirectly in the process of mixed current calculation. 
The specific process of safety correction for mixed currents is as follows:
(1) After the decision-making plan is confirmed by distributed energy system and grid 
company, the current of the power system of the net rack structure is calculated, and 
the plan is corrected. The current information is transferred to coupling nodes after 
correction;
(2) The power equilibrium relationship of coupling nodes is utilized to calculate the energy 
flux of coupling nodes substituted into the current model for calculation, which can 
realize the safety correction of decision-making plan;

3.2.4  Model solving
Nash equilibrium is solved by the iterative search method in the thesis. The solving steps 
are as follows, and the solving flow is shown in Fig. 5.
Step 1: Input original data and parameters and initialize the data required for establish-
ing game model, which includes user load information, parameters of generating equip-
ment to be selected, power price, cost of distributed generating equipment, the investment 
cost of net rack structure for the power grid, topological parameters of the original network 
and other necessary parameters.
Step 2: Generate a strategy set of game participants. The distributed system generates 
power generating plan set {MF

Step 3: Extract any group of plans as the initial value of the decision-making plan from 
the strategy set.
Step 4: Set the initial iterative value δ = 2.
Step 5: Optimize the plan. According to the information of the last round, distributed 
system and grid company make the decision, correction, and calculation once again. The 
final return of the game round is obtained through mixed current calculation.
Step 6: Judge whether the equilibrium state is reached. If the returns of the successive 
two times of game rounds are the same, it will be regarded as an equilibrium state, and go 
to step 6; if not, δ = δ + 1, and return to step 5.
Step 7: Output the equilibrium solution  (MF

*) and final returns of various 
parties.
4  Results and discussion
4.1  Data sources
In the section, the model above mentioned is performed with the analog simulation through 
a typical case. The blockchain and smart contract are developed based on the Ethereum 
platform, and the smart contract is compiled and deployed by using python3.7 (python 
database). Ethereum platform is a general virtual currency platform, which can use the 
tools of Ethernet Square to generate an intelligent contract system for any number of dif-
ferent virtual currencies. As long as there is a key system that enables transactions to be 
tracked and parties in the platform can interact directly without any trusted third party, 
this untrusted intelligent contract infrastructure provides faster and cheaper transactions. 
Ethernet can be public or private without any permission, while the fabric is a private and 
licensed network. On the other hand, our project focuses on exploring the game situation 
among the subjects in the power market, rather than the implementation of the trading mar-
ket, simplifies the construction of the platform without considering authority and confi-
dentiality, and focuses on simulating the free trading of the electricity market. It is more 
convenient to build the platform in Ethernet Square.
The power grid-distributed energy system is composed of the power system of the 
modified IEEE24 node. The distributed energy system covers 3 sets of existing generat-
ing equipment, 5 sets of generating equipment to be selected. IEEE24 node system cov-
ers 9 generating equipment, 8 power lines to be selected, with 1 maximum expanded line 
for each line. Only construction of power lines is considered in the power grid invest-
ment, without considering the construction of transformer substation and power-distri-
bution network. In this paper, photovoltaic panels with an installed capacity of 280 W 
and small wind turbines with 500 W are selected. The installed capacity of node 1 is 
167.2 MW, which is composed of 35 distributed power points, in which each distributed 
PowerPoint contains 500 distributed power users whose installed capacity is less than 
10 kW, and 100 distributed power users whose installed capacity is larger than 10 kW. 
At the same time, the installed capacity of nodes 2、13、14、15、16、22 and 23 is 
167.2 MW, 220 MW, 833.4 MW, 341 MW, 341 MW, 880 MW, and 341 MW, respec-
tively. The data for the detailed generating equipment and power lines to be selected are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2, in which the investment cost of power lines is Ұ683,880 Ұ/
km (Data source: Enterprise data). As for the running cost of the distributed generating 
equipment and the load of the power network, please refer to the literature (Ng et al., 
8682 Y. He et al.

2009). It is assumed that the mean on-grid price for users in the distributed system is 
Ұ0.5/(kW·h) and the retail price of grid company is Ұ0.657 /(kW·h) which is referring 
to the flat-section electricity price of large industrial users in Beijing City. There are 3 
scenes totally for the analog simulation: scene 1 is about the independent decision mak-
ing for the power grid and the distributed system without consideration of the game; 
scene 2 is about the combined decision making of the power grid-distributed system 
without consideration of game; scene 3 is about the combined decision making of the 
power grid-distributed system with consideration of game.
4.2  Simulation results analysis
The requirements of load for users in the distributed system in 3 scenes are the same. The 
comparison of power network decision-making results is shown in Fig. 6.
It is known from Fig. 6 that in the decision making of generating equipment, what scene 
1 selected was the No. 1, No. 2, No. 7, and No. 15-node unit; what scene 2 selected was 
the No. 1, No. 2, No. 7, and No. 16-node unit; what scene 3 selected was the No. 1, No. 2 
and No. 7-node unit. In the decision making of power lines, the difference of 3 scenes is 
as follows: in scene 2, power lines are newly constructed in all the branches to be selected; 
in scene 1, there are no newly constructed power lines in the 21–18 branches and 23–20 
branches; in scene 3, there are no newly constructed lines in the 23–20 branches. The situ-
ations related to newly constructed power lines for the rest of branches are the consistent.

4.2.1  Comparison analysis of scene 1 and scene 2
A comparison of return in scene 1 and scene 2 is shown in Table 3.
It can be seen from Table 3 that the decision-making result of scene 1 is different from 
that of scene 2. Independent decision making is conducted in scene 1 while combined deci-
sion making is conducted in scene 2. Independent decision making differs from combined 
decision making in the aspect of the thinking in seeking the optimized target. Independent 
decision making refers to decision making by the distributed system and grid company 
separately, while combined decision refers to overall planning decision making by power 
grid-distributed energy system from the integrated angle.
As far as investment cost is concerned, the investment cost of grid company in scene 2 
reduced by Ұ41.03 million compared with scene 1. The reason is that the decision-making 
scheme was formulated with the optimized total revenue of power grid-distributed energy 
system as the target in the process of combined decision making in scene 2, and the num-
ber of expanded lines in the vicinity of the coupling nodes was less than that in scene 1 so 
that the investment cost of grid company was reduced.
As far as other several costs are concerned, compared with scene 1, the on-grid energy 
for the distributed energy system reduced in scene 2, with reduction of on-grid income 
by Ұ27.60 million, reduction of the running cost by Ұ1.88 million, reduction of environ-
mental revenue by Ұ9.60 million as well; the investment of grid company reduced, with 
reduction of power loss by Ұ2.50 million. The generating cost and running cost for the 
distributed energy system were higher than that for the traditional coal-fired unit of thermal 
power. As for grid companies, the on-grid cost of the distributed energy was higher than 
that of thermal power, but generating pollution emissions for the distributed energy system 
was much less than that for the coal-fired unit, which would result in a reduction of envi-
ronmental pollution drastically. The independent decision making in scene 1 was similar to 
the current practical situation. With the expansion of lines in the vicinity of the distributed 
energy system, a part of generating capacity would be transferred from the coal-fired unit 
to the distributed energy system, leading to the decrease in environmental cost. While con-
sumption of the electricity network could increase because the expansion of lines could 
increase the total power transmission distance of the lines.
The total revenue in scene 2 increased Ұ6.21 million compared with scene 1. The rea-
son is that the independent decision making for the distributed energy and grid company

in scene 1 caused the failure of formulating comprehensively the best decision-making 
plan by overall planning coordination for its power load. Different from scene 1, the model 
in scene 2 might conduct overall planning coordination from the integrated angle of the 
power grid-distributed energy system. The formulated decision-making plan brought about 
a great reduction of investment cost and power loss cost of the grid company in scene 2, 
but also brought about reduction of load which was transferred from the coal-fired unit to 
the distributed energy system and reduction of environmental benefits. Therefore scene 2 
can increase the total revenue of the system on the whole compared with scene 1.
The correction of coupling nodes was conducted by using the result of the current cal-
culation in scene 1 and scene 2. The ultimate decision-making results in scene 1 and scene 
2 were performed with mixed current calculations to judge whether to meet the require-
ment of power balance constraint of coupling nodes. The results in scene 2 passed the cor-
rection of coupling nodes, while 28.12% of nodes in scene 1 did not pass the correction. It 
is shown in Table 4.
In scene 2, the constraint conditions for the coupling nodes have been considered when 
decision making was conducted. While in scene 1, the distributed energy system and the 
grid company only considered the safety constraint conditions of their network separately,

therefore the decision-making result in scene 1 might come with the situation which did 
not meet the requirement of constraint conditions for coupling nodes when running by 
combination.
4.3  Comparison analysis of scene 2 and scene 3
The decision-making results in scene 2 and scene 3 differed from each other although a 
combined decision was made in the two scenes. The reason is that in scene 2 the combined 
decision was made to maximize the total revenue. While in scene 3 the equilibrium state 
of the maximized revenue for participants was pursued by the dynamic game between the 
grid company and the distributed energy system, starting from individual rationality. Fur-
thermore, the participants’ adjusted strategies in time automatically in scene 3 based on 
blockchain technology. Therefore, the decision-making plan in scene 3 might differ from 
that in scene 2 without consideration of the game. In scene 2 and scene 3, the comparison 
of various costs and revenues of the grid company and the distributed energy system is 
shown in Tables 5 and 6.
Compared with scene 2, it can be seen from Table 3 that the investment cost in power 
lines in scene 3 increased by Ұ26.61 million and the power loss cost increased by Ұ2 mil-
lion. In scene 3, the trading efficiency improved because the grid company and the dis-
tributed system based on blockchain technology-adjusted investment strategy in time after 
multiple subjects participated in the game.
Compared with scene 2, it can be seen from Table  6 that in scene 3, the revenue of 
the grid company was reduced by Ұ19.31 million and the total revenue of the distributed 
energy system was reduced by Ұ9 × 106. The reason is that in scene 2, the decision-making 
plan was issued unitedly to maximize the overall interests by which various investment 
subjects needed to abide, and the subjects failed to make independent decisions to obtain 
a better result for themselves only. As a result, in scene 2, the maximization of the overall 
revenue was based on losing environmental benefits and reducing the on-grid of the dis-
tributed energy.

In scene 3, the participants made independent decisions for the sake of their interests 
and in pursuit of the equilibrium game result satisfying various participants in the inter-
constrained dynamic game process. Compared with scene 2, in scene 3 the total revenue 
decreased, but the decision-making plan considered the interests of all the participants. 
Therefore, the dynamic game decision-making plan conformed to the running mechanism 
of the distributed energy and ensured development motivation effectively.
5  Conclusion
The combined decision-making model of the power grid-distributed energy system is put 
forward in combination with the dynamic game theory based on consortium blockchain 
in the thesis, and the returned model of game subjects is built separately to establish the 
dynamic game model of the combined decision making. Finally, the model is solved by the 
iterative search method. The conclusion is as follows:
(1) The issues including investment chaos, resource waste, asymmetric information exist-
ing in the distributed energy system can be optimized by combination from power 
grid-distributed energy system.
(2) Overall planning modeling is studied from the integrated angle of power grid-dis-
tributed energy system, the game behaviors of many subjects are considered in the 
combined decision-making process, the interests of all the participants are considered 
in the manner of overall planning. Therefore, the formulated decision-making plan not 
only increases the total revenue of distributed energy system, on the whole, optimizing 
investment decision making but also ensures stable running of coupling nodes in safety 
effectively, which promote the development of distributed energy.
(3) Blockchain technology executes the game process automatically so that the whole 
decision-making process is in time, efficient, and in favor of optimizing the integrated 
benefit.
(4) By comparing the simulation results of typical examples in different scenarios, it can 
be seen that compared with independent decision making, joint decision making can 
increase the total benefit of the system as a whole. Compared with the joint decision 
making without the game, the joint decision-making method proposed in this paper 
takes into account the interests of all participants and is more in line with the operation 
mechanism of distributed energy. It provides an effective method for distributed energy 
to participate in power transaction-related decision making in the future.
(5) With the combination of blockchain and distributed energy, the rational allocation of 
resources through joint decision making can give full play to the maximum economic 
and social benefits of each subject, and help to further optimize the energy system. 
Furthermore, it provides a reference for government departments to formulate relevant 
energy policies to guide the enthusiasm of users to participate in distributed energy 
investment.
China has always adopted an incentive policy for distributed generation, and the pro-
motion of the new power reform makes more and more subjects participate in the market 
transaction, which makes it possible for the electricity market transaction based on block-
chain. It is necessary to further develop the market-oriented transaction of distributed gen-
eration and deepen the reform of the power system so that individuals and enterprises can

become the main body of electricity sales. Simultaneously, a distributed energy transaction 
management system can be established in China including information systems, market 
mechanisms, and pricing mechanisms. The energy bilateral trading system is associated 
with the blockchain accounts of market participants to know the real-time demand and sup-
ply data of the participants. Based on these data, we can forecast consumption and power 
generation, and formulate relevant bidding strategies accordingly. Then the distributed 
energy market can operate efficiently by matching the sale and purchase orders of market 
participants to achieve the rational allocation of energy resources.
In the process of promoting the energy Internet, we should deeply tap all kinds of dis-
tributed resources and strengthen the interaction between the distributed energy system and 
the power grid. An energy system trading platform based on blockchain is constructed to 
realize the optimal scheduling among multi-systems. In the joint decision-making model 
of the power grid and distributed energy system proposed in this paper when making self-
decision optimization, each system takes into account the interests of other systems, adjusts 
decisions regarding the information of other systems, and optimizes their respective invest-
ment decisions. It can achieve the result of optimal overall benefit, and at the same time 
improve the phenomenon of investment confusion, waste of resources, and information 
asymmetry in the development of distributed energy.
