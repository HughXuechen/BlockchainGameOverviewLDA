ABSTRACT Bitcoin is the first and most successful Blockchain system so far. In the Bitcoin system, miners
use transaction attached fees as a driving force to mine a new block and package transactions, while users
compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. Considering the particularity of Bitcoin trading
system, we take time series into consideration to analyze the transaction rules of Bitcoin system from the
perspective of multiple cycles and establish a dynamic gamemodel related to time under Generalised Second
Price(GSP) mechanism, and also confirm the model’s superiority on saving users’ fees, compared with the
static game model. Also, we propose the quantification of the user experience quantified by calculating
the price difference between the transactions uploaded by the same user within adjacent times, making the
transaction process of the Bitcoin system no longer the final say of the transaction price. The dynamic game
model shows that there is a perfect Bayesian game equilibrium solution in the payment decision, so there
is no incentive for users to change the attached fee, and the whole system is maintained stably. In addition,
we verify the dynamic game model from computational experiment. Firstly, it is proved that with the help of
revenue discount, the cost saving of the dynamic model is generally higher than that of the static model. Then
the user’s revenue under the dynamic model is showing an upward trend, and the transactions order under
the dynamic model is more stable than that under static model, which can be illustrated mathematically and
computationally that the proposed dynamic game model in this paper will help all transactions be processed
more efficiently in a uniform pipeline.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a novel application model that combines
the uniqueness and innovation of computer technology.
Blockchain technology has attracted intensive research inter-
ests and witnessed phenomenal development in recent years
[1], [2]. The first and most successful blockchain system so
far is widely known as Bitcoin.
Under a mechanism named ‘‘mining’’, the miner who suc-
ceeds in the consensus competition gets the right to confirm
his/her chosen transactions and record them into the new
block. And the miner will get paid of the block reward and
transaction fees [6], [7]. Block reward accounted for the vast
majority of the miners’ earnings in the early days of the
system, but the transaction fees begin to play the key role as

the economic incentive to stimulate miners contributing their
computing power so as to confirm transactions.
Therefore, a critical demand in the individual-level for bit-
coin users to optimize their transaction fees emerges, and also
in the system-level for Bitcoin blockchain to consummate
its transaction ranking mechanism, with the aim of reducing
the exaggerating transaction fees and improving the system
efficiency. At present, the vast majority of Bitcoin transac-
tions are processed in the order defined by the ‘‘rank-by-fee’’
mechanism, and the payment rule defined by the ‘‘pay-it-
bid’’ mechanism, which is known as ‘‘Generalized First Price
(GFP)’’. That is, the transactions with higher attached fees
will be packaged first and users need to pay their declared
fees. The GFP mechanism was the original design for Spon-
sored Search Auction(SSA) since 1998, and this simple rule
will lead users to pay unnecessarily high fees to maintain the
desired ranking of their transactions. However, it is possible
that the attached fees would reach or even exceed the trading

bitcoins, especially in micro-payment scenarios. With this in
mind, the exorbitant transaction fees resulting from the GFP
mechanism will render the system uneconomical for micro
payments [3], [12]. Furthermore, the GFP mechanism has
been proved to be unstable in many scenarios, due to the
dynamic environment, which may force inefficient invest-
ments in gaming [8]. And in 2002 GFP had been replaced
by the Generalized Second Price (GSP) mechanism due to
its inefficiency and high volatility shown in the market prac-
tice. From the research perspective, it is better to model the
transaction ranking problem with the game-theoretic analysis
[9]. In literature [13], Li et al. proposed a transaction ranking
standard based on GSP mechanism from the perspective of
game theory, and verified its advantages over GFP mecha-
nism in saving user expenses. However, the author only con-
sidered the ordering of static single-round trading, ignoring
the dynamic multi-round trading. Compared with the static
gamemodel, the dynamicmodel has strong continuity, timeli-
ness and expansibility, and has the ability to carry adjustment
and renovation out independently. Therefore, we propose a
dynamic game model of bitcoin transaction ranking based on
GSP mechanism.
Based on the single-round static game model in literature
[13], from the perspective of leading a dynamic game, a pay-
ment model and a revenue model are respectively established
to analyze the Bitcoin transaction pricing problem under GSP
mechanism. This paper considers the ranking of transactions
from the perspective of successive rounds, and takes the user
transactions in the previous round into consideration of the
bidding in the next round, so as to optimize the continu-
ity and enhance the independent adjustment ability of the
model.
Compared with the static game model, the main work of
this paper is as follows:
1) On the basis of the existing static game model under
GSP mechanism, we take time series into considera-
tion, compare with traditional sorting method and static
game model, to analyze the transaction rules of Bit-
coin system from the perspective of multiple cycles
and establish a dynamic game model related to time
under GSP mechanism, and also confirm the model’s
superiority on saving users’fees, compared with the
static game model.
2) Also, we propose the quantification of the user experi-
ence in this paper quantified by calculating the price
difference between the transactions uploaded by the
same user within adjacent times, which makes the
transaction process of the Bitcoin system no longer
the final say of the transaction price, thus improving the
probability of small transactions to get higher ranking
and alleviating the transaction pressure to a certain
extent.
3) And we also raise a parameter named revenue discount,
user revenue under the dynamic model increases with
the growing of revenue discount value, finally approach
and surpass the revenue under static model.
4) In addition, we verify the dynamic game model from
computational experiment. The experimental results
show that with the help of revenue discount, the cost
saving of the dynamic model is generally higher than
that of the static model. Then the user’s revenue under
the dynamic model is showing an upward trend, and
the transactions order under the dynamic model is
more stable than that under static model, which can
be illustrated mathematically and computationally that
the proposed dynamic game model in this paper will
help all transactions be processed more efficiently in a
uniform pipeline.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 estab-
lishes the dynamic game model under GSP mechanism,
which is mainly considered from two aspects:parameter
specification and the payment model. Section 4 conducts
computational experiments to validate our theoretical models
and analysis. Section 5 summarizes this paper.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Currently, there are only a limited number of efforts devoted
to understanding the transaction confirmation game in Bit-
coin systems. Lavi et al. [14] argued that Bitcoin’s current
fee market based on the GFP mechanism does not extract
revenue well for miners when blocks are not congested. Also,
according to Houy [9], if transaction fees are totally deter-
mined by a decentralized market and the maximum block
size is not constrained, transaction fees will eventually go
to zero and miners will not have the sufficient incentives to
keep mining, and hence to keep Bitcoin viable. Li et al. [13]
proposed a static game model under the GSP mechanism to
analyze the transaction pattern of Bitcoin system. The GSP
mechanism has achieved a lot in theoretical research, and its
superiority has been amply proved. Bidding users commit to
maintain their transaction current positions unchanged with
a small cost difference. The first economic analysis of GSP
is formulated by Edelman et al. [8] and Varian [15], and
they proposed the Locally Envy-Free Equilibrium and the
Symmetric Nash Equilibrium for the GSP with complete
information, respectively.
Therefore, considering the applicability of GSP mecha-
nism in maintaining the transaction packaging and verifica-
tion in Bitcoin system, aswell as its advantages proven in both
theoretical researches and practical performance, it can be
shown that employing the GSPmodel to replace the currently
adopted GFP model is a timely and meaningful research
innovation [13].
III. DYNAMIC GAME MODEL BASED ON GSP
This section introduces the payment model of Bitcoin system
as the first part of dynamic game model under the GSP
mechanism. The detailed process is as follows.
First, new transactions pending for confirmation with asso-
ciated fees are submitted by users, and they will enter the
memory pool and remain in an unconfirmed state. Then,

FIGURE 1. Process of the Bitcoin transaction confirmation.
miners scan the relevant information of these unconfirmed
transactions, and select a group of preferred transactions
ranked in top positions as their mining basis. Miners who suc-
cessfully obtain the right in packaging selected transactions
from their memory pools will upload them to the new block.
In the Bitcoin system, all information regarding each trans-
action will be broadcasted in public as soon as it is submit-
ted, which includes size, fee, input amount, output amount,
address, and submission time, etc. After each block is mined,
we are free to access the information of confirmed trans-
actions in the block, which means the auction results are
public information. Besides, Bitcoin transactions are basi-
cally transfer transactions. As the transfer amount is public
information, we can then consider that the transaction’s value
is also public information. As such, we study the Bitcoin
transaction confirmation game in the incomplete-information
setting.
The basic process of the Bitcoin transaction confirmation
is shown as Figure1.
A. PARAMETER SPECIFICATION
The relevant parameters of the model are set as follows.
Suppose that the miner’s memory pool has a trading capac-
ity of N , the total number of trading users is K , and each
user submits only one transaction pending for confirmation.
In the Bitcoin system, active users contribute a lot to main-
tain the high-quality sustainable development of the system.
As shown in literature [3], with the market price of Bitcoin
plummeting, many users chose to quit the Bitcoin system,
resulting in a significant reduction in the market size of
Bitcoin and a significant decline in the revenue of the system.
This indicates that the level of user activity will affect the
long-term benefits of the system, so the following model
should be designed with user engagement in mind. It is
reasonable to assume that users who have a better experience
in the transaction are more willing to continue to participate
in the following Bitcoin trading. In the SSA market, the
quantification of the user experience is measured by the
‘‘quality score’’. The concept of quality score was first used
in the advertising, the higher the quality score, the more
prominent the advertisement is, so as to encourage the quality
advertising content [17]. Analogously, this paper proposes a
variable α used to mark the liveness of users in the Bitcoin
system, which makes the transaction process of the Bitcoin
system no longer the final say of the transaction price, thus
improving the probability of small transactions to get higher
ranking and alleviating the transaction pressure to a certain
extent.
In [18]–[20], quality score is implicitly assumed to be an
independent variable that is exogenously assigned by search
engines, and remains unchanged in repeated SSA auctions.
Inspired by the quality score formulation in online ad auctions
[17], we formulate the following function to calculate the user
i’s liveness at time t:
αti =
sti · d
t
i + fi
st−1i · d t−1i
(1)
where,s is the sum of accumulated transaction costs of trans-
action i up to time t , d is the cumulative number of transac-
tions, and f is the price paid by transaction i at time t(s ≥ f ).
The greater the gap between the cost of transaction i at time t
and that at time t−1, that is, the better the user experience is in
a deal, the higher the user is willing to continue to participate
in the trading process, and the stronger the user’s enthusiasm
will be. In other words, the greater the liveness value α will
be.
Besides, in Bitcoin system, transaction fees are calculated
based on the kilobyte size of the transaction, and due to the
limited block size, which restricts on the number of transac-
tions that can be recorded to each block. Therefore, the trans-
action size should be taken into account when analyzing the
transaction ordering problem. As mentioned above, we use

the weighted fee f ′i calculated by compound factors to rank
these transactions, including the transaction fee fi, the block
size mi, the user liveness αi. The more active the user, the
more willing they are to pay for the transaction, and the
smaller the transaction, the more they have to pay to ensure
that the transaction is successfully packaged. It should be
noted that different formulations can be established according
to the specific design targets, and they will not influence the
correctness of the following analysis [16].
Based on the above discussions, we first assign each trans-
action a number i according to the descending order of their
weighted valuations f ′i and establish the formula of f ′i :
f ′i =
αi · fi
mi
(2)
The higher the weighted fee, the higher the transaction
rank.Miners pack deals into new block in the order of ranking
until the block is full. If there are more than one trade with
the same weighted fee, the trade is randomly selected for
packaging: f ′1 > f ′2 > · · · > f ′n .
Bitcoin users concern about whether their transactions can
be packaged successfully. If transaction i meets the follow-
ing inequality, it is considered that transaction i is strictly
included in the block, whereM is block size:
i∑
k=0
mk < M
The revenue discount ρ is designed to represent the dif-
ferent degrees of loss of user benefits with the influence
of marginal transactions. Common transactions are strictly
included in the block, so the revenue loss can be neglected,
while marginal transactions need to use Segwit to properly
adjust the transaction size so that it can be squeezed into
the block, and the loss of size indirectly leads to the loss
of user income. The revenue discount is designed as follows
according to different degrees of loss:

B. PAYMENT MODEL
For any participant i, and for the remaining user k who did
not upload the transaction, the bid price pi increases with the
revenue Wi (Otherwise, users will choose to lower the price
in order to gain more, which is not conducive to the stability
of the trading system); then, if the benefit of i is lower than
that of j, that is Wi < Wj, it has to be explained that there
is no relationship between bid price and revenue with the
result of pi > pj (Otherwise some people will imitate others
to increase their own income). The next step is the establish
process of formula pi.
Set a payment parameter q(k, bk+1,W ), so that when the
user’s revenue is W , there is no difference in the revenue at
location k and k − 1:
dk−1 · (W − q(k, bk+1,W )) = dk · (W − bk+1) (4)
Then,
q(k, bk+1,W ) = W −
dk
dk−1
(W − bk+1) (5)
Let q(k, s,W ) = q(k, bk+1,W ), where bk+1 is the fee
submitted by the last user whose transaction occupies the
(k + 1)th position. This equation holds when s = bk+1, i.e.
the cumulative transaction cost of the transactions after i is
the current transaction itself.
Next step is the proof that the equation p(k, s,W ) =
q(k, s,W ) holds for any parameter, that is q is the exact
payment when there are k participants and the accumulative
transactions cost is s with the revenueW .
1) According to the above analysis, there must be a min-
imum revenue value Wmin, which makes Wmin ≥ bk+1
(Otherwise, some of the remaining k users are bound to
drop out of the following game due to the excessive low
benefit). Therefore, when the revenue of some users is
less thanWmin, they can choose to quit the trading.
2) Next is the discussion on the circumstances of W ≥
Wmin. Assuming that there is revenue of a user is W ≥
Wmin, then the maximum cost paid by the user with
revenue W is equal to the maximum cost of all users,
that is, pmax = max(pi | 0 < i ≤ k). And then
assuming that the revenueW0 of user i is the minimum,
then the payment pi(k, s,W0) of user i is the maximum
cost, that is pi = pmax . Without loss of generality, it can
be assumed that there are many users choose to submit
fees equal to pi or less than pi.

FIGURE 3. Comparison of the saving ratios under static and dynamic
game model.
3) And then to consider what will happen when many
users choose to submit for pi or less. Assuming that
some users will choose to pay their own fees when the
revenue is W0. User i with revenue W0 will continue
to participate in the following game. The next thing to
note is that the payment is the highest for the user ofW0.
a) First of all, assume that user i is not the participant
with highest payment, and let parameter l < k−1,
user i gets the position l with a certain probability.
Consider any continuous processRt ∼ Rtl+2 in the
game, in which the user with the highest transac-
tion cost is the user who submits the transaction at
Rtl+2 (The bid increases with time, the later the bid
is submitted, the higher the price will be, which is
determined by GSP), so at this time, the position
the user gets is l+2, and the bid is pl+2, and user i
will be one of the remaining l+1 members. In the
later bidding process, user i can get position l with
a certain probability.
b) Next is the consideration on variable pi(l +
1, bRtl+2 ,W0). Some users’ bidding price will be
lower than pi. Taking user j as an example to
select the highest revenue W ′, and there must be
W ′ > W0 ≥ bl+2 and also q(l + 1, sl+2,W ′) ≤
pi(l + 1, bRtl+2 ,W0), so we can get:
pi ≥ q
Thus,
p(l + 1, sl+2,W0) ≥ q(l + 1, sl+2,W ′) >
q(l + 1, sl+2,W0) ≥ bl+2
From which we can see that the user i with
the minimum revenue pays highest. And also
p(l + 1, sl+2,W0) of user i is higher than
q(l + 1, sl+2,W0) of user j, so q(W0) is the best
choice.
4) The following is the discussion on p. The revenue of
user i with position l + 1 is αl+1(W0 − bl+2), and with
position l is αl(W0 − bl+1). According to the previous
analysis, we know pi > qj andW0 < W ′, then there is:
αlW0 − pl−1 < αl+1(W0 − pl)
= αl(W0 − q(l + 1, bRtl+2 ,W0))
Supposing the payment is pi − ε, and the probability
of other users bidding between (pi − ε, pi) decreases
with the decrease of the pi, and finally approaches 0.
The revenue is αk (W0 − pk+1) when the payment is
pi − ε, and the revenue is αk−1(W0 − pi(k, s,W0)) <
αk (W0 − pk+1) when choosing pi, which would make
pi − ε the best price for i, but that would violate the
original assumption, so pi is the best choice.
On the basis of the above analysis, the equation
p(k, s,W ) = q(k, s,W ) is true in any case, and for-
mula 5 can be successfully deduced in reverse. Finally,
when there are k users participating in the game, user
i needs to bid p(k, bk+1,W ) with occupying the kth
position and earningW :
p(k, bk+1,W ) = W −

When the GSP dynamic game model is used as the user
payment reference, the calculation formula of user income is
as follows. The discount level of the difference between the
user’s weighted bid cost and the user’s actual payment is taken
as the consideration of user’s revenue in the game.

And the revenue function for participant i is selected ran-

change the transaction price, and the whole system will be
maintained in a stable condition.
IV. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS
This paper aims to establish the dynamic game transaction
model of bitcoin system based on GSP mechanism, then
compare it with the static game model proposed by literature
[13]. We choose the same real transactions in block #567948
as the contrast experiments as the dataset of our experiments.
This block was mined at 04:13 PM on March 20, 2019, and
it is a full block with the size of 1,258,958 bytes.
As shown in figure 2, the left one is the static model
in literature [13] saving 5.12% of transaction costs for all
users, while the dynamic model established in this paper
saves 6.15%, and the transaction saving ratio is shown in the
right photo. And by comparison, it is found that the bidding
rate dk/dk−1 is included in the consideration of each bidding
round in the dynamic game model, which makes the whole
transaction process flow in layers of nested, and has more
capacity of undertaking and self-adjustment.
Figure 3 showsmore specifically the comparison of the two
models’ saving ratios at each stage where the probability of
payment savings are greater than 0.1%. The number of users
in the dynamic game model is 104 when the probability of
payment saving is between 0.1% and 0.2%, while the number
in the static interval is only about 10. The higher the saving
probability is, the lower the number of users will be. But on
the whole, about 424 users can save 0.1% to 0.9% of the
transaction cost submitted by the static game model with the
help of the dynamic game model, and the transaction cost
saving probability of 16 users exceeds 1%. Even under ideal
conditions, the proportion of saved payment for users will be
up to 97.74%.
Figure 4 shows that user revenue under the dynamic model
increases with the increase of revenue discount ρ value.
In the range of [0, 1], different ρ values lead to different user
revenue, and with the increase of ρ, the revenues are on the
rise.
The payoff under dynamic model is obviously lower than
that under static model when the ρ value has little influence.
However, with the gradual increase of ρ, the payoff under
the dynamic model gradually increases, among which, the
transactions at the top of the ranking have a large increase,
while the transactions at the bottom of the ranking surpass
the payoff under the static model.
As can be seen from formula 7, the more active the user
with a better trading experience is, that is, the higher the value
of α is, the more willing the user is to pay a higher price
to continue to participate in the following transactions. Then
the accumulated number of transactions d will also increases,
so that such user will gain a higher income in the long run
under dynamic game model.
Figure 5 shows the changes in the order of transactions.
The order of abscissa represents the Bitcoin transaction
sequence under the existing sorting mechanism, the ordinate
on the left is the new order of transactions under the static
model, and on the right is the new order under the dynamic
model.
The left one is the change of transaction orders under
the static game model, among which 99.76% ranking
positions have changed, with the minimum change range
of 1, accounting for 0.39% of the total trading volume.
At the same time, 5.06% of transaction position changes
are limited to 10, which can be concluded that the over-
all change of the transactions under the static model is
obvious, but the original ordering trend is not affected,
floating up and down in a small range from the original
position.
The right one is the change of transaction orders under
the dynamic game model, among which 78.46% ranking
positions have changed, with theminimum change range of 1,
accounting for 33.23% of the total trading volume. At the
same time, 97.72% transaction position changes are limited to
10, which can be concluded that the positions change stably,
almost consistent with the original order under the dynamic
game model.

By comparing the above two modes, it can be seen that
the dynamic game model can maintain the transaction in the
original state to a greater extent than the static game model.
Therefore, the dynamic game model is not only better than
the static game model in the degree of user cost saving, but
also in maintaining the transaction positions unchanged.
V. CONCLUSION
Considering the particularity of Bitcoin trading system,
we take time series into consideration, compare with tradi-
tional sorting method and static game model, to analyze the
transaction rules of Bitcoin system from the perspective of
multiple cycles and establish a dynamic game model related
to time under GSP mechanism, and also confirm the model’s
superiority on saving users’ fees, compared with the static
game model.
Also, we propose the quantification of the user experience
in this paper quantified by calculating the price difference
between the transactions uploaded by the same user within
adjacent times, which makes the transaction process of the
Bitcoin system no longer the final say of the transaction price,
thus improving the probability of small transactions to get
higher ranking and alleviating the transaction pressure to a
certain extent.
And under the influence of the new raised parameter
revenue discount, user revenue under the dynamic model
increases with the growing of revenue discount value, finally
approach and surpass the revenue under static model.
Our proposed dynamic game model shows that there is a
perfect Bayesian game equilibrium solution in the payment
desicion, so there is no incentive for users to change the
attached fee, and the whole system is maintained stably. In
addition, we verify the dynamic game model from computa-
tional experiment. Firstly, it is proved that with the help of
revenue discount, the cost saving of the dynamic model is
generally higher than that of the static model. Then the user’s
revenue under the dynamic model is showing an upward
trend, and the transactions order under the dynamic model is
more stable than that under static model, which can be illus-
trated mathematically and computationally that the proposed
dynamic game model in this paper will help all transactions
be processed more efficiently in a uniform pipeline.
