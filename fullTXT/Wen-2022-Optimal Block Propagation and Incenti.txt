Abstract—Due to the prominent advantages of decentraliza-
tion, transparency, security, and traceability, blockchain tech-
nologies have attracted ever-increasing attention from academia
and industry, which can be applied to establish secure and
reliable resource sharing platforms for future networks and
applications. Especially, with the promising 6G technology which
has large bandwidth and space-air-ground integrated coverage,
blockchains have been evolved into 6G-enabled blockchain and
envisioned to build various decentralized data and resource man-
agement systems. However, for 6G-enabled wireless blockchain
networks, there still exist many challenges for their development
and prosperity, e.g., large block propagation delay and prop-
agation incentive. Therefore, this paper focuses on addressing
the block propagation challenges. Firstly, inspired by epidemic
models, we classify consensus nodes into five different states
and establish a block propagation model for public blockchains
that depicts block propagation laws. Then, considering consensus
nodes are limited rational, we propose an Incentive Mechanism
based on evolutionary game for Block Propagation (marked
as BPIM) to minimize the block propagation delay. Numerical
results demonstrate that compared with traditional routing
algorithms, BPIM has better block propagation efficiency and
greater incentive strength.

I. INTRODUCTION
Relying on encryption technologies and consensus algo-
rithms of distributed systems, blockchain as a distributed
ledger technology can effectively solve the problem of the
single point of failure and security vulnerabilities caused by
centralized nodes. Since blockchains can achieve cross-domain
trust in a highly distributed system without a trusted center,
they have attracted widespread attention from all walks of life
after their birth, such as smart cities [1], smart healthcare [2],
smart grid [3], and Internet of vehicles [4]–[6]. Therefore,
blockchains are regarded as indispensable technologies for
building trust in future applications and emerging scenarios.
Recently, the promising 6G technology has attracted in-
creasing attention. In contrast with the infrastructure require-

ments of 5G, 6G is a fully connected network integrating
terrestrial and satellite wireless communications for large-scale
coverage, ultra-reliable, and low latency communications [7]–
[9], which enhances the connectivity and flexibility of 5G. As
an integrated space-ground information system, 6G enables
exciting new applications and unprecedented technological
trends, such as multi-sensory XR applications, metaverse [10],
wireless brain-computer interaction, and Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT). For blockchain technologies, 6G can
greatly increase the coverage and bandwidth of blockchain
systems and allow more miners to join public blockchains,
which effectively improves blockchain scalability and achieves
higher-level security and better decentralization.
Although 6G brings attractive benefits to blockchain net-
works [11] [12], the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain networks
have the characteristics of large coverage and high heterogene-
ity, which affects blockchain performance to a certain extent.
Besides, the frequent mobility of miners changes the topology
of wireless blockchains, which increases the uncertainty of
information transmission, thus further increasing block prop-
agation delay. Especially, in public blockchains, new blocks
need to be broadcasted to most miners (or even all miners)
in the entire miner network for verification, thus causing long
propagation time. When block propagation delay is too large,
there may be an excessive number of forks (competitive con-
sensus) [13] or insufficient signatures collection (collaborative
consensus), resulting in the blockchain system malfunction. In
addition, too large propagation delay may significantly prolong
the generation interval of blocks. Hence, to effectively im-
prove the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain network throughput,
block propagation optimization is particularly significant. So
far, a few studies have reduced block propagation delay by
optimizing blockchain network topology [14] [15] and block
verification delay [13] [16], but without considering block
propagation routing optimization.
Moreover, most of existing studies simply assume that
miners cooperate to share their resources during service pro-
vision without considering the miners’ rationality. Actually,
there may be competition for resource benefits among smart
devices (i.e., miners) in the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain
network. So when studying block propagation optimization

for 6G-enable wireless blockchain networks, it is necessary to
establish an efficient incentive mechanism to promote miners
to propagate blocks actively and reduce block propagation
delay efficiently [17] [18].
Motivated by the above observations, this paper aims to
establish a theoretical model of block propagation for public
blockchains without changing the network topology and find
out factors that affect the performance of blockchain to achieve
block propagation optimization under the security require-
ments. The main contributions of this paper are summarized
as follows:
• We classify consensus nodes into five different states
by analyzing the block propagation process and inven-
tively establish a block propagation model for public
blockchains inspired by epidemic models.
• From the perspectives of block verification and block
propagation, we establish an incentive mechanism based
on evolutionary game for block propagation considering
the rationality of miners and analyze the behavior of
miners based on evolutionary game.
• We conduct extensive simulations on the block propa-
gation model and the incentive mechanism to verify the
efficiency improvement of block propagation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II introduces the block propagation model for public
blockchains and the incentive mechanism based on evolution-
ary game for block propagation to achieve block propagation
optimization. Section III conducts experimental simulations
of the two models to reveal the underlying laws of block
propagation. Section IV concludes the whole paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain network, mobile
users at the physical layer are connected in a P2P manner.
The transactions between them will be packaged into blocks,
and the blocks are propagated in the miner network in the
form of rumor mongering [19]. To be specific, when a miner
completes the verification of a new block, it randomly selects
k adjacent miners and forwards the new block to them. When
the miners receive the block, they will first verify the block.
If the verification is successful, they will also randomly select
k adjacent miners for propagation, otherwise, the block will
be discarded. Finally, whether the block can be successfully
added to the blockchain depends on the verification results of
all miners. To better study the block propagation process, the
mobile users of the physical layer are treated as miner nodes
at the network layer, as shown in Fig. 1.
A. Block Propagation Model for Public Blockchains
Since the block propagation process is similar to the spread
of infectious diseases, inspired by epidemic models [20], a
block propagation model for public blockchains is constructed.
By analyzing the block propagation mechanism in the public
blockchain, consensus nodes (i.e., miner nodes) can be classi-
fied into five different states: ignorants, spreaders, unspreaders,
refusers, and evildoers.
Fig. 1: 6G-enabled wireless blockchain block propagation model.
More specifically, ignorants are initial nodes that have not
received the block. Spreaders mean that nodes have received
the block and verified the block is successful, and the block
will be forwarded to k adjacent nodes. Unspreaders mean
that nodes have received the block but failed to verify the
block, and they will refuse to forward the block to adjacent
nodes, which can avoid wasting network resources. Refusers
are immune nodes, which means that nodes have received the
block, and when the block is received again, the block is not
forwarded but discarded. Spreaders and unspreaders become
refusers with a probability of 1
k [21]. Evildoers are malicious
nodes, which means that destroy the benefits of most nodes in
the system, such as directly forwarding unverified blocks, Sybil
Attack, etc. When each round of interaction starts, ignorants
will misbehave with a certain probability. When each round
of interaction ends, evildoers will return to being normal with
a certain probability. According to [20], a state transition
diagram of the block propagation model is shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2: A state transition diagram of SIUER model.
Considering that a network has N nodes, it can be regarded
as an undirected graph G(V,E), where V is the set of
vertices and E is the set of edges. As shown in Fig. 2,
there is a conversion relationship between nodes. The specific

conversion rules are described as follows:
• When ignorants receive a block forwarded from spread-
ers, ignorants will verify the block. If the verification is
successful, ignorants will be converted to spreaders with
probability λ. Otherwise, ignorants will be converted to
unspreaders with probability μ, where λ is forwarding
probability, μ is non-forwarding probability, and the sum
of λ and μ is 1.
• When each round of interaction starts, ignorants will be
converted to evildoers with probability β. When each
round of interaction ends, evildoers will be converted to
ignorants with probability α, where β is evil probability,
and α is recovery probability.
• When spreaders and unspreaders receive the block again,
or after each interaction, spreaders and unspreaders are
converted to refusers with probability 1
k , where 1
k is
immunity probability.
Suppose i(t), s(t), u(t), r(t), and e(t) represent the pro-
portion of ignorants, spreaders, unspreaders, refusers, and
evildoers at time t, respectively. They satisfy the following
condition: [20]
i(t) + s(t) + u(t) + r(t) + e(t) = 1. (1)
According to Fig. 2, the variation of i(t) at Δt can be
obtained as follows:
N [i(t+Δt)− i(t)] = αNe(t)Δt− βNi(t)Δt
− kλ(1− β)Ns(t)i(t)Δt
− kμ(1− β)Ns(t)i(t)Δt.
(2)
⇐⇒
i(t+Δt)− i(t)
Δt
= αe(t)− βi(t)− kλ(1− β)s(t)i(t)
− kμ(1− β)s(t)i(t).
(3)
Take the limit of Δt → 0 on both sides at the same time,
we can get
di(t)
dt
= αe(t)− βi(t)− kλ(1− β)s(t)i(t)
− kμ(1− β)s(t)i(t).
(4)
The other differential equations can be calculated by the
above process. So the differential equation system of the block
propagation model for public blockchains can be obtained:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩

B. Incentive Mechanism Based on Evolutionary Game for
Block Propagation
For the reason that the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain
networks have the characteristics of large coverage and high
heterogeneity, miners are difficult to choose the best strategy in
a complex environment for maximizing their benefits, and the
behavior of miners is limited rational, so miners often make
relatively satisfactory decisions based on the local information
they have. Evolutionary game theory can help miners only
consider the limited benefits in the block propagation process,
and the behavior of miners will evolve to the final stable state
in the process of continuous trials and errors, which is called
evolutionary stable strategy [22]. Based on the evolutionary
stable strategy, we can better formulate reasonable optimiza-
tion strategies and make blocks propagate rapidly and steadily
to the miner network.
Therefore, we propose an Incentive Mechanism based on
evolutionary game for Block Propagation (marked as BPIM).
We study the changes in forwarding probability under the
action of the incentive mechanism and find the optimal strat-
egy combination, which can optimize the block propagation
mechanism and better achieve the overall network consensus.
Considering all the miners are limited rational, block prop-
agation decisions simultaneously move in a game where one
party takes an action without knowing the strategy the other
party is taking, that is, when deciding on their actions, it is
inferred that other parties will also act rationally.
1) Payoff matrix of evolutionary game: The consensus
nodes essentially can be divided into two groups, namely
block propagators (i.e., spreaders) and block receivers (i.e.,
nodes other than spreaders), and the characteristics of these
two groups are consistent.
We define that Q is block verification cost, and P is
block verification reward. Since block verification is performed
before block propagation, it is assumed that P is greater than
Q for the convenience of research. Besides, we define that
M is block propagation cost, and I is block propagation
reward. If and only if block receivers propagate the block,
both block propagators and block receivers can receive the
block propagation reward.
In this subsection, an evolutionary game matrix will be es-
tablished for the participants of block propagation. The miners’
action strategies are whether to propagate the block, and their
revenue functions are the actual benefit of block verification
plus the actual benefit of block propagation. The following
four cases of the evolutionary game will be analyzed.
• When block propagators forward the block, and block
receivers also forward the block, both block propagators
and block receivers will receive the block propagation
reward, in which block propagators’ revenue functions are
(P −Q+I−M), and block receivers’ revenue functions
also are (P −Q+ I −M).
• When block propagators forward the block, but block
receivers do not forward the block, block propagators will
not get the block propagation reward even propagating the

block, in which their revenue functions are (P −Q−M),
and block receivers’ revenue functions are (P −Q).
• When block propagators do not forward the block, but
block receivers forward the block, the logic does not hold,
so this situation does not exist.
• When block propagators do not forward the block, and
block receivers do not forward the block, block propaga-
tors’ revenue functions are (P −Q), and block receivers’
revenue functions are 0.
Assume that the forwarding probability of block propagators
is x, and the non-forwarding probability is (1 − x). The
forwarding probability of block receivers is y, and the non-
forwarding probability is (1 − y), where x, y is consistent
with λ described above. According to the analysis of the evo-
lutionary game, the benefit matrix between block propagators
and block receivers in public blockchains can be obtained, as
shown in Table I.
2) Revenue function of block participants: Assume that the
expected revenues of block propagators forwarding the block
and non-forwarding the block are G1Y and G1N , respectively,
and the group average revenue is G1, then:
G1Y = y(P −Q+ I −M) + (1− y)(P −Q−M)
= yI + P −Q−M.
(7)
G1N = (1− y)(P −Q). (8)
G1 = xG1Y + (1− x)G1N
= xyI + x(P −Q−M) + (1− x)(1− y)(P −Q).
(9)
Similarly, the expected revenues of block receivers forward-
ing the block and non-forwarding the block are G2Y and G2N ,
respectively, and the group average revenue is G2, then:
G2Y = x(P −Q−M). (10)
G2N = x(P −Q). (11)
G2 = xy(P −Q−M) + x(1− y)(P −Q). (12)
3) Replication dynamic equation for forwarding probabil-
ity: The replication dynamic equation for forwarding proba-
bility of block propagators is:
H(x) =
dx
dt
= x(G1Y −G1) = x(1− x)[y(I + P −Q)−M ].
(13)
• If y = M
I+P−Q , then H(x) ≡ 0, and all levels are stable.
• If y �= M
I+P−Q , let H(x) = 0, then x = 0 and x = 1 are
the two stable values of x, and the derivative of H(x)
with respect of x can be obtained:
dH(x)
dx
= (1− 2x)[y(I + P −Q)−M ]. (14)
Due to the requirement of evolutionary stable strategy
dH(x)
dx < 0, comparing the relationship between y and M
I+P−Q ,
the following insights can be obtained:
Insight 1. When y > M
I+P−Q
, then dH(x)
dx
< 0, and
x = 1 is the equilibrium point. When I � P−Q+M
2
or
M � (I +P −Q), then M
I+P−Q
≈ 0, and y > M
I+P−Q
is always established.
Insight 2. When y < M
I+P−Q
, then dH(x)
dx
< 0, and
x = 0 is the equilibrium point. When (I+P −Q) < M ,
then M
I+P−Q
> 1, and y < M
I+P−Q
is always established.
Similarly, the replication dynamic equation for forwarding
probability of block receivers is:
H(y) =
dy
dt
= y(G2Y −G2) = xy(y − 1)(M − I). (15)
• If M = I or x = 0, then H(x) ≡ 0, and all levels are
stable.
• If M �= I and x �= 0, let H(y) = 0, then y = 0 and
y = 1 are the two stable values of y, and the derivation
of H(y) with respect to y can be obtained:
dH(y)
dy
= x(M − I)(2y − 1). (16)
Since x > 0, the following insights can be obtained:
Insight 3. When M < I , then dH(y)
dy
< 0, and y = 1
is the equilibrium point.
Insight 4. When M > I , then dH(y)
dy
< 0, and y = 0
is the equilibrium point.
Fig. 3: A diagram of evolutionary game coordinates of miners.
4) Game equilibrium analysis: Based on the above game
solutions, the following equilibrium states can be obtained, as
shown in Fig. 3.
• When the initial state falls in area two, if (I+P−Q) > 0
and M < I , the final game result between block propa-
gators and block receivers is (forwarding, forwarding).
• When the initial state falls in area two, if (I+P−Q) > 0
and M > I , the game result of block propagators and
block receivers at the beginning is (forwarding, non-
forwarding). However, since block receivers do not for-
ward the block, block propagators have to bear the block
propagation cost but cannot obtain the block propagation
reward, so the game result between block propagators and
372

block receivers gradually evolves into (non-forwarding,
non-forwarding).
• When the initial state falls in area one, if (I+P−Q) > 0
and M > I , then x = 0 and y = 0, and the final game
result between block propagators and block receivers is
(non-forwarding, non-forwarding).
To sum up, when the game result of miners is in the first
equilibrium state, the block can be better propagated among
the miners. Therefore, the whole network verification can be
completed faster and the consensus of the whole network can
be reached more quickly.
III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Simulation Setting
To provide a theoretical basis for improving the efficiency
of block propagation, we evaluate BPIM performance and
analyze block propagation laws in this section. First, compare
BPIM performance with traditional routing algorithms that
do not consider incentive mechanisms. Second, study the
influence of some significant parameters on block propagation
and summarize the propagation laws. The key parameter
configuration is shown in Table II [20].
TABLE II: Key Parameters in the Simulation.
Parameters Value
Total number of nodes N 4000
Adjacent node selection number k 2∼4
Forwarding probability λ 0.2∼1
Non-forwarding probability μ 0∼0.8
Evil probability β 0.2∼1
Recovery probability α 0.3
Block propagation reward I 0∼1
Block propagation cost M 0∼1
Block verification reward P 0∼1
Block verification cost Q 0∼1
We compare the proposed BPIM with following two other
routing algorithms as follows.
• Greedy Routing. Block propagators only consider their
current best benefits of themselves but do not consider
the impact of their own propagation behavior on the block
propagation in the miner network.
• Random Routing. Block propagators do not consider the
role of the incentive mechanism and randomly select
adjacent nodes to propagate the block.
B. Result Discussion
Fig. 4 shows the forwarding probability of BPIM, random
routing, and greedy routing during block broadcast. As each
round of interaction continues, the forwarding probability
corresponding to each routing algorithm increases. Besides
greedy routing that performs best as expected, BPIM is always
ahead of random walk in forwarding probability. Moreover, the
greater the incentive strength, the greater the growth rate of
the forwarding probability of BPIM. For example, the green
line (i.e., incentive strength I/M = 2) means that it takes
about 35 epochs for the forwarding probability to reach the
maximum value, while the blue line (i.e., incentive strength
I/M = 4) shows that it only takes about 15 epochs for the
forwarding probability to reach the maximum value.
Fig. 5 illustrates how the density of refusers changes over
time for different forwarding probability λ. We can find that
as time grows up, the density of refusers corresponding to
different λ increases. The larger λ, the faster the number of
refusers grows, and the larger the number of refusers in the
end, which indicates that the higher the forwarding probability,
the more consensus nodes will complete the verification and
reach a consensus faster. Therefore, the performance of BPIM
is better than that of random routing. The reason is that under
the action of the incentive mechanism, block propagators will
consider their benefits to select appropriate adjacent nodes
instead of randomly selecting adjacent nodes to propagate
blocks, which is not only conducive to improving the effi-
ciency of block propagation but also avoids the problem of
block retransmission. However, greedy routing only considers
the local optimality of propagation, which is bound to greatly
increase the redundancy of blocks in the network. To sum up,
the overall performance of BPIM is better than that of random
routing and greedy routing.
Fig. 6 shows how the density of evildoers changes over
time for different k. We can see that no matter what the
value of k is, the number of evildoers increases first and
then decreases. It shows that in the beginning, most ignorants
want to gain greater benefits by doing evil. However, with the
gradual expansion of the consensus scale, the cost of doing evil
increases, resulting in a decrease in the number of evildoers.
Besides, the larger k, the smaller the number of evildoers,
the reason is that due to the increase in the number of nodes
participating in the consensus, the degree of decentralization
of the network is enhanced, resulting in the cost of doing evil
increases, thus reducing the number of evildoers.
Fig. 7 illustrates how the density of spreaders changes
over time for different evil probability β. We can see that
the smaller β, the larger the number of spreaders, and when
β exceeds a certain threshold, there are no more spreaders
in the network. The reason is that reducing the number
of evildoers will help more ignorants turn into spreaders,
therefore, blockchain systems can use a reasonable punishment
mechanism that increases the cost of doing evil to reduce the
evil probability, thereby increasing the number of block prop-
agators and speeding up the efficiency of block propagation.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have analyzed the block propagation
mechanism in the 6G-enabled wireless blockchain network.
Inspired by epidemic models, we have classified the consensus
nodes of the network into five different states and established
a block propagation model for public blockchains to reveal
block propagation laws. Then, we have proposed an incentive
mechanism based on evolutionary game for block propagation
after analyzing the behavior of limited rational miners. Finally,
numerical results have demonstrated that the proposed mech-
anism can accelerate block propagation and reach a consensus
