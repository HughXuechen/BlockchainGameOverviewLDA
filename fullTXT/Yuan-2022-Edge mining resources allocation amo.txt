Abstract
Blockchain is a promising technology that may act as a distributed ledger for Inter-
net of Things (IoT). To maintain blockchain and save operation cost, IoT nodes may 
play roles of miners (who generate or mine blocks), by renting mining rigs from 
edge computing service providers. During the mining process, miners will receive 
rewards, while these rewards incentivize miners to keep mining in turn. However, if 
the rewards are insufficient, there might be a gap time where no miners participate 
in mining. We call a blockchain without a gap time a normal chain and a gap chain 
otherwise. This paper is the first to investigate the allocation of edge computing 
resources when normal and gap chains coexist. In this paper, we propose a normal 
gap game to model the allocation over the two types of blockchains which was never 
proposed before. In our game, miners compete with each other to maximize their 
respective utilities, by determining the per chain shares and the starting time of their 
mining rigs. We then develop a calculation framework, which factors in various sys-
tem parameters to quantify the investment and allocation of mining rigs. We finally 
evaluate the miners’ utilities under different scenarios. This study is very helpful to 
assist miners for reasonable investment and allocation of edge computing resources.

1 Introduction
A blockchain is a growing list of blocks, each storing data such as commercial trans-
action. In permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin [1] and Ethereum [2]), anyone 
can send his transactions to the blockchain P2P network for storage in the blockchain 
system or become a miner who participates in maintaining the blockchain system.

Edge mining resources allocation among normal and gap…
Miner often needs to consume computing powers to solve a cryptographic puzzle 
and the puzzle solver will collect and verify transactions, create blocks, etc. Per-
missionless blockchains offer economic incentives for miners to secure and main-
tain the blockchain system. When creating a block successfully, a miner will receive 
block rewards (i.e., newly, minted cryptocurrencies) and transaction fees (i.e., the 
fee received from transaction creators for packing transactions into blocks).
However, in future, the block rewards may be decreased, or the transaction fees 
might be insufficient. For example, according to the Bitcoin system, the initial block 
reward is 50 BTC. The block reward then halves every 210,000 blocks roughly every 
4 years and will be 3.125 BTC in 2024. If the received income is large than the cost 
due to mining (i.e., maintaining the blockchain), miners may stop mining for a time 
duration and then continue when the economic incentives are sufficient. As a result, 
there might be a gap time where no miners participate in mining. In this paper, we 
call a blockchain without a gap time a normal chain and a gap chain otherwise. For 
example, in a normal chain (as shown in Fig. 1a), the blockchain interval (i.e., the 
interval between two consecutive blocks) only consists of mining time (in which 
there are always miners that keep mining). In contrast, in a gap chain (as shown in 
Fig. 1b), the blockchain interval consist of gap time and mining time.
1.1  Motivation
Normal chains generally provide high incentives that attract lots of miners for min-
ing, but it leads to highly competitive intensity; as a result, miners might receive 
lower rewards than expected return. In contrast, gap chains provide less incentives, 
miners might receive commensurate rewards proportional to their invested comput-
ing resources, due to low competitive intensity. One challenging problem is how to 
rationally allocate miming resources so as to maximize miners’ utility (i.e., profit). 
This problem motivates this study.
1.2  Contribution
To date, some researchers considered mining resource allocation among multiple 
normal chains [3–6], while the others focused on the gap chain only to study its 
security and the revenue of its miners [7–9]. To our knowledge, nobody studies the 
mining resource allocation when normal and gap chains coexist. This paper aims 
at doing so. Different from normal chains, gap chains have their inherently salient

features such as the gap time and the starting time of mining rigs. Therefore, the 
existing mining resource allocation approach among multiple normal chains might 
not be applicable for that among normal and gap chains. Our main contributions are 
as follows.
• Propose a gap normal game to model the mining competition among miners of 
normal and gap chains. Our game factors in various system parameters such as 
the reward, the number of miners and rigs, and the arrival rate of transactions, to 
calculate the resource allocations of these mining rigs.
• Develop a calculation framework to search the equilibrium point where any 
miner cannot improve its utility by changing his allocation of mining rigs. Our 
framework is general and applicable for heterogeneous settings (i.e., each miner 
has different parameter settings).
• Evaluate miners’ utility extensively, under homogeneous and heterogeneous set-
tings. This study is very helpful to design better incentive mechanisms and pro-
vide theoretical guidance for rational mining resource investment and allocation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related works. 
Section 3 presents the system model. Section 4 proposes the gap normal game. Sec-
tion 5 develops the calculation framework to search the equilibrium point. Section 6 
evaluates miners’ utility. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper.
2  Related work
In different scenarios, the distribution of miners’ mining power will be different. 
The blockchain mining scenario can be roughly divided into multi-chain and single-
chain. The focus of this paper is the mining power allocation scheme for miners in 
multi-chain mining. In addition, the declining base reward have an impact on the 
nature of the blockchain. Below, we present related works in terms of mining power 
distribution and the impact of base reward.
2.1  Mining power allocation in single blockchain
A large number of related works are concentrated on the allocation of mining power 
on the normal chain. In [10], Kiayias et al. mentioned that dishonest miners would 
not publish new blocks immediately but wait for a period of time to publish, arti-
ficially causing the blockchain to fork. This means that dishonest miners need to 
determine the mining power and consider the release time of new blocks to get 
the maximum benefit. In [11], Wang et  al. investigated the transition of comput-
ing power. This work believes that when miners are unprofitable on one blockchain, 
they can quickly transfer computing power to another blockchain. In [12], Wei 
et al. designed a mining scheme for miners that can apply the computing power of 
mining rigs to big data calculations. Miners can provide computing power to the 
cloud computing platform to obtain benefits when the digital currency market is not

good. They believe that, compared with miners who fully invest their computing 
power into the blockchain, miners will get better returns and lower risks under the 
new mining scheme. In [13], Chiu et  al. found that miners tend to allocate com-
puting power to blockchains where transactions are active and proposed an incen-
tive scheme to reduce transaction fees without affecting miners’ enthusiasm. In [14], 
Li et al. analyzed the impact of the mining pool’s revenue distribution mechanism 
on the distribution of miners’ mining power and calculated the equilibrium state of 
competition between mining pools.
2.2  Mining power allocation among multiple blockchains
In [3], Xiong et al. found that many miners are using cloud mining, that is, renting 
equipment from cloud computing providers for blockchain mining. This work ana-
lyzes the game relationship between suppliers and miners and then calculates min-
ers’ computing power’s distribution scheme under equilibrium state. In [4], Chen 
et  al. studied cloud mining and introduced the discriminatory pricing strategy of 
cloud computing providers. That is, different miners face different computing power 
prices. In [5], Wu et al. believed that miners could not observe the change of com-
puting power in the blockchain system in time, so they used incomplete information 
game to analyze the cloud mining scenario and tried to simulate the decision-mak-
ing process of miners by using reinforcement learning. In [6], Fan et al. believed that 
besides cloud computing providers, the computing power of cloud mining comes 
from edge computing. That is, other individual users directly rent their equipment 
to miners for mining operations. Edge computing leads to a game between suppli-
ers and many individual computing power providers, which can significantly reduce 
miners’ mining costs.
2.3  The affective of declining base reward
In [8], Jiang et al. believed that after the base reward is reduced, the miners tend 
to mine larger blocks because they contain more transactions and fee reward. 
They also pointed out that the current block size 4MB does not meet the lower 
limit of miners’ income. In [15], Liu et al. defined the mining model in the gap 
chain and focused on the impact of changes in base reward on mining pools. 
They believe that the reduction of base reward greatly weak the mining power 
of pools and have a serious impact on the security of the blockchain. In [16], Di 
et al. showed a new consensus game model, studied the conditions and timing of 
gaps in the blockchain and discussed the existence of gaps when the difficulty of 
mining is dynamically adjusted. They believe that the mismatch of information 
between miners creates a potential “cooperation,” which leads to gaps even if the 
basic reward changes little. In [17], Gong et al. studied a special security risk in 
a blockchain with low base reward and insufficient fee reward. They believed that 
attackers can attract miners to mine on forged side chains by publishing a large 
number of transactions that contain large fees, thereby realizing double-spending 
attacks. In [18], Arenas et  al. studied the relationship between the base reward 
9938 J. Yuan et al.
1 3
and the fork rate, and pointed out that when the base reward is low, miners with 
higher mining power tend to mine on the fork/side chain, which results in more 
serious fork conflict.
3  System model
In this section, we present our system model which is used to analyze miners’ 
resources allocation among gap and normal blockchains. Figure 2 illustrates the 
system model. There are one edge computing service provider (ESP) and two 
blockchains, where the two blockchains include a normal blockchain and a gap 
blockchain. The ESP leases rigs to miners and collects rent. Each miner allocates 
his rented mining rigs to two blockchains and obtains mining rewards. We set the 
system as quasi-static. This means that our system model consists of a fixed set of 
miners and the ESP provides a fixed set of rigs. Each miner controls at least one 
rig, and each rig is controlled by only one miner. The rig has two states: off and 
on. Each miner assigns a blockchain and start time for each of his rigs. When a 
rig works on normal chain, its start time is 0.
After the rig is turned on, the time required to find a valid block is exponen-
tially distributed with a fixed rate parameter, which is shared among all rigs[19]. 
Therefore, the time it takes to find a block is the minimum of all finding times by 
all rigs. The value of the rate parameter is determined by the cryptocurrency pro-
tocol so that the expected block interval has a constant value. The rate parameter 
indicates the difficulty of the PoW puzzle. If blocks are found too fast (too slow), 
the protocol changes the difficulty parameter to reduce (increase) the rate of each 
individual rig. In our system model, the rate is fixed. Once a block is found, all 
miners continue to find the next block and repeat this process indefinitely.
The utility of miners is the total income minus total cost. The total income 
of miners is the sum of the mining rewards of the two blockchains. The total 
cost of the miners is the rent of all rigs paid to the ESP. The rent of rigs is billed 
by time, that is, ESP starts to charge the rigs when their status are on[20]. Note 
that miners need to pay rent, regardless of whether they successfully find a new 
block. Rational miners make arrangements to maximize their utility, thus creating 
a game.

4  The proposed approach
In this section, we first theoretically define the noncooperative gap normal 
game (NGG), then analyze the utility and finally design the equilibrium search 
algorithm.
4.1  Game formulation
The repeated process of searching for blocks is a series of one-shot competitions, 
in which only the winner can get the reward each time, and all miners pay the 
cost[7]. In order to infer the expected utility, rather than consider a single itera-
tion we consider a one-shot game played by the miners. The player’s strategy is 
to select the blockchain and startup time for each rig. Miners competes with each 
other by adjusting their strategies to maximize his utility. We define this game as
where n is the set of miners, 
{
xi
}
i∈n
 is the strategy set and 
{
ui
}
i∈n
 is the utilities of 
miners. We define the set of mining rigs controlled by miner i as Ri . Furthermore, 
there are kn normal chains and kg gap chains in k blockchains in our system, where 
kn + kg = k . The miner’s strategy includes the number of rigs on each blockchain Rik 
and the rigs’ startup time sik on each blockchain. Therefore, the strategy set of miner 
i is xi∈n =
{
Ri, si
}
 , where
For the convenience of calculation, we normalize sik , namely sik =
start time
block interval
 . Also 
we assume that all the mining rigs on the normal chain have a startup time of 0, 
says, start mining from the moment the previous block was generated. After the rig 
is turned on, the time required to find the block is exponentially distributed with the 
rate parameter �(s) . Each mining rig costs c which is the price from the ESP per 
time unit if it is turned on.
4.2  Utility
The total utility of miner i is the combination of its utility on multiple block-
chains, that is to say, its total income minus total expenditure[23]. The income 
consists of two parts, namely block base reward and transaction fee reward. The 
cost is determined by the mining rig rental set by ESP and the time for miners 
to rent the rig. There are continuous transactions in the blockchain system, and 
according to early research and experimental observations, the number of trans-
actions in the system is proportional to time. Therefore, we assume that the fee

reward increases linearly with time, expressed as utx ⋅ t , where utx is the growth 
rate of transaction fee. Finally, the utility of the miner on a blockchain can be 
roughly expressed as:
where ubase represents the base reward, utx ⋅ t represents the transaction fee and c rep-
resents the rent to be paid for renting the mining rigs.
In order to calculate the utility of miners, we first need to analyze the probability 
of successful mining. Let us start with the distribution of the probability of a single 
rig mining on a gap blockchain k. Denote the time this rig costs for finding a block 
as a random variable Tk . According to the blockchain protocol, the mining rate of 
a single rig on blockchain k is �(k) . The value of Tk can be obtained by the shifted 
exponential distribution, with a shift of sk and rate �(k).
The PDF of Tk is
and its CDF is
Since
we get that
In the process of finding the new block, all rigs compete with each other. The rig 
with the minimal value of Tk is the discoverer of the new block. We define the set 
of mining rigs that started by miner i at time t on blockchain k as activeik(t) and 
activek(t) to be the set of all active rigs at time t on this blockchain. Note that 
activek(t) =
⋃n
i=1
activeik(t) . Each miner independently sets the startup time for his 
rigs. The probability that none of all rigs have found a new block of blockchain k 
by time t, Prk(T ≥ t) , is the product of Prk
(
Tk ≥ t
)
 for all rigs, because rigs are inde-
pendent of each other. This probability is shown as
The CDF of T is therefore

and the derivative is its PDF
As expected, when activek(t) = ∅ , then fT
(
t;s;�k
)
= 0 . This means that when no rig 
is working on blockchain k, the probability of finding a new block at any time t is 0.
Recall that once the mining rig is turned on, the time it takes to find a new 
block follows an exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is memo-
ryless, which means that the elapsed time does not affect the rate of finding 
blocks. Since all rigs have the same rate�k , at any time, all the rigs that have been 
started have the same chance of finding a new block. The probability of a specific 
active rig to find a new block is one divided by the number of all active rigs. If a 
new block of blockchain k is discovered at time t, since each player controls mul-
tiple rigs, the probability of player i finding a new block is its number of active 
rigs divided by the number of all active rigs. We define the ratio of the mining 
power of miner i on blockchain k at time t as �ik(t) =
∣ active ik(t)∣
∣ active k(t)∣
4.2.1  The utility of gap chain
When miner i finds a new block of gap blockchain k at time t, its expected income 
is
ESP charges miners according to the startup time of mining rigs. For each rig, the 
cost is proportional to the time. At time t, rig j with start time sj has been active for 
t − sj time. Sum the active time of all mining rigs controlled by player i, and multi-
ply by the rent price set by ESP to calculate the total cost at time t. If a new block is 
found at time t, the cost of player i is expected to be
where p is the price controlled by the ESP.
The miner’s expected utility on gap chain k is his expected income minus 
expected expenses. We can calculate that when a new block is found at time t, 
then the expected utility of player i at this time is

In order to calculate the utility of a miner, we need to use the full expectation for-
mula and PDF of T; then, the expected utility on blockchain k of miner i at time t is
We substitute (9) into (13), then substitute (10) and (11) into (12), and finally substi-
tute (12) into (13) to calculate the utility of miner i on gap blockchain k
4.2.2  The utility of normal chain
When miner i finds a new block of normal blockchain k at time t, its expected 
income is (10). Since there is no gap in the normal chain, the miner always contin-
ues mining at the moment when the previous block is released; that is, the startup 
time is 0. If a new block is found at time t, the cost of player i at this time is
where p is the price controlled by the ESP. The miner’s expected utility on normal 
chain k is his expected income minus expected expenses. When a new block is found 
at time t, then the expected utility of player i at this time is (12). In order to calculate 
the utility of i, we also need to use the full expectation formula and PDF of T; then, 
the expected utility on blockchain k of miner i at time t is (13). Finally, we substitute 
(9) into (13), then substitute (10) and (11) into (12), and finally substitute (12) into 
(13) to calculate the utility of miner i on normal blockchain k. The utility can be

5  Calculation of equilibrium
Given the utility functions (15) and (17) defined in Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, we apply 
an search algorithm to investigate the equilibrium. Given the price p decided by the 
ESP, miners’ rigs set, the miners compete with each other to maximize their own 
utility by setting the number of rigs on each blockchain Rik and the rigs’ startup 
time sik on each blockchain, which forms NGG. In the process of NGG, when each 
miners’ utility cannot be improved no matter how his strategy is changed, the game 
reaches equilibrium. We present Algorithm 1 to search the equilibrium of NGG. All 
miners repeat Algorithm 1 until reach an equilibrium state. 
Next we show the specific details of Algorithm 1. Before a miner create his strat-
egy, he needs to observe other miners’ strategies x( − 1) first as the input. In order to 
find the set of strategies with the greatest utility, miners need to calculate the utility 
of all possible strategies. In lines 1-2, the miner tries to arrange the number of rigs 
on different blockchains. If the blockchain k is a gap chain, the startup time needs 
to be set, which is reflected in line 5. After the arrangement is completed, the miner 
calculates the utility of the current strategy, using formula (14) for the gap chain 
and formula (15) for the normal chain. If the utility of the current strategy is greater 
9944 J. Yuan et al.

than the maximum utility, the maximum utility is updated and the current strategy 
is recorded. If the utility of the current strategy cannot exceed the maximum utility, 
the strategy set is reset. The algorithm finds the strategy with the highest utility after 
traversing all the strategies. Each miner runs Algorithm 1 in turn until the results 
of all miners are the same as the previous run. When the algorithm terminates, any 
miner cannot obtain higher utilities by changing the strategy, which achieves the 
Nash equilibrium. The convergence of the algorithm will be shown in detail in the 
next performance evaluation.
6  Performance evaluation
We design two different scenarios to verify the performance of the model and algo-
rithm. In the first scenario, the miners have the same number of mining rigs, and in 
the second scenario, the number of miners’ rigs is different. Next, we present the 
performance of miners in the two scenarios.
6.1  Data set
The data set used to evaluate the performance of miners is generated by a blockchain 
simulation program. The program contains multiple blockchains and multiple min-
ers. We set the mining difficulty and rewards of each blockchain and the number of 
rigs owned by each miner. Each iteration of the simulation program will calculate 
the corresponding utility of all the strategies of each miner and select the strategy 
with the highest utility for the next iteration. When any miner cannot improve his 
utility by adjusting his strategy, the program terminates and outputs a complete data 
set. The data set includes all the strategies and utilities of the miners during each 
iteration.
6.2  Scenario one—homogeneous miners
We set a scenario including a normal chain and a gap chain. There are 4 players with 
50 rigs each in the game, and each player competes with each other for the maxi-
mum utility by arranging how many rigs mining on the gap chain and the startup 
time of the gap chain rigs. The value of cost p set by ESP is 1. We have performed 
multiple calculations with different sets of ubase and utx.
First, we observe the strategy space of miners from a global perspective. Miners 
need to choose the most effective strategy from the strategy space to get the most 
benefits. Figure  3 shows a global strategy space diagram, where the x-axis is the 
startup time of the gap chain rigs, the y-axis is the number of normal chain rigs and 
the z-axis is the utility. It is not difficult to see that the strategy space in Fig. 3 is 
convex, and the max utility is in the brightest area, which verifies the existence and 
uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium.
Next, we evaluate the relationship between the number of each miner’ rigs and 
the utility. As shown in Fig.  5, as the number of rigs increases, the utility first

increases and then decreases. At first, the increase of rigs increased the probability 
of finding new blocks, so the utility is greatly improved. As the number of rigs con-
tinues to increase, competition among miners has become more intense, and renting 
more rigs requires paying more rent to the ESP, so the utility begins to decrease.
Furthermore, we adjust the base reward of the normal chain so that the basic 
reward increased linearly. Figure 4 shows that as the base reward increases, the 
number of mining rigs on the normal chain increases. It is worth noting that in 
the initial state, the number of mining rigs in the two blockchains is equal, but in 
the later stage, there are almost no rigs working on the gap chain. If we continue 
to increase the base rewards of the normal chain, there will be no rigs working on 
the gap chain. Finally, as the number of rigs owned by each miner increases, the

average startup time of rigs in the gap chain increases, as shown in Fig. 6. Please 
note that under our computing framework, miners need to set the startup time for 
each gap chain mining rig, which means that the startup time of rigs may be dif-
ferent. The reason for this status is that the increase in the number of rigs on the 
gap chain makes the block interval short and thus the fee reward, which forces 
miners to reduce the working time of the rigs to increase their utility.

6.3  Scenario two—heterogeneous miners
We set up a heterogeneous miner scenario, in other words, the number of miners 
owned by the miners is different. Except for the miner, the other settings are the 
same as scenario one. The number of mining rigs of the 4 miners are 80, 60, 40 and 
20. The total amount of rigs is the same as in scenario one. Under different block-
chain parameters, we have performed multiple repeated calculations to evaluate the 
performance of the computing framework. Due to the heterogeneity of miners, the 
data we obtained are quite different from scenario one.
First, we evaluate the impact of the normal chain’s base reward on the distribu-
tion of miners’ mining power. It can be clearly seen that as the reward increases, the 
mining power allocated by the miners on the gap chain shows a downward trend, 
especially when the base reward reaches 1000. Furthermore, Fig. 9 shows that the 
No. 1 and No. 2 miner with more mining rigs did not immediately put resources into 
the normal chain when the base reward increased. The reason for this situation is 
that the competition of the normal chain increases with the increase of rewards, and 
the income of a single rig decreases as the competition intensifies, and the miners 
with more rigs are more affected.
Next, we evaluated the impact of normal chain base reward and gap chain fee 
reward on the utility of miners in an equilibrium state. With the increase of nor-
mal chain reward, the utility of miners presents a serious two-level differentiation, 
as shown in Fig.  8. The same situation also appears in the case of gap chain fee 
changes, as shown in Fig .7. The utility of No. 1 and No. 2 miners with more mining 
rigs increases with the increase of rewards, while the utility of No. 3 and No. 4 min-
ers with fewer mining rigs shows a trend of first increase and then decrease with the 
increase of rewards. We believe that the increase in competition in a single block-
chain has caused the above-mentioned situation. Combining Fig. 9, we can see that

in the early stage of the reward increase, miners No. 1 and No. 2 did not put a large 
number of rigs into the normal chain, and only after a large increase in rewards, 
they “boldly” invest their rigs in normal/gap chains. This phenomenon led to a large 
increase in the number of rigs on the normal chain in the later stage, and the No. 3 
and No. 4 miners who cannot invest more rigs are unable to participate in the fierce 
competition, resulting in reduced utility. In the case of an increase in gap chain fee 
rewards, the performance of miners is like the above situation. Figure 10 shows that 
as the fee reward increases, the distribution of mining rigs has an obvious trend of

first increasing and then decreasing, and the competitive advantage of miners with a 
large number of rigs on the gap chain became greater. In addition, with the increase 
in the number of mining machines, the block interval of the gap chain was shorter, 
which in turn lead to a decrease in the utility of the miners. Therefore, even if the 
fee rewards increased significantly, miners did not invest a lot of mining rigs, and it 
seems that they can reach a tacit understanding between them.
It is worth noting that we set the number of rigs of the four miners to 80, 60, 40 
and 20, which decreases linearly. However, the utility of the four miners in an equi-
librium state does not follow a linear distribution. Based on this, we boldly guess 
that miners with a large amount of mining resources dominate the mining industry. 
The mining resources allocation strategy of giant miners greatly affects the income 
of small miners, but small miners cannot have a significant impact on large miners.
7  Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a new game (called noncooperative gap normal game) 
to analyze the mining resources allocation in a multi-blockchain system. We then 
develop an algorithm to search the equilibrium of the game, and evaluate the impact 
of rewards on the distribution of mining resources when the gap chain and the nor-
mal chain coexist. The extensive experiments show that even if the base reward of 
the gap chain is less than that of the normal chain, as long as the fee reward can be 
large enough, it can attract a large number of miners to participate. This study pro-
vides a theoretical guidance for miners to invest their computing resources rationally.
