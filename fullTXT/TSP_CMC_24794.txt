Abstract: In recent times, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) experiences a
high risk of cyber attacks which needs to be resolved. Blockchain technol-
ogy can be incorporated into IIoT system to help the entrepreneurs realize
Industry 4.0 by overcoming such cyber attacks. Although blockchain-based
IIoT network renders a significant support and meet the service require-
ments of next generation network, the performance arrived at, in existing
studies still needs improvement. In this scenario, the current research paper
develops a new Privacy-Preserving Blockchain with Deep Learning model for
Industrial IoT (PPBDL-IIoT) on 6G environment. The proposed PPBDL-
IIoT technique aims at identifying the existence of intrusions in network.
Further, PPBDL-IIoT technique also involves the design of Chaos Game
Optimization (CGO) with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Network
(BiGRNN) technique for both detection and classification of intrusions in
the network. Besides, CGO technique is applied to fine tune the hyper-
parameters in BiGRNN model. CGO algorithm is applied to optimally
adjust the learning rate, epoch count, and weight decay so as to considerably
improve the intrusion detection performance of BiGRNN model. Moreover,
Blockchain enabled Integrity Check (BEIC) scheme is also introduced to avoid
the misrouting attacks that tamper the OpenFlow rules of SDN-based IIoT
system. The performance of the proposed PPBDL-IIoT methodology was
validated using Industrial Control System Cyber-attack (ICSCA) dataset and
the outcomes were analysed under various measures. The experimental results
highlight the supremacy of the presented PPBDL-IIoT technique than the
recent state-of-the-art techniques with the higher accuracy of 91.50%.

1 Introduction
The advancements made in industries, especially large-scale, in recent years have been rapid in
the areas of surveillance, transportation, security, and factory automation. In this scenario, Industrial
IoT (IIoT) [1] has drawn a considerable attention by integrating dense wireless devices like Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) tags [2] to identify the machines and sensor nodes for fault diagnosis,
asset monitoring, large scale equipment monitoring, manufacturing, production, and other such
applications for water supplies, power plants, gas, and oil refineries. Industrial Control System (ICS)
is employed to describe distinct systems like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). SCADA analyses and collects the data from substations on
a real-time basis. All substations have control devices such as Intelligent Electronic Device (IED),
Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that handle field devices,
for instance, meters, actuators, sensors, etc.
Having been considered as a fundamental enabler of Industry 4.0 and a developing offshoot of
IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems are being rapidly deployed in numerous social and commercial fields
like manufacturing, retail, pervasive monitoring, logistics, home automation, security surveillance, and
healthcare [3]. Furthermore, with astonishing advancements made in sensor network technologies and
wireless communications, considerable number of devices are being presented to IIoT environment in
which the raw data is processed and captured locally for data-driven decision-making process. This
device has the potential to interact and communicate with one another, process and share the data
and is independent of human interference [4]. Hence, these devices should be safeguarded enough to
preserve the data integrity and guarantee computing reliability and resource availability. Blockchain
technologies introduced a novel model for the next-generation transaction-based applications, along-
side a shared and distributed private or public ledger and a collective consensus method that enables
accountability, trust, and transparency in the network. Fig. 1 illustrates the evolution of 1G-6G.
Figure 1: Evolution of 1G-6G
Blockchain technique is transparent in nature owing to which it has been emphasized by the
research community and industries as a possible solution to manage huge IIoT networks in an
effective manner [5]. Furthermore, trust-less network architectures and decentralized IIoT devices
are anticipated to perform a significant part in the development of IIoT networks. These networks
treat the data locally, from where it is generated and not in a centralized way. Also, it can enable
device connectivity and create trustless data storage via sensors and devices which could function
independent of central authorities. Also, a secured framework is generally provided by a blockchain
i.e., strong against single point of failure [6]. Since decentralized networks have several entry points, it
adheres to fault tolerance and resilience of the network. Besides, IIoT infrastructure could be highly
available with the help of distributed ledger technology.
CMC, 2022, vol.72, no.1 335
IIoT system is highly vulnerable and gets exposed to numerous security attacks, for instance,
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Denial-of-Service (DoS). This attack could incur a sig-
nificant loss for IIoT service and smart environmental application in the IIoT system. As a result, it
becomes inevitable to protect the IIoT system from all types of cyber attacks [1]. Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) is a security system that mostly functions in the network layers of IIoT system.
When IDS is installed in an IIoT network, it should be capable of analysing the data packets and
produce the responses on a real-time basis. Furthermore, it should analyse the data packets present in
distinct layers of IIoT system using distinct protocol stacks and adapt to different techniques used
in IIoT framework [7]. An IDS i.e., developed for IIoT-based smart environment, must function
under stringent conditions in terms of fast response, high volume data processing, and low-processing
capability. Hence, traditional IDS mayn’t be adequate to meet the needs of IIoT environment. IIoT
security is a serious and continuous problem that needs to be addressed with priority; therefore, it
becomes an inevitable need to have a clear and current understanding of security susceptibilities in
IIoT systems and the growth of respective mitigation methods. Though blockchain and artificial
intelligence are known to exhibit numerous advantages, they still have their own share of disadvantages
too. Blockchain has a problem with scalability, energy consumption, privacy, efficiency, and security
whereas AI overcomes a few problems like effectiveness and interpretability. Though both techniques
are distinct areas of research, it could be associated with one another so as to have the advantage of
natural incorporation. These two techniques have common requirements for security, trust, and data
analysis due to which one could authorize the other.
The current research paper develops a new Privacy Preserving Blockchain with Deep Learning
model for Industrial IoT (PPBDL-IIoT) on 6G environment in order to identify the presence of
intrusions in network. PPBDL-IIoT technique incorporates Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) with
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRNN) technique for detection and classification
of intrusions in the network. Additionally, CGO algorithm is applied in fine tuning the hyperpa-
rameters of BiGRNN model too. Furthermore, Blockchain Enabled Integrity Check (BEIC) scheme
is introduced to avoid the misrouting attacks that tamper the OpenFlow rules of SDN-based IIoT
system. For validating the supremacy of the proposed PPBDL-IIoT technique, a series of simulations
was executed on ICSCA dataset and the outcomes were discussed under distinct parameters.
The paper is structured in the following. Section 2 shows a comprehensive review of security
based solutions for IIoT environment and Section 3 elaborates the detailed processes involved in the
proposed model. Next, Section 4 shows a brief experimental validation process and Section 5 draws
the conclusion.

Derhab et al. [8] proposed a security framework in which SDN and blockchain techniques are
incorporated. The presented method was made up of an IDS scheme that integrates RSL and KNN
algorithms to defend against the forged command and BICS so that the misrouting attacks can
be avoided. Rahmadika et al. [9] proposed a smart system incorporating 5G edge network, FL,
and blockchain technology so as to generate an effective and secured architecture for performing
transaction. FL allows the UE to train AI paradigm without revealing the beneficial data of UEs
to either model or the public provider. The recorded transaction could not be maliciously changed or
in other words, they remain the same. Further, the researcher also proposed few dynamic verification
protocols to UE for the purpose of interacting with different BSs. In addition to this, blockchain was
also employed as a rewarding method in FL to allow the computation offloading in wireless networks.

Qu et al. [10] proposed an architecture that is composed of BCS, layers, and intersect. In this
novel structure, every BCS is configured using blockchain technique. The authors described about
the credibility authentication approach in this study and also showed how it can authenticate the
procedure. Further, security analyses was conducted to test the efficiency based on authentication,
response time, and storage efficacy. Alkadi et al. [11] proposed the development of a DBF to provide
security-based distributed IDS and security-based blockchain with the help of an intelligent contract
in IoT network. IDS scheme makes use of BiLSTM DL method to handle consecutive network data
and is measured by BoT-IoT and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Both privacy-based blockchain and smart
contracts method were a result of Ethereum library and it aims at providing privacy to the distributed
IDS.
Ferrag et al. [12] proposed a new DL and blockchain-based energy structure i.e., enabled
DeepCoin for Smart Networks. DeepCoin structure employs two systems such as a DL based and
blockchain based systems. The blockchain-based system includes five stages such as agreement, setup,
view change, consensus making phases, and creating a block. It integrates a new consistent peer-to-peer
energy scheme i.e., depending on real-time Byzantine fault-tolerance approach. Further, the method
attains a high throughput. In Guha Roy et al. [13], a decentralized security method was proposed with
the incorporation of an SDN using blockchain for IoT in fog computing and mobile edges. Here, SDN
repeatedly analyses and monitors the traffic system to render an attack detection method. Blockchain
was employed in this study to overcome the problems faced in the present model. This was done so, by
sending the decentralized attack detection system that identifies attacks in fog and decreases the same
in edge node.
Skwarek [14] proposed an approach for IoT devices to attain industry-grade consistency in
data transfer from WSN to production system via blockchain technology. It is possible to obtain
improved reliability and security of the acquired data within sensor networks on application levels.
Hence, a lightweight, higher-level transmission protocol, depending on blockchain technology, has
been developed in this study. Blockchain mechanisms could protect the wireless transmission of
IoT in a scalable, lightweight model. Lee et al. [15] proposed a novel method that leverages the
distributed watchdog using blockchain system in defending the software supply chain. Furthermore,
the researchers introduced a set of thorough specifications to determine the behavior of system in a
clear manner and employ module checking.
3 The Proposed Model
The current study presented a new framework for ICS that allows network virtualization by
transferring the control layer to cloud so that a centralized management is enabled. The proposed
PPBDL-IIoT technique is a two-stage process namely intrusion detection and BEIC. For a long known
time, WAN is generally considered as complex and costly only. The proposed framework decreases the
network cost by providing zero-touch placement, viz., it is not necessary to construct the network
device by plugging it in. Rather, the devices are constructed from SDN controller. The presented
framework is made up of the modules discussed herewith.
Private cloud: It hosts every component that provides a central control for ICS alike VMs such as
SDN controller, SCADA, and DCS servers.
IP network: Rather than employing a devoted WAN to replace the ICS, public internet con-
nections are used among SDN and distinct substations. Every device is validated and end-to-end
encryptions are performed through networks.
CMC, 2022, vol.72, no.1 337
SDN controller: It can be considered as an application that handles the flow control with the help
of protocols like OpenFlow. In this setup, the switches are used for the transmission of data packets.
Open Flow protocol is a southbound interface amongst the forwarding and controller mechanisms
like switches. Here, the northbound interface assumes the communication amongst the applications
and controller.
Virtual Switch: It can be an application that interconnects different VMs of different/same
hypervisor(s). Furthermore, it interconnects the VMs with other physical switch.
3.1 Design of Intrusion Detection Technique
In intrusion detection process, CGO-BiGRNN technique is applied to determine the occurrence
of intrusions in the network. Multilayer RNNs are amongst one of the generally utilized techniques in
DL. These kinds of networks are capable of memorizing the realized data. Further, RNN is a powerful
technique for sequential data (time series) analysis. It utilizes the preceding output to predict the next
output. These loops i.e., hidden neurons allow one to save the preceding input data. But, the model
is forecasted based on the future output. The hidden layer outcome is retransmitted for t times to the
hidden layer [16]. Then the output becomes complete and the preceding data is retained for too long.
Eventually, the errors are returned back for updating the weight. During this case, four obtainable
RNN structures are utilized.
Simple RNN is fundamentally a group of general NNs which have the same task to accomplish
i.e., transfer the message from one node to another. Specifically, this is a memory network that saves
knowledge on the data server. However, its memory is short-term and could not continue as a long-
term time series. A simple recurrent network is the one internal memory−ht− calculated through
Eq. (1):
ht = g(Wxt + Uf ht−1 + b) (1)
where g() refers to activation function, U and W denote the variables in the weight matrices of h layer,
b represents the bias and X signifies the input vector.
GRU is an easy LSTM, proposed by Cho et al. [17]. The difference with LSTM is that GRU
combines both input as well as output gates and upgrades the same. The output value of ht in GRU is
calculated as follows.
zt = σ(WzXt + Uzht−1 + bz) (2)
rt = σ(WrXt + Urht−1 + br) (3)
h̃t = tanh(WhXt + (rt∗h)Uh) (4)
ht = (1 − zt)∗ht−1 + zt∗h̃t (5)
where r implies reset gate, and z represents the upgrade gate. Reset gate represents the integration
of novel input with earlier memory. An upgrade gate also represents the retention of the preceding
memory. When the update gate is one, the preceding memory gets completely preserved. When it can
be zero, the preceding memory goes totally forgotten. There is a forget gate in LSTM which manually
defines the preceding memory as continuous. But in case of GRU, every preceding memory is either
338 CMC, 2022, vol.72, no.1
preserved or entirely forgotten. Though GRU can be compared with LSTMs in terms of efficiency, it
requires low memory.
Bi-directional framework methods have the capability of learning data from preceding and
following data, if the current data is managed well. Fig. 2 illustrates the framework of GRU technique.
BiGRNN method has been defined as a dependent method that relies upon the state of two
unidirectional and oppositely-placed GRUs [18]. This allows the data in both future as well as past to
impact the current state. bi-GRU is determined as follows.
−→
ht = GRUfwd(xt,
−→
ht−1)
←−
ht = GRUbwd(xt,
←−
ht+1) (6)
ht = −→
ht ⊕ ←−
ht
where
−→
ht implies the condition of forwarding GRU,
←−
ht refers to backward GRU, ⊕ defines the function
of concatenating two vectors.
Figure 2: GRU structure
In order to fine tune the hyperparameters of BiGRNN technique, CGO algorithm is applied. The
key concept of CGO algorithm is depending on chaos theory, in which the fractals are configured
by using chaos game concept. The theory of chaos game is used as the key principle behind CGO
algorithm method. A quantity of solution candidates (X), represent the seed, is considered as CGO
approach. Every (X) candidate solution includes a few tuneable variables (X) which represent the
location of the seed. The triangle of Sierpinski is assumed as the exploration fields on the lookout
for solution. The mathematical form for the above scenario is represented herewith.

In which n denotes the population size of exploration, whereas d indicates dimensional problem.

where xj

of a triangle, the arithmetical method makes distinct seeds in their upper and lower bounds. A
temporary triangle using three seeds are shown below.
• The Global Best (GB) established until now;
• The Mean Group (MGi) is the mean value of arbitrary seed;
• The ith solution candidate (Xj).
The vertices of the triangle are Xj. GB, and MGi A temporary triangle is created for every first
seed so that it can produce novel seed to finish a novel triangle. The ith iteration comprises 3 corners
of a Sierpinski triangle and the seed attained in prior iterations. For novel seed, the temporary triangle
is employed and the dice is again rolled. The seeds in Xi are transferred to GB or MGi based on the
resultant colour. It can be modelled by an arbitrary integer value. It creates two integers i.e., zero/one,
that allows the selection of green or red faces. As per the chaos game, seed motion must be minimum.
in this regard, some of the factorials generated, are employed. The determined procedure for the initial
seed can be mathematically expressed as
Seed1
i = Xi + αi × (βi × GB − γi × MGi), i = 1, 2, . . ., n (9)
whereas Xi denotes ith candidate, αi signifies an arbitrary factorial that restricts the motion of seeds,
and βj and γj denotes arbitrary integers of zero/one to represent the probabilities of rolling some dice.
The dice of three red and blue faces are employed to the succeeding seeds (GB). The dice is rolled while
the GB is moved to Xi or MGi, based on the resultant colour. The seed move to the Xi, once a blue
face is attained; when red face is attained, the seeds move to MGi. The 2nd seeds go toward a point on
linking lines among Xi & MGi. It can be expressed mathematically by
Seed2
i = GB + αi × (βi × Xi − γi × MGi), i = 1, 2, . . ., n (10)
Based on the 3rd seeds, the dice is rolled. As per the resultant colour, the seed move to Xi or GB,
that generates 2 integrals i.e., zero and one. As per the certain factor, the seed travel to the connected
lines among Xi & GB can be formulated by
Seed3
i = MGi + αi × (βi × Xj − γi × GB), i = 1, 2, . . . , n (11)
Also, alternative technique is employed for creating the 4th seed to present a mutation step in the
position update of seeds. The position is modified according to specific changes in the chosen decision.
The arithmetical expression for the abovementioned procedure can be given in the following.
Seed4
i = Xi(xk
i = xk
i + R), k = [1, 2, . . . , d] (12)
whereas k denotes an arbitrary integer among 1 & d, as well as R signifies the range of arbitrary value
between zero and one.
The four distinct formulations for αi that control the movement limitation of the grain are
proposed herewith to change and monitor the exploitation and exploration rates of CGO method.

The fitness of novel candidate is related to the existing one and higher fitness are saved. In the

3.2 Design of BEIC Scheme
Blockchain is a kind of chain formation that integrates data blocks in a sequential order. It
is non-forgeable, tamper-proof distributed ledger that is assured by cryptography. Each blockchain
participant maintains the data for blockchain node. Hence, every data in blockchain is open and
transparent. When the data is published, it is retained permanently and could not be tampered with.
Tamper-proof and open authentication features of the blockchain enable one to perform as a trusted
3rd parties for addressing the concern of a user in Cloud Computing (CC) platform. Each result could
be released to blockchain for verification and can be retained by every user in the blockchain. Thus,
when blockchain is incorporated in CC environment, it benefits by resolving the drawbacks of CC
platform and could increase the efficiency of services to users with high data security.
Being a significant model of Bitcoin and a decentralized database, blockchain serves as a primary
framework of Bitcoin simultaneously. A blockchain is a sequence of data blocks that are produced
with the help of cryptography. Fig. 3 illustrates the block diagram of blockchain technology. Every
block has data about bitcoin network transaction which is employed to verify the validity of the
data and produce succeeding blocks. In other terms, blockchain is a chained data structure that
successively integrates data blocks based on time series. Being a distributed ledger, it could not be
forged through or tampered with cryptography. Blockchain technologies, in general, use blockchain
data structure to store and verify the information. Further, it employs distributed node consensus to
update and generate the information. In addition, it also employs cryptography for the purpose of
data access and transmission. It also employs smart contract, made up of automatic script code, for
programming and data manipulation purposes. Blockchain contains few features such as immutability,
decentralization, collective maintenance, traceability, transparency, and openness. This characteristic
ensures the transparency and honesty of blockchain and lays the basis for blockchain to create
trust. Blockchain-rich application scenario depends on the fact that blockchain could resolve data
asymmetry and attain concerted action and collaborative trust amongst different subjects.
Figure 3: Framework of blockchain
CMC, 2022, vol.72, no.1 341
Before determining the security solutions, some assumptions are to be made.
• Consider that ICS isn’t compromised (viz., free from malicious codes prior to the installation
of BEIC scheme). Or else, forged rule could be deliberated as legitimate.
• BEIC scheme focuses only on southbound transmission. Consider that the northbound com-
munications are secure between DCS and SCADA servers and IDSs from one side as well as
SDN controllers from another side.
• Consider that SDN controllers are placed in a private cloud and are available from an individual
host using access control and authentication method.
Blockchain [20] is an essential component in the proposed integrity checking system. The funda-
mental concept is to offer a solution in which every flow rule that can be produced from the controller,
is saved in immutable and verifiable databases. Blockchain is a series of blocks i.e., connected with hash
values. In blockchain networks, every user contains: single public key signifies its exclusive address and
single private key to sign the blockchain transactions. After authenticating the transmission blocks, the
transaction is processed and then added to the blockchain. After recording, the data in the provided
blocks could not be altered without changing every succeeding block. Additionally, the data exist in
several hosts in a gradual manner. So, any modifications will be denied by hosts of the peers. In this
study, a private (or permission) blockchain is presented. Therefore, consensus methods like Proof of
Work are not essential herewith. This blockchain is made up of SDN firewall and controller. SDN
controllers create the block and share it with firewall through blockchain. The initial nodes have full
permission, viz., to send, read, and write, whereas the firewall could only receive and read. The BEIC
systems are brought in the succeeding series.
• Once the requests are received from northbound applications, the SDN controllers are devel-
oped to transmit the respective flow rules to vSwitches. In this model, SDN controllers are
also considered as members of a blockchain. It hashes the flow rule and places it in block i.e.,
dispersed to another node of the blockchain. The SDN controllers are the node in blockchain
that had the authority to construct a block whereas the remaining nodes could only read the
blockchain.
• Once the flow rule reaches vSwitch nodes, save the rule in record files and latter upgrades its
flow table.
• The firewall gathers the vSwitch log and access the BlockChain for obtaining the flow rules,
transmitted through the controller.
• When the firewall detects the 2 rules that are present in blockchain and vSwitch, it informs the
management to take a proper counter measure for fixing this mismatch.
4 Performance Validation

5 Conclusion
In current study, a new PPBDL-IIoT technique has been proposed for the detection of intrusions
in 6G-enabled IIoT environment. The proposed PPBDL-IIoT technique encompasses a two-stage
process namely, intrusion detection and BEIC. DL-based BiGRNN technique with CGO-based
hyperparameter optimization is used to detect and classify the intrusions in network. CGO algorithm
is applied to optimally adjust the learning rate, epoch count, and weight decay so as to improve the
intrusion detection performance of BiGRNN model up to a considerable manner. Moreover, BEIC
technique is designed to circumvent the misrouting attacks that tamper the OpenFlow rules of SDN-
based IIoT system. For ensuring the supremacy of PPBDL-IIoT technique, a series of simulations
was executed on ICSCA dataset. The experimental results highlight the supremacy of PPBDL-IIoT
technique over an advanced technique with the higher accuracy of 91.50%. In future, the design of
PPBDL-IIoT methodology can be extended further to perform fault diagnosis and power management
systems in blockchain-enabled IIoT environment.
