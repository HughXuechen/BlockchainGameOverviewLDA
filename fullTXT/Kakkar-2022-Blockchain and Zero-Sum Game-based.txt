Abstract—This paper proposes a zero-sum game theory and
blockchain-based secure and decentralized dynamic pricing
scheme for electric vehicle charging. It aims to secure data
sharing between electric vehicles and charging stations. We
integrate the sixth-generation (6G) communication network to
enable data transactions between electric vehicles and charging
stations with low latency and high reliability. We employ a zero-
sum game theory approach to maximize the payoff of electric
vehicles and charging stations. The performance of the proposed
system with 6G is evaluated by comparing it with 5G and
4G traditional networks. The performance evaluation of the
proposed system has been analyzed with various parameters
latency, profit for electric vehicles, profit for charging station,
and optimal payoff of the system. The results show that the
proposed system is highly secure and reliable than traditional
systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the transportation system has com-
pletely transformed the quality of living for people. As people
get the privilege to travel worldwide with the number of
increased fossil-fuel-powered vehicles on the road [1]. Al-
though, as estimated in [2], fossil-fuel vehicles on the road
are the reason for increased global warming due to the release
of approximately 30% of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2.
Therefore, the transportation system has gradually adapted the
electric vehicles instead of conventional fossil-fuel vehicles
due to its various advantages such as reduced air pollution,
reduced global warming, environment-friendly, and reduced
prices for charging [3]. However, a huge number of EVs on
the road increases charging demand, which means more CS
infrastructure. But, to mitigate the above-mentioned issue, we
need to develop more power plants, which is quite expensive
for users [4]. So, with the increase in the number of EVs,
charging prices can also vary depending on the crowd or area,
i.e., fluctuations in charging price based on the town or metro
city [5]. Hence, it is necessary to schedule EVs considering
the charging prices as high prices can cause loss to the EVs
and low prices cannot be favourable for CS.
To mitigate the above mentioned issues, some au-
thors/researchers have proposed the EVs charging scheme, but
with the help of a centralized cloud server that can’t store
data of users insecure way. For example, there can be various
security attacks against the data, such as modification attack,
integrity attack, man-in-the-middle attack etc. [2]. These secu-
rity issues can discourage EVs from charging at the charging
station.
So, to meet the aforementioned issues, a blockchain-based
decentralized and trustable framework [6] is crucial to enhance
the security in the system so that EVs can be motivated
enough for charging at the CS [7][8]. Some of these works
are: Cao et al. [9] discussed a blockchain-based EV charging
reservation approach to enhance security in the system. Then,
Wang et al. [10] proposed an efficient charging scheme for
EVs in vehicular energy networks using blockchain. Further,
they introduce a game-based theory approach to enhance user
profit.
Then, authors in [11] studied a blockchain-based energy
trading scheme for EVs. They are mainly focusing on securing
the data of users against various attacks. Later, Li et al.
[12] presented a blockchain and fog computing-based EVs
charging scheme to ensure the privacy and transparency of
users while charging. Later, Gabay et al. [13] investigated
the blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs method to ensure
authentication and privacy for EVs. They have adapted a
token-based approach to ensure anonymity in the system.
Most of the secure blockchain-based solutions presented by
the researchers can come across various issues such as latency,
cost-efficiency, the optimal payoff of the system, and profit for
EVs and CS. They have also not discussed dynamic charging
prices for optimal payoff. In some of the literature [9] [10],
they have considered optimizing the cost for users, but without
any involvement of dynamic charging prices. Motivated from
this, we introduce a blockchain-based dynamic pricing scheme
for EV charging using a zero-sum game theory approach.
The zero-sum game theory approach aims to optimize the
payoff for EVs and CS with the existence of a saddle point
so that both users can be satisfied in terms of profit. To
address the issues of latency, a 6G network is adapted with
blockchain due to its prominent characteristics, i.e., high data
speed (< 10Gbps) and low latency (< 1ms) [14] to ensure
efficient data transactions between EVs and CS [15].
Primarily, the blockchain-proposed system focuses on en-
hancing security, transparency, efficiency, and confidentiality
in the system [16]. In the proposed system, EVs and CS can
store their data in the blockchain for charging and security
purpose. But, data storage in the blockchain is quite costly
for users. Therefore, to address the data storage issue, we
have employed a decentralized IPFS free of cost data storage
protocol so that EVs and CS can store their data in a cost-
efficient way [17].
A. Motivation
• As per the literature, many researchers have discussed the
blockchain-based EVs charging scheme while ignoring
the latency and optimal payoff for EVs and CS.

• Some researchers have discussed the optimised price but
without considering the effect of dynamic charging prices
in charging. Motivated from this, we have introduced a
blockchain-based dynamic pricing scheme for EV charg-
ing using a zero-sum game theory approach.
• Thus, there is a need to propose a blockchain-based
dynamic pricing scheme with a 6G network to enhance
the latency and efficiency of the system.
B. Research contributions
The research contributions of this paper are as follows.
• We propose a secure and efficient blockchain incor-
porated with an IPFS-based dynamic pricing scheme
for electric vehicles charging over a 6G communication
network.
• We formulate a zero-sum game theory approach to op-
timize the profit for EVs and CS to make the system
profitable.
• Lastly, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
system considering the parameters such as latency, the
optimal payoff of the system, and profit for EVs and CS.
C. Organization
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the system model and problem formulation. Section
III describes the zero-sum game theory approach. Results of
the proposed system is presented in Section IV and finally, the
paper is concluded in the Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System model
Fig.1 presents a blockchain-based dynamic pricing scheme
for electric vehicle charging. It comprises of three components,
which include component EVs (Cν) embedded with the smart
meters (Φν), component CSs (Cζ) equipped with the RFID
sensors indicated by π, and component price monitoring entity
(CΩE ) communicating via blockchain over 6G network. The
energy level indicator associated with the EVs indicates the
available energy (Γν ∈ Q), which is being detected using
smart meters Φ attached with them. Now, component Cν
along with their Γν arrived at the CS, which is assigned
with the charging price of (ρdpζ ) that is varying based on the
various factors. It means price associated with the CS can vary
according to the number of EVs arriving at the CS and day,
i.e., weekday or weekend. The 6G communication network
is employed to make the system efficient and reliable. The
incorporated IPFS storage protocol ensures that data can be
stored in the blockchain in cost-efficient way.
The main aim of the proposed system is to ensure privacy,
security, confidentiality, and transparency in the system. For
that, we have introduced a price monitoring entity ΩE to
monitor the prices of CS if it crosses the maximum threshold
price (Γρdp
ζ
). Otherwise, if prices for CS hikes up unnecessary,
then EVs can lose interest to charge their vehicles, which can
also cause a loss of CS. Price monitoring entity monitors the
price of CS by assigning them the token βζ . As EVs are
only arriving with the available energy for charging, there is
no need to monitor or authenticate them. However, if EVs
and CS want to become valid blockchain participants, then a
smart contract is executed to legitimize them for their request.
A zero-sum game theory approach is devised to optimize the
charging price ρdpζ for EVs and CS should also get profit from
it. The components interact over 6G communication networks,
which facilitates ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency data
transactions so that EVs can charge their vehicles efficiently.
Fig.1 shows the working of the layered architecture of a
blockchain-based dynamic pricing scheme for electric vehicle
charging. The architecture consists of three layers: (1) EV
charging layer, (2) Price monitoring and data communication
layer, and (3) Blockchain layer. These three layers can be
explained as follows:
1) EV Charging Layer: This layer consists of EVs arriving
at the CS along with their associated hash keys λν and Λζ
to charge their vehicles based on their available energy Γν .
Now, EVs with their Γν can decide for charging based on
the dynamic prices associated with CS. It means prices for
charging can fluctuate based on the day on which EVs arrive
and the number of EVs arrive at the CS. Now, EVs with their
data about the available energy and CS with their dynamic
prices ρdpζ can request to store their data in the IPFS. The
data can be stored in the IPFS with the help of the price
monitoring entity ΩE introduced in the price monitoring and
data communication layer. For that purpose, ΩE can observe
the ρdpζ of CS by assigning them the threshold price Γρdp
ζ
along
with their Λζ . The frequent fluctuation, i.e., high charging
prices of CS can disinterest EVs for charging. So, ΩE monitors
whether ρdpζ crosses the threshold price Γρdp
ζ
or not. If it
lies below the threshold price, then CS can store their data
about the charging price in the IPFS, otherwise, it is not
authenticated to store the data in IPFS. Now, to store the data
of EVs and CS in IPFS, they have to transit through the price
monitoring and data communication layer to fulfill some more
conditions.
2) Price Monitoring and Data Communication Layer:
In the EV charging layer, EVs with available energy and
CS with their charging price being monitored by the price
monitoring entity has to go through the price monitoring and
data communication layer. This layer involves the execution of
a smart contract to authorize the EVs and CS along with their
hash keys λν and Λζ , so that they can store their data in the
IPFS. Also, monitoring charging prices ensures that both EVs
and CS should not suffer from any loss. The data transmission
of EVs and CS can be carried out reliably and securely over
the 6G communication network with high availability, high
data speed, and low latency features.
3) Blockchain Layer: It is the security layer of the proposed
system, which mainly focuses on securing the data transactions
of EVs and CS for charging. As smart contract already
validated them to reserve their data in the IPFS. Now, they
can request to append the stored data in the blockchain, i.e.,
to become a valid member of the blockchain. But before that,
as they get the privilege to reserve their data in IPFS, IPFS
provide them with the hash keys Θhk
ν and Θhk
ζ . Then, EVs and
CS with their hash keys can request to add their data to the
blockchain. For that, if hash keys associated with the EVs and
CS coincide with the hash (habl) of blockchain. Then, data
can be appended to the blockchain successfully. Algorithm 1
shows the procedure to append data of u number of EVs and
p number of CS to the blockchain with the time complexity
of O(u) and O(p). The time complexity of the Algorithm 1
depends on the data associated with the number of EVs and
CS that needs to be appended to the blockchain.

B. Problem Formulation
The proposed system involve various components, i.e.,
component Cν consists of set of u number of EVs
{ν1, ν2, . . . , . . . , νu} ∈ νv with their available energy Γν arriv-
ing at a CS ζ to charge their vehicles by trading money from
their wallet (ξ). Further, component CΩ consists of p number
of price monitoring entities Pme {Ω1,Ω2, . . . , . . . ,Ωp} ∈ Ωg
communicating with a CS ζ to monitor the charging price ρdpζ
so that prices should be in favor of both EVs and CS. The
above mentioned associations can be represented as follows:

where σ signifies the association of u
′
number of EVs and CS
for charging. σ
′
denotes the relationship between p
′
number
of price monitoring entities Pme and CS. Now, EVs and
CS want to store their data in the IPFS, but before that, the
price monitoring entity inspects the change in charging prices
of CS. For EVs, there is no need to authenticate them as
they are arriving with the data, i.e., available energy at a CS,
which can’t tamper with the system’s security. For CS, price
monitoring entity Pme observes the fluctuation in dynamic
charging prices ρdpζ based on the various parameters. The
parameters are number of EVs (Nνv
) arriving at the CS and
day (α), whether it is weekday (Weα) or weekend (Wdα).
Now, we have classified parameter day into three time zone
(τ ), i.e., morning (τ1 − τ2), afternoon (τ3 − τ4), and evening
(τ5−τ6) according to the Weα or Wdα. The above-mentioned
entities can be represented as follows:
α =
{
Weα, when day is weekday
Wdα, when day is weekend (5)
τ(Weα,Wdα) =
 τ1 − τ2, if timezone is morning
τ3 − τ4, if timezone is afternoon
τ5 − τ6, if timezone is evening
(6)
So, dynamic charging price ρdpζ of CS can vary based on these
parameters. But, the charging price should be assigned in such
a way that both EVs and CS should be satisfied with it in
terms of optimized price and profit. The charging price of CS
depends upon the number of EVs (Nνv
) and day α. It further

depends upon one more situation, i.e., whether the number of
EVs entering at the CS is greater than the threshold number
(δTh
ν ) or not. If it is greater than threshold number, then ρdpζ
increase by factor x and x
′
in timezone morning τ1 − τ2 and
evening τ5 − τ6 in case of weekday Weα. For weekend, ρdpζ
increase by the factor y and y
′
in case of timezone afternoon
τ3−τ4 and evening τ5−τ6. So, the increase in charging price
ρdpζ (Hp), ρdpζ (Hp
′
), ρdpζ (Hp
′′
), and ρdpζ (Hp
′′′
) based on the
parameters in case of EVs greater than δTh
ν can be represented
as follows:
ρdpζ → {Nνv , α(Weα,Wdα} (7)
ρdpζ (Hp)
η−→ ρdpζ + x(α(Weα(τ1 − τ2))) (8)
ρdpζ (Hp

)
η−→ ρdpζ + x

(α(Weα(τ5 − τ6))) (9)
ρdpζ (Hp

)
η−→ ρdpζ + y(α(Wdα(τ3 − τ4))) (10)
ρdpζ (Hp
′′′
)
η−→ ρdpζ + y
′
(α(Wdα(τ5 − τ6))) (11)
Similarly, if number of EVs are less than the threshold value,
then there is decrease in charging price of CS based on the
weekday or weekend. So, For weekend, ρdpζ decrease by the
factor z and z
′
in timezone afternoon τ3 − τ4 and evening
τ5 − τ6. Alternatively, ρdpζ decrease by factor w and w
′
in
timezone morning τ1 − τ2 and evening τ5 − τ6 in case of
weekday Weα. So, the decrease in charging price ρdpζ (Lp),
ρdpζ (Lp
′
), ρdpζ (Lp
′′
), and ρdpζ (Lp
′′′
) based on the parameters
in case of EVs greater than δTh
ν can be represented as follows:
ρdpζ (Lp)
η−→ ρdpζ − z(α(Weα(τ1 − τ2))) (12)
ρdpζ (Lp
′
)
η−→ ρdpζ − z
′
(α(Weα(τ5 − τ6))) (13)
ρdpζ (Lp
′′
)
η−→ ρdpζ − w(α(Wdα(τ3 − τ4))) (14)
ρdpζ (Lp
′′′
)
η−→ ρdpζ − w
′
(α(Wdα(τ5 − τ6))) (15)
where η denotes the variation of charging price with the pa-
rameters Wdα and Weα. So, we have discussed the variation
of charging price based on the various parameters. ΩE can
monitor the charging price of CS, according to which if it
fluctuates and crosses threshold price Γρdp
ζ
, then the price
monitoring entity disapprove CS from storing the data in the
IPFS. If it is authenticated, then EVs and CS can get their
data stored in the IPFS by getting validation from the smart
contract. If a smart contract validates them, then they can
get the hash keys {Θhk
ν1
,Θhk
ν2
, . . . , . . . ,Θhk
νu
} ∈ Θhk
νv
and Θhk
ζ
provided by the IPFS to return the favor of storing the data.
The above associations can be mentioned as follows:

ϵ−→
l∑
v=1
Θhk
νv
and ζ(ρdpζ )
ϵ−→ Θhk
ζ (16)
v > 0, l ≤ u (17)
As, EVs and CS has already stored their data in the IPFS.
Now, there can be another request of EVs and CS to append
their data to the blockchain, i.e., to become valid member of
the blockchain network. For that, hash keys Θhk
νv
and Θhk
ζ of
EVs and CS provided by IPFS should be in alignment with
hash of the blockchain.

III. ZERO-SUM GAME THEORY APPROACH
In the proposed system, a zero-sum game theory approach
has been considered to optimize the profit for EV and CS.
The game should be played in such a way that EV can also
get the CS with optimized price and CS should also not suffer
from any loss. But there is a condition for applying the zero-
sum game theory approach. As we have already discussed the
variation in charging price is based on the parameters α, Weα,
and Wdα. So, if EVs arrive with available energy greater than
threshold energy, they can choose whether to charge their
vehicle or not based on the charging price. It means if the
charging price hikes up and crosses the threshold price, they
can also choose to charge later according to their convenience.
And, if the charging price is not quite high, they can go for
charging accordingly.
But, if EV arrives with available energy less than the threshold
value, then, in any case, they have to get their vehicle charged.
For that particular case, a zero-sum game theory is needed so
that they don’t have to pay the maximum price, and CS should
also get the benefit for charging based on the parameters. The
zero-sum game consists of two players, P{ν, ζ,Π} in which
Π is a payoff function in the form of a matrix. EV can charge
their vehicles based on the charging price assigned to the CS.
But, charging prices should not be high or low to such an
extent that it can lead to loss for EVs and CS.
For that, EV and CS choose the pure strategy P ν
s and P ζ
s
to form a payoff matrix Π(ν,ζ). The strategy P ν
s of EV aims
to minimize the charging price ρdpζ and CS with the strategy
P ζ
s aims to maximize the charging price ρdpζ .
Therefore, both the users try their fullest to optimize the
profit, which requires the discussion of payoff matrix which
consists of strategies of EV and CS. Considering the payoff

price for both EV and CS. But, according to their strategy P ν

The above mentioned associations for Π(ν,ζ)(P

on the strategy, maximized price, and minimized price based

s1) which comprises of
minimized charging price and maximized charging price for
EV and CS, which is exactly according to their strategy
for their benefits. But, if we consider the payoff matrix
Π(ν,ζ)(P
ν
s2 , P
ζ
s2) which involves minimized price for both EV
and CS. Now, this is in favor of EV, but CS may not get any
benefit from minimized price. Therefore, based on the strategy
P ζ
s , they attempt to maximize the price to get the overall
benefit. So, we can defined the above mentioned associations
as follows:
ζ(ρdpζ )(ρdpζ (Min))
ι−→ ρdpζ (Max) (23)
So, we have discussed the payoff matrix for Π(ν,ζ) for EV and
CS based on their strategy so that they can get the maximized
profit for charging. But, it is not possible to satisfy both of
them. Therefore, in zero-sum game theory approach, saddle
point is a condition after which users can’t diverge from their
strategy to get the benefit for charging. In the proposed system,
saddle point can occur in payoff matrix Πs
(ν,ζ), when charging
price can be considered between minimized price ρdpζ (Min)
and maximized price ρdpζ (Max) to satisfy both EV and CS
in terms of payoff. The payoff matrix Πs
(ν,ζ) with strategy
{P ν
s∗ , P
ζ
s∗} at the saddle point can be represented as follows:
ρdpζ (Min) < Πs
(ν,ζ)(P
ν
s∗ , P
ζ
s∗) < ρdpζ (Max) (24)
Therefore, the zero-sum game theory approach at the saddle
point optimizes the payoff for EV and CS based on the con-
sidered parameters. Algorithm 2 shows the detailed strategy
to optimize the payoff of P number of players, i.e., ν, and ζ
with the time complexity of O(P). The time complexity of the
Algorithm 2 completely depends on the optimized payoff of
the P number of players.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
This section specifies the performance analysis of the
proposed system, which has been implemented on Remix
IDE(Integrated Development Environment). The results have
been analyzed with the execution of the smart contract using
solidity language. Further, the zero-sum game theory approach
has been applied to optimize the payoff for users. The results
for optimized payoff has been simulated in python 3.2 at a
particular point, i.e., saddle point. The experimental results
have been estimated based on various parameters such as
latency, the optimal payoff of the system, and profit analysis
for EVs. These parameters can be represented as follows:
A. Latency
Fig. 2 shows the correlation between the latency of the
proposed system with 6G and traditional systems with 5G and
4G networks. It depicts that latency is aligned at the same level
in the case of fewer transactions between EVs and CS. But,
the increased number of transactions between EVs and CS
yield improved latency for the proposed system with 6G than
4G and 5G networks. This is due to the prominent properties
of 6G network, which are high data speed (Ds6G < 10Gbps),
high availability, and low-latency (Latencynetwork < 1ms).
Fig. 2: Latency comparison.
B. Optimal payoff of the system
Fig. 3 shows the optimal payoff of the proposed system
with the rise in the number of transactions between EVs and
CS. The graph depicts that as the number of data transactions
between EVs and CS increases, the payoff of the proposed
system tends to converge optimally up to a particular point.
This is due to the applied zero-sum game theory approach to
optimize the payoff for users in which there exists a saddle
point. At this point, the optimized payoff is determined with
the help of the average of maximized charging price and
minimized charging price based on the various parameters.
The existence of saddle point denotes that, after this point,
users can’t alter their strategy. So, the graph reflects the
stability after the saddle point, further optimizing the payoff
for EVs and CSs.
C. Profit for EVs and CS
Fig. 4 depicts the correlation between profit for EVs and
profit for CS based on the increase in the number of data
transactions. It can be distinguished from the graph that profit

for EVs and profit for CS increases linearly with the rise in
the number of transactions. But, profit for both of them tends
to be stable and optimal after a certain point, i.e., saddle point
based on the zero-sum game theory. It can also be observed
from the graph that the profit for EVs is less than the profit
for CS. CS can profit from multiple EVs arriving for charging,
but EV gets a benefit for their charging only. Therefore, profit
for CS is somewhat high than profit for EVs.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a blockchain integrated with IPFS
-based secure dynamic pricing scheme for EVs charging
over the 6G communication network. We have analyzed the
blockchain-based traditional schemes to get insights into their
security, profit, latency, and cost-efficiency issues. Introducing
the 6G network with decentralized and cost-efficient IPFS
data storage protocol ensures high efficiency and reliability
in the system. We have formulated a zero-sum game theory
approach to optimize the payoff for EVs and CS with the
existence of a saddle point to make the system profitable
and accessible. The proposed system has been implemented
on Remix IDE using the solidity programming language.
Finally, the proposed system has been evaluated based on
the parameters such as latency, profit for EVs, profit for CS,
and overall optimal payoff of the system. The analysis of
the results shows that the proposed system outperforms the
traditional systems in terms of cost-efficiency, profitability, low
latency, and high reliability.
In the future, we will explore more about the scenario in
which the multiple number of EVs and CSs can be considered
to optimize the payoff using a game theory approach to ensure
the dynamic capability of the proposed system.
