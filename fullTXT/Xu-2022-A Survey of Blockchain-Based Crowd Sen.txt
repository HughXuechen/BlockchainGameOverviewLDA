Abstract. Crowd sensing (CS) is a data acquisition mode using the
sensing ability of mobile devices. As a distributed ledger, blockchain (BC)
is used for crowd sensing to resist security risks in the incentive process.
Therefore, many blockchain-based CS incentive mechanisms have been
proposed. In this paper, we summarize the incentive mechanism of the
based-blockchain CS system. First, we introduce the background knowl-
edge of crowd sensing and blockchain. Second, we use a two-dimensional
incentive mechanism classification framework based on the main incen-
tive goal and the reward form to classify the existing blockchain-based
CS incentive mechanisms. In the classification method based on the main
incentive goal, the incentive mechanism is divided into service quality,
privacy security, and trusted transaction. In the classification method
based on reward form, the incentive mechanism is divided into social ser-
vice, game playing, and monetary reward. Then, we compare and analyze
typical incentive mechanisms, discuss the advantages of typical incentive
scheme and their existing problems. Finally, we propose the challenges
and future directions of the based-blockchain CS incentive mechanism.

1 Introduction
Like generative adversarial networks [1,2], named entity recognition [3], and the
internet of thing [4], crowdsensing is an emerging technology. CS is an infor-
mation sensing method, which enables sensing device holders to get rewards by
contributing the data perceived in their mobile devices to provide services for
requesters [5]. CS technology is widely used in various fields of daily life and

production, including energy [6], transportation [7], and medical treatment [8].
However, CS faces many challenges in service quality, privacy, and participa-
tion due to its structural characteristics [9]. And blockchain is a decentralized,
traceable, and tamper-proof distributed storage technology, so it is integrated
into the CS system [10]. CS incentive mechanism is to actively participate in
the project and provide high-quality data under the incentive measures for the
holder of the sensing device [11]. To deal with the single point of failure of the
centralized CS system, data requesters and task participants in the CS system
join the blockchain network as nodes [12]. The addition of blockchain also brings
new problems to the CS incentive mechanism, such as difficulty in guaranteeing
service quality, leakage of user privacy information, and untrustworthy transac-
tions. Therefore, many scholars have proposed novel CS incentive mechanisms
based on blockchain for these problems. However, the traditional incentive mech-
anism classification framework cannot effectively divide and summarize the CS
incentive mechanism in the blockchain environment. So we propose a novel clas-
sification framework for the blockchain-based CS incentive mechanism in this
paper.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follow:
(1) For the first time, we propose a two-dimensional incentive mechanism clas-
sification framework based on the main incentive goal and the reward form
and use it to classify and sort out the existing blockchain-based incentive
mechanisms for crowdsensing.
(2) We discuss the advantages and problems of typical blockchain-based incen-
tive schemes for crowd sensing. And we summarize and compare the impor-
tant characteristics of different incentive methods in the form of a table.
(3) We analyze the challenges still faced by the blockchain-based crowd sensing
incentive mechanism at this stage, and propose possible future development
directions.
The rest of this article is as follows. In Sect. 2, we will introduce the back-
ground knowledge of blockchain and crowd sensing. In Sect. 3, we use the incen-
tive mechanism classification method based on the main incentive goal and the
incentive mechanism classification method based on the reward form to classify
and summarize the based-blockchain CS incentive mechanisms. And we compare
and discuss the advantages of typical incentive mechanisms and their existing
problems. In Sect. 4, we analyze the challenges faced by the blockchain-based
crowd sensing incentive mechanism and propose the development direction of
future research. In Sect. 5, we summarize the full text.
2 Background
2.1 Blockchain
Since the publication of the Bitcoin white paper [13] in 2008, blockchain has
received extensive attention from industry and academia. Blockchain is a chain
A Survey of Blockchain-Based Crowd Sensing Incentive Mechanism 247
structure that combines data blocks in historical order [14]. Its structure is shown
in Fig. 1. The blocks are connected by hash pointers in the blockchain system.
It is a distributed ledger shared and maintained by all nodes in a decentral-
ized system. The blockchain system can be divided into five layers: data layer,
network layer, consensus layer, smart contract layer, and application layer [15].
Blockchain has the following characteristics:
(1) Decentralization: Blockchain participants can publicly access historical
transactions or confirm the latest transactions without relying on a trusted
third party.
(2) Anti-tampering: Any information generally stored in the blockchain will
generate a unique identifier and cannot be tampered with.
(3) Traceability: The blockchain structure stores all historical data based on the
genesis block, and any data on the chain can be traced back to its origin.
Fig. 1. Blockchain structure
Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, anti-tampering, and
traceability. So it is being widely used in many fields such as medical care, food
supply, agriculture, etc. [16–18].
2.2 Crowd Sensing
As an emerging data collection mode, the crowdsensing system relies on sen-
sors integrated into mobile devices to collect high-quality data. Compared with
traditional sensor networks, the mobility and intelligence of mobile device sen-
sors ensure a higher perceptual coverage and better perceptual context correla-
tion [19]. Nowadays, smart devices are widely used in our daily activities, such
as communication, business, and entertainment, which makes the application of
crowd sensing technology in many fields possible [20].
At present, the main objects of the crowd sensing system are three:
requesters, workers (sensing task participants), and service platforms [21]. The
service platform accepts service requests from requesters and assigns tasks.
248 X. Xu et al.
Workers are selected to join the tasks and return the required data to the ser-
vice platform. And the service platform returns the data to the requester after
verifying. The workers who complete tasks will get the reward from requesters.
Crowd sensing incentive mechanism means that data requesters use rewards
through the service platform to encourage workers to actively participate in
sensing tasks so that workers can consume sensing equipment resources to col-
lect data according to the requester’s wishes [22]. After many transactions, the
incentive mechanism maximizes the mutual benefit of the requester and the
worker, as shown in Formula (1).
Incentive = max(Benefitr, Benfitw) (1)
3 Blockchain-Based Crowd Sensing Incentive Mechanism
In this chapter, we will discuss the existing blockchain-based CS incentive mech-
anism with the classification framework (see Fig. 2) and analyze typical incentive
mechanisms.

3.1 Incentive Mechanism Based on Main Incentive Goal
Service Quality. Promoting participants to provide high-quality service data
is the important goal of CS. The data quality is affected by many factors, so
incentive mechanisms are needed to encourage users to actively collect data.
Wang et al. [23] proposed an incentive mechanism based on two-layer rein-
forcement learning to encourage high-quality model sharing of drones. Chen
et al. [24] proposed an incentive mechanism for car networking crowd sensing
based on consortium blockchain and data quality-driven auction model, which
uses smart contracts to realize automatic data sharing and encourages users to
provide high-quality data. Wei et al. [25] proposed a blockchain-based incentive
mechanism for a mixed crowd sensing system, which comprehensively considers
data quality evaluation and other factors and encourage participants to actively
contribute their sensor data. Zheng et al. [26] proposed a quality of service
(QoS) awareness-based incentive mechanism for blockchain-based crowd sens-
ing, using a web service quality model based on non-functional attributes to
A Survey of Blockchain-Based Crowd Sensing Incentive Mechanism 249
provide higher rewards to workers who contribute high-quality data. Dimitriou
et al. [27] proposed a reward framework that can be used as a block building in
crowd sensing applications, allowing workers to submit data and obtain bitcoin
rewards through incentive mechanism. Gu et al. [28] proposed a Bitcoin-based
CS reward distribution scheme, which maintains the participation enthusiasm
of users through sensing capabilities evaluation and transaction verification. Hui
et al. [29] developed a blockchain-based collaborative CS scheme that encourages
automatic vehicle to perform the sensing tasks cooperatively by alliance games
with transferable rewards. Foschini et al. [30] proposed a mobile crowd sens-
ing (MCS) architecture based on multi-access edge computing, which records
the task participants’ reward status with blockchain to improve the quality of
services provided by users. Kadadha et al. [31] proposed a distributed CS task
matching mechanism based on the two-way preference, which uses the task qual-
ity as the main parameter to select best workers for the task and motivate them.
Cheng et al. [32] proposed a blockchain-based CS system, which applies a rep-
utation incentive mechanism to analyze data and effectively reward excellent
workers.
Privacy Security. With the increase of privacy and security issues, the moti-
vation of users to participate in activities will also decrease. Therefore, some
incentive mechanisms have been proposed to protect user privacy and sensi-
tive information from being leaked in the process of CS. Dorsala et al. [33]
designed a privacy-preserving aggregation scheme for maintaining crowd sensing
data. It deploys aggregator services in intelligent contracts on public blockchain
networks, using encryption technology to protect user privacy during the incen-
tive process. Li et al. [34] proposed a blockchain-based incentive mechanism of
non-deterministic vehicle crowd sensing, which effectively motivates vehicles to
participate in sensing activities under conditions that protect user privacy. Wang
et al. [35] proposed a smart privacy protection incentive mechanism, using smart
contracts and zero-knowledge evidence to achieve reverse auctions of sensing data
based on a limited budget under privacy protection conditions. Peng et al. [36]
combined k-anonymity and blockchain to build a MCS system, which allows
participants to receive sensing tasks that do not reveal private information and
submit corresponding sensing data to obtain corresponding rewards. Chatzopou-
los et al. [37] designed an efficient CS optimal auction incentive strategy, which
requires workers to perform sensing tasks in specific locations and protect users’
privacy with smart contracts. Yang et al. [38] proposed a distributed privacy pro-
tection incentive framework, which uses private blockchain to prevent location
privacy attacks by connecting payment amounts with user tasks. Moti et al. [39]
developed a blockchain-based location crowd sensing incentive mechanism to
obtain information services under the condition of privacy protection through
six main features for spontaneous location setting. Jia et al. [40] proposed a
blockchain-based hybrid incentive mechanism for location privacy protection in
a crowd sensing network, which encourages users to participate in sensing tasks
without disclosing location information. Lai et al. [41] proposed a secure and
250 X. Xu et al.
privacy-protected map update incentive scheme, which applies the blind signa-
ture technology to ensure the safety of the incentive mechanism and protect
the privacy of the vehicle users. Wang et al. [42] proposed a based-permission-
blockchain location-protected anonymous payment system, which uses the zero-
knowledge proof method to realize the security of the anonymous payments sys-
tem. Lin et al. [43] proposed a distributed location-based services certification
incentive mechanism, which encourages witnesses to actively verify the location
information provided by CS users and solves the privacy leakage problem of the
location proof system.
Trusted Transaction. Credible incentives in CS have become an important
content of user attention. And incentive methods based on the trust relationship
are proposed to avoid malicious behaviors in the CS process. Noshad et al. [44]
proposed a blockchain-based distributed reputation incentive mechanism applied
to the crowd sensing network, which uses the reputation system to solve trust
problems and reward those who complete the perception task. Yuan et al. [45]
proposed a reliable distributed CS reward system based on blockchain technol-
ogy, which allows high-reputation participants are more likely to receive more
rewards for completing tasks. Wang et al. [46] proposed a blockchain-based on-
board energy information transmission incentive scheme, which uses reputation
based on partial trust and credibility calculation to derive and construct an
incentive model to stimulate electric vehicles to complete tasks collaboratively.
Bellavista et al. [47] proposed an edge-based distributed CS architecture, which
supports distributed user incentives in the MCS model and improves the scal-
ability of infrastructure between distrust sensing platforms. Calado et al. [48]
proposed a blockchain-based anti-tampering incentive scheme that makes each
participant trust others by user participation rewards scores stored in shared
records. Weng et al. [49] proposed a federal predictive service incentive frame-
work that provides a real reward prediction and uses blockchain to ensure the
fairness of transactions. Xu et al. [50] proposed a CS incentive mechanism based
on the reward-punishment model, which is used to build a hybrid crowdsens-
ing platform to avoid malicious activities by minority groups and enable users
to trust each other. Gruhler et al. [51] proposed a blockchain-based reputa-
tion scheme, which encourages users to cooperate and avoid malicious behavior
by providing necessary incentives for task workers. An et al. [52] proposed a
blockchain-based CS data transaction system that uses a reliability rating mech-
anism based on homomorphic cryptography to prevent sellers from reporting
false information and manipulating auctions. Yun et al. [53] introduced a pri-
vate blockchain in the CS system, which establishes a trust relationship between
service requesters and workers and makes users act as monitors for each other. An
et al. [54] proposed a quality control model of CS based on consensus blockchain,
which uses a double consensus method to ensure the fairness of user rewards.
Liang et al. [55] proposed a blockchain-based CS application program, which uses
a trusted execution environment to solve the problem of malicious requesters
deceiving workers by issuing abnormal sensing tasks.

3.2 Incentive Mechanism Based on Reward Form
In the blockchain-based CS system, user groups need to use different forms of
incentives according to different scenarios. Therefore, we divide the incentive
mechanism into social service, game playing, and monetary reward.
Social Service. In social-service incentive mechanisms, crowd sensing scenarios
are regarded as social networks. All members can act as requesters and workers
at the same time, providing services and receiving services, and are encouraged
to achieve common community goals. Khalid et al. [56] proposed a data storage
system, which uses roadside units as nodes to build a blockchain and provides
monetary rewards to vehicles that offer sensing data in the Vehicle Ad Hoc
Network. Kim et al. [57] designed a crowd-sensing intelligent parking system
based on a multi-blockchain structure, which enables users to transparently trade
sensing data in blockchain social networks. Cai et al. [58] proposed a robust and
verifiable crowd-testing system framework, which enables blockchain nodes to
serve social crowd-testing applications and create a stable network ecosystem
through incentive mechanisms.
Game Playing. In game-playing incentive mechanisms, the process of crowd
sensing is regarded as an entertainment game. The requester and the worker par-
ticipate in the game as players and maximize each other’s benefits through con-
tinuous interactive games. Qiu et al. [59] designed a distributed multi-terminal
resource allocation incentive mechanism based on the Walras equilibrium the-
ory to ensure that the supply and demand of each terminal in each region
are balanced. Jiang et al. [60] proposed a distributed industrial internet of
things data-sharing scheme, which models the data transaction between data
owners and edge devices as a multistage Stackelberg game. Lv et al. [61] pro-
posed a blockchain-based spectrum sensing system, which models the transac-
tion between requesters and workers as a reward-sensing time game so that
both can adopt strategies to maximize their welfare. Xu et al. [62] proposed a
smart-contract-based network insurance framework, which can speed up miners’
verification and packaging transactions into the blockchain to enable workers
to obtain rewards quickly. Zhang et al. [63] proposed an alliance-blockchain-
based distributed vehicle-mounted crowd sensing service architecture, which uses
the Stackelberg game method to achieve the best task reward distribution. Wei
et al. [64] built a smart-contract-based MCS platform, which performs price
equilibrium processing through smart contracts and distributed algorithms to
achieve the best use of resources and reward fairness in the market. Liu et al. [65]
used Q-learning to solve the dynamic game under the sensor model unknown for
users, which achieves a balance between the CS platform and participants. Hu
et al. [66] proposed a mobile crowd sensing framework based on blockchain and
252 X. Xu et al.
federated learning, which formulates game rules compatible with incentives to
maximize the benefits of both requesters and workers. Huang et al. [67] pro-
posed a blockchain-based industrial MCS system, which uses dynamic reward
ranking incentive mechanisms to reduce the imbalance of multiple sensing tasks.
Hu et al. [68] proposed a three-stage strategy for different participants and task
requesters, which ensures the fairness of the sensing data market by the Stack-
elberg game incentive mechanism.
Monetary Reward. In monetary-rewards incentive mechanisms, crowd sensing
scenarios are regarded as trading markets. Incentive requesters provide workers
with monetary rewards to encourage them to collect data. Xu et al. [69] pro-
posed a role-centered incentive mechanism, which maximizes the utility of partic-
ipants through a reverse auction incentive mechanism and dynamic programming
worker selection method. Wang et al. [70] proposed a prediction-based reverse
auction incentive mechanism, which selects the workers with the minimum mov-
ing distance and the lowest bidding price according to the prediction results of
the semi Markov model. Pang et al. [71] proposed a smart-contract-based crowd
sensing framework based, which realizes fair user transactions and efficient task
reward allocation by analyzing user information. Liu et al. [72] proposed a cryp-
tocurrency incentive mechanism in a distributed software crowdsourcing system,
which rewards workers providing high-quality service.
3.3 Comparative Discussion of the Typical Incentive Mechanism
Existing blockchain-based CS incentive mechanisms have their advantages and
limitations. For example, the incentive model based on two-layer reinforcement
learning [23] can formulate better strategies, but its learning process is time-
consuming. Incentives using zero-knowledge proof methods [35] can protect infor-
mation privacy, but contract execution costs are relatively high. Although the
k-anonymous multi-chain architecture [36] can effectively protect the employ-
ees’ privacy during the reward distribution process, it lacks control over system
traffic. Although based-smart-contracts automatic data evaluation [53] can build
user trust relationships and achieve credible incentives, the reference factors for
data evaluation are not comprehensive. Table 1 summarizes the typical incentive
mechanisms in prevtious studies.

4 Challenge and Future Directions
Through the classification introduction and discussion in the previous chapter,
we have understood the research work of the crowd sensing incentive mechanism
in the current blockchain environment. However, the crowd sensing incentive
mechanism in the blockchain environment still faces some challenges.
254 X. Xu et al.
Incentive Efficiency. To improve the accuracy of evaluation and verification,
most of the nodes in the blockchain will participate. However, as the num-
ber of crowd sensing users increases, the multi-point verification feature of the
blockchain may cause the execution efficiency of the incentive mechanism to
decrease. The decrease in incentive efficiency will dampen the enthusiasm of the
holders of the sensing equipment to participate in the sensing activities. There-
fore, in the future, the incentive mechanism needs to be balanced between data
reliability and incentive efficiency. For example, design a reasonable verification
node selection mechanism to reduce the number of unnecessary verification nodes
to improve the efficiency of the incentive mechanism.
Collaborative Incentives. As user privacy protection requirements increase
and sensing scenarios become increasingly complex and changeable, the single-
chain structure can no longer meet user sensing needs. The multi-chain structure
will be adopted to cope with the multi-domain complex environment. There-
fore, the design of the future incentive mechanism requires a collaborative rela-
tionship between perceived users of different chains. For example, the incentive
mechanism is combined with a cross-chain consensus mechanism to realize multi-
domain crowd sensing and cross-chain collaborative incentives.
User Trust Evaluation. The user’s trust relationship is a significant factor in
the incentive mechanism. The existing trust relationship evaluation parameters
are not comprehensive enough, which easily leads to unfair transactions between
requesters and workers. The future incentive mechanism needs to refer to the
trust relationship established by various factors, such as the incentive mechanism
that considers the bidirectional preferences of requesters and workers.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have reviewed the latest research results of the based-blockchain
CS incentive mechanism. Firstly, we have introduced the research background of
the CS incentive mechanism based on blockchain. Second, we have used a two-
dimensional classification framework based on the main incentive goal and the
reward form to summarize the current blockchain-based crowdsensing incentive
mechanism. Then, we have discussed and compared typical incentive mecha-
nisms. Finally, we have proposed challenges the blockchain-based CS incentive
mechanism faces and future development directions in terms of incentive effi-
ciency, collaborative incentives, user trust evaluation. We hope that this paper
can provide a good reference for the research of crowd sensing incentive mecha-
nisms in the blockchain environment.
