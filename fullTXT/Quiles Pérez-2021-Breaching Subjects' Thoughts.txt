Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) started being used in clinical scenarios, reaching nowadays new fields such as entertainment or
learning. Using BCIs, neuronal activity can be monitored for various purposes, with the study of the central nervous system
response to certain stimuli being one of them, being the case of evoked potentials. However, due to the sensitivity of these data, the
transmissions must be protected, with blockchain being an interesting approach to ensure the integrity of the data. *is work
focuses on the visual sense, and its relationship with the P300 evoked potential, where several open challenges related to the
privacy of subjects’ information and thoughts appear when using BCI. *e first and most important challenge is whether it would
be possible to extract sensitive information from evoked potentials. *is aspect becomes even more challenging and dangerous if
the stimuli are generated when the subject is not aware or conscious that they have occurred. *ere is an important gap in this
regard in the literature, with only one work existing dealing with subliminal stimuli and BCI and having an unclear methodology
and experiment setup. As a contribution of this paper, a series of experiments, five in total, have been created to study the impact of
visual stimuli on the brain tangibly. *ese experiments have been applied to a heterogeneous group of ten subjects. *e ex-
periments show familiar visual stimuli and gradually reduce the sampling time of known images, from supraliminal to subliminal.
*e study showed that supraliminal visual stimuli produced P300 potentials about 50% of the time on average across all subjects.
Reducing the sample time between images degraded the attack, while the impact of subliminal stimuli was not confirmed.
Additionally, younger subjects generally presented a shorter response latency. *is work corroborates that subjects’ sensitive data
can be extracted using visual stimuli and P300.
1. Introduction
Technology is closely linked to our daily lives, making it
impossible to think about performing some tasks without
direct or indirect help. *is is mainly due to the constant
evolution of technology and the current trend to make it
more user-friendly. Consequently, new technologies based
on computer-human interaction, such as Kinect devices [1]
or Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), have gained relevance
for the last decades. BCIs provide a bidirectional channel
between the brain and external devices, enabling two modes
of use [2]. On the one hand, BCI can stimulate or inhibit
neuronal activity to treat neurodegenerative diseases. On the
other hand, they can also monitor brain activity to diagnose
diseases or control external devices.
BCIs can be mainly classified into two categories
depending on their invasiveness level in the human body [3].
On the one hand, there are invasive interfaces, for which a
surgical operation is necessary. *is is the case of brain
implants [4], which can either pass through the cerebral
cortex to measure the activity of single neurons or be
implanted on the cerebral cortex surface to measure the
activity of groups of neurons. *e application scenarios for
this type of interface are usually clinical due to the impact on

the subjects’ physical integrity. On the other hand, nonin-
vasive BCIs have electrodes placed on the head surface to
capture the transmission of electrical impulses during brain
activity, known as electroencephalography (EEG). In this
case, the obtained signal is the aggregation of the neurons
located in the area close to the electrodes. In summary,
noninvasive BCIs provide less accurate measurements than
invasive, as the skull weakens the signal and adds noise.
However, the advantage of avoiding the surgery in nonin-
vasive approaches and the price justify why noninvasive
BCIs are much more extended than invasive in entertain-
ment scenarios.
*anks to the evolution of technology associated with
BCIs, they have gone beyond the medical field and have
reached other sectors such as entertainment and video
games [5], where the purpose is to give players a greater
sense of immersion. In the same way, the clinical sector has
also advanced and expanded the use of these interfaces. For
example, the literature has proposed gamification processes,
which seek to know the subject’s emotional state, subjecting
it to a training process called mindfulness [6]. Another field
of application, where BCI has been tested, is in industrial
robotics, where the control of robots is sought to implement
significant precision tasks with brain activity [7]. *is last
application is one of the most promising due to the in-
crement of life expectancy in society. It is associated with a
progressive increase in the number of people in a situation of
dependence. *e evolution towards aging societies demands
new solutions to assist the elderly, requiring help to carry out
daily life activities. In this sense, BCI systems can be ex-
tremely beneficial, as they facilitate a new way of interacting
with the different devices existing in their environments [8].
*erefore, BCIs contribute to an increase in the dependent
people’s autonomy, improving their quality of life and their
integration into society.
One of the most well-known application scenarios of
BCI is the study of bioelectric potentials produced as a
response of the central nervous system to certain stimuli.
*is is known as “evoked potential” (ERP) [9]. *ere are
several types of evoked potentials, such as visual, auditory, or
sensory. *anks to the study of these evoked potentials,
diverse information can be obtained from the subject. For
example, the subject’s intelligence has been related to the
latency of appearance of the evoked potential; the higher the
intelligence quotient, the shorter the latency time of the
evoked potential [10]. *e evoked potential P300 [11] is a
response of the brain that occurs about 300ms after a
“significant” event has taken place (hence the name P300,
“P” since it is a positive increase in brain voltage and “300”
because, as mentioned above, it occurs about 300ms after
the event). *is potential is mainly observed in the occipital
and parietal areas of the cerebral cortex. *e events that
provoke this wave can be visual and auditory. However, this
work focuses on visual stimuli. *is potential can be in-
tentionally provoked by following the Oddball paradigm
(among others), which is based on randomly showing a
series of known stimuli in a set of unknown stimuli. One of
the most famous scenarios, where this paradigm has been
tested, is with the P300 Speller, which, in a very abbreviated
form, is a matrix of letters illuminated by rows and columns,
whose purpose is to try to guess the character on which the
user has placed his attention [12].
In particular, the P300 [11] potential appears when the
subject already knew the stimulus presented to him/her.
*erefore, malicious use can cause some privacy implica-
tions that must be taken into account when using BCIs. *e
first and most important is to study whether it is possible to
obtain sensitive information from the subject through
evoked potentials. For example, images can obtain private
personal information, such as ideology or sexual orientation.
*is could apply to people with high relevance, such as the
Prime Minister, whose data would be highly valued. On the
other hand, if less prominent users are targeted, the attacks
could obtain banking information for financial gain. In this
sense, Martinovic et al. [13] carried out a series of experi-
ments to obtain bank details or known locations through the
P300. *e experiment concluded that it was possible to
detect when a subject knew a specific visual stimulus. *is
cybersecurity issue becomes even more dangerous when the
stimuli are produced without the subject being aware of
them. It is the case of subliminal images or, in other words,
images that subjects are not conscious of seeing, but they
have been processed by the brain (or not). Moreover, the
data obtained and transmitted by BCIs are critical. Because
of that, BCI technologies could benefit from the application
of existing cybersecurity mechanisms such as blockchain
[14], a promising solution to improve the security of the data
and prevent attacks affecting the integrity of P300. However,
the subliminal aspects of these stimuli are not clear in the
literature and are, therefore, an open challenge. Due to the
fact that there is only one paper dealing with the impact of
subliminal attacks (Frank et al. [15]), many questions remain
open about the methodology of these experiments. Some of
the issues that are sought to be clarified are as follows: (1)
how much time the images should be shown, (2) how much
the sampling time of stimuli should be reduced, (3) whether
images should be entirely invisible, or (4) whether the re-
action is uniform in all subjects, among others. In this
context, different parameters should be considered when
experimenting in this field. As an example, we highlight the
sampling time of the images and the way they appear.
Similarly, these images should be shown to a more signif-
icant number of subjects, in which different ages and genders
should be considered. After this, some new and strong
conclusions indicating whether the results are similar to
those obtained in the literature experiments should be
provided.
To improve some of the previous challenges, the first
contribution of this work is the implementation of a BCI
framework able to acquire, process, and store the EEG signal
to detect a P300 wave. *is framework also displays, in a
visual way, the EEG signal, which allows detecting if there is
a P300 or not. Once the framework is implemented, the
second contribution, and the main one, is the creation of a
set of experiments, where different videos show known and
unknown visual stimuli (following the Oddball paradigm) to
different subjects wearing a BCI headset, in which EEG is
acquired and managed by the BCI framework to show the
2 Journal of Healthcare Engineering
P300 wave graphically. *e experiments gradually reduce
the sampling time of the known stimuli to study how this
aspect affects the generation of the P300 wave. *ey begin
with a visible image, shown during 500ms, and ends with an
invisible, or subliminal, image (shown during 10ms). It is
also important to mention that these experiments have been
carried out with ten subjects of different ages and gender to
obtain the most reliable results. After performing the ex-
periments, it is determined that, for the supraliminal ex-
periments (experiments from one to four), a P300 potential
is generated about 50% of the time on average for all subjects.
If attention is focused on how characteristics affect the
generation of the P300, younger subjects generate P300
potentials with a slightly shorter latency. Concerning the
fifth experiment, based on subliminal stimuli, no evidence
has been obtained that they generate an impact on the
subject’s brain.
*e remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 introduces the related work existing in the liter-
ature. After that, Section 3 describes the architecture of the
framework built to deal with data acquisition, processing,
and visualization developed, followed by an analysis of the
experiments and the results obtained. Finally, Section 5
highlights conclusions and future work.
2. Related Work
*is section reviews the existing literature concerning
cybersecurity in BCI, studying possible attacks and em-
phasizing those focused on attacking the integrity of the
user’s sensitive information. After that, it analyzes the im-
pact of subliminal stimuli from a psychological perspective,
indicating how this issue has been approached over the years
and how effective these stimuli are.
2.1. Oddball Paradigm and Potential P300. *e most com-
mon way to induce the generation of a P300 potential has
been through the Oddball paradigm [16], based on pre-
senting a known stimulus from a larger set of unknown
stimuli [17]. Following this pattern, numerous experiments
based on the Oddball paradigm and the generation of P300
potentials have been performed. In these experiments, it is
studied how the parameters used to present the stimuli affect
the P300 wave [18].
Moving to the application scenarios, in which Oddball
and P300 have been used, there are numerous studies
proposing many applications for this paradigm (see Fig-
ure 1). For example, Campanella et al. [19] performed an
experiment, where they combined both visual and auditory
stimuli to increase the clinical sensitivity of these P300
modulations like amplitude or latency. Other studies have
focused on studying how the different physiological factors
of the subject affect the generation of P300, as in Kamp [20],
where they focused on the age of the subjects. *is paradigm
has been extensively used in the medical field, specifically for
the detection of mental illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease
[21], Alzheimer [22], schizophrenia [23], locked-in syn-
drome [24], or disorders such as anxiety [18].
*anks to the progress made by BCIs in recent years,
these scenarios have been able to go beyond the medical
sector and reach other areas. For instance, the video game
sector aims to obtain greater immersion while playing [25].
Another area, where they have had a great impact, is ro-
botics. *is is based on the control of robots through the
P300 potential [7], being useful for people with psychomotor
problems, allowing the use of robotic extremities or pros-
theses. Moreover, Arrichello et al. [26] proposed the creation
of an assistant robot to performmanipulation tasks that may
help in daily life operations controlled by the P300 potential.
Finally, the generation of the potential using the Oddball
paradigm has been used for user authentication, for ex-
ample, based on the recognition of a set of faces [27].
2.2. Cybersecurity on BCI. Although BCIs have significantly
progressed in recent years, studies addressing cybersecurity
in this area are scarce, being nowadays an open challenge
[28]. In this context, there has been a recent attempt to study
the problem of cybersecurity in BCI, where there are works
that have partially studied specific aspects of cybersecurity in
BCI, such as the possibility of disrupting neuronal signaling
during neurostimulation [4]. One of these studies [29] has
proposed the classification of attacks depending on the field
of application of BCI, as neural applications, user authen-
tication [30], entertainment, and video games, and smart-
phone applications.
A work performed by Landau et al. [31] studied the
feasibility of obtaining information about a subject’s per-
sonality while playing video games using a BCI. *is ex-
periment was developed using different machine learning
algorithms to classify the data captured during the game.
Once the data were available, they were compared with those
obtained when the subject was resting. With this, they
obtained 73% of accuracy, enough to demonstrate that they
could violate the privacy of the subjects who had undergone
the experiment.
Meng et al. [32] created an experiment, where they
focused on the integrity of the captured data, applying
deliberate modifications to them. In the same way, Sun-
dararajan [33] developed a laboratory scenario, where the
author ran tests with different attacks to the proposed
scenario. *ese attacks were as follows: (1) passive eaves-
dropping, intercepting the data without the user being
aware, (2) active interception, able to collect the data and
discard or resend them, (3) denial of service, and (4) data
collection, modification, and retransmission to obtain a
different response.
Focusing on possible attacks through visual stimuli [34],
Martinovic et al. [13] showed four different types of images
in their experiment: (1) automated teller machines (ATMs),
(2) debit cards, (3) geographical points, and (4) famous
people. With these images, the authors sought to obtain
private information about the user, especially the user’s
residence, using the geographic points. *e images appeared
randomly throughout the experiment, and each image had a
duration of 250ms. Before starting the experiments, the
subjects had to pass a training phase, where each user’s P300
Journal of Healthcare Engineering 3
was classified. For this training, random numbers were
displayed, and the user was asked to count the number of
occurrences of each number, which was used as a
calibration.
Frank et al. [15] tested subliminal attacks effectiveness in
extracting private information, following the same protocol
as for supraliminal stimuli. *e procedure consisted of an
initial calibration phase of the BCI using a series of random
numbers. *e protocol consisted of showing a 15-minute
video, taken from the film “*e Gold Rush” (1925), with
images of former President Barack Obama and another
unknown person inserted. *ey concluded that the results
were similar to those obtained previously with supraliminal
images, being able to extract information from the subjects
without them knowing they were being studied.
Table 1 shows a comparison of the parameters used in
this work with respect to the literature. Since these pa-
rameters could be different depending on the objective of the
studies, they have been compared with works that have a
similar purpose, which is compromising the integrity of the
user’s data. *e most relevant parameters have been con-
sidered, such as when the images are displayed or the task
the subject has to perform.
Although there are studies in the literature on subliminal
and supraliminal attacks, the scarcity of studies and the
different methodologies used do not allow comparison.
Because of this, the next section analyzes subliminal stimuli
from a psychological point of view to determine if they are
biologically possible.
2.3. Subliminal Stimuli. Subliminal stimuli are extremely
controversial, with researchers disagreeing on whether they
affect human behavior or not. *e first time these stimuli
were used was in 1972 by the market analyst Karremans [35].
In this experiment, he showed on the screen of a cinema the
phrase “Drink Coca-Cola”, and according to his results, the
sales of Coca-Cola increased by 20%. Years later, he ad-
mitted that he had never conducted this experiment. In
addition, such stimuli have been studied before, for example,
by Freud [36]. He determined that stimuli could have a small
influence on factors such as sleep or wakefulness. Lundy and
Tyler [37] indicated that there are subliminal effects in
audiences exposed to sound or visual messages when the
voice volume is lowered, because this change in perception
demands greater, sometimes extreme, attention from the
listener. As their perceptual capacity is enhanced, they
generally pick up what is meaningful, which is what has been
previously encoded with this intention.
Another use of this type of stimulus is called priming
[38], an effect related to implicit memory, whereby exposure
to certain stimuli influences the response to the presented
stimuli [39]. *is concept is widely used in the educational
field, for example, when a teacher asks students to read the
topic before the lesson. *is first read improves later at-
tention in class due to the priming effect [40]. However,
following this methodology, several experiments have
proposed this approach to influence users’ decisions [39].
Nevertheless, many other experiments deny that this has a
real impact on the user [41].
In general, visual stimuli are not well established, and
numerous studies claim they are useless. Pratkanis et al. [42]
reviewed more than 200 works and concluded that none of
them provided reliable evidence that subliminal messages
influence behavior. Many of these works did not find the
desired effect, while those finding an effect suffered from
methodological flaws. In this regard, Moore [43] stated:
“there is no empirical evidence for more substantial sub-
liminal effects, such as eliciting specific behaviors or changes
in motivation”. *ere is some evidence of subliminal per-
ception (not persuasion), i.e., minimal processing of in-
formation that escapes the conscious mind. An example of
this is the so-called cocktail party phenomenon [44]. *is
situation consists in increasing the attention of a subject after
identifying his/her name, even when the attention was fo-
cused on different tasks. *is indicates that the brain is
processing information without being aware of it. However,
so far, no studies have demonstrated the effects on moti-
vation and behavior similar to those claimed by advocates of
subliminal persuasion.
To emphasize subliminal stimuli ineffectiveness, Prat-
kanis et al. [42] conducted a study of retail audio tapes
containing subliminal messages aimed at improving either
self-esteem or memory. Neither self-esteem nor memory

improved in any of the subjects. *is experiment was re-
peated two more times, and the results showed that the
subliminal stimuli did not have any effect.
3. BCI Framework: Generation, Acquisition,
Processing, and Visualization of P300
*is section describes the design and implementation details
of each element defining the proposed BCI framework,
which is graphically represented in Figure 2. *e first phase
is responsible for EEG acquisition, which hosts the software
in charge of connecting the BCI device to the computer. In
the same way, it saves the acquired data for later processing.
Once the data is stored in a file, the EEG processing pro-
cedures must be performed. *e purpose of this phase is to
facilitate the study of the P300 in the next stage. For this, it is
necessary to follow a series of steps, such as filtering, editing
(e.g., downsampling to resample the signal), and labeling the
data. Such labeling allows marking the points of interest like
stimulus appearance, stimulus disappearance, and time of
appearance of the P300. Finally, the last step of our proposal
is the Visualization of the P300. For this, the framework
graphically displays the EEG to allow the identification of the
P300 potential, the main goal of this work. Each of the
processes that integrate the framework and the functions
they perform is detailed below.
3.1. BCI Headset. One of the fundamental pillars of this
work is the BCI headset, which makes it possible to obtain
the brain waves of a subject and develop the necessary
experiments. *erefore, the choice of the BCI device is of
vital importance for the objective pursued.
*e equipment used in this work is the OpenBCI
UltraCortex Mark IV EEG Headset [45], which is oriented
towards the academic sector. *is BCI has several advan-
tages, such as the setup speed, as the BCI configuration is
straightforward, or its low cost compared to other devices
with similar specifications. However, it cannot be used for
medical purposes due to the low number of channels and the
limited accuracy of its electrodes. Also, the BCI kit adds
electrodes that can be attached to the body, which allows
performing ECG to measure cardiovascular activity or even
study muscle activity (EMG).
*e OpenBCI UltraCortex Mark IV EEG Headset in-
tegrates its intelligence in the Cyton biosensing board. In
addition, the BCI is connected to the computer via Blue-
tooth, where the computer uses a USB receiver, enabling the
reception of data. *e BCI headset follows the international
format 10-20 System and offers 35 placement positions,
which can be seen in Figure 3. Although the interface can use
up to 16 electrodes simultaneously, this work considers 8
electrodes. In particular, the locations selected are FP1, FP2,
C3, C4, P7, and P8. Additionally, we have used O1 and O2,
because they correspond to the occipital area of the brain,
responsible for reacting against visual stimuli.
Once the BCI is ready, the next step is to configure the
presentation of both known and unknown images. For this,
the framework implements a Python script that allows
displaying images and marks the timestamp at which it has
been exposed. In particular, the script saves, in Unix
Timestamp format, the starting and ending times of the
experiment and the exact time of the stimulus appearance.
*is will be used in subsequent processes for the labeling of
the EEG signal. It is also relevant to mention that the script
has several configurations for different experiments,
adapting the sample rate of the target images (more details
in Section 4). Finally, it is essential to note that, as it is not a
static video but a process running on the machine, it may
inevitably delay. *e idea is to reduce as much as possible
the background processes running on the machine and
assign real-time priority to the process, both for memory
and CPU.
3.2.EEGAcquisition. *e software used by the framework to
acquire the EEG signal is OpenBCI GUI, offered by
OpenBCI. *is application is the one that best adjusts to our
needs, and the simplest one, although it also has some
disadvantages. Among the advantages, it allows seeing
graphically and in real-time the data received from each
electrode, making it easier to perform initial calibration and
check that electrodes are touching the scalp correctly. An-
other advantage is to record the experiments and later re-
produce them. *ese reproductions are possible, thanks to
the fact that it saves all the data in a file. Nevertheless, this is
also a disadvantage, since the text file format is only un-
derstandable by the OpenBCI application, and it is not
unique between different versions of the application.
*e OpenBCI application offers compatibility with
Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) communication functionality.
LSL [46] is a library designed to allow the transmission of
data between different devices. Several tools have been
built on top of this library, such as data recording, file
import, and applications that allow data from various
acquisition hardware (a BCI, for example) to be available
on the laboratory network. OpenBCI GUI uses this
protocol as a gateway to other applications. In particular,

the possibility of reproducing a specific experiment al-
ready developed, and its complete transmission via LSL to
other software generates a considerable potential for
experimentation.
After the reception of the data, the next step is to store all
the data into a portable file, which external applications can
understand. *e file format selected for this purpose is CSV.
*erefore, an external application is needed to receive the
data via LSL and convert it into a CSV file. *is functionality
is provided byOpenViBE, a platform dedicated to the design,
test, and use of BCI. OpenViBE is extremely intuitive, since it
is based on the so-called “boxes.” Each box offers a specific
functionality, such as file writing, data filtering, or graphical
representation of the data. *is offers the possibility of
deploying a complete scenario, which receives the data,
processes them by applying the selected filters, and exports

them to a CSV file. *e proposed solution uses OpenViBE,
which assembles a scenario that receives the data through
LSL, exporting them to a CSV file.
3.3. EEG Processing. *e EEG processing phase intervenes
after storing the recorded EEG. Our framework usesMatLab
for EEG processing since it is one of the most widely used
software devices for this purpose. *ere are a large number
of plugins that extend the Matlab functionality, with Lets-
wave [47] being one of the most used and well known for
BCI. Letswave is specially optimized for EEG data and
provides multiple functions for processing neurophysio-
logical signals, including data processing and analysis of
time- and frequency-domain signals, also presenting a GUI
to ease the process. Additionally, it allows the comparison of
the data between each of the steps performed, such as filtered
and unfiltered data.
After configuring Letswave, the framework imports the
data previously stored in the CSV file. Letswave version 7
offers the possibility of importing data from Matlab. Once
the data are loaded into the framework, it applies the notch
filter at 50Hz and a band-pass filter between the frequencies
of 5Hz and 30Hz. Finally, a 5Hz downsampling is per-
formed, leaving the signal with 50 samples per second
(originally 250). At this point, algorithms for feature ex-
traction such as ICA [48] or Bilinear Analysis [49] could be
applied.
After processing, the next step is to label the data. For
this, one more column is added to the data called “control
column” (Figure 4). *is column has all values set to zero,
except when a stimulus is displayed, which will have a higher
value than the rest of the data. In this way, it is easier to
discriminate the points of interest in the graphs.
3.4. P300 Display. With the EEG data ready for study, the
last process of the framework is to plot the EEG and detect
possible P300. Several tools are available for this purpose.
Letswave 7 offers a module with a series of functionalities for
creating figures and the graphic representation of the EEG.
*e graphing data module of this tool helps make the first
contact and check that the data is correct. However, the
generation of figures exported for external use is complex, so
this option has been discarded. *us, the figures have been
created with Excel, as it is simpler and meets the require-
ments for the purposes we are pursuing.
For the visual identification of the P300 potentials, the
literature has visually studied the behavior of the signal in
terms of voltage and amplitude. *e shape of a P300 po-
tential starts with a decrease of the signal, which can reach
negative voltage values and then increase the voltage until a
peak that will have a slight decrease in the voltage. After this,
the maximum voltage peak occurs, in our particular case,
usually up to 40 µV.
4. Experiments
*is section details the design and setup of the experiments
performed and the protocol used to conduct them. In this
sense, this section offers information about the subjects
intervening in the experiments, including relevant personal
and medical information. Finally, we compare the results
obtained and analyze whether there are similarities between
them.
Figure 5 presents the scenario used to validate the
framework, whose functionality has been tested with ten
subjects. In particular, both target and nontarget images
were presented to the subjects wearing a BCI Headset. *e
cerebral activity captured due to these stimuli was used as
input to the implemented BCI framework. Moreover, the
personal information of these subjects can be found in
Table 2. In general, most of the subjects participating in the
experiments had an average of 23.7 years old, being mainly
men. Most subjects had no diagnosed neurological diseases,
except for one subject who presented hyperactivity and
attention deficit disorder.
Five individual experiments were performed on each
subject, based on sampling target images differentiated from
a more extensive set of nontarget images, with about an 8%
probability of occurrence. *ese experiments aimed to de-
tect whether these target images produced a P300 potential
in the subject. *e target images have been displayed at the
same size as the nontarget images. Likewise, no attempt has
been made to hide them, but they have been displayed full
screen. *e videos shown in the five experiments were a
series of images with a total average duration of 50 seconds
(depending on the sample time of the target image). *e
experiments differed on the sampling time of target and
nontarget images, decreasing the target images sampling
time in each successive experiment (500ms, 250ms, 100ms,
50ms, and 10ms).*e sample times of the nontarget images
remained at 500ms regardless of the experiment.
*e target images were personalities known by the
subjects (Figure 6(a)), shown to them before starting the
experiment to ensure that they were recognized. Unfamiliar
images were neutral images, which the subjects were not
familiar with, usually of natural landscapes (Figure 6(b)).
*ese images varied from experiment to experiment, thus
preventing them from being recognized by the subjects.
Similarly, the number of times the target image appeared was
randomized.*is is because of what has been studied in state
of the art, where it is confirmed that the time between target
images influences the generation of the P300.
Concerning the protocol followed for the execution of
the experiments, we begin by detailing the environment, in
which the subjects were at the time of the experiment. In this
sense, a room with as little noise as possible was selected to
avoid the subject receiving external stimuli that could
generate noise in the EEG or alter the generation of the P300.
Subjects were asked to try to avoid all possible movements,
especially facial movements. *ese movements add a sig-
nificant amount of noise to the data acquired and may cause
a P300 wave to be lost. Similarly, they were asked to count
the number of occurrences of the target image mentally.*is
is not necessary to generate a P300, although we ensure that
the subject is concentrating on the experiment. Between
each experiment, approximately 30 seconds was allowed for
the subject to settle back in and check that all electrodes were

still in contact with the scalp. It also allowed the subject to
pay more attention to the new experiment, avoiding fatigue.
Once the details of the experiments have been presented,
we analyze the results obtained from each experiment. To
validate the EEG signals acquired, a figure from the literature
is taken as a reference, including both P3a (target) and P3b
(nontarget) Figure 7. *e results obtained for each subject
and experiment are shown in Table 3. In this table, three
possible types of responses to a target image are identified.
*e first consists of the identification of a P300 (✓), the
second is that no P300 has been detected (7), and, finally, a
pattern resembles the P300, but it is not possible to confirm
it (?). *e values for each cell represent a value over the total
of three or four tests, depending on the experiment. For
experiments 1, 3, 4, and 5, there are three occurrences of the
target image, while, for the second experiment, there are four
events of the target image. *e circumstances are different,

so that the subject does not always search for the same
number of occurrences, and thus provoke a higher P300.
For the first experiment, in which the images were shown
for 500ms to the subjects, at least one P300 wave was ob-
tained in all subjects, indicating that the subjects’ brain
commonly recognized this duration of the image. In total,
for all subjects, 17 P300 waves have been elicited, exceeding
50% of presented P300.
For experiment 2, the target image sampling time was
reduced to 250ms, and the number of times the target image
is displayed was increased. In this case, 16 P300 waves have
been detected, representing a 40% of occurrence over the
total number of target images presented. *is is 10% lower
than in experiment 1 and may be due to reducing the target
image sampling time. However, many factors can influence
this reduction, such as subjects’ concentration in performing
the task.
Experiments 3 and 4, whose sampling time is 100ms and
50ms, respectively, present similar results. For these ex-
periments, 50% of P300 waves have been obtained con-
cerning the displayed stimuli. *e results between
experiments are quite similar, because the stimulus that the
subject receives with these sampling times is quite similar
(the image cannot be observed too clearly). However, there is
an improvement between these two experiments concerning
experiment 2, although the sampling time has been reduced
by more than half. We highlight that this situation could be
caused by the perception that subjects have over the

sampling time, where the transition between target and
nontarget images is more clearly appreciated than the target
image itself.
Finally, experiment 5 reduces the sampling time to
10ms, representing the situation in which the images are
subliminal. *e aim is to study whether this stimulus can be
processed by the brain or not. In this experiment, some
results have been classified as doubtful. *is is motivated by
certain variations existing in the EEG during the intervals,
where the P300 should appear, between 200ms and 1000ms
after the stimulus, that could be interpreted as P300 po-
tentials. However, this cannot be confirmed to be the case,
because they differ with the usual latency and peak voltage.
In the same way, according to the literature, where it is stated
that these stimuli do not impact brain activity, it is most
likely to be noise from other external factors.
*e time required to perform the experiments can be
divided into two phases. On the one hand, the time needed to
generate the EEG and, on the other hand, the time required to
process it and display the P300. For the calculation of the total
time, the following aspects have been considered: the prep-
aration of the stage and checking of the correct functioning of
the material (ten minutes approximately), each sample of
images that lasts about five minutes, and two minutes that are
left between each video for rest to avoid visual fatigue. *is
would make a total of 35 minutes for the conduction of all the
experiments for each subject. After this, preprocessing is
applied, which takes about 20 minutes, while image gener-
ation takes 20 minutes per experiment, 100 in total for the five
experiments. In summary, for each subject, the total amount
of time, starting from the moment when the EEG is captured
until it is processed and converted into images, can be cal-
culated as follows: preparation time+ (image sampling time ∗
5+ rest time ∗ 5) + preprocessing time+ (image creation time
∗ 5)� 10+ (5 ∗ 5+ 2 ∗ 5) + 20 + (20 ∗ 5)� 165 minutes/per
subject.
Analyzing the results in terms of the subjects, and not
focusing on each individual experiment, we have observed
that older subjects have a slightly longer latency to onset of
P300. *is may be why there is a reasonably uniform dis-
tribution, since the ages are not too far apart (16–31 years).
On the other hand, the gender difference does not seem to
have affected the P300 potential. However, it is not possible
to delve too deeply into the gender difference due to the
imbalance between males and females in the experiments.
5. Conclusions
*is work presents a study of the feasibility of visual attacks
aiming to compromise the privacy of the user’s data
employing the P300 potential. For this purpose, a scenario
based on EEG-based BCI technologies has been designed.
*erefore, as a contribution of this work, a BCI framework
has been developed to supply all the BCI cycle phases. *e
experiments performed first display known (target) and
unknown (nontarget) images to the subject. Simultaneously,
the BCI framework receives and stores the EEG sent by the
BCI device. Once the data have been stored, they are cor-
rectly processed and displayed to detect the existence of a
P300 event visually. To test its functionality, five experiments
have been designed, tested on ten subjects. In each of these
experiments, the sampling time of the target image has been
reduced (500ms, 250ms, 100ms, 50ms, and 10ms), starting
from supraliminal stimuli to subliminal stimuli. It is worthy
to mention that a comprehensive and exhaustive configu-
ration of experiments has been performed, improving an
important gap existing in the literature and helping un-
derstand if subliminal stimuli can generate P300 waves, or
not. After the experiments, we have observed that supra-
liminal stimuli produced P300 over 50% of the time in the
subjects. On the other hand, no evidence has been found that
subliminal stimuli produce any impact on the users’ brains.
Some different conclusions have been obtained; for example,
a more significant number of P300 were obtained in people
with younger age and with a shorter latency.
As future work, we will focus on subliminal stimuli
differently, such as hiding them in the video, e.g., following
the approach of Frank et al. [15]. On the other hand, we plan
to improve the conditions in which the experiments have
been performed, using an environment more isolated from
external stimuli. Regarding the BCI used, we also plan to
increase the number of electrodes used to 16 and use muscle
electrodes. In the same way, it is planned to increase the
number of subjects participating in the experiment, trying to

In this way, it will be possible to conclude more clearly
whether these parameters affect the P300 potential.
