Abstract—Gallium Nitride (GaN) is now a popular choice for 
power conversion. High voltage (HV) GaN HEMTs (GaN 
FETs) in the range of 650-900 volts are emerging as the next 
standard for power conversion. This paper highlights key 
successes in efficient and compact converters/inverters 
ranging from high performance gaming/crypto-mining power 
supplies, titanium class server power, servo drives, PV 
inverters, and automotive OBCs, dc-dc converters, pole 
charges. The reasons for market success including unmatched 
quality & reliability, high volume GaN on Si manufacturing, 
robust performance in applications as well as challenges to 
achieve the full potential of GaN FETs are presented.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
With its proven ability to reduce size (form factor) and save 
energy (high efficiency) 650V GaN FETs have now been 
adopted in the mass market. GaN provides cost-competitive, 
easy-to-embed solutions that reduce energy loss by >50 
percent, shrink system sizes by >40 percent, to simplify 
converter/ inverter design and manufacturing, also contributing 
to system cost reduction. An un-compromised need for power 
market is quality and reliability. We have achieved this through 
appropriate choice of device, package and outgoing quality 
standards. Next, overall product performance in application 
including uniformity and repeatability across millions of parts 
is a must. We tackle this via vertically integrated manufacturing 
and Si-like production discipline. Third, strong application 
support and deep understanding of GaN key circuit topologies 
is required. Last but not least, clear system or circuit level value 
proposition/cost benefit is essential for adoption.   
II. HIGHEST ROBUSTNESS NORMALLY OFF GAN 
A.  Normally off product configuration 
We have designed, qualified and mass produced a 2-chip 
normally off 650V GaN platform, integrating a low voltage Si 
FET input/drive stage with a high voltage GaN output stage 
(Fig. 1). Among the approaches to make a normally-off high 
voltage GaN switching device, this approach [1] offers 
strongest gate robustness over the p-GaN alternatives [2] with 
low safety margins (Table 1) and much lower complexity than 
the multi-chip direct-drive based designs [3]. It is noteworthy 
that every Si-MOSFET consists of a normally-off input portion 
(gate control) with a normally-on output portion (high voltage 
drift region), that happen to be integrated in one device [4]. We 
have integrated two separate die in one package in a die-on-die 
configuration with minimum inductances to achieve best of 
both worlds- highest gate/input strength of the proven Si LV-
MOS (with its ideal Si-SiO2) dielectric gate and the high- 
performance high-voltage GaN HEMT to deliver low loss, 
high voltage switching and reliability. The result is a normally-
off power device package with hard to beat combination of 
reliability, robustness, design margin and performance.  
B. Package Choices- Thermal management is key 
Along with the device, a robust and easy to use package is 
key for a power product. The basic concept that heat from any 
semiconductor die is removed via the package through the 
system heat sink is many times overlooked. Whether it is 
surface mount products to benefit from GaN’s high frequency 
capability (reaching 100s of KHz or MHz scale) or the more 
classic TO packages to get kilo-watt class power that avail of 
GaN’s high efficiency/low loss switching capability; a solid 
thermal interface without undue system complexity is a must. 
Industry work-horses such as the TO220 & TO247, their 
surface mount equivalents as the D2Pak & D3Pak or DIP style 
and top side cooled modules offer robust package environments 
(Fig. 2). These have been coupled with simple but powerful 
high frequency/high speed switching design philosophies, to 
result in GaN parts with stable operation at multi kW at high-
speed/multi-100 KHz to MHz and performing better (Fig.3).  
III. QUALITY AND RELIABILITY 
Suppliers are adopting common standards for reliability 
needs. While being part of this industry effort, our philosophy 
is to establish comprehensive reliability testing of products that 
achieve industry firsts in qualifying 650V GaN products for the 
marketplace. Instead of academic arguments of JEDEC 
standards applicability to GaN, the question customers ask is if 
GaN products are not passing JEDEC tests then what is wrong 
with those GaN products? Our approach is that JEDEC 
qualification for GaN (existing standards) is necessary but not 
sufficient and must be backed up by other comprehensive tests 
suited for GaN products (Fig. 4)

A. Qualification and Intrinsic Reliability  
In addition to achieving successful JEDEC and AEC Q101 
qualification of the 650V GaN platform [5], intrinsic lifetest 
along with associated failure modes and acceleration factors 
was also reported with both voltage and temperature based 
acceleration factors for the critical high voltage reverse bias 
failure mode [6], shown in Fig 5. Use plots indicate wear out of 
the device at 480V does not begin before 1 million hours, at any 
temperature within the ratings. 
B. Quality levels/FIT rates 
A key consideration is that parts may fail prior to intrinsic 
lifetime due to defects not screened out in the manufacturing/ 
test process including infant mortality or random failures 
during the useful life. Practically, potential fails in the first 105 
hours for a given mission profile need understanding. The 
robustness of our 650V GaN FETs to well over 1000 Volts 
enables testing to failure using voltage acceleration with a 2 
dimensional reliability matrix against voltage and temperature. 
Both FIT (Failure in Time) for constant failure rate (also 
equivalent to MTBF) and PPM (Parts Per Million) testing was 
done per the detailed methodology based on JEDEC std. 74A 
Annex G [7], reported elsewhere [8]. The results (Fig 6) predict 
FIT of 1.3, along with an annual failure rate of 0.001% (~ 
10ppm) at 520V, 100C. This preliminary but comprehensive 
study gives a strong proof point of quality levels and field 
performance predictability for GaN devices.  
C. Application centric (Switching) reliability considerations 
We have also subjected our devices to switching stresses 
including comprehensive HTOL testing under actual power 
conversion operation at 175C, 300 KHz for 3000 hours (Fig 7) 
and accelerated switching at 150 KHz, Room Temp-125C at 
more than 1000 volts. No significant change is observed during 
as well as before/after HTOL testing.  Initial accelerated 
switching tests indicate switching lifetime >108 hours (Fig 8).  
IV. MANUFACTURING SCALE AND METRICS 
It is a requirement that for any technology to exhibit the 
highest levels of quality and reliability, high levels of wafer-fab 
and product yields with adequate process capabilities and 
control must be established. Transphorm’s commercial JEDEC 
and AEC qualified GaN HEMT power products are 
manufactured in an automotive grade 6-inch Si CMOS wafer 
fab. We have previously reported Silicon like manufacturing, 
yields (Fig 9) and process capabilities for our HV-GaN 
manufacturing [9]. Further, complete SPC tracking and control 
charts for hundreds of manufacturing/test parameters is routine.  
V. APPLICATION PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM VALUE 
The ultimate proof of the accepted reliability and robustness 
standards comes from use of the high voltage GaN products 
from various suppliers by a wide customer base. This has 
already started and many leading companies are now in 
production with high voltage GaN devices.  As examples, 
Corsair has introduced best in class 1.6kW gaming power 
supplies with unparalleled performance at par cost based on the 
Totem Pole architecture enabled by 650V/50mohm GaN in 
TO247 packages (Fig. 10), Bel Power Systems has introduced 
these 50mohm TO247 products in their 3kW TET3000 
Titanium class Server Power Supplies [10] and Yaskawa 
Electric has introduced TO220 based products in an innovative 
integrated servo amplifier-motor drive system [11]. With strong 
circuit benefits (Fig 11) and ability to reduce size, weight and 
improve miles per gallon, GaN FETs are being designed in EV 
& HEV applications such as on & off board chargers and 
auxiliary power conversion in the 3-10kW range.   
VI. CHALLENGES- SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS 
Challenges for wide adoption lie in the areas of system 
integration, robust supply, standards and cost improvements.   
In systems, GaN offers high value within the AC to DC 
bridgeless totem-pole PFC, which unlike the well-established 
analog based classic boost PFC use digital programming.  The 
Totem-pole PFC though using similar control techniques 
requires ground up development with additional needs such as 
soft start control and polarity definition with firmware design 
knowledge. Focused reference design such as the 3.3 kW PFC 
reference (Fig 12) assist customers get over this digital control 
hump. Having GaN solutions with sufficient drive margin 
(gate robustness), preferably with off the shelf standard drivers 
also aids system design experience.  
As another challenge, customers designing with GaN must 
be assured performance in actual ac operation during power 
conversion as claimed on the datasheet and not suffer from any 
dynamic effects. In addition to designing for and 100% 
monitoring for such dynamic effects control, we ensure that 
datasheet ratings and maximums include such effects. In other 
words, what you see should be what you get. The good news 
for the GaN industry is now that this standard is widely agreed 
and various manufacturers have embraced it. 
A robust supply chain with multiple sources enables user 
confidence. Transphorm has partnered with Fujitsu to establish 
6-inch GaN wafer manufacturing in an automotive certified Si-
wafer foundry in Aizu-Japan (now beginning to offer 3rd 
generation products) while others like GaN Systems, Navitas 
and EPC avail external foundries in Taiwan. Like Transphorm, 
companies like Infineon, Panasonic control their manufacturing 
lines, a distinct advantage in the first 10-15 years of any new 
semiconductor ramp. Transphorm is also committed to expand 
partnerships, including establishing credible second sources for 
its products. Finally, GaN device costs are on course for 
continuous reduction to approach and in some cases already 
beat Si Super-junction, especially at the system level. 
VII. SUMMARY AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As GaN FETs launch into an exciting growth phase with 
multiple suppliers, continuous focus on reliability, supply 
assurance, value/cost will enable user confidence that will let 
GaN challenge the existing slots and be a forerunner for new 
growing power conversion applications like automotive.  
The authors sincerely appreciate the contributions of the 
broader Transphorm team, our vendors, manufacturing partners 
notably Aizu-Fujitsu foundry, customers and financial partners 
in making this happen.
