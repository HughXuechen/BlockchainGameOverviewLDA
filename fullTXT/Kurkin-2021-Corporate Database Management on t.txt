Abstract
Purpose: The work is aimed at developing a scientific
concept of corporate database management on the basis of
cloud, quantum, blockchain technologies and big data
processing technologies on the principles of efficiency
and security in the context of the digital economy of the
region on the example of the North Caucasus Federal
District of the Russian Federation. Design/method/
approach: The authors consider passports of the federal
projects “Information security” and “Digital technolo-
gies” of the national program “Digital economy of the
Russian Federation” from 07.11.2019. The authors ana-
lyze the statistics of financial support of digitalization of
the Russian economy from 2018 to 2024. They determine
the current level of development and future prospects of
digital technologies in the world economy on the basis of
materials of the National Research University “Higher
School of Economics”. Findings: The conceptual model
of corporate database management on the basis of cloud,
quantum, blockchain technologies and big data process-
ing technologies on the principles of efficiency and
security was developed. Scenario analysis of corporate
database management on the principles of efficiency
and security in the regions of the North Caucasus
Federal District of the Russian Federation with the
application of game theory methodology was conducted.
Originality/value: It has been substantiated that the
management of corporate databases based on cloud,
quantum, blockchain and big data technologies to meet
the criteria of efficiency and security should be organized
in a systematic manner and be based on the capabilities of
the region. This forms a fundamentally new scientific
concept of the organization of the process under study,
which reflects the view on it not from the standpoint of an
isolated enterprise, but from the standpoint of the region’s
enterprises. Owing to this, security is provided with the
support of the state, the risks are distributed among the
enterprises of the region and full-scale financing allows
maximizing the advantages. Circulation of regional
enterprises allows establishing electronic document cir-
culation and formation of an integral network of corporate
databases in the region, thus further increasing manage-
ment efficiency.

1 Introduction
Management of corporate databases determines the infor-
mation support of enterprises and therefore is the key to the
reliability of its assessment of the current internal and
external (market) situation, as well as making informed and
rational tactical and strategic decisions. Evaluation of cor-
porate database management is associated with the applica-
tion of two criteria. The first criterion is efficiency. As well
as in any economic process, the studied management

practice should provide advantages for the enterprise, the
value of which exceeds the cost of their achievement.
This means that corporate database management is not an
end in itself, but a tool for creating business benefits. The
costs of collecting corporate information and its processing
should be commensurate with and not exceed its importance.
This criterion orients the management to set priorities in the
field of information, that is, its sorting and ranking, and the
preference for the most demanded information in the enter-
prise. As the volume of information in the information
society grows, compliance with this criterion becomes more
and more complicated and requires close interaction of the
manager with the employees of the enterprise.
The second criterion is security. Most of the information
is attractive to business only if it is unique, which requires
maintaining its confidentiality and commercial confidential-
ity. It should be noted that this applies not only to advanced
technologies but also to other intangible assets of the
enterprise, including its know-how and information on
market conditions. Compliance with this criterion varies
with different types of information. For example, when
information is stored orally and is inseparable from the
medium (informal data), it is necessary to prevent staff
turnover. Information on paper media requires physical
security of the company building and legal support for
non-disclosure of corporate information.
In the digital economy, new additional and expanded
opportunities for improving the practice of corporate data-
base management emerge based on the breakthrough digital
technology Industry 4.0, the most promising of which are
cloud, quantum, blockchain and big data processing tech-
nology. Although the criteria for achieving and assessing the
degree of optimality of corporate database management
remain the same, their application requires a new scientific
and methodological approach. The digital form of data
allows for automatic data classification and is subject to
cyber-security risks.
This work is aimed at developing a scientific concept of
corporate database management based on cloud, quantum,
blockchain and big data processing technologies on the
principles of efficiency and security in the context of the
digital economy of the region, using the example of the
North Caucasus Federal District of the Russian Federation.
2 Materials and Method
A literature review of the topic has shown that the oppor-
tunities and benefits of the application of selected break-
through technologies in the Industry 4.0, in particular, cloud,
quantum, blockchain and big data technologies in corporate
database management are presented in publications by
Abdulkadyrov et al. (2017), Buchaev et al. (2014), Gadzhiev
and Buchaev (2014), Khachaturyan et al. (2017, 2018),
Petrenko et al. (2018), Gadzhiev and Buchaev (2014),
Khachaturyan et al. (2018), Popkova (2019), Popkova et al.
(2019, 2018), Petrenko et al. (2018), Popkova and Parakhina
(2019), Popkova and Sergi (2018, 2019), Ragulina (2019),
Sergi et al. (2019), Sergi (2019).
However, the existing literature sources contain only
individual recommendations and disparate fundamental
conclusions and applied solutions, while the holistic concept
of corporate database management based on breakthrough
technologies of Industry 4.0 is absent, the criteria for evalu-
ating this management in the context of the digital economy
are not specified, and the regional context is not taken into
account. This work is intended to fill in the gaps identified.
As a result of studying the passport of the federal projects
“Information security” and “Digital technologies” of the
national program “Digital economy of the Russian Federa-
tion” from 07.11.2019, we found that the issues of ensuring
the efficiency and security of advanced digital technologies
in Russia are given significant attention, as evidenced by the
data on their financing (Fig. 1).

As shown in Fig. 1, government spending on
“end-to-end” digital technologies in Russia in 2024 will
increase three times as compared to 2018, and the volume of
spending on information security products and services will
increase from 56 billion rubles in 2018 to 167.22 billion
rubles in 2024, that is three times. The materials of the
National Research University “Higher School of Eco-
nomics” also present the current level of development and
future prospects of digital technologies in the world econ-
omy, which are illustrated in Fig. 2.
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the volume of the world
market of big data as services (BDaaS) in 2018 is $8.9
billion, and by 2024 it will increase to $31.7 billion, which is
almost four times. The volume of the world market of
quantum encryption in 2008 is 285.7 billion dollars, and by
2022 it will increase to 944 billion dollars, that is more than
three times. Market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocur-
rencies representing distributed registry systems (block-
chains) as of 2018 is estimated at $250 billion.
Consequently, there are significant prospects for the devel-
opment of breakthrough technologies in the Industry 4.0 at
the global level.
3 Results
We have discovered that in the regions of the North Cau-
casus Federal District only individual private and public
initiatives are being implemented to introduce digital tech-
nologies into the practice of corporate database management,
which leads to restrained results. In order to accelerate the
modernization of the practice, we have developed a con-
ceptual model of corporate database management based on
cloud, quantum, blockchain and big data processing tech-
nologies on the principles of efficiency and security (Fig. 3).
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the corporate database of the
enterprise is formed from its internal information, and
information comes from external sources—state regulators,
consumers, contractors and competitors. The top manager
performs analytics of this information with the help of big
data processing technologies. All internal and external
stakeholders have access to the corporate database through a
blockchain—a chain linked to the source database, but
separate segments of information.
In this way each user generates their own database and
stores it in their own cloud, and the corporate database is
also subject to cloud backup. Quantum security technology
prevents unauthorized access by unauthorized users. The
developed scheme allows maximizing the benefits and
guaranteeing the security of enterprise database management
based on cloud, quantum, blockchain and big data process-
ing technologies. At the same time, the issue of costs is not
addressed and needs further research. For its study in this
paper, a scenario analysis is conducted using the method-
ology of game theory in the regions of the North Caucasus
Federal District of the Russian Federation (Table 1).
Table 1 demonstrates that at present (2019) the advan-
tages (cost estimate of innovative goods) in the regions of
the North Caucasus Federal District of the Russian Federa-
tion is 34722.4 million rubles. Capital expenditures on
technical innovations amount to 8956.8 million rubles. We
have estimated the security factor (cybernetic risks) at 0.5 (in
fractions from 1). The efficiency of the scenario implemen-
tation is calculated as follows: 34722.4*0.5/8956.8 = 1.94.
So, taking into account the advantages of the security, risks
exceed the costs by 1.94 times. In this case, not break-
through but ordinary digital technologies (computer, Inter-
net) are used.

pendent implementation of breakthrough technologies by the

enterprise—promotes a slight increase in efficiency up to
2.33 and security up to 0.6. Scenario 2, referred to as inte-
grated digitalization—breakthrough technologies imple-
mentation within the cluster of enterprises—further increases
efficiency (up to 3.33) and security (up to 0.75).
The most preferable scenario is the third one, involving
regional digitalization. In this case, the modernization of
entrepreneurship is carried out within the framework of the
relevant program of the region with state financial support.
This makes it possible to increase the level of security not at
individual enterprises, but in the region as a whole (up to
0.9) and to distribute costs evenly among market partici-
pants, so that efficiency (despite the increased complexity
and probability of 0.75) increases to 4.36.
4 Conclusion
Thus, to meet the criteria of efficiency and security, man-
agement of corporate databases based on cloud, quantum,
block and big data technologies should be organized in a
systematic way and be based on the capabilities of the
region. This forms a fundamentally new scientific concept of
the organization of the process under study, which reflects
the view on it not from the standpoint of an isolated enter-
prise, but from the standpoint of the region’s enterprises.
Owing to this, security is provided with the support of the
state, the risks are distributed among the enterprises of the
region and full-scale financing allows maximizing the
