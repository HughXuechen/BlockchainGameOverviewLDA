Abstract
Purpose – The real estate world finds itself at a tipping point of a transition: a dramatic and irreversible
shift in (real estate) systems in society. This paper is a State of the art of Disruption, Blockchain and Real
Estate in the Netherlands and international.
Design/methodology/approach – The following questions were asked to all those involved: What do
you think is the essence of Blockchain for real estate? What is the most current situation with respect to
Blockchain and real estate from your perspective? Which publications are important from your perspective?
What do you expect with respect to the impact of Blockchain on real estate for (social) real estate? What are
questions for the future for real estate and Blockchain? In addition, interviews, exploratory conversations and
correspondence took place, and the content was peer reviewed.
Findings – Changes in value concepts affect the valuation of real estate and the thinking about it. The
orientation of changing users and owners of real estate affects innovativeness, values and flexibility in
managing that property. Orientation on disruption must be seen as proof that the real estate world is able to
actually innovate the accumulated assets and consolidate this. The financial and real estate markets are
markets that exaggerate through irrational behaviour. Fear of “eat or be eaten” determines people’s
behaviour. Financial and thus real estate markets are always unstable and must always be regulated by
people and organizations.
Research limitations/implications – The question that remains is whether it is important to look at
disruptive innovations in existing markets or newcomers in the real estate market and Blockchain. The
question is whether Blockchain is only a technological disruption, or a real game changer, and whether the
entire value chain of the real estate market will embrace it. No two disruptions are the same. Trust in
Blockchain is a prerequisite for guiding the predictable form of that disruption where start-up companies use
new technology to offer cheaper and inferior alternatives to real estate in the market. You could also talk
about anti-fragile value: “Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility,
randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of
the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile” (Taleb, 2012), in
other words: attention to disruption and Blockchain creates a viable real estate economy.
Practical implications – The true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate still needs to be
investigated. The author is still curious to understand and clarify the value of Blockchain for real estate
processes. Doubt continues to exist and is therefore a feeding ground for further research, because we do not
knowwhat we have not seen.
Social implications – Looking at the impact of Blockchain on real estate, a number of conclusions can be
drawn. First of all, the relationship between Blockchain and real estate has not yet been proven in practice. It
is expected to develop further in the form of registering transaction processes and the DNA passport of a real
estate object. Secondly, completeness and transparency are the basic ingredients for trust in the system.
Third, real estate wants to remain viable. For this reason, taking the offense is necessary for real estate and
management to connect with social demand. Behaviour also leads to new earnings models of the social and
economic spin-off of disruptive real estate. If the Dutch real estate sector embraces Blockchain and is able to

realize innovations, there are opportunities for real estate entrepreneurs to exploit the disruptive character to
provide those new services.
Originality/value – The way in which disruption, Blockchain and real estate will develop in the coming
years are not the only obvious characteristics of a particular era but also its social impact and user behaviour.
This also applies to how this real estate transition can best be tracked, guided and utilized in society at the
international, national and regional level. Disruptive organizations clearly respond to the viability of
the (built) environment and therefore determine competitive strength. This affects the current and future
valuation of real estate.

Introduction
Does real estate still have the value that it had, or is the valuation of real estate going to
change due to surprising products and services, innovative business models, other market
strategies, innovative ways of organizing and managing in (real estate) markets? Innovation
revolves around good facilities in an attractive and stimulating environment. Take
disruptive real estate. The driving forces behind these developments are new technology,
manoeuvrability, organizing differently and management. These forces greatly influence
the valuation of real estate. Established names such as Nokia, Kodak, Blockbuster, Oad,
Free Record Shop, Hyves and V&D are collapsing and, for example, Hema, Shell, hotel
chains and health-care institutions are the least affected. Disruptive organizations like
Amazon, Zalando, Uber and Facebook, who are going to develop a complete residential area
in California, Tesla and its competitor Faraday Future, who wants to surpass Tesla in
everything, respond to viability in the environment. This viability determines the
competitiveness and thus affects current and future valuation of real estate. Blockchain, a
distributed database that maintains a growing list of data items and that is hardened
against manipulation and counterfeiting, plays an important role in that. Notaries and
brokers have already encountered this during the recent period, and it will have further
impact on property owners, financiers, users, builders, brokers, notaries and the land
registry. The real estate world is therefore at a turning point of transition: a profound and
irreversible tilting of (real estate) systems in society, and “technological opportunities that
we can hardly anticipate” (Dijkstra, 2017). The International Monetary Fund also
acknowledges the major possible consequences of changes in our financial and thus real
estate system and held a meeting at the highest level in April 2017 about Blockchain,
chaired by Christine Lagarde.
Viability determines competitiveness strength and generally has four building blocks for
its development:
(1) looking outward (external focus);
(2) following good examples closely (connecting leadership);
(3) self-organizing units (flexible work organization); and
(4) modelling and generating (flexible processes and IT).
To develop that viability, a number of competencies are Important, such as continuous
insight into customer behaviour, process-oriented steering, dynamic skills, strategic
alliances and networks and meaningfulness. Disruption is usually associated with the
development and application of new technology by organizations. Characteristic of these
organizations are often a small headquarters, few staff, own results responsibilities,

autonomy of the various parts and professionals and flexibility of staff upon request.
Fundamental changes in the market in housing, work, education, health care and transport
will therefore affect real estate, as well as technology in buildings. But which real estate fits
these new developments of disruption, and what is Blockchain’s impact on real estate? First
of all, we consider how disruption works.
What is disruptive real estate?
Disruption is a predictable pattern in all sectors where start-ups use new technology
(Vermeend and Smit, 2017) to make it possible for “something new and small” to penetrate
“something existing and big” in a short space of time. At the moment, many start-ups are
disturbing different sectors by competing with the established representatives. But how
does disruption work? Ex-Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky gives an answer through a
framework he designed in which he distinguishes four phases of disruption: disruption,
evolution, convergence and re-imagination. The four phases disruption, evolution,
convergence and re-imagination of disruption are specified in the table below. On the right,
we see the established order (incumbent); on the left, we see the challenger (disruptor) who
grows from a niche solution to an advantage for everyone (Table I).

The renowned magazine The Economist praised the disruptive-innovation theory of Clayton
Christensen as “one of the most influential modern business ideas” ever. The theory has
been repeatedly used to explain the success of companies such as Netflix, Spotify, Uber,
Airbnb, Faraday Future and Tesla. Disruption is the new religion preached from Silicon
Valley. However, the question is howmuch value we should attach to this faith?
The first publication of the basis of the theory of disruptive innovation is by Clayton
M. Christensen, dating back to 1995 (Christensen and Bower, 1995) when the internet
was barely existent. According to him, for example, Uber and WhatsApp are not typical
disruptive innovations. According to him, it is just a simpler product for a target group
with little money and lower expectations. Examples of those products are the
smartphone with ever-new apps that displace the personal computer or Bitcoin
replacing current payment traffic. A newcomer is therefore in the optics of Christensen
much more successful than innovations that make an existing market because this
market would respond directly to external innovations. So, one disruption is not like
another. Disruption is a predictable pattern in sectors where emerging companies use
new technology to provide cheaper and inferior alternatives to products of established
players in the market. An example of this is Toyota, which took on the battle with
Detroit a few decades ago.
Disruption matters and brings about physical changes. Google in Silicon Valley
evolved there where people are physically brought together in buildings that are
primarily aimed at exchanging knowledge and stimulating creative processes.
Behaviour that shakes loose new technology leads to new business models: the social
spin-off is at the heart of the revolution (Bikker, 2016). The true revolution often takes
place in everyday practice. An investment like the Google data centre Groningen is a
result of a convergence of things. Groningen has been chosen precisely because of the
availability of energy, good infrastructure, the Dutch climate and the point where the
fibre-optic connection between the USA and Europe passes by and thereby forms a
global network. Innovation and productivity are also strongly promoted by high
population densities and masses, fast transportation systems and highly specialized
universities such as the UMC Groningen with its new Proton Therapy Centre, The State
University of Groningen and the Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, with
its knowledge centres. Imagine if you are evaluated as an organization based on, for
example (Sfirtsis and Broekman, 2016):
� the number of visitors per quarter in a retail chain;
� the contribution of an office concept to employee satisfaction;
� the flexibility of a shopping concept based on seasons and lifestyles;
� the amount of time a property is rented by a user; and
� effectively bringing together all the necessary parties (including the end user) to
achieve the ultimate customer experience.
Then the (real estate) world looks different, if the user is really leading. Health care, for
example, is also organized in a different way as a result of more new treatment methods
than we have developed so far. Examples of these new methods of treatment include
haemodialysis (kidney dialysis), monitoring high-risk pregnancies, chemotherapy (Erasmus
Hospital), infusion therapies and palliative Intensive Care (Westfries Hospitals and Medical
SpectrumTwente).
The foregoing examples indicate that these issues will affect current and future real
estate with themes such as:
F

� clear, distinctive value propositions;
� price erosion, different margins and price competition;
� valuation in the short and long term;
� overcapacity;
� demand changing faster than supply; and
� power imbalance in the real estate (value) chain.
The disruptive changes in the real estate world, as we know it, will even further strengthen
and demand different real estate. Buildings that do not take into account the rapid changes
are less viable. Organizations that use real estate as a business asset and take lessons
learned from the Corporate Real Estate Management field to heart are more viable (Veuger,
2014, p. 132). Real estate must be adaptable, disrupting, in a good location and sustainable
and distinctive. And it must be all of that in a context where the spatial and built
environment stimulates innovation and promotes knowledge sharing and cooperation.
Within the city of Groningen and beyond, the surrounding areas demand a well-functioning
network to make spatial connections and share facilities. At the national and international
level, concentration of highly specialized developments and top research institutes is needed.
Innovation revolves around more than excellent facilities in an attractive and stimulating
environment. Take disruptive real estate. If real estate can be disruptive, what relationship
is there with Blockchain? When we want to understand the world of Blockchain, we need to
understand the innovation of the currency of Bitcoin, which is based on the underlying
technology called Blockchain.
The relationship between Blockchain and Bitcoin
Blockchain could have a huge impact on the value chain in real estate. This includes
thinking about efficiency, transparency, ownership, value (transfer), automation and service.
If we want to understand the world of Blockchain, we need to understand the innovation of
the currency of Bitcoin, which is based on the underlying technology (Seibolt and Samman,
2016) called Blockchain. Bitcoin is a combination of four individual elements: cryptography,
a peer-to-peer network, an open-source protocol and a shared ledger. This makes it a
phenomenon that people are enthusiastic about. The applied cryptography (first element) is
complex but comparable with banks, which use it to secure their transaction traffic. The
peer-to-peer network (second element) we already know from the exchange of music
exchange. The essence of this is that a network of parties, called miners, validates the
transaction register worldwide. This means that there is no exclusive right to that network,
and it is not possible to turn a particular location on or off. The network is connected with
the third element, with which the underlying software is fully public: an open-source
protocol. This allows everyone to see how the software is programmed. All of this is unique
in that Bitcoin is already an alternative money on the internet, and it is growing very fast.
To illustrate: on January 1, 2017, the Bitcoin rate went through the $1,000-dollar limit (e953).
The most striking thing about Bitcoin is that value is transferred without involving a
trusted third party such as a bank, notary, broker or cadastre. That is unprecedented
relative to the current financial and real estate world with a third party as a safe agency
between the buying and selling party. But is Bitcoin the future? No, according to Blockchain
expert Dennis de Vries, it is not, but the underlying Blockchain technology is.
The internet makes it possible to transfer information quickly, cheaply and paperlessly
without the need for any intermediaries. Blockchain gives the same benefits for transferring

values. The internet is used to transfer word and image; Blockchain, for money and asset
transactions. Blockchain is a combination of two elements:
� a shared and distributed ledger with synchronized data spread across multiple sites,
countries and/or institutions; and
� cryptography – a digital token with a monetary value.
Blockchain has a number of benefits in realizing real estate transactions: preventive
mediation, fraud prevention and the use of smart contracts. But what is the meaning of
Blockchain for the real estate sector?
Blockchain and the real estate sector
The financial sector has become excited about how Bitcoin has programmed the value transfer
and how the transactions are processed without having a third party, such as the government or
bank, part of a transaction. All banks worldwide have their own IT systems that are complicated,
communicate inefficiently and let transactions take place. There is a realization that this can be
much simpler with a customized open-source protocol. And why would that not apply for real
estate? An important discussion about this theme also concerns the cadastre, with the registering
of property ownership. Blockchain can be a more efficient way of registration to transfer
ownership. However, the critical footnote should be placed here that real estate also exists in the
real world in trading with Blockchain. There will have to be a clear connection between the
administration in Blockchain and the physical property. At this time, this connection is not (yet)
scientifically proven. What we see is that heavy investments are being made in, for example, a
new global registration system on the basis of Blockchain and that established parties see
opportunities tomake processes simpler and to developmore user-friendly systems.
Key advantages of Blockchain is that changes can no longer be made once a block has
been added. This means that errors must always be corrected before a transaction can be
done. Adjustments always remain visible in Blockchain, thus keeping the registry
transparent and providing the basis for trust in the system. This allows, for example,
duplicate expenses to be avoided and no shadow transactions can occur.
With the help of Blockchain, we can bring together all information about buildings and
give access to parties who need the information. It then works as a kind of building
passport. Thus, a data room is created in which different information from buildings is
stored. Any interested party can add information from, for example, tenants, valuations,
history andmaintenance plans. Banks can also check the financing more easily andmonitor,
for example, cash flow. According to Yermack (2017), professor and expert on Blockchain,
the work now done by auditors will disappear. With the Building Information Model (BIM),
data will also exchange information about design and materials use that can contribute to a
circular economy. Demolition of a building and responsibilities for installation technology
become more transparent and clearer with BIM. With a change of ownership, it is also very
easy to change the complete building passport. Other examples of application areas include
title registration, service costs, real estate as a service, building maintenance, settlements of
various forms of taxation, real estate valuations such as the WOZ, refurbishment value for
insurers and records of an Association of Owners (VvE).
Two changes
The real estate sector will also face two fundamental changes:
(1) the use of the Blockchain in the real estate sector itself; and
(2) the broad social impact as a result of the users of real estate.
F
36,1/2
108
A first major change through the application of the Blockchain is in the registration and
processes of real estate titles, due diligence processes, simplification of currently
complex transactions, faster turnaround times of transactions and more liquidity
(Wessels, 2016). Blockchain’s technology allows contracts to be smart and can therefore
be executed under predetermined conditions. Real estate finance can also be further
automated with Blockchain, or it can contribute to the simplification of crowdfunding.
The big advantage of these movements is that the real estate market will become more
transparent, the quality of (real estate) data will increase and fraud prevention becomes
more effective. The second major change is the social impact as a result of designating
the users of real estate. If we draw a comparison with the developments with the
internet and its impact – see the social impact of smartphones – new patterns of users or
real estate will change significantly. Existing institutions will disappear or change
significantly, other parties will rise.
Developments of blockchain
TopTeam ICT has taken the initiative to establish the Blockchain Competence Centre (BC3),
in which scientists, governments, social and industrial partners are working on building
Blockchain expertise in The Netherlands. BC3 thus meets the concerns expressed by the FD
about the lack of Blockchain expertise in The Netherlands. René Penning de Vries has been
appointed by theMinistry of Economic Affairs as the standard bearer for TopTeam ICT.
Blockchain has the advantages of being more efficient, more transparent, faster and
safer. But when can we expect Blockchain in The Netherlands? According to Jo Bronckers,
chair of the International Blockchain Real Estate Association (IBREA) and the international
trade association promoting the application of Blockchain in the real estate sector:
I think we are at the start of this technological change. The first step was to build a network
infrastructure that allows data to be exchanged. The real estate world also sees added value in
this and is investing in getting more and better data. For example, an initiative such as the Real
Estate Taxonomy, which streamlines the standardization and digitization of real estate data to
improve the interchangeability of real estate data between banks, investors and valuers (Real
Estate Journal, 2017).
There are a number of movements to be distinguished at the international, national and
regional level.
Internationally
According to Jo Bronckers, chair of IBREA, The Netherlands should be the forerunner in
Blockchain technology. It is expected that the disruptive power of Blockchain’s technology
will increase worldwide (KPMG, 2016). For example, in Dubai there are already plans to
have all government documents in Blockchain by 2020. Singapore is also accelerating
developments in this area. Both cities are comparable to The Netherlands because the
administrative layers are well-connected and the distances between the authorities are short.
In addition, The Netherlands has a good digital infrastructure, a highly educated population
and the Dutch easily adapt to circumstances. In addition to the fact that the Dutch
Government has adapted Blockchain, several pilots have also been launched in the real
estate area in The Netherlands. Through this move, the possibilities for the real estate world
can be explored and transformed into global entrepreneurship of and with real estate.
Bronkers states:

I see through the IBREA network what is happening worldwide, and I dare to say sincerely that
we now have very good opportunities in the Netherlands to make this disruption work to our
advantage.
In 2016, the research of Spielman (2016) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) – one of the most prestigious technical universities in the world – appeared. This
exploratory study into “recording property titles” compares the benefits and limitations
of Blockchain with the current system of registration in Nashville (Davidson County),
TN. Following this thesis, they also launched an actual pilot project.
Nationally
The Netherlands also has ambitions for working with Blockchain. This is evidenced by
presenting an action agenda with the National Blockchain Coalition (Dutch Digital Coalition,
2017) with three objectives:
� Developing Blockchain building blocks, such as digital identities: The first step is to
develop so-called digital identities that enable individuals, objects and legal entities
to perform digital transactions as part of a Blockchain.
� The realization of the conditions for utilizing Blockchain: Working on solutions in the
area of legislation and acceptance.
� Developing and realizing the Human Capital Agenda: For knowledge development,
agreements are made about training, sharing knowledge and increasing skills, i.e.
investing in human capital.
The founding partners of the National Blockchain Coalition are expecting Blockchain and
digital trust to greatly affect financial services, logistics, energy supply and, eventually,
health care. They mainly see positive effects on the autonomy of citizens, transparency of
transactions, cyber security and reduction of administrative burdens. The participating
parties in the coalition are ABN AMRO, ING, Volksbank, Rabobank, PWC, Nationale
Nederlanden, Havenbedrijf Rotterdam, Enexis, Alliander, the Koninklijke Notariële
Beroepsorganisatie, Brightlands, the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Infrastructure and
Environment, Security and Justice, Domestic Affairs and Royal Relations, the Delft
University of Technology, Tilburg University, Radboud University, TNO, RDW,
Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens, The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research,
Kamer van Koophandel, Inspectie voor Leefomgeving en Transport and the CWI. The social
perspective is introduced by ECP (Platform for the Information Society). Supporting
organizations are: Financial Markets Authority, Betaalvereniging Nederland, the
Nederlandse Bank, Dutchchain, Dutch Association of Banks, SIVI, StartupDelta and the
Dutch Association of Insurers.
Pouwelse is currently leading the Delft Blockchain lab and is the founder of Tribler, the
research team at Delft University of Technology. The Tribler team is the world’s largest
experimental research team working on self-organizing internet systems. The team focuses
on defining an attack-resilient and legally valid social media infrastructure. “We are still the
only player with working technology in this area. We are running hard to go live this year”
(Pouwelse, 2017). The prototype developed under the leadership of Pouwelse is provided
with software terminals that enable other stakeholders to work on services around the
Blockchain mortgage process. Examples of this are a service that bundles money offers to
contracts that cover a mortgage application or market transparency facilitation services and
static information about the online mortgage market (Zaal, 2017). Pouwelse: “TU Delft is not
going to be a mortgage lender, but we have made the technology that could trigger an online

ecosystem of start-ups in and around financial services”. The ABN AMRO Bank is
responding positively to TU Delft’s initiative. “The collaboration and technology brings us
insights into how the future with Blockchain can look, what the role of financial institutions
is therein and what value we can offer to our customer as a bank”, explains Head of
Innovation Centre Arjan van Os (Zaal, 2017). ABN AMRO, in collaboration with IBM, has
also launched a Blockchain experiment (Bikker, 2016), bringing together information related
to the building. Due to Blockchain’s “single source of truth”, banks are also convinced that
through smarter contractual opportunities, the real estate industry is going to change
significantly. Among other things, work is being done on so-called “proof of concepts” to
investigate how Blockchain can eliminate uncertainty about collateral taxation (Os, 2016). In
addition to the research of Gout (2017) about one Block-mortgage, a Blockchain-inspired
business model for mortgage financing, Dijkstra (2017) conducted exploratory research into
the real estate management process of sales and management. His research will reveal the
potential opportunities lie for applying Blockchain in real estate processes and where this
needs to be further elaborated.
The Municipality of Rotterdam, Cambridge Innovation Centre (CIC) Rotterdam and
Deloitte have been working together since the beginning of 2017 to develop the first
Blockchain application in real estate for the purpose of documenting rental contracts. As a
result, start-ups can, for example, close rental contracts faster and easier. By documenting
these rental contracts from the CIC network on the Blockchain, we can work more efficiently
and management happens in a transparent manner. The next step in this project is to
monitor rent payments. The project also includes the development and execution of pilots as
part of the Roadmap Next Economy – a roadmap for the coming 10 to 20 years, with
scenarios and trade perspectives – for 23 municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of
Rotterdam-The Hague. The Roadmap aims to determine the impact of potentially disruptive
technology like Blockchain by experimenting with it in the early stages. Within the project,
five important steps have been taken:
(1) Digitalizing building data: This includes creating a Blockchain ledger with real
estate information for any building that is can be converted and registered on
Blockchain.
(2) Digitalizing the ownership situation: This includes linking the registration to the
owner. The Cadastre and the Kamer van Koophandel are now playing a further
role in this.
(3) Transferring ownership: The holder of registration is the sole entitled party who
can encumber the registration with obligations such as a rental contract.
(4) Closing of rental contracts: Multiple parties can work on signing the rental contract
in the registration.
(5) Unlocking contract information for third parties: During the life cycle, the property
owner will share information with third parties, such as for (re)financing. With
such changes, checks are performed on currency and completeness.
Two important reactions emerged during the presentation of the research results on 18 May
2017. Firstly, during the explanation of the developed platform, the responses were gauged
among the attendees; 60 per cent of them want to apply or are already applying Blockchain,
and 98 per cent are convinced that Blockchain will affect the real estate market. Only 4 per
cent think there is too much transparency due to Blockchain. These results show confidence
in Blockchain and that parties in the real estate sector want to get started. And secondly, the
human factor is seen as the biggest obstacle to the actual application of the Blockchain.

Blockchain is a disruptive innovation, potentially changing the current roles and tasks of
players within the real estate market. In this sense, it is about more than just a technological
innovation. Organizational change and adaptation of processes, work and methods, as a
result of the technological capabilities that Blockchain will offer, is expected to be a
challenge.
Blockchain and the impact on the value chain of real estate
The value chain consists of the ownership of real estate and the cash flows around it for
trading. In this value chain, the Cadastre, the notary, the owner and the banks play a role.
Blockchain technology can play a role in efficiency in the chain. Whether, for example, the
notary or the cadastre will maintain their role in the value chain is the question. As
disappointing as it was for Kodak, the company was unable to take the step from analogue
to digital photography, even the company itself had developed the technology. The real
revolution in photography was outside Kodak because we started taking more pictures and
sharing them with each other faster. This resulted in a different value chain than that of
photo rolls, chemicals and photo paper.
The developments of Blockchain are comparable with the rise of the internet. Essentially,
it is a global exchange of information, and the element of value exchange is now added by
Blockchain. The unique thing about Bitcoin is it counteracts spending money twice. But the
true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate processes still needs to be
investigated. Many stakeholders see the developments, as well as developments around
PropTech but still have to find their own role. It is therefore mainly about cooperation in the
value chain. For this, we look at applications of PropTech, Blockchain and data ethics in the
real estate sector and the changes in it.
PropTech, blockchain and data ethics
Before we continue with Blockchain, it is also important to look further into technology in
user’s buildings. PropTech is a merger of Property and new Technology and refers to
technology such as the allocation of parking and workplaces to users and apps that allow a
workplace to be customized to personal preferences. Users often expect higher service levels,
like people expect in other sectors such as banks, health care, education and so forth. An
example of a high level of real estate services is zuidasoffices.amsterdam, which offers many
facilities: hotels, restaurants, tailors, train times and a selection of offices. PropTech offers
advantages for increasing user satisfaction, health and performance. New technologies such
as Virtual and Mixed Reality (VR/MR), artificial intelligence, the use of IT technology in
industrial systems and PropTech (RICS, 2017) are changing how we use, understand and
interact with real estate. Digital transformation has an impact on the use of real estate,
which should therefore be in part determinative of strategy for future-proofing and thus
determines the viability of real estate. How can Blockchain support this?
Characteristic of Blockchain is, like money, it can be spent once. A Blockchain
transaction cannot be copied and is a parallel can thus be drawn to the real estate sector. The
possibilities are in the value chain of real estate: ownership, possession, characteristics and
transaction, the transfer of ownership and possession, with elements of transparency of
money streams in the financial market around that. This is currently not (yet) elaborated.
Blockchain technology can add value for the cadastre, notary or broker. A few but not an
exhaustive list of examples of possible concrete applications are for example (DTZ, 2017):
� There have been laws and regulations for Alternative Investments Fund Managers
Directive for real estate fund managers for a number of years. An important issue is
F

safeguarding assets, i.e. determination of ownership. This problem is more
effectively eliminated with Blockchain.
� Brokers can use Blockchain technology to register ownership of objects and in case
of change through sales or rental, all relevant data can be easily checked.
� The use of Blockchain also makes it possible to document building characteristics,
such as building drawings, BIM applications, maintenance history, ownership
history and all other official documentation for a building that comes from different
parties. This means that when transferring a building, all that documentation is
automatically presented and transferred.
The artificial intelligence through algorithmizing of the Blockchain will increasingly play a
role in the taking of decisions by learning organizations. Harari (2017) states that the world
could be subject to dataism, a data belief that every human act is a matter of the right
algorithms and sufficient data processing capacity. Internationally, only limited research is
currently taking place on the influence of algorithms on society and, in particular, the
economy. A proposal under responsible data science in The Netherlands was rejected by the
NWO in 2016 (Stolze, 2017). Artificial intelligence and its influence on society is not new. It
originated in the 1930s with Alan Turing’s Turing Machine, with which he broke the
German Enigma Code and started the end of the Second World War. Science has been
looking for some time for a computer that can withstand the Turning test. Another example
of the great influence of algorithms is, for example, the Coin algorithm developed by JP
Morgan. This is a software program that can read through thousands of contracts in a short
period of time and provide an opinion instead of 300,000 hours by ordinary lawyers (Stolze,
2017). It is good to realize that (thinking) processes and decisions are being outsourced by
algorithms. This artificial intelligence cannot use a combination of hard and soft factors to
make considerations. The question is whether we will use the big-data models correctly and
not inadvertently bring about inequality, discrimination and reduced vigilance. That
technology is developing faster than the adaptability of people is also not new: the parachute
was invented only after the first plane flew. Ethics for individuals and organizations
remains important for judging and deploying data well (RICS, 2007a, 2007b) because we are
producing an extreme amount of data that is not only increasingly difficult to secure but
also more difficult to organize, archive and keep accessible. But what are the changes in the
real estate sector at the moment?
Changes in the real estate sector
Looking at the activities in the Dutch real estate investment market, a quantitative analysis by
the NVM (2017a, NVM 2017b) concludes that approximately e11bn were invested in real estate
in The Netherlands past year, of which approximately e8bn was in offices, commercial
buildings, shops and hotels. This investment market is driven mainly by the ample availability
of capital, interest rates, economic recovery and more leases. For foreign investors, the
attractive initial yield was above all a decisive driving force. The NVM further sees:
� that internationalization continues;
� that there is an increased interest in offices;
� that commercial spaces are popular;
� that hotels in Amsterdam are popular;
� that there is less interest in retail investments; and
� that there is great demand rental housing.

The real estate market in general is therefore constantly moving, but how can the real estate
sector anticipate Blockchain? According to the Real Estate Report 2016 from the FGH Bank
NV (2016), despite the recovery of economic growth and the greater investment willingness
in The Netherlands, there still remains vacancy of about 40 million m2 for which there is not
yet a solution. This applies not only to offices and shops but also to care homes,
neighbourhood centres, churches, schools, showrooms, agricultural buildings and
commercial buildings. This vacancy has arisen because we need less space to deliver the
same economic performance. In addition to the excessive construction production, the
overcapacity according to FGH is mainly due to the fact that the real estate sector has not
adequately adapted to the changing environment. There are a number of changes in society
and the economy that greatly affect the real estate sector:
� The number of workers and consumers does not grow automatically.
� Existing Dutch sectors are changing under the influence of digitalization,
automation and robotization. The (professional) population increasingly consists of
“digital natives”.
� The space usage per person is decreasing: the use of facilities is becoming more
important than their ownership.
� Increasing internationalization of Dutch real estate users and investors.
Global developments affect the Dutch economy. Think of tensions on the world stage with
wars and migrants, macroeconomic developments such as changing world trade, slowdown
in growth in countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa and users
who want flexibility in products and services. The latter demands options and customized
spaces in the real estate sector. The real estate sector is also a safe haven for investors. To
keep it that way, according to the FGH, the investment and user market should also be
balanced in the long term. This can be achieved by being conservative about adding
unnecessary real estate meters to prevent capital destruction.
The Dutch economy is strong but vulnerable. Our strength is in exporting products and
services abroad, especially food and agricultural products. This is due to our high labour
productivity, digital infrastructure and the use of smart applications. However, aging will
decrease the number of workers. Therefore, we need to compensate with higher labour
productivity to stay competitive. This requires innovation. A strong competitive position is
an important pillar under the basic potential of Dutch real estate.
How do we want to house ourselves, live and work in the future?
Young generations organize their lives and work in a new way. This has consequences for
the demand for space and how it is used. New generations are looking for “smart solutions”
for all the issues in our society. Think of The Edge in Amsterdam, the icon of automation, or
Patch 22 in Amsterdam, a smart wooden design for flexible use. The quality of the digital
infrastructure and high-quality products offer more flexibility and quality for the user.
Chains are more efficient and integrated and this means less time, less space, so less cost.
The real estate sector therefore does not benefit from additional meters but in strengthening
existing locations through new construction or redevelopment, especially at the strong
locations. It is not so much about the building (supply) but respond to the demand with total
housing solutions. Consider the real estate as a flexible total service with, for example,
flexible contracts.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the scenarios indicate a slight (2 per cent) to stronger (13 per cent) increase in
demand for rental housing in 2025 compared to 2016. There will be a sustained demand for
housing because housing occupancy continues to decline, starters look later for a home to
purchase and a larger part of the population is looking for flexibility and temporary housing
solutions. Think of (temporary) second homes like expat houses or pied-à-terres. Only in
Scenario 2 is there a (slight) increase in demand for shops (2 per cent) and offices (7 per cent)
in 2025 compared to 2016. This demand for space would arise as a result of productivity
growth. All the other scenarios assume a decline in demand for shops and offices in 2025
compared to 2016, ranging from a decrease of 28 to 13 per cent. The demand for commercial
space decreases slightly in Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 by 1 to 6 per cent. The only increase in
demand can be expected in Scenario 4 with 2 per cent.
In short, according to the Real Estate Report 2016 (FGH), there is a high probability that
the vacancy in the existing supply of offices, shops, commercial spaces and social real estate
will be permanent. It is therefore about real estate entrepreneurship. National control over
the total vacancy is desirable. Long-term trends and developments per real estate sector are
for:
(1) Offices market: In the long term, there is supply reduction and greening of the
(existing) supply needed to improve the value perspective. The demand for offices
will go up, the supply will go down due to withdrawal from the market and more
office investments (NVM, 2017b).
(2) Retail market: Total retail usage shrinks in the longer term (2025) by possibly 25
per cent. Retail locations with unique qualities and a high service area become
more attractive as an investment with good prospects (NVM, 2017c; Dymanis,
2016a).
(3) Commercial space market: An increasing demand for commercial space in logistics
and modern production. Usage (and service life) of commercial space becomes
more flexible; the average service life decreases and thus the payback time
(Dymanis, 2016a, 2016b).
(4) Rental housing market: The value perspective of rental housing is favourable in the
short and medium term because of more demand than supply with prospects for
the middle segment (PBC, 2017). There is no bubble in the housing market in the
big cities at this time. Due to the overheating in the big cities, families mainly
relocate to neighbouring municipalities looking for affordable homes. The housing
market then accelerates there. People in the rest of the country move away. The
housing market there remains in a slump (De Nederlandse Bank, 2017).
(5) Investment real estate market: Differences between initial returns for good-quality
property and other real estate continue to increase. Expectations are that the
investment market will now be more successful and will remain dynamic (NVM,
2017d).
(6) Real estate financing market: Banks are increasingly the financial director between
real estate investors and investors. There seems to be momentum for further
expansion of the real estate financing portfolio (Syntrus Achmea, 2017).
(7) Logistics real estate market: The research of Savills (van Oers et al., 2017) gives
three key trends that will be determinative in 2017 for the logistics real estate
market:
Trust in a
viable real
estate
economy
115
� The extent of new logistics developments continues to increase. Ten years ago,
an average new development was 16,900 m2; now it is over 28,850 m2. The
demand for new distribution centres is not yet declining, and Savills also
expects more of such XL developments in 2017.
� The growth of e-commerce. Online spending grew by 18.7 per cent in 2016
compared with the previous year. To be able to further facilitate this growth,
the supply chain must be modernized and optimized.
� Political and economic uncertainty.
(8) Social real estate market: The Barometer for Social Real Estate 2017 (Veuger, 2017)
gives clear insights into future issues regarding social property.
Real estate and Blockchain internationally: first pilots and in silence
The Cadastre is currently exploring internationally the possibilities of Blockchain, where
various movements can be observed. Some countries such as Georgia and Sweden are
actually testing with Blockchain. Estonia and Dubai are also running pilots but doing so in
silence. Countries like Ghana, GA (USA) and Brazil have different ideas but have not (yet)
worked these out (Vos et al., 2017). The Bitfury Group is currently working on a number of
studies in Georgia (USA). The government in Honduras has started a project to register land
that has not yet led to results and publications and recently stopped (Drukker, 2016). Within
the Cadastre, an international expert team is working on further exploration. In conclusion,
Vos et al. (2017) states that Blockchain is not yet proven in practice internationally and that
completeness and transparency are the conditions for being able to make Blockchain a
success.
In Sweden (Salmeling and Fransson, 2017), a test environment has been built as part of
The Land Registry project in the Blockchain to understand Blockchain’s technology,
processes and security issues that need to be considered and given legal form. The
Blockchain tested here for real estate is implemented by a group of public and private
entities. In this test environment, it has been found that six features are important for a
safe process (Salmeling and Fransson, 2017, pp. 4-5). The next steps they will take concern
the technical environment, technology and process integration, more partners and projects,
legal conditions and lobbying, ownership and control. The value of possible Blockchain
solutions for real estate lie mainly in a more effective and more efficient method of
transactions, a better foundation for better investment and new development for the
mortgage market. All this will then grow into more trust in fundamental parts of an
economy: land and real estate.
Real estate and Blockchain nationally: digital solutions
On the national level, there are a number of Blockchain pilots with real estate:
� open data from the Cadastre;
� government-wide pilot on the possibilities for processes; and
� a pilot by the Living Environment and Transportation Inspectorate (ILT).
For the government-wide pilots, primarily the processes of real estate, aviation and ships are
being investigated, in which the process of registration of ships in the Blockchain is now
being investigated (Vos et al., 2017).

In The Netherlands, Blandlord crowd ownership has been introduced and is utilizing
Blockchain. The ownership of the real estate is then divided between a number of owners
and fits into the philosophy of a sharing economy: a group of equals collectively takes
responsibility for the property without debt or mortgages. No public information is available
yet about the results to date.
Deloitte (2017a, 2017b, 2017c, 2017d) explored eight trends that will have a major impact
on the real estate industry. In random order:
(1) Cyber risk: Smart buildings are increasingly an important competitive advantage
and can even generate new revenue. However, the emergence of these ‘smart
buildings’ also brings along points of attention, including cyber risks.
(2) Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing is on the rise. More and more companies are seeing
opportunities in utilizing the knowledge, expertise or creativity of a large group of
people online. This method allows for a more flexible workforce and, consequently,
a flexible shell of office space.
(3) Smart mobility: When travellers can use their travel time fully productively, for
example with self-driving cars, what will this mean for housing prices, for
example? This is now often based on location, but what if location does not matter?
(4) Future of work: The changing jobs are not only coming from organizations;
employees also have different expectations of their employer.
(5) Blockchain 2.0: Blockchain offers enormous opportunities, and the real estate
industry is increasingly experimenting with this distributed trust.
(6) Standardization: We expect more collaboration in the future on sharing and
exchanging data. These data partnerships offer a lot of added value.
(7) Ports: Three major topics will (have to) receive a lot of attention from the maritime
sector in the coming period: smart ports, increasing cooperation between seaports,
new niches (at the expense of fossil fuels).
(8) Smart cities: Increasingly, digital technologies will be used to solve urban challenges.
Conclusion: trust in a viable real estate economy
The way in which disruption, Blockchain and real estate will develop in the coming years
are not the only obvious characteristics of a particular era, but also its social impact and user
behaviour. This also applies to how this real estate transition can best be tracked, guided
and utilized in society at the international, national and regional level. Disruptive
organizations clearly respond to the viability of the (built) environment and therefore
determine competitive strength. This affects the current and future valuation of real estate.
The value of the possible applications of Blockchain in real estate processes is reflected in
more effective and efficient transactions, increasing transparency, a better foundation for
investment and new development for the mortgage market. All of this will then grow into
more trust in fundamental elements of an economy: land and real estate and from the
“internet of things” to an “economy of things”.
Looking at the impact of Blockchain on real estate, we can draw a number of conclusions.
First of all, the relationship between Blockchain and real estate has not yet been proven in
practice. It is expected to develop further in the form of registering transaction processes
and the DNA passport of a real estate object. Secondly, completeness and transparency are
the basic ingredients for trust in the system. Third, real estate wants to remain viable. For
this reason, taking the offense is necessary for real estate and management to connect with

social demand. Behaviour also leads to new earnings models of the social and economic
spin-off of disruptive real estate. If the Dutch real estate sector embraces Blockchain and is
able to realize innovations, then there are opportunities for real estate entrepreneurs to
exploit the disruptive character to provide those new services.
Artificial intelligence through algorithmizing of Blockchain will increasingly play a role in
the taking of decisions by learning organizations. It is good to realize that (thinking) processes
and decisions are being outsourced by algorithms. This artificial intelligence cannot combine
hard and soft factors to make considerations. The question is whether we will use the big-data
models correctly and not inadvertently bring about inequality, discrimination and less
vigilance. That technology develops faster than the adaptability of people is also not new: the
parachute was invented only after the first plane flew. Ethics for individuals and organizations
remain important for judging and utilizing data.
Changes in value concepts affect the valuation of real estate and the thinking about it. The
orientation of changing users and owners of real estate affects innovativeness, values and
flexibility in managing that property. Orientation on disruption must be seen as proof that the
real estate world is able to actually innovate the accumulated assets and consolidate this. The
financial and real estate markets are markets that exaggerate through irrational behaviour.
Fear of “eat or be eaten” determines people’s behaviour. Financial and thus real estate markets
are always unstable andmust always be regulated by people and organizations.
The question that remains is whether it is important to look at disruptive innovations in
existing markets or newcomers in the real estate market and Blockchain. The question is
whether Blockchain is only a technological disruption, or a real game changer, and whether the
entire value chain of the real estate market will embrace it. No two disruptions are the same.
Trust in Blockchain is a prerequisite for guiding the predictable form of that disruption where
start-up companies use new technology to offer cheaper and inferior alternatives to real estate
in themarket. You could also talk about anti-fragile value:
Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness,
disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the
phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile (Taleb, 2012).
In other words: attention to disruption and Blockchain creates a viable real estate economy.
The true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate still needs to be
investigated. The author still curious to understand and clarify the value of Blockchain for
real estate processes. Doubt continues to exist and is therefore a feeding ground for further
research, because we do not knowwhat we have not seen.
