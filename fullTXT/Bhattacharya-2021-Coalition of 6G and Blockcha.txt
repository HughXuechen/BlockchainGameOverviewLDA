ABSTRACT The digital content wave has proliferated the financial and industrial sectors. Moreover,
with the rise of massive internet-of-things, and automation, technologies like augmented reality (AR) and
virtual reality (VR) have emerged as prominent players to drive a range of applications. Currently, sixth-
generation (6G) networks support enhanced holographic projection through terahertz (THz) bandwidths,
ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity. However, the data is exchanged between autonomous
networks over untrusted channels. Thus, to ensure data security, privacy, and trust among stakeholders,
blockchain (BC) opens new dimensions towards intelligent resource management, user access control,
audibility, and chronology in stored transactions. Thus, the BC and 6G coalition in futureAR/VR applications
is an emerging investigative topic. To date, authors have proposed surveys that study the integration of BC and
6G in AR/VR in isolation, and hence a coherent survey is required. Thus, to address the gap, the survey is the
first-of-its-kind to investigate and study the coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR space. Based on the proposed
research questions in the survey, a solution taxonomy is presented, and different verticals are studied in
detail. Furthermore, an integrative architecture is proposed, and open issues and challenges are presented.
Finally, a case study, BvTours, is presented that presents a unique survey on BC-based 6G-assisted AR/VR
virtual home tour service. The survey intends to propose future resilient frameworks and architectures for
different industry 4.0 verticals and would serve as starting directions for academia, industry stakeholders,
and research organizations to study the coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR in industrial applications, gaming,
digital content manufacturing, and digital assets protection in greater detail.

I. INTRODUCTION
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (AR) facilitates
vivid immersive and real experiences in a variety of appli-
cations. AR includes the virtuality of real objects; it is
combined with multi-sensory abilities such as audio, video,
cognitive, etc. It provides a real-time three-dimensional
(3D) presentation of virtual and real objects. On the other
hand, VR presents the imaginative feel and inclusion of
real-world objects. Thus, collectively AR and VR allow
a user to experience the coexistence of the real and vir-
tual worlds simultaneously. The technology has also gained

promising directions post the outbreak of novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic, as virtual presence, meetings, and
conferences have gained importance over physical meetings.
AR and VR applications are explored in a variety of
applications such as entertainment, advertising, intelligent
healthcare, virtual experiences market, real estate, art, the
gaming industry and monetization, manufacturing, social
media, education, interactive training, and others. To sup-
port the real-world experience, AR/VR requires real-time
connectivity, with massive bandwidth support to help the
data-driven connections. Due to this, fifth-generation (5G)
communication networks leverage super-fast connectiv-
ity and high bandwidth uplink and downlink data
streaming requirements to support AR/VR applications.

TABLE 1. Abbreviations and their meanings.
Network orchestration requires reliability and quality-of-
service (QoS) based service sets. In networks, QoS is defined
as network delay, jitter, audio/video drop ratio, and band-
width. To enhance user experience and interactivity with
multi-applications, quality-of-experience (QoE) is defined
in terms of the degree to which any application or service
provides flexibility, ease of interactivity, and overall annoy-
ance or delight to the user [1]. However, improved QoE,
with real-time interactions of real objects in virtual space
through assisted networking, is further defined as quality-of-
interaction (QoI). In AR and VR applications, effective QoE
represents a satisfactory QoI for end-users. Thus, responsive
network design leverages an improved QoI that represents
a high QoE for user-centric applications. A perfect QoE
establishment requires the applicability of all key perfor-
mance indicators (KPI) in a particular communication net-
work. Thus, network management and orchestration through
5G serviced networks is a promising fit to support the band-
width and end-user latency requirements of AR/VR space.
Table 1 presents the list of abbreviations and their associated
meanings.
In a similar direction, earlier 5G new radio (NR) tech-
nology enables ultra-reliable low latency communications
(uRLLC), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive
machine-type communications (mMTC). 5G allows latency
of < 10ms, failure rates as low as 10-7, high reliability of the
order of 99.9999% through 5G-tactile internet (TI) service,
and peak data rates up to 10 Gb/s to support QoS require-
ments for uRLLC [2]. 5G enables increased integration of
cellular and assisted wireless fidelity (WiFi) technologies
and standards, network decentralization through edge-centric
architectures, mobile edge computing assisted radio access
networks, device-to-device (D2D) communications, and user
equipment (UE) assisted mobility [3]. 5G networks reduce
network scale-up time to an immense extent due to software-
defined networking (SDN) leveraged network management,
virtualization of cores, and assisted user plane management
that reduces the overall network and communication costs.
Moreover, 5G leverages massive multiple input multiple out-
put (mMIMO) channels, which increases network capability
and reliability. 5G uses convoluted and sophisticated antenna
configurations, and the physical layer communication com-
plexity is addressed through optimization and monitoring
through artificial intelligence (AI)-based configurations [4].
Through AI, 5G networks can support massive communica-
tions and enhanced services that drive a range of verticals in
healthcare, internet-of-things, telepresence, and many more.
Moreover, 5G can be easily integrated with legacy fourth gen-
eration (4G) assisted long-term evolution (LTE), and long-
term evolution-enhanced (LTE-A) networks [5].
FIGURE 1 presents the timeline of important events
related to the early stages of AR/VR, like key breakthroughs
like AR toolkits in the early 2000s, 3D stereoscopic view
in 2000-2010. The timeline also depicts the evolution of
wireless network generation, from first-generation (1G) ana-
log services in the 1980-the 1990s towards 6G deployments
by 2030. Similarly, the timelines show the evolution of BC
from Bitcoin cryptocurrency to a decentralized internet and
governance.
Historically, AR/VR applications started as early as flight
simulator engines, telesphere masks, and head-mounted dis-
plays. In 1977, Sayre Glove was designed by the University
of Illinois; in 1982, the technology advanced to form the
power and the data gloves. At the same time, the world
saw the emergence of first-generation (1G) analog mobile
phone services that supported bandwidth of 30 KHz, and
2.4 Kbps data rate. In 1992, the universal second genera-
tion (2G) global mobile communication (GSM) standards

supported digital voice, and different standards were pro-
posed. 2G further enhanced to support connectivity to the
internet via general packetized radio service (GPRS) and
enhanced data rates in the GSM environment (EDGE). Early
2000 marked the design of AR toolkits and open libraries
for implementation. At the same time, third-generation net-
works were proposed to support higher data rates around
30 Mbps. In 2008, Satoshi proposed bitcoin as a decentral-
ized ledger and marked the beginning of blockchain 1.0.
Later the technology matured in BC to ensure trust among
decentralized users. Later, with an increase in decentralized
applications, ethereum was introduced, and smart contracts
emerged. The same is termed Blockchain 2.0. At the same
time, the AR industry entered into automation and print
media. With the rise of decentralization, Blockchain 3.0
emerged with the design of decentralized applications,
and adoption of BC to different verticals started like
healthcare, finance, and education sector. Fourth gen-
eration (4G) networks evolved as a prelude to fifth-
generation (5G), and AR/VR saw the shift towards user data
privacy.
At current, we stand at AR holography and shift towards
the support of massive IoT. BC has matured as a technology,
and solutions are proposed in smart farming, IoT, drones,
and others. As artificial intelligence (AI) also progressed,
5G networks proposed intelligent radio access networks
and proposed specific services with defined functional-
ity. The multiplexing models shifted from orthogonal to
non-orthogonal multiplexing models with the support of high
data rates. We envision the integration of secured exchange
among communication networks and real-time AR/VR inte-
gration in the future. With 6G networks, services are modeled

as orchestrated as encapsulated boxes, and AI would drive the
behavior of 6G networks and services.
However, emerging applications such as telemedical pres-
ence, mixed reality (MR), holographic communication,
real-time haptics, high mobility of vehicular networks,
autonomous car driving, massive unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (UAVs) surveillance are readily deployed in smart city,
industry, and healthcare verticals, and involves rich virtual-
experience, that involves increased adoption of AR/VR
technology. The supportive networks require massive
data ingestion rates, ultra-high dense connectivity at
low-transmitted antenna power, extremely high data rates,
enhanced precision, and ultra-high reliability to support the
mission-critical cyberspace applications. Some use-cases
involve self-driving cars with massive sensor connectiv-
ity [6], emergency medical facilities through delivery-based
UAVs [7], accident prevention in vehicular networks through
roadside infrastructure units, ultra-high dense IoT (uHDIoT)
in industry 4.0 and manufacturing verticals, low-powered
AI-assisted healthcare sensors that communicate with
edge-health and cloud servers [8], holographic data commu-
nication that supports remote surgery (telemedicine) [9], and
real-time immersive AR/VR experience in online gaming.
To support the stringent requirements of such applications,
extremely reliable network orchestration and management
are required to provision the QoE for users. The current
5G networks in the future would face bottlenecks to provide
real-time QoE in the use-case mentioned above scenarios.
Thus, researchers globally have proposed beyond 5G (B5G)
and emerging sixth-generation (6G) networks as a viable and
preferred choice to address the network capacity and high
volume of data traffic.
6G networks are human-centric, rather than device-centric,
and they holistically integrate users, processes, mobile
devices and network, service management to interconnect
and coordinate a plethora of applications. 6G technol-
ogy enables edge intelligence through AI machine learn-
ing and deep learning models that enable transformation
and connectedness for humans and machine-centric appli-
cations. In AR/VR, 6G supports haptic sensory and neu-
ral communications, with blended holographic support [10].
6G nodes support internet-of-everything (IoE) communica-
tions through virtualized services and network-in-box man-
agement that expands wireless-access interfaces to support
massive multiple access points to form a distributed, cell-
less MIMO system. 6G supports terahertz frequency bands,
1 Tbps user-experienced data rate, round-trip latency of
0.1 ms, and supports services like extremely reliable low
latency communications (eRLLC), with a reliability rate
of 99.9999999% compared to 5G and B5G networks [11].
6G services are backed up by federated learning, deep rein-
forcement learning, and photonic communication, reducing
communication latency and increasing user QoE. For AR/VR
users, high QoI is achieved by 6G networks through its asso-
ciated services. AR/VR devices are computationally intelli-
gent, and thus 6G leverages massive data-transfer rates to
support high 4K resolution multimedia, multi-dimensional
holograms, haptics with low latency and high precision that
drives applications like telesurgery, 3D-printing, responsive
digital twins in industry 4.0, immersed multi-player gaming,
and many more applications.
However, 6G communication networks interact with
AR/VR applications and heterogeneous sensors, where user
data is shared among multiple nodes. Due to open channels,
the collected user data from various sources suffer from
security and privacy risks in decentralized environments.
The collected information can be classified as Observed
(location data, motion tracking, and user-provided informa-
tion/generated data), Observable (like virtual person/object,
avatar, and real-time world/in-app), Computed (recommen-
dation/advertising, and biometric information), and Asso-
ciated (login/contacts/payment information, virtual assets,
and IP address). An adversary can form informed attacks
on decentralized AR/VR applications. The attack scenar-
ios include impersonation-based attacks, internet-protocol
version 6 (IPv6) based spoofing, session hijacking, anony-
mous linkage of session details that can be used to gain
access to private and sensitive information. An adversary
can use private information to sell, market, and spy through
third-party applications for personal benefits. Other associ-
ated risks are involved against immersive digital content like
consumer data protection, IP-assets, copyright infringement,
and many more. Due to this, different industry stakeholders
require a trust-based model and secured privacy agreements
among various heterogeneous AR/VR stakeholders. Thus,
blockchain (BC) ensures trust, transparency, and accountabil-
ity to avoid fraudulent and tampered entries in consumer-
oriented AR/VR applications.
BC technology is an immutable ledger that enables transac-
tions in a chronological and timestamped manner. The block
details are added through consensus mechanisms that are
transparent to all users in the network [12]. It eliminates
the requirement of third-party applications and thus supports
secure and trusted data exchange in AR/VR channels. Thus,
researchers have shifted towards BC-based AR/VR solutions
and commercialization and deployment of secured applica-
tions. Moreover, smart contracts (SC) can streamline digital
content laws and privacy guidelines of data sharing among
multiple AR/VR stakeholders in decentralized peer-to-peer
(P2P) ecosystems [13]. This increases the communication
effectiveness and ensures transparency among entire flow
cycles in a range of vertical applications, simplifying the
business logistics industry 4.0 and allied sectors.
In industry deployments, BC ensures trust among a closed
group of AR/VR stakeholders through a permissioned or
private network, where verification and ownership transfer
of digital assets is transparent [14]. SCs have programmed
logics developed for native decentralized applications,
or DApps, where contracts are executed among participating
entities only when specified criteria are met. In permissioned-
based BC, consensus mechanism like practical byzantine
fault tolerance is applicable for small networks but poses

limitations with an increasing number of nodes. For high
performance and scalability in permissioned BC networks,
PAXOS, and RAFT are considered a more viable choice
due to high network throughput and better scalability [15].
In major industrial AR/VR deployments, permissioned BC
networks are a preferred choice over public BC owing to
ease of node verification, consensus, and improved trans-
actional throughput [16]. Thus, integrating 6G and BC net-
works in AR/VR space can drive a secure and responsive
experience that satisfies high QoI for end-users. 6G services
support applications like edge computing, energy trading,
spectrum sharing, network virtualization, and many more.
Hence, 6G-envisioned BC-based AR/VR guarantees trust,
security, access control, authentication, distributed content
management, and improved auditing experience, with ultra-
low latency, high bandwidth, and extreme reliability [17].
Table 2 presents the description of BC-characteristics and the
associated potential benefits that BC leverages as a solution
to AR/VR ecosystems.
A. POTENTIAL OF BC AND 6G IN AR/VR SPACE
BC proves to have immense potential to secure AR/VR space.
Firstly, using BC decentralization, users can create their
full-fledged virtual world governed by a set of rules without
the intervention or risk from platform developers. Secondly,
BC allows copyright protection of the content as a user can
record contents in BC. Thirdly, BC can enhance the popu-
larity of VR by merging the latter with the cryptocurrency
market, which in turn leads to increased profitability. The
potential benefits of the 6G and BC coalition in AR/VR are
listed as follows.
1) 6G networks can support THz communication at sub-
millimetre bands, with extremely low latency. 6G sup-
ports virtualized service sets that support enhanced
management and simplify holographic communica-
tions over physical boundaries. This allows real-time
experienced reality (XR) for 3D imagery, driverless
cars, simplified digital-twin processed in industry 4.0,
and massive connectivity in Internet-of-Things (IoT)
networks.
2) To secure massive data-sharing among 6G communi-
cation channels, and leverage trust in AR/VR applica-
tions, BC ensures trusted decentralization among mul-
tiple nodes.
3) As AR/VR assets require fast image/video display and
processing, the data is stored and exchanged through a
local central server because of memory and processing
limitations. The utilization of BC can enhance sharing
and securing the exchanged data.
4) As AR/VR-oriented applications are data and
bandwidth-hungry, the central server may get over-
loaded due to multiple asynchronous communication
among AR/VR devices. BC can provide data decen-
tralization in such a situation.
5) BC can enhance improvement in cybersecurity through
sensitive data sharing, law enforcement, and public
safety for military and battlefield applications using
AR/VR devices. This significantly improves digital
data sharing and effective collaboration.
6) BC can help in the commercialization of AR devices
through the creation of a user-defined marketplace for
storing and uploading AR content in a decentralized
fashion. Moreover, the data can be stored and peered
using an interplanetary file system (IPFS), that allows
authorized stakeholders to access records with IPFS
key, and hashed IPFS references are stored as external
references in the BC ledger.
7) BC based decentralization can help users and devel-
opers to download and upload content, creating store-
fronts and marketplaces to enable commercializa-
tion of AR/VR devices for e.g. Decentraland [23],
VibeHub [24].
8) BC-based tokenization enhances financial transactions
where AR devices act as hardware and perform peer-
to-peer transactions on digital tokens [25].

B. SURVEY MOTIVATION
The motivation behind this paper is described as follows.
• Recently, AR and VR technologies have been
implemented in various sectors such as education,
medical treatment, construction, military affairs, enter-
tainment, and industrial research. As AR/VR deploy-
ments would drive the future industry verticals, BC can
assist in the security and uniqueness of assets to its
users. Furthermore, BC-based AR/VR is implemented
in cyber-physical ecosystems to support trusted ledgers
and automated SCs among AR/VR stakeholders.
• 6G networks improvise upon 5G networks via increased
reliability and high bandwidth channels. In the future,
6G is designed to support low-latency industrial IoT
(IIoT), deep-sea and sky networks, and massively con-
nected nodes for ubiquitous AR/VR experience.
• Thus, the integration of BC and 6G would address
secured protocols and assisted networked infrastruc-
tures, virtualization, privacy, and integrity of remote
computational AR/VR resources.
C. KEY TAKEAWAYS OF THE SURVEY
• The proposed survey presents the coalition of 6G net-
work services at the communication plane, with sup-
port of BC at the application plane to provide dense
real-time connectivity, high bandwidth, and secured
data transfer among AR/VR applications. Table 3
presents real-world industry projects that have deployed
BC-based AR/VR DApps, that are supported through
current LTE networks. However, with the advent
of 5G/6G network services, AR/VR applications are
expected to have high connectivity at extremely
low latency. The key takeaways of the survey are high-
lighted as follows.
• We present a proposed architecture that supports decen-
tralized system architecture that supports responsive
edge-service communication, smart parking, vehicular
networks, and industry 4.0 productions. The architecture
highlights the applicability of BC to enforce security
and privacy over 6G-assisted massive connected AR/VR
networks. Through 6G, QoI among AR/VR users is
enhanced, and BC maintains secured and chronological
transactional ledgers.
• Through a proposed review method and designed
research questions to be addressed by the survey,
a solution taxonomy of 6G-assisted BC-based AR/VR
is discussed in terms of security and communica-
tion perspective, and different use-cases of AR/VR are
discussed.
• Open issues and challenges of the possible integration of
6G and BC in AR/VR are discussed, and an interesting
use-caseBvTours is presented that presents a 6G-assisted
virtual home-tour service, that provides a 3D AR/VR
based real-estate industry view to prospective buyers,
presented by real estate agents. A flow scenario is dis-
cussed, and the performance analysis of the case study
is presented in terms of network-based parameters like
packet loss rate, packet miss probability, and BC-based
transactional throughput.
D. EXISTING SURVEYS
This subsection presents the discussion on the existing sur-
veys that have discussed in isolation the key principles of
integration of 5G/6G networks and BC as a potential solution

to address network latency, bandwidth, security, and trust
issues in AR/VR ecosystems. Table 4 shows the relative
comparison of the proposed survey with the existing state-
of-the-art surveys. Tahir et al. [34] presented an overview
BC-assisted solutions for B5G networks. Dai et al. [26] pre-
sented the survey on IIoT issues and presented key principles
of BC-based solutions to address trust and interoperability
issues among different stakeholders. Alrubei et al. [30] pre-
sented a brief review by analyzing several latency aspects and
also demonstrated the integration of BC and IoT.
Labazova et al. [27] developed a detailed taxonomy that
demonstrates areas of BC in six different applications based
on eight characteristics (reading access, writing access,
anonymity, level, main consensus mechanism, event han-
dling, data exchange type, encryption, and history retention).
The taxonomy presents twenty-five applications bifurcated
in twenty-one technical areas. Yang et al. [28] presented a
survey that integrates BC framework for future internet-based
services to aim security and development of decentral-
ized, trustworthy service. The authors also present a case
study for BC applicability in IoT-based neuro-informatics.
Fernández-Caramés and Fraga-Lamas [25] provides a
detailed guide for most relevant blockchain-based applica-
tions for Industry 4.0 technologies and enhance the next
generation of cyber-secure industrial applications like IIoT,
cyber-physical production system (CPPS), big data analytics,
industrial AR/VR, autonomous robots and vehicles, 3D print-
ing, and assisted cybersecurity. Hewa et al. [29] explained
BC-based interfaces and protocols in future 6G networks. The
authors depicted future applications and service opportunities
via BC in 6G systems.
Dabbagh et al. [31] presented a survey on empirical per-
formance evaluation of different permissioned BC platforms
on different frameworks (Libra, Ethereum, Parity, Geth,
Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric) and demonstrated the per-
formance of these frameworks according to ten different
selection parameters. The proposed framework also facili-
tates the identification of factors that impact performance on
the different platforms. Fan et al. [32] presented a system-
atic survey that covered BC-based performance evaluation
in terms of empirical and analytical parameters. The authors
derived that performance monitoring is the best empirical

analysis for public BC and analytical modeling is suitable for
selecting BC. Liao et al. [33] introduced new technologies
for AR/VR applications viz. BC for information-centric mas-
sive IoT devices (IC-mIoT) and Proof-of-Cache-Offloading
(PoCO) consensus mechanism. The analysis proved the effi-
cacy of the proposed scheme.
Till date, existing surveys have highlighted the key tech-
nologies, protocols, and implementations related to 6G com-
munication in massive IoT (mIoT), IIoT, healthcare, AR/VR,
and other verticals. The surveys have also focused on
integrating secured data sharing and provenance through
BC (security perspective) or network-based orchestration
through 5G/6G networks (network-based perspective). How-
ever, a unified vision that holistically presents the integration
of 6G and BC in AR/VR is not presented. Thus, a protocol
reference architecture is required to address the end-to-end
solution through communication and security-based layered
stack architecture. Thus, the presented survey addresses the
gap in earlier surveys through a proposed integration of 6G
and BC in AR/VR ecosystems to cater to massive IC-mIoT,
industry 4.0, finance, and healthcare application and render
real-time analytics, responsive communication, and massive
connectivity bandwidth through a secure and private network
in open channels.

ence layered architecture, and a possible discussion of an
integrative solution taxonomy supported and validated
through a designed case study.

cations. Section VII presents a proposed case study, BvTours,

gence of 6G and BC, potential benefits of BC and 6G in
AR/VR space, and recent industry use-cases. The section
intends to provide the readers with the motivation of the
potential of BC and 6G in AR/VR and highlights the
contributions of the article.
II. BACKGROUND
The section is divided into four subsections. The first two
subsections discuss AR and VR basics. The third subsection
discusses features of 6G and its potential vision to support
AR andVR applications. Finally, the fourth subsection delves
into the integration of BC into AR and VR applications.
The focus of the background section is to present useful
insights to the readers about the key technical drivers like AR,
VR, 6G, and BC to address the security and communication
perspectives. The section thus addresses research questions
RQ 2 and RQ 3, which are put forward in the review method
section. RQ 2 is addressed through a coherent discussion on
the integration between AR, VR, and MR technologies and
their applicability in concerned user applications. RQ 3 is
addressed through effective discussions on the integration of
AR/VR with 6G communication networks.
A. AUGMENTED REALITY
AR can be thought to be a middle-ground between the VR
and the real-world space. AR can be explained through the
reality-virtuality continuum (RVC). FIGURE 3 depicts the
continuum timeline. RVC presents the transition of reality to
virtual space. As presented in FIGURE 3, at different points
in RVC, the different degrees of interactionwithAR/VR users

changes. At the extreme left point in the RVC, we have real
reality (RR), which represents the actual real world and its
associated objects. This is the world that we humans know
and interact. At the extreme right end of the RVC,we haveVR
applications that create a perfect simulation environment of
the RR space. The VR space enables users to interact through
perceptual and sensory elements with the objects in the RR
space. At the middle points, we have AR and augmented
virtuality (AV) space between RR and VR. AR superimposes
and emulates multimedia elements like images, videos, audio
as perceptual elements for AR users to interact with RR.
Still, there is a distinct separation of VR and RR space.
Thus, an observer in AR can experience both RR and VR in
real-time but cannot interact with bothworlds simultaneously.
AV superimposes RR on VR, but current deployments are not
matured enough to address the superimposition in a complete
sense. Thus, we have a middle-ground between AR and AV,
denoted as MR, that presents a near-close enough experience
of AV. Through MR, both virtuality and actuality can closely
interact in real-time, enabling MR users to interact with
both virtual and physical environments and objects through
high-level imaging and sensing technologies. Thus, MR can
potentially digitally transform the entire RR workspace and
apply digital user content to theMR space. This enhances user
QoE, with enhanced capacity to apply digital information
directly to a worker’s real-life experience. Thus, MR appli-
cations have been an emerging trend in diverse application
sets for business logistics. Extended reality (XR) covers the
entire umbrella of the MVC and allows the superimposition
of different applications {A1,A2, . . . ,An} to interact, play,
and share content. The input depends on application require-
ments, and the preferred output is the user requirements,
which enhances the QoI at the user end.
In practicality, AR and VR are developed before MR
developments. The potential applications of the AR/VR space
are the entertainment, print media, and gaming industries.
The potential industries have driven a range of business,
educational, and informational users and have allowed map-
ping of a virtual object in a real space [35]. In present-day
mobile applications, key elements of AR are increasingly
used to improve the user experience of interaction with appli-
cations. AR also helps in the improvisation of knowledge
dissemination, mainly through interactive educational apps
and healthcare apps. Broadly, AR is classified into four types,
namely, Marker Based (Image Recognition), Marker Less
(Location-Based), Projection Based, and Superimposition
Based. Aggarwal and Singhal [36] presents AR as an interest-
ing use case of intelligence amplification (IA), which allows
the usage of computers as a tool to make interactive and
intelligent human experience to perform day-to-day practical
tasks.
B. VIRTUAL REALITY
VR presents the virtual experience of the real world, which
presents the dynamic views of the RR in terms of created
virtual objects. VR is highly dependent on four technologies:
visual displays, graphics, tracking systems, and database con-
struction and maintenance. For an effective VR experience,
rendering engines play an important factor in managing the
moving and tracking speed by measuring device processing
latency. VR finds interesting use-cases to support differ-
ent application areas like vehicle simulation, entertainment,
vehicle design, architecture design, microscopy, and many
more. VR has improved the user experience and real-time
control; however, VR expansion in industrial deployments
is challenged due to high-end communication latency, mass
rendering of large simulated models, and effective scalability
of VR objects in real-world space [37]. VR presents the
virtual superimposition of real-world objects of RR, and
enhances the immersive content to support key technolo-
gies like IoT, enhanced 3D-modelling, virtual education, and
many more [38].
However, VR is challenged by interfacing the real
objects at present acceptable scenes with ultra-low latency.
Thus, VR requires effective network management to ensure
high-quality video content streaming, perceptual move-
ments, and multi-mode interfaces. In gaming, VR requires
3D-joysticks to support the integrated natural language pro-
cessing libraries and hand-gesture movements. As speech
and motion are primary interfaces, there have to be real-time
movements to ensure avatars’ smooth and streamlinedmotion
in the VR world. Moreover, it requires heavy rendering and
graphic engines to support the environmental conditions, such
as sounds, removal of second-order noise, echo-cancellations,
to add a personalized user experience. To cite an exam-
ple, VR can support the environmental conditions that are
exactly similar to a hot summer environment in a desert land
VOLUME 9, 2021 168463
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
and the feel of a sea breeze. To ensure effective rendering,
AI-supported engines can drastically learn from the local
environment, set-up patterns, and responsive agent functions
that provide the real experience of RR in the virtual world.
To ensure user data privacy, cryptographic primitives are used
for the encryption of data. With the emergence of quantum
computers, privacy through quantum-key distribution is used
to ensure the perfect secrecy of the user. Quantum com-
puters work on associated qbits that can exist in multiple
non-deterministic states to support parallelism in tasks. This
reduces the overall computational complexity of hardware
engines and mitigates the security vulnerabilities [39].
C. 6G-ENVISIONED AR/VR
6G communication is envisioned to support dense-network
connectivity, massive coverage, low-powered nodes, and
effective AI-capability that supports mIoT. 6G is capa-
ble of supporting < 106 parallel sensor connections per
sq. km range. 6G allows computational intelligence to
enhance AR/VR perception models at extremely high reli-
ability and coverage range. 6G is envisioned to support smart
city verticals like vehicular-to-anything networks, internet-
of-bio-sensory things, supermassive edge computing,
AR/VR use-cases (for example, remote surgery, holographic
mind-mapping, immersive gaming experience, haptic com-
munication through sub-millisecond (< 1 ms TI service),
optical radio access cores with photonic communication for
super-dense visible light communication [40]. 6G support
virtualization through SDN and does not require manual
orchestration of nodes. Thus, it addresses the limitations
of 4G-LTE and 5G-RAN cores in manual optimization and
task configurations. 6G networks operate services in virtual-
ized containers to provision resource requirements to nodes.
6G-based TI service enables haptic human-to-machine inter-
actions and is predicted to drive industry 4.0 to encompass
an entire cyber-virtual space, where physical objects and
processes would be in close interaction with humans, sensors,
through touch and perception. The generated digital content
would be transferred through intelligent physical and MAC
layers through edge nodes. It would support diverse applica-
tions at the user level with a real-time AR/VR experience.
In summary, 6G is envisioned to provide the following
services to industry 4.0 and telemedicine.
• 6G-TI services would strengthen the entire IIoT control
systems to replace the legacy industrial ethernet com-
munication with a new diverse set of 6G-enabled IIoT
protocols. The latter would offer responsive automation
of physical processes.
• 6G would kick-off IIoE revolution, led by immersive
XR, digital twin processes when coupled with holo-
graphic communication, complex machine learning, and
deep learning models that would train sensors, robots
to perform day-to-day tasks. Furthermore, due to intelli-
gent AI-based learning techniques, the massive training
data would be densely interconnected to support extreme
low-level device offloading latency.
• In healthcare 4.0 ecosystems, 6G would revolutionize
telemedicine/healthcare through interactive and haptic
AR service. For example, robots would communicate
with remote doctors to operate telesurgical operations,
which would be supported through responsive 6G-based
tactile internet services. In addition, VR service would
allow doctors to feed and precisely examine, enlarge,
and view 3D models of body parts through 6G-based
remote networks. This would enable doctors to practice
medical procedures without requiring physical presence
at the hospitals and carry out complex surgery proce-
dures through surgical robots.
D. CRYPTOCURRENCY AND BC-ASSISTED AR AND VR
Cryptocurrency gained prominence through Satoshi
Nakamoto bitcoin ledgers and has transitioned today as digi-
tal asset forms that are shared and distributed across multiple
P2P nodes. It laid the starting foundation of blockchain 1.0,
through which digital transactions are performed without the
requirements of a third-party financial intermediary [41].
Cryptocurrency-based transactions are immutable ledgers,
where a virtual amount is deducted through the sender’s
financial wallet and credited to the receiver’s wallet. Once the
transaction is completed, the record is added to a particular
block, which is mined after sufficient transactions are added
to the block. Once the block is mined, the transaction ledger
state is reflected across all nodes in the P2P network. A recent
Markets & Markets report indicates that the cryptocurrency
market in 2010 is approximately $3 billion, and it is expected
to rise to $39.7 by 2025, at a CAGR of 67.3% [42]. The
adoption of cryptocurrency has also increased, seen in market
capitalization, users, and transaction volume. The cryptocur-
rencies operating in decentralized nature also put trust into
users [43].
Blockchain 2.0 introduced Ethereum chains and presented
the design interface for the realization of SCs. As finan-
cial markets evolved, BC gained prominence into a range
of vertical applications, and the need and requirement of
decentralized applications, or DApps, came into view. This
led to the inception of blockchain 3.0, or the design of
DApps, to support BC-based applications other than finance.
Some notable applications include healthcare records storage,
secured asset transfers, loan and credit operations [44], and
many more. Some of the notable cryptocurrencies include
bitcoin, ethereum, peercoin, dogecoin, auroracoin, and
permacoin [45].
BC, on the other hand, differs from basic cryptocurrency
primitives and is defined as a distributed, timestamped, and
chronological ledger, where appended transactions cannot be
modified. In case of modification, the block hash changes,
and thus it invalidates the entire chain. In the case of bit-
coin cryptocurrency, the block size is 1 MB. A block con-
sists of the block header and the body. The block body
consists of the list of added transactions to the block. The
block header contains the current block hash, the previ-
ous block hash, block timestamp, nonce, and the Merkle

hash value. BC has evolved to support trusted transaction
exchange among many finances, education, edge networks,
AR/VR, and many more applications. The issues and chal-
lenges faced by AR and VR in different industry verticals
are discussed in the article. We present the emergence of
decentralized and trusted AR/VR through BC that ensures
immutable, timestamped, and chronological ledgers. For per-
sistent connectivity, we propose the benefits of 6G networks
as key drivers in AR/VR [46].
This section details the background of AR, VR.
We subsequently envisioned the importance of 6G and
BC. After reading this section, the readers can under-
stand AR, VR concepts for visualization of their require-
ments in various applications and industry verticals.
III. REVIEW METHODOLOGY
The section presents the review methodology and is
centered around the regulations proposed by
Kitchenham et al. [47], [48]. The complete review is parti-
tioned into six logical strategies mentioned below.
A. REVIEW PLAN

steps are followed for literature (i) Determine the research
questions, (ii) observe sources of data, (iii) apply constraints
for search on collected data, (iv) apply criteria for inclusion

ture survey includes different publications such as research
papers, books, and articles in a relevant domain such as
AR/VR, 6G, and BC. The gathered material was analyzed for
quality, and then the relevant data for the topic was retrieved
from the survey. A well-planned and systematic review
can assist researchers in producing fair results without any
biasing.

We discussed the research steps as per defined guide-
lines and regulations to fulfill subsequent research
requirements.
IV. PROPOSED 6G AND BC-ENVISIONED AR/VR
ARCHITECTURE
In this section, we present the existing architecture that
caters to AR/VR technology requirements. First, we present
the details of decentralized 6G-envisioned BC-secured
AR ecosystems. Then we present a more holistic picture
covering different use-cases of smart city technologies cen-
tered around decentralized AR/VR applications, namely
smart wearables, edge server computing, and smart parking.
We highlighted the key fundamental of 5G/6G communica-
tion aspects to support the network management issues in
these applications. Finally, the section addresses RQ 1, as the
section addresses the potential benefits and reference archi-
tecture of the BC-envisioned AR/VR ecosystem in massive
IoT environments.
A. EXISTING BC-BASED AR/VR ECOSYSTEM
This section presents a use-case of the industry 4.0 automa-
tion ecosystem and focuses on the automatic inspection of
machines and processes to automate the in-site monitoring
process. The collected data from in-site monitoring systems
are analyzed through supportive AI techniques and are passed
to different supply-chain stakeholders. To support massive
bandwidth requirements, we assume communication through
6G-FeMBB service to leverage real-time automation and
control. Once the data is presented to different stakehold-
ers in the supply-chain ecosystem, BC is used at different
supply chain points to ensure consistency and timestamped
chronology among users. FIGURE 6 shows the architecture
of a decentralized system along with AR and VR.
• Utilizing AR in Industry 4.0 process cycle: We discuss
AR as a key driver for the industry 4.0 automation cycle

inspection of products. In the existing scenario, the
industrial machines are sensor-driven and are networked
to support different processes in action. At the in-site
architecture, robots are employed to monitor and phys-
ically inspect the different processes. Through robots,
human intervention is minimized and is particularly
useful in hazardous industries like petroleum, chemical,
natural gas, and oil industries where boring and drilling
operations involve significant risk to human life. The
robots collect sensor data, and the collected data is
aggregated and sent to the cloud server for analytics.
To improve robots’ learning, reinforcement learning is
a suitable choice as it ensures a reward-penalty-driven
mechanism so that robots can learn and adapt to external
environments. The functioning of the sensors and robots
can be viewed through AR-driven interactive controls,
and robotic gestures can be monitored visually. AR sys-
tems consume a lot of bandwidth, and thus network
management is a critical aspect. In the industrial pro-
cess, real-time automation is required in critical applica-
tions like bomb disposal, driving vehicles, heavy-weight
lifting, assembly pipelines, and many more. Thus,
6G-FeMBB networks can support the real-time band-
width, which ensures precision and a consistent network.
For low latency, services like TI, muRLLC, and mMTC
(for sensor-to-sensor communication) are preferred.
• Data Analytics: AR collected data such as high-
resolution videos and images of the day-to-day process
are used for Ground-Zero analytics. A back-end data

visualization engine would process the data and provide
the required visuals. BC ensures decentralization and
encryption and provide data access to authorized people.
• Supply Chain Integration: In supply-chain ecosys-
tems, BC-ensures chronological and timestamped points
between every stakeholder in the chain, that starts from
the manufacturer, the supplier, logistics, warehouse stor-
age, buyers, and the users. Thus, at each key point, trust
is required. BC leverages the required trust among all
points in the supply-chain ecosystem and ensures auto-
mated funds transfer between every stakeholder through
associated SCs. Thus, manual intervention is reduced,
middle-men and third-party intermediaries are removed,
and black-marketing, and hoarding of products are elim-
inated. This ensures a complete and transparent end-to-
end ecosystem. BC allows all users access to the same
state of the ledger, thus improving errors’ traceability.
BC also improves the quality and proper access-control
on shared data that reduces the production cost. Working
machines and fault isolation in AR and VR supply-chain
systems becomes easy as machine models can be easily
viewed through realistic 3D modeling. Thus, AR/VR
supported the supply-chains result in higher produc-
tion, minimized cost, reduced machine downtime, and
increased profits.
B. A PROPOSED REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE OF
BC-BASED 6G-ENVISIONED MASSIVE
IoT-SUPPORTED AR/VR ECOSYSTEM
This subsection proposes a reference architecture for a smart
city ecosystem that supports different IoT verticals like smart
vehicles, smart parking, interactive XR, smart wearables,
factory automation, and many more. FIGURE 7 presents
the key details of BC-leveraged 6G-envisioned massive
IoT-supported AR/VR ecosystems.
In the proposed architecture, we envision the use-case
of a massive information-centric IoT ecosystem, with ser-
vices orchestrated through 6G communication systems. IoT
encompasses millions of connected sensor devices that con-
stantly interact and interplay with 6G edge and cloud nodes
and requires high data ingestion and ultra-low latency nodes.
6G offers ubiquitous connectivity and access to different IoT
verticals like smart automation, smart homes, smart indus-
tries, and smart playgrounds, with interactive AR/VR expe-
rience embedded with the nodes. AR/VR nodes are expected
to transition massive IoT data and require high data-rate sup-
port for the peak bandwidth scenarios to address 6G-access
nodes bottlenecks. In 6G networks, due to high demand by
AR/VR users, we envision a massive-IoT framework where
the services and demands are fullymobilized through an array
of a 6G-based integrated network of airspace, land, sea, and
VOLUME 9, 2021 168467

massive wireless TI networks. Moreover, 6G is envisioned
to employ edge intelligence schemes like machine learning
and deep learning algorithms, for example, computer vision
algorithms to detect vehicle movements, deep-sea sightings,
and others. In this scenario, the content services provided
by AR/VR are expected to communicate with vehicular net-
works, UAVs, user nodes, NFV-supported routing nodes,
and production systems to involve the immersive XR. Some
notable use-cases include AR/VR supported UAV monitor-
ing; AR/VR assisted autonomous driving, and AR/VR-based
plug and play user services.
To leverage the supportive AR/VR integration with
6G-envisioned massive IoT at low latency, trusted content-
caching is critical. The shared data of multiple users and
requests for data access have to be secured to ensure pri-
vacy, trust, and security from malicious attackers. Thus,
we ensure BC as decentralized and traceable ledgers in the
ecosystem to mitigate the attack vectors. Also, SCs can be
executed on-demand to ensure the automated flow of funds
among different nodes involved in transactions. To ensure
the key potential of BC in 6G-envisioned information-centric
IoT, we assume that edge routers have to build local BC
ledgers and verify the local transactions through elected
nodes. Thus, a permissioned BC is more suitable, where
the access and control rights are only with the authorized
stakeholders. The permissioned BC nodes would record the
local transactions, collaboration contracts in 6G-massive IoT,
including paid content AR/VR service, paid edge-resource
transactions in terms of computation, bandwidth access, and
communication-related services. There are two major con-
straints to deal with massive IoT communication, viz. energy
consumption, and latency. BC records the world-state ledgers
for all the transactions and forms the respective endorsements
in the permissioned ledger.
Table 6 presents the power and latency efficient consen-
sus mechanisms proposed for massive IoT AR/VR space.

TABLE 7. 6G and BC as key-drivers for AR applications.
TABLE 8. 6G and BC as key-drivers for VR ecosystems.
Certain IIoT devices rely on batteries also to operate; they
require a low-powered consensus approach to reduce min-
ing time and complex cryptographic computation over-
heads. Along with energy-saving, multiple IoT networks
and nodes communicate with each other in real-time. These
nodes typically rely on intermediate gateways for mining,
increasing overall latency during critical AR/VR applica-
tions. As depicted, the choice of a particular consensus proto-
col depends on the type of supported application. In industrial
IoT networks, there is a trade-off in scalability and associated
cost to support the high transaction rate. Some consensus
protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT),
Tangle, and Raft are suitable in IoT due to low costs but
are not scalable for large networks. On the other hand, Del-
egated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), Proof-of-Importance (PoI),
and Omniledger are more apt for large-scale IoT ecosystems
but would require high storage overheads. The choice of an
optimal consensus thus requires a careful study of the network
requirements, and tailor-made consensus are leveraged for
respective networks [49].
For content services in 6G-massive IoT, we propose a
content-centric IPv6 network that would replace the legacy
IPv6 and IP router nodes. The content-centric IPv6 would be
controlled through NFV-state, and thus, it would effectively
decouple the IP address with the content location and form
an effective content address. The routers are envisioned to
support the content-addressing scheme. Through a unified
content name, the edge router closest to the content would
service the required user. Thus, it would drastically reduce
the high-end latency requirements of sending the content
request to cloud-based services. Based on the user behav-
ior, recommender systems can be built on the router as an
additional service that can cache content from local edge
routers or send the request to the cloud servers to gather
similar contents. The nodes can request cache offloading
from edge-IoT nodes based on an agreed resource pricing
mechanism.
In case of cache-offloading request, the requested AR/VR
content, the nodes would check its local cache list to inform
the user whether the content is available or has to be serviced
through a pricing model. In case the content is present, a
6G-FeMBB service is set up to download the content. The
cache list consists of an index-pair address of the actual stored
content and gets updated if the content is modified. When
the latter happens, the cache list is not-authoritative, and a
fresh copy of content has to be fetched. The content request is
forwarded through NFV-flow table requests to the 6G-access
nodes.
This section discussed the existing BC-based AR/VR
techniques deployed and their limitations. Subsequently,
we presented reference architecture based on BC and 6G
for the massive IoT AR/VR ecosystem. The readers can
understand the difference between existing and proposed
architecture and the implied advantages.
V. SOLUTION TAXONOMY
In this section, we present a solution taxonomy based on the
coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR ecosystems. FIGURE 8
shows the proposed solution taxonomy. We present the key
benefits of BC integration in AR and VR ecosystems. Table 7
presents the key benefits in the AR ecosystems, whereas
Table 8 presents the benefits in VR. The technical prospective
are presented as follows.

FIGURE 8. The proposed solution taxonomy of coalition of 6G and BC in AR/VR ecosystems.
A. AUGMENTED REALITY
There are several scenarios where AR-based systems can
obtain huge credibility from BC. The details are presented
as follows.
1) SECURITY PERSPECTIVE
In this section, we talk about the applicability of BC and
6G in AR to show how the latter would benefit applica-
tions that require high data rate handling and processing at
desired levels of security, trust, and access control. Thus,
we form the creation of a decentralized framework for assets
identification.
a: CREATION OF IP-PROTECTED DIGITAL ASSETS
When it comes to digital assets, verifying whether they are
unique or replicated is a difficult task. For creators of digital
assets in VR or AR, BC allows the virtual items unique and
non-redundant properties. This application of BC increases
the privacy and security amongst users and their creations.
Some companies combine BC and VR to sell virtual real
estate in which the uniqueness and validness of the asset
are the keys. For example, Lampix combines BC, AR, and
computer vision to track virtually represented data at various
places. With BC-driven intellectual property, there are many
advantages. BC holds the values of IP assets that are owned
by different businesses and companies across the world.
Licensing and authenticating these agreements can be made
easy with SCs, and it would provide definite evidence of
ownership for virtual and real assets. Thus, in the legal sense,
BC has the potential to drive matters that involve jurisdiction
as easy to proof systems as it can assert the ownership of
digital assets stored in the distributed chain ledgers. Thus
legal disputes are resolved easily [50].
b: SCALING AR WITH BC TECHNOLOGY
A new use-case of AR technology is the virtual try-on, which
allows consumers and shoppers to try new outfits at home
easily, and look and feel the outfits on their bodies. The try-on
facility is expanded to design homes as paint colors, fittings,
and othermaterials, and thus extracts huge revenue in the inte-
rior design sector. However, the current cloud infrastructure
is not mature enough to handle these applications’ high band-
width and latency requirements. To address the issue, a decen-
tralized peer-to-peer network is more applicable. Thus, the
render network (RNDR) aims to address the issue by creating
an extensive peer-to-peer network that consists of graphical
processing units (GPU). After this network is ready, any GPU
can power this network which can be utilized by AR applica-
tions to render their updated applications. In return, owners
of these GPUs earn render tokens that can be redeemed for
cash or render their graphics. As this network progresses,
the entire system changes and upgrades into a decentralized
marketplace. Hence, this network would help and aid the
distribution and monetization of immersive, interactive XR,
and light-field media on thin client devices like AR glasses,
light-field displays, and mobile untethered VR headsets [51].
2) COMMUNICATIVE PERSPECTIVE
This subsection discusses the applicability of BC and 6G in
AR through a high-speed, reliable network for 3D interaction
and security of ownership.
a: AR CLOUD
The AR Cloud is a real-time mapping of the world object,
which is cast on the RR. It connects the physical and dig-
ital worlds using spatial computing technology. It acts as a
digital twin to provide real-world experience to users from
any device, location at any time. As the BC technology helps
the user verify the authenticity of the digital asset being sold,
it can prove hugely profitable, especially in situations where
the asset is region-specific in the case of video games where
actual profit can be made considering the rarity of the asset.
This, in turn, influences the AR applications and turns them
into profitable ventures. Companies across the world can
168470 VOLUME 9, 2021
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
create their custom version of AR Cloud, and it can open up
a new stream of interactive market [52].
AR Cloud, when integrated with various technologies such
as computer vision, localization, mapping, and 6G connectiv-
ity, can deliver persistent content. Google’s AR-based nav-
igation uses Google’s visual positioning service (VPS) and
AR cloud to increase accuracy.
AR Cloud also has a huge potential in gaming. For exam-
ple, Google’s Just A Line game allows people in the real world
to draw collaboratively in a virtual world together. This could
allow engineers and architects to design and create internal
structures of places in the future. With AR Cloud, coaches
in sports could provide live feedback, ease judgments, and
speed-up updates. AR Cloud could solve the problem of
buying real-world 3D objects based on 2D images available
on the website.
b: UTILIZING BC TO POWER A DECENTRALIZED AR
ECOSYSTEM
AR can be used to run marketing campaigns and advertising.
It can directly help users find their required product with
ease. As AR is a 3D map, consumers can be guided to
specific shops where required brands or products are offered.
Different apps can be made for public places like parks, and
museums [53]. To simplify the union between BC and AR,
one can consider the game Pokemon Go for real where every
Pokemon collected is unique, and each has its own set of
distinct abilities. Hence, the rare ones could make the fans or
customers hunt and trade them in reality, using real money.
This would create a very different dynamic which would be
profitable [54].
B. VIRTUAL REALITY
In this subsection, we present the key directions of different
VR applications. We present the solution in two parts- the
security perspective and the communication perspective. The
details are presented as follows.
1) SECURITY PERSPECTIVE
Here, we talk about the applicability of blockchain and 6G
in VR, which benefits from the seamless transmission of
digital data in real-time while preserving users’ identities
through BC-based fragmentation.
a: CREATING SECURE VIRTUAL WORLDS
There is a huge demand for VR-based systems and appli-
cations like entertainment and gaming; at the same time
requires security against malicious activities, viz. hacking,
duplication, destruction. BC helps in the verification of the
actual copy of VR software and avoids forgery. In addition,
BC helps in maintaining the identities of VR users and helps
them establish item ownership [55].
b: UNIVERSAL FILE FORMATTING
Application of BC helps in normalizing fragmentation,
file formatting, and mode sharing of data to avoid global
connectivity issues and ensure maximum security, privacy,
and verification of identity. BC-based peer-to-peer dis-
tribution systems exist that assist people in collaborat-
ing by sharing the same virtual spaces through the latest
AR applications [55].
2) COMMUNICATIVE PERSPECTIVE
Here, we discuss the applicability of blockchain and 6G
in VR, where VR deals with the gaming industry and incorpo-
rates BC to create large-scale advertisements using tokeniza-
tion. With 3D experience, VR can boom the e-commerce
industry.
a: IN-GAME ADVERTISING
A recent Research and Markets report states that the global
gaming market shot up to USD 173.7 billion in 2020 and
is predicted to go as high as about USD 314.4 billion
by 2026 with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR)
of 9.64 % [56].
With the increased demand in the gaming arena, adver-
tising plays a profitable role as the former and latter are
interlinked. All popular games advertise in-game purchases
based on the gamer’s interest. VRwould help creators indulge
in advertising with more potential and help create effec-
tive interactive models. Cryptocurrency can also be used
by users and gamers when they interact with advertise-
ments. BC can compensate users possessing coins to inter-
act with advertisements for logging information about their
activities [57].
b: VIRTUAL COMMERCE
Evolution of VR in e-commerce would attract more con-
sumers and promote its popularization. A combination of
VR and 3D modeling in software could help e-commerce
revolutionize user interfaces and renew ideas. VR treats users
and computers as a whole through which people will be able
to directly feel information and objects, which would give
them a greater sense of control [58].
C. 6G NETWORKS
This section highlights the key benefits of 6G networks in
scaling secured and trusted AR/VR applications. Table 9
presents the key research directions of the coalition of BC and
6G-envisioned AR/VR in different industry verticals. Some
of the potential 6G applications are presented as follows.
1) SCALABILITY
End-to-end latency in 5G and 6G networks is less than 1 mil-
lisecond, allowing extremely high transaction throughput
rates. Bitcoin and Ethereum, two major BC networks cryp-
tocurrency networks, only manage to add≈ 10− 14 transac-
tions per second. On the other hand, private and consortium
BC can ad up to 22000 transactions per second. As a result,
6G architectures and algorithms are continuously being stud-
ied to boost the throughput of BC networks [59].

TABLE 9. Key research directions on BC and 6G-envisioned AR/VR in different industry verticals.
2) CROWDSOURCING
In 6G networks, small infrastructure investors would be
able to roll out cellular towers that would play a key role
in reducing operators’ infrastructure costs. The concept of
investors gains related to the phenomenon of crowdsourcing.
These investors must be both registered and verified. In a
decentralized, trustworthy manner, BC and SC can provide a
key role in registering towers and managing used resources.
BC can form ledgers that would include the operational
charges like billing, maintenance, and service charge of the
towers, and SCs would automate the fund clearance based
on a specified set of logistics. This ensures transparency and
auditability in payment ecosystems, and the payments are
managed through crypto-tokens. The tower owner can reg-
ister important attributes regarding the tower’s capabilities,
hardware, pricing, availability, attestation and certification,
and reputation history through the infrastructure company.
Information is then sent to all mobile providers once the tower
is registered to the owner name [59].
3) INFRASTRUCTURE SHARING
The mobile network operator (MNO) provides telecom ser-
vices in various ways, including active and passive sharing.
BC is helpful in the management and tracking of resource
distribution and consumption. With SCs, an immediate and
safe agreement for sharing and secure payment is established
among all stakeholders [64].
4) SPECTRUM SHARING
Spectrum sharing is a costly feature in 6G or lower cellular
networks, as substantial sums of money are paid to spectrum
regulators. The operator buys bands and sub-bands and then
utilizes or leases them to other operators. BC technology
can be used for license shared access (LSA), and cognitive
radio networks (CRN) can be integrated with BC to provide
a distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol for the
networks’ secondary users. In addition, spectrum sharing
based on BC would allow for the virtualization of network
resources. The federal communications commission (FCC)
has suggested that BC-based spectrum sharing service can be
embedded easily in the 6G protocol stack as BC-is the integral
component of 6G stacked applications [65].
5) NETWORK SLICING
Localization of the physical infrastructure or the underlying
network services and capabilities is referred to as network
slicing. It enables the operator to set up a division and serve
a diverse range of users, services, and applications while
maintaining the same internal network infrastructure [66].
Spectrum and infrastructure sharing would also benefit from
network slicing. The slicing is done by a network slicing
broker (NSB), which considers all of the network’s service
capabilities. An SC with decentralized storage can be used to
replace practically all NSB functions in its place. BC would
also authenticate network slices, and secure payments [67].
6) INTERNATIONAL ROAMING
In international Roaming, third parties are involved, which
causes changes in rules and payments among the users.
Several drawbacks exist in present conditions, such as
(i) A single point of control that could fail, (ii) Expenses that
go to intermediaries, and (iii) Insecure and fraudulent activi-
ties. SCs can secure payments and remove the involvement of
third parties, thereby reducing expense, tracking, and auditing
all analytical factors. SCs reduce the litigation costs, and
parties that abide by the contracts are committed to binding
to the rules defined in the contract.
This section discussed the solution taxonomy pro-
posed for integration of BC and 6G in the AR/VR
ecosystem. The taxonomy detailed the benefits in the
latter from a security and communication perspective.
At the end of this section, the readers can get the high-
lights of various real-world applications in AR/VR sys-
tems utilizing 6G and BC.

VI. OPEN ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
This section presents the open issues and challenges of the
integration of BC and 6G in AR/VR applications. The section
address the RQ 4 question as it highlights the challenges of
BC in security and data handling in 6G-envisioned AR/VR
ecosystems. Table 10 presents the key parameters and high-
lights the open issues and challenges of the coalition of
6G and BC in AR/VR deployments. It is known that BC
suffers from limitations of network bandwidth, transactional
throughput rate, and scalability. The issues are intensified
when we move to public BC ledgers. Thus, the integra-
tion of BC to manage the transactional ledger states of
AR/VR contents requires effective design platforms. More-
over, SCs, if executed in public environments, are vulnerable
to contract-based attacks like gas attacks, re-entrancy attacks,
dead code attacks, andmanymore. Thus, adopting BC and SC
for AR/VR data requires effective principles and implemen-
tation strategies.
6G ensures benefits of KPIs. However, the latter is in the
developmental phase; as a result, a coalition of BC and 6G in
decentralized AR/VR ecosystems to drive various use-cases
requires common formats for communication protocols and
globally structured standards.
• Flow-rate control: In distributed networks, peer-to-peer
networks are limited in terms of bandwidth, with bot-
tlenecks in peak data rate duration. With 6G infrastruc-
ture, and FeMBB service, the available bandwidth is
improved, but the end-devices have tomap to the defined
baud rate of communication to manage the flow con-
trol of 6G-access nodes. Currently, electronic devices
would face a bottleneck inmaintaining flowmechanisms
to cope with the FeMBB service. Due to a mismatch
in baud rates, the data transfer rate would be high in
the core networks, but due to the low line rate, the
benefit would be compromised at end-systems; thereby,
the potential QoI of immersive AR/VR would be
limited.
• Real-time Avatars: In 6G, holographic communication
requires sub-µ latencies for a successful realization.
To design a real-time avatar design, the hardware ren-
dering engines have to update the user information in
real-time over a peer-to-peer network. With the current
deployments, a large amount of computing resources
and power is required to satisfy the requirements of
real-time avatar movements.
• Non-conformant standards: 6G networks protocols and
mechanisms are in developmental phases, and most
defined protocols are proprietary-based. Thus, realiz-
ing the full potential of AR/VR applications in diverse
industry verticals would require uniformity in standard
and protocol designs.
• Variable QoI: In 6G networks, each user is serviced
differentially, and the provided service depends on the
user pricing and pay-per-demand mechanisms. Thus,
the core 6G-enabled routers have to be designed with
sufficient maturity to handle the variable application
services and differential provisioning for heterogeneous
users and networks. Thismight result in connectivity and
variable delays at the end-user, thereby it reduces the
QoI provisioning of the AR/VR users.
• Scalability and high latency: In BC networks, the scala-
bility of users is a critical problem. The issue is further
intensified in public BC networks, where the mining
time is quite high than permissioned networks. However,
6G nodes can service the mining-as-a-service mecha-
nism through edge nodes. Still, the resource transfer and
transactional record deployment have to be managed
through the BC network itself, further jeopardizing the
latency at end-users, thereby affecting the overall scala-
bility of mined blocks.
• Government regulations: In many countries, still cryp-
tocurrency transfers are not considered legal tender.
Thus, in the case of inter-country payments, gov-
ernment regulations play a critical role in designing
VOLUME 9, 2021 168473
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
a cryptocurrency exchange server that would facilitate
seamless inter-country payments through a regulated
network.
• Illegal cryptocurrency markets: Owing to the anony-
mous nature of cryptocurrency payments, it is heavily
used by malicious entities like hackers and criminals for
the supply of restricted goods inside a country. Due to
a low level of clarity and lack of cryptocurrency regula-
tions, the cryptocurrency markets are not regulated, and
thus there are illegal e-commerce supplies. The nature of
such supplies is not traceable to the original supplier, and
thus fairness in chronological supply-chain movements
is a critical challenge to be addressed.
• SC executions and vulnerability: SCs executed in per-
missionless environments like ethereum and bitcoin
are susceptible to various insider and outsider-based
malicious attacks by an adversary. Even in
permissioned environments, the security of data flow
is dependent on the authenticating stakeholders. If the
majority of the stakeholders perform collision-based
attacks, they can control the overall consensus of the
permissioned ecosystem, and thus SCs are vulnerable
in such scenarios. Common attacks include gas-based
attacks, contract-flow attacks, injection-based attacks,
code re-entrancy problems, and mining pool attacks that
can disrupt the entire working state of SC execution.
The solution to such attacks is to design SCs in isolated
containers or dockers, but it adds up to the overall design
cost. Therefore, the address of open SCs execution and
contract execution frameworks is a critical issue.
• Issues in privacy-preservation of AR/VR users: In dif-
ferent countries, the rules of privacy-preservation of
AR/VR users are different. Hence privacy-preservation
mechanisms like differential privacy, K-anonymity,
I-diversity, and t-closure have to be designed to con-
form to the global legislation rules. Therefore, the con-
formance of privacy-preservation schemes for AR/VR
users and the definition of a similar set of privacy for all
users is a critical challenge that needs to be addressed in
the future.
This section highlighted the open issues and chal-
lenges of the integration of 6G andBC inAR/VR ecosys-
tems to address the implementation requirements of full-
fledged end-to-end ecosystem deployment.
VII. BvTours: BC-BASED 6G-ASSISTED AR/VR VIRTUAL
HOME TOUR SERVICE
In this section, we propose an AR/VR based, 6G and
BC-assisted smart home buying application scheme, named
as BvTours. The above technologies help in transforming
people from the conventional way of buying real estate
properties these days. A recent research estimation from
Goldman Sachs reports that VR in real estate alone can
maximize the generation to as much as $2.6 billion by
2025 [68]. In a traditional workflow, a real estate agent
provides the client a long list of properties (such as apart-
ments, large living penthouse, duplex, row-house, etc.). This
follows a series of explanations, negotiations, and finally
the real-life visits to houses and apartments. This process
consumes a considerable amount of both estate agents’ and
home-buyers time, especially when properties are far, which
needs a long journey and becomes expensive. In addition
to the above, the on-site construction projects often change,
thereby inculcating them in the model apartment is a costly
process.
AR/VR technology provides virtually anytime/anywhere
real-estate solutions and proves to be fast, efficient, and an
easy way for people to get a real sense of home. AR/VR
integration in real estate provides advantages viz. saves time
andmoney, builds emotional connections, offers global reach,
bridges connection and ownership, provides virtual staging,
architectural visualization, and virtual commerce. Typically
two 3D virtual tours are popularly used by real estate compa-
nies, viz. interactive visits, and guided visits. In guided visits,
it resembles commercial video, a virtual video, or 360-degree
form (a type of VR). It is best suited for fixed properties as
it can be captured through a panoramic camera. In interactive
visits, the person chooses where to move within a property
by spotting special hot spots in the field of view (FOV). It is
more interactive and efficient than guided visits as it can lure
maximum clients.
Traditionally, commercial real estate (CRE) technol-
ogy is concerned with listings and connecting buyers
and sellers. BC technology can potentially transform
home-buying operations such as property transactions like
purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management trans-
actions. The BC-leveraged system would provide verifi-
able, and censorship-resistant options, provides secure and
tamper-resistant shared databases, enhance transaction pro-
cess quickly and economically, eliminating the need for inter-
mediaries (such as brokers, companies, banks). SCs in BC
tokenize the property, enabling buyers to trade their assets like
stocks and facilitate online transactions (like earning a certain
amount of money after the liquidation of property through a
token).
The extremely large data flow among interconnected
devices up to the end-users requires guaranteed QoS require-
ments. Due to ubiquitous AR/VR communication in 6G,
it is very important to provide the former with the required
resources (e.g., high computational processing capabilities
and power, storage, graphics processing, communication
assets) through a chain of massive devices to achieve the
feasibility enhancement. IC, a decentralized network archi-
tecture, has been adopted to cope up with large-scale content
distribution in 6G, which enables network caching in AR/VR
content [33]. Because of the very high data rate and usable
bandwidth requirements, there is tremendous pressure on
the network and security to potential threats to IC routers.
Integration of BC is a possible fit and would enable trust

and co-operation amongmassiveAR/VR nodes, distribute the
content caching of nodes, and ensure sharing of resources.
To amortize the overall buyer requirements in AR/VR
applications, we propose BvTours, a reference architecture
in a modern buyer-seller scenario for CRE environments.
The proposed case study integrates 6G and BC for providing
an incredible virtual tour experience without affecting QoI
and security requirements. FIGURE 9 shows the three-tier
architecture of BvTours which is explained in subsequent
sections.
A. AR/VR SENSING LAYER
At the sensing layer, we assume a composition of apartments,
buildings, homes (view of the garden, lake, shopping malls,
etc.) that spreads in an area of interest. These places are
equipped with static cameras and flying drones equipped
with a high-speed video imaging system and GPS to capture
the complete view in 360 degrees of freedom. Furthermore,
the realtor bench is equipped with AR/VR reception system
integrated with the software. It provides a platform to cre-
ate personalized design portraits, staging, decorations to the
chosen property to increase the relationship between the user
and a virtual environment. It is also equipped with specialized
user apps to customize different buyer-oriented items and
facilitates the former and investors to see inside premises
from their computer screens, gaining a sense of the building’s
space, style, and atmosphere.
B. 6G INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER
At the 6G infrastructure layer, we envision that AR/VR appli-
cations are connected to millions of user nodes. 6G access
nodes control the inflow and outflow of data with extremely
low latency, high reliability, and network rate and improve the
QoI. The layer also supports AI-assisted intelligent comput-
ing, cognition, natural language processing, libraries to sup-
port audio, video content (for example- convolutional neural
nets, single-shot detection, and many others). The overall
integration ensures a highly effective user experience and
connectivity for interactive AR/VR applications like holo-
graphic teleportation, immersive XR, real-world audio-video
perception and experience, 3D-object location identification,
high precision, and control mapping. The 6G infrastructure is
layered in three planes: communication plane, service plane,
and information plane.
1) CHANNEL MODELLING
Table 11 presented a comparative analysis of different
channels and associated models. In the proposed case-
study BvTours, we consider the integration of satellite and
ultra-massive MIMO channels at the infrastructure layer.
As satellite channels would be stable in diverse topological
conditions, it maintains a consistent user bandwidth during
the AR/VR session. As a model, we integrate GBSM to
model the satellite channel, mainly the regular shapedGBSM.
VOLUME 9, 2021 168475
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
FIGURE 9. BvTours: The proposed integrated scheme.
It supports high accuracy in the processing of link frames in
both large and small-scale fading channels.
2) COMMUNICATION PLANE
This plane consists of different service classes of 6G that
support high data rate, extremely low latency and power, and
long-distance communication. 6G protocol stack includes
services like FeMBB, eRLLC, ultra-massive machine-type
communications (umMTC), long-distance and high-mobility
communications (LDHMC), and extremely low-power com-
munications (ELPC) to improve the AR/VR experience.
FeMBB is responsible for extremely high data rates and
broadband services. A peak data rate of ≥ 1 Tbps for
ultra-resolution and 4K video transmission is fixed through
FeMBB. In support, at the communication plane, 6G-enabled
TI communication leverages fully sensory digital sensing
and reality, haptic interactions to cater to sub-millisecond
round-trip-time delay requirements for various holographic
and society applications.
3) SERVICE PLANE
This plane incorporates holographic communication ser-
vices and cache offloading phenomenon for efficient
distribution and security of private data. Holographic commu-
nication creates 3D visualization and transmits close-to-real
virtual vision sights of people and surrounding environments.
It employs access to multiple-view cameras and streams
high-definition videos. It also ensures very low latency for
real-time voice and intermediate control response.
The data transmission latency is related to delay between
the network core and installed base station. Under large
AR/VR user requests in peak traffic conditions, the network
caching philosophy can be utilized to reduce latency by stor-
ing the latest data at the edge of the network. Caching is fea-
tured architecture that improves the consumer-experienced
QoS and reduces overall network traffic, network congestion,
prevention of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and content
availability enhancement.
The network caching constituted four solutions viz.
caching placement, content delivery, centralized caching, and
distributed caching. The service plane is inherent in-network
content caching placement mechanism, consisting of
1) content placement and 2) content replacement. In con-
tent placement, the network selects a node for caching the
required content, while in content replacement, the node
decides the latest content to be kept in case of memory over-
flow. During the content delivery phase, each node caches
the content and serves it for the future. The caching approach
is selected based on the trade-off between high-end data
and induced latency which can be evaluated by employing
168476 VOLUME 9, 2021
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
FIGURE 10. Contract policy and endorsement in permissioned ecosystems.
various process control parameters. The centralized and dis-
tributed caching schemes are popular in 6G-based networks.
In a centralized caching strategy, a server/controller selects
a controlled group of nodes and caches replica versions
of content to reduce network delay and improve memory
resources. In distributed strategy, the centralized controller
is not present, and nodes decide caching based on the utiliza-
tion of local factors and metrics. This improves bandwidth
requirements and increases network efficiency. The adopted
policy is primarily governed by the computational complexity
of the algorithm and timing overheads due to central base
nodes.
4) INFORMATION PLANE
This plane incorporates enhanced intelligent estimation solu-
tions to handle losses, anomaly detection, and understanding
of key performance indicators (KPI) trends for heteroge-
neous and dense 6G channels. This incorporates machine
learning (ML) techniques along with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to improve the decision-making process,
management of resources (power, frequency bands), intelli-
gent aggregation, self-configuration, and context awareness
as per user requirements.
The data from access points is sent to cloud computing
and storage. The network nodes incorporate computing and
data aggregation features, i.e., the processing is done locally
at the edge/fog devices. These edge computing facilities are
controlled using NFV and SDN-controlled network entities.
They are equipped with the intelligent decision and learning
models that grab knowledge of resource allocation, network
slicing, handover, etc. A distributed AI-enabled edge archi-
tecture is considered that provides facilities such as storage,
processing, optimization, user management. The intelligent
core is the gateway of edge servers close to the users to
provide a real-time response with reduced response time.
C. CONTENT AND MINING LAYER
At the content and mining layer, the home buyer closes the
property’s AR/VR virtual tour session and sends a close ses-
sion request to the infrastructure builder. The session channel
close request is forwarded to the AR/VR controller at the
6G-service plane, and the 6G- access node closes the session.
The home buyer presents its purchase request to the builder of
the property, and the legal agreement draft is set up between
the buyer and the builder, which mentions all the terms of
the agreement. We initiate an SC between the stakeholders
VOLUME 9, 2021 168477
P. Bhattacharya et al.: Coalition of 6G and Blockchain in AR/VR Space: Challenges and Future Directions
(buyers and sellers) of the property, and the contract is exe-
cuted through the content and service management function.
The SC includes the details of the real estate property pur-
chase price, and the associated terms of payments (either in
full or in parts) are set up in the contract. In the case of loans,
the contract would ensure the involvement of the associated
bank, which funds the prospective buyer the loan for the
property and associates the repayment tenure in the contract
and the equated installments. Once the contract conditions are
fixed, it is executed in permissioned mode only between the
authorized stakeholders associated with the contract.
In permissioned network, we design the operational set of
procedures through an operational agent. The main function
of the agent is to listen to the set of events defined in the
contract, and the nodes in the permissioned network establish
a consensus for executing the contract based on the defined
operational policy [76]. In Hyperledger fabric, we define
the executable logic through the ledger state. FIGURE 10
shows the defined contract and endorsement policies between
the home buyer and home seller. To implement the same,
we consider chaincode execution environments, where we
consider home buyer entity as HB1 and home seller entity
as HS1. We define a contract asset that represents the real
estate that HB1 wishes to buy from HS1. To invoke the
chaincode, we agree on the transfer ownership of asset from
HS1 to HS2, through three invoked functions, namely, query,
transfer, and update. The asset contract is packaged into iso-
lated dockers as chaincodes to be deployed on the low-level
fabric. As the dockers assure isolation property, the privacy of
owner and seller details is preserved. A world-state is defined
as the fabric that holds the cache of current asset states,
and get, put, and update states are saved in the world-state.
The CreatePropertyAsset creates a new asset object for real-
state, and we define the set of endorsement policies for SC
that defines the communicating stakeholders involved in the
chaincode operation. In the endorsement policy, we consider
two entities HB1 and HS1, and execute the contract. Once the
endorsement policy is valid, it executes a peer node in the BC
network, takes the input of the transactional proposal from the
world-state as a response, and updates the read-write buffers.
In case of invalid transactions, the read-write buffers are not
executed. The communicating fabric channels are invoked
in case of a multi-transaction environment between buyers
and sellers. For each communication, a separate channel is
invoked so that the privacy of data is maintained. The chan-
nel state contains the ledger instance, chaincode object, and
details of world-state ledgers. Once the contract is executed,
the miner node is selected in the permissioned network to
mine the block, and add it to the on-chain ledger.
D. WORKFLOW OF BvTours
FIGURE 11 shows the main workflow diagram of the pro-
posed study architecture for AR/VR sharing. The user (HB)
and the real-estate management (IB) layers an important
constituents for end-to-end secured access using 6G com-
munication network. The architecture assumes entity set
represented by E = {EHB,EIB,EAR/VR,E6G,ECSM } where
EHB represents the client or home buyer, EIB represents the
real-estate developer or builder (IB), EAR/VR is the defined
AR/VR controlling module between builder and client that
connects services like content processing, service request and
grant, caching and ultra-low latency data transfer. For AR/VR
service, the process initializes when EHB (user/home buyer)
forwards a virtual tour request toEIB. Here, we assume a set of
k buyers, represented by EHB = {HB1,HB2,HB3, . . . ,HBk}
related to a set of m builders, represented by EIB =
{IB1, IB2, IB3, . . . , IBm} defined through a relational set M :
EHB H⇒ EIB. Any HBk forwards virtual tour request VTreq
to EIB that comprises of various parameters viz. location of
apartment, apartment entity identification, apartment size and
apartment cost. The above parameters can be set represented
as VTreq = {LI ,EI , SI ,CI }. If the parameters of VTreq relates
to EIB, the corresponding request will be accepted and EIB
calls EAR/VR for content transfer. EAR/VR is supported by three
planes viz. communication plane (PC ), service plane (PS ) and
information plane (PI ) as explained in 6G infrastructure layer.
PC delivers FeMBB services and supports bandwidth Bsup.
The content delivered to the user (or home buyer) consists
of n video frames represented as V = {F1,F2, . . . ,Fn}. The
calculated latency for the nth frame can be written as follows.
L =
Framesize
Bandwidth
=
Fn
Bsup
(1)
For processing video frame content, the demanded channel
bandwidth B > Bsup/Fn. AR/VR controller (EAR/VR) sends
FeMBB request FeMBBreq to 6G interface (E6G). FeMBB
service is then initiated and grants FeMBBreq. At EAR/VR
end, intelligent caching service starts to transfer the contents
with high speed to grant VTreq to the home buyer (HB).
HB and IB allocate the resources on the channel through an
access scheme (typically time-division multiplexing (TDM))
technique to multiplex data packets for virtual tour requests
between them. Once the channel access is permitted, the
session starts between the former and latter, and massive
data in the form of packets will be transferred to EHB with
ultra-low latency. Once EHB finished the virtual tour, the
session and occupied channel will be closed. At E6G end,
FeMBB service stops and acknowledges all the entities.
At this point, EHB completes the virtual tour experience.
EHB initiates purchase request to EIB and latter contacts ECSM
for creating smart contracts. ECSM completes the task and
sends back smart contracts to EIB that is finally forwarded
to EHB. The payment process initiates between EHB and EIB,
both entities represents wallets WHB and WIB respectively,
where data set WHB contains information such as amount,
userID, cryptocurrency, hash, Merkle root, and timestamp
denoted by WHB = {A, ID(HB),B,HT ,MR,T } and data set
WIB contains information such as contact information, pay-
ment, userID, cryptocurrency, hash, and Merkle root denoted
by WIB = {CI ,P, ID(IB),B,HT ,MR}. Once ECSM validates
the token transaction through a trusted collaboration, the
payment amount is transferred from EHB to EIB to ensure the

legality of actions. All the transactions will be thus guaran-
teed and protected by BC.
This section proposed a case-study BvTours, and pre-
sented a 6G-envisioned BC-leveraged virtual home tour
service. We presented the layered architecture, the com-
ponents, the smart contract and the workflow interac-
tions of the case-study.
VIII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In the performance evaluation, we address RQ 5 through the
presentation of the results forBvTours in terms of user welfare
or QoE that provides rich experiences from 6G technology.
The analysis would provide a broad comparison and advan-
tages of 6G over 5G networks.
QoE defines a high QoS and user-centric communica-
tions achieved by holographic communications, AR, VR,
and TI service, which requires a very high data rate with
extremely low latency. 6G focuses on QoE; to provide high
QoE, it demands low end-to-end latency. The evaluation is
done in terms of latency and miss probability of the arrival
of the processed packet. To improve memory limitations
and enhance the overall transactional performance of BC
decentralization, distribution off-chain IPFS storage is used
compared to conventional frameworks.
AR/VR packet transmission requires reliable transmis-
sion over the channel with low latency since a very high
data rate is involved. The transmission channel adds impair-
ments such as network delay, jitter (variation in propagation
time), packet loss. 5G-URLLC AR/VR QoS requirements
has bit error rate of the order of 10-3 – 10-5 and latency
of 5 – 10ms [77]. Compared with traditional video stream-
ing, AR/VR involves 360-degree video scene streaming with
much lower packet delivery latencywith varying environment
dynamics and user viewing behaviors. The latter will affect
user QoI and requires a much higher network bandwidth.
We define QoI in terms of induced network jitter for 5G and
6G protocols. We assume 4KUHD (3840× 2160) video with
120Hz scanning rate with 360◦ spherical coverage to transmit
hologram for a fully immersive VR experience. The network
latency affects the transmission of video packets and results in
poor reception quality and jitter under peak/experienced data
rate conditions. 6G network over-the-air latency being two
orders better than 5G counterpart (10µs compared to 1ms),
the former will induce fewer glitches in packet arrival time.
FIGURE 12a depicts the area under the curve of variation of
packet arrival time vs. number of transmitted video frames
for an effective AR/VR experience. It can be seen that the
trend of inter-packet latency is constant using 6G-FeMBB
service and shows an improvement of almost 60% compared
to 5G-eMBB service, which shows a highly interactive and
real-time feasibility of AR/VR experience of the proposed
scheme.
In 6G networks, network heterogeneity, exists to connect
a plethora of vertical applications exercising extremely large
data and varying QoS. Intelligent AI/ML-based estimation
algorithms are embedded at the core and edge networks
to carry out functionalities like content caching, sensing,
resource allocation, network slicing, and control. As men-
tioned previously, we assume 4K (3840 × 2160) 24-bit
color representation of VR video transmission packetized
with an average IP packet size of 576 bytes. The packet
also contains the header and destination information. At any
instance, t , access point (AP) or e-NB transmits 43,200 pack-
ets to edge computing or storage. These are deployed with
NFV and SDN-controlled intelligent agents to provide learn-
ing and decision-making caching mechanisms. Assuming a
cache size of 2.5GB, both 5G and 6G transmission networks
will satisfy the request size of 43,200 packets. Beyond it,
5G network will be insufficient to cache incoming requests
due to higher latency, and packets will be missed at a cache
with probability pm. FIGURE 12b shows the comparison
of miss probability vs. no of the request transmitted for
5G & 6G network with defined cache size. It can be seen
that the 6G-eRLLC network shows almost 43% improve-
ment in caching excess incoming packets at the edge layer.

At a certain threshold Tr , network congestion due to very high
delay results in excessive loss of requests, and pm is close to 1,
and almost all packets start to miss. However, the increase in
pm will occur at a higher value, and the threshold difference
will be greater in 6G networks than the 5G counterpart.
Finally, we present the analysis of the execution of SC in
terms of chaincode storage and the SC execution stored in
IPFS ledgers. FIGURE 12c shows the comparative analysis
in terms of obtained transaction throughput in terms of mined
blocks with SC execution. In BvTours, in the content and
mining layer, once EHB completes the virtual tour request
VTreq through the 6G-FeMBB, a SC is executed between EHB
and EIB. The SC is executed in a permissioned environment
as it includes the private details of EHB and is deployed on
a hyperledger machine. As the SC execution requires a legal
home purchased agreement and licensing, the transactional
wallets are instantiated once all the contract conditions are
met and property is registered in the name of EHB. The
results are stored in BC as an immutable and registered block.
As more such blocks are added, the main chain transaction
throughput drops due to increased mined blocks. Once pos-
sible, optimization is publishing the contract details on IPFS
ledgers, where registeredEHB and EIB can access the property
records through the IPFS hash key. The hash of the IPFS
main block is stored in the main BC as the address to refer
to the IPFS block, and thus more transactions are added per
block, which improves the block transactional throughput.
At 1000 block additions, for example, the hyperledger based
SC execution has a transaction rate of 144.871 Mbps. Com-
pared to this, IPFS published off-chain has a better transaction
rate of 289.722 Mbps, and thus the latency in SC execu-
tions and payment delays are minimized, which improves the
real-time payment service in BvTours.
This section discussed the performance evaluation of
the case-study BvTours in terms of quality of interaction,
reliability and transaction throughput.
IX. CONCLUSION
With the proliferation of massive connectivity in IoT,
technologies like AR and VR have emerged as disruptive
technologies to drive a range of verticals in the Industry
4.0 sector. The emergence of data-driven AR/VR applica-
tions has forced networks to be highly resilient, massively
connected, ultra-low latency, with real-time experience. Cou-
pled with this, incorporating security and trust in decentral-
ized data dissemination among heterogeneous stakeholders is
challenging. Thus, the article presents a novel and systematic
survey that presents the coalition of BC and 6G networks to
support AR/VR verticals. The article summarized the chal-
lenges of integrating BC and 6G in AR/VR and presented
a solution taxonomy to address a range of different appli-
cations. We presented the key concepts, architecture, proto-
cols, and technologies that addressed various facets of the
BC-envisioned 6G scheme for AR/VR. A solution taxonomy
is presented, and a BC-based decentralized architecture is
proposed. The open issues and challenges of the integration
are presented. Finally, a case study BvTours is presented
that discusses a 6G-based virtual tour service with secured
BC-based service. The workflow and interaction flow among
stakeholders is discussed. The adoption of case-study is val-
idated through performance evaluation in terms of packet
arrival time, packet miss probability, and BC-based through-
put is presented. The article lays a building foundation for
trusted 6G-based AR/VR decentralized applications.
In the future, the authors would like to investigate the
impact of BC-based trusted 6G service for mIoT applications.
