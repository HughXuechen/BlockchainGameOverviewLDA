The content of phenolic acids formed during wound healing of 7-irradiated and nonirradiated potato
tubers was determined by HPLC. Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were
detected in small quantities in resting whole tubers of irradiated and nonirradiated potatoes. During
wound healing their content increased many fold, and in addition, the neo and crypto isomers of chloro-
genic acid accumulated in the wound healing tissue. The increased formation of phenolics was
accompanied by a parallel rise in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Chlorogenic acid contributed
about 56% and together with the neo and crypto isomers accounted for 88% of the phenolics formed.
Tubers irradiated to 100 Gy for sprout inhibition showed significantly lower levels of chlorogenic acid
and its isomers during the first 8 days of wound healing. The results point to an impairment of wound-
induced biosynthesis of phenolics in general and chlorogenic acid and its isomers in particular by
irradiation.
INTRODUCTION
Phenolics are believed to be an important part of the
general defense mechanism of many plants to infection
(Kosuge, 1969; Friend, 1985) and have long been postulated
to play a role in the resistance of potatoes to soft rot bacteria
(Lovrekovich et al., 1967; Lyon, 1989). Potato tubers
contain a small amount of free and conjugated phenolic
acids, the major constituent being chlorogenic acid (Malm-
berg and Theander, 1984). A major factor limiting the
storage of potato tubers under tropical conditions is
bacterial soft rot. Apart from infection through the len-
ticels (Perombelon, 1973), wounds inflicted on the tubers
during harvest, handling, and transport can provide easy
entry to rot-producing pathogens. Losses due to disease
and desiccation can be minimized by proper wound healing
as soon as potatoes are harvested and placed in storage.
The wound healing process involves deposition of
suberin, a lipid phenolic polymer (Mader, 1958; Dean and
Kolattukudy, 1977) on cell layers below the wound surface
followed by formation of wound periderm. 7 irradiation
at sprout-inhibiting dose levels (100 Gy) is known to
prevent the formation of the wound periderm in potatoes
(Penner, 1970; Thomas, 1982), although suberization is
not affected (Thomas and Delincee, 1970). Increase in
total phenolic constituents of potato tubers subjected to
stress like 7 irradiation or wounding has been reported
(Pendharkar and Nair, 1987; Thomas and Delincee, 1970;
Thomas, 1982; Mondy and Gosselin, 1989). However, very
little information is available on the formation of individual
phenolic constituents in potato tubers during wound
healing. In our studies on the storage aspects of potato
tubers subjected to 7 irradiation for sprout inhibition, it
was of interest to know the factors that contribute to the
increased rotting tendency of irradiated tubers in response
to mechanical or wound injury. As part of these studies
the quantitative changes in individual phenolic acids of
irradiated and nonirradiated tubers when subjected to
wounding are reported in this paper.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mature potatoes of the Kufri Chandramukhi cultivar, 3-4
weeks old after harvest, were obtained from the local market and
held at ambient conditions for 8-10 days for proper curing. Tubers
with a well-set skin and free from diseases and mechanical injury
were irradiated to 100 Gy in a package irradiator (Atomic Energy
of Canada Ltd.) at a dose rate of 10 Gy/min. In earlier
investigations half-potatoes have been found to provide a
convenient system to study the wound metabolism in potato
tubers (Thomas and Delincee, 1979; Thomas, 1982). Hence, a
similar methodology was adopted in the present investigation.
Irradiated and nonirradiated tubers of uniform size were sliced
in half longitudinally from bud end to stem end and allowed to
wound heal at 25 °C by keeping them in enameled trays covered
with perforated polyethylene sheets of 150 gauge. The relative
humidity inside the trays was maintained at 90% by wetting
pieces of foam rubber kept alongside the tuber halves with distilled
water. No microbial contamination was noticed in the experi-
mental setup.
Preparation of Phenolic Extract. After 0,2,4,6,8,10,13,
15, and 17 days of wound healing period, 1 mm thick slices below
the wound surface including the suberized layer were cut from
six tuber halves with a stainless steel knife. The natural peri-

derm layer (skin) along the circumference of each slice was
removed with a blade and the remaining part of the slice cut into
small pieces. Ten grams of fresh tissue pooled from six tuber
halves was extracted with 75 mL of 85% aqueous methanol in
an Omni mixer at setting 3 for 3 min. The extract was filtered
through Whatman No. 541 filter paper in a Büchner funnel. The
residue was reextracted with 50 mL of 85% aqueous methanol
as above, the filtrates were pooled, and the volume was made up
to 150 mL. Complete extraction of total free phenolics as tested
by Folin-Denis reagent (Swain and Hillis, 1959) was observed by
this procedure. An aliquot of 2 mL was passed through a pre-
column (0.6 cm i.d. X 12 cm) packed with 200 mg of Corasil for
the purpose of removing nonphenolic components that otherwise
wound have been strongly retained by the HPLC column.
HPLC Analysis. HPLC separation was carried out as
described by Maiti et al. (1989) on a Du Pont Model 8800 series
instrument with a gradient controlled pump module, a Rheo-
dyne 7125 valve injector, a Spectro 400 variable-wavelength UV
detector, and a 25 cm X 4.6 mm i.d., 5-pm particle size, Zorbax
octadecylsilane (ODS) reversed-phase column (Du Pont). A
linear gradient elution was carried out by using solvent A, acetic
acid/water (2:98 v/v), and solvent B, acetic acid/acetonitrile/
water (2:30:68 v/v). During analysis the solvent gradient was
programmed from 10 to 100% B in A in 30 min with a flow rate
of 1.5 mL/min. The UV detector was set at 280 nm.
Peak Confirmation and Quantification. Chromatographic
peaks were tentatively identified by two procedures: (1) com-
parison of retention times of sample chromatographic peaks with
those of authentic standards (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO) using the same HPLC operating conditions and (2) co-
chromatography of the extract with the standard components.
Individual phenolic acids were quantified by reference to a
calibration curve for authentic standards. A linear relationship
was obtained in each case.
Total Phenolics. Total phenols in the methanolic extract
were estimated using the Folin-Denis Reagent (Swain and Hillis,
1959).
Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was estimated according
to the method of Zucker (1965).

is shown in Figure 1. Total phenolics content increased
by 3-4-fold during wound healing, reaching maximal levels
on day 8 followed by a gradual decline. Irradiated potatoes
showed lower amounts of phenolics throughout the 17-day
wound healing experiment period.
The rise in phenolic content during wound healing was
accompanied by a parallel increase in phenylalanine
ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity (Figure 2), the first enzyme
of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Irradiated potatoes
consistently showed higher levels of PAL activity than
controls; however, no correlation was observed between
PAL activity and the phenolic content since irradiated
potatoes showed higher levels of PAL activity but recorded
lower amounts of phenolics than control tubers. These
results suggest the possible inhibition of subsequent
enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolics by

irradiation. A study of the first two enzymes involved in
chlorogenic acid biosynthesis in excised potato tuber tissue
by Pendharkar and Nair (1987) has shown that irradiation
impaired the induction of the second, cinnamic acid
4-hydroxylase (CA-4-H) enzyme, but not PAL, the first
enzyme. They found a reduction in chlorogenic acid
synthesis in irradiated potato which was attributed to the
impaired CA-4-H activity. The continued increase in PAL
activity during wound healing observed in our studies using
tuber halves as test systems was quite different from that
reported from potato tissue slices aged in a shallow layer
of buffer solution (Zucker, 1965). In the latter system
PAL activity was reported to peak 24 h after slicing
followed by a steep decline (Zucker, 1965). This points to
the striking effect of variations in experimental condition
on the time course of PAL activity. This may be of
practical significance since experimental systems using
thin tissue may behave altogether differently from
wounded whole tubers under commercial storage condi-
tions or cut tuber pieces which are used as seed material
for planting.
The HPLC separation of a mixture of seven standard
phenolic acids is shown in Figure 3, and the separation of
chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and its isomers
crypto- and neochlorogenic acids (4-0- and 3-O-caffeoyl-
quinic acids, respectively) prepared according to the
method of Nagels et al. (1980) is shown in Figure 4. In our
chromatographic system, both the crypto and neo isomers
were eluted before chlorogenic acid as reported by Brandi
and Herrmann (1983) and Malmberg and Theander (1985).
Typical HPLC separations of phenolic acids from tuber
halves of control and irradiated potatoes allowed to wound-

heal for 8 days are shown in Figure 5. Tentative identi-
fications were made by comparing relative retention times
of the standards with those of the peaks of the potato
extracts. Further, standards for the tentatively identified
peaks and crypto- and neochlorogenic acids prepared
according to the method of Nagels et al. (1980) were then
coinjected with the potato extract to determine whether
a single amplified peak or two peaks resulted. In all cases
single amplified peaks were observed when standards were
coinjected with the potato extract. On this basis six
phenolic acids were tentatively identified, of which the
major constituent was chlorogenic acid followed by its neo
and crypto isomers in that order. Caffeic acid, p-coumaric
acid, and ferulic acid were the other phenolic constituents
detected. Some peaks in the HPLC chromatograms
remained unidentified.
The quantitative results on the pattern of accumulation
of individual phenolic acids during wound healing of
control and irradiated potato tuber halves determined by
HPLC are given in Tables I and II, respectively. In resting
whole tuber of control and irradiated potatoes only chlo-
rogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid
were detected. The content of these acids increased many
fold, reaching maximal levels on the eighth day after
wounding. In addition, synthesis and accumulation of
neo and crypto isomers of chlorogenic acid were noted
during the wound healing process. Chlorogenic acid
accounted for about 56% of the total phenolics, and
together with its neo and crypto isomers comprised 88%
of the phenolics formed in the wound healing tissue.
Although the patterns of accumulation of individual
phenolic acids in control and irradiated potato tuber halves
were identical, major quantitative differences were noted.
A comparison of the levels of various phenolic acids at

different days of wound healing showed significant re-
duction in the content of individual phenolic acids in
irradiated tubers. Thus, after 8 days of wound healing,
when maximal levels of phenolics were recorded, the
contents of chlorogenic acid and total phenolic constituents
as determined by HPLC were 79 and 141 mg for control
compared to 38 and 64 mg for irradiated tubers. A similar
trend is also seen in the total phenolics content determined
according to the Folin-Denis method (Figure 1). Our
results thus point to an impairment of wound-induced
biosynthesis of phenolics in general and chlorogenic acid
in particular by irradiation.
