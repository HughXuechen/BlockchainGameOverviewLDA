Abstract
The research objective is to explore more about anthropomorphic gamifying ele-
ments, mostly on how it can be implemented in a Blockchain-enabled transitional 
healthcare system in a more lucrative manner. Transitional healthcare services 
belong to that person who is suffering from lifelong conditions such as asthma, 
cancer, diabetes, and/or renal transplant. It is necessary to have organized systems, 
and on the same side, we need resources in place to assure that all needy experi-
ence a lucrative healthcare transition.
Anthropomorphic interfaces completely recognized as applying game ele-
ments or logistics into non-gaming contexts such as healthcare, by offering a fun 
and exciting environment. It is observed that there are very few games or web-
based applications suitable to patients practically. Then, there is an interface with 
Blockchain architecture so that we can have health data security as well as motiva-
tion for staying healthy via reward mechanism (i.e., by tokenization of activities).
The conceptual framework is expected to come up with the integration of gam-
ification, anthropomorphism, and Blockchain applications into the transitional 
healthcare system. Further, the output (reward points) from the organized system 
will help in predicting the health conditions of the patients.

18.1 Introduction
The overall provision of healthcare facilities helps in utilizing and achiev-
ing good health and is a sign of a developed country. Since independence, 
we achieved very little or limited progress in the healthcare facilities in 
India. Even though public health centers like hospitals and dispensaries 
are present, they are not capable to cater to the increasing demands of 
India’s tremendous population day by day. In India, the main shortcoming 
of healthcare access depends on three factors such as supply, utility, and 
fulfillment. But, the presence of large gaps among these factors drives it 
to an unused system with unavailable facilities. So, there is an immense 
requirement for healthcare systems to be designed by integrating emerged 
technological innovations to whirl around new models for patient care. 
Hence, this chapter introduces to the readers a new level of understanding 
and practices that offer a distinct improvement in healthcare services by 
acquiring, integrating, analyzing, securing, and exchanging medical data 
at different levels of the healthcare system.
18.1.1 Transitional Healthcare Services and Their Challenges
Recently, transitional healthcare services have emerged to improve the 
quality and minimize the costs under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. 
Transitional healthcare, also called care transition [16], is defined as the 
systematization and continuousness of healthcare during the progress 
either from one healthcare setting to another or home. Care transition 
exists between healthcare specialists and healthcare facilities as their action 
and care demands change during the continuous period of incurable or 
acute illness. 
In other words, transitional healthcare refers to the service which man-
ages one’s health condition, well-acquainted with appropriate knowledge 
to self-reliance, and then shifts them from hospital care to self-care [28]. 
This phenomenon belongs to that person who is suffering from some life-
long conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and/or renal transplants. 
Such prolonged treatment sometimes requires people to transit from one 
healthcare environment to another such as pediatric treatment to adult 
healthcare [42]. Thus, it may be burdensome for such people to sustain 
their engagement in the transition process. For example, an individual suf-
fering from an acute disease at an early age initially needs clinical care, 
and as time passes, the treatment paradigm shifts to the family members.

In due course of time, this mostly gets shifted to self-care. Certainly, such 
a prolonged duration of treatment causes a negative impact on the psycho-
logical health of the individual and other members of the family. It may 
happen even due to various factors such as psychological changes, change 
in the healthcare personnel, and their expertise. Thus, there is a require-
ment for a targeted process that considers the physical and mental status of 
the individuals to deal with the transitional healthcare system.
18.2 Gamification in Transitional Healthcare: 
A New Model
Technology through gamified applications can play a vital role, particu-
larly in transitional healthcare service, through the availability of favorable 
games for patient care, preferably to stimulate mental and physical health. 
Most of all, gamification is always proved to be a powerful tool that engages 
its users at a very high level [47]. Many developers and companies are now 
investing in gamified healthcare systems [40]. Gamification has been pop-
ular in non-game sectors such as business, health, institutions, and trade 
[49]. It positively inspires an individual to a healthy lifestyle through regu-
lar exercise and a healthy diet. Likewise, Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nike Training 
Club, etc., use gadgets to keep track of the health activities and sleep score 
which links to online portals where the game players can track their activi-
ties and manage their lifestyle timely. It focuses on the improvement of the 
patient’s engagement, motivation, and performance while executing a cer-
tain assigned work by incorporating simulator games, to achieve the goal 
in a more lucrative manner [45]. It utilizes game elements and dynamics to 
regulate the way of playing the game and to make routine activities more 
enjoyable and delightful. It also helps in promoting knowledge, learning, 
and behavioral aspects of self-management skills.
In game dynamic progression, we have certain game mechanics like 
achievements, levels, points, badges, trophies, and leaderboards. With 
the intense use of the internet and its applications, the mechanisms for 
delivering healthcare program help in encouraging people to record their 
daily activities in their blogs, uploading photos and videos on social media 
as well as participating in online surveys. There are three game dynam-
ics: progression, feedback, and behavior. Thus, it is high time to add extra 
features like newly emerged Avatar concept into gamification to increase 
health, players’ fun, and excitement.

18.2.1 Anthropomorphic Interface With Gamification
In some of the recent studies, it is evident that interfacing anthropomor-
phic with gamification gives a positive impact on the health of the play-
ers [41]. A human-like representation, similar to Avatar, designed with 
the human traits but is not human in actual, is called Anthropomorphism. 
Anthropomorphic interfaces are popular for applying game elements 
or logistics into non-gaming contexts such as healthcare or education, 
by offering a fun and exciting environment [2]. The avatar, human-like 
representation, is believed to have a positive impact and also provides 
a trustworthy interface to communicate with. Such mechanisms greatly 
motivate and encourage users to sustain their engagement. The usage of 
anthropomorphic agents fulfills dual purposes [7]. Firstly, we can con-
verse (interact) with a virtual agent, and secondly, we can subtly increase 
the automation of tasks. The term “agent” usually refers to a software agent 
that performs a number of activities without any human intervention, i.e., 
highly independent. These agents are in different forms so as to develop 
the look and feel. They are 3D human representation, 3D non-human 
representation (with human-like characteristics), 2D human representa-
tion, and 2D cartoon-like non-human representation (with human-like 
characteristics). 
There are certain advantages of implying an avatar in any research 
work. Firstly, it is much convenient for novice users to understand the 
functioning of the Avatar. Secondly, it is also helpful to grab the user’s 
attention as it is found that people who interacted face to face can give 
more time on an online questionnaire survey and make fewer mistakes, 
unlike text questionnaires. Thirdly, it is also more efficient for us to speak 
questions rather than type them. Fourthly, we, the users do not have to go 
through painful codes and complex functions as these things are handled 
by the agent themselves. Somehow, it is evident that people with disabil-
ities are using avatars as online characters while playing online games 
and the virtual world so as to preserve their anonymity [14]. This helps 
in overcoming the feelings of being different, social isolation, stigma, 
and can survive with long-term medical conditions. Certainly, we have 
already observed and analyzed that the use of gamification is now get-
ting popularity by increasing the process of learning and routine-based 
healthy lifestyle. The addition of Blockchain for distributing reward 
points on the basis of routine-based health activities will be more attrac-
tive toward self-care.

Anthropomorphic Gamifying Blockchain 465
18.2.2 Gamification in Blockchain
Blockchain is defined as a group of blocks that are connected by cryp-
tographic links and contain distinct information in a secured decen-
tralized manner [34]. Technically, it stores records in a tampered proof 
architecture. In 2008, Santoshi Nakamoto invented the Bitcoin protocol 
that remarked the revolution of shifting networking systems from central-
ized to decentralized systems worldwide. In fact, the achievements in this 
field have attracted the attention of academia, as the humanistic issues in 
health and social care are given more priority for further research in the 
Blockchain system and its ecosystem. After the advent of Bitcoin technol-
ogy, Blockchain has influenced the interest of investigators to work on a 
generic technological platform by deploying different kinds of contracts 
[34]. 
Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has the additional functionality of smart 
contracts and, thus, helps in building and deploying decentralized appli-
cations. Smart contracts impose contractual agreement in the software 
and hardware so that the code that runs on Ethereum can control valu-
able digital assets or ETH [25]. It also performs transactions without the 
involvement of stakeholders and, thus, very complicated or expensive for 
the infringer involvement. Ethereum usually runs the smart contract codes 
after depositing transactional fees. Then, EVM executes smart contracts 
written in bytecode (solidity) on every node. After deployment, no one 
can alter the code which not only helps in decreasing transactional fees 
and also handles major risks in case of any faults. Ethereum works on some 
basic understanding of its underlying functionality and its interaction can 
be made by the use of Ethereum wallets, Mist as browsers, and Metamask 
as plugins. However, this platform has not gained wide acceptance among 
users and providers because of which it is difficult to predict the potential 
future applications. 
The Blockchain ecosystem handles the humanistic and remunerative 
issues for the users, leading to unforeseen results in decentralized networks. 
It builds the bond of trust and integrity without any threat of security 
breaches. It is a recent trend to add features such as reward points to game 
apps and websites. Likewise, Metal Token [39], HoToKen1

the Blockchain. These systems are capable to provide the benefits of the 
Blockchain such as security of data records, transparency, immutability, and 
transactions by the use of crypto tokens. This ledger will store Blockchain’s 
assets (in the form of rewards and points) across multiple users. 
Thus, the emergence of Blockchain leads to unprecedented heights for the 
potential of gamification when it comes to online engagement. It is therefore 
valuable to include gamification for healthcare issues in Blockchain technol-
ogy. This integration helps in providing an incentive mechanism for earning 
reward points by the health player and also explores the performance of 
gamifying in a Blockchain system. In the coming years, Blockchain tech-
nology would be an indispensable environment for healthcare provisioning  
[1, 37]. Currently, we are lagging behind in the proper utilization of 
Blockchain technology as a gamified solution due to the lesser availability of 
cryptocurrencies and loyalty programs. Actually, it is a very tedious work to 
keep a patient engaged and motivated. The combined effort of gamification 
and Blockchain technology will make it possible to overcome the problem 
of patient engagement. The later section will explain the factors affecting the 
motivation of patients intrinsically or extrinsically.
18.2.3 Anthropomorphic Gamification in Blockchain: 
Motivational Factors
Anthropomorphic interfaces in the form of Avatars along with gami-
fication helps a health player to increase the motivation or continue the 
engagement while interacting with the application [46]. Integration with 
Blockchain helps in the tokenization of healthcare activities for additional 
enjoyment and fun for the patients. According to the expert’s views, a 
health player can develop a connection with his Avatar role when he fore-
sees his real self in a virtual environment. It is expected that when people 
are motivated, their will power makes them follow their routine-based life-
style or help them to change their behavior or habit at a point of need [43, 
44]. So, we expect a similar transformation that may happen in the transi-
tional healthcare people where their involvement toward their health can 
be improved [48]. To understand the effect of games on motivation [46, 
47], we need to have a look at motivational theories. 
There are several motivational theories that influence health play-
er’s behavior to encourage them for self-care. They are categorized as 
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, ARCS model of motivational design, and self- 
determination theory.

Anthropomorphic Gamifying Blockchain 467
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory [45] states that people’s needs gen-
erally motivate them to perform actions. It is depicted by a hierarchical 
pyramid consisting of five levels. The physiological level is at the lower level 
and self-actualization is at the top level. Whenever the lower-level needs 
(called as deficiency needs) are satisfied before the top-level needs (called 
as growth needs), it may influence the behavior of the person. There are 
some intrinsic motivators (autonomy, mastery, and purpose), and they can 
be influenced by more or fewer satisfaction levels of Maslow’s hierarchy 
of needs [45]. Basically, these intrinsic motivators aim to shape our lives 
(autonomy) by learning and creating new things (mastery) by taking care 
of ourselves (purpose).
In the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) motiva-
tional model [47], these four factors are utilized as a guideline for devel-
oping health player motivation through learning activities. It is important 
because patients should be well-acquainted with their health conditions so 
that they can take care of themselves. Overall, it acts as a problem-solving 
construct where we can recognize and work out those motivational prob-
lems associated with provided instructions. Firstly, Attention is defined to 
capture the interest of patients, stimulate a behavior of queries, and thus 
maintain the patient’s attention. Secondly, Relevance signifies the process 
of achieving the patient’s needs and also their positive attitude toward their 
goals. Thirdly, Confidence refers to build a positive expectation for achieve-
ment, build up patients’ motivation in their competence, and acknowledge 
them about their real efforts and abilities to achieve success. Fourthly, 
Satisfaction defines by reinforcing achievement with reward points and 
also by providing valuable opportunities to patients to use their innovative 
knowledge or skills.
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) was given by Deci [48] and Ryan [49] 
where they discussed the challenges faced in lieu to the psychological need 
of being competent, valid, and autonomous and also to acquire the skill to 
master newly developed things. It is concerned with supporting the inher-
ent potential of human behavior in simple healthy ways. This theory of 
motivation comprises intrinsic tendencies like Competence, Relatedness, 
and Autonomy. Competence can be described as the need to control the 
aftereffect and being a master. Relatedness refers to interaction, connec-
tion, and experience care for others. Autonomy specifies the art of being 
content and integrated with self. Motivation can be classified into extrin-
sic motivation and intrinsic motivation. In extrinsic motivation, patients 
carry out tasks or activities in favor of yielding rewards or benefits upon 
the execution of activities. But, in intrinsic motivation, patients are actually

persistence.
18.3 Existing Related Work 
As we are all aware of advancements in electronic health data, patient data 
protection regulations lead to the opening of new opportunities for the 
revolution of health data as well as easier for accessibility and shareability 
of patient health data. Besides this, serious issues of protection of sensi-
tive health-related data can be solved using Blockchain technology that 
ensures data security and transactions and handles smooth integration 
with the healthcare organization. Many researchers have put forth their 
valuable research findings in the area of anthropomorphism, gamification, 
and Blockchain technology in the transitional healthcare system. We have 
presented related researchers work in the above areas in tabular format for 
exploring preliminary designs ideas quickly and efficiently.

then they have to deal with 
their earned items in game 
play. The strategy of playing 
game is like if there are more 
armaments furnished on the 
virtual player in the game 
play, then they will earn 
more rewards, and hence, 
they are more powerful in 
the play.

478 Machine Learning Approach for Cloud Data Analytics in IoT
18.4 The Framework 
Here, we come up with a conceptual framework (refer Figure 18.1). This 
model consists of two modules. First module explains the working princi-
ple behind the anthropomorphic gamification interface with Blockchain 
technology where generation of tokens (rewards) for every health player 
takes place with the help of smart contracts based on Ethereum platform. 
The anthropomorphic interface with layers of gamification in the archi-
tecture of underlying decentralized applications is the Blockchain’s proof-
of-work (POW) implied on game elements. Second module explains the

predictive model for the health outcomes where reward points are taken 
as an input to evaluate it. By this framework, health players need not have 
to be familiar with the mind wrecking mining process as we are encapsu-
lating the technical details to create a more appealing fun environment 
(Ganache GUI). With the help of this gamified mining, health players can 
earn reward points while doing health-related activities and compare them 
with other health players in the sense of competition among them. These 
reward points are going to decide the health of every player by the use of 
a predictive model, and thus, their focus on attaining better health can be 
achieved. Let us look at the functionalities of the components of the pro-
posed framework. 
18.4.1 Health Player
A health player is a patient with some chronic health issues. A sample size 
of 200 patients’ health data was taken for the analysis of reward points and 
health prediction. We have taken those children and young people who 
suffered from some chronic diseases like, diabetes, asthma, cerebral palsy, 
and cancer.

18.4.2 Data Collection
The data comprises patient demographic details like age, weight, height, 
and also a record of daily activities like kilometer walked, heart rate, exer-
cises, blood pressure, sleep score, and medicines intake. The age of the 
groups varied from the childhood stage, adulthood stage, and old-age 
stage.
18.4.3 Anthropomorphic Gamification Layers 
The goal of anthropomorphic gamification is to make users aware of the 
implications of their healthy lifestyle, promoting them toward healthy 
behavior change, fostering resilience, and increasing motivation to fight 
diseases [6]. As we believe that in gamification, the popular technique 
using game progression rewards, trophies, badges, and points is not meant 
for engaging health players within communities as long as those rewards 
had no authentic assessment values [4]. Rather, it looks like an artificial 
form of achievement. Thus, there is a great requirement for adding authen-
tic value (digital currency) to the points by using tokens. For this, we need 
to create an open standard where tokens are stored on the Blockchain 
so that a group of health players can easily store earned tokens in their 
Ethereum wallets. These tokens can be redeemed in the web store as pay-
ment for access to the health players which helps in creating a sustainable 
token economy and community. But, we know that medical data is always 
considered to be sensitive information and it needs to be protected from 
unapproved access. So, the main challenges of gamification in healthcare 
are patient privacy protection and medical data security. From all points 
of view, we propose Blockchain technology where we use smart contracts 
based on the Ethereum platform for creating unchangeable and safer uti-
lization in the layer. Smart contracts are the building blocks of code that 
execute automatically applying the conditions of the agreement and com-
mercial purpose like the game play in a secured fashion.
18.4.4 Ethereum
Ethereum is an open-source network and nowadays it is popular among 
active users for its Decentralization application (DApp) repository. 
The evolution of Blockchain technology always offers something new 
to our list of needs. This is possible due to consensus algorithms that 
make the Blockchain consensus sequence from each other. These algo-
rithms are helping in making the majority group decision to include or

support a new individual to join in that particular group by the voting 
mechanism. Presently, the Ethereum platform makes use of POW con-
sensus algorithm. POW is important for security which prevents fraud 
and enables trust. But, it requires all nodes to participate in the trans-
action for the validation of new nodes on the network. Also, there are 
certain issues with it like greater computation power is required, and 
pure decentralization is not achieved. Ideally, the decentralization appli-
cation tends to recognize insertion anomalies, update anomalies, and 
missing attributes on the ledger records. It is done by the main elements 
of the smart contract that are written in Solidity. For the deployment of 
the smart contracts, we go for the Remix network (or Kovan network), 
and to deploy on testnet ethers, we need to pay with gas. Paying with gas 
is required to reduce the usage of computation power and also time to 
execute the transactions. Sometimes, malicious operators and complex 
contracts may lead to an infinite loop on the server-side. These payable 
transaction fees are usually decided by the willingness of the users for 
each unit of gas.
18.4.4.1 Ethereum-Based Smart Contracts for Healthcare 
Smart contracts based on Ethereum platform was coined by “Nick Szabo” 
in 1993. It is a state machine and needs transactions to change the state 
through the mining process. It can do logical operations as well. In a gen-
eral term, it is used for protecting information written in Solidity which is 
in a high-level programming language, and then, it is compiled into “byte-
code”, known as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Then, this contract is 
executed by all participating nodes by the use of their Ethereum Virtual 
Machines. Thus, every node holds a copy of the transaction along with 
its history on the peer-to-peer network. It also maintains the track of the 
current “state” so that every activity performed by the health player can be 
utilized to earn reward points. Hence, the EVM finishes the execution of a 
contract with its regulations that are introduced by the developer. 
18.4.4.2 Installation of Ethereum Smart Contract
The following are the steps to install Private Blockchain Network:
1. First of all, we install NodeJS for providing javascript envi-
ronment that is web3.
2. Then, we install Geth terminal where we write entire com-
mand in Go Language.

3. After that we install Git terminal window just like Linux.
4. Further, we install Ethereum Wallet (stores and manages 
Ethereum accounts and transactions) or Metamask wallet 
(an extension where to transfer and deposit ethers).
18.4.5 Reward Model
The reward model is used to buffer the reward points that are evaluated 
on the basis of daily healthcare activities. It works on the basis of the 
push-based flow method to distribute rewards to all the health players 
accordingly. This method computes rewards per hour spent in performing 
activities and operating on-chain computational overhead to a significant 
extent. It can handle more number of health players at a given instant t, 
where active health players are engaged in doing healthcare activities, let 
us say for doing exercises and taking medicines, create distribute events in 
a given timeline T. For every health player,
 
totalreward sum reward activities sum reward
Tj t jt j t
t
= = ∗
 
that is, total reward for every health patient is calculated on the basis of 
their routine-based healthcare activities in given timeline order and these 
rewards are stored in a table in chronological order which is further used 
in the predictive model. 
18.4.6 Predictive Models
There exist many efficient and affordable predictive models because of 
the increase in the running capacity of thousands of models on multiple 
cores. What matters is the suitability of the predictive model for a given 
input dataset. So, it totally depends on the desirable nature of the predic-
tive target. We have taken different machine learning algorithms to design 
a model. They are linear regression, logistic regression, support vector 
machine (SVM), artificial neural networks, etc.; the different machine 
algorithms work on different nature of data. Linear regression is used when 
we want to predict continuous values. Logistic regression is considered to 
be a more powerful statistical way of modeling a binomial result with one 
or more descriptive variables. It estimates the relationship between the 
categorical dependent variable by the use of the logistic function. Next is 
the SVM that can be used for binary classification and also for multi-class

classification indirectly. It can be used for both linear and non-linear deci-
sion boundaries. The last one is an artificial neural network that can be 
used for multi-class classification and non-linear decision boundaries. The 
implementation of our chosen model depends on the best accuracy pro-
vider for the prediction of the health of the patients.
18.5 Implementation 
This section gives a clear picture of our research tasks and of the processes 
through which our conceptual framework validates the goal of our research 
work. It explains the purpose of our research and the methodology behind 
it and, finally, assesses the reliability of our findings in the result analysis 
section.
18.5.1 Methodology
Initially, a health player with his avatar role participates in the game app 
and gives challenges by doing healthcare activities and then updates the 
records by the use of a tracker. The health player is initially given vari-
able tokens. Then, the smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform 
compute rewards points (token) by the application of logical operations. 
Every activity performed results in the creation of tokens that is regarded 
as reward points. These reward points are computed based on the afore-
mentioned formula in the reward model (refer Section 18.4.5). Those 
health players who are sincerely participate in the game play and perform 
every activity thoroughly gather the maximum reward points. These stored 
reward points of respective health players are further used for the analysis 
of health predictions.
Generally, predictive model comprised of different stages that include 
preparation of data, quality of data, reduction, simulation, prediction, and 
result analysis. At the first stage, we apply Principal component analysis 
(PCA) technique on our dataset. PCA method is an unsupervised machine 
learning algorithm which is used to reduce the number of features describ-
ing our dataset. Apart from this, the PCA method reduces the dimension-
ality with the motive of retaining information as much as possible. Next, 
at the second stage, we perform the transformation, center, and scaling 
feature on the test set as well. We compare logistic regression and SVM 
models based on their better accuracy. Thereafter, in the third stage, we 
select the appropriate ML model with the best accuracy for the health pre-
diction of the patients.

18.5.2 Result Analysis
Before we begin with our health dataset, firstly, we need to think about the 
environment to deploy our smart contracts. We would like to use a local 
Blockchain that runs on our machine, requires no internet access, and most 
importantly provides all the Ethers that we need and mines block instantly. 
Hence, we have opted for Ganache as a local Blockchain. Here, we can see 
a list of accounts with their respective address, Ether balance, and other 
relative information (refer Figure 18.2). Accounts with their addresses are 
actually used for interacting with this Blockchain, and also, we have the list 
of transactions done in the local network (refer Figure 18.3). 
We can have a visualization of the transaction in the Ganache GUI. 
Then, Web3JS is used to send the data block to the chain after the vali-
dation of the transaction is done. The stored reward table is then used by 
a predictive model. PCA (refer Figure 18.4) is used for feature reduction 
by extracting the important ones from a large pool. We have graphically 
represented a heat map of the correlation of features. Figure 18.5 shows the 
performance of different ML algorithms like logistic regression and SVM.
The performance of the logistic and SVM models is evaluated based on 
four factors: F1-score, recall, precision, and accuracy that are represented 
in the below figure (refer Figures 18.5A and B). F1-score is even more suit-
able for imbalanced class distribution and is more preferable than accu-
racy to evaluate the models. Next is precision which tells about the relevant 
output and recall shows whether the output is correctly classified. Thus,

logistic regression performs better than SVM in terms of four factors (refer 
Figures 18.5A and B). 
The ROC curve (refer Figure 18.5C) for logistic regression helps in 
determining the best cutoff value for predicting whether a new observation 
is a “failure” or a success. As given in the figure, an AUC of 0.83 suggests 
excellent ability to predict patient health status. Logistic regression is con-
sidered to be better because of its 79% accuracy which is quite considerable

for our proposed model. It can be concluded that the logistic regression 
model is better suited for the prediction of the health status of the patient. 
18.5.3 Threats to the Validity 
Just as every coin has two sides; the proposed framework has also its lim-
itations. One of the major issues with Ethereum is scalability; each smart 
contract and transaction has to regulate every node to be processed in the 
network before being validated. In terms of speed also, Ethereum limits 
15 transactions per second and 1 million transactions per day as its full 
capacity, which clearly shows its limit.
Because of the scalability issue in Ethereum, researchers are working on 
EOS which can scale to millions of transactions per second. This would 
make it possible to raise the bar in handling the real-world application. 
Thus, EOS can help to revolutionize the healthcare industry into the most 
scalable Blockchain network.

Anthropomorphic Gamifying Blockchain 487
18.6 Conclusion
This chapter introduced the fundamental of anthropomorphism that can 
be interfaced with gamification for better help to transitional healthcare 
patients. An implementation of the Ethereum Blockchain gamification 
with incentive mechanism is shown that engages and motivates health 
players to take care of their health in a lucrative manner. We have shown 
experimental results of the transaction of nodes while computing rewards 
to healthcare players. Further, we have shown the performance of selective 
predictive models in the prediction of the health outcome of any patient.
