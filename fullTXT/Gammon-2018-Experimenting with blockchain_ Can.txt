are paid in LifePounds to lease all kinds 
of information to companies for a certain 
amount of time. 
Longenesis isn’t alone in this idea: Nebula 
Genomics, a Cambridge, Massachusetts–
based startup cofounded by George Church, 
aims to use blockchain to allow individuals 
to sell access to their entire genome for 
a cryptocurrency called Nebula tokens. 
Individuals who do not yet have their 
genome sequenced can take paid surveys 
about their health conditions. If companies 
are interested in their genomic information, 
those companies can subsidize the cost of 
genome sequencing. Another system known 
as MedRec that uses blockchain for sharing 
health records is slated for testing later 
this year at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center in Boston. Even governments have 
brand of cryptocurrency, a new form of 
digital currency that operates without a 
bank. The government, as well as private 
companies and drug developers aiming to 
develop drugs and antiaging products, can 
buy the data linked to the currency through 
the Longenesis marketplace. 
Ojomoko is a Blockchain AI program 
manager at Longenesis, a decentralized 
medical record marketplace for life data 
like medical records and health data. 
The platform, which is being used by 
employees and will open to the public  
in spring 2018, allows individuals to 
store and monetize their own health data, 
including blood test results, medical 
history, genetic profile and other sensitive 
information, in a blockchain-based 
marketplace. In the marketplace, people

Lucy Ojomoko eyes her selfie. She is young, 
tall and slender, and her dark hair is pulled 
back in a ponytail. She clicks ‘upload’ and 
waits. Her picture is soon accepted to 
the system she helped to create, and five 
LifePounds are deposited in her online 
account. 
While she waits for the LifePounds to 
deposit, she clicks through to add her 
current health information—height, weight, 
blood pressure, resting pulse—and adds 
updated data in these fields. More sensitive 
information, like blood tests or pictures 
of her skin, face, back or chest, earn more 
LifePounds. The company says that their 
digital currency can eventually be traded 
for discounts on health tests or products like 
toothpaste and shampoo—and exchanged 
for cold, hard cash. The LifePound is a

a clinical trial, even if those patients were 
not actively searching to participate in 
a clinical trial for a product from which 
they might benefit. Patients could be 
prompted based on their data (which are 
anonymized) to join the trial, thereby also 
accelerating the process and accuracy of trial 
recruitment, says Milind Kamkolkar, chief 
data officer at Sanofi. If they decline, no 
personal information has been shared and 
the person’s identity remains private. If they 
agree, the overall process would move faster 
by abolishing the need for intermediaries.
For pharma companies, better inclusion 
in clinical trials and better reproducibility 
for studies can reduce the time and money 
needed to develop new drugs. Part of the 
challenge that these companies face is 
that health information is scattered across 
multiple systems, paper or digital, creating 
huge data silos, Kamkolkar says.
Additionally, pharmaceutical companies, 
including Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi, have 
expressed interest in blockchain’s qualities 
for ensuring the accuracy of and safeguarding 
data. Companies are looking for ways to 
improve pharmaceutical supply chain 
management, tracking, for example, the 
provenance of pharmaceuticals. Counterfeit 
drugs cost pharmaceutical companies $200 
billion each year.  Blockchain could track 
the chain of custody for drugs through the 
supply chain and establish new ways to 
maintain drug integrity and veracity.
Patient protection
Because health data managed with 
blockchain startups are stored on a 
decentralized network, there is no single 
institution that can be 
robbed or hacked to 
obtain a large number 
of patient records. That 
is important because, 
when researchers are 
dealing with institutions 
that might compete for 
patients to include in 
studies, it might not be 
easy to cede authority 
to one institution over another, Ohno-
Machado says. This built-in security is a 
way a blockchain-backed health information 
marketplace has the potential to change 
clinical science, she adds.
Blockchain companies are cropping 
up everywhere. In addition to Nebula 
Genomics, there is also Luna DNA, a 
company that asks people to upload genetic 
information and receive Luna Coins when 
a really important new tool in our arsenal,” 
says Ohno-Machado. “If done correctly, 
derivatives of blockchain technology can 
solve issues around patient privacy and data 
sharing.” 
Pharma’s chain reaction
The potential for blockchain to change 
biomedical research is not lost on the 
pharmaceutical industry, and companies 
are already starting to use blockchain. In 
February, the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) held the first 
international conference on blockchain 
and clinical trials, with sessions focused 
on topics such as increasing clinical 
research integrity and 
integrating blockchain 
into medical records. 
Meanwhile, a study 
from  IBM published 
in 2016 showed that 
16% of healthcare 
executives planned 
to put a commercial 
blockchain solution in 
place by last year, and 
56% expect to do so by 2020 (ref. 1). IBM’s 
own Watson Health artificial intelligence 
(AI) unit recently signed a two-year joint-
development agreement with the US 
Food and Drug Administration to explore 
using blockchain tech to securely share 
patient data for medical research and other 
purposes. 
Blockchain could help pharma companies 
discover patients with the right profile for 
got on board with the blockchain approach: 
in 2017, the Estonian e-Health authority 
implemented a blockchain solution enabling 
storage of a million health records, letting 
patients control data access through a 
special keyless signature infrastructure, 
making them the first government in the 
world to do so. 
The blockchain technology on which 
these endeavors rely was created in 2008 
for users to buy and sell the cryptocurrency 
bitcoin, as its public transaction ledger. The 
technology was the brainchild of Satoshi 
Nakamoto, a much-debated pseudonym 
that may stand for a group of people. In 
recent years, Bitcoin has upended the 
financial world. But the power of blockchain 
technology can go far beyond the world of 
finance. 
Part of the power of blockchain rests in 
the fact that it is a huge, public, secure and 
decentralized store of ordered records or 
events. Each of these records, or ‘blocks’, 
contains a cryptographic hash of the prior 
block in the chain, indelibly linking the two. 
Information cannot be erased. The dataset is 
owned by no one, is controlled by users and 
is not ruled by central regulatory instance. 
Trust is encoded in the protocol through 
a complex cryptographic algorithm and 
maintained by the community of users. 
As long as everyone agrees on the rules 
of engagement, participants can choose how 
much to engage, without having a central 
authority, says Lucila Ohno-Machado, a 
professor of biomedical informatics at the 
University of California, San Diego. “This is

Ojomoko echoes this notion that 
blockchain upends the flow of patient 
data, putting patients, who can financially 
profit directly, in the driver’s seat. “It’s an 
ecosystem built around the individual,” 
Ojomoko says. 
Selling your data
Personal and health data are already being 
collected, sold and used in ways patients 
probably don’t even know about, says Bonnie 
Kaplan, a bioethicist at the Yale Center for 
Medical Informatics. “What’s different in 
initiatives like Longenesis and other similar 
marketplaces is that the data sale is explicit and 
you at least have some control and could get 
some financial benefit from data about you.” 
Kaplan adds that health data marketplaces 
give some autonomy: they let patients 
curate data about themselves and decide 
which of those data to sell and where to sell 
them. “Having this control and financial 
benefit is good but comes with taking on 
responsibility for making decisions and 
assessing risks,” she says. 
Some of the ideas for the future of 
blockchain in healthcare are controversial. 
Zhavoronkov suggests that, in resource-
poor countries, leasing out health data could 
serve as a way to introduce a ‘universal basic 
income’, which describes the idea of giving 
a basic living stipend to all members of a 
society. “People could take medical tests 
[and] license their data” for this steady 
income, he says. 
Mark Rothstein, director of the Institute 
for Bioethics, Health Policy and Law at the 
University of Louisville School of Medicine, 
says that could be problematic. “In many 
low-income countries the health records 
are of poor quality and not suitable for 
research and therefore the main asset would 
be biospecimens in a national or federated 
biobank,” he says, adding that in many 
countries it’s unlawful to export information 
about specimens without the involvement of 
a local investigator in the research.
Iraneus Obioma Ogu, a researcher with 
the Africa Blockchain Artificial Intelligence 
for Healthcare Initiative (Ogu consults for 
Longenesis), looks to Africa when he talks 
about the future of blockchain. In many 
regions of the continent, Ogu says, people 
don’t realize the value of data, especially 
personal data. “It’s a continent with a large, 
young population and a rate of internet 
penetration that is increasing exponentially,” 
he says. That makes Africa a potentially 
huge market for mining data and paying 
participants to use their information. 
when Ojomoko uploads her photos and 
blood work into the Longenesis system, she 
ultimately has control over who can access 
the data. 
The Longenesis vision is a collaboration 
between the AI-based drug development 
company Insi l ico 
Medicine and the 
blockchain mining 
company the Bitfury 
Group. Their plan is to 
pay people to hand over 
their data—everything 
from pictures to height, 
weight, bloodwork, 
diseases, MRIs and 
CT scans, and the 
marketplace for others 
to lease the data is set to 
open in spring of 2018, with a full launch in 
2020. The company is starting by working 
with healthcare providers. Pictures can carry 
enormous amounts of information, says 
Zhavoronkov. “People think their genomes 
carry a lot of info,” he says. “But with a 
picture, you can predict someone’s age—you 
can’t do that with a genome.” Longenesis will 
charge a fee to guarantee the data are valid 
and annotated, which they will do using AI. 
“Simply put,  blockchain  is a software 
that enables value transfer,” says Hilary 
Carter, director of faculty at the Blockchain 
Research Institute, a Toronto-based 
nonprofit think tank that researches 
the impact of blockchain technology on 
government, business and society. 
they allow researchers to have access. 
Another company, EncrypGen, has a 
similar plan to use metadata about the actual 
genome.
“This is the Wild West, and a lot of new 
efforts will fail,” says Alex Zhavoronkov, CEO 
of medical AI company 
Insilico Medicine, which 
together with blockchain 
tech company BitFury, 
created Longenesis. “It’s 
very much like the dot-
com boom of 2000 and 
2001 in this area.” 
These companies are 
all using a simple tool to 
help people control their 
data: smart contracts. 
A smart contract 
is an automated way to get something 
done—the idea calls to mind technology 
as straightforward as a vending machine 
or thermostat. In the future, doctors can 
prescribe the use of devices like Fitbit for 
improving personal health. Smart contracts 
can be implemented on personal fitness 
data: if you walk so many steps and your 
health improves, you could get an automatic 
reward after a visit to the doctor. 
Within Longenesis, Ojomoko says users 
will be able to create smart contracts for 
leasing out data—say, to a company—and 
getting them back after a certain amount 
of time. Users could choose to re-up their 
contract with the same company or lease 
out the data to a new firm. As a result,

exaggerated6. Blockchain could potentially 
address this, according to Benchoufi, who 
also imagines a network of clinical trials 
where results are easily compiled, making 
meta-analyses simpler to conduct. 
Blockchain does have some powerful 
hurdles to overcome before it gets widely 
adopted. For one, it is energy intensive to 
create cryptocurrency and move it around. 
The Digiconomist, a website that covers 
cryptocurrency fraud and risk mitigation, 
estimates that if Bitcoin—the world’s most 
accepted and valued cryptocurrency—were 
a country it would use about as much energy 
as Algeria.
One other issue is nagging blockchain 
in science: user authentication. It’s easy 
to authenticate the user when someone 
is meeting with their doctor, but there 
are concerns that people might upload 
phony data to the system to make money, 
Benchoufi says. And regulations that govern 
the ownership of patient health records 
also may arrest the adoption of blockchain 
systems by governments. 
Because of these regulations, Benchoufi 
thinks blockchain 
will benefit scientists 
trying to increase 
reproducibility before it 
benefits patients looking 
to share health data for 
profit. Still, people have 
historically volunteered 
their data for clinical 
trials and received 
nothing in return for it. 
At least marketplaces 
allow patients to build 
a better society and 
potentially get some cash 
for doing so. “As we see 
more jobs taken over by 
AI, there will be a lot of people who need 
to rethink their careers and their lives,” 
Zhavoronkov says. He sees society starting 
to shift from manual labor and generating 
capital to a new place: “You can’t go wrong 
with advancing society through an economy 
driven by health.”

the IEEE workstream on blockchain and 
clinical trial consent. 
Using blockchain, a researcher can track 
each piece of data, with a cryptographic 
validation of each transaction. In 
addition, each bit of 
data is recorded in 
chronological order, 
and this information 
is publicly available to 
anyone with access to 
the chain. Benchoufi 
says that this feature 
can help prevent typical 
issues related to clinical 
trial protocols, such 
as selective reporting 
of outcomes related to 
harm, under-reporting 
of  nonsignif icant 
o u t c o m e s  a n d 
mismatches between 
planned outcomes in the protocol and final 
publication.
“When you publish your paper, a 
publisher could take the whole trial and 
compile it, just like software,” he says. “And 
they could confirm all data were recorded in 
the correct order, every event happened in 
the way the authors said.” 
The immutability of blockchain may also 
be a novel way to get around one of science’s 
most thorny problems: reproducibility. In 
2005, Stanford researcher John Ioannidis 
estimated that more than 20% of clinical 
trials are not reproducible4. That number 
has climbed, with a 2014 essay estimating 
that 85% of research resources are wasted, 
mostly owing to findings being false or 
In addition to providing income to people 
who let the system know everything from 
their food intake to their sun exposure, 
Ogu suggests the Longenesis marketplace 
could also be a way to open doors to drug 
development in parts of Africa and other 
places companies may not consider first. 
Mining the data will make it easier for 
companies to develop medications that 
help groups of people who are sometimes 
overlooked, Ogu suggests. 
Sifting through people’s data, companies 
can put together more effective drug 
trials because they can find the exact 
people they’re looking for. Blockchain is 
yet another way to personalize medicine, 
Ojomoko adds. 
In some low- and middle-income 
countries, however, participaton in clinical 
trials is the only opportunity for gaining 
access to medical care2. The question of 
whether payment for personal health data 
from populations for clinical trials with 
blockchain would be a form of economic 
coercion to become research participants 
remains an open question3.
The promise of traceability
Pharmaceutical companies are interested 
in automating more trials through 
blockchain because it can help them show 
the exact, inviolable history of the data. “Big 
companies have to protect themselves—
when they are accused of this or that, they 
have a strong way to say, no, these are the 
data,” says Mehdi Benchoufi, a medical 
researcher at the Hospital Hôtel Dieu in 
Paris, who published a paper last year on 
blockchain and clinical trials4 and is leading
