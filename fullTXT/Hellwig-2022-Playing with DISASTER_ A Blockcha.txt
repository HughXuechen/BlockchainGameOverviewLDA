Shortages and the Competition for Scarce
Resources

Abstract This chapter explores the potential of distributed ledger technology
(DLT) in addressing supply chain shortages and competition for scarce resources.
Specifically, we assess the effect of strategic information sharing on supply chain
efficiency and the creation of virtual markets to improve supply chain performance.
To facilitate this research, we designed a simulation platform called DISASTER
(DLT In Sourcing And Strategic Trading Experimental Research), which hosts web-
based, dynamic, and customizable supply chain simulations that leverage concepts
of blockchain technology, and permit capturing of information regarding players’
ordering strategies and behavioral traits.
In this chapter, we describe the DISASTER platform and discuss two selected
DISASTER simulations that probe supply chain retailers’ order behavior: the first
investigates the role of information sharing among competing retailers; the second
allows for the trading of tokens among competing retailers. In the first simulation,
we find that decision makers act more strategically and closer to Nash equilibrium
predictions as more information about historical orders of competitors is shared;
however, the observed outcome is not invariably an improvement in efficiency as
measured by profits across participants. In the second simulation, we observe that
initial order quantities remain unchanged as compared to the baseline (non-trading)
scenario, despite the possibility to trade on virtual markets; however, over time,
more equitable distribution of inventory is achieved, and the supply chain efficiency
as measured by profits increases.
Our findings highlight the value of empirical research and management games in
shedding light on the role of decision makers’ behavioral characteristics and inves-

1 Introduction
In a business-as-usual state of the world, supply chains are not typically the center
of top-management and popular media attention. However, a stream of recent crises
has changed that. The scope, intensity, and duration of supply chain problems are
unprecedented and pervasive: shortages, delays, higher prices, and panic buying
have affected numerous industries. To list just a few examples, in 2020 and 2021, the
world experienced shortages of medical ventilators, personal protective equipment,
toilet paper, baker’s yeast, pasta, lumber, furniture, pet food, and toys. Consequences
of the global microchip shortage are still accruing, but the automotive industry
estimates that 2–3 million fewer vehicles were produced in 2021—a total sales loss
of $210 billion (AlixPartners 2021; WEF 2021).
Although the centrality of supply chain operations has become increasingly
salient to the broader public only recently, the operations management (OM) aca-
demic community and practitioners have long argued that supply chain management
constitutes a decisive factor in business success (Cohen and Lee 2020). In particular,
understanding the value of information sharing has long been a focus of OM
research. In the context of the bullwhip effect (BWE), or the demand distortion that
travels upstream in supply chains, theoretical and empirical OM literature has shown
that sharing demand information can be valuable in reducing the BWE stemming
from signal processing causes and in improving supply chain performance (Cohen
and Kouvelis 2020). In a similar context, Morris Cohen and colleagues Terwiesch
et al. (2005) and Ren et al. (2009) explore the effects on supply chain performance
of buyers and sellers being given unreliable information.
Extending ideas in Babich and Hilary (2019, 2020, 2022) and Hellwig et al.
(2020), we argue that distributed ledger technology (DLT), specifically, blockchain,
can facilitate both the trustless sharing of information in supply chains and the
creation of virtual markets to enable a more efficient allocation of scarce supplies.
First, blockchain is designed to allow for information sharing among multiple
parties while ensuring both trustworthiness and (if needed) anonymity, thereby
mitigating key concerns that have thus far limited the willingness of supply chain
stakeholders to partake in information sharing. Second, blockchain enables the
creation of digital tokens, which can represent unique and secure digital claims on
assets and capacities in supply chains. Such tokens enable virtual markets in which
supply chain resources can be traded. While the theory and practice of economics
and finance highlight the role of markets in achieving efficient resource allocation,
suchmarkets have yet to be created and established for all products that flow through
Playing with DISASTER: A Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Simulation. . . 171
supply chains. Indeed, the volume for some products is not sufficient for traditional
financial intermediaries to operate respective markets. By eliminating the need for
financial intermediaries, blockchain technology can reduce the setup costs for such
markets, thus helping to establish markets for less liquid assets. This will allow
for the trading of supply chain inventory, thereby yielding a better match between
demand and supply in dynamic systems.
To facilitate the investigation of the role of trustless information sharing in supply
chains and the creation of virtual markets to improve supply chain performance, we
designed a supply chain simulation platform called Distributed ledger technology
In Sourcing And Strategic Trading Experience Research (DISASTER). In addition
to behavioral experiments, the platform enables classroom and industry learning
experiences about challenges arising in real-life supply chain and exploration of the
benefits of adopting blockchain technology. Note that it is the concepts rather than
the technology of blockchain and digital tokens that are applied in the simulation;
nonetheless the functionalities embedded capture key features of how such markets
could operate based on blockchain technology in a practical setting.
In this chapter, we describe the DISASTER platform and illustrate its use with
two simulations: (i) information sharing among retailers competing for scarce
supply and (ii) trading tokens on supplier’s capacity between retailers when facing
demand uncertainty. In the first simulation, we find that sharing selective competi-
tive information may leave the supply chain worse off; this result is counterintuitive,
as supply chain managers are expected to prefer more to less information. In
the second simulation, our results demonstrate that initial orders to the supplier
remain largely unchanged despite the possibility to trade on virtual markets. This
is a surprising finding when compared to the empirical evidence provided by the
transshipment literature, which shows that when inventory can be exchanged, post
demand realization, orders tend to regress to the mean demand (Katok and Villa
2021). In addition, more than 30% improvement in the evenness of inventory
distribution, namely fewer instances of shortages or excess inventory, is achieved,
thereby increasing overall supply chain profit by over 20%.
Hereafter, the chapter is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we introduce the BWE
and the role of sharing information about competitors’ past orders and blockchain
technology in ameliorating supply chain disruptions. Section 3 describes how the
virtual markets enabled by blockchain technology can mitigate mismatches between
supply and demand. In Sect. 4, we introduce our newly developed platform and
illustrate its use with results from two simulation games, and conclude in Sect. 5
with a summary of our contributions and main findings.
2 The Bullwhip Effect and Information Sharing
The BWE describes the phenomenon of greater variance in orders that a company
places, as compared with the variance in demand that the company observes. Thus,
uncertainty about orders tends to increase as one moves upstream in the supply
172 D. Hellwig et al.
chain (Lee et al. 1997), making it more difficult to manage supply chains and rising
costs. Lee et al. (1997) authored a seminal paper that explains the causes of the
BWE and proposes solutions. The authors identified four causes of the BWE: (i)
demand signal processing, (ii) rationing games, (iii) order batching, and (iv) price
variation. For instance, Baganha and Cohen (1998) discuss empirical observations
and results from management games that illustrate the BWE and identify sufficient
conditions for multi-echelon inventory policies to reduce this effect. An extensive
literature follows this work; for a review, see Wang and Disney (2016).
The management game typically used to illustrate the BWE is the Beer Distri-
bution Game, invented in 1960 by Jay Wright Forrester at MIT and analyzed in
detail by Sterman (1989b). This game models operations of a serial supply chain
in which, unlike the retailer, players representing other companies (wholesaler,
manufacturer, and supplier) have no knowledge of final consumer demand and,
moreover, are unable to coordinate their actions with each other—even though their
objective is to minimize the total supply chain cost. The Beer Distribution Game is
a popular teaching tool and exists in many incarnations; however, it does not permit
the analysis of causes of the bullwhip effect that can arise only in non-serial supply
chains, such as shortage gaming, which arises when a supplier must decide how
to allocate scarce supply among buyers who attempt to manipulate the supplier’s
decision through their orders. Shortage gaming leads to irrational ordering and
buying behaviors and has frequently been observed in global supply chains during
the COVID-19 pandemic; the platform we created focuses on that aspect of the
BWE.
2.1 Shortage Gaming
Supplier’s allocation rules have been extensively researched from a theoretical
perspective. For example, Cohen et al. (1986) analyze the optimal order and
allocation policies for a multi-echelon inventory system; however, they do not
directly link their results to shortages. In subsequent research, Cachon and Lariviere
(1999) focus on shortages and show that, in equilibrium, if supply is scarce—and
suppliers use the proportional allocation rule—then retailers inflate orders as much
as possible.
Experimental research reports human behavior, which can contribute substan-
tially to the BWE, that differs appreciably from theory (Chen et al. 2012; Cui
and Zhang 2018). For instance, Croson and Donohue (2006) demonstrate that
supply chain inefficiencies, such as the BWE, are present even when operational
issues such as supply shortage, demand estimation, and price variation have been
eliminated, the reason being that decision makers’ suboptimal behavior can be a
major driver of suboptimal supply chain performance. In this context, a wide range
of behavioral characteristics—divergence in cultural norms, cognitive capacity, and
risk preferences as well as biases such as anchoring—have been identified in the
field of OM (for an overview, see, e.g., Katok et al. 2018; Fahimnia et al. 2019).
Playing with DISASTER: A Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Simulation. . . 173
At the same time, managers tasked with decision-making, especially in crisis
situations such as facing supply shortages, tend to favor the availability of informa-
tion because it enables them to calibrate their actions more appropriately. Along
these lines, the existing literature stresses that sharing information can facilitate
both reducing the BWE and improving supply chain performance (Lotfi et al. 2013;
Cohen and Kouvelis 2020). It is noteworthy that the behaviors inducing volatility
across supply chains (e.g., decision bias and over-reaction to fluctuations) are also
dampened via information-sharing initiatives (Croson and Donohue 2006).
Despite these advantages of information sharing that have been identified in the
literature, most practical approaches to alleviating information distortion have been
met with limited success, largely because of the desire to maintain a competitive
advantage, confidentiality concerns, and questions about the reliability, accuracy,
and timing of available information (Lotfi et al. 2013). We propose that blockchain
technology can address these concerns and thus facilitate the sharing of information.
2.2 How Blockchain Can Help
It is common for organizations to operate their own information technology (IT)
systems, which do not directly interface with the IT systems of other companies.
Posting data on public outlets raises concerns about sharing strategic secrets,
violating customers’ privacy, and losing control over the use of that data. In addition,
leveraging such data is complicated by reservations regarding their availability and
validity, which can arise either from initially incorrect records or from hacking and
data manipulation after the fact.
Blockchain technology facilitates the decentralized sharing of information with
multiple parties (Hellwig et al. 2020). Tamper-proof permanent recording of
data on the blockchain ensures trustworthiness: records cannot be altered, and
participants can remain anonymous. The cryptographicmechanisms incorporated in
the blockchain protocol help protect this anonymity while simultaneously allowing
building a reputation based on participants’ behaviors. In addition, fully homo-
morphic encryption (FHE), which can be added to blockchain solutions, makes it
possible to perform computations on encrypted records. This feature enables the
derivation of summary statistics from encrypted data which, when decrypted, will
match the result as if they had been performed on the non-encrypted data in the
first place (Hellwig and Huchzermeier 2022). For instance, the average aggregated
data from a group of supply chain parties can be shared without revealing any
information about the individual stakeholders to their competition.
These prospects have motivated scholars to investigate the potential of infor-
mation sharing that leverages blockchain technology to improve supply chain
performance (Babich and Hilary 2019). For instance, van Engelenburg et al. (2018)
propose a conceptual blockchain architecture to reduce information asymmetry,
thereby reducing the BWE while protecting sensitive data. Xue et al. (2020)
similarly describe a decentralized blockchain-driven supply chain design to address
174 D. Hellwig et al.
those untimely and distorted information exchanges that can lead to increased order
variance.
Given the advantages offered by blockchain, we hypothesize that using this
technology to record and share selected information can improve supply chain
performance and reduce the BWE’s adverse consequences due to competition
among retailers for scarce supply. To assess this proposal, we introduce the supply
chain simulation game Information sharing among competitors, which is hosted on
our DISASTER platform (Sect. 4.2.1).
3 Virtual Markets
3.1 Market Economics
Matching supply with demand is a challenge that prevails across industries. Even if
ample supply is available upstream, stock-outs can occur at the local level because
of demand variations and the unequal distribution of inventory. The significance
of this issue is amplified when the supply shortages have severe implications. For
example, pacemaker producers are scrambling for inventory and seeking priority
over other industries in receiving microchips, amidst a global supply shortage of
those components, to ensure continued production of their products (Roland 2021).
Markets that facilitate the efficient allocation of resources exist for only a select
set of commodities; they do not exist for most goods in supply chains, although
there are some approximate solutions: such as pooling inventory in one location
and transshipments. Inventory pooling is however usually managed by a central
planner in a supply chain, and transshipment strategies are typically restricted—vis-
à-vis resolving the mismatch between demand and supply—by terms established
prior to the realization of random shocks. Other disadvantages of transshipments,
relative to inventory pooling are (i) inefficient operations due to double inventory
handling and its accompanying risks, greater lead times, and higher costs; (ii)
extensive coordination requirements between shipping and receiving parties; and
(iii) the required disclosure of competitive information (e.g., inventory levels). OM
research on both topics is voluminous (e.g., for inventory pooling, see Federgruen
and Zipkin 1984; Cohen et al. 1986; Deshpande et al. 2003; for transshipments, see
Tagaras and Cohen 1992; Rudi et al. 2001; Katok and Villa 2021).
Markets present an opportunity to inject the efficiency of centralized inventory
pooling into decentralized supply chain systems. For some products, however, the
financial intermediaries that organize commodity exchanges do not find the scale of
supply chains large enough to justify the fixed costs of creating and operating such
markets. This is where a technology solution, such as blockchain, may be of value.
Key questions that arise in this context include how much value such markets can
create within the confines of individual supply chains and how will these markets
affect incentives and investments as well as physical, financial, and informational
flows.

3.2 How Blockchain Can Help
Blockchain enables the creation of digital tokens, which can represent any
asset (e.g., currencies, loyalty points, capacities) that are fungible and tradable.
Blockchain tokens can be categorized into currencies and tokens. Whereas a
currency (e.g., Bitcoin) is usually native to its blockchain, a token leverages an
already existing blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) and is built on top of it. Tokens are
created via a so-called smart contract, which is a self-executing computer protocol;
the process of converting the rights to an asset (e.g., claims on a supplier’s capacity)
into a digital token is called tokenization.
The combination of blockchain technology’s core elements, namely digital
tokens paired with a distributed ledger; a decentralized consensus mechanism,
which ensures that temporarily divergent versions of the database converge; and
cryptographic security measures enable the creation of a decentralized, virtual
marketplace. Such features can ensure symmetric information as well as trust in the
data and the trading process by providing transparent and valid records of historical
transactions (Babich and Hilary 2019). These unique features can be leveraged to
create a virtual market for trading tokens, which represent claims on suppliers’
capacities among (competing) retailers. The distribution of inventory can thus be
optimized prior to physical shipments, thereby facilitating more efficient operations
may be achieved as compared with traditional transshipments.
To assess this market’s potential for improving supply chain performance and
to understand the behavioral implications for decision makers who are exposed to
such a market, we leverage the supply chain simulation game Trading tokens among
competing retailers that is hosted on the DISASTER platform (Sect. 4.2.2).
4 DISASTER: A Research Platform for Advanced Supply
Chain Simulations
Morris Cohen identifies the considerable gap between managers’ knowledge and
their decisions (INFORMS 2004). Empirical research can shed light on human
decision-making behaviors in the context of supply chain management. We there-
fore introduce purpose-built experimental research and learning platform, DIS-
ASTER,1 that facilitates analyses of how blockchain-enabled information sharing
and virtual markets affect supply chains efficiency. Researchers can associate
behavioral traits of participants with their performance, allowing these connections
to be subsequently analyzed. The DISASTER platform also enables classroom
experience that facilitates industry learning about real-life supply chain issues and
the potential for blockchain technology applications.

176 D. Hellwig et al.
This section proceeds as follows. We start by describing the purpose and features
of the DISASTER platform. We then describe two simulation games hosted on the
platform and conclude by offering an outlook on future developments.
4.1 Purpose
Several platforms and software tools are available in the context of supply chain
simulations and games. These can be grouped into two main categories: (i)
generic platforms (e.g., z-Tree, oTree, SoPHIELabs) and (ii) supply chain-focused
platforms and games (e.g., the Beer Distribution Game, Hunger Chain Game,
Flower Game, Fathomd, Newsvendor Game). Existing generic platforms provide
an excellent framework for developing simulations, including extensive libraries
and communities, and are widely used. However, creating new simulations or cus-
tomizing existing ones for specific scenarios requires dedicated research resources, a
substantial time investment, and coding knowledge. Supply chain-focused platforms
and dedicated games cover a wide range of supply chain topics that are well suited
to conveying basic concepts and can be easily used in classrooms, but they are
limited in their flexibility to adjust for purposes different from those considered
in the initial design. (See Appendix A for an overview and assessment of several
prominent platforms.)
Although numerous supply chain-focused games exist, none incorporates the fea-
tures required for our inquiry into the role of blockchain technology for information
sharing in supply chains. We have consequently designed a new platform, which has
the following functional advantages:
1. Web-based interface; usable from any device with an Internet connection and a
browser.
2. Self-contained (e.g., participant links, instructions, quizzes, behavioral question-
naires).
3. Library of ready-to-use “personal traits” questionnaires, including evaluation
of its use; this library2 can be continuously updated and enhanced by all
collaborators.
4. Stable and secure data capture; data is saved in real time.
5. Close to zero latency; real-time interactions occur across all user interfaces (UIs),
which allows for dynamic and interactive games.
Moreover, the platform differs from existing platforms in terms of the following
four attributes:
1. A suite of pre-defined, ready-to-play supply chain simulation games use concepts
of blockchain combined with advanced encryption and decryption technologies.
2 See Appendix C for a list of questions used to assess behavioral characteristics.
Playing with DISASTER: A Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Simulation. . . 177
2. Plug-and-play approach; UI-based game configuration (e.g., behavioral traits
questionnaires, game design, instructions, parameters).
3. Open access of underlying data structure; no alignment with providers is
required.
4. No coding skills are needed for adjustments (spreadsheet-based backend).
In short, the DISASTER platform is a new tool with applications in academic
research, classroom teaching, and industry learning. The platform has already been
successfully used by the authors for research, as well as hundreds of students
in courses on operations management and blockchain technology and industry
practitioners in Europe and the USA.
4.2 Simulation Games
In what follows, we describe two selected DISASTER games that probe retailers’
ordering behaviors. (See Appendix B for a comparison of simulation games that
focus on the BWE.) We use these games to illustrate the platform interface and the
process of using the platform.
4.2.1 Information Sharing Among Competing Retailers
Description This game aims to research and to demonstrate (i) how using concepts
of blockchain technology to record and share select buyer information affects supply
chain performance and (ii) the potential of this technology to reduce the BWE’s
adverse consequences in cases of competition for scarce supplies.
Participants act as retailers in a supply chain that consists of one supplier (played
by the system) and multiple retailers (Fig. 1). All retailers have the same demand,
cost, and sales price conditions. In every round, participants are randomly matched;
all interactions occur through the simulation interface. In each simulation round,
participants decide on howmany units to order from the supplier, anticipating supply
shortages due to the orders of competing retailers while attempting to maximize
their own firm’s cumulative profit over 30 rounds. (See Appendix D for an example
of the simulation instructions.)
Four scenarios are pre-defined, as summarized in Table 1. In the baseline
Scenario 1, participants have no information about the order history of other
retailers against whom they are playing in each period; these conditions emulate the
traditional supply chain set-ups found in today’s industries. In the remaining three
scenarios, participants observe different levels of information provision/sharing. In
Scenario 2, participants observe the average order of both retailers in the previous
round; in Scenario 3, they observe the individual orders of both retailers in the
previous round; and in Scenario 4, they observe the individual orders of both
retailers over all previous rounds.

• Information is anonymized and

4 The individual orders of both
retailers in all previous rounds
This information is provided in a way that blockchain technology would enable
in practice. Information is automatically recorded and anonymized, and it is always
traceable to the individual entity (i.e., participants carry the history of their past
decision even when matched with new players). In addition, features such as fully
homographic encryption, which can be combined with blockchain technology—are
simulated in the game by displaying the averages of past orders. This approach
increases the individual firms’ data protection as only aggregated and combined
statistics are shown.
The results of each simulation run (e.g., average order per round, order variance,
inventory shortages/excess, total profit) are automatically calculated and displayed
to the game instructor. At this point, a discussion of how sharing past order infor-
mation affects supply chain performance can be conducted based on participants’
results.

Fig. 2 Interface for order entry in the Information sharing among competing retailers game
User Interface Participants can access the game by clicking on the provided game
link, which is automatically sent via a system-generated e-mail once the instructor
has initiated the process. If activated, participants can be asked to read the game
instructions and complete a readiness quiz prior to entering the simulation interface;
following this procedure ensures that everyone understands the game and allows for
a smooth simulation experience. Next, participants engage with an intuitive game
interface that provides all the necessary information. Figure 2 depicts the scenario
in which participants observe the individual orders of both competing retailers.
All displayed game parameters (e.g., number of rounds, time per round, number
of players, cost, sales price) can be directly adjusted on the instructor’s screen. After
completing the game, participants can be asked to fill out a post-game questionnaire
for the purpose of gathering additional feedback on the simulation—explicitly
asking about the strategies participants applied during the game, testing their
understanding of supply chain dynamics, and/or assessing behavioral characteristics
through a pre-defined list of well-established questionnaires.
Results We used the DISASTER platform in several OM and blockchain technol-
ogy courses and collected responses from hundreds of student participants, who
were divided into four groups based on the type of historical information available to
them when making ordering decisions. Results of these simulation games are shown
in Fig. 3, which plots the average order per round placed by the participants. There
are four scenarios, as described in Table 1. The control/baseline group (blue line),
which has no information about competing retailers’ behavior, namely, emulating
the traditional supply chain set-ups without the application of blockchain technology
demonstrates by far the slowest order inflation over time. When the average order of
both retailers in the last round (orange line) or the entire order history (yellow line)
is known (simulating the blockchain application in which past order behaviors are
automatically recorded, anonymized, and traceable), the graph reveals that orders

inflate more rapidly. It is interesting that the fastest order inflation converging
toward the Nash equilibrium is seen in the scenario under which the two competing
retailers’ individual orders are shared for only the last round (gray line).
In case of significant order inflation, as observed in scenarios 2–4, there
is a disconnect between demand and orders. This is problematic because one
would hope that orders not only convey important information to suppliers about
downstream demand but also enable them to plan their capacities and resources
appropriately. Suppliers often use received orders to allocate their available scarce
supplies between customers.
When orders carry no demand information, suppliers are forced to rely on their
own (often less accurate) market knowledge and must allocate supplies to customers
based on historical and thus potentially outdated metrics. A detailed discussion of
the drivers (e.g., behavioral characteristics) leading to such results is beyond the
scope of this chapter. Yet the results and implications for academics, practitioners,
and policymakers are surprising. The severe consequences of order inflation have
been observed in many industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the absence of concerns such as the reliability, accuracy, and timing of
available information, it seems reasonable at first sight to increase information
sharing, since managers nearly always prefer more information to less (or no)
information. Our results however demonstrate that opposite outcomes can occur:
more information sharing does not invariably result in an improvement in efficiency
as measured by profits across participants. These insights are relevant for academics,
practitioners, and policy makers when designing DLT-based information sharing
systems to anticipate potential downsides of sharing information among competing
supply chain entities.
4.2.2 Trading Tokens Among Competing Retailers
Description The purpose of this game is to research to what extent demand–supply
mismatches can be reduced, and supply chain performance improved, by creating a
virtual market among retailers for trading tokens of a supplier’s capacity. The tokens
represent digital claims on assets and can be enabled by blockchain technology.
Much as in the game described in Sect. 4.2.1, participants act as retailers in a sup-
ply chain that consists of one supplier (played by the system) and multiple retailers.
All interactions occur through the simulation interface. Two experimental scenarios
were played. (For teaching purposes, scenarios can be played consecutively with
the same group of participants.) In the baseline Scenario 1, participants must decide
how many units to order from the supplier while anticipating uncertain demand and
trying to maximize their firm’s total profit (i.e., they solve the standard newsvendor
problem). In Scenario 2, a virtual market is implemented whose design is based
on features offered by blockchain technology. Namely, retailers order tokens of the
supplier’s capacity (as opposed to units of the product) and then have an opportunity
to trade these tokens with each other anonymously while symmetric information as
182 D. Hellwig et al.
well as trust in the data and the trading process by providing transparent and valid
records of historical transactions is ensured. This set-up guarantees that competitive
information (e.g., a requested quantity, which may indicate the severeness of a
shortage) is not disclosed.
The sequence of events is as follows. At the start, participants decide how many
tokens to order from the supplier. All participants know the purchase cost of $10 and
the sales price, which is uniformly distributed between $51 and $100. Participants
must anticipate uncertain demand, which is uniformly distributed between 0 units
and 200 units. All retailers observe identical parameters, but the demand and sales
price realizations are independent between retailers and across rounds. That is,
retailers act in geographically distant/differentmarkets and have different valuations
for goods—a situation commonly observed across industries (as evidenced by
different US states’ willingness to pay for ventilators depending on the shortage
severeness). Once demand has been realized, participants can perform trades with
other retailers to buy or sell tokens by specifying the quantity and price; thus, they
seek to maximize their respective firm’s profits. The simulation lasts for 20 rounds.
(See Appendix E for an example of the simulation instructions.)
The results of each simulation run (e.g., supply–demand match, total profits) are
automatically calculated and displayed for the instructor. To illustrate the impact
of adding the virtual market for trading tokens, results of the two scenarios can be
plotted on the same graph.
User Interface This game is embedded in the same framework as the first one.
Hence the instructor can again easily adjust game parameters, flexibly modify
the game instructions, schedule a readiness quiz, and add post-game questions.
The scenario that allows for trading tokens is split into three phases, as we shall
describe from the participant’s perspective. In the baseline scenario (i.e., standard
newsvendor problem), only the first phase is played. The screen for the ordering
phase (see Fig. 4) presents an intuitive interface providing all necessary information
to place the order to the supplier; it also offers a “decision support calculator.”
After placing their initial orders, players enter the trading phase (Fig. 5). In this
phase, they submit trade orders to the system.
Finally, in the evaluation phase (Fig. 6), players can observe the outcome of their
trading orders and the resulting cash flow.
Results Results from the baseline scenario are in line with the standard newsvendor
literature, e.g., Bolton and Katok (2008). More specifically, we observe that
(i) orders deviate from optimal solution and exhibit a significant pull-to-center
effect and (ii) 30% of participants demonstrate demand-chasing behavior. In the
trading scenario, initial orders to the supplier are similar to the baseline (non-
trading) scenario. This is surprising given the empirical evidence provided by the
transshipment literature indicating that when transshipments are allowed, orders
tend to move toward the mean demand (Katok and Villa 2021). Players actively
undertake trades with the other participants to increase their own profit, which
yields a more than 30% improvement in the evenness of inventory distribution (i.e.,

fewer instances of shortages or excess inventory) and an overall supply chain profit
increase by over 20%. Over time, participants appear to improve their understanding
of the market setup; thus, more successful trades tend to be placed toward the end
of the simulation.
Our results demonstrate that via blockchain-enabled virtual market, which allows
anonymous trading of tokens on supplier’s capacity while ensuring symmetric
information, trust in the data and transparency can be created and successfully
harness the efficiency of centralized inventory pooling.

4.3 Ongoing and Planned Enhancements
Two main development streams are ongoing to advance this platform further. First,
additional games and scenarios are being developed to increase the number of
use cases while leveraging concepts of blockchain and advanced encryption and
decryption technologies in supply chains. For example: although the two games
described here utilize different blockchain strengths (i.e., advanced information
sharing and creation of virtual markets), a combination of both would yield
additional intriguing research opportunities.
Second, we are developing the platform’s backend. We are working on a
blockchain-based data-handling solution (i.e., smart contract) to automate secure
user data management and the collection and storage of data for research. This is a
common concern for behavioral research simulations. The goal is to create a global,
collaborative, and ever-growing simulation data pool that aggregates data from
multiple simulations while fully complying with regulations on research on human
subjects. That is, we intend to deploy blockchain to collect simulation data, ensuring
anonymity and limiting access to participants’ identifying information (according to
IRB3 requirements) while allowing participants to withdraw their consent to use the
data they generate for research purposes, even after the data have been recorded
to comply with GDPR, see GDPR (2022). Such a collaborative approach across
institutions will create a powerful database, enabling novel insights for the OM
community and beyond.

subjects.

A transparent, verifiably anonymous process for collecting user performance
data on a blockchain ledger will allow analyses of larger samples than any single
researcher can collect, and it will benefit the process of knowledge creation
while preserving participants’ anonymity and complying with applicable laws
and regulations. To facilitate the distribution of rewards for participation in the
simulation, an automated reward process is being developed to anonymously pay
subjects in cryptocurrency via blockchain. All features are developed to ease usage
of the platform by researchers and instructors and to improve the experience of all
participants.
5 Conclusion
This chapter describes the potential roles of DLT for addressing supply chain
shortages and competition for scarce resources via enhanced information sharing
capabilities and controls. We introduce a novel blockchain-enabled supply chain
simulation platform called DISASTER that compares favorably with existing
solutions owing to several attractive features; these include ready-to-use and highly
customizable supply chain simulations that leverage concepts of blockchain and
encryption technologies.
By way of demonstration, we describe two simulation games hosted on the
DISASTER platform that probe supply chain retailers’ order behavior: the first
investigates the role of information sharing among competing retailers, specifically
during supply chain shortages such as those observed during the COVID-19 pan-
demic. We find that decision makers act more strategically and more closely to Nash
equilibrium predictions when information about historical orders of competitors is
shared. The attendant increased order inflation has adverse consequences, such as
suppliers’ inability to plan capacities or allocate resources appropriately. Whereas
more information sharing is commonly desired by managers, especially when
concerns such as the reliability, accuracy, and timing of available information are
eliminated by a technology such as blockchain, our results demonstrate its potential
downsides. The second game enables the study of a virtual market on which tokens
of supplier’s capacity can be traded among competing retailers. These tokens can
be enabled by blockchain technology in practice. We observe that initial order
quantities are similar irrespectively of the possibility to trade as well as a markedly
more equitable distribution of inventory, resulting in an increase in supply chain
efficiency as measured by an increase in total profit across retailers.
Given its easy-to-adjust game set-up and the inclusion of behavioral assessments,
the DISASTER platform enables classroom and industry learning experiences
about real-life supply chain issues and blockchain technology. More generally, this
platform provides insight into how blockchain technology can affect supply chain
performance and on the role of decision makers’ behavioral characteristics via
enhanced information sharing capabilities.

D. Simulation Instructions for the Information Sharing Among
Competing Retailers Game (Scenarios 2–4)
Step 1: Past order observation
You can observe the past order(s) of the other two players against whom you
are playing in the current round. Similarly, your past order(s) is (are) visible to the
players in your group.
Step 2: Order submission
4 Questions can be added to the underlying spreadsheet with a fast and easy plug-and-play approach
Playing with DISASTER: A Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Simulation. . . 191
For your order, you can choose an integer number between 0 and 10,000 units.
Once you have submitted your order, you cannot change it.
Step 3: Supplier stock allocation and cost
The supplier has 120 units available in total, which are divided among all three
retailers in your group.
The allocation is determined as follows.
(a) The system calculates the total order received from the retailers (i.e., the sum
of your order and the orders from the other two retailers).
(b) If the total order is less than or equal to 120, you will receive the number of
units you ordered.
(c) If the total order is greater than 120, you will receive:
Your allocation = (your order/total order)× 120
Please note that you may receive fractions (decimals) of units.
For example,
• If you order 60 units and the total order from all retailers in your group is 110,
then you will receive 60 units. The other two retailers will receive 50 units in
total.
• If you order 60 units and the total order from all retailers in your group is 150,
then you will receive 48 units [=(60 ÷ 150) × 120]. The other two retailers
will receive 72 units in total.
The order cost is $10 per unit. The order cost applies only to units you receive.
So, for example, if you receive 60 units then your order cost would be $600 but if
you receive just 48 units then your order cost would be $480.
Step 4: Sales and revenues
The number of units you sell is equal to the minimum of (i) the demand from
your customers (50 units) and (ii) your supply, or the number of units allocated to
you by the supplier (as described in Step 3).
Unsold items are discarded at the end of the round; they are not carried over to
the next round. Unsatisfied demand is lost and cannot be backlogged to the next
round.
For example,
• if the supplier allocated 40 units to you, then your sales are 40 units (=min(40,
50)) and the unsatisfied demand for 10 units is lost at the end of the round;
• if the supplier allocated 52 units to you, then your sales are 50 units (=min(52,
50)) and the leftover 2 units are lost at the end of the round.
Revenue amounts to $20 per unit. Therefore, if your sales are 40 units then your
revenue is $800.
Step 5: Profit
Your profit per round = revenue per round – cost per round.
Your total profit over the entire simulation is the sum of profits per round.
192 D. Hellwig et al.
E. Simulation Instructions for the Trading Tokens Among
Competing Retailers Game
Step 1: Observation of your sales price for the current round
Observe the realization of your sales price, which is randomly drawn from the
range of $51 to $100 per unit and with an equal likelihood of every integer value (a
number without any decimals, such as $51, $63, $95).
The sales price of other retailers is also randomly drawn from the range of $51
to $100 per unit.
Sales prices are independent between rounds and across retailers.
Step 2: Submit your order to the supplier
For your order, choose an integer number between 0 and 400 units.
You can use the simulation tool to support your decision on how many tokens to
order from the supplier. This tool will provide you with the expected pre-trade profit
after you enter your estimated demand and specified order quantity.
Step 3: Demand realization
Your customer demand is randomly drawn from the range of 0 to 200 units, with
an equal likelihood of every integer value (a number without any decimals, e.g., 13,
105, 186).
Other players face their own levels of customer demand (i.e., you are not
competing for the same customers), which is also randomly drawn from the range
of 0 to 200 units.
Customer demands are independent between rounds and across retailers.
Step 4: Cost, sales, and revenue
You can observe your pre-trade profit projection. If you do not submit any trading
orders, then that projection would be your final profit in this round. The following
text describes how the projected pre-trade profit is calculated.
The order cost is $10 per token. For instance, if you order 130 tokens then your
cost is $1300.
The number of units you can sell to your customers is equal to the minimum of
(i) the demand from your customers (see Step 3) and (ii) how many tokens of the
supplier’s capacity that you hold (see Step 2). Suppose, for example, that you hold
130 tokens and that your customer demand is 90 units; in that case, your potential
sales quantity is 90 units (=min(130, 90)).
Your projected pre-trade revenue is equal to the sales price multiplied by the sales
quantity. So if your sales price is $60 and you sell 90 units, then your projected pre-
trade revenue is $5400.
Finally: Projected pre-trade profit = projected pre-trade revenue – order cost.
Step 5: Perform trades with other retailers in your group
You can change how many tokens you hold by trading with other retailers.
To trade, you specify whether you want to buy or sell tokens, the quantity, and
the price. You can sell all tokens that you hold (even if you can then not fulfill your
customer demand as the result). You can submit multiple trade orders per round, up
to a maximum of five.
Playing with DISASTER: A Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Simulation. . . 193
At the end of the trading period, the market clears given all orders that the
retailers in your group have submitted.
Trading and market-clearing processes (see table below)
A. Sell orders are ranked in price from lowest to highest and buy orders in price
from highest to lowest.
B. Units are matched in buy and sell orders whenever the buy price is greater than
the sell price of the matched units.
C. The average of the lowest buy price and the highest sell price at which the last
match happens is the market-clearing price: all buy orders pay this price and all
sell orders receive this price.
Consider the following example. The steps just described are marked by A, B,
and C in the table.
After the trading phase is completed, you sell to your customers using the new
number of tokens you have.
This marks the end of the round, and the final profits for this round are then
calculated. Your total profit over the entire simulation is the sum of profits per round.
Any unsold tokens are voided at the end of the round; they are not carried over
to the next round.
Unsatisfied customer demand is lost, and it cannot be backlogged to the next
round.
