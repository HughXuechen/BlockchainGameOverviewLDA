Abstract—Blockchain technology on the platform business
becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility,
and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers
(SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an
economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a
game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market
against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a
trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as
a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients.
The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform
business are (i) how SPs’ participation is reflected on its quality
of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute
their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our
game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game
is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in
a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the
competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result,
we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight
into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform
affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium
incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis
shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional
to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive
becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the
number of participated SPs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Today we are witnessing a significant growth of blockchain
technology, which originates from the nucleus of Bitcoin’s
architecture [1]. With the widespread adoption of blockchain
technology, a number of projects that require real-time co-
operation between mutually-suspicious contributors over the
internet have arisen. The growth of blockchain technology
includes a horizontal expansion led by startups mainly using
the public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin [1], Ethereum [2], and
a vertical development driven by consortiums and industry
partnerships mostly based on the permissioned blockchain,
e.g., Hyperledger [3] and Corda [4].
Blockchain technology has enabled the emergence of a new
type of platform structure by which a group of collaborative
and equally privileged providers is able to jointly maintain a
substantial amount of data storage and computational power in
a decentralized manner, without any unilateral centralizer. For
example, Samsung SDS [5] releases a digital blockchain-based
Fig. 1. Example showing a difference between centralizer-based platform
(left) and blockchain-based platform (right). The arrows represent the certifi-
cation flow for transactions between clients (e.g., A →B and B → C). If the
banks form a financial platform based on permissioned blockchain such as R3
in [6], then its QoS would depend on the participated Banks’ decentralized
resource contribution on the blockchain-based platform.
platform for supply chain management which can replace a
conventional electronic data interchange (EDI) system. R3 [6]
provides a blockchain consortium to create open-account trade
finance network among banks. As described in Fig. 1, unlike
a platform intermediated by a trusted centralizer, the quality
of service of blockchain-based platform highly depends on its
intrinsic cryptographic structure that brings an increase of QoS
in terms of security, irreversibility, and trustfulness. Moreover,
the QoS of blockchain-based platform relies on decentralized
data storage and computational power at a large scale, thus
the blockchain based platform needs to have an incentivizing
mechanism to encourage participants to join the platform.
The main interest of this paper lies in the viability of
such blockchain-based platform who mediates SPs and clients
by delivering services, where SPs participate as nodes of
blockchain and their services would be consumed by clients.
Successfully operating blockchain-based platform against the
competition with the centralizer-based platform requires the
incentive mechanism for SPs and the pricing strategy for
clients where the service quality of blockchain-based platform
varies with a participation of SPs. However, it has been

underexplored how to incentivize SPs who spend costs for
maintaining decentralized storage and computational power,
which has a high dependence on how the blockchain-based
platform and the centralized platform compete for pricing
strategies for clients.
To model a platform market, we consider the centralizer-
based platform, the blockchain-based platform, SPs, and
clients, where we formulate a platform-based two-stage dy-
namic game. In the first stage, platforms and SPs play a
dynamic sequential game, where the SPs decide which plat-
form to join and the blockchain-based platform determines
the incentives for SPs. Under the blockchain-based platform,
SPs should spend a cost for investment while they should
pay a commission to centralizer under the centralizer-based
platform. In the second stage, platforms and clients play a
dynamic sequential game, where the clients choose where
to subscribe and each platform decides its pricing strategy
for clients. Besides, towards more practicability, we model
various heterogeneities in (i) willingness to pay of clients, (ii)
willingness to invest of SPs, and (iii) QoS function of each
platform.
Analyzing our two-stage dynamic platform game, we aim
at answering the following questions: (i) How much the QoS
depending on the participation of SPs in blockchain-based
platform impacts on the incentive to joined SPs and (ii)
under what conditions, the blockchain-based platform would
be viable against the incumbent centralizer-based platform.
We quantify each platform’s economic impact as a form of
the net-revenue depending on platform selections of SPs and
clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which
gives us a useful insight into how much the service quality of
blockchain-based platform affects on the competition between
platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs.
Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium
incentive increases as the QoS of a blockchain-based platform
whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-
increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs thus the
blockchain-based platform is paid by SPs.
We summarize our main contributions as follows:
◦ Our economic analysis provides an insight into the via-
bility of blockchain-based platform whose QoS, reflecting
security, irreversibility, and trustfulness of services, highly
depends on the participation of SPs.
◦ We provide a game-theoretic model for a competitive plat-
form market between an emerging blockchain-based plat-
form and an incumbent centralizer-based platform, which
captures how three players (i.e., platforms, SPs, clients)
interplay in the market.
◦ From the equilibrium of analysis, we first show that a
platform offers a higher QoS can set a higher equilibrium
price and get a larger revenue. Moreover, the incentive for
SPs participated in blockchain-based platform highly relies
on the QoS function, thus we show when and how the QoS
impacts on the incentive.
II. RELATED WORK
The platform business based on blockchain technology has
proliferated over the past few years. Bitcoin [1], the first
blockchain-based cryptocurrency, acts as a financial platform
in which transactions can be validated between nodes without
a trusted third party. Moreover, the concept of smart contracts
suggested by Ethereum [2] has enabled execution of trusted
distributed applications on the blockchain-based platform.
Furthermore, the emergence of permissioned blockchain tech-
nology such as Nexledger [7], Hyperledger [3], and Corda [4]
has accelerated the platform business for companies who
want to make a connection with permissioned nodes rather
than with permissionless (or public) ones. Moreover, each of
cloud service providers [8]–[11] operates an infrastructure to
facilitate forming a blockchain-based platform.
Examples of a blockchain-based platform include the Inter-
net of Things (IoT) platform and the supply chain platform.
The papers in [12], [13] study the adoption of blockchain tech-
nology on IoT platform and the white paper in [14] addressed
the possibility of IoT-blockchain combination in supply chain
management. Moreover, the papers in [15], [16] investigate the
economic impact of a blockchain-based platform. The authors
in [15] discuss how the costs affected by blockchain platform,
the verification cost and the networking cost, impact on the
digital marketplaces and the paper in [16] inductively studies
the implications of blockchain technology on the platform
economy and how to create multi-sided markets.
In perspective of modeling and analysis, the literatures [17],
[18] are close to our work that analyzed the economic im-
pact of a platform market with non-cooperative game theory.
In [17], the authors have an interest in the investment incentive
of Internet service providers and the paper in [18] studies the
incentive mechanism for edge resource owners contributing
on fog computing platform. However, our interest is mainly
at understanding the economic impacts of the emergence of
a blockchain-based platform thus we precisely model the
characteristics of blockchain technology such as the QoS
function depending on participated SPs and the investment
cost for decentralized resources. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first game-theoretic approach that studies the
impact of the emergence of blockchain-based platform on the
incumbent platform market.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
III, we introduce our model and two-stage dynamic game
formulation. In Section IV and Section V, we describe the
equilibrium analysis and show the numerical examples in
Stage II and Stage I, respectively. In Section VI, we finally
conclude the paper.

platform, SPs, and clients.
III. MODEL AND GAME FORMULATION
A. System Model
Clients and service providers (SPs). We consider N number
of clients who can subscribe to multiple services provided by
SPs through a platform. There is a set S = {1, 2, . . . , S} of
S services where each service s ∈ S can be provided by ρsN
number of SPs. We assume that each SP serves a single service
and the total number of SPs is less than or equal to that of
clients, i.e.,
∑
s∈S ρs ≤ 1. Then, each SP chooses a platform
to deliver its service to clients and each client also decides to
subscribe services and corresponding platforms.
Platforms. We consider two types of service platforms which
are (i) a centralizer-based platform and (ii) a blockchain-based
platform. Both types of platforms provide software/hardware
infrastructure to guarantee service performance, security, ir-
reversibility, and trustfulness under which SPs deliver their
services to clients. For a service s, a platform in A = {n, c, b}
sets a service price pαs , α ∈ A to clients, where we use
‘n’,‘c’ and ‘b’ to refer a selection of no-service, centralizer-
based platform, and blockchain-based platform, respectively.
Thus, a client pays zero price if it chooses no-service. In the
centralizer-based platform, a centralizer owns the infrastruc-
ture and thus is paid commissions τ cs to SPs. The blockchain-
based platform supports a decentralized infrastructure among
SPs in which SPs spend the investment cost τ bs and get the
participation incentive es.
Quality of service depending on platforms. Let λb
s(ρ
b
s) be the
quality of service s ∈ S of the blockchain-based platform,
where ρbs implies the level of SPs’ participation for service s
through the blockchain-based platform. We denote by λc
s(ρ
c
s)
the centralizer-based platform’s quality of service s, which
is proportional to the level of SPs’ participation on the
centralizer-based platform, ρcs.
B. Two-stage Dynamic Platform Game
In this section, we introduce our game model for under-
standing how SPs and clients interplay for providing and
consuming service through two types of platforms not only
under the competitive relationship between SPs and clients
but also under that between centralizer-based platform and
blockchain-based platform. To this end, we present a two-stage
dynamic platform game in which three types of players (i.e.,
platforms, SPs, and clients) interplay sequentially.
Utility of clients. We first introduce a utility function of client
subscribing service s ∈ S , us : A× R
2 �→ R is defined by:
us(α,ps; θ) =
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
0, if α =‘n’,
θλc
s(ρ
c
s)− pcs, if α =‘c’,
θλb
s(ρ
b
s)− pbs, if α =‘b’,
(1)
where the price vector for service s is ps = {pcs, pbs}. To
model heterogeneity of clients, we assume that the clients have
different willingness to pay θ, where θ is a uniformly random
value over the interval [0, 1] as popularly modeled in e.g., [19].
It means that a client with a smaller θ prefers a lower QoS
than the one with a higher θ. We assume that the QoS of
blockchain-based platform λb
s increases with proportional to
the level of SPs’ participation ρbs, where the QoS depends on
security, irreversibility, and trustfulness. One may think that
this assumption is controversial since the public blockchain
sometimes has a performance limitation in terms of scalability
and transaction per second (TPS). However, our focus is on
a blockchain-based platform among companies, e.g., consor-
tiums, which can guarantee a non-decreasing performance
in terms of scalability and TPS by adopting a permissioned
blockchain. Furthermore, the centralizer is assumed to provide
a consistent QoS to their subscribers, thus we model the
centralizer-based platform’s QoS λc
s is not proportional to the
level of SPs’ participation ρcs but a constant.
Utility of SPs. An SP’s utility function for platform selection
vs : A\{n} × R �→ R with service s ∈ S is written by:
vs(β, es; γ) =
{
0, if β =‘c’,
es − γτ bs + τ cs , if β =‘b’,
(2)
where SPs’ heterogeneous willingness to invest on blockchain-
based platform is modeled by γ, which is assumed to be a
uniformly random value over interval [0, 1]. It means that an
SP with smaller γ prefers a lower investment cost than the
one with a larger γ. An SP serving s ∈ S with willingness
to pay γ decides a platform in β ∈ A\{n} to deliver its
service to clients. We assume that the SPs’ utility under the
centralizer-based platform is zero as a baseline, and an SP
gains the participation incentive es and saves the commission
cost τ cs under the blockchain-based platform. Moreover, the
investment cost τ bs is assumed to be larger than the commission
cost τ cs .

Revenue based on platforms. For a service s ∈ S, each plat-
form earns its net-revenue πs(·) depending on the strategies
of three types of players (i.e., platforms, SPs and clients), thus
the net-revenue is expressed as:
πs(α, β,ps, es) : A×A\{n} × R
2 × R �→ R.
Due to clients’ heterogeneous willingness to pay, given ps,
three different continuous intervals Θα
s (ps) ⊆ [0, 1], for all
α ∈ A, are defined where each interval Θα
s corresponds to the
market share of a platform α for service s ∈ S. In similar,
because of SPs’ difference in willingness to invest, given es,
two different continuous interval Γβ
s (es) ⊆ [0, 1], for all β ∈
A\{n}, are defined where interval Γβ
s corresponds to the SPs’
participation degree of a platform β for service s ∈ S. Then,
the revenue based a platform β of the service s ∈ S is given
by:
πs(β, ·) =

1{γ∈Γβ
s (es)}dγ for all β ∈
A\{n} the level of SPs’ participation for service s through
the platform β ∈ A\{n}. Then, the net-revenue of platform β
over the services in S is given by π(β, ·) = ∑
s∈S πs(β, ·), for
all β ∈ A\{n}. We now introduce a more detailed description
of our two-stage dynamic platform game, which is described
in Fig. 2.
Two-stage Dynamic Platform Game
Stage I: Incentivizing SPs and platform selection of SPs.
Blockchain-based platform, as a leader, sets a participation
incentive vector e = [es]s∈S for incentivizing SPs, then each
SP serving a service s ∈ S with the willingness to invest γ
chooses a platform between ‘b’ and ’c’ as follows.
◦ Step 1. Blockchain-based platform sets an incentive vec-
tor e� maximizing the net-revenue under his platform, i.e.,
e� = argmax
e
π(b, ·).
◦ Step 2. Each SP providing a service s chooses a platform
β maximizing its utility function, i.e.,
β�
s (γ) = arg max
β∈A\{n}
vs(β, es; γ), ∀s ∈ S.
Stage II: Pricing for clients and platform selection of clients.
Platforms decide their prices pc = [pcs]s∈S and pb = [pbs]s∈S
for selection of clients over all services s ∈ S. Then, each
client with the willingness to pay θ selects a platform or no-
service for each service in S.
◦ Step 1. Each platform β sets price vector pβ maximizing
the net-revenue under his platform, i.e.,
(i) pc,� = argmax
pc
π(c, ·), if β = ‘c’,
(ii) pb,� = argmax
pb
π(b, ·), if β = ‘b’.
◦ Step 2. Each client subscribing service s selects a plat-
form β or no-service maximizing its utility functions, i.e.,
α�
s(θ) = argmax
α∈A
us(α,ps; θ), ∀s ∈ S.
In the following section, we present the equilibrium analysis
conducted by the backward induction, which is a standard tool
for computing the equilibrium of sequential game. Therefore,
our analysis starts from Step 2 in Stage II, in which we
describe how each client selects a platform for given price
vectors pc and pb, followed by the price selection of platforms
at Step 1 in Stage II.
IV. INTERACTION BETWEEN PLATFORMS AND CLIENTS:
PRICING AND PLATFORM SELECTION
In this section, we first focus on the interaction between
platforms and clients in Stage II. Each platform delivers
the platform-based services provided by SPs to clients with
corresponding QoS, which depends on the participation level
of SPs. Assuming that the participation level of SPs is given
from Stage I, then the QoS of platforms for a service s ∈ S
can be divided into two regimes under the following condition
C0:
C0: λb
s(ρ
b
s) ≥ λc
s(ρ
c
s). (4)
R1 corresponds to blockchain-preferred regime, under which
the condition C0 holds and the blockchain-based platform
provides more qualitative service than the centralizer-based
platform. In similar, R2 refers centralizer-preferred regime,
under which the condition C0 does not hold.
A. Equilibrium Analysis of Stage II
The following Proposition IV.1 states when each client
selects which platforms under what conditions.
Proposition IV.1 (Step 2 in Stage II). Consider a service s ∈
S, then the platform selection of a client with the willingness
to pay θ at the equilibrium is given by:

Fig. 3. Clients’ platform selection at the equilibrium in each regime.
From the definition of clients’ utility (1), a client with will-
ingness to pay θ will choose the blockchain-based platform,
i.e., α�
s(θ) = b, if the following holds:
θλb
s(ρ
b
s)− pbs > θλc
s(ρ
c
s)− pcs,
or
θ >
λb
s(ρ

s)− λc

.
Otherwise, a client with θ will utilize the centralizer-based
platform, i.e., α�
s(θ) = c, if it brings her a positive utility, i.e.,
θλc
s(ρ
c
s)− pcs > 0, or θ >
pcs
λc
s(ρ

s)
.
Therefore, the platform selection of a client with the willing-
ness to pay θ at the equilibrium under blockchain-preferred
regime is obtained as (5). Similarly, we can get the equilibrium
behavior of a client under the centralizer-based platform
as (6).
Note that the result in (5) and (6) leads to the market share
of each platform. Thus, it is easy to see the market shares of
platforms for each service s ∈ S as follows:
R1. Θc
s =
( pc

This implies that the platform providing a higher QoS can
attract the clients who have a larger willingness to pay θ. The
following Proposition IV.2 states the equilibrium price vectors
setting by platforms over all services in S.

Proof. By backward induction, we first derive the equilibrium
of clients’ platform selection at the Step 2 of the Stage II in
Proposition IV.1. Here, we provide the equilibrium analysis at
the Step 1 of the Stage II. Consider a service s ∈ S under
blockchain-preferred regime. The blockchain-based platform
decides the price vector pb to maximize the net-revenue, i.e.,
pb,� = argmax
pb
π(b, ·).
The blockchain-based platform’s revenue of service s ∈ S
defined by (3) can be rewritten by:
πs(b, ·) = pbsN

}
,
where we assume that the participation level of SPs ρβs for
each platform β ∈ {b, c} is given from Stage I. Then, the
net-revenue π(b, ·) = ∑
s πs(b, ·) is strictly concave function
with respect to the positive pricing strategy pb > 0, since the
Hessian of π(b, ·) is negative definite, which is given by the
negative diagonal matrix, i.e.,
∂2π(b, ·)
∂pbs
2 < 0 and
∂2π(b, ·)
∂pbs∂p
b
t
= 0, ∀s, t ∈ S, s 
= t.
Similarly, the centralizer-based platform’s net-revenue is also
strictly concave function with respect to the positive pricing
policy pc > 0, since the Hessian of π(c, )̇ is negative definite,
which is given by the negative diagonal matrix, i.e.,
∂2π(c, ·)
∂pcs
2 < 0 and
∂2π(c, ·)
∂pcs∂p
c
t
= 0, ∀s, t ∈ S, s 
= t.
Therefore, we can find a unique equilibrium p� = (pb,�,pc,�)
in (7) satisfying:
∂π(b, ·)
∂pbs
(p�) = 0 and
∂π(c, ·)
∂pcs
(p�) = 0,
for all s ∈ S. Similarly, we can get the equilibrium price
vectors under centralizer-preferred regime, thus we omit it.
Proposition IV.2 implies that the platform who offers a
higher QoS can set a higher equilibrium price, which is more
than or equal to twice of the other’s one. We note that the
equilibrium prices highly depend on the QoS of platforms,
which is a function of the participation level of SPs on each
platform.

B. Numerical Analysis: Impact of Platform’s QoS
We now illustrate numerical analysis that highlights the
impact of the platform’s QoS function with respect to the SPs’
participation level on the equilibrium behavior of clients and
platforms. To this end, we further assume that the incentive
e = 0 to focus on the analysis in Stage II of our two-
stage dynamic platform game. We consider a single service
|S| = 1, where the centralizer-based platform provides a
constant QoS with respect to the SPs’ participation level and
the blockchain-based platform’s QoS linearly increases with
the SPs’ participation level, thus we respectively assume that
λc
s(ρ
c
s) = 1 and λb
s(ρ
b
s) = 2ρbs. Therefore, the platform market
will be under blockchain-preferred regime if ρbs > 0.5 and
under centralizer-preferred regime if ρbs < 0.5.
Impact on clients’ platform selection. Fig. 3 describes that
clients’ platform selection at the equilibrium under each
regime. Under R1, the blockchain-based platform providing
a higher QoS is chosen from clients with high willingness to
pay for a service. Meanwhile, clients with low willingness
to pay select the centralizer-based platform that delivers a
service with a lower quality. Similarly, under R2, the high-
end clients subscribe to the centralizer-based platform that
serves a higher QoS whereas the low-end clients choose the
blockchain-based platform. Moreover, under both regime, the
clients with extremely low willingness to pay do not use the
service.
Impact on pricing policy for clients. Fig. 4(a) shows that
each platform’s equilibrium pricing policy pβ,�s with respect
to the participation level of SPs in blockchain-based platform
ρbs. Under R1, the blockchain-based platform can set a higher
price than the other’s pricing policy. This implies that the
blockchain-based platform has a larger market power than
the centralizer-based platform and a higher QoS results in a
higher equilibrium price. Similarly, under R2, a higher QoS
also brings about a higher equilibrium price of the centralizer-
based platform. However, under both regime, the equilibrium
prices of both platforms become zero at the point where the
platforms provide homogeneous QoS, i.e., λb
s = λc
s = 1, due
to the perfect competition.
Impact on market share and revenue. Fig. 4(b) and 4(c) depict
market shares and revenues at the equilibrium, respectively.
Under R1, the market share tends to decrease as the level
of SPs’ participation in blockchain-based platform because
the increase of SPs’ participation level causes the increase
of blockchain-based platform’s QoS and of the equilibrium
price. Similarly, the market share grows as the level of SPs’
participation under R2, since the equilibrium price declines.
Moreover, under both regime, a higher QoS platform has
a larger market power thus gets more market share in the
platform market. Consequently, the equilibrium revenue with
respect to the participation level of SPs as shown in Fig. 4(c)
has a similar tendency to the equilibrium price depicted in
Fig. 4(a), since the increase (or decrease) slope of price is

steeper than the decrease (or increase) slope of market share
as the increase of SPs’ participation level.
V. INTERACTION BETWEEN PLATFORMS AND SPS:
INCENTIVIZING AND PLATFORM SELECTION
We now aim at understanding how the blockchain-based
platform’s incentive vector e globally affects on the equi-
librium behavior of three players (i.e., platforms, SPs, and
clients). According to the backward induction, we first explain
how each SP chooses a platform to deliver its service with a
given incentive vector e in Step 2 analysis, where the incentive
is determined by the blockchain-based platform in Step 1.
A. Equilibrium Analysis of Stage I
Proposition V.1 states that the platform selection of each SP
with the preference on investment cost γ at the equilibrium.
Proposition V.1 (Step 2 in Stage I). Consider a service s ∈
S, then the platform selection of a SP with the willingness
to invest for the blockchain γ at the equilibrium is given as
follows:
β�
s (γ) =
{
c, if γ ≥ es+τc
s
τb
s
,
b, otherwise,
(9)
where −τ cs < es ≤ τ bs − τ cs .
Proof. Consider a SP providing a service s ∈ S with willing-
ness to invest on blockchain-based platform γ. The SP will
choose a platform to maximize her utility defined in (2), thus
she will select the blockchain-based platform, i.e., β�
s (γ) = b,
if the following holds:
es − γτ bs + τ cs > 0 or γ <
es + τ cs
τ bs
.
Otherwise, a SP with γ will use the centralizer-based platform
to provide a service s ∈ S to clients.
The level of SPs’ participation on each platform for a service
s ∈ S , the important factor that determines the platform’s QoS
function, is induced by the result in (9):
ρbs = ρs ·

and Γc

, for all service s ∈
S. Moreover, we have the range of incentive as es < τ bs − τ cs
and es > −τ cs , which makes a larger utility of SP under the
blockchain-based platform than the one under the centralizer-
based platform. Then, we finally find the overall equilibrium
of our two-stage dynamic platform game by analyzing the
Step 1 in Stage I, which is on the procedure of the backward
induction.

under each regime is given as follows:

we provide the general form of the unique equilibrium price
vector pβ,� and the corresponding net-revenue π�(β, ·) for all

Proof. By backward induction, we have shown the equilibrium
analysis of the Stage II and that of the Step 2 of the Stage
I, sequentially. Now, we provide the equilibrium analysis at
the Step 1 of the Stage I for blockchain-preferred regime.
The blockchain-based platform sets the incentive vector e to
maximize the net-revenue, i.e.,

Note that the QoS of each platform of a service s is a
function of incentive es, for all s ∈ S, but we omit es from the
third line for simplicity. If the net-revenue of blockchain-based
platform π(b, ·) = ∑
s π(b, ·) is a strictly concave function
with respect to the incentive mechanism e, then we can get a
unique equilibrium incentive e� satisfying:
∂π(b, ·)
∂es
= 0, ∀s ∈ S,
where es < τ bs −τ cs . The Hessian of π(b, ·) is negative definite
if the following holds:
∂2π(b, ·)
∂e2s
< 0, and
∂2π(b, ·)
∂es∂et
= 0, ∀s, t ∈ S, s 
= t,
where −τ cs < es < τ bs − τ cs and −τ ct < et < τ bt − τ ct .
Therefore, under the condition C1, the above condition is met
thus a unique equilibrium incentive e� can be obtained as
Theorem V.1. Sequentially, we can readily drive the general
form of the unique equilibrium price vector pβ,� and the
corresponding net-revenue π�(β, ·), for all β ∈ A \ {n}.
Similarly, we can get the equilibrium incentive, price and
corresponding revenue under centralizer-preferred regime, thus
we omit it.
Theorem V.1 provides the equilibrium of our two-stage
dynamic platform game. It reveals how much the incentive
policy e� sequentially impacts on the pricing strategies and the
net-revenue at the equilibrium. We note that the equilibrium
incentive is affected how the QoS function is designed, which
captures the intrinsic structure of blockchain. Thus, we now
explore the impacts of different cases of blockchain-based
platform’s QoS on the equilibrium state of the platform market.
B. Impact of Blockchain-based Platform’s QoS on equilibrium
As shown in Proposition V.1, the blockchain-based plat-
form’s QoS depends on its incentive strategy, i.e., λb
s(ρ
b
s) =
λb
s(
ρs(es+τc
s )
τb
s
), since the SPs’ platform selection relies on
the incentive strategy. Therefore, the equilibrium behavior of
platform market can be interpreted from the function λb
s(es).
Corollary V.1. A unique incentive e�s always exists for a
service s ∈ S, if the following condition C3 is met:
C3:
∂2λb
s
∂e2s
≤ 0 and
∂λc
s
∂es
= 0,
where −τ cs < es < τ bs − τ cs .
Proof. Recall the conditions C1 and C2. The first terms of the
left-hand side of C1 and C2 become less than or equal to zero
under the condition C3. Thus, the conditions C1 and C2 hold
thus a unique incentive e� exists under both regimes.
Corollary V.1 implies that under blockchain-preferred
regime R1 with condition C3, the unique e�s exists and
the corresponding price pβ,�s , the net-revenue π�
s (β) for all
β ∈ A \ {n} are also uniquely determined. The example
satisfying C3 includes the case that the blockchain-based
platform’s QoS proportionally increases with es and the
centralizer-based platform’s QoS is a constant. We note that
the equilibrium incentive e�s can be negative under some
cases, which implies that SPs have the willingness to pay the

(a) Impact of linear QoS of blockchain-based platform. (b) Impact of logarithmic QoS of blockchain-based platform.

incentive to the blockchain-based platform. This can be pos-
sible where the commission cost subscribing the centralizer-
based platform is sufficiently higher than the investment cost
using the blockchain-based platform as well as the SPs have
enough willingness to pay the investment cost. The following
Corollary V.2 states more extreme case in which e�s is always
negative.
Corollary V.2. The unique incentive is given as:
e�s = −

, ∀s ∈ S,
if the following condition C4 is met:
C4:
∂λb
s
∂es
= 0 and
∂λc
s
∂es
= 0,
where −τ cs < es < τ bs − τ cs .
Proof. Recall the condition C3. If the condition C4 holds, then
the condition C3 is also met. From Theorem V.1, the unique
incentive for a service s ∈ S is derived as:
ρs(2e
�
s + τ cs )
τ bs
= 0,
if the condition C4 holds. Then, we have e�s = − τc
s
2 .
The condition C4 describes the case that not only the
centralizer-based platform but also the blockchain-based plat-
form’s QoS is a constant thus does not depend on how much
the incentive is. In this case, the platform selection of SPs
which is based on the amount of incentive does not affect the
QoS of blockchain-based platform, thus it causes a negative
equilibrium incentive, i.e., e�s < 0.
C. Numerical Analysis: Impact of QoS on Incentive for SPs
In this subsection, we show numerical analysis that cap-
tures the impact of blockchain-based platform’s QoS on the
equilibrium incentive for SPs. We consider two types of QoS
functions, one is a linear QoS function and another is a
logarithmic QoS function with respect to the SPs’ participation
level on blockchain-based platform. We assume that a single
service |S| = 1, where the centralizer-based platform provides
a constant QoS thus λc
s = 1.
Fig. 5(a) shows the QoS function and the corresponding
net-revenue of blockchain-based platform with respect to the
incentive for SPs under R1. We assume that the QoS function
is linear thus given by:
λb
s(ρ
b
s(es)) = B +A× ρbs(es) = B +A× ρs(es + τ cs )
τ bs
,
where ρbs(es) is induced from Proposition V.1 and we choose
B = 1.2 and A ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5}. We observe that the
equilibrium incentive increases with the slope of blockchain-
based platform’s QoS. Moreover, interestingly, the equilibrium
incentive is negative if the SPs’ participation in blockchain-
based platform has a weak impact on the platform’s quality

revenue and incentive at the equilibrium. We choose |S| = 1, ρs =

s = 1.
of service, for example, A = 0 and A = 0.5. This implies
that the equilibrium incentive is affected how much the SPs’
participation contributes on the blockchain-based platform’s
QoS. Therefore, if the QoS logarithmically increases, then the
impact of SPs’ participation becomes weaker thus the incentive
will decrease as shown in Fig. 5(b). In this case, the QoS
is assumed to be: λb
s(ρ
b
s) = B + A × log(1 + ρbs(es)), then
the negative equilibrium incentive occurs if A = 0, A = 0.5,
and A = 1. Fig. 6 captures the impact of linearly increasing
QoS function of blockchain-based platform on the equilibrium
incentive under R2. In this regime, the blockchain-based
platform’s market power is insignificant, thus the equilibrium
incentive is formed at the very low value.
VI. CONCLUSION
We investigated a digital platform market among a
blockchain-based platform, a centralizer-based platform, SPs
and clients via a two-stage dynamic game. We model various
features of blockchain technology such as the QoS function
depending on the participated SPs and the investment cost
for decentralized storage/computation. Moreover, our model
captures the heterogeneities on the willingness to pay of clients
and willingness to invest, which highly affect on their platform
selection strategies. Our analysis includes the answers of the
following key questions: (i) how SPs’ participation is reflected
on its QoS and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute
on computing/storage infrastructure. Consequently, our eco-
nomic analysis provides a useful insight into the viability of
blockchain-based platform against the competition with the
centralizer-based platform. From the equilibrium analysis, we
first show that a platform offers a higher QoS can set a higher
equilibrium price and get a larger revenue. Moreover, the
incentive for SPs participated in blockchain-based platform
highly relies on the QoS function, thus we show when and
how the QoS impacts on the incentive.
