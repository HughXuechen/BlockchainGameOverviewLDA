Abstract. In traditional supply chain systems, a centralized server is utilized to
store information and a series of IoT devices are applied to manage and upload
information. However, the server may be attacked easily and the IoT devices
may forge the information, which result in a single point of failure, incorrect
information problem and security challenges. To solve these problems, we
design a distributed, secure and credible system by exploiting blockchain
technology and game theory. The information in our system is consistent after
consensus process, the stored information can’t be forged and the devices are
motivated to behave honestly. The performance analysis demonstrates that our
proposed system provides satisfied security and the numerical results illustrate
that our award and punishment scheme can offer remarkable incentives for IoT
devices to upload correct messages while keeping the system credible.

1 Introduction
With the integration and development of global trade, the supply chain market is
increasingly affecting our life. Applying Internet technologies, like IoT, AI and big
data, to supply chain has been a more and more significant topic both in academics and
industries. However, as the problem of counterfeit medicine and food safety incidents
occurring one after another [1], the information about the products is no longer trusted
by the public. Therefore, it’s a vital issue to protect information security in the supply
chain system [2]. In order to overcome the problem, many approaches have been
provided. Most of the existing schemes utilize IoT technologies, such as RFID [3],
NFC, to detect products and rely on a centralized system to store information. How-
ever, there are some common security challenges to these systems:
• The centralized system inherently has the problem of a single point of failure.
Services would be unavailable if the system broke down.
• The centralized server is nontransparent and some stakeholder nodes may tamper
information for personal interests.
• Some IoT devices may upload incorrect information on purpose. The traditional
supply chain system may be incredible.

In conclusion, security and credibility are the key factors affecting the supply chain.
Therefore, it’s very important to design a distributed, secure and credible supply chain
system.
The Blockchain technology, which is firstly introduced by Bitcoin [4], has the
potential to be applied in supply chain systems because of its distributed, secure,
traceable and transparent nature. Leveraging blockchain to supply chain systems can
overcome a single point of failure, forged information problem and security challenges.
Some works have already focused on combining such technology with supply chain.
A conceptual framework of agri-food supply chain system using RFID and blockchain
is proposed to guarantee food safety [5]. However, this system doesn’t consider
information forgery. Alzahrani et al. [6] proposed a block-supply chain that detects
counterfeiting attacks using blockchain and NFC technologies. Although this work can
be effective at protecting information security, it doesn’t take the fact into account that
IoT devices may upload incorrect information.
Game theory mainly studies the mutual influences of rational decision-makers. The
stakeholders in the supply chain system can be motivated to contribute to a credible
system with game theory. Some papers [7, 8] apply game theory to stakeholders in
order to balance their profits. However, they ignore that the server may be fragile to be
attacked. Esmaeili et al. [9] proposed several seller–buyer supply chain models to
analyze the supply chain system. Nevertheless, this paper doesn’t overcome the
problem that the information in the system may be incorrect.
In this paper, we exploit blockchain technology and game theory to develop a
system which provides distributed, secure and credible services. This distributed sys-
tem is established by a series of nodes which mainly carry out consensus process and
maintain a blockchain so that the system can defend against attacks. Besides, we design
a specific data structure to store messages and link all messages together, with which
the information security is promised. In order to keep the system credible, we introduce
an incentive model based on game theory to motivate the devices to upload correct
information. An optimal award and punishment scheme for the devices is proposed to
maximize the credibility of the system.
2 Blockchain Enabled Supply Chain System
2.1 System Design
Figure 1 presents an overview of the supply chain system. The system includes
blockchain nodes and supply chain devices. The blockchain nodes need to verify
devices, carry out consensus process, save information after agreement and defend
against attacks. The supply chain devices collect products’ information, sign it and
upload it to the blockchain system. The core components of our system are as follows:
Entity: IoT device that records information and uploads it to the blockchain.
Peer: Node which executes consensus process and provides information-related
services.
MemPool: Memory pool that records registered entities.
A Secure and Credible Supply Chain System Based on Blockchain 89
In our system, Entity needs to send its unique identity certificate, device id and
public key to the system in order to register and get access to the system. The con-
sensus nodes (i.e., Peers [10]) verify their validity, save registered Entity to MemPool
and provide services to Entity. The system works as a distributed network and can
effectively defend against attacks. The information is delivered and handled in a P2P
manner, so information will be approved only after the majority’s agreement. Besides,
the system can still provide services even though some nodes are attacked.
Figure 2 shows the data structure transferred between the server and IoT devices.
The structure can be divided into three parts:
• Firstly, the data header includes the following parts: ID (to identify each device in
the system), Time (to describe the time when the data is generated), and PrevHash
(the hash of the previous data about the same product). This part is designed to
identify the ownership of the data.
• Secondly, the data payload consists of Pid (to identify the specific product for
device ID), Information (the information detected by IoT devices), and NextId (to
transfer the product to another device). This part is designed to record product-
related information.
• Thirdly, the data footer contains Hash (to identify the unique digest of the data) and
Sign (to sign on Hash with the device’s private key). This part is designed to ensure
data integrity.
In our designed data structure, PrevHash can help to avoid information forged and
locate information efficiently. Time can prevent an adversary from forging earlier
information by comparison with previous messages. Hash is the digest result of
message header and payload. In addition, the private key to sign Hash is only held by
the corresponding IoT device. Therefore, the data structure can ensure information
security effectively. The information can’t be forged or tampered as the structure links
all the data together and identifies the owner by verifying their signatures.

2.2 Incentive Model
Our proposed system can prevent evil nodes from tampering information. However, we
need to solve the problem that some adverse devices may upload incorrect information
on purpose. We introduce an incentive model based on game theory [7] to strengthen
the credibility of the system.
We assume that the players in our incentive model are the supply chain server and
IoT device. Furthermore, we assume that both players are profit-oriented and take their
strategy actions at the same time. Furthermore, the strategy information of one side is
fully understood by the other. Hence, we build a static game model of complete
information. We define that the strategy set of the server is S0 = (Supervision, No Supervision)
since the server can choose to supervise the device or not, and the strategy set of the
device is S1 = (Adversary, Honesty) because it may behave honestly or work as an
adversary.
The relevant parameters about this model are defined in Table 1.
Given the actual conditions, the relationship between S and H is complex. In order
to make the problem comprehensible, here we assume S ¼ HþD (D is a fixed num-
ber). Some limitations between these parameters are as follows:
• S� E[H;F[C; S� F\H
• S;E;H;F;C;D; h[ 0
We can obtain the payoff matrix for the server and the device shown in Table 2:
Table 1. Parameters and meanings
Symbol Meaning
C Cost incurred by the server for its supervision on the device
V Profit obtained by the server due to credibility
E Cost incurred by the device for forging information
S Profit obtained by the device for forging information
F Punishment incurred by the device for forging information
H Award received by the device for honesty
h Success probability of the server supervises an adversary

At the Nash equilibrium point, there is no incentive for the server nor the device to
deviate from the set of actions that will achieve the globally optimal solution. There-
fore, assuming that the server selects Supervision with probability qð0� q� 1Þ, then the
mixed strategy is r1 ¼ ðq; 1� qÞ. Similarly, if the device chooses Adversary strategy
with probability pð0� p� 1Þ, the mixed strategy is r2 ¼ ðp; 1� pÞ.
Based on the above assumptions, we obtain the expected payoffs of the server and
the device as following, respectively:

To maximize the credibility of our blockchain server is our target. By substituting

We can make the following conclusions by analyzing the above results:
• At the equilibrium point, the payoffs of both the server and the device are the best.
In other words, no player in the game has an incentive to make a unilateral change.
In order to obtain award, a rational device would be willing to upload correct
information.
• If H is properly set, the server can obtain the best profit, which further indicating
that the credibility of the server is guaranteed. Besides, we can also conclude from
Eq. 6 that H is negatively correlated with h. The server should try to enhance its
ability to supervise successfully so that less award needs to be paid to the device.
• The higher the punishment F is, the more profit the server obtains. We can draw the
conclusion that it is less possible for the device to be adverse with higher pun-
ishment. As a result, in such a case, the necessity of supervising from the server will
become inessential.
According to the above analysis, we can summarize that our incentive model can
work efficiently to contribute to a credible system.
3 Experiment and Results Analysis
3.1 Security Analysis
We firstly analyze the blockchain-related security issues that are particularly relevant to
supply chain [11]. All messages are broadcasted in a P2P manner. Hence, the tampered
messages can’t be admitted since the majority has the correct messages after consensus
process. Besides, the messages stored in the blockchain are linked and each message is
signed by the entity. It’s impossible for an adversary to forge the messages. Lastly, all
the messages are audited and authenticated by all consensus nodes, so a counterfeit
message is unable to be approved. Security is guaranteed that any IoT device or server
is unable to forge other devices’ messages and approved messages cannot be tampered.
Next, we analyze our incentive model. Section 2.2 presents the optimal award and
punishment scheme. With the solution, the IoT devices have to be punished if they are
adverse. Otherwise, they will obtain award if they upload correct messages. Mean-
while, the credibility of the system is guaranteed. As a result, rational devices prefer
uploading correct messages rather than sending forged messages. The security is
enhanced with the incentive model.
Above all, both the security and credibility of our system are achieved.
3.2 Numerical Results
The system introduces an incentive model to guarantee credibility and motivate IoT
devices to behave honestly. We use MATLAB to simulate the model and analyze the
award and punishment scheme. According to the actual conditions, we set the fol-
lowing parameters shown in Table 3.
A Secure and Credible Supply Chain System Based on Blockchain 93
Figure 3 displays payoffs of IoT devices and server with different strategies in the
game. The intersection point of payoffs is the equilibrium point discussed in Sect. 2.2.
The result is ð0:34; 0:17Þ, which is consistent to our calculation
p ¼ C
Fhþ Sh
¼ 0:3378; q ¼ S� E � H
Fhþ Sh
¼ 0:1689: ð8Þ
In other words, IoT devices can behave honestly with probability 0.6622 and the
server can choose to supervise it with probability 0.1689. The strategies are the best
choices for them and the best result for the system.
Figure 4 illustrates that the profit of IoT devices increases when the server pays
more award to them. However, as the award increases, the profit of server first reach to
peak and then decreases. Figure 5 indicates that the more punishments the server
demands, the less profit the IoT device obtains.
In accordance with our analysis, the simulation results clearly reveal the relation-
ship between the award, punishment and profit. Our simulations prove that there is an
equilibrium point where the server and the device can obtain their best profit while the
server is credible with our incentive model.

In summary, our proposed supply chain system is secure, incentive and credible
according to our analysis and simulations.
4 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a decentralized and credible supply chain system based upon
blockchain technology and game theory. The system is able to protect information from
being forged and prevent IoT devices from uploading incorrect information. We per-
form security analysis and performance simulation to evaluate the system and the
model, respectively. Security analysis confirms that our proposed system and model
achieves secure and positive results, and the simulation of the incentive model indicates
that our award and punishment scheme is efficient to ensure the credibility.
Nevertheless, there is still room for further improvements. For example, we can add
credit grade to the IoT devices to obtain a better award and punishment scheme.
Additionally, we can build a practical testbed to further verify our proposed system.
