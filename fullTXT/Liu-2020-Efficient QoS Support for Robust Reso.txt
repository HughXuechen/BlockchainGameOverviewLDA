Abstract—Blockchain-based femtocell networks aim to
build decentralized frameworks which enable easy deploy-
ment and low power consumption, thus they have been seen
promising technologies to make up the coverage of cel-
lular networks in the next generation communication sys-
tem. This article aims to employ power control to support
quality-of-service provisioning, especially the guarantee for
the transmission rate of a macrocell user (MUE) and the
time delay of femtocell users (FUEs) in two-tier femtocell
networks, where the MUE and FUEs share the same com-
munication channel. We formulate the interactions among
the macrocell base station and FUEs as a Stackelberg game
to maximize the utilities of MUE and FUEs by obtaining the
optimal power allocation and pricing strategy. Considering
the uncertainty of channel gain which is expressed as a
function of transmission distance, we propose a worst-case
method to transform the uncertain optimization problem
into a deterministic one. We then design two algorithms by
considering the dynamics of FUEs, i.e., FUEs may join and
leave femtocells. Numerical results verify the convergence
and superior performance of our proposed algorithms.

data grows significantly, the coverage of cellular networks has
been extended largely. However, due to severe channel fading,
especially when the signals penetrate buildings, the problem of
indoor coverage poses a great challenge. To this end, femtocell
which can make up the coverage of cellular networks has been
seen as a promising technology due to the advantages of easy
deployment and low power consumption [1]. Femtocells use the
spectrum resource of macrocell for improvement of frequency
spectrum utilization. However, femtocell networks still face
some challenges. First of all, due to the small coverage of each
femtocell and short distance between femtocells, communica-
tion users receive a variety of interferences, such as the inter-
cell interference in each femtocell, cotier interference among
femtocells, and cross-tier interference between femtocells and
macrocell. Therefore, interference management is an urgent
research topic to be investigated [2]. Secondly, with the pop-
ularity of mobile devices, electronic money transactions have
received extensive attention in femtocell networks. However, in
the traditional centralized transaction, the transaction consensus
is reached through centralized third party which usually brings
additional costs. To solve this problem, blockchain technology
is introduced into femtocell networks. Blockchain, as the back-
bone technology of the current popular digital currency such as
bitcoin, has become a promising decentralized data management
framework [3], [4]. In order to ensure the validity of electronic
transaction data in blockchain-based femtocell networks, mobile
devices are required to complete proof of work, which requires a
lot of computation. Even if mobile devices validate transactions
through simplified payment verification (SPV) method, connec-
tions and requests with full node are inevitable, which has to
meet low latency requirement.
Blockchain-based femtocell networks provide users conve-
nient mobile communication services. However, there are still
some challenges to push femtocell networks into practice.
First, with the increasing number of users, how to guarantee
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of both MUEs and
FUEs has become an urgent problem. Different users may have
different QoS requirements. For example, on the one hand, it is
desired that a user delivers data with fast transmission rate,
as providing the guarantee for transmission rate is required
by a variety of streaming media-based applications. On the
other hand, the dissemination of advertisements or coupons
must meet a delay requirement [5], [6]. Data delivered beyond

a delay requirement may lead to reduced or even useless
value. Decentralized applications using blockchian technology
are faced with the performance bottleneck of their underlying
platform. For instance, Cryptokitties, a decentralized game built
on ethereum, made the services of blokchain paralysis for
a week. And mobile users’ interests have been infringed as
they cannot validate a transaction in time. Secondly, users in
femtocell networks often move in the indoor environment, the
transmission distances between users and base stations vary a
lot. Therefore, transmission distance is an important factor to
describe the complex channel environment, as the transmission
distance is related to the channel gains of both indoor and
outdoor transmissions.
II. RELATED WORKS
The methods of interference management are presented in lit-
eratures [7]–[11], i.e., power control, frequency reuse, multiple
access technology. In [7], a downlink interference evaluation
scheme is proposed to maximize user equipment throughput.
In [8], a joint subcarrier and power allocation problem for
uplink femtocell networks is considered. In this article, a
temperature limit on the interference arising is imposed to
suppress cross-tier interference. Power control is an effective
way for interference management. Some schemes are presented
to address power control problem in the following literatures. In
[9], a stochastic approximation algorithm for downlink power
control in femtocell networks is proposed. The authors focus
on distributed femtocell base station (FBS) power control for
cross-tier interference mitigation. The authors in [10] propose a
distributed auction scheme to tackle the resource management
and task scheduling in mobile systems. In [11], the interference
avoidance problem among FBSs is examined by presenting
two algorithms that maximize as much as possible the average
achievable data rate per femtocell user (FUE). Implementing
blockchain in mobile communication and devices are also
widely researched by many startup blockchain companies. Sirin
Labs has been developing the first blockchain smart phone,
and every product of this company is committed to using
their own blockchain. They promote use of digital currencies
and decentralization through Sirin Labs Token (SRN) tokens.
However, none of the above works consider QoS provisioning
in blockchain-based femtocell networks.
Several works in the literatures have considered the resource
allocation problem with QoS requirements in femtocell net-
works [12]–[16]. Moreover, game theoretic analysis is a reason-
able approach to deal with resource allocation problem between
players in a two-tier femtocell network. In [13], a distributed
resource allocation that consists of subchannel and power-level
allocation of the two-tier cognitive femtocell network is studied
using a coalitional game, which dedicates to maximize the up-
link sum rate under constraints of interference while maintaining
the average delay requirement for users. In [14], a problem of
joint users’ uplink transmission power and data rate allocation
in multiservice two-tier femtocell networks is tackled based on
a supermodular game. The independent variables of power and
rate are used to design utility functions to express users’ QoS
demands. In [15], a joint price and power allocation problem in
the spectrum sharing femtocells networks is modeled based on
Stackelberg game. Macrocell user (MUE) interference tolerance
and its minimum rate requirement are taken as constraints in the
utility functions. However, the works above have not considered
the uncertainty of communication environment in two-tier net-
works. The uncertainties of the channel are inevitable and the
robustness should be taken into consideration.
In this article, we propose to employ power control to support
QoS provisioning, especially the guarantee for the transmis-
sion rate of a MUE and the time delay of FUEs in two-tier
femtocell networks. In our article, we consider the channel
gain uncertainty which includes the measurement error. We
formulate the interactions among the macrocell base station
(MBS) and FUEs as a Stackelberg game to maximize the
utilities of MUE and FUEs by obtaining the optimal power
allocation and pricing strategy. More specifically, MBS serves
as a leader, and FUEs act as followers. The MBS shares its
spectrum resource to FUEs, hence cochannel interference is
produced by the FUEs. In this article, we propose to price the
interference and charge the FUEs to restrain the interference
introduced by FUEs. Therefore, the interference introduced by
the FUEs can be regarded as the available resource used by
FUEs. In order to avoid excessive interference from FUEs, MBS
prices the interference to the FUEs, the FUEs determine their
transmission powers and payments with the constraint of time
delay maximizing their utilities. Considering the uncertainty of
communication distance, we propose a worst-case method to
transfer the uncertain optimization problem into a deterministic
one, and design two algorithms. The main contributions are
summarized as follows.
1) A joint power allocation and pricing strategy is proposed
to guarantee the QoS requirements both of MUEs and
FUEs, i.e., the transmission rate of MUE and time delay
of FUEs. The improvement of QoS enables mobile users
to validate a transaction in time in blockchain-based
femtocell networks.
2) The uncertainties of channel gains are taken into consid-
eration. A worst-case method is utilized to deal with this
uncertain optimization problem and obtain closed-form
expressions. The proposed resource allocation scheme is
robust to the changing communication environment.
3) Based on the theoretical analysis, we give two dis-
tributed algorithms, which are suitable to the de-
centralized blockchain-based femtocell networks, by
considering the dynamics of FUEs, i.e., FUEs may join
and leave femtocells.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
A two-tier network is considered which consists of one MBS
and N femtocells. In this scenario, the MBS is interfered by the
uplink transmission of FUEs located nearby. We assume single
carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) is used
for uplink transmission. Namely, there is only one active FUE
on one subchannel in each femtocell, and there is no interference

among FUEs in each femtocell. However, some FUEs in dif-
ferent femtocells may run in the same subchannel, there exists
interference among FUEs in different femtocells. Additionally,
as the FUEs in different subchannels do not interfere with each
other, the resource allocation result for a single subchannel can
be obtained first, then, it can be extended to other subchannels,
according to the dual problem decomposition approach [17], in
which resource allocation problem can be decomposed to mul-
tiple independent subproblems which are solved respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1, the MBS and FBSs provide service for
their corresponding users with coverage radius Rm and Rf ,
respectively. Let h0,0 and gi,i denote the distances from MUE
and FUE i to their corresponding base stations, respectively. Let
hi and gi,j denote the distances from MUE and FUE j to FBS i,
respectively. And gi denotes the distance from FUE i to MBS,
i, j ∈ I, i �= j, I = {1, 2, . . . , N}.
B. The Uncertainty of Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio
(SINR)
In order to maintain the decentralization of blockchain,
ethereum, bitcoin, and other public chain restrain their trans-
actions per second (TPS) performance to ensure that even in
common networks ordinary computers can participate in the
network. The uncertainty of channel fading and poor quality
of communication limits the number of transactions in the
network. It is necessary to take the uncertainty into account
when designing the resource allocation strategies. Let α and β
denote the pass-loss exponent of outdoor and indoor transmis-
sions, and α > β. The channel gain in outdoor and cross-wall
transmission is expressed as H(|x|) = |x|−α . The channel gain
in indoor transmission is expressed as H(|x|) = |x|−β . Here,
|x| denotes the distance from a user to the respective base
station. p = {p1, p2, . . . , pN } denotes the vector of transmission
powers for all FUEs, and 0 ≤ pi ≤ pmax
i ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. p0
denotes the transmission power of MUE, and p0 ≥ 0. Then the
signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) of MUE and FUE i
can be written as
γ0 =
p0h
−α
0,0 (e0)∑N
i=1 pig

i,i (ei,i)
p0h
−α
i (ei) +
∑N
j=1,j �=i pj g
−α
i,j (ei,j ) + σ2
(2)
where σ2 denotes the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In
this SINR model, it is assumed that the channel gain is affected
by path loss. The uncertain transmission distance which includes
measurement error is considered, which are denoted as h0,0(e0),
gi,i(ei,i), hi(ei), gi,j (ei,j ), and gi(ei). It is assumed that the
uncertainties are bounded, and the boundaries are denoted
as ε0, εi,i , εi , εi,j , εi , respectively. Then the channel gains
can be expressed as h0,0(e0) ∈ [ĥ0,0 − ε0, ĥ0,0 + ε0], gi,i(ei,i) ∈
[ĝi,i − εi,i , ĝi,i + εi,i ], hi(ei) ∈ [ĥi − εi , ĥi + εi ], gi,j (ei,j ) ∈
[ĝi,j − εi,j , ĝi,j + εi,j ], and gi(ei) ∈ [ĝi − εi , ĝi + εi ], where
ĥ0,0, ĝi,i , ĥi , ĝi,j , ĝi represent the estimated values of trans-
mission distances. In this article, we attempt to study a robust
resource allocation scheme considering the SINR uncertainty
which is caused by the deviation of estimations.
C. Robust Stackelberg Game Formulation
Creating signature of transactions locally and sending them
through mobile devices require considerable power consump-
tion, thus optimized power allocation method can improve the
QoS of blockchain-based mobile applications. In this section,
we formulate the interactions among the MBS and FUEs as a
Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of users.
1) MBS Modeling: In femtocell networks, MUE as an autho-
rized user shares its spectrum resource with nearby unauthorized
users (FUEs). Due to the cochannel interference which is
caused by the signal transmissions of FUEs, MUE prices the
interference to guarantee the QoS of communication. Therefore,
interference resource is available for purchase, and it can be
utilized by FUEs. We formulate the interactions among the
MUE and FUEs as a Stackelberg game, where MUE acts as
a leader, and FUEs act as followers. MUE maximizes its utility
by charging FUEs. Moreover, considering the constraint of
transmission rate, i.e., the transmission rate of MUE should be
larger than a transmission rate threshold. Therefore, the subgame
of MUE is described as
Problem 1:
max
ci ≥0,p0≥0
U0 =
N∑
i=1
cipig
−α
i (ei) − u0(p0 − p̄0)
s.t. log(1 + γ0) ≥ Rmin ∀i ∈ I, (3)
where Rmin denotes the transmission rate threshold of MUE.
The constraint in Problem 1 indicates that the power of MUE,
i.e., p0 can be adjusted to guarantee its transmission rate.∑N
i=1 pig
−α
i (ei) denotes the total received interference of MBS
caused by FUEs. ci denotes the interference price imposed
on FUE i.
∑N
i=1 cipig
−α
i (ei) denotes the total revenue MBS
obtained from the payments of FUEs. (p0 − p̄0) is the additional
power that MBS needs to expend. u0 is the price coefficient of
additional power. p̄0 is the original power that MBS transmits
when there is no FBS, i.e., log(1 + p̄0h0, 0
σ 2 ) ≥ Rmin.
2) FUE Modeling: Interference prices which are collected
from FUEs have been determined by MBS at first. FUEs as
the unauthorized users, compete in a noncooperative manner
to maximize their respective utilities. The utility function of a
FUE is the difference between transmission rate and payment.

Considering the constraint of delay requirement, i.e., the time
delay of each FUE should be smaller than the maximum time
delay. The transmission power of each FUE is chosen by the
following problem:
Problem 2:
max
pi ≥0
Ui = log(1 + γi) − cipig
−α
i (ei)
s.t. Di ≤ Dmax
i ∀i ∈ I (4)
where Dmax
i denotes the time delay threshold of FUE i. The
constraint in Problem 2 suggests that the power of FUE i, i.e.,
pi is allocated to guarantee its time delay requirement. Since we
assume that there is only one FUE that is served by FBS within
one time-slot, taking into account the M/M/1 queuing model
[18], [19], the average time delay of FUE i is Di = 1
κi Ri −λi
,
where the data packet length follows exponential distribution
with parameter κi , Ri is the data transmission rate represented
as Ri = log(1 + γi), where packet arrival follows a Poisson
process with parameter λi .
IV. ROBUST STACKELBERG GAME ALGORITHM
In this proposed Stackelberg game, first, MBS as the leader
declares its strategy. According to the leader’s strategy, FUEs as
the followers subsequently choose their strategies. Both MBS
and FUEs make decisions to obtain the optimal utilities. MBS
and FUEs compete with each other in a noncooperative manner,
thus the game equilibrium (GE) can be obtained by addressing
the Nash equilibrium (NE) of this noncooperative game. The
GE is an operating point where both MBS and FUEs have no
incentive to change their strategies unilaterally. In this section,
we apply backward induction to gain the GE of the proposed
robust Stackelberg game. First, based on the given c, each FUE
maximizes its utility to obtain the optimal pi . Second, according
to the obtained power response, MBS maximizes its utility to
obtain the optimal c.
A. Optimal Power Allocation Strategy for Femtocells
Blockchain-based mobile communication which usually in-
volves transference of economic rights and interests demands
high QoS standards. In our article, considering the fact that the
channel gain uncertainty is taken into account in both objective
functions and constraint conditions, we propose a worst-case
method to transform the uncertain optimization Problems 1 and
2 into deterministic ones. Then the subgame of FUE i is rewritten
as the problem below
Problem 3:

on the uncertainty of transmission distance, it is noted that
Problem 2 is equivalent to the Problem 4

In femtocell networks, a noncooperative competition problem
can be formulated to investigate the behaviors of players, who
compete with each other for maximizing their own utilities.
Next, the existence and uniqueness of GE will be analyzed in
the following theorem.
Proposition 1 ([20]): An NE exists in the Stackelberg game,
if ∀i ∈ I, the following requirements are met.
1) p is a nonempty convex and compact subset of some the
Euclidean space RN .
2) Ui(pi,p−i , c) is continuous in p and concave in pi .
Theorem 1: A GE exists in the proposed noncooperative
game G = {S, {pi}, {Ui}}, where S is the set of players.
Proof: 1) Since the convex set is a single point or a
continuous line in one-dimensional space. For the strategy
pi ∈ [0, pmax
i ], it is easy to see that {pi} is a nonempty, convex,
and compact subset of the Euclidean space RN .
2) According to (6), it is evident that Ui(pi,p−i , c) is a
continuous function of pi . Subsequently, the first-order and
second-order derivatives of Ui(pi,p−i , c) with respect to pi are
given as
∂Ui
∂pi
=
(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β
pi(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β + Ii(p−i)
− ci(ĝi − εi)−α (7)
∂2Ui
∂p2
i
=
−(ĝi,i + εi,i)−2β[
pi(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β + Ii(p−i)
]2 < 0 (8)
Apparently, the second-order derivative of Ui(pi,p−i , c) with
respect to pi is always less than 0. Accordingly, Ui(pi,p−i , c)
is concave in pi . According to Proposition 1, a GE exists in the
noncooperative game G. �
As solving the maximization of concave function is a con-
vex optimization problem, Problem 4 is a convex optimization
problem and can be addressed using the method of dual decom-
position. The Lagrangian function of the proposed nonlinear
programming problem is constructed as (9)
L(pi, ηi) = log
(
1 +
pi(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β
Ii(p−i)
)

where ηi is the Lagrange multiplier. The dual problem of original
optimization problem is given as
Problem 5:
min
ηi ≥0
q(ηi) = min
ηi ≥0
max
p
L(pi, ηi). (10)
It is found that Problem 5 is convex, and it can be solved
by using a subgradient method. The subgradient of the dual
function q(ηi) is written as
Hηi
=
∂q(ηi)
∂ηi
= log
(
1 +
pi(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β
Ii(p−i)
)
− (eΦ i − 1
)
.
(11)
Therefore, the Lagrange multiplier ηi is updated as the
following iterative equation
ηi(t + 1) =
[
ηi(t) − y1(t)Hηi
]+
(12)
where [X]+ = max{0,X}. t denotes the iteration step. y1
denotes the step size which is positive.
By using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions in optimiza-
tion theory, the optimal allocated power of FUE i can be obtained
by taking the partial derivative of L(pi, ηi) w.r.t. pi , that is
pi =
1 + ηi
ci(ĝi − εi)−α
− Ii(p−i)
(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β
. (13)
Theorem 2: The NE of the noncooperative game G is unique.
Proof: It can be found that transmitting power of FUE i is
possible only when
ci <
(1 + ηi)(ĝi − εi)α
Ii(p−i)(ĝi,i + εi,i)β
. (14)
At this time, FUE i transmits its power with the best power
response with (13) relative to other FUEs. Thus NE p∗i is the
local optimum in [0, pmax
i ], it is unique and equal to pi . By
contrast, if interference price is set too high, the transmission
power of FUE i will be zero, resulting in stopping work of FUE
i. Hence, the optimal solution of (9) is given by
p∗i = min
{[
1 + ηi
ci(ĝi − εi)−α
− I∗i (p−i)
(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β

∑
j �=i p∗j
(ĝi,j − εi,j )−α + σ2, i, j ∈ I.
Moreover, the formulation (15) is rewritten as a power alloca-
tion iteration of the form p(t + 1) = A(p(t)). Here, A(p(t)) is
the power update strategy for FUE i. Thus, the individual power
update strategy is described as

where �p−i(t) = [�pj (t)]j∈I,j �=i . In two-tier femtocell net-
works, the distance from FUE i to its corresponding FBS is
close, there is (ĝi,i + εi,i)−β > (ĝi,j − εi,j )−α , j �= i. It can
be easily obtained that ‖ G−i
(ĝ i , i +εi , i )−β ‖∞ < 1. Consequently,
| � pi(t + 1)| converges to zero . That means pi(t) can converge
to a unique fixed point p∗i . According to the definition of NE,
NE of the noncooperative game G is unique. �
B. Optimal Pricing Strategy for Macrocell
In this subsection, the solution of optimal price is determined
in dynamic power adjustment scheme. Because of the interfer-
ence prices collected from FUEs are the same, let ci = c which
denotes the uniform interference price. As discussed above, con-
sidering the impact of distance uncertainty, a worst-case method
is utilized to deal with Problem 1 with the constraint of QoS
requirement. Therefore, the subgame for MBS is reformulated
as
Problem 6:

c>0,p0>0
min
e
U0(c,p, p0)
s.t.
{

log(1 + γ0) ≤ Rmin

(18)
With the worst-case method, the constraint of rate require-
ment is given as log(1 + p0(ĥ0, 0+ε0)−α∑N
i = 1 pi (ĝ i −εi )−α +σ 2
) ≤ Rmin.
In view of the uncertainty model of transmission dis-
tance, Problem 6 can be converted into a deterministic convex
optimization problem as follows:
Problem 7:
max
c>0,p0>0
U0(c,p, p0) =

(19)
It is found that the robust allocation problem above is a
convex optimization problem. The detailed procedure of the
best response of MBS is indicated in the following analysis. The
Lagrange function of Problem 7 is formulated as (20), where ξ
is Lagrange multiplier. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions
of Problem 7 are represented as (21) shown at the bottom of this

From (21)(a), it is easy to obtain that ξ > 0. Therefore, the
power p0 can be determined by (21)(b) shown at the bottom of
this page, that is
p0(p) =
(
eRmin − 1
)(∑N
i=1 pi(ĝi − εi)−α + σ2
)
(ĥ0,0 + ε0)−α
. (22)
By replacing pi with the obtained optimal power from (13)
in the above equality, the formulation of p0 with respect to c is
derived as
p0(c) = H
N∑
i=1
(
1 + ηi

where Ĩi(p−i) =

i = 1
( ĝ i −ε i )−α ( ĥ i −ε i )−α
( ĝ i , i + ε i , i )−β
.
By substituting (23) into the formula (13), it can also ob-
tain the formulation of pi as function of the only variable c
as (24) shown at the bottom of this page, where Ĩ∗i (p−i) =∑
j �=i p∗j (ĝi,j − εi,j )−α + σ2.
The values of p0 and pi in (23) and (24) respectively are put
into the objective function (19), then Problem 7 can be rewritten
as (25) shown at the bottom of this page.
Theorem 3: The NE of the Stackelberg game is unique.
Proof: According to (25), it is evident that U0(c) is a
continuous function of c. It can be proved the second-order
derivative of U0(c) with respect to c is always less than 0.
Accordingly, U0(c) in Problem 7 is a concave function with
respect to c. Hence, there exists an NE in the game.
Since the objective function above is a concave function,
the optimal price can be calculated by solving ∂U0(c)
∂c = 0.
Thus, the optimum solution of Problem 8 is (26), where
A∗
i = (ĝ i −εi )−α Ĩ ∗
i (p−i )
(ĝ i , i +εi , i )−β . Furthermore, the iterative formula of
interference price can be acquired. As the proof is sim-
ilar as the one in Theorem 2, the interference price can
converge to a unique fixed point. Therefore, the pro-
posed Stackelberg game between MBS and FUEs exists an
unique NE. �

communicate in the network. Thus Algorithm 1 is used to
change the tolerable interference threshold by regulating the
power of MUE. Then the power of FUEs are redistributed for
being accommodated. �
B. Fixed Power Allocation and Pricing Algorithm
In indoor environment, the number of users varies, it is natural
in practice because FUEs may leave or join femtocells at any
time. Therefore, we propose a flexible MUE power adjustment
algorithm in this article, aiming at accommodating the dynamic
of FUEs and guaranteeing the QoS of FUEs, at the same time,
reducing the energy consumption of MUE.
In dynamic power allocation and pricing algorithm, the
transmission power of MUE p0 is taken as a variable, and
is solved in Problem 1. However, in fixed power allocation
and pricing algorithm, p0 is set as a fixed value, the com-
ponent u0(p0 − p̄0) in objective function can be ignored.
Thus, the problem for MBS is simplified and reformulated as
follows:
max
c>0,p0>0
U0(c,p, p0) =
N∑
i=1
cpi(ĝi − εi)−α

p0(ĥ0, 0+ε0)−α∑N
i = 1 pi (ĝ i −εi )−α +σ 2
≥ eRmin − 1
Eq. (20)
. (30)
It can be observed that the above problem is a convex optimiza-
tion problem. It can be solved by constructing a Lagrangian
function which is presented as (31), where ζ is the Lagrange
multiplier
L(c, ζ) =
N∑
i=1
(
(1 + ηi) − c(ĝi − εi)−αIi(p−i)
(ĝi,i + εi,i)−β
)
+ ζ
[
p0(ĥ0,0 + ε0)−α∑N
i=1 pi(ĝi − εi)−α + σ2
− (eRmin − 1
)]
.
(31)
The dual problem of (31) is formulated as
min
ζ≥0
f(ζ) = min
ζ≥0
max
c
L(c, ζ). (32)
Problem (32) is convex, and the subgradient method is utilized
to solve this problem. The subgradient of this dual function
f(ζ) is
Hζ =
∂f(ζ)
∂ζ
=
p0(ĥ0,0 + ε0)−α∑N
i=1 pi(ĝi − εi)−α + σ2
− (eRmin − 1
)
. (33)
Consequently, the Lagrange multiplier ζ is updated as
ζ(t + 1) =
[
ζ(t) − y2(t)Hζ
]+
(34)
where [X]+ = max{0,X}, y2 is the positive step size.
On account of KKT conditions, the optimal interference
price is calculated by ∂L(c,ζ )
∂c = 0. Hence c∗ can be determined
according to (35), and the pricing algorithm with fixed power is
shown in Algorithm 2
c∗ =
√√√√ ζ
∑N
i=1(1 + ηi)∑N
i=1
(ĝ i −εi )−α
(ĝ i , i +εi , i )−β Ii(p−i)

Remark 1: In the proposed scheme, the tolerable interfer-
ence of MUE is treated as a kind of available resource, a
Stackelberg game model between MUE and FUEs is established
with pricing mechanism. The proposed algorithms are adaptive
for dynamic FUEs. MUE does not need to regulate its power to
fit FUEs, while the transmission powers of FUEs are updated
according to their corresponding interference prices. In this
scenario, Algorithm 2 is used. When the requirements of FUEs
cannot be satisfied by pricing mechanism, e.g., some FUEs join
or leave femtocells, MUE adjusts its power to coordinate with
FUEs. In this case, Algorithm 1 is used.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In the simulation, MUE and FUEs are randomly distributed.
Referring to [15], [18], the parameters are given in Table I.
A. Simulation under Dynamic Power Allocation
In this part, we test the performance under dynamic power
allocation algorithm, where the transmission power of MUE
is regulated with the change of interference price. There is
one MBS and N = 10 FBSs in the network. Considering the
uncertainty of distance, the transmission distances vary within
a certain interval, ±5% around each measured value. Fig. 2

illustrates the convergence of FUEs’ powers under the proposed
algorithm. It can be seen that the power of each FUE converges
in several iterations. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the power of
MUE converges quickly as Y th = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 bps/Hz,
respectively. As shown in the figure, MUE’ power for higher
transmission rate requirement, i.e., Y th = 1.5 bps/Hz, is higher
than the one for the lower rate requirement. This is because with
higher transmission rate requirement, MUE needs more power
to meet higher SINR demand. Similarly, the convergence of
price is shown in Fig. 4.
B. Simulation With Fixed Power Allocation
We analyze the performance under fixed power allocation
algorithm. From Fig. 5, it is observed that the power of each
FUE converges to an equilibrium. The convergence of price
is shown in Fig. 6, where the prices vary with the changing
transmission rate requirement Y th . The higher prices are taken

with increasing Y th , because the total suffered interference
of MBS is reduced when the transmission rate requirement
increases. So MBS needs to charge more to maximize its utility.
It is found from Fig. 7 that total transmission rate of
FUEs decrease with the increase of MUE’s transmission rate
requirement. The total utility of FUEs also show the same
tendency, which is omitted due to the space limit. Higher MUE’s
transmission rate requirement causes higher interference price,
resulting in the increase of FUEs’ costs. And fewer FUEs are
willing to share the spectrum resource of MBS. In Figs. 8
and 9, the performance of FUEs are presented with different
powers of MUE. Under the same topology of Algorithm 1, it
can be obtained the optimal transmission power of MUE is
Pm = −27.72 dB. At the same time, the fixed transmission
powers Pm = −25 dB and Pm = −30 dB are chosen to make
a comparative analysis. The value of Pm is selected for the
Fig. 7. FUEs’ total transmission rate under fixed allocation.

purpose of normal operation of FUE devices. It is shown
in Fig. 8 that the transmission power of FUEs are higher
with the increase of Pm . When Pm = −25 dB, the maximum
transmission power of FUEs are obtained. In Fig. 9, it is found
that the utilities of FUEs are not significantly different, which
indicates that if MUE transmits with its optimal power, the
communication rate of FUEs can be guaranteed as much as
possible alongside the tradeoff between energy consumption and
transmission rate.
C. Simulations With MUE Power Adjustment
In this scenario, the number of FBS does not change fre-
quently, Algorithm 2 is used to allocate transmission power and
interference price of FUEs. When FUEs joins in the femtocell
or FBSs access the macrocell, the tolerable interference of MBS

would exceed the threshold. Hence, the power of MUE p0 should
be regulated to adjust the interference threshold.
In this part, the simulations are given where there are three
new FBSs accessing to the network. At first, Algorithm 2 is
used under fixed transmission power Pm = −20 dB to allocate
powers of FUEs. The values of Γ and maxi Yi
∑N
i=1(1 + ηi) −∑N
i=1 Yi are computed as 2.3641e−11 and 3.3377e−10, respec-
tively. It is evident that Γ < maxi Yi

i=1(1 + ηi) −

In Fig. 10, the transmission powers of FUEs are provided. It
can be seen that the power of FUE 13 is zero, that means
FUE 13 cannot work. Therefore, Algorithm 1 is switched to
reallocate the powers of FUEs by regulating the power of MUE.
In Fig. 11, the powers of FUEs after MUE power adjustment
are indicated. It is found that the transmission powers of FUEs
are reduced.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this article, the proposed power control scheme improved
data transmission and guaranteed the relay requirement, thus
enhancing the QoS of blockchain-based mobile applications.
Mobile users were able to query a transaction in time and
optimization of power enabled miners to validate blocks with
lower energy consumption. A Stackelberg game was modeled
to analyze the behaviors between MBS and FUEs. The MBS
set interference prices to FUEs to maximize its utility and
guarantee its transmission rate requirement. Based on the inter-
ference prices, FUEs determined their powers to optimize their
utilities subject to the delay constraint. The proposed robust
power allocation and pricing problem with distance uncertainty
was addressed using a worst-case method. Furthermore, two
algorithms were designed by considering the dynamics of FUEs.
