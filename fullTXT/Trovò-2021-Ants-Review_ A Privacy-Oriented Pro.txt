Abstract. Peer review is a necessary and essential quality control step
for scientific publications but lacks proper incentives. Indeed, the pro-
cess, which is very costly in terms of time and intellectual investment,
not only is not remunerated by the journals but it is also not openly rec-
ognized by the academic community as a relevant scientific output for
a researcher. Therefore, scientific dissemination is affected in timeliness,
quality and fairness. Here, to solve this issue, we propose a blockchain-
based incentive system that rewards scientists for peer reviewing other
scientists’ work and that builds up trust and reputation. We designed
a privacy-oriented protocol of smart contracts called Ants-Review that
allows authors to issue a bounty for open anonymous peer reviews on
Ethereum. If requirements are met, peer reviews will be accepted and
paid by the approver proportionally to their assessed quality. To promote
ethical behaviour and inclusiveness the system implements a gamified
mechanism that allows the whole community to evaluate the peer reviews
and vote for the best ones.

1 Introduction
Since the birth of Bitcoin [18] in 2008 as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,
blockchain technologies have spread far beyond the sole cryptocurrency domain,
in particular after the implementation of general purpose smart contracts intro-
duced by Ethereum [32]. Besides a growing number of applications ranging
from De-Fi, healthcare, music industry, government, identity, to cite but a few,
blockchain technology has recently started to catalyse the attention of the sci-
entific community as well [7,24] with the promising potential of being a ‘game

changer’ in outdated and broken scientific practices and leading towards open
science [2]. Indeed, scholars have pointed out how the intrinsic characteristics of
blockchain technology set the basis for a open science infrastructure [15] in which
decisional processes are transparent and therefore more democratically accessi-
ble to all the stakeholders (researchers, reviewers, funders, taxpayers). Those are:
the consensus algorithm [16], a deterministic computational trust that allows
for decentralization, for which there are no trusted third parties; the proof of
existence (PoE) that via cryptographic hashing and timestamping creates a digi-
tal footprint able to keep a traceable chronological record of research objects that
cannot be altered or retrieved (due to its property of immutability or append-
only) [15]. In particular, a ‘blockchainified science’ [3] could ‘reduce waste’ [10],
by disclosing each step in the research cycle to ‘scientific self-correction’ way
before the final publication step, and therefore help fixing the current repro-
ducibility crisis in science.
A thorny issue in the academic system that can - and we think it should - be
tackled by blockchain concerns the status and accreditation of peer review, the
core process of scientific validation currently facing a crisis [11]. In this paper we
propose a solution to the problem of reviewers recognition based on the principles
of tokenomics [14] and in line with the values of open science.
2 Background
2.1 Peer Review: Present Problems and Mild Solutions
Peer review is still the only quality control mechanism devoted to evaluating
scientific outcomes. The purpose of peer review is, to cite [11]: “improving the
quality of the published paper, determining the originality of the manuscript,
determining the importance of the findings, detecting fraud, and detecting pla-
giarism.”. However, the system is ‘flawed’ and outdated [25] and presents mul-
tifaceted issues [28], here reviewed.
A Slow Multi-Stage Process. The main issues affecting the effectiveness
of peer review is the delay between paper submission and journal acceptance
for publication. The traditional peer review process is centralized around the
journals’ editor(s). The author(s) submit the manuscript to the journal where
an editorial team assesses if the paper meets the scopes of the journal and
novelty criteria. If the editorial decision is to send the manuscript for review,
the handling editor personally selects potential reviewers. The authors’ identity
is usually known to the reviewer but the reviewers’ identity is hidden to the
authors or among the other reviewers themselves (single-blind review). Review-
ers independently conduct their reviews by exposing in their reports strengths
and weaknesses of the manuscript and sometimes substantially improving the
draft. Depending on if the decision is a major or minor revision, authors are
invited to re-submit a corrected or improved version of the manuscript. The

same reviewers might be contacted again to continue the same peer review pro-
cess. This process can take multiple rounds and is a huge time investment both
for authors and reviewers. An analysis of all papers published in PubMed for a
time period of 30 years claims that the median review time is around 100 days
[19].
Lack of Recognition and Incentives. Peer reviewing is an invisible activity
purely conducted on voluntary basis, neither paid by the journals or officially
credited via standard scientific metrics (such as the ones that establish the
Impact Factor of an author). Thus, it does not lead to advancements in career
or help securing grants. Researchers are motivated to do peer review by a sense
of belonging and a desire to ‘give back’ to the community [30]. A major conse-
quence of not promoting incentives for the quality (and quantity) of peer reviews
is to either slow down publication of potentially good research which awaits for
validation [12] or let bad science be published through sloppy and uncritical
reviews.
Fraud and Misconduct. Due to the ‘publish or perish culture’ pressures,
unethical behaviour from reviewers has been occasionally reported, from abusive
behaviour towards authors [1,25] to identity fraud. Some studies have reported
an improvement in the transparency and civility of the review process when open
reports are released according to the standards of open peer review [5].
Social and Cognitive Biases. Given the fact that anonymity is usually asym-
metrically applied only for reviewers, many power related dynamics can influ-
ence the reviewers decision [26], such as gender or cultural discrimination and
social prestige of the institution. To solve this problem some journals have imple-
mented double-blind review process (the identity of both authors and reviewers
are masked) which seems to reduce the bias towards minorities.
Peer Reviews Need to Be... Reviewed. There is high variability in the
reliability and depth of reviews and a recurrent question is: “Who watches the
watchers?” [26].
Need for More Reviewers. There is a disproportion between the progressive
increase in journal publications and the number of experienced reviewers selected
for the task which demands an expansion of the reviewer’s pool including early
career scientists [1,30].
Some mild attempts to credit peer review have been handled without much
success by journals via attribution of virtual ‘badges’, certificates of performance,
citation in annual editorials [26] where performance, though, is assessed only in
terms of quantity of reviews but not quality [30].
Ants-Review: ... Incentivized Open Peer Reviews on Ethereum 21
Partnering with publishers, the startup Publons1 provides a free metric ser-
vice for tracking, verification and recognition of publications, peer reviews and
journal editing in a single researcher identifier that showcases a record of scien-
tific activity and impact based on authors’ productivity.
3 System Concept
In this paper we propose Ants-Review, a new incentivisation mechanism built on
Ethereum that issues open peer reviews to validate scientific papers while pre-
serving the anonymity of its contributors. We imagine a final paper originating
from the peer review process as a complex system that emerges from the inter-
actions between the authors and the reviewers, a whole that is more than the
sum of its parts. Therefore, the name evokes an ant colony as a self-organising
organism in which all micro-contributions of the individuals emerge into complex
behaviour. The original proposal behind this paper can be found here [27]. Its
design and implementation are exposed in the following section.
3.1 Design
Incentivization and Recognition. A popular incentive model for open source
software (OSS) is represented by bounties. Bounties are prizes or monetary
rewards given for completing a task before a deadline [33]. Examples of such plat-
forms that allow funders (bounty backers) to pay developers (bounty hunters) for
open source contributions are Gitcoin2 and The Bounties Network3. Incentives
can be represented by tokens, units of values registered on the blockchain. In the
network of the scientific community reviewers provide a service and those who
consume it (authors, journals) should be able to contribute with tokens. The
amount of tokens reflects material and symbolic recognition of the performed
work that can be statistically quantified for author-level metrics measuring the
productivity and impact of a researcher. Thus, the system acts also as a repu-
tation builder.
Transparency and Re-Usability of the Records. The peer review history,
including reviewers’ recommendations and authors’ replies, should be openly
and permanently accessible to the community (in the form of ‘open reports’ of
open peer reviews) even before articles’ publication in order to make editorial
decisions more democratic and prevent waste of knowledge. Following the exam-
ple of models offered by journals peer review consortia, such as the Neuroscience
Peer Review Consortium4 and independent companies like ResearchSquare5 and

Peerage of Science6, that provide a scientific peer review service, peer reviews in
Ants-Review will be transferable across journals (like in ‘cascading’ or ‘portable
peer reviews’).
Accountability via Pseudo-Anonymity. In order to counteract malicious
behaviour (see Sect. 2.1) affecting the integrity of the reviews but also to cor-
rectly attribute the intellectual contributions making sure there are no con-
flicts of interest, it is important to be able to track back the identities of the
contributors to a peer review report. This is possible if the platform acts like
a version control system where commits are permanent and their hashes times-
tamped. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [4] is a peer-to-peer hypermedia
protocol for storing data in a distributed file system over the internet which
guarantees data immutability and unique file identification via cryptographic
hashes. IPFS’ hashes are then stored inside the smart contracts’ state that is
timestamped into the Ethereum blocks where the transactions take place; there,
data remains unaltered and indelible. This notarization process is called proof of
existence (PoE) and allows manual verification of the existence of the document.
To prevent retaliation for negative peer reviews and to promote the participa-
tion of early researchers who might feel intimidated to judge the scientific work
of senior authors, the Ants-Review system maintains the privacy of both authors
and reviewers in a double-blind approach via Ethereum’s externally owned
accounts (EOA) addresses and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), a cryptographic
method where a party can prove to another party the possession of certain
information, like a secret key, without revealing that information (see Sect. 3.2).
Inclusiveness via Gamification. As a final step we propose that all the com-
munity is involved in the process of peer reviewing by abolishing the editorial
selection process through ‘open participation’ (or ‘open interaction’, ‘open plat-
form’ [22,23]). In this way, the pool of reviewers is enriched and allows younger
researchers to get the appropriate training through interactive feedback. More-
over, peer reviews could be evaluated, commented, criticised by the other mem-
bers of the scientific community, enabling a virtuous loop of verification. An
interesting addition would be to introduce a rank of peer reviews resulting from
the community feedback via a voting process (see Sect. 4.1). It is conceivable
that the community members that engage in assessing the quality of peer reviews
could be incentivized as well. This solution would create a self-reinforcing ethical
behaviour where the fair evaluation of peer reviews would be also in the interest
of the agents at play.
3.2 Implementation
The Ants-Review Protocol is divided into different modules responsible for the
following functionalities, as shown in the flow-chart (see Fig. 1): AntsReview,

which manages access management and the core system (see Fig. 1(a, b, f, h));
Privacy, which maintains the anonymity of the system via AZTEC Protocol (see
Fig. 1(e)); Tokenomics, which manages the incentive mechanism of the system
(see Fig. 1(c, d, e, h)).
Agents in the platform are: issuers, peer reviewers, approvers and contribu-
tors (or Anters, members of the Ants-Review Community).

Ethereum Kovan Testnet8. AntsReview implements a bounty-like system (based
on the StandardBounties contract9) where Alice (issuer) can issue an AntReview
with the function issueAntReview().
In order to create a transparent and openly accessible AntReview, Alice has
to complete a series of required tasks:
– upload of the files containing the requirements of the peer review and the
paper to be reviewed into IPFS, whose hash is stored into the Ethereum
blockchain as PoE;
– specification of a deadline in the form of a UNIX timestamp after which the
fulfillment will no longer be accepted;
– specification of the Issuers and an Approver to respectively modify the AntRe-
view and approve the peer reviews sent by the peer reviewers.
Alice or the issuers can at any time update the AntReview details (issuers, paper,
requirements, deadline) with the function changeAntReview() and add/remove
the approver with the functions addApprover() and removeApprover(). Anters
(contributors) can contribute to Alice’s AntReview with the function con-
tribute(), by specifying the amount of ANTS they are willing to send. Bob (peer
reviewer) can download the files relative to Alice’s paper and the requirements
of the peer review by leveraging the content-addressing feature of IPFS that
allows anyone to find the document using an IPFS explorer; subsequently, Bob
can submit a peer review before the deadline by fulfilling the AntReview created
by Alice, with the function fulfillAntReview(), by uploading the peer review on
IPFS, whose hash is stored into Ethereum blockchain as PoE. He can update
the peer review with the function updateReview() by uploading the new version
on IPFS. Ted (approver) can accept the peer review submitted by Bob with
the function acceptAntReview(), by specifying the amount of ANTS that will
be transferred as reward from the contract to Bob. If Alice’s AntReview does
not receive any peer review and the deadline expires, Anters can get a refund
with the function refund() for their contributions. In order to avoid residual
balance, Alice can withdraw ANTS from the AntReview’s balance, if the deadline
expires, with the function withdrawAntReview(), and the contract will transfer
the amount specified to Alice and update the balance.
Access management of the Ants-Review protocol is defined and controlled by
AntsReviewRoles (see Fig. 1(b)), implemented by leveraging AccessControl.sol
by OpenZeppelin Library10 that is used to define the Issuer and Peer Reviewer
Roles. AntsReviewRoles also integrates a circuit breaker design pattern via Paus-
able.sol by OpenZeppelin to allow the Pauser Role, granted by default to the
owner of the smart contracts, to pause (or unpause) all the functions in case of
a security emergency, such as an attack to the smart contracts.

Privacy. The anonymity of an agent in the system is achieved in two ways: via
pseudo-anonymity, granted through Ethereum’s EOAs that can pseudo-obscure
the identity of the agent, and via private transactions allowed by AZTEC [31]
Protocol’s security layer.
Pseudo-Anonymity. EOAs in Ethereum are controlled via private keys. How-
ever, the privacy is limited by the fact that both the blockchain and its transac-
tions are public. Therefore, the details of the transactions are visible to anyone
by browsing a block explorer (such as Etherscan11) and are subject to data
mining that could extract value and identify users in the blockchain.
Private Transactions. AZTEC Protocol was conceived to enable privacy
on public blockchains. It uses zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argu-
ment of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) [21] and homomorphic encryption [6] to val-
idate encrypted transactions. zk-SNARKs are ZKP that require no interaction
between prover and verifier; they are used inside the Ants-Review protocol via
the zkANTS token to allow private transactions between the agents. Future
developments will allow to leverage on permutations over Lagrange-bases for
oecumenical noninteractive arguments of knowledge (PLONK) [9], a universal
zk-SNARK construction that reduces gas costs and improves scalability.
Tokenomics. Ants-Review integrates a few ERC20 12 tokens, each of whom
plays an integral role in the functioning and anonymity of the decentralized pro-
tocol. ANTS (see Fig. 1(c)) is the primary protocol token and can be staked into
an AntReview. It is implemented by inheriting ERC20.sol from OpenZeppelin
Library with name Ants-Review and symbol ANTS. A Faucet (see Fig. 1(d)) is
implemented to distribute ANTS token on Kovan Testnet for testing purposes.
zkANTS (see Fig. 1(e)) is a wrapper of ANTS that will be used inside the proto-
col to allow for private transactions among the agents of the protocol, preserving
their anonymity as well as the amount of the AntReview reward and the con-
tributions by the Anters. It will be implemented via AZTEC Protocol [31], that
uses a cryptographic engine, ACE.sol, a contract responsible for validating the
set of AZTEC ZKPs and performing any transfer instructions involving AZTEC
notes, minted into a zkAsset, that can be converted into ERC20 tokens. In order
to implement a zkAsset called zkANTS, zkAsset.sol, a contract implementation
of a confidential token that follows the EIP-1724 standard13 will be used as a
template to build an AZTEC-compatible asset.
The current state of the art of Ants-Review is represented by version 0.2.0
(MVP) live on Ethereum Kovan Testnet (see Supplementary Material).

We have described how the Ants-Review protocol can solve the limitations of
the current peer review system (see Sect. 2.1). In particular, the lack of recog-

nition, the lack of transparency, fraud and misconduct can be solved via the
Ants-Review Protocol (see Section AntsReview in Sect 3.2); the social and cog-
nitive biases can be counteracted via anonymity granted by AZTEC Protocol
(see Section Privacy in Sect. 3.2); the slowness of the process, the need for eval-
uation of the peer reviews themselves and the need for increasing the number of
reviewers can be worked out through the creation of the community of Anters.
4.1 Future Developments
An interesting aspect of the protocol is the double function of an AntReview
respectively as a bounty and as a pool to stake ERC20 tokens like Dai14. More-
over, the duration of peer reviews consents to connect the protocol to De-Fi
services with the possibility for the community to accrue interest over time via
MakerDAO Dai Saving Rate (Pot15) or Compound16, to cite a few. Therefore, an
ERC20 pool token would be automatically released by the protocol, represent-
ing the accrued interest on the Anters’ stake over time that can be traded, sold,
or held as the Anter desires. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
[17,29] could be formed in the future to allow ANTS stakers to participate in the
governance of important aspects of the protocol, from smart contracts upgrades
to minor changes in settings across the protocol.
Finally, a protocol upgrade inspired by Discover17, a Web3 browser by Sta-
tus18 and still under investigation would allow Anters to validate peer reviews
via an upvote/downvote system that will consent the protocol to automatically
pay out the reward to the reviewers based on the votes associated with their
peer reviews.
4.2 A New Community-Driven Standard?
As Tennant points out [26], a change is already happening in the publishing
industry, especially with new born publishers opening up the review process
(BioMed Central, ELife, Frontiers, PeerJ, F1000 Research). Recently, pre-print
servers, such as arXiv and biorXiv, started integrating peer review services
into their platforms: PREreview19, PeerCommunityIn20, Review Commons21,
PrePrint Review22 and the previously mentioned Peerage of Science. This dis-
sociation of initial scientific dissemination and scientific validation will force the

publishing industry to adapt in order to keep up with the higher quality scien-
tific process offered by those alternative peer review platforms and justify their
added value [26]. In our proposal we also decoupled the peer review process from
the publishers giving it back to the scientific community and applying incentives
from tokenomics. We foresee that the future will evolve towards community-
driven peer reviews: peer reviews will be more and more independent from pub-
lishers [20], and researchers will be the ones seeking the papers to review to build
reputation within the community and not journals.
Enlarging the pool of reviewers to potentially an entire scientific community
and accelerating the whole process requires a standard for peer reviews [13]: for
example some aspects might be taken over by AI assistants (such as the Artificial
Intelligence Review Assistant (AIRA) [8] leaving to the reviewers the sole task
of evaluating the content of a paper. Building smart contracts for peer reviews
might accelerate this novel process of standardization. We hope that soon the
value of peer review as a public good will be recognized by research funders and
hiring committees.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we addressed a crucial problem within scholarly academic com-
munication: the peer review process. We have shown how blockchain technology
could provide an efficient and viable solution to open up possible directions for
a paradigm shift in scientific communication. We proposed an incentive mecha-
nism that could solve the problems of lack of acknowledgment and trust during
peer reviews. We exposed the architecture of our project for which we adopted
cutting-edge tools from the open source blockchain ecosystem.
