Abstract: As an important way to reduce emission, forestry carbon sink (FCS) has not been im-
plemented effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the effectiveness and mechanism of
applying blockchain technology in FCS projects by utilizing the differential game model. A Stack-
elberg differential game model between forest farmers and emission-controlled enterprises (ECEs)
is developed to analyze the optimal emission reduction efforts and the optimal trajectory of forest
farmers and ECEs before and after introducing blockchain technology. It is found that: (1) At the
initial stage of the utilization of blockchain technology, if blockchain technology takes a leading role
in stabilizing carbon prices, the ECEs prefer to purchase FCS instead of reducing emissions by their
own technology. On the contrary, if blockchain technology takes a leading role in stimulating the
vitality of the carbon trading market, ECEs tend to use emission abatement technology to meet the
carbon quote requirements. (2) In the later stage, the incentive and stabilizing effects of blockchain
technology on carbon prices tend to be balanced, and the emission reduction efforts of ECEs are lower
than the efforts before applying blockchain technology. (3) The application of blockchain technology
increases forest farmers’ willingness to reduce emissions because of its effection of cost reduction and
efficiency improvement. Meanwhile, blockchain technology reduces abatement costs by influencing
carbon prices. Therefore, blockchain technology improves forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts
on the whole.
Keywords: blockchain technology; forestry carbon sink; Stackelberg differential game; emission

1. Introduction
The annual report released by the United Nations in 2019 pointed out that the world
needs to take more emission reduction measures to achieve carbon neutrality. The interna-
tional organization attaches great importance to the role of forestry carbon sink (FCS) in
tackling climate change. More and more countries have included FCS in the carbon market
system and identified FCS projects that produce FCS in the form of legal provisions. In 2001,
the 7th Conference of the Parties (COP7) to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change reached the Marrakesh Agreement and agreed to use afforestation and
reforestation projects as CDM in the forestry sector; In 2007, COP13 accepted the Bali Road
Map, agreeing to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) as a
qualified FCS project; In 2009, COP15 reached the Copenhagen Agreement, based on REDD,
agreed to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, as well as the
sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon
stocks (REDD+) as a qualified FCS project. In December 2015, the United Nations Climate
Conference included forestry as a separate clause in the newly reached Paris Agreement,
clearly stipulating that after 2020, countries should take actions to protect and enhance
FCS, and continue to encourage developing countries to implement REDD+ [1]. Compared

with other emission reduction measures, FCS projects have more advantages in terms of
economic, social, and ecological benefits [2] FCS projects not only provide forest farmers
profit and employment opportunities but also provide emission reduction channels for
enterprises to control emissions [3,4].
However, the development of FCS projects is not ideal [5]. In the carbon trading
market, emission-controlled enterprises (ECEs) are important participants and demanders
of FCS. ECEs will respond flexibly to FCS based on the principle of profit maximization.
On the one hand, the main reason why forestry accounts for less than one percent of carbon
trading projects is the high project cost. FCS products need to go through six stages: design,
verification, filing, implementation and monitoring, emission reduction verification, and
emission reduction issuance. The complicated process makes forest farmers bear higher
costs [6]. In addition, the long forest growth cycle increases the uncertainty of carbon
sink output and harms the enthusiasm of forest farmers to participate in FCS severely. On
the other hand, the long development cycle and complicated processes of FCS products
result in increased likelihood of fraud because of opaque transaction information [7]. Those
characteristics not only affect the ECEs’ acceptance of prices of carbon sink but also lead to
instability of carbon trading prices.
An increase in the supply of FCS will stimulate the vitality of the carbon trading
market. The demand side will decide the optimal emission reduction plan while weighing
its emission reduction capabilities. Conversely, the increase in demand will have an
incentive effect on the supply side. In this process, the information asymmetry caused by
the imperfect FCS market and the high cost and low output caused by the characteristics of
FCS has hindered the development of FCS projects significantly. At present, the research
on FCS mostly stays on the supply side [8–10] and less on the demand side. In addition,
the research related to FCS demand carries out theoretical analysis from the aspects of
influencing factors [11] and demand mechanism [12], emphasizing risk measurement [6]
and government incentives [13,14].
Blockchain is an emerging distributed ledger technology. Its smart contract and
decentralized features [15] can lower the operating threshold of FCS projects effectively,
and provide a safe, transparent and trustworthy trading environment for both parties to
the transaction. The blockchain consensus mechanism and secure data interaction provide
a new development idea for promoting FCS transactions.
Most of the research on blockchain technology in carbon trading focuses on optimizing
the application logic [16,17] and application scenarios of the carbon emissions trading pro-
cess [18], reflecting the influence of blockchain on emission reduction model [19], trading
market [20] and price [21]. Moreover, most of the research aims to integrate the blockchain
with the power [22] and construction [23,24] industries. For FCS, a high-cost emission
reduction project, existing studies do not consider the ability of smart contract technology
to act on carbon sink suppliers and the specific manifestations of decentralization character-
istics on carbon sink transaction prices. Therefore, it is important to study the management
mechanism of blockchain technology applied to FCS projects.
In the promotion of FCS projects, forest farmers and ECEs can have different objectives
and strategies. There is a dynamic game process between them. Forest farmers’ decisions
affect the stable supply of FCS directly. The purpose of forest farmers to provide FCS is to
obtain carbon sink revenues. ECEs can achieve the national carbon quotas in two ways:
improving their technology to reduce emissions and purchasing FCS. The purpose of ECEs
is to get the maximum profit. In this process, the information asymmetry caused by the
imperfect carbon sink market and the characteristics of FCS project make it difficult for the
system to achieve the desired balance of supply and demand. Blockchain technology can
solve problems effectively and improve the enthusiasm of both sides of supply and demand.
The game model is widely used in the study of competitive strategy [25,26], which is also
applicable to the analysis of each subject’s strategy in FCS [27,28]. Therefore, taking FCS
trading as the research object, this paper constructs a Stackelberg differential game model
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 3 of 18
between forest farmers and ECEs to explore the mechanism of blockchain technology to
optimize FCS trading by assuming that carbon sink transaction prices fluctuate randomly.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, the problem is described and basic
assumptions are presented in Section 2. Then, Stackelberg differential game models before
and after applying blockchain technology are constructed and solved in Section 3. The
main results are discussed in Section 4. After that, numerical examples are presented in
Section 5 to verify the theoretical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Problem Description and Basic Assumptions
2.1. Problem Description
FCS projects have multiple subjects, complex processes, long cycles, and opaque
transactions. These characteristics lead to high development costs for FCS projects and
harm the enthusiasm of forest farmers severely [10]. High investment costs and low output
efficiency are important constraints for the development of FCS projects [2]. The “cross-
subject interaction” feature of the blockchain can set the complex and coherent FCS as a
“smart contract” to realize electronic interaction between multiple related subjects, which
can reduce costs and improve operations efficiency [29].
The long cycle and complicated process of FCS projects may cause problems such as
fraud and opaque transactions at various process nodes. In the carbon trading market, it is
necessary to ensure the authenticity and transparency of carbon emissions data [29]. How-
ever, relying on central servers for carbon trading cannot guarantee data security, which
affects the ECEs’ tolerance of the price of FCS seriously. In the blockchain carbon trading
mode, the information distributed on the data chain is maintained jointly by all participat-
ing entities, and each authorized user has the right to require historical information about
carbon trading and carbon emissions, which not only realizes collective supervision of data
but also enhances information transparency and the difficulty of information fraud [16].
In addition, with the help of the proof-of-work mechanism of blockchain technology, the
relevant reward and punishment mechanism is designed technically, which improves the
ECE’s tolerance of FCS and flattens the price fluctuations [20].
There are two main entities involved in FCS trading: forest farmers and ECEs. First,
forest farmers increase output of FCS by improving management capabilities and other
methods. Second, ECEs choose to apply technology to reduce emissions or purchase FCS
based on their emission reduction capabilities, such as initial carbon allowances, low-
carbon technology research and development costs. This process can be modeled as a
Stackelberg differential game between forest farmers and ECEs. In the first stage, forest
farmers decide their efforts level of emission reduction. In the second stage, ECEs decide
their efforts level of emission reduction.
2.2. Assumptions and Model Parameters
Differential game is used commonly to construct emission reduction models [27,28].
According to the structure of differential game and the FCS trading process, we make the
following assumptions.
(1) The management ability of forest farmers will have an impact on the number of FCS.
The lower management level of forest farmers will lead to overdensity or oversparseness
of forests, poor quality of forests, and diseases of insect pests and forest fires caused by
inadequate supervision. Sufficient expected income can ensure the full investment of
forest farmers to improve their management level. Therefore, forest farmers need to weigh
cost and income to achieve optimal efficiency. Reference to the convexity assumption
of cost [30], assume that the forest farmers’ emission reduction cost is a convex function of
forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts.
CF(t) =
1
2
ηFF2(t) (1)
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 4 of 18
where CF(t) is the forest farmer’s abatement cost function; F(t) is the forest farmer’s
emission reduction efforts; ηF is the forest farmer’s abatement cost coefficient which reflects
the impact of forest farmers’ emission reduction input level changes on the cost.
(2) The rate of FCS is related to its age closely [31]. Usually, the forest age is divided
into young, middle-aged, near-mature, mature, and over-mature. Young and middle-aged
forests have relatively fast carbon sequestration rates, while near-mature, mature, and
over-mature forests have balanced carbon absorption and release due to the decline in
growth rates [32]. The relationship between forest carbon density and forest age can be
expressed by a logistic growth curve [33,34]. The evolution law of FCS can be described as
e(t) =
Q
1 + ce−rt (2)
where Q is the final carbon sink that the forest can provide based on its own growth law; r
is the growth factor of carbon sinks per unit time; c is a constant; and t is the growth time
of trees. The differential equation expression of Equation (2) is
ė(t) = re(t)
(
1− e(t)
Q
)
(3)
(3) Assuming that the carbon sink price x at time t is a random variable in the [0, P],
the probability density function of x is f (x), the mean is ζ, and the variance is τ2. The
increase in the mean ζ of the price random variable x is used to describe the incentive effect
of the blockchain on the carbon sink market, and the decrease in the variance τ2 indicates
the promotion of the blockchain in stabilizing the carbon price. The price after applying
blockchain technology is assumed to be
xB = αx + (β− α)ζ (4)
where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, β ≥ 1; 1 − α and β − 1 are the incentive coefficients of blockchain
technology in stabilizing market prices and stimulating the vitality of the carbon trading
market. Obviously, the mean of xB is βζ, and the variance is α2τ2.
(4) FCS is affected mainly by internal and external factors. The internal factors are
the number of carbon sinks based on the growth of forest trees [34]. The external factors
mainly include forest farmers’ scientific tending of forest trees and supervision abilities [35].
Hence, the FCS E(t) at time t can be denoted as
Ė(t) = ξFF(t) + re(t)
(
1− e(t)
Q
)
− σE(t) (5)
where ξF is the influence coefficient of forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts on FCS,
and σ is the influence coefficient of random factors on FCS. Equation (5) reflects the role of
three influencing factors of carbon sink growth. The first is the emission reduction efforts
of forest farmers, the second is forest growth, and the third is other uncertain factors.
(5) The demand of ECEs on FCS is related mainly to the initial carbon allowance ẽ and
CCER K(t) [36,37]. Generally, the CCER is less than the carbon quota. Hence, the demand
of ECEs on FCS is the difference between the carbon allowance and CCER. That is,
D(t) = ẽ− K(t) (6)
where the K(t) of ECEs is related to its emission reduction efforts S(t). In addition, ECEs
choose emission reduction strategies based on supply of FCS in the market [38]. When the
quantity of FCS increases, the willingness of ECEs to achieve carbon allowances through
the purchase of FCS increases. Then, the differential state expression of K(t) is
K̇(t) = ξSS(t)− λE(t)− εK(t) (7)
where ξS is the influence coefficient of ECEs’ emission reduction efforts on K(t); λ is the in-
fluence coefficient of FCS on K(t); ε is the influence coefficient produced by random factors.
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 5 of 18
Similarly, assume that the technical abatement cost of ECEs is a convex function of
emission reduction efforts.
CS(t) =
1
2
ηSS2(t) (8)
where ηS is the abatement cost coefficient of ECEs, which reflects the degree of impact of
the emission reduction efforts of ECEs on the cost.
(6) The government will subsidize the costs of implementing FCS projects to encour-
age forest farmers participating in FCS projects. Assume that the subsidy ratio is ϕF and
0 < ϕF < 1. That is, the government shares the forest farmers’ cost. In addition, the gov-
ernment will adopt special funds and other incentive measures to mobilize the enthusiasm
of ECEs to reduce emissions. Assuming that the subsidy ratio is ϕS and 0 < ϕS < 1, it will
share the abatement costs of ECEs.
(7) The forest farmers and ECEs seek to maximize their benefits during the time
interval [0, T]. Assume that forest farmers and ECEs have the same positive discount rate ρ
and the daily operating income of ECEs is π. The main felling and thinning of forest trees
are not considered.
For simplicity, the time unit t will be omitted in the following text. Based on the above
assumptions, related symbols and definitions are further described as follows:

3. The Model and the Solutions
3.1. Before Applying Blockchain Technology
Forest farmers’ income from carbon sink trading is xD. Abatement cost is (1− ϕF)CF.
Hence, the expected return of forest farmers is
JF =
∫ T
0
e−ρt[DM− (1− ϕF)CF]dt (9)
where M =
∫ P
0 x f (x)dx is the expected price of FCS.
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 6 of 18
ECEs purchase FCS after considering the economic feasibility of technical emission
reduction. The cost of purchasing FCS is xD. The technical emission reduction cost of ECEs
is CS. Hence, the expected return of ECEs is
JS =
∫ T
0
e−ρt[π − DM− (1− ϕS)CS]dt (10)
In the next , according to the Stackelberg differential game analysis framework, we
solve the optimal strategy of forest farmers and ECEs.
First, the optimal decision-making model of ECEs is as follows:
max

JS =

e−ρt[π − DM− (1− ϕS)CS]dt
s.t. Ė = ξFF + re
(

)
− σE
K̇ = ξSS− λE− εK
E(0) = E0
K(0) = K0 (11)
From model (11), the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation of ECEs’ optimal
return is

+ V′SK(ξSS− λE− εK)
} (12)
It can be found that Equation (12) is a concave function of S. Therefore, the global
optimal solution exists. The first-order condition of S is
S∗ =
V′SKξS
(1− ϕS)ηS
(13)
Second, the optimal decision-making model of forest farmers are as follows:

Substitute Equation (13) into Equation (15), it can get

According to the structure of Equations (18) and (19), we assume that

VF(E, K) = v1E + v2K + v3 (21)
where u1 . . . u3 and v1 . . . v3 are the undetermined coefficients. Substitute the partial deriva-
tives of E and K in Equations (18)–(21), respectively. Comparing Equations (18) and (19)
with the coefficients of the similar terms on both sides of the equation, we can obtain
u1 = v1 =

4. Discussions and Management Implications
4.1. Discussion
In order to show the role of blockchain technology in FCS trading, we compared the
emission reduction efforts of forest farmers and ECEs before and after the introduction of
blockchain technology.
(1) According to Equations (26) and (43), S is proportional to x. Therefore, if the price
of FCS increases, ECEs tend to reduce emissions by technology. Contrarily, if the price
of FCS decreases, due to the high cost of emission reduction technology, ECEs tend to
purchase FCS.
At the initial stage of the utilization of blockchain technology, it needs to be in-
tegrated with the market effectively, and through continuous adjustments to adapt to
the law of market development [39]. Comparing S before and after the introduction of
blockchain technology:
∆S = S∗ − S∗B =
ξS
{
M−
∫ αP+(β−α)ζ
0
α[αx + (β− α)ζ] f (x)dx
}
ηS(1− ϕS)(ρ + ε)
(47)
The necessary condition for ∆S > 0 is P > αP + (β− α)ζ, and x > α[αx + (β− α)ζ],
that is
P >
β− α
1− α
ζ; x > α
β− α
1− α
ζ (48)
Hence, the lower β is, β → 1, β−α
1−α → 1, and then P → 1. This indicates a smaller
price fluctuation range. That is, 1 − α is large, and αβ < 1 is easier to achieve. The
Equation (48) is established. Therefore, when blockchain technology plays a leading role
in stabilizing carbon sink prices, ECEs are more inclined to purchase FCS to meet carbon
quota requirements, and S will decrease.
The necessary condition for ∆S < 0 is P < αP + (β− α)ζ, and x < α[αx + (β− α)ζ],
that is
P <
β− α
1− α
ζ; x < α
β− α
1− α
ζ (49)
When β and αβ are larger, Equation (49) is easier to hold. The larger the β, the greater
the deviation of P from ζ, which means that the price fluctuation range is larger, and α
is larger. That is, when blockchain technology plays a leading role in stimulating carbon
trading market, ECEs are more inclined to achieve carbon quota requirements through
their emission reduction technology, and S increases.
In the later stage of the utilization of blockchain technology, the incentive and stabiliz-
ing effects of blockchain technology on carbon prices tend to balance [39], and the role of
blockchain technology will be analyzed in the numerical example.
(2) According to Equations (27) and (44), F is inversely proportional to ηF, which con-
firms that the current high investment cost of FCS is a restrictive factor in the development
of the project. This inhibits the enthusiasm of forest farmers. Furthermore, ξF and x are
proportional to F, which shows that the higher the efficiency of converting efforts into
income, the more willing forest farmers are to participate in FCS projects. In addition, ϕF is
proportion to F. Therefore, the higher the government’s cost–sharing ratio, the more it can
provide incentives for forest farmers.
Comparing Equations (27) and (44), we can find that the impact of blockchain on F is
reflected in the price, cost, and output efficiency. Driven by the blockchain, the government
only needs to share a small proportion of the cost to obtain better emission reduction effects
than before, which reduces the government’s economic burden.
The impact of blockchain on carbon prices is the effect of blockchain on the car-
bon trading market. The specific mechanism of the two effects will be analyzed in the
numerical example.
(3) From Equations (28) and (45), the blockchain affects E by influencing F. The ef-
fect produced by acting on ξF is greater than the effect produced by acting on ηF. From
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 11 of 18
Equations (29) and (46), K follows E to make changes. In addition, x affects K by influenc-
ing S.
4.2. Management Implications
Based on the above discussion, we propose the following actions.
(1) The government should regulate policies on carbon quota and subsidies dynamically.
The government’s policy should be adjusted dynamically according to the different
growth stages of the forest. Implementing emission reduction commitments has become an
important way for China to contribute to the construction of global ecological civilization.
Factors such as national economic development, land prices, timber prices, and interna-
tional carbon sink prices will all have an impact on the supply of FCS [13,31]. In addition,
the quantity of FCS has shown an S-shaped growth. Before the turning point of the curve,
the annual increment of FCS will increase. At this stage, the government should increase
carbon allowances and encourage ECEs to purchase FCS appropriately. After the turning
point of the curve, the government should reduce carbon allowances appropriately. In
this way, blockchain technology will reduce more effectively the cost of forest farmers
participating in FCS. Therefore, the government should reduce the proportion of emission
reduction subsidies to forest farmers.
(2) The key to forest farmers’ decision-making is the government carbon quota distri-
bution policy.
As the main suppliers of FCS, forest farmers are driven by profits to participate in FCS
projects. Forest farmers’ decision-making depends on multiple factors, such as farmers’
own factors, social policy factors, risks, and time preferences [6,12]. Among them, project
costs and market demand are two key factors affecting forest farmers’ participation in
FCS. The market demand is mainly related to the national carbon allowances and carbon
sink prices. After applying blockchain technology, carbon allowances is the key point that
forest farmers need to consider. Therefore, forest farmers should share information with
the government to formulate a reasonable carbon quota.
(3) The key to ECEs’ decision making is the application stage of blockchain technology
and the predictive ability of FCS.
The decision making of ECEs needs to consider the application stage of blockchain
technology. In the early stage of the introduction of blockchain technology, ECEs need to
pay special attention to market changes and adjust emission reduction measures in time.
In the later stage of the introduction of blockchain technology, ECEs need to plan emission
reduction measures in advance based on the characteristics of the forest growth cycle to
obtain the greatest benefits.
5. A Numerical Example
In this section, we assign values to relevant parameters in the transactions between
forest farmers and ECEs to verify the results of the above models.
5.1. Changes in S before and after Applying the Blockchain Technology
Assume ϕS = 0.3, ηS = 0.1, ρ = 0.9, ε = 0.1, σ = 0.1, ϕF = 0.4, ηF = 0.1, x ∼ U[0, 50].
The results are shown in Figure 1.
From the area of the horizontal plane in Figure 1, it can be seen that blockchain
technology reduces the willingness of ECEs to reduce emissions through technology by
stabilizing carbon prices and stimulating the vitality of the carbon trading market. Only
when α and β are larger, the amount of stimuli for the carbon trading market by blockchain
technology is far greater than the degree of stable carbon prices. In this situation, carbon
prices tends to be unstable and high. ECEs are more willing to use their technology to
reduce emissions to meet the carbon quota requirements, and emission reduction efforts S
will increase.

Figure 1. The influence of x on S.
At the initial stage of the utilization of blockchain technology, it needs to be integrated
with the market effectively, and through continuous adjustments to adapt to the law of
market development. If blockchain technology takes stabilizing carbon prices as the leading
role, the willingness of ECEs to purchase FCS increases, and the willingness of technology
to reduce emissions decreases. The emission reduction efforts of ECEs will be lower than
the level before the introduction of blockchain technology. If blockchain technology takes
the leading role in stimulating the carbon trading market, the price of carbon trading is
relatively high, and ECEs will tend to achieve carbon quota requirements through their
technology to reduce emissions. In the later stage of the utilization of blockchain technology,
the incentive and stabilizing effects of blockchain technology on carbon prices tend to
balance, (α, β)→ (0.5, 1.5), and the emission reduction efforts of ECEs are lower than the
efforts before the applying blockchain technology.
5.2. The Relationship between S and ξS, ηS
From Equations (26) and (43), we can find that the emission reduction efforts of ECEs
are related to abatement cost ηS, emission reduction efficiency ξS, and price x. Assume
that α = 0.5 and β = 1.5 after the introduction of blockchain technology. ρ = 0.9, ε = 0.1,
ϕS = 0.3. The results are shown in Figure 2.
From Figure 2, it can be seen that the cost generated by the emission reduction behavior
of ECEs suppresses its emission reduction behavior. The greater the emission reduction
efficiency, the higher the emission reduction investment efficiency of ECEs. This encourages
emission reduction behaviors of ECEs. Blockchain technology has stabilized carbon prices
and stimulated the vitality of the carbon trading market, so that ECEs tend to purchase FCS
while maximizing their profits and reducing the willingness of ECEs to reduce emissions
through their technology.

Figure 2. The influence of S , ξS and ηS.
5.3. Changes in F before and after Applying the Blockchain Technology
Forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts are related to the abatement cost, the effi-
ciency of forest farmers’ input into carbon sinks, and government subsidies. Blockchain
technology reduces FCS operating costs and improves output efficiency through smart
contract technology. That is, ηF and ξF are changed. Assume that before using blockchain
technology, ξF = 2, ηF = 0.1, after using blockchain technology, ξFB = 3, ηFB = 0.05. The
discount rate ρ = 0.9, the influence coefficient of random factors σ = 0.1, the government
subsidy coefficient ϕF = 0.4, λ = 0.1, x ∼ U[0, 50]. The results are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Changes in F before and after applying the blockchain technology.
As shown in Figure 3, blockchain technology greatly encourages forest farmers to
reduce emissions by reducing the costs of FCS project. This improves output efficiency,
stabilizes carbon prices, and stimulates the vitality of the carbon trading market. When the
influence of blockchain technology on stabilizing carbon prices is dominant and the price
is low, forest farmers will be less motivated to reduce emissions, and F will be lower than
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11697 14 of 18
before the introduction of blockchain technology. If the price is stable at a high level, the
market demand will decrease. At this point, forest farmers will reduce their input based
on maximizing benefits, and F will decrease. In reality, such a situation does not exist. In
addition, according to the principle of supply and demand, the market will adjust prices
spontaneously. Under normal circumstances, the (α, β) will fluctuate within a small range
of (0.5, 1.5).
To be more clear, we decompose the effect of blockchain technology on the FCS project
and carbon trading market. The results are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. An exploded view of the role of blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology optimizes the project by reducing costs and improving output
efficiency and increasing forest farmers’ willingness to reduce emissions. Thus, the effect is
greater than the impact of adjusting prices. When the carbon price is stable at a low level,
forest farmers will reduce input and avoid additional expenditures to maximize benefits.
When the carbon trading market reaches a stable state through its evolution, (α, β)→
(0.5, 1.5), forest farmers make appropriate adjustments to the scale of input by predicting
returns. When the blockchain technology only acts on the project, the forest farmers’
emission reduction efforts is reduced to avoid unnecessary expenditures. However, forest
farmers’ optimal emission reduction efforts are still higher than before using blockchain
technology, which has encouraged forest farmers to reduce emissions.
Therefore, blockchain technology mainly affects F from two aspects: (1) reducing costs
and improving output efficiency, and then, increasing forest farmers’ willingness to reduce
emissions; (2) stabilizing carbon prices and stimulating the vitality of the carbon trading
market. Forest farmers make a more accurate forecast of the future benefits, then adjust the
investment ratio to maximize its benefits appropriately.
5.4. The Optimal Trajectory for FCS and ECEs’ Emission Reductions before and after Applying
Blockchain Technology
Assume that E0 is ten thousand million tons and K0 is one thousand tons. Before the
introduction of blockchain technology, ξF = 2, ηF = 0.1, after using blockchain technology,
ξFB = 3, ηFB = 0.05. The discount rate ρ = 0.9, the influence coefficient of random factors
σ = 0.1, ε = 0.1. The final amount of carbon sinks that forests can provide Q is 1 million
tons, the carbon sink unit time growth factor r = 0.05, and the government’s emission
reduction compensation coefficient ϕF = 0.4, ϕS = 0.3, λ = 0.1. The results are shown in
Figure 5.

Figure 5. The optimal trajectory for FCS and ECEs’ emission reductions before and after applying
blockchain technology.
From Figure 5, it can be seen that blockchain technology improves the evolution
trajectory of FCS and reduces the willingness of ECEs to reduce emissions through carbon
abatement technology. In addition, the greater the growth rate of FCS, the lower the growth
rate of technological emission reductions of ECEs.

6. Conclusions
This paper makes a game analysis on FCS trading. By introducing blockchain technol-
ogy, we find the following main conclusions.
(1) The emission reduction efforts of ECEs are affected mainly by FCS prices, abatement
costs, and government subsidies. ECEs choose emission reduction methods with the
goal of economic maximization. (1) At the initial stage of the utilization of blockchain
technology, if blockchain technology takes stabilizing carbon prices as the leading
role, the willingness of ECEs to purchase FCS will increase and the willingness of
technology to reduce emissions will decrease. The emission reduction efforts of ECEs
will be lower than the level before applying blockchain technology. If blockchain
technology takes the leading role in stimulating the carbon trading market, the price
of carbon trading is relatively high, and ECEs will tend to achieve carbon quota
requirements through their technology to reduce emissions. The emission reduction
efforts of ECEs will be higher than the level before applying blockchain technology.
(2) In the later stage of the utilization of blockchain technology, the incentive and
stabilizing effects of blockchain technology on carbon prices tend to balance, and
the emission reduction efforts of ECEs are lower than the efforts before applying
blockchain technology.
(2) Blockchain technology affects forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts in two aspects.
(1) Optimizing FCS projects from the inside. Blockchain technology reduces costs
and improves output efficiency, then increases forest farmers’ willingness to reduce
emissions; (2) Adjusting the price of carbon sinks. In the later stage of the utilization
of blockchain technology, forest farmers make a more accurate forecast of the future
profit, and then adjust the investment ratio to maximize its benefits appropriately be-
cause the application of blockchain technology stabilizes carbon prices and stimulates
the vitality of the carbon trading market. To sum up, applying blockchain technology
encourages forest farmers’ emission reduction efforts, and the effect of blockchain
technology on the optimization of FCS projects is higher than the effect of adjusting
carbon prices.
(3) Blockchain technology optimizes the trajectory for FCS and ECEs’ emission reductions.
Blockchain technology increases FCS. The emission reductions of ECEs follow changes
in FCS. Blockchain affects the emission reductions of ECEs by changing the price and
quantity of FCS. The greater the growth rate of FCS, the lower the growth rate of
technological emission reductions of ECEs.
