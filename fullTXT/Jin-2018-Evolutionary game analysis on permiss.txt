Abstract�� In view of the problem of over-requesting 
permissions in the current smartphone terminal, it is 
great significant to research the factors of the service 
providers to select the permission request policy. In this 
paper, we assume that providers are bounded rational 
and obtain the payoff matrix based on the two groups of 
providers with different request policies, which are the 
"Over-request Permissions" and "Request basic 
permissions". Then we establish an evolutionary game 
model for privacy protection between the two groups 
and find out the stability policy of the model. Initial 
results demonstrate that whether the provider adopts 
the "Request basic permissions" policy depends on four 
factors, which are revenue increase ratio, credit loss, 
users churn cost and self-attractiveness when over-
requesting permissions. And the establishment of 
privacy alarm mechanism not only can improve the 
users’ privacy awareness, but also increase the users 
churn cost when providers over-requesting permissions.

 I.     INTRODUCTION 
Smartphone app markets have undergone explosive 
growth in recent years. Various app markets offer a wide 
range of apps in all aspects of human life, such as social 
life, smart travelling, health care and so forth. Android app 
markets, which share the largest user base, have gained a 
tremendous momentum over the past years since its first 
launch in 2008. A market research has shown that the 
worldwide downloads of smartphone apps have reached 19 
billion in the first quarter of 2018[1]. As users rely more on 
smartphone apps, the privacy and security problems become 
more prominent. For service providers and users, over-
requesting permissions is one of the most serious problems 
in the current smartphone terminal. Previous research[2] has 
shown that more than 70% of smartphone apps request to 
collect information irrelevant to the main function of the 
app. Rich personal information has a significant economic 
value that constitutes an incentive for increasing the amount 
of user information collected. Thus, in the absence of 
external constraints, the economic value drives the 
providers to request more permissions than the minimum 
required to deploy a given effectively and securely. These 
providers can not only steal user’s privacy information, but 
also bring about financial loss of the users by making phone 
calls and sending messages secretively. Indeed, many 
smartphone users are concerned about the behavior of 
service providers over-requesting permissions, and 
researchers also suggest that privacy has become an 
important factor in the competitive market for service 
providers[3].  
In this paper, we assume that each provider is bounded 
rationality and introduce the evolutionary game theory to 
construct the evolutionary game model of the two providers 
on the choice of request policy. With using the stability 
principle of the differential equation to analyze the 
mechanism of action between the providers, we can find out 
the evolutionary stability policy and the corresponding 
condition. Finally, we use Matlab to carry out the simulation 
research, which can intuitively reflect the evolution 
direction and verify the correctness of the evolutionary 
game model. The corresponding privacy protection policies 
and recommendations can be put forward based on the

results of our analysis. Compared with existing protection 
methods for smartphones, our main contributions are as: 
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply 
evolutionary game into research permission request policy 
of service providers, which can fundamentally solve the 
problem of over-requesting permissions. 
• The results of our analysis have proven that establishing 
a privacy alarm mechanism can spontaneously push service 
providers to only request basic permissions. 
II.    REALATED WORK 
Previous research more emphasis on privacy issues in the 
android operating system because of its huge market and the 
vulnerability of Android application. From the perspective 
of life cycle, these applications usually go through the 5 
phases which are development, download, installation, 
runtime and uninstallation phases. And the current research 
on privacy protection focuses on the download, installation, 
runtime phases. During the download phase, many 
researchers propose a number of alternative privacy 
instructions aiming at guiding users to download apps which 
are less intrusive. For example, Kraus et al.[4] provided a 
visualization of permission-related statistical data to enable 
the users to assess the security of the app. The approach 
proposed by Harbach[5] to leverage the rich set of personal 
information available on smartphones and use personalized 
examples to communicate risks. Moreover, Lin et al.[6] 
explored users’ mental models of smartphone privacy by 
crowdsourcing users’ expectations of apps’ sensitive 
resource usage. During the installation and runtime phases, 
Enck et al.[7] presented a security service named Kirin in 
Android, where they pre-define a set of potentially 
dangerous combinations of permissions and refuse to install 
the apps which request such combinations. They also 
proposed TaintDroid[8], a system-wide dynamic taint 
tracking multiple sources of privacy information. In 
addition, Thanigaivelan et al.[9] proposed CoDRA, an 
access control system that offers context-based highly fine-
grained policy and dynamically reconfigurable control to 
enforce various policy configurations at different levels of 
system operations.  
As an important branch of economics, game theory has 
been widely used in the research of predicting individual 
behavior and analyzing their optimization policies. Zhou et 
al.[10] surveyed the theories, methods and applications on 
how game theory is applied in privacy protection. Piero et 
al.[3] revealed that provider competition can reduce such 
information requests with a game-theoretic approach. Zhang 
et al.[11] proposed a pricacy protection model based on 
game theory from the point of view of realizing benefits 
from the access with the goal of allowing access to a certain 
extent while denying further access when disclosure of 
privacy is about to happen. 
III.    BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND MODEL BUILDING 
In a natural environment that does not consider other 
constraints, the providers of the same service are treated as 
a system in which there are two different bounded 
rationality groups 1 and 2, and the app developed by each 
provider is highly homogeneous. The providers in group 1 
and 2 are randomly sampled to match and game. The 
members extracted from Group 1 are called provider A, and 
the members extracted from group 2 are called provider B. 
Because both the provider A and B are bounded rationality, 
it is difficult to make the optimal permission request policy 
in a decision. Therefore, the policy adjustment between A 
and B is a dynamic process that is constantly changing. To 
simplify the problem, we only consider a 2�2 game, that is, 
the policy space of providers in group 1 and 2 is {Over-
request permissions, Request basic permissions}. "Over-
request Permissions" indicates that the most of permissions 
are not necessary for the purpose of providing the service, 
while "Request basic permissions" indicates that the app 
developed by the provider only requests permissions 
dependent on the provision of personalized services. Next 
we further make the following assumptions: 
(1) The proportion of providers which Over-request 
permissions is x (0 � x � 1), and that of providers which 
request basic permission is 1� x in group 1. Similarly in 
group 2, the proportion of providers which Over-request 
permissions is y (0 � y � 1), and that of providers which 
request basic permission is 1� y. 
(2) Suppose both the provider A and B adopt the 
"Request basic permissions" policy, their normal payoffs 
are Ra, Rb, Ra > 0, Rb > 0; 
(3) Suppose both the provider A and B adopt the "Over-
request Permissions" policy, their payoffs are 
Ra+αRa�Ca�Va,  Rb+βRb�Cb�Vb. This is the reason that 
providers can acquire and mine users’ privacy information 
more, but need to take some risks of users churn and credit 
loss when requesting permissions excessively. � and β 
indicate the ability of the provider A and B to increase their 
own payoff by requesting more permissions respectively. 
The higher the value is, the stronger the ability to increase 
payoffs. Ca and Cb indicate the risks of users churn of the 
provider A and B, while Va and Vb indicate the risks of 
credit loss of the provider A and B respectively. C is an 
increasing function of V. 
(4) When the provider A and B adopt the "Over-request 
permissions" and "Request basic permissions" policies 
respectively, the payoff of the provider A is Ra+αRa�Ca�Va. 
Some of the users who have been lost from the customers of 
the provider A have two choices. One is no longer using the 
similar service provided by any provider, and the other is to 
use the same service provided by the provider B. As a result, 
the payoff of the provider B is Rb+kbCa, where kb represents

the attractiveness of the provider B to the users lost by the 
provider A. 
(5) When the provider A and B adopt the "Request basic 
permissions" and "Over-request permissions" policies 
respectively, similar to (4), the payoffs of the provider A 
and B is Ra+kaCb, (1+β)Rb�Cb�Vb. 
Based on the above hypothesis, the payoff matrix of 
evolutionary game is constructed, as shown in table 1.

IV.    ECOLUTIONARY GAME ANALYSIS 
A.   The equilibrium point of evolutionary game 
The expected payoffs UA1 and UA2 of the provider A 
adopting the "Over-request permissions" and "Request basic 
permissions" policy are: 
UA1 = y[(1+α)Ra�Ca�Va]+(1�y)[(1+α)Ra�Ca�Va] (1) 
UA2 = y(Ra+kaCb)+ (1�y)Ra (2)  
Then the average payoff UA of the provider A is: 
UA = xUA1+(1�x) UA2 (3) 
According to the Malthusian dynamic equation, the 
replicated dynamic equation of the provider A is:

Similarly, the expected payoffs UB1, UB2 and the average

UB2 = x( Rb+kbCa)+ (1�x)Rb (6)

V.    SIMULATION ANALYSIS 
In order to show the evolutionary game process of two 
providers more intuitively, and verify the correctness of the 
evolutionary game model, the evolutionary stability policy 
of different model parameters in the game process is 
analyzed by using MATLAB r2015b.  
 
Figure 1. Simulation results for stability point (0,0) 
    When 0 < α < α1, 0 < β < β1, the evolutionary stability 
point of the game model is (0,0). Supposing Ra = Rb = 5, Ca 
= Cb = 1, Va = Vb = 0.5, ka = kb = 0.5, α = 0.1, β = 0.2, it can 
meet 0 < α < α1, 0 < β < β1. In order to verify the 
effectiveness of the evolutionary game model, the initial 
ratio of the provider A (group 1) and B (group 2) using the 
"Over-request permission" policy set to [10%, 90%] as step 
size is 0.05. The evolutionary results are shown in Figure 1. 
It can be obviously observed that the ratio of the "Over-
request permissions" policy begins to decline gradually and 
tend to the evolutionary stability point (0,0) from the initial 
point with the increase of evolutionary steps. This means 
that the providers in both groups ultimately adopt the 
"Request basic permissions" policy. This phenomenon can 
be further explained as follows. When two groups are 
relatively low in their ability to increase their own payoffs, 
the providers who request permissions independent the 
service can’t bring more benefits to themselves, instead of 
taking the risks of users churn and credit loss. Therefore, all 
providers will eventually adopt the "Request basic 
permissions" policy after constantly adjusting the policy. In 
addition, we can find that the proportion of the "Over-

request Permissions" policy in a group and the providers’ 
ability to increase their payoffs are important factors that 
affect the convergence rate.  
When 0 < α < α1, β1 < β < β2, the evolutionary stability 
point of the game model is (0,1). Supposing that α = 0.2, β = 
0.36 and other parameter settings are consistent with the 
above conditions, it can meet 0 < α < α1, β1 < β < β2. 
Similarly, the initial ratio of the provider A (group 1) and B 
(group 2) using the "Over-request permission" policy also 
set to [10%, 90%] as step size is 0.05. The evolutionary 
results are shown in Figure 2. The ratio of the "Over-request 
permissions" policy that the provider A adopted begins to 
decline gradually with the increase of evolutionary steps. On 
the contrary, the ratio of the provider B adopting the "Over-
request permissions" policy begins to rise steadily and tend 
to the evolutionary stability point (0,1). It can be seen from 
the figure that when the gap between the two providers of 
the ability to increase the payoffs is relatively large, the 
advantage policy of the providers with higher ability is 
"Over-request permissions". They can unlock more value of 
users by requesting more permission and ignore the risks of 
users churn and credit loss. While the advantage policy of 
the others is "Request basic permissions", they can adopt the 
policy to attract the users who highly value the privacy 
information and provide their credibility, thereby increasing 
their revenues. 
 
Figure 2. Simulation results for stability point (0,1) 
When α > α2, β > β2, the evolutionary stability point of the 
game model is (1,1). Supposing that α = 0.5, β = 0.6 and 
other parameter settings are consistent with the above two 
conditions, it can meet α > α2, β > β2. The evolutionary 
results are shown in Figure 3. The ratio of the "Over-request 
permissions" policy begins to rise gradually and tend to the 
evolutionary stability point (1,1) from the initial point with 
the increase of evolutionary steps. In this case, the revenues 
of the providers by requesting more permissions are greater 
than that by adopting "Request basic permissions" policy to 
attract high-sensitivity users. Therefore, all providers will 
eventually adopt the "Over-request permissions" policy after 
constantly adjusting the policy.

VI.    CONCLUSION 
   In this paper, we apply evolutionary game method to the 
privacy protection of smartphone and establish the 
evolutionary game model between service providers. Then 
we carry out an evolutionary simulation analysis by 
obtaining the replicated dynamic equation and evolutionary 
stability policy. In the process of repeated games, the two 
sides constantly adjust their policies according to their own 
profits and finally reach the stability policy. The results 
show that whether the provider adopts the "request basic 
permission" policy is closely related to the revenue increase 
ratio when over-requesting permissions. The revenue 
increase ratio is also collected with the cost of users churn 
and credibility loss and self-attractiveness. Whit the increase 
of the revenue increase ratio, it may occur that four 
evolutionary stability policies. In order to promote the 
evolution of the game model toward "Request basic 
permissions", the following two decisions can be taken. 
(1) Set up the privacy alarm mechanism to improve the 
users’ privacy awareness and increase the cost of users 
churn and credibility loss when the providers adopt the 
"Over-request Permissions" policy, which can 
spontaneously and effectively push providers to adopt the 
"Over-request Permissions" policy. The privacy alarm 
mechanism can be achieved through the improved methods 
such as Majid[13], G€okhan[14], etc. 
(2) When the user churn of the provider’s competitor with 
adopting the "Over-request Permissions" policy is large 
enough, the provider can increase their revenues by 
increasing their attractiveness, thereby guaranteeing their 
own benefits without violating users’ privacy. 
We have demonstrated that the privacy alarm mechanism 
can not only improve the users’ privacy awareness, but also 
in turn to promote the provider to adopt the "Request basic 
permissions" policy. In our future work, we intend to 
consider how to establish a personalized and reasonable 
alarm mechanism.
