Abstract: Energy management and exchange have increasingly shifted from concentrated to hi-
erarchical modes. Numerous issues have arisen in the decentralized energy sector, including the
storage of customer data and the need to ensure data integrity, fairness, and accountability in the
transaction phase. The problem is that in the field of the innovative technology of blockchain and
its applications, with the energy sector still in the developmental stages, there is still a need for
more research to understand the full capacity of the technology in the field. The main aim of this
work was to investigate the state of the current research of blockchain technologies as well as their
application within the field of energy. This work also set out to identify certain research gaps and
provide a set of recommendations for future directions. Among these research gaps is the application
of blockchain in decentralized storage, the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence, and
security and privacy concerns, which have not received much attention despite their importance.
An analysis of fifty-seven carefully reviewed studies revealed that the emerging blockchain which
provides privacy-protection technologies in cryptography and other areas that can be integrated to
address users’ privacy concerns is another aspect that needs further investigation. Grid operations,
economies, and customers will all learn from blockchain technology as it provides disintermediation,
confidentiality, and tamper-proof transfers. Moreover, it provides innovative ways for customers
and small solar generators to participate more actively in the electricity sector and to benefit from
their properties. Blockchains are a rapidly evolving field of research and growth. A study of this
emerging technology is necessary to increase comprehension, to educate the body of expertise on
blockchains, and to realize its potential. This study recommends that future work investigates
the potential application of blockchain in the energy sector as well as the challenges that face its
implementation from the perspective of policy makers. This future approach will enable researchers
to direct their focus to the case studies approach, which will facilitate and ease the application of
blockchain technology.

1. Introduction
In recent years, blockchain (Table S1) has attracted the interest of both academics and
business. It has been branded the “next great technical innovation” since the Internet of
Things (IoTs), as it is supposed to revolutionize not just our connectivity and information
technology framework, but also the very fabric of our communities [1]. Intermediaries
would no longer be needed outside the technological network provision since blockchain
offers cryptographic confidence by technology architecture, allowing anonymous parties
to transact without the risk of fraud. In conjunction with smart contracts, blockchain offers
transaction record transparency and imposes contract-defined rules on all transactions, and

regulatory and legal enforcement checks will become a requirement for the completion of
any transaction [2].
In the energy sector, energy management and exchange have increasingly shifted from
concentrated to hierarchical modes. Numerous issues have arisen in the decentralized
energy sector, including the storage of customer data and the need to ensure data integrity,
fairness, and accountability in the transaction phase [3]. Many recent studies have investi-
gated how blockchain technology could be used in distributed administration, peer-to-peer
(P2P) sharing, electric vehicles (EVs), and green certificate trading [4–8]. New innovative
technology in the form of blockchain technology is mostly used in distributed management
to handle the collection of users’ files, as well as to enhance data access and privacy, but it
is often used to manage the grid’s decentralization. In P2P sharing, blockchain supports
price control and supply and demand, maintains accountability, and protects customer
privacy. With regard to EVs, blockchain is mostly used for charging collection and pricing.
The price is often determined through bidding and at other times through smart contracts
that automatically respond to market conditions. Blockchain technology is mostly used in
carbon emission and green certificate trading to provide traceability, privacy, and security
throughout the trading period [4,7]. Since it satisfies the criteria of distributed generation
systems that include certain features, blockchain has a broad range of applications in the
energy sector. These include the following features. Decentralization: one of the first
features of blockchain technologies that complies with the specifications of a distributed
generation infrastructure in terms of user decentralization control and the nature of the
data in the form of distributed storage, reducing management costs, and enhancing user
data protection. Anonymity: as users engage in distributed energy trading this function
will help preserve their privacy. Accuracy: The blockchain’s data are synchronized across
the network nodes, allowing every single node to retain all information associated with
any transaction occurring within the network, guaranteeing transaction transparency. The
use of this feature in the energy sector will in turn reduce collusion in distributed energy
markets and increase energy-trading accountability. Since blockchain uses a shared storage
structure, each node will have a full copy of the whole ledger; thus, a single point of failure
is unlikely. As a result, an intruder cannot take ownership of the network by targeting and
manipulating a single node. Consequently, the security of the network is improved. When
extended to decentralized energy networks, it also improves the protection of customer
data [2,9,10].
As many features of blockchain match the generation of distributed energy, its ap-
plications in the energy sector could be widespread, and relevant innovations could be
developed. However, there are several issues and challenges that we could address while
applying them to the energy sector. The problem is that in the field of innovative technology
of blockchain and its applications, with the energy sector is still in the developmental stages,
there is still a need for more research to understand the full capacity of the technology and
its applications. Hence, this work aims to review and survey the recent literature on the
use of blockchain technologies in the energy sector to obtain a clear understanding of the
current situation, identify research gaps, and suggest future directions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related
works, identifies the research gaps and presents the contribution of the study. Section 3
introduces the research methodology and highlights the research questions. Section 4
presents the results, whereas Section 5 discusses the findings. Finally, the conclusion and
future work recommendations are presented in Section 6.
2. Related Works and Contributions of Study
The topic of blockchain and its use in the energy sector is popular among scholars,
and because blockchain is still in the developmental phase and is still emerging, numerous
studies have reviewed it and its application in the energy sector. The work of the authors
of [2] investigated the classification of the blockchain applications in smart grids and
renewable energy resources, and discussed how the communication with blockchain was
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 3 of 20
established. This work also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
blockchain technology in power system applications and identified the most suitable
blockchain technology for each application. Other scholars, such as the authors of [1],
studied blockchain technology applications for power systems. Majeed et al. [3] conducted
a chronological review of blockchain genesis, initiation, and growth, which detailed an
overview of a wide number of blockchain applications in a smart city environment.
The multidisciplinary existence of blockchain research regarding consumer confidence
was elucidated by the authors of [11]. The traceability and privacy offered by blockchain
have been examined by scholars who have discussed blockchain transactions in the trans-
portation and energy sectors. Marketing science should be employed as part of an effort
to assess the impact of blockchain on consumer confidence. Additionally, Ahl et al. [10]
clarified that blockchain had significant potential for energy development by conducting
a comprehensive analysis of the multidimensional analytical structure of the factors of
P2P microgrids centered in the blockchain. In the work by the author of [12], 468 smart
contract-related studies were examined in a systematic summary of the research on smart
contracts. Six mainstreams of intelligent contractual research were analyzed, and more
research paths on smart contracts were established.
To identify the research gaps, a total of six review articles between 2018 and 2020
were carefully analyzed. Table 1 summarizes the survey works on energy-blockchain
technology applications through various key topics such as energy internet, smart city, P2P
energy-trading, electric vehicles (EVs), decentralized storage, blockchain with artificial
intelligence (AI) and blockchain privacy/security.

As shown in Table 1, the majority of the studies examined the application of blockchain
in P2P and EVs (e.g., [13,14,16–18]). Other fields such as energy internet and smart city were
also discussed by the authors of [13–15,18], while the area of decentralized storage was
only investigated by the authors of [17,18]. However, none of the reviewed articles fully
examined the artificial intelligence (AI), security, and privacy in blockchain. Filling this gap
facilitates a significant contribution due to the importance of AI and cybersecurity-related
topics which have attracted the attention of various scholars in recent years.
Therefore, the current study contributes to the body of knowledge regarding the
energy blockchain in many ways: First, we conducted a comprehensive review analyzing
57 articles between 2014 and 2021. Second, we followed a systematic method and strategy
to collect the articles and extracted the right information. Third, our work gives more
attention to the topics that have not been discussed in prior works (e.g., artificial intelligence,
security, and privacy), and topics that were less frequently examined (e.g., decentralized
storage), while providing an update on the most discussed areas (e.g., P2P and EVs) as
the majority of our included studies were published between 2020 and 2021. To our
knowledge, the current study is among one of the primary academic works to offer a
systematic and comprehensive review of energy-blockchain applications regarding AI,
security, and privacy.

3. Methodological Selection and Research Questions
To conduct a systematic analysis of the existing literature on the subject of the research,
a concrete strategy needed to be developed to ensure a comprehensive review of the
literature on the use of blockchain technology in the energy sector. These strategies
included defining problems, establishing the research aims and objectives, setting up the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, scanning the literature using databases, manual searching,
as well as selecting articles based on the eligibility criteria [19–23].
Google Scholar was used as the primary search database. It is superior to other search
engines as it allows the researcher to find papers in a wide range of scholarly publications
based on the keywords used. Other indexes, such as IEEE and ScienceDirect, were also
scanned and used to achieve a detailed literature quest.
Keyword terms such as “blockchain,” OR “blockchain technology,” OR “blockchain
application,” AND “energy,” OR “renewable energy” were used following certain criteria
and parameters. The online literature search was performed between December 2020 and
May 2021.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies written in English, (b) studies pub-
lished between 2014 and 2021, (c) studies from both peer-reviewed journals and conference
proceedings, and (d) studies directly discussing blockchain technologies and applications
in the energy sector. We excluded any study that was (a) not written in English, (b) focused
on different energy aspects and (c) published in the form of dissertations or editorials.
Studies were selected based on two screening phases, these included “title/abstract”
and “full text” screenings. Mendeley desktop was used to store and manage all recorded
studies and citations, as well as to remove duplicates. Figure 1 illustrates the screening and
selection process. The final number of studies included in the review was (n = 57).

blockchain technology in the energy sector?
4. Results
As blockchain technology is still in the phase of development and realization rather
than in the phase of actual application and implementation, many of the reviewed articles
were reviewing the current literature on the topic given. In [24], the study examined
the more recent literature on the use of blockchain in the energy sector, as well as the
shortcomings of the established research on the subject. Future problems in the implemen-
tation of blockchain in the electricity sector were identified in the report. It was indicated
in the work of the authors of [25] that the notion of the smart grid has been described
as a futuristic vision of the conventional power structure by establishing the successful
convergence of green infrastructure and renewable energy technologies. The IoT and
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been combined. However, due to the traditional
centralized grid layout, integrating and syncing a comparatively significant amount of
increasing interconnection can become a problem. Similarly, issues with security in the
use and trading of energy statistics can pose major obstacles to smart grid deployment.
The study provided a systematic analysis of blockchain-based smart grid applications;
examined several recent blockchain-centered research works available in various literature;
summarized recent related practical projects, experiments, and solutions; and examined a
number of recent blockchain-centered research works accessible in the literature dealing
with safety problems associated with smart grid ideas to be addressed by blockchain.
Few of the reviewed studies provided proof of work (PoW) and proof of concept (PoC).
As in the work of the authors of [26], the need for PoW to be maximized to enhance the
security of network resource and to allow users to defend themselves against cybercriminals
was emphasized. Blockchain is a P2P process that ensures that there are no intermediaries
involved in the exchange and that energy loss is minimized. One of the recent studies by
the authors of [27] designed a blockchain-based, P2P, quasi-real-time electricity market.
Energy Web Chain, for example, is a blockchain network based on Ethereum with a full
proof-of-concept installation, including the smart meter and loads. The reviewed articles
were examined based on the criteria mentioned in Section 3, and the result of the summaries
of the articles is presented in Table 2 which includes the objectives of the studies and the
field of use of blockchain technology in the energy sector, the methodology applied, and

4.1. The Use of Blockchain in Decentralized Storage
The review of the literature demonstrated that the energy market is gradually trans-
forming into a distributed market, as indicated by the growing coverage of the solar
photovoltaic industry. However, the emergence of many prosumers has become a problem
that needs to be dealt with. For example, it is difficult to store a massive amount of data of a
large number of participants. The storage of large amounts of data in a central management
organization causes several issues. As the number of participants increase, the data volume
and the corresponding storage costs also increase. In the current condition in which all
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 8 of 20
the data is stored by one organization, other participants are expected to face difficulty
in accessing the previous data and ensuring transparency. Furthermore, in the case of a
breach in this organization, all data are likely to be leaked or lost. In the decentralized
power grid, it is difficult for the traditional centralized management approach to tackle
these issues.
Based on the review of the included literature, blockchain is used within the decen-
tralized energy system to improve the management of large amounts of data through the
protection of such data and the ability to make better decisions using a smart contract.
Blockchain technology simplifies and fairly reduces the management of the decentralized
energy system as it promises better management of the data even with an increased number
of participating consumers in the network. However, some privacy-related issues have
arisen with the use of certain blockchain networks, such as Ethereum.
In the first example, the authors of [28] designed an Internet data storage system
based on a hybrid blockchain application, which was a combination of public and private
blockchains. By using this hybrid block chain application, the efficiency and security of
energy management using the Internet can be guaranteed. This satisfies the requirement of
safe and efficient data storage as well as data integrity and prevents the malicious handling
of data. The system was designed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and security
of the electricity data of consumers. The application of blockchain to collect consumer
data from the system ensures that such data are not manipulated without permission by
external attackers, hence improving security. Additionally, consumers are fully encouraged
to monitor their own data. Intelligent meters inform users in detail about the amount of
electricity they use and what equipment they use the most.
Energy systems are undergoing a transformation resulting from the development of
distributed energy resources (DERs) and information and communication technologies
(ICT). One of the most important challenges is the new decentralization of the energy
system, which requires that new paradigms and distributed technologies be taken into
account, explored, and adopted. Because of their nature, blockchains show promise in
controlling and managing complex energy and microgrid systems, which have become
increasingly decentralized [35,45,46]. Facilitating these automated trading platforms could
be an efficient way for consumer price signals and energy cost information to be deliv-
ered [46], which simultaneously provides consumers with demand response incentives
and smart energy consumption management. Blockchains are capable of supporting local
power generation and local consumption-oriented markets, or microgrids [47]. One of the
major advantages of this approach is its ability to reduce transmission losses and postpone
costly network improvements. However, energy still needs to be carefully controlled and
managed through the physical grid to fulfill actual technological constraints and power
system stability.
The maintenance of security of supply and proven network resilience is a key challenge
as volumes of RES continue to improve. Blockchains could improve network resilience
and the security of supply by facilitating and accelerating IoT applications and making
it possible for flexible markets to be more efficient [35]. The technical characteristics
of the blockchains for DER and an enhanced resilience (safety, scalability, and speed),
allows blockchain solutions to be utilized not only for smart charging and resource-sharing
arrangements, e.g., community rage or microgrids, but also for smart grid and cyber safety
storage applications [36,48]. Green certificate trading has been discussed by the authors
of [38].
Decentralized grid control is another feature of blockchain in decentralized manage-
ment. If the residential low-voltage grid exceeds the electricity limitation, it must upload
the excess electricity to the main grid. When improperly controlled, the voltage on the grid
will become unstable, causing, for example, a sharp rise in electrical voltage. This common
issue requires an efficient solution in the form of a proper output power control. In the
work by the authors of [24], a proportional and equitable blockchain and smart contract
control scheme was proposed. The scheme involves the installation and assignment of the
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 9 of 20
smart contracts to some voltage controllers. This process is different from the conventional
architectures that involve all participants controlling the voltage in comparison with these
control schemes; moreover, they always restrict their output power. Clearly, they are
neither fair nor effective. The implementation of blockchain technology with the increase
in the number of participants has led to a corresponding increase in complexity and cost.
The crypto trading project was proposed by Mannaro et al. [9]. The main objective of
this project was to build a smart grid using blockchain. The purpose of using the smart grid
in this project was to match the relationship between supply and demand, which would
help the distributed energy market. By using these applications, end users can monitor
and create their own supply of energy and sell surplus energy on the distributed energy
market. Blockchain has two key functions in this project: to be used in energy trading as a
distributed directory and to be used as a control system for driving smart meters.
Gao et al. [30] have developed a smart grid system based on the sovereign blockchain.
The main objective of the system was to protect consumer data and at the same time to
ensure transparency and to identify possible uncontrolled power utilization, which would
lead to the manipulation of electricity.
Liang et al. [49] proposed a distributed blockchain-based data protection framework.
The main feature of the system was its ability to improve security as it can resist potential
attacks on the networks. This ensures that the data is not being misused or manipulated
by unauthorized parties. The framework uses certain features of blockchain technology
by distributing safety measures that ensure the recording and storing of consumer data
with the distributed ledger in the smart meters as nodes; hence, ensuring the integrity
and consistency of the data. Smart contracts are also utilized to monitor user power
consumption. An imbalance between power and demand can threaten power supply
security and can result in the overloading of power supplies and eventually power failure
or service interruption.
Hahn et al [50] introduced the smart contract that incorporates a transactive electric-
ity auction that does not require the supervision of a trustworthy agency. They used a
72 kW Photovoltaic (PV) array to conduct an Ethereum-based transactive auction on the
WSU campus to prove the concept. However, the power flow model was ignored in the
optimization process. To accomplish P2P transfers in the power grids, Cheng et al. [51]
applied blockchain technology to the distributed energy industry using Nbitcoin currency.
They provided perspectives on the technological, economic, social, environmental, and
institutional dimensions: A critical identified issue was the matching of technological
advancements with regulatory change facilitated by multi-stakeholder engagement and
regulatory sandboxes.
Zhu et al. [52] examined how blockchain technologies can be used to overhaul China’s
electricity market. They looked at how blockchain technology is advancing in the energy
industry and looked at some of the more famous instances of energy blockchains around
the globe. This work suggested that China should ease its regulatory framework, reform
the applicable rules, and resolve the management–innovation dispute. On the other
hand, Ahl et al. [53] investigated the use of blockchain in the energy sector through
structured interviews with energy and blockchain experts. They provided perspectives on
the technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions.
4.2. The Use of Blockchain in P2P Energy-Trading Platforms
Due to the need for the decentralized systems to cope with the increasing demand
for power and electricity, the application of blockchain in P2P markets is necessary. Men-
gelkamp et al. [34] proposed a decentralized consumer and prosumer market platform
based on a private blockchain for local energy markets. No local energy transactions are
required for a centralized intermediary. This article focused on the local photovoltaic
energy generation transaction system and implemented an Ethereum proof-of-concept
model for 100 users. This system uses the supply-and-demand auction mechanism. Such
a mechanism is implemented using smart contracts in the blockchain on their proposed
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 10 of 20
market platform. The platform enables users to make payments within the blockchain.
The supply and demand for each consumer will be automatically measured and predicted
using smart meters and then transmitted to nodes. The platform enables this information
to be handled locally without being transmitted to the blockchain to ensure the privacy
of the users or consumers. The authors addressed the privacy concerns of participants
during the designing phase of this decentralized platform. It would measure and broadcast
only the demand and production capacity of the participants to other users. Although
the platform is based on Ethereum, these data can also lead to privacy disclosure. As an
example, unauthorized individuals may deduce electricity consumption habits based on
this information.
Hahn et al. [50] suggested a decentralized blockchain-based energy auction system.
Buyers and sellers are able to perform reliable, safe, and transparent power exchanges
based on this distributed auction system. In the system, both the buyers and sellers use
two types of technologies, namely, smart contracts and smart meters. In case the sellers
pose excess generated power for the solar cells and aim to sell such an excess, the process
is simplified by starting a new auction in which the excess electricity is advertised in the
blockchain where bidders can participate in the auction. Smart contracts automate both the
auction and payment processes. The smart meters used in the network detect and report
the transaction electricity, verifying the completion of the transaction. The blockchain
stores all the data mentioned, which are generated by the suppliers, bidders, and smart
meters. In this article, the privacy issues were not discussed. However, if the data stored
on the blockchain is not coded for auction, the data will likely be compromised due to the
involvement of different parties, namely, the bidders, sellers, and smart meters.
The work of the authors of [33] mainly addressed the problems in the security of
disbursed energy transactions using certain privacy technologies in the smart grid. This
work used a token-based private distributed energy-trading system as it attempted to
find a solution for the previous situation where the auction may compromise the privacy
of information. The article by the authors [33] used this feature rather than the auction
mechanism. The proposed system allows consumers to anonymously exchange the price
of electricity without disclosing any identity; hence, the information during the transaction
is secured. To protect consumer privacy, certain features of the blockchain technology are
implemented, including anonymous encrypted information flow and multiple signatures.
In this trading system, there is no trustworthy third party, so prices can be negotiated.
However, they are always anonymous, and data protection is encrypted. This article
examined the corresponding countermeasures for a number of privacy and security features
by proposing a system that can be used to design energy-trading based on blockchain.
Park et al. [54] developed a blockchain-based P2P energy-trading platform that effec-
tively trades energy between users. This article suggested that energy labels should be
stored and verified using blockchain. Energy labels identify the source and consumption
of energy. The following steps form part of the trade process. First, it is automatically
determined by IoT devices based on the consumer activity to buy or sell energy; then, the
network generates a label. Such a label is then sent to all trading platform participants.
In case any of the participants wish to deal with the buyer or seller who has issued the
label, the label will be confirmed. At the end of the process, a record of the transaction
between the two parties is obtained and added to a blockchain and then transmitted to
all participants. This protects the privacy of all the participants, which was previously
discussed in other studies.
Esmat et al. [55] developed a platform with blockchain technology integration and
used actual data to simulate the platform operations. The proposed platform achieved
the required objectives and offered several advantages over the CDA design, but no
“one-size-fits-all” structure is available for P2P markets, which promises high efficiencies
while meeting the requirements of all prosumers. However, since pool-based markets
require a community manager to coordinate trading and so are not entirely decentralized,
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 11 of 20
the proposed approaches cannot reach the privacy protection and scalability desired in
P2P marketplaces.
The work of the authors of [16] reviewed P2P energy trading applications related
to blockchain technology and proposed a multilayer energy model architecture using
blockchain technology. On the other hand, the authors of [56] reviewed the emergence
of blockchain technology in the energy industry considering the ongoing transformation
of the energy market. The findings emphasized the significance of distributed energy
transactions and stated that rigid regulatory frameworks pose the most difficult challenge.
In the short term, blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids, and over the long term,
it will impact electric vehicle integration as well.
The blockchain can encourage consumer participation in local energy markets [46].
Consequently, consumers will be exposed to the real energy cost, which may lead to
rational energy consumption or to adequate price signals to certain demands [57]. The
local energy markets can include consumer self-generating investments in photovoltaics
(PVs) and small-scale wind energy. However, consumers have not had actual access to
the energy market until now, which for institutionalized energy suppliers remains the
priority [58] due to the high cost of its assets. Furthermore, several renewable energy source
(RES) investment incentives to export charges are often adequate or eliminated for the
sale of energy surplus back to the grid [59]. Such surpluses are acquired at low prices by
utilities companies and returned to consumers at standard prices. If prosumers can directly
sell their excess electricity to the non-intermediary consumers, saving energy costs for all
stakeholders will be possible. Prosumers can benefit more from their investments since
both the profits and value remain in the microgrid and local communities. P2P trading
can act as socioeconomic incentives for locally re-generated energy markets and thus can
provide alternatives for prospective prosumers [46].
A demanding task is the integration in the energy market of small-scale renewables,
distributed production, flexibility services, and consumer participation. Some authors
such as the authors of [35] have argued that blockchain can provide innovative trade
platforms for prosumers and consumers, where their energy surplus P2P demand can
be interchangeably traded. The active participation of the consumer can be secured and
recorded in smart contracts, which are immutable, transparent, and manipulatable. The
trading platform can compare and adjust electricity prices according to the trading situation
on the current market. The algorithm will help consumers/prosumers determine which
energy is the most affordable and is of high quality, thus making it more efficient. The
authors’ ultimate objective was to propose a platform that enables high-quality, low-cost
energy trade at all times and wherever between consumers and prosumers [35].
A distributed trading platform was constructed, and distributed pricing was carried
out by the authors of [51] based on blockchain technology and P2P trading. The work
proposed a decentralized framework for blockchain-based power market trading, which
developed a mechanism to encourage a balance between supplementary supply and
demand between consumers. This work also compared conventional methods of power
trading with power trading methods based on blockchain. Security and transparency of
trading information are the significant advantages of blockchain-based power trading. All
transaction information is recorded and maintained by all the participating nodes in the
blockchain-based power trading method, and each node can see all transaction records,
making the transaction information transparent and traceable. This mechanism allows the
data to be saved in a blockchain where all participating nodes are synchronized. However,
once the central administration is maliciously attacked, consumers’ information can be
leaked and misused.
Cheng et al. [51] primarily emphasized the security of the transaction information.
Every node records all transaction details and can view them. This can ensure that the
transaction is traceable and can also prevent a single point of failure; the main drawback of
the system is that it may reveal consumers’ transaction information.
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 12 of 20
In the field of renewable energy, solar PV shows promise in reducing cost, especially
with the development of battery storage technology. Such an advancement increases the
willingness of the public to install solar PV and become prosumers. The advantages of solar
power in terms of environmental protection and costs have become increasingly popular
in recent years. The new challenges for the emerging energy-trading market are the rapid
growth of the distributed generations. Therefore, research on the appropriate management
systems and market mechanisms is needed, and new trading schemes have been proposed
for the distributed energy market, which are based on blockchain advantages. However,
one of the major concerns of the implementation of blockchain technology is the protection
of the participants’ privacy in the blockchain-based decentralized energy-trading systems,
as most studies have focused primarily on transaction transparency.
4.3. The Use of Blockchain in Electric Vehicles (EVs)
EVs, for example, direct battery exchanges with charging stations, can be refilled in a
variety of forms without having to stop for a long time to charge. However, this approach
may cause the transaction to be fair. The fairness of the transaction will be affected by
the different battery brands and wear levels. The data are stored on the central server
using a traditional centralized management system, making fair trading difficult to achieve.
Kim et al. [60] therefore suggested a decentralized blockchain system-based battery ex-
change method. In this mechanism, the battery information is stored in the blockchain, and
intelligent contracts automate the payment process, including the compensation for price
differences. This can solve the fairness issues in the transaction process.
An objective process based on a shared blockchain framework was suggested by
Hua et al. [6] to control battery switching and to address the confidence gap between
electric car owners and swapping stations. The proposed network with all the operational
data of the battery will solve problems that are not present and take account of battery
status, degradation of performance, and depreciation. In the work of the authors of [4],
an EV charging platform based on blockchain technology was proposed. This platform
is reliable, automated, and secured. EVs apply demand charges and then issue their
quotes for charging stations. EVs can select appropriate charging stations based on the
price and the location. The use of blockchain technology in this process can help improve
the transparency and reliability of the trading process. In the meantime, information on
the geographical location of EVs is not leaked; hence, it can be deduced that privacy is
protected. The transaction process consists of four phases: exploration, bidding, evaluation,
and charging. EVs can complete the selection and the charging process of the most suitable
recharging stations, and this will not leak any information for the following reasons: First,
no information is revealed since every user is anonymous in the blockchain. Second,
regional range is the geographical position of the user’s message on demand. This process
not only prevents the disclosure of data and location but also makes the arrival of electricity
supply to the destination areas easier. In addition, most transaction processes do not have
to be carried out in blockchain, and other users will not know which transaction was made
as well as the price.
4.4. The Integration of Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly evolving, and its powers in prediction, control,
and optimization have been demonstrated in various applications. There have been few
attempts to integrate the blockchain with AI in the energy domain. For example, in [61], an
artificial intelligence-enabled blockchain system was proposed for the electric vehicle to
predict EV charge. The authors approved the conventional training scenario. The proposed
solution exhibited a high predicted power consumption with an R2 score of 0.938. The
accuracy dropped by only 1.7 per cent when using a federated learning strategy.
Thus, the proposed system provides dependable and timely service to deliver extra
electricity from the vehicular network and lowers power fluctuation. Although the amount
of energy is predicted and charging and discharging EVs are separated, there is no method
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 13 of 20
for dynamic cost allocation for energy. Another use of federated learning was found
in [62]. The researchers analyzed the dynamics of vehicle machine learning to quantify
the end-to-end delay with blockchain-based federated learning. The channel dynamics
can be used to reduce the system delay. The proposed method for tweaking the block
arrival rate is demonstrable online and is capable of driving system dynamics to the desired
operating point.
The researchers in [63] used blockchain to reduce the risk when banks lend money to
power companies. The proposed model identifies the number and location of renewable
generation units, time-of-use energy pricing, and manufacturers. A type-2 fuzzy program-
ming solution method was proposed. The findings showed that uncertain demand and
default risk have a substantial effect on the solution, and that profitability was increased by
1.73% by using the proposed model.
In another study by the authors of [64], a sustainable network microgrid incorporated
economic, environmental, and social constraints to search for maximum customer demand
satisfaction. The fuzzy multi-objective programming models were proposed to handle the
variability in distributed generation capacity and demand load. The sustainable microgrid
P2P market paradigm boosts profitability while lowering CO2 emissions by 9.35 per cent
and 25.20 per cent, respectively.
4.5. Blockchain Privacy and Security Issues
Blockchain is a new technology. Its implementation in the smart power grid poses
a major challenge. This section discusses some major privacy and security issues that
were not discussed in the previous sections. In addition, the latest developments in the
blockchain technology are discussed here.
The capacity of the power distribution system is sufficient for consumers for a stable
period of time and requires minimal monitoring and control. However, the conventional
load and power flow patterns have significantly changed with the integration of distributed
microgrids into bidirectional power flow. To solve this issue, the power distribution system
is being redesigned to incorporate a large number of IoT-based devices to improve system
controllability and observability. The redesigned power distribution system is known
as the active cyber-physical distribution system (A-CPDS) [65]. Blockchain technology’s
enhanced security and efficiency features have made it a good candidate for improving
A-CPDS cybersecurity and efficiency [66]. In the setting of A-CPDS, smart homes outfitted
with a variety of IoT-based devices, such as smart meters, have created a high level of
interconnectivity between the consumers and the grid. Concerns regarding privacy leakage
and smart grid data integrity attacks induced from various data incursions from the
customer’s side have hindered the development of smart homes [67]. Blockchain has been
proposed as a technique for supporting the development of smart homes by ensuring
confidentiality and integrity as well as improving the authentication levels of customer’s
devices [68].
By integrating the smart meter into blockchain, the electricity bill will be auto-
generated and updated to the server in a tamper-proof manner. The customers can access
their bill information and make payments remotely using the accurate private key.
In the work of the authors of [69,70], the remote electricity bill payment feature was
implemented based on the blockchain and smart home technologies, with a high level
of protection against electricity theft. Blockchain technology can ensure that customers’
demand response power is provided through smart contracts that prevent fraudulent
activities. Additionally, by utilizing the smart contract and decentralized applications
for a smart meter, a distributed demand response can be implemented. Blockchain can
ensure the availability of critical data for distributed demand responses (such as ancillary
service signals, regional system states, and electricity pricing signals). Furthermore, the
blockchain’s auditability ensures that abnormal demand response actions can be regulated
or punished in a fair manner [33]. Blockchain with smart contract functionality can also
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 14 of 20
be used in an active cyber–physical distribution system for a secured and trusted demand
response of smart homes [66].
Conversely, the IoT and blockchain-enabled automated transactions can be applied
to the smart charging of EVs [71]. The blockchain-based billing system for EV charging
was evaluated in [72], in which the mode for the charging transaction was from grid to
vehicle (G2V). EV drivers will be able to know the charging amount in real time and
instantly pay using a blockchain-based billing system. Furthermore, the blockchain’s
mutual authentication for payment settlement can ensure that the payment is only cleared
when the user and charging station supplier agree on the actual charging amount [72].
An even greater number of blockchain-based processes were introduced in [73]. The
systems must be highly secure and only operated by a trusted system, which is the primary
advantage of blockchain. The same method for automatic maintenance can be employed
on the smart grid. Such smart grid additions will increase customer satisfaction as well
as security. Wang et al. [74] discussed anonymous power exchange between EVs, as
well as performance analysis and proof of blockchain feasibility for cybersecure V2G/V2V
applications. Siano et al. [75] introduced smart contract capability supported by the proof of
power method, which was used to reduce consensus delay. This technique performs better
in P2P power transactions and could be useful in G2V and V2G transactions. Moreover,
the proof of probability algorithm performs well and can be extended to the grid space to
reduce transaction latency. Table 3 introduces the recent developments in the blockchain
technology for the privacy and security challenges.

5. Discussions
The review of the literature that has examined the use of blockchain technology in
the energy sector reveals that the technology is new and is advancing at a fast pace in
various areas and fields of application including decentralized storage, P2P energy-trading
platforms, EVs, AI, security, and privacy.
However, certain concerns and issues have arisen with the experimental projects that
use blockchain technologies. These issues need to be clearly understood and addressed in
order to improve blockchain adoption and to enable it to reach its full potential. One of the
important issues that was raised in the literature is that blockchain technologies must be
able to provide the requisite scalability, pace, and protection for the proposed use cases.
Distributed consensus algorithms, which are critical to achieving these goals, are already
being investigated, but a solution that incorporates the desirable features without major
trade-offs is still in the early phases of development and requires more investigation.
Blockchain technologies should demonstrate the capability to be scaled to match
the requirement of both security and privacy with each application. However, there is
promising work in the direction of the distributed consensus algorithms, which are believed
to be essential for the implementation of blockchain technology.
Another issue that was raised by many researchers was the possibility of security
threats resulting from inadvertently poor device architecture. This feature needs to be
presented in the technology which will lead to more resilience against the security threats.
To demonstrate the concept of security, Bitcoin is considered to be the first cryptocurrency
implemented. It has shown to be highly resistant to cyberattacks.
Other networks, such as Ethereum, have previously been victims of significant attacks.
Importantly, cybersecurity flaws are often caused by peripheral implementations, such
as digital wallets or smart contracts. The ability to withstand such attacks is important,
particularly for applications in critical infrastructure, including energy systems. Due to
a lack of familiarity with large-scale implementations, blockchains pose potential threats
such as malfunctions in the early stages of its development. Blockchain applications and
platforms heavily depend on the coding of new algorithms, which can be a time-consuming
and error-prone process. Before the system matures, there is also a high risk of security
vulnerabilities, which may result in negative exposure and delay in market adoption.
Another significant problem is the high implementation costs associated with blockchain
networks [17–19]. To achieve data integrity and enhanced protection as well as to remove
the need for a trustworthy intermediary, new expensive hardware is needed, such as
custom information and communications technology equipment and applications. The
costs for this hardware must be outweighed by the advantages of data integrity, enhanced
security, and the absence of financial authority.
Smart meters are currently being used in the energy market without significant com-
puting capacities but combining existing smart metering and grid infrastructure with
distributed ledgers may be expensive. Both the administrative and legal realms pose
challenges to the acceptance and adoption of the technology. Public interest in energy
markets is encouraged by regulatory authorities [19,21,29,36]. Blockchain systems have
started to show promise in decentralized microgrids, but they face difficulties in aligning
with central commands and grid coordination. Energy trading must be incorporated with
grid operator experience. A continued decentralization may result in a more complicated
energy system management in general. To maintain consistency with the law and customer
rights, smart contracts must be built into legal code. It is not obvious who bears the legal
and technological liabilities for the unintended effects of the conduct of multiple parties in
a distributed framework architecture.
For instance, if a massive breach is effectively carried out as a result of a software
or hardware flaw in the scheme, there is no single body to whom customers can direct
their concerns, which is the case now. Instead of trusting a known authority, blockchain
schemes trust the technology itself. The lack of standardization and versatility is another
Sustainability 2021, 13, 9008 16 of 20
important aspect that may hinder blockchain applications. To enable interoperability across
technology solutions, standards for blockchain architectures must be established.
Regardless of the major concerns that have arisen as a result of the introduction of
blockchain systems, there are certain benefits that should not be ignored, such as real-time
updates dependent on blockchain technology. This mechanism allows for information
exchange between the two modes to be realized, reducing the waste of energy of the
supply device. There are several positions involved in the method of energy transport
infrastructures. Blockchain technology will help the various positions achieve confidence
and transaction integrity, encourage healthy competition, as well as increasing transporta-
tion quality.
Based on the review of the existing literature, it was noticed that when developing a
management or trading network based on blockchain, adequate attention should be paid
to the privacy and security question. Most networks utilize blockchain to store critical
data to maintain accountability and tamper-proofing; however, users’ privacy is often
overlooked. Users’ electricity usage data are stored on the blockchain in certain grid
management platforms, which may contribute to the occurrence of leakage of the everyday
electricity consumption habits. Users’ explicit demands and quotations are broadcast to the
network in the distributed point-to-point trading site, exposing their personal information.
The exact path and driving route of the EVs, as well as other classified materials, can
be used for harmful purposes in the EV charging management network. The designer’s
ignorance of the user’s critical data security triggers these issues. Any data security
technology in cryptography and other fields may be merged to address user privacy
protection issues while solving problems with blockchain. Furthermore, selecting and
improving the required consensus mechanisms is important to prevent incurring undue
costs in the implementation phase. Further consideration should be given to how suitable
smart contracts are that are developed for use in the trading process in order to enhance
the pricing mechanism of the distributed market, allowing them to perform the functions
of the conventional market.
6. Conclusions
In this work, we conducted a systematic and comprehensive survey of fifty-seven
energy-blockchain studies from 2014 to May 2021. We explored the blockchain applications
in various fields including P2P energy-trading, electric vehicles, decentralized storage,
artificial intelligence, security, and privacy. Our analysis revealed that blockchain provides
disintermediation, confidentiality, and tamper-proof transfers; it also provides innovative
ways for customers and small solar generators to participate more actively in the electricity
sector and to benefit from their properties. In the energy market, blockchains have allowed
sharing-economy applications such as SolarCoins, M-PAYG, and KWHCoin to be used [83].
In the electricity market, several academic and industrial entities are actively seeking
blockchain innovation. Since blockchain is a rapidly evolving field of research and growth,
a study of this emerging technology is necessary to increase the understanding of it, to
educate the body of expertise on it, and to allow its full potential to be realized. The
implications and potential uses of blockchain in the energy sector seem to be limitless, but
this field is still new and evolving.
Based on the survey of the current literature, in the energy sector, the majority of
countries are utilizing the centralized system, which is often governed by the country’s
policies and regulations. Hence, the potential application of blockchain in the energy sector
and the challenges that face its implementation should be viewed from a country or region
perspective in future research. Furthermore, blockchain should be examined within the
context of that country or region and its current challenges. This future approach will
enable researchers to direct their focus to the case studies approach, which will facilitate
and ease the application of blockchain technology.
