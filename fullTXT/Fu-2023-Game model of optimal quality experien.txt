Abstract—With the rapid development of the Internet of
Vehicles (IoV), vehicle networks will generate large amounts of
data. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) data sharing can improve driving
experience and quality of service, and Vehicle-to-Roadside unit
(V2R) communication can improve road transport efficiency. A
certain amount of bandwidth is consumed in the process of data
sharing between V2V and V2R, and when multiple vehicles re-
quest data from the RSU at the same time, there may be network
delay or congestion. Therefore, the vehicle obtains data faster by
requesting high bandwidth from the RSU. However, since the
bandwidth resources of RSUs are limited, optimal bandwidth
service strategies need to be investigated. In addition, in order
to ensure the safety, efficiency and traceability of data sharing
between V2V and V2R, a blockchain-supported IoV needs to be
established. Therefore, we design a blockchain-based framework
for V2V and V2R transaction framework that integrates DAG
blockchain and modern cryptography. The framework ensures
security and scalability during the execution of data exchange
and completion of bandwidth transactions, improves the service
quality of vehicles and realizes decentralized payment. In this
work, a two-stage Stackelberg game is established under two
pricing schemes of uniform pricing and discriminatory pricing
to jointly maximize the benefits of vehicles and RSUs. In
Stage I, the RSU sets the corresponding bandwidth service and
pricing strategy. In Stage II, the vehicle decides the service
demand according to the observed pricing strategy. The optimal
bandwidth allocation and pricing strategy between the RSU and
the vehicle is determined through the game of both parties, and
the existence and uniqueness of the two-stage subgame Nash
equilibrium is analyzed by applying backward induction. The
correctness of the model is verified by experiments, and the
comparative analysis shows that the proposed model has high
throughput.
Index Terms—Internet of Vehicles, DAG blockchain, band-
width allocation, game theory, Stackelberg equilibrium.

W ITH the rapid development of 5G network and vehicle
communication technology, low latency, high relia-
bility and efficient communication rates [1] provide possi-
bilities for advanced vehicle services and applications (e.g.,
autonomous driving and content delivery). They can im-
prove the safety and comfort ability of transportation by
providing ubiquitous access to information for drivers and
passengers(e.g., providing road traffic conditions, accident
prevention, payment services, safety applications, etc.) [2].
These offer unprecedented opportunities and capabilities for
vehicle applications. In this context, Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
serves as a complex system of dynamic mobile networks
that enable information sharing between vehicles, surrounding
sensors and the cloud. In the IoV scenario, data is ubiquitous
and its data sharing process mainly occurs in Vehicle-to-
Roadside unit (V2R) communication and Vehicle-to-Vehicle
(V2V) communication, which enables each vehicle to obtain
more comprehensive road traffic and other related information.
Nonetheless, there are still some issues waiting to be re-
solved in a large-scale IoV environment, namely the security
of data sharing between V2V and V2R. Common IoV systems
adopt a centralized architecture, but they are vulnerable to
single points of failure, denial of service, privacy leaks, and
malicious attacks [3]. Blockchain technology is considered
as a promising decentralized technology to solve security
problems with tamper-proof, traceability and decentralization
properties. The classic PoW consensus mechanism is used in
the blockchain, which has high computational cost and low
confirmation speed [4], [5], and the ledgers are frequently syn-
chronized, making it difficult be applied to large-scale vehicle
networks [6]. Additionally, it generates and validates blocks
in a sequential and synchronous manner, resulting in low
throughput. In order to solve the problems faced by PoW, some
alternative consistency algorithms have been proposed, such as
Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS),
among which PoS shortens the time for reaching consensus
to a certain extent and also increases the cost of node evil
through benefit bundling, but with low decentralization. DPoS
as a variant of PoS has improved efficiency due to fewer nodes
and decides who is out of the block based on voting and no
waste of resources. But similar to POS there is a tendency of
centralization and lack of incentive to improve the arithmetic
power [7].
DAG blockchain as a new technology with asynchronous
consistency mechanism and the ability to get rid of the
PoW that miners must complete to execute each transaction,

improves scalability and efficiency compared to traditional
blockchain [8], and almost no transaction fees. Meanwhile,
considering that V2V and V2R consume certain bandwidth
resources in the process of data request and exchange, when
multiple vehicles request data from RSU at the same time,
network congestion and delay may occur. Accordingly, for
faster data acquisition by each vehicle, the vehicles request
high bandwidth from the RSU to meet the vehicle time-varying
topology and strict latency requirements, but the bandwidth
resources of the RSU are limited. Based on this, there are
still some challenges to be solved for the bandwidth request
problem. On the one hand, it lacks an effective way to ensure
the security of the vehicle and RSU payment bandwidth trans-
actions. On the other hand, from the bandwidth requestor’s
point of view, vehicles want to get higher bandwidth at the
lowest price. From the bandwidth allocator’s point of view,
RSUs want to maximize their profits by providing bandwidth
services. Therefore, an optimal strategy for vehicles and RSUs
needs to be investigated, in which profit and cost should be
considered to determine an optimal bandwidth allocation as a
way to reach an equilibrium for each.
B. Solutions and Contributions
Based on the above problems, we have designed a V2V
and V2R transaction framework based on DAG blockchain
for data request transactions and bandwidth service transac-
tions. The framework combines DAG blockchain and digital
encryption technology to ensure transaction security while
also improving transaction efficiency. And the problem of
requesting bandwidth from a resource limited RSU is modeled
as a two-stage Stackelberg game based on bandwidth auction.
In Stage I, RSU sets the corresponding bandwidth service as
well as the pricing strategy. In Stage II, the vehicle decides the
service demand based on the observed pricing strategy. After
knowing the RSU policy and the bandwidth requirements of
all vehicles, the quality experience of vehicle is obtained by
calculating the bandwidth that the RSU may allocate to the
requesting vehicle and the actual bandwidth allocated. And
the equilibrium of each stage of the subgame under both
uniform and discriminatory pricing strategies is analyzed by
using the backward induction method. For uniform pricing
where the same price applies to all vehicles, the uniqueness
of the Stackelberg equilibrium is validated by identifying the
best response bandwidth strategies. For discriminatory pricing
where the different prices are applied, the uniqueness of the
Stackelberg equilibrium is proved by using the variational
inequality theory.
Specifically, in this paper, we propose a novel transaction
framework based on DAG blockchain, designed to support
secure and efficient data and bandwidth transactions between
V2V and V2R. We also design an auction-based two-stage
Stackelberg game that maps providers and consumers perform-
ing bandwidth services in a way that is optimal in terms of
profit and quality experience, and obtains the optimal service
by finding the stable point of the Nash equilibrium. The main
contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
(1) We design a scheduling framework that includes V2V
and V2R communication transactions and V2R bandwidth
transactions that integrates DAG blockchain and modern cryp-
tography to ensure security and efficiency of V2V to V2R
communication, as well as security and scalability during
execution of bandwidth scheduling services and completion
of transactions.
(2) We propose a two-stage Stackelberg game based on
bandwidth auctions. In Stage I, RSU sets the corresponding
bandwidth service as well as the pricing strategy. In Stage II,
the vehicle decides the service demand based on the observed
pricing strategy. Through backward induction, the optimal
pricing and bandwidth allocation strategy relationship between
V2R is analyzed, and negotiation between vehicles and RSUs
is carried out with the purpose of quality experience and profit
maximization.
(3) We analyze the optimal bandwidth allocation of vehicles
and the profit maximization problem of RSU in both uniform
and discriminatory pricing schemes, and verify the existence
and uniqueness of the Stackelberg game.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Related
work is presented in Section II. We build a DAG blockchain-
based vehicle network system model in Section III. In Section
IV analyzes of the vehicle and RSU quality experience and
profitability issues under the Stackelberg game model and its
performance evaluation in Section V. Finally, we conclude this
paper in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we will briefly discuss the related references
on blockchain-based and game theory-based data transactions
and bandwidth strategies (see Sections II-A and II-B).
A. Blockchain
There has been increasing interest in using blockchain
to ensure the security of transactions. Kumaran et al. [9]
proposed a blockchain innovation authorized IoV to ensure
the reliability, accuracy and security of communication in the
Internet of Vehicles. However, this study ignores the high
efficiency of data sharing. On the contrary, our proposed
DAG blockchain-based framework has fast transaction speed
and high throughput compared to traditional blockchains.
Yakubu et al. [10] integrate a given smart market scenario
with blockchain technology by using the Proof of Authority
(PoA) consensus mechanism. The simulation results show that
the model effectively solves the waste of excess bandwidth
in smart cities and provides a secure bandwidth transaction
scheme. Unlike this study, we design a scheme that maxi-
mizes the benefits of participants while keeping transactions
secure. Xiong et al. [11] presents a simple and self-adjusting
blockchain protocol called ORIC, which allows many more
blocks to be produced during the block-time so that the
bandwidth can be exploited to its maximum extent. However,
the purpose of the bandwidth strategy in this paper is to
obtain the required data as quickly as possible. Xu et al.
[12] propose an integrated blockchain and MEC framework
based on a space-structured ledger to meet the transaction
demands for IoT applications. And an alternate optimization
algorithm is also proposed to further improve the performance

of the scheme by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation and
computing resource allocation. Unlike this paper, a Stackelberg
game algorithm is designed to find the optimal bandwidth
allocation strategy that maximizes the profit of both sides of
the game. Hassija et al. [13] proposes a new framework of
Directed Acyclic IoV (DAGIoV), which solves the scalability
problem in traditional blockchains. And an auction-based non-
cooperative game algorithm is proposed, which considers the
cost and profit of the vehicle bandwidth request, so that the
price of the vehicle bandwidth is optimal. Different from [13],
the auction-based Stackelberg game algorithm proposed in this
paper maximizes the profit of the RSU under the condition of
satisfying the optimal vehicle quality experience through the
game between the vehicle and the RSU.
B. Game Theory
In recent years, a lot of research has been conducted
on the optimization of mutual benefit through game the-
ory. Wang et al. [14] designed a Stackelberg game-based
incentive mechanism for resource allocation to maximize
vehicle satisfaction and overall energy efficiency. However,
the security of resource allocation is not considered in the
designed scheme. Different from this work, the Stackelberg
game in this paper is constructed on the basis of blockchain,
which ensures the security of transactions. Kaur et al. [15]
proposed a game-theoretic Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation
(DBA) scheme, which achieved a fair way to allocate the
available bandwidth. However, the bandwidth allocation of
the Stackelberg game in this paper is auction-based, and the
allocated bandwidth is determined based on the requested
bandwidth and the requested price.
In order to maximize the benefits of both sides of the game,
many game algorithms are proposed. Ng et al. [16] proposed
a joint auction-alliance formation algorithm, aiming at max-
imizing the individual profits of UAVs, and the simulation
results show that it is not always stable for all UAVs to
join the alliance due to the profit maximization behavior of
UAVs. The Stackelberg game algorithm in this paper aims
at maximizing the overall interests of the vehicle and the
RSU, and finally achieves the Nash stability of the algorithm
by iterating the Stackelberg algorithm. Colonnese et al. [17]
implements willingness to pay (wtp)-based optimal bandwidth
allocation (WTP-GTOBA) through a greedy, application-layer
transparent algorithm, which distributes the remaining band-
width fairly after each user’s minimum bandwidth requirement
is met. For limited bandwidth resources, our paper proposes

an auction-based Stackelberg game algorithm, which allocates
bandwidth according to the bids of each vehicle. Within a
certain range, the requested price is high and the bandwidth
obtained is more. Zhou et al. [18] proposed a joint access
selection and bandwidth allocation algorithm for UAV-assisted
wireless communication networks, which models bandwidth
allocation among UAVs as a non-cooperative game. The
algorithm uses the Lagrangian method to solve the convex
optimization problem after the selection has stopped. Unlike
this work, our article uses the DAG blockchain technology
to develop a safe and efficient trading environment, and
proposes an auction-based Stackelberg game algorithm to
allocate bandwidth. For the optimal allocation of bandwidth,
the second-order derivation method is used to solve the convex
optimization problem. Zhang et al. [19] proposed a dynamic
many-to-many full matching algorithm based on three-layer
bidding to effectively solve the problem of many-to-many
bandwidth allocation between UAVs and users, which realizes
the optimization of global network bandwidth resources. In
this paper, we consider the many-to-one scenario through
a two-stage Stackelberg game, that is, the scenario where
multiple vehicles request bandwidth from one RSU, and
our proposed algorithm also achieves the optimal resource
utilization. A comparison of our work with other competing
approaches is given in Table I.

III. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we introduce the system model of the IoV
based on the DAG blockchain, which consists of the network
model, task model, blockchain model and Stackelberg game
model, respectively. A summary of notations used in the
remaining of this paper is also presented in Table II.
A. Network Model
This system mainly consists of vehicle, RSU, certificate
authority CA and blockchain, as shown in Fig. 1.
Vehicle: The set of vehicles in the network is defined as
N = {1, 2, ..., N}. The vehicle requests data from the RSU
and exchanges data with the vehicle for different purposes
to obtain information such as traffic and road conditions,
improve the driving quality and safety of the vehicle, and avoid
traffic jams and traffic accidents. Due to the consumption of
certain bandwidth resources in the process of V2V and V2R
communication, when multiple vehicles request data from the
RSU at the same time, they can request high bandwidth from
the RSU to improve the speed at which the vehicle obtains
data.
Roadside unit(RSU): Distributed on both sides of the road,
it provides corresponding data and corresponding bandwidth
for requesting vehicles, and its own bandwidth resources are
limited. RSU has great computing power.
Certificate Authority(CA): The CA can be regarded as the
trusted certificate authority center which means that it cannot
be compromised. Both vehicles and RSUs in the system need
to obtain their unique identity from the CA, and generate a
pair of keys to obtain certificates for data sharing in V2V and
V2R.
DAG blockchain: As a distributed ledger, it records data
transactions and bandwidth transactions between the vehicle
and RSU, and maintains the blockchain ledger through the
vehicle and RSU. To prevent bias in the data stored between
nodes, the DAG blockchain in the system uses the conflux
protocol. Specifically, the block size in Conflux is set to
300KB, and the block confirmation time is 0.5s [20]. In the
tree graph structure in Conflux, when a new block is generated,
after pointing to the parent block, find the leaf blocks (blocks
without child blocks and reference blocks) in the network,
and then establish reference edges with them. As shown in
Fig. 2, block C does not refer to block B, which means that
B is not before block C, while block F refers to block B,
which means that B is before F. So the block order is CBF.
Thus, a fully sequential block structure can be obtained, and
this fully sequential block structure can sort out the order
of transactions in the network. When there are duplicate or
conflicting transactions in the block, they can be excluded in
order.
Fig. 2. Conflux tree diagram structure.
B. Task Model
In the vehicle network, data is mainly transmitted through
V2V and V2R communication. The on-board units (OBUs)
of the vehicle and the RSU communicate through a wireless
channel, and the RSU communicates with the fixed safety

network to which it is connected. Through the communication
between V2V and V2R, the vehicles in the IoV can obtain
more data and information that are beneficial to the driving
experience, as shown Table III. But since malicious actors may
be present in V2V and V2R communications, i.e., malicious
vehicles obtain data from other vehicles or RSUs without any
cost and hindrance, dishonest vehicles provide false informa-
tion, and malicious vehicles try to generate fake ID for data
exchange, etc. In addition, the vehicle network has strict time-
varying topology and strict latency requirements. Therefore,
for data transactions between V2V and V2R in the IoV, it is
necessary to ensure both security and high efficiency.
When multiple vehicles send requests to the RSU at the
same time, problems such as network delays may occur. In
order to enable each vehicle to obtain the required data in time,
high bandwidth can be requested from the RSU to improve the
speed of obtaining data. However, the bandwidth resource of
RSU is limited, and each vehicle requesting bandwidth wants
to get the maximum bandwidth at the lowest price, while
RSU also wants to get the maximum profit. Therefore, for
bandwidth transactions between V2Rs, it is important to ensure
security and efficiency while satisfying maximum benefits.
C. DAG Blockchain Model
Initialization: In the vehicle network system, the blockchain
is initialized by the CA. Specifically, the CA generates the
system parameters and its keys (i.e., private key SKCA and
public key PKCA), keeps the private key SKCA secret, and
publishes the public key and other parameters to the system.
Registration: After the initialization, the vehicle and the
RSU then can register to the CA and obtain their public keys,
private keys, digital certificates (DCs), and wallet addresses
to become legitimate node in the blockchain. Meanwhile,
since RSU has strong computing power, RSU acts as a super
node, responsible for publishing and verifying transactions in a
timely manner, storing and maintaining the whole blockchain
to avoid the problem of uncontrollable transaction length in the
DAG blockchain; the vehicle acts as a light node to release
transactions.
First, describe the process of data transaction between V2V
and V2R, as shown in Fig. 3.
Transactions between V2V: Vehicle i sends a data request
transaction Tx to vehicle j, encrypts the transaction with vehi-
cle j public key PKj (Tx). This request transaction is denoted
by Tx = {PKj (Tx) , ceri, sT ime} where ceri represents
the legal status of the of vehicle i and sT ime represents
the timestamp for generating transaction Tx. At the same
time, the transaction Tx is recorded on the DAG blockchain.
Vehicle j gets the transaction related to itself by accessing
the blockchain ledger and decrypts it with its own private key,
while returning data transaction T ′x to vehicle i, encrypting the
transaction with vehicle i public key PKi (T ′x). This return
transaction is denoted by T ′x = {PKi (T ′x) , cerj , sT ime}

where cerj represents the legal status of the of vehicle j and
sT ime represents the timestamp for generating transaction T ′x.
At the same time, the transaction T ′x is recorded on the DAG
blockchain.
Transactions between V2R: Vehicle j sends data request
transaction Ty to RSU, encrypts the transaction with RSU
public key PKR (Ty). This request transaction is denoted
by Ty = {PKR (Ty) , cerj , sT ime} where cerj represents
the legal status of the vehicle j and sT ime represents the
timestamp for generating transaction Ty . At the same time, the
transaction Ty is recorded on the DAG blockchain. RSU gets
the transaction related to itself by accessing the blockchain
ledger and decrypts it with its own private key, while return-
ing data transaction T ′y to vehicle j, encrypting the return
transaction with vehicle j public key PKj
(
T ′y
)
. This return
transaction is denoted by T ′y =
{
PKj
(
T ′y
)
, cerR, sT ime
}
where cerR represents the legal status of the of RSU and
sT ime represents the timestamp for generating transaction T ′y .
At the same time, the transaction T ′y is recorded on the DAG
blockchain.
Second, for N vehicles in the system, i.e., N =
{1, 2, ..., N}, data are requested from the RSU simultaneously.
Each vehicle i ∈ N determines its bandwidth service require-
ments, defined as wi. Additionally, we Consider wi ∈ [w,w],
where w is the minimum bandwidth requirement and w is
the maximum bandwidth service requirement controlled by
the RSU. Then, let W ∆
= (w1, w2, ..., wN ) denote an overview
of bandwidth service requirements for all vehicles. W−i and∑
wj represent the bandwidth service demand of other vehi-
cles except vehicle i and the bandwidth request of all vehicles
including vehicle i, respectively.
Step 1, vehicles submit their bids, i.e., βi as Eqn. (1).
βi = (wi, ρi) (1)
Here, wi represents the requested bandwidth of the ith vehicle
and ρi represents the price offered by the vehicle when
requesting bandwidth from RSU. Note that, the bandwidth
requested by the vehicle from the RSU is smaller than the
total bandwidth of the RSU itself, i.e., (wi < B).
Step 2, after collecting the bids of N vehicles, the bandwidth
allocated by RSU to each vehicle is as shown in Eqn. (2).

Step 3, the sum of the requested prices offered by all
vehicles is as shown Eqn. (3).
Γ =

Third, the specific process of bandwidth transaction between
V2Rs is shown in Fig. 4.
Bandwidth transactions between V2R:
(1) Bid request: Multiple vehicles send requests to the RSU
simultaneously, where vehicle i sends its request information
βi = (wi, ρi), which includes the requested bandwidth and the
requested price. Vehicle i signs the request message sigi (βi),
and sends both the request message and the signature to
the RSU, denoted as ReqMsg = {sigi (βi) , βi}. RSU then
returns the distribution information wi′ = min(wi,
ρi
Γ β) to the
requesting vehicle, which includes the actual bandwidth dis-
tributed to the vehicle by RSU and the price information. RSU
signs the returned distribution information sigR (wi
′), sends
the signature and distribution information to the requesting
vehicle i, denoted as DisMsg = {sigR (wi
′) , wi
′}.
(2) Verification message: When vehicle i receives the mes-
sage from RSU, it will send a confirmation message Ei to
RSU, which means ”I have determined the requested band-
width”, denoted as ConMsg = {PKR(Ei), Ceri, sT ime},
where PKR(Ei) means the confirmation message Ei is en-
crypted with RSU public key, Ceri indicates the legal status
of Vehicle i and sT ime represents the timestamp to confirm
this message.
(3) Allocate bandwidth: Once the RSU receives a vehicle
confirmation message, it first checks whether vehicle i is
among the multiple requesting vehicles. If it is, RSU imme-
diately provides bandwidth service to the vehicle, otherwise,
it will refuse to provide service. After the allocation of
bandwidth ends, vehicle i generates a new transaction Tix,
and vehicle i sends the transaction signature sigi (Tix) to the
RSU.
(4) Transaction: When the RSU receives a new transaction
from a vehicle, it decrypts the transaction using the public key
of the corresponding vehicle to view the transaction and signs
it. Then, the RSU publishes a new transaction sigR (sigi (Tix))
on the DAG blockchain.
(5) Validation and payment: After the transaction Tix is
issued, it waits for the validation of the new added transaction

later. When the transaction is successfully validated, the sys-
tem transfers the cost of the bandwidth from Ni wallet to RSU
wallet. The coins of the vehicle Ni will be deducted from the
wallet Wi(k) and permanently transferred to the WR(k) wallet.
D. Stackelberg Game Model
The bandwidth request between the vehicle and the RSU is
modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game, as shown in Fig.
5. In Stage I, RSU as the leader, displays the bandwidth and
price it can provide. In Stage II, each vehicle acts as a follower
to determine its own requested bandwidth and price based on
the information provided by RSU. Vehicles are in competition
with each other and all want to maximize their own profit, i.e.,
to find the equilibrium point of optimal bandwidth allocation
so that the quality experience of each vehicle is maximum.
As long as they deviate from the equilibrium point, their
own quality experience will be reduced [21]. Meanwhile, RSU
maximizes its own profit by providing bandwidth services to
vehicles.
By recording the data transactions between V2V and
V2R and the bandwidth transactions of V2R on the DAG
blockchain, the security of the transactions is enhanced and
the efficiency of the transactions is improved. However, for
bandwidth transactions between V2R, we not only want to
ensure the security and efficiency of the transactions, but also
make the profits of both sides of the transactions optimal.
Therefore, a two-stage Stackelberg game based on bandwidth
auction is proposed, which satisfies to make the vehicle obtain
the maximum bandwidth at the lowest price while maximizing
the profit of RSU. The specific game is described in detail in
Section IV.
IV. EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF OPTIMAL BANDWIDTH
ALLOCATION
In order to satisfy the requirement that the vehicle can obtain
the maximum bandwidth from the RSU at the lowest price and
maximize the profit of the RSU, we propose an auction-based
two-stage Stackelberg game between the vehicle and the RSU.
A scenario of a bandwidth auction between the RSU and the
vehicle is shown in Fig. 6.
(1) The first box shows the vehicle submitting a bid to
the RSU, which includes the requested bandwidth and the
requested price. Among them, the bandwidth allocated to the
vehicle by the RSU depends not only on the requesting vehicle
but also on the bidding of other vehicles. Non-cooperative
relationship between V2V.
(2) The second box shows a scenario for estimating how
much bandwidth the RSU allocates to the vehicle. According
to the bandwidth requests of all requesting vehicles, it is
estimated that the RSU allocates the bandwidth according to
the ratio of the bandwidth requested by the vehicle to the total
bandwidth as αi′ = wiB∑
wj
, αi
′ > 0.
(3) The third box shows a scenario of how much bandwidth
the actual RSU allocates to the vehicle. According to the
bandwidth requests of all requesting vehicles, RSU actually
allocates the bandwidth according to the required bandwidth
of the vehicle and the offered price as wi
′
= min(wi,
ρi
Γ B) .
In the auction-based two-stage Stackelberg game, to better
analyze the strategy problem between vehicles and RSUs, we
use the backward induction method.
1) Stage II (Vehicle Request Bandwidth Policy): With known
RSU prices and other vehicle policies, vehicle i determines its
bandwidth requirements to maximize quality of experience as
follows:
Ei(ρi, ρ−i) = φi(αi
′(βi), ρi
∗)− Λi(wi
′(βi), ρi)
= ρi
∗αi
′ − ρiwi′
(4)
where αi
′ = wiB∑
wj
, wi′ = min(wi,
ρi
Γ B). φi(αi′(βi), ρi∗)
and Λi(wi
′(βi), ρi) represent the estimated cost price and the
actual cost price, respectively.
2) Stage I (RSU Pricing Strategy): The profit of RSU
is the fee obtained by providing bandwidth service to the
vehicle minus the service cost, where the RSU service cost
depends on the bandwidth demand wi of the vehicle. There-
fore, the price of the strategy space determined by RSU is{
P = [ρi]i∈N : 0 ≤ ρi ≤ ρ
}
, so that its profit maximization
is expressed as:∏
(P,W ) =

In Algorithm 1, first the bid price of all vehicles in the RSU

the optimal quality experience of the vehicle and the maximum
profit of the RSU. For this purpose, the actual bandwidth

actual cost Λ of all vehicles are calculated.
Conclusion 1. The proposed algorithm converges when∥∥ρ[n] − ρ[n−1]
∥∥ /∥∥ρ[n−1]
∥∥ < ε is satisfied.
Proof. Starting from the initial bidding of any vehicle, in order
to satisfy to make the best quality experience of the vehicle and
the maximum profit of RSU, RSU allocates the bandwidth as
in Eqn. (2) according to the bid of each vehicle as in Eqn.
(1), and if the vehicle is not satisfied with the bandwidth
allocated by RSU, the vehicle will adjust its bid and rebid
to continue the iteration. After RSU gets a new bid for the
vehicle, it will use the gradient-assisted search algorithm to
update the price, i.e., ρ (n+ 1) = ρ (n) + δ ∇Π (ρ (n)), until∥∥ρ[n] − ρ[n−1]
∥∥ /∥∥ρ[n−1]
∥∥ < ε is satisfied and the algorithm
converges, where ρ (n) is the bandwidth price at the nth step
of the vehicle iteration, ε is the iteration step size of the
bandwidth price, and ∇Π (ρ (n)) is the gradient. In this case,
the quality experience of the vehicle and the profit of the RSU
converge to the optimum.
Conclusion 2. The time complexity of the proposed al-
gorithm is o (1) for one iteration, o (n) for n iterations,
and o (log n) for in-between iterations. The communication
complexity of the algorithm is o (|xN |).
Proof. First, for the time complexity of the proposed algorithm,
the vehicle evaluates its quality experience according to Eqn.
(4) and the RSU evaluates its profit according to Eqn. (5)
to determine whether to continue with the iteration. If the
benefits of the vehicle and RSU are optimal in one bid, then the
complexity is o (1). The worst case is that it takes n iterations
to find the vehicle and RSU Nash stable points with com-
plexity o (n), and in between these two cases, the complexity
is o (log n). Second, for the communication complexity of the
proposed algorithm, we denote the size of each bidding content
as x, and there are N vehicles in total, then the communication
complexity of these N vehicle is o (|xN |).
Next, the bandwidth allocation problem of RSUs under both
uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes is considered, and
the Nash stability of the Stackelberg game is analyzed.
A. Uniform Price Scheme
We first consider a uniform pricing scheme, where RSU
charges the same unit price for all vehicles, i.e., ρi = ρ, ∀i.
And apply backward induction to analyze the two-stage Stack-
elberg game.
1) Stage II (Demand game for vehicles): Given a price
ρ for RSUs, vehicles compete with each other by choosing
their own bandwidth requirements to maximize their quality
experience, forming a non-cooperative demand game (NDG)
Gu =
{
N , {wi}i∈N , {Ei}i∈N
}
, where N is the set of
vehicles, {wi}i∈N is the set of bandwidth policies, and Ei
is the quality of experience function for the vehicle to obtain
the optimal bandwidth service.
Theorem 1. There exists a Nash equilibrium in (NDG)
Gu =
{
N , {wi}i∈N , {Ei}i∈N
}
.
Proof. First, the policy space [w,w] of each vehicle is a non-
empty convex compact subset of the Euclidean space. Further,
we know Ei is apparently continuous in [w,w]. Then we
derive the first order and second order derivatives of (4) with
respect to wi, which can be written as follows:
∂Ei
∂wi
= ρi
∗ ∂αi
∂wi
− ρi (6)
∂2Ei
∂wi2
= ρi

∂2αi

∑
i6=j wj∑

(8)
Therefore, we show that Ei is second-order derivable with
respect to wi, so the non-cooperative demand game NDG
exists [22]. Meanwhile, according to the condition of the first
order derivative in (6), the best response function of the vehicle
is obtained, as shown in Eqn. (9).
Theorem 2. Under the following conditions, the uniqueness
of the NDG Nash equilibrium of non-cooperative games is
guaranteed.

Proof. Refer to the appendix section for details.
In summary, we use the best response of the vehicles to
obtain the Nash equilibrium of the non-cooperative game
of vehicles in stage II [22]. Next, we analyze the profit
maximization problem of RSU under uniform pricing in stage
I.
2) Stage I (RSU profit maximization): Based on the Nash
equilibrium of the NDG in stage II, the RSU pricing strat-
egy can be optimized in stage I to maximize the profit in
Eqn. (5). Therefore, optimal pricing can be formulated as
an optimization problem. Substituting (11) into (5), the profit
maximization of RSU is expressed as Eqn. (12). max imize

i∈N

Theorem 4. Under uniform pricing ρi = ρ ∀i, RSU achieves
profit maximization under unified optimal price.
Proof. From (12), we have
∏
(P ) =
(ρ− c)

(15)
Due to the negativity of (15), the strict concavity of the
objective function is guaranteed. Therefore, RSU can get the
maximum profit under the unified pricing.
Under uniform pricing conditions, we show that the Nash
equilibrium in stage II is unique, and the maximum profit is
also unique in stage I. Therefore, we can conclude that Stack-
elberg equilibrium is unique and the best response algorithm
can achieve this unique Stackelberg equilibrium [22].
B. Discriminatory Pricing Schemes
In discriminatory pricing, RSU sets different unit prices for
different vehicle needs. And backward induction is used to
analyze the optimal bandwidth requirement of the vehicle and
the profit maximization of the RSU.
1) Stage II (Demand game for vehicles): under the dis-
criminatory pricing mechanism, the strategic space of RSU
is
{
P = [ρi]i∈N : 0 ≤ ρi ≤ ρ
}
. We prove the existence and
uniqueness of NDG under unified pricing. Under discrimina-
tory pricing, the existence and uniqueness of NDG can still
be guaranteed. A slight variation on Theorem 3 leads to the
following theorem.
Theorem 5. Under discriminatory pricing, the unique Nash
equilibrium of vehicle i can be obtained as follows:
wi
∗ =
(N − 1)∑
j∈N

ρj∗B

(
(N − 1)∑

provided that the following condition
2 (N − 1) ρi

<
∑
j∈N
ρj
ρj∗B
(17)
holds.
Proof. The steps of proof are similar to those in the case of
uniform pricing as shown in Section IV-A, and thus we omit
them for brevity.
2) Stage I (RSU profit maximization ): We use the analytical
result of Theorem 5, i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the service
demand in stage II, to analyze the profit maximization. Sub-
stituting (16) into (5), we have the following optimization max imize

every ρi on h(ρ) is concave.
Furthermore, we show that

creasing function of ρi for ςij > 0. As shown in Eqn. (28),
where ρmin = min {ρ1, ρ2, · · · , ρN}. In fact, ρmin > c.
Thus, after a series of proofs, we can obtain when ςij > 0,

Theorem 7. Under discriminatory pricing, RSU maximizes
profits by finding a unique optimal pricing vector.
Proof. From Theorem 6, we know that every ρi on
∏
(p) is
concave when ςij ≤ 0 and every ρi decreases when ςij > 0.
In other words, when ρi is concave on
∏
(ρ), ρi needs to
be less than a certain threshold, and when ρi is greater than
a certain threshold, ρi on
∏
(ρ) is decreasing. If the price
is above the threshold, the vehicle is reluctant to purchase
bandwidth services from the RSU. We know that when
ςij ≤ 0, the optimal profit value of RSU, i.e.,
∏ ∗ (ρ) is
realized at the concave part, so ρ∗ exists. Then, we use the
variational inequality method to prove the existence of at
most one optimal solution [22], and obtain the uniqueness of
the optimal solution, i.e., the Stackelberg equilibrium. Let S ={

Let F (ρ) = ∇ (−
∏
(ρ)) = − [∇piΠ]i∈N , where the
optimization problem in (30) is equivalent to finding a point
set ρ∗ ∈ S, i.e., (ρ− ρ∗)F (ρ∗) ≥ 0,∀ρ ∈ S. It is the
variational inequality VI (S, F ). Therefore, we can conclude
that VI (S, F ) has at most one solution by showing that F
is strictly monotone and continuous on S [23]. The optimal
unique solution of the equivalence problem, i.e., the Stackel-
berg equilibrium, is found.
Definition 1. If F is strictly monotonic over S, VI (S, F )
has at most one solution, where S ∈ RN is a concave closed
set and the map F : S 7→ RN is continuous [23].
Proof. Let λ ∈ (0, 1), ρ1, ρ2 ∈ S, can get λρ1+(1− λ) ρ2 ∈
S. It can be known from (31) that S is a concave closed set.
To prove that the map F : S 7→ RN is strictly monotonic over
S, we consider the positivity (ρ1 − ρ2) (F (ρ1)− F (ρ2)) ≥
0,∀ρ1, ρ2 ∈ S and ρ1 6= ρ2. Also from the definition of the
variational inequality it follows that
(ρ1 − ρ2) (F (ρ1)− F (ρ2)) =∑
i∈N
(
(ρ1 − ρ2)
(
−∇piΠ|ρi=ρ1i + ∇piΠ|ρi=ρ2i
))
From Theorem 6 we have ∂2∏ (ρ)
∂ρ2i
= ∂2(f(ρ)+h(ρ))
∂ρ2i
< 0.
Therefore, ∇piΠ is decreasing on each ρi and −∇piΠ is
increasing on each ρi, which yields
−∇piΠ|ρi=ρ1i + ∇piΠ|ρi=ρ2i =
{ ≥ 0, ρ1i ≥ ρ2i
< 0, ρ1i < ρ2i
(32)
Based on the above analysis we have:
(
(ρ1 − ρ2)
(
−∇piΠ|ρi=ρ1i + ∇piΠ|ρi=ρ2i
))
≥ 0, ∀i ∈ N (33)
We know that ρ1 6= ρ2, and that there exists at least one j
satisfying the restriction (33). Therefore, we prove that F is
strictly monotone and continuous on S. So far, we have proved
that VI (S, F ) has at most one solution according to Definition
1 in [23]. Thus, the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved.
V. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
A. Simulation Settings
Consider a distributed network of V2V and V2R. For the
evaluation of V2R model, we first consider four vehicles in
the RSU network, and assume that the bandwidth requested
by the four vehicles is wi = {6, 12, 18, 24} MHz, and the
corresponding request price offered by each vehicle is ρi =
{35, 58, 71, 84} per cent. For each iteration, by increasing
the number of requested vehicles, the situation of bandwidth
allocation and quality experience of these four vehicles are
considered to make the vehicle quality experience optimal.
In addition, we increase the number of requested vehicles by
analyzing the impact of uniform and discriminatory pricing
schemes on RSU profits, which makes the RSU the most
profitable. Major parameters used in the simulation are given
in Table IV, most of which are adopted from [24], [25].

B. Performance of the Proposed Game Model
Fig. 7 shows that as the number of requested vehicles in
the network increases, the bandwidth allocation of the RSU to
the vehicles decreases. This is because the bandwidth of the
RSU is fixed and is divided among the vehicles that are in the
network of RSU.
Fig. 7. Variation in allocated bandwidth based on the number of requested
vehicles.
Fig. 8 shows that as the number of requested vehicles
changes the impact on bandwidth allocation and bid prices.
As bid prices increase, the quality of the vehicle experience
decreases as bids for other vehicles increase. This is because
the quality experience of a vehicle depends on the decisions
of all vehicles in the network. And in a certain situation, the
vehicle will get the maximum quality experience based on
the required bandwidth and bid price. After that, the quality
experience of the vehicle will not increase as the bid price of
the vehicle increases.
Fig. 9 shows that as the number of requested vehicles
increases, the profit of RSU tends to increase. This is because
Fig. 8. Variation in Quality experience of vehicle with increase in bid price

the more vehicles are requested in the network and the
more competition among the vehicles, the more profit the
RSU can make. Further, we find that RSU is slightly more
profitable under discriminatory pricing than under uniform
pricing. This is because discriminatory pricing can set different
service demand unit prices for vehicles. In this case, RSU can
significantly encourage vehicles to obtain higher total service
demand under discriminatory pricing and gain greater profit
gains.
C. Performance Analysis and Comparison of the Proposed
DAG blockchain
The traditional blockchains such as Bitcoin [26], Ethereum
[27] and DAG blockchains such as IOTA [28], Byteball [29],
NANO [30], Conflux [31], Hashgraph [32], SPECTRE [33]
and PHANTOM [34] are compared in terms of throughput,

PHANTOM Block+DAG 1500 × X X X
Bitcoin Pow 7 X X X ×
Ethereum Pow 15 X X X X
etc. The results are shown in Table V. It is observed that DAG
blockchain has a significant advantage in throughput, which is
tens of times higher than the traditional blockchain.
Specifically, no mining and no transaction fees are required
in IOTA [28], and the throughput of the entire network is
high. It does not support smart contracts itself. Byteball [29]
introduces the master chain and witness to avoid the double
spend problem. Smart contracts are supported. However, the
time of transaction confirmation is uncertain, which limits its
scalability and speed to some extent. NANO [30] guarantees
a reasonably low power consumption operation of the block
through the DPOS mechanism. However, NANO is not fully
tested, the consensus algorithm may be at risk of serious
flaws, and does not support smart contracts. Conflux [31] uses
the GHAST consensus protocol to make full use of network
bandwidth for higher throughput, and dynamically determines
the weight of each block based on the tree graph structure to
ensure the confirmation speed and activity of the consensus
system. Hashgraph [32] introduces the Gossip protocol to
avoid causing massive messaging storms at consensus and
supports smart contracts. However, it has not yet been operated
in large-scale public chain environments. SPECTRE [33] can
be mined in parallel to obtain greater throughput and faster
transaction confirmation. However, it cannot integrate smart
contracts because it can only do the relative ordering of
conflicting transactions and cannot do an absolute ordering.
Finally, PHANTOM [34] uses a greedy algorithm to imple-
ment a full sequence of settings verified by honest nodes. It
enhances the computational power of PHANTOM and also
makes smart contracts compatible with it. However, it has not
been specifically applied due to technical difficulties.
Based on the above analysis, Conflux its achieved decen-
tralization while ensuring TPS and supporting smart contracts.
Therefore, the DAG chain in our scheme is chosen to be the
conflux protocol, which has a throughput of 6400 TPS per
second, much higher than the 7 TPS per second of Bitcoin and
15 TPS per second of Ethereum, and can meet the demand
of transactions in the Internet of Vehicles. Meanwhile, the
average of 4 blocks generated per second, each block size
is about 300KB, the amount of data transferred per second is
1.2MB, which is about 4GB per hour, then the new transaction
history data can be up to 30TB per year, and storing 30TB
of data in industrial grade applications is not a particularly
difficult task [31]. Also, since a DAG is used in conflux, the
computational overhead is negligible compared to POW.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a DAG blockchain-based game
model of optimal bandwidth allocation strategy for IoV. The
model combines the communication between V2V and V2R to
improve the diversity of data flow in the vehicle network. By
recording the communication and bandwidth transactions be-
tween them in the DAG blockchain, the security and efficiency
of the communication between V2V and V2R in the network
is guaranteed. Further, the bandwidth service between V2Rs
is modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game model, and the
RSU profit maximization and vehicle quality experience max-
imization problems are studied by backward induction. Mean-
while, the bandwidth pricing schemes of RSUs are analyzed,
including the uniform pricing scheme and the discriminatory
pricing scheme. For uniform pricing applicable to all vehicles,
the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is verified by
determining the optimal request bandwidth of the vehicles.
For vehicles that apply to different prices, the uniqueness of
Stackelberg equilibrium is proved using variational inequality
theory. The correctness of the model is verified by simulated
experimental data, and the comparative analysis shows that the
model has a high throughput.
APPENDIX
Proof of Theorem 2.
Proof. Based on the first-order derivative condition in (6),
the optimal response function of vehicle with respect to the
bandwidth is obtained as shown in (9). The uniqueness of the
Nash equilibrium is proved and the optimal response function
is given [22], i.e., as shown in (9).
First, for the positivity of the response function, under the
conditions of (10), we have (given by Lemma 1 in [21])∑

∑
i 6=j wj > 0. Positivity is proven.
Second, we prove continuity with respect to (9). Let w′ >
w, we can further prove that Fi(w′) > Fi(w), as shown in
(35).
Specifically, we know that

means that the best response function (9) for vehicle i is
always positive.
Finally, we need to prove λFi(w) > Fi(λw), for λ > 1
scalability in Eqn. (36).
So far, we have shown that the best response function
in (9) satisfies the three properties of the standard function
described in [21]. Thus, the Nash equilibrium of NDG Gu ={

is unique.
