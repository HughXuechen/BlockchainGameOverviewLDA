Abstract. If blockchain technologies are emerging as important game changers
in the supply chain, this is largely attributed to their high operational and
strategic business value. While this high potential is acknowledged by the
practitioner’s literature, very few empirical studies have been conducted on the
factors explaining the adoption, use and continuance of blockchain-enabled
supply chain applications. To fill this knowledge gap, this study extended the
expectation-confirmation model (ECM) by integrating the supply chain stake-
holders trust to analyze to the continuance intention in blockchain-enabled
supply chain applications. The proposed model was tested and supported by the
data collected among 344 supply chain professionals in India. The paper ends up
with the formulation of important implications for practice and research.

1 Introduction
Blockchain technologies are emerging as important game changer in the supply chain,
especially because of their high potential benefits and capabilities. These technologies
could transform almost all supply chain-related processes, including by reducing
supply chain errors and by enabling supply chain automation [1] and end-to-end supply
chain security.
While the benefits related to blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain appli-
cations have been discussed by media, very few empirical studies have conducted to
assess their real business value. For example, a systematic review conducted by [2] on
bitcoin, blockchain and FinTech in the supply chain found that the survey method
approach was used for only 8% of the recorded cases. Consequently, this study aims to
bridge the knowledge gap identified in the literature by developing an extended version
of the ECM that integrates the supply chain stakeholders trust to analyze the contin-
uance intention in blockchain-enabled supply chain applications.
We draw on the literature on blockchain, studies using the ECM as well as studies
on supply chain stakeholders risk to address our research objective. After the

introduction, the firsts section of this study describes the theoretical development. The
next sections deal with our research methodology and the discussion of the results.
The paper ends with a conclusion, research implications, and the limitations and
future research perspectives of the study.
2 Theoretical Development
The model developed in this study (Fig. 1) is an extension of the expectation-
confirmation model [3, 4] with supply chain stakeholders trust. The expectation-
confirmation model (ECM) was proposed by [3] to assess cognitive beliefs that influ-
ence the user’s intention to continue using information systems (p. 351). The author
argued that “users’ continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use
and perceived usefulness of continued IS use. User satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by
their confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness” (p. 351).
The ECM has been used by various scholars in different settings. For example, [5]
extended the ECMby incorporating the theory of planned behavior to examine themobile
data service continuance. [6] used an extended version of the ECM to investigate the
continuance use of mobile instant messaging in South Korea. [7] developed and tested
several adoption and continuance models. [8] incorporated the perceived risk into the
ECM to assess the continuance intentions of physicians using electronic medical records.
Drawing on this stream of research, we propose the subsequent hypotheses in the
context of blockchain-enabled supply chain applications:
H1: Perceived usefulness has a significant positive effect on satisfaction.
H2: Confirmation has a significant positive effect on satisfaction.
H3: Confirmation has a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness.
H4: Satisfaction has a significant positive effect on the user’s intention to keep
using blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain applications.
Moreover, we argued that in the context of supply chain, trust among supply chain
stakeholders will play an important role in the adoption, use and continued use of
blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain applications. Indeed, prior studies found
that trust plays an important role during the IS adoption and use process [9, 10].
[11] argued that inter-organization trust is an important decision factor during the
adoption process of electronic procurement. We draw on these prior studies and pro-
pose that in the context of blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain applications,
trust among all supply chain stakeholders will play a critical role not only during the
adoption, use and continuance process, but also for satisfaction. Therefore, we propose
the following hypotheses:
H5: Supply chain stakeholders trust has a significant positive effect on the user’s
intention to continue to use blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain
applications.
H6: Supply chain stakeholders trust will moderate the relationship between satis-
faction and the user’s intention to continue to use blockchain technologies-enabled
supply chain applications.

3 Methodology
The study uses a web-based survey to collect data from 344 (70.1% males and 29.9%
females) supply chain professionals who have at least three years of experience with
blockchain in India. The data collection process was handled by a market research firm
called ResearchNow (https://www.researchnow.com/?lang=gb). Our items were
adapted from prior studies [3, 12]. They were all measured using a seven (7)-point
Likert scale. The data analysis was realized using SmartPLS, version 3.0 [13], which
is a partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) tool. It is a relevant

tool to evaluate the SEM measurement and structural model. In addition, it has various
useful data analysis approaches embedded into the tool, including the two-stage
approach proposed by [14] to assess the moderating effect.
4 Results and Discussion
Table 1 displays all information related to the reliability and validity of our constructs.
We can see that all the values of the loadings, CR and AVE are respectively higher than
0.7, 0.7 and 0.5, all of which are the acceptable threshold values suggested in the
literature [15, 16]. Therefore, we can include all constructs in the proposed research
model.
The discriminant validity was tested by comparing the correlation matrix values
with the square root of the AVEs in the diagonals. As we can see in Table 2, all the
values of the square root of the AVEs in the diagonals are higher than the inter-
correlation with other constructs, thus confirming the discriminant validity [17–19].
Table 3 describes the results of the structural model, including the moderation
effect analysis. It clearly indicates that all the standardized path coefficients of all our
proposed hypotheses are significant at the levels of 0.001 (for CONF ! PU, CONF !
SAT, SAT ! CONT and SCTRU ! CONT) and 0.05 (for PU ! SAT and the
moderating relationship). Consequently, all our proposed hypotheses (H1–H6) are
supported (Table 4).

5 Conclusion and Future Research Directions
The main objective of this work was to apply an extended version of the ECM [3] that
integrates the supply chain stakeholders trust to assess the continuance intention to use
blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain applications. Data were collected from
supply chain professionals in India and were analyzed using version 3.0 of SmartPLS
in order to test the proposed research model. The study’s results provided a strong
empirical validation of all our proposed hypotheses when using the ECM in the context
of blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain applications.
The study also highlighted the importance of trust among supply chain stakeholders
in supporting a continued use of blockchain technologies-enabled supply chain
applications. However, further research may be needed to solve further issues related to
the use of survey; longitudinal case studies could well be used in this regard. In
addition, it would be interesting to study unobserved heterogeneity in the use of SEM
to study blockchain-enabled applications [20].
