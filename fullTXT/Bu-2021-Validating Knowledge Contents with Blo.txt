This paper presents the use of gami¯ed crowdsourcing for knowledge content validation.
Constructing a high-quality knowledge base is crucial for building an intelligent system. We
develop a re¯nement process for the knowledge base of our word retrieval assistant system,
where each piece of knowledge is represented as a triple. To validate triples acquired from
various sources, we introduce yes/no quizzes and present them to many casual users for their
inputs. Only the triples voted \yes" by a su±cient number of users are incorporated into the
main knowledge base. Users are incentivized by rewards based on their contribution to the
validation process. To ensure transparency of the reward-giving process, blockchain is utilized
to store logs of the users' inputs from which the rewards are calculated. Di®erent strategies are
also proposed for selecting the next quiz. The simulation results indicate that the proposed
approach has the potential to validate knowledge contents. This paper is a revised version of our
conference paper presented at the 12th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and
Database Systems (ACIIDS 2020).

Constructing a high-quality knowledge base is important for developing an
intelligent system, and knowledge re¯nement is necessary to increase the value of the
knowledge base. Several approaches to re¯ning knowledge represented as knowledge
graphs have been reported.1 One promising approach is to harness the power of many
users, for example, through crowdsourcing.2 However, the inherent problem in
crowdsourcing is maintaining a high-quality output. It is important to motivate
users (or workers) to produce robust results.
Gami¯cation is one way to keep users motivated in crowdsourcing.3 Gami¯cation
is the process of introducing game-like elements to a non-gaming context. Games
with a purpose (GWAP) is an example of gami¯cation, where intended tasks are
executed as by-products of playing games.4 GWAP is also applied to re¯ne knowl-
edge graphs.5 In the ESP game, which is a notable example of GWAP, two users who
do not communicate with each other are asked to label an image. Points are given to
a user who puts the same label as their paired user.6 By devising proper game rules,
an incentive can be given to users to input correct answers.
Point systems are expected to motivate users to earn more points and complete
more tasks with correct results. In such situations, it is important to correctly cal-
culate points. If points cannot be calculated at the time users are playing the game or
completing the task, the points will be calculated later according to the user's past
contribution; thus, it is necessary to ensure that the users' records or input logs that
are used for the points calculation are not altered in any way. The point calculation
process must be transparent so that any user can examine the basis for the point
calculation. If we assume that the game is operated by a single trusted entity, as long
as the operator is trusted, point calculations can also be trusted. In that case, a
distributed database is an e®ective way to store data in a distributed way, while data
integrity is maintained. However, if we assume a trust-less environment where no
single trusted entity exists, we need a mechanism to keep the transparency and
tamper-resistance nature of the data. To tackle this problem, we utilize blockchain,
which is a distributed ledger technology that has been proposed as the basis of
cryptocurrency.7 Blockchain allows the data to be stored and shared over the net-
work, and it is guaranteed to be free from tampering.
In this paper, we focus on the example of the knowledge base used in our word
retrieval assistant system,8 which is intended to support people with word-¯nding
di±culties. Through a series of questions and answers, the system attempts to guess
what the person wants to express but cannot ¯nd a name for. The knowledge base is
needed to formulate questions to ask. For this system, we accumulate knowledge
contents from various sources such as scraping websites or obtaining inputs from
human users. Because of the nature of this system, its knowledge contents should
cover topics that often appear in everyday conversation, such as things related to
daily life and not in some specialized domains. Thus, the participation of many casual
users to construct the knowledge base would be e®ective.
However, when many casual users contribute to knowledge contents, the quality
of the knowledge may be compromised. To ensure high-quality knowledge, we ¯rst

store newly acquired pieces of knowledge into a temporary knowledge base and move
only the validated knowledge into the main knowledge base.
In this validation process, we employ a concept of gami¯ed crowdsourcing similar
to the one explored by Kurita et al.9 More speci¯cally, we make simple yes/no quizzes
from the contents of the temporary knowledge base, which we present to the users.
When enough votes for agreeing with contents are accumulated, the corresponding
knowledge contents are judged to be correct, and are incorporated into the main
knowledge base. As an incentive to users, we award points based on a user's past
inputs. If they contribute to the validation process, they are given rewards. Block-
chain technology is utilized to record the users' input and ensure the transparency of
the reward calculation.
This paper is a revised version of our paper presented at the 12th Asian Con-
ference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS 2020).10 There
are two major di®erences from the original paper: (1) we clarify the organization of a
blockchain-assisted gami¯ed crowdsourcing system and implement a prototype
system and (2) using the prototype system we developed, we conduct simulation
experiments with additional parameters to investigate the characteristics of the
proposed approach including di®erent task selection strategies. We also conduct a
small real-life experiment and con¯rm the e®ectiveness of the proposed approach.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some
related work focusing on the application of blockchain for handling knowledge, and
Section 3 presents the knowledge re¯nement process. Section 4 describes the orga-
nization of the prototype implementation we used for experiments, and in Sec. 5, we
report the simulation experiments that use the prototype and discuss their results.
Section 6 presents a small real-life experiment we conducted to verify the knowledge
re¯nement process with human users, and Sec. 7 concludes this paper.
2. Related Work
Blockchain was developed as an underlying technology for cryptocurrency and was
intended for use as the public ledger for transactions on a network. Blockchain is now
applied not only to cryptocurrency but also to other areas, such as health care, data
provenance, and mobile communication networks.11 Blockchain is also used as a
platform for crowdsourcing. For example, CrowdBC is a blockchain-based decen-
tralized crowdsourcing platform that makes use of smart contracts to achieve reli-
ability with low service cost.12 zkCrowd is another blockchain-based platform that
separates a blockchain into a public chain and private subchains so that users'
privacy can be maintained while keeping transaction transparency.13 These systems
are intended to provide a domain-independent platform for crowdsourcing. Fur-
thermore, blockchain is used in the game industry as a basis for maintaining rule
transparency.14 Applications to gami¯ed crowdsourcing are also mentioned as po-
tential areas to be explored.

Another notable application area is the Internet of Things (IoT). The mobile
crowd sensing (MCS) platform was developed using blockchain.15 Here, a market-
like idea was introduced in handling sensed data to maintain both privacy and
security. The proposed platform focuses particularly on an incentive mechanism for
rewards. A blockchain is also utilized to construct a knowledge market in which IoT
systems that perform arti¯cial intelligence (AI) tasks at the edge of networks can
exchange knowledge in a peer-to-peer fashion.16 For AI systems that require a large
dataset, it is important to provide a proper incentive mechanism to continuously
update the dataset.17 Blockchain is also used as a basis for such a platform where a
concept of gami¯cation is introduced.
For knowledge management in enterprises, Knowledge Blockchain was proposed18
to audit knowledge evolution and provide proof of provenance of knowledge. Block-
chain is also utilized in access control of a knowledgemanagement system.19Aplatform
for smart city was also developed using blockchain.20 This platform calledWeValue is
intended to be a platform for social value exchange and co-creation. It assumes
transactions between unknown people in a trust-less distributed environment.
Blockchain can be viewed as a decentralized database where data from partici-
pants are stored transparently. Knowledge graphs represented in the Resource De-
scription Framework (RDF) are stored using a blockchain technology, called
GraphChain.21 Blockchain is also applied to the decentralized construction of
knowledge graphs.22 In this system, company-level domain knowledge about
employees' skills is constructed from the participation of employees in the company.
This system also introduces a voting scheme and a reward mechanism for employees
who contribute to knowledge construction. AUDABLOK is another example of a
blockchain application; it was proposed as a software framework to allow citizens to
participate in re¯ning open data.23 In AUDABLOK, blockchain is utilized to audit
users' contributions and provide rewards to users.
In this paper, we emphasize on the validation process of knowledge contents by
casual users, where no centralized trusted authority is assumed. We also conduct
simulation experiments to examine its characteristics.
3. Knowledge Re¯nement Process
3.1. Target knowledge base
In this study, we chose the knowledge contents used in our word retrieval assistant
system8 as a target knowledge base. A typical problem for people with aphasia is
word-¯nding di±culty, where they have a clear image of what they want to say, but
cannot recall a proper word to express it. This is similar to the situation when you
visit a foreign country and you do not know how to say what you want in the local
language.
For this kind of di±culty, a human caregiver called a conversation partner often
provides assistance by asking a series of questions, such as Is it food? or Is its color

red? Through this kind of question and answer, the conversation partner extracts the
name of the thing the person with aphasia wants to express.
The word retrieval assistant system is intended to provide a similar function to a
human conversation partner, but using a computer. The system contains a knowl-
edge base about relevant things and generates appropriate questions to ask the user.
According to the user's replies, the next question to ask is determined.
In the early prototype system, knowledge is represented as a triple of subject,
predicate, and object as in the RDF. For example, the fact that the color of the apple
is red can be represented as (<apple>, <color>, <red>).
3.2. Knowledge acquisition and re¯nement
It is important to acquire enough knowledge for the word retrieval assistant system
to work properly. There are several methods to construct a knowledge base. System
developers construct knowledge contents manually from scratch, or the system lets a
user input the correct word when it is not produced by the system.24 We may extract
knowledge from data available on the Internet, such as Wikipedia. Alternatively, we
may use a framework of crowdsourcing to elicit inputs from many casual users. When
data for a triple are needed, we may present an input form that consists of three
items, one or two of which are blank so that a user can ¯ll them in. To facilitate such
a process, gami¯cation concepts can be applied. For example, such an input form
can be presented as a quiz to a user; when a user answers the quiz, points are given
to the user.
One of the problems with data acquired using such methods is that they may not
be correct. To assure the knowledge contents are of high quality, it is necessary to
validate the correctness of newly acquired triples before they are used. The acquired
knowledge contents are ¯rst stored in the temporary knowledge base, and the
knowledge contents validated by users are moved into the main knowledge base.
To validate the contents of the temporary knowledge base, we employ a yes/no
quiz. Suppose that the triple (<apple>, <color>, <red>) is in the temporary
knowledge base. A yes/no quiz is presented to a user to ask whether the color of the
apple is red. The user may answer YES, NO, or DON’T KNOW. If a certain number
of YES votes are obtained, the triple is considered to be correct and is moved into the
main knowledge base.
This process is formulated into a kind of game. After a user starts a game, a yes/
no quiz sentence is presented with the possible choices of YES, NO, DON’T KNOW,
and END. If the user answers END, the game session ends.
For triples that are used in the game session, we check whether enough votes
(YES or NO) are obtained for the triple as the results of the game playing so far. We
set a certain threshold S, and check whether a triple has accumulated more than S
votes. If the triple has accumulated more than S votes and the ratio of YES votes
over the total number of votes for the triple is greater than a threshold �, then the
triple is judged to be correct. The triple is removed from the temporary knowledge

base and moved into the main knowledge base. Similarly, if the ratio of NO votes
over the total number of votes for the triple is greater than a threshold �, the triple is
judged to be incorrect and is removed from the temporal knowledge base.
When a triple is judged to be correct, the users who voted YES for this triple are
given rewards. Similarly, when a triple is judged to be incorrect, the users who voted
NO for this triple are given rewards. This check is performed for all the triples that
appeared in the game session.
3.3. Use of blockchain
As explained in Sec. 3.2, the rewards to be given to a user can be calculated only after
a certain number of votes have been collected. The rewards are calculated on the
basis of the logs of the game sessions. To ensure transparency of the reward calcu-
lation, the game logs are stored in the blockchain. As shown in Fig. 1, when a game
session ends, the inputs made by a user are stored in a new block, which includes the
user's Id, the Id of the triple corresponding to the quiz the user answered, an answer
from the user, and its timestamp. After the new block is added to the blockchain, a
history of all users' inputs for the triples in the game session are obtained from the
blockchain. If a triple has gathered enough votes to be judged correct or incorrect, its
status is updated accordingly, and the rewards for the users who contributed to the
votes are determined.
Rewards are calculated from the users' contributions to the validation of triples.
Since the triple validation process depends on past results of the game executions, it
is necessary to access the game execution logs stored in the blockchain to calculate
the rewards. To reduce the data transfer amount from the blockchain server, rewards
are calculated at the blockchain server, and the blockchain server is equipped with an
application programming interface (API) that returns the reward values. Since the
calculation of the rewards basically depends linearly on the size of the log (the length

of blockchain), it would not cause a major problem. This is similar in spirit to a smart
contract, which de¯nes computations that are triggered when speci¯ed conditions
are met at the blockchain server.
4. Prototype Implementation
Figure 2 shows the con¯guration of our early prototype, which is constructed as a
chatbot system utilizing LINE messaging service,a a popular chat service in Japan
and other countries. It is also popular as a platform for the chatbot. A user can access
the system via a smartphone so that it can be used in a small amount of spare time.
When the user starts interacting with the chatbot, the chatbot presents a quiz
that displays the sentence generated from a target triple and three buttons (YES,
NO, DON’T KNOW) to input the user's response along with a button to end the
game (Fig. 3(a)). When the game ends, a summary of the game results is presented
(Fig. 3(b)).
To implement the user interface with a chatbot that uses the LINE messaging
service, the prototype includes a Game server that provides a Web API for pro-
cessing a request to be sent from the LINE server. This request corresponds to the
input from a user, and its response should contain the output to present to the user.
The knowledge contents (triples) to be validated are stored in the temporary
knowledge base. When a start command is sent from a user via the LINE system, a
triple to be validated is selected. From the triple, a quiz is created and sent to the
user. The response from the user is stored in the Game server. When the user ends a
game session, the logs from that game session are sent to the Blockchain server where
they are entered into a new block of the blockchain. The response from the Block-
chain server includes a list of newly validated or invalidated triples. The newly
validated triples are moved from the temporary knowledge base to the main
knowledge base, and invalidated triples are removed from the temporary knowledge

base. Then, the Game server presents the points earned in this game session to the
user (Fig. 4).
We used the implementation of Naivechainb for blockchain. Naivechain imple-
mentation includes a Web API to add a new block to the blockchain. We added some
Web APIs to interact with the Game server, as shown in Table 1.
When the Blockchain server receives a game session log, it is stored in a newly
created block. In addition, all the triples in the game session logs are checked if they
have collected enough votes to be judged correct or incorrect. The results are
returned to the Game server as described above. In addition, if a triple is newly
determined to be correct or not, rewards are given to the users who contributed to
making the decision (Fig. 5). The rewards a user earned can be accessed by the Web
API of the Blockchain server, as mentioned in Sec. 3.3.

5. Simulation Experiments
5.1. Purpose and methods
5.1.1. Simulation environment
To examine the characteristics of the proposed approach, we conducted simulation
experiments by building a bot program that behaves as a human user (as shown in
the dashed lines in Fig. 2). We also added a Web API to the Game server, which
accepts a request from the bot program. The request from the bot program is similar
to a request sent from the LINE server except that it does not contain any au-
thentication information to work with the LINE service.
5.1.2. User model
We constructed a simple user model that controls the bot program. This user model
contains the following parameters:
. Accuracy: user i ð1 � i � NÞ answers correctly with probability paccðiÞ.

are answered.
5.1.3. Simulation conditions
The conditions of the simulation are set as follows:
. The number of triples (M) is set to 1000, and the number of virtual users (N) is set
to 1000.
. All the triples are assumed to be true. Thus, when user i is supposed to answer
either YES or NO, user i answers YES with probability paccðiÞ.
. A user is selected from a set of N users in sequence, and the selected user plays a
game. After ki quizzes are answered, one game session ends. The value of ki is set
randomly from the range of ½3; 7� for all user i.

. When one game session ends, we check whether there are newly validated triples.
The threshold for judging a triple to be correct or not (S) is set to 10, and the
threshold ratio for judging the triple to be correct (�) is set to 0:8. Thus, a triple
that accumulates 10 votes, among which more than eight votes are for YES, is
judged to be correct. The users who voted YES for this triple are given 100 points
as a reward. After triples to be validated are determined and rewards are calcu-
lated, the next user is selected and another game session is started.
. One simulation run is terminated when there are no more triples to present to any
user. The same triple will not be used as a game to the same user twice. Once a
triple is removed from the temporary knowledge base, it is not used for a game
again.
5.2. Results and discussion
5.2.1. Triple selection strategy
When yes/no quizzes are used to validate triples, the order of the quizzes to present
to a user has an impact on e±ciency. We tested three variations in selecting the next
triple to use for a yes/no quiz. When the next triple was searched for, the triples that
had already been used for the target users were removed ¯rst. Then, from the
remaining triples, we used the following strategies to select the next triple to use as
a quiz:
. Random: a triple is selected randomly; this is the baseline strategy.
. Narrow: a triple that has been presented to users more often is given a higher
priority. This method e®ectively focuses on triples to validate. More speci¯cally,
each triple is given a weight equivalent to 10 times the number of times it has been
used as a question to users.
. Wide: a triple that has been presented to users less often is given a higher priority.
This method e®ectively broadens the range of target triples. More speci¯cally, each
triple is given a weight equivalent to 10 times the maximum number of times any
triple has been used as a question minus the number of times the particular triple
has been used as a question.
In the simulation experiments conducted to examine the e®ects of di®erent
strategies, user i's accuracy (paccðiÞ) was randomly set according to the normal
distribution with a mean of 0:8 and a standard deviation of 0:067. User i's con¯dence
(pconfðiÞ) was similarly set according to the normal distribution with a mean of 0:8
and a standard deviation of 0:067.
Simulations were run three times. Table 2 shows the average number of validated
triples in these simulation runs. The table indicates that these yes/no quizzes can
validate enough triples. The table also shows the average length of the blockchain for
each strategy.

How the number of validated triples changes through a series of game sessions is
in°uenced by a triple selection strategy, as shown in Fig. 6, which plots the number
of validated triples against the number of game sessions in one simulation run for
three di®erent strategies. As Fig. 6 shows, after a certain number of games, the
number of validated triples rapidly increases and then saturates for the random and
wide strategies. Among the three strategies, the wide strategy is slow to validate the
triples, but the number of validated triples gradually increases compared with
the random strategy. Although the narrow strategy shows a steady increase in the
number of validated triples, it is soon surpassed by the other strategies.
5.2.2. User reliability
We ran another set of simulations under di®erent conditions, taking user reliability
into consideration. Each user's reliability was determined based on their contribution
to the validation of triples. The threshold S for determining whether a triple is valid
was set according to the sum of the reliability of the users who voted for the triple so

that fewer users are required to validate a triple when users with a high reliability
vote for it. This process was expected to lead to fewer games required for validation.
In the simulation experiments, the reliability of user i, Ri, was set as Ri ¼
minð0:2� contri þ 1; 3Þ where contri denotes user i's contribution, which is the
number of times user i received rewards. The range of Ri is 1 � Ri � 3, meaning that
a user of high reliability counts as, at most, three users.
Figure 7 plots the changes in the number of validated triples of the cases with and
without taking user reliability taken into consideration. In these simulation runs,
user i's accuracy (paccðiÞ) was set to a uniform random number between 0:6 and 1:0,
and the user's con¯dence was set to a uniform random number between 0:6 and 1:0.
The three strategies mentioned in Sec. 5.2.1 were used. As seen in this chart, the
number of game sessions required to validate triples was decreased by taking the
user's reliability into consideration. Although it is not certain if it introduces adverse
e®ects such as erroneously validating triples, the number of games necessary to
validate triples can be decreased by introducing the user's reliability.
5.2.3. Contribution of users
We also ran simulation experiments to investigate the relationship between the
user's accuracy/con¯dence values and the user's contribution to the validation
process. We set the user's accuracy and con¯dence to a random number with uniform
distribution between 0:6 and 1:0. Figure 8 shows the result of one simulation run with
a random strategy. In this simulation run, the Spearman's rank coe±cient

user's con¯dence and contribution it was 0:392. Figure 9 shows the relationship
between the user's accuracy and the user's contribution, and Fig. 10 shows the
relationship between the user's con¯dence and the user's contribution. As can be seen
in these charts, generally the more accurate and con¯dent a user is, the higher the
user's contribution.

Furthermore, we divided 1000 users into four groups with di®erent accuracy and
con¯dence values and ran a simulation to see what di®erences were introduced
among the four groups in terms of the user's contribution. The user's accuracy and
con¯dence values were set randomly according to the normal distribution with a
mean of 0:9 (high) or 0:7 (low) and a standard deviation of 0:03. Four groups were
composed based on the combination of median values of high and low in the user's
accuracy and con¯dence values. Table 3 shows the average of three simulation runs
of the maximum, median, and minimum of the user's contributions in each group.
Additionally, Fig. 11 shows the distributions of the resulting user's contributions for
each group for one simulation run. As these results indicate, a group with high

accuracy tends to make a higher contribution. The user's con¯dence also contributes
to the user's contribution, but its e®ect is less than that of the user's accuracy.
6. Real-life Experiment
In addition to simulation experiments, we conducted a small experiment with human
users using the prototype system implemented as a bot system (LINE bot) imple-
mented on the LINE messaging service as described in Sec. 4.
6.1. Consensus algorithm
Naivechain, blockchain implementation used in the simulation experiments de-
scribed above, does not implement a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work
(PoW) to validate blockchains in a distributed environment. From the viewpoint of
examining the characteristics of the proposed knowledge validation process, it is not
considered a major problem. However, in this real-life experiment, we added a simple
PoW mechanism, as proposed in the bitcoin white paper.25 In this PoW mechanism,
a so-called miner generates a new block. A block generation task is controlled by a
di±culty parameter. When a block is generated, a hash value is calculated. The value
of di±culty speci¯es the condition that the generated hash value needs to be satis¯ed.
In this experiment, we adopted a typical implementation where the value of di±culty
speci¯es the number of leading zeros of a binary representation of the generated hash
value. To obtain the hash value that satis¯es the condition, an additional parameter

(nonce) was included in the calculation of the hash value. Nonce was incremented by
one until the desired hash value was obtained.
The value of di±culty parameter controls the mining rate, the speed of generating
a block. In a public blockchain setting, di±culty is dynamically adjusted to control
the mining rate. In this small experiment, we set the initial value of di±culty to 3 and
adjusted it every 30 s by increasing or decreasing its value by 1 according to the rate
of block generation so far.
Several other consensus algorithms have been proposed,26 especially for a private
blockchain; the PoW scheme may not be appropriate as it tends to incur considerable
power consumption. The consensus algorithm needs to be selected according to the
deployed environment.
6.2. Method
We created 40 triples to be validated in the experiment, part of which are shown in
Table 4. Among them, 30 were true triples and 10 were false triples. These triples
were chosen so that their truthfulness could be determined easily.
We recruited participants through social networking services, and 43 users joined
the experiment. Most of them were university students who were active users of the
LINE messaging service. We asked them to add the prototype chatbot system as a
friend on the LINE messaging service. When the bot was added as a friend, the terms
of the experiment were shown, which stated that a participant had the right to quit a
game at any time without penalty and that no personal information would be stored
in the log. A game was started only after the participant agreed with these terms.
The parameters used in the experiments were basically the same as those used in
the simulation experiments described in Sec. 5. Namely, the threshold for judging a
triple to be correct or not (S) was set to 10. The threshold ratio for judging the triple
to be correct or not (�) was set to 0:8. The value of reward given was set to 100. We
used the narrow strategy of selecting the next quiz because the number of triples
validated can increase even when the number of games is low. We did not consider
the user's reliability described in Sec. 5.2.2.
6.3. Results and discussion
When all the games ended by 43 participants, 33 triples were either validated or
invalidated, amounting to 82:5% of all the triples prepared. Among 33 triples, 23 true

triples were validated and 10 false triples were invalidated. All triples were correctly
validated or invalidated; no true triples were judged false or vice versa.
We plotted the changes in the number of validated/invalidated triples according
to the number of games sessions conducted as shown in Fig. 12. In addition to the
total number of triples (in)validated, this ¯gure also plots its breakdown of true and
false triples. As shown in the ¯gure, the overall tendency is the same as that of the
simulation experiments.
As can seen in Fig. 12, after the certain number of game sessions the number of
validated triples does not change because of the limited number of participants. The
participants who joined the experiment later only answered the quizzes that were not
judged to be correct or incorrect due to receiving few votes, and they received zero
rewards. Note that if other participants joined later and the remaining triples were
validated/invalided, they had a chance to receive rewards.
We examined the log of the 29 participants who received some rewards, excluding
those who received no rewards as they joined the experiment later or answered
DON’T KNOW to all quizzes. The average ratio of answering either YES or NO, that
is, not answering DON’T KNOW, to the number of quizzes presented was 0:955,
which corresponds to the con¯dence of a user model in the simulation experiments.
The average ratio of correctly answering a question was 0:815, which corresponds to
the accuracy of a user model. The Spearman's rank coe±cient correlation between
the participants' accuracy and rewards earned was 0:502. There was a moderate

positive relationship between the participant's accuracy and rewards as in the sim-
ulation experiments. More than half of the participants had a con¯dence value of 1,
and there was little variation in con¯dence values. For these reasons, we observed no
particular correlation between the participants' con¯dence and rewards in this ex-
periment. Overall, it can be said that triples can e®ectively be validated with human
users using the proposed method.
7. Conclusion and Future Work
This paper described the use of gami¯ed crowdsourcing for re¯ning knowledge base.
We adopted blockchain technology to ensure transparency of the user reward cal-
culation. We also created a simple user model and conducted simulation experiments
with many virtual users and three di®erent methods for selecting the next task
(quiz). These results indicate that the proposed approach can be used as a method for
validating knowledge contents. In addition, the di®erent strategies result in di®er-
ences in the number of validated triples as the game sessions progress. We can select
a suitable strategy for a given situation that is characterized by the number of triples
to be validated and the number of users.
In this paper, we focused on the process of validating the knowledge contents
already in the knowledge base. As there are many aspects in the knowledge base
building, we plan to extend the proposed approach to the process of gathering
knowledge contents by introducing other types of quizzes.
Furthermore, one of the bene¯ts of blockchain technology is its distributed na-
ture. Future work includes using it to distribute the knowledge re¯nement process
over the network so that it can be easily scaled up.
