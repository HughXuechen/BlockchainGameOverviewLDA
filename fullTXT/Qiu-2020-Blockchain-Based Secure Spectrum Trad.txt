Abstract—Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to
be widely deployed as an integral component in the next gen-
eration cellular networks, where spectrum sharing between the
aerial and terrestrial communication systems will play an impor-
tant role. However, there exist significant security and privacy
challenges due to the untrusted broadcast features and wire-
less transmission of the UAV networks. This article endeavors
to resolve the security issues through proposing a novel privacy-
preserving secure spectrum trading and sharing scheme based
on blockchain technology. Specifically, from the operator’s per-
spective, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is first introduced,
in which a primary mobile network operator (MNO) leases its
owned spectrum to a secondary UAV network in exchange for
some revenue from the UAV operators. To address the poten-
tial security issues, a spectrum blockchain framework is then
proposed to illustrate detailed operations of how the blockchain
helps to improve the spectrum trading environment. Under this
framework, a Stackelberg game is formulated to jointly maximize
the profits of the MNO and the UAV operators considering
uniform and nonuniform pricing schemes. Security assessment
and numerical results confirm the security and efficiency of
our schemes for spectrum sharing in UAV-assisted cellular
networks.

cost, high mobility, and deployment flexibility [1]–[3]. They
can be deployed either as aerial base stations to enhance the
network capacity and expand the coverage for existing terres-
trial networks [4], [5], or as mobile user equipment to carry
out delivery or surveillance tasks in the sky [6], [7].
Despite many potential applications, to fully reap the ben-
efits of deploying UAVs for communication purposes, some
core technical challenges still need to be faced with. On the
one hand, most UAVs in the market basically operate on the
unlicensed spectrum (e.g., the industrial, scientific, and medi-
cal bands), which is usually of limited data rate, unreliable, and
vulnerable to interference, thus severely restricting the poten-
tial performance of UAVs [8]. On the other hand, there always
exist significant security and privacy threats for UAV-assisted
wireless communications due to the untrusted broadcast fea-
tures and wireless transmission of UAV networks. However,
these problems have not been well studied in existing works.
These observations motivate us to focus on investigating
the spectrum usage for UAV-assisted cellular networks while
considering the security and privacy issues in this article.
B. Related Work
Due to the scarcity of wireless spectrum, UAVs always need
to share the spectrum with existing communication systems
(e.g., cellular networks with licensed spectrum). However,
traditional spectrum sharing mechanisms through spectrum
sensing [9], [10] or spectrum databases [11] are actually not
efficient for UAV-assisted cellular networks, because spec-
trum sensing is generally imperfect and subject to sensing
errors while spectrum databases are based on centralized man-
agement. It is challenging to apply these methods into UAV
networks to achieve distributed and reliable communications.
To deal with these challenges, some researchers attempt to
exploit the property-right spectrum sharing techniques operat-
ing based on an agreement where the spectrum owners lease
or share their spectrum to the unlicensed ones in exchange
for some certain services [12], [13]. However, these works do
not take into account the practical challenges of UAV deploy-
ments for cellular services from the perspective of operators. In
fact, UAVs and ground base stations often belong to multiple
different operators, each selfishly seeking to maximize their
individual benefit. In general, the cellular network operators
will be not willing to share their own spectrum to the UAV

networks, since the total usable bandwidth of the cellular
networks is limited, and sharing part of the total bandwidth
with UAVs may harm the capacity of the cellular base sta-
tions. Thus, to promote the adoption of spectrum sharing, some
incentive mechanisms should be developed to motivate the
mutual cooperation between the operators.
Incentive mechanism design has been extensively stud-
ied for networking problems, such as caching [14], [15],
traffic/computation offloading [16], [17], cooperative com-
munications [18], etc. However, none of them consider the
UAV-assisted application scenarios. Besides, existing incen-
tive mechanisms with high complexity and centralized control
may not be suitable for UAV networks when considering the
energy constraint and distributed features of UAV networks.
Recently, Hu et al. [19] investigated the use of contract
theory to formulate the spectrum trading problem between
the macro base station manager and the UAV operators
to encourage the macro base station manager to lease its
owned bandwidth to the UAVs. However, there are significant
security and privacy challenges for such peer-to-peer (P2P)
spectrum trading in UAV-assisted cellular networks for the
following reasons.
1) It is insecure for mobile network operators (MNOs) to
carry out large-scale spectrum trading in an untrusted
and nontransparent trading environment, where mali-
cious UAV operators could heavily threaten cellular
network’s security through malicious exploitation, e.g.,
falsification, advertising fraudulent spectrum demands,
etc.
2) In traditional centralized spectrum trading, there is an
intermediary managing the trading among the operators,
which may suffer from problems, such as single point
of failure and privacy leakage.
In recent years, blockchain technology [20]–[22] has
attracted growing attention of researchers, which may provide
possible solutions addressing the above challenges because
of its advantages of decentralization, anonymity, and trust.
Blockchain is a decentralized ledger-based storage method,
which provides a unique tool for secure transactions in a
distributed manner without trusted agents [23]. Moreover,
in blockchain-based networks, each node manages a copy
of whole or part of a database from the system. These
advantages enable spectrum trading to be executed in a
decentralized, transparent, and secure market environment.
Some recent works have explored blockchain to address
the transaction security issues for local P2P networks, such
as the blockchain-based anonymous rewarding scheme for
vehicle-to-grid networks in [24], and utilizing blockchain for
crowdsourcing to preserve the privacy of the participants
in [25] and [26]. However, these methods cannot be directly
employed in localized spectrum trading for energy-limited
UAV networks due to the challenges of the high computation
cost associated with establishing a blockchain. Recently, there
are several works attempting to apply blockchain into UAV
networks. For example, Zhu et al. [27] used blockchain to con-
struct a decentralized information storage platform for air-to-
ground industrial networks. In [28], a neural-blockchain-based
drone-caching approach was designed to ensure ultrareliable
communications. However, spectrum sharing or trading is not
considered in these works. Moreover, they also do not pro-
pose efficient solutions to deal with the high cost for building
a blockchain.
C. Contributions
Motivated by the aforementioned observations, in this arti-
cle, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to
develop a secure spectrum trading system named spectrum
blockchain for UAV-assisted cellular networks. A consortium
blockchain is a special blockchain with multiple preselected
nodes to establish the distributed shared database with mod-
erate cost [29], [30]. To deal with the computation-intensive
blockchain creation and verification process, mobile edge com-
puting is applied to help to offload the computation task
to proximate authorized edge computing nodes. Under the
mobile edge computing aided consortium blockchain frame-
work, secure spectrum trading between the MNO and the
UAV operators with privacy protection can be achieved in a
distributed manner. Moreover, since spectrum pricing along
with the amount of traded spectrum need to be optimized in
the spectrum blockchain, a Stackelberg game is formulated
to jointly maximize the profits of the MNO and the UAV
operators.
Specifically, the contributions of this article are summarized
as follows.
1) A pricing-based incentive mechanism is first presented
to motivate the MNO to open its owned spectrum for
UAV networks, in which the MNO acts as a spectrum
seller and leases the idle spectrum to a secondary UAV
network in exchange for some revenue from the UAV
operators.
2) To address the potential security and privacy issues
caused by malicious attacks in the spectrum trading pro-
cess, a spectrum blockchain framework is proposed to
illustrate the detailed operations of how the blockchain
can help to improve the transaction security without
relying on a third party.
3) Under the blockchain framework, a Stackelberg game is
formulated to obtain the optimal spectrum pricing and
purchasing strategies, which can jointly maximize the
revenues of the MNO and the UAV operators.
4) Two pricing schemes are investigated, including nonuni-
form pricing in which different spectrum prices are
assigned to different UAV operators, and uniform pric-
ing in which the same price applies to all the UAV
operators. In addition, we develop a nonuniform pricing
algorithm and a distributed spectrum price bargaining
algorithm, respectively, for the two different pricing
cases to achieve the optimal solutions.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. The system
model for spectrum trading is introduced in Section II.
Detailed operations of the spectrum blockchain are illustrated
in Section III. In Section IV, a Stackelberg game is formulated
to obtain the optimal pricing and purchasing strategies, consid-
ering two different pricing schemes. Security assessment and
numerical results are shown in Section V before this article is
concluded in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL FOR SPECTRUM TRADING
A. Network Model
We consider a heterogeneous network, in which one cellular
base station owned by the MNO is overlaid with a number of
UAVs possessed by different UAV operators. The set of UAV
operators is denoted by N , N = [1, 2, . . . , N]. Since UAVs
always operate on unlicensed spectrum with limited capacity
that restricts their performances to provide better services for
local mobile users, UAV operators have a strong wish to be
allowed to share spectrum with the MNO. Nevertheless, the
quality of experience (QoE) of cellular users may diminish if
UAVs take up some spectrum owned by a cellular base station
for serving cellular users. Thus, it is difficult for an MNO to
be so altruistic to allow UAV users to access licensed spectrum
without any remuneration.
To deal with the above issues, an incentive mechanism can
be designed to motivate the cooperation between the MNO
and the UAV operators in which the MNO can lease some
idle bandwidth to UAVs in exchange for a certain level of
profit (e.g., revenue) from the UAV networks while the UAVs
will benefit from enhanced quality of service with licensed
spectrum. In this way, both systems can increase their own
interest and a win–win situation can be achieved. Therefore,
in this section, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is intro-
duced to promote spectrum sharing between the cellular and
UAV networks. In particular, we investigate the spectrum leas-
ing problem and design an incentive mechanism at the data
(message) level from a network operator’s perspective, in
which each UAV operator can temporally buy some licensed
spectrum from the MNO to provide better services for its
local mobile users. Detailed design considerations are given
as follows.
B. Utility Function for the Incentive Mechanism
For the MNO, we define μi as the price for each unit of
bandwidth provided to the UAV operator i. Let bi denote the
spectrum that UAV operator i intends to purchase. Under the
pricing-based incentive mechanism, the MNO’s objective is to
maximize its revenue obtained from selling the spectrum to
the UAV operators. Mathematically, the utility function of the
MNO can be modeled as
UMNO(μ, b) =
N∑
i=1
μibi (1)
where μ is the spectrum price vector with μ =
[μ1, μ2, . . . , μN]T , and b is a vector of bandwidth purchased
by UAV operators with b = [b1, b2, . . . , bN]T . Note that ∀i, bi
is actually a function of μi, i.e., bi
�= fi(μi), which indicates
that the amount of the spectrum that each UAV operator is
willing to buy is dependent on its assigned bandwidth price.
Besides, it is assumed that the total available idle bandwidth
of the MNO is Q, i.e., the aggregate allocated spectrum for
all the UAV operators should not be larger than Q, which can
be expressed as
∑N
i=1 bi ≤ Q.
From the spectrum purchaser’s perspective, each UAV oper-
ator i requests spectrum from the MNO according to the real
requirement for serving its own users for a specific application.
Without loss of generality, in this article, the utility function
of an arbitrary UAV operator is defined as
Ui(bi, μi)
�= R(bi, di) − C(bi, μi) (2)
where R(bi, di) is the payoff/benefit gained from allocated
spectrum, with di denoting the basic bandwidth demand of
the UAV which reflects the service type, and C(bi, μi) is the
cost incurred due to buying the spectrum. Note that each UAV
operator’s utility function consists of two parts: 1) payoff and
2) cost. In the following, we present how to model them under
the proposed incentive mechanism.
Payoff: The payoff of a UAV operator i is the benefit or
reward gained from allocated spectrum. In this article, the
payoff is modeled as
R(bi, di) = giH(bi, di) (3)
where H(bi, di) is the spectrum obtainment gain, and gi is a
positive coefficient converting the spectrum obtainment gain
into monetary reward. Here, we define gi as the spectrum coins
that the UAV operator i possesses to pay for the spectrum
received from the MNO. The spectrum coin is one kind of
digital cryptocurrency which is employed to facilite the spec-
trum trading between the MNO and the UAV operators. More
details about the spectrum coins will be given in Section III.
Intuitively, the more spectrum you are allocated, the more gain
you should receive. Thus, H(bi, di) should be an increasing
function of bi. Besides, UAV operators should also take into
account the real demands of serving users when purchasing
bandwidth due to considering the cost of buying spectrum.
In this article, a log function is used to model the spectrum
obtainment gain, i.e.,
H(bi, di) = log2
(
1 + bi
di
)
. (4)
Though other functions (such as linear or exponential func-
tions) can also be used to model the spectrum obtainment gain,
log functions are shown in the literature to be more suitable
to represent the relationship between the network performance
and a large class of elastic data traffic [31], [32]. It is observed
from (4) that when the amount of received spectrum is zero
(bi = 0), the obtained gain H is also equal to zero, while
the gain increases with the increasing of allocated spectrum.
Moreover, H(bi, di) can also reflect the degree of “happi-
ness” of the UAV operator if receiving bandwidth bi under the
demand di. These indicate that (4) is able to capture the rela-
tionship between the UAV operators’ benefit and the received
bandwidth.
Cost: C(bi, μi) denotes the cost incurred when UAV oper-
ator i purchases spectrum from the MNO. In general, the
cost increases with the increasing of the amount of obtained
spectrum. Thus, it can be easily modeled as
C(bi, μi) = μibi. (5)
Therefore, the utility function of an arbitrary UAV operator
can be written as
Ui(bi, μi) = gilog2
(
1 + bi
di
)
− μibi. (6)

Obviously, with a larger bandwidth bi, UAV operator i
can obtain a more satisfactory system performance, however,
this also increases the cost. Therefore, optimal strategies are
needed for a rational operator to balance the cost and achieved
benefit in order to maximize its utility.
C. Security Threats
In the above section, we focus on designing a pricing-based
incentive mechanism for spectrum trading between the cellular
and UAV networks. However, this monetary approach always
needs to rely on trusted centers that may not only leak opera-
tors’ privacy but also be vulnerable to attack. In addition, due
to the untrusted broadcast features and wireless transmission
of the UAV networks, there also exist significant trust issues
which may threaten system security and privacy. Typically,
three kinds of attackers or adversaries may appear.
1) Malicious Spectrum Provider: A malicious cellular oper-
ator who advertises fraudulent spectrum leasing services
without enough available spectrum.
2) Malicious Spectrum Buyer: A malicious UAV operator
who pretends that it has not received any spectrum from
the cellular operator and refuses to pay.
3) Malicious Trusted Third Party: The malicious trust cen-
ter may not only disclose the MNO’s privacy but tamper
the UAV operators’ credit value (e.g., spectrum coins)
for profit.
To deal with these security threats, distributed and trusted
management schemes are needed to identify and defend
against malicious peers. To this end, we exploit blockchain
technology to provide a trusted environment to enhance secure
spectrum trading among the operators.
III. SPECTRUM BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain is a P2P decentralized ledger, which is designed
to efficiently record transactions among participants in a
verifiable and permanent way, without relying on a trusted
center. Blockchain technology enables spectrum trading to be
executed in a distributed, transparent, and secure market envi-
ronment. Thus, in this section, a blockchain-enabled spectrum
blockchain framework is proposed to support secure spectrum
trading between the cellular and UAV operators.
A. Overview of Spectrum Blockchain
The core issue of the blockchain is a computational process-
ing called “mining” (consensus), in which a set of participants
called “miners” need to solve a complex computation problem,
i.e., proof-of-work puzzle, to confirm and secure the integrity
and validity of transactions before adding the records into
the blockchain. The security and privacy of the blockchain
depend on the distributed consensus mechanism managed by
these miners. However, in a traditional public/permissionless
blockchain (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), the consensus
stage is executed by all nodes (miners) which leads to high
cost. To relieve the computation-intensive challenge of estab-
lishing a blockchain, unlike existing works, in this article, we
use consortium blockchain technology to perform distributed

spectrum trading. A consortium blockchain is a special permis-
sioned blockchain in which the consensus process is executed
on preselected nodes with moderate cost.1 Thus, it is more
suitable and feasible for energy-constraint UAV networks.
Moreover, to further solve the high computing power needed in
blockchain creation, we leverage edge computing as a network
enabler to offload the computation-intensive proof-of-work
puzzles to proximate edge computing nodes. Compared to tra-
ditional cloud computing [34], [35], edge computing brings
network resources (e.g., computation or storage resources)
closer to the users which can effectively shorten the trans-
missions delay and reduce the energy consumption [36]. The
practicality of integrating edge computing and blockchain
comes from both the same decentralized infrastructure and the
same functions of storage and computation [37].
The consortium blockchain-based secure spectrum trading
framework is shown in Fig. 1, which consists of the following
major entities.
1) Trusted Authority (TA): The TA is responsible for ini-
tializing the whole spectrum trading system, generating
public parameters and cryptographic keys, and managing
the operators’ identities. Note that the TA only serves as
a parameter initializer to provide identity authorization
and certificate issuance of entities before running spec-
trum blockchain. It will remain offline for most of the
time. That is to say, this role does not conflict with the
decentralization of the blockchain.
2) Spectrum Provider and Requestors: The UAV operators
act as the spectrum requestors to purchase bandwidth
from the spectrum provider. The MNO acts as the spec-
trum provider and leases its own idle licensed spectrum
to the UAV operators in return for reward.
3) Edge Computing Nodes: It is assumed that there are
edge devices (nodes) in the system which can provide
computing and storage services. As shown in Fig. 1,
each edge computing node consists of four components:
a) a transaction server; b) an account pool; c) a memory
pool; and d) a computation server. The transaction server
collects the real-time spectrum requests from the UAV
operators and the price announcements from the MNO,
and transmits the trading-related information among the
MNO and the UAV operators via the core network. Here,

application platforms [33].

QIU et al.: BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURE SPECTRUM TRADING FOR UAV-ASSISTED CELLULAR NETWORKS: OPERATOR’S PERSPECTIVE 455
a digital cryptocurrency named spectrum coin works as
UAV operators’ digital assets to purchase spectrum from
the MNO. Each UAV operator has a virtual wallet to
manage personal spectrum coins. The account pool in
the edge computing nodes records and stores spectrum
coins in the personal wallet of the UAV operators, and
the numerical value of the amount of the MNO’s spec-
trum. The memory pool stores all the transaction records
of local operators. The computation server provides
computing power for the process of block generation
and validation.
4) Smart Counters: A built-in smart counter in each entity
records the amount of traded spectrum in real time. The
UAV operators pay the MNO according to the records
of smart counters.
In the framework, the spectrum trading between the UAV
operators and the MNO are forwarded based on blockchain
technology, in which all the transactions should be announced
to the audit edge computing nodes for verification through
broadcasting, instead of direct transactions among them. In
this way, a secure spectrum trading environment can be
established, which guarantees transaction security and privacy
protection. The detailed mechanism of operation is given in
Section III-C.
B. Design Goals
Based on the proposed blockchain-enabled spectrum trading
scheme, the following properties are expected to be achieved.
1) Operator Authentication: Operators should be authenti-
cated in an anonymous way so that no adversary can
impersonate a registered operator.
2) Privacy: The requests, announcements, and transactions
do not leak any personal information about their sources
(i.e., anonymity).
3) Traceability: The TA can track the identity of an oper-
ator in case of a dispute or something unexpected
occurs.
4) Reliability: According to the design idea of blockchain,
every operator can manage a copy of the whole block
chains of transactions, and each transaction is related to
the phases of spectrum trading. Thus, an entity is unable
to modify the transactions without authorization.
5) Data Confidentiality and Integrity: The contents of any
trading messages should be protected from the operators,
edge computing nodes, and other entities. All accepted
messages should be transmitted without being altered.
C. Operation Details of the Blockchain-Based Secure
Spectrum Trading
As depicted in Fig. 2, there are mainly three parts for
the operation of the spectrum blockchain for secure spectrum
trading.
1) Reputation-Based Miner Selection: Since not all the
edge nodes are trusted in the system, those malicious
edge nodes may falsely modify or discard transaction
records during their mining process. Thus, it is necessary
to design a secure and efficient reputation management
scheme for the edge computing nodes and select the can-
didates with high reputation acting as active miners to
ensure a reliable consensus process.
2) Block Mining and Generation: The selected edge com-
puting nodes then act as miners to collect the transaction
records from the MNO and the UAV operators, and
perform block generation.
3) Block Verification With Consensus Process: A new gen-
erated block needs to be audited by the miners via the
consensus mechanism before storing it. As long as most
miners agree on the block data, this block can be added
into the spectrum blockchain. More details are given in
the subsequent discussions.
1) System Initialization: In the spectrum blockchain, to
guarantee the data integrity and unforgeability, an elliptic curve
digital signature algorithm and asymmetric cryptography [38]
are utilized for system initialization. Every operator becomes a
legitimate entity with proprietary registration information after
passing identity authentication by a TA, such as a govern-
ment department. A UAV operator i can first get its certificate
Certi from the TA and the Certi is used to uniquely identify
itself through binding its registration information, e.g., iden-
tity IDi and license plate number. Then UAV operator i joins
the spectrum blockchain network with its Certi and obtains
its public/private key pair (PKi, SKi), and wallet address addi.
Here, each UAV operator’s account includes its account bal-
ance Bali, certificate Certi, current spectrum coin value gi,
public/private key pair (PKi, SKi), and wallet address addi. The
MNO’s account contains its account balance BalMNO, avail-
able spectrum, public/pricate key pair (PKMNO, SKMNO) and
wallet address addMNO. The asymmetric cryptography scheme
for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of information
transmission is expressed as
DecPKi
(
SigSKi
(H(m))
) = H(m) (7)
where SigSKi
is the digital signature of sender i with private
key, DecPKi is to decode the signed data with sender i’s public
key, H(m) is the hash digest of message m [39]. When exe-
cuting system initialization, each operator uploads its wallet
addresses being used to the account pool of its nearest edge
computing node. Operators check the integrity of their account
and download data about their account from a memory pool
in the edge computing nodes. The memory pool stores all
transaction records in the spectrum blockchain.
2) Reputation-Based Miner Selection: Since not all edge
devices/nodes are trusted, an edge node that wants to be
a miner candidate needs to first submit its identity-related
information to the TA. The TA verifies the validity of the
edge node by estimating its average reputation according to
the feedback information about the reputation opinions from
the operators. Only if its average reputation is higher than a
trust threshold or ranked at the forefront, the edge node can
be issued a legitimate certificate and act as a miner to perform
mining task. Here, to calculate edge nodes’ reputation, a sub-
jective logic model based on historical interactions between the
edge nodes and the operators is utilized, which is a framework
for probabilistic information fusion operated on subjective
beliefs about the world [40]. The subjective logic uses the

term “opinion” to indicate the representation of a subjective
belief, and models positive statements, negative statements,
and uncertainty. It also provides a broad range of logical oper-
ators to combine and relate different opinions [41]. Thus, the
subjective logic model is a suitable mechanism to quantify
the edge computing nodes’ reputation. The basic procedure
of using a subjective logic model for reputation calculation is
given as follows.
Considering an operator opei and an edge node ej, the oper-
ator may interact with the edge node during the spectrum
trading. The trustworthiness (i.e., local opinion) of opei to ej in
the subjective logic can be formally expressed as a local opin-
ion vector ωi→j, i.e., ωi→j := {beli→j, disi→j, unceri→j}, where
beli→j, disi→j, and unceri→j represent the belief, distrust,
and uncertainty, respectively. Here, beli→j, disi→j, unceri→j ∈
[0, 1], and beli→j + disi→j + unceri→j = 1. According to the
subjective logic model, we have
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
beli→j = (
1 − unceri→j
) NPI
NPI+NNI
disi→j = (
1 − unceri→j
) NNI
NPI+NNI
unceri→j = 1 − succei→j
(8)
where NPI is the number of positive interactions, while NNI is
the number of negative interactions. The positive interaction
means that the operators believe that the services provided
by edge computing nodes are relevant and useful. The com-
munication quality succei→j of a link between opei and ej,
i.e., the successful transmission probability of data packets,
determines the uncertainty of local opinion vector unceri→j.
According to ωi→j, the reputation value repi→j represents the
expected belief of operator opei that edge node ej is trusted
and behaves in the spectrum blockchain network, which can
be expressed as
repi→j = beli→j + φunceri→j (9)
where φ ∈ [0, 1] is the given constant indicating an effect
level of the uncertainty for reputation. Operators can calculate
all edge nodes’ reputation based on (8) and (9). Moreover, to
achieve higher credibility and accuracy, a multiweight subjec-
tive logic model can be exploited to characterize the local
opinions, considering different influencing factors, such as
interaction frequency, interaction timeliness, and interaction
effects, while taking into account the recommended opinions
from other operators. Further studies about the multiweight
subjective logical model can refer to [40] and [41].
After calculating the reputation opinions, each operator
votes for y candidates from the edge nodes as the potential
miners according to its local ranking of reputation opinions
for edge nodes. Then, the top k candidates with the highest
reputation are selected to be active miners. These active min-
ers will be authorized by the TA and join in the spectrum
blockchain to carry out trading-related tasks.

3) Trading Spectrum Between MNO and UAV Operators:
UAV operators send spectrum requests to the transaction server
of a nearby miner (i.e., selected edge node). The transaction
server in the edge node counts the total spectrum demands
and broadcasts these demands to the MNO. The edge node
works as a spectrum broker and sets a pricing-based incentive
mechanism (as shown in Section II) to attract MNO for par-
ticipation in the spectrum trading. Motivated by the incentive
mechanism, the MNO determines its initial spectrum to be
leased and the corresponding price and gives responses to the
transaction server. The transaction server then coordinates and
matches the spectrum supply and demand among the opera-
tors. According to the pricing-based incentive mechanism in
Section II, it can be seen that both the MNO and the UAV
operators are rational and selfish in the process of spectrum
trading, in which all of them attempt to maximize their own
benefits. Thus, to balance spectrum demand and supply in our
spectrum blockchain, a solution for analyzing and determin-
ing the optimal spectrum price for the MNO and the optimal
spectrum requests for the UAV operators is necessary. Here,
a game-theoretic method is used to execute spectrum negotia-
tions and transactions between the seller and the buyers. More
details about the optimal spectrum trading strategies based on
game theory will be given in Section IV.
After spectrum trading, a UAV operator transfers spectrum
coins from its wallet to the wallet address given by the MNO.
The MNO obtains the latest blockchain data from the memory
pool of edge nodes to verify this payment activity. The UAV
operators generate new transaction records, and the MNO veri-
fies and digitally signs the transaction records and thus uploads
the records to blockchain miners for audit.
4) Block Mining and Generation: Edge nodes collect all
local transaction records between spectrum seller and buyers
during a certain period, and then encrypt and digitally sign
these records to guarantee authenticity and accuracy. As shown
in part 2 of Fig. 2, all the transaction records are packaged into
blocks. A block consists of a transaction set, a timestamp, a
hash value of preblock, and other information that are signifi-
cant to record. For traceability and verification, each block has
a unique and cryptographic hash to prior blocks in the spec-
trum blockchain. Similar to that in Bitcoin, the edge nodes try
to find their own valid proof-of-work about data audit (i.e., a
hash value meeting a certain level of difficulty) [42]. Each edge
node calculates the hash value of its block based on a random
nonce value ϕ, timestamp, transactions’ Merkel root, and his-
torical block hash value and so on (denoted as previousdata),
which is written as
Hash
(
ϕ + previousdata
)
< Ndifficulty (10)
where Ndifficulty is a number that can be adjusted by the system
to control the speed of finding out the specific nonce value
ϕ [43]. Each authorized edge node (miner) in the spectrum
blockchain competes to create a block by finding a valid proof-
of-work (i.e., nonce value ϕ). After a valid proof-of-work is
found, the fastest miner works as a leader and broadcasts the
block and the specific nonce value to other edge nodes in
the spectrum blockchain for audit and verification. If other
edge nodes agree on the block, data information in this new

data to these edge nodes once again for audit;

block will be added to the spectrum blockchain in a linear
and chronological order, and the fastest miner is awarded by
spectrum coins.
5) Block Verification With Consensus Process: To ensure
that each authorized node in the system has a copy of the
recognized version of the whole blockchain, the audit stage,
i.e., the block verification with consensus process should be
carried out. To this end, a distributed consensus algorithm is
proposed in Algorithm 1 to reach consensus efficiently in the
spectrum blockchain. More details are given as follows.
As shown in part 3 of Fig. 2, the miner leader first broad-
casts block data Block_data, timestamp, and the specific ϕ
to other authorized edge nodes for audit. In order to achieve
mutual supervision and verification, these edge nodes check
the block data and broadcast their audit results with signa-
tures to each other. After receiving the audit results, each edge
node compares its result with others and sends a reply back
to the miner leader. The reply is made up of the edge node’s
signatures, audit result, comparison result, and the records of
received audit results. The leader performs statistics analysis of
received replies from edge nodes. If the block data is approved
by all the edge nodes, i.e., reaching consensus, the leader will
broadcast records, including current audited block data and
a corresponding signature to all authorized edge nodes for

storage. Then, the new block is added into the consortium
blockchain in a linear and chronological order, which con-
tains a cryptographic hash to the prior block. At the same time,
every node synchronizes its local copy of the blockchain with
the new block. However, if some edge nodes do not agree on
the block data, the leader needs to check the audit results and
send the ledger update requests to these edge nodes once again
for audit if necessary. At last, the block that fails to pass the
verification will be discarded, and the implementation phase
goes back to the step of block mining and generation for the
next round of consensus process.
IV. OPTIMAL SPECTRUM TRADING STRATEGIES
In this section, we present the problem definition for the
spectrum pricing and the amount of traded spectrum between
the MNO and the UAV operators, and analyze the optimal
strategies that are made in Section III-C to maximize the util-
ities of both sides during the spectrum blockchain management
process.
A. Problem Formulation
In Section II, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is intro-
duced to motivate the spectrum trading between the cellular
networks and the UAV networks. Since both MNO and UAV
operators are selfish and rational entities who try to pursue
personal utility maximization in a distributed manner, it is
obvious that game theory is the most suitable tool to analyze
the problem. The game should involve two phases, in which
the MNO first announces the initial price of the spectrum to
be leased and the UAV operators then request the spectrum
according to the price. Thus, it is reasonable to formulate the
process as a Stackelberg game [44], [45].
A Stackelberg game is a strategic game that consists of a
leader and several followers competing with each other on
certain resources. In this article, we formulate the MNO as
the leader, and the UAV operators as the followers. The leader
(i.e., MNO) needs to finally find the optimal spectrum price μ
to maximize its revenue within its limited available spectrum.
Every follower (i.e., UAV operator) will respond with the best
amount of spectrum request (i.e., bi) based on the price given
by the leader. The optimization problems can be formulated
as follows.
Leader’s Spectrum Pricing:
max
μ�0
UMNO(μ, b) (11)
s.t.
N∑
i=1
bi ≤ Q. (12)
Follower’s Spectrum Purchasing:
max
bi≥0
Ui(bi, μi) (13)
where UMNO(μ, b) and Ui(bi, μi) are defined in (1) and (6),
respectively.
The above problems together form a Stackelberg game.
The objective is to find the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE)
point(s) from which neither the leader (MNO) nor the fol-
lowers (UAV operators) have incentives to deviate. For the
proposed Stackelberg game, the SE is defined as follows.
Definition 1 (SE): Let μ∗ be a solution for the spectrum pric-
ing problem and b∗
i be a solution for the spectrum purchasing
problem of the ith UAV operator. Then the point (μ∗, b∗) is an
SE for the proposed Stackelberg game if for any (μ, b) with
μ � 0 and b � 0, the following conditions are satisfied:
UMNO
(
μ∗, b∗) ≥ UMNO
(
μ, b∗) (14)
Ui
(
b∗
i ,μ
∗) ≥ Ui
(
bi,μ
∗). (15)
Note that the same or different prices can be charged to the
UAV operators, which here are referred to as the uniform and
nonuniform pricing schemes, respectively. In the following, we
use the backward induction method to analyze the Stackelberg
game under these two pricing schemes.
B. Nonuniform Pricing Scheme
The nonuniform pricing scheme is first considered, in which
the MNO can set different unit prices for leasing spectrum
to different UAV operators. If the spectrum price for a UAV
operator i is donated as μi, the optimal spectrum purchasing
problem can be written as
Problem 1: max
bi≥0
gilog2
(
1 + bi
di
)
− μibi. (16)
It is observed that the objective function is a concave function
over bi, and the constraint is affine. Thus, Problem 1 is a con-
vex optimization problem. For a convex optimization problem,
the optimal solution must satisfy the Karush–Kuhn–Tucher
(KKT) conditions. Therefore, by solving the KKT conditions,
the optimal solution for Problem 1 can be obtained in the
following theorem.
Theorem 1: For a given bandwidth price μi, the optimal
solution for Problem 1 is given by
b∗
i =
{ gi
μi ln 2 − di, if μi <
gi
di ln 2
0, if μi ≥ gi
di ln 2 .
(17)
Proof: Refer to Appendix A.
From Theorem 1, it is observed that if the bandwidth price is
too high, i.e., μi ≥ [gi/(di ln 2)], UAV operator i will not buy
any bandwidth, which indicates that operator i will not par-
ticipate in the game. Besides, under the same spectrum price,
more bandwidth is allocated to the UAV operator with higher
spectrum coins for the same demand type. Substituting (17)
into MNO’s optimal pricing strategies, i.e., combining (11)
and (12), the optimization problem at the MNO side can be
written as

where (·)+ �= max(·, 0). Note that the objection function is
a convex function of μ, while the maximization of a convex

function is generally nonconvex which is difficult to solve.
However, it is shown in the following that the above problem
can be converted to a series of convex subproblems.
For UAV operator i (i = 1, 2, . . . , N), we introduce the
following indicator function:
χi =
{
1, if μi <
gi
di ln 2
0, otherwise.
(20)
Then, Problem 2 can be reformulated as
Problem 2a: max

)
(21)
s.t.
N∑

)
≤ Q (22)
χi ∈ {0, 1},∀i (23)
where χ
�= [χ1, χ2, . . . , χN]T . It is observed that the above
problem is still nonconvex due to χ . Nevertheless, for a given
indicator vector χ , it is easy to verify that Problem 2a is con-
vex. Under this observation, we consider a special case of
Problem 2a by assuming that the total available bandwidth of
MNO is sufficient large (i.e., Q is large enough) such that
all the requests from the UAV operators are admitted. As a
result, the indicators for all UAV operators are equal to 1,
i.e., μi < [gi/(di ln 2)], ∀i. Then, Problem 2a can be further
converted to a minimization problem as

N∑
i=1
μidi (24)
s.t.
N∑
i=1
gi

N∑

It is not difficult to see that the above objective function
now becomes convex, and minimization of convex function is
a convex optimization problem. The optimal solution is given
by the following proposition.
Proposition 1: The optimal solution to Problem 2b is
given by

Proof: Refer to Appendix B.
The optimal solution of Problem 2b can be related to the
original problem, i.e., Problem 2, in the following proposition.
Proposition 2: The bandwidth prices given by (26) are the
optimal solutions of Problem 2 if and only if the following
condition holds:

With the above results obtained from a number of subprob-

solution of Problem 2 is given by the following theorem.

the UAV operators and provides feedback to the MNO.

UAV operators while the UAV operators transfer the

from the game and the bandwidth price for these operators
will be set to ∞. If Q > YN , the optimal bandwidth price for
each UAV operator is already obtained by Proposition 2. For
the other intervals of Q, e.g., YN−1 < Q ≤ YN , the proof of the
optimality for the corresponding μ∗ can be obtained similarly
as Proposition 2, and is thus omitted. The proof of Theorem 2
thus follows.
Now, the Stackelberg game for the nonuniform pricing
scheme is completely solved. With the optimal solutions
obtained in Theorems 1 and 2, the SE for the proposed
Stackelberg game is given as follows.
Theorem 3: The SE for the Stackelberg game formulated in
Problems 1 and 2 is (μ∗, b∗), where μ∗ is given by (28), and
b∗ is given by (17).
In practice, the unique SE can be achieved in a centralized
manner as in [45]. However, it is observed from Theorem 2
that, to obtain the optimal spectrum price vector μ∗, the MNO
has to collect and measure the network state information to
compute and compare
√
gi/di for each individual UAV oper-
ator i. This will lead to high computation complexity and
communication overhead for the MNO and the UAV oper-
ators. Fortunately, owning to the distributed ledger benefit
of blockchain, such information can be safely collected and
processed by the edge computing nodes and then shared in
the whole network. Moreover, based on the special struc-
ture of (28), to further relieve the burden, we propose an
optimal nonuniform pricing scheme for the MNO and the
corresponding spectrum purchasing scheme for each UAV
operator by Algorithm 2. Through leveraging the blockchain
and exploiting miners acting as local coordinators and trusted
computation center, an efficient implementation solution can
be available.
C. Uniform Pricing Scheme
In this section, the uniform pricing scheme is considered,
in which the MNO charges all the UAV operators the same
unit price for their bandwidth requests, i.e., μi = μ, ∀i. With
a uniform price μ, the optimal bandwidth request for UAV
operators can be easily obtained from (17) by replacing μi
with μ, which is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 4: For a given uniform bandwidth price μ, the
optimal bandwidth request solution for UAV operators is
given by
b∗
i =
{ gi
μ ln 2 − di, if μ <
gi
di ln 2
0, if μ ≥ gi
di ln 2 .
(29)
Then, at the MNO’s side, similar to Problem 2, the optimal
pricing problem can be expressed as
Problem 3: max
μ>0

i=1
( gi
ln 2
− μdi
)+
(30)
s.t.
N∑
i=1
(

μ ln 2
− di
)
≤ Q. (31)
It is observed that Problem 3 has similar formation as
Problem 2, and its solution can be found in the same way.
Details are thus omitted here for brevity.
Algorithm 3 Distributed Spectrum Price Bargaining
Algorithm
• Step 1: The MNO sets the initial spectrum price μ, and
sends the μ to a nearby miner in the blockchain network.
The miner records the information and broadcasts the
price to all the UAV operators.
• Step 2: Each UAV operator computes its optimal band-
width request b∗
i based on (29) for the given μ, and gives
responses back to the miner.
• Step 3: The miner records the feedback from the
UAV operators and measures the total bandwidth requests∑
i∈N bi, and then transmits the related data to the MNO.
The MNO compares the total demand with its available
spectrum Q. Assume that τ is a small positive constant
that controls the algorithm accuracy, and �μ > 0 is a
small step size.
if
∑
i∈N bi > Q + τ then
The MNO increases the price by �μ;
else if
∑
i∈N bi < Q − τ then
The MNO decreases the price by �μ;
end if
After that, the MNO sends the new spectrum price to
the miner. Then, the miner updates the price and broad-
casts it to UAV operators. The corresponding transactions
are recorded and verified in the spectrum blockchain to
guarantee the security.
• Step 4: Step 2 and Step 3 are repeated until∣∣∑
i∈N bi − Q
∣∣ ≤ τ .
Theorem 5: Assuming that all the UAV operators are sorted
in the order (g1/d1) > (g2/d2) · · · (gN−1/dN−1) > (gN/dN),
the optimal solution for Problem 3 is given by
μ∗ =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
μ̃N, if Q > ỸN
μ̃N−1, if ỸN ≥ Q > ỸN−1
...
...
μ̃1, if Ỹ2 ≥ Q > Ỹ1
(32)
where μ̃K = (
∑K
i=1 gi/(Q +∑K
i=1 di) ln 2) and ỸK =
([dK
∑K
i=1 gi]/gK) −∑K
i=1 di, ∀K ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}.
From Theorem 5, it is not difficult to observe that when the
total available bandwidth margin Q is given, the optimal price
strategy is unique. Thus, the SE for this Stackelberg game is
also unique and given as follows.
Theorem 6: The SE for the Stackelberg game formulated
with the uniform pricing scheme is (μ∗, b∗), where μ∗ is given
by (32), and b∗ is given by (29).
For the uniform pricing scheme, to obtain the SE of
the proposed Stackelberg game, some insights about the
optimization problem are introduced at first. It can be observed
from Problem 3 that both the objective function and the left
hand side of the constraint condition (31) are monotonically
decreasing functions of μ. Thus, when the constraint condi-
tion is satisfied with equality, the objective function can be
maximized. Based on this fact, a distributed spectrum price
bargaining algorithm is proposed in Algorithm 3 to implement
the proposed game.

It can be seen that Algorithm 3 is a distributed algorithm
which greatly reduces the amount of information that needs to
be exchanged in the network, as compared to the centralized
approach. The convergence of the spectrum price bargaining
algorithm is guaranteed by the following facts: 1) the optimal
spectrum price is always obtained when the total idle band-
width of the MNO is fully allocated; 2) the left hand side
of (31) is a decreasing function of μ; and 3) the SE for the
proposed Stackelberg game is unique for a given Q.
V. SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, a security assessment of our proposed spec-
trum blockchain is first given. After that, several numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the performances of the
spectrum trading strategies based on the approach of spectrum
pricing.
A. Security Assessment
Unlike traditional communication security and privacy pro-
tection, our proposed method can ensure spectrum trading
security by leveraging consortium blockchain technology
which can provide a defensive ability against many potential
security attacks. More details about the security assessment
for the spectrum blockchain are listed as follows.
1) Without Reliance on a Trusted Intermediary: In our
spectrum blockchain, operators trade spectrum in a dis-
tributed manner, unlike conventional trading schemes
that have to rely on a globally trusted center. This can
efficiently solve the security threats caused by the cen-
tralized mechanisms, such as single point of failure,
privacy leakage, and denial of service attacks.
2) Privacy Protection: This feature is guaranteed by the
fact that the trading information is sent in the encrypted
format among the operators and the edge computing
nodes. Without knowledge of the secret key of the
sender, it is impossible to derive the original private
message from the operators.
3) Wallet Security: As each operator has a unique wal-
let corresponding to its spectrum coin account, without
authorized keys and certificates, no adversary can open
an operator’s wallet, stealing or distorting spectrum
coins from the wallet.
4) Prevention of Replay Attack: Each transaction is digitally
signed with a unique identifier. Therefore, transactions
with the same identifier will be rejected by the consen-
sus servers (i.e., preselected edge computing nodes), and
thus replay attacks are prevented.
5) Transaction Authentication: All transactions recorded in
the blockchain have been publicly audited and authen-
ticated by high-reputation authorized edge computing
nodes. Moreover, each block has a unique and fixed hash
value, which can be used to protect the order and the
information of blocks. Since modifying any contents of
any block will cause a change to the hash values of the
other blocks, it is impossible for an adversary to tamper
or forge a transaction due to overwhelming cost.
Fig. 3. Revenue of the MNO versus Q.
6) Traceability: When a dispute happens in the spectrum
blockchain network, the TA will check one public ledger
to find out the corresponding real identity of the illegal
or misbehaved operator from the anonymous certificate
Cert and registered ID, and revoke its public key. Thus,
the traceability can be guaranteed.
B. Numerical Results
In this section, the simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the performances of the proposed pricing-based
spectrum trading scheme. An air-ground spectrum sharing for
UAV-assisted cellular network with one MNO and three UAV
operators is considered. In order to illustrate the impact of
spectrum coins and spectrum demands of UAV operators on
the system performance, two different cases are investigated.
In the first case (i.e., the first three examples), it is assumed
that the spectrum coins of all the UAV operators are the same
while their basic spectrum demands for serving users (i.e.,
application types) are different. Without loss of generality, the
spectrum coins of all the UAV operators are assumed to be
the same with g1 = g2 = g3 = 1. The bandwidth demands
of these UAV operators at the current time are different with
[d1, d2, d3] = [5, 10, 15] units.2 In the second case (i.e., the
last example), the UAV operators have the same spectrum
demands with different spectrum coins.
Example 1 (Uniform Pricing Versus Nonuniform Pricing):
In this example, the performance comparison between the
two schemes of uniform pricing and nonuniform pricing is
examined. Figs. 3 and 4 show the MNO revenue and the
sum-revenue of UAV operators, respectively, versus the total
available bandwidth Q at the MNO, with uniform or nonuni-
form pricing. It is observed that for the same Q, the revenue of
the MNO under the nonuniform pricing scheme is in general
larger than that under the uniform pricing scheme, while the
reverse is generally true for the sum-revenue of UAV oper-
ators. These observations indicate that, from the perspective
of revenue maximization for the MNO, the nonuniform pric-
ing is preferable compared to uniform pricing. On the other

there is no specific unit for the bandwidth, which can be a general parameter.

hand, the uniform pricing scheme is indeed optimal for the
sum-revenue maximization of the UAV operators.
In addition, it is worth noting that when Q is sufficiently
small, the revenues of the MNO become equal for the two
pricing schemes, so are the sum-revenue of UAV operators.
This is because when Q is very small, there is only one UAV
operator active in the network, and thus by comparing (28)
and (32), the nonuniform pricing scheme is the same as the
uniform pricing counterpart in the single-UAV operator case.
Besides, it is expected that when Q is sufficiently large, the
revenues of the MNO converge to the same value for the two
pricing schemes. This can be explained as follows. For the
nonuniform pricing scheme, it is observed from (28) that arbi-
trary spectrum price μi becomes very small with very large
Q, and thus the objective function of Problem 2 converges to∑N
i=1 (gi/ln 2) as Q → ∞. On the other hand, for the uniform
pricing scheme, when Q approaches infinity, the revenue of the
MNO will also converge to
∑N
i=1 (gi/ln 2). Thus, there exists
a same upper bound for the two different pricing schemes.
Example 2 (Comparison of Bandwidth Prices for UAV
Operators Under Nonuniform Pricing): In this example, we
examine the optimal bandwidth prices for the UAV opera-
tors with the variation of Q under nonuniform pricing. First,
it is observed from Fig. 5 that, for the same Q, the band-
width price for UAV operator 1 is the highest, while that for
UAV operator 3 is the lowest. This is true due to the fact that
(g1/d1) > (g2/d2) > (g3/d3), where a larger (gi/di) indicates
that the corresponding UAV operator can achieve a higher
profit with the same amount bandwidth allocated. Therefore,
the operator with a larger (gi/di) has a willingness to pay a
higher price to buy the spectrum. Second, it is observed that
the differences between the bandwidth prices decrease with
the increasing of Q. The reason is that when Q increases,
it can be seen from (28) that [(
∑N
i=1
√
gidi)/(Q +∑N
i=1 di)]
decreases. Last, it is observed that the prices for all UAV oper-
ators decrease with the increasing of Q, which can be easily
inferred from (28). Intuitively, this can be explained by the
practical rule of thumb that if a seller has a large amount
of goods to sell, it would like to price lower to stimulate
consumption.

algorithm.
Example 3 (Convergence Performance of Distributed
Bandwidth Price Bargaining Algorithm): In this example,
the convergence performance of the distributed bandwidth
price bargaining algorithm (i.e., Algorithm 3) is investigated.
Actually, the distributed bargaining algorithm can be imple-
mented through the bisection method, for which the implemen-
tation procedure is given as follows. First, the MNO initializes
a lower bound μL and an upper bound μH of the bandwidth
price. Then, the MNO computes μM = (μH +μL)/2 and sends
the μM to a nearby miner (i.e., authorized edge computing
node) through the blockchain network. The miner records the
information and broadcasts it to all the UAV operators. After
receiving μM , UAV operators compute their optimal band-
width requests and give responses back to the miner. The miner
measures the total bandwidth requests
∑
i∈N bi and transmits
the feedback information to the MNO. If
∑N
i=1 bi < Q, the
MNO sets μH = μM; otherwise, the MNO sets μL = μM .
Then, μM is recomputed based on the new lower and upper
bounds. The algorithm stops when |∑N
i=1 bi − Q| is within the
desired accuracy. It is observed from Fig. 6 that the distributed
bargaining algorithm can converge within nine iterations for
all values of Q.

Fig. 7. Bandwidth allocation versus Q.
Example 4 (Relationship Between Bandwidth Allocation
and Available Idle Spectrum): In this example, the spectrum
demands of all the UAV operators are assumed to be the same
with d1 = d2 = d3 = 5 units while the spectrum coins are
different with [g1, g2, g3] = [3, 2, 1]. The bandwidth assign-
ments for the three UAV operators with variation of Q are
shown in Fig. 7. It is observed from Fig. 7 that the UAV
operators with more spectrum coins have a higher priority
in bandwidth obtainment. When the available bandwidth Q
is small, the MNO will reject the request from the operators
with low spectrum coins, and provide the limited resource to
the operators with high spectrum coins. When the available
bandwidth Q is large, the MNO will try to meet every oper-
ator’s request. However, operators with more spectrum coins
are given a higher priority in obtaining the bandwidth. It is
also observed that with the increasing of Q, the bandwidth
assigned for each operators increases. This is due to the fact
that the MNO’s utility is maximized only when it leases all
its available idle spectrum to the UAV operators.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, a consortium blockchain enabled secure spec-
trum trading framework is exploited for UAV-assisted cellular
networks, where MNO and UAV operators are able to trade
spectrum in a credible environment without relying on a
trusted third party. Under this framework, a Stackelberg game
model is adopted to jointly study the utility optimization for
the MNO and UAV operators. Nonuniform spectrum pric-
ing and uniform spectrum pricing schemes are discussed.
Additionally, a nonuniform pricing algorithm with low com-
plexity and a distributed uniform pricing bargaining algorithm
are, respectively, designed to obtain the optimal solutions
under the two pricing schemes. A security assessment shows
that our proposed spectrum blockchain improves transaction
security and privacy protection. Numerical results illustrate
that the pricing-based incentive mechanisms are effective and
efficient for spectrum trading. In future work, it is interesting
to extend the utilization of blockchain for broader applica-
tions in UAV-assisted cellular networks, while taking into
account more UAV features, such as deployment optimization,
trajectory planning, and energy constraint.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
Since Problem 1 is a convex optimization problem, the dual-
ity gap between this problem and its dual optimization problem
is zero. Thus, we can deal with Problem 1 by solving its dual
problem.
The Lagrangian of Problem 1 can be written as
L(bi, α) = gilog2
(
1 + bi
di
)
− μibi + αbi (33)
where α is nonnegative dual variable associated with the
constraint bi ≥ 0.
The dual function is then defined as h(α) =
maxbi≥0L(bi, α), and the dual problem is given by
minα≥0h(α). Then, the KKT conditions can be written
as follows:
∂L(bi, α)
∂bi
= gi
(bi + di) ln 2
− μi + α = 0, ∀i (34)
α ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0, ∀i (35)
αbi = 0. (36)
From (34), it follows:
bi = gi
(μi − α) ln 2
− di. (37)
Suppose bi > 0 when μi ≥ [gi/(di ln 2)]. Then from (36),
it follows that α = 0. Therefore, (37) reduces to bi =
[gi/(μi ln 2)] − di. Then bi > 0 results in μi < [gi/(di ln 2)].
This contradicts the presumption. Therefore, from (35), it
follows:
bi = 0, if μi ≥ gi
di ln 2
. (38)
Suppose bi = 0 when μi < [gi/(di ln 2)]. Then, from (37),
it follows μi = [gi/(di ln 2)] + α. Since α ≥ 0, it follows
μi ≥ [gi/(di ln 2)]. This contradicts the presumption. Thus,
bi �= 0 for this set of μi. Then, from (36), it follows α = 0.
Therefore, from (37), it follows:
bi =
(
gi
μi ln 2
− di
)
, if μi <
gi
di ln 2
. (39)
Theorem 1 is thus proved.

width price and amount of total available spectrum constraints,

where η and γi are the nonnegative dual variables associated
with the constraints
∑N
i=1 [gi/(μi ln 2)] ≤ Q + ∑N
i=1 di and
μi ≥ 0, respectively.
The dual optimization problem is expressed as the
maximization of the Lagrangian
V(μ, η, γ ) = max
μ�0
L(μ, η, γ ). (41)
The dual problem is then given by minη≥0,γ�0V(μ, η, γ ).
The duality gap is zero for the convex problem addressed here,
and thus solving its dual problem is equivalent to solving the
original problem. Thus, the optimal solution needs to satisfy
the following KKT conditions:
∂L(μ, η, γ )
∂μi

N∑

N∑
i=1
di ≤ 0. (46)
From (42), we can derive
μi
2 = ηgi
(di − γi) ln 2
,∀i. (47)
To further analyze the dual problem, we first provide the
following two lemmas.
Lemma 1: γi = 0,∀i.
Proof: Suppose that γi �= 0 for any arbitrary i. Then,
from (44), we can derive that μi = 0. Then, since gi > 0,
from (47), it follows that η = 0. Substituting η = 0 into (47),
we have μi = 0, ∀i. However, this result contradicts the con-
dition in (46). Thus, the assumption that γi �= 0 for any given
i does not hold, and we thus have γi = 0, ∀i.
Lemma 2:
∑N
i=1 [gi/(μi ln 2)] − Q −∑N
i=1 di = 0.
Proof: Suppose that
∑N
i=1 [gi/(μi ln 2)] − Q −∑N
i=1 di �=
0. Then, from (43), it follows that η = 0. Substituting
η = 0 into (47), we have μi = 0,∀i, which
contradicts the condition in (46). Therefore, the afore-
mentioned assumption does not hold, and we thus have∑N
i=1 [gi/(μi ln 2)] − Q −∑N
i=1 di = 0.
From Lemma 1, we have γi = 0 for arbitrary i. Since
μi ≥ 0, thus from (47), it follows μi = √
[ηgi/(di ln 2)], ∀i.
According to Lemma 2, it follows that Q + ∑N
i=1 di =∑N
i=1 [gi/(μi ln 2)]. Substituting μi = √
[ηgi/(di ln 2)] into it,
we can derive
√
η =
∑N

Then, it follows:
μi = 1

Thus, Proposition 1 is proved.
APPENDIX C
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2
This proof consists of two parts: 1) the necessity proof and
2) the sufficiency proof, which are given as follows.
Part I (Sufficiency): The optimal solution to Problem 2b is
given by (26) with the assumption that all the indicator func-
tions are equal to 1, i.e., μi < [gi/(di ln 2)], ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}.
Submitting (26) into these inequalities yields

Q +∑N

Then, (50) can be rewritten as Q >
[(
∑N
i=1
√
gidi)/(
√
gi/di)] − ∑N
i=1 di, ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}.
Furthermore, the inequalities given above can be compactly
written as
Q >
∑N
i=1
√
gidi

√
gi

N∑
i=1
di. (51)
Thus, the sufficiency of the condition in (27) is proved.
Part II (Necessity): This part can be proved by contradiction.
For the ease of exposition, we assume that UAV operators are
sorted by the following order: (g1/d1) > · · · (gN−1/[dN−1]) >
(gN/dN). Then, in Proposition 2, the condition becomes Q >
YN , where
YN =
∑N
i=1
√

N∑
i=1
di. (52)
Now, suppose YN−1 < Q ≤ YN , where YN−1 is shown
later in (56). Suppose that μ∗ given by (26) is still optimal
for Problem 2 with YN−1 < Q < YN . Then, since Q ≤
YN , from (26) we have μ∗
N ≥ (gN/[dN ln 2]) and thus
((gN/[μ∗
N]) − dN)+ = 0. From Problem 2, it then follows
that μ∗

It is easy to observe that the above problem has the same
structure as Problem 2. Therefore, according to Proposition 1
and the proof of previous Part I, the optimal solution for this
problem can be given by

as the threshold for Q above which μ∗

{1, 2, . . . , N − 1} holds, i.e.,

Comparing the optimal bandwidth price solution shown
in (55) with that given in (26), we can find that they are dif-
ferent from each other, which contradicts with our assumption
that μ∗ is still the optimal solution for Problem 2 with the
condition YN−1 < Q ≤ YN . Thus, we can conclude that only
if the condition Q > YN satisfies, the bandwidth prices given
by (26) are the optimal solutions for Problem 2.
Combining the results obtained in Part I and Part II, it
is concluded that the bandwidth prices given by (26) are
the optimal solutions of Problem 2 if and only if Q >

is proved.
