ABSTRACT People trade thousands of non-fungible tokens (NFT) daily. The NFT prices are expressed
in cryptocurrency, and it is volatile. As the interest in the NFTs changes, their prices vary with time too.
Is there an immanent meter to order NFTs by their value? Within a single collection, a vector of features–
traits–characterizes NFT. People construct rarity meters based on the assumed value of the trait vector rarity.
But this process lacks formalism. In this paper, we formulate the optimal rarity meter problem and provide
a pipeline for optimal rarity meter design. A proposed tournament score function is an essential part of the
construction. We demonstrate the approach for the Kanaria NFT collection.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain allows the management of digital tokens in peer-
to-peer networks [1], [2]. Tokens can be fungible like tradi-
tional currency or non-fungible (NFT) [3]. NFT represents
a unique identifier and is usually associated with a digital
object, for example, a picture. Apart from stand-alone NFTs,
there exist collections within a single smart contract [4].
As of the 2022, thousands of NFT collections are traded
daily in OpenSea, Solanart, Singular in Ethereum, Solana,
Kusama, and other blockchains [5], [6]. A set of traits char-
acterizes the NFT within a single collection and defines its
unique properties–for example, the associated picture. While
all NFTs are unique, they have different trade values, at least
because of identifiers. Generally, some NFTs are rarer than
others, and people value the rarity [7]. But how to measure
the rarity of an NFT?
Many rarity services are represented on the Internet, but we
know only one–Rarity.tools–that disclose their approach [8].
While the formula is reasonable and is a good baseline, it does
not always meet our common sense and thus can be modified.
Moreover, the rarity meter design problem lacks a formal
statement and is discussable.
The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and
approving it for publication was Dongxiao Yu .
We were challenged with the problem and proposed a
winning solution to the RMRK Hackathon [9], followed by
the paper with the corresponding web-application descrip-
tion [10]. The current research aims to introduce our pipeline
for the NFT rarity estimation. The rest of the paper is orga-
nized as follows. Section II considers the related work and
the contribution of the current paper. We formulate the opti-
mal rarity meter problem in Section III. The score function
is a part of the rarity meter design with a state-of-the-art
Rarity.tools formula as an example. We construct artificial
collection examples, where the existing score function pro-
vides controversial results and propose our heuristic for score
functions in Section IV. The numerical example for Kanaria
NFT collection is presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
People collecting coins pay value not only for utility but also
for rarity [11]. Products and brands use rarity to satisfy the
need for uniqueness in the customers’ mind, thus get more
income [12].While empirical evidence supports higher prices
for rare goods, isolating the value of rarity is challenging.
Kenneth Koforda and Adrian E. Tschoegl consider an
impact of rarity in the form of original mintage on the coins
price among collectors [13]. They analyze 95 mintages data
for coins of two types–Morgan Dollar and the Liberty Head

Eagle from 1878 to 1921. The coins they use differ only in
terms of the date and mint mark that appears on each coin.
The consideration of multiple mintages of each type elimi-
nates the design and beauty factors. A linear model with the
logarithms of coin age and mintage as features demonstrated
a good fit [14] to the trade data for 1988 and 1993, and the
rarity more strongly influences the market price than the age.
Jonathan E. Hughes considered an impact of rarity based
on ‘‘Magic: the Gathering’’ (MTG) collectible card game.
MTG has a primarymarket byWizards of the Coast company,
where one can buy a set of cards called booster, followed by a
secondary market. Players can build a card deck and play the
game. Each card has attributes that make it useful in game
play, i.e. cards have utility. But, beyond the in-game utility,
cards have different circulation and ‘‘rarity’’ indicator from
common to mythic rare. Moreover, some cards are reprinted
with a different rarity indicator. The author has collected price
data for the secondary market from TCGplayer, an online
marketplace for the collectible gaming market used by over
2, 500 local gaming store for a six-week period in March-
April 2019 and cards from sixteen recent releases. The linear
model based on card in-game attributes, card rarity indicator
and odds to obtain the card demonstrates a moderate but
statistically significant fit to the trade data. Rarity indicator
by publishers influences the price, and the odds to obtain the
card are important price factor for a small odds region.
NFT market growth [15] challenges enthusiasts to design
a rarity meter for token collections. Compared to the coins
and MTG cards, NFT collections have structured sets of
traits.Rarity.tools [8] provides a rarity meter, which, de facto,
is an industrial standard now. The formula is a summation
of an inverse frequencies of trait values 3. Alternative ser-
vices [16]–Rarity Sniper, NFT Stats and Fresh Drops to
name a few–use the same approach for the rarity meters.
NFTs in some collections can have utility like breeding,
access to DAO or club [17], traits are dependent and have
a different impact on the beauty of the associated picture.
Nadini et al. demonstrate visual features to be good predic-
tors for price [18], but do not go into the trait structure
behind the features. The existing rarity approach does not
allow to adjust the meter to the specific collection, thus can be
improved. Moreover, the industry lacks a performance metric
to compare rarity meters.
While the rarity meter by Rarity.tools is controversial,
Mekacher et al. show that, on average and among other,
rarer NFTs sell for higher prices. The analysis includes a
dataset of 3.7M transactions collected between January 2018
and June 2022, involving 1.4M NFTs distributed across 410
collections. Their generalizations use the Spearman rank
correlation coefficient, i.e., it does not catch the change
of the interest in the collection over time, which may
affect the results especially for expensive NFTs with a few
sells.
The main contributions of our work to the rarity meter
design problem are
1) Introduce the performance metric for rarity meters
based on pair-wise weighted correlation between deals.
2) Provide a solution pipeline, where the optimal rar-
ity meter is a combination of expert-driven score
functions.
3) Construct artificial collection examples, where the
state-of-the-art score function provides controversial
results.
4) Propose tournament-based modification to the state-of-
the-art score function.
5) Demonstrate the approach with an Kanaria NFT
collection.
III. OPTIMAL RARITY METER PROBLEM
Consider a single NFT collection. Let the collection consists
of N tokens. Some collections allow minting new tokens.
We consider them at a fixed moment and design the rarity
meter for a given blockchain snapshot. So the number of
tokens N is the number of tokens minted in the given snap-
shot, and it is fixed. Let
XN = {X1, . . . ,XN }
be tokens in the collection. Let each token Xn has T traits:
Xn = (xn1, . . . , xnT ).
The values of the traits are categorical variables–have no
order. The traits are ‘‘gens’’ of theNFT, and their combination
defines the ‘‘phenotype’’ of the token, for example, object
shape or background color.
We say that an arbitrary function
R : XN → [0,∞)
is a rarity meter. One expects the bigger the value of R(Xn)
the rarer is the NFT Xn ∈ XN .
Different people may have different views on the rarity.
So how can one compare two rarity meters and find the one
which better meets expectations–the optimal rarity meter?
The only answer we have is ‘‘the market knows.’’ Users trade
NFTs, and one expects to see a greater rarity meter for a more
expensive NFT. LetD deals be in a blockchain snapshot. Each
deal d = 1, . . . ,D characterizes with the deal moment td ,
the sold NFT index id of and the deal price pd . The price is
expressed in cryptocurrency, and it is volatile. The interest
in the collection changes over time as well. Thus, the NFTs’
prices change with time too.We want such a final rarity meter
that if two deals for different NFTs are close in time, the
rarity meter value of the more expensive NFT is greater. The
consideration of deals pairs (d1, d2) with weights k(td1 , td2 )
is a possible formalization, where weights decrease with time
between deals |td1 − td2 | increase. Let a function
ϕ : [0,∞) × [0,∞) → R
compare rarities of two NFTs, where
ϕ(R1,R2) → +∞ with R1 → ∞,
ϕ(R1,R2) → +∞ with R2 → 0,

and ϕ is a skew-symmetric function:
ϕ(R2,R1) = −ϕ(R1,R2).
Let a function
ψ : (0,∞) × (0,∞) → R
compare prices of the deals of two NFTs, where
ψ(p1, p2) → +∞ with p1 → ∞,
ψ(p1, p2) → +∞ with p2 → 0,
and ψ is a skew-symmetric function:
ψ(p2, p1) = −ψ(p1, p2).
Let j = 1, . . . , J be the index for all deal pairs (d1j , d2j ),
where
J =
D(D− 1)

d1j , d2j ≤ D,
d1j < d2j .
Denote ϕ⃗, ψ⃗, k⃗ ∈ RJ×1 vectors of all relative rarities,
prices and weights, i.e.
ϕ⃗ = ϕ⃗(R) =
(
ϕ(R(Xd11 ),R(Xd21 )), . . . ,
ϕ(R(Xd1J ),R(Xd2J ))
)T

)T
k⃗ =
(
k(td11 , td21 ), . . . , k(td1J , td2J )
)T
.
Let F(ϕ⃗, ψ⃗; k⃗) be a similarity function of vectors ϕ⃗ and ψ⃗
with given weights k⃗ . We propose the optimal rarity meter
problem as follows
F(ϕ⃗(R), ψ⃗; k⃗) → max
R∈R

whereR is a search space of rarity meters.
Denote 1⃗J ∈ R the J -dimensional vector with all ones. Let

a⃗k⃗ =

and a vector ˙⃗ak⃗ be the centered vector a⃗ with weights k⃗
˙⃗ak⃗ = a⃗− a⃗k⃗ .

• ψ(p1, p2) = ln

)
as a relative price,
• F(ϕ⃗, ψ⃗; k⃗) = corr(ϕ⃗, ψ⃗; k⃗) as a weighted similarity of
vectors, where corr is the weighted correlation func-
tion [20]. I.e., let K = k⃗ 1⃗TK ∈ RK×K be a diagonal

People already have their expectations of rarity. One can
formulate preferences in partially ordered sets (posets) [21],
where the greater element is rarer than, the smaller one. For
example, Xi > Xj if xid has less entries in {x1d , . . . , xNd } than
xjd . We equip each poset with a score function
s : XN → R,
where
(Xi > Xj) ⇒ (s(Xi) > s(Xj)).
For example,
sf (Xi) =
N
#{k|xkd = xid , k = 1, . . . ,N }
, (3)
where #A is the cardinality of the set A and the subscript f
stands for frequency. A score function is a rarity meter but
also expert-based and interpretable [22], [23]. We want an
optimal interpretable rarity meter, so we take score functions
as building blocks and define R as all the combinations of
the chosen score functions with non-negative weights, i.e.,
a positive hull. GivenM score functions s1, . . . , sM , the rarity
meter search space equals
R = {R|R =
M∑
m=1
αmsm, where αm ∈ [0,∞)}. (4)
IV. TOURNAMENT SCORE FUNCTION
Score functions define a rarity meter search space (4). A score
function is the rarity meter, i.e., a mapping from NFT
collection XN to non-negative real numbers [0,∞). The
expert-based and interpretability requirements are subjective.
This section introduces the heuristic approach to the score
functions.
A. UNIQUE VS RARE
Thinking about different collections, we noticed several
things. Imagine a collection of 1 red ball and 999 gray balls.
We think everyone will agree that this red ball is unique and
very rare. But imagine a collection with 500 gray balls and
500 balls of different and non-repetitive colors. Look–any
of these balls are unique–but to be honest, it is not what we
would like. We feel these non-grays like ‘‘just 500 colored
balls.’’
So we must not only think about ball color like a member
of a group (like ‘‘there are only 20 such colors, this color is
VOLUME 11, 2023 4285

TABLE 2. Standings for 50 grey and 50 ‘‘just colored’’ elements.
the same in the group of 20 same colored balls’’), but also
we must think about what groups are in our collection. For
example 500 groups of 1 color and 1 group of 500 gray color.
Rarity.Tools formula [8] suggests to count only an amount
in the group: you get TOTAL NFTs
group size point for every trait and
sum of the points is your Rarity result. The sense of the very
similar formula could be: ‘‘Ok, this color is a part of the
group of n same colors.’’ Let us count the different colored
balls and divide the group members’ results. Formula is
TOTAL NFTs - n
n (and this is almost the same with the Rarity
tools formula, difference is −1).
But this formula seems not good enough. Imagine an NFT
with 2 traits. The first is color, and the second is shape. There
are 5000 unique different colored and 5000 gray NFTs. 5000
‘‘just colored’’ NFTs are all round, 4999 gray are triangles,
and the last one-gray ball–is squared. If we count with the
Rarity.tools formula, every ‘‘just colored’’ ball will have the
same rarity score as a squared (and truly unique) gray ball.
If there are 500 groups of 20 same colored balls, we will
not treat this as a big achievement. So it is important to
differentiate between Uniqueness, Rarity, and Uniqueness
Rarity. Uniqueness has no big value if it is not Rare. So we
need the Rarity meter, which counts the rareness of this exact
‘‘color’’ and a collection structure.
B. SCORE FUNCTION DESIGN
Let us construct an alternative score function to the reverse
frequency from Section IV-A. Let the values of a trait be not
comparable by themselves, i.e., and golden eyes are not better
than brown eyes just because of color. We will compare only
groups of the trait. If there are 50 golden eyes and 20 brown
eyes, and 20 gray eyes, we will compare only 3 different
groups of 50, 20, and 20 of this trait.
So, first of all, we split every NFT by traits and counted
the score for each trait. After that, we take an average for all
traits.
For every trait we write out all group sizes N1, . . . ,NG,
where G is the number of groups and
∑G
g=1 Ng = N . For
TABLE 3. Standings for 4 groups of 20 and 2 groups of 10.
TABLE 4. Standings for 5 groups of 1 and 1 group of 95.
example, for the collection with 1 golden, 20 blue, 21 green,
43 yellow, 1 gray and 14 white we write
(N1,N2,N3,N4,N5,N6) = (1, 20, 21, 43, 1, 14).
The order does not matter. Then, we start a tournament
between these groups. One point is played out in every bat-
tle between groups with N1 and N2 elements correspond-
ingly, and each group’s points are inverse to the group
size.
• N1 wins N2/(N1 + N2) points
• N2 wins N1/(N1 + N2) points.
For Example, 14 vs 21: 14 is more rare and gets 21/35,
21 gets 14/35. The full standings are in Table 1. Note that the
average of the right column is always 0.5.
Good news
• If we have 1 golden, 2 red, and 9997 gray, the difference
in scores of 1 and 2 will not be too huge. For example,
we see that 20 and 21 are very close.
• We can count the average rareness of an NFT with
several traits.
• We are counting the percentage, not the score, depending
on the collection size. The percentage is much clear, and
you do not need to know additional information.

TABLE 5. Average standings for 50 gray and 50 ‘‘just colored’’ elements.
TABLE 6. Average standings for 4 groups of 20 and 2 groups of 10.
Bad news
• Sometimes results seem questionable. For example,
Tables 2, 3, 4.
So if we leave the results as is, we will get a worse score
for 5 Uniques (with 95 gray) vs. a group of 10 same-colored
in (10, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20) collection.
The finishing touch. As we mentioned before, the aver-
age of the right column is always 0.5. But the average
of all entities of the trait (trait_average) is differ-
ent. So if one trait is not more important than another,
we need to weigh all traits. The final average of each trait
should be the same–1. For every single instance we get
group_score/trait_average. Formally, let N (X ) be
the group size of X for a given trait. The tournament score

The term −

2 is to eliminate the tournament within the group.
See Tables 5, 6, 7.
Different entities of the trait have relatively the same score,
but also the average of different traits is the same and equal
to 1. Also, note that More Rare Uniqueness will have a better
score than Less Rare Uniqueness.
V. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
A. KANARIA COLLECTION
Kanaria NFT collection based on RMRK protocol and run-
ning on the Kusama blockchain–an experimental Polkadot
network [6], [24]. Each Kanaria NFT is associated with a
canary bird picture (see Figure 2-a). Traits define the bird’s
appearance (see Figure 2-b). And there is a meta trait called
TABLE 7. Average standings for 5 groups of 1 and 1 group of 95.
edition which affects the traits generator. Different traits may
have the same value, and the picture parts will have the same
style. Let us consider the collection structure leaving beyond
the scope of the paper the hatching mechanism, items, and
gems (see Figure 2-c).
1) EDITION
Kanaria birds hatched from the Kanaria Eggs which were
4 different Editions from the start: Super Founder (SF;
indexes 1, . . . , 9), Founder (F; indexes 10, . . . , 99), Rare
(R; indexes 100, . . . , 999), Limited Edition (LE; indexes
1000, . . . , 9999). Not all eggs were bought, and some of them
were not hatched, so we have only 8478 Kanaria birds alive.
Edition of the bird means to the rarity feeling, but Edition is
only a part of the valuation.
2) BIRD PARTS
Bird consists of 10 parts which can influence the Bird image
• Theme
• Head, Left Wing, Right Wing, Tail, Feet, Body
• Eyes, Beak
• Top (optional, overlay).
We grouped these parts intentionally into four groups.
First, it is important to understand the Theme and what
‘‘trait values’’ can be found in the birds. The Theme is an
important source of ‘‘color’’ for the parts without a ‘‘color.’’
There are two types of bird parts ‘‘color,’’ independent (like
a zombie, diamond, butterfly, etc.) and dependent (Plain,
Pinstrip, Speckled, Solid, Iridescent). Dependent ‘‘colors’’
don’t give the bird part a ‘‘color,’’ and they only conduct
the Theme’s ‘‘color’’ to the bird’s part. You can think about
these five ‘‘colors’’ as they are fluted glass pieces. These
dependents are var0, var1, . . . , and var4 in the code (we
suppose var stands for variation). We will call them Var
(Vars). For example, the bird #119 has the theme ‘‘Sakura,’’
and its Body, Right Wing, and Feet have inherited the Theme
with Var1 (Pinstrip) style (see Figure 2-b). Also, note that the
Theme is never a Var.
In code, Feet are represented as left foot and right foot.
They are always equal. Also, there are left hands and right
hands, but they are always equal to the left and right wings.

FIGURE 1. Full sets: (a) ‘‘Muninn’’ bird #436, (b) ‘‘Diomand’’ bird #3413 with ‘‘Jinn’’ Top, (c) bird #3413 with manually deleted Top.
FIGURE 2. Kanaria bird #119: (a) NFT picture, (b) traits, (c) NFT picture without items and gems.
The reason to have extra duplicated traits is to have slots to
equip items. Next, 6 parts (Head, Left wing, Right wing, Tail,
Feet, Body) were generated, taking a bit of probability from
the emojis which were added to the Kanaria Eggs during the
spring, June, and July 2021. If all of these 6 are not Vars and
they are equal, it is called Full Set, and there are only 105 of
them based on the code plus one special Full Set #3413 (see
Figure 1-a,b). The Top is a specific part: it overlays the tail
and feet in the Birds Image and overwrites the tail in the code
(see Figure 1-b,c).
Notable facts
• only 12 birds have genie top
• only 20 birds have mermaid top
• only bird #3413 has 5 equal parts (except tail) and genie
top. Kanaria team calls it Full Set and it seems that they
have overwritten its tail
• only 106 full set birds and only they have non-Var
bodies.
Eyes and Beak (shown as a Face for the user) are the same
in most birds, and only 866 birds have something meaningful
plus Var. Var is ignored in this case. Eyes and Beak did not
take any probability from the egg emojis, so it is a standalone
pair.
3) SETS
Set is the best combination of the same non-Vars from {Head,
Left Wing, Right Wing, Tail, Feet, and Body}. For example,
birds 1, 436, and 9997 are Full Sets, which means that 6 out
of 6 these parts are the same non-Vars. Here are the numbers
• 6 same non-Vars – 105
• 5 same non-Vars – 1
4288 VOLUME 11, 2023
M. Krasnoselskii et al.: KRAMER: Interpretable Rarity Meter for Crypto Collectibles
• 4 same non-Vars – 23
• 3 same non-Vars – 828
• 2 same non-Vars – 1650
• 1 non-Var – 4120
• all Vars – 1751.
Some sets are extended with Theme and/or Face. While
counting the rareness of the sets, we defined that a 6-set with
the same Theme is better than a 6-set with the same Face (due
to more rare appearance) and better than a not extended 6-set.
Of course, the bird with 3 zombies in a set with an additional
zombie in the Face looks muchmore valuable than a bird with
‘‘just three zombies,’’ but we count it worse than a bird with
the 4-set (and no extension).
Notable facts
• No bird has three or more different non-Var, i.e.,
Diamond wing, Volcano head, Tornado Tail
• There are no birds with all the same parts (including
Eyes, Beak, and Theme)
• As mentioned, the only 5-set bird is #3413. It has 5
diamonds and 1 Jinn.
• Only 2 sets are extended by the Theme (Theme is the
same as a bird set).
4) GEMS AND ITEMS
In KRAMER (Kanaria RArity MEteR) rarity meter, we do
not count Gems and Items for two reasons
1) Gems and Items could be removed from the bird. Gems
could be used for different cases, and Items can be
moved from the bird directly. We wanted to calculate
rarity only for the unchangeable parts of the bird.
2) Gems and Items and their evaluation is a matter of taste
and subjective assessment. For example, Njord/son
Gem is evaluated with a big expectation (it gives you a
part of RMRK profits), but no one knows what profits
Kokopelli can give you in the future (it gives you a
possibility to enter RMRK-related projects very early,
say seed round prices).
B. OPTIMAL RARITY METER
We calculated 3 scores for Traits, Sets and Edition (5). The
Trait Score (TS) is an average of 9 tournament scores for
9 parts (all except Top) fromSubsectionV-A2. The Sets Score
(SS) is a tournament score, where the group size is treated
as cumulative, with all groups with better sets. The Edition
Score (ES) is a tournament score (Section V-A1).
The search space (4) is considered a positive hull of TS,
SS, and ES. We split the deals dataset into the train (before
November 2021) and test (November 2021) parts. The opti-
mal rarity meter (1)–Kramer–is 0.75 ·TS+0 ·SS+0.25 ·ES.
Under the hood, TS, SS, and ES give a correlation of 0.56,
0.38, and 0.74 correspondingly for the train sample, while
Kramer gives 0.83 for the train and even more–0.88–for the
test sample.
Notable facts
• Normally the price of a bird is from 1 to 1600 Kusama.
But bird #7723 has been sold twice for 0.01 Kusama
at 8:46:42 and 8:49:00 UTC on September 6, 2021,
by developers. We consider these two events as an
RMRK team test and omit them.
• Note that the market does not appreciate the sets.
We suppose this happens because sets (or, in other
words, the concentration of some sort of gene) have no
functionality. In the future, when, for example, birds
could have offspring, the set will matter a lot, and we
could see that looking at the prices on the market.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
NFT rarity meters are accessible on the Web, but the area
was missing mathematical formalism. The proposed optimal
rarity meter problem (1) resolves the issue. The exact form
of the problem depends on the choice of similarity F , relative
rarity ϕ, relative price ψ , weight function k , and search space
R. We proposed a possible parameters setup, but one can
investigate alternatives and use his own.
We choose the search space R (4) as a positive hull of
score functions, where search functions are elementary inter-
pretable raritymeters, the hull allows us to interpret the result-
ing rarity meter as a weighted sum of elementary once, and
the hull is positive to allow voting for, but not against, each
NFT’s rarity. Section IVmotivates to elaborate more on score
functions design, and the proposed tournament design (5) is
a heuristic to open the discussion.
The proposed approach to the rarity is shown for the
Kanaria NFT collection. The optimized rarity meter gives
the performance equals to 0.88 out of 1, compared to the
0.56 for the default traits-based rarity meter. The web appli-
cation with the resulting meter is available in [10], and we
present detailed data mining and analysis process insights
in Section V. We use the Kanaria collection as a reference
example because it inspired us for the research during the
hackathon. We consider the analysis of other collections as
a direction for further study.
The similarity measure F (1) allows comparison of the
raritymeters available online if the values are available for the
same collection. As most meters do not reveal their approach,
one can provide a new one by reverse-engineering the best
available rarity meters if only it is legal.
The proposed rarity approach compares NFTs within a
single collection, while it is also interesting to compare dif-
ferent collections, for instance, to help collection designers
get wanted diversity.
