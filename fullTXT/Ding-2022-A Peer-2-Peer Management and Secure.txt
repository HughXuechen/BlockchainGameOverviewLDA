Abstract—A peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading (ET)
scheme has been presented in numerous scenarios within
the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), such as vehicle-to-
grid network, microgrids, and energy harvesting network.
These scenarios present security and privacy issues be-
cause of the lack of trust and transparency in the energy
markets. In this article, a secure ET system named energy
blockchain (EBC) is proposed in order to overcome the
security issues. An EBC is suitable for P2P ET situations
in which trusted intermediaries are not needed. Similarly, a
credit-based payment method to help eliminate ET delays
due to transaction confirmation delays on the EBC is pro-
posed. In addition, an optimal pricing method according to
the Stackelberg game has been suggested for credit-based
loans. According to a real dataset, security analysis and
numerical outcomes indicate that the suggested blockchain
and payment layout based on credit are both effective and
safe in IIoT.

1. INTRODUCTION
ACADEMIC and industrial researchers are increasingly
interested in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) that
is the key to transforming industrial systems in the coming years
[1]. IIoT enables industrial systems to be connected and intel-
ligent by sensors and actuators with ubiquitous computing and
networking [2]. In contrast, the increasing energy requirements
of IIoT applications present a great challenge to industrial sys-
tems, especially since the number and performance demands of
IIoT’ ties are soaring [3]. Peer-to-peer energy trading (P2P-ET)
between IIoT ties, such as electric vehicles (EVs), has been

proposed to meet this issue in prior research [4]. Ties of the
IIoT could exchange surplus energy with one another via P2P
trading to meet local energy demand, reduce transfer losses and
increase energy performance in order to achieve green industrial
systems.
The green industrial system has incorporated numerous ad-
vanced technologies, including wireless power transfer, vehicle-
to-grid (V2G), and energy harvesting network (EHN) [5]. These
technologies together enable industrial systems to expand ET
scenarios that are effective and sustainable [4]. P2P-ET scenarios
for IIoT can be divided into three categories as follows.
1) Microgrids (MGs): wind generators and solar panels on
smart buildings take advantage of ambient energy to
harvest and exchange energy amongst themselves on a
P2P basis.
2) Energy Harvesting Network: Industrial ties with EHN
capabilities are able to generate power from clean energy
sources, as well as can be charged via mobile chargers that
use wireless power transfer technology through P2P-ET.
3) V2G Network: The EV served as energy storage tools by
charging at load valleys and feeding the energy into the
electrical network at peaks to decrease the power grid
load. Local aggregators allow charging vehicles to sell
the power to neighbor ones in the P2P mode [6], [7].
Despite being a vital component of the IIoT, P2P-ET faces
privacy and security issues in general.
1) IIoT ties cannot conduct large-scale energy trading (ET)
in nontransparent and untrusted markets without security
concerns.
2) The privacy concerns of IIoT ties with surplus energy
might prevent them from participating as energy suppliers
[8]. There is an imbalance between energy supply and
demand among ties of the IIoT.
3) To ensure that IIoT ties’ transaction records are audited
and verified, there is an intermediary in P2P-ET. Among
the issues faced by this intermediary are privacy leakage
and single points of failure [9].
For this reason, a secure and unified system for ET needs to
be designed in IIoT [9]. Furthermore, IIoT devices with surplus
energy must be encouraged to act as sellers of energy through
the design of appropriate incentives.
Due to its benefits in decentralization, anonymity and trust,
blockchain (BC) technology is being investigated in ET in recent
years. Bitcoin is built on top of BC technology, a distributed and
open ledger which systematically has recorded transactions in
the secure and permanent method. Renewable ET in smart grids

has been made possible by the development of “NRGcoin” on
the basis of Bitcoin protocols. As a part of decentralized smart
grids, [9] used multisignature BCs to combat transaction security
issues. Nevertheless, these methods might not be effective for
P2P-ET between IIoT ties because establishing a general BC is
really costly.
Based on [7], consortium BC is a promising technology
for establishing decentralized ET systems with moderate costs.
Consortium BCs are special BCs which have authorized ties in
order to keep distributed shared databases. Using consortium
BC technology inspired by [7], the present article develops a
P2P-ET system with consortium BCs, called energy BC (EBC).
Several IIoT scenarios, such as V2G described in [7], can be
impacted by the EBC. Contrary to [7], here, a typical P2P-ET
scenario in IIoT is observed, rather than the price of electricity
trading. Next, a unified ET frame which includes aggregators,
energy purchasers, and sellers is presented. The EBC is based
on aggregators pre-selected for public auditing and sharing of
records under general ET scenarios without requiring trusted
intermediaries. In addition, the EBC has similar transaction
confirmation delays to those in Bitcoin, which results in slow
transactions and reduced performance [10]. As a solution to this
issue, a payment based on credit layout that supports frequent
and rapid ET has been suggested here. The ties of IIoT could
complete fast payments by using for loans from banks according
to their credit amounts. The optimum loan pricing scheme for
credit bank (CB) in IIoT has been suggested for the purpose of
maximizing CB utility.
The present article, compared to the existing researches, has
some major contributions as follows.
1) Unified EBC: A typical ET scenario is observed and
unified EBC with moderate costs is established for IIoT.
2) Credit-Based Payment: A credit-based payment layout
that supports frequent ET with fast payments is designed
in order to minimize the limitation transaction confirma-
tion delay.
3) Optimal Pricing Strategy: To enhance the CB’s utility,
we present the optimum pricing method applying Stack-
elberg games for loan according to the credit has been
suggested for the credit-based payment layout. Based on
outcomes, it is concluded that this suggested EBC and
payment system according to the credit are practical and
useful.
II. BC ACTIVATED ET FOR IIOT
A. United P2P-ET Scheme
Among IIoT ties, P2P-ET occurs ubiquitously with the aim of
balancing power demand and supply. The three generic P2P-ET
cases for ET are shown in Fig. 1, namely V2G network, MG, and
EHN. Typical ET scenarios should present a unified ET frame
and a secure ET BC for establishing an EBC [11]. In summary,
there are three entities of the unified ET framework.
1) Energy Ties: P2P-ET involves various roles from ties
of IIoT (such as EVs, smart buildings, and industrial
sensors): energy sellers and purchasers and unemployed
ties which do not trade energy. Ties choose their own roles
Fig. 1. Generic ET cases in IIoT.

according to their prevalent energy status and subsequent
plans.
2) Energy Aggregators (EAGs): The EAG manages occur-
rences based on trading and provides wireless communi-
cations for sensors of IIoT. Each EAG corresponds to a
different type of physical entity. The enhanced metering
infrastructure in MGs would be an EAG, for example.
It is possible to have an advanced based station with
computing and storage capabilities as an EAG in EHN.
Local aggregators can serve as EAGs in V2G systems.
An EAG consists of four entities is shown in Fig. 2: memory
pool (MP); account pool; CB; and transaction server. Transac-
tion servers collect energy demands from energy ties, and match
ET pairs among these ties. In order to trade energy in IIoT, a
digital cryptocurrency referred to as energy coin (EC) is used as
energy ties’ digital assets [7]. There is an EC account for every
energy tie with the aim of storing personal transaction records.
Personal ECs can be managed in a corresponding wallet on this
account. Energy ties use random pseudonyms for public keys of
their wallet, and they are called wallet addresses, replacing the
actual wallet address for privacy purposes.
In local account pools, each wallet and its corresponding
wallet address are mapped to each other as well as EC accounts.
Energy ties’ personal wallet addresses are recorded in the ac-
count pools of EAGs. Whole transaction records of local energy
ties are stored in MP.

Smart Meters: Smart meters built into IIoT ties track and
calculate traded energy in real time. Based on the records of
smart meters records, the energy purchaser pays the energy
seller.
B. Unified EBC for Secure P2P-ET
By exploiting consortium BC, an EBC can be established on
the basis of the unified P2P-ET frame to support secure P2P-
ET. The consensus process, known as a transaction inspection
stage, is the first step towards forming a BC from transactions
for traditional BCs. Whole ties in traditional BCs carry out
this process at high costs. EBCs, on the other hand, perform
consensus on preselected EAGs at moderate costs. The EAGs
maintain their local transaction records. Once the consensus
process between the EAGs is complete, the transaction records
have been structured into blocks and the MP stores them.
Details about the key operations supported by EAGs in the
EBC are as follows.
1) System Initialization: An effective Boneh–Boyen short
signature layout can be used to initialize systems in EBC. The
energy ties become legitimate entities after being registered
with the trusted authority like the government sector. An en-
ergy tie k with true identity IDk has joined the system and
achieved the certificate (Certk) and public and private keys
(PKk and SKk). With binding registration information, the cer-
tificate Certk represents a unique way of identifying an energy
tie. Tie k has received a set of ω wallet addresses {WIDk,l}ωl = 1
from the authority. The authority has generated a mapping list
{IDk, PKk, SKk, Certk, {WIDk,l}ωl = 1}, and stored the list
in the account pools. Wallet addresses of tie k are uploaded to
its nearest EAG account pool during system initialization. In tie
k, the wallet integrity is verified, and it gets the last information
concerning the wallet from the MP and the EAG-CB.
All transaction records are stored in the EBC by the MP and
credit payments are recorded by the CB.
2) Choosing Roles in ET: Energy ties (energy purchasers and
sellers) in P2P-ET select their roles according to the prevalent
energy conditions and subsequent power demands. To address
local energy demands from purchasers, Excess energy ties might
become energy dealers.
3) ET Among Sellers and Purchasers: Energy demands which
consists of the extent of energy from energy purchasers have
been transferred to the transaction server of the close EAG.
Transaction servers work as controllers in the EAG, counting the
total energy requirements and transmitting them to local sellers.
In addition, the EAG acts as a dealers for energy ties, setting
dealt prices based on prevalent energy markets and encouraging
local energy vendors to participate. The energy vendors have de-
termined the selling power and provided replies to the controller.
The controller manages the power request and supply within the
energy ties. After that, wireless power/power lines transmit the
energy from the power vendors to relevant purchasers.
4) Payments Using ECs: ECs have been transmitted from
the wallet of a purchaser to the wallet address of the seller
through an energy purchaser, as illustrated in Fig 2. Section III
provides additional details. For the purpose of verifying this
payment activity, the energy seller gathers the most current BC
information from the EAG’s MP. Novel transaction records are
generated by the energy purchasers. Energy sellers verify and
digitally sign these transaction records, so these records have
been uploaded to EAGs for inspection. Then, both energy sellers
and purchasers receive an increase in credit values.
The EBC provides incentives so that ties address their local
energy requests out of self-interest, as a means to balance energy
demand and supply. Based on the participation metering of
energy flows among purchasers and sellers, the energy purchaser
with the largest participation to energy providing within the
EAG has been given ECs. The proof-of-flow is the special
proof-of-work (PoW) for energy ties of energy participations,
(like the entire amount of energy traded).
5) Building Blocks in EBC: Each EAG has collected total
local transaction archives over the specified duration and next
encrypted signed each record to ensure its authenticity. The
transaction records have been structured into blocks as can be
seen in Fig. 2. Every block consists of a cryptographic hash
that points back to the previous blocks of the EBC in order to
provide verification and traceability. EAGs attempt to discover
their own PoW regarding datum survey (such as a hash amount
meeting the specified hardness) like Bitcoin. The EAG com-
putes the hash content of the block according to the random
nonce amount ϑ, the prior block hash amount, time-stamp,
and merkle root of transactions (known as historydata) [12].
Videlicet, Hash(ϑ+ historydata) < Difficulty. The system is
able to adjust Difficulty with the aim of controlling the speed
of identifying the certain ϑ. Once an authentic PoW (such as
ϑ) is found, the quicker miner (EAG) has broadcasted the block
and the certain ϑ to the further EAGs. The further EAGs have
audited and verified the transaction archives in the block and ϑ.
The datum in this block would be added to the EBC in a linear,
chronological order if the other EAGs approve it, and the fastest
miner will be rewarded with ECs.
6) Carrying Out Consensus Process: The chief that is the most
rapid EAG with an authentic PoW and the authorized EAGs
carry out the consensus process. The leader has broadcasted
block data, times-tamp, and PoW to the further permitted EAGs
provide inspection and validation. The EAGs have audited the
block datum and broadcasted their verification outcomes with
their signatures among themselves to provide a reciprocal ver-
ification and supervision. When the inspection outcomes are
received, any EAG has compared its outcomes with the others
and sent the response back to the chief. The response contains
the inspection outcome of EAG, comparison outcome, signa-
tures, and archives of gained inspection outcomes. The obtained
responses from EAGs is analyzed by the leader. When whole
EAGs have agreed on the block information, the chief would
send a record consisting of prevalent audited block datum and
the relevant signature to whole permitted EAGs. These blocks
are then added to the consortium BC, and the leader has been
rewarded by ECs. In case some EAGs disagree with the block
information, the chief analyzes the inspection outcomes, and if
needed, sends it back to the EAGs for inspection.
EBCs are very scalable and could support network scale with
many IIoT ties. In contrast to public BCs, consensus of the

EBC occurs among a few authorized EAGs [13]. During the
growth of the network, the predefined ties can also scale the
calculating power and storage sources in response to the rise in
the transaction numbers [14]. No matter what size the network
is, the time taken to reach consensus of a new block is constant
once the EAGs have been formed [15].
III. PAYMENT BASED ON CREDIT FOR RAPID P2P_ET
Transaction records in new blocks are audited and verified by
whole authorized EAGs in EBC (such as the consensus process).
Consensus is completed after a certain amount of time, known
as the transaction confirmation time. Therefore, ECs for the
payment of transactions are sent to the relevant wallets address.
IIoT ties are still unable to trade energy regularly, even though
the EBC’s transaction confirmation time is shorter than Bitcoin’s
time (about 60 min) [16], [17]. Energy purchasers might not have
any ECs in order to trade energy regularly. In order to solve this
issue, a credit-based payment layout is developed that makes it
possible to have P2P-ET frequently by EC loans.
As shown in Fig. 3, any authorized EAG has a CB that operates
as a trusted bank tie that has sufficient ECs. Energy ties can
obtain EC loans from CBs based on the credit amounts, and the
EC would then be transmitted through accounts of CB to the
addresses of wallet which are divided among the borrowers and
CBs.
Here is additional information about the credit-based payment
layout.
1) Token Requesting: In order to complete payments, a bor-
rower ψk (such as a purchaser of energy k who does not have
sufficient ECs) is able to use for tokens according to the credit
amount through the local CB.
a) Stage 1: ψk has sent a demand consisting of the
correct identity IDk, certificate Certk, whole ap-
plied wallet addresses {WIDk,l}Kl=1, loan quantity
amounti, and prevalent credit amount Cerditk to
the EAG m, videlicet, ψk → EAGm : requestk =
{IDk‖{WIDk,l}Kl=1‖Certk‖creditk‖amountk}.
b) Stage 2: When requestk is received, the CB has verified
the identity of ψk and checked fund-flows of the given
{WIDk,l}Kl=1 based on the archives in account pools and
CBs. So the CB computes prevalent asset of ψk.
c) Stage 3: The below conditions must be met for ψk to
get a token: energycoin account of ψkhas some wealth;
there is a regular income for the account (such as selling
the energy to obtain ECs); and the ψk’s credit amount
is positive. The CB computes an optimum loan content
of ψk and the relevant penalty and interest rates, such as
prices of loan. Section IV provides additional information
about loan pricing.
d) Stage 4: The CB has created a divided wallet (walletkcb)
and sent private key and public key of the wallet (i.e.,
PKk
cb, and SKk
cb) to ψk. The PKk
cb indicates the divided
wallet addresses for ψk and the CB. Two ψk and the CB
have been permitted to apply the ECs in walletkcb, and fill
the wallet if needed.
e) Stage 5: ψk has received a reply consisting of a token
(Tokenk) and the token signature SignSKcb
(Tokenk) are
as follows:
EAGm → ψk : response
=
{(
PKk
cb, SK
k
cb
) ‖Tokenk‖SignSKcb
(Tokenk) ‖Timestamp
}
where Tokenk
=
{
balancek‖t‖Certkcb‖amountk‖Certc|b
‖buffer‖pre− recordk‖T imestamp
}
and pre− recordk
= {RPk(s, f)‖Hash(TXk)k =12,...,h}.
f) n which, Tokenk consists of current balance balancek,
loan amount amountk, an authorization certificate
Certkcb, validity duration t of walletkcb, loan repayment
buffer buffer, and prior loan archives pre− recordk. ψk
must pay EC loan during buffer again, Aside from that,
ψk would endure with the fee delays (i.e., penalty). pre−
recordk includes a loan repayment record RPk(s, f) and
the hash amount of prior payment according on the credit
archives Hash(TXk). In RPk(s, f), s refers to the num-
ber of loan repayments during buffer in prior archives of
loan, however f shows the number of nontimely repay-
ment of loans.
2) ECs Payment: Throughout ET, ψk applies ECs in walletkcb
to complete payment. Any payment according to thewalletkcb has
been recorded and confirmed via the local CB. The CB has put
the hash amount of payment relevant datum into pre− recordk
in order to check out wealth of ψk If needed. Here is additional
information about payment operations:.
a) Step 1: The borrower ψk has sent the following Payment
consisting of the token (Tokenk), the token signing and
license certificate (Certkcb) to the seller of energy Si.

DING et al.: PEER-2-PEER MANAGEMENT AND SECURE POLICY OF THE ENERGY INTERNET IN SMART MICROGRIDS 5693
Si has verified Certkcb and the validity duration of
walletkcb (i.e., t) in Tokenk, and checked whole prior payment
according to the credit archives in the EBC in order to verify
prevalent balance in walletkcb.
ψk → Si : Payment
= {Tokenk‖Certk‖CertkcbSignSKk
(Tokenk) ‖Timestamp.
b) Step 2: Si has sent the Tokenk, the energy bill, and the
wallet address in order to receive ECs (WIDSi
), a digital
signing of the mentioned data to the CB
Si → EAGm : Energybill
= {Certi‖Bill‖WIDSi
‖Payment‖
SignSKi
(Payment) ‖Timestamp}.
c) Step 3: The CB has verified the receiving Tokenk via
comparing to the original Tokenk recorded in the CB.
The CB has checked which if the balance in Tokenk
is sufficient in order to pay for the Bill. If yes, the CB
has transferred ECs in walletkcb to WIDSi
in order to
complete payment. If no, the CB has sent a notification
of inadequate equilibrium to ψk.
d) Step 4: Then, the CB has updated equilibrium information
of walletkcband Tokenk, and added the digital signing
to the novel token Tokennewk . The mentioned payment
according to the credit archives has been recorded and
audited in the EBC, the new token will be transfer to the
purchaser simultaneously.
3) Repayment of EC Loans: Once credibility period of tokenk,
ψk has received the latest tokenTokennewest
k consisting of whole
hash amounts of the payment according to the credit archives
applying tokenk.
Here are three states of loan repayments.
a) State One: ψk is repaid the loan with the interest as the
dealing fee to the CB if ψk can repay the EC loan during
the repayment buffer. Section IV computes the benefit.
b) State Two: If ψk is not be able to refund the loan timely, f
in RPk(s, f) would be added one, and the credit amount
of the purchaser would be reduced. The novel credit
amount of the purchaser has been shown by,Creditkn+1 =
Creditkn − d
amounti in which Creditkn is the credit amount of nth
energy transaction. d shows a stable and d > 0. The CB
has generated an archive regarding to the occurrence, and
so stored the archive in the MP and uploaded it to the EBC.
ψk still suffered the penalty relating to the loan value after
completing the EC loan repayment.
c) State Three: If ψk has rejected to repay or is not be able to
refund the loan within a long-term, like one year, the CB
has placed the borrower to the blacklist and broadcasted
the data to whole ties in the EBC. After that, whole IIoT
ties and CBs have rejected with the aim of cooperating
with the borrower.
IV. OPTIMUM LOAN PRICING IN PAYMENT ACCORDING TO
THE CREDIT
The present part offers the description of the issue of the
loan pricing value and EC loan amount (such as penalty and
interest rates) for borrowers in order to enhance the economic
advantages of CBs. Energy purchasers with insufficient ECs
work as borrower in order to use for loan from the CB within the
local EAG. Then, the borrower who acted as energy purchaser
is able to purchase energy from energy seller.
In the local EAGm, for the borrower ψk, the loan content
given via a CB m(i.e., CBm) has been shown as Rk. where
k ∈ I and ψk ∈ B. Γmin
k shows the minimum energy resource
demand for ψk and ρk indicates the defined price of the energy
source in advance of loan demands. The CB should supply Rk
ρk
loan to ψk in order to finish energy payment. The local CB
is considered to have sufficient ECs in order to support loan
requests of borrowers. CBs that are near each other are able to
cooperate to meet loan requests if one local CB lacks sufficient
ECs for borrowers. The ψk
′s satisfaction function is given by
usat = dk ln
(
Rk
ρk
− Γmin
k + φk
)
. (1)
In which dk > 0 and φk > 0 shows predefined factors forψk.
The ψk
′s utility is given by
uk = ξk [usat − βkRktk]− (1 − ξk)σkRk. (2)
where ξk defines the capability to repay the loan, videlicet, this
is the probability which ψk is able to refund the loan during the
refund buffer. The loan repayment recordRPk(s, f)ofψk can be
used to calculate ξk (as noted in in Section III). Where 0 < ξk =
s
s+f ≤ 1. Interest rate of the loan is shown through ψk which is
determined via the CB. Penalty rate of the repayment delay is
donated by σk. σk = 
k tkβk is considered as the relationship
among the interest rate and the penalty rate [18]. Where 
k > 1
shows a predefined factor, such as 3.5, and is the time when the
loan started is shown by tk > 0.
The prize of the CB includes the loan interest from ψk, and
the delayed cost (such as penalty) if ψk is not be able to refund
the loan timely [18].Rktkck shows the overhead of the CB. The
unity cost ofψk’s loan for the CB is donated by ck. So, The CB’s
economic benefits can be summarized in the following way:
ukbc = ζk [βkRktk −Rktkck] + (1 − ζk)σkRk. (3)
In which ζk shows predetermined credit grade (CG) index
relating to ψk’s CG determined via the CB (there, 0 < ζk ≤ 1).
Loan histories of borrowers can be used to calculate ζk. In accor-
dance with energy purchasers’ credit values, energy purchasers’
CGs are categorized into various levels. Higher CG starts higher
ζk. Section V-C provides additional information about the value
of ζk.
An uncooperative Stackelberg game is formulated in the
article, in which the borrowers are followers and a CB is a
chief. Ultimately, the penalty amount is specified through the
CB (i.e., σk) for any borrower, respectively. Any borrower
would reply with the best value of loan (i.e., Rk) based on the

definition, G is

In order to solve the Stackelberg equilibrium for the above-
formulated game, the backward induction method is used, that
has been taken from [20].
V. ANALYZE THE SECURITY AND NUMERICAL OUTCOMES
Firstly, a security analysis of the EBC is provided here. Then,
the EBC ’s efficiency is evaluated and a real dataset is used in
order to assess the efficiency of the credit-based payment layout.
A. Security Analysis on EBC
To protect the privacy and security of ET, a consortium BC is
used by the EBC in contrast to traditional communication secu-
rity and privacy protection. The BC-relevant security efficiencies
have been summarized below [22].
1) Get Rid of the Reputable Intermediary: The ties of IIoT
trade energy in a P2P manner in the EBC instead of tradi-
tional centralized trading that relies on global trusted in-
termediaries. IIoT ties with authorized EAGs are entitled
to trade energy equally. The EBCs are scalable and robust
without the need for a globally trusted intermediary.
2) Wallet Security: An adversary is not able to open the
IIoT tie’s wallet and abduct ECs if it lacks corresponding
certificates and keys. Since any tie of IIoT has a specific
wallet associated with the EC bill, multiplex wallet ad-
dresses are used as pseudonyms of the wallet to protect
the privacy.
3) Transaction Authentication: Other entities, such as IIoT
ties and trusted EAGs, inspection and authenticate whole
transaction data publicly. Because of high costs, com-
promising whole entities on the EBC is not possible. A
transaction information with something wrong would still
be detected and fixed before being structured into a block
even if the EAG has been compromised.
4) Data Unforgeability: Consortium BC’s decentralized na-
ture along with digitally-signed transactions guarantees
that adversaries cannot act as ties of IIoT in order to
corrupt the network. This is due to the fact that the
adversary is not be able to forge the digital signature of
a tie/control most of the resources of the system [22].
Due to encryption with IIoT tie keys, an adversary who
controls one or more EAGs in the EBC is able to learn
nothing about the raw data. The audited and stored data
are not able to be forged by the adversary in the EBC [16].
5) No Double-Cost: The EC uses digital signatures in order
to ascertain possession and a public record of transactions

in order to avoid double cost. A P2P network is used
to share transaction histories, and PoW is used to verify
transactions.
B. Performance Analysis on EBC
The confirmation time of transactions under various frequen-
cies of ET in several BCs is compared in this article, and the
efficiency of the mean dealing velocity of the suggested payment
layout according to the credit is evaluated. Dealing velocity is
defined as the number of completed ET per hour. The entire
dealing verification time on the mean is equal to the mean time
of completing the consensus procedure of the ET for an energy
tie. For illustration purposes, the efficiency of fifty couples of
IIoT ties for 4 hours is simulated. Traditional BCs confirm
transactions in 60 min, such as Bitcoin, while the EBC confirms
transactions in 10 min [20]. ET ‘frequency can take amounts
from set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with equivalent probability for ties of
IIoT within an hour. The wallet of any IIoT tie contains 20 ECs
for P2P-ET.
According to Fig 4(a), when the ET ’ frequency rises, the
total confirmation time on the average for an energy tie for
a traditional BC (such as Bitcoin) takes longer compared to
that of the EBC. As opposed to the traditional BC, the EBC
has carried out consensus just on the prechosen EAGs in lieu
of whole joint ties. The average transaction speed of ET in
various layouts is illustrated in Fig 4(b). Ties with insufficient
ECs are not able to carry out the next ET until the last ET has
completed the consensus process. Based on Fig 4(b), the EBC
and the traditional BC both contain the upper limit for the mean
dealing velocity within an hour. The EAG’s payment layout
according to the credit has a faster average dealing velocity

due to the assistance of CBs. IIoT ties benefit from these CBs
because adequate EC is provided to enable continuous ET on
the EBC without being impeded by transaction confirmation
delays. According to outcomes, the suggested system facilitates
fast P2P-ET, making it possible for frequent trading between ties
of IIoT.
C. Proficiency Analysis on Payment According to Credit
The efficiency of suggested payment layout according to
credit on the basis of an actual dataset from the loans is-
sued by the lenders club in [23] is examined in article.
Current loan status (such as fully paid), credit values, ad-
dresses, and latest payment information are included in the
dataset. Based on the loan information of lenders club, Fig. 5
shows 890 000 observations with 35 incrementally rising CGs
(”A1”, ”A2”, . . . , ”B1”, ”B2”, . . . , ”G4”, ”G5”). A total of
100 borrowers with various CGs ranging from A1 to G5 in
IIoT are considered. The nth CG includes a relevant CG ratio
rn = 1 − n−1
N , here N = 35. Based on the probability distri-
bution histogram in Fig. 5, it is possible to determine whether
a borrower belongs to a particular CG. There is a division of
the borrowers into 5 groups for applying for EC loans from
five CBs, respectively. Loans are provided to 20 borrowers at
any CB with restricted ECs. Two heuristic distribution layouts
of ECs are investigated in order to compare efficiency with
the suggested layout. One heuristic layout allows borrowers to
request a random extent of ECs from 5 CBs. Another layout
is that borrowers may use for the mean value ECs. Based on
information about borrowers (such as credit value, income, loan
records), the proper pricing decisions for them is made. Table I
gives further parameters about the suggested layout.
It is worth noting that peer to peer technique has some signifi-
cant advantages, compared to the centralized control and tries to
give some benefits for the distributed management. Therefore, it
is expected that the computational burden would be distributed
among all agents. Fig. 6(a) compares the efficiency of EC
distribution layouts. As an instance, the loan interest price is set
at 0.1 using random value layout (RVL) and mean value layout
(MVL). The suggested layout is able to provide CBs with opti-
mal economic benefits. According to the suggested layout, the
mean economic advantage for 5 CBs is 226.9% higher compared

to that for RVL, and 64.8% higher compared to that for MVL.
Fig 6(b) shows the same outcomes. In the suggested layout, the
mean economic advantage for five borrowers randomly selected
is 5.7% higher compared to that of RVL, and 24.1% higher
compared to that of MVL.
The convergence progress of the economic advantages of the
randomly selected CB and optimum loan extent of the randomly
selected borrower is shown in Fig 7, respectively. It is evident that
each of the economic advantages and the optimum loan extent
quickly approach their optimum amounts after 19 iterations,
respectively.
Efficiency effects of CG ratio ζk on CB, and effects of ξk
on borrowers are shown in Fig. 8. According to Fig. 8(a),

the economic advantages of CB reduce as ζk rises. Due to
the fact that a borrower with a premiere CG is more likely to
refund the loan timely, leading to a lower penalty for the CB.
Fig. 8(b) illustrates how the repayment capability of borrower ξk
helps improve the economic benefit average for borrowers. The
findings in Figs. 4–8 support the conclusion that the suggested
EBC and a credit-based payment layout are useful and effective
in ET in the IIoT. The proposed technique can be improved by
using advanced technologies, e.g., Internet of things and Ad hoc
[24]–[25], which are the future work of this article.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, a unified EBC according to consortium BC for
securing ET in several typical IIoT scenarios was presented that
includes including V2Gs, MGs, and EHNs. In order to avoid
the transaction delays that result from transaction confirmation,
a credit-based payment layout was developed that facilitates
frequent and fast ET between energy ties via credit-based
payments. In order to maximize CB’s economic benefits, an
optimum pricing plan for EC loans according to the Stackelberg
game was offered. In order to assess the EBC and the payment
layout according to the credit, security and efficiency analyses
are performed, respectively. Based on a security analysis, the
EBC provides a safe ET, and outcomes indicate that the credit-
based payment layout and EBC were efficient and useful for
ET. Further study of a few interesting issues was worthwhile,
like optimizing the number of energy aggregators and devising
specific layouts for extreme scenarios, such as ties with very
poor or very good credit values. Results demonstrate the high
efficiency of the proposed technique, compared to the existing
techniques.
