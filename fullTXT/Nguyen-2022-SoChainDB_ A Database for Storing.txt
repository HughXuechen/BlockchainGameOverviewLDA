ABSTRACT
Social networks have become an inseparable part of human ac-
tivities. Most existing social networks follow a centralized sys-
tem model, which despite storing valuable information of users,
arise many critical concerns such as content ownership and over-
commercialization. Recently, decentralized social networks, built
primarily on blockchain technology, have been proposed as a sub-
stitution to eliminate these concerns. Since decentralized architec-
tures are mature enough to be on par with the centralized ones,
decentralized social networks are becoming more and more popular.
Decentralized social networks can offer both common options like
writing posts and comments and more advanced options such as
reward systems and voting mechanisms. They provide rich eco-
systems for the influencers to interact with their followers and other
users via staking systems based on cryptocurrency tokens. The vast
and valuable data of the decentralized social networks open several
new directions for the research community to extend human behav-
ior knowledge. However, accessing and collecting data from these
social networks is not easy because it requires strong blockchain
knowledge, which is not the main focus of computer science and so-
cial science researchers. Hence, our work proposes the SoChainDB
framework that facilitates obtaining data from these new social
networks. To show the capacity and strength of SoChainDB, we
crawl and publish Hive data - one of the largest blockchain-based
social networks. We conduct extensive analyses to understand the
insight of Hive data and discuss some interesting applications, e.g.,
game, non-fungible tokens market built upon Hive. It is worth men-
tioning that our framework is well-adaptable to other blockchain
social networks with minimal modification. SoChainDB is publicly
accessible at http://sochaindb.com and the dataset is available under
the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

1 INTRODUCTION
Social networks provide many useful services for their end-users;
therefore, they are a part of billions of users’ lives worldwide nowa-
days. For example, Facebook had around 2.85 billion monthly active
users at the end of March 2021 [16], and Twitter has nearly 300
million active users [35]. Such a large userbase creates a rich and
colossal dataset of various aspects of human activities. However,
unfortunately, most social network services are deployed upon a
centralized architecture. In other words, each social network is un-
der the umbrella of a particular organization or company. Despite
having many advantages, a centralized architecture still contains
several fundamental disadvantages:
(1) The content ownership is not in the hands of its creators.
Although users generate content through their interactions
in social networks, the content is hosted by the service
providers. Hence, “who is the actual owner?” is still an open
question. The data leakage risk makes the problem worse.
(2) Internet censorship is another thread of centralized archi-
tectures. Service providers are under pressure from other
organizations to remove or delete posts or comments dis-
pleasing those organizations. Therefore, they are ineffective
tools to protect the voice of their users.
(3) Due to their large userbase, social networks are being ex-
ploited for commercialization by marketing companies and
advertising agencies. Advertising contents are increasingly

integrated into many popular social media platforms with-
out permission from users. Such activities could harm the
engagement of users’ experience, and have negative impact
on users’ behavior.
Due to these drawbacks, distributed social network architecture
has been proposed as a reasonable substitution. The technology
behind it is blockchain which ensures the completeness of data
by leveraging cryptography. Since its proposal, social networks
powered by blockchain have been evolving gradually, and they are
now ready to serve millions of users. Decentralized social networks
provide many benefits: First, their functionality is on par with the
conventional social network platforms. For instance, standard fea-
tures such as following users, posting articles, writing comments
are all available in blockchain-based social networks. Second, they
inherit the transparency from blockchain technology. Since all data
is stored via blockchain, it is publicly accessible, and decentraliza-
tion makes blockchain social networks impossible to manipulate.
Third, users of blockchain social networks are rewarded for their
activities. Such a system encourages users to engage more in so-
cial networks and benefits their activities. Finally, we can leverage
blockchain technology of decentralized social networks to build
applications such as games or trading platforms to help the existing
network userbase. These potentials in decentralized social networks
offer the research community many novel directions to understand
human behaviors through valuable and massive data generated
by variety of user interactions on the system. However, collecting
data from decentralized social networks has several challenges:
First, blockchain knowledge is required, which is not negligible and
could create a high barrier for scientists from other fields e.g. social
science who are not knowledgeable in cryptography. Second, the de-
mand for a computational resource to synchronize complete data is
usually high and expensive. For example, we required a server with
more than 100GB RAM to synchronize one full node of the Hive
network. Third, a cleaning process is a must since blockchain can
be used for multiple purposes, not only social networks. Therefore,
we propose SoChainDB, a framework for crawling data from decen-
tralized social networks, and publish Hive’s data - one of the largest
decentralized social networks built on blockchain technology. The
contribution of our work can be summarized as follows:
• We first propose SoChainDB, a generalized database frame-
work and publicly available pipeline for extracting data from
blockchain-based decentralized social networks.
• We publish the entire dataset of one of the largest blockchain-
based social networks called Hive. It is available to download
via multiple methods such as public APIs service and com-
pressed archive files.
• We provide several unique use-cases of blockchain-based
social networks that could be potential future directions for
the research community to explore.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sur-
veys the related literature, Section 3 gives an overview of blockchain-
based, in general, and Hive, in specific, social networks. Section 4
describes the dataset collection pipeline, and Section 5 presents the
analysis of three use cases of SoChainDB. Finally, Section 6 wraps
up our study and discusses the future direction.
Ethics Declaration: Data stored in the Hive blockchain cannot
be manipulated by any individuals or organizations, and there is no
restriction in accessing data. Therefore, the Hive blockchain data,
including comments, votes, posts, and all other blockchain-type
transactions, are considered public data. Accordingly, no permission
is required to collect, store, analyze and publish the data. The data
stored in our SochainDB is marginally different from the stored
data in Hive due to our noise filtering preprocessing step.
2 RELATEDWORKS
The karate club dataset of Zachary [37] is probably the first public
social network dataset. Over the years, many more public datasets
have been proposed for social networks studies: Reddit dataset [4],
Telegram dataset [5], Wikipedia dataset [10], Gowalla social net-
work dataset [11], Youtube dataset [36], Yelp dataset [31], ArXiv
dataset [12], eBay dataset [27], and the Kaggle network dataset [9].
McAuley and Leskovec [25] also published a dataset containing
user connections in Facebook, Twitter, Google+ social networks.
Recently, Li et al. [22, 23] released a dataset of operation in
the blockchain-based social network Steem, called SteemOps. We
provide in-depth analysis to show the excellence of our work over
these existing ones:
• Data Completeness: These works only provide a subset of
the entire network. For example, Li et al. [23] released data
with only operations of the Steem network. We argue that
without other kinds of data such as friend networks and post
content, it restricts research questions that help us under-
stand the whole picture of blockchain-based social networks.
Our system is guaranteed to provide the complete data of
social networks.
• Data Readiness and Accessibility: The only way to use data
in the current literature [22, 23] is to download the archival
files that contain all information. Such a method has two
problems: First, it does not allow users to investigate the
network. For example, suppose researchers want to study
an event in a specific period. They need to download and
extract the whole archival file, then filter data according
to the desired period. Second, archival files can produce
computational problems. Since the archival files of the whole
network are enormous, it is easy to exceed the computational
resource. To overcome such obstacles, SochainDB provides
two friendly options for users, especially data scientists and
researchers, to query and download the data, including SQL-
like interfaces and APIs.
• Data (Sub-)Instantaneity: Archival files are usually not in-
sync with the original social networks. Notably, the latest
SteemOps dataset [23] was released on Dec 1st, 2019. It is
not possible to solve emerging problems like the COVID-19
outbreak and the record price of Bitcoin with obsolete data.
For this reason, the data in SochainDB is guaranteed to be
near-real-time with the actual data of Hive blockchain.

Figure 1: Growth of active users on Hive over time. From
April 2020 to May 2021, the monthly growth of active users is
stable, around 1,600 to 6,700 users per month. Still, since June
2021, its monthly growth has increased significantly because
of the peak price of Hive tokens during this period [13].
communities and the new board of Steemit Inc. [3], Hive became
an entirely community-based blockchain. In more than a year, the
growth of active users per month in Hive blockchain has remark-
ably increased from approximately 1,600 active users in April 2020
to more than 250,000 in August 2021 (see Figure 1)1. This is partly
due to the transformation from the Steem communities to the Hive
network, besides the fact that the decentralized social network
concepts have become more and more widespread over time. In
the current version of the SoChainDB framework, we only focus
on supporting and integrating the data extracted from the Hive
blockchain to ensure the overall best performance. Moreover, Hive
and Steem share a nearly similar architecture; therefore, our ap-
proach could easily and quickly adapt to the Steem network with
minimal modification in the subsequent versions. Figure 2 shows
the overview architecture of Hive blockchain. Here, we only dis-
cuss the core components of Hive blockchain used for generating a
decentralized social network.
3.2 Preliminary of Blockchain-related Social
Networks
The rapid growth of blockchain technology has attracted more and
more companies and organizations working in areas related to the
social network to support and integrate this technology into their
platforms. Although several firms [1, 21, 26] claim that their social
networks have built-in blockchain technology, most only incorpo-
rate a small part of this cutting-edge technology. For instance, one
of the most straightforward approaches is often chosen to only use
cryptocurrency tokens as loyalty points or a type of integrated-in
currency for the users to trade in their systems through Smart Con-
tract platforms in some of the blockchain available in the market,
1The users are classified as “active” if they publish at least one post, comment, or vote,
even if they do not have any actions later.
such as Ethereum [15], EOS.IO [7], and Binance Smart Chain [6].
The approach has the advantage of low cost and does not require
advanced knowledge of blockchain technology. However, users’
data is still entirely in the hands of organizations operating and
developing such social networks. Therefore, these social platforms,
in reality, still follow centralized models, and users do not fully
control their data. At the same time, this is an essential point of a
decentralized system like blockchain is aiming.
On the other hand, besides the mentioned social networks, few
other platforms still focus on building and providing a completely
decentralized social network, which requires a solid technical back-
ground in blockchain technology and much effort to persuade
and attract the users from traditional social networks. Specifically,
the most notables are the Steem network [30] and its successor,
Hive blockchain [20]. The primary difference between these two
blockchain-powered social networks and the rest is their com-
pletely decentralized architectures. Mainly, the core characteristics
of blockchain technology, including immutability, transparency, no
double spent, append-only, non-repudiation, and no single point fail-
ure, are the crucial targets in designing these social networks. These
characteristics are evident through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake
(DPoS) consensus mechanism using a voting system for choos-
ing the block producers called “witnesses” per cycle and the fully
decentralized designed ledger.
In addition, Block.one, the organization behind the popular net-
work EOS.IO, introduced Voice being a promising decentralized
social network based on EOS.IO blockchain in 2019 [8]. The an-
nounced platform Voice inherits the advantages mentioned on
Steem and Hive and also integrates Smart Contract system, a no-
table feature of EOS.IO. However, at the moment, in January 2022,
the new social network is still under the beta version. Therefore,
we will integrate this network in our SoChainDB framework after
its public release.
Consensus Mechanism: As a successor to Steem, Hive applies
the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus [20], which Daniel
Larimer invented in 2014 as an alternative to the Proof-Of-Work
consensus algorithm widely used by several famous blockchains,
e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum. The first implementation of DPoS was
on a decentralized platform exchanging cryptocurrency named Bit-
shares in 2015 [32], then in Steem [30], ARK [2], Lisk [24], and most
recently in the platforms of TRON [34], EOS.IO [7], and Hive [20].
DPoS consensus encourages blockchain users to vote and elect del-
egates to validate the next block as a popular evolution of the Proof-
of-Stake concept. Regular users could vote on delegates through the
consensus mechanism by staking their tokens into a pool and as-
signing those to a specific delegate. On the other hand, the delegates
are responsible for achieving consensus to generate and validate
new blocks. Usually, the collected rewards of the delegates are pro-
portionally shared with their respective voters when contributing
to the blockchain.
The proponents of the DPoS consensus mechanism believe that
it is a better democratic approach for a more comprehensive and
diverse group of people participating in the selection process of the
next block validator. Moreover, the DPoS election system is based
on the earned reputation of the delegates and not the entire wealth.
Therefore, if an elected node misbehaves or does not obtain the
required performance, it will be quickly suspended and substituted

by another. Additionally, the limited number of validators (e.g., in
Figure 2, the Hive network has twenty actual elected witnesses
and one backup witness) allows the blockchain network to reach
consensus more quickly. As a result, DPoS-powered blockchains
are more scalable and can process more transactions per second
(TPS) than Proof-of-Work and traditional Proof-of-Stake.
Hive - Social Network: Since Hive supports all basic functional-
ities of traditional social networks, users can create, edit, comment,
and share posts. The posts can contain text, links, hashtags, men-
tions, and metadata such as timestamp, author, edit the information.
Note that multimedia data, including images or videos, are not
stored directly in the Hive blockchain due to the block size limita-
tions and the blockchain’s overall performance, especially when
a new block is created and broadcasted throughout the network
in seconds. Moreover, other users can view and interact with the
post by reply, comment, and reblog. These ensure users’ consistent
experience and similarity to regular social networks.
Hive - Blockchain: The Hive underlying blockchain architec-
ture allows easy storage and retrieval of immutable chains of large
amounts of data and information. It also provides an efficient trans-
action platform in only three seconds without any fee. Transaction
confirmation time and fees are usually among the most important
challenges of promoting a blockchain’s development and adaptabil-
ity of use. For example, the Bitcoin network takes an average of ten
minutes to validate a new block with transaction fees that tab to
60 USD at a price in April 2021 [29]. Besides, when Hive witnesses
generate a new block, it includes all verified transactions or opera-
tions that users perform. These operations could be classified into
four primary groups [20, 30]: (i) post and vote, (ii) witness election,
(iii) followers/followings, and (iv) cryptocurrency transfer.
Hive - Tokens and Rewards System: Similar to the miners
of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Hive witnesses receive Hive cryp-
tocurrency tokens rewarded by Hive blockchain when generating
and validating new blocks. The Hive tokens can power up a Hive
account for more substantial voting power and increased cura-
tion rewards, more resource credits to make transactions on Hive
blockchain, and more stake in Hive governance to assign and vote
witnesses and projects. Also, the Hive platform provides another

nism. It is integrated into the blockchain core using Hive tokens,
and Hive Backed Dollars (HDB) tokens. Those authors who write
engaging and trending content can receive Hive tokens or HDB to-
kens from other users on the network. Moreover, some Hive-based
back-ends such as PeakD [28] or Hive.blog [19] can rank a post
based on users’ interaction and the number of Hive tokens staked.
The higher the rank, the more likely the post would appear on these
decentralized web applications’ front page or trending tabs.

4.1 Pipeline
Figure 3 illustrates the pipeline of SoChainDB, including the fol-
lowing four steps:

• Scraping: To obtain the entire Hive blockchain dataset, we
should synchronize a Hive full-node. Setting up a full node
often requires advanced blockchain knowledge of custom
configuration to select the suitable blockchain plugins and
index the data in a sufficient time with reasonable compu-
tational resources. These settings are also relevant to the
peer-to-peer protocol that synchronizes the data block. Thus,
if a regular researcher or a data scientist wants to access and
exploit information from these types of decentralized social
networks, these are significant obstacles. Moreover, ensuring
data integrity is always the highest priority of our framework
when extracting from each block on the Hive distributed
ledger. Hence, all scraped data are re-checked with public
peer nodes for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
• Cleaning: Our system encodes the data into the NDJSON-
formatted files, in which every line has JSON format, and
then splits them into chunks as an intermediate step for
simultaneous preprocessing. This technical step is necessary
because the size of the uncompressed blockchain dataset is
almost one terabyte. Moreover, the Hive blockchain provides
several dynamic JSON fields that allow users to push data in
custom fields encoded as a regular string. Thus, the custom
JSON strings should be decoded, and all field incompatibility
issues should be refined and resolved before storing in a
cloud service.
• Storing: In this step, table schemas based on the data chunks
are automatically generated with the types of each block
field being homogeneous before uploading them to a suitable
cloud platform specialized in big data. In the current version,
we use Google BigQuery as the central platform to store
the decentralized social network data because of its high
adaptability and compatibility with multiple varieties of data,
as well as the high performance on querying big data and
scalability [33]. However, our system architecture allows us
to migrate to other platforms with similar functionalities to
Google BigQuery flexibly with little change.
• Serving: We have implemented several blockchain views to
optimize the query time and secure our APIs from anom-
aly users’ behaviors while crawling data. As significant and
core features, our public APIs are listed and served through
our front-end at http://sochaindb.com. The detail of these
APIs is described in Section 4.2. Likewise, we summarize
blockchain operation statistics and present some prominent
analyses about the Hive decentralized social network in Sec-
tions 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. We provide an HTTP service to down-
load the compressed archive files at http://sochaindb.l3s.
uni-hannover.de.
4.2 SoChainDB’s Public APIs and Homepage
APIs service: SoChainDB provides a RESTful API service built
on Falcon [17] to query our clouded data on Google BigQuery
through some end-points. This highly optimized framework has
significant features, such as asynchronous I/O support and simple
API modeling. Falcon also showed an outstanding performance via
intensive experiments on benchmarks and comparison with various
other Python web API frameworks in several realistic scenarios
in 2018 [18]. It assists us in accelerating the incoming requests to
access our database in parallel versus sequential ways. Our APIs
are generally designed to process big datasets with thousands of
requests per second. The API service is deployed at http://sochaindb.
com/hive-api/v1.0.0/, and its source code is publicly accessible at
our Github repository 2. Since the hard-fork of Hive from Steem
happened in late March 2020 [3], our APIs in the early version
could only support the Hive blockchain data fromMarch 27, 2020 to
December 6, 2021. We schedule to update the database every month
and add the Steem blockchain data in the subsequent versions. All
our RESTful APIs use the GET methods divided into three groups
to meet the basic requirements of datasets that suit social network
researchers and data scientists:
• Blocks: could be used to crawl the entire blocks containing
all of the transactions from the Hive blockchain data. This
“blocks” API allows users to collect complete data of each
block in the public ledger, including a large amount of infor-
mation about various operations types.
• Posts: could be employed to crawl posts data that we fil-
tered from the blocks transactions. In general, the collected
posts are the transactions containing operation type as com-
ment_options_operation having a title field.
• Comments: could be used to get comments that we filtered
from the blocks transactions. The comments transactions
have the same post-operation type comment_options_operation
with an empty string in title.
We also provide APIs specialized in collecting data for statistical
purposes with a 10,000 default size. However, users can easily mod-
ify the size by changing the size parameter before requests. For
example, through the GET request, we can:
(1) Crawl a list of users having the top amount of posts: http:
//sochaindb.com/hive-api/v1.0.0/top_posts?size=1000
(2) Crawl a list of users having the top amount of comments:
http://sochaindb.com/hive-api/v1.0.0/top_comments?size=1000
(3) Crawl a list of contents for top posts and comments: http:
//sochaindb.com/hive-api/v1.0.0/top_words?size=1000
In Table 2, we summarize the list of API parameters used in the
APIs service and their compatibility for each provided API.
SoChainDB Homepage: We built a website to show the de-
mos and update more information. Figure 4 is a screenshot of the
SoChainDB homepage. The top left corner of our homepage links
to our Github repository. The navigation bar on top of the web-
site provides several valuable resources to explore our website. For
instance, the “API Docs” menu shows a detailed document of our
provided APIs with various examples for ease of use. The rest of
our homepage visualizes some notable statistics of our dataset, e.g.,
word cloud of top comments and posts, top active users of Hive
networks according to the number of posts and comments.

and then present an in-depth analysis of the use cases.
5.1 Hive Ecosystem Overview
Hive is first used for its social network platform but with Hive
Engine, a side-chain layer enabling smart contracts to work on its
network, Hive also allows developers to build various decentralized
applications on top of its blockchain. There are several applica-
tions built on the Hive ecosystem. Some famous ones are: (i) Game:
Splinterlands, a multiplayer magic card game, and Rabona, a soccer
management game; (ii) Social: LeoFinance, a crypto traders com-
munity, and Actifit, a community for users to share their workouts;
(iii) Non-Fungible Tokens Markets: NFTMart and NFTShowroom as
notable marketplaces to purchase digital assets whose owners can
have proof of ownership; (iv) DeFi: The platforms to raise funds

5.2 Analysis of Hive Social Network
5.2.1 Overall Analysis. This section analyzes various aspects of
the Hive social network to depict Hive users’ rich and massive data.
Table 1 shows the overview statistics of the social network. The
table shows that Hive social network obtains a sizable adoption. For
instance, the total number of active users is more than 760,000, and
around 1,200 new users join the network every day. These users
generate more than three million posts in total and more than five
thousand posts per day. To further illustrate the evolution of the
network, we plot the growth of active users over time in Figure 1.
The figure shows that the growth of active users has significantly
increased by approximately 15,500% in over a year. It is an important

signal to show that the Hive social network is an active platform
that receives more and more users’ attention. We further plot the
Hive users’ activities over time in Figure 5 through the number of
posts, comments and communities.
The figure depicts the regular activities of Hive users every
month. Specifically, these users’ posts and comments continuously
increased fromAugust 2021 and reached 240K and 700K respectively
in January 2022. It shows another evidence that Hive is steadily
becoming a platform for users to share their daily life habits.
To form a network, each user has an option to follow others. The
essential feature of social networks and the follower/following net-
work should follow a power-law distribution [14]. Figure 6 shows
the follower/following distribution of users in the Hive network.
The figure states that Hive social network’s follower/following
relationship follows a power-law distribution, and it is similar to the
centralized networks such as Facebook and Twitter. This pattern is
also observed in the distribution of top active users by posts and
comments in Figure 7.
Reward system is a unique feature of the Hive decentralized
social network. Users could receive and claim their rewards in the
Hive platform by the “Hive Backed Dollars (HDB)" tokens and the
staked Hive tokens called “Hive Power." The former is related to
user content, e.g., posts, comments, and the latter is paid directly
to boost users’ popularity. While liquid Hive tokens could convert
to HBD, Hive Power is only based on the number of Hive tokens
users staked in the platform. Figure 8 displays the value of HBD
and Hive Power used by each user account over time. The figure
shows an interesting phenomenon: From April 2020 to June 2021,
the value of HBD per account increases over time. However, from
June 2021 to October 2021, this value decreases significantly, and
such a sudden drop also happens with the value of Hive power per
account. This is expected since the growth of active users in this
period is increased (see Figure 1) due to the Hive cryptocurrency
price surge during this time [13]. The figure also shows a complex
pattern of average reward in the Hive network and suggests further
studies to understand how reward can affect users’ behaviors in
the decentralized social network. Such research can open a new
direction to improve existing centralized social networks.
5.2.2 Network Analysis. One of the outstanding advantages of a
blockchain-based social network is information transparency. For
instance, building networks of subscribers with the communities or
authors with readers or followers with followings can be exploited
instantly from the public data of the blockchain. In contrast, in

most influential communities in the Hive decentralized network in
this period, including LeoFinance(#hive-167922), one of the largest
crypto and finance content communities, GEMS(#hive-148441), a
community with a wide range of topics from lifestyle, cooking, and
food hobby to history and philosophy in many different languages,

5.2.3 Comparison with Available Hive Statistics Analysis. There
are minor differences between the statistics reported in Figures 1

penguinpablo in PeakD [28] andHive.blog [19]. However, we present
monthly statistics in this paper, while the existing statistics reports
include daily and weekly statistics. This may cause data mismatch
misconception, but our investigations do not indicate significant
differences.

5.3 Splinterlands - A Hive-based decentralized
card game
Splinterlands is a collectible card game that leverages the power
of Hive blockchain in storing all of its information. This is the
principal technical difference of Splinterlands compared to the other
blockchain-based games. For example, Gods Unchained, another
collectible card game built upon Ethereum, stores only the players’
assets and purchases information in blockchain while the rest, e.g.,
the battle result, is stored on the game publisher servers. Table 4
shows Splinterlands’s overall statistics, which clearly indicates its
popularity.

Table 3: Top influential communities based on networks
of active communities and their new subscribers on Hive
blockchain in 2021.
Gameplay: After signing up for the game, each new player can
select numerous cards to start battles. Each card’s properties fall
into four categories: (i) Rarities determine how rare the card is.
There are four levels of rarities: common, rare, epic, and legendary.
(ii) Each card has seven stats: Mana cost, Speed, Armor, Health and
Attach including Melee, Ranged, and Magic. (iii) Fire, Earth, Water,
Life, Death, Dragon, and Neutral define the faction of this card.
(iv) Each card has more than 46 abilities to increase the fun and
randomness of battles. Before a battle between two players, each
player is provided with a fixed amount of mana, and each player
chooses the same number of cards to organize on the battlefield.
The result of the battle is determined by position, strength, cards’
ability, and some randomness injected by the system. There are
three types of battle: ranked, practiced, and friendly matches. The
last two do not affect the ranking of players. The players’ cards can
be traded with other ones.
Data Analysis: Each blockchain transaction records an action
that happened in the game. We can cluster these actions into the

following four categories. Table 4 represents some notable activities
for each category:
(1) Account-related actions: Some example operators in this cat-
egory are rewarded with more than 36 million transactions,
while upgrade account operator has more than 626K trans-
actions on the Hive blockchain, and adding wallet is nearly
480K operators.
(2) Battle actions: It contains activities related to a battle, e.g.,
players of a battle, each player’s order of card deck in the
match, the battle result, and the battle type. Some examples
include more than 178 million match-finding transactions,
where users have played nearly 2.5 million matches.
(3) Asset actions: It is the card information that each player has.
So, for example, players can destroy cards, which they do
not want to use. According to Hive transactions, there are
314 thousand actions recorded on the system. Lock asset is
also done more than 92K times.
(4) Purchase actions: Since the game allows its players to buy,
sell, or transfer their assets, all transactions are stored in
the blockchain to avoid manipulation, even from the game
publisher side. As stated in Table 4, around 4.5 million trans-
actions are related to the users’ card selling activities. It
expresses the users’ high trading activities in this game.
5.4 NFTShowroom
NFTShowroom is a marketplace for artists selling their digital art.
The platform associates each digital art with a unique Non-Fungible
Token (NFT). Since Hive blockchain is not designed as a decentral-
ized computational system as Ethereum or EOS.IO, a smart con-
tracts side-chain layer called Hive Engine is used to issue token
SWAP.HIVE of NFTShowroom. Then, the ownership of the artwork
can be verified employing the Hive Engine smart contracts, and the
primary layer of the Hive blockchain is leveraged for the verifica-
tion in the case of NFTShowroom. Moreover, the purchase history
of the digital art is trackable via the transactions created on the
Hive Engine nodes before automatically sending them to the Hive
main chain. When digital art is transferred, sold, or bought, the
Resource Track Paper  SIGIR ’22, July 11–15, 2022, Madrid, Spain
3044
transactions are recorded in the Hive blockchain. This information
is publicly transparent and could be verified by other users.
Till end of January 2022, NFTShowroom consists of more than
11,866 artworks sold. On average, ten artworks are purchased
through the system every day. Based on our dataset, the total num-
ber of NFTShowroom tokens minted is 45,961, and such number is
increasing over time because of its rapid development.
6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we presented SoChainDB, a framework to crawl
blockchain-based social networks. Its robust and general architec-
ture can handle various kinds of blockchain systems. Along with
our system, we provide the public dataset of Hive - one of the largest
blockchain social networks. We also discussed and released the data
of Splinterlands, a collectible decentralized card game, and NFT-
Showroom, a platform for purchasing the ownership of digital arts,
both built upon Hive blockchain technology. All data presented in
this paper is ready and accessible via our website through a RESTful
API service or archival data files. As future work, several research di-
rections on information retrieval might fit this blockchain-powered
social network database:
• Massive Scale Social Network Analytics: With more than 100
GB of post-processed data, SoChainDB allows for large-scale
combined analysis of social networks’ various aspects or
topics. Thus, along with common social networking factors,
extensive research can exploit the unique blockchain char-
acteristics such as users’ motivation to contribute highly-
rated content through the built-in crypto-tokens and rewards
mechanisms to explore the impact of articles. Hence, the
assessments could be more comprehensive than similar ap-
proaches on the regular social network data.
• Cross-domain Behavior Analytics: Since we can obtain the en-
tire Hive data, we could use the data to answer different basic
questions related to the behavior of users across services. For
example, game players could use social network platforms
to publicize their achievements and build friendships with
other players. Such activities allow us to understand users’
behaviors in various domains and build a more accurate
recommender system that offers helpful information.
• Impact of Reward on User Engagement: The reward system is
a unique feature of blockchain-based social networks. Under-
standing the causality between earning and user activities
in social networks can open a direction to redesign existing
social networks toward offering a better user experience.
