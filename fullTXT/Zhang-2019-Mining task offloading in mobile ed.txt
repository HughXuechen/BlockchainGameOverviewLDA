Abstract—Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger to cap-
ture and record economic transactions of mobile applications.
In blockchain operation process, mining tasks play a key role
and pose intensive computation demands on resource constrained
mobile devices. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising
solution to alleviate the heavy burden on the devices through task
offloading. Since only the miner device that first obtains a block
can get rewards, there are risks of the devices for consuming edge
computing resources without any profit. However, traditional
task offloading schemes that purely rely on expected utilities
of the devices always ignore the difference of various devices in
balancing risks and rewards, thus make the offloading inefficient.
To address this problem, we adopt a prospect theoretic approach
to design an optimal offloading scheme for MEC-empowered
blockchain, where diverse preferences of devices for profits and
risks are explicitly taken into account. Specifically, we formulate
the offloading process as a Stackelberg game that incorporates
notions from prospect theory. We design an efficient algorithm
to obtain the optimal offloading strategies, which maximize the
utilities of both the miner devices and the MEC service providers.
Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of
the proposed offloading schemes.
I. INTRODUCTION
Global financial economy, enabled by advancement of dig-
ital transactions and Internet of Things (IoT), has witnessed
a great change in the last decades, where electronic trading
has turned market from human intermediation to computer
processing [1]. In this financial service migration, a reliable
and flexible trading platform is critically required for efficient
business control [2].
To meet this requirement, blockchain, a public ledger of
various types of transactions, has been introduced [3]. In
blockchain, transactions are recorded and confirmed in the
absence of a central authority, which can greatly reduce costs
in record keeping and trading. The core issue of blockchain is
mining, which is a computational process requiring intensive
computing resources. Although blockchain is ubiquitous in
various sorts of commercial services, it has not been widely
spread to mobile applications due to the constrained computing
power of mobile devices. Thus, it is a critical challenge for
deploying blockchain in mobile environments.
Mobile edge computing (MEC), which pushes cloud service
to access networks and provides computing services in proxim-
ity to consumers, is becoming a promising enabler for mobile
blockchain [4]. With the aid of MEC technology, mining
process of the mobile devices can be offloaded to edge servers
and executed with improved QoS and reduced latency [5].
The miner device that first completes the mining process and
successfully adds transaction records into blockchains receives
mining rewards. To win the speed game among the other
participants, a miner may require a large amount of computing
resources of MEC servers while paying high cost to the service
providers.
A few works have been carried out focusing on MEC
empowered blockchain. In [6], the authors introduced a secure
architecture of vehicular networks, where an edge computing
layer offloads computational intensive tasks of blockchain
transactions. In [7], the authors proposed an auction-based
edge resource allocation mechanism for edge servers that
provide computation capabilities for mobile blockchain. In
[8], the authors developed a deep learning inspired optimal
edge resource allocation scheme in blockchain context. In [9],
the authors designed a low-complexity alternating direction
method to schedule computation offloading for blockchain
applications.
In the above works, the authors always took the assumption
that the utility obtained from edge computation is definite and
the owners of mobile devices are entirely rational. However,
as there is competition between multiple mobile devices in the
mining process, uncertainty is involved for a device winning
the mining reward. Considering the owners of various mobile
devices have different preference toward the trade-off between
risk and reward, aforementioned classical computation of-
floading strategies that ignore the distinction between these
preferences, are insufficient to accurately schedule offloading
resources.
To address the problem, we utilize prospect theory, which
is a behavioral economics theory that describes the way that
people choose between alternative strategies involving risks
and uncertain outcomes. In this paper, we formulate edge
computation management for blockchain in a prospect theory
perspective, and proposed an optimal mining task offloading
scheme through an incentive approach. The main contribution
of this paper are listed below:
• We propose a new MEC mechanism for blockchain

mining tasks in a prospect theoretic approach, where
the different preferences of mobile device owners for
competitive risks and profits are considered.
• We formulate the mining task offloading as a Stackelberg
game, and develop an incentive scheme for the mobile
devices in mining task selection and edge computing
resource assignment.
• We design an efficient task offloading algorithm, which
maximizes the utilities of the mobile devices in mining
process, while greatly improving the revenue of the MEC
service providers.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system
model is presented in Section II. In Section III, we formulate
a blockchain computation offloading problem between mobile
devices and MEC servers in a Stackelberg game theoretic
approach, and prove the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium.
In Section IV, we propose an optimal task offloading scheme.
We present numerical results in Section V and conclude the
paper in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Figure 1 shows our proposed MEC-empowered mobile
blockchain system. We consider that there are M blockchain
mining tasks. An task can be described in two terms as
Aj = {xj , sj}, j ∈ M = {1, 2, ...,M}. Here xj is the amount
of the computation required to solve the problem of task j,
and sj is block size of this task. In the system, N mobile
devices act as miners to process the task and record generated
transactions in a blockchain. A device can perform computa-
tion task on itself. The computing capacity of device i is bi,
where i ∈ N = {1, 2, ..., N}. In addition, these devices have
different transmission capacities that may affect the efficiency
of computation result propagation among blockchain devices.
ri is the parameter that reveals the data propagation capability
of device i. There are G MEC servers equipped proximate
to the mobile devices, which act as computing resources to
offload and implement tasks of the devices. The computing
capacity of each MEC server is {w1, w2, ..., wG}, respectively.
A successful mining process always consists of two steps,
namely the computation step and the propagation step. In the
computation step, a block is obtained through solving the
proof-of-work puzzle of a chosen task. In the next step, the
newly mined block needs to be propagated to other miners and
be verified as a consensus. Correspondingly, the total mining
time can be divided into two parts, i.e., computation time and
propagation time. For a given mining task, its computation
time mainly depends on the amount of computing resources
spent on solving the problem, while the propagation time is
related to its block size and device’s propagation capability
[10]. As the propagation capability of each mobile device
is determined, the competition between the miner devices
that choose a same mining tasks focuses on reducing their
computation time through using powerful computing resources
[11]. Let di,j,k denote the amount of computing resources that
device i takes from MEC server k for implementing task j.
The probability that device i wins the mining competition in
the N devices can be calculated as
Pi,j =
hi,jα
−xj/(
∑G
k=1 di,j,k+bi)−sj/ri∑N
v=1 hv,jα−xj/(
∑G
k=1 dv,j,k+bv)−sj/rv
, (1)
where α is a coefficient, and α > 1.
Let ej be the reward of task j given to the winner of the
mobile devices involved in implementing the task, and ck
denote the price charged for a device using an unit computing
resource from MEC server k. Then, we define the expected
utility gained by device i in the competition to solve task j as
gi =
∑M
j=1
hi,j(Pi,jej −
∑G
k=1
di,j,kck), (2)
where hi,j is an indicator function. hi,j = 1 means device i
chooses task j, and hi,j = 0, otherwise. We consider that each
device can only choose to implement one task at most.
When a mobile device assesses the effectiveness of mining
task selection and computing resource consumption, device
owner’s economical preference needs to be taken into account.
Thus, we turn to prospect theory, which reveals the differ-
ence between real-life decision making and the scheduling
strategies that purely rely on expected utilities. In a prospect
theoretic approach, decision makers consider their prospects
through a function that values outcomes relative to a reference
point. Here we set the reference point as zero utility value, and
define the prospect theory inspired utility as
Ui =
{
gi
γi , if gi � 0
−λi(−gi)
ζi , if gi < 0
, (3)
where γi, ζi and λi are device i’s prospect parameters. 0 <
γi, ζi < 1 and λi > 1.
We consider that the MEC servers are managed by different
operators, who earn utilities by selling computing services
to the mobile devices [12]. The utility of server k obtained
through providing d units of computing resources to the
devices is given as
Rk = d(ck − ηk), (4)
where ηk is operating cost of unit computing resources. In
the MEC-enabled mobile blockchain system, both computing
service providers and subscribers, i.e., the MEC servers and
the mobile devices intend to maximize their utilities.

III. STACKELBERG GAME THEORETIC MINING TASK
OFFLOADING
As the miner device that first completes a mining task
can obtain a reward, there emerges a competition between
the mobile devices in improving their computation speed
through task offloading. However, the computing capacity of
the deployed MEC servers is still limited, especially in the case
where few servers serving a large number of miner devices.
Thus, competitions for choosing the offloading servers and
utilizing edge computing resources may be incurred among
the devices. In (2), the expected utilities of mobile devices are
affected by resource price set {ck}. Motivated by a pricing
scheme, the devices need to adjust offloading strategies that
maximize their utilities, and the devices are indirectly coupled
through the resource price.
On the MEC server side, the servers aim to earn utilities
through selling computing service to mobile devices. As
computing resources are homogeneous, a device can buy them
from any available server. These servers are involved in a
serving competition, and also indirectly coupled through price
set {ck} in the offloading process.
The mining competition between mobile devices and the
serving competition between MEC servers can be modeled
as a game, respectively. Furthermore, considering that the
offloading strategies chosen by the devices are response to
the resource prices advertised by the servers, we formulate the
operation of MEC-enabled blockchain system as a Stackelberg
game, where the servers act as leaders and the devices are
followers [13]. In the following, we present the composition
and characteristics of the Stackelberg game in both device side
and server side.
A. Mobile Device Side Analysis
In the mobile device side, each device aims to maximize its
utility. The objective function of device i is shown as
max
{hi,j ,di,j,k}
Ui

i=1
∑M
j=1

hi,j = {0, 1}, i ∈ N , j ∈ M∑M

hi,j = 1, i ∈ N
. (5)
In (5), the first constraint indicates that the computing resource
allocated to the mobile devices should not exceed the max-
imum capacity of each MEC server. The second and third
constraints show that a device can only select one task to
execute.
As task offloading strategies of the mobile devices not
only depend on their selected mining tasks, but also on the
offloading decisions of the other devices, non-cooperative
game is an appealing approach to model the offloading process
in this context. In this game, the players are the mobile devices
{N}. For device i, i ∈ N , its strategy set consists of two
parts, namely mining task selection hi,j and the amount of
taken resources di,j,k. We denote the strategy set of device i
as si = {hi,j , di,j,k}, and the strategies of all devices other
than device i as s−i. Then, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The task offloading game between the mobile de-
vices is a concave multi-player game, and a Nash Equilibrium
exists for the game.
Proof. The constraints of (5) indicate that a device needs to
choose one mining task. For device i, we consider hi,j = 1.
According to (2), the second-order partial derivative of func-
tion gi with respect to di,j,k is shown as
gi
′′ =

and B = −xj/(di,j,k +
∑G
g �=k,g=1 di,j,g + bi) − sj/ri.
Given offloading strategy s−i, A is a constant. As
B is a function of di,j,k, we find that B′ > 0,
B′′ < 0 and |B′′| <
∣∣∣(B′)2
∣∣∣. Thus, in the second
case of (6), there is gi
′′ = ejα
BA ln(α)[ln(α)(A2 −

BA ln(α) |B′′| [A2(ln(α) −
1)− ln(α)α2B − α2B − 2αBA]/(αB +A)4 ≤ 0.
Next, we calculate the second-order partial derivative of
device i’s utility function Ui with respect to di,j,k. The
calculation process takes in two cases. In the first case, we
consider gi ≥ 0, and we get

. (7)
Since 0 < γi < 1, γigi
γi−2(γi − 1)(−ck)
2 < 0.
In addition, as we have proved gi
′′ ≤ 0, in (7),
γigi
γi−2(γi − 1)(gi
′)2 + γigi
γi−1gi
′′ < 0. Thus,
we get that when gi ≥ 0, ∂2Ui

∂Ui
∂di,j,k
> 0. The above two inequalities and
∂2Ui
∂di,j,k
2 < 0 show that the utility function Ui first gradually
increases and then continuously decreases with di,j,k. Thus,
Ui is a strictly concave function when gi ≥ 0. In the other
case where gi < 0, the utility function of Ui can be proved as
strict convex in terms of variable di,j,k in a similar approach.
Furthermore, we find that this convex property holds for
all the mobile devices offloading mining tasks to the MEC
servers. Therefore, the task offloading game between the
mobile devices is a strictly concave multi-player game that
has a Nash equilibrium.
B. MEC Server Side Analysis
Being offloading service providers, the MEC servers intent
to make more profit through the game of selling computing

adjust the resource price set {ck}. For server k, k ∈ G, its
objective function can be presented as
max
{ck}
Rk = (ck − ηk)
∑N
i=1
∑M
j=1 di,j,k
s.t. ck > ηk
. (8)
The constraint of (8) indicates that being a rational service
provider, server k dose not set ck less than its operation cost
ηk. Next we discuss the upper limit of ck, and present the
following lemma.
Lemma 1. For MEC server k, k ∈ G, there exists an upper
limit of its resource selling price ck, which is denoted as cmax
k .
Proof. At first, we get the offloading strategies of mobile
devices corresponding to given price ck. According to (5)
and using a Lagrangian multiplier approach, we have L =

v �=i,v=1
∑M
m �=j,m=1 hv,mdv,m,k − wk) = 0, where μ1 > 0
and di,j,k ≥ 0. By solving ∂L
∂di,j,k

γi−1gi
′−μ1 = 0, the
optimal offloading strategy di,j,k is obtained. Then we get

In this proof, we focus on the case where ∃v �=

be given similarly. In the case that we focus on, there
is gi

γi−1
(I2−ck) −
(G− ck). When I1 − ckdi,j,k = 1, f(ck) = I2 − G <
0. The derivative function of f is expressed as f ′(ck) =
(I1 − ckdi,j,k)
γi−2
(di,j,k (1− γi) I2 − I1 + ckdi,j,kγi) + 1.
When f ′(ck) > 0, there exists an upper limit cmax
k that
ensures f(ck) < 0. In another case, when f ′(ck) ≤ 0, we
find f ′′(ck) > 0 and f is a concave function. Upper limit of
ck exists to make f(ck) < 0 true.
If 0 ≤ gi < 1, considering 0 < γi < 1,
there is gi
γi−1 ≤ gi

γi−1gi
′ =

−1, where D =
Pi,jej − ∑G
g �=k,g=1 cgdi,j,g > 0. As di,j,k ≥ 0, we have
D(I1 − ckd)
γi−1
(I2−ck) − (G− ck) ≥ 0. Let f2(ck) =
D(I1 − ckd)
γi−1
(I2−ck) − (G− ck). Keeping di,j,k ≥ 0
requires that f2(ck) ≥ 0. The derivative function of f2 is
f2
′(ck) = D(I1 − ckd)
γi−2
(d (1− γi) I2 − I1 + ckdγi) + 1.
As f ′′
2 (ck) > 0, f2(ck) is a concave function. In addition,
since 0 ≤ gi < 1, there is (D − 1)/di,j,k ≤ ck ≤ D/di,j,k.
Thus, to ensure f2(ck) ≥ 0, upper limit cmax
k exists for the
resource price.
According to Lemma 1, we find that the value of ck is in a
constrained range, and present the following theorem.
Theorem 2. The offloading serving game between the MEC
servers possesses a Nash equilibrium.
Proof. For MEC server k, k ∈ G, its price strategy ck ∈
{0, cmax
k }. Thus, the strategy space of all these servers can
be proved an nonempty, convex and compact set. In addition,
from (8), we find that the utility function of MEC server k is
continuous and quasi-concave in terms of ck. Thus the game
has a Nash equilibrium.
C. Stackelberg Equilibrium
In our proposed Stackelberg game theoretic offloading pro-
cess, the MEC servers act as leaders, that set and announce
their computing resource price. The miner devices, which act
as followers, response to the price through choosing target
servers and adjusting resource consumption. The strategies
of the device i can be presented as functions in terms of
the resource price, i.e., si = {hi,j(ck, c−k), di,j,k(ck, c−k)},
where c−k is the price set of the MEC servers other than
server k. When the offloading game reaches Stackelberg
equilibrium, the strategies of the players should satisfy the
following inequalities.⎧⎪⎪⎨

According to Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, the mining task
offloading game between devices and the computing serving
game between MEC servers have Nash equilibrium, respec-
tively. Therefore, there exists a equilibrium of the Stackelberg
game.
IV. PROSPECT THEORETIC OPTIMAL OFFLOADING
ALGORITHM
In the MEC-empowered blockchain system, various MEC
servers and mobile devices may be owned and managed
by different operators and users, respectively. It is suitable
to adjust the offloading strategy of each server or a de-
vice in a distributed manner. Moreover, Stackelberg game is
characterized in a leader-follower operation mode. Following
this consideration, the designed optimal offloading algorithm
consists of two parts, namely the MEC servers’ resource price
determination and the miner devices’ resource consumption
decision. The servers determine the price at first, and then the
devices dynamically react to the price and select the optimal

offloading strategies. After getting the response of the device,
the servers adjust their price and announce it to the users. The
offloading system operates in iterative mode, until it reaches
Stackelberg equilibrium. The details of the proposed optimal
offloading algorithm are illustrated in Algorithm 1.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
prospect theoretic optimal offloading algorithm. We consider
20 mobile devices with various prospect characteristics act as
block miners in the system, whose computing capacities are
randomly taken from (100, 300) units. An edge computing
network that consists of 5 MEC servers locates proximate
to the devices. The computing capacities of these servers
are uniformly distributed in (1000, 1500) units. The number
of generated blockchain mining tasks is 10, and the tasks’
computation requirements and block size are randomly chosen
from (50000, 100000) units and (300, 500) Mb, respectively.
Fig. 2 compares the gained utilities of the mobile devices
with different offloading schemes. In both cases with various
average computing requirements of the mining tasks, our
proposed prospect theoretic schemes have higher utilities than
the game-based schemes without considering the economical
characteristics of device owners. In practical scenarios, the
owners always have different preferences toward revenues
and risks. Ignoring these features may result in inefficient
offloading strategies that blindly pursue rewards but ignore
potential risks, and thus lead to low utilities. From Fig. 2,

we further find that the difference of the gained utilities with
and without using prospect theory becomes greater with the
increasing number of mobile devices. A large number of
devices leads to intensive competition. In this case, the devices
are prone to competition failure, and the effects of the prospect
theory in offloading strategy design is obvious.
Fig. 3 presents the total utilities of the devices with differ-
ent number of mining tasks and various device propagation
capabilities. We can see that higher propagation capability
r brings more gained utility. As higher r results in less
block propagation time, devices can consume less computing
resources for block mining. Resource savings lead to the
increased utilities. Moreover, we find that as the number of
tasks increases, the gained utility raises up. For a given number
of mobile devices, more tasks means less competition between
the miners, and that a device has a greater probability of
winning the reward. It is noteworthy that sudden increases
of the utilities appear when the number of tasks is 4 in both
cases with different r. The reason is that compared to the other
mining tasks used in this simulation, the newly generated 4
tasks require less computing resources. Thus, the devices take
few resources to accomplish these tasks, and make high utility.
Fig. 4 shows the effects of prospect parameter γ on the
gained utility of a selected mobile device with different task
computation requirements. γi indicates the profit-seeking de-

gree of device i. We can see that for a given task requirement,
higher γi makes device i take more resources for increasing the
probability of winning the mining competition, and gain higher
utility. In addition, we find that the difference of the gained
unities with different γi is getting smaller as task computation
requirement increases. The reason is that a mining task with
intensive computation leads to high resource consumption that
decreases the net profit of the winner device. Consequently, the
effects of γi becomes weak.
Fig. 5 presents the pricing strategies of the MEC servers
with various computing capabilities and different number of
competing servers. For selected server k, its resource price
greatly reduces when there is a large number of competing
MEC servers in the offloading system. Computing capability
wk also affects the price of server k. With larger wk, the
server is more inclined to sell all of its resources at a reduced
price and gain higher profit. We further find that the difference
of the chosen price with various wk becomes less when the
number of MEC servers increases. This can be explained as
follows. With the increasing number of servers, more available
computing resources are provided in the offloading system.
The impact of the resource increase of single server k on
the serving competition turns weak. Therefore, the difference
between the price gets less.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated mobile edge computing for
blockchain mining tasks in a prospect perspective. By leverag-
ing a Stackelberg theoretic approach, we formulated the com-
puting resource pricing and consumption as coupled leader-
follower games. We further proved the existence of Nash
equilibrium of the games and proposed an efficient mining
task offloading algorithm. Numerical results demonstrated the
improved utilities of our proposed schemes.
