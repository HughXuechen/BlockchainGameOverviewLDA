As an object of rapid development of Internet technology in recent years, network security has attracted more and more attention
from people from all walks of life and has gradually become a topic in international trade activities. �e application of blockchain
is also extremely extensive, involving many aspects, such as the development of the metaverse game engine and bank �nancing.
With the launch of the Belt and Road strategy, trade exchanges have becomemore andmore frequent, and at the same time, cross-
border e-commerce, a new type of industry that applies Internet information technology, has emerged. �e application of
blockchain technology to international trade big data processing can not only improve the utilization rate of massive transaction
information resources shared by enterprises, governments, �nancial institutions, and other institutions, but also reduce enterprise
costs. �e use of blockchain improves the e�ciency of data storage, reduces the degree of encryption, and reduces the amount of
database access and server resource occupation.�is paper mainly studied the application of blockchain in international trade big
data system, introduced its secure and trusted distributed network architecture, and analyzed its performance. �e experimental
results showed that the performance of the decentralized manager was better than that of the centralized manager when
processing a large amount of data. �e peak throughput of the decentralized manager was about 450 pcs/sec and the peak
throughput of the centralized manager was about 150 pcs/sec. And the performance of the storage system in the local area network
was better than that in the public network.
1. Introduction
Since the beginning of the twenty-�rst century, the Internet
has entered the lives of the public at an unimaginable speed.
Data has been growing rapidly, andmankind has entered the
era of big data. In the context of big data, the inherent or
potential value of data itself has become an important asset.
Raw data is generally considered to be unprocessed or re-
duced data that constitutes physically present data. What
people most often come into contact with in their daily life is
the evolution of raw data, which has undergone a series of
processing. At the same time, people are unknown to the
source of this data, and they cannot judge its security and
reliability. �is also gives many criminals an opportunity to
take advantage. If the advanced and reliable encryption
algorithm (LSS) is used to realize the isolation and
protection of massive data, it has become the top priority,
and it also provides the digital virtual world with a feature of
high security, strong reliability, and scalability. With the
continuous improvement of network communication
standard system requirements in the �eld of Internet
technology and information security, a more credible
blockchain alliance is proposed in this case. �e purpose of
the Global Blockchain Alliance is to promote the self-dis-
cipline of the global blockchain industry, promote the re-
search and application development of global blockchain
technology, build industry standards for the blockchain
industry, drive the deep integration of blockchain and
various economic and social �elds, and jointly promote the
healthy development of the blockchain industry.
International trade has various and complex charac-
teristics. A trade integrates many roles, such as

manufacturers, customs, logistics, and end customers, and
links the market demands of various countries to form an
international market. 'erefore, international trade is very
fragmented and chaotic. 'e reason for the low efficiency of
international trade is the lack of application of modern
information technology. Blockchain is an open distributed
storage system that integrates all key links that may occur or
already exist, such as data sharing and access control, on a
new server. A distributed system maintains a shared, public
ledger of transactions. A series of transaction information
data is stored in a block, each block is associated with the
hash value of the previous block, and this series of blocks
forms a blockchain. Due to the existence of the hash value in
the transaction block, the associated transaction block
cannot be manipulated without breaking the connection
between the blocks. 'erefore the blockchain and its dis-
tributed ledger are immutable, which makes all transactions
transparent and trackable. In addition, blockchain tech-
nology can also realize direct communication between
companies or individuals. 'is technology is decentralized
and has good fault tolerance. No company or individual can
unilaterally manipulate or modify the ledger, and blockchain
technology is also considered safe.'erefore, the application
of blockchain technology to the construction of interna-
tional trade management systems can solve its security
problems.
International trade is about not only whether a company
is strong, but also whether a country is prosperous, so in-
ternational trade has always been the focus of international
scholars. Akerman [1] analyzed the leading role played by
wholesalers and other intermediaries in international trade
and gave corresponding management suggestions [1].
Niepmann and Schmidt-Eisenlohr [2] studied the significant
risks faced by international trade exporters and importers
during the financial crisis and provided their own views on
how to apply letters of credit to the risks [2]. Alvarez [3]
proposed to introduce the Eaton-Kortum model into in-
ternational trade, aiming to use this model to evaluate the
short-term and long-term benefits brought by the elimi-
nation of global trade tariffs [3]. Sopranzetti [4] analyzed the
impact of free trade agreements on international trade and
concluded that signing free trade agreements with each
country was not the best strategy to increase trade volume
[4]. McCalman [5] studied the relationship between income
distribution and international integration in the trade en-
vironment and showed that when income distribution was
different, it affected the gains from trade within and between
countries [5]. Broll and Mukherjee [6] studied the optimal
production and trade decisions of international firms facing
uncertainty due to exchange rate fluctuations under mean-
variance preference [6]. 'e above research lacks some
experimental data to prove that it lacks convincing.
'erefore, it is necessary to study it in combination with
experimental data.
In view of the lack of experimental data in the above-
mentioned research on international trade, this article adapt
the in-depth topic of blockchain on international trade to
build a secure and reliable distributed big data management
system and proved its feasibility. International scholars have
also conducted a lot of research on blockchain and dis-
tributed big data management systems. Chen [7] applied the
blockchain to the personnel file information management
system, which effectively solved many problems in tradi-
tional file management [7]. Chen [8] and his team pointed
out the limitations of existing blockchain frameworks that
hinder their widespread adoption in the business world and
proposed a cryptographic sharing scheme [8]. Zhang and
Zhang [9] proposed the use of blockchain to improve the
utilization of agricultural big data and solve the problem of
multisource data fusion [9]. Zhang [10] improved the
blockchain communication technology, the main purpose of
which was to optimize the efficiency of blockchain data
transmission [10]. Kumar and Rahman [11] proposed a
metadata blockchain distribution system, which was mainly
used for distributed and massively parallel processing of big
data [11]. Rassenfoss [12] explored the use of blockchain in
business and proposed a system that can automatically track
oil and gas costs and oilfield transportation costs [12]. Most
of the above studies are the application of blockchain
technology, which shows the extensive application of
blockchain. 'is further proves the feasibility of the research
proposed in this paper.
'is paper mainly starts with some existing problems in
international trade and proposes a method for designing and
verifying a distributed management system for international
trade based on blockchain technology. Due to the intricate
complexity of international trade, analysis and comparison
of experiments are carried out from each module of the
system, and experimental conclusions are drawn.
2. Design of Secure and Trusted Distributed
Management System
2.1. Overview of Blockchain and International Trade. 'e
bottleneck in international trade is the complex and slow
approval process involving multiple banks and intermedi-
aries. For example, the normal import and export materials
approval is about 30 days, and the time for preparing the
approval materials in the early stage is not included. Due to
the time-consuming nature of these processes, payments and
shipments are regularly delayed. In addition, due to infor-
mation asymmetry between trading partners from different
regions and economic environments, they are vulnerable to
fraud during the transaction process. International trade
lacks transparency and is highly ambiguous, requiring ex-
tensive control and monitoring, while a complex environ-
ment adds to cost pressures. Logistics is an important part of
international trade, and freight volume is also the biggest
factor affecting international trade volume [13]. Logistics
pays more attention to the physical transportation of goods,
while supply chain pays more attention to the management
of the overall flow of goods. 'e difficulty of goods flow
management is that there is a large amount of data and order
information to be processed.
It is the various issues involved in international trade
that provide a lot of opportunities for blockchain technol-
ogy. 'is technology has the potential to disrupt many
industries. Blockchain is an open distributed ledger that
2 Mobile Information Systems
records transactions securely, permanently, and efficiently
[14]. Blockchain opportunities and benefits include lower IT
costs, higher data quality, greater transparency, faster
business processes, lower process overhead costs, and im-
proved collaboration. 'e blockchain network does not rely
on the feature of central equipment, so big data can be
transferred to cloud platforms or other information
equipment. Even if there is a natural disaster, only the
equipment will be affected. 'e establishment of such a
system takes the government agency as the leading agency,
the information is open and transparent, and the terminal is
opened to the enterprise to replace the expensive data center,
and the enterprise can also save a lot of budget. Each block in
the blockchain is linked to the hash value of the previous
block. Blockchain is the first distributed record system with
its own trust mechanism and is also a decentralized data
storage model [15]. 'e structure of each block is shown in
Figure 1.
2.2. Design of Distributed International Trade Big Data
Management System. 'e blockchain integrates asymmetric
encryption technology, smart contracts, and distributed
systems, which originally originated from Bitcoin [16].
Blockchain technology also has disadvantages. 'e waste of
computing resources in the current blockchain technology is
mainly caused by the repeated operations of computers to
compete for new blocks. Blockchain data occupies too much
storage space. Due to the distributed storage characteristics
of blockchain technology, any computer node that joins the
blockchain network needs to synchronize the full amount of
blockchain data. 'e core of blockchain technology is a
protocol to achieve distributed consensus [17].
To avoid the above drawbacks, an effective blockchain
model needs to be designed. Distributed data and blockchain
technology are built on smart contracts between responsive
executors [18]. It is of great research significance to improve
and overcome the abovementioned shortcomings of existing
blockchain technology.
As shown in Figure 2, each database in the database layer
corresponds to a blockchain network, and many blockchain
networks form a blockchain system.'e system is connected
to the cloud data sharing module and can be independently
divided into blockchain nodes. 'e blockchain node is
connected to the node server. After the node server is
encrypted, the encrypted database can be decomposed into
different data and presented to the server.
2.2.1. Computing System. 'e computing system computes
the data through task distribution and aggregation. Each
computing node has two states: distribution state and
computing state. 'e computing node actively initiates a
distributed calculation and enters the distribution state,
dividing the relatively large calculation into multiple com-
puting tasks. 'en other computing nodes receive in-
structions to perform computations, that is, computation
states. Its flowchart is shown in Figure 3.
2.2.2. Storage System. 'e storage system is mainly re-
sponsible for the storage and output of data and establishes
new blocks for the data results from the computing system.
Its structure diagram is shown in Figure 4.
'e blockchain storage area stores two complete
blockchains, namely, the calculation result blockchain and
the transaction blockchain. Calculation results of the
blockchain contain all the calculation results completed by
the computing network. 'e transaction blockchain is the
user’s free transaction or the corresponding transaction
generated by the block in the blockchain based on the
calculation result. For the calculation result block unit of
each task contained in the calculation result block, there
must be a corresponding block unit in the transaction block.
All of these storage nodes will execute the same proof-of-
work algorithm at the same time as long as there is data
stored in the block-unit staging area. Only the first storage
node that completes the above steps is eligible to generate
new blocks, and the algorithm of proof-of-work is cus-
tomized by the blockchain user.
2.2.3. Trading System. Each transaction in the transaction
system structure includes a transaction head and has mul-
tiple inputs and multiple outputs at the same time, as shown
in Figure 5.
Every input in a transaction is an output of another
transaction, and these outputs contain all the available
outputs of the originator. Each output contains the output’s
transaction status, transaction amount, lock script, and
recipient. 'e transaction status indicates whether the
transaction is available or not.'e transaction status has two
values, 0 and 1. 1 means available and 0 means unavailable.
Recipient is the address of the recipient of this output. A lock
script is the “lock” for the transaction: if the lock script exists,
the transaction is available; otherwise it is unavailable. 'e
lock script is the transaction amount encrypted with the
receiver’s public key, and only the receiver’s private key can
unlock the script.
Assuming that the transaction amount is B, the receiver’s
public key is KQ, the receiver’s key is KT, the lock script is
lock, and the transaction status is V, the locked script can be
expressed as formula (1):
lock �
RSAEncrypt(B, KQ), V � 1,
NULL, V � 0.
􏼨 (1)
If the locked script is NULL, the script for locking the
door has been unlocked, and the corresponding output is not
available. 'e transaction status can be expressed as formula
(2):
V �
1, RSADecrypt(lock, KT) � B,
0, RSADecrypt(lock, KT)≠B.
􏼨 (2)
Among them, RSADecrypt stands for RSA decryption.
Each input in a transaction contains the block depth and
transaction number of its corresponding output. 'e block
depth and transaction number can identify unique outputs.
Mobile Information Systems 3
'e transaction header contains the transaction number,
originator, and hash value. 'e transaction number iden-
tifies the position of the transaction in the block, and the
transaction number in each block increases sequentially
from 1. 'e initiator is the public key of the transaction
initiator, which is the unique identifier of the transaction
initiator’s identity. 'e transaction is divided into different
data blocks according to size and stored in different nodes.
When retrieving files, Merkle trees are used to retrieve data
blocks on different nodes [19]. Suppose there are m inputs

and n outputs in a transaction, denoted asA1,A2, . . .,Am and
C1, C2, . . ., Cn, respectively. 'e depth of the block where the
output corresponding to the input is located is D, the
corresponding transaction number is M, and the hash value
is H; then the hash value can be expressed as formula (3):

'e lock script becomes NULL after unlocking and does
not participate in the calculation of the hash value. 'e
transaction status, as an identifier that may change, is only
used to increase the efficiency of the transaction status query
and does not participate in the calculation of the hash value.
'e block header of each transaction block contains the
block depth, block hash, parent block hash, timestamp,
Merkle root, and transaction count. 'e Merkle tree oper-
ation process generally hashes the data of the block body in
groups and inserts the generated new hash value into the
Merkle tree, recursively until only the last root hash value is
left, which is recorded as theMerkle root of the block header.
'e block depth represents the number of the block in the
transaction blockchain. Block hash is a mathematical
summary of the information present in the block. Assuming
that the hash value of the block is Hx, the block contains m
transactions, and the hash values are H1, H2, . . ., Hn, re-
spectively, the hash value of the block can be expressed as
formula (4):
Hx � SHA256 􏽘
m
i�1
Hi( 􏼁⎛⎝ ⎞⎠· (4)
'e block hash is the key to making the blockchain
immutable. 'e calculation of the block hash is encrypted
using SHA256, a one-way irreversible encryption. And any
slight change in the data in the block will cause a dramatic
change in the result of SHA256 encryption. Assuming that
the result type in the calculation result is Ft, the result
number is Fl, the algorithm number is Fc, the initiator is Fs,
there are n subtasks in the calculation result, the number of
each subtask is L, the executor’s public key is K, and the
timestamp is T and the calculation result is F, then the hash
value H of the calculation result can be expressed as formula
(5):
H � SHA256 Ft + Fl + Fc + Fs + 􏽘

'e IP address of the executor in the subtask is only used
as a reference for the node to turn around when the
character is calculated and does not participate in the cal-
culation of the hash value.
2.2.4. Blockchain Distributed Data Access. Data access in-
cludes the transaction ledger of the blockchain, public and
private key encryption, and encrypted hash function [20].
Secure storage of data requires the use of blockchain to store
the IPFS hash address of the provenance data [21]. In the
data upload stage, the data owner first selects the data to be
shared, generates the receiver key KQ to encrypt the data,
and then obtains the encrypted information JM. Policy tree
is a way to store all elements in a hash table [22]. Attribute
permission public key, system parameters, and policy trees
are encrypted with keys, as shown in formulas (6) and (7):
EncryptData(D, KT)⟶ JM, (6)
AuthEncrypt(PK, T, KT, GP)⟶ CI. (7)
'e data owner obtains the metadata data name MData,
the data keyword DKData, the ciphertext request access
policy req_policy according to the data, and the encrypted
information EI, which constitutes the metadata set NIData
and is registered in the data management contract, as shown
in formula (8):
NIData � MData, DKData, EI, reqpolicy}.􏼈 (8)
'e data requester determines the target data acquisition
JM. 'e data requester calls the data request contract to
obtain the encrypted data information EI and requests the
user public key KQ from the attribute agency A and decrypts
to obtain the data key KT, as shown in formula (9):
Decrypt(KQ, EI, GP)⟶ KT
DecryptData(JM, KT)⟶ D
.􏼨 (9)
'e access control mechanism algorithm flow mainly
includes four stages, initialization stage, ciphertext pub-
lishing stage, data request stage, and data decryption stage.
In the early stage of system establishment, it is necessary to
construct anN-stage bilinear group F, whereN� q1q2q3, qi is
a prime number, and k represents a bilinear map. From F,
the generator f of its subgroup Fq1 is obtained. In addition, a
random digest function H is constructed as a user identity
map. 'e initial algorithm of system establishment is shown
in formula (10):
FQ(N, f)⟶ Setup(λ). (10)

In the initialization phase, the attribute authority A calls
the authorization initialization phasemethod and selects two
random indices αi, ci ∈ Zq for each attribute i in the attribute
set U. Taking the public system parameter GP and the at-
tribute space U as input, the authority key KT and the
authority public key KQj are obtained, and the attribute
authority issues the authority public key through the at-
tribute management contract and registers the attribute set

In the ciphertext publishing phase, the policy maker
needs to encrypt the informationN.'e preorder expression
T of the input policy tree is transformed into the LSSS
permission matrix (Cml, ρ). 'e global parameter GP and
the authority public key KQ are used to obtain the infor-
mation ciphertext JM. After the policy maker obtains the
ciphertext of M, it calls the data management contract and
uploads CT to the chain state database. Its expression is as in
formula (12):

request contract to apply to A for JM. First, the data request
contract calls the data management contract to obtain the
dynamic access policy DPData and determines the user’s
authority according to the user’s current dynamic attributes.
ATTR is a user ciphertext request attribute set, which is a
dynamic attribute set. 'e dynamic attribute ATTR refers to
information that changes with time or the location of the
data requester, such as the current access timestamp, the
Internet Protocol address of the current controlled re-
quester, and other dynamic information. 'e expression of
ATTR is as formula (15):

the required test data is given first in the test. 'e test data
has the function of managing the data and the function of the
test data requester requesting the data to see if it meets the
expectations. 'ree different servers are configured and
selected, and the selected configuration must be represen-
tative. 'e configuration selected this time is the computer
configuration used in normal office work. 'e advantage of
this is that there is no need to worry about the configuration
problem affecting the functionality of the system. 'e
specific device configurations of the server and client are
shown in Table 1.
In the functional test, three users need to be registered
for login, and then two attribute organizations are created
and responsible for the corresponding attribute information.
'e specific test data is shown in Table 2.
'is paper uses the identity of one of the ordinary users
to test the data owner management data, and the obtained
test results are shown in Table 3.
From the experimental results, it can be known that the
expected functional effects can be achieved by performing
different operations on the three different management
rights of the data owner.'e purpose of this experiment is to
test whether the management authority of the data owner
can be used normally when the system is running normally,
which also proves the security and indirectness of the system
data mentioned above.
3.2. System Performance Test. 'rough the functional test of
the system, it can be found that the designed system model
can achieve the expected functional effect. Management
systems involve access and user privacy issues between
digital authentication and authorization [23]. 'erefore, in
order to further improve the feasibility of the theory, the
performance test of the system is mainly aimed at the test of
the manager terminal. 'e experiment uses java language to
simulate the client. 'e throughput of the decentralized
authorization manager and the central authorization
manager under the data transaction request volume is
compared. 'e comparison of the experimental results is
shown in Figure 6.
It can be seen from Figure 6 that, with the continuous
increase in the amount of data transaction requests, the
throughput of the decentralized authorization manager
processing data transactions was generally linearly in-
creasing and finally reached a peak value around 450 pcs/sec.
'e overall linearity of the throughput of the central au-
thorization manager processing data transactions was slow
and finally peaked at about 150 pcs/sec. Central authori-
zation manager processing has certain advantages over
decentralized authorization managers. 'e throughput of
the two points is similar when the transaction volume is
small. 'is is because when dealing with a small transaction
volume, the blockchain does not need to perform repeated
calculations to generate new blocks, so the throughput of the
two is similar.
'en the performance of encryption and decryption of
the system was tested. 'e length of the encrypted infor-
mation was fixed, and three attribute mechanisms were

selected in each database. To test the performance of the
encryption/decryption module under different attribute
amounts, five tests were carried out for each attribute or-
ganization and the average value was obtained. 'e test
results are shown in Figure 7.
It can be seen from Figure 7 that the encryption and
decryption time increased with the increase of the number of
attributes. In addition, the attribute amount had a great
influence on the encryption function, and the processing
efficiency of the encryption time was greatly reduced with
the increase of the attribute amount. From the histogram
comparison, it can be seen that the throughput of the en-
cryption function is not very obvious with the increase of the
number of attributes. However, the throughput of the de-
cryption function has increased significantly. 'is is because
when the data is stored in the cloud database, the total
number of terminal servers is less than the total number of
clients, and the encryption process is more complicated and

involves digital identity authentication. And the peak
throughput of the encryption function was about 370 pcs/
sec, and the peak throughput of the decryption function was
about 600 pcs/sec.
Storage modules are at the heart of determining a system
model. 'erefore, the performance test of the storage
module was carried out on the system model to test the
upload and download of data, and the data with the data
volume of 20M, 40M, 200M, and 400M were tested on the
Internet and LAN, respectively. 'e comparison chart of the
experimental results is shown in Figure 8.
From the performance comparison chart of experi-
mental data upload and download, it can be seen that the
data write rate and read rate were basically stable with the
increase of the data volume under the LAN. However, the
efficiency of reading memory in the public network envi-
ronment was gradually declining, and the user’s perfor-
mance bottleneck for data sharing still existed in the data
upload and download parts of the public network envi-
ronment. 'ere was little difference between data writing
and chain code invocation and query time through the
blockchain engine. As the amount of data increased, the time
for data owners to share data and data requesters to request
data increased. If a user downloaded data on the public
network under the same local area network, the rate at which
other users in the local area network download data was
greatly increased. 'erefore, this paper can verify that the
overall performance of the system meets the requirements
for data security sharing of daily life and work data.
4. Conclusions
Blockchain is a disruptive technology whose impact is
comparable to the introduction of the World Wide Web. 'e
technology focuses on the interaction of enterprises and
people, breaking down organizational silos, reducing man-
agement costs, improving communication within companies,
and improving communication among various participants
in international trade. Blockchain technology also establishes
a trustless way of doing business. It improves the overall
efficiency of international trade and can completely replace
middlemen and entire supply chains based on inefficiencies.
'rough experimental verification, it can be found that
blockchain technology can improve data quality, improve
transparency, speed up business processes, and improve
collaboration, with better risk management and better data
security. At the same time, the system model is compared in
differentmodes and in different network environments. It can
be seen that the system performs well in data processing. 'e
decentralized data manager has better processing perfor-
mance, which is several times more efficient than the cen-
tralized manager. 'e decentralized data manager peaks at
about 450 pcs/sec, and the centralized data manager peaks at
about 150 pcs/sec. 'e peak throughput of the encryption
function is about 370 pcs/sec, and the peak throughput of the
decryption function is about 600 pcs/sec. Moreover, the
blockchain itself is a decentralized storage model, which
further proves the research direction of this paper.
