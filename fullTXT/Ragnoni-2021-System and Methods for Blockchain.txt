System and Methods for
Blockchain-Inspired Digital Game Asset
Management
Gianluca Ragnoni
Abstract In 2017, IGT’s Italian Software Architecture team, identified some
features of the emerging blockchain, as enabling technologies to manage a ledger
(or data store) that used cryptography and digital signatures to prove identity and
authenticity (G. Ragnoni, E. Martire, F. Battini, System andMethods for Blockchain-
Based Digital Lottery Ticket Generation and Distribution USPTO, Application
Number 15/916,620 Filing date Mar 9 2018. https://patents.google.com/patent/
US10931457B2). The idea was to design and implement a fully managed ledger
database that provided a transparent, immutable and cryptographically verifiable
platform for managing the creation of digital assets (e.g. game ticket) and the
transfer of asset’s ownership between users. Following the above idea, the team
designed and implemented Transaction Certification Authority (TCA), an IGT
platform that tracks each and every asset’s transactions and maintains a complete
and verifiable history of ownership change over time. The aim of this paper is to
present TCA, its features and functioning mechanism.

1 Context and Concepts
The digitalization era is highlighting new opportunities to enhance customer
experiences, providing new advanced, personalized, tailored and improved services
for all actors involved into the Gaming Value-Chain [1].
Within this context, IGT built a digital gaming vision intending to unleash in-
store digital experiences providing new digital journeys for customers within the
Point of Sales. In this scope, IGT already provided several digital services to the
customers enabling to get info, filling playslip, checking winnings through digital

touchpoints (e.g. mobile devices, self stations, etc.). In addition, mixed paper-digital
services have already been provided enabling customers to participate to a digital
lottery starting from a paper.
With the aim to have a full in-store digital experience the main challenge is
related to provide the ability to manage digital tickets maintaining:
• The gaming model currently in place, where customers are not obliged to open
game account to participate to the Lottery;
• The advanced security and anti-tampering measures integrated on the paper
tickets.
Exploiting some features of the emerging Blockchain model [2, 3], IGT designed
and developed a proprietary digital asset management solution called Transaction
Certification Authority (TCA) for digital ticket management.
TCA is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable
and cryptographically verifiable platform for managing the creation of digital assets
and the transfer of assets’ ownership between users. With TCA, the transaction’s
change history is immutable, it cannot be altered or deleted, using cryptography,
and the client can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to
asset’s ownership.
The article is structured as follows: in Sect. 2 the TCA systems are described
in terms of Scenario, Actors and Concept and Transactions available; in Sect. 3,
the security requirements addressed by project referring to security standards are
summarized; Sect. 4 is devoted to conclusions.
2 TCA
In this section the TCA systems are described in terms of Scenario, Actors and
Concept and Transactions available.
The first subsection describes the main use case introducing a logical model to
address the business requirements, the second subsection details the model of the
project in terms of actors of the system, actions (or transaction) that each actor can
do, rules of the actions, finally the type of transactions available in the system are
explained using interaction diagrams.
2.1 Scenario
TCA is a platform designed to certify the ownership of arbitrary digital assets,
regarding asset issuing and asset transferring between users, ensuring anonymity
of the users, confidentiality, data integrity, non-repudiation, process transparency
and reproducibility.

Fig. 3 Scenario C
By means of TCA a client with a specific clearance can register an asset on TCA;
after registration users can transfer assets each other.
The TCA allows implicit agreement or explicit agreement when a new owner
receives a digital asset: if the agreement is implicit (explained in the example in
Fig. 1) when a digital asset is transferred to him, he automatically becomes the new
owner, instead if the agreement is explicit (explained in the examples in Figs. 2 and
3) he may confirm or deny (rollback) the transfer.

2.2 Actors and Concepts
TCA adopts a model involving the following actors:
(i) The Issuers: the actors issuing digital assets;
(ii) Clients: the actors owning and transferring assets;
(iii) The Transaction Certification Authority (TCA);
(iv) One or more external Certification Authority (CA), used as a trusted third party
external entity to guarantee immutability.
Each actor has a pair of asymmetric keys and it is identified by its public key
(pubkey).
Issuer and customers interact through transactions.
2.3 Transactions
There are two types of transaction:
Operational Transaction Invoked by the subject issuing or transferring the asset;
it allows to record the new ownership of the asset. Each transaction is the transfer
of ownership of a digital asset (DA) from a public key called SOURCE, to another
public key called DESTINATION. Each transaction is linked to the previous owner
through the transaction hash.
• Genesis Transaction: this transaction allows to register an asset on the TCA and
assigns its ownership to a client. It is always invoked by the Issuer.
• Transfer Transaction: allows to register the transfer of an asset from the current
owner to a new owner.
Control Transaction If enabled, it is invoked by the client that receives an assets
or, in case of rollback, by one any of the clients involved in the transfer, to confirm or
deny the change of ownership. Each control transaction is linked to the operational
transaction to be confirmed or rolled back.
• Confirm Transaction: this transaction allows the destination to confirm the
willingness to receive the asset.
• Rollback Transaction: this transaction allows the destination to reject the asset
or the source to abort the transfer if the destination has not confirmed it yet.
Each transaction is authorized by the TCA and the SOURCE using a digital
signature.
Each transaction is recorded also in a block in a public transaction ledger (PTL)
by TCA.
Each block is hashed and is linked to the previous block via hash value in the
PTL.
System and Methods for Blockchain-Inspired Digital Game Asset Management 185
Each block hash is also timestamped with a signature provided by CA. This
feature guarantees the immutability via an external trusted third party entity.
Examples:
• Scenario A: in Fig. 1, control transaction disabled (implicit agreement). Only
operational transaction. The final owner of the digital asset is C.
• Scenario B: in Fig. 2, control transaction enabled (explicit agreement), with
confirm transactions. The final owner of the digital asset is C.
• Scenario C: in Fig. 3, control transaction enabled (explicit agreement), with
confirm and rollback transactions. The final owner of the digital asset is B.
Figure 4 depicts a sequence diagram showing the message flow of Genesis
Transaction with implicit non-repudiation. Genesis Transaction has three actors:
a customer (Customer1) requiring an asset generation from an authorized issuer
(Issuer) that generates the asset, the TCA as a digital notary to guarantee issuing,
transfer and ownership of the digital asset.
In message #1 Customer1 requires asset issuing to the Issuer, specifying his
public key as the destination for the asset.
In message #2 Issuer creates a digital asset (DA) and creates a message (MSG)
contains DA, the origin of DA (or the source) inserting his public key and the
destination of the asset using the public key received from the Customer1.
In message #3 Issuer signs MSG with his private key (DS Issuer).
In message #4 Issuer sends MSG and DS Issuer to the TCA.
In message #5 TCA does a set of checks as for example if the Issuer is authorized
to issue the asset, if asset is new and it is well formed syntactically etc . . . If checks
are positive, TCA signs MSG (DS TCA), creates a new transaction with MSG,
DS Issuer and DS TCA and saves the transaction in the Public Transaction Ledger
(PTL).

Fig. 5 Transfer transaction
In messages #6, #7 transaction is sent back to Issuer and to the Customer1. At
the end of this process, Customer1 is the owner of the asset.
Looking at the Transaction ID1 to the left of the diagram, we can see the message
(MSG) containing the asset (DA), the issuer of the asset (or SOURCE) represented
by the public key of the Issuer, the owner of the asset (or DESTINATION)
represented by the public key of the Customer1. Then the message signatures made
by the Issuer and by the TCA.
Figure 5 depicts a sequence diagram showing the messages flow of Transfer
Transaction with implicit non-repudiation. A typical Transfer Transaction has three
actors: a customer (Customer2) requiring the transfer of an asset from another
customer (Customer1) that owns the asset and the TCA that acts as a digital notary
to guarantee correctness of transfer and new ownership of the digital asset. In the
Transfer Transaction the current owner of the asset (SOURCE), has the right to
transfer the asset to someone else (DESTINATION).
In message #1 Customer2 requires an asset transfer to Customer1 specifying
his public key as the new destination of the asset. In arrow #2 Customer1 creates
a message (MSG) contains DA, the origin of DA (or the source) inserting his
public key and the destination of the asset using the public key received from the
Customer2. Customer1 signs MSG with his private key (DS Customer1).
In message #3 Customer1 send MSG and DS Customer1 to TCA.
In message #4 TCA does a set of checks as for example if the Customer1 is the
current owner of asset and has the right to transfer. If true, TCA digital sign MSG
(DS TCA), creates a new transaction with MSG, DS Customer1 and DS TCA and
saves the transaction in the Public Transaction Ledger (PTL).
In messages #5, #6 transaction is sent back to Customer1 and to the Customer2.
At the end of this process, Customer2 is the owner of the asset.
Looking at the Transaction ID2 to the left of the diagram, we can see the message
(MSG) containing the asset (DA), the previous owner of the asset (or SOURCE)
represents by the public key of the Customer1, the current owner of the asset

(or DESTINATION) represents by the public key of the Customer2, the message
signatures made by the Customer1 and by the TCA.
3 Security Features
According to the standard ISO/IEC 27000:2018 [4], information security is the
protection of confidentiality, integrity, availability (often denoted by acronym CIA);
the same standard also includes other requirements, as authenticity, accountability,
non-repudiation, and reliability. In the well-known glossary CNSS [5], data security
is described according to the CIA requirements: “The protection of information
and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and
availability”.
The definition in the ISACA [6] glossary is similar: “Ensures that only authorized
users (confidentiality) have access to accurate and complete information (integrity)
when required (availability).”
In the framework of the TCA project, among the ISO/IEC 27000:2018 require-
ments, we select as relevant, the following items to implement:
• Confidentiality: information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized
individuals, entities, or processes;
• Integrity: information is complete and correct, in particular, information cannot
be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner;
• Authenticity: each entity involved in some operation should provide a proof that
it is what it claims to be;
• Non-Repudiation: each entity involved in some operation cannot deny having
executed its own actions.
Other requirements are not managed directly, since they are implied by the previ-
ous ones (accountability is implied by integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation),
or they are out of the scope of this study (availability, reliability).
4 Conclusion
In the gaming context, TCA platform can enable ticket receipt dematerialization
inside the retail store with a seamless integration with current ecosystem providing
a “Phygital” (physical and digital) experience for the user that can have a digital
version of ticket receipt (the asset) in their mobile device, with the same security
features of the physical one.
Moreover TCA, can play the role of “layer 2 infrastructure” integrating itself
with a public blockchain infrastructure. In fact, since 2017, public blockchain infras-
tructures have been evolved and nowadays, although there are a lot of blockchain
188 G. Ragnoni
available, capable to manage directly arbitrary digital assets, according to experts
and community thoughts [7], specific domain applications will be necessary on top
of blockchain, in order to manage specific digital assets in a scalable way. Playing
this role, TCA could be a specific domain application that manages digital tickets
for gaming companies that want to enable ticket receipt dematerialization. In this
scenario, public blockchain infrastructure can replace the Certification Authority
saving only block’s fingerprint of transactions managed by TCA.
TCA model has been patented [8] in US with number US10931457B2 and is
already integrated in the Italian Digital National Lottery.
