Driven by the pain points of the organic food supply chain, which has been plagued by counterfeiting and di�culties in pursuing
accountability, this paper investigates a secondary organic food supply chain consisting of suppliers and retailers and establishes
two supply chain models under the traditional model and in the blockchain traceability context. In order to e�ectively solve the
problem of unrealized Pareto improvement in organic food supply chain after applying blockchain, a new hybrid contract based
on bene�t-sharing and cost-sharing is designed to coordinate the supply chain and realize Pareto improvement, and this solution
is gradually applied to organic food enterprises. Based on the fact that blockchain can improve trust in the supply chain and
eliminate counterfeiting of organic food, the relationship between the rate of genuine products andmarket demand and the cost of
blockchain is established, and then the analysis is developed using the Stackelberg game. We compare the traditional model with
the model in the blockchain context and analyze the optimal pro�t of each supply chain entity, comparing the change in optimal
pro�t before and after the blockchain implementation, and clarifying the cost threshold of the blockchain technology input
application. We �nd that: (i)  e adoption of blockchain can not only improve the authenticity of products and combat
counterfeit and shoddy organic food, but at the same time, the improvement of organic level in the context of blockchain will also
attract some consumers to buy organic food, which will increase the main body of the supply chain and the overall pro�t. (ii)
Blockchain-adopted supply chains are consistently more pro�table for all parties and overall than traditional supply chains.  e
main contribution of this study is that in the organic food supply chain under the application of blockchain technology model, by
introducing revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts, the pro�t between each member of the organic food supply chain is
further improved than the traditional model, and also, all of them are optimized, which further improves the stability of the supply
chain and brings the supply chain to a coordinated state. Finally, in this context, the obtained results show the e�ectiveness and
realistic operational e�ciency of the proposed approach for companies compared to traditional single revenue-sharing covenants.
A combination of revenue-sharing and cost-sharing covenants is the best approach to solve such problems. In conclusion, it
should be noted that the analysis presented in this study will help decision makers choose the most appropriate option among the
possible solutions according to their criteria.  is proposed framework can also be extended in various cases where pro�ts are out
of balance in the organic food supply chain, such as safety and value gain.
1. Introduction
According to Blueweave Consulting & Research Pvt. Ltd.,
the global organic food market is expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% from
2018 to 2026, driving consumers to purchase organic food.
 e main reason for purchasing organic food is health, and
customers with healthy eating habits are more likely to buy
organic food [1]. Organic food is now one of the fastest
growing segments of the food market, with signi�cant
increases in production and sales in many developing
countries.  e consumer demand in China’s organic food
market is gradually becoming larger, and the number of
consumers buying organic food is increasing, involving
organic food products such as dairy products and vege-
tables [2, 3].

*e organic food supply chain has always had the pain
point of counterfeiting and accountability [4]. *e current
traceability technology cannot prevent organic food infor-
mation from being tampered with, resulting in general
mistrust between the upstream and downstream of the
organic food supply chain, uncoordinated supply chain
management, and low efficiency [5, 6]. Since the Japanese
scholar Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the blockchain in 2008,
blockchain technology has entered the public’s field of vision
as the underlying technology of Bitcoin. Due to the unique
characteristics of the blockchain, people soon began to re-
alize the block chain. *e application prospect of blockchain
technology has caused a frenzy of research on blockchain in
the world [4]. One of the cores of the blockchain is to in-
crease trust. It establishes mutual trust relationship through
peer-to-peer network, encryption algorithm, time stamp,
and other technologies, which plays an important role in
enhancing the trust cooperation relationship between supply
chains and improving supply chain coordination [7]. After
years of development, blockchain has begun to extend to
finance, supply chain management, logistics, traceability,
and other important areas, of which anti-counterfeiting
traceability of agricultural products is one of the main ap-
plications in traceability. Organic food is quite popular
among global consumers because its healthy and green. In
the past five years, the production of organic food in China
has been rising and the market scale has been expanding, but
the painful problem of counterfeiting in the distribution
process has not been solved. *e traditional organic food
supply chain distribution system is prone to information
tampering and low data security, coupled with information
asymmetry and difficulty in accurate traceability, resulting in
unscrupulous organic food manufacturers in the supply
chain making use of substandard products and adulterating
them [8]. In the circulation process of organic food, con-
fusing labels and counterfeiting of trademarks occur from
time to time, and the tampering of organic food information
is even more difficult to prevent [9]. In the upstream of the
supply chain, it is still genuine organic food, but when it
reaches downstream distributors and retailers, it is discarded
by low-quality and shoddy organic food. *e supply chain is
filled with a large number of fake and shoddy organic foods
that cannot be accurately identified the organic food supply
chain.*e trust between them has long existed in name only,
which has seriously affected the cooperation and coordi-
nation among the members of the supply chain and hin-
dered the development of the organic food industry [10].
Although many large organic food companies spend a lot of
operating cost every year to fight counterfeiting and anti-
counterfeiting and maintain their own brand products, the
results are minimal, and it is still difficult to solve the
problems of trust and counterfeiting in the organic food
supply chain. *e immutable nature of the blockchain has
brought opportunities to combat counterfeit and shoddy
organic food and establish a traceability system that can be
traced throughout the entire process. Its encryption algo-
rithm, peer-to-peer network, consensus mechanism, and
other technologies have created conditions for the estab-
lishment of trust between supply chains [11]. With the
continuous development of blockchain technology, many
companies have begun to study blockchain-based trace-
ability management systems [12]. In the past two years, more
and more enterprises have used blockchain technology to
trace the whole process of organic food, combat the phe-
nomenon of counterfeiting and shoddy organic food in the
supply chain, protect the real organic food, and reshape the
relationship between the upstream and downstream of the
organic food supply chain. Trust can improve the collabo-
ration efficiency between supply chains and achieve supply
chain coordination. With the continuous development of
blockchain technology, many countries are aware of the
application prospects of blockchain in traceability [13, 14].
Based on the fact that the information on the blockchain
cannot be tampered with, the authenticity of the product can
be guaranteed when the blockchain is used for traceability.
*erefore, in recent years, some large enterprises in China
have begun to seize the opportunity to enter the blockchain
traceability market [5]. At present, the development of
blockchain is in a period of rapid development, and the
application of blockchain is no longer limited to the financial
field. During this period, a large number of entrepreneurs
began to create blockchain companies, and people began to
explore the application of blockchain technology in other
fields. *e value and prospect are, respectively, applied to
logistics, supply chain management, medical care, and ed-
ucation. Currently, there are more applications in the field of
supply chain finance [15–17].
Lotfi et al. [18] considered a closed-loop supply chain by
taking into account sustainability, resilience, robustness,
and risk aversion for the first time. Lotfi et al. [19] proposed
that the use of blockchain Technology (BCT) is growing
faster in each country. Blockchain can improve transpar-
ency, trust, information sharing, security, and ensure in-
formation is not tampered with in the organic food supply
chain [20]. By using blockchain technology, it helps to
share information between members and reduce transac-
tion costs between companies in the organic food supply
chain [21].*e supply chain information system built using
blockchain effectively connects all supply chain entities and
facilitates the exchange of information in the supply chain
[22]. *e technical characteristics of blockchain, such as
nontampering of information, open and transparent in-
formation, and time stamp, provide new ideas for solving
the problem of counterfeiting and counterfeiting of organic
food and reshaping the trust between organic food supply
chains. *e whole process of anti-counterfeiting trace-
ability system of food can prevent counterfeit and shoddy
organic food from flowing into the supply chain, enhance
trust between the upstream of the organic food supply
chain, and promote the supply chain to achieve a coor-
dinated state. Although the blockchain is still in the initial
stage of development, it is believed that under the pro-
motion of national policies, in the context of the urgent
needs of the organic food industry, and the unique ad-
vantages of blockchain in anti-counterfeiting and trace-
ability, and establishing trust in the supply chain, future
applications blockchain traceability of organic food will
become a norm, so it is of practical significance for us to
2 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
study the coordination of the organic food supply chain
based on blockchain technology.
Based on this, in the context of blockchain technology,
this paper studies the coordination of organic food supply
chain, and introduces appropriate supply chain contracts to
coordinate the profits of supply chain members. *e fol-
lowing questions are mainly investigated:
(1) Under decentralized decision-making, which model
is more profitable for retailers compared to the
traditional model and the blockchain model?
(2) Under decentralized decision-making, does the
supply chain in the context of blockchain reach the
optimal state?
(3) In the traditional supply chain, how does the genuine
rate of organic food affect the profit of the supply
chain?
(4) Are supply chains that adopt blockchain more
profitable than traditional supply chains? Can supply
chain adoption of blockchain improve efficiency?
(5) How do cost-sharing and revenue-sharing factors
affect supply chain profitability?
(6) How to encourage organic food manufacturers to
actively adopt blockchain technology, trace the
source of the whole process, maintain the brand
image of organic food, and put it into the supply
chain to achieve supply chain collaboration and
improve supply chain performance?
We consider a secondary supply chain model consisting
of an organic food producer and a retailer. We take the
serious phenomenon of organic food counterfeiting and the
distrust between the supply chain subjects as the research
background, and use the characteristics of blockchain on-
chain information being tamperproof and traceable as the
basis. Introducing blockchain can eliminate the counter-
feiting of organic food, improve the organic degree between
the supply chain subjects, and make the organic food supply
chain achieve coordination as the goal, and on this basis, we
study the contractual coordination problem of the organic
food supply chain. We construct a supply chain game model
based on two scenarios: the blockchain model and the
traditional model, and compare and analyze the optimal
profit of each supply chain subject. Comparing the change in
optimal profit before and after the implementation of
blockchain, we further study the cost threshold of block-
chain technology input application.
*e main contribution and motivation of this study are
as follows:
(1) Under the traditional model, the increase in organic
food authenticity will bring higher profits to the
supply chain.
(2) *e adoption of blockchain can increase the rate of
organic food authenticity and combat counterfeit
organic food, while the increase in trust in the
blockchain context will attract some consumers to
buy organic food and bring additional revenue to the
supply chain.
(3) As there is no counterfeiting and trust is improved in
the blockchain context, the profit of the supply chain
is always higher than that of the traditional supply
chain, which also shows that the adoption of
blockchain can improve the efficiency of the supply
chain.
We organized this paper as follows. In Section 2, we
study on related work and show gap research within the
organic food supply chain in the context of blockchain
technology. In Section 3, we determine the blockchainmodel
of organic food and the mathematical model of the tradi-
tional model. In Section 4, we detail management insights
from the industrial case. In Section 5, the findings and results
of the proposed model with sensitivity analysis are
explained. In Sections 6 and 7, the managerial insights and
conclusion and outlook are determined. All proofs are
relegated to Appendix.
2. Literature Review
Based on the topics we discuss, our work involves the fol-
lowing three aspects. *is section briefly reviews related
concepts, including blockchain, organic food supply chains,
and supply chain contracts to provide some background
information based on our research. *erefore, we will
summarize the literature from the above three aspects.
2.1. Blockchain. *e blockchain is now more and more
valued by the country and all walks of life. By sorting out the
blockchain traceability and the research status of our paper,
there are mainly the following two aspects: on the one hand,
blockchain can improve the transparency and trust of supply
chain information degree, information sharing, and security
to ensure that information is not tampered with. Bodkhe
et al. [23] found that the application of blockchain tech-
nology helps to realize information sharing among members
and reduce transaction costs among supply chain enter-
prises. Berdik et al. [24] used the supply chain information
system constructed by the blockchain to effectively connect
the main bodies of the supply chain and promote the ex-
change of information in the supply chain. Lu [25] proposed
an agricultural product system architecture model based on
the consortium blockchain based on the decentralization
characteristics of blockchain technology, thereby preventing
network attacks and ensuring the security and reliability of
agricultural product data. Monrat et al. [26] proposed to use
blockchain technology to build a consortium chain to solve
the problem of trust between cross-border e-commerce and
domestic e-commerce and the quality and safety of goods.
Zhou et al. [27] concluded that the application of blockchain
will solve the problem of information asymmetry in financial
institutions and reduce risks through theoretical analysis.
Morkunas et al. [28] used the newsboy model to analyze that
the blockchain debt swap platform has high trust, high ef-
ficiency, easy operation, low cost, and higher financing ef-
ficiency. Singh et al. [29] showed that blockchain technology
can overcome collaboration and trust issues in supply chains
and minimize the negative consequences of eliminating
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 3
information asymmetry in supply chain echelons. To make
the agricultural supply chain more transparent, Chang et al.
[30] proposed a dual-chain storage structure characterized
by a chained data structure for storing blockchain trans-
action hashes, with the aim of ensuring that agricultural
product data is not tampered with or destroyed. On the other
hand, the record information of the blockchain cannot be
calculated and traced, which is suitable for solving the
problem of counterfeiting and shoddy, and can carry out
product information traceability and anti-counterfeiting,
which has a good effect on solving the long-standing pain
point of counterfeiting.
In recent years, many experts and scholars have used
blockchain as a tool to study and solve the problems of
product traceability and anti-counterfeiting. Feng et al.
[31] proposed that the integration of blockchain tech-
nology and IoT technology can solve the problems of easy
calculation, modification, and counterfeiting of cross-
border e-commerce product information. Andoni et al.
[32] believe that the immutable characteristics of
blockchain and timestamp technology can be used to
solve the problems of data tracking and information anti-
counterfeiting. Dutta et al. [33] proposed that because
blockchain technology information cannot be tampered
with, and information is updated and stored in real-time,
it has great advantages for supply chain cost control, and
information is difficult to tamper with, which is condu-
cive to supply chain anti-counterfeiting traceability.
Deepa et al. [34] built a blockchain-based agricultural
product traceability system, which helped solve the
problem of insecure agricultural product data and in-
formation, protected consumers’ rights and interests, and
improved consumers’ confidence in products. Other
scholars have also conducted in-depth discussions on
blockchain traceability, and began to study the con-
struction of blockchain-based traceability systems and
frameworks and applied them to different subjects.
Upadhyay [35] proposed a blockchain-based framework
that can successfully handle the critical recovery problem,
preventing cloning attacks, counterfeit labels, and
counterfeit products. Gai et al. [36] constructed a
blockchain-based logistics monitoring system to provide
a solution for package tracking in supply chains. Xu et al.
[37] described the integration of blockchain into supply
chain architecture to solve the problems of corruption,
fraud, and tampering faced by supply chains in cen-
tralized supply chain management systems. Zhang and
Lee [38] discussed the tracking and traceability of soy-
bean supply chain using the potential of blockchain and
smart contracts.
After summarizing the domestic and foreign research
status of the above blockchain, it can be concluded that
the application of blockchain to improve the overall trust
in the supply chain and combating counterfeit and
shoddy products has become a consensus in the industry.
*ere are also many ideas for blockchain traceability. It
has been implemented, and these theoretical and prac-
tical foundations have brought better help to our
research.
2.2. Organic Food Supply Chain. Among the existing re-
search results, the coordination between enterprises in the
food supply chain and the green supply chain is most similar
to the coordination of the organic food supply chain. Many
scholars have conducted related research. Most of the co-
ordination methods proposed by scholars mainly includes
incentive coordination, cost coordination, and contract
coordination. Rana and Paul [3] advocate an incentive
mechanism. He believes that there will inevitably be some
risks in the cooperative enterprises in the food supply chain.
*erefore, some risks that may appear should be prevented
and avoided. Among them, the use of incentive mechanisms
is an excellent way to avoid risks. One of the means. Perlman
et al. [39] conducted a theoretical and empirical analysis of
the contractual cooperation between upstream and down-
stream suppliers and retailers in the food supply chain.
A large number of articles have studied the problem of
profit coordination between manufacturers and retailers in
the supply chain, and have designed a variety of coordi-
nation mechanisms to maximize the profits of the supply
chain, but only a small number of articles have included the
consumers who determine product sales in the model and
considered the influence of consumer mentality factors even
less. Segura et al. [40] found that bargaining power is the
most important determinant of the relationship between
core and upstream and downstream firms in the food supply
chain, and the researchers studied the bargaining process
between firms in the food supply chain by applying game
bargaining theory. Denver et al. [41] studied 149 companies
at the core of the supply chain, and pointed out that
companies in large industries with high uncertainty have
begun to pay attention to and implement guidance, edu-
cation, evaluation, and guidance on green suppliers. Su-
pervise activities to achieve vertical and horizontal
expansion of the enterprise and improve the performance
level of the enterprise. Paciarotti and Torregiani [42] pro-
posed that the effect of pollution prevention in supply chain
operation is closely related to the degree of cooperation
between upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply
chain. Carino et al. [43] believe that the bullwhip effect in the
supply chain is obvious, and propose that if information
sharing is used as a coordination incentive mechanism, the
phenomenon of bullwhip effect in the supply chain can be
effectively reduced, and the safety and quality problems in
the food supply chain can be well solved and control.
Torretta et al. [44] first discovered the different ways of
undertaking supply chain enterprises, and on this basis,
proposed two methods to achieve sustainable development
of the supply chain, and proposed a method in which all
members share environmental-related responsibilities. A
large number of articles simplify the supply chain coordi-
nation problem to a two-player game model of a supplier
and a retailer, and few articles study the game between the
two groups of suppliers and retailers. In view of the defi-
ciencies in the above studies, our paper will conduct further
in-depth research. Haleem et al. [45] conducted an actual
survey of a few manufacturing companies in the United
States, and on this basis, proposed some supply chain sys-
tems to help companies establish how to coordinate with the
4 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
environment within the system. Nakandala and Lau [46] put
forward a specific method on how to use a reliable ac-
countability system to improve the food safety factor. *e
research results show that contract management can im-
prove the food safety factor in the food supply chain very
well.
2.3. Supply Chain Contract. We will use cost-sharing and
revenue-sharing contracts, so the research review will be
more inclined to the relevant research status in this area.
*ere are still many studies on the use of cost-sharing and
revenue-sharing contracts to coordinate supply chains,
which is suitable for the supply chain model that solves the
uneven sharing of supply chain costs and the uncoordinated
distribution of benefits, which is consistent with our research
content. *e introduction of blockchain technology will
increase some additional costs, so we believe that revenue-
sharing and cost-sharing contracts should be one of the
preferred contracts for coordination of organic food supply
chain contracts, and are also more suitable for solving
problems in organic food supply chains and coordination
issues.
*e research on cost-sharing and revenue-sharing
contracts is in-depth and extensive, and they are basically the
coordination research applied to two-level and three-level
supply chain models, including single contract coordination,
as well as joint and improved contract coordination. For
example, Dubey et al. [47] studied the contract coordination
problem of the two-level supply chain of banks and
e-commerce platforms, by introducing parameters such as
effort level and cost, reputation information price and cost,
and used game theory to analyze the final use of revenue-
sharing and cost-sharing contracts to achieve supply chain
coordination.
In addition, there are a number of top scholars who have
made substantial contributions in their respective fields. Goli
et al. [48] address a robust multiobjective multi-period
aggregate production planning (APP) problem based on
different scenarios under uncertain seasonal demand.
According to the survey conducted by Ghoreishi et al. [49],
optimal pricing strategy is one of the major policies for
sellers or retailers to obtain its maximum profit. Goli et al.
[50] address the multiobjective, multiproduct, and multi-
period closed-loop supply chain network design with un-
certain parameters, whose aim is to incorporate the financial
flow as the cash flow and debts’ constraints and labor
employment under fuzzy uncertainty. Savku andWeber [51]
study a stochastic optimal control problem for a delayed
Markov regime-switching jump-diffusion model. Lotfi et al.
[52] suggested a hybrid fuzzy and data-driven robust op-
timization for Resilience and Sustainable Health Care Supply
Chain (RSHCSC) with VMI approach is appropriate for
improving the inventory management system and tackling
uncertainty and disruption in this situation. Tirkolaee et al.
[53] identified the contributions of ML techniques in
selecting and segmenting suppliers, predicting supply chain
risks, and estimating demand and sales, production, in-
ventory management, transportation and distribution,
sustainable development (SD), and circular economy (CE).
Kropat et al. [54] proposed a novel framework of semi-
algebraic gene-environment networks. Khalilpourazari and
Doulabi [55] showed that the offered robust model handles
uncertainties more efficiently and finds solutions that have
significantly lower costs and delivery time. Midya et al. [56]
mainly focus on presenting an innovative study of a multi-
stage multi-objective fixed-charge solid transportation
problem (MMFSTP) with a green supply chain network
system under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment.
Lin and He [57] studied the master-slave problem of the
two-level supply chain of suppliers and e-commerce plat-
forms by introducing several parameters, fresh-keeping
effort level, and cost. *e mixed contract of revenue-sharing
and cost-sharing realizes the coordination of the supply
chain. Jiang and Liu [58] studied the supply chain coordi-
nation problem of the three-level fresh food e-commerce
supply chain of suppliers, distributors, and retailers through
two variables of loss value and confidence level, and finally
realized the supply chain through revenue-sharing contracts
and discount contracts and coordination. Chang et al. [59]
studied the supply chain coordination among the three
stakeholders of e-commerce suppliers, third-party logistics
companies, and community retail fresh stores, and intro-
duced two variables, freshness preservation effort level and
freshness, to define fresh food products. Finally, through
game theory analysis, it can be seen that the supply chain is
not coordinated, and the supply chain coordination is re-
alized through revenue-sharing and preservation cost-
sharing contracts. Dolgui et al. [60] study the coordination
problem of two-level fresh food supply chain including
suppliers and retailers, and use Stackberg game to analyze,
and use cost universal contract to study whether it can make
the supply chain coordinated, and finally, the numerical
analysis verifies its effectiveness. Xiao et al. [61] proposed to
add a reverse revenue-sharing contract to the closed-loop
supply chain for coordination in view of the inconsistency in
the closed-loop supply chain.
*e research on cost-sharing and revenue-sharing
contracts is still relatively abundant. Among them, cost-
sharing contracts are mostly used when there are common
costs in the supply chain, while revenue-sharing contracts
are mostly used in conjunction with cost-sharing contracts
which can achieve supply chain coordination.
In conclusion, first of all, we consider the method of
quantitative analysis and research, and respectively, con-
struct the game model under the blockchain and the tra-
ditional mode. We study the profit changes under the
blockchain and the traditional mode, respectively. Each
subject and the total profit are higher than the traditional
model, and the cost threshold of applying the blockchain is
found. Second, we describe the relationship between the
authenticity rate of organic food and supply chain profit, and
decentralized decision-making can lead to a decline in total
supply chain profit. Finally, we design a cost-sharing and
benefit-sharing contract, and conclude that the benefit-
sharing and cost-sharing coefficients are within a certain
range, which can facilitate coordination between organic
food producers and retailers.
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 5
A more detail classification of the literature is presented
in Table 1 with respect to six features including supply chain,
method, contract, objectives, blockchain, and case study.*e
features related to the problem in the present study are
presented in the last row of the table.
3. Problem Statement
We consider that many organic food manufacturers are both
producers and distributors, and in the context of blockchain,
the organic food supply chain does not need somany links to
complete transactions. In order to facilitate analysis, we are
considering including organic food. A two-tier supply chain
model including food producers and retailers, where organic
food producers are the leaders of this supply chain model,
and retailers are followers, so our study is suitable for
analysis by the Stackelberg game, where retailers decide the
optimal price based on the wholesale price of organic food
producers’ selling price.
3.1. Assumptions and Notation List
(i) Organic food producers need to invest in additional
costs to process and produce organic food, where
e(0< e< 1) is the organic degree of the food [62].
(ii) We assume that the market demand function is of
the form QB � a − bp + λe, where a is the potential
organic food market demand, b is the price sensi-
tivity coefficient of organic food, p is the market
price of organic food, and λe is the consumption
[63].
(iii) *e demand under the traditional and blockchain
models is the retailer’s order quantity D, so Q�D,
our mathematical model use Q directly to analyze
the order quantity, and no longer use D.
(iv) We assume that the application cost cB and organic
effort cost ke2/2 of the blockchain are borne by the
organic food manufacturer, the leader of the supply
chain [64, 65].
Figure 1 describes the supply chain structure.
First, parameters and decision variables are defined in
Table 2 as follows:
*e supply chain decision-making problem is usually
looked at from the perspectives of centralized and
decentralized organization settings. In the following, we
first study the decentralized decision model in the tradi-
tional model and compare it with the decentralized deci-
sion model in the blockchain model. We then study the
centralized decision model in the blockchain model and
find that the supply chain in the blockchain model is not
optimal, arguing for the need to construct a coordination
model.
3.2. Decentralized Decision-Making Model in Traditional
Mode. First, we consider that, in the context of the tradi-
tional traceability model, the manufacturer is the leader of
the supply chain and the retailer is the follower. In the
traditional case, the consumer’s demand function is of the
form QN � a − bpN. *e organic food retailer purchases
unit QN of organic food from the organic foodmanufacturer
after clarifying the market demand. In the traditional
traceability mode, there is a phenomenon of fake and in-
ferior products, and the rate of genuine products is
μ(0< μ< 1).
*en the profits of organic food producers and retailers
can be obtained as follows:

3.3. Decentralized Decision-Making Model in the Context of
Blockchain. We will analyze that in the context of block-
chain, manufacturers and retailers are separate individuals
under decentralized decision-making, and both manufac-
turers and retailers pursue the maximization of their own
interests. At this point, the retailer wants to buy Q units of
organic food from the producer, and the producer’s
wholesale price is w. Under the blockchain traceability
mode, all information cannot be changed once it is on the
chain, the information is symmetrical, and there is no
counterfeiting. From here we will use the superscript B,
which stands for the blockchain model. At this time
QB � a − bpB + λe, the blockchain application cost cB is
borne by the organic food producer.
*en, the profits of organic food producers and retailers
at this time can be obtained as follows:

3.4. Comparison of Traditional Models and Models in the
Context of Blockchain. We compare the retailer’s profit, the
supplier’s profit, and the overall profit of the supply chain
between the traditional model and the blockchain scenario,
and draw the following propositions:
Proposition 1. =e profit of the retailer under the blockchain
model is higher than that of the retailer under the traditional
model.
From Proposition 1, for organic food retailers, the
adoption of blockchain is beneficial, at least more profitable
than the traditional model.
*e specific certification process is in Appendix.
Proposition 2. To meet certain conditions, the profit of
producers under the blockchain model can be higher than that
of the traditional model.
See Appendix for the specific certification process.
Proposition 3. =e application of blockchain can effectively
eliminate the fake and shoddy organic food, improve the trust
of organic food, and at the same time attract a part of
consumer demand to buy organic food, which directly brings
about an increase in revenue, from the overall profit of the
supply chain. From a perspective, if the cost of blockchain is
too high, it is not recommended for the supply chain to adopt
blockchain for anti-counterfeiting traceability of organic food.
*e specific certification process is in Appendix.
Corollary 1. When 0≤ cB ≤ cE
B, after the application of
blockchain technology, the total profit of the supply chain can
be improved, where cE
B � 3[μ(a + λe − bc)2− (μa − bc)2]/
16μb − k/2e2.
*e specific certification process is in Appendix.
Corollary 1 finds the cost threshold of blockchain ap-
plication, that is, within this threshold range, blockchain can
improve the total profit of the supply chain and increase the
stability of the organic food supply chain.
Corollary 2. When cB ≥ cE
B, after the blockchain is put into
application, the total profit of the supply chain is less than that
of the traditional model, where cE
B � 3[μ(a + λe − bc)2−
(μa − bc)2]/16μb − k/2e2.
*e specific certification process is in Appendix.
Corollary 2 states that when the cost of blockchain
application is higher than this threshold, the overall profit of
the supply chain will decline and will be lower than the
traditional model. *erefore, the application of blockchain
technology is not recommended at this time.
3.5. Centralized Decision-Making Model in the Context of
Blockchain. Under centralized decision-making, the supply
chain as a whole, organic food producers, and retailers will
decide pricing for the entire supply chain to achieve the
optimal profit level without the cost of ordering products.
*en the profit of the supply chain system can be ob-
tained as follows:

Obtained by comparison: pB∗ >pB∗∗ � wB∗. In other
words, the sales price of organic food under decentralized
decision-making is greater than that under centralized de-
cision-making, and the sales price under centralized deci-
sion-making is equal to the wholesale price under
decentralized decision-making.
Also in the context of blockchain, from the perspective of
the total profit of the supply chain, when πB∗ is compared in
decentralized decision-making and πB∗∗ in centralized de-
cision-making, we get πB∗ < πB∗∗. In other words, the total
profit of the supply chain in decentralized decision-making
is lower than that in centralized decision-making, which
indicates that the supply chain profit does not reach the
8 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
optimal state and Pareto efficiency when decentralized de-
cision-making is used. At this time, the supply chain is not in
the optimal state, so we consider using cost-sharing con-
tracts for coordination.
3.6. Coordinating the Supply Chain
3.6.1. Cost-Sharing Contract Coordination under Decen-
tralized Decision-Making in the Context of Blockchain.
*e blockchain-based organic food supply chain does not
achieve Pareto efficiency in decentralized decision-making,
and the supply chain is not optimal. Since the cost of
blockchain is borne by the manufacturer, for retailers, they
prefer to apply blockchain technology to eliminate fake and
shoddy organic food, while retailers do not bear the cost of
blockchain application and organic efforts costs, which in
turn lead to supply chain imbalances. *erefore, we first
adopt a cost-sharing contract to coordinate the organic food
supply chain in the blockchain context, optimized as follows:
organic food producers wholesale to retailers at a lower price
w than the wholesale price in decentralized decision-mak-
ing; at the same time, the retailer commits to bear a pro-
portion σ of the blockchain cost cB and the organic effort
cost ke2/2, which is the proportion that the producer bears
(1 − σ). Producers and retailers share the cost of blockchain
and organic efforts. *e introduction of the subscript–CS
indicates the state under the cost-sharing contract.
At this point, the profits of organic food producers and
retailers under the cost-sharing contract can be obtained as
follows:

=e specific certification process is in Appendix.
In order to realize the coordination of supply chain, the
necessary condition of cost-sharing contract is that the
optimal sales price pB∗∗∗ under the coordination of cost-
sharing contract is equal to the optimal sales price pB ∗∗
under centralized decision-making, namely, a + λe + bwB/
2b � a + bc + λe/2b, which can be obtained through alge-
braic analysis. When wB � c, pB∗∗ � pB∗∗∗. At this time, the
maximization of the profit of the supply chain is achieved,
that is, under the cost-sharing contract, the overall profit of
the supply chain can be optimized.
It can be seen that the total profit of the supply chain
under the cost-sharing contract is equal to the total profit
under the centralized decision-making. *ere are two
purposes of supply chain coordination. First, to optimize the
overall profit of the supply chain; second, to make the profits
of manufacturers and retailers more than when the supply
chain contract is not adopted. However, it can be seen from
the analysis that the producer’s profit πB∗∗∗
m− CS ≤ 0 under the
coordination of the cost-sharing contract is less than that
without the contract. *is shows that the cost-sharing
contract can only optimize the total profit of the supply
chain, while the profit of the manufacturer is mainly
transferred to the retailer, which will reduce the profit of the
manufacturer, which is mainly beneficial to the retailer.
Obviously, it is not a win-win situation for the supply chain.
*erefore, the cost-sharing contract cannot realize the co-
ordination of the supply chain.
3.6.2. Analysis of Benefit-Sharing Cost-Sharing Contract
Coordination under Decentralized Decision-Making in the
Context of Blockchain. Although the cost-sharing contract
can maximize the profit of the supply chain, the profit of the
manufacturer has been significantly reduced, while the
profit of the retailer has increased, which has not achieved a
win-win situation for all the main bodies of the supply
chain. However, due to the unbalanced distribution of
profits between manufacturers and retailers, cost-sharing
contracts will not be adopted in real economic activities.
*erefore, we then consider the use of an improved cost-
sharing contract for coordination, that is, on the basis of the
original cost-sharing contract coordination, we propose to
let the retailer’s sales draw ε proportion to the manufac-
turer. *e introduction of subscript-CSRS indicates the
state under the combined contract of cost-sharing and
benefit-sharing.
At this point, the profits of organic food producers and
retailers under the hybrid contract of cost-sharing and
revenue-sharing can be obtained as follows:

*e specific certification process is in Appendix.
*rough algebraic analysis, it can be obtained that when
wB � c(1 − ε), the formula is established, and the supply
chain can maximize profits at this time.
In order to achieve a win-win situation and achieve a
state of supply chain coordination, the following conditions
must bemet: πB∗∗∗∗
m− CSRS ≥ πB∗
m and πB∗∗∗∗
r− CSRS ≥ πB∗

from the coordination of supply chain,
(1 − 2ε)(a + λe − bc)2/ 8bσ ≤ cB + k/2e2 and
cB + k/2e2 ≤ (3 − 4ε)(a + λe − bc)2/ 16bσ.
*e final results show that the revenue-sharing factor ε
and the cost-sharing factor σ can be solved. When ε and σ
meet the conditions, the organic food supply chain reaches a
coordinated state.
3.7. Results and Discussion. We have established the rela-
tionship between blockchain input cost and market demand
function by assuming the conditions and relevant parameter
variables. Firstly, in the comparative analysis between the
traditional situation model under decentralized decision-
making and the model under blockchain scenario, we
conclude that the benefit of applying blockchain is to
eliminate counterfeit organic food and increase the sales
profit of retailers. Next, the profit functions of suppliers and
retailers under decentralized decision-making and the
overall profit of the supply chain under centralized decision-
making are then derived. Since the optimal pricing under
decentralized decision is not equal to the optimal pricing
under centralized decision model. According to the coor-
dination theory of supply chain, the supply chain under
decentralized decision model can easily fall into a dys-
functional state. We demonstrate that the supply chain is
indeed in a disjointed state by comparing the profits under
decentralized decision-making and centralized decision-
making. Since the input costs of blockchain are mainly borne
by suppliers, we first propose a cost-sharing contract to
coordinate the supply chain. *rough the analysis, it is clear
that a single cost-sharing contract cannot bring the supply
chain to a coordinated state, so we consider introducing a
revenue-sharing contract and consider allowing the retailer
to give a portion of the revenue to the supplier. We find that
when the cost-sharing factor and revenue-sharing factor
vary within a certain range, the supply chain achieves a
coordinated state. *is suggests that a combination of
revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts can lead to a
coordinated organic food supply chain in a blockchain
scenario. *is section focuses on the derivation and analysis
of algebraic equations, and the specific numerical arithmetic
analysis is in the following, where we validate the previous
findings.
4. Case Study
*e Shanghai Dynamic Information System Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai, China, is considering the implementation of this
newly proposed portfolio optimization solution. *e lack of
an accurate grasp of the organic food market and the pricing
of the application costs of blockchain technology tomake the
right decisions was one of the main problems of this
company, which led to high link costs. *e ensuing high risk
and lack of reward in producing organic food in the tra-
ditional model forced the managers of the food suppliers to
optimize for the future to better cater to the consumer
market.
*e Shanghai Business Information Center released the
results of a special questionnaire survey on the Shanghai
organic food consumer market at the “China International
Organic Food Expo,” which opened in May. *e survey
interviewedmore than 600 consumers who had organic food
consumption experience and basically painted a picture of
the characteristics and consumption preferences of the
Shanghai organic food market. According to the survey,
female consumers with a bachelor’s degree or above, married
with children, and an annual family income of
120,000–250,000 RMB are the main consumer group in the
organic food market, accounting for 59%. *e consumption
rate of vegetables, grains, and fruits topped the list, and the
popularity of other organic foods, including meat products,
dairy products, and aquatic products, reached a high level. It
is worth mentioning that the characteristics of cross-cate-
gory consumption of the middle-aged and elderly groups are
very obvious. High frequency of purchase and high price
tolerance highlight the degree of consumer recognition. In
terms of purchase frequency, the proportion of respondents
who buy organic food once every two or three days is 44%,
and those who buy every week is 36%, totaling 80%. Single
consumption of more than 100 yuan accounted for 37%,
more than 200 yuan accounted for 28%, a total of 65%,
indicating that people who have experienced consumption
of organic food to achieve a high level of recognition and
loyalty, the overall health and durability of the market is
strong. Supermarket chains are still the mainstream sales
channels for organic food, and the scale of online con-
sumption is expanding rapidly. *e survey shows that 79.5%
and 78.2% of consumers have purchased organic food in
hypermarkets and fresh food supermarkets, respectively,
substantially higher than other formats. 37.0% of consumers
10 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
have purchased from online stores. *e standardization of
organic food, the ease of ordering of cold chain logistics, and
maturation are driving the rapid expansion of online
channel sales. *e pursuit of health and quality of life is the
motivation for these consumers to buy. When asked about
the motivation for buying organic food, 77.5% and 73.2% of
the respondents chose “health” and “quality assurance,”
which have become the golden sign and core competitive-
ness of organic food to expand market share. When selecting
organic food, 70%, 67%, and 65% of the respondents will
focus on “freshness,” “safety,” and “nutrition,” respectively.
*e lowest concern for “packaging,” only 27%, from a side to
reflect the proportion of self-consumption reached a con-
siderable level. Organic food is gradually integrated into
people’s lives. More than half of the respondents could not
distinguish or incorrectly distinguish between organic food,
green food, and other professional concepts. In addition,
when asked about the use of chemical fertilizers in the
organic food growing process, respondents also showed
“confusion,” indicating that the concept of organic food and
standards to be standardized and popularized. According to
the survey, the overall satisfaction of respondents with the
organic food market is high, with 21% and 58% of re-
spondents being “satisfied” and “relatively satisfied,” re-
spectively. When asked to improve the expected aspects,
“industry standard management,” “commodity richness,”
and “commodity quality” three top, were selected by the rate
of 58.7%, 54.8%, and 51.5%, respectively.
In the traditional organic food supply chain model,
starting from the organic food raw material planting,
through the organic food processing enterprises for pro-
duction, and then through the wholesale market, super-
markets, and other large intermediaries or retailer to deliver
the finished organic food to the hands of organic food
consumers. With the development of the Internet of *ings,
Internet, big data, cloud computing, and other information
technology, organic food processing enterprises and up-
stream farmers and downstream retail merchants to coop-
erate and dependent with each other. Information sharing
has been higher than before, but still not enough, and the
real supply chain member enterprises should be connected
together to form a synergistic and competitive whole.
A comparative analysis of the organic food supply chain
traceability system in the context of traditional IoT tech-
nology and blockchain technology summarizes the advan-
tages of adopting blockchain technology. Blockchain
technology meets the current urgent needs of the industry.
Blockchain is an innovative application mode of computer
technologies such as cryptographic algorithms, consensus
mechanisms, and distributed storage, and the combination
of blockchain technology and traceability systems can im-
prove the shortcomings of traditional organic food quality
and safety traceability systems.*e security of data is high in
the blockchain context. *e blockchain context is conducive
to the supervision and pursuit of responsibility and the fight
against counterfeiting.
Next, the profit prediction brought by blockchain
technology to each member of the organic food supply chain
is run in MATLAB R2021, implemented using a PC (CPU
Core i7 and 16G RAM). *e results obtained in the opti-
mization are presented in the next section. *e organic food
quality and safety traceability system in the context of
blockchain technology has many advantages, but the de-
velopment of promotion in blockchain also encounters some
obstacles, which makes it difficult to promote the blockchain
traceability system. On the one hand, without informatio-
nization in the whole process of organic food supply chain
circulation, there is no way to put information collection on
the chain. On the other hand, some large enterprises rec-
ognize the many benefits brought by blockchain and actively
adopt it, while Shanghai Dynamic Information System Co.,
Ltd. adopts blockchain because of its complicated tech-
nology, large investment, relatively high cost, and serious
old-fashioned thinking, and the adoption of blockchain
brings a relatively big impact on the traditional centralized
operation mode, which is also an important reason to
prevent SMEs from adopting blockchain. With the devel-
opment and promotion of blockchain technology, when
SMEs gradually realize the benefits brought by blockchain,
the full-scale promotion and application of blockchain will
become a reality.
5. Numerical Analysis
With the previous theoretical foreshadowing and formula
derivation basis, we will use an example to conduct an
empirical analysis of the previous research results. In co-
operation with Shanghai Energy Information System Co.,
Ltd. to conduct field research and analysis, the organic food
under the blockchain traceability scenario eliminates
counterfeit organic food, significantly improves the trust and
sales of products, and the cost of blockchain is not high.
*erefore, this chapter will verify the relevant results of the
investigation by assigning them. From the previous model
derivation, it can be seen that several parameters that can be
assigned in the model include: a, k, b, c, cB, e, μ, and λ.
Considering the reality, assign these parameters as follows:
a � 110, k � 20, b � 4, c � 1, cB � 1,e � 0.9, μ � 0.5, λ � 50,
and e, ε, σ ∈ [0, 1].
5.1.=e Impact of Organic Food Authenticity Rate μon Supply
Chain Profits. In the context of the traditional traceability
model, QN � 110 − 4pN, the genuine rate of organic food
μ � 0.5.
At this point, the producer’s profit is πN
m � (wN−
1)(110 − 4pN) − 8.1. *e retailer’s profit is πN
r � 0.5(110−
4pN)pN − (110 − 4pN)wN. *e optimal wholesale price,
optimal sales price, optimal profit of producers and retailers,
and total supply chain profit of organic food can be solved as
follows: wN∗ � 7.38, pN∗ � 34.88, πN∗
m � 162.56, πN∗
r �
81.28, and πN∗ � 243.84.
When the value of μ changes, it will have an impact on
the total profit of organic food manufacturers, retailers, and
supply chains as shown in Table 3.
Figure 2 shows that (1) with the increase in the authentic
rate μ of organic food, the overall profits of manufacturers,
retailers, and supply chains will increase. (2) *is shows that
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 11
even in the traditional supply chain model, increasing the
genuine rate of organic food can make the supply chain
more profitable. (3) Under the traditional model, it is not
easy to improve the genuine rate of organic food and make
consumers trust organic food.
5.2. =e Impact of Organic Degree e on Supply Chain Profits.
In the context of blockchain, the genuine rate of organic food
is μ � 1, and there is basically no fake and shoddy organic
food, e � 0.9.
At this point, the producer’s profit is
πB
m � (wB − 1)(− 4pB + 155) − 9.1. *e retailer’s profit is
πB
r � (pB − wB)(− 4pB + 155). *e optimal wholesale price,
the optimal selling price, the optimal profit of the producer
and the retailer, and the total profit of the supply chain can
be obtained as wB∗ � 19.88, pB∗ � 29.32, πB∗
m � 703.43,
πB∗
r � 356.27, and πB∗ � 1059.70.
By comparison, we can see that πB∗
m > πN∗
m , πB∗
r > πN∗
r ,
and πB∗ > πN∗ , the overall profits of manufacturers, retailers,
and supply chains are more in the context of blockchain,
which shows that the adoption of blockchain can bring
about an increase in the profits of all links in the supply
chain, and blockchain technology is worthwhile. Adopted
and promoted.
Figure 3 shows that (1) the total profit of organic food
producers, retailers, and supply chains under the blockchain
model is significantly higher than that of the traditional
model. (2) We study and analyze the relationship between
the organic degree e and the profit of the supply chain, and
we will get the optimal profit of the manufacturer, the re-
tailer, and the whole supply chain under different e con-
ditions. As the organic level e increases, the profits of the
main members of the supply chain also increase.
Comparing Tables 4 with 3, we can conclude that even
with the same authenticity rate and the same organic level,
the profit gained from adopting blockchain is always higher
than that of not adopting blockchain, *is also fully proves
that the blockchain should be adopted.
In order to more intuitively express the relationship
between the change of e and the change of supply chain
profit, MATLAB software is used for simulation as shown in
Figure 3.
5.3. =e Impact of Cost-Sharing and Revenue-Sharing Factors
on Supply Chain Profits. We consider using an improved
cost-sharing contract for further coordination, and on the
basis of the original cost-sharing contract, let the retailer give
ε proportion of the revenue to the manufacturer. At this
point, the profit function of the manufacturer and the re-
tailer is

that (1) supply chain coordination can be achieved when the
benefit-sharing factor ε and the cost-sharing factor σ satisfy
conditions. (2) In the interval of ε ∈ [0.494, 0.750],
σ ∈ [0, 1]; in other words, the value range is the shaded part
in the figure. (3) *e combined contract of revenue-sharing
and cost-sharing can achieve Pareto improvement, the or-
ganic food supply chain based on blockchain can be coor-
dinated, and all entities in the supply chain can achieve
optimal profits.
According to the current research status of supply chain
contracts, the way of benefit distribution and risk sharing
between suppliers and retailers, and the way of order ac-
quisition, supply chain contracts can be divided into the
following main types: pricing contracts, repurchase con-
tracts, quantity flexibility contracts, and revenue-sharing
contracts. Pricing contract means that the retailer decides
the order quantity according to the market demand and
wholesale price, the supplier and the manufacturer organize
the production according to the retailer’s order quantity, the
retailer is responsible for handling the inventory products,
and the retailer forecasts the product sales. *erefore, the
supplier’s profit is determined in this contract, and the
retailer fully assumes the risk of market uncertainty. *is
type of contract emerged earlier and is well developed and is
widely used in a number of fields. Such a supply chain
contract is very effective in markets with multiple (or
infinite) consecutive sales cycles. *is has now been built
upon in the form of price protection contracts, where the
supplier compensates the retailer for unsold goods when the
wholesale price of the product falls over the product’s life
cycle. *is type of covenant is often used in the field of
personal computers and cell phones.
A buy-back contract is one in which the supplier buys
back the remaining merchandise at the end of the sales
season at a certain price, and the retailer can decide for itself
whether to return all of the merchandise, with the supplier
forecasting product sales. *e supplier and the retailer share
the risk of market uncertainty. In addition, this strategy also
affects consumers, because before the emergence of this
supply-land contract, retailers usually used discount
promotions to dispose of surplus goods, and suppliers worry
that this approach will affect the status of their brands in the
minds of consumers, and damage their product brands,
especially in certain limited high-priced goods. Some
scholars fear that this behavior will harm the supplier’s
interests and ultimately lead to the nonviability of such
contracts, but research shows that the supplier’s interests
instead rise much higher as a result, because the number of
orders from retailers is often irrational under the incentive of
such contracts. *e repurchase contract is one of the most
convenient contracts to coordinate the supply chain because
of its ease of implementation between suppliers and retailers
and is naturally a hot topic of research.*is contract has also
given rise to other types of contracts, such as the sales rebate
contract, in which the retailer receives a rebate from the
supplier for each additional item sold after a certain number
of sales, in essence giving the retailer a direct incentive to
increase sales. It also provides an incentive for the retailer to
increase the order quantity and further improve the system
performance. Buy-back covenants are often applied in
seasonal commodity markets.
Quantity flexibility contracting is where the retailer
books a portion of the product prior to the start of the selling
season, the supplier organizes production accordingly, and
the retailer, having obtained a firm market demand, can
determine the final purchase volume within the quantity of
product that the supplier can provide to obtain the expected
revenue. Under the quantity elasticity contract approach,
two fluctuation limits are imposed: one is the maximum
fluctuation ratio per order period, and the supplier is then
obliged to meet the maximum upper limit of purchase
quantity to prevent losses caused by sellers increasing the
order quantity and resulting in supply chain shortages; the
other is the minimum lower limit of product quantity that
retailers must purchase to prevent sellers overestimating
demand and resulting in supply chain overcapacity. Under
these two constraints, a higher retailer order quantity
maximizes supply chain benefits and reduces the impact
caused by the dual marginal effects of suppliers and retailers.
*e purpose of quantity flexibility contracts is to make
buyers and sellers share the risk or benefits, and to induce
retailers to carefully forecast demand and plan order
quantities. Quantity elasticity contracts increase the average
quantity of goods purchased by the retailer, incentivize the
retailer to try to forecast market demand to increase their
desired profitability, and ultimately have the potential to
increase the overall effectiveness of the supply chain. Such
covenants are widely used in the electronics and computer
fields. It is widely used by large companies such as IBM.
One problem that is unavoidable in all of the above
supply chain contracts is that when the initial wholesale
price is too high, the producer will not be able to gain enough
benefit from a lower number of orders from the retailer, and
if the wholesale price is lowered in order to increase the
number of orders, it is equally likely to harm the benefits on
production. Revenue-sharing contracts are designed to re-
solve this conflict. In a revenue-sharing contract, the retailer
delivers a percentage of the sales revenue to the manufac-
turer in order to obtain a lower wholesale price. *is

mechanism not only provides an incentive for the retailer to
order more products at a lower price, but also ensures that
the manufacturer’s interests are not lost and that all parties
in the supply chain are coordinated. In this contract, both
parties share the market risk and the expectation of market
sales. However, the revenue-sharing contract cannot be
considered the best form of supply chain contract. It also has
certain limitations, mainly in two aspects: on the one hand, it
requires the seller to detect the buyer’s revenue, thus in-
creasing the overhead; on the other hand, because revenue-
sharing reduces the buyer’s marginal profit, it drives the
buyer to promote the sale of competing goods from other
suppliers that do not have a sharing contract. Such contracts
emerged with great success in the impression industry at the
end of the last century, and were then rapidly extended to
other industries.
In view of the limitations of single revenue-sharing
contracts, cost-sharing contracts were introduced on top of
revenue-sharing contracts. Cost-sharing contracts are
mostly used when there are common costs in the supply
chain, while revenue-sharing is mostly used in conjunction
with cost-sharing contracts to achieve supply chain coor-
dination more easily. In this study, we have to consider the
cost of blockchain, so by reading a lot of related literature, we
can conclude that the use of revenue-sharing and cost-
sharing contracts is applicable for this study. *e supplier
and the retailer share a percentage of the cost, while allowing
the retailer to put up a percentage of the revenue to the
supplier. In reality, a single revenue-sharing contract can
hardly solve the practical problems faced in the supply chain,
so a combination of revenue-sharing and cost-sharing
contract is designed to coordinate and thus solve the
problem of supply chain coordination. In addition, this
proposed combination contract is slightly more complex in
application compared to the traditional single contract.
*e advantages and disadvantages of the combined
revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contract proposed in this
study are compared with other traditional single contracts in
Table 5.
6. Managerial Insights and
Practical Implications
To a certain extent, our research results can provide a
theoretical reference for the coordinated management of
organic food supply chains in the blockchain context. For
organic food supply chains that adopt blockchain for
traceability, a combination of benefit-sharing and cost-
sharing contracts can be introduced to achieve supply chain
coordination. It also has some reference value for enterprises
that have not yet applied blockchain. At the same time, many
agricultural products have already applied blockchain for
traceability, and our research results and theories have some
guidance for the coordinated supply chain management of
other brands of agricultural products in the blockchain
context.
Driven by both national policies and the demand of the
organic food industry, many organic food companies will
also start to gradually adopt blockchain for traceability to
solve the distrust problem existing between supply chains,
promote supply chain unity and collaboration, and improve
supply chain performance in order to achieve supply chain
coordination and drive the organic food industry to con-
tinue to move forward. Our findings have practical guidance
for studying the coordination of organic food supply chains
in a blockchain context.
*rough our research results, it is recommended that
organic food enterprises that have not yet applied blockchain
traceability respond to the national call and meet the in-
dustry demand by actively adopting blockchain for the full
traceability of organic food, protecting the information
security of organic food, maintaining the brand image of
organic food, establishing trust between the upstream and
downstream supply chains, eliminating the inflow of fake
and shoddy organic food into the supply chain, and im-
proving the solidarity and collaboration between supply
chains. Nowadays, more and more organic food companies
are applying blockchain for traceability. For the coordinated
management of organic food supply chain in the context of
blockchain, we suggest introducing a combination of ben-
efit-sharing and cost-sharing contracts, so that the supply
chain can achieve optimal and win-win results.
7. Conclusions and Outlook
In recent years, the organic food supply chain has always had
the pain point of counterfeiting and shoddy, resulting in
distrust between the upstream and downstream of the
supply chain, thus affecting the cooperation and coordi-
nation of the supply chain. Under the premise that block-
chain technology is being promoted and applied, the
introduction of blockchain can reshape the trust between the
upstream and downstream of the organic food supply chain,
improve the efficiency of collaboration between supply
chains, and eliminate counterfeit and shoddy products. On
this basis, we propose a research on contract coordination of
organic food supply chain based on blockchain technology.
In the context of blockchain, the coordination of organic

food supply chain is studied, and appropriate contracts are
introduced to coordinate the supply chain, so that the supply
chain can reach the optimal state of coordination.
What we build is a secondary supply chain model
composed of manufacturers and retailers. With the back-
ground of blockchain, we conduct research on the coordi-
nation of supply chains.We establish the supply chainmodel
under the traditional model and the blockchain traceability
scenario, introduce the organic degree of food, establish its
relationship with market demand and blockchain input cost,
and then use the Stackelberg game to carry out analysis. By
comparing the traditional model under decentralized de-
cision-making and the model under the blockchain context,
it is found that the adoption of blockchain will increase the
profit of retailers, which is also in line with the actual sit-
uation.*ere is basically no fake and shoddy organic food in
the blockchain context, and it is very beneficial for retailers
to use blockchain technology to trace the origin of organic
food. Secondly, by studying the total profit of the supply
chain under the centralized decision-making of the supply
chain under the blockchain scenario, it is proved that the
supply chain under the decentralized decision-making has
not reached the optimal state, so further coordination is
needed to make the supply chain optimal. *erefore, we first
consider the introduction of cost-sharing contracts to co-
ordinate the supply chain. *e results show that under the
cost-sharing contract, the organic food supply chain can
maximize the profit of the supply chain, but the profit of the
producer is less than that without contract coordination. A
single cost-sharing contract cannot make the supply chain
achieve coordination. Adding a revenue-sharing contract to
the original cost-sharing contract, that is, considering
allowing organic food retailers to share a part of the revenue
with the manufacturer on the basis of the cost-sharing
contract. *e research results show that when the cost-
sharing factor and the revenue-sharing factor are in specific
when changing the range of organic food supply chain, it is
possible to achieve a coordinated state of organic food
supply chain, which is also an important conclusion of our
research.
*e results of this research andmanagerial insights are as
follows:
(1) *e increase in the genuine rate of organic food
under the traditional model will bring higher profits
to the supply chain (c.f. Table 3; Figure 2).*is shows
that even in the traditional supply chain model,
increasing the genuine rate of organic food can make
the supply chain more profitable.
(2) *e adoption of blockchain can not only improve the
genuine rate of products and combat counterfeit and
shoddy organic food, but also the increase in trust in
the context of blockchain will attract some con-
sumers to buy organic food, bringing additional
benefits to the supply chain.
(3) *e total profit of organic food producers, retailers,
and supply chains under the blockchain model is
significantly higher than that of the traditional
model. As the organic level increases, the profits of
the main members of the supply chain also increase
(c.f. Table 4; Figure 3).
(4) Comparing Tables 4 with 3, we can conclude that
even with the same authenticity rate and the same
organic level, the profit gained from adopting
blockchain is always higher than that of not adopting
blockchain,*is also fully proves that the blockchain
should be adopted.
(5) Supply chain coordination can be achieved when the
benefit-sharing factor and the cost-sharing factor
satisfy the conditions. *e combined contract of
revenue-sharing and cost-sharing can achieve Pareto
improvement, the organic food supply chain based
on blockchain can be coordinated, and all entities in
the supply chain can achieve optimal profits (c.f.
Figure 4).
*e uncertainty of demand in the organic food supply
chain and the costs of other aspects have not been taken into
account, which will be improved in follow-up research. *e
source of the blockchain data is not considered fraudulent.
Although the information already on the blockchain is real
and cannot be tampered with, the source of the data cannot
be fraudulently avoided. If the data itself is false, the
blockchain cannot identify and prevent it. How to ensure the
authenticity of source data is also one of the research di-
rections of blockchain applications in the future. On the
premise that blockchain technology is being vigorously
promoted and applied, the introduction of blockchain can
reshape the trust between upstream and downstream of the
organic food supply chain, improve the cooperation effi-
ciency between supply chains, and eliminate fake and
shoddy products. Finally, we suggest that organic food
enterprises actively adopt blockchain technology, which can
lead to an increase in the profits of all links of the supply
chain. Blockchain is worthy of adoption and promotion. In
conclusion, it should be noted that the analysis in this study
will help decision makers to choose the most appropriate
option among the possible solutions based on their criteria.
*is proposed framework can also be extended in various
cases where profits are out of balance in the organic food
supply chain, such as safety and value gain.

Proof of Lemma 1. Under the decentralized decision-
making of the traditional supply chain, organic food pro-
ducers and retailers each pursue the maximization of profits.
*erefore, from the perspective of maximizing the profits of
each member of the supply chain, we obtain zπN
r /zpN �
μ(a − 2bpN) + bwN and z2πN
r /z(pN)2 � − 2μb< 0. *ere-
fore, there is an optimal solution for πN
r , and the reverse
induction method is used to solve it, so that zπN
r /zpN � 0,
the optimal sales price pN∗ � μa + bwN/2bμ is obtained.
Substituting pN∗ into equation (1), which takes its second
partial derivative with respect to wN, we obtain
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 15
z2πN
m/z(wN)2 � − b/μ< 0, where πN
m is concave in wN.
Solving the first-order condition zπN
m/zwN � 0 for wN, we
obtain wN∗ � μa + bc/2b. Substituting both pN∗ and wN∗
into equations (1) and (2), we obtain πN∗
m � (μa − bc)2/8μb,
πN∗
r � (μa − bc)2/16μb, and πN∗ � 3(μa − bc)2/16μb. □
Proof of Lemma 2. From the perspective of maximizing the
profits of each member of the supply chain, we obtain
z2πB
r /z(pB)2 � − 2b< 0, where πB
r is concave in pB. Solving
the first-order condition zπB
r /zpB � 0 for pB, we obtain
pB∗ � a + λe + bwB/2b. Substituting pB∗ into equation (4),
which takes its second partial derivative with respect to wB,
we obtain z2πB
m/z(wB)2 � − b< 0, where πB
m is concave in wB.
Solving the first-order condition zπB
m/zwB � 0 for wB, we
obtain wB∗ � a + λe + bc/2b. Substituting both pB∗ and wB∗
into equations (4) and (5), we obtain πB∗
m �
(a + λe − bc)2/8b − cB − k/2e2, πB∗
r � (a + λe − bc)2/16b,
πB∗ � 3(a + λe − bc)2/16b − cB − k/2e2. □
Proof of Proposition 1. Based on Lemmas 1 and 2. By
subtracting the retailer’s profit under the blockchain model
from the retailer’s profit under the traditional model, we get
πB∗
r − πN∗
r � μ(a + λe − bc)2 − (μa − bc)2/16μb.
When μ � 1, the minimum value is obtained, where the
minimum value is greater than 0, that is, πB∗
r − πN∗
r > 0 is
always established, so πB∗
r > πN∗
r is always established. For
retailers, the adoption of blockchain is beneficial. *e profit
of retailers under the blockchain model is always greater
than that of retailers under the traditional model, which is
proved. □
Proof of Proposition 2. Based on Lemmas 1 and 2. Sub-
tracting the producer’s profit under the blockchain with the
producer’s profit under the traditional model, we get
πB∗
m − πN∗
m � μ(a + λe − bc)2 − (μa − bc)2/8μb − cB − k/2e2.
*is equation is greater than 0, which depends on the de-
mand gain brought by the organic preference of consumers
and the application cost of blockchain and the additional
green effort cost of producers. □
Proof of Proposition 3. Based on Lemmas 1 and 2. Sub-
tracting the total supply chain profit πB∗ under the block-
chain model and the total supply chain profit πN∗ under the
traditional model, we get πB∗ − πN∗ � 3[μ(a+ λe − bc)2 −
(μa − bc)2]/ 16μb − cB − k/2e2.
*e total profit of the supply chain under the blockchain
model is higher than the traditional situation, depending on
the relationship between cB, k, λ, and e. □
Proof of Corollary 1. Based on Proposition 3. To improve the
total profit of the supply chain after applying the blockchain,
in other words πB∗ ≥ πN∗ , we get 3(a + λe− bc)2/
16b − cB − ke2/2> 3(μa − bc)2/16μb, cB ≤ 3[μ(a + λe− bc)2−
(μa − bc)2]/16μb − ke2/2. □
Proof of Corollary 2. Based on Proposition 3. Similar to
Proofs of Corollary 1πB∗ ≤ πN∗ , after simplification, we get
cB ≥ 3[μ(a + λe − bc)2 − (μa − bc)2]/16μb − ke2/2. □
Proof of Lemma 3. Under the centralized model, organic
food producers and retailers are regarded as one decision-
making organization. *erefore, from the perspective of
maximizing the profit of the supply chain system, we obtain
z2πB/z(pB)2 � − 2b< 0, where πB is concave in pB. Solving
the first-order condition zπB/zpB � 0 for pB, we obtain
pB∗∗ � a + bc + λe/2b. Substituting pB∗∗ into the overall
supply chain profit πB, we get that under centralized deci-
sion-making, the optimal total supply chain profit is
πB∗∗ � (a − bc + λe)2/4b − cB − ke2/2. □
Proof of Lemma 4. Solving equation (10) for the second
partial derivative with respect to pB, we obtain
z2πB
r− CS/z(pB)2 � − 2b< 0, where πB
r− CS is concave in pB.
Solving the first-order condition zπB
r− CS/zpB � 0, for pB, we
obtain pB∗∗∗ � a + λe + bwB/2b and wB∗∗∗ � c,
Substituting both pB∗∗∗ and wB∗∗∗ into equations (9)
and (10), we obtain πB∗∗∗
m− CS � (σ − 1)(cB + ke2/2)≤ 0, πB∗∗∗
r− CS �
(a + λe − bc)2/4b − σ(cB + ke2/2), πB∗∗∗
CS � (a + λe− bc)2/
4b − cB − ke2/2 � πB∗∗ . □
Proof of Lemma 5. Solving equation (13) for the second
partial derivative with respect to pB, we obtain
z2πB
r− CSRS/z(pB)2 � − 2b(1 − ε)< 0, where πB
r− CSRS is concave
in pB. Solving the first-order condition zπB
r− CSRS/zpB � 0 for
pB, we obtain pB∗∗∗∗ � a + λe/2b + bwB/2b(1 − ε) and
wB∗∗∗∗ � c(1 − ε). Substituting both pB∗∗∗∗ and wB∗∗∗∗ into
equations (12) and (13), we obtain πB∗∗∗∗
m− CSRS � ε(a + λe− bc)2/
4b − (1 − σ)(cB + k/2e2), πB∗∗∗∗
r− CSRS � (1 − ε)(a + λe − bc)2/
4b − σ(cB + k/2e2), πB∗∗∗∗
CSRS � (a + λe − bc)2/4b− cB − k/
