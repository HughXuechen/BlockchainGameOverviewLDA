Abstract-Blockchain has broad application prospects in
Smart City, and the technical characteristics of the blockchain
itself can solve the problems of mistrust of network resource
production relations and unfair distribution of revenue.
However, most of the devices in Smart City are mobile devices
with insufficient resources . The demand for computing power of
the mining process cannot be met. For this , we introduce mobile
edge computing, deploy edge servers on the edge side, and
provide resources for mobile devices. We build an edge network
resource allocation model for mobile blockchain to realize the
effective application of blockchain technology in mobile
environments. The resources required by the mining process
can be obtained from neighboring resource sharing devices or
edge servers. The resource allocation between adjacent devices
can be modeled as a two-way auction model, and the Bayesian­
Nash equilibrium is solved to determine the optimal price, while
considering the trusted value of the device; the process of the
mobile device acquiring resources from the edge server can be
modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Finally, simulation
experiments show that this mechani sm achieves a higher
personal utility than an existing model that only considers
requesting resources from an edge server.

1. INTRODU CTION
With the advent of the 50 era, the Internet ofThings (loT)
technology has developed rapidly, and the smart city, smart
home, and smart grid derived from the loT technology have
also emerged [1-2]. The smart city aims to reduce public
management costs, make full use of public resources, and
improve living and working methods by using information
and communication technology (lCT). The smart city includes
multiple application scenarios such as waste management,
smart transportation, smart campuses and so on. In each
scenario, there are so many loT terminals that communicate
with each other and share data. Taking smart transportation as
an example, by deploying lots of terminal devices and
collecting traffic information, we can realize perception,
interconnection, analysis, prediction and control of traffic
conditions. However, at the same time, the following
problems exist. First, the cost of the link between the devices
is high, and it is difficult to establish trust, and the security
privacy has hidden dangers. Then, the network bandwidth of
the traditional centralized network is difficult to meet the
requirements of the huge intelligent terminals in the smart city
for data processing, and the cost is relatively high. The
blockchain provides a decentralized, trusted technical
paradigm that can solve the problems encountered in the
development of the smart city [3-4]. And the technical
characteristics of the blockchain itself can solve the problems
of mistrust of network resource production relations and
unfair distribution of revenue [5-7].
Due to the large number of terminal devices, when
introducing blockchain technology, the main-side-chain
architecture can be built to reduce the burden on the main
chain and improve data sharing efficiency [8-9]. Because the
proof of work (PoW) mechanism is more classic and be
widely used, we still use the public chain method to construct
the main-side-chain, and the terminals act as the participating
nodes of the blockchain to support the side chain operation
[10-11].
The key to ensure data integrity and validity in the
blockchain is a computational process defined as mining [12].
However, most terminals in the smart city are mobile, and
mobile devices cannot directly participate in the mining and
consensus process due to resource constraints, which makes
the application of blockchain technology in the smart city is
greatly limited. This prompted us to further rethink the mining
strategy and resource management in the mobile environment,
and meet new opportunities for the development ofblockchain
in mobile applications.
We can provide computing and communication resources
for mobile blockchain by deploying cloud computing services
on the "edge" side ofthe mobile internet [13-14]. Y. Jiao et aI.
modeled the resource allocation in edge computing as a two­
way auction process [I 5-16]. Y. Zhang et aI. proposed a game
model that considers edge computing as a network driver of
the mobile blockchain [17-18]. However, these tasks only
focus on the resource allocation between the mining devices
and the resource service provider, ignoring the situation that
the mobile device can request resources from the neighboring
resource sharing device, and the mining cost is higher.
Considering the above two situations, we can build a model
such that devices can not only access edge servers to gain
computing resources but also obtain idle computing resources
by cooperating with other mobile devices in the same local
area network [19]. The mining device can obtain the reward
of mining through the consensus mechanism, while the edge
server and the resource sharing device need to obtain

expressed as: Porphan(si) = 1 - e - AZSi . Where Si
represents the size of the block and z represents the delay
parameter. Obviously, the probability of successful mining
and dissemination of mining device i can be expressed as:
Pi(ai's;) = aiel - Porphan(s;)) = aie -AZSi (2)
After successful mining, the mining device will receive
certain mining rewards. The mining reward consists of fixed
reward R and variable reward r x Si' However, mining device
needs to pay resource fees to resource sharing devices and
edge server, so the personal utility of mining device can be
expressed as:
Ui = (R + r x si)Pi(ai. s.) - PiYi - AiBi - Lj PijCj (3)
The revenue of the resource-sharing device is mainly paid
by the mining device. The personal utility of the resource­
sharing device can be expressed as:
B. Resource allocation within the resource sharing network
Within the resource sharing network, the miner obtains the
computing resources of the resource sharing device through
competition. We model this process as a two-way auction
model.
In the two-way auction model, first, the buyers and the
sellers quote, and then the edge server adjusts the price
according to the trusted value of each node, and finally
executes the auction process, and the buyers and the sellers
conduct the transaction.
In our scenario, the mining devices are buyers and the
resource sharing devices are sellers.
Suppose that there are n buyers, m sellers, after the buyer
and the seller quote, the auction node will adjust the quotation
to the equivalent quotation according to the quotation and the
trust value. And the buyer (mining device) will be arranged in
descending order according to the equivalent quotation bi =
fb (ti)bi·The seller (resource sharing device) will be arranged
in ascending order according to the equivalent quotation s; =
fs(tj)sj .Then we look for a value k such that b~ > s~
and b~+1 < S~+l' Then, the kth buyer and the first k sellers
match the resources. Arrange LiZ,= IRZ- R~" in ascending
incentives from the miner node, thus generating pricing
problems of computing resources.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section we will give the system model and objective
formulation. Then how to solve the objective equation will be
shown in detail in the next section.
A. Network model overview
As shown in Fig.l the mobile devices can form a resource
sharing network with its neighboring devices. In the resource
sharing network, the blockchain node performs mining. When
the resource of the node are insufficient, it can be acquired
from the resource sharing devices. Miners can also request
resource from the edge servers when the resources in the
resource sharing network cannot meet the mining needs.
In the resource sharing network, there are N mining
devices N = {1,2. .... N}. The amount of resources required
by the mining device to complete the task is R =
{rl' rz• ...• rN}. The amount of resources that the mining device
itself has is A = {AI'Az, ... . AN}' There are M resource sharing
devices and the amount of resources each resource sharing
device has is C = {CI.CZ, ,,,,CN}' If the resource from the
resource sharing devices still cannot meet the mining demand,
it will be requested from the edge server. The amount of
resource requested from edge server is Yi = max{ri - Ai -
Lj'Cj.O} .where r, E[.!;,r] ,define !l as the amount of
resources that the mining device itself has and define r as the
maximum amount of resources that the edge server can
provide.
During the mining process, the miners competed to mine
to obtain new blocks. The relative computing power of mining
equipment i can be expressed as:
(1)
where 2:;ENa ; = 1 and Wi is miner's mmmg capacity
parameter. When a new block is successfully mined, it is
broadcast to the blockchain network and verified by other
miners to achieve consensus. After reaching a consensus, the
miners are considered to be successful in mining and receive
mining reward incentives. If the block propagation and
consensus time is too long, the block will become an isolated
block, and the probability of the isolated block can be
uJ= Li cJPij - cjBj
The profit of the edge server can be expressed as:
n = Li EN(Pi - B) Yi

order, taking the smallest Ll~ , then the kth buyer and the kth
sellers trade with each other, and the transaction price is
b~+ s~, . . b s b k
Pkk' =-2-' After the transaction, If Rk > Rk " Rk =Llk "
then remove k', and k enters the next round of auction, if
RZ < R~" R~, = Ll~" then remove k , and k' enters the next
round of auction until one party is empty, then the auction
ends.
For the buyer k, its benefits can be expressed as u b =
b~+ S' ,
Vk - __k_, where Vk represents the profit that the unit
2
resource can create for the buyer ; for the seller k', its benefits
can be expressed as U S = S k ' - Bk '» where Bk ' represents the
cost of the seller's unit resource consumption.
Since the buyer's bid is not public, they are unable to
understand the price strategy of others and will not know the
match until the auction ends. So it is a static game with
incomplete information, and Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
(BNE) exists. We analyze BNE to maximize the expected
utility .
For buyers, they maximize their own interests by adjusting
their bidding strategies :
maxb; u b = (Vi - bi) X P{bi 2:: sj(Bj)} (6)
For sellers, they maximize their revenue by adjusting the
asking price strategy:
these malicious nodes, the edge server will combine the trust
value of the node with the bid in the auction process to
transform into a comprehensive competitiveness based on the
historical integrity record to reduce the impact of malicious
nodes.
Let tj denote the credibility of the node j, which is
available from the algorithm l , and the trusted value tj takes
a value between °and l , which is dimensionless .
For the buyer, the higher the trusted value tj and the higher
the bid, the more competitive advantage; for the seller, the
higher the trusted value tj and the lower the asking price, the
more competitive advantage. Therefore, we cannot simply
multiply tj and quotation to obtain comprehensive
competitiveness. We use the price adjustment function to
calculate the comprehensive competitiveness of buyers and
sellers respectively, and use To to represent the benchmark
trust. The comprehensive competitiveness is equivalent to the
credible value. The unit price f(tj)pj is reported for the node
of To , where fO is a function of trust. The quotations of each
node with different trusted values are mapped to the
equivalent price under To , and the comprehensive
competitiveness is measured by the equivalent price.
For buyers, the price adjustment factor should satisfy:
1) When tj = 0, the equivalent quote is 0; when tj = To ,
the equivalent quote is unchanged, so we have
(7) (II)
C. Resource allocation between mining device s and the
edge server
The edge server is profitable by charging the fees paid by
the mining equipment. Therefore, its profit can be obtained
by payment of mining devices minus the cost of the edge
server's resources :
(8)
2) fb (tj )is continuously steerable, and the value does not
change .
3) fb(tj) increases monotonically, the larger the
confidence value tj is, the greater the comprehensive
competitiveness should be, so the adjustment factor should
also increase, ie
III. MODEL SOLVING
maxp n(p, r) = ~iEN(Pi - B)(ri - C) (10)
For the edge server, it wants to maximize the benefits
from miners :
(13)
(12)
4) Near To, the quotation adjustment is relatively small.
Correspondingly, fb(tj) should be relatively flat. When tj
approaches I, the comprehensive competitiveness should be
greatly increased, and the price adjustment coefficient
increases greatly, that is, when To < t j :s; 1, the derivative of
dfb is greater than 0. When t j approaches 0, the
dtj
comprehensive competitiveness should be greatly reduced,
and the price adjustment coefficient is greatly reduced , that is,
when °:s; tj < To The derivative of
d f b is less than zero. The

From the above conditions, we can first find the basic
elementary function fo(t) that meets the condition, and then
construct the price adjustment function fb ( tj ) by translating

In order to adjust the computing resource requirements
and usage prices, the process can be modeled as a
Stackelberg game.
For miner i , it adjusts its resource demand to maximize
its own personal utility by price Pi given by the edge server,
which can be expressed in the following mathematical
formula :
Where Pi can be a unified pricing, or it can be different
discriminatory pricing according to the different needs ofthe
miners.
A. Setting the price adjustmentfunction
During the mining process, some nodes will have some
malicious behavior. In order to reduce the competitiveness of

and scaling the fo(t). Here, we take the inverse hyperbolic
tangent function as fo(t) :
fo(t) = arctan h(t) = 0.5 In(1 + t) 1(1 - t) (14)
Then, first fo(t) is stretched (1 + c:)To times, and then
translational transformation. We can get:
Bring the above two formulas into (20), and (20)can be
rewritten as follows:
1 [ 1 ] bi - (lis + ks x Pmin)
m axb,{vi -"2 b, +"2(bi + lis + {s X Pmin) l : (P _ P . )k

Solving the first derivative and the second derivative of
(24) and (25), we can find that the function is a concave
function, so that the first derivative is equal to 0, the following
results can be obtained:
C. Stackelberg Game
In this section, we propose the discriminatory pricing for
resource management in the mobile blockchain, in which edge
server can set different unit prices for the resource needs of
different miners, which is P = (PI' P2' ...,PN ) .
(1) Miners demand game : r = {N, (ri)iEN' (U;)iEN}
Similar to the proof process in [17], the Nash equilibrium
ofminers' demand game exists and is unique. Similarly, in the
miner's demand game r = {N, (r;)iEN' (U;)iEN} , the unique
Nash equilibrium ofminer i is given by :
p ·e Azs i
Where , ~f = (J ) .R+rsj Wj
(2) Edge server profit maximization
Theorem 1. Under the discriminatory pricing scheme,
when ri E [ri ' f], there is a unique optimal bidding strategy
that maximizes the profitability of the edge server.
Proof. First, take the equation (39) into the equation (10),
and then calculate the first derivative of Il with respect to Pi in
equation (10) .
Substituting equations (17) and (18) into the above
equations, we can find the equilibrium point:
Bringing the equilibrium point into (17) and (18) can get
the best bidding strategy for buyers and sellers . The buyer's
best bidding strategy is linear with the resource value . The best
bid strategy is linear with resource costs.
(19)
Equations (6) and (7) can be rewritten to take into account
the nature of the uniform distribution:
maXbi{Vi - ~ [bi + E (Sj(Bj)lbi ;::: Sj(Bj))]} . P{bi ;:::
SiBj)}
b, = 17b + k b X Vi (17)
Where Vi is the value of completing the unit task, Vi =
(R + r x s i)Pi(ai,si)lf3i '
The seller considers the cost of the unit resource as the
basis for the asking price, so the seller's bidding strategy can
be expressed as:
(20)
1
maxsjfZ[Sj + E(Mv;)lbi(Vi);::: Sj)]- Bj}' P{MVi)
;::: Sj}
Sj = 17s + ks x Bj (18)
Based on historical transaction records, we assume that the
largest auction price available is Pm ax and the minimum
allowed auction price is Pm in' Assume that the cost and profit
ofunit resources follow a uniform distribution:
Bj-u[Pm in, Pm ax]
B. Double auction model
According to the double auction model listed above, we
obtain the best auction price in the self-organizing network by
calculating Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) ..
To simplify the auction process, we assume that the
mining device (buyer) and the resource sharing device (seller)
are bidding in a linear strategy. Buyers must consider the value
of computing resources as a basis for bidding before
participating in an auction, so the bidding strategy can be
expressed as:

Fig. 2. Impact of the number ofminers on auction prices.
As shown in Fig.3, under the differentiated pricing, the
optimal price is slightly lower than the highest price, and
gradually approaches the limit as the density of miners
increases. Due to differentiated pricing, the edge server can
dynamically adjust the optimal price based on different
resource requirements. And the competition of more miners
will push up the best price.

Since the second derivative of Il with respect to Pi (42)
and the second-order partial derivatives (43) for Pi and Pj are
both less than 0, the Hessian matrix of Il(p) is semi-negative.
Therefore, Il (p) is a concave function and there is a unique
optimal price vector for maximum profit.
IV. SIMULATION
In this section, we simulate the algorithm to evaluate the
performance of the resource allocation mechanism for mobile
blockchain proposed in this paper. We use Hyperledger Fabric
version 1.4 to build the blockchain and use Fabric chaincode
to write smart contracts. In the simulation, we set 100 resource
nodes in the resource sharing network, in which there are 60
mining nodes.
Firstly, we change parameters to study the impact on
miners and the edge server's earnings. Secondly, the
mechanism studied in this paper and the pricing-based edge
computing resource management method (PECRM) in the
literature [17] are compared to study the benefits of miners
and the edge server under the two methods.
As shown in Fig.2 , in terms of the number of miners, the
auction price within the resource sharing network decreases as
the number of miners increases, as the mining device will bid
based on its expected profit. As the number ofmining devices
increases, the number of resource-sharing devices decreases,
so that the amount of available resources decreases, and
expected profit reduction. At the same time, as the delay effect

Then we compare the individual utility ofthe miners under
our mechanism and the PECRM mechanism, considering the
effects of delay effects and unit returns under differentiated
pricing. According to Fig.4 , the miner's personal utility under
this mechanism is slightly higher than that ofPECRM. This is
because that we support mining device to request resource
from neighboring mobile devices in the resource sharing
network. The top image shows that the higher the unit reward,
the higher the utility of the miner. The bottom image shows
that under different delay effects, the advantages of this
mechanism are still higher than PECRM.
We also observed the trend ofedge server profits under the
mechanism and PECRM with delay effects and unit rewards.

V. CONCLUSION
In order to realize the application of blockchain in the
smart city, we design and study a kind of edge network
resource allocation mechanism for mobile blockchain, which
aims to make up for the shortage of resources of mobile
devices itself to support the mining process. In this paper, we
aim at maximizing system revenue and being constrained by
edge network resources constraints to design an edge network
resource allocation mechanism for mobile blockchain. Finally,
through simulation experiments, we can see that the
mechanism we designed has higher personal benefits for
miners. However, we simplified the actual network
environment during the research process, and only considered
a simple static environment. To be applied to reality, the next
step is to consider more actual network requirements, such as
the mobility of each node, dynamic access, dynamic exit, and
other issues to further improve the mechanism.
According to Fig.5, the edge server's profit increases with the
increase of unit rewards, because higher unit rewards
stimulate more resource demand. Conversely, as the delay
effect increases, the edge server's profit decreases. As the
delay effect increases, the miners' resource requirements
decrease, which reduces the profit of edge server. We also
compare the edge server's profits under this mechanism with
PECRM. Due to the increased internal resources sharing in the
resource sharing network, the mining cost is reduced, and the
resource demand to edge server is less. Therefore, the profit
of edge server under this mechanism is lower than that of
PECRM. This is reasonable because this article is more
focused on determining the optimal resource allocation and
getting the miner's maximum profit based on the optimal price
of the edge server.
