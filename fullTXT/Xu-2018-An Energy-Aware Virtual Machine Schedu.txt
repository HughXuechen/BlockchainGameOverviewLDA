An Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Scheduling Method for Cloudlets in Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks
Abstract  Currently, mobile applications, such as 
interactive gaming, virtual reality, and natural language 
processing, are becoming more computational intensive, but 
the computing capacity of mobile devices is limited. An 
effective way to solve this problem is offloading the tasks to 
nearby cloudlets, which are some small mobile data centers 
deployed in wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). and 
consume a large amount of energy. Excessive energy 
consumption brings about some negative effects, including 
increased carbon dioxide emissions, aggravating the 
greenhouse effect, etc In view of this challenge, we propose 
an energy-aware virtual machine (VM) scheduling method 
for cloudlets in WMAN. Technically, an optimization model is 
designed to formalize our problem. Then, based on VM Live 
Migration Technology, a corresponding energy saving VM 
scheduling method abbreviated as MFEA is proposed to 
determine which VMs should be migrated and where they 
should be migrated. Finally, experimental data demonstrate 
that the proposed method is effective.
