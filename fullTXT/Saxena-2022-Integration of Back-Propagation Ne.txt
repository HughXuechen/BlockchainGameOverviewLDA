Abstract Bitcoin is a decentralized, pseudonymous cryptocurrency that has become
one among the most demanded digital assets to date. Because of its uncontrolled
nature and users’ inherent anonymity, it has seen a significant surge in its use for
illegal operations. As a result, numerous systems for characterizing diversified enti-
ties across the Bitcoin network must be developed. In this work, we offer a way
for breaking Bitcoin anonymity using a revolutionary cascade machine learning
model that only utilizes a few features taken straight from Bitcoin blockchain data.
We gathered approximately 29 million samples from diverse sources and gener-
ated data for four different entities: exchanges, gambling, pools, and services. On
a dataset balanced using SMOTE and weight of the entities, the back-propagation
neural network (BPNN) model was trained and tested. Cross-validation accuracy
has been utilized to evaluate the model’s accuracy. On the dataset balanced using the
weight of the entities, the BPNN model classified the entities with 71.51%, while
with SMOTE, the accuracy of classification is 71.22%.

1 Introduction
Bitcoin was coined in 2008, and it has since risen to become the most successful
cryptographic money among multiple competitors, boosting the economy by the
huge sum of money within only a few years. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency that
is made up of a series of computer codes that have a monetary value. All transactions

and payments are completed over the Internet in this setting. Bitcoin differs from
traditional Internet transactions in that it is based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network
that is not linked to a centralized third-party organization, such as an e-bank, a notary,
or any other traditional online financial service provider that supervises, monitors,
and approves electronic payment transactions. Instead, Bitcoin users have absolute
power over what theywant to dowith their ownmoney because theymay freely order
how and when to utilize digital money. Bitcoin has grown in popularity, attracting an
increasing number of customers who want to use it as a payment option in numerous
organizations. Bitcoin is frequently described as being “quick,” “convenient,” “tax-
free,” and “revolutionary.”
Bitcoin was, and still is, referred to as an anonymous currency in some contexts.
Although Bitcoin addresses, unlike traditional financial systems, has nothing to do
with any real-world identity at the protocol level, this fact does not guarantee great
anonymity. Bitcoin transactions are broadcast in cleartext over a peer-to-peer network
and then stored in a massively replicated shared database after being confirmed by
miners. A common technique to improve Bitcoin privacy is to use a different address
for each transaction.
Illegal laundering of money and financing terrorism have been linked to Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies [1, 2], as well as the online drug trade [3]. On the online
black marketplaces like Silk Road 3, Alpha Bay, and Valhalla, cryptocurrencies
have been linked to cybercriminal behaviors. Consumers can use Bitcoins to buy
cybercrime-as-a-service, hacking tools, malware, stolen credit card information, and
compromised login and password combinations, for example.
Bitcoin is frequently used to propagate ransomware around the world. WannaCry,
a ransomware attack that began in May 2017, spread fast around the world. In a few
hours, WannaCry labeled “the worst ransomware outbreak in history,” infected over
300,000 machines in 150 countries. This attack was extremely destructive since
it was a worm that looked for new computers and systems to infect, rather than
just a ransomware application. WannaCry encrypts all files on infected devices,
rendering them unreachable to the victim until the culprit is paid at least $300
in Bitcoin (s). The ransomware payments were received using three hardcoded
Bitcoin addresses/wallets. A total of 335 payments, totaling 51.91182371 Bitcoin
or US$144,010.54, has been sent into the three Bitcoin wallets as of June 20, 2017.
Such obstacles and challenges, unfortunately, still exist today. Due to its features,
particularly its pseudo-anonymity, Bitcoin has become the preferred payment system
for illicit activities. Bitcoin transactions are linked to public keys or addresses rather
than real-world identities, and the latter does not require any verified personal data
to create. While some enterprises openly provide their addresses when it is essen-
tial to delivering their services, others hide their spending habits by using privacy-
enhancing payment channels or mixing services. This is a regular occurrence in
entities associated with tor markets, ransom payments, frauds, and thievery.
The purpose of this study is to investigate if an uncovered cluster can be clas-
sified into one of the categories of exchange, gambling, hosted wallet, merchant
services, mining pool, mixing, ransomware, fraud, tor market, or others. This
study will increase the transparency of the ecosystem, encouraging businesses and

consumers to utilize Bitcoin as a payment method and expand the economy without
resorting to criminal actions. This research works reviewed in this paper focus on
the classification of Bitcoin addresses based on their activity.
The remainder of the paper contributes as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the related
work, followed by a discussion of conceptual overview of the research in Sect. 3.
Section 4 gives an overview of the data preparation procedure; Sect. 5 suggests
the methodology adopted in the study. The results obtained are outlined in Sect. 6,
followed by the conclusion and future scope in Sect. 7.
2 Related Work
Several publications have attempted to disprove Bitcoin’s alleged pseudo-anonymity.
The first way of breaking down Bitcoin’s anonymity used network analytical tech-
niques over addresses mixed with open-source data from Wikileaks, demonstrating
that Bitcoin user addresses can be connected [4]. A subsequent technique required
direct interaction with the network by submitting transactions and clustering public
keys using co-spend algorithms, which led to the discovery of 1.9 million Bitcoin
addresses related to real entities or pseudo-identities [5].Using anopen-source frame-
work, the Bitcoin blockchain was processed; public keys were clustered; clusters
were tagged, and the network was shown. The systemwas able to identify an address
holding 111,114 BTC pertaining to a Silk Road cold wallet and precisely estimate
ransoms delivered to CryptoLocker using only an address provided by a victim on a
forum as a lead [6]. Another techniquewas to use statistical analysis to figure out how
its users behaved when sending, receiving, and keeping money. Unlike large portions
of transactions moving minimal quantities of coins and the specific subject of study,
countless numbers of transactions sending more than 50,000 BTC all at once, this
approach discovered that the vast majority of coins remain hidden in addresses that
haven’t been associated in outgoing transactions [7]. The k-means algorithm was
used to cluster a portion of the Bitcoin blockchain with the purpose of detecting
anomalous behavior, uncovering anomalous transactions, and detecting abnormal
behavior from some clients suspected of money laundering [8]. In [9], the authors
developed a method for correlating Bitcoin users’ pseudonyms behind NAT with
the public IP address of the host where the transaction is generated. The attack’s
goal was to use one octet of outbound connections to identify each client. Even if
they connect to the Bitcoin network via Tor, the approach outlined in [10] linked the
sessions of unreachable nodes. The authors do this by employing a novel method
that organizes block requests made by nodes in a Bitcoin session graph. The modi-
fied Bitcoin client is likewise vulnerable to this attack [10]. A transaction clustering
approach was presented and executed based on the analysis of propagation times
on four popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Zcash, Dash, and Monero [11]. Biryukov
and Tikhomirov [12] was the first to analyze the prevalence of cybercriminal entities
in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They trained unsupervised machine learning classifiers
526 R. Saxena et al.
using the dataset provided by the data provider, which used three methods of clus-
tering Bitcoin transactions to categorize entities: co-spend, intelligence-based, and
behavior-based.Amulticlass classificationonBitcoinblockchain clusterswas carried
out with the objective of seeing if supervised machine learning algorithms could be
helpful to predict the category of an undiscovered cluster given a set of previously
recognized clusters as training data [13]. On the basis of transaction history summa-
rization, a multiclass service identification technique in Bitcoin was presented. For
improved identification, the suggested technique gets transaction history and anal-
yses the working of the retrieved transactions [14]. Transaction history summary for
Bitcoin addresses and entity classification was included as new features. To create
a model for machine learning classification for detecting abnormalities of Bitcoin
network addresses, the transaction history summarywas composed of basic statistics,
supplementary statistics, and transaction moments [15]. A cascade machine learning
model combinedwith a sufficient collection of input attributes directly extracted from
Bitcoin blockchain data was used to demonstrate a technique to challenge Bitcoin
anonymity through entity characterization [16].
3 Conceptual Overview
3.1 Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrency is conceivably the most secured form of digital money exchange,
as it is built on a decentralized network via the Internet and uses cryptography to
perform financial transactions. Although the conceptual theory behind the cryptocur-
rency technology was proposed in 1991 [17], it was only introduced to the world in
2009 as bitcoin [18]. Unlike traditional money exchange systems, bitcoin relies on
a dispersed network of nodes known as miners to keep track of transactions. Each
mining node maintains a list of transactions in blocks, each of which contains the
preceding block’s SHA 256 cryptographic hash. Because this process is persistent,
and transaction blocks are stored in all nodes, it is almost difficult to change it. Each
node checks all transaction history before committing any transaction to validate
that the amount to be sent is correct. Following validation, each transaction in a
block conducts repeated hashing procedures using the sender’s public key and the
preceding transaction’s hash value.
3.2 Anonymity
Anonymity is defined as a way of obtaining “freedom from identification, conceal-
ment, and lack of distinction” [19], and it can also be defined as a phenomenon
in which one can conceal one’s identity from others [20]. With the advent of the
Integration of Back-Propagation Neural Network to Classify … 527
Internet and subsequent advancements in electronic commerce, communications,
and social media, as well as developments like Web 2.0, there is indeed a growing
discussion regarding anonymity, particularly in online environments. The proponents
of anonymity see online anonymity as an essential tool for preserving information
privacy by shielding personal data from untrustworthy platforms and parties [20].
Anonymity, on the other hand, is regularly exploited, creating a climate conducive
to hate speech and libelous remarks by those who act irresponsibly with impunity
[20, 21]. Communications over the Internet can be formed with a high degree of
certainty, hiding the identity of the communication’s source, thanks to the develop-
ment of public-key cryptography and software agents in the 1990s, such as anony-
mous remailer servers [22]. These techniques cleared the ground for the formation
of pseudonymous entities in Internet communication, which can send and receive
messages while keeping the originator’s identity hidden. Pseudonymity varies from
anonymity in that anonymity demands the complete elimination of all identification
information, whereas pseudonymity allows for the construction and maintenance
of a pseudo/alternate identity, allowing for partial concealing of the true identity
information [19, 23].
3.3 Entity Categorization
One of the most active kinds of enterprises is the exchange, which is a global digital
marketplace, wherein traders can trade cryptocurrencies using different fiat (money
made legal tender by a government edict) or other digital currencies. As stated in
[24], exchanges serve as the “front and exit doors” to the bitcoin realm and are
perfect for concealing unlawful activities. The darknet market is another option.
These are online marketplaces where users can buy narcotics, ammunition, and other
commodities and services that are prohibited in most nations. These crypto-markets
promote legal and illegal transactions among their customers by using electronic
currencies [25]. Furthermore, as described in [26], so-called mixers are services
that allow users to obfuscate processes. Mixed transactions, on the other hand, boost
user privacy and can be used to launder unlawful payments. A few more categories
are listed in [12] which are gambling, an entity that provides Bitcoin-accepting
gambling services, such as Lucky Games and Nitrogen Sports. In exchange for
a reward proportional to their contribution to a block’s solution, mining pools are
madeupof distributedminers that pool their processing power over amining network.
AntPool and BTC Top are two examples.

4 Data Preparation
The dataset for this study was gathered from the Blockchair and WalletExplorer
repositories. Samples for three months were chosen for the study, namely December
2020, November 2020, and January 2021.
4.1 Raw Dataset
Blockchair is a blockchain explorer which has the dumps for the cryptocurren-
cies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin-SV, and
ZCash. The transaction dataset collected from the Blockchair comprises of block_id,
hash, time, size, weight, version, lock_time, is_coinbase, has_witness, input_count,
output_count, input_total, output_total, input_total_usd, output_total_usd, fee,
fee_used, fee_per_kb, fee_per_kb_usd, fee_kb_kwu fee_per_kwu_usd, cdd_total.
WalletExplorer is a bitcoin explorer with address grouping and wallet labeling.
The transaction dataset collected from this repository contains date, received from,
received amount, sent amount, sent to, balance, and transaction.
4.2 Data Preprocessing
When considered separately, the features in both the dataset were insufficient for both
training and testing. Tomake the best use of the collected dataset, the features of both
datasets were merged on the basis of transaction hash. After merging, 29,228,184
feature-rich samples were obtained. Out of 29,228,184 samples, 427,625 samples
were be labeled. The available labeled entities were exchange, gambling, mining
pool, mixing services.
4.3 Data Cleaning
The labeled dataset thus obtained was cleaned by performing the following tasks:
a .Handling null and infinite values: Deep learning models do not handle the null
and infinite values; therefore, such samples were dropped.
b .Encoding string values to integer: Using the encoder library of scikit-learn,
string valueswere encoded to an integer tomake themadaptable for deep learning
models.

4.4 Selection of Features
The transaction hash is generated randomly corresponding to the transaction
performed by the Bitcoin users. Because of this random nature, they were dropped.
Moreover, few features such as block_id were of low co-relation and were not partic-
ipating in the training and testing of a classification model. Hence, they were also
removed. The features which got selected are as follows: label, size, weight, version,
lock_time, is_coinbase, has_witness, input_count, output_count, inout_total_usd,
output_total_usd, fee_usd, fee_per_kb_usd, fee_per_kwu_usd, cdd_total, rec/sent,
amount. At this step, the dataset is now ready for training and testing.
5 Methodology
To classify and predict the accuracy of the classification, the dataset obtained was
trained and tested over the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and evaluated
on cross-validation (CV) accuracy.
5.1 Balancing of Classes/Entities
In the dataset of 427,625 samples, the entity exchanged had the majority of samples
335,847, i.e., 78.53%, while the entity gambling had merely 2254 samples which
were 0.53% of the total samples. This led to the issue of class imbalance. To handle
this issue, SMOTE [27] and the weight of the entities are employed. SMOTE stands
for syntheticminority oversampling techniquewhich produces synthetic samples for
theminority classes so that the utilization of imbalanced classes can be enhanced. The
other technique, i.e., the weight of the entities oversamples the minority classes and
under-samples majority classes so that there’s a uniform distribution of samples of
all four entities. The weight of an entity was calculated using the following formulae:
wi = n/(k ∗ ni )
where.
wi the weight of the entity i,
n number of dataset samples,
k number of dataset entities,
ni number of dataset samples of entity i
With this approach, samples of mining pool, gambling, and mixing services were
oversampled while that of exchange was under-sampled.

5.2 Training and Testing of Model
In this study, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was validated using
the SMOTE and weight of entities techniques on balanced dataset samples. The
y-axis had the labels (exchange, pool, services, and gaming), whereas the X-axis
contains the remaining attributes. Samples from the training and testing datasets are
distributed 60% and 40%, respectively. Both approaches were trained and tested
using the TensorFlow libraries on Google’s colaboratory.
6 Result
The BPNNwas trained and tested to classify the entities and predict the CV accuracy.
Themodelwas trained for the dataset samples prepared using SMOTE and theweight
of the entities. The classification of entities is shown in Fig. 1, while the results
obtained on training and testing of the model are as shown in Table 1.
From Table 1, it is evident that the class balancing carried out using the weight
of the entities is giving a slightly better prediction than SMOTE strategy with the
exception that the number of samples trained using SMOTE is more than that of the
weight of the entities.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
Back propagation neural networks were trained on dataset samples of Bitcoin trans-
actions obtained from the Blockchair and WalletExplorer repositories for this study.
The transaction hash was then used to merge it. The issue of class imbalance was
overcome by carrying out necessary oversampling using SMOTE and oversampling
and under-sampling as required using the weight of the entities. The model was
evaluated for both the approaches of class balancing on the basis of cross-validation
accuracy. The strategy of the weight of the entities seems to be more accurate in
comparison to SMOTE.
The accuracy of the model can be enhanced by developing a hybrid approach
employing the heuristics on the existing model. Moreover, the availability of cluster
is also the limitation of the research; therefore, available datasets can be clustered
that can widen the scope of the research.
