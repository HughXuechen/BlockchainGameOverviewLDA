Abstract— Leading experts from academic, industrial and 
policy-making circles describe Blockchain as a disruptive and 
game changing technology across various sectors. However, the 
question, whether Blockchain does already have the properties of 
a General Purpose Technology (GPT) and, as such, will determine 
macroeconomic dynamics in the next decades, has been 
disregarded in the academic literature. This paper covers the 
research gap by systematically revealing the acknowledged 
features of a GPT – pervasiveness, innovation spawning effects 
and scope for improvement – in the newest available Blockchain-
related patent data from PATSTAT. To gain insights about 
pervasiveness, (1) a generality index of Blockchain is compared to 
respective values of co-existing technologies usually considered 
(information and communication technology) and not considered 
(pharmaceutical technology) GPTs. The second feature, 
innovation spawning is dissected (2) analyzing variety of 
innovators patenting in Blockchain domain and (3) looking at 
firms’ behavior in terms of entry and exit in line with industrial 
dynamics. (4) Investigation of evolution patterns of Blockchain 
patents provides insights about its scope for improvement. The 
empirical analysis advances the claim that Blockchain does 
already represent a GPT in the making and, therefore, has a 
potential to shape a technological era and cause substantial 
changes in the economic, social and institutional structures.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Over the course of the history, several key technologies, such 
as electricity, steam engine, information and communication 
technology, nanotechnology to name the few, had a significant 
impact on the economy and led to substantial changes in 
institutional structures, industrial dynamics, allocation of 
resources, and skill requirements [15]. In economic literature, 
these technologies are defined as general-purpose technologies, 
or GPTs [1]. Despite the large amount of conceptual literature 
focusing on disruptive potential of Blockchain across various 
industries [18], there is still a lack of empirical evidence, 
whether this technology does indeed have a GPT nature [37]. 
However, a systematic identification of a GPT nature of an 
emerging technology represents an important task that builds the 
basis for further scientific discourse and is of high relevance for 
industrial and policy making circles because of several reasons 
[32], [36]. First, it assists policy makers in effective design of 
technology enhancement policies and supports practitioners in 
deciding allocation of resources between existing technologies 
and a new GPT [36]. Second, GPTs have a long-lasting effect 
on macroeconomic indicators, such as productivity, skill 
premium, and industrial dynamics in terms of entry and exit 
[13]. Therefore, early identification of a GPT in the making 
provides insights into economic changes in the subsequent years 
[36] and allows to prepare for major changes in the economic, 
political and societal structures caused by this GPT [15]. 
The paper at hand provides, to the best of the author’s 
knowledge, the first complete quantitative assessment of the 
GPT nature of Blockchain in line with the GPT, industrial 
dynamics and technology management literature. The rest of the 
paper is structured as following. A presentation of the relevant 
literature on GPTs and Blockchain in the next section is 
followed by explanation of data source and employed 
methodology. The empirical evidence for all the three 
acknowledged features of a GPT – pervasiveness, innovation 
spawning effects and scope for improvement [1] – in 
Blockchain-related patent data is provided in the results section. 
Discussion of the economic implications of the study and 
possible directions for the further research conclude.  
II. RELEVANT LITERATURE 
A. General-Purpose Technologies 
The term ‘General Purpose Technologies’, or GPTs, was 
introduced in the economic literature by Bresnahan and 
Trajtenberg [1] to define key technologies that benefit a wide 
range of industries, initiate innovations in other fields, and shape 
the macroeconomic dynamics in a long term. The basic idea 
behind the GPT concept that “major technological changes are 
the main determinants of cyclical and non-linear patterns in the 
evolution of the economy” [2] appeared long before the term 
GPT has been coined. For example, [27] noticed that drastic 
innovations can lead to a long wave of economic development, 
and [17] referred to ‘macro inventions’ that cause long-run 
economic growth. 
There are three widely acknowledged necessary features for 
a technology to be regarded a GPT: pervasiveness, innovation

spawning effects, and scope for improvement [1], [13], [32], 
[36]. Pervasiveness means applicability of a GPT across 
numerous industries [15]. Innovation spawning effects refer to 
its ability to give rise to complementary innovations in the 
downstream application sectors. Advancements in the fields of 
application also trigger further development of a GPT itself – 
this two-sided relation is known as a ‘dual inducement 
mechanism’ [1] or a ‘GPT reciprocal causality model’ [28]. 
Since GPTs do not offer final solutions but rather act as 
‘enabling mechanisms’ for innovations in the downstream 
application areas [1], their implementation in the application 
fields and development of complementary technologies play a 
crucial role in the GPT evolution. The third defining feature of 
a GPT - a scope for improvement – has a two-fold definition in 
the literature. Some scholars define scope for improvement as a 
permanent technological development at every stage of the 
value chain [32], whereas others mean by it benefits offered by 
a GPT [13], [28]. It is important to mention, that a GPT has all 
three of these features, since any technology might have at least 
one of the characteristics [36]. 
Numerous scholars dedicated their works to assessment of 
the GPT nature of certain technologies. [4], [10], and [13] 
consider information and communication Technology (ICT) as 
a classic example for a GPT that shaped the economy. 
Nanotechnology is addressed as an emerging GPT due to its 
pervasiveness and significant scope for improvement in the [9], 
[21], [28], [32], and [36]. [33] argues that Artificial Intelligence 
causes innovations in a wide range of applications sectors and, 
therefore, has a potential to become a new GPT in the near 
future. [15] provide a list of 24 transforming GPTs over the 
history, including printing, steam engine, electricity, railways, 
lean production, internet, and nanotechnology. Some of these 
GPTs were introduced exogenously to the economic system, the 
development of others was endogenous; some can be classified 
as process technologies, whereas others as product and 
organizational technologies. However, all of them share a high 
degree of pervasiveness, cause technological complementarities 
in downstream sectors, and have a scope for improvement [15]. 
There are also examples of some disruptive technologies in 
the literature that, however, do not fit into the definition of GPT 
due to the relatively low pervasiveness: gunpowder technology 
[15], combustion engine [32], and pharmaceutical technology 
[36] to name the few.  
B. Blockchain as a GPT 
Although Bitcoin White Paper first appeared in 2008 [19], 
its main technological pillars - public key cryptography, game 
theory and distributed computation – have been a subject of 
active scientific investigation over the past decades. The 
combination of these disciplines resulted in an innovative 
technology with a disruptive potential [25]. Blockchain has a 
number of functional features, such as decentralization, 
auditability and persistency, which make this technology 
potentially beneficial for a broad range of industrial fields [37]. 
Because of its possibility to ensure security of transactions 
between mistrusting actors without involvement of the trusted 
third party, scholars addressed potential of Blockchain to 
fundamentally change the intraorganizational business 
processes [16]. Many scholars acknowledge that with the 
introduction of smart contracts, the potential applications of 
Blockchain technology became infinite [25].  
Proofs of concept for Blockchain use cases exist, among 
others, in supply chain tracking, governmental processes, 
financial transactions, construction project management, energy 
management and distribution, healthcare, identity management, 
tax collection, consumer electronic industry, insurance, and 
sustainability challenges [25]. [37] categorized potential 
Blockchain use cases into financial applications, Internet of 
Things, security, public service and reputation systems. [25] 
revised 460 commercially attractive applications for Blockchain 
and grouped them into 17 classes: cryptocurrencies account for 
26,5% of total number of applications, financial transactions – 
for 21%, platform development – for almost 13%. Other 
Blockchain applications include energy distribution, digital 
identity, gaming, customer loyalty, and advanced tracking [25].  
Blockchain is increasingly compared to an emerging GPT in 
the conceptual works of several authors. For example, [20] 
define Blockchain as a general-purpose technology to exchange 
information in distributed networks. [3] also compare 
Blockchain with an emerging GPT because it enables exchange 
of a wide range of data, such as contracts, financial assets, IP 
rights, university certificates, and others. [14] and [31] shortly 
mention that Blockchain might be a new emerging GPT, without 
providing systematic arguments in line with GPT literature 
supporting this statement.  
Some scholars attribute selected GPT features to 
Blockchain. [12] stated that Blockchain can find applications in 
any industry where transactions take place. [6] describe 
Blockchain as all-pervasive technology and summarize its 
application fields. Several scholars also attribute innovation-
spawning effects - a second necessary feature of a GPT - to 
Blockchain. [24] and [30] conclude that completely new 
business models will be spawned from Blockchain. [8] predicts 
the emergence of new organizational forms in a Blockchain-
based economy. Several authors mention that Blockchain 
provides signigicant benefits: for example, it substantially 
reduces transaction costs [12], ensures transparency of data [23], 
and provides advanced security [18]. [37] also point out the 
continuous improvement of technology over the last years.  
While many scholars acknowledge disruptive potential of 
Blockchain in the subsequent years, its current adoption rate 
within industrial sectors still remains low due to several 
technological imperfections, superiority of existing 
technologies, and absence of necessary complementarities [30], 
[37]. Moreover, Blockchain is supposed to be suitable for 
particular application scenarios, rather than an appropriate 
solution for all problems (see [34] for critical discussion). This 
view does not contradict the eventual GPT nature of Blockchain, 
as it might seem at first glance, but rather confirms that 
“transforming GPTs first appear in a crude embryonic state with 
only a few specific use cases” [15], and need a facilitating 
structure, complementary innovations [1], [2], and numerous 
incremental refinements [28] before they diffuse through the 
economy. The analysis of factors that influence diffusion 
patterns of Blockchain goes beyond the scope of the present 
paper, which primarily deals with the question, whether

Blockchain does represent a general-purpose technology in the 
making with respect to acknowledged GPT features.  
III. DATA 
Consistent with the other empirical works on GPTs [4], [10], 
[32], [36], the main data for assessing the GPT nature of 
Blockchain are related patents. Despite some general 
shortcomings of patent datasets, such as different patterns of 
patenting activity within various industries, non-patentability of 
certain inventions [32], late appearance in the innovation cycle, 
and strong dependency on policy, they are widely used to 
capture technological development. Patents represent promising 
source for modelling emerging technologies in their early stages 
when market data is scarce [28] and for identification of 
potential GPTs [10]. Forward patent citations enable tracing the 
links between the present and the previous inventions and, 
therefore, are widely used in GPT literature to calculate the 
degree of pervasiveness and scope for improvement of a certain 
technology [10].  
Despite the open-source nature of original Bitcoin code, 
Blockchain inventions are patent eligible, and the related patents 
mostly represent improvements over existing technology 
(alternative consensus mechanisms, scalability and security 
solutions, etc.) or refer to Blockchain usage within a specific 
domain. For this study, Blockchain-related patent data have 
been retrieved from PATSTAT Online database, Autumn 2018 
Edition. The emerging nature of Blockchain and, therefore, 
absence of international patent classification (IPC) codes 
assigned to this technology, makes retrieval of Blockchain-
related patents from PATSTAT not a trivial task. Taking in 
consideration general shortcomings of a keyword search [32] 
and other usages of the term ‘block chain’ in chemistry, software 
engineering and machinery, a search strategy for Blockchain 
patents based on both keyword combinations and IPC codes was 
developed and discussed with the EPO (European Patent Office) 
domain experts. This search strategy includes primary 
keywords, such as ‘crypto(-/ )currenc(y/ies)’, ‘smart 
contract(s)’, ‘bitcoin’, ‘ethereum’, ‘distributed ledger’, 
‘consensus mechanism/algorithm’, ‘block(-/ )chain’ (it is 
important to exclude keywords ‘polymer’, ‘polyol’ and ‘block 
chaining’ as well as IPC class B from the search query). 
Secondary keywords, such as ‘proof-of-work’, ‘digital 
currenc(y/ies)’, ‘hash tree’, ‘merkle tree’, and ‘counterparty’ 
are used in combination with IPC subclasses G06Q20/065, 
G06Q20/0655, G06Q20/0658,  G06Q20/4016; H04L9/0643, 
H04L9/3236, H04L9/3239, H04L9/3242, H04L9/3247, 
H04L9/3252, H04L9/3257, H04L2209/30, H04L2209/38, and 
H04L2209/56. 
After careful screening of titles and abstracts of retrieved 
patents, the total number of 2,081 distinct Blockchain-related 
patent families filed between 2008 and 2017 and translated into 
English have been taken for the further analysis.   
IV. METHODOLOGY 
A. Pervasiveness 
The first feature of a GPT is pervasiveness, or the degree to 
which a technology is spread over various industrial fields [1], 
which is commonly measured by a generality index of the 
related patents [9], [10], [32], [36]. In essence, a generality index 
of a patent is based on forward citations and reflects the number 
of distinct technological classes (IPCs) the subsequent 
inventions based on a certain patent relate to. The index 
represents a modified Hirschman-Herfindahl index and is 
calculated as following:  
 𝐺𝑖 = 1 −  ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗
2
𝑗  (1)
where sij is a share of citations received by patent i that 
belong to patent class j, out of ni patent classes [10]. 
The value of a generality index can be between 0 and 1. The 
larger the number of technological classes the patents that cite 
the focal patent belong to, the closer to 1 a generality index is, 
the more pervasive is a technology [10]. Due to a highly skewed 
distribution of patent importance [32], the generality indexes are 
calculated for the top 10 cited Blockchain-related patent 
families. 
The generality index is a relative value, therefore, 
informative only when compared to the analogous values of 
other technologies [9], [32], and [36]. Scholars increasingly 
compare Blockchain with information and communication 
technology (ICT) in its early years [11], [18]. While ICT is a 
widely recognized example of a GPT [4], [10], the 
pharmaceutical technology is an example of a non-GPT due to 
its low pervasiveness [36]. In such a way, comparison of 
generality indexes of these technologies may provide useful 
insights in the pervasiveness of Blockchain. To minimize the 
bias by comparing technologies at a different maturity level, the 
ICT and pharma patents filed between 1976 and 1980 are taken 
into consideration, and their forward citation time window is 
fixed at the level of Blockchain-related patents. These years 
were marked with the beginning of the ICT age and growing 
interest in the technology [22], which subsequently resulted in 
the relatively high generality scores [36]. 
B. Innovation spawning 
Scholars used different approaches in measuring the second 
defining GPT feature – innovation spawning effects. Some 
economists calculated the length of the citation lags of related 
patents [10], [36]; others analyzed the share of technology-
related inventions in the downstream application sectors [32]. 
Both of these approaches are inappropriate for Blockchain at 
current maturity level, since the technology is only in the 
beginning of its development curve [18]. Industrial dynamics 
literature provides useful insights about the measurement of 
innovation spawning of emerging technologies. In fact, the 
arrival of a new GPT is usually accompanied by a large variety 
of so-called “Schumpeterian” companies [5] that try to capture 
the value of the promising technology in its early phase [4], [13]. 
These companies, attracted by possibility to get high profits 
from exploiting new technology, constitute an integral part of 
economic “trail-and error procedures associated with the search 
for new technological paths” [5]. Taking in consideration these 
observations, analysis of, first, variety of innovators in the 
Blockchain domain, and, second, the degree of entry of new 
innovators provides useful insights about innovation spawning 
effects of Blockchain at its current technological maturity level.  
The degree of entry of new innovators is calculated as:

𝑁𝑒𝑤 𝑂𝑖
𝑂𝑖
   (2) 
where Oi is a total number of patenting organizations in the 
field, and New Oi is a number of organizations patenting for the 
first time [4]. Consistent with the related literature, the degree of 
entry of new innovators within the Blockchain domain is 
calculated based on the top 20 patent applicants in the field.  
C. Scope for improvement 
The differences in the definition of the third GPT feature – 
scope for improvement – result in various methodologies the 
scholars use for its measurement. Authors that conceptualize 
scope for improvement as the ability of a GPT to provide 
significant benefits to its users [13], [28] commonly analyse 
development of its application sectors. For example, [13] 
investigate decrease in equipment prices caused by 
electrification. Scholars that understand permanent 
technological development as indicator for scope for 
improvement especially of emerging GPTs [32] look at their 
patenting patterns. [21] and [32] simply investigate the growth 
rate of technology-related inventions, whereas [26] consider 
average number of forward citations per most cited patent 
applications. Due to the emerging nature of Blockchain and the 
importance of understanding the course of its technological 
development [37], the scope for improvement is measured by 
looking at evolution of the Blockchain-related patents. The first 
aspect of this technological evolution of Blockchain consists in 
efforts aimed at overcoming its R&D challenges, such as 
security, scalability, usability and wasted resources [35], 
whereas the second aspect – consistent with the evolutionary 
approach [2] – refers to adaptation of technology to various 
application domains. Such measurement of scope for 
improvement extends the GPT literature and can also be applied 
for investigation of technological evolution of other emerging 
technologies.  
V. RESULTS 
The amount of Blockchain-related patents remained 
negligible in the first four years after the publication of Bitcoin 
White Paper in 2008. In the subsequent years, 2013 onward, the 
number of inventions in Blockchain domain grew substantially 
from 14 patent families filed in 2013 to 1285 – in 2017. The 
filings from 2018 are not fully represented in the Autumn 2018 
PATSTAT Edition, therefore, were dismissed from the present 
analysis. The negligible number of patents filed from 2008 to 
2012 were also dismissed for the investigation of GPT features 
in order to avoid the small sample bias. 
Fig. 1 presents the summary statistics of the Blockchain-
related patent data. Panel a) shows, on the one side, the 
exponential growth of number of patent filings starting from 
2013, and on the other side, empirically demonstrates the late 
appearance of patents in the innovation cycle. Panel b) maps 
top application authorities and, therefore, provides insights 
about geographical distribution of Blockchain patents. 
According to it, the most part of the patents have been filed in 
China (1,222 in total), followed by the United States (422 in 
total). Other countries actively involved in the patenting 
process are South Korea, Australia, Great Britain, Canada, and 
Japan. European countries (noted as ‘EP’ in the panel b) have 
not been among the top applicants of Blockchain patents so far. 
In addition to single countries, the substantial number of patents 
(281 in total and growing in the last few years) are so-called 
WO patents, which are granted by the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO). This is the evidence of the 
increasing number of Blockchain-related patent filings at the 
international phase and the growing importance of technology 
itself [29].

c), the most part of the Blockchain-related patents belong to 
classes G06Q (‘data processing systems or methods’), H04L 
(‘transmission of digital information’), and G06F (‘electrical 
digital data processing’). The most part of the Blockchain-
related patents classified as G06Q refer to commercial 
applications of the technology in a specific domain. Other 
common IPC 4-digit classes include H04K, H04W, G06K, 
G07C, and G09C. In such a way, Blockchain is established

primarily within the areas of computing and electric 
communication techniques. 
The next paragraphs are dedicated to detailed description of 
the GPT nature of Blockchain according to its three defining 
features – pervasiveness, innovation spawning effects, and 
scope for improvement.  
A. Pervasiveness 
Pervasive technologies benefit a large number of industrial 
sectors [15]. In patenting terms, it means that the related 
inventions belong to a variety of technological IPC classes and 
are subsequently cited by other patents from different IPCs 
[10]. While the panel c) of the Fig. 1 shows the distribution of 
IPC classes of Blockchain patents filed between 2008 and 2017, 
the Fig. 2 demonstrates the growing number of IPC 4-digit 
classes assigned to Blockchain (from only 5 in 2013 to 23 in 
2017) and, thus, the increasing degree of pervasiveness of the 
technology.  
 
Fig. 2. Number of IPC4 classes assigned to Blockchain patents (2013-2017) 
A generality index is an acknowledged measure for the 
pervasiveness degree of a certain technology [10].The values of 
the average generality indexes of the top ten cited Blockchain 
patent families, calculated in PATSTAT according to the 
formula (1) and graphically represented in the Fig. 3, reveal a 
clear pattern: the generality index values show constant growth 
from 0.562 in 2013 to 0.783 in 2017. As evident, the average 
generality index grew fast from 2013 to 2016 and remained 
almost constant from 2016 to 2017. This is explained by the fact 
that patents filed in 2017 still have short citation lags which is 
going to be changed in the subsequent years. 
Such an upward trend in the generality index proves the 
growing pervasiveness of the Blockchain technology over the 
past years. In fact, the patents filed in 2013-2014 were mainly 
cited by IPC classes G06Q (‘data processing systems or 
methods’) and H04L (‘transmission of digital information’) 
whereas in 2016-2017 the variety of technological domains the 
citing inventions relate to increased substantially and included 
such distant classes as, for example, A45C (‘diagnosis, 
surgery’) or H03K (‘pulse technique’). 
The comparison of the values of the generality indexes of 
Blockchain-related patents with analogous values for ICT 
(considered a GPT) and pharmaceutical technology (not 
considered a GPT) at the similar maturity levels provides 
additional insights about the GPT nature of Blockchain (see 
Fig. 4). Although the absolute number of ICT-related patents 
filed between 1976 and 1980 was substantially higher than 
Blockchain patentings between 2013 and 2017, the generality 
scores of both technologies are comparable and amount to, on 
average, 0.73 for ICT and 0.69 for Blockchain with a fast 
growing upward trend. Es evident from the Fig. 4, Blockchain 
generaliy scores were low in 2013 and 2014 (0.56 and 0.62 
respectively), however then grew fast, reached the level and 
even exceeded the ICT generality in 1979 and 1980. A 
generaliy index of pharmaceutical technology remains more or 
less constant over the analysed period and is substantially lower 
than of the other two technologies (0.56 on average).

Fig. 4. Generality indexes of Blockchain (2013-2017), ICT and pharma 
technology (1976-1980) 
To sum up, the analysis demonstrates comparability of  a 
generality index of Blockchain technology with an 
acknowledged GPT (ICT) at the similar development stage with 
a potential to grow in the subsequent years. The comparison of 
the generality index of Blockchain with the analogous value of 
a non-GPT technology (pharmaceuticals) at a comparable 
maturity level shows that Blockchain is more pervasive. This 
result leads to a conclusion that Blockchain does already have a 
pervasive character with a potential to become even more 
pervasive in a subsequent years, eventually exceeding the level 
of ICT.   
B. Innovation spawning 
Definition of GPTs as ‘enabling platforms’ refers to 
innovation spawning effects, or ability of these technologies to 
initiate complementary innovations in their downstream 
application sectors [1]. As discussed in the methodological 
section of the paper, the variety of patenting organizations in 
the domain and a degree of entry of new innovators provide 
valuable insights about the innovation spawning effects of 
emerging technologies at their early development stages [4], 
[13]. 
Fig. 5 maps the landscape of the most active innovators in 
the Blockchain field between 2013 and 2017. There is an 
exponential growth of companies that file patents within the 
Blockchain domain 2013 onward, which reflects the overall 
upward trend in patenting activities in the field. A relatively 
large number of financial institutions in 2013 - 2015, such as,

for example, Bank of America, Mastercard International, 
NASDAQ, Fidelity Investments, Toronto Dominion Bank, and 
Bank of China, is explained by the currently largest share of 
cryptocurrencies and financial transactions in industrial 
applications of Blockchain [25]. After 2015, the firms from 
other industries started entering in the Blockchain domain. In 
the last years, the most active applicants of Blockchain-related 
patents are specialized Blockchain R&D companies that focus 
mainly on overcoming current technical challenges of the 
technology. A substantial part of these R&D companies are 
located in Asia and were established between 2009 and 2014. 
Some examples include Coinplug from South Korea, Hangzhou 
Fuzamei Tech from China, and EITC Holding that was later 
renamed NChain Holding. Coinplug focuses on 
cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-based identity solutions, 
whereas EITC Holding is active in fundamental Blockchain 
research. Their recent patents include also applications of 
technologies within specific settings, for example, digital rights 
management on Blockchain.  
  
Fig. 5. Top applicants of Blockchain patents (2013-2017) 
IBM and Intel Corporation are also active in patenting 
within the Blockchain domain – IBM filed one of the first 
Blockchain-related patents in 2013. Some smaller companies, 
such as Spondoolies, Cardstack, Monegraph, DAGlabs Ltd and 
others also appear among the active applicants of Blockchain-
related inventions. In the last years, the universities also play a 
more important role in the field: for example, 17 patent filings 
came from the University of Electronic Science and 
Technology of China in 2017.  
An arrival of a new GPT is often accompanied by a high 
degree of entry of new innovators because of reallocation of 
assets caused by the emerging technology [13]. In fact, 
calculation of the degree of entry of new innovators in the 
Blockchain space based on Top 20 applicants according to the 
formula (2) showed, that this value is very high (on average, 
0.85) in the analysed period between 2013 and 2017 (see Fig. 
6). This value is comparable to the early years of development 
of other GPTs over the history, such as nanotechnology [28], 
[36]; electricity [13]; and Internet [22]. The highest value of 
degree of entry can be observed in 2013 and 2014 (1.0 and 0.95 
respectively) which reflects the early stage of technological 
development of Blockchain. From 2015 onwards, entry degrees 
remain high, however, lower than initially. In 2017 several 
important players entered the Blockchain market. For example, 
large communications corporations, such as China Unicom and 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in Japan started actively 
patenting Blockchain. State Grid Corporation of China, the 
largest utility company in the world, became also very active 
on the market with substantial number of Blockchain-related 
patent filings in 2017. Alibaba Group Holding filed almost ten 
times more patents in 2017 than a year before. Chinese 
university Jinan, with 10 Blockchain patent filings in 2017, is 
also a new innovator in the domain.  
 
Fig. 6. Degree of entry of new innovators in Blockchain field (2013-2017) 
To sum up, Blockchain domain is characterized by 
„economic trial-and-error“ phase [5], with a high degree of entry 
and a growing variety of „Schumpeterian“ companies. Such a 
dynamic is peculiar to GPTs in the making [15], and provides 
evidence for innovation spawning effects of Blockchain.  
C. Scope for improvement 
Scholars of technological change acknowledged, that 
“transforming GPTs never enter the world in a fully developed 
form” [15]. Therefore, a continuous technological advancement 
at the early stages constitutes an integral part of technological 
maturity and is commonly used as an indicator of scope for 
improvement of an emerging GPT [26], [32]. Blockchain, at its 
current maturity level, has several technological issues to 
overcome in order to realize its potential and be applied across 
various industrial sectors [35]. For the purposes of the present 
analysis, inventions that aim at overcoming the major 
technological challenges of Blockchain, such as security, 
usability, wasted resources, and others, are defined as patents 
covering R&D aspect. Inventions that refer to the usage of 
Blockchain within a specific application domain, such as 
financial transactions, energy management, supply chain, and 
others, are termed as patents covering application aspects.  
Though the detailed investigation of patent contents goes 
beyond the scope of the present paper and is covered in [7], the 
evolution trend of patents relating to R&D and application 
aspects of Blockchain is represented in the Fig. 7.  
As evident from the Fig. 7, the period between 2013 and 
2015 is characterized by more or less identical distribution of 
R&D and application patents. This can be explained by the 
prevalence of cryptocurrency-related filings in the early years 
of Blockchain patenting. From 2015 onwards, the number of 
inventions that improve the current technological problems of

Blockchain grows fast and outweighs the application-focused 
patents. Such a prevalence of R&D-oriented patents reflects the 
clear focus on overcoming basic shortcomings of the 
technology and serves as evidence to the claim, that Blockchain 
does indeed undergo a continual technological improvement 
and, therefore, shows a scope for improvement peculiar to the 
GPTs in the making [32].

empirical results and briefly sketches possible directions for the 
further research.  
VI. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESULTS 
According to the analysis of Blockchain-related patent data 
conducted in line with the GPT and industrial dynamics 
literature, Blockchain – already at the relative early stage of its 
development - can be considered a general-purpose technology 
in the making. The pervasiveness of Blockchain grows over 
time, and its generality index is comparable to the analogous 
values of an acknowledged GPT (ICT) at the similar maturity 
level. The growing number of IPC classes to which the 
Blockchain patents relate is another indicator for its 
pervasiveness. It is still too early to observe the range of 
complementary innovations in the downstream application 
sectors of Blockchain in related patent data. However, the 
analysis of its innovation spawning effects, conducted in line 
with industrial dynamics literature, demonstrated the large 
variety of organizations that are actively involved in the 
innovation process. Large financial institutions, technological 
companies, but also a range of universities and applied research 
institutions, energy and e-commerce companies are present in 
the space. In addition to established organizations, Blockchain 
gave a rise to a range of newly created R&D companies, mainly 
located in China, South Korea and Japan, that are currently on 
the front of technological innovations in the field. The existence 
of these so-called “Schumpeterian” companies is essential for 
the phase of economic trial-and error, and massively 
contributes to GPT development and diffusion [5], [13]. 
Peculiar to emerging GPTs [13], several technological 
challenges of Blockchain currently hinder its wide adoption 
within various industries. The continuous efforts to overcome 
these challenges, observed in the patent data, provides evidence 
for scope for improvement of the technology.  
To sum up, Blockchain does represent an emerging GPT. 
This empirically funded conclusion has a number of important 
implications for designing technology enhancement policies. 
First, policy makers should be aware of the interrelation of a 
GPT and facilitating structure in its application sectors. Due to 
this so-called ‘dual inducement mechanism’ [1], policies 
should be aimed not only at supporting technology itself, but at 
adjusting the facilitating structure through regulation, creation 
of new education programs necessary for building know-how 
required by the new GPT, and establishment of technology 
information networks [15]. Since high degree of uncertainty 
accompanies development of all GPTs [36], and Blockchain is 
no exception [12], enhancing policies should be designed in a 
flexible manner, avoiding concentration of support only within 
one area [15]. Furthermore, policies should support diffusion of 
GPTs, which is a slow, however, essential process in realization 
of their economic impact [1]. This can be achieved through 
dispersion of sunk costs associated with the new GPT and, as 
far as possible, by assisting in acquisition of necessary tacit 
knowledge [15].   
The present study is, to the best of the author’s knowledge, 
a first complete empirical investigation of the GPT nature of 
Blockchain that provides the basis for the further scientific 
discourse. The one group of questions arises from the 
interdependency between a GPT and its downstream 
application sectors [1], [28]. Not only Blockchain as a GPT 
does influence the application areas, but also the advancement 
in its downstream sectors will determine the velocity and 
evolution of the technology itself in the subsequent years. What 
complementary innovations are needed for successful 
implementation of Blockchain-based solutions? What are the 
interaction patterns of Blockchain with existing technologies? 
How should current business processes be redesigned in order 
to capture value from Blockchain innovation? What new 
infrastructure and managerial structures should be created? 
What are other factors that influence Blockchain 
materialization as a GPT? These and other questions should be 
tackled in order to understand the course of the further 
development of Blockchain.  
The theoretical models predict various effects of GPTs on 
long-term macroeconomic dynamics (see [2] for overview), 
which opens up promising direction for the future economic 
research. What is the impact of Blockchain on various 
macroeconomic indicators, such as productivity, skill premium, 
and others? How does this technology influence the labour 
market? Do the existing GPT models explain the influence of 
Blockchain on economy? These questions are just few 
examples that the economists will face in the subsequent years. 
  
VII. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 
The study has some limitations. Patent data, though being 
commonly used to detect technological trends and discover the 
key technologies, have some general limitations, such as non-
patentability of certain inventions, strong dependency on 
policy, and others [36]. The scholars of the future studies 
dealing with the similar topic might take in considerations 
additional data sources, such as scientific papers, market data, 
data on ICOs, and others. The emerging nature of technology 
itself and late appearance of related patents in the innovation

cycle allow only for a relative short period of tracking the 
Blockchain trend. Therefore, the observation of the GPT nature 
of Blockchain is relevant also in the subsequent years, allowing 
for a higher maturity level of the technology. 
The contribution of the present study is twofold. First, to the 
best of the author’s knowledge, it is the first one to 
systematically examine the defining features of a GPT – 
pervasiveness, innovation spawning effects, and scope for 
improvement – in the Blockchain-related patent data from 
PATSTAT. The analysis, conducted in line with GPT literature 
is complemented by methods taken from industrial dynamics 
literature – such an approach is appropriate for analyzing 
emerging technologies and can be used by scholars in the 
subsequent studies. Second, the fact that empirical analysis 
advances the claim that Blockchain is a GPT in the making 
opens up numerous research avenues and is of high relevance 
not only for scholars, but also for policy makers and 
practitioners.
