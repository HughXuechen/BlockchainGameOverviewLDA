Abstract—Benefit from the capabilities of providing decen-
tralized tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven au-
tonomous organization, open-access blockchains based on proof-
of-work protocols have gained tremendous popularity. Yet, the
proof-of-work based consensus protocols under threats, e.g.,
double-spending. In this paper, by adopting the cyber-insurance
as an economic tool to neutralize cyber risks, we propose a
novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based
service. The blockchain service market under our consideration
is composed of four entities, i.e., the infrastructure provider,
blockchain provider, cyber-insurer, and users. The blockchain
provider purchases the computing resources, e.g., a cloud, from
the infrastructure provider to maintain the blockchain consensus
and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain
provider optimize its profit by strategizing its investment in the
infrastructure in order to improve the security of the blockchain
and the service price charged to the users. In the meantime, to
prevent the potential damage incurred by the attacks and then
fully secure the cyber-space, the blockchain provider purchases
a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer. In return, the cyber-
insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived
risk level of the blockchain service and will pay the claim to
the blockchain provider once attacks happen. Based on the
rationality of the market entities, we model the interaction among
the blockchain provider, users, and cyber-insurer as a two-
stage Stackelberg game. Specifically, the blockchain provider and
cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies in the
upper level subgame, and then the users follow to determine their
demand of the blockchain service in the lower level subgame.
Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks
and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg
equilibrium in the market game.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the recent years, thanks to the capability of being
able to distributively provide the irreversible, tamper-evident
database of tokenized asset transactions, blockchain technolo-
gies have attracted tremendous attention from both industry
and academia [1]. Relying on the condition of honest majority
to guarantee the data integrity and service security, especially
when the Nakamoto consensus protocol based on proof-
of-work (PoW) is adopted [1], open-access/permissionless

blockchains include the advantages such as open access,
disintermediation, and pure self-organization. However, per-
missionless blockchain networks can be vulnerable to a series
of insider attacks by malicious consensus nodes due to the
fact that they admit no identity control [2]. As the most
fundamental one of different types of attacks targeting per-
missionless blockchain networks [3], double spending can be
executed through various attacks, e.g., goldfinger attacks [2].
Briefly, a double-spending attacker attempts to simultaneously
spend the same set of blockchain tokens in two different
transactions. This can be executed sequentially by two steps:
1) persuading part of the network and the transaction receiver
to confirm one transaction, and 2) persuading the majority
of the network to override that transaction with a conflicting
transaction spending the same set of tokens. Worsely, due to
the factors such as randomness in solving the PoW puzzles [1]
and information propagation delay, the malicious nodes, i.e.,
attackers, only need to hold a certain level of PoW computing
power to succeed with a high probability in the double-
spending attacks. Note here that the double-spending attack is
applicable to other blockchain-based resource trading services
and systems, e.g., energy trading, even though it is initially
devised for Bitcoin [4].
Due to the inherent characteristics of openness, the approach
in [5] can not completely secure the PoW-based permissionless
blockchain networks, which critically hinders the broader
adoption of permissionless blockchains, especially in business
services requiring high-level service security. Although the
studies on the improvement of blockchain protocols have
never stopped, perfectly secured blockchain networks are still
impossible, and finding an alternative mean of cyber-risk
management is therefore necessary. Recently, cyber-insurance
has been recognized as a promising approach to efficiently
manage the cyber risks by transferring them to insurers [6].
Similar to the traditional insurance, the customer of a cyber-
insurance product, i.e., a policyholder, is insured once it
settles the contract with the insurer by paying a premium. If
attacks happen and the damage is within the coverage of the
insurance policy, the insurer will pay the claim to the customer
accordingly.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of jointly
providing the risk management and security enhancement to
the blockchain users and providers against attacks through the
means of the cyber-insurance. As shown in Fig. 1, We consider

a PoW-based blockchain service market composed of three
entities, i.e., the users, blockchain provider, and cyber-insurer,
under the threat of double-spending attacks. The blockchain
provider purchases the computing resource from cloud-based
infrastructure providers for maintaining the network consensus
and then offers the service, e.g., P2P energy trading for
smart grids, implemented on top of the blockchain for the
users’ consideration. The blockchain provider makes profit by
charging the users with the transaction processing fees and
block mining fees [1]. To neutralize the economic/financial
loss incurred by double-spending attacks, the blockchain
provider purchases the insurance from the cyber-insurer, which
adopts an adjustable premium pricing strategy according to its
perceived risk level of the blockchain. We propose a two-
stage Stackelberg game model to analyze the dynamics of
the considered market. On the upper stage of the game, the
blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer lead to adopt their
best-response strategies for profit maximization. On the lower
stage, the users adjust their service demands according to the
cost and the security level of the blockchain.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the preliminaries about blockchains and cyber-
insurance, the system model, and the formulation of Stackel-
berg game. Section III investigates the existence and unique-
ness of the equilibrium in the proposed Stackelberg game.
Section IV presents the numerical performance evaluation.
Section V concludes the paper.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND GAME FORMULATION
In this section, we first introduce the model of success-
ful attack probability for double spending and the concept
of risk-adjusted premium. After formulating the utilities of
the blockchain provider, users, and cyber-insurer, we inves-
tigate the problem of users’ service demand, service pricing
and infrastructure, i.e., computing power, investment by the
blockchain provider and premium pricing by the cyber-insurer
jointly as a hierarchical market game.
A. Preliminaries
1) Successful Attack Probability: We consider that the
blockchain provider is responsible for maintaining a permis-
sionless, PoW-based blockchain for service provision. Extend-
ing the analysis in [7] and [8], we assume that during a time
period of T , the total computing resource of the blockchain
network measured by the hash rate is fixed as H . Following the
Nakamoto consensus protocol, every consensus node runs an
independent Poisson process for puzzle-solving. The average
time for a new block to be mined in the blockchain network
is T0 [1]. Then, in the time period of T , the expected number
of blocks being successfully mined in the network is T
T0
.
Let h denote the investment in computing resources by the
blockchain provider, i.e., the honest nodes, and a denote the
investment in computing resources by the attackers. Then,
if the computing efficiency for hash queries are roughly the
same, the blockchain provider and the attackers divide the total
computing resource H as h̄H and āH , respectively, where
h̄ = h
a+h and ā = a
a+h are the investment ratios. According
to the probabilistic model for winning the PoW-based puzzle
solving race [7], the number of blocks that are mined by the
blockchain provider and waiting for confirmation during T
is T
T0
h̄H
H = T
T0
h̄. On the other hand, instead of following
the Poisson distribution based model, the number of blocks
successfully mined by attackers during T can be accurately
modeled as a negative binomial variable [7]. Therefore, with
the investment ratio h̄, the probability for attackers to succeed
in double spending during T can be expressed as follows (see
Theorem 1 in [8]):

with Γ (·) being the gamma function. The model of exponential
decay in (1) is discovered in [9] and proved in [8].
We consider that the blockchain provider receives payments
from the users in the form of transaction fees in a confirmed
block. Under double-spending attacks, the blockchain provider
has to compensate the loss of the users with a fixed rate for
each transaction in the block that is finally overridden. Assume
that the number of transactions included in each block is the
same, and hence the transaction fee and compensation rate
are fixed for each transaction. Let NT denote the number
of transactions in a block, r denote the block mining reward
for each block and q denote the total compensation rate for
each block. Then, with the investment ratio h̄, the blockchain
provider’s potential loss is T

attack, and the probability of successful attack is:

the investment ratio of the blockchain provider is no less than
1/2. The reason is that when h̄ < 1/2, the probability of
successful double spending is always equal to 1 as shown
in (3), which is trivial and thus not our focus.
2) Premium Determination: The cyber-insurer offers a
cyber-insurance service to the blockchain provider, and the
blockchain provider transfers the risk of double-spending
attack to the cyber-insurer by buying the cyber-insurance. By
adopting the concept of risk-adjusted premium in [10], the
cyber-insurer dynamically determines the price, i.e., premium,
of its cyber-insurance product according to the insurance risk
distribution. According to our previous discussion, the cyber-
insurer has an insurance risk, i.e., paying the claim of T

with the probability of P

given by (3). Then, the expected

PH transform in our study, i.e., ω (x, γ) = x

Subsection 5.1 of [10]. Then, the corresponding premium can

where γ is the premium coefficient deciding on the insurance
policy. Thus, the cyber-insurer adjusts the premium by control-
ling γ according to the insurance risk. It is worth noting that
the term
[
1− ∫ h̄
1/2 P (θ) dθ
]
in (6) is smaller than 1. Therefore,
the larger γ is, the higher the premium Λ (γ) will be.
B. System Model
1) The User’s Utility: We suppose that each user in the
blockchain service market has a service demand, which is
determined by an intrinsic value θi from the uniform distri-
bution FU over the interval [0, 1]. Here, θi can be interpreted
as the probability for user i to buy the blockchain service.
We further assume that the intrinsic values of the users are
independently distributed. The users also experience social
externalities in which the decision of one user can influence the
decisions of the other users. Let Pr [j buys the service] denote
the probability that user j subscribes to the service, then, the
utility of user i can be expressed as follows [11]:
ui = h̄+ θi − pi + α
∑
j∈N
gijPr [j buys the service]. (7)
In (7), the first term, i.e., h̄, is the investment ratio of the
blockchain provider. h̄ represents the positive effect owning
to the effort of the blockchain provider in preventing the
security breach due to double-spending attacks. According
to (1), the larger h̄ is, the lower the successful probability
of double-spending attacks is, and consequently the less the
users will be affected. The third term, i.e., pi ∈ [0, pu],
is the price of the service for user i1. The forth term of
(7), i.e., α
∑
j∈N
gijPr [j buys the service], represents the positive
social externality among the users. gij is the element of the
externality matrix G [12] and represents the level of the social
externality (influence) that user j has on user i. We assume
that gij �= 0, ∀i �= j and gii = 0, ∀i ∈ N . Finally, α is
a constant controlling the level of social externality for the
entire network.
2) Profits of the Blockchain Provider and the Cyber-insurer:
The goals of the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer are
to maximize their individual profits. Based on our previous
discussion, the payoff functions of the blockchain provider
can be expressed as follows:

(8)
where the first term
∑
i∈N pixi is the revenue obtained from
the users’ payment for the blockchain service and xi is the
probability that user i buys the service defined in (13). The
second term, i.e., h= ah̄
1−̄h , is the blockchain provider’s invest-
ment in the infrastructure, and we have h= ah̄
1−̄h ⇔ h̄= h
a+h . The
third term, i.e., h̄ T
T0
NTr, is the block mining reward received
by the blockchain provider for maintaining the service. The
last term, i.e., T

[

dt, is the
premium paid by the blockchain provider to the cyber-insurer,
and q is the compensation price for one transaction.
On the other hand, the premium paid by the blockchain
provider is the revenue of the cyber-insurer. Due to the
uncertainty of double-spending attacks, we adopt the expected
claim as the cyber-insurer’s cost. Then, the cyber-insurer’s
payoff function can be expressed as:
ΠI (γ) =

the product of the successful attack probability and the total
claim paid to the blockchain provider for covering its loss.
Finally, since the premium increases as the cyber-insurer’s
decision variable γ increases, a rational cyber-insurer will
keep γ as high as possible to maximum its revenue. However,
when the blockchain provider increases its investment ratio,
the successful attack probability will decrease. As a result,
the blockchain provider will have less incentive to pay an
extremely high premium. Therefore, we introduce the last term
in (9) to model the possibly negative impact on the expected
payoff of the cyber-insurer as both the values of h̄ and γ
increase, which is similar to the concept of the punishment
on insurer adopted in [13]. Here, we define σ
(
h̄, γ
)
=
σ1
(
h̄
)
σ2 (γ), where σ1
(
h̄
)
is an increasing convex function
of h̄ with the following properties:

.
(10)
The conditions in (10) indicates that with h̄ > 1
2 , the
blockchain provider’s effort in investing the computing re-
source effectively reduces the successful attack probability.
Consequently, the probability of the cyber-insurer paying
the claim to the blockchain provider is also reduced. Then,
keeping the highest premium has a negative effect on the
cyber-insurer’s payoff, e.g., by hurting its reputation or curbing
the incentive for the blockchain provider to buy the insurance.
Under the other two conditions in (10), the lack of enough
investment in infrastructure of the blockchain provider will
induce higher probability of being successfully attacked, hence
leading to a positive effect on the cyber-insurer’s payoff due to
the higher demand of financial protection. Additionally, σ2 (γ)
is an increasing convex function of γ and σ2 (γ)|γ=1 = 0.
As such, when γ = 1, the expected loss in (4) is equal to
the premium in (6), and there is no negative effect on the
cyber-insurer’s reputation. For tractable analysis, we adopt the
following model:
σ
(
h̄, γ

It is worth noting that the cyber-insurer’s payoff function in
(9) may also adopt other models for σ
(
h̄, γ
)
. The selected
model in (11) has no effect on our subsequent analysis.
III. GAME EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
Using backward induction, we first obtain the Nash Equi-
librium (NE) of the user-level subgame Gu by characterizing a
system of interdependent demands. We provide the sufficient
conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the NE in the
user-level subgame Gu by solving the bounded linear comple-
mentarity problem of the subgame [11]. Then, we substitute
the parametric NE of Gu into the leader-level subgame GL.
Under a reasonable assumption, we show that the Jacobian
matrix constructed from the payoff functions of each player
in the leader-level subgame is negative definite. Hence, we
prove that the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) of the market
game exists and is unique.
A. Equilibrium Analysis for User-Level Noncooperative Sub-
game
Intuitively, user i only buys the service when it has a positive
payoff, namely ui > 0. This indicates that there exists a
threshold θ̃i for the intrinsic value θi in (7), such that user
i will buy the service only when θi > θ̃i. θ̃i can be obtained
by setting ui = 0:
0 = h̄+ θ̃i − pi + α
∑
j∈N
gijPr [j buys the service]
= h̄+ θ̃i − pi + α

where 1− FU

denotes the probability that user j draws a

xi = 1− FU

denote the probability that user i buys the
service, and xi can be further expressed as follows:
xi = 1− FU

From (13), we can characterize a system of the users’ inter-

After subtracting each condition in (14) by the value of its
corresponding xi, we convert (14) into the following form:

where I is the identity matrix, 1 = [1, 1, . . . , 1]� ∈ R
|N|×1 and
{·}i represents the i-th entry of a vector. With (16), we can
investigate the properties of the NE in the user-level subgame.
Assumption 1. αρ (G) < 1, where ρ (·) is the spectral norm of
a matrix.
The physical meaning of Assumption 1 is illustrated in
Fig. 2, where the black area is the feasible area of αρ (G).
If αρ (G) exceeds the feasible area, the social externality will
be too strong such that every user will buy the service, which
is impossible in reality.
THEOREM 1. The user-level noncooperative subgame Gu
admits a unique NE under Assumption 1.
Proof. (16) is defined as a bounded linear complementarity
problem in [11]. It is a linear instance of the general mixed
complementarity problems discussed in [14]. As discussed
in [14], the linear instance of a complementarity problem
admits a unique solution, i.e., the NE, to the user-level
noncooperative subgame Gu, if (I− αG) is a P-matrix2.
Since αρ (G) < 1 under Assumption 1, all the eigenvalues of
the matrix αG belong to (0, 1) and hence all the eigenvalues
of the matrix (I− αG) belong to (0, 1). Therefore, (I− αG) is
a non-singular M-matrix3. Based on Theorem 6.2.3 in [15],
“any non-singular M-matrix is a P-matrix”, (I− αG) is a P-
matrix and then there exists a unique NE in the user-level
noncooperative subgame Gu. The proof is completed.
According to the system of interdependent demands (16),
the set of users N can be partitioned into three subsets, i.e.,
S0, S1, and S as follows:
• S0 =
{
i
∣∣{(
1 + h̄
)
1− p− (I− αG)x
}
i
< 0, ∀i ∈ N }
,
• S1 =
{
i
∣∣{(
1 + h̄
)
1− p− (I− αG)x
}
i
> 0, ∀i ∈ N }
,
• S = {i|{(1 + h̄)1− p− (I− αG)x}i = 0, ∀i ∈ N}.
Then, we obtain the following theorem:
THEOREM 2. The users in the user-level noncooperative
subgame Gu only belong to S, i.e., S = N , S0 = ∅, and S1 = ∅.
Given the service price vector p, the optimal solution to the
system of interdependent demands (16) is
x∗ = (I− αG)−1 [(

Proof. We denote the optimal price by p∗ and the optimal
demand by x∗. Then, we show that S0 = ∅ and S1 = ∅.
2A matrix A is a P-matrix if all its principal minors are positive.
3A matrix A is a non-singular M-matrix if A = I−B for a positive matrix
B with largest eigenvalue ρ (B) < 1.
1) S0 = ∅: We first assume that S0 �= ∅. This means that
∃i ∈ N , such that xi
∗ = 0 and {(1+h̄)1−p∗−(I−αG)x∗}i < 0.
Because

∗ such that 1+ h̄+α
∑

pi
′ > 0 and correspondingly xi
′ > 0. This indicates that
when the service price charged to user i decreases from
pi
∗ to pi
′, user i has an incentive to increase its demand
from xi
∗ = 0 to xi
′ > 0. Consequently, the revenue of the
blockchain provider will increase since pi
∗xi
∗ = 0 while
pi
′xi
′ > 0. Therefore, xi
∗ and pi
∗ cannot be the optimal
demand and price for user i, respectively. Hence, i /∈ S0,
∀i ∈ N and S0 = ∅.
2) S1 = ∅: Similarly, we assume that S1 �= ∅. This means that
∃l ∈ N , xl
∗ = 1 and
{(
1 + h̄

1− p∗ − (I− αG)x∗

l

Since

(pl

equal to 1 while the profit of the blockchain provider has
been increased from pl

∗ = pl

Moreover, since{(

user l belongs to S instead of S1. Therefore, pl
∗ and
xl
∗ are not the optimal price and demand for user l,
respectively. Hence, l /∈ S1, ∀l ∈ N and S1 = ∅.
To conclude, given any price vector p of the blockchain
service, the condition{(
1 + h̄
)
1− p− (I− αG)x∗

i
= 0 (19)
will be satisfied for all user i ∈ N . Therefore,(
1 + h̄
)
1− p− (I− αG)x∗ = 0 ↔ (I− αG)x∗ =
(
1 + h̄
)
1− p.
(20)
Since we have already shown that the matrix (I− αG) is a non-
singular matrix in Theorem 1, the inverse of (I− αG) exists.
Multiply both sides of (20) by (I− αG)−1, the optimal solution
to the system of interdependent demands, or equivalently, the
NE to the user-level noncooperative subgame Gu, is
x∗ = (I− αG)−1 [(
1 + h̄

1− p
]
. (21)
The proof is completed.
B. Equilibrium Analysis for Leader-Level Noncooperative
Subgame
After deriving the equilibrium demand of the users, we
investigate the leader-level noncooperative subgame GL for
the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer. At the NE, no
player can increase its profit by choosing a different strategy

provided that the other player’ strategy is unchanged [16]. In
what follows, we first prove that an NE exists in the leader-
level subgame GL. Then, we prove that this NE is unique.
Substituting the optimal demand of the users derived in (21)
into the profit function of the blockchain provider, we can
rewrite (8) into a matrix form as follows:
Πp

(22)
Then, we can obtain the following theorem regarding the NE
of the leader-level subgame.
THEOREM 3. There exists at least one NE in the leader-
level noncooperative subgame GL if and only if a >

8
1�(I− αG)−11. Then, the Stackbelberg equilibrium of the
market game exists.
Proof. We use congruent matrix to prove the concavity for the
Hessian matrix of ΠP with respect to
[
p�, h̄
]�
and ΠI with
respect to γ. The proof is omitted due to the space limit.
THEOREM 4. The NE in the leader-level noncooperative
subgame GL is unique if and only if a >
9(β+1)2(γu)β+1
128β
and
hence the Stackbelberg equilibrium is unique.
Proof. We prove that the Jacobian matrix is negative definite
by using its congruent matrix. The proof is omitted due to the
space limit.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct extensive numerical simulations
to evaluate the performance of the market entities at the
equilibrium in each stage. We consider a group of |N | users
in the blockchain service market. The off-diagonal elements
of social externality matrix G, i.e., gij , ∀i �= j, is generated
following the uniform distribution over the interval of [0, 10].
The domain of definition for α is set as
[
5× 10−4, 8× 10−4
]
according to the parameter setting in [11]. The other default
coefficients are given as follows: β = 10, pu = 1, γu = 2,
T = 100, T0 = 10, NT = 100, r = 10, q = 10 and
a = 100. Note that the price that we present in the figures
of simulation results is the mean value of the discriminatory
prices. The triple integral in the premium-related term in the
profit functions of the blockchain provider and the cyber-
insurer, i.e., (8) and (9), is calculated using the method of
rectangular integral with 100 as the number of intervals.
A. Numerical Results
1) The impact of the number of users: We first evaluate
the impacts by the number of users on the payoff of the
market entities in Fig. 3, where the number of users increases
from 50 to 120. Then, we evaluate the performance under
three levels of social externality, e.g., 6.5 × 10−4, 7 × 10−4,
and 7.5 × 10−4 which represent weak, medium, and strong
levels of social externality, respectively. As expected, the
profit of the blockchain provider increases significantly when

the social externality becomes stronger. As the number of
users increases, the profit of the blockchain provider also
increases under the given social externality settings. Moreover,
the increase of the profit of the blockchain provider becomes
larger when the social externality is stronger. Intuitively, the
reason is that the social externality stimulates the demand of
each user. In return, the blockchain provider can raise the
price of service accordingly and hence improves its profit.
Meanwhile, as the social externality becomes stronger, the
blockchain provider also achieves greater profit. This indicates
that the attack may incur more loss to the blockchain provider.
Therefore, the blockchain provider has a higher incentive to
invest in the infrastructure to prevent double-spending attack.
This explains the result that the investment by the blockchain
provider increases at a higher rate with α = 7.5 × 10−4
than with α = 6.5 × 10−4. As a result, the stronger social
externality reduces the successful attack probability at a higher
rate. Correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 3(f), the premium
coefficient γ decreases at a higher rate with the stronger
social externality. This result indicates that the premium also
decreases at a higher rate with stronger social externality.
Thus, the cyber-insurer’s profit decreases at a higher rate when
the social externality becomes stronger as shown in Fig. 3(b).
2) The impact of attacker’s computing resource: Finally,
we evaluate in Fig. 4 the impact of the attackers’ computing
resource on the performance of the users, the blockchain

provider and the cyber-insurer. We consider three different
situations with different sizes of a block, i.e., the num-
ber of transactions included in that block, with NT = 100,
NT = 200, and NT = 300. We observe from Figs. 4(a)
and (b) that as the attacker’s computing resource increases,
the profit of the blockchain provider decreases and the profit
of the cyber-insurer remains unchanged. The reason is that
the blockchain provider needs to increase its infrastructure
investment when the attacker’s computing resource increases
(see Fig. 4(e)). Otherwise, the successful attack probability
will significantly increase, and it results in the increase in the
cost of the blockchain provider. With an increasing computing
resource controlled by the attackers, the investment ratio of
the blockchain provider cannot remain as high as before.
This result is illustrated in Fig. 4(e) with h∗

when NT = 300. Therefore, as the attackers’
computing resource increases, the successful attack probability
and consequently the probability of the cyber-insurer paying
the claim increases accordingly. Then, as shown in Fig. 4(f),
the cyber-insurer increases the premium to keep its profit
unchanged. Ultimately, the cost of the blockchain provider
also increases. Moreover, as the attackers’ computing resource
increases, even when the blockchain provider reduces the price
of its service to attract more users, the total demand from the
users still decreases (see Figs. 4(c) and (d)). Consequently, this
reduces the revenue and profit of the blockchain provider.
Furthermore, we show that the impact of the attackers’
computing resource on the other parties in the market is subject
to the number of transactions in one block NT. With the fixed
transaction fee and compensation rate, the more transactions
in a single block is, the more reward that the blockchain
provider obtains from mining a block. Moreover, since the
compensation price of one block increases as the number of
transactions in one block increases, the more compensation
it will pay to the users once the attacks happen. Then, the
blockchain provider has more incentive to invest in the com-
puting resource. This is consistent with Fig. 4(e), where the
increasing rate of the investment by the blockchain provider
is higher with NT = 300 than that with NT = 100. On the
other hand, as the attacker’s computing resource increases, the
increasing rate of the successful attack probability is lower
with NT = 300 than that with NT = 100. Consequently, the
increasing rate of the premium is lower with NT = 300 than
that with NT = 100 (see Fig. 4(f)). Moreover, as NT increases,
the increasing rate of the successful attack probability will
decrease, and the users’ demand will be less affected. This is
consistent with Figs. 4(c) and (d), where the decreasing rates
of both the total user demand and the service price shrink as
NT increases.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, to financially protect the blockchain provider
from double-spending attacks, we have proposed a risk man-
agement framework of the blockchain service market by
incorporating the cyber-insurance. The interaction among the
blockchain provider, cyber-insurer, and users in the market
has been modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game. For the
blockchain provider, we have considered the problem of bal-
ancing between the proactive protection strategy, i.e., investing
in computing power, and the reactive protection strategy, i.e.,
purchasing the cyber-insurance. For the users, we have consid-
ered the impact of both the social externality and the service
security on the users’ valuation of the blockchain service.
In particular, for the cyber-insurer, we have incorporated the
risk-adjusted pricing mechanism for premium adaptation. We
have studied the equilibrium strategies of the three parties in
the market using backward induction. We have analytically
examined the conditions for the Stackelberg game to exist
and to be unique. Furthermore, we have conducted extensive
simulations to evaluate the performance of the market entities
at the equilibrium. For the future work, we will investigate
the long-run competition between the blockchain provider and
cyber-insurer.
