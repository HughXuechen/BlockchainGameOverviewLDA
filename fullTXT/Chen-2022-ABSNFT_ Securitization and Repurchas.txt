Abstract. The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is viewed as one of the
important applications of blockchain technology. Currently NFT has
a large market scale and multiple practical standards, however several
limitations of the existing mechanism in NFT markets still exist. This
work proposes a novel securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT to
overcome these limitations. We first provide an Asset-Backed Securities
(ABS) solution to settle the limitations of non-fungibility of NFT. Our
securitization design aims to enhance the liquidity of NFTs and enable
Oracles and Automatic Market Makers (AMMs) for NFTs. Then we
propose a novel repurchase protocol for a participant owing a portion
of NFT to repurchase other shares to obtain the complete ownership.
As the participants may strategically bid during the acquisition process,
we formulate the repurchase process as a Stackelberg game to explore
the equilibrium prices. We also provide solutions to handle difficulties at
market such as budget constraints and lazy bidders.

1 Introduction
Ever since the birth of the first piece of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) [11,23],
the world has witnessed an extraordinarily fast growth of its popularity. NFT
markets, especially Opensea1, have prospered with glamorous statistics of a total
of over 80 million pieces of NFTs on the platform and a total transaction volume
of over 10 billion US dollars.2

NFT is a type of cryptocurrency that each token is non-fungible. The first
standard of NFT, ERC-721 [10], gives support to a type of tokens that each has
a unique identifier. The feature of uniqueness makes NFTs usually be tied to
specific assets, such as digital artwork and electronic pets. Some researches also
explore the application of NFT in patent, copyright and physical assets [5,20].
The technology of NFT has also advanced rapidly. Besides ERC-721, ERC-
1155 [9] is also a popular standard of NFT. ERC-1155 is a flexible standard
that supports multiple series of tokens, each series is a type of NFT or Fungible
Token (FT). NFT protocols are usually derived by smart contracts in a per-
missionless blockchain, but there are now some NFT designs for permissioned
blockchains [12].
Although NFT has a large market scale and multiple practical standards,
there still exist several limitations in NFT market, one of which is the poor
liquidity. The issue of liquidity is crucial in both De-fi and traditional finance.
Usually, if assets have higher liquidity, they would have higher trading volume,
and further have higher prices [2]. Particularly, in blockchain, the liquidity of
Fungible Tokens, such as wBTC and ETH, has been enhanced by Oracles [17] and
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) [3] like Uniswap and Sushiswap. However,
the non-fungibility property of NFT leads to poor liquidity. For this reason, the
existing NFT marketplace usually uses the English Auction or Dutch Auction
to trade NFTs [14].
– Firstly, Non-Fungibility means indivisible. As the NFT series with the highest
market value, CryptoPunks has an average trading price of 189 Eth3, which is
worth more than 790, 000 U.S. dollars4. If bitcoins are expensive, we can trade
0.01 bitcoins, but we can’t trade 0.01 CryptoPunks. As a result, the liquidity
of CryptoPunks is significantly lower than other NFT series. Therefore, the
liquidity for NFTs with high values is limited.
– Secondly, shared ownership is not allowed because of Non-Fungibility. There-
fore, it’s difficult to reduce risk and enhance the liquidity of NFTs through
portfolios. What’s more, Some NFT assets such as patents need financial
support to foster the process of development. They would require a means to
attract finance. The above two limitations also exist in traditional settings.
– Thirdly, the feature of non-fungible makes NFT unable to be directly applied
in Oracles [17] and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) [3], which are impor-
tant methods of pricing in the blockchain. This is because fungibility is the
basis of Oracles and AMMs.
1.1 Main Contributions
We present ABSNFT, a securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT, which
overcomes the above-mentioned limitations from the following three aspects.

– Firstly, we propose an Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) [4] solution to settle the
limitations of non-fungibility of NFT. We design a smart contract including
three parts: NFT Securitization Process, NFT Repurchase Process, and NFT
Restruction Process. In our smart contract, a complete NFT can be securi-
tized into fungible securities, and fungible securities can be reconstructed into
a complete NFT.
The securitization process manages to resolve the majority of issues the cur-
rent NFT application is confronted with: the securities of NFT have lower
values compared to the complete one before securitization, which increases
market liquidity; securities could act as fungible tokens that can be applied
in Oracles and AMMs; the investment risk is being reduced dramatically;
financing is possible since securities can belong to different owners.
– Secondly, we design a novel repurchase process based on Stackelberg
game [21], which provides a mechanism to repurchase NFT securities at a
fair price. The NFT Repurchase Process can be triggered by the participant
who owns more than half of the securities of the NFT. We analyze the Stack-
elberg Equilibrium (SE) in three different settings and get good theoretical
results.
– Thirdly, we propose solutions to the budget constraints and lazy bidders,
which make good use of the decentralization of blockchain. We propose a
protocol that allows participants to accept financial support in the repurchase
game to reduce the influence of budget constraints. We also propose two
solutions for players that might not bid in the game, which prevent the game
process from being blocked and protect the utility of lazy bidders.
1.2 Related Works
In financial research, there are two well-studied repurchase scenarios, repurchase
agreement and stock repurchase.
Repurchase agreement is a short-term transaction between two parties in
which one party borrows cash from the other by pledging a financial security
as collateral [1]. The former party is called the security issuer, and the latter
party is called the investors. To avoid the failure of liquidation, the security
issuer needs to mortgage assets or credit. An instance of such work from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Quarterly Review introduces and analyzes
a repurchase agreement for federal funds [16]. The Quarterly Review describes
the repurchase agreement as “involving little risk”, as either parties’ interests
are been safeguarded.
Studies of repurchase agreement cannot be directly applied to our topic. The
key point is that the problem we are studying is not to mortgage NFTs to obtain
cash flow, but to securitize NFTs to overcome the restrictions of non-fungibility.
What’s more, the repurchase prices are usually derived from the market model.
But the NFT market is not as mature as the financial market, which makes it
hard to calculate a fair price through the market model.
Stock repurchase refers to the behavior that listed companies repurchase
stocks from the stockholders at a certain price [8]. Usually, stock repurchase is
410 H. Chen et al.
adopted to release positive signals to the stock market and doesn’t aim to repur-
chase all stocks. However, NFTs usually need to be complete without securities
in cross-chain scenarios.
Oxygen [18] is a decentralized platform that supports repurchase agreement
based on digital assets. In Oxygen, users can borrow cash flow or assets with
good liquidity by pledging assets with poor liquidity. The repurchase prices and
the evaluations of assets are provided by a decentralized exchange, Serum [19].
However, such pricing method is dangerous because decentralized exchanges are
very vulnerable to attacks like flash loans [22].
ABSNFT is distinguished among all these works because it adapts well to
the particularities of NFT market and blockchain.
– Firstly, the securities in ABSNFT represent property rights rather than cred-
itor’s rights. Investors do not need to worry that the cash flow or the mort-
gaged assets of the securities issuer may not cover the liquidation, which may
be risky in a repurchase agreement. What’s more, any investor can trigger a
repurchase process as long as he owns more than half of the shares.
– Secondly, the repurchase process of ABSNFT doesn’t depend on market mod-
els or exchanges. The repurchase price is decided by the bids given by partic-
ipants, and every participant won’t get negative utility if he bids truthfully.
– Thirdly, ABSNFT has well utilized the benefits of blockchain technology.
The tradings of securities are driven by the smart contract. The operations
of ABSNFT don’t rely on centralized third-party and are available 24 × 7 for
participants.
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the NFT
securitization process. In Sect. 3 and Sect. 4, we study the two-player repurchase
game in a single round and the repeated setting. In Sect. 5, we analyze the
repurchase game with multiple leaders and one follower. In Sect. 6, we discuss the
solution to the issues with budget constraints and lazy bidders in the blockchain
setting. In the last section, we give a summary of ABSNFT and propose some
future works.
2 NFT Securitization and Repurchase Scheme
In this section, we would like to introduce the general framework of the smart
contract, denoted by CNFT , which includes the securitization process, the trad-
ing process, repurchase process and restruction process for a given NFT.
2.1 Basic Setting of NFT Smart Contract
There are two kinds of NFTs discussed in this paper.
– Complete NFT. Complete NFTs are conventional non-fungible tokens,
which appear in blockchain systems as a whole. Each complete NFT has
a unique token ID. We use CNFT (id) to denote one complete NFT with
token ID of id.
ABSNFT 411
– Securitized NFT. Securitized NFTs are the Asset Based Securities of
complete NFTs. A complete NFT may be securitized into an amount of secu-
ritized units. All units of securitized NFTs from a complete NFT CNFT (id)
have the same ID, associated with the ID of CNFT (id). Thus we denote the
securitized NFT by SNFT (id). In our smart contract, all securitized NFTs
can be freely traded.
In our setting, all complete NFTs and securitized NFTs belong to one smart
contract, denoted by CNFT . Although the securitized NFTs are similar to the
fungible tokens in ERC-1155 standard [9], our smart contract CNFT is actually
quite different from ERC-1155 standard. That is because all securitized NFTs
in CNFT , associated to one complete NFT, have the same ID, while different
NFTs and different fungible tokens generally have different token IDs in ERC-
1155 standard. Therefore, our CNFT is based on ERC-721 standard [10], and the
complete NFTs are just the NFTs defined in ERC-721. Table 1 lists all functions
in CNFT .
Table 1. The key functions of CNFT
Function name Function utility
CNFTownerOf(id) Return the address of the owner of CNFT (id)
CNFTtransferFrom
(addr1, addr2, id)
Transfer the ownership of CNFT (id) from address
addr1 to address addr2. Only the owner of CNFT (id)
has the right to trigger this function
SNFTtotalSupply(id) Return the total amount of SNFT (id) in contract CNFT
SNFTbalanceOf(addr, id) Return the amount of SNFT (id) owned by address addr
SNFTtransferFrom
(addr1,addr2, id, amount)
Transfer the ownership of amout unit of SNFT (id) from
address addr1 to address addr2
CNFTsecuritization
(addr, id, amount)
Freeze CNFT (id), and then transfer amout units of
SNFT (id) to address addr. Only the owner of
CNFT (id) can trigger this function
CNFTrestruction(addr, id) Burn all SNFT (id), unfreeze CNFT (id), and then
transfer the ownership of CNFT (id) to address addr.
Only the one who owns all amounts of SNFT (id) can
trigger this function
Repurchase(id) Start the repurchase process of SNFT (id). Only the one
who owns more than half amounts of SNFT (id) can
trigger this function
The task of smart contract CNFT includes securitizing complete NFTs, trad-
ing the securitized NFTs among participants, and restructing complete NFT
after repurchasing all securitized NFTs with the same ID. Because the trans-
actions of securitized NFTs are similar to those of fungible tokens, we omit
the trading process here and introduce NFT securitization process, NFT repur-
chase process and NFT restruction process in the subsequent three subsections
respectively.
412 H. Chen et al.
2.2 NFT Securitization Process
This subsection focuses on the issue of Asset-Backed Securities for Complete
NFTs. We propose Algorithm 1 to demonstrate the NFT securitization process.
To be specific, once CNFTsecuritization(addr, id, amount) is triggered by the
owner of CNFT (id), the amount units of securitized NFTs are generated and
transferred to address addr in Line 2–4; then the ownership of CNFT (id) would
be transferred to a fixed address FrozenAddr in Line 5.
It is worth to note that if Repurchase(id) has not been triggered, securitized
NFTs can be freely traded in blockchain system.
Algorithm 1. NFT Securitization
1: procedure CNFTsecuritization � Triggered by sender
2: require(sender == CNFTownerOf(id)) � sender is the owner of CNFT (id)
3: totalSupply[id] ← amount � Record the total amount of units of SNFT (id)
4: tokenBalance[id][addr] ← amount � the amount units SNFT (id) are
generated and transferred to address addr
5: CNFTtransferFrom(sender, FrozenAddr, id) � Freeze CNFT (id)
2.3 NFT Repurchase Process
After the securitization process, a complete NFT CNFT (id) is securitized
into M units of SNFT (id). Suppose that there are k + 1 participants, N =
{N0, · · · , Nk}, each owning mi units of SNFT (id). Thus
∑k
i=0 mi = M . If
there is one participant, denoted by N0, owing more than half of SNFT (id) (i.e.
m0 > 1
2M), then he can trigger the repurchase process by trading with each
Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. Majority is a natural requirement for a participant to trigger
a repurchase mechanism, and thus our repurchase mechanism sets the threshold
as 1
2 . In addition, if the trigger condition is satisfied (i.e., someone holds more
than half of shares), then there must be exactly one participant who can trigger
the repurchase mechanism. This makes our mechanism easy to implement. Our
mechanism also works well if the threshold is larger than 1
2 .
Let vi be Ni’s value estimate for one unit of SNFT (id) and pi be the bid
provided by Ni, i = 0, · · · , k, in a deal. Specially, our smart contract CNFT
requires each value vi ∈ {1, · · · } and bid pi ∈ {0, 1, · · · } to discretize our analysis.
We assume that the estimation of vi is private information of Ni, not known to
others. The main reason is that most of NFT objects, such as digital art pieces,
would be appreciated differently in different eyes. Participants may have different
opinions about a same NFT, which makes each of them has a private value vi.
Without loss of generality, we assume that Ni’s private value on the complete
NFT is M · vi.
ABSNFT 413
Mechanism 1 (Repurchase Mechanism). Suppose participant N0 owes
more than half of SNFT (id) and triggers the repurchase mechanism. For the
repurchase between N0 and Ni, i = 1, · · · , k,
– if p0 ≥ pi, then N0 successfully repurchases mi units of SNFT (id) from Ni
at the unit price of p0+pi
2 ;
– if p0 ≤ pi − 1, then N0 fails to repurchase, and then he shall sell mi units
of SNFT (id) to Ni. The unit price that Ni pays is p0+pi
2 , and N0 obtains a
discounted revenue p0+pi−1
2 for each unit of SNFT (id).
Mechanism 1 requires that the repurchase process only happens between N0
and Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. If p0 ≥ pi, then N0 successfully repurchases mi units of
SNFT (id) from Ni, and the utilities of N0 and Ni are
U i
0(p0, pi) = mi(v0 − p0 + pi
2
), Ui(p0, pi) = mi(
p0 + pi
2
− vi), if p0 ≥ pi. (1)
If p0 < pi, then N0 fails to repurchase from Ni, and the utilities of N0 and Ni
are
U i
0(p0, pi) = mi(
p0 + pi − 1
2
− v0), Ui(p0, pi) = mi(vi − p0 + pi
2
), if p0 ≤ pi − 1. (2)
All participants must propose their bids rationally under Mechanism 1. If
the bid p0 is too low, N0 would face the risk of repurchase failure. Thus, the
securities of N0 would be purchased by other participants at a low price, and
N0’s utility may be negative. Similarly, if bid pi of Ni, i = 1, · · · , k, is too high,
Ni would purchase securities with an extra high price and get negative utility.
However, if a participant bids truthfully, he always obtains non-negative utility.
During the repurchase process, the key issue for each participant is how to bid
pi, i = 0, · · · , k, based on its own value estimation. To solve this issue, we would
model the repurchase process as a stackelberg game to explore the equilibrium
pricing solution in the following Sects. 3 to 5.
2.4 NFT Restruction Process
Once one participant successfully repurchases all securitized NFTs, he has the
right to trigger CNFTrestruction(addr, id), shown in Algorithm 2, to burn
these securitized NFTs in Line 3 to 4 and unfreeze CNFT (id), such that the
ownership of CNFT (id) would be transferred from address FrozenAddr to this
participant’s address addr in Line 5.
After NFT restruction, all SNFT (id) are burnt, and CNFT (id) is unfrozen.
The owner of CNFT (id) has the right to securitize it or trade it as a whole.
3 Two-Player Repurchase Stackelberg Game
This section discusses the repurchase process for a two-player scenario. To be spe-
cific, in the two-player scenario, when a player owns more than half of SNFT (id),
414 H. Chen et al.
Algorithm 2. NFT Restruction
1: procedure CNFTrestruction � Triggered by sender
2: require(tokenBalance[id][sender] == totalSupply[id]) � sender should be the
owner of all SNFT (id)
3: totalSupply[id] ← 0 � Burn all SNFT (id)
4: tokenBalance[id][sender] ← 0 � Burn all SNFT (id)
5: CNFTtransferFrom(FrozenAddr, addr, id) � Unfreeze CNFT (id)
denoted by N0, he will trigger the repurchase process with another player N1. To
explore the optimal bidding strategy for both players, we model the repurchase
process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which N1 acts as the leader to set
its bid p1 in Stage I, and N0, as the follower, decides its bid p0 in Stage II. Recall
that all bids and all values are in {0, 1, · · · }.
(1) N0’s bidding strategy in Stage II: Given the bid of p1, set by N1 in Stage I,
N0 decides its bid to maximize its utility, which is given as:
U0(p0, p1) =
{
m1(v0 − p0+p1
2 ) if p0 ≥ p1;
m1(p0+p1−1
2 − v0) if p0 ≤ p1 − 1.
(3)
(2) N1’s bidding strategy in Stage I: Once obtain the optimal bid p∗
0(p1) of N0
in Stage II, which is dependent on p1, N1 goes to compute the optimal bid
p∗
1 by maximizing his utility function maxp1U1(p∗
0(p1), p1), where
U1(p0, p1) =
{
m1(p0+p1
2 − v1) if p1 ≤ p0;
m1(v1 − p0+p1
2 ) if p1 ≥ p0 + 1.
(4)
3.1 Analysis Under Complete Information
(1) Best response of N0in Stage II. Given the bid p1 provided by N1, in
Stage II, N0 shall determine the best response p∗
0(p1) to maximize his utility.
Lemma 1. In the two-stage Stackelberg game for repurchase process, if the bid
p1 is given in Stage I, the best response of N0 in Stage II is
p∗
0(p1) =
{
p1 − 1 if p1 ≥ v0 + 1
p1 if p1 ≤ v0
(5)
Proof. According to (3), U0 is monotonically increasing when p0 ≤ p1 − 1 and
monotonically decreasing when p0 ≥ p1. So p∗
0(p1) ∈ {p1 − 1, p1}. In addition,
when p1 ≥ v0 + 1, we have
U0(p0 = p1, p1) = m1(v0 − p1) < 0 ≤ m1(p1 − 1 − v0) = U0(p0 = p1 − 1, p1).
It implies that the best response of N0 is p∗
0(p1) = p1 − 1 if p1 ≥ v0 + 1. When
p1 ≤ v0, we have
U0(p0 = p1, p1) = m1(v0 − p1) ≥ 0 > m1(p1 − 1 − v0) = U0(p0 = p1 − 1, p1).
So under the situation of p0 ≤ v0, the best response of N0 is p∗
0(p1) = p1. ��
ABSNFT 415
(2) The optimal strategy of N1 in Stage I. The leader N1 would like to
optimize his bidding strategy to maximize his utility shown in (4).
Lemma 2. In the two-stage Stackelberg game for repurchase process, the opti-
mal bidding strategy for the leader N1 is
p∗
1 =
{
v0 if v1 ≤ v0
v0 + 1 if v1 ≥ v0 + 1.
(6)
Proof. Based on Lemma 1, we have
U1(p∗
0(p1), p1) =
{
m1(p1 − v1) if p1 ≤ v0;
m1(v1 − p1 + 1
2 ) if p1 ≥ v0 + 1.
Thus U1 is monotonically increasing when p1 ≤ v0 and monotonically decreasing
when p1 ≥ v0 + 1, indicating the optimal bidding strategy p∗
1 ∈ {v0, v0 + 1}. In
addition, for the case of v0 ≥ v1, if p1 = v0, then p∗
0(p1) = p1 = v0 by Lemma
1 and U1(v0, v0) = m1(v0 − v1) ≥ 0. On the other hand, if p1 = v0 + 1, then
p∗
0(p1) = p1 − 1 = v0 by Lemma 1 and U1(v0, v0 + 1) = m1(v1 − v0 − 1
2 ) < 0.
Therefore, U1(v0, v0) > U1(v0, v0 + 1), showing the optimal bidding strategy of
N1 is p∗
1 = v0 when v0 ≥ v1. Similarly, for the case of v0 ≤ v1 − 1, we can
conclude that p∗
1 = v0 + 1. This lemma holds. ��
Combining Lemmas 1 and 2, the following theorem can be derived directly.
Theorem 1. When v0 ≥ v1, there is exactly one Stackelberg equilibrium where
p∗
1 = p∗
0 = v0. And when v0 ≤ v1 −1, there is exactly one Stackelberg equilibrium
where p∗
0 = v0, p∗
1 = v0 + 1.
Furthermore, the following theorem demonstrates the relation between Stack-
elberg equilibrium and Nash equilibrium, whose proof is shown in the full ver-
sion [6] of this paper.
Theorem 2. Each Stackelberg equilibrium in Theorem 1 is also a Nash equilib-
rium.
3.2 Analysis of Bayesian Stackelberg Equilibrium
In the previous subsection, the Stackelberg equilibrium is deduced based on the
complete information about the value estimate v0 and v1. However, the value
estimates may be private in practice, which motivates us to study the Bayesian
Stackelberg game with incomplete information. In this proposed game, although
the value estimate vi is not known to others, except for itself Ni, i = 0, 1, the
probability distribution of each Vi is public to all. Here we use Vi to denote
the random variable of value estimate. Based on the assumption that all Vi
are integers, we continue to assume that each Ni’s value estimate Vi has finite
integer states, denoted by v1i , v
2
i , · · · , vki
i , and its discrete probability distribution
is Pro(Vi = vli) = P l
i , l = 1, · · · , ki, and
∑ki
l=1 P
l
i = 1, i = 0, 1.
416 H. Chen et al.
(1) Best response of N0in Stage II. Because v0 is deterministic to N0, and
p1 is given by N1 in Stage I, Lemma 1 still holds, so
p∗
0(p1) =
{
p1 − 1 if p1 ≥ v0 + 1;
p1 if p1 ≤ v0.
(2) Optimal bidding strategy of N1in Stage I. By Lemma 1, we have
U1(p∗
0(p1), p1) =
{
m1(p1 − v1) if p1 ≤ v0;
m1(v1 − p1 + 1
2 ) if p1 ≥ v0 + 1.
Based on the probability distribution of V0, the expected utility of U1 is:
E1(p1) =
∑
vl
0≥p1
m1(p1 − v1)P l
0 +
∑
vl
0≤p1−1 m1(v1 − p1 + 1
2 )P l
0 (7)
To be specific, if p1 ≥ vk0
0 +1, then E1(p1) = m1(v1−p1+ 1
2 ), and N1 obtains his
maximal expected utility at p∗
1 = vk0
0 +1. If p1 ≤ v10 , then E1(p1) = m1(p1 −v1),
and N1 obtains his maximal expected utility at p∗
1 = v10 . If there exists an index
l, such that vl−1
0 < p1 ≤ vl0, l = 2, · · · , k0, then
E1(p1) =
l−1∑
h=1
m1(v1 − p1 +
1
2
)Ph
0 +
k0∑
h=l
m1(p1 − v1)Ph
0 .
Therefore, N1 can obtain his maximal expected utility at p∗
1 = vl0, when
∑k0
h=l P
h
0 ≥ ∑l−1
h=1 P
h
0 . Otherwise, N1’s maximal expected utility is achieved
at p∗
1 = vl−1
0 + 1. Hence, the optimal bid p∗
1 ∈ {vl0, vl0 + 1}l=1,··· ,k0 .
Theorem 3. There is a Stackelberg equilibrium in the Bayesian Stackelberg
game.
(1) If p∗
1 ≤ v0, then p0 = p∗
1 and p1 = p∗
1 is a Stackelberg equilibrium.
(2) If p∗
1 ≥ v0 + 1, then p0 = p∗
1 − 1 and p1 = p∗
1 is a Stackelberg equilibrium.
4 Repeated Two-Player Stackelberg Game
This section would extend the study of the one-round Stackelberg game in the
previous section to the repeated Stackelberg game. Before our discussion, we con-
struct the basic model of a repeated two-player Stackelberg game by introducing
the necessary notations.
Definition 1. Repeated two-player Stackelberg repurchase game is given by a
tuple Gr = (M,N, V, S, L, P, U), where:
– N = {N0, N1} is the set of two participants. The role of being a leader or a
follower may change in the whole repeated process.
ABSNFT 417
– M is the total amount of SNFT (id). W.l.o.g., we assume that M is odd,
such that one of {N0, N1} must have more than half of SNFT (id).
– V = {v0, v1} is the set of participants’ value estimates. Let vi ∈ {1, 2, 3, · · · }
be an integer.
– S = {s1, s2, · · · , st, z} is the set of sequential states. sj = (mj

0 + mj
1 = M , and mj
0 �= mj
1 because M is odd.
z ∈ Z = {z0, z1} represents the terminal state, where z0 = (M, 0), z1 =
(0,M). If the sequential states are infinity, then t = +∞. Let us denote
(mt+1
0 ,mt+1
1 ) = z.
– L = {l1, l2, · · · , lt} is the set of sequential leaders, where lj is the leader in the
j-th round. To be specific, lj = N1, if mj
0 > mj
1; otherwise, lj = N0. It shows
the participant who triggers the repurchase process in each round should be
the follower.
– Pi = {p1i , p2i , · · · , pti} is the set of sequential prices bidded by Ni, pji ∈
{0, 1, 2, · · · }.
– Ui : S × P0 × P1 −→ R is the utility function of player Ni in a single round.
The detailed expressions of Ui will be proposed later.
In practice, vi, i = 0, 1, may not be common information. However, we can
extract them from the historical interaction data of the repeated game by online
learning [24] or reinforcement learning [15] methods. Therefore, we mainly dis-
cuss the case with complete information in this section.
Repeated Stackelberg Game Procedure. Repeated game Gr consists of
several rounds, and each round contains two stages. In the j-th round,
– In Stage I, the leader provides a bid pji ∈ {0, 1, · · · }.
– In Stage II, the follower provides a bid pj1−i ∈ {0, 1, · · · }.
– If pji ≤ pj1−i, N1−i successfully purchased mj
i units of SNFT (id) from Ni at
the unit price of
pj
i+pj
1−i
2 .
– If pji ≥ pj1−i + 1, Ni purchases mj
i units of SNFT (id) from N1−i at the unit
price of
pj
i+pj
1−i
2 . And N1−i only obtains a discounted revenue mj
i · pj
i+pj
1−i−1

Proof. For the j-th round, let Ni = lj be the leader and thus N1−i is the follower.
Since there are only two players, all SNFT (id) will belong to one player, if the
follower can successfully repurchase SNFT (id) from the leader, and then the
repeated game stops. It means that in the j-th round, mj
i units of SNFT (id) is
bought by N1−i from Ni and the game stops at the terminal state z1−i. So if the
repeated game goes through indefinitely, it must be that in each j ∈ {1, 2, · · · },
pji > pj1−i, and Ni buys mj
i from N1−i. Thus in the j+1-th round, mj+1

This result holds. ��
Combining Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we have the following conclusion.
Lemma 5. If there is a Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player repeated Stack-
elberg game, then U0 + U1 ≥ 0 in this Stackelberg equilibrium.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that U0+U1 < 0 in this Stackelberg equilibrium,
then there must exist i ∈ {0, 1}, such that Ui < 0. However, by Lemma 3, we
know that if each player sets its price as pji = vi, then its utility U j
i ≥ 0. Hence
Ni can obtain more utility by setting pji = vi, which is a contradiction that Ni
doesn’t give the best response in this Stackelberg equilibrium. ��
Combining Lemma 4 and Lemma 5, we have
Lemma 6. If there is a Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player repeated Stack-
elberg game, then the repeated game stops in a finite number of steps, meaning
t < +∞, in this Stackelberg equilibrium.
The following theorem states that once a Stackelberg equilibrium exists and
vi > v1−i, then this player Ni must buy all SNFT (id) at last.
Theorem 4. If vi > v1−i, i = 0, 1, and a Stackelberg equilibrium exists, then
z = zi, in all Stackelberg equilibria.

If v0 > v1, then it must be mt+1
0 > m1
0. Otherwise, U0 + U1 < 0, showing no
Stackelberg equilibrium exists. This is a contradiction. Because the repeated
game stops in a finite number of steps, mt+1
0 ∈ {0,M}. Combing the condition
mt+1
0 > m1
0 > 0, we have mt+1
0 = M . Therefore, at last z = z0. Similarly, it is
easy to deduce z = z1 if v1 > v0. ��

Based on Theorem 4, we go to prove the existence of the Stackelberg equi-
librium by proposing an equilibrium strategy in the following theorem. Its proof
is provided in the full version [6] of this paper.

5 Multi-player Repurchase Stackelberg Game
This section goes to extend the discussion for the multi-player scenario, in which
N0 has more than half of SNFT (id), and {N1, · · · , Nk} are repurchased par-
ticipants. N0 triggers the repurchase process, and asks all other repurchased
participants to report their bids pi at first, and N0 decides his bid p0 later. We
also model the repurchase process of the multi-player scenario as a two-stage
Stackelberg game, where {N1, · · · , Nk} are the leaders to determine their bids
in Stage I, and N0 acts as the followers to decide his bid p0 in Stage II. Different
from the two-player scenario, N0 shall trade with each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. Then
each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k, has his utility Ui(p0, pi) as (1) and (2). But the utility of
N0 is the total utility from the trading with all Ni. That is
U0(p0, p1, · · · , pk) =
k∑
i=1
U i
0(p0, pi),
where U i
0(p0, p1) is defined as (1) and (2).
5.1 Analysis of Stackelberg Equilibrium
In the Stackelberg repurchase game for multi-player scenario, N0 shall trade with
each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. Inspired by the Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player
Stackelberg game, we first discuss the best response of N0, if each Ni reports his
bid as
p∗
i =
{
v0 if vi ≤ v0;
v0 + 1 if vi ≥ v0 + 1.
(12)
Then we study the collusion from a group of repurchased players. Our task is
to prove that once a group of repurchased participants deviate from the bidding
strategy (12), then their total utility must be decreased. This guarantees that
each participant would like to follow the bidding strategy (12).
Lemma 7. In the Stackelberg repurchase game for the multi-player scenario, if
all leaders set their bids {p∗
i } as (12) in Stage I, then the best response of the
follower N0 in Stage II is p∗
0(p
∗
1, · · · , p∗
n) = v0.
ABSNFT 421
Proof. For each trading between N0 and Ni, i = 1, · · · , k, Lemma 1 ensures that
v0 = argmaxp0U
i
0(p0, p
∗
i ). Since each U i
0(p0, p
∗
i ) ≥ 0, we have
p∗
0(p
∗
1, · · · , p∗
k) = argmax
p0
U0(p0, p∗
1, · · · , p∗
k) = argmax
p0
k∑
i=1
U i
0(p0, p
∗
i ) = v0.
This lemma holds. ��
To study the collusion of repurchased participants, we partition the set of
{N1, · · · , Nk} into two disjoint subsets A and B, such that each Ni ∈ A fol-
lows the bidding strategy (12), while each Ni ∈ B does not. Thus given all bids
provided by players, the bid profile p = (p0, {p∗
i }Ni∈A, {pi}Ni∈B) can be equiv-
alently expressed as p = (p0,p∗
A,pB). Here we are interested in the total utility
of all players in B, and thus define
UB(p0,p∗
A,pB) =
∑
Ni∈B
Ui(p0, pi).
Following Lemma shows that once a group of participants deviate from the
bidding strategy (12), then their total utility decreases. The proof is in the full
version [6] of this paper.
Lemma 8. Let A = {Ni|pi = p∗
i } and B = {Ni|pi �= p∗
i }. Then
UB(p∗
0(p
∗
A,pB),p∗
A,pB) < UB(v0, p∗
1, p
∗
2, · · · , p∗
k).
Theorem 6. In the multi-player Stackelberg repurchase game, the bid profile
(v0, p∗
1 · · · , p∗
k) is a Stackelberg equilibrium, where p∗
i is set as (12).
Proof. To simplify our discussion, we define the price profile p∗ = (p∗
1, · · · , p∗
k),
and p∗
−i denotes the profile without the price of Ni. So p∗ = (p∗
−i, p
∗
i ). From
Lemma 7, we have the best response of N0 in Stage II is p∗
0(p
∗) = v0. How-
ever, Lemma 8 indicates that no one would like to deviate from the pricing
strategy (12), as Ui(p∗
0(p
∗
−i, pi),p
∗
−i, pi) < Ui(v0,p∗
i ). Thus given the price pro-
file p∗, nobody would like to change its strategy p∗
i unilaterally. Therefore,
(v0, p∗
1 · · · , p∗
k) is a Stackelberg equilibrium. ��
From the perspective of cooperation, we can observe that no group of repur-
chased participants would like to collude to deviate from the bidding strategy
(12) by Lemma 8. Thus we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. Given the Stackelberg equilibrium of (v0, p∗
1 · · · , p∗
k), no group of
repurchased participants would like to deviate this equilibrium.
In the case of incomplete information, the analysis of the Bayesian Stackel-
berg equilibrium becomes extremely complicated. As discussed in Sect. 3.2, in
the case of the two-player Stackelberg game, the leader only needs to optimize
the utility based on incomplete information. However, when there are multiple
leaders, the strategies of leaders should reach a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which
is much more difficult to calculate. So we regard it as our future work to analyze
the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium of the multi-player repurchase Stackelberg
game.

6 Discussion
6.1 A Blockchain Solution to Budget Constraints
In the previous settings, we do not consider the budget constraints. However,
this is a common problem for many newly proposed mechanisms. Therefore, we
propose a solution scheme by blockchain for the setting with budget constraints.
Suppose N0 owes more than half of SNFT (id) and triggers the repurchase
process. Our mechanism consists of two stages. All participants except for N0
report their bids in Stage I, and N0 gives his bid p0 in Stage II. We assume N0’s
budget is larger than (M−m0)p0, so that he can repurchase all other shares at his
bid p0. For Ni, i �= 0, if pi > p0, Ni should pay p0+pi
2 mi. However, the payment
of p0+pi
2 mi may exceed his budget, such that Ni has not enough money to buy
mi units of SNFT (id). Under this situation, we provide a blockchain solution
for Ni to solve the problem of budget shortage. That is, we allow Ni to sell his
option of buying mi units of SNFT (id) to anyone in the blockchain system. If
nobody would like to buy Ni’s repurchase option, then N0 can repurchase Ni’s
shares at a lower price. Therefore, after reporting bids, additional four steps are
needed to finish the payment procedure.
– Step 1. N0 pays
∑
i∈{1,2,··· ,k},pi≤p0
p0+pi
2 mi. After the payment, N0 gets
∑
i∈{1,2,··· ,k},pi≤p0
mi pieces of SNFT (id). For each Ni with pi ≤ p0,
i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , k}, he gets the revenue of p0+pi
2 · mi and loses mi units of
SNFT (id).
– Step 2. For all i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , k} that pi > p0, Ni shall pay p0+pi
2 · mi to buy
mi units of SNFT (id) from N0. Once mi units of SNFT (id) of N0 is sold
to Ni, N0 obtains a discounted revenue p0+pi−1
2 · mi.
If Ni would not like to repurchase SNFT (id), then he can sell his repurchase
option to others at a price of p̃i ∈ Z. The price of repurchase option p̃i could
be negative, meaning that Ni shall pay p̃i to another who accepts his chance.
If Ni does nothing, we regard that Ni proposes p̃i = 0.
– Step 3. If a participant in the blockchain system accepts the price of p̃i, then
he would propose a transaction to buy mi units of SNFT (id) from N0. The
total cost of this participant is p̃i + p0+pi
2 · mi, in which p̃i is paid to Ni and
N0 obtains a discounted revenue of p0+pi−1
2 ·mi. And mi units of SNFT (id)
are transferred from N0 to the participant who buys the repurchase option.
At the end of this step, let C be the participant set, in which each participant’s
repurchase option hasn’t been sold yet.
– Step 4. For each participant Ni ∈ C, N0 repurchases mi units of SNFT (id)
from Ni at a lower price of 2p0 −pi(< p0). At the end of this step, N0 obtains
mi units of SNFT (id), and Ni obtains a revenue of (2p0 − pi) · mi.
6.2 A Blockchain Solution to Lazy Bidders
Under some circumstances, an SNFT (id) holder might not bid in the repur-
chase process, who is named as a lazy bidder. This lazy behavior may block the
ABSNFT 423
repurchase process. To solve the problem caused by lazy bidders, we propose the
following two schemes.
– Custody Bidding. NFT’s smart contract supports the feature for the
SNFT (id) holders to assign administrators to report a bid when the holder
is idle or fails to make a bid.
– Value Predetermination. Whenever a participant obtains any units of
SNFT (id), this participant is required to predetermine the value at which
he is willing to bid, and this information is stored in the smart contract. At
the beginning of the repurchase process, if a participant fails to make a bid
within a certain amount of time, the smart contract automatically reports
this participant’s predetermined bid. This does not mean, however, that the
participant has to bid at the predetermined price if he decides to make an
active bid.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT
to overcome the restrictions in existing NFT markets. We model the NFT repur-
chase process as a Stackelberg game and analyze the Stackelberg equilibria under
several scenarios. To be specific, in the setting of the two-player one-round game,
we prove that in a Stackelberg equilibrium, N0, the participant who triggers the
repurchase process, shall give the bid equally to his own value estimate. In the
two-player repeated game, all securities shall be finally owned by the participant
who has a higher value estimate. In the setting of multiple players, cooperation
among participants cannot bring higher utilities to them. What’s more, each
participant can get non-negative utility if he bids truthfully in our repurchase
process.
How to securitize and repurchase NFT efficiently is a popular topic in the
field of blockchain. Our work proposes a sound solution for this problem. In the
future, we continue to refine our theoretical analysis. First, for the multi-player
repurchase Stackelberg game, we will consider the case with incomplete infor-
mation and explore the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium. Second, a model of
blockchain economics will be constructed to analyze the payment procedure in
Sect. 6.1. Furthermore, there exist some other interesting problems, including
how to securitize and repurchase a common-valued NFT [13], how to host Com-
plete NFTs or Securitized NFTs in decentralized custody protocols [7], whether
ABSNFT can serve as a price Oracle, and so on.
