ABSTRACT In online crowdsourcing services, credible accountability mechanisms are crucial for guar-
anteeing a good interactive environment. However, the crowdsourcing systems are established in virtual
environments, the identities of the participants are various and complicated, the systems could scarcely
identify malicious nodes automatically. So it is very hard to preserve the complete evidence of malicious
behaviors and investigate relevant legal responsibilities. Blockchain is regarded as a very promising solution
to these problems because it possesses characteristics of decentration, non-modifiability and traceability.
However, a main challenge is to design an applicable blockchain consensus algorithm which can reach an
agreement on credibility of participants automatically, prevent transaction data from tampering, and trace
to the source of malicious behaviors. In this paper, an improved Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus scheme
is proposed with the underlying technology of blockchain, which is properly to the crowdsourcing service
scenarios. Firstly, this PoT consensus selects nodes with high credibility using subjective logic reputation
algorithm. Only selected nodes have the chance to generate blocks, participate in verification, and claim
crowdsourcing tasks. Secondly, the choice scheme of generate-block nodes is further optimized through the
unpredictability of timestamp and digital signature.Moreover, an incentivemechanism based on game theory
is designed in this consensus. With this mechanism, candidate nodes prefer to give honest verification results
rather than engage in collusion with malicious nodes. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness, feasibility and scalability of the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of the global sharing economy, crowd-
sourcing has become a very active Internet service, and has
been widely used in various fields of Internet economy.
However, all crowdsourcing platforms are facing with a
critical problem to be solved: how to ensure that every
participant can strictly abide by crowdsourcing agreements in
the trading process? There is no trusted third party to monitor
whether providers and consumers meet their engagements
or not during the execution of the crowdsourcing contract.
In the event of a dispute, it is very hard to arbitrate and
investigate for responsibility according to law. This will

seriously hinder the healthy and sustainable development of
crowdsourcing services.
Because there is no credible centralized regulator, it’s nec-
essary to establish a decentralized accountability mechanism
to ensure healthy operation of crowdsourcing services. This
kind of mechanism depends on the transparency of contract
execution, consistency of work logs, traceability of service
process, etc. Blockchain technology happens to have these
characteristics, providing an important solution to such prob-
lems. Nevertheless, the integration of blockchain technology
into crowdsourcing service systems is a major challenge,
the biggest obstacle of which is that existing consensus algo-
rithms are hardly applied to crowdsourcing service scenarios.
At present, PoW, PoS and DPoS are the most widely
used public blockchain consensus algorithms. PoW is dif-
ficult to apply in large-scale online service systems owing

to large consensus latency, low throughput and high energy
consumption. Although PoS [1] has the characteristic of low
consensus latency and high throughput, it has the tendency
of centralization and the fairness becomes weaker. If used in
crowdsourcing service scenarios, the rights and interests of
newly admitted nodes may be compromised compared with
older users. DPoS [2] is an optimized and ugraded version
of PoS, which further shortens the delay, improves consensus
efficiency, and compensates for the lack of fairness through
democratic voting. But DPoS still has a certain degree of
centralization, so there are potential security risks. DPoS,
similar to a joint-stock company, cannot prevent collusion
between main shareholders if used in crowdsourcing scenar-
ios. Reference [3] presents a ‘‘Proof-of-Trust’’ (PoT) consen-
sus protocol which integrates a trust component and incentive
measures to address the unfaithful behaviors that often occur
in crowdsourcing services. The PoT protocol avoids the low
throughput and high energy consumption. However, in the
consensus process of PoT protocol, the only leader selected
by Raft algorithmmay be unreliable. This is because Raft has
high efficiency but poor safety. In addition, for each validator
candidate, the followers check their own trust database to
select validation nodes in PoT, but the specific selection
basis is not given in the protocol. Finally, if the reward and
punishment mechanism of PoT is applied to the actual scene,
nodes still have a great probability to implement malicious
behaviors.
As stated above, blockchain consensus algorithms suitable
for crowdsourcing service systems should be designed to
effectively solve the problem of mutual trust among partic-
ipating members. Because even with the distributed account-
ability infrastructure, the procedure of accountability after the
event is always cumbersome. At present, most of the current
research on reputation algorithms focuses on the improve-
ment of traditional reputation algorithms. Since Resnick et al.
proposed credibility [4], its researches and applications have
received great attention of researchers. Minhas et al. present
a reputation model based on multiple factors to detect mali-
cious nodes, which combines roles, experience, priorities,
and majority-based trusts for real-time decision making [5].
Gurung et al. put forward a trust model that directly evaluates
message credibility based on content similarity, content con-
flict, routing similarity and other factors [6]. He et al. used
a watchdog to monitor the behavior of neighbors. If an erro-
neous behavior is detected, the user broadcasts the neighbor’s
uncooperative reputation to other users in the network [7].
Although there are many related achievements of reputation
algorithms, very few of them are applicable to crowdsourcing.
This paper combines the crowdsourcing with blockchain
consensus process, designs a reputation algorithm appropri-
atefor the crowdsourcing and presents an improved Proof-of-
Trust consensus scheme. Its main contributions are summa-
rized as follows:
1. The improved PoT consensus uses subjective logic
algorithm to optimize the choice of consensus nodes, and
utilize timestamps and digital signatures to increase the
FIGURE 1. Crowdsourcing business model.
unpredictability of generate blocks nodes. Improved algo-
rithm can automatically finish reputation evaluation of
crowdsourcing participating members. The division standard
of reputation must be complied with by all members, thus
greatly reducing the probability of malicious members par-
ticipating in the crowdsourcing.
2. The improved PoT consensus algorithm can ensure
participating members have equal opportunities to take part
in crowdsourcing activities. Due to variability of reputation
values, the consensus nodes will not be a few fixed members.
So, the fairness of the improved algorithm is significantly
better than the existing PoT protocol.
3. We propose an incentive mechanism based on game
theory, and ensure that honesty is the best strategy for each
node by setting appropriate prices. This method is able to
encourage the verification nodes to proactively check and
provide a trusted verification results, to furthest prevent col-
lusion between nodes with malicious nodes.
The rest of this article is structured as follows.
Section 2 details the design of the system model and consen-
sus scheme. Section 3 describes reputation algorithm model
and design process. Section 4 introduces the selection of
generate block nodes. Section 5 assesses security based on
the game model. Section 6 analyzes fairness, effectiveness
and safety of consensus protocol, and discusses simulation
and test result. Finally, we summarize the main work of this
paper and point out future research directions.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND CONSENSUS SCHEME
A. CROWDSOURCING SYSTEM
The crowdsourcing system consists of the initiator of the
system task (the requester), the executor of the system task
(the worker), and a crowdsourcing platform. In the initial
state, the reputation value of all crowdsourcing nodes are
set to 0.7. This value is obtained through simulate and cal-
culate under different cases. We will explaine it in detail
in section IV. After the system operating for some time,
the worker has several interactions with the requester. Then,
the requester i issues a task, the system stipulats that each
bidders can participate in only one bidding activity in a period
of time. Combined with the recommended opinions of other
requesters for worker x, the comprehensive reputation value

FIGURE 2. The crowdsourcing process of a bidding event.
of the requester i to the worker x is obtained. If requester i
has interacted with worker x, the reputation value calculated
by the local opinion algorithm is used as the local opinion
of i to x at this time. When the comprehensive opinion is
calculated, the system stores it in the new block and serves as
the local opinion of the next round of i to x. After calculating
the reputation value of all the crowdsourcers who want to
participate in the bidding, the system selects the top K high
reputation value nodes, including one generate block node,m
bidding nodes and n verification nodes. The generate block
node is selected using a random selection algorithm [18].
In each round of bidding, some nodes will receive corre-
sponding rewards and the reputation value will increase.They
are either the activists in the bidder selection process or the
selected bidder itself. The nodes with malicious behaviors
will be punished. The system model is shown in figure 2.
B. CONSENSUS SCHEME
The crowdsourcing system is deployed in the consortium
blockchain. First, the requester initiates a crowdsourcing task,
the workers who want to join the crowdsourcing have to
go through a rigorous identity process. After becoming a
miner candidate, the workers need to pay a deposit to their
blockchain account. Second, system automatically calculates
the worker reputation value by reputation algorithm, and then
evaluates the credibility of workers. The worker use the repu-
tation value to compete for miners. The higher the reputation
value of the miner is, the more likely it become the generate
block node. Due to using random selection algorithm, it is
almost impossible to predict which one will be the generate
block node. To some extent, it solves the problem that the
bidding node and the generate block node collude to obtain
the illegitimate interest. Third, the remaining miners with
higher reputation value become the verification nodes. The
incentivemechanism based on game theory encourages nodes
to actively participate in verification,provide credible verifi-
cation results and prevent collusion with other nodes. Aminer
who becomes a generate block node or a verification node
will have the opportunity to get rewards, and the reputation
value of the miner will be stored in the new block. Next,
the new block will be uploaded to the blockchain system.
The data stored in the blockchain has the characteristics of
transparency, so each requester can share and download.
1) SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
All entities participating in the crowdsourcing system should
be authenticated by the trust institution before they become
legal entities. Each legal entity has its own public key, private
key, encryption and decryption certificate [8]. A candidate
who wants to join a miner should provide the information
about his identity first. Participants are eligible to join the
miner candidates only after they have been verified by the
trust institution.
2) JOIN THE MINER CANDIDATES
After becoming a miner candidate, each miner provides a
deposit to the account. If the miner candidate has malicious
behaviors, the deposit will be deducted from the account.
For example, the miner can not generate a block within the
specified time, the deposit will be deducted by the blockchain
system [9]–[11].
3) REPUTATION VALUE CALCULATION
The reputation of the miner candidates is based on the his-
torical interactions of the miners themselves and the recom-
mended opinions of other stakeholders. Section IV of this
paper introduce the reputation calculation method based on
the subjective logic model. Comprehensive opinions for each
miner candidate are formed based on a number of different
weights, and new reputation value can be downloaded from
the blockchain.
4) MINERS SELECTION
After calculating the reputation value of theminer candidates,
the miner is divided into four trusted states according to
the reputation as follows: trustworthy, normal, abnormal and
fault. It is helpful for the system to divide different node roles,
and then identify normal nodes and malicious nodes. Because
of the unpredictability of the time stamp and signature we
used, the generation of the block node is random, and then
malicious behaviors of nodes are reduced. The specific cal-
culation process is in section V of this paper.The process of
miner selection is shown in figure 3.
VOLUME 8, 2020 102179
X. Zhu et al.: Improved PoT Consensus Algorithm for Credible Crowdsourcing Blockchain Services
FIGURE 3. Miner selection process.
5) CONSENSUS PROCESS
An unverified block is generated by the generate block node,
and the block is broadcast to the verification nodes, and the
block is verified by the verification nodes. If the transaction is
valid, it is written to the local transaction pool and forwarded
to other consensus nodes, and if the transaction is invalid,
it will be discarded directly.
In order to ensure mutual check, the verification nodes ver-
ify the local data blocks, then signs the verification results and
broadcasts them in a distributed manner. Each verification
node compares its verification results with the other miners’,
and sends the comparison results to the miners who gener-
ate the blocks. The feedbacks include the miner’s results,
the comparison results, the signature, and a record of the
other miners’ verification results. The generate block node
analyzes the response information. If more than two-thirds of
the miners agree to the block, the generate block node will
send the record and the corresponding signature to all miners
for storage [12], [13].
When the authenticated block is added to the blockchain,
the miners that generate the block and participate in verifi-
cations will receive the transaction fee based on their contri-
butions. New reputation values are stored in the blockchain.
The consensus process is shown in figure 4. In a blockchain
system, the more verification nodes, the more secure the
consensus scheme [13]. Therefore, in order to obtain the
correct verification results, there must be a reasonable
incentive mechanism to encourage more nodes to partici-
pate in the verification. The specific analysis process is in
section VI.
6) REPUTATION UPDATE
After the end of a round of consensus, the new reputation
value of the worker j will be stored in the blockchain, which
becomes the local reputation value of the requester i to the
worker j for next time, and can be viewed and verified by
other nodes. The reputation value update process is shown
in figure 5.
FIGURE 4. System model.
FIGURE 5. Reputation update process.
III. REPUTATION ALGORITHM MODEL
AND DESIGN PROCESS
Subjective logic is used to assess the credibility of a transac-
tion. Subjective logic models are widely used in the security
field. The categories evaluated are respectively denoted by b,
d, u, and satisfy [19]:
b+ d + u = 1, b, d, u ∈ [0, 1]
where b represents the degree of trust of the node, d repre-
sents the degree of distrust of the node, and u represents the
uncertainty of the node.

The active interaction between the crowdsourcing partic-
ipating members means that workers generate the correct
block, the requester obtains the solution from the workers
and then honestly distributes the bonus. This indicates that
the requester trusts the services provided by workers. The
higher the reputation value, the more credibility the data
block generated by the miners. Since most of the requesters
are trustworthy, the opinions of the low-credit requesters have
only a small impact on the calculation of the reputation.
In addition, the reputation algorithm of this paper combines
the recommended opinions of other miners, it is an improve-
ment of the traditional reputation algorithm, as shown
in figure 6.
FIGURE 6. Reputation combination process.
A. LOCAL OPINION
In the interaction between the requester and the worker,
the opinion of the requester i to the worker j is called local
opinion, its calculation process is as follows:
ωi→j := {bi→j, di→j, ui→j}
where bi→j, di→j, ui→j represent trust, distrust and uncer-
tainty, respectively. And bi→j, di→j, ui→j ∈ [0, 1].
bi→j + di→j + ui→j = 1
According to the subjective logic model [19]:
bi→j = (1− ui→j)
mi
mi + ni
,
di→j = (1− ui→j)
ni
mi + ni
,
ui→j = 1− qi→j.
where mi is the number of correct transactions, ni is the
number of erroneous transactions, qi is the quality of the
connection between the requester and the worker, which is
related to the successful transfer rate of the packet. The trust
value of the requester i to the worker j is represented by Bi→j
[15], [19],
Bi→j = bi→j + εui→j
where 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1 represents the weight of uncertainty [14].
B. MULTI-WEIGHTED RECOMMENDATION
The subjective logic model is also related to other weights.
This paper proposes the following related weights.
1) INTERACTION TIMELINESS
The trust of the requester to the worker changes over time.
It is impossible to ensure that the worker is always reliable.
The reliability of the worker is related to the interaction with
the requester in the past, but the recent interaction with the
worker should occupy a larger proportion. Judging the recent
and past time points t1 can be set, for example, two days. ϕ
represents the weight of the recent interactions, ψ represents
the weight of the past interactions, and [15]
ϕ + ψ = 1, ϕ > ψ.
2) EFFECT OF SELFISH TRANSACTIONS
Proper trading behaviors will increase the reputation of the
worker, and selfish trading behaviors will reduce the reputa-
tion of theworker. Therefore, in order to ensure proper trading
behaviors better, the weight of selfish behaviors should be
set even larger. µ denotes the weight of the honest trad-
ing behaviors, ν denotes the weight of the selfish trading
behaviors, and [15]
µ+ ν = 1, µ < ν
Combined with the timeliness of interaction and the impact
of selfish transactions, a new frequency of interaction is
formed [15]: {
mi = ϕµmi1 + ψµm
i
2,
ni = ϕνni1 + ψνn
i
2.
when the current time belongs to the recent time, i.e. t > t1,
the number of honest transactions and selfish transactions
respectively are mi1 and ni1. When the current time does
not belong to the recent time, i.e. t ≤ t1, the number of
honest transactions and selfish transactions respectively are
mi2 and n
i
2.
3) INTERACTION FREQUENCY
The interaction frequency represents how much prior aware-
ness of the requester to the worker. The higher the interaction
frequency, the more the requester has prior knowledge about
the worker. So the requester’s viewpoint is more credible. The
calculation of the interaction frequency is as follows [15]:
Fi→j =
Numi→j
Ni
Numi→j represents the number of interactions between the
requester i and the worker j in time T, which is [15]:
Numi→j = mi + ni
Ni =
1
|E|
∑
e∈E
Numi→e
VOLUME 8, 2020 102181

E represents the set of all workers that interacted with the
requester i during time T.
Fi→j =
Numi→j

µ(ϕmi1 + ψm
i
2)+ ν(ϕn

|E|
∑
e∈E Numi→e
In summary, the weight of local reputation is [15]:
τi→j = liFi→j
0 ≤ li ≤ 1 is the weight of interaction frequency which is
predefined.
C. RECOMMENDED OPINIONS
The recommended opinions come from the opinions of other
requesters who have interacted with the worker j. The opin-
ions of different recommenders are weighted by different
weights, and this form a comment value, which is [15]:
brcx→j =
1∑
x∈X τx→j

urcx→j =

x∈X τx→j
∑
x∈X
τx→jux→j.
Among them, x ∈ X represents other requester that inter-
acts with worker j.
D. COMBINE LOCAL OPINIONS WITH RECOMMENDED
OPINIONS
The ultimate credibility of the requester i to the worker j is
calculated by combining local opinions with recommended
opinions [15], [19]:
bfx→j =

The final reputation value of the requester i to the worker j
is expressed as Bi→j [19]:
Bfi→j = bfi→j + εu

i→j
IV. THE SELECTION OF THE GENERATE BLOCK NODES
After calculating the reputation value of the requester i to
the worker j, the generate block node should be selected
according to the reputation value of each worker. The higher
the reputation value, the higher probability of the worker
be selected as the generate block node. In order to reduce
the predictability of the generate block node, we propose
the following algorithm to improve the randomness of the
selection of the generate block node, while ensuring that the
selected node has higher credibility.
TABLE 1. Reputation value reference.
A. TRUSTWORTHY STATE OF THE REPUTATION MODEL
The calculation result Bfi→j is divided into four cases, and the
following Bfi→j is abbreviated as B:
• trustworthy: B ∈ [0.85, 1], at this time, the trusted state
st is set to 1.
• normal: B ∈ [0.7, 0.85], at this time, the trusted state st
is set to 2.
• abnormal: B ∈ [0.5, 0.7], at this time, the trusted state
st is set to 3.
• fault: B < 0.5, at this time, the trusted state st is set
to 4.
The conversion relationship between node states is shown
in figure 7, where 0.85 and 0.7 respectively are two critical
values of the trust state, as shown in the table 1, and NoI
indicates the number of interactions.
In order to ensure the security of the system, the system
requires that the reputation values of the nodes cannot be
lower than a certain threshold. Therefore, we calculated the
following sets of data as a reference, the node is set to
have only once malicious behavior. For example, in 10 times
interactions, the node reputation value is 0.729 in the case
the ratio of positive to negative recommended opinions is 2:1,
and the node reputation value is 0.835 in the case the ratio of
positive to negative recommended opinions is 1:0. From the
calculation results and the actual situation we can see when
the reputation value exceeds 0.85, this node is eligible for
generating blocks. When the reputation value exceeds 0.7,
this node can qualify for joining the system.
The four trust states of a node can be converted to each
other. When a normal node continues to generate a valid
block, or keep other good behaviors, its reputation value will
exceed 0.85, and the reputation state will be converted to a
trustworthy state. A trustworthy node has a greater chance
to be selected as the generate block node. If a trustwor-
thy/normal node exhibits anomalous behaviors, for example,
it do not generate a new block for a period of time or its ver-
ification results are different from most nodes, its reputation
value will decrease and it will be convert to an abnormal node.
When the reputation value drops below 0.5, the reputation
status will be converted to a fault state, and this node needs
to be repaired or removed. A new consensus node will be
defaulted to a normal node when it joins the system.
B. RANDOMLY SELECT THE GENERATE BLOCK NODE
For the requester i, assuming its reputation status is sti, then
the probability that it is selected to be the generate block
102182 VOLUME 8, 2020

FIGURE 7. Conversion relationship of node trusted state.
node is [20]:
P(p = i) =
l
sti
So for any two workers a and b, if sta < stb, l
sta
> l
stb
, which
is P(p = a) > P(p = b). Assuming that NSumi represents
the number of worker with st = i, then l can be calculated as
follows [20]:
l =
1∑4
i=1
NSumi
i
In order to ensure unpredictability of the generate block
node, a random number R needs to be calculated by the
following formula:
R′ = TimeStamp⊕ Signature
R = StrToInt(SubStringEnd32(Hasht+1(R′)))modN
We XOR timestamp with signature of current block header
to get R′, and then perform t + 1 times hash operations on
R′. If no new blocks were generated in the previous round,
the node needs to count the times t that the system does
not produce blocks in continuous consensus rounds. Further,
the first 32 bits of Hasht+1(R′) is converted to an integer
value. We can get R by taking the modulo-N residue of this
result. N is the number of consensus nodes.
Since the time stamp and signature of the block header are
unpredictable, R is unpredictable. According to the probabil-
ity that node is selected to the generate block node, the node is
finally selected as the generate block node only when satisfy
the following formula, and we assume node i is the generate
block node [20]:
i−1∑
j=1
P(p = j) ≤
R
N
<
i−1∑
j=1
P(p = j)+ P(p = i)
This inequality can ensure that the selected generate block
node is unique.
V. SECURITY ASSESSMENT BASED ON GAME MODEL
In Section III and Section IV, the reputation algorithm based
on the subjective logic model is introduced. Nodes with
higher reputation values are more likely to be selected as
nodes for generating blocks and verifying. However, there
are still potential risk of verification node’s collusion in
crowdsourcing scenarios. In this section, we will design an
incentive mechanism based on game theory, which makes
the collusion cost of verification nodes is higher than the
profit, and encourages the node to actively participate in block
verification. We ensure the safety of incentive mechanism
in the face of malicious behaviors by setting appropriate
prices [16], [17].
A. DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME MODEL
• player: This game model has n + 1 players, V =
(v′, v1, v2, . . . , vn) stands for verification node cluster,
v′ is the verification node that may initiate collusion,
G = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) is the collusion node cluster of v′.
• strategy: Player v has two strategies: honest H and
maliciousM . Honest players will follow the agreement,
and malicious players will behave maliciously, such as
colluding with other nodes. We use S to represent the
player v’s strategy.
• benefit: The player’s benefit refers to the difference
between the player’s profit and the cost. Without col-
lusion attacks, the player’s benefit u is calculated as:
u =

ζ
2n−1
− θi, i ∈ G and S = M ,
ξ − θv, i = v and S = H ,
where θi is the cost of verification of V , such as the com-
munication cost, providing verification information, etc. θv is
the cost of the node v, for example, the transmission signature
confirmation, etc. ζ is remuneration that should be paid to the
collusion node when there has collusion between verification
nodes, ξ is remuneration that should be paid to the verifica-
tion nodes in the absence of collusion.
For a player, the best response strategy is to maximize the
expected benefit to its own, regardless of the strategy of the
other players. We should set up a mechanism to ensure that
honesty is the best strategy for each node. That is, if the col-
lusion cannot increase the benefit, the incentive mechanism
is effective.
B. SECURITY ASSESSMENT UNDER
COLLUSION ATTACKS
When ζ < ξ/k2 is satisfied, our incentive mechanism can be
effectively implemented, where k is the probability that two
arbitrary nodes encounter each other.
1) Considering the case with one conspired node
Suppose C = {V1, v} is a collusion group and E(uC ) is
the expected benefit of the collusion group. Our goal is
to confirm
E(uc) ≤ uv
VOLUME 8, 2020 102183
X. Zhu et al.: Improved PoT Consensus Algorithm for Credible Crowdsourcing Blockchain Services
The verification node v that initiates the collusion and
the verification node V1 participates in the collusion
will eventually obtain the proceeds from the requester
A. When A has encountered both v and V1 at the same
time (with a probability of k2), the expected sum of the
payment of C is:
Pc = q2(ζ + ξ )+ (1− q2)ξ = q2ζ + ξ
Considering the cost of communicating with V1 and the
cost of providing verification information:
uc = q2ζ + ξ − ξ − θv = q2ζ − θv
because of ζ < ξ/k2,
uc = q2ζ − θv < ξ − θv = uv
2) Considering the case with n conspired nodes
Suppose C = {V1,V2, . . . ,Vn, v} is a collusion group
and E(uC ) is the expected benefit of the collusion

E(uc) ≤ uv
When (A,V1), (V1,V2), . . . , (Vn, v) encounter each
other, the expected payment amount of collusion group
C is:
Pc = qn+1(

2n−1
+ ξ )+ (1− qn+1)ξ = qn+1
nζ
2n−1
+ξ
Considering the cost of the collusion group:
uc = qn+1
nζ
2n−1
+ ξ − nξ − θv
<

2n+1q2
− nξ + ξ − θv
= (

− 1)nξ + ξ − θv
< ξ − θv
= uv
Therefore, if ζ < ξ/k2 is satisfied, our incentive mechanism
can resist the collusion attack of the verification nodes and
improve the security of the system.
VI. PERFORMANCE
A. FAIRNESS
The Improved PoT consensus is based on the reputation
algorithm, which has an important characteristic of fairness.
Different from the DPoS consensus protocol, consensus
results are not depend on a few fixed nodes. The generate
block node plays an important role in the consensus process,
its choice directly affects own reputation value. And the
system can not only ensure the unpredictability of the node
selection, but also ensure that the generate block node is
selected from those with higher reputation values. And the
verification results are decided by all verification nodes. The
transaction is confirmed only when more than two-thirds of
verification nodes agree on it. The consensus process of the
improved PoT can guarantee neutrality. The discourse power
of node depends on its reputation value. And the choice of
the generate block node is random. Before the generate block
node is selected, no node can predict which node will be
responsible for generating block.
B. EFFECTIVENESS
In the reputation calculation phase, the reputation value is
related to the local opinion and the recommended opinions of
the node. The reputation algorithm can exclude the malicious
nodes and pick out the generate block node and the verifi-
cation nodes. In the verification phase, the generate block
node publishes the transaction information to the verification
nodes to check. And each verification node examines the the
authenticity of transactions separately and does not disclose
the verification result to other verification nodes. After the
verification phase, the generate block node accept the major-
ity verification result.
Even if there is collusion between most of the verification
nodes, the cost of the collusion verification group will be
higher than the gain of the acquisition under the constraint
of ζ < ξ/k2. This is not the choice of rational nodes in game
theory, so honestly verifying behavior is the best strategy for
nodes. The correct transaction will eventually be written to
the block.
C. SAFETY
Through the analysis of blockchain and crowdsourcing sce-
narios, this paper evaluates two typical security issues in
the system. One is the generate block node and verification
nodes collusion. The generate block node selects favourable
verification node to participate in the verification, and then
intervenes the consensus result. The other is the collusion
between the verification nodes. In the improved PoT con-
sensus, the selection of the verification node is related to its
reputation value. The reputation value will be stored in the
block and cannot be modified, any node can query it. Even if
a malicious node becomes a verification node, its verification
result will be invalid if the result is different from other nodes.
The verification result requires more than two-thirds of the
verification nodes to agree. Otherwise themalicious nodewill
be penalized by reducing the reputation value and deducting
the deposit. The incentive mechanism based on game theory
guarantees that the cost of colluding between verification
nodes will be much higher than the benefits it will receive.
D. SIMULATION RESULTS
1) THE EFFECT OF NODE BEHAVIORS ON NODE
REPUTATION VALUES
Figure 8 and figure 9 respectively show the change of the
reputation values of the normal node and the malicious node
with the number of interactions.
It can be seen from the figure that the reputation values
of normal nodes keep rising with the increase of the num-
ber of interactions, whether we adopt the subjective logical

reputation algorithm or the traditional reputation algorithm.
However, the initial reputation values of nodes are different,
which specified by the subjective logical reputation algorithm
and the traditional reputation algorithm. The former is 0.7,
the latter is 0.5. So we can see from the figure 8, in the
first five interactions, the reputation values of the subjective
logical reputation algorithm are higher than the traditional
reputation algorithm. But in the subsequent interactions,
the reputation values of the traditional reputation algorithm
are higher than the subjective logical reputation algorithm.
This is because the traditional reputation algorithm does not
consider the impact of the recommended opinions on the
node, which lead to high node’s reputation values.
Figure 9 compares the reputation values of a malicious
miner under three consensus algorithm, they are respectively
the subjective logical reputation consensus algorithm, the tra-
ditional reputation consensus algorithm and the traditional
DPoS consensus algorithm. As can be seen from the figure,
when the node has malicious behaviors after five normal
interactions, the reputation value of both the subjective logic
reputation algorithm and the traditional reputation algorithm
decline immediately, but the former dropped faster. Since
there is no reputation algorithm in DPoS, its reputation value
continues to rise, and infinitely close to 1. After one or two
interactions, it quickly drops below the trusted critical line
of 0.7. The traditional reputation algorithm does not take into
account the recommended opinions, that is, does not consider

the effect of interaction timeliness and selfish transactions,
so the reputation values of nodes cannot be quickly dropped
below the trusted critical line. The experimental parameter
settings are shown in table 1.
2) THE PROBABILITY THAT A MALICIOUS NODE
IS SELECTED AS THE PRIMARY NODES
Figure 10 and figuer 11 respectively show the probability
that a malicious node is selected as the generate block node
or a verification node with the number of malicious nodes

increase. It can be inferred from figure 10 that the subjective
logic consensus algorithm will not select a malicious node to
be the generate block node. However, under the traditional
reputation algorithm, a malicious node becomes the gener-
ate block node with high probability, and the probability is
increasing as the number of malicious nodes grows. There-
fore, the reputation consensus algorithm is more sensitive to
malicious nodes and can distinguish malicious nodes in time.
The reputation value of the generate block node must reach
0.85 or higher in this paper. If nodes’ reputation values can
reach 0.85 or higher, their local opinions and recommended
opinions are also very high, that is, they have almost no mali-
cious behaviors in the past interactions. So this type of node
is the most trustworthy and most unlikely to do malicious
behaviors. In the traditional reputation algorithm, because the
recommended opinions are not be considered, the reputation
value of the node is usually high, even higher than 0.85, this
will make such nodes easy to be generate block node. But
such nodes may still have malicious behaviors in the past, this
will bring a big risk to the system, and this trend is increasing
with the number of malicious nodes grows.
The situation in figure 11 is similar to figure 10, but with
one difference: a malicious node is selected as verification
node with higher probability, when using the traditional repu-
tation algorithm. This is because a verification node’s reputa-
tion value only need to be greater than 0.7. This is to improve
fairness of the system. The numerous calculations show that
if the node’s reputation value can reach 0.7 or above, they
are basically in a normal interaction state, although they have
once or twice malicious behaviors. This kind of node have
the opportunity to become a trustworthy node. Therefore,
such nodes cannot be completely excluded. Furthermore,
the incentive mechanism makes the node hard to engage in
malicious behaviors, otherwise there will be penalties such
as lowering the reputation value and deducting the deposit.
3) THE SUCCESS RATE OF HIDDEN MALICIOUS NODES
IMPLEMENTING MALICIOUS BEHAVIORS UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF ε
In the reputation algorithm, ε represents the impact of the
uncertainty of the node, especially hidden malicious nodes.
This parameter determines the reputation of the unknown
node. So this paper sets different ε to evaluate its impact
on the success rate of malicious behaviors. When a node’s
reputation value greater than 0.7 and this node successfully
participates in the block generation process, it will still imple-
ment malicious behaviors with a certain possibility. We test
the success rate of such hidden malicious nodes entering the
system, as shown in figure 12.
When ε = 0.05, the reputation algorithm based on sub-
jective logic reduces the success rate of malicious nodes to
near zero in about 35s. Based on the traditional reputation
algorithm, the success rate of malicious nodes perform mali-
cious behaviors is reduced to about zero in near 40s. When
ε = 0.055, the length of time that the success rate falls to
near zero is about 40s and 55s respectively. When ε = 0.06,
the required time are respectively 45s and 60s. It takes a while
for the success rate reaching near zero under both algorithms.
But the traditional reputation algorithms need a longer time.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Due to features of decentralization, traceability, tamper-
proof, etc., the blockchain technology offers a feasible
method to restricting malicious behaviors in crowdsourcing
systems. However, most existing blockchain consensus pro-
tocols are not suitable for large-scale online services. In this
paper, we combine the crowdsourcing scenario with the
blockchain, and propose a improved PoT consensus protocol
based on subjective logical reputation algorithm to provide
the distributed governance and accountability. The trust com-
ponent meets the practical requirements of crowdsourcing
scenarios. Together with the incentive measures based on
game theory, our consensus protocol can make the verifica-
tion process more credible. Through the simulation exper-
iment, we compare the proposed scheme to other existing
schemes. The results show that the improved PoT consensus
outperforms in validity, fairness and security.
In future research, we will further combine cryptography
to enhance the privacy and reliability of the system.
