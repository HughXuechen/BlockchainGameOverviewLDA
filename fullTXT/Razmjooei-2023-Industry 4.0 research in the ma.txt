Abstract
Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is currently a major topical concern in the literature on maritime 
industry. Maritime 4.0 is the area concerned with the integrated implementation of 
digital processes and technologies in the maritime industry. There is, however, a 
shortage of review studies that can reflect the research directions and various important 
issues in Maritime 4.0. The purpose of this study is to explore and categorize 
academic publications concerned with Maritime 4.0 to identify its current research 
status, main subject categories, emerging trends, current gaps, and future research 
directions. To provide a comprehensive review of the publications, the study used 
bibliometric analysis to conduct citation analysis (publication distribution, productive 
journals, and cross-country collaborations), cooccurrence of the subject categories, 
cocitation analysis, and keyword frequency analysis. In doing so, the study utilized 
the Web of Science (WoS) dataset and software packages for data analysis. Finally, the 
study proposed a research framework composed of five themes to link current research 
topics with future research trends in Maritime 4.0. The five themes observed were 
“digitalization technology,” “methodology and techniques,” “management,” “safety 
and security,” and “environmental issues.” The results revealed that, although scholars 
and practitioners focused on Maritime 4.0, this area remained underdeveloped. Many 
scopes under the five themes were left unexplored, such as emerging paradigms of 
Internet of things (IoT) and blockchain under the theme of “digitalization,” hybrid 
models (e.g., game theory and genetic algorithms) under the theme of “methodology 
and techniques,” and social responsibility under the theme of “environmental issues.”

1 Introduction
The notion of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) was first introduced in 2011. As a revolutionary 
process, I4.0 seeks to integrate various dimensions of information and communi-
cation technology (ICT) while promoting digitalization and information-driven 
industrial development (Mohd Salleh et  al. 2021). I4.0, also known as the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution, underscores the digitalization of manufacturing industries. 
The transformation of organizations to the digital form (digitalization), is commonly 
known as Industry 4.0 (Sony and Naik 2020). The two terms Industry 4.0 and digi-
talization are strongly interrelated because digitalization majorly contributes to the 
implementation of I4.0 (Jahn and Saxe 2017). As such, digitalization will be the 
main driver of innovation and transformation in the near future.
There is, however, no universal definition of I4.0. Some researchers have viewed 
it as a process increasing digitization and automation in the manufacturing industry. 
Some others, foregrounding an outcome-oriented perspective, suggest I4.0 repre-
sents a new stage or paradigm for industrial production. Other scholars have referred 
to I4.0 as an umbrella term for new technologies and technological concepts. The 
transition to I4.0 can crucially impact manufacturing firms’ ability to gain competi-
tive advantage and to seize new opportunities (Weking et al. 2020).
By adopting such a paradigm, smart manufacturing systems will work in an inter-
connected but decentralized environment that can adapt their production processes 
to market demand. The achievement of such a status, of course, demands relying 
on key enabling I4.0 technologies including the Internet of things (IoT), big data, 
artificial intelligence (AI), simulation, autonomous robots and systems, mobile aug-
mented reality, additive manufacturing, cloud computing, 3D printing, and cyberse-
curity (Rüßmann et al. 2015).
Since its inception in 2011, I4.0 has proven to be a topical concern in theory and 
practice. I4.0 practices have been employed in different industrial sectors including 
the maritime industry. The impacts of I4.0 are becoming more evident in the integral 
aspects of the maritime industry including shipping, shipbuilding, seaports, and termi-
nals. Maritime transport shapes the backbone of global trade and the global economy. 
More than 80% of the world’s merchandize trade is carried by sea (of course, in 2020, 
international maritime trade and global supply chains were strongly damaged by the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNCTAD 2021). The integrated implementa-
tion of digital processes and technologies in the maritime industry is known as Mari-
time 4.0 (Sullivan et al. 2020). Maritime 4.0 seeks to redesign supply chains in the 
maritime industry through digitalization and interlinking (Jahn and Saxe 2017). This 
process brings about significant advantages such as generating new value, fostering 
cooperation between port actors, reducing operational cost, and increasing total rev-
enue (Aiello et al. 2020; Di Vaio and Varriale 2020).
To further reinforce itself, the maritime industry has developed several I4.0 
initiatives on a global scale. For example, the Port of Hamburg has launched an 
initiative to implement smart seaport logistics using cloud-based tools (Mohd 
Salleh et  al. 2021). Meanwhile, Qingdao, Shanghai, Rotterdam, and Singapore 
have introduced autonomous shipping (Jeevan et al. 2021). Existing reports have

also mentioned the implementation of blockchain initiatives at the Port of Long 
Beach, the Port of Rotterdam, and some Indonesian ports (Munim et  al. 2021). 
Such ports as Hamburg and Rotterdam have been investing in Industry 4.0, iden-
tifying themselves as smart ports (Di Vaio and Varriale 2019). Currently, the 
term “Port 4.0” is a trending topic in the industry (De la Peña Zarzuelo et  al. 
2020). Port 4.0 generally describes a digital port that functions as a hub for physi-
cal and informational flows in global supply chains, interconnecting all the actors 
involved (Jahn and Saxe 2017).
However, despite the importance of I4.0 and its topical status in Maritime 4.0, 
there is a shortage of studies addressing the integration of I4.0 in the maritime 
industry. In fact, research on this area is still going through its developmental stages, 
and for this reason, there are evident gaps in the literature on this topic (Fruth and 
Teuteberg 2017; Sanchez-Gonzalez et  al. 2019; Munim et  al. 2020). Only a few 
review studies have explored the literature on I4.0 in the maritime industry. The 
available literature reviews have either concentrated on specific I4.0 technologies (De 
la Peña Zarzuelo et al. 2020; Munim et al. 2020, 2021) or addressed the integration 
of I4.0 and sustainability issues (Jeevan et  al. 2021; Del Giudice et  al. 2022). For 
instance, Munim et al. (2020) focused on research on big data and AI in the maritime 
industry, identifying the research clusters through a bibliographic coupling analysis. 
Del Giudice et  al. (2022) also investigated the application of digitalization in the 
construction of sustainable business models.
From a methodological viewpoint, a content analysis of publications in this field 
revealed that only three review studies (Del Giudice et al. 2022; Jeevan et al. 2021; 
Munim et al. 2020) applied bibliometric analysis. In their review studies, Fruth and 
Teuteberg (2017) and Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2019) drew on systematic literature 
review to determine the current status of digitalization in maritime transport. Munim 
et al. (2020), of course, observed that the literature search procedure that Sanchez-
Gonzalez et  al. (2019) employed seemed subjective and was not easily replicable. 
Generally speaking, the existing reviews addressed a limited scope and were not 
methodologically powerful. More robust efforts are needed to explore I4.0 in 
maritime studies and to provide a broader picture of the key themes, emerging trends, 
and future directions in this field.
The purpose of this study is to explore the literature on I4.0 in maritime studies. 
The study seeks to identify current research trends in this field through bibliometric 
analysis. The main research directions in the field are also identified based on the 
bibliometric results and a content analysis of the most important cited papers. 
Contrary to previous research, the present investigation includes publications that have 
dealt with all I4.0 technologies in the maritime industry. The present study traces the 
evolution of different themes in this area of research, trying to provide more reliable 
results by considering various bibliometric items. In response to the shortcomings 
in the literature, this study provides four main contributions: (a) it documents the 
development of research on Maritime 4.0 over the years; (b) it provides a detailed 
overview of the existing literature, introducing the most influential journals, articles, 
and authors, along with collaboration networks of countries exploring this field; (c) 
through the document cocitation analysis, the study identifies the founders, seminal 
works, clusters of documents, and key concepts in the realm of Maritime 4.0; and (d)

using keyword frequency analysis, the study investigates the emerging research topics 
in terms of five key themes it identifies.
The study is guided by four research questions: How has research on I4.0 in the 
maritime industry evolved over time? What are the overall publication trends and 
academic collaborations in research on Maritime 4.0, what are the countries and 
journals exploring Maritime 4.0, and who are the authors concerned with this area 
of studies? And, what are the future research directions addressing Maritime 4.0? 
Finally, based on the results of the bibliometric analysis and a content analysis of 
27 cited papers, the study highlights the gaps and possible future research direc-
tions. It also proposes a research framework to link the current research topics with 
the future research directions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section  2 details the methodological approach. Section  3 presents the results and 
discussion, and Section 4 reports the concluding remarks.
2  Research method
Bibliometric analysis is a research methodology that enables researchers to unpack 
the evolutionary aspects of a specific field, shedding light on the emerging areas 
in the field in question. It can identify collaboration patterns, research clusters, and 
knowledge gaps, uncovering the intellectual structure of a specific domain and its 
emerging trends (Donthu et al. 2021).
This study used bibliometric analysis to investigate the current status, key themes, 
and gaps in research on Maritime 4.0 and to predict future research directions in 
this field. A bibliometric analysis would effectively help to explore a fragmented 
research scope such as Maritime 4.0. To answer the research questions specified, the 
study pursued the following four-step process (see Fig. 1).
Step 1: Identify the search strings. To find the search strings, the majority of the 
existing literature review studies concerned with the maritime industry and I4.0 
were inspected and analyzed.
In doing so, the initial keywords were identified from other publications (Lau et al. 
2017; Fiskin and Cerit 2020; Del Giudice et  al. 2022). The keyword “port number” 
was excluded from the list as it could represent such disciplines as electronics and 
telecommunications, instead of maritime studies (Munim et al. 2020). Keywords related 
to I4.0 were also included as a research criterion. Various keywords appeared in the 
literature on I4.0, which was first publicly introduced in Germany in 2011 as “Industrie 
4.0” to refer digitalization in industry (Thoben et al. 2017). This study included other 
commonly related terms such as “digitalization,” “smart manufacturing,” “smart 
factory,” and “smart port.” These concepts have all stemmed from I4.0.
The idea of the smart port also emphasizes the automation of port operations and 
equipment, as well as the interconnection of the entire port logistics chain (Douaioui 
et al. 2018). A smart port is a fully automated port where all devices are connected 
via an IoT platform. The main infrastructural components of a smart port are sensors 
and actuators, wireless devices, and data centers (Yang et al. 2018).

Finally, the analysis process included the keywords related to I4.0 technical 
enablers (IoT, cyber-physical systems, etc.). Table 1 shows the list of the finalized 
queries representing Maritime 4.0.
Step 2: Search the WoS database. The search strings collected were then searched 
on the WoS database. In the case of document cocitation analysis, the search 
procedure involved records published between 2011 and December 2021. In the 
case of keyword frequency analysis, however, records published between 2001 and 
2022 were searched. To obtain a strongly representative set of search strings, the 
initial keywords were inspected and updated through an iterative process, based on 
the contents of the publications found.
The WoS database was selected for the search procedure because it made it possible 
to search current and retrospective multidisciplinary publications (Rey-Martí et  al. 
2016; Song et  al. 2019). Because I4.0 was first introduced as a concept in 2011, 
the year 2011 was set as the starting point. The initial search yielded 1586 records. 
The topic field on the WoS database was searched using the keywords, and only 
publications written in English were included. To address new discussions concerned 
with Maritime 4.0, all types of documents including journal articles, book chapters, 
and conference proceedings were included in the analysis process. Accordingly, the 
refined search procedure found 1563 records.
Some irrelevant subject categories in maritime studies were also omitted, such 
as fisheries and biology. Applying the Refine Results option of the WoS database 
showed a total of 938 relevant publications for analysis. Next, the search results were

exported and stored for subsequent analysis in CiteSpace, HistCite, and VOSviewer 
software packages. CiteSpace and HistCite software programs required the search 
results to be in plain text format. However, to prepare the data format for VOSviewer, 
the WoS records were exported into a tab-delimited file.
Step 3: Conduct bibliometric and network analyses. In this step, citation analysis 
was conducted in CiteSpace (5.8.R3) and HistCite, to detect publication trends, 
the key journals, and the most influential countries. Meanwhile, the analysis 
investigated the cooccurrence of the subject categories and computed the 
cocitation analysis of the publications addressing Maritime 4.0. VOSviewer was 
used to calculate the frequency of the keywords and thus revealed the topical 
concerns explored in the literature on Maritime 4.0.

Step 4: Link current topics to future ones. A research framework is proposed to 
link the current research topics to future research directions based on the bib-
liometric analysis results and the content analysis of the top 27 most cited docu-
ments.
The data used for analysis were obtained from the following WoS indices: “Sci-
ence Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)” (1980-Dec 2021), “Social Sci-
ences Citation Index (SSCI)” (1980-Dec 2021), “Arts & Humanities Citation Index 
(A&HCI)” (1975-Dec 2021), “Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science 
(CPCI-S)” (1990-Dec 2021), “Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Sci-
ence & Humanities (CPCI-SSH)” (1980-Dec 2021), “Book Citation Index– Science 
(BKCI-S)” (2005-Dec 2021), “Book Citation Index–Social Sciences & Humanities 
(BKCI-SSH)” (2005-Dec 2021), and “Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)” 
(2015-Dec 2021). The bibliometric analysis search was conducted on December 14, 
2021.
3  Results and discussion
3.1  Descriptive analysis
The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on I4.0 in maritime stud-
ies. The study sought to identify current research trends, existing gaps, and main 
research directions based on the bibliometric results and a content analysis of the 
most important cited articles. A descriptive analysis of the trend of the publications 
both in terms of their frequency measures and types, most productive journals, the 
geography-based distribution of publications, and their subject categories could 
provide a broad picture of the current and future research directions, as explained 
below.
3.1.1  Trends of the publications
This section explores the trends of publications in terms of their frequency and 
types between 2011 and 2021. This analysis reveals the developmental trends and 
the current status of publications addressing Maritime 4.0. Figure 2 illustrates the 
distribution of the total publications (TP) from 2011 to December 2021. An initial 
search including I4.0 and maritime studies showed a total of 1428 publications writ-
ten in English. The total publications per year rose from 37 in 2011 to 362 in 2021. 
The publications found appeared in eight different document types: articles (1284), 
reviews (49), early access (48), proceeding papers (34), editorial material (9), data 
papers (3), and retracted publication (1). Among all these types of documents, arti-
cles (90%), followed by reviews (0.03%), constituted the main body of the literature 
on the topic under investigation.
Figure  2 clarifies that research on I4.0 in maritime studies is a very recent 
phenomenon. The 11-year period can be further divided into two subperiods: (a) 
from 2011 to 2016, few publications addressed this topic; and (b) from 2016 to 
 D. Razmjooei et al.
1 3
2021, the number of publications showed a significantly increasing trend. Nota-
bly, the TP measure in 2021 (362) was about ten times greater than that in 2011 
(37). Given this rising trend, one can expect to see a growing number of studies 
concerned with I4.0 in maritime studies in the next few years.
3.1.2  Most productive journals
This section distinguished the productive journals exploring Maritime 4.0 by 
computing the number of publications and the frequency of citations. This anal-
ysis would help researchers to easily trace journals that are most appropriate 
for publishing research on maritime 4.0. HistCite was used to analyze the most 
impactful journals. The data for this analysis was extracted from the WoS data-
base. The HistCite-generated analysis results indicated that 413 journals pub-
lished 1387 articles that addressed I4.0 in maritime studies. Most of them were 
prominent journals in the fields of ocean engineering, sustainability, marine 
science and engineering, transportation, and maritime policy and management. 
Table 2 provides an overview of the top 20 journals that published documents 
in relation to the topic under investigation. The top 20 most influential journals 
published 398 articles from 2011 to 2021, which roughly accounted for 32.7% of 
the TP. As Table 2 shows, the top 3 journals with the highest number of publica-
tions in the list were The Journal of Coastal Research, Ocean Engineering, and 
Sustainability, respectively.
The Journal of Coastal Research (with the highest TP measure: 77), Ocean 
Engineering (with the highest TGCS: 428), IEEE Internet of Things Journal 
(with the highest TLCS: 41 and the highest IF score: 12.3), and Maritime Policy 
and Management (with the highest TLCR measure: 40) were the four most pro-
ductive journals that addressed I4.0 in maritime studies.

3.1.3  Geographical distribution of the publications
By investigating the countries’ collaboration network, it would be possible to 
identify international collaborations, potential collaborators, and the key countries 
that produced a large number of publications and majorly influenced research on 
Maritime 4.0. To evaluate the contribution of each country to the development 
of Maritime 4.0, a geographical distribution network of publications was drawn 
in CiteSpace. Figure  3 illustrates the collaboration network map of the countries. 
The network involves 94 nodes and 42 links generated from 2011 to 2021 based on 
1-year slices. Each node represents a country or region; larger nodes would include 
a greater number of publications from the countries involved. A node with a high 
betweenness centrality (BC) measure (BC ≥ 0.1) was described as a turning point 
(Chen 2004) and was marked with a pink circle. Such countries collaborated more 
closely with the international nodes. The colors of the links between the nodes 
represent the first time a collaboration was established between two countries.
According to the information in Fig.  3, China (PRC), the USA, South Korea, 
England, Italy, and Spain, which exhibited larger node sizes, had a large number of 
publications concerned with I4.0 in the maritime industry. China (PRC), the USA, 
and Italy, which had purple inner circles, were the first countries engaged in this 
line of research back in 2011. The BC indicator helped to measure the importance 
of each node in the collaboration network. In the light of the BC measure, countries 
such as France, Egypt, Malaysia, and Finland extensively collaborated with most 
countries in this research field. In contrast, countries with a low BC measure would 
need to collaborate more with other countries or scientific institutions. Tables  3 
and 4 provide more detailed information about the top 10 countries with the 
highest number of publications and about the BC measures from the cross-country 
collaboration network.

3.1.4  Distribution of the publications based on their subject categories
Analyzing the distribution of the publications based on their subject categories could 
uncover the most significant topical issues over time (Hamidi and Ramavandi 2020). 
To address the priority of research topics in the realm of Maritime 4.0, a cooccurrence 
analysis of the subject categories was conducted in CiteSpace (see Fig. 4). The size of 
each node is proportional to the number of cooccurrences of the subject category. The 
line thickness represents the strength of the relationship between two categories. The

colors of the lines show the first cooccurrence of the nodes. The nodes marked with 
pink circles represent the turning points in the network. The literature on Maritime 4.0 
involved approximately 106 nodes (subject categories) and 51 links between 2011 and 
2021. As shown in Fig. 4, research on Maritime 4.0 encompassed several disciplinary 
subject areas from various disciplines including engineering, computer science, 
environmental sciences, engineering, marine, transportation, business, and economic. 
These subject categories were grouped into 9 subject category clusters in CiteSpace.
In the network, the most predominant subject category was engineering as the largest 
node with 600 publications. Computer Science with a frequency of 436 publications 
was the second subject category. Table 5 lists the top 10 subject categories ranked by 
the number of publications. These categories accounted for most of the publications 
addressing Maritime 4.0.
BC measured the interrelationships among the nodes and could also indicate the 
interdisciplinarity of the scientific journals (Leydesdorff and Liu 2007). It was found 
that the category of Engineering was not only the most contributing category, but 
also it showed the highest BC measure (0.36) in the cooccurrence network of the 
subject categories. Table 6 displays the BC measures and the turning points of the 
cooccurrence network of the subject categories. As Table 6 shows, such categories as 
Geography, Physical, Business and Economics, and Management were, respectively, 
the turning points of the network and were strongly connected with the other 
categories. These turning points linked the studies dealing with different topics and 
could significantly affect the development of research on Maritime 4.0 (Zhang et al.

literature on Maritime 4.0, which involved numerous disciplinary areas.
3.2  Cocitation network analysis
Cocitation analysis is an effective tool for mapping the intellectual structure of 
research areas, and it could be used to detect existing clusters of documents (White 
and Griffith 1981). Cocitation analysis has served as a standard measure of biblio-
metric analysis since the 1970s. It is defined as the frequency with which two docu-
ments are cited together (Small 1973). Moreover, cocitation provides a new method 
of exploring seminal works in a particular line of studies. Unlike bibliographic cou-
pling, which provides a forward-looking perspective, cocitation pursues a retrospec-
tive approach (Belussi et al. 2019). Therefore, analyzing how documents are cited 
together can help researchers and practitioners to understand important past contri-
butions in a scope of research (Trujillo and Long 2018).
Relying on cocitation analysis, this study created a network of document (ref-
erence) cocitations with 1114 nodes and 2219 links to identify key documents, 
research clusters, and the intellectual base. In the network, five main clusters were 
generated based on the log-likelihood ratio algorithm (LLR) in CiteSpace (see 
Fig. 5). A cluster represents a group of strongly connected articles in one specific 
research scope that has limited connections to articles in another research scope 
(Radicchi et al. 2004).
Modularity (Q) and the mean silhouette (S) are two important metrics that 
describe the overall structural properties of a network. The Q value falls between − 1 
Fig. 5  A five-cluster view of the document cocitation network based on 1-year slices
 D. Razmjooei et al.
1 3
and 1. Greater Q values indicate better clusters of nodes. A Q value falling between 
0.4 and 0.8 would denote a significant structure division in cases Q is relatively 
high. The S value of a cluster falls between –1 and 1 and measures the quality of a 
clustered configuration. Larger S scores would indicate a higher degree of homog-
enization of nodes in a cluster. A value of S greater than 0.7 generally suggests that 
the cluster involves a high rate of credibility (Chen et  al. 2014; Xu 2020). In this 
study, the cocitation network showed a Q value of 0.937, which indicated that the 
nodes were clearly defined within each cluster. The mean S score was 0.9284, which 
suggested a high degree of homogeneity of the nodes in the clusters. Table 7 more 
specifically reports the characteristics of these cocitation cluster. The data were 
extracted from CiteSpace based on the data collected from the WoS database.
Analyzing the important cited documents in each cluster offers a better 
understanding of the intellectual foundations and leading researchers in the research 
area under investigation. Table 8 lists the top 4 most significant cited documents in 
the five clusters.
As Fig. 5 and Table 7 show, the network was divided into five cocitation clusters. 
Below, the largest cluster (Cocitation Cluster # 0: Digitalization) is qualitatively 
analyzed. The largest cluster (#0), labeled “digitalization,” had 72 members, 
accounting for 39% of total nodes in the network. The cluster’s mean S value was 
0.856, which showed a high degree of homogeneity. The mean year of publications 
in this cluster was 2018. The item with the highest burst rank in this cluster was Yang 
et al. (2018) with a burst value of 4.31, followed by Heilig et al. (2017) with a burst 
value of 4.05. The first article investigated the requirements and challenges those 
ports needed to address to implement the IoT.
In the case of citation counts, the top 3 items were Heilig and Voß (2017), 
Sanchez-Gonzalez et  al. (2019), and Fruth and Teuteberg (2017), which showed 
citation counts of 120, 62, and 99, respectively. All these three cited publications 
(intellectual base articles) mainly focused on information systems (IS) and the 
digitalization of the maritime sector. Heilig and Voß (2017) offered a comprehensive 
overview of IS and information technologies (IT) applied in ports. The authors 
also extensively examined the functionality, standards, and the role of solutions 
regarding these two factors in port operations. Digitalization in Heilig and Voß’s 
article referred to the administration of IS and IT. Global navigation satellite systems, 
electronic data interchange, radio-frequency identification (RFID), optical character 
recognition systems, and real-time location systems were samples of the key enabling 
technologies that could improve port operations. Examples of IS in seaports that were 
surveyed by the authors were the national single window, port community systems, 
vessel traffic services, terminal operating systems, and automated yard systems. 
Heilig et al. (2017) also provided an overview of the development and most recent 
digital transformations in modern seaports.
Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2019) used a systematic literature review, trying to gain 
a clearer understanding of most recent developments in relation to digitalization 
in maritime transport. Digital technologies in their study were categorized into 
eight domains: autonomous vehicles and robotics, AI, big data, virtual reality and 
augmented/mixed reality, the IoT, cloud and edge computing, digital security, 
and 3D printing and additive engineering. The authors also emphasized the strong

relationship between digitalization and I4.0 (Sanchez-Gonzalez et  al. 2019). Fruth 
and Teuteberg (2017) carried out a systematic literature analysis to investigate the 
current state of digitization in maritime logistics (Fruth and Teuteberg 2017). One of 
the most cited studies in this cluster (Carlan et al. 2016) proposed a comprehensive 
framework to evaluate the costs and benefits of port community systems.
3.3  Keyword frequency analysis
Keywords represent key concepts addressed in a specific research area (Su and Lee 
2010). Keyword frequency analysis, then, can help to reveal the focus of studies in 
a particular line of research. This study conducted a keyword frequency analysis of 
three periods in VOSviewer, namely, 2001–2010, 2011–2016, and 2017–2022, to 
substantially depict the hotspots of studies concerned with Maritime 4.0.
The minimum number of occurrences of a keyword was set at 3. Meanwhile, 
the keywords were screened and general or irrelevant ones were excluded. Next, 
the total frequency (TF) of the keywords in each period was calculated. The total 
frequency measure was the sum of the frequency of abbreviated, singular, plural, 
and synonymous keywords (e.g., IoT and Internet of things, strategy and strategies, 
autonomous ship and autonomous shipping, ship, and marine vehicle).
After the frequency of the keywords was measured, the keywords were clustered 
into five research themes: “digitalization technology,” “methodology and techniques,” 
“management,” “safety and security,” and “environmental issues.” These clusters were 
identified in the light of the cocitation analysis results, content analysis, and an in-
depth discussion. More specifically, in constituting the themes, the study investigated 
previous research on the topic, conducted in-depth discussions, found the similarities 
between the keywords, and relied on experts’ judgments. Meanwhile, the clusters iden-
tified through the cocitation analysis (Fig. 5) further helped to group the keywords. 
As can be seen, the three clusters AI, blockchain, and autonomous ship represented 
aspects of digital technology associated with “digitalization technology” as the largest 
theme. As another cluster, supply chain management represented the keywords related 
to the “management” theme. Table 9 lists the frequently used keywords in research on 
Maritime 4.0 in three periods: 2001–2010, 2011–2016, and 2017–2022.
The current research topics and future research directions associated with each 
theme were identified in the light of cocitation analysis and keyword frequency

Industry 4.0 research in the maritime industry: a bibliometric…
analysis (as explained in more detail below). An in-depth literature review of the top 
27 most cited documents also helped to formulate the future research directions in 
this field.
3.3.1  Digitalization technologies
This theme involved keywords representing I4.0 technologies in each generation 
digital transformation that occurred in seaports. Heilig et al. (2017) analyzed three 
generations, namely, paperless procedures, automated procedures, and smart 
procedures. The first generation (1980s) mostly focused on establishing basic IT 
infrastructure and software applications to support some terminal activities, such 
as port community systems governed by electronic data interchange. The second 
generation (1990s–2000s) supported the automation of terminal operations by 
integrating terminal equipment and vehicles (e.g., automated guided vehicles and 
automated stacking cranes) and IT-regulated terminal infrastructure. The ongoing 
third generation of digital transformation (2010s-present) has concentrated on 
managing port operations and terminal infrastructure by adopting smart technologies 
(e.g., sensors and actuators). The current research topics and future research 
directions addressing I4.0 technologies in relation to these three generations are 
explained in more detail below.
As Table  9 shows, researchers are presently more concerned with the third 
generation (i.e., I4.0) and the second generation (i.e., automation) of digitalization 
technologies than the first generation. For instance, in the third period (2016–2022), 
researchers did not concentrate much on topics associated with the first digital 
generation (e.g., the structure of IT as in electronic data interchange) or IS (e.g., port 
community systems). The frequency of “automation” as a keyword, which was a 
representative of the second digital generation, revealed that researchers were still 
concerned with the technologies of this generation including automatic identification 
systems, RFID, and automated guided vehicles. I4.0 technologies were the emerging 
topics in research on Maritime 4.0. Among the topics, the keyword “IoT” showed 
the highest frequency (182). The frequent occurrences of such keywords as 
“IoT,” “artificial intelligence,” “big data,” “blockchain,” “cloud computing,” and 
“augmented reality” revealed that researchers remarkably focused on these I4.0 
technologies in maritime studies.
However, the application of I4.0 technologies in the maritime industry will 
need studies to further investigate some areas. For instance, although IoT and 
blockchain constituted the main research trends exploring maritime 4.0, there are 
emerging paradigms left unaddressed in the existing studies. The main research 
gaps in relation to IoT are the Internet of services (IoS), the Internet of content 
(IoC), the Internet of people (IoP), and the Internet of agents (IoA). Similarly, other 
generations of blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) were left unexplored in the 
existing studies.
Among other I4.0 technologies as shown in Table  9, “autonomous ship” and 
“cyber-physical system” showed a low frequency of 21. Meanwhile, no keywords 
were found in relation to “3D printing” in maritime studies. A content analysis of the 
publications addressing Maritime 4.0 also revealed that “3D printing technology” 
 D. Razmjooei et al.
1 3
was only mentioned in two studies (Chen 2017; Kostidi and Nikitakos 2018). There 
are, of course, other areas to be explored. Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2019) observed 
that cloud computing, 3D printing, and additive manufacturing in shipbuilding and 
seaports were the domains that required more research. In addition, they concluded 
that future research would have to explore the applications of big data in ship design 
and shipbuilding, the functions of virtual/augmented reality in seaports, and the uses 
of robotics in sea transport services. De la Peña Zarzuelo et al. (2020) pointed out 
that although IoT and sensing solutions were the leading topics in other emerging 
technologies, other domains of maritime studies were relatively underappreciated 
such as blockchain, 3D printing, augmented reality, big data, and AI.
3.3.2  Methodology and techniques
The research on Maritime 4.0 has drawn on different research methods that can serve 
various research goals. In this study, the research methods in the literature on Mari-
time 4.0 were divided into two categories: classical computing techniques and soft 
computing techniques. The former would use mathematical models and algorithms, 
whereas the latter would draw on AI technologies including neural networks, fuzzy 
logic, and evolutionary algorithm expert systems (Statheros et al. 2008). Comparing 
the frequency of the keywords over the periods under investigation demonstrated 
that “model” (183), “optimization” (93), “risk assessment” (33), and “mathematical 
model” (15) were, respectively, the emerging topics in relation to “methodology and 
techniques” in the literature on Maritime 4.0. Furthermore, “multicriteria decision-
making” and “case study” were also important topics.
In addition to classical techniques that relied on mathematical models, the fre-
quent occurrences of such phrases as “fuzzy logic” and “evolutionary algorithm” 
suggested that researchers also focused on soft-computing techniques. For instance, 
from the perspective of methodological applications, Statheros et  al. (2008) iden-
tified two autonomous ship navigation methods in the studies: (a) classical tech-
niques regulated by mathematical models and algorithms and (b) soft-computing 
techniques governed by AI. Furthermore, Kretschmann et  al. (2017) analyzed the 
economic benefits of unmanned autonomous ships, comparing them with a conven-
tional vessel.
Yet, further research should quantify the impact of I4.0 technologies on the mari-
time industry. For instance, research can measure the performance improvement of 
seaports’ business processes via IoT technologies (Ferretti and Schiavone 2016). 
Furthermore, Heilig et al. (2017) emphasized the application of the game theoretic 
framework, asserting that future studies should investigate the economic impact of 
digitalization on the maritime industry.
Zhang and Lam (2019) explained that future studies should employ causal mod-
els, such as structural equation modeling, to analyze the dynamics of technology 
adoption barriers. De la Peña Zarzuelo et  al. (2020) argued that future research 
should conduct a cross-referenced survey describing how I4.0 technologies are 
embedded in different port functions such as services to ship and merchandize ser-
vices. To enhance blockchain implementation, researchers can conduct case stud-
ies and pilot programs. Future research should also evaluate post-implementation 
1 3

success/failure factors of I4.0 technologies (Saberi et  al. 2019). Developing new 
fuzzy models and hybrid models (e.g., game theory and genetic algorithms) can also 
serve as interesting topics for future research.
3.3.3  Management
The theme of “management” included current research topics, gaps, and future 
research directions in the literature on Maritime 4.0, by focusing on managerial 
issues. The main concerns in this theme were systematic perspective, monitoring 
and performance measuring, efficiency and innovation, regulatory frameworks, 
business models, design, and related standards. According to Table  9, keywords 
such as “system,” “performance,” “supply chain,” “strategies,” “innovation,” “moni-
toring,” “quality,” and “efficiency” were the most frequent keywords related to the 
theme of “management.” This observation suggested that the adoption of I4.0 could 
become a requirement for value chain activities that maritime organizations under-
take. For instance, the frequency of “system” showed a rapid increase from 4 occur-
rences in the 2001–2010 period to 174 ones in the 2017–2022 period. This remark-
able increase indicated that the systematic approach to Maritime 4.0 could be the 
focus of future research. In the same vein, Saberi et al. (2019) recommended that 
further research should focus on system-related issues of blockchain technology that 
can limit its adoption (Saberi et al. 2019).
Furthermore, the increase in the frequency of “quality” showed that researchers 
focused on the impacts of adopting I4.0 on improving quality in the maritime indus-
try. The increase in the frequency of “efficiency” also revealed the importance of 
efficiency improvement as the main goals of I4.0, Port 4.0, and Maritime 4.0 (Jahn 
and Saxe 2017). In addition, “innovation” with a frequency of 37 was an emerging 
keyword, which signified the role of digitalization and I4.0 as the main drivers of 
innovation. Some scholars (e.g., Carlan et al. 2016) addressed digital innovation in 
the maritime industry.
Emerging keywords such as “regulation,” “business model,” “value creation,” 
and “standard” less frequently appeared in the literature on Maritime 4.0. Of course, 
these underexplored areas could inspire future research. Among these, however, 
regulatory uncertainty seems to be the greatest concern in the maritime industry. 
For instance, from a legal perceptive, a regulatory framework should formulate the 
applications of I4.0 technologies in the maritime industry. For example, Lehmacher 
and McWaters (2017) argued that regulatory governance (i.e., agreements, laws, and 
practices) may be the most challenging obstacle to the implementation of block-
chains. This issue can serve as an interesting future research topic. Fruth and Teu-
teberg (2017) recommended that I4.0 applications in the future should comply with 
stricter environmental requirements. Similarly, Heilig and Voß (2017) underscored 
the incorporation of legacy systems and enabling technologies. Investigations should 
also identify the drivers of and barriers to transparency and trust in the maritime 
industry (Munim et al. 2020).
Probing into business models, Chan (2015) argued that the impacts of AI and 
machine learning on business models could inspire future research (Chan 2015). In 
relation to digital standards, one can refer to the research of Schleyerbach and Mulder 
 D. Razmjooei et al.
1 3
(2021), who examined various digitalization and standardization achievements of the 
digital container shipping association as an industry-based standards organization deal-
ing with digital transformation. As far as standardization is concerned, developing con-
sistent technical standards for blockchain technology can contribute to future improve-
ments (Yang 2019). More studies should also explore the contributions and applications 
of knowledge, resources, and competences involved in processes of value creation while 
unfolding the dynamics of IoT-based business models (Metallo et al. 2018).
3.3.4  Security and safety
Although I4.0 brings about advantages, it also involves some security and safety 
risks that should be taken into consideration. The growing availability of data (such 
as data provided by automatic identification systems), the importance of mobility 
in logistics, and information exchange are some of the factors that highlight the 
urgency of higher levels of data security and data protection. As such, organiza-
tions must endeavor to prevent sensitive systems from being manipulated. Current 
research topics/gaps and future research directions of I4.0 technologies in the mari-
time industry are further explained below.
“Security” was the keyword with the highest frequency in the theme of “security 
and safety.” In the period under investigation (2001–2022), the frequency of key-
words such as “security” and “collision avoidance” showed an increase from 2017. 
As an emerging keyword, “cyber security” is concerned with issues of security and 
privacy in I4.0 implementation, which are currently potential concerns in the mari-
time industry. Some studies focused on the application of AI in improving security 
in shipping (Wen et  al. 2012), security assessment of RFID systems in IoT appli-
cations (Fernández-Caramés et al. 2016), and security requirements of autonomous 
ships (Kavallieratos et al. 2020). Lee and Park (2017), however, stated research on 
the security of maritime cloud computing remained underdeveloped. Furthermore, 
the problem of cyberattacks would demand further exploration (Fruth and Teuteberg 
2017). Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2019) pointed out that digital security in shipbuild-
ing and seaports was not the subject of any formal investigation.
Future research should revisit blockchain privacy/security risks, trying to mini-
mize them (Green et al. 2020). Ahokas et al. (2017) concluded that cybersecurity 
was not currently included in the International Maritime Organization’s port safety 
and security conventions such as international ship and port facility (ISPS) code or 
international safety management (ISM) code. Therefore, future studies should find 
ways of mitigating ports’ exposure to cyberthreats. Investigating risk, Kretschmann 
et al. (2017) concluded that future research should offer a clearer understanding of 
risks associated with higher degrees of autonomy in shipping. In addition to stud-
ies dealing with security and privacy, research should also address safety-related 
concerns in the implementation of I4.0 technologies, especially autonomous ships. 
Safety will be the most interesting and important aspect of autonomous ships 
(Ahvenjärvi 2016). Therefore, future research should explore the development of 
security and safety systems that can handle data security and data protection while 
dealing with data misuse and cyberattacks.

3.3.5  Environmental issues
Environmental issues can challenge the maritime industry. The adoption of the 
UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the ambitious objective of the 
International Maritime Organization to decarbonize the sector by 2050 have prompted 
researchers to inspect shipping companies’ activities/policies and their responses to 
the requirements of sustainable development (Di Vaio et al. 2021). I4.0 technologies 
represent a possible solution that can impact the environmental dimension of 
sustainability in the maritime industry. This section addresses the current research 
streams and future research trends concerned with maritime environmental issues in 
the light of I4.0.
As Table 9 shows, the most important emerging topics in the environmental theme 
of research on Maritime 4.0 included “sustainability,” “ship emission,” “energy 
efficiency,” “climate change,” and “carbon emission.” “Sustainability,” of course, 
was the most frequent keyword. This suggested that sustainability functioned as 
an umbrella concept that covered various sustainability-related concerns such as 
recycling, waste minimization, cleaner production, zero-emission, zero-growth 
economy, green economy, triple bottom line, life-cycle assessment, sustainable 
consumption, corporate social responsibility, blue economy, shared value creation, 
industrial ecology, and circular economy (D’Amato et al. 2017).
Exploring sustainability, Di Vaio and Varriale (2019) emphasized the 
importance of analyzing the link between I4.0, environmental sustainability, and 
accounting, by studying specific observations in the port industry. Strandhagen 
et  al. (2020) and Ramirez-Peña et  al. (2020) explored the impact of I4.0 
technologies on sustainable shipbuilding. Similarly, Del Giudice et  al. (2022) 
highlighted the importance of harnessing the role of digitalization and new 
technologies in integrating sustainability into seaports’ corporate strategy.
Keyword frequency measures in Table  9 show that, along with the focus on 
sustainability in research on Maritime 4.0, only circular economy (as a movement of 
sustainability), renewable energy (as a circular economy strategy), and ship emission 
and carbon emission (as zero-emission measures) received increasing attention as 
topical concerns. A few studies have addressed the link between circular economy 
and the maritime industry (Okorie et  al. 2018; Rosa et al. 2020). Meanwhile, only 
Jensen et al. (2021) probed into the integration of circular economy in Maritime 4.0. 
They constructed a digital framework that could reinforce maritime circular economy.
Fletcher et al. (2018) employed several machine learning algorithms to estimate 
shipping emissions (Fletcher et al. 2018). The frequency of “energy efficiency” as a 
keyword (see Table 9) indicated the importance of this concept as one of the foun-
dations of smart ports (De la Peña Zarzuelo et  al. 2020). Future research should 
also view Maritime 4.0 from the perspective of industrial symbiosis and social 
responsibility. Considering these issues, the study proposes a research framework 
guiding future research directions addressing Maritime 4.0 (see Fig.  6). The five 
themes identified link the current research topics with future research directions 
(see below for further explanation).

4  Results
This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the literature on Maritime 4.0 to 
identify recent emerging topics, gaps, and future research directions in this area 
of research. More specifically, the bibliometric analysis focused on the citations 
(publication distribution, productive journals, and collaborations between coun-
tries), cooccurrence of subject categories, cocitation analysis, and keyword fre-
quency analysis. The main findings of the study are reported below.

Industry 4.0 research in the maritime industry: a bibliometric…
1. The results of analyzing the publication trends (Fig. 2) revealed that the number 
of publications exploring Maritime 4.0 underwent a significant increase from 
2011 and could continue to grow rapidly in the next few years. The graph of the 
development of field showed two distinct periods: from 2011 to 2016 and from 
2016 to 2021 which marked the most productive period of research on this field.
2. The analysis of the statistics processed in CiteSpace and HistCite showed prom-
inent academic journals had published research on Maritime 4.0. In terms of the 
number of publications, the top three productive journals in this area of research 
were The Journal of Coastal Research, Ocean Engineering, and Sustainability, 
respectively.
3. The geographical distribution of the publications revealed that China (PRC), the 
USA, and Italy were the leading countries in studies concerned with Maritime 4.0. 
Analyzing collaborations across countries clarified that France had the highest 
rate of collaboration with other countries.
4. Investigating the distribution of the publications in terms of subject categories 
showed that the topics were strongly associated with engineering, followed by 
computer science, environmental sciences, and ecology.
5. A document cocitation analysis was conducted to detect research clusters, key 
publications, and intellectual bases. It was found that Khan et al. (2018) from 
Cluster #19, followed by Saberi et al. (2019) from Cluster #2, were the most 
cited authors in the network. Based on these results, there were five major 
research clusters that illustrated the historical evolution of research on Maritime 
4.0 studies: digitalization, AI, blockchain, maritime autonomous surface ships, 
and supply chain management. The findings also revealed that Cluster #0 was 
the largest and most active area of research, whereas Cluster #19 was the small-
est spot in the network.
6. Keyword frequency analysis demonstrated that the research hotspots stemmed 
from five themes: digitalization technology, methodology and techniques, man-
agement, safety and security, and environmental issues. The keyword frequency 
analysis of the literature revealed that, after 2016, researchers started to focus 
more on the third and second digital generations (I4.0 technologies and automa-
tion) than the first digital generation (IS and IT). The most extensively studied 
I4.0 technologies in the maritime industry were IoT, AI, and big data, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, 3D printing remained an underdeveloped topic, although it 
deserves further research. Recent studies addressed such subjects as the security 
and sustainability of Maritime 4.0. The most popular subjects in the theme of 
methodology and management were optimization, system, and performance.
7. In the light of the results of the bibliometric analysis and an in-depth literature 
review, the study proposed future research directions for each of the five themes 
identified, and it clarified how they could be linked to the existing research topics.
Finally, it should be emphasized that today’s maritime industry is transitioning 
into the highly digitalized industrial paradigm that I4.0 seeks to achieve. How-
ever, despite increasing research on I4.0 in the maritime industry, Maritime 4.0 
represents an underdeveloped topic that requires extensive research. In particular, 
its involvement in environmental issues (e.g., circular economy and shared value 
 D. Razmjooei et al.
1 3
creation) in the maritime industry remains insubstantial. From a managerial per-
spective, it would be necessary to explore the contributions of I4.0 technologies 
to monitoring, tracking, and controlling ships and cargo movement. In addition, it 
would be important to implement new digitized business models and develop con-
sistent standards for the implementation of I4.0 technologies. On the other hand, 
digital security seems to be the main challenge in the maritime industry. As such, 
researchers should explore essential security and safety measures while imple-
menting I4.0 technologies in this industry.
The study suggested some implications for business managers and academic 
researchers. Maritime companies should evaluate their digitalization level, explore 
I4.0 technologies compatible with their structures and services they offer to ship/
cargo owners, and move toward Maritime 4.0 to maximize their value retention. The 
findings can help researchers readily orient themselves to the findings in the liter-
ature and easily understand the frontiers of research on I4.0 technologies and the 
maritime industry. Furthermore, the findings can serve as a reference for research-
ers to gain awareness of the current status of research, the existing gaps, and future 
research trends in the field of Maritime 4.0. For instance, the findings offer valuable 
insight into the current and future research methods and techniques and the con-
tribution of each digital technology. Scholars must further explore underdeveloped 
I4.0 technologies in relation to environmental, methodological, managerial, and 
security issues in the maritime industry.
