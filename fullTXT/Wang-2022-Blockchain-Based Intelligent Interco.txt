+is article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the relevant content of blockchain; blockchain is a new field that has only
emerged in recent decades, and it has a high level of new energy that cannot be compared with other fields. +is article proposes
the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain and the current factors that trigger network security defense. A multimicrogrid
customer transaction system under the blockchain technology is also proposed. We will illustrate the compatibility between
multimicrogrid and blockchain, which is self-adaptive and can be adjusted in time with market changes. +ird, in order to ensure
the normal operation of the distribution network, a smart contract dynamic constraint scheme is designed for power flow
constraints and voltage offset problems. Multimicrogrid system as energy interconnection research on multiagent competitive
game on multimicrogrid system is crucial to the development of energy Internet technology. Blockchain-based decision-making
systems exist based on a comprehensive analysis of the needs and interests of microgrid operators, large users, and distributed
aggregators. For the complex problem of multimicrogrid system competition game model, a suitable solution method (IACO) is
proposed. +e model and solution algorithm established by the experiment are accurately analyzed, and the simulation result is
that the optimal electricity price strategy in the subdivision field can effectively balance the interests of different market players and
achieve win-win and coordinated development. Experiments show that IACO can deal with the multiple problems of blockchain.
1. Introduction
In view of the defects of the existing blockchain system, this
paper proposes Hawk, a brand-new decentralized block-
chain, which perfectly solves the problem of exposing the
privacy of customers to the blockchain. +e compiler it uses
zero-knowledge proof, etc. +e cryptographic primitives are
written into an efficient cryptographic protocol between the
contracting party and the blockchain, thus ensuring its
security [1]. +rough the comparison and combination of
blockchain and the Internet, this paper analyzes several
advantages and concludes that if applicable, the integration
of blockchain and the Internet will definitely cause a historic
change in the industry, which will lead to more uncertain
roads in the future [2]. +e performance problems of the
early Bitcoin POW blockchain are no longer meaningful
today, so this paper makes a simple comparison between
POW blockchain and BFT blockchain, and studies how to
improve the scalability limit problem, and also provides a
comprehensive understanding of “+e ultimate” blockchain
structure is outlined [3]. +is paper proposes a basic model
of the blockchain system, discusses the principle, technol-
ogy, method and application of the blockchain, and the
related Bitcoin system. We also discuss smart contracts and
their applications, and propose future trends in a block-
chain-enabled parallel society. +is paper mainly provides
some reliable data for future work [4]. +is paper addresses
the innovative impact of blockchain’s verification and
network costs on shaping digital platforms, where shared
data supports multiple intellectual property rights and al-
lows participants to coinvest without assigning market
power to platform operators. +ey also challenge existing
revenue models and present opportunities for new ap-
proaches to data ownership and licensing [5]. In this paper,
3G technology and GpsOne technology are combined in the
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), the principle is
described, and the working principle and hardware structure

interconnection system are discussed [6]. +e Internet of
+ings intelligence in the field of power system can play the
role of early warning and protection through computers,
remote monitoring, etc. [7]. In this paper, the intelligent
high-speed loom industrial interconnection remote moni-
toring system is designed from the hardware system and the
software system. +e system briefly describes the data
communication and data transmission between the web
server and the remote client, and meets the needs of in-
dustrial sites [8]. Aiming at the current situation that the
abnormal protective layer current of the cross-linked high-
voltage cable system cannot accurately reflect the insulation
status, this paper proposes a solution and forms a corre-
sponding intelligent interconnection system, which effec-
tively solves the current protection and facilitates the
monitoring andmaintenance of the cable [9]. In this paper, a
multidevice intelligent interconnection method and system
based on Bluetooth are invented. +e system sends a request
to the peripheral device through the central device, the
peripheral device reports the service type, and repeats the
above operations to complete the networking. +e business
connection provides convenience [10]. In this paper, the
optimal decision-making problem in the TAFC task is
obtained through various schemes, and its six models are
analyzed to further prove the optimal trade-off between
speed and accuracy. Performance makes new predictions
[11].+is paper describes that learning the value of options
in an uncertain environment is the core of optimal de-
cision-making, and proves that the ACC does not detect
errors and correct them, but guides, and does not
maintain reward responses after ACC damage, nor does it
integrate risk and earnings [12]. +is paper studies the
optimal data fusion problem in the sense of Neyman-
Pearson (NP) test in a centralized fusion center. Examples
are derived from the constraints on the sensor system,
channel capacity, etc., and provide a method for adjusting
the threshold level at the fusion center [13]. In this paper,
Clethrionomys glareolus was studied through food addi-
tion grids and control grids, and six conclusions were
drawn using the capture-mark technique. Finally, there
was no evidence that delayed maturation in voles was the
best strategy for evolution [14]. +is paper studies the
optimal data fusion problem in the sense of Neyman-
Pearson (NP) test. +e fusion center receives data and
then performs the NP test by the sensor. +e results show
that multiple sensors are also possible for the system.
Finally, a method for adjusting the threshold is obtained
[15].
2. Blockchain-Related Content
2.1. Background of Blockchain. +e emergence of Bitcoin in
2008 has led to a new round of technological revolution
and the rapid development of related industries. +e
blockchain was born and swept the Internet and tradi-
tional economic circles at a lightning-fast speed. +e
blockchain is an Internet database technology, which
divides data into many blocks and then passes through
some kind of secret. A technology connects them into a
data network, which is different from traditional data-
bases. +e data in the blockchain is safe and shared, so it
can also be seen as a distributed and shared data library.
Blockchain is a decentralized distributed storage tech-
nology that can establish trust relationships without a
network. At present, blockchain is mainly used in research
in many fields such as Internet of +ings, financial ser-
vices, electronic depository, digital identity, and educa-
tion. +ey can be divided into three types of blockchains:
public chain, private chain, and alliance chain. Different
blockchain types are aimed at different application sce-
narios, and they have their own advantages and disad-
vantages, so they are divided into three types of blocks.
Blockchains are uninterrupted digital transactions of
economic transactions that can be programmed to record
almost anything of value, not just financial transactions.
Simply put, it is a decentralized database containing data
that cannot be modified, managed by a cluster of com-
puters, and not owned by any one party. Blockchains are
saved as databases or flat files.
2.2. Design Concept Based on Alliance Chain. In the appli-
cation field of alliance blockchain, when all nodes receive the
transaction file, they will reach a consensus on a set of bit
vectors. When the transaction size is greater than or equal to
250 bytes and the number of nodes is about 100, the per-
formance effect is greatly improved. From another angle to
analyze the blockchain, we can find that it is actually a
distributed system. Brewer’s theorem is an important theory
in distributed systems, indicating that distribution can be
divided into consistency, availability, and partition fault
tolerance. Consistency is related to the degree of data or state
consistency between different entities in a distributed sys-
tem. From a practical point of view, consistency actually
reflects the uniqueness of the system to the services provided
by the client; availability is that the system can continue to
send requests when there are roadblocks within the dis-
tributed system; partition fault tolerance is that the system
divides data into.+ere are many different types and they are
divided into different areas for storage according to their
types. If there is a problem in one area, it will not imagine the
normal work of other areas, and will not affect the operation
of the system.
2.3. Blockchain Technology. +e essence of blockchain
technology is the decentralization and decentralization of
data storage, transmission, and authentication as a technical
area. It is used to replace the current Internet dependency on
a central server, which then records all data changes or
transaction items. In the cloud system, in-transit analysis is
theoretically completed. Broadly speaking, it goes beyond
traditional methods of verifying information that must rely
on a central location, reducing the cost of establishing a
global “credit.” +is new approach indirectly demonstrates
the “foundation protocol” that creates the foundation of
distributed artificial intelligence. A new share interface is
created between human brain intelligence and machine
intelligence.

2.4. Relevant Features of Blockchain
2.4.1. Features of Blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed
digital ledger that keeps pace with the times. It has the fol-
lowing four characteristics: 1. Distributed ledger: +e block-
chain is just like taking notes when we listen to lectures. It has a
security record for every transaction in the Internet, and there
will be no unknown transactions or forgetting transactions.
Situation is highly secure and available. 2. Irreversibility: From
the public’s understanding of the blockchain, one of the
cornerstones of the blockchain is nontampering, so people will
not work in this opposite direction. +eoretically, it is possible
to reverse the transaction, but this requires 51% of the com-
puting power to recognize your reversal. Logically speaking,
this is actually an economic game theory, and 51% of the
computing power will not agree with your reversal. If you take
10,000 steps back and say that if you have 51% of the com-
puting power, you have no reason to reverse and destroy. 3.
Anticensorship: +e blockchain itself keeps a record of every
transaction, ever made, which prevents the tracking of
blockchain projects. 4. Near real-time settlement: its internal
time is very close to the outside world, which ensures that the
customer’s transaction confirmation time is almost the same,
thus reducing the insecurity of the transaction party.
2.4.2. Advantages of Blockchain. Blockchain is an innovative
application model of computers in the Internet era, such as
distributed data storage and point-to-point transmission
consensus mechanism encryption algorithm. It has five major
advantages: decentralization, openness, autonomy, informa-
tion immutability, and anonymity. +e five basic advantages
have been generally agreed upon. 1. Decentralization: refers to
the use of decentralized accounting and storage in the
blockchain, without centralized management. All nodes have
equal rights and obligations, and system maintenance is
handled by specialized maintenance nodes. 2. Openness: +e
so-called opennessmeans that the blockchain system is open to
the outside world. Only specific information is hidden and
others are open to everyone. Anyone can query the data
through a secure interface. 3. Autonomy: +e autonomy of
blockchain is based on specifications and protocols. Nodes in
the system can freely convert data, so that they can believe that
human operations cannot be changed. 4. Information cannot
be tampered with: When the user’s information is added to the
system and confirmed, it cannot be modified. Only half of the
nodes can be manipulated to modify the content, which is why
the stability and reliability of the blockchain are very high. 5.
Anonymous letter: It means that the exchange between nodes
follows a fixed algorithm, and customers will not disclose their
identities for each other to identify. +ese unique advantages
will over time change the relationship between various in-
dustries in the future.
2.5.+e Impact of the External Environment on the Blockchain
System
2.5.1. Self-Factors. In the 21st century, it is very common for
people to cause irreparable losses to the blockchain system
due to their own operational errors. Among them, people
mainly change, attack, and destroy the network system
autonomously, which leads to the leakage of information
and network paralysis. Many hackers will use its proficiency
in computers to implant viruses on corporate or personal
computers, so as to achieve their desired goals. For example,
in 2012, the hacker sent a Chinese version, embedded a
backdoor in the Chinese version of putty, searchedmany key
things from Baidu, and owned his registered domain name
(https://putty.org.cn.cn)), promote the site, and steal the
admin. Send the SSH username and password entered by the
administrator to the designated server. In March 2015, the
attacker hijacked the JS script of Baidu Ad Alliance and
replaced it with malware. In addition, on August 1, 2014, a
large-scale denial of service attack was launched on GitHub
using foreign users to access Chinese websites, according to
the official Weibo account of Zhejiang Province. Hackers
attacked the set-top boxes of cable TV network users,
causing reactionary propaganda and affecting people’s
normal TV viewing, which had a negative impact. +rough
these events that have occurred, 75% of the crimes are out of
the inside.
2.5.2. Influence of Network Resources. Resource sharing is
the advantage of big data network. Whether it is from
various hardware devices, software data, or a large amount of
data and information, it is very convenient for users to query
information and achieve effective resource sharing. In ad-
dition, not only all network users can access server resources,
but also various information and data can be shared between
different terminal devices. +is provides a resource and
many criminals use this device to steal and destroy infor-
mation. +is will cause huge economic losses to users and
network construction. +e environment has become un-
manageable, and confidence in the Internet has been lost. In
order to solve this problem, users should not only participate
in the security of network data responsibly but also optimize
the network environment, strengthen the internal firewall
settings of the system, and build a safe and environmentally
friendly network space for customers as much as possible.
2.5.3. Data Transfer Impact. According to relevant research,
communication lines can also lead to the risk of information
leakage, especially with the emergence of 5G network
technology. All kinds of information technology and
equipment fill people’s field of vision. It has brought us a lot
of convenience, but there are also a lot of security problems.
In view of the current actual situation, many companies or
their families have not done a good job of data shielding.
+erefore, some illegal users use monitoring communica-
tion lines to obtain their personal information. Some un-
scrupulous people connect our computers through high-end
devices. So as to opportunistically intervene in the com-
munication interface, send them the basic information that
we usually surf the Internet. In addition, there are many
ways we do not know how to steal our important data, such
as illegality. +ere will be intrusion, illegal use, injection of
illegal information, line interference, etc. in the
Security and Communication Networks 3
https://putty.org.cn.cn
communication line, so sufficient measures must be taken to
protect the security of data communication.
2.5.4. Virus Effects. Factors that affect the failure of network
security defenses include the intrusion of computer viruses
that control the behavior of computer software and hard-
ware, which can steal useless information. Legal activity has
a huge impact on users. +ere are many types of computer
viruses, and their attack characteristics on the device net-
work are also different. Some viruses are responsible for
infecting your files and crashing them, while others attack
your computer’s defenses.+erefore, it is unlikely to detect it
and remove the virus completely; mainly file-type viruses
which are designed to infect unused areas of the disk with
viruses. Some DOS functions are often used to spread vi-
ruses. +is will lead to a huge waste of disk space and will
affect the normal operation of our computer. Not only will it
cause our data to be lost, but it will also render our computer
useless. Complexity of the blockchain itself: +e blockchain
network is very complex. With the increase of transaction
customers and different transaction methods, this greatly
reduces the stability of the blockchain system. Super high
energy consumption: As far as the Bitcoin blockchain is
concerned, it consumes more energy than the entire Swit-
zerland. It is conceivable how huge the energy consumption
of the entire blockchain is. Lack of skilled operators: Due to
the huge and complex system of the blockchain, there are
very few people who learn it, resulting in the loss of talents in
this area.
3. Mathematical Model of Blockchain
Market Entities
+e transparency and diversification of blockchain tech-
nology can make the market better adapt to its own
structure. Each of these nodes has its own smart contract
data according to its own terms, such as financial infor-
mation, customer information, and dynamic contracts, and
can track transaction information between different users.
After analysis and evaluation, we will optimize the operation
strategy, provide users with optimization and transaction
convenience, formulate the purchase and sale of electricity in
the electricity market, and pursue the optimization of our
own profits. In the multimicrogrid system, microgrid op-
erators, large users, and decentralized aggregators partici-
pate in the market game. In order to pursue the optimization
of their own profits, they are in different stages. +erefore,
obtaining ultrahigh profits through competition in the
market under blockchain technology is the most concerned
issue of every industry.
3.1. Demands of Microgrid Operators under the Blockchain.
Since the energy (wind, solar, etc.) in the blockchain
microgrid is intermittent, in a unit cycle, the content se-
quence must be balanced with its own load, and the external
environment generally provides more or less power. If the
system has surplus power, the microgrid operator sells the
surplus power to other microgrid operators, large users, and
some individual users in pursuit of profit optimization and
profit RMO
sell (t). If the system is out of power, the microgrid
operator will purchase electricity from the operator with
excess power in the external environment to protect itself
and incur power purchase costs CMO
buy (t). At the same time,
under the multi-microgrid market mechanism of blockchain
technology, microgrid operators benefit from improved
secondary energy utilization, the return of additional carbon
emissions, and the adverse cost of additional carbon
emissions. +eir presentation is as follows.

electricity from the outside to maintain its own operation,
which will generate electricity purchase costs; when the
system has excess electricity, it will sell part of the electricity
to gain revenue. +is will generate profit. +is is the only
formula: net profit from selling electricity� revenue from
selling electricity− cost of buying electricity.

As the energy consumers on the demand side, the main
purpose of large users is to obtain the target electricity
produced at the lowest cost. Some large users also have
specific power generation capabilities to sell excess power
outdoors. +is paper simplifies the model, assuming that the
main users of the multimicrogrid system are not qualified to
generate electricity. Considering only the purchase of
electricity by large users, the purpose of most large users to
purchase electricity includes the cost of purchasing elec-
tricity from the microgrid operator CMtoU
buy (t) and the cost of
purchasing electricity at the distributed aggregator CAtoU

+e specific form of electricity purchase depends on the
electricity sales strategy of each business.

3.3. Distributed Aggregator Requirements. Blockchain tech-
nology will automatically generate smart contracts, collect
and store distributed secondary energy, centrally manage
distributed energy, and realize transactions. Coordinated
control of various power generation resources by distributed
aggregators constantly requires customers to enter the
power market, and concord is also a fast consumption
method for realizing energy. Decentralized aggregators
mainly use bid-ask spreads to maximize profits. +ey buy
electricity at the lowest cost on the one hand and sell it at the
highest profit on the other. +e specific performance is as

electricity price Psell(t) (the unit is Yuan/(kWh)). +e unit
price of the microgrid operator is actually the selling price
of the power company in period t. +erefore, microgrid
operators can temporarily ignore the unit price of elec-
tricity according to the established strategy. To maximize
your own profits, just sell on a case-by-case basis. In this
way, the electricity sales method of the microgrid op-
erator i is:

(5) Improvement Method
In a multimicrogrid, if the parameters a and b are not
selected correctly, it will directly affect the speed of the
experimental solution and the effect of the solution. In order
to improve the ACO calculation performance, the param-
eters a, b can be defined as
a � 1 + e
− 0.1Nmax ,
b �
2.5
e
1−a
+ 1
.
(26)
where Nmax is the maximum number of repetitions and it
can control one parameter to control multiple other pa-
rameters, which enhances the liquidity between them.
Formulas (23) and (24) are further improvement formulas
for the electricity sold by the multimicrogrid.+ey can make
the system run more efficiently and finally help customers
get the maximum benefit. If there is no improved formula,
not only the whole system is running, there is a high
probability that the system will crash due to the huge data, so
these two formulas are essential.
4. Experiment and Analysis of
Multimicrogrid under Blockchain
4.1. Overall Model Diagram of Blockchain Power System.
Figure 1 shows that the power system under the blockchain
operates cyclically. At the beginning, it is necessary to find
suitable data information in the big environment of the
blockchain. After finding, the power dispatching plan is
automatically generated according to the matching dis-
patching model and dispatching strategy. Intelligent ad-
justment is made according to different power generation
conditions, and finally the data is updated and the sorted
results are fed back to the dispatching model for im-
provement. First, the transaction information must be
collected in the blockchain, and then spread to the entire
network through the P2P network in the form of smart
contracts. +e nodes will synthesize blocks and reach a
consensus. If the security check is met, proceed to the next
step. To prevent it from running, the data that has passed is
collected by the smart meter and recorded in the blockchain.
After the transaction time, the system automatically com-
pletes the value transfer.
4.2. Transaction Analysis and Comparison of Multimicrogrid
Interconnection Systems. Figures 2 and 3, respectively, show
the daily average transaction price and transaction volume of
the multimicrogrid interconnection system. Looking at
Figure 1 alone, the final average transaction price of the
multimicrogrid system is located in the middle of the
electricity selling price and the on-grid electricity price.
Compared with the previous traditional transaction model
of “setting the price to go online, the remaining amount is
connected to the Internet,” the producer can have more
Security and Communication Networks 7
electricity sales benefits on the trading platform, and con-
sumers can save more electricity bills. As shown in Figure 2,
the multimicrogrid system can meet the needs of most
electricity purchasers, but at 7:00–15:00, due to the problem
of the producer, the electricity sold is not enough, which will
make the generator set of the backup scheme. +e group
provides the electricity required by consumers. +e time
period from 19:00 to 20:00 is that the platform has not
passed the dynamic constraint check, and transactions
cannot be performed during this period. +e average elec-
tricity price of multiple microgrids will vary with time
during the day. Between 10:00 and 15:00, the multimicrogrid
system will purchase electricity to meet the needs of cus-
tomers due to lack of electricity, which will lead to an in-
crease in electricity prices and increase customer
consumption. It is not difficult to see from the comparison of
the two figures that the transaction volume will affect the
average electricity price; as the transaction volume increases,
the electricity price will also increase.
Figure 4 shows the optimal electricity prices provided by
different operators at different times under the multi-
microgrid interconnection system. From the above data, it
can be seen that the customer’s electricity demand reaches its
peak in the morning, and these markets sell electricity at
higher prices. Use this time to get the best benefit. When the
price for large users reaches the best moment, the microgrid
operator sets the price of electricity sales at 1.6 yuan/(kw·h),
while the price of distributed aggregators is up to 1.7 yuan/
(kw·h). If the price of the distributed aggregator is lower than
the price of the microgrid, it will not generate high profits, so
the price of the distributed aggregator is set at 1.7 yuan/
(kw.h), At this time, both parties achieve the optimal effect.
4.3. Multimicrogrid Self-Value Method and Dynamic Con-
straint Analysis. In order to reflect the obvious comparison,
Figure 4 compares the fixed aggressive values of 0.05, 0.09,
0.12, the zero-information strategy, and the ZI aggressive
value. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the ZI aggressive
value is in the range of (0.05, 0.09).+is data experiment Fair
and accurate. As can be seen from the figure, the average
values obtained by these methods are very similar. +e
number of transaction cycles of the adaptive aggressive value
is less than that of other methods, because the value it selects
is the data selected from the market, and the size of the value
can be determined in the system to improve the success of
trading between customers.
Figure 6 shows the optimization decision for voltage
offset in a multimicrogrid system. It can be seen from the
figure that under the condition of no voltage offset con-
straint of multimicrogrid, after meeting the customer’s
demand, the producer will put the surplus power into the
storage grid to obtain greater profits. +is makes the voltage
excursion range of the node larger than the constraint. For
the voltage offset between 0.890 pu and 1.110 pu, the voltage
offset with constraints and without constraints accounts for
97.2% and 93.5%, respectively, so the voltage offset with
constraints is more advantageous in multimicrogrid sys-
tems.+e presence or absence of the voltage offset constraint

has little effect on the electricity sold by the multimicrogrid.
In these two cases, their electricity prices are basically the
same; and the number of affected nodes in these two en-
vironments differs by a single digit. Nodes are negligible in
the grid system. Voltage offset constraints are optional, but
the voltage offset with constraints is more stable and reliable
in the system.
Table 1 shows the power flow distribution of each branch
with dynamic constraint check without dynamic constraint
check from Table 1 at 19:50 in the multimicrogrid time
period. It can be seen that the none of the trends exceeded
their limits.
4.4. Smart Contract TransactionDetails. Tables 2 and 3 show
the experimental status, transaction results and transaction
information of the multimicrogrid under the blockchain
during the entire transaction cycle. It can be seen from
Table 2 that the lowest bid price z on the producer side is
higher than the highest bid price x on the consumer side, so
all customers in the multimicrogrid adjust their bids in turn
according to the adaptive aggressive value. After repeated
attempts, after the real quotation provided by consumer x,
the z quotation of the producer side is lower than the
quotation of consumer x, and the two negotiate with each
other to reach a consensus. After the successful transaction
and settlement of the two, the producer’s z still has excess
electricity, and after the consumer c provides the real
quotation, the price of x is lower than the price of c, so c
matches x. However, the consumer c does not get enough
electricity and the quotation reaches the quotation of the
producer v, so v and c are matched, but the transaction of v
and c cannot pass the dynamic constraint check, so the
failure to match the two causes the transaction to fail to
reach the transaction limit repeatedly. +erefore, after b on
the consumer side submits the real quotation, the quotation
of b is lower than that of c and higher than that of v, so v
matches b, and the transaction is concluded when all con-
ditions are met. However, at this time, v and b still have
excess power, so v and b requote, and the two directly enter
the next transaction until the end of the transaction. +e
final settlement result is that the accounts of consumers x, c
and b transferred 20.00, 54.80, and 55.70 ether, respectively,
and the corresponding amount of electricity was added to
the accounts. Producers v and z sold 70, 110 kW·h, and they
obtained the same amount of ether. +e corresponding
power is 55.80 and 77.10 ether.

efficiency, we compare the transaction time with the com-
putational complexity of participating customers. +e
trading time of the experiment is set in the table generated
when the first microgrid user publishes the actual offer.
Moreover, in order to better compare the computing effi-
ciency of smart contracts and traditional transaction modes,
the experiment simulated the highest trend of traditional
centralized transaction mode and smart contract mode. All
the experimental results are shown in Table 4. It can be seen
that the gas cost of the constrained platform is higher than
that of the unconstrained platform, so that the experimental
conclusions are in line with their actual calculation amount.
In terms of time comparison, the time difference be-
tween the constrained platform and the unconstrained
platform is almost the same, which shows that the gas cost of
the dynamic constraint method is relatively high, but its
computing efficiency is guaranteed and can meet the actual
situation of customers. In Matlab, the time of the smart
contract mode is much lower than the time of the traditional
mode. +is comparison highlights that the decentralized
transaction model is more excellent than the traditional
method. +e computing time of both platforms is greater
than that of the smart contract model., which is a difference
caused by their different mechanisms: it requires operating
on the platform interface, although the platform takes much
more time than them, but it has security and consistency that
the latter two cannot compare in response to this problem.
Table 4 gives specific data so that we can clearly recognize its
advantages; the experiment comprehensively lists four ex-
perimental objects, and the smart contract model is far
superior to the other three types in terms of transaction time
and cost.
B. It can be seen from Table 5 that the average times of
IACO and ACO are lower than GA and PSO algorithms,
which reflects ACO.+e overall convergence ability of GA is
higher than that of GA and PSO algorithms. In addition, the
IIMO, IIA, and CU of IACO and ACO are better than GA
and PSO algorithms, indicating that the overall convergence
ability of ACO is also better than that of GA and PSO al-
gorithms. +is is a microgrid system under the ACO
multiblockchain network. It is a powerful detection function
and efficient solution to optimization problems, so people
will choose this algorithm to manage their own blockchain
in most cases, and its various experimental results show its
advantages, which makes us more firmly believe it. +rough
the experimental data in Figure 5, the average number of
times of IACO is less than that of ACO, and the IIMO, IIA,
and CU of IACO are higher than those of ACO, which
indicates that the evolution of volatile factor Q and control
factors b and d indirectly increases the normal frequency.
+e overall detection ability and convergence ability of ACO
improves the computing efficiency, which leads to better
results. Finally, we draw the final conclusion on the overall
analysis: based on the basic characteristics of the blockchain
system and ACO, we have made experiments on this. Table 5
shows the general operation steps and processes of this
experiment. IACO has better overall detection ability and
convergence function when solving blockchain multi-
objective problems, and the solving efficiency is far greater
than other algorithms.
C. In addition, the follow-up experiments compared and
analyzed the solution efficiency of IACO, ACO, and PSO
algorithms in the blockchain for various main competition
models of multimicrogrid. As can be seen from Figure 7, the
experiment analyzed four algorithms.+e solution efficiency
of them under different network nodes is made. When the
number of network nodes is 10, the figure shows that IACO
is slightly higher than the other three algorithms, but the
difference between them is not large; however, as more and
more network nodes are added later, the internal algorithm
model becomes larger and larger., more and more complex,
the solution efficiency of ACO has become more excellent,
and the calculation time in the same scale is equal to that of
GA and PSO algorithms, which proves that the decentral-
ization ability of ACO strengthens the communication
between blockchain subjects. +e model can be solved more
effectively. In addition, with the continuous addition of
nodes, it can be seen from the figure that PSO and GA will
eventually overlap, and it can also be seen that the solution
efficiency of IACO is higher than that of ACO, indicating
that the continuous changes to the algorithm enhance the

ability, and then improve the efficiency of IACO solution. It
can be seen from Table 5 that the average convergence times
of GA are lower than that of PSO, and IIMO, IIA, and CU
are all better than PSO, which proves that GA is more
suitable for multimicrogrid system than PSO; Figure 7 also
confirms this. It is just that with the continuous addition of
nodes, their solution efficiency overlaps, which shows that
the difference between them will gradually decrease with the
size of the system and eventually shrink to negligible.
5. Conclusion
+e theme of this paper is the optimal decision-making of
intelligent interconnected systems based on blockchain, in
which the background, design concept, related character-
istics, and unfavorable factors of blockchain are studied.
Experiments are also designed, and the market competition
of multimicrogrid systems is established by analyzing game
problems, microgrid operators, large users, distributed
blockchain technology-based aggregators, and other market
player’s needs and thoroughly consider local multi-
microgrid. A competitive game model for the grid market
competitive relationships among multiple disciplines and
their goals. +rough a variety of diagrams and tables, the
decentralization shared by the blockchain network and ACO
is based on the characteristics of IACO. We propose a
general method and procedure to solve the multimicrogrid
market competition based on IACO. Compared with the
algorithms of ACO, GA, and PSO, IACO solves multiple
problems under the blockchain technology and has better
overall detection and convergence capabilities. +is method
can comprehensively analyze the advantages and disad-
vantages of the algorithm in the multimicrogrid network
through experiments. +e experimental process is simple
and fast, and the charts drawn in the later summary are clear
and clear; through comparison, it is concluded that IACO
solves multiobjective problems under blockchain technol-
ogy. +e global search ability and convergence ability are
stronger, and the solution efficiency is higher.
