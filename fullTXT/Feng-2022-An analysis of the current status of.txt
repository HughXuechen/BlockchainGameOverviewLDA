Abstract
Purpose – The rise of the metaverse has brought profound changes to the economic and social operation
models and injected new vitality into academic research. Although a large number of studies have emerged,
there are few quantitative analyses of development frontiers and trends.
Design/methodology/approach – From a bibliometric perspective, this paper selects 183 pieces of
metaverse-related literature in theWoS core database since 2000 as the object of analysis. This paper sums up
the characteristics of the literature using the methods of descriptive statistical analysis, keywords analysis,
thematic evolution analysis and summarizes the core themes and the laws of metaverse development in
each stage.
Findings – The digital economy vision brought by the metaverse has led to an increasing number of
researchers and achievements in this field. But the depth and breadth of research are still insufficient and
unevenly distributed in the region, and the cross-fertilization fields need to be expanded. From the industry’s
point of view, VR games represented by Second Life and My World have contributed to the popularity of the
metaverse. As technology progresses, the research hotspots in the field of metaverse gradually develop from
conceptual research to artificial intelligence, blockchain, NFT and other technical applications. However,
academic research has not yet caught up with the industry’s pace and staysmore in the concept discussion and
preliminary application stage.
Originality/value – A systematic overview of the current status, knowledge structure and hot issues of
metaverse research is shown, which provides a thematic axis for this field, enriches and improves the
quantitative analysis of its literature and provides a clear picture for researchers to continuously promote the
development of this field. At the same time, it is necessary to warn that technological development is a double-
edged sword. The process of metaverse development should return to rationality, respect the laws of its
development and guarantee the healthy development of the metaverse by strengthening legal regulation and
the ethical review of science and technology.

1. Introduction
In March 2021, the sandbox game Roblox—the first stock in the metaverse, was
successfully launched, and Chinese gaming company Tencent also committed to
developing products related to the metaverse. In July of the same year, Zuckerberg said
that Facebook would transform itself into a metaverse company within five years and
renamed the parent company “Meta” (short for Metaverse). Is this series of moves by
Facebook simply to attract attention (Smith and Brooks, 2022), or is it a reflection of the
shift to the virtual for social and work, offering new opportunities for learning and
working (Kraus et al., 2022)? These developments all suggest that the metaverse is an

important driver of contemporary technology, but they do not tell us what the metaverse is
(Fernandez, 2022), as we will discuss in later sections of the article. Whatever the answer,
the world’s largest social network, Facebook’s pioneering placement of the metaverse has
accelerated the influx of Internet companies into the metaverse space. At the same time,
with the entry of a large amount of capital, the public and academic circles are payingmore
andmore attention to this concept. The Baidu search index for the topic of the metaverse in
China has continued to climb since August 2021 and reached a peak of 126,575 in
December 2021; for example, in June 2022, the number of academic papers related to the
topic of “metaverse” at CNKI exceeded 1,000.
At present, metaverse research is mostly concentrated in the fields of computer
software and applications, automation and other scientific and technological fields
(Matsubara and Oguchi, 2010), some scholars have also focused on the integration of the
metaverse with traditional fields such as journalism and media, library and intelligence,
environmental science and education (Kim et al., 2022; Ma, 2022; Rillig et al., 2022). While
the metaverse literature is growing and the research hotspots are changing, there is still a
paucity of literature analyzing the current state of research in the field of the metaverse,
and there is a lack of work to comb through the studies that have been done. To grasp the
current development of the field of the metaverse and its evolution trends, this paper
selects the existing literature on the Web of Science for analysis and visualizes the
thematic evolutionary paths and frontier hotspots of the field by summarizing the
characteristics of existing research results in the field of the metaverse to provide insights
for the long-term development of metaverse. To help scholars further understand the
nature and development of the metaverse, the research questions to be solved in this paper
are as follows:
RQ1. Since the concept of metaverse was proposed, what are the characteristics of the
results in the field of metaverse?
RQ2. What are the prospects for the metaverse concept itself and its technological
achievements in other fields of application?
RQ3. How have the research hotspots in the field of metaverse changed since 2000, and
what are the implications for future research?
2. Overview of metaverse
So far, many scholars have elaborated on this concept from different perspectives. From a
literal perspective, the metaverse means that humans both live in the natural universe and
use the digital universe to cross the limits of the natural universe to exercise human initiative
and achieve human freedom (Huang and Cao, 2022). However, if we discuss it from the
technical level, the metaverse is a virtual world and survival vision that starts from the game
platform is based on digital currency and is supported by the synchronous emergence of a
series of integrated digital technologies and hardware technologies, in which human life is
deeply involved (Yuan and Yang, 2022). From the perspective of the economic system, the
metaverse is a virtual but highly interconnected open-source platform constructed by a
closed-loop economy. It has the characteristics of synchronization with the real world, high
fidelity, open sources, innovation and creation, sustainable development and closed-loop
operation, as well as low cost and high resolution. It can be used in distributed collaboration,
3D data model exploration, scientific visualization and other aspects (Yu, 2021; Shi et al.,
2004). From the perspective of social media, the metaverse is a set of virtual spaces that can
provide a platform for the common exploration and co-creation of people in different physical
spaces (Fernandez, 2022).

At present, it is generally accepted that the concept of “metaverse” originates from the novel
avalanche written by Neal Stephenson (Neal, 1992), a famous American science fiction writer.
According to statistics, the word “Metaverse” appeared 116 times in the book. This book is
known as the cornerstone of the concept of the metaverse. The consensus on the concept of the
metaverse cannot be reachedwithout the development of science and technology. Since themid-
20th century, electronic information science and technology have developed rapidly. The new
generation of the technological revolution in the 21st century has laid a solid foundation for the
development of the metaverse. With the landmark achievements of the core technologies of the
metaverse communication technology, interaction technology, computing power and core
algorithm (Guo, 2022), the development and popularization of the metaverse have been further
accelerated. The materialization of the concept of the metaverse is also inseparable from the
promotion of Internet enterprises. At the beginning of 2021, soul app first proposed to build a
“socialmetaverse” in the internet industry; InMarch of the sameyear, Roblox, knownas the first
stock of metaverse, was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange; since then, Haier,
NVIDIA, Facebook, Baidu, Sony and other enterprises have also launched the metaverse
platform. The competing layout of the internet and technology enterprises hasmade the concept
of metaverse gradually known to everyone.
The continuous development of the metaverse is also inseparable from the close attention of
academia. At the beginning of the concept of “Metaverse”, some scholars started to study the
emerging business opportunities in the metaverse, the moral influence and its application in the
social world from “Second Life” (Papagiannidis et al., 2008; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2009). Recently,
Siriborvornratanakul (2019) and other scholars have devoted themselves to AR research and
summarized modern AR into five waves, includingMarker-Based AR, Spatial ARwith Projector,
Wearable AR for Corporate, Markerless AR in Smartphone and AR Underneath Artificial
Intelligence. They also gave a detailed description of the development process and application
status of each wave, which laid a solid theoretical foundation for the development of metaverse-
related technologies. Siriborvornratanakul (2016) also proposed two strategies for combining VR
headsets and heart rate sensors for research, which provided a new communication channel for
VR devices to interact with users. Besides Du et al. (2022) conducted a bibliometric analysis of 51
papers that studied the application of AR in retail, which revealed the current status of AR
scholarlyworks in retail. As the research ofVR,ARandother technologies get deeper, scholars are
increasingly enthusiastic about exploring the metaverse. At the 2022 World Mobile
Communication Conference, “Metaverse” made its debut in the “hot search” list of the
conference and became the focus of the conference. Metaverse technology itself, the profit model
and related ethical issueswere hotly discussed (Guo et al., 2022). Metaverse is regarded as the next
generation Internet at theworld-famous international consumer electronics exhibition (Kesselman
and Esquivel, 2022), and its pillars are Virtual Meetings, Simulations, Remote Collaboration,
Immersive Design, Marketing and Developing New Skills.
To sum up, this paper argues that the metaverse is a metaphor for the real world, that is, a
relatively independent but highly interconnected virtual space with the real world. Metaverse is
likely to become an important direction of the next generation of scientific and technological
development, bringing great changes to people’s lifestyles. However, at this stage, due to the
limitations of the technical level and commercialization effect, there is still a long way to go before
the ultimate metaverse is built. Promoting the healthy development of the metaverse still requires
the joint efforts of industry and academia.
3. Data sources and research methods
3.1 Data sources
TheWeb of Science database includes the famous three major citation index databases (SCI,
SSCI and A&HCI), which include authoritative journals in various subject areas (Wang,
The current
status of
metaverse
2022b). Its strict selection criteria and citation indexing mechanismmakeWoS both a tool for
literature retrieval and one of the most important sources of bibliographic data for
scientometric research. Therefore, theWoS database is used as the data retrieval platform in
this study. The first search has yielded 201 papers, and the retrieval strategies are as follows:
(1) Subject 5 (“Metaverse” OR “Non-Fungible Token”).
(2) Publication date 5 (January 1, 2000–June 6, 2022).
(3) Database 5 (SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, CCR-EXPANDED, IC and
A&HCI).
To ensure the quality of literature, letters, book reviews, and news is excluded from the
selection process. Finally, a total of 183 articles are included in the study. As shown in
Figure 1, 75 papers (35%) are included in the scientific conference database CPCI-S, and 68
papers (31%) are included in SCI-EXPANDED, which shows that conference literature is an
important part of the metaverse literature.
3.2 Research methods
Bibliometrix, a scientometric analysis tool, which developed based on R. It has gained the
attention of R language development enthusiasts around the world and is continuously
updated and maintained due to its full functionality, simplicity of operation, efficiency, open
sources and free of charge (Li et al., 2018). Therefore, the Bibliometrix toolkit is chosen to
analyze the literature data, and the specific literature data sample collection and research
process are shown in Figure 2. Firstly, a visual analysis is conducted to summarize the
characteristics of the metaverse literature by analyzing the number of domestic and foreign
literature issued, the scientific output of authors and collaborative relationships.
High-frequency keywords and research hotspots were summarized by a series of methods
such as keywords word frequency statistics, keywords co-occurrence and cluster analysis.
This study also sorts out the thematic evolutionary paths of the metaverse and obtains a
knowledge network of metaverse-related studies.

4. Research results
4.1 Descriptive statistical analysis of metaverse research
4.1.1 Analysis of the number of articles published.This section and the next two subsectionswill
give a three-fold answer to the first question RQ1 (Since the concept of metaverse was proposed,
what are the characteristics of the results in the field ofmetaverse?). The visualized results of the
annual number of 183 articles published are shown inFigure 3. Among the sample literature, the
earliest one was Kobryn’s “Architectural Patterns for Metamodeling: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
The UMLMetaverse” published in 2000 (Kobryn, 2000). Two classic games, Second Life (2003)
and Roblox (2004) reanimated the metaverse, with an article published every year from 2004 to
2007. In 2009, Bitcoin was officially born, and key technologies such as blockchain, which
symbolizes digital asset tokenization, emerged one after another (Hong et al., 2020), providing
technical support for the construction of the metaverse. Therefore, from 2008 to 2009, a total of
15metaverse-related articleswere published,whichwas the first research peak in themetaverse-
related field. Since then, the popularity of the metaverse has not decreased. Tron: Legacy
released in 2010 is extremely in line with people’s longing for the metaverse. Therefore, from
2010 to 2014, the number of publications related to themetaverse has beenmaintained at a high
level, during which a total of 38 relevant pieces of literature were published. In 2015, HTC Vive
was officially released onMWC2015, and the first year of VR came. The barrier between the real
world and the virtual world was broken so that the heat of the metaverse could continue.
In 2020, with the outbreak of COVID-19, people’s demand for online life scenes is getting
higher and higher, and the pace of development of the metaverse is further accelerating.
In 2021, a large amount of capital is pouring into themetaverse as technologies such as 5G, AI,

The current

metaverse
blockchain technology and VR/AR display technology are flourishing. In a short time, the
metaverse has attracted great attention. The number of metaverse-related articles published
every year has reached 16. The popularity has continued until 2022, with 65 related articles
published as of June 6. According to the current development trend, the heat of the metaverse
will continue and spread further.
According to the characteristics of the number of papers in the metaverse in each period, this
paper divides the development of the metaverse into three stages: The period from 2000 to 2007
was a period of low-yield exploration. At that time, the concept of metaverse had not yet emerged,
and the number of pieces of literature grew slowly, which did not attract much attention from
scholars. 2008–2019 was the embryonic stage of development. During this period, bitcoin,
blockchain and other technologies made breakthroughs. Besides, the number of metaverse
literature experienced several fluctuations and gradually showed a trend of steady increase. Since
2020, the concept of “metaverse” has attracted the attention of a large number of scholars, with a
total of 92 papers published, accounting for about 50% of the total number of papers published
from2000 to June 2022.Thenumber of papers published in the first threemonths of 2022 alonehas
exceeded that of any previous year. This phenomenon shows that although the research on the
metaverse is still in the initial development stage, it has showngreat potential for development and
will become the focus of academic circles in the next few years.
4.1.2 Analysis of authors in the field of the metaverse.
(1) Statistical analysis of the number of papers published by authors
A statistical analysis of the data derived fromWOS found that as ofMarch 2022, 451 authors had
published 183 papers in the field. Among them, Ayiter, Elif scholar ranked first with 6 articles
published. Ayiter mainly studied the influence of the metaverse on architecture and art. Inspired
by Second Life, Ayiter recreated El Lissitzky’s 1919 building “Proun #5A” in the metaverse
(Ayiter, 2014a, b). As a designer and artist (Ayiter, 2010), Ayiter also made various artistic
creations in the virtual environment and expounded their understanding of metaverse text and
metaverse printing, etc (Ayiter, 2012). In addition, 8 scholars including Barry, Fukumura and

Kanematsu have publishedmore than 3 papers.Meanwhile, Arroyo, Bourlakis and other scholars
have also become the top 10 authors in this field by publishing 2 papers.
(2) Authors collaboration analysis
In order to understand the achievements of academic exchanges and the general situation of
team cooperation in the field of themetaverse, co-occurrence analysis is also conducted on the
cooperative relationship between authors, as shown in Figure 4. The size of nodes represents
the number of authors’ publications and the same color represents an author cluster. We find
thatmost scholars choose cooperative output, but there are generally fewer internal members
in each academic team formed by cooperative output.
Further analysis of author clusters with a large number of publications and members in the
cooperative network shows that Barry, Fukumura, Kanematsu and other scholars have jointly
published 4 metaverse related articles, which is an important author cluster in this field at
present. Their research focuses on the application of the metaverse in the field of education.
They find that the emergence of the metaverse virtual world can improve students’ imagination
and creativity. The combination of ametaverse virtual classroom and a real classroom provides
new possibilities for STEM education (Kanematsu et al., 2014). In addition, the author cluster

composed of Conruyt, Noel, Sebastien, Didier and other scholars jointly published 3 metaverse
articles, which is the high-yield author cluster second only to Barry, DanaM and other scholars.
Its main research direction is the realization of biodiversity systems in the virtual world of the
metaverse. This author cluster studies the different possibilities that data representing
biodiversity in information systems can present in the metaverse (Sebastien et al., 2009a) and
proposes a new management component in biodiversity information systems (Sebastien et al.,
2009b). It enhances the public’s immersive experience in virtual environments.
4.1.3 Distribution of metaverse articles in space and domain. The distribution of existing
results on the metaverse from the spatial dimension is counted. The United States has the
largest number of relevant publications, reaching 52 papers, accounting formore than 20%of
the total. In addition, Korea and China havemore than 30 papers. Japan, the UK, France, Spain
and Brazil have more than ten publications. In addition to the above countries, 12 countries,
including Italy and Brazil, have published fewer than 10 papers. The total number of papers
published in these 12 countries only accounts for 29%of the total, indicating that the research
on the metaverse is still shallow in most regions or countries.
Following the analysis of the sources in the metaverse literature from the domain
dimension, a total of 73 different domains are covered in the 183 papers, and their distribution
conforms to the Pareto principle. Among them, the fields ranked at the top of the paper output
are 37 in Engineering, Electrical and Electronic, 42 in Computer Science, Theory and
Methods, 35 in Computer Science, Information Systems, 20 in Computer Science, Artificial
Intelligence, 19 in Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Application and 18 in Computer
Science, Software Engineering. Field distribution characteristics of the metaverse literature
indicate that the new generation of computer technology and Internet technology is the basis
for building the physical layer of themetaverse (Li, 2022). Current metaverse-related research
focuses on computer science.
4.2 Keywords analysis
Keywords are the author’s high-level summary of the content of the article, which has an
obvious indicating function and is an important analysis index of Scientometrics. Sorting
through the keywords of the 183 metaverse-related documents included in the study, the
results will answer the second question RQ2: What are the prospects for the metaverse
concept itself and its technological achievements in other fields of application?
4.2.1 High-frequency keywords analysis. The word cloud in Figure 5 shows the most
frequent keywords in the metaverse paper. The more frequently the keywords appear, the
larger the corresponding keyword labels. The frequency occurrence of keywords plays
a significant role inmeeting the study’s objectives. This analysis reveals the hotspot category
Figure 5.

LHT
and future developments of a discipline (Borgohain et al., 2022). From the chart, it is clear that
in addition to the metaverse, Second Life, Virtual Reality, Blockchain, E-learning and Art are
also high-frequency keywords. These themes occupy a crucial place in the field of the
metaverse. Second Life is an extremely social virtual environment developed by Linden Lab
at the beginning of the 21st century (Godfrey, 2008). The platform was a hit, allowing
researchers not only to conduct extensive academic research on it (Gajendra et al., 2012), but
also to raise the connection between users to a higher level. But for various reasons, the game
gradually faded from the public view. The rise and fall of Second Life have led to more
rational thinking about the development of the metaverse (Lee et al., 2022). Scholars hope to
further elucidate the concept of the metaverse and its implementation methods based on
interactive technologies such as Avatar and XR, Virtual world (Park and Kim, 2022) and
further enrich the metaverse by analyzing Blockchain, Smart control and other technologies
for settlement and control to further enrich the connotation of metaverse (Duguleana and
Girbacia, 2021). At the same time, industry and academia have actively sought creative
integration of metaverse with Creative Education, Urban Muralism, Cultural
Industrialization, Environmental Education and Language Learning (Yohan and Lee, 2022;
Jeon and Won, 2022; Doo, 2022; Kanematsu et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2019).
4.2.2 Keywords co-occurrence analysis.The co-word analysis method is based on the word
frequency analysis method, which mainly analyzes the phenomenon of keywords appearing
in the same literature to determine the relationship between topics in the subject area (Zhang
and Ma, 2007). In this paper, based on the study of posting number in the statistical
description of the first section, the metaverse’s development history is divided into the
following three phases: low-yield development stage (2000–2007), volatility rises phase
(2008–2019) and high-yield active phase (2020–2022). On this basis, the high-frequency
keywords matrix of each stage was constructed. The keywords matrix is visualized by
co-occurrence network analysis in Biblioshiny. The results are shown in Figures 6–8.
(1) Low-yield development stage (2000–2007)
Metaverse research was in its infancy at this time. Metaverse, virtual design teams, etc. are the
high-frequency keywords in this stage. During this period, metaverse research is very closely
related to games and education (Sidorko, 2009). In terms of conceptual exploration: with the rise of
games such as Second Life andWorld ofWarcraft, massivelymultiplayer online games have long
evolved into interactive paradigms for learning, simulation and digital design (Bardzell and
Figure 6.

Shankar, 2007). Scholars describe platforms such as Second Life as a constructivist learning
environment (Antonacci and Modaress, 2005), with the creativity to build immersive learning
environments (Hill and Lee, 2009). They were pioneers in the development of the concept of
metaverse (McArthur, 2007), prompting the concept of metaverse to enter the public domain. On
the implementation path: games such as Second Life have explored approaches to improve the
protection of user rights formetaverse (Cacciaguerra, 2006) and have proposed new ideas in terms
of the architecture of metaverse (Kobryn, 2000).
(2) Rising stage of fluctuation (2008–2019)
At this time, the research of themetaverse is in the development stage. Themetaverse, virtual
worlds, augmented reality, 3D and so on are the core keywords of the research at this stage.
The successful realization of 3D technology and the successful definition of the concept of the
virtual world become a new starting point for researchers to conceive the realization of the
metaverse (Dionisio et al., 2013). At the same time, products like Fortnite, Minecraft and
Roblox are blurring the line between games and social networks. The science fiction
metaverse is slowly becoming reality (Sweeney, 2019), as the metaverse merges with other
fields of knowledge. In the field of education: At this stage, metaverse has achieved
remarkable application achievements in history education and evaluation of students’
learning styles (Hun, 2017; Barry et al., 2015). In the field of retail: The metaverse has
promoted virtual retail into reality with stronger fun and more complete product inspection
procedures (Hassouneh and Brengman, 2015; Swilley, 2016).
(3) High-yield and active Stage (2020–2022)
During this period, the metaverse received unprecedented attention and the scientific output
of the academic circle also showed a blowout rise. The development path brought by

Blockchain, Smart Contract andother technologies and their products to themetaverse technology
has become a hot research topic at this stage. At the same time, the application of the metaverse
has also been expanded more widely. In the tourism industry, the “metaverse þ tourism” has
become a new topic in the field of tourism (Noh, 2022; Jun et al., 2021). In addition, the application of
themetaverse in urban digital diplomacy, real estate, advertising, product display and other fields
has brought new development opportunities for all industries (Mun, 2022; Rae, 2021; Park, 2021;
Xin, 2022). At the same time, the challenges brought by the development of the metaverse to
human society have also attracted people’s great attention. Legal and ethical issues have become
the issues that need to be addressed for the sustainable development of themetaverse (Wan, 2022).
Humans participate in social activities mainly through avatars on the metaverse platform with a
low degree of moral restraint. Therefore, some users damage the legal rights of others through
verbal or visual behaviors (Kang, 2022), posingagreat challenge to the construction of socialmoral
systems and laws.
To sum up, the co-citation network with the metaverse as the core is obtained by visual
analysis of the keywordsmatrix of themetaverse-related literature from 2000 to 2022, as shown
in Figure 9. Nodes that are highly related to the concept of the metaverse are as follows:
keywords in interactive technology such as virtualworlds, virtual reality and augmented reality;
computing technology such as blockchain and related games such as SecondLife. Technological
breakthroughs are the basis for the development of the metaverse, which can be either
integrated from independent virtual worlds (Dionisio et al., 2013) or implemented in the form of
blocks based on a decentralized blockchain point-to-point distribution model (Ryskeldiev et al.,
2018). Besides the breakthrough of visible technology, it still continuously provides a new path
for the realization of the metaverse and promotes the metaverse from theory to practice.

Themetaverse has been defined as a game-based learning platform, illustrating that large-scale
games provide new ideas for the integration of the metaverse with the education industry
(Getchell et al., 2010). Second Life games provide users with a platform for artistic creation and
commercial cooperation and also provide valuable experience for the expansion of the
application of the metaverse to the art and commercial fields.
4.2.3 Keywords cluster analysis. The hierarchical clustering method can detect data at
different granularity levels, and it is easy to realize similarity measurement or distance
measurement (Yang et al., 2021). In this paper, 183 metaverse literature are analyzed by
bottom-up condensed hierarchical clustering, and the tree diagram of each topic is obtained.
The results are shown in Figure 10 below. According to the distance between categories, this
paper divides keywords into three clusters. Since the concept of metaverse was proposed, the
trend of keywords clustering in its literature is as follows:
(1) Basic element cluster of the metaverse
The cluster contains keywords such as “3D”, “Avatar”, “Art”, “Presence”, etc. Metaverse has
basic elements such as a virtual avatar, 3D space and interactive accompanying activities
(Yang et al., 2021). Its combination with the art field crosses the boundary between the virtual
world and the real world, providing an opportunity for users to experience artistic creation.
Constructing a printing art ecosystem experienced through virtual avatars in the virtual
world, text can be felt as highly participatory art, rather than read as information content
(Ayiter, 2014a, b). The exhibition space built withmetaverse technology allows users to freely
build compositionmethods and forms according to the concept of the exhibition and provides

users with a personalized exhibition viewing experience based on existing exhibitions (Chun
and Yeo, 2022).
(2) Cluster of main research achievements of the metaverse
This collection is the largest cluster in the current metaverse literature, with “Metaverse”,
“Virtual world”, “Second life” and “E-Learning” as the core keywords. This cluster represents
the main research results in the metaverse field. As a platform for the integration of reality
and the virtual, the metaverse promotes the application and integration of politics, economy,
society, culture and other fields in the virtual world (Oh, 2021). At present, the application of
virtual reality is more and more widespread and has penetrated entertainment, education,
medical treatment, commerce and other fields. In the field of entertainment, influenced by the
second life, many players have jumped in. Some even quit their jobs in real society and focus
on creating wealth in the virtual world. In addition, many entertainment companies seek a
new path for the innovative development of the cultural and entertainment industry by
launching the combination of virtual characters and real characters (Kim and Jinyun, 2021).
In the field of education, virtual reality, as a new teaching medium, can fully reflect the
situational and interactive nature of the teaching process and improve the teaching effect
(Zhao et al., 2009). Especially in medical education, the research on virtual teaching is a
current research hotspot that has a wide range of application prospects (Yang, 2016).
(3) Basic cluster of metaverse technology
In recent years, the keywords represented by “Blockchain”, “Nonfungible token” and
“Artificial intelligence” constitute the basic cluster of metaverse technology. Among them
blockchain plays a great role in the circulation and sharing of metaverse data with its
characteristics of decentralized trust mechanism, non-tamperability and traceability (Zhu
and Xu, 2021); Based on big data, deep learning and arithmetic power, artificial intelligence
has been relativelymature in the application of speech recognition, face recognition and other
technologies. At present, it is changing to complex tasks such as logical reasoning and
domain migration. These breakthroughs in the key technologies of the metaverse have

4.3 Theme evolution analysis
This section will build on the above analysis to provide an answer to RQ3: How have the
research hotspots in the field of metaverse changed since 2000, and what are the implications
for future research? To ensure the scientific validity of the subject terms, this paper analyzes
the evolution of the research themes in the metaverse-related literature from 2000 to 2022 in
chronological order. In this procedure, the evolution process of the metaverse topic is divided
into three stages: from 2000 to 2010, from 2011 to 2019 and from 2020 to 2022. The research
keywords for each stage are analyzed, and the thematic evolution path is visualized.
The results are shown in Figure 11 below.
According to the number of connections and the size of nodes, we find that there are great
differences in the research topics of the metaverse in each period, and the evolution path is
clear. The obvious themes in evolution paths are:
(1) “Second life” → “Metaverse” theme evolution path
The core theme of each stage is used as the main path to construct a relationship network,
with the core path nodes at a distance of less than 2, as shown in Figure 12 below. In the first
stage, the path takes “second life” as the core theme and the keywords directly connectedwith
it are virtual reality and metaverse. Based on second life, virtual reality can be defined as a
computer-based simulation environment where users can live and interact with others
(Kumar et al., 2008), which further explains the essence of the virtual world. At the same time,
by discussing the business opportunities and challenges of second life, we can further
determine the systematic problems that need to be solved for the development of the
metaverse (Papagiannidis et al., 2008) and effectively promote the development of the virtual
world and the metaverse. The core theme of this path was transformed into virtual world.
In the second stage, the path has “virtual worlds” as its core theme, which is directly linked to
keywords such as art, 3D, Second Life, etc. and fromwhichmany branches have been derived,
such as metaverse retail, open simulators, etc (Bourlakis et al., 2009; Crespo et al., 2013).
At this stage, the related technologies of virtual world developed rapidly (Wang et al., 2017)
and were widely used in architectural education, autism treatment and so on (Pak et al., 2012;
Figure 11.
Theme evolution map
LHT
Stendal and Balandin, 2015). With the wider range of applications for virtual world, it has
become a new challenge for virtual world development to move from a complex but
completely separate set of immersive environments to a large integrated network of 3D
virtual world or metaverse. The core theme of the path shifted from the virtual world to the
metaverse. The third stage is the evolution stagewith themetaverse as the core theme. At this
stage, the research on the metaverse is more comprehensive. The keywords directly
connected with the metaverse include deep learning, extended reality, virtual reality, solid-
state mode, game console and have also been extended to gamification experiences, aircraft
maintenance education and other experimental branches that span a wide range of fields
(Park et al., 2021; Siyaev and Jo, 2021). This evolutionary path, starting from the second life,
constantly explores the metaverse, enriching the specific forms of the metaverse. In the
future, research into the idea of the metaverse as a whole will continue to receive a lot of
attention.
(2) “Metaverse” → “Metaverse” theme evolution path
This evolutionary path differs significantly from the other two. As can be seen from
Figure 13, the core theme of all three stages of this path is the metaverse, so this path can
reflect the specific development of themetaverse at each stage. In the first stage, there are four
keywords directly connected with the metaverse, such as 3D, virtual world, virtual body and
second life, and there are no other extended branches, which show that the research related to
the metaverse at this stage has the characteristics of small scope and narrow research
direction. 3D, virtual worlds and other technologies are the basis for the realization and
development of the metaverse. The combination of 3D technology and web-based systems

The current

provides an extensible learning framework for Metaverse (Marmaridis and Griffith, 2009),
and its integration with social networks also greatly promotes the anthropomorphic process
of Metaverse elements (Arroyo et al., 2009). And virtual world and virtual avatar are the
foundation of metaverse research (Davis et al., 2009). In the second stage, the keywords
directly linked to the metaverse became five, such as online learning, 3D, art, virtual worlds
and Second Life. It can be seen that the research scope of the metaverse, in addition to the
original Second Life and virtual worlds, has also produced creative integration of disciplines
with the arts and online education by saving resources and other advantages (Estudante and
Dietrich, 2020). As can be seen from Figure 11 above, in the third stage, the research focus of
this pathway tends to be consistent with the evolutionary pathway that starts with Second
Life, with the same core themes, directly connected keywords, evolutionary branches and
other features. The research related to the rich metaverse system will continue to receive the
attention of many scholars in the future.
(3) “Metaverse” → “Blockchain” theme evolution path
As can be seen from Figure 11 above, this path and the previous “metaverse”→ “metaverse”
both evolve from themetaverse as the starting point, so its first stage evolutionary state is the
same as the previous path. The continuous development of mixed reality at this time provides
a new path for the development and application of metaverse. As can be seen in Figure 14,
in the second stage the central theme of the path evolved into mixed reality, with telepresence
as the only keyword directly linked to it, which shows the evolution of the research theme of
the metaverse toward technological exploration. Mixed reality aims to make real objects
interact with 3D digital content and increase mutual understanding by mixing the physical
world and the virtual world (Zhang et al., 2022). At present, mixed reality has been widely
used in medicine (Balci et al., 2022; Ogunseiju et al., 2022), education and other fields. Its
application in social media provides a feasible path for the realization of metaverse.
By studying the mixed reality interfaces of emerging social platforms, it is possible to
summarize a series of metaverse qualitative principles that contribute significantly to the
development of the metaverse (Prieto et al., 2022). Meanwhile, with the establishment of
“Ethereum”, blockchain development has entered the 2.0 era. Its features such as
decentralization, transaction accountability and smart contract-based automation provide
a new framework for the construction of metaverse applications (Li et al., 2021; Nguyen et al.,
2022). In the third stage, the research theme of this path evolved into the blockchain, and the
keywords directly linked to it are superconducting fibers, NFT, smart contracts, supply chain
and distributed ledger technology. Blockchain has brought a revolution in many fields, such
as Finance, Healthcare, Supply chain, Insurance and Internet of Things (Sanka et al., 2021). Its
combination with the game industry has given birth to Metaverse (Vidal-Tom�as, 2022).
At this stage, the technical characteristics of keywords directly related to the core topic are
Figure 14.

obvious. It can be seen that as technology continues to improve and breakthroughs are made
in technologies such as blockchain, the technical nature of metaverse-related research
continues to increase. With the accelerated integration of the metaverse with various
industries, the importance ofmetaverse-related technologies will further increase and become
a key research direction for metaverse research along with metaverse concept research.
As an emerging concept, the research theme has evolved from games such as second life
and the metaverse concept itself to the cross-fertilization of blockchain, augmented reality
and other technologies with the metaverse and the further enrichment of the metaverse
concept. It is thus predicted that in the future, scholars will further enrich the metaverse
theory system in three directions, including the realization of the metaverse and related
technological development, the cross-fertilization of metaverse concepts with various
disciplines and the analysis of the pros and cons of metaverse development.
5. Discussion
With the development of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, wireless
communication networks and other related technologies (Wang, 2022a), the metaverse has
broken the boundary between reality and virtual reality, bringing new possibilities for social
networking, entertainment and work. Taking the metaverse literature in the WOS core
database since 2000 as the research object, this paper makes a systematic quantitative
analysis of the research results in the field of the metaverse, summarizes the output and
research hotspots of scientific research in the field of metaverse at each stage from the
perspective of time sequence, combs the evolution path of the metaverse. Finally, this paper
predicts the future research trend in this field.
The research results show that since the advent of the concept of the metaverse, the annual
number of literature issued has shown a fluctuating upward trend. Affected by capital, epidemic
and other factors, the research results of metaverse sharply increased in 2021. However, the total
amount of metaverse literature is low, and a complete theoretical system has not yet been formed.
By analyzing the characteristics of metaverse literature, it is found that the current metaverse-
related research has unbalanced characteristics in both spatial and domain dimensions. In the
space dimension, the research on metaverse is mainly concentrated in the United States, China,
Japan and other countries, while the research on metaverse in Italy, Brazil and other countries is
still lacking and has not yet formed a global research scale. In the field dimension, most of the
current research is still focused on technical fields such as electronic engineering and computer
science. Among them, the creative integration of AR and other related technologies with mobile
learning, museum exhibition and other fields has also shown remarkable results such as
improving students’ learning enthusiasm (Li and Liu, 2022), enhancing teaching quality and
increasing the return visit rate of museums (Dalili Saleh et al., 2022). On the whole, however, the
integration of metaverse and traditional fields such as manufacturing is still very limited.
Therefore, although the number of literature published in the metaverse has increased by leaps
and bounds since 2021, relevant research and development are still in their infancy.
At the same time, games such as second life andmy world shorten the distance between the
real world and the virtual world, providing awindow for the public to experience themetaverse.
Second life provides a new virtual world for themajority of players, where players can socialize,
shop and even do business. The sense of experience derived from life haswon the favor ofmany
users. The game provides a practical reference for how to better create a metaverse mechanism.
Inmyworld, players can create in a sandbox andbuild their ideal world online. Thismechanism
refines the scene of themetaverse and opens the door to people’s imaginations of the metaverse.
Therefore, the introduction of games such as second life lays a foundation for people to
understand and accept the metaverse and also provides a reliable way to visualize the
metaverse, which is of great significance to the development of the metaverse.
The current
status of
metaverse
At present, the research direction of the metaverse is gradually focusing on blockchain,
virtual reality, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other technologies. These
technologies have high research potential and are expected to become the main research
direction of the metaverse in the next few years. Since the 21st century, the pace of
information technology reform has been accelerating. Cloud computing, big data, artificial
intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality and other technologies have been emerging.
Therefore, mankind has entered the era of big data. However, this series of new
information technologies have only solved the problems in a certain field of the
information world. No information technology can fully depict the whole information
world (Huang and Cao, 2022). The metaverse started with the game platform and is based on
digital currency. It integrates all kinds of existing new information technologies to form an
information technology whole and uniformly depicts the future new information world, that
is, the metaverse integrates many information technologies into a whole. Therefore, these
basic technologies are not only supported for the development of the metaverse but also the
fundamental driving force for the development of the metaverse at this stage.
6. Conclusion and implication
6.1 Conclusion
On the whole, this paper makes a systematic quantitative analysis of the research results of
metaverse It finds that the field of metaverse has not yet formed a complete theoretical system.
Therefore, it is still in its infancy. There are unbalanced characteristics in both spatial dimension
and domain dimension. In addition, the application of the metaverse is also very limited. It is
found that most metaverse studies are related to the application in tertiary industries such as
museum services (Hsu and Liang, 2022), education (Li and Liu, 2022) and medical services
(Naveh and Bronstein, 2019), while only a few studies have found applications in other related
fields such as industrial production and information systems. As an emerging concept, the
metaverse formed its ownunique evaluation path aftermore than ten years of development. The
visualization results show that the themes ofmetaverse research in each period are significantly
different and have clear evolution paths. Scholars have gradually made the transition from
focusing on the concept of metaverse itself to information technology. The current industry and
academia are focusing on blockchain, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
and other technologies. And they have started to try to integrate themetaverse with other fields
to continuously promote the development of metaverse. Therefore, improving the conceptual
system of the metaverse, expanding the application environment of the metaverse and
constantly optimizing the basic technology of the metaverse are the research priorities in the
field of the metaverse in the future.
In addition, this study has some limitations: (1) In this study, the keywords “metaverse” and
“Non-Fungible Token” are used to search the sample literature, not considering that the articles on
the topics of augmented reality and virtual reality also contain a lot of metaverse ideas. (2) The
source of the article sample isWoS, while Google Scholar or Scopus databases are not included. In
future work, we will start by adding literature search keywords and expanding literature sources
to conduct a more systematic quantitative study of metaverse-related research results.
6.2 Implication
The next stage of development of the metaverse is to reconstruct the social, consumption
and other aspects of reality in the digital world, which will bring great changes to various
industries and also bring many potential risks to the economic, political, cultural, social,
ecological and other fields (Wei and Su, 2022). To avoid themetaverse causing human beings to
fall into a long virtualization trap (He, 2022), the builders of the metaverse, the government, the
LHT
participants of the metaverse and other parties should use a more objective and rational
perspective to look at the explosion of themetaverse and its impact on the future. The builders of
the metaverse should abandon blind competition and be blindly radical. Focus on eliminating
the digital divide, guaranteeing the information fairness of information human rights and
information technology under centralized technology governance and creating ametaverse that
truly benefits mankind (Xu et al., 2022). The government should grasp the boundaries of the
development of the metaverse from three aspects: legal regulations, scientific and technological
regulations and educational regulations (Zhao andLu, 2022).While avoiding the dominance of a
platform or a country in the metaverse field, we should strengthen the self-discipline of the
metaverse industrywith amore complete legal system and strictermoral standards. In addition,
all participants in the metaverse platform should balance the relationship between the virtual
world and the real world and embed the metaverse in the real society to avoid being divorced
from reality. Delineating the boundaries of development is the basis for the development of
many new things. Metaverse is no exception. In the future, with the improvement of various
systems and laws, the realization of the metaverse may open the full truth era of the internet.
