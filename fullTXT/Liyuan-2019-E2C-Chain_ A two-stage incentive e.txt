Abstract—Employment and workforce industry become more
important because the human capital value is linked to the
company’s profitability. Company becomes employee-centric in
the 21st century. To hire an appropriate employee, and reduce
hiring liability workplace violence, background screening mar-
keting growth quickly. However, in the human resource industry,
background check still is a pain point, especially for employment,
education, and skill verification. The traditional background
check is prolonged and inaccurate. For overseas recruitment,
background check will be more troublesome. This paper compre-
hensively addresses the above issues by proposing an innovation
E2C-Chain, a two-stage blockchain-based education, employment
and skill certification system. In the first stage, the new blocks
are created when a trust organization verifies the education and
employment information of the employee. In the second stage,
to encourage the verifiers to participate in the skill verification
process, we employ a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game based
incentive mechanism to find the Nash Equilibrium and ensure
social cost minimization. We also present the theoretical proofs
and extensive simulations to demonstrate beneficial properties
and efficiency of our proposed system.

I. INTRODUCTION
Businesses meet a significant hurdle in recruitment when
they need to verify candidates’ credentials, such as employ-
ment, education, and skills. They keep spending a lot of money
on the employee’s background check to the third parties.
Regarding the ResearchAndMarkets’s report, the employment
screening services market is supposed to increase from $3.74
billion to $5.46 billion by 2025 [1]. Even though the em-
ployment screening market boosting recently, there still exist
fraud and opacity in employee credentials. According to the
survey of HireRight, 88% employers misrepresentation their
credentials on the resume [2]. The duplicity resume will result
in altered recruitment. With the report from CareerBuilder [3],
there is 75% of employers affirmed that they had recruited
inappropriate employees, the average cost of one unseemly
hiring is around $17,000. The mistake of hiring is a cost not
only the monetary loss of employers but also lost the time and
human resource to re-hire and re-training a new candidate, and
neutralizing the employees’ morale.
Education, employment, criminal, and credit score et al.

ployers are considered. Figure 1 shows the percentage of

these features in background screening, the data collected from
CareerBuilder’s report released in 2016 [3]. The top 5 check
credentials are criminal, employment, identity, education, and
drug usage. Among these, criminal and identity have the
national databases that employers can retrieve the truthful
information. Drug usage report usually issued by clinical
organizations which also ensure authenticity. Moreover, with
the credit bureaus reports, the credit information also is easy
to reach out. However, how to guarantee the authenticity of
education and employment information is the most significant
challenge to employers. Also, because the third party back-
ground screening is time-consuming, the waiting period is
another potential reason that results in employers lost great
talents. Besides, skill verification is another unproven part of
resume. Employers are hard to confirm the skills which em-
ployees claimed they have. Blockchain, as a distributed, digi-
tized, secure, open record of all cryptographic data exchange
technology start to change the world in many fields [4]. Since
use blockchain, participates can verify the transactions without
a central certifying authorization. It has implied for many
industries which rely on the record, store and track transactions
secure, accurate, and unmodifiable. It can changed supply
chain [5], healthcare [6], Internet of Things [7], agriculture
[8] et al. Similar, in the business recruitment, the truthful of
candidates’ education, employment, and skills information are

very important, the information asymmetry between employee
and employer will cause not only a financial problem but
also time cost, social trust, and other problems. Therefore,
this motivated us to propose the blockchain based education
employment and skill certification framework: E2C-Chain.
The general idea of E2C-Chain is to use blockchain tech-
nology to record features of professional accomplishment,
expert skills or education and employment certification on the
distributed ledger.
However, we confront several challenges.
• To our best knowledge, the blockchain based education
employment and skill verification still be an open ques-
tion from now.
• In the second stage, how to encourage the participants to
verify others’ skill is another question. The cost of each
participant for completing a skill verify is private. It is
challenging to encourage all verifier to describe their real
costs.
• It is hard to choose the optimal set of participants that
minimize the cost of requesters. The incentive mechanism
needs to be established in the peer-to-peer verify process
Therefore, to overcome the challenges, we proposed a two-
stage blockchain system. In the first stage, we focus on intro-
ducing a framework that can store employees’ education and
employment experience permanently. When the universities,
enterprises issue the proof to employees’ employment and
education record, a new transaction is created. In the second
stage, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) is implemented to
encourage the participants to verify the requesters’ proposed
expert skills. With the mechanism, we prove that our proposed
mechanism is individually rational and truthfulness and com-
putation efficiency. The details of the two-stage E2C-Chain are
displayed in Figure 2. Our contributions are concluded below:
• E2C-Chain provides a trusted source of employees’ infor-
mation that is not modifiable and permanently. It offers
more immutable, fair, trust, and direct pathway between
employers and employees.
• We implement a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game to
find the equilibrium that verifiers in the second stage
can bid their reward price and reach the social cost
minimization.
• Our E2C-Chain is a secure and incentive chain that pro-
tects all nodes’ private information. With zero knowledge
proof(ZK-SNARK), the task can be complete without
disclosing any information beyond the validity of the
statement itself.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the related works of different technologies. The
architecture and overview of the E2C-Chain are presented in
Section III. Section IV formulates the incentive mechanism
and provides theoretical investigation. Section V displays ex-
perimental results of the two-stage E2C-Chain. Lastly, Section
VIconcludes the study.

II. RELATED WORK
A. Education Employment and Skill Blockchain
There are three main contents in each blockchain: the
previous block hash, the transaction data, and the timestamp.
Blockchain is an append-only transaction ledger. The function
of every ledger is to store and write new information in it.
Recently, there are many researchers focus on blockchain.
There are several different domains, such as Internet of
Things(IoT) [9], [10], cyber-physical systems [11], education
[4], supply chain management [12], and crowdsourcing and
crowdsensing [13], etc. It is evident that the characteristics
of blockchain, such as non-modifiable, anonymity, security,
can revolute employment market fairer, more efficiency, and
universal. However, there are not abundant research focus on
human research industry.
The most famous application of blockchain is Bitcoin.
Nakamoto [14] proposed a peer to peer electronic cash system-
Bitcoin on 2008. In their system, the network timestamps
transaction will be hashed by SHA-256 based on PoW, and
then the miners will solve the mathematically hash to get a
reward.
Regarding recent research, most education, employment,
and skill certification based blockchain research are in the
initial step. This problem still is an open question from now.
Turkanovic et al. [15] proposed a framework called “EduCTX”
which is a novel blockchain-based higher education credit
platform. They also performed the implementation of the
model using the Ark Blockchain Platform. Grather et al.
[16] also presented a blockchain-based education platform to
issue the education certificates for students. They defined their
system overview in their paper, and illustrate the implementa-
tion details includes certification authorities management and
smart contract. Chen [17] introduced his blockchain based

system and named “Echo”. He illustrated that using Echo,
the employment information such as skill, and career can be
verified. Pinna et al. [18] proposed a system using blockchain
to protect temporary employment’ right. In their system,
the employees will get fair and legal payout regarding their
work performance. And this system also can help employers
automatically manage the contracts through smart contract.
However, most of them are not illustrate how to encourage
peer-to-peer verification in their system.
B. VCG and Blockchain
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is a mechanism
that is truthful and enables to assist in accomplishing a
social welfare maximization solution. Several studies employ
VCG in a blockchain environment. Most of them are focus
on the computation resource allocation between miners and
edge service providers. Jiao et al. [19] deployed an auc-
tion game between edge computing service provider and the
miner who need the computation resources. With their auction
mechanism, it can optimize the social welfare; at the same
time, it can guarantee the individual rational, truthfulness, and
computation efficiency of authors proposed method. Gu et al.
[20] implemented a VCG auction mechanism to solve the
storage transactions problem. They perform their model using
the Ethereum platform, and the experimental results showed
their method could construct a safe, efficient, and economic
resource trading.
At the time we write this paper, to our best knowledge, there
are a few blockchain incentive mechanisms use VCG to reward
the verifiers. VCG is frequently used in edge computing,
wireless networks, crowdsourcing, and crowdsensing domains
etc. Li et al. [21] formulate the offloading games for the mo-
bile edge computing environment. With the optimal incentive
scheme, when the users’ experience, the process of decision
making will reach the equilibrium that social welfare will be
maximization incorporate with VCG. Li et al. [22] employed
VCG in their research in the mobile crowdsensing field. They
proposed the algorithms theoretically to help the platform
more efficient and beneficial to seek the participates. Zhou et
al. [23] proposed a new framework in the crowdsensing area.
They used VCG to reward the participators, implemented the
edge computing to reduce the high computation traffic and
burden, suggested incorporate with deep learning algorithms,
such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to filter the
fake and unrelative information which selfish participates
offered. With the case study, their framework can reach high
robustness.
C. Privacy-Preserving in Blockchain
Since most blockchains are stored sensitive, valuable
records, how to make a secure blockchain system will be one
crucial research area. There are many researchers focus on
designed privacy-preserving algorithms to protect the transac-
tion data. Kosba et al. [24] introduced a novel method called
“Hawk”, which is a smart contract system that decentralized,
the transactions data will not be stored in the appearance on
the blockchain, it will create a private smart contract and use
RSA to make sure the data is cryptography and security. Lu et
al. [25] presented a novel privacy-preserving network named
“CreditCoin” in the IoT environment. With their blockchain-
based incentive mechanism, the announcement network will
be efficient anonymous the vehicular’s announcement protocol.
Yue et al. [26] developed a novel APP named Healthcare Data
Gateway that enables to store, control and share the patient
data since the patients’ data are sensitive, they provided a
new method to protect the data private. Recently, the zero-
knowledge proof is modern cryptography in blockchain. For
example, Lu et al. [27] proposed a private and anonymous
decentralized crowdsourcing system named ZebraLancer. This
system is atop an open blockchain that can prevent data breach.
III. ARCHITECTURE OF E2C-CHAIN
There are six main components in E2C-Chain.
• Nodes: Users in the E2C-Chain.
• Transaction: A certification request is broadcast to the
network and collected into the blocks.
• Block: Blocks are files where the employment, education
and skill certification recorded permanently in the E2C-
Chain network.
• Chain: A list of certification blocks in a particular order.
• Miners: The particular nodes which solve the hashed
puzzles, and help to affirm a new block and add to
blockchain.
• Consensus: A set of mechanisms and systems to make
sure blockchain works. We implement Proof of Work
(PoW) in this study.
In the first stage, as Figure 2 shows, employees input their
education and employment information, the system rewards
several E2C-coins to the employees regarding their completion
of the information. Also, the system will give each user an
effective weight score to represent his or her weight when
they participate in the skill verification in the second stage.
Some trust organizations, such as universities, online schools,
employers issue proofs of employees about their employment
and education information can also get the E2C-coins reward.
The system enables to require the trust organizations make
the official email and documents confirmation when they sign
up to make sure the trust organizations are guaranteed. Then a
new transaction is created. The transaction will generate a hash
with SHA-256 algorithm. The creator of the new block will be
the first miner that solved the hash function. In the verification
process, ZK-SNARK is employed to protect sensitive data. The
trust record will be stored to the new block without revealing
that information, and without any interaction between the
prover and verifier.
After the education and employment certification stored
in the blockchain, it will be unmodifiable, permanently and
trustful.
In the second stage, an auction is employed using VCG
algorithm. The description of the incentive mechanism process
can be implemented as follow:

• When the users upload their personal information to
the system, the system assigns an amount of E2C-coins
regarding their profile completeness.
• The employees decide several skills need to be verified
and then publish the price of each skill they willing to pay
to the verifiers. As same as the first stage, ZK-SNARK
will be implemented to protect data privacy.
• Every skill s has its price p decide by the requester.
Based on the VCG model, a set of winners will be
selected and the payment will be decided. Each verifier
has a sufficient weight represents their weight. When the
sum of all winners’ weight reach a qualifying score, the
skill verification process complete, and the record can be
stored to a new block. After each success verification, the
weight of verifiers will be increase regarding their past
performance.
In this study, ZK-SNARK is a technique to protect sensitive
data. ZK-SNARK is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof.
With ZK-SNARK, the duplicated interaction is not required
between requester and verifier; it enables to present sound-
proof. Each user has a public key Puk, and a private key
denotes to Prk. The Puk as a user’s encrypted information,
and no other party knows the user’s identifications. The user
could send a concatenation of the encrypted information Ω;
the concatenation can be denoted as CPrk(Ω) and is sent
to the miners. The miners can confirm if the user’s input
information is authentic by decrypting CPrk(Ω) with the user’s
public key. However, the users’ are anonymous, and the
miners cannot know any identity information of users [28].
Figure 3 shows the process of ZK-SNARK. The verifiers and
the provers can easily verify and complete the verification
process, protect the completeness of computation, and keep
the sensitive employment and education records secure. More
details of the auction formulation will be introduced in Section
IV.
IV. INCENTIVE MECHANISM OF PEER-TO-PEER SKILL
VERIFICATION
An incentive blockchain mechanism can attract participants
to verify the skills of requesters, and to help requester achieve
skill certification as soon as possible. Therefore, how to
design the reward system to encourage participants will be

an interesting problem. In this study, we employed a game
theory algorithm VCG to encourage verifiers bid truthfully,
rationally and computation efficiency. Table I illustrates the

NOTATIONS AND DESCRIPTION
We consider employee ξ has a set of S={s1, s2, s3, ...,
si} proposed skills, each skill need to be verified by a set of
verifiers V={ν1, ν2, ν3, ..., νi} while i=NV . For each skill si,
there exist a description of si such as “Programming C++”,
“Data Analytics” defined as si={Ds}. When the employee or
certification requester posts skills, the system will send the
notifications for each verifier. The verifier has his effective
weight score of ωi, which represent the verify weight in the
verification process. The effective weight score will decide
by many factors such as the verifier’s age, education level,
job title, relationship with a requester, etc. A deep neural
network can achieve a weighted score that when the users input
their information, the platform enables to predict a reasonable
143

weight score to each user. β is employed to decide if the skill
verification is qualified to store in a new block. If si can be
added in the blockchain will decide by:∑
νi∈Ws
ωi ≥ β (1)
When the verifiers received the tasks, the verifiers who
willing to participate will prepare the bid price, ∀{νi} ∈ Vs,
the bid of νi denotes as bi. Regarding VCG model, a set of
winners Ws={W1,W2,W3, ...,Wj} will be selected to finish
the verification, the number of winners defined as j = Nw. The
total payment cannot exceed the budget of requesters planned
for each skill verification task; it can be defined as equation
2. ∑
νi∈Ws
ρi ≤ Bs, (2)
The utility of verifier will be maximized in the auction process.
The utility can be defined as:
Ui =
{
ρi − ζi, if νi ∈Ws for si.
0, otherwise.
(3)
A. Desirable Properties
When we design the incentive mechanism to encourage
verifiers to participate and finish the verification process, we
describe three desirable properties as following:
• Truthfulness: It is truthful that in an auction mechanism
every verifier ξ reports the true cost ζtrue. The verifier’s
utility Ui will not be improved when they report the cost
is different from his true value, denotes as ζfalse.
• Individual Rationality: Each verifier will get a non-
negative utility when he bid the true cost ζtrue, Ui ≥ 0,
∀i ∈ U .
• Computational Efficiency: The incentive mechanism will
be computationally efficient if the outcome can be com-
puted in polynomial time.
According to the previous research [29]–[31], we get some
definitions as following:
Definition 1: Monotonicity The verifier winner selection
process is monotone. The winner selected with bid price γ∗S
and S∗ will still win γ′s and S′ with any γ∗s ≥ γ′s, S∗ ≤ S′.
Definition 2: Critical payment There has a critical pay-
ment ρci for the winning verifier νi that claim his bid price γs
individually. νi will win if γ′s ≤ ρci, otherwise he will lose.
Theorem 1: An auction mechanism will be truthful if and
only if it satisfies monotonicity and existing a critical payment.
B. Optimal Social Cost Solution
In our second stage, to encourage more and more verifiers
to participate in the verification is crucial. In the meantime, it
is essential that minimizing the social cost when the requester
rewards the winning verifier. Our objective function that each
skill si, the formulation can be defined as following:
min
∑
νi∈Ws
ζi
s.t.
∑
νi∈Ws
ωi ≥ β
∑
νi∈Ws
ρi ≤ Bs
Ws ⊆ Vs
(4)
It had been proven that VCG mechanisms are truthfulness
and individual rationality [32]. According to the VCG algo-
rithm, the each winner’s payment ρi will be the difference
between the total cost for the other when verifier i is not
participating and the total cost for the others when verifier
i joins. It can be defined as:
ρi =
∑
νj �=νi
ζj(W
∗
−i)−
∑
νj �=νi
ζj(W
∗
i ) (5)
The set of winning verifiers selection process and the price
determination process of the skill verification also follow
the VCG mechanism. Algorithm 2 shows the process of the
winning verifiers’ selection. For each skill, each verifier νi has
similar cost ζi, sort ζi ascendingly, the set of the winner will
be the verifiers with the smallest cost while the sum of all
the costs less than requesters’ total budget. The algorithm 3

shows the determination of verification price for each skill
verification task. The price determination is following the
VCG-based Mechanism. It will return a set of payment for
each verifer of skill verificaton task si.
C. Proof of Designed properties
In this section, we present the proofs of designed properties
which are truthfulness, individual rationality, and computation
efficiency. We first present the proof of definition 1 and show
that the winner selection process is monotonic.
Proof: Let νi denotes as one winner of the winning
verifiers set when verifying the skill si; the cost is ζi. When
the νi bidding as ζ∗i , and ζ∗i ≤ ζi, regarding Algorithm 2
line 2-9, when sort all the verifier νi with their ζi, νi will be

selected in advance with bidding price ζ∗i . νi will always win
if his or her bidding with ζ∗i ≤ ζi with skill task si. Therefore,
the winner selection process is monotonic.
As we mentioned above, there existing a critical payment
ρci for the winning verifier νi that claim his bid price γs
individually.
Proof: Suppose the critical payment ρci for each verifier
νi and skill task si is equal to the critical cost ζci. If the verifier
nui bidding with a cost ζ∗i > zetaci, regarding to Algorithm
3 line1 and line4, the payment ζi∗ > ζj since all the cost will
be sorted in the beginning. Therefore, in the sorted list, the
index of verifier νi is behind νj . The verifier νi will not be
the winner.
Theorem 2: Our proposed skill verification system is truth-
ful.
Proof: Regarding theorem 1, our proposed mechanism
will be truthful if and only if it satisfies monotonicity and
existing a critical payment. We have proven for any si, the
winner nui will always win if he or she bid with ζ∗i ≤ ζi.
Also, we proven that there exist a critical payment ρci for
each verifier νi in definition 2. Therefore, theorem 2 can be
proven.
Theorem 3: Our proposed skill verification system is indi-
vidual rational.
Proof: For each verifier νi, there existing a critical cost
ζci which equal their payment ρi. A verifier’s utility will be
non-nagetive when νi is selected as a winner, there must have
ζi ≤ ζci. Otherwise, the utility of verifier will be 0. Theorem 3
can be proven because the individual rationality is guaranteed.
Theorem 4: Our proposed skill verification system is com-
putation efficiency.
Proof: The time complexity of Algorithm and algorithm
are O(n) which indicates the implementation time complexity
of our proposed skill verification mechanism is adequate.
V. EXPERIMENTS RESULTS
A. Incentive Mechanism
In order to evaluate the performance of the second stage
incentive auction mechanism, we simulate random numbers
of some variables and test it. The limited qualify score
fixed as β ∈ {50, 60, 70}, The number of verifiers fixed
as NV ∈ {40, 60, 80, 100}. The cost of each verifier ζi is
distributed over [1,50] uniformly and the effective weight
ωi is randomly chosen from [1,5].The verifiers’ asking price
γi is set from [1,30]. We first compare the social cost of
different verifier numbers by β as Figure 4 shown. From
Figure 4. The Social Cost of Different Number of Verifiers
this figure, we observed that the social cost will decrease
with the increase number of verifiers. The higher β value,
higher social cost. Figure 5 shows the relationship between
the number of winners and the β score by different numbers
of the verifier. It shows when β value gets high and there
doesn’t have enough verifiers, all the verifiers can be the
winner but the skill certification cannot be issued since the
sum of winners’ effective weight wouldn’t reach the qualifying
score β. We also test the utilities of winning verifiers using our
Figure 5. The Winners Number of Different Qualifying Score β
proposed VCG-based skill verification model. We randomly
choose two winning verifiers defined as “Random Verifier 1”
and “Random Verifier 2”. The utility of random verifier 1
shows as Figure 6, the true cost of random verifier 1 is ζrv1=5.
If the verifier asks truthful price which is 5, he will get the
optimal utility 5. However, if he overbids greater than 10,
he will not be selected, and his utility is 0. The true cost of
random verifier 2 ζrv2=2. If the verifier asks price truthfully for
2, he will reach the optimal utility which is 7. If he overbids

a value greater than 8, then he will not be selected, and his
utility will drop to 0.

B. Implementation and Evaluation of E2C-Chain
We initial implement the proof of concept our first stage
verification E2C-Chain. We simulate pairwise transactions
with a local implementation of blockchain. The simulations
are running on a MacOS of 1.6GHz Intel Core i5. We first
initialized the wallets and then generated transactions. The
transactions are included organization, employee, and infor-
mation. We also use PoW in our blockchain. The difficulty of
the SHA256 set as “2” which is easy. The miners allow to
solve the function and earn the reward. We also create Flask
API to maintain blockchain nodes. Figure 8 shows the API of
E2C-Chain with several example transactions.
Figure 8. E2C-Chain API Screen
Because the peer-to-peer architecture for our proposed
E2C-Chain, DoS attacks apt to less compared with traditional
solutions. The system permission system if a node has inad-
equate behavior, he will be forbidden to access the network.
This process also can handle Sybil attacks. Furthermore, data
encryption will also protect sensitive individual information.
We also show the simulate time assumption of from 1 to 500
transactions in Figure 9.
We also increase the difficulty of SHA256, the time of
one transaction increase significantly as Figure 10 shown.
Figure 11 shows the times of transaction encryption with
500 transactions. We test different hash function with 500
transactions and the running time are shown in Figure 12.
Figure 9. Time of Transaction with Easy Hash
Figure 10. Time of Transaction with Hard Hash
Figure 11. Time of Transaction Encryption
We compare SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 in this case.
With the experiments results, SHA-512 costs least time and
SHA-384 takes longer compare with others. The more details
of implementation and evaluation will be discussed in future
work.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this study, we proposed a novel and incentive two-stage
blockchain based employment, education, and skill certifica-
tion framework; it provided a trusted source of employees’
information that is not modifiable and permanently. It of-
fers more immutable, fair, trust, and direct pathway between
employers and employees. With the implementation of the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game, we found a Nash equi-
librium that helps to select the set of winners and determine
the price. With the incentive auction mechanism, it can reach
the social cost minimization. It will help employer rapid and
accurate to target the right candidate, and support employee
moves forward to advanced career life.
