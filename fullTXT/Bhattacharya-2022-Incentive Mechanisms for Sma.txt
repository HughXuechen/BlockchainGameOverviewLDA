Abstract: Smart grids (SG) are electricity grids that communicate with each other, provide reliable
information, and enable administrators to operate energy supplies across the country, ensuring
optimized reliability and efficiency. The smart grid contains sensors that measure and transmit data
to adjust the flow of electricity automatically based on supply/demand, and thus, responding to
problems becomes quicker and easier. This also plays a crucial role in controlling carbon emissions, by
avoiding energy losses during peak load hours and ensuring optimal energy management. The scope
of big data analytics in smart grids is huge, as they collect information from raw data and derive
intelligent information from the same. However, these benefits of the smart grid are dependent on the
active and voluntary participation of the consumers in real-time. Consumers need to be motivated
and conscious to avail themselves of the achievable benefits. Incentivizing the appropriate actor
is an absolute necessity to encourage prosumers to generate renewable energy sources (RES) and
motivate industries to establish plants that support sustainable and green-energy-based processes
or products. The current study emphasizes similar aspects and presents a comprehensive survey
of the start-of-the-art contributions pertinent to incentive mechanisms in smart grids, which can be
used in smart grids to optimize the power distribution during peak times and also reduce carbon
emissions. The various technologies, such as game theory, blockchain, and artificial intelligence,
used in implementing incentive mechanisms in smart grids are discussed, followed by different
incentive projects being implemented across the globe. The lessons learnt, challenges faced in such
implementations, and open issues such as data quality, privacy, security, and pricing related to
incentive mechanisms in SG are identified to guide the future scope of research in this sector.

1. Introduction
An electric grid is a power system network that delivers electricity from power pro-
ducer(s) to consumer(s). This system comprises several significant components, including
generating plants, transmission and distribution lines, sub-stations, and transformers, to
provide electricity to meet energy demands. Power generation can be categorized as cen-
tralized or decentralized based on whether energy generation occurs far from or close to
consumption. The energy thus generated is provided to the consumption points with the
help of powerlines, transformers, and sub-stations. The energy consumers include resi-
dential, commercial, and industrial consumers based on their energy needs. Conventional

electrical grids are demand-driven, have a hierarchical structure, practically no storage
capability, and provide only one-way electricity supply and consumption control. However,
they do not allow communication between customers and suppliers of electricity, which
is beneficial for the effective and efficient management of power. Several problems arise
in traditional electrical grids, such as peak-time management of electricity distribution,
delay in detection of failures in lane/transformer, inability to predict the electricity demand,
and so on [1]. These shortcomings of traditional electrical grids have necessitated the
development of a smarter electrical grid/smart grid (SG) [2].
SG are electricity networks that enable the flow of electricity in two ways and also
pro-actively detect and react to several issues, as well as changes/updates in usage. They
enable active participation from the customers in the grid and have self-healing capabilities.
An SG system can thus collect large volumes of heterogeneous data, which often makes a
system complex and difficult to manage. The use of big data analytics on the SG data helps
in achieving technical, economic, and social benefits [3].
Internet of things (IoT), big data analytics, and machine learning (ML) technologies
are key enablers of the SG. Through these technologies, SG can effectively predict the
electricity demand, detect/predict faults in lanes, enable smart metering, optimize the
grid, and react faster to challenges [4]. SG ensure the quality of the power even in case
of power outages. SG also reduce carbon dioxide and other poisonous emissions during
power generation, thus focusing on green energy. SG can automate the power system, sense
along the transmission lines, and enable better power storage. Through the deployment
of IoT sensors and intelligent devices at several locations of the power transmission, it is
possible to check the condition of the network and identify problems and abnormalities in
the grid [5].
Although SG can provide significant services and applications, attracting consumers/
producers to participate in several operations of SG is still a significant challenge. Con-
sumers/ producers and grid operators may have to be provided with some incentive to
improve the operations of the SG. For instance, demand response is a crucial operation in
an SG, where the customers may have to shed/reduce their power consumption in peak
periods to balance the supply and demand of electricity. To motivate the consumers to
shed/reduce their energy consumption during peak hours, grid operators can provide
them with incentives such as reduced pricing based on their energy consumption [6].
Another example is the government incentivizing grid operators who provide electric
charging at a lesser price to electric vehicles (EV) by providing some subsidies or reducing
taxes and so on [7]. Similarly, the producers can be motivated by providing incentives for
renewable energy generation so that the emission of poisonous gases can be reduced to a
great extent [8].
Hence, developing incentive mechanisms using several technologies, such as game
theory, artificial intelligence (AI)/ ML algorithms, blockchain, and federated learning (FL),
to motivate the SG operators, producers, and consumers of electricity plays a vital role
in maintaining the supply/demand balance of electricity, optimizing resource utilization,
providing a fair price to the consumers, reducing carbon emissions, and so on. Considering
the aforementioned aspects, a comprehensive survey on the incentive mechanisms for SG
is provided in this paper.
Even though several surveys on incentive mechanisms and SG have been carried
out separately, there is no survey focusing specifically on incentive mechanisms for SG.
This is the first work attempting to review incentive mechanisms for SG, to the best of our
knowledge. The main contribution of this work is surveying the state of the art of different
strategies for incentive mechanisms in SG. From the survey, we identify some open issues
and challenges that are yet to be addressed, and then we present future directions that
will motivate researchers to carry out their research in this direction. Table 1 provides a
summary of the existing surveys and identification of the relevant limitations.

2. Background
This section discusses SG, the big data life cycle in SG systems, incentive mechanism
applications, and categories.
2.1. Smart Grid
Electricity is generated from various sources, such as thermal power plants, nuclear
power plants, hydropower plants, and other RES, which include solar parks and wind
parks [27]. The sources of energy generators are termed “producers”. In the present electric
grid system, the generated electricity is consumed by the group called consumers, including
actors such as industries, factories, and homes/societies. The electric grid can accommodate
these two actors in the system structure, and the flow of electricity is unidirectional.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 5 of 28
Figure 1 provides an overview of the actors involved in the SG’s environment. Pro-
sumers in the SG are capable of both producing and consuming energy. Prosumers could
produce energy utilizing solar panels, EVs, and wind turbines. The energy flow between
the grid and the prosumers is bidirectional. The excess energy produced by the prosumers
through solar, wind and thermal sources is sent to the grid. Therefore, the grid is expected
to be smart to accommodate the operations to reflect the quantity of energy generated from
the individual prosumers, geographical locations, and intermittent power generation, and
to cope with the new forms of load. The SG can accommodate this third actor in the system
infrastructure. SG not only encourages a two-way energy exchange but also transfers data
between the actors [28]. The data transferred includes information about the natural load
that the consumer requires regularly. The amount of energy consumed by the consumers
during the daytime will not be the same as during the night. Similarly, the load utilized at
homes during the summer season is higher than in the winter. Therefore, under certain
circumstances such as seasonal/climatic changes or shifts in a day, the consumption load
may vary accordingly. However, the energy producers are assigned a threshold point,
and despite the varying load consumption by the consumers, the energy generated from
various sources, such as nuclear and thermal power plants, remains constant. Deploying
SG allows the producer group to know the actual energy required by the consumer group
and thereby generate the required energy only. The required data from the consumer
group is collected from electrical appliances, smart meters, and EVs through appropriate
sensors [29,30]. The collected data can be used for informing the SG infrastructure, to
understand the home/society load, appliances’ electricity usage pattern, and the power
on/off condition of appliances [31,32]. The concept of a home area network/wide area
network (HAN/WAN) is used to acquire real-time data from electrical devices. Moreover,
consumers can benefit from making smart decisions based on the acquired data. To prepare
for the rapid de-carbonization requirement and various awareness programs, incentivizing
the appropriate actor in the system is essential. The necessity to incentivize the actors in
the SG is discussed in this section. In the heating sector, the burning of fossil fuel technolo-
gies is replaced with renewable heat generators and producers. To motivate this activity,
the renewable heat incentive (RHI) of Great Britain has introduced incentive schemes for
domestic and non-domestic energy producers [33]. RHI incentivizes additional income for
every unit of heat produced by the domestic/non-domestic producers.

Among the three models available for participating in the energy demand/supply
process, feed-in tariff (FIT), net metering policy (NMP), and energy auction, NMP is adapted
in India by various states. One of the significant advantages that common users can enjoy
is that the model offers consumers the privilege of comparing energy pricing and choosing
their energy supplier. Additionally, in this model, the prosumers could sell their excess
energy for more incentives than in other models. In another example, the Government of
India is encouraging consumers to generate RES so that the excess energy generated can
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 6 of 28
be sold through bidding [34]. Kappagantu et al. noted the fact that SG are a high-capital
investment [35]. Besides such huge investments, stakeholders and investors need to be
identified and incentivized. In developing countries like India, replacing the existing
technology with new technology might burden the economic and financial situations of
the nation and individuals. A lack of awareness of the technology and fear of a hike
in electricity charges, new tariffs, and other health-related issues hinder the successful
deployment of smart meters. Hence, along with necessary awareness programs, paying
back incentives in the form of energy tokens or cash coins to the organizations, utilities,
and individuals are the predominant elements to promote smart meters. Many countries
have meticulously formulated regulations and policies concerning SG, which would make
the stakeholders actively participate in the energy-generating and selling platform.
Tao et al. have put forth real-time pricing (RTP) mechanism as a way to incentivize
efficient energy usage [36]. In line with this discussion, the authors also support the need
for motivating incentive policies.
Energy producers such as RES are not constant energy generators. The energy de-
mand of consumers is not the same around the clock. The variation in energy production
and consumption leads to dynamic electricity pricing. The electricity pricing is directly
proportional to the electricity demand. Hence, over a day, electricity pricing during the
early morning, midday, and late evening can be low, high, and low, respectively [37].
Having the demand/price data in their smartphone, consumers can make smart decisions,
such as using electric appliances [38] during morning/night and not recharging their car
during peak hours [39]. These activities could be automated and are termed “self-healing
systems” [40]. Whenever the demand on the consumer side is low, it will be communicated
to the producer’s side to generate energy accordingly.
2.2. Big Data Life Cycle in SG Systems
Big data technologies [41–43] help in the evaluation of data models and also improve
data management in SG. The data sources in SG frameworks include large volumes of
operational data generated in the form of electrical data from the grids, featuring the
real-time and reactive demand response capacity, voltage, and reactive flow of power. The
non-operational data include power quality data and reliability-related data. Apart from
these, data relevant to meter usage is critical, as it helps in calculations of power usage
and demand values, namely in terms of average, peaks, and delay timings. The event
message data is collected from voltage loss or restoration information, fault detection,
and exceptional events. Metadata organizes and interprets the aforementioned collected
data from sources, namely smart meters, sensors, devices, mobile devices, mobile data
terminals, distributed energy sources, intelligent devices, and various others. The inte-
gration of this data is done using advanced information and communication technologies
that ensure improvement in SG reliability, efficiency, and performance. To be specific,
service-oriented architecture (SOA) is used in demand systems, making data integration
easier, as it can communicate using a single approach [44]. An enterprise service bus (ESB)
enables monitoring, management, and divergence in the integration process, reducing
cost and time. The common information models (CIM) help in achieving persistence in
the case of critical data structures [45]. The messaging services help communicate data
and other relevant information across various applications and servers. Data storage in
SG is crucial, as it involves collecting data from dispatched data sources and ensuring
delivery of data to the analytics tool in the case of accelerated input/output operations
(IOPS). The data storage mechanisms predominantly used for this purpose are distributed
file systems (DFS), and NoSQL databases [46]. Data analytics plays a significant role in
making an SG function intelligently and efficiently. Five different types of analytics are
used in SG implementations: signal analytics which is based on the processing of signals;
event analytics relevant to events; state analytics, which help in visualizing the state of
the grid; engineering operations analytics, which ensures seamless operation of the grid;
and finally, customer analytics, which provides insight on customer data. Like any other
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 7 of 28
system, big data analytics in SG is implemented in two phases. The first includes batch
processing, which processes data in a particular period without response time constraints.
The second is stream processing, which is performed for real-time implementations requir-
ing low response latency. The choice of big data technology plays a vital role in achieving
optimum results. Electrical companies often use multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)
tools in the form of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to ensure qualitative and
quantitative performance [45,47].
3. Technologies for Designing Incentive Mechanisms in SG
From the existing literature, it can be seen that the incentive mechanisms for SG
are designed using game theory, blockchain, and AI. This section discusses how these
technologies can help design incentive mechanisms for SG and the recent state-of-the-art
for the same.
3.1. Game Theory
Game theory deals with modelling strategies through which the players can make
interdependent decisions by considering their competitor’s decisions [48]. This science
of strategies helps the player determine various mathematical and logical actions that
need to be performed to reach the optimum outcome in the game. Games in game theory
can be categorized into five types: (i) cooperative and non-cooperative games; (ii) normal
form and extensive form games; (iii) simultaneous move and sequential move games; (iv)
constant sum, zero-sum, and non-zero-sum games; and (v) symmetric and asymmetric
games. Game theory provides noteworthy analytical benefits in various disciplines such as
finance, military, energy, operations research, and more.
Various games in game theory can also be used to solve critical issues in the SG. Out
of these, cooperation in the non-cooperative setting is best suited for designing incentive
mechanisms in the SG. Players have partial or total conflicting interests in deciding the case
of non-cooperative games, whereas an incentive is provided for players to act together in
the case of cooperative games. SG constitutes various micro-grid elements, in which some
grids may require excess energy, whereas some other grids have unused energy to share.
A cooperative strategy can be applied here for exchanging energy between microgrids
without requesting it from the main grid [49]. Demand-side management (DSM) is a
significant part of the SG, as energy consumption can be controlled on the consumer side.
Incentives can also be provided to those consumers who adjust energy consumption by
considering the peak hours and using power when it is least loaded in the grid. Monetary
incentives can also be provided for consumers who voluntarily shift their energy usage
during the non-peak hours, thus balancing the energy load.
A scheduling mechanism based on incentives for energy consumption was proposed
by [50]. The “energy consumption scheduler” is provided in the smart meter, thus enabling
optimal energy consumption for every user. Smart meters are connected to both the power
lines and communication networks. With the help of a flexible and appropriate pricing
mechanism, the Nash equilibrium can be achieved by not deviating from the actual strategy,
and by making sure that the strategy of every component is also optimal when considering
the decisions made by other components. A detailed study on incentive mechanisms is
carried out by [15]. Similarly, anonymous rewarding schemes in the SG were studied
by [51].
A framework named “REWARDS” was proposed for assigning rewards in SG [52].
This privacy-preserving mechanism can provide incentives to consumers by assigning
rewards anonymously to the token, which can be redeemed at any time. A hybrid demand
response mechanism that combines real-time incentives and pricing using a 3-level Stackel-
berg game was also proposed. This model proved beneficial for the power grid, retailers,
and users. Similarly, a demand response model based on a 2-level Stackelberg game that
understands consumer–company interaction was proposed. This allows the consumers
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 8 of 28
to be provided with benefits based on the power consumed [53]. In addition, a dynamic
pricing model was proposed to ensure SG robustness.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can also be used for designing efficient energy
trading games by providing the day-ahead details of pricing, thus enabling every player to
understand strategies for energy trading that further increase average revenue [54,55]. In
addition, incentive-based models from the viewpoint of grid operators were proposed. A
two-loop Stackelberg game model was used by [56] to understand the interaction between
different participants. The model considers different levels in the hierarchy, such as grid
operators, service providers, and consumers. This incentive-based model works by the
interaction between three hierarchical levels, which can help make significant demand
reduction possible at the consumer end by assigning incentives based on their cooperation.
The work was further extended in [57] by considering the intra-day market with demand
response resources from multiple sectors. The Stackelberg approach could yield the best
trading results and minimum procurement cost. Liu et al. [58] formulated a bi-level game
that benefits both the consumer and aggregator by playing the game at the community level
and the market level. An “energy demand partition-based market purchasing algorithm”
is also proposed for solving the game formulated. Even though different games, in theory,
can be used for formulating incentive mechanisms in SG, most of the research has been
carried out with Stackelberg games, as they prove to be efficient in modelling decision-
making problems.
3.2. Blockchain
Blockchain can be defined as a digital ledger of decentralized transactions in a peer-
to-peer network. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, it offers various other
advantages, such as transparency, security, privacy, traceability, cost reduction, efficiency,
immutability, tokenization, and more [59]. Blockchain proves to be efficient in various
domains, such as healthcare, SG, voting, real estate, banking, and insurance. The integra-
tion of blockchain with SG proves to be efficient in handling security, privacy, incentive
mechanisms, penalty mechanisms, and standardization issues. Various use cases related
to the use of blockchain have been carried out by [25]. Similarly, Mollah et al. provide an
extensive study on the use of blockchain in SG [60]. In addition, Aderibole et al. surveyed
the applicability of blockchain technology in SG about three important features: decentral-
ization, incentives, and trust [61]. This section provides an overview of various research
works on designing incentive schemes for SG using blockchain technology.
Incentive and penalty mechanisms are often related but complementary. Incentive
schemes benefit customers by providing rewards in terms of cryptocurrency, reputation
value, and carbon credit, whereas penalty schemes aid in preventing malicious activity by
participating entities. Each electricity unit can be considered a virtual currency in blockchain
technology. Wang et al. [62] proposed a blockchain-based energy system involving various
energy trading transactions and crowdsourcing. This is carried out using a two-phase
algorithm, where the initial phase focuses on grid operation and the second phase aids in
balancing energy surplus or deficit using monetary incentivizing schemes. This system
is implemented using the “IBM Hyperledger Fabric platform”. As wireless networks
can further improve the efficiency of an energy trading system, [63] proposed an energy
management system for SG using wireless networks and blockchain technology. The smart
contracts enabled in this system allow the producers to gain fair incentives for providing
quality power generation.
A security-aware demand response management system named “ε-Sutra” was pro-
posed by [64], which includes an “Ethereum-based smart contract” for incentivizing con-
sumers as an effort to improve their energy-saving behaviour. Energy and carbon markets
were also considered in a decentralized energy trading system proposed by [65]. In addi-
tion, incentive mechanisms prove to be useful in enhancing the grid connection behaviour
of P2P trading systems [66]. Another breakthrough in the field was the introduction of
a fully public blockchain to deal with the energy trading market [67]. A proof-of-stake
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 9 of 28
consensus protocol alleviates the price gaps, thus rewarding the concerned party according
to their energy behaviour. The integration of blockchain technology in the SG is still a
hot research topic in energy systems, as more transparent and secure systems that benefit
consumers and producers can be built using this. Figure 2 depicts the blockchain-based
incentive mechanism for SG. Here, the data server publishes the task, the data owners
upload their data, and the data miners verify the quality of data and the transactions. Based
on the data uploaded by the users, appropriate incentives will be provided.

3.3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
AI and ML techniques aid in developing intelligent systems [68–70]. These sub-fields
of computer science, however, are not the same. AI can be referred to as the ability of
machines to mimic human behaviour, thereby performing human-like activities. ML,
a subfield of AI, refers to the machine’s ability to learn from the data without being
programmed explicitly. AI and ML prove to be efficient in dealing with various real-life
applications [71].
Extensive research has been carried out in AI and ML to develop intelligent solutions
for SG. Rahmani et al. [72] presented techniques for incentive-based demand response
models, thereby enabling various levels of participation based on different loads. Another
significant contribution was made by [73] in designing a real-time incentive mechanism for
SG using deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches. This technique enables
the service providers to purchase energy from their customers and thus provide incentives
to deserving customers. Neural networks were used in this model to predict energy
demands and prices, whereas reinforcement learning was used to identify the optimal
prices considering the incentives. An extensive study on different incentive mechanisms
that can be adopted for smart energy systems has been made by [74]. The study also
focused on various challenges associated with implementing SG and presented a solution
of contract-based systems that can enhance profit margins.
Dynamic pricing with incentive-based strategies has been presented by [75] by using
potentiometers to monitor the energy load and thus enabling active participation from the

customer side in reducing energy usage. The model further increases the reliability of SG
to a great extent. Here, IoT and ML techniques play a major role in actively recording the
customer’s various activities and predicting the energy usage with which optimal decisions
can be made in reducing the energy demand. In addition, Ref. [76] adopted a k-means
algorithm and dimensionality reduction approaches in clustering the customers based on
their energy usage and pricing during critical peak periods. An “extreme learning machine”
(ELM) technique was used for clustering the energy load profiles and usages based on
hourly measurements, which was then used for designing exclusive pricing mechanisms
for every group using the “symbolic aggregate approximation” (SAX) technique.
Deep reinforcement learning-based models were also proposed for designing effective
incentive mechanisms in the SG. One such mechanism to achieve real-time performance
in the DR model was proposed by [73]. Customer diversity is taken into account while
designing the incentive schemes. In addition, the service provider payments with and
without demand response were studied to understand the different scenarios in the energy
trading market. Another contribution was made by [77] in designing an incentive-based
model that helps in maximizing the overall profits of consumers and producers, thus
leading to a win-win situation.
FL techniques work by training a model collaboratively among distributed devices
without the need to share the data to a centralized server. Data privacy can be ensured in
SG with the help of FL mechanisms. Figure 3 depicts the FL-based incentive mechanism
for SG. Training the data is carried out locally in the respective stations, and the result will
only be shared with the cloud server. The parameters thus obtained can be used for global
model updates. Appropriate incentives will be provided to the consumers based on the
data obtained in the cloud server. A mechanism for privacy-preserving energy data sharing
using edge-cloud collaboration was proposed by [78].

To guarantee high-quality model collaboration, an incentive-based algorithm is also
proposed. Biudko et al. [79] used FL techniques to collaborate efficiently in an energy-
data-sharing environment. In addition, an incentive-based approach was proposed using
reinforcement and deep learning approaches. Similarly, [80] proposed a mechanism for
sharing the knowledge obtained from local data using FL approaches. The authors in [81]
proposed a privacy-preserving approach based on FL. Here, an embedded incentive mech-
anism is employed for function encryption. In another interesting work, Lim et al. [82]
proposed a task-aware scheme based on incentives for application in smart industries.
Workers are rewarded based on their work, making it reliable for dealing with real-time
applications. Literature shows that AI and ML models play a significant role in designing
effective incentive mechanisms for SG, as the model can also be trained for big data sets,
thus increasing the overall profit of customers and producers.
A systematic literature review approach is followed in this work to provide an
overview of designing incentive mechanisms for SG. The relevant works were selected from
reputable publishers such as IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, Wiley, Springer, ACM, and reputable
ranked conferences by searching in Google scholar. “SG AND Incentive mechanisms AND
Game theory”, “SG AND Incentive mechanisms AND Blockchain”, and “SG AND Incentive
mechanisms AND AI” were the search queries used in this work to retrieve the relevant
peer-reviewed articles. The papers collected were screened based on their readability and
quality. A summary of various enabling technologies for designing incentive mechanisms
is provided in Table 3.

4. Research Projects and Use Cases
In an SG, there exists a need to meet users’ ever-growing demands, and hence upgrad-
ing the power system by increasing its capacity becomes an absolute necessity. However,
the inevitable consequence is an under-utilized power system, which leads to the wastage
of money and resources. The normal generating capacity should be utilized efficiently
and optimally to ensure sustainable development, which is possible only by implementing
DSM techniques. The DSM technique is a tool for efficiently redistributing energy as per
the demand over a specific period, enabling enhanced utilization in SG instead of opting
for extensive constructions. It is also important to remember the need for environmental
conservation, which is hindered due to inefficient use of power in most constructions,
increasing environmental pollution and wastage of natural resources. The massive fluc-
tuations in power generations compel thermal power plants to spend unnecessarily on
extra fuels during peak demands, resulting in uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gases
and inefficiencies. Thus, the development of DSM techniques becomes a dire necessity to
reduce the wastage of resources and environmental pollution. The smart pricing method is
one such technique that uses an auction mechanism to transfer information between users
and providers. This enables them to meet the energy demand of the users by investing
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 13 of 28
minimal costs in grid generation. However, when the users report their energy demand,
there exist possibilities of cheating wherein they consume more while paying less, creating
an extra burden for grid-operated meters, as mentioned in [84]. The study records users’
consumption information and communicates the same to the energy provider. The pat-
terns of consumption and their preferences are also modelled using utility functions. The
Arrow–d’Aspremont–Gerard-Varet (AGV) technique is an incentive method wherein the
user’s payment is correlated with the consumption credit. The users in such circumstances
are punished by being charged extra if a cheat record is identified in the consumption
history. This mechanism helps achieve compatibility in the incentive mechanism, balancing
the budget. Both the user and the energy provider reduce environmental pollution and
resource wastage. The present study has identified the industry and research projects from
reputed agencies by using the search query “Research projects AND incentive mechanism
AND SG”. The various incentive-mechanism-based projects implemented across the globe
are discussed here and presented in Table 4.

SG Incentive Program in Andalusia: Andalusia is an autonomous and highly pop-
ulous community located in peninsular Spain. Various energy planning projects exist as
part of the energy plan for Andalusia 2003–2006, the Andalusia Energy Sustainability plan
2007–2013, and the latest one, entitled Energy Strategy of Andalusia 2020 [85]. The end of
the validation of these previous energy plans consequentially led to the development of the
Energy Strategy of Andalusia 2020, wherein SG development has been one of the primary
objectives. The idea was to modernize and implement innovative projects in the region,
and hence an incentive line for SG was also included as part of the sustainable energy
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 14 of 28
development program. This scheme is intended to e-connect the cities and the citizens, in-
volving all the citizens, self-employed individuals, companies, the public, and various other
entities. The program focused on three aspects of support—SG, sustainable construction,
and sustainable SMEs, which helped promote improvement in energy-related actions. The
energy demands in the household, business, and administrations were reduced, and energy
usage was optimized in the most sophisticated and efficient way [86]. The SMILE project
has helped in achieving a deeper perspective on the collaboration involving stakeholders
who develop the projects [87]. It manages all the projects involved in the incentivization of
SG. The Innovgrid project is a smart metering project that includes 30,000 consumption
points, known as energy boxes, for collecting data relevant to consumption profiles, and
collective grid demands integrating consumption management capabilities with metering
functionalities using data analytics. The SET-UP project provides information on strategies
for addressing challenges associated with integrating distributed energy sources in existing
systems and identifies a way to convert traditional networks into smarter ones. It has also
created an SG working group that explores various smart electricity systems and provides
concrete solutions for the development of SG for the future [88,89].
SG Project in India—POWERGRID: the far-fetched dream of developing the mod-
ern Indian power system can only be fulfilled through the deployment of SG. This would
contribute immensely towards improving the efficiency of the power sector in India. The
SG vision in India has the core objective to “Transform the Indian power system into
a secure, adaptable, sustainable and digitally-enabled ecosystem providing reliable and
quality energy for all participating stakeholders". This objective is simultaneously aligned
with the government’s policy to provide access, availability, and affordability of power
to all without compromising quality. The Indian SG Task Force (ISGTF) has identified
fourteen SG projects to fulfill its goals. POWERGRID is one such initiative that emphasizes
implementing SG technology in all verticals of the electric supply chain. Open collaboration
with the manufacturers, academicians, solution providers, and consultants is initiated in
the distribution phase of the pilot SG project. This open, collaborative effort helps design
EVs’ tariffs, net metering, and deployment through various renewables. The various SG
attributes have been implemented and scaled up in this sector. For example, almost 1600
smart meters have been installed on customers’ premises, integrated with data concen-
trator units (DCU) and Meter Data Management System (MDMS) by the control center
at Puducherry. The Smart Home Energy Management System constitutes smart security,
and microgrid controllers have been implemented to incorporate active customer par-
ticipation. The visible benefits of such implementations include improved efficiency in
metering and collection. Significant improvement is observed in the billing cycles due
to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), enabling concurrent meter reading collection
from the vast customer base. In addition, AMI has helped detect anomalous consumer
behaviour relevant to meter tampering, uninformed shifting of meters, excessive usage due
to family functions, damaged wiring issues, and erroneous meter readings [90].
SG Incentive Mechanism Projects in China: China is the world’s largest market for
power transmission and distribution. It is also the major consumer of SG technology. The SG
market in China is large and immensely influenced by two factors. First, the commitment
of China toward green development creates a need for the adoption of SG technologies.
Second, the market of China reduces equipment costs due to the active role of the Chinese
government. However, appropriate utilization of such opportunities requires a structured
vision, supportive policies, and incentives in the SG implementation. China emphasized a
supply dispatch paradigm to respond to the dire need to expand generation capacity in the
early 2000s. However, due to the rapid growth in urbanization and increase in distributed
power, the need for demand/supply balancing has evolved. These smart energy systems
allow the government to develop incentives supporting demand-side applications for SG
concurrently with supply-side developments. The 5G SG project in China helps reduce
faults in the distribution line by milliseconds and reduces power consumption in 5G base
stations by using peak-clipping and valley-filling strategies. The Honeywell pilot project
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 15 of 28
includes demand response, advanced energy management, and sub-metering, helping
consumers manage the energy supply and demand efficiently, and reducing the burden on
the utility infrastructure in China [91,92].
Incentive Mechanism Projects in France: The French administration uses its revenue
cap within a regulatory period of four years. The revenues are predicted for each year,
including the estimation of Opex and returns on the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB). Opex’s
(Operational Expenditure) and Capex’s (Capital Expenditure) estimations are considered
distinctly. The organization takes responsibility for any deviations from the estimations,
and the difference in Capex is recovered from the revenue allowances of the following years.
In the case of SG projects, different schemes are implemented, and there are investments
producing reductions in Capex (DSM and storage). In addition, a significantly less than
proportional increase in Opex is reprimanded. This is further incentivized in the case of
SG projects, wherein Opex costs more than EUR 3 million and cost overruns are recovered
through subsequent adjustments in the revenue cap. As an example, the pilot Linky smart
meters provide residential participation using automation. The meters include G3-PLC
communication that provides hourly data, creating business opportunities in renewable
energy and integration for prosumers and EVs. The ENR Pool project in France builds a
virtual power plant that combines wind and solar energy to provide services to industrial
customers. It provides financial incentives to industries to modulate their production
during a particular time frame to resolve problems pertinent to renewable energies [93,94].
Incentive Mechanism Projects in USA: SG technologies are being deployed enthu-
siastically by the Department of Energy to improve efficiency, reliability, and resilience,
thereby efficiently ensuring integration and optimized utilization of the distributed energy
resources (DERs). The most interesting aspect of the present deployment of SG technol-
ogy includes the integration of information technologies, operational technologies, cloud
computing, computer networks, and related services. The IEC61850 and IEEE1547 are
being implemented to achieve security and interoperability. The total investment made
by US utilities towards electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in 2016 was
almost USD 144 billion. Apart from this, the investor-owned utilities, which include almost
73 percent of the total electricity customers in the USA, have spent almost 21 billion dollars
and 27 billion dollars on transmission and distribution-related infrastructure, respectively.
These costs are likely to increase by almost 13.8 billion dollars by 2024. In this regard,
advanced and structured state policies combined with favourable business incentives have
initiated the accelerated adoption of DERs.
The present challenge lies in the declining cost of distributed technologies in the case
of rooftop solar and EVs. This needs to be accelerated in association with robust control
capabilities in the states of the USA that have high incentives and targets pertinent to
renewable energy. The smart meters and advanced metering infrastructures (AMI) enable
the utilities to direct price-based signals to customers, incentivizing demand reduction
during peak consumption periods. The favourable policies and incentive mechanisms have
also triggered growth in distributed solar and utility-scale systems. The existing policies and
incentives at the federal, state and local levels prefer the adoption of renewable energy at a
huge amount in various distribution system levels, which acts as a motivation to develop
renewable-energy-based projects. The energy storage systems and incentive mechanisms
are relatively new, but almost five states have adopted energy storage incentives and
investment programs. The state of California is in the leading position and has a self-
generation incentive program that has provided almost USD 420 million since 2019 to
develop residential storage projects. As per the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA),
there will be a significant improvement in costs, policy incentives, and corporate demand,
leading to almost 16GW of capacity by 2022. The notable SG projects that have implemented
incentive mechanisms in the USA are the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(ARRA)-funded project, the SG Investment Grant (SGIG) project, and the Smart Study
Together project [95].

Incentive Mechanism Projects in Brazil: In Brazil, the Energy Big Push Project (EBP)
was initiated as part of the 17 Sustainable Global Development Goals included in the Paris
Agreement and its agenda of 2030. The project focused on sustainable development, energy
transition, and international cooperation to support investments in sustainable energies
and related innovations. The project was proposed considering four dimensions: Axis 1,
Axis 2, Axis 3, and Axis 4. Axis 1 focused on developing processes that involved collecting,
structuring, and managing data pertinent to various private and public investments in
research and development activities in the energy sector. Axis 2 surveyed social, economic,
environmental, and technical performance indicators with the help of low carbon energy
solutions. Axis 3 identified strategic policies and guidelines that helped accelerate invest-
ments in the energy sector. Finally, Axis 4 ensured the establishment of innovative and
efficient communication strategies pertinent to project results specific to decision-makers.
The present incentive mechanisms implemented in Brazil for low-carbon energy technology
development are classified into four categories by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
The four categories are as follows.
Resource push: To be successful in technology innovation in the sector, incentiviz-
ing requires consistent funding for conducting research and development activities, for
skilled professionals, and for well-defined priorities that help to fill the gaps that channel
innovative activities. These aspects as a whole help to push the technology forward.
Knowledge management: The incentive mechanism for innovation in the energy
sector and the development of related products and services require new ideas and efficient
knowledge management so that the knowledge is disseminated with the help of dynamic
networks and transmitted seamlessly across the value chain, ensuring intellectual property
rights are maintained.
Market pull: It is also important that innovative ideas reach markets properly at
the right time. Performance-oriented market instruments, namely the quotas, standards,
carbon pricing, tax incentives, and public and pre-commercial procurement, help attract
innovative activities, create scope for early deployment of incentive mechanisms, and
ensure new incentive-mechanism-based products and technologies achieve a position in
the market.
Socio-political support: The socio-political environment acts as a seedbed for technol-
ogy innovation. Energy innovation strategies involving incentive mechanisms must receive
the necessary support and engagement from all relevant stakeholders, which include the
customers and industry [96].
5. Lessons Learned, Open Issues, Challenges, and Future Directions
5.1. Open Issues and Challenges
Data Quality: Data quality plays a critical role in SG to facilitate all private and gov-
ernmental business applications [97]. Due to the huge data generation from SG, data quality
assessment and improvement remains a challenging task. Some of the key techniques to
maintain data quality are record linkage, business rules, and similarity measures [98].
Data uncertainty: Data uncertainty is the subset of data quality prevailing as a sig-
nificant concern in designing incentive-based SG, wherein the attributes of consistency,
completeness, and accuracy contribute as important factors in decision making. However,
the data set includes missing/inconsistent values and noises, leading to erroneous results
when making important real-time decisions. Various factors contribute to data loss and
related data uncertainties, such as noise, missing/inconsistent data, unsynchronized data,
physical damage to equipment, cyber-attacks, communication latencies, sensor imprecision,
sensor inaccuracies, and so on. The level of data or information availability and public
trust are the key challenges in designing and adopting incentive-based SG [99]. Thus, these
aspects need to be considered critically during the design of an incentive-based SG [100].
Issues such as malicious attacks interfering with the incentives of data control and
acquisition or sensor aging can lead to errors in sensor readings [101] in smart grids. Data
analytics and mining techniques are the predominant choices to resolve such data uncer-
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 17 of 28
tainties. In this regard, uncertainties can be modelled as stochastic processes within given
limits for probabilistic data mining and data analytics. Data pre-processing techniques
should be considered when designing incentive-based SG, such as data conditioning, data
integrity, and data cleaning, which can be utilized to smooth out or eliminate noise, correct
inconsistencies, find missing values and resolve redundancies.
Data Security: Financial transactions, commercial secrets, and consumer privacy
information are significant data security concerns [102,103]. Consumer data security issues
should be considered when designing an incentive-based SG. Blockchain and FL can
be used to preserve data security. Integrity is improved due to the focus given to the
development of equipment within traditional power delivery systems [104]. It can be seen
that the reliability of the power industry has been supported by modern communication
equipment and technologies until recent times. However, cyber security concerns have
emerged as critical issues for power systems due to increased connectivity in recent years.
Communication and IT issues have been inclusively covered in the cyber-security of power
systems in recent times. In particular, it is established that the security of power grids
would help prevent, prepare, protect, mitigate, and respond to unfortunate cyber-attack
events or natural disasters.
Data Privacy: SG collect data regarding the user’s power consumption, as they reflect
informative insights relevant to the user’s behaviour, but this has associated critical privacy
concerns. In addition, in some scenarios, organizations feel reluctant to share the data
despite the incentives being appealing, as they remain suspicious of their non-public and
sensitive data being compromised. The prominent approach used for addressing such
concerns is data aggregation. In such cases, data aggregation from the consumer and
service provider’s point of view should be considered when designing incentive-based
SG [105]. Various techniques such as differential aggregation, distributed aggregation, and
storage aggregation can be considered when designing an incentive-based SG to address
privacy concerns. Economic management and smart control of energy consumption require
higher interoperability between the service provider and consumers [106]. Privacy invasion
in incentive-based SG is likely to occur when energy-related data remain unprotected.
Radio waves in AMI have the potential to reveal information about users’ whereabouts and
activities, making user privacy vulnerable to potential attacks. Customers and regulators
lack confidence in the adoption of SG where privacy concerns are not addressed, especially
in the case of incentive-based SG. To eliminate such issues, blockchain and FL can be
implemented to preserve data privacy in SG.
Data Integrity: The maintenance of data and ensuring consistency in data accuracy are
highly important in achieving the objectives of accurate incentive-based SG systems [107].
Data integrity is ensured by preventing unauthorized changes to users’ information. Dif-
ferent techniques, such as cryptography blockchain, should be used to keep consumers’
data protected from malicious entities in the smart incentive grid. Risks of physical and
cyber-attacks are of equal concern in the power industry due to the close interdependencies
between communication and power infrastructure. There are possibilities of financial
transactions being modified deliberately due to these cyberattacks, which would also result
in misleading the operational decisions pertinent to utility management. Data integrity
can be ensured by a privacy-preserving data aggregation (P2DA) scheme using a message
authentication code or digital signature in smart incentive grid frameworks. Data security
techniques such as MES, blockchain, and FL can be used to preserve data security.
Data Authentication: The accurate distinguishing of legitimate and illegitimate iden-
tities can serve as the basis of authentication for designing incentive-based SG data. For
example, if an illegitimate identity enters the incentive-based SG system, there exists a high
possibility of errors in distributing incentives. Here, intrusion detection, trust management,
and implementation of encryption techniques act as important security mechanisms for
preventing, detecting, and mitigating network attacks [108]. Various techniques, namely
the signature generation and data encryption, are used for security management and data
authentication in SG. Grid recognition authentication can also be used to authenticate data.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 18 of 28
Latency: Delay of data transmission between incentive-based SG components is
measured by latency. As the immediate transmission of data is needed, latency is one
of the key constraints, for example, in some mission-critical applications, such as non-
tolerance of DR or WASA linked to HEMs or AMI latency. Therefore, minimum delay
requirements should be satisfied by incentive-based networking solutions for time-sensitive
applications [109]. Latency can be improved by the integration of FL and edge devices.
Bandwidth and Networking Issues: Specific roles are based on the radio frequencies
in the low, medium, and high ranges for the incentive-based SG application requirements.
Medium and high frequencies are generally used for communication within short distances,
such as HMS. Meanwhile, when the low frequencies are compared to higher frequencies,
it becomes evident that linear and non-linear objects can be easily penetrated, and line of
sight problems can be avoided [110]. Issues of sensor networks, wireless networks, and
the internet, in general, would come under the umbrella of potential security concerns
associated with the network of SG [111]. Similar to the contemporary internet, various
networking technologies could be applied for incentive-based SG, including RS-232/RS-485
serial links, 3G/4G (WiMax), land mobile radio (LMR), fiber optics, Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G, 6G, and
many more. The grid environment’s requirements determine the need for specific net-
working technology, which remains an open issue in developing communication standards
for SG.
Throughput: Within a specific time interval, the total sum of data exchanged between
incentive-based SG components is referred to as the throughput. The characteristics of the
application determine the throughput utilization by the incentive-based SG for communi-
cation [112]. For example, the throughput needed for TLM or WASA would differ from
what is needed by AMI or DR communication. Throughput can be handled by using FL,
which is a distributed learning system, to boost the throughput.
Reliability: Reliability in incentive-based SG can be achieved using explainable AI. To
assign the incentive, the decision must be fair and reliable. Similarly, for the timely exchange
of messages in a successful manner, the specifications of a communication system determine
the reliability [113]. The specifications associated with reliability would vary across different
SG applications. Hence, the communication nodes need to have the reliability to ensure a
timely and successful exchange of information in the incentive-based SG.
Anomaly Issues: Timely and accurate detection of an outlier, faulty devices, and
anomalous events are needed for carrying out reliable operations in incentive-based
SG [114]. It is necessary to review methods of error detection and methods for coping with
them to deal with the faults within the power grid. It is necessary to study the models,
including systematic and malicious manipulation in these systems. ML and deep learning
techniques can efficiently detect and mitigate anomalies early.
Multiple Energy Sources, Service Providers, and Consumers: Incentive mechanisms
for the SG are usually designed with the primary focus on rewarding the customers and
the service providers [83]. However, very few research works have focused on the different
types of customers, service providers, and energy sources in the SG. If the incentive
mechanisms are designed based on the unique energy groups, it will benefit both the
customers and service providers, thus leading to a win-win situation.
Pricing: RTP schemes can be used for benefiting the power grids, retailers, and
consumers [115]. Pricing schemes can be designed by considering the preferences of the
subscriber and their usage patterns. Such a time-dependent pricing scheme can be used
for providing real-time incentives to the user as well. Interactions between the service
providers and customers prove helpful in this scenario.
5.2. Future Research Directions
Sustainability of SG: The capabilities of data collection, communication with comput-
ers for analysis, and advising for carrying out necessary actions were added for SG systems
in SGI 4.0. This self-customization, self-optimization, and self-cognition empower power

electrical services. These mechanisms should be added during the design of incentive-based
SG. Hence, close cooperation and interconnections are created among stakeholders such as
customers, workers, and systems [116].
An enormous volume of data is generated in a large-scale SG by autonomous and
multi-function equipment. The current approaches and environments for information
exchange are not suitable for handling the increased amount of data, which has dramatically
further intensified the complexity of systems, resulting in higher uncertainties. Meanwhile,
regarding flexibility, reliability, scalability, efficiency, latency, bandwidth, and data rates,
communication requirements for SGI 4.0 have increased. Hence, the trustworthiness of
information is assured by a non-traditional ICT infrastructure in real-time, across power
generation and distribution processes [117].
Need for Modernized SG: A variety of advantages are targeted in designing smart
incentive grids by using advanced ICTs for intelligent electricity. These goals span relia-
bility, security, efficiency, environmental concerns, safety, and RES [118]. Although some
contributions have been made by academia to address the challenges in the smart incentive
grid, there remain many unexplored issues in industry 4.0. An incentive SG paradigm
offers a platform, vision, and architecture with high-quality EGD. The significant princi-
ples of smart incentive grids are service orientation, real-time capability, virtualization,
decentralization, modularity, and interoperability. At the same time, the core features of
SG are service orientation, electricity generation process, optimization, intelligence, self-
organizing capability, secure communication, flexible adaptation, data integration, and
interoperability. The cost improves with the economic benefits of the smart incentive grid,
as the average energy production price is reduced. All of the above concerns should be
taken into consideration during the designing of incentive-based SG [119].
Human Role and Job Opportunities in Incentive SG: Despite the automation of pro-
cesses brought by SG, humans remain important for improving real-time grid performance
in terms of incentive security, efficiency, productivity, and power quality [120]. Hence, im-
provements in the design are anticipated for engineers and workers seeking better personal,
professional, social, and methodical proficiencies for achieving greater efficiency of power
generation at lower costs and lower consumption of resources in the grid. Various jobs, rang-
ing from process monitoring to machine controls, are created in SG. Higher mathematical
and computer programming competencies related to various simulation tools, Internet of
Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), iOS (https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/ios-15/,
accessed on 6 March 2022), and web technologies are needed to design incentive-based SG.
Furthermore, the smart incentive grid needs information processing, analysis, problem-
solving, data management, cyber security, networks, installation, cyber hardware, and
software-related hard skills. In addition to these, various soft skills cannot be ignored in
terms of their importance among IT specialists in this area, such as ethical, innovative,
leadership, interdisciplinary, and professional communication skills, learning capability,
adaptability, and systemic and proactive thinking. Hence, a detailed analysis of the roles is
needed.
Big Data: Complexity and knowledge intensification is introduced in SG by aggres-
sive developments in CPS and IoT technologies in SGI 4.0 [121]. Consequently, higher
accessibility and abundance of data emerged in SGI 4.0. Pervasive integration of radio
frequency identification, controllers, sensors, actuators, web-based applications, transac-
tional applications, and interactive servers in SGI 4.0 results in data accumulation for SG
applications. The purpose of data accumulation surrounds various applications in the SG,
such as demand and response, grid systems’ health data, energy-use data, metering data,
electricity price data, advanced control, and monitoring.
It is anticipated that with an increased number of CPS in distribution and advanced
electricity generation, data will grow dramatically in SG. However, academia has over-
looked an important amount of data. Hence, advanced collection, integration, processing,
storage, analysis, and data presentation systems must be developed for big data, linking all

Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2022, 6, 47 20 of 28
the data and entities. This remains a major challenge for realizing the industrial processes
of SGI 4.0.
Cloud Computing: High-performance computational techniques, along with big data
mining, cleaning, and storage, are needed by the intensive data generated from IoT-enabled
CPS sources in SG [122]. Cloud is a potential technology for employing service-oriented
technologies, IoT, CC, and virtualization, to aid the EGD model in transforming resources
into services. Cloud offers scalability and remote service access for any end-user of the SG.
The cloud is currently an essential platform for offering a stable connection between the
application and network layer components. Hence, the intelligence offered by the cloud
has suitable potential for covering the EGD life cycle inclusively, right from the inception
of its design to the testing and maintenance phase in SG. Virtualization technology in the
clouds empowers CC with flexible extensions, resource sharing, and other computational
layer features. Therefore, a wide range of services is offered by CC technology for users,
based on application requirements such as storage, hardware, software, access to systems,
and security in SG.
FL: Data privacy and data security are the two key concerns associated with data
sharing. FL techniques come to the rescue by training a model collaboratively among dis-
tributed devices without the need to share the data with a centralized server [123,124]. This
can be defined as a decentralized form of ML. This proves to be advantageous for SG since
local energy data remains private and need not be shared, even for cooperatively training
the model. After the inception of this technique by Google in 2016, various researchers have
focused on FL for finding privacy solutions associated with data sharing. Even though
researchers have focused on designing incentive mechanisms for various smart industries
using FL approaches, very few works have focused on its specific application in SG. How-
ever, with the benefits FL provides, especially regarding privacy, this area will benefit the
researchers in finding real-time solutions to the critical issues in the domain.
Power System Security: Apart from cyber security, physical vulnerabilities in the
power grid must also be investigated in future studies [125]. Massive deployment of new
devices will result in uncertain security, and suitable modifications in relevant standards
and regulations will be needed accordingly. There is a need to develop a graph-based model
combining both electrical and cyber grids to ensure the security of power grids. Cause-
effect relations in cyber-attacks can be studied using such models, and further research
could be done before the large-scale application of such ideas.
Accountability: It is well known that cyber security technologies can protect all
levels of current network infrastructure [126]. However, for the particular framework
of the SG, new risks and vulnerabilities continue to appear. Accountability is needed to
ensure integrity, confidentiality, and privacy for SG. Built-in accountability mechanisms
can identify the responsible elements even if a security issue exists. Such detection can
help fix problems through predefined programs, while expert evaluation presents valuable
information.
Table 5 presents the summary of challenges for incentive-based SG and possible
solutions.

Table 5. Challenges for Incentive-based SG and Possible Solutions.
Challenge Description Possible Solutions (Future Directions)
Data Quality • Many techniques have been proposed to assess and improve the data quality; however, due to huge
data generation from SG, data quality assessment and improvement is still a challenging task.
Record linkage, business rules, and similarity measures
Data Uncertainty • Data uncertainty is one of the major concerns for designing an incentive-based SG, as its attributes
include consistency, completeness, and accuracy in making decisions.
Cooperative game theory
Data Security • In incentive-based SG, financial transactions, commercial secrets, and consumer privacy information
are critical security concerns.
• It is critical to assess integrity, authentication, and private data security.
Blockchain and FL
Data Privacy • User insights into the behaviour of other users can be gained through data on power consumption,
and grid data present critical privacy concerns.
• In some cases, data companies are reluctant to offer the data even if the incentives are appealing, as
they will be cautious of their non-public and sensitive data being compromised.
Blockchain and FL
Data Integrity • Maintaining and assuring the consistency of data accuracy is highly important to achieve the
objectives of accurate incentive-based SG systems
Homomorphic signature scheme
Data Authentication • Authentication of data preserves privacy and ensures the integrity of data.
• Distinguishing legitimate and illegitimate identities can serve as the basis of authentication for
designing incentive-based SG data.
• For example, if an illegitimate identity enters the incentive-based SG system, there is a high chance
of error in distributing incentives.
Grid recognition authentication
Latency • Immediate transmission of data is needed; latency is one of the critical constraints. Integration of FL and edge devices
Bandwidth and Network-
ing Issues
• Specific roles are based on the low, medium, and high radio frequencies for the incentive-based SG
application requirements. Integration of FL and edge devices
• Medium and high frequencies are generally used for communication within short distances, such
as HMS.
5G, 6G
Throughput • The total sum of data exchanged between incentive-based SG components within a specific time
interval is referred to as the throughput.
• The characteristics of the application determine the throughput utilization by the incentive-based
SG for communication

Challenge Description Possible Solutions (Future Directions)
Reliability • The timely and successful exchange of messages, considering the specifications of a communication
system, determines the reliability.
• The specifications associated with reliability would vary across different SG applications.
Explainable AI
Anomaly Issues • Timely and accurate detection of an outlier, faulty devices, and anomalous events is needed for
carrying out reliable operations in incentive-based SG.
• It is necessary to review methods of error detection and methods for coping with them to deal with
the faults within the power grid.
AI-based solutions
Type of Energy Sources, Ser-
vice Providers, and Cus-
tomers
• Incentive mechanisms should be designed to consider the different types of customers, service
providers, and energy sources.
• It is necessary to review the mechanisms through which incentive mechanisms can be designed for
a unique group of customers/ service providers based on their energy usage.
ML-based solutions
Pricing • Pricing schemes in SG should be designed by considering customers’ types and usage patterns. Time-dependent pricing schemes

6. Conclusion
Global warming is one of the most alarming issues threatening life. The elimination
of this threat requires cooperation and support from all sectors of society to reduce global
CHG emissions. The use of traditional electricity generation and distribution systems
plays a significant role in CHG emissions, so efforts are being made to replace them with
low-carbon devices based on RES. This transition is necessary and can be considered the
only way to effectively reduce climate change, but it has associated challenges pertinent
to controlling electric power systems and their operation. This establishes the reasoning
behind the evolution of SG which use advanced sensing technologies to disseminate
all voltage levels and distributes energy, ensuring flexible transmission using two-way
communication networks. The SG infrastructure incorporates the integration of RESs that
reduce carbon emissions, promising a greener and healthier planet for future generations.
SG generates a huge amount of data that incorporate the smartness of the system. Big data
technologies [127] is used to ensure efficient and scalable data management in SG systems.
Big data technologies ensure the handling of all SG requirements, such as data processing,
data storage, and data visualization. The present study presents a comprehensive survey
of the state-of-the-art initiatives pertinent to implementing incentive mechanisms in SG.
The state of this sector is discussed to establish the background behind the use of incentive
mechanisms in SG. The state of the art in SG, the applications of incentive mechanisms in
general, and the underlying reasoning involved in implementing incentive mechanisms
in SG are discussed. The technologies and their relevant implementations in popular SG
projects, namely AI and ML, game theory, and blockchain, are discussed, highlighting the
relevance and utility of incentivizing SG in the present. To present a real-world perspective,
various incentivized SG projects and use cases implemented in different countries, namely
Andalusia, India, USA, China, France, and Brazil, are discussed. However, the present study
emphasized technologies like game theory, AI, and blockchain as the enabling technologies
to design incentivized SG frameworks. This could be further expanded by considering
other techniques, such as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), soft computing, and so
on. The information discussed in all of these sections leads to the identification of various
open issues in the aforementioned implementations, despite their promising benefits. These
open issues are related to data uncertainty, data security, data privacy, data integrity, data
authentication, latency, bandwidth/network issues, throughput, reliability, anomalies,
pricing, multiple energy sources, service providers, and consumers. These open issues
provide insight into possible future directions of research that would further help optimize
incentive-mechanism-based SG implementations, thereby fulfilling the dream of a better
and greener planet.
