1. Introduction
In Refs. [1,2], second-order partial differential equations (PDEs), invariant under the ĉga�
(� = 1
2 + N0) centrally extended conformal Galilei algebra [3], were constructed. They were
shown to possess a spectrum that is either continuous [1] or discrete (positive and bounded) [2].
In Ref. [1] the invariant PDEs were obtained via Verma module representation, while in Ref. [2] the
so-called on-shell condition was used (for the cases at hand the two approaches are proven to be
equivalent).
In this paper we address several important issues that were not touched on in these two previous
works. We name a few: the identification of the general class of invariant PDEs (which turns out
to depend on real parameters belonging to a fundamental domain), the existence of a contraction
algebra, the reason for the cryptohermiticity (here we use the word adopted in Ref. [4]) of the
discrete spectrum, the construction of the Hilbert space connected with Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators
with unbounded spectra, etc.

Specifically, the following list of results is derived in the present paper (we limit ourselves here
in the introduction to discussing the first nontrivial case obtained for � = 3
2 ; the � > 3
2 cases are
commented on in Sect. 8): two special differential realizations of ĉga� produce, as invariant PDEs,
Schrödinger equations with continuous and respectively discrete spectra. Both realizations depend on
a parameter γ �= 0. Unitarily inequivalent theories are recovered for γ belonging to the fundamental
domain γ ∈]0,+∞[.
The γ = 0 PDEs are decoupled equations. The continuum spectrum case corresponds to
the free Schrödinger equation in 1 + 1 dimensions, while the discrete spectrum case cor-
responds to a system of two decoupled crypto-Hermitian oscillators (namely, despite being
non-Hermitian, possessing the same spectrum as two decoupled oscillators with the given frequen-
cies). The parameter γ can therefore be regarded as a deformation parameter and as a coupling
constant.
Without loss of generality we can fix ω1 = 1 to be the energy mode of the first oscillator in the
coupled PDE. Then, the ĉga3
2
invariance of the PDE is recovered if the energy mode of the second
oscillator possesses the critical values ω2 = ±1
3 ,±3 (ω2 = 3 is the solution given in Ref. [2]). The
negative values correspond to an unbounded spectrum and, as explained later, are connected with
special cases of the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators. At fixed ω1,2, the spectrum of the operators does not
depend on the value of γ .
The γ → 0 limit of the ĉga3
2
algebra produces a contraction algebra that is a symmetry sub-
algebra of the decoupled systems. For the decoupled oscillators (the analysis can be limited to
the ω1 = 1, ω2 ≥ 1 domain without loss of generality), the PDE possesses a 9-generator
symmetry algebra at generic values, with enhanced symmetry at the critical values ω2 = 1 and
ω2 = 3 (two different 12-generator symmetry algebras are obtained at these special points). The
γ → 0 contraction algebra is an 8-generator subalgebra of the ω2 = 3, 12-generator decoupled
symmetry.
In this paper we discuss the subtle connection with Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators. The Pais–
Uhlenbeck model is a higher-derivative system [4–6] that admits, via the Ostrogradskiı̆ construction
[7], a Hamiltonian formulation. The Ostrogradskiı̆ Hamiltonian is canonically equivalent to a set of
decoupled harmonic oscillators with alternating (positive and negative) energy modes. In a series
of papers [8–12] the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators with energy modes given (up to a normalization
factor) by the arithmetic progression ωi = 2i− 1 were linked to the conformal Galilei algebras ĉga�
(with � = n− 1
2 ). As discussed in Sect. 8, the connection is rather subtle. To avoid any confusion, we
should stress that the symmetry operators considered here are required to be realized as first-order
differential operators.
The scheme of the paper is as follows: in Sect. 2 we present the (γ �= 0-dependent) differential
realization for the deformation of the free Schrödinger equation at � = 3
2 and the differential real-
ization for the coupled oscillator. The connection of the two differential realizations obtained by
similarity transformations and change of the time coordinate is shown in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 the most
general solution of the ĉga 3
2
-invariant oscillator is given. The symmetry of the decoupled oscillator
(with enhanced critical points at ω2 = 1 and ω2 = 3) is presented in Sect. 5. The � = 3
2 contraction
algebra in the γ → 0 limit is given in Sect. 6. The Hilbert space for the oscillators and the relation
with PT-symmetry is discussed in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8 the extension to the � > 3
2 cases and the relation
to Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators are commented on. Generalizations of the present construction are
discussed in the conclusion, Sect. 9.

2. Differential realizations of the conformal Galilei algebra ĉga 3
2
The d = 1 � = 3
2 centrally extended conformal Galilei algebra ĉga 3
2
consists of eight generators
(z0, z±, w±1, w±3, c), obeying the following nonvanishing commutation relations:
[z0, z±] = ±2iz±,
[z+, z−] = −4iz0,
[z0, wk ] = ikwk ,
[z±, wk ] = i(k ∓ 3)wk±2,
[w|k|, w−|k|] = (3− 2|k|)16c. (1)
In this section we introduce two differential realizations of the above algebra. As will be explained
in the following, the first differential realization corresponds to a symmetry of a deformed free
Schrödinger equation in 1+ 1 dimensions, while the second differential realization corresponds to
a symmetry of another system (possessing the same spectrum as two decoupled oscillators).
The first differential realization is a one-parameter (γ �= 0) extension of the differential realization
obtained in Ref. [1] via standard left action on the space of functions defined on the coset (see also
Ref. [13]). The presence of γ can be understood by the fact that the combined rescalings of the
space and time coordinates that preserve the conformal Galilei algebra structure lead to just one free
parameter. In this case we obtain first-order differential operators acting on functions of τ , x, y. They
are given by
z+ = ∂τ ,
z0 = −2iτ∂τ − ix∂x − 3iy∂y − 2i,
z− = −4τ 2∂τ − 4

τx − 3

The second differential realization is the γ extension of the differential realization presented in Ref.
[2]. It is given by the first-order differential operators acting on functions of t, x, y:
ẑ0 = ∂t ,
ẑ+ = e2it(∂t + ix∂x + 3iy∂y + ix2 + 2i),
ẑ− = e−2it

({w+1, w−3} − {w−1, w−1}) , (4)
where the curly brackets on the r.h.s. denote anticommutators.
The three operators �±1,0 close the sl(2) algebra, with �0 the Cartan element:
[�0,�±1] = ∓2�±1,
[�+1,�−1] = 4�0. (5)
It is important to note that, for both differential realizations (2) and (3), �0,�±1 are presented as
second-order differential operators.
For the differential realization (2) we have
�+1 = i∂τ − iγ x∂y + 1
2
∂2
x = iz+ − H+,
�0 = −2iτ�+1 = iz0 − H 0,
�−1 = −4τ 2�+1 = iz− − H−. (6)
The ĉga 3
2
on-shell invariant condition for �±1,0 (see Refs. [2,14,15] for a definition) is guaranteed
by the fact that their only nonvanishing commutators with the ĉga 3
2
generators are expressed as
[z0,�+1] = 2i�+1,
[z−,�+1] = 4i�0 = 8τ�+1,
[z+,�0] = −2i�+1 = τ−1�0,
[z−,�0] = 2i�−1 = 4τ�0,
[z+,�−1] = −4i�0 = 2τ−1�−1,
[z0,�−1] = −2i�−1. (7)

The degree 1 invariant equation
�1�(τ , x, y) = 0 ⇒ i∂τ� = −1
2
∂2
x� + iγ x∂y� (8)
is a Schrödinger equation with τ playing the role of a time coordinate. The parameter γ is a coupling
constant. This equation can be regarded as a γ -deformation of the free Schrödinger equation in 1+1
dimensions.

generators are expressed as
[̂z0, �̂+1] = 2i�̂+1,
[̂z−, �̂+1] = 4i�̂0 = 4ie−2it�̂+1,

is a Schrödinger equation with t playing the role of the time coordinate. The non-Hermitian operator
on the r.h.s. possesses a discrete and positive spectrum. The parameter γ is a coupling constant.
Equation (11) can be regarded as a γ -deformation of a decoupled “crypto-Hermitian oscillator"
discussed in the following.
3. Connection of the two differential realizations
The two differential realizations (2) and (3) of the ĉga 3
2
algebra introduced in Sect. 2 induce
Schrödinger equations from, respectively, degree 1 and degree 0 invariant operators.
The two differential realizations are connected via a similarity transformation coupled with a
redefinition of the time coordinate.
Let us denote as ĝ an operator entering (3) or (9) and as g its corresponding operator entering (2)
or (6). For convenience we introduce the operator X̂+ by setting, for ẑ+ in (3),
ẑ± = e±2it(∂t + X̂±), X̂+ = ix∂x + 3iy∂y + ix2 + 2i. (12)

The connection is explicitly realized by the similarity transformation
ĝ 
→ g = eS ĝe−S , (eS = eS2eS1),
S1 = tX̂+,
S2 = 1
2
x2, (13)
supplemented by the redefinition of the time coordinate
t 
→ τ = i
2
e−2it . (14)
The first similarity transformation (induced by S1) allows us to map
ẑ+ 
→ z̃+ = eS1̂z+e−S1 = e2it∂t = ∂τ , (15)
so that
�̂+1 
→ �̃+1 = eS1�̂+1e−S1 = ie2it∂t − H̃+1, (16)
with
H̃+1 = e2it
(
iX̂+ + etX̂+Ĥ0e−tX̂+
)
. (17)
Due to the commutators
[X̂+, Ĥ0] = 2iK̂+, [X̂+, K̂+] = −2iK̂+, (18)
where
K̂+ = 1
2
(∂x + x)2 − iγ x∂y, (19)
we obtain
H̃+1 = e2it (iX̂+ + Ĥ0 + K̂+
)− K̂+. (20)
The remarkable identity
iX̂+ + Ĥ0 + K̂+ = 0 (21)
implies that H̃+1 does not depend on the time coordinate (either t or τ ).
The second similarity transformation (induced by S2) allows us to express
�̃+1 
→ �+1 = eS2�̃+1e−S2 = i∂τ + 1
2
∂2
x − iγ x∂y (22)
in the form that reduces, in the γ → 0 limit, to the standard free Schrödinger equation in 1 + 1
dimensions.
One should observe that the similarity transformation preserves the symmetry properties of the
equations, mapping first-order invariant operators into first-order invariant operators.
The following commutative diagram is obtained:
coupled (γ �= 0) : Free0,±1
γ (τ )
S←→ Osc0,±1

The left- (right-)hand part of the diagram denotes the equations obtained from the differential realiza-
tions (2) and (3), respectively. The horizontal arrows indicate the similarity transformation together
with the change of the time coordinate, τ and t, respectively.
The three invariant PDEs (at degree 0,±1) are mapped into each other.
In the left-hand part, the deformed Schrödinger invariant PDEs correspond to deg 1 and possess a
continuous spectrum.
In the right-hand part the deformed Schrödinger invariant PDEs correspond to deg 0. They possess
a real, discrete spectrum that, as shown in Sect. 7, coincides with the spectrum of two decoupled
harmonic oscillators. We will call this system the � = 3
2 oscillator.
The vertical arrows denote the mapping to the decoupled systems. This mapping can be reached
in two ways:
i) the singular similarity transformation
g 
→ R1gR−1
1 , with R1 = eαy∂y (24)
(such that γ → e−αγ ) in the α→∞ limit1.
Despite the singularity of the limit, the invariant equations of the upper part of the diagram admits
as a nonsingular limit the decoupled equations of the lower part of the diagram. This similarity
transformation preserves the symmetry of the equations, mapping first-order invariant operators
into first-order invariant operators;
ii) the nonsingular similarity transformation
g 
→ R2gR−1
2 , R2 = e(
3i
8 γ x + i
8γ ∂x − 1
96γ
2∂y)∂y . (25)
This nonsingular transformation does not preserve the symmetry of the equation because some
of the transformed generators are no longer first-order differential operators.
The four Schrödinger equations associated with the commutative diagram (23), starting from the
upper right-hand corner and proceeding clockwise, are: (I) the � = 3
2 oscillator (11), (II) the decoupled
(i.e., γ = 0) � = 3
2 oscillator, (III) the free Schrödinger equation in 1+ 1 dimensions, and, finally,
(IV) the deformed free Schrödinger equation (8).
The three inequivalent (with constant, linear, and quadratic potentials; see Refs. [14–17])
Schrödinger equations in 1 + 1 dimensions invariant under the Schrödinger algebra are recovered
as restrictions of the � = 3
2 invariant PDEs. Indeed, if we introduce the x, y separation of variables,
the equation of the harmonic oscillator and the free Schrödinger equation are recovered by setting
∂y ≡ 0 from, respectively, Eqs. (I) and (IV). The linear Schrödinger equation is recovered from Eq.
(IV) after setting �(τ , x, y) = ψ(τ , x)φ(y), with the restriction ∂yφ(y) = kφ(y).
4. The general � = 3
2
oscillator
The ĉga 3
2
conformal Galilei invariance requires the coupling parameter γ �= 0. Since a unitary
transformation changes its phase, we can assume without loss of generality that γ belongs to the
fundamental domain γ ∈]0,+∞[.
1 For α real the transformation (24) is not unitary. The choice α = ln γ allows us to set γ = 1. The free
parameter γ ∈]0,+∞[ labels different unitarily inequivalent theories with testable consequences. See, e.g.,
the probability decay to the vacuum state presented in (62).

For γ real, the invariant PDEs in the left-hand part of the commutative diagram (23) are Hermitian.
This is not the case for the invariant PDEs in the right-hand part of the diagram. Under Hermitian
conjugation, the � = 3

ω = ±1
3
,±3. (28)
The ω↔ −ω change of sign is explained by the Hermitian conjugation. Understanding the ω↔ 1
ω
transformation is subtler. One should note at first that in the γ = 0 decoupled case the role of the
space coordinates x, y can be exchanged by performing the canonical transformation
y ↔ 1√
2
(x − ∂x), ∂y ↔ 1√
2
(x + ∂x).
Next, the coupling term is introduced in terms of the nonsingular similarity transformation given by
the inverse of Eq. (25). As it turns out, this procedure guarantees the conformal Galilei invariance of
the resulting PDE.
An explicit check of the symmetries of this class of PDEs proves that, in order to have the on-
shell invariant equations [̂z±, �̂0] = f± · �̂0, with f± arbitrary functions of the coordinates and
symmetry generators of the form ẑ± = e±iλt(∂t + X±) (X± time-independent operators and λ �= 0),
the following necessary and sufficient condition has to be satisfied: the two equations

−3λ2 + 3λ4 + 2λω + 4λ3ω − λ2ω2 − 2λω3 = 0, (29)
must be simultaneously solved. The only nonvanishing solutions for λ are encountered at ω = ±3
and ω = ±1
3 . Therefore, the ω = ±1
3 ,±3 critical values are special points of enhanced symmetry.
5. Symmetry of the decoupled � = 3

For a generic ω the following invariant operators can be encountered at degree 0,±1
2 ,±ω2 ,±1:
z± = e±2it(∂t ± ix∂x + iωy∂y + ix2 ± i
2),
z0 = ∂t + iωy∂y,
d = − i
2
∂t ,
c = 1,
wω = eiωt∂y,
w1 = eit(∂x + x),
w−1 = e−it(∂x − x),
w−ω = e−iωty. (31)
d is the degree operator. Explicitly, the degree is
± 1 : z±; 0 : z0, d, c;
±ω
2
: w±ω;
±1
2
: w±1. (32)
This 9-generator symmetry algebra closes the u(1)⊃+(sch(1) ⊕ h(1)) algebra, with nonvanishing
commutation relations given by
[d, z±] = ±z±,
[d, wk ] = k
2
wk ,
[z0, z±] = ±2iz±,
[z+, z−] = −4iz0,
[z0, w±1] = ±iw±1,
[z±, w∓1] = ∓2iw±1,
[w1, w−1] = −2c,
[wω, w−ω] = c. (33)
d is the generator of the u(1) subalgebra, while z0, z±, w±1, c generate the Schrödinger algebra sch(1)
and w±ω, c generate the Heisenberg algebra h(1).
The critical values ω = 1 and ω = 3 are points of enhanced symmetry for the decoupled system.
5.1. The enhanced symmetry for the decoupled ω = 1 system
At the critical value ω = 1 three extra generators are found at degrees 0 and −1:

They have to be added to the previous set of (generic) symmetry generators

where we have denoted, for ω = 1, w±ω entering (31) as “w±1b".
The extra nonvanishing commutation relations involving the qi generators are

[d, q2] = −q2,
[d, q3] = −q3,

[w1a, q3] = −2w−1b,
[q1, q3] = −2q2. (36)
The symmetry algebra closes as a nonsemisimple, 12-generator Lie algebra.
5.2. The enhanced symmetry for the decoupled ω = 3 system
At the ω = 3 critical value the three extra generators r−j, j = 1, 2, 3, of degree −j are encountered.
We have, explicitly,
r−1 = e−2ity(∂x + x),
r−2 = e−4ity(∂x − x),
r−3 = e−6ity2. (37)
Atω = 3 the symmetry algebra is a 12-generator algebra that differs from the 12-generator symmetry
algebra of the ω = 1 decoupled system.

6. The contraction algebra
A contraction algebra is recovered from (3) by taking the γ → 0 limit and by suitably rescaling the
generators. The contraction requires the rescaling ĝ 
→ g̃ = γ sĝ (̂g is any generator entering (3)),
with the power s given by
s = 0 : ẑ0, ẑ+, ŵ3, ĉ,
s = 1 : ẑ−, ŵ1, ŵ−1,
s = 2 : ŵ−3. (39)
The contracted 8-generator algebra expressed by z̃±, z̃0, c̃, w̃k (k = ±1,±3) is a subalgebra of the
full 12-generator symmetry algebra of the ω = 3 decoupled system with generators given by (31)
and (37). The identification goes as follows:
z̃+ = eS̃z+e−S̃ = e2it(∂t + ix∂x + 3iy∂y + ix2 + 2i),
z̃0 = eS̃(2id − 3i
2 c)e−S̃ = ∂t ,
z̃− = eS̃(12ir−1)e
−S̃ = 12ie−2ity(∂x + x),
w̃+3 = eS̃w+3e−S̃ = e3it∂y,
w̃+1 = eS̃(−2iw+1)e
−S̃ = 2ieit(∂x + x),
w̃−1 = eS̃(−4iw−1)e
−S̃ = 4ie−it(∂x − x),
w̃−3 = eS̃(48w−3)e
−S̃ = −48e−3ity,
c̃ = eS̃ce−S̃ = 1, (40)
with the similarity transformation given by S̃ = −3
2 it.

The contraction algebra corresponds to the 2D Euclidean algebra acting on two sets of cre-
ation/annihilation operators. We have the e(2)⊃+h(2) algebra, with nonvanishing commutators
given by
[̃z0, z̃±] = ±2ĩz±,
[̃z0, w̃k ] = kw̃k ,
[̃z+, w̃−1] = −4iw̃+1,
[̃z−, w̃+3] = 6iw̃+1,
[̃z−, w̃−1] = 2iw̃−3,
[w̃|k|, w̃−|k|] = (3− 2|k|)16̃c. (41)
7. Non-Hermitian deformed oscillators with real eigenvalues
The non-Hermitian operator derived from the degree 0 invariant equation (11) is
H0(γ ) = −1
2
∂x
2 + 1
2
x2 + 3y∂y + iγ x∂y + 3
2
. (42)
It may be written (see (3)) in the form
H0(γ ) = γ 2
16
(ŵ−1ŵ+1 − ŵ−3ŵ+3)+ 2. (43)
A discrete spectrum can be calculated algebraically from a lowest-weight representation. The ground
state ψ0,0 is defined by
ŵ+1ψ0,0 = ŵ+3ψ0,0 = 0. (44)
The solution of the above equations gives the explicit expression of the ground state (up to
normalization):
ψ0,0 = e−x2/2. (45)
The excited states are given by
ψn,m = ŵn−1ŵm−3ψ0,0. (46)
The corresponding eigenvalue En,m is computed by the commutation relations
[H0(γ ), ŵ−1] = ŵ−1, [H0(γ ), ŵ−3] = 3ŵ−3. (47)
One finds that the operator H0(γ ) has real discrete eigenvalues that are identical to the decoupled
harmonic oscillator eigenvalues:
En,m = n+ 3m+ 2. (48)

The explicit forms of the eigenfunctions are readily obtained from (3). We list some of them:

γ 2

e−x2/2−4it . (49)
In general, the excited-state wavefunctions have the form of
ψn,m = Pn,m(x, y)e−x2/2e−(n+3m)it , (50)
where Pn,m(x, y) is a degree n+m polynomial in x, y. The phase factor e−(n+3m)it is not essential to
the eigenvalue problem.
Following Ref. [4], we can call any non-Hermitian operator (such as (42)) with a real spectrum
“crypto-Hermitian". The operator (42), being invariant under the transformations x 
→ −x, y 
→
y, i 
→ −i, is PT-symmetric. Therefore, it belongs to the class of non-Hermitian PT-symmetric
operators (see Refs. [18–20]) with real spectra. It was pointed out in Refs. [21–23] that PT-symmetric
operators are often pseudo-Hermitian. It turns out that this is not the case for the operator (42), since
the similarity transformation (25) is not realized by a Hermitian operator. For this reason the stronger
notion of quasi-hermiticity, as well as the constructions based upon it (see Refs. [24–26]), is not
applicable in our context.
In Sect. 8 we discuss the connection of the operator (42) with a special class of Pais–Uhlenbeck
oscillators, recovered at given algebraic frequencies. It is worth mentioning that PT-symmetry in the
context of Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators (at arbitrary, unequal frequencies) was investigated in Refs.
[27–29].
In order to pave the way to discuss the connection between conformal Galilei algebras and Pais–
Uhlenbeck oscillators at special frequencies, we need to introduce the operator K(γ ), obtained from
(42) via a noncanonical transformation that preserves the canonical commutation relations, but does
not preserve the Hermitian conjugation property. Up to a vacuum energy constant, we can set
K(γ ) = a†a+ 3b†b+ 1
2
+ γ (a+ a†)b, (51)
through the positions
a = 1√
2
(x + ∂x), a† = 1√
2
(x − ∂x), b = 1√
2
(z + ∂z), b† = 1√
2
(z − ∂z), γ = i√
2
γ .
(52)
The two independent creation/annihilation operators (a, a† and b, b†) have nonvanishing commuta-
tors: [a, a†] = [b, b†] = 1.
The similarity transformation (25) maps K(γ ) into the decoupled Hermitian operator K(0) through
K(γ ) = RK(0)R−1, R = e−(
γ
2 a†b+ γ4 ab+ γ 2
48 b2). (53)

Since, as mentioned before, R is not Hermitian, K(γ ), for γ �= 0, is not a pseudo-Hermitian operator.
The operator K(γ ) acts on the Hilbert space L2(R2), the space of square-integrable functions
defined on the coordinates x, z.
One can read from the commutators
[K(γ ), Aλ] = λAλ (54)
which excited modes are created.
For any γ �= 0, the solutions of Eq. (54) are obtained for λ = ±3,±1
3 . The corresponding modes
are
A−3 = b,
A−1 = a+ 1
2
γ b,
A+1 = a† − 1
4
γ b,
A+3 = b† − 1
2
γ a† − 1
4
γ a+ 1
24
γ 2b. (55)
In this basis the nonvanishing commutators are
[A−i, Aj] = δij, (i, j = 1, 3). (56)
The non-Hermitian operator K(γ ) commutes with the “non-Hermitian analog of the number
operator", N (γ ). In terms of the Ak modes, the operators are given by
K(γ ) = 3A3A−3 + A1A−1 + 1
2
,
N (γ ) = A3A−3 + A1A−1,
[K(γ ), N (γ )] = 0. (57)
The Fock vacuum |vac > satisfies
a|vac >= b|vac >= 0, A−1|vac >= A−3|vac >= 0. (58)
The Hilbert space L2(R2) can be spanned by both sets of (unnormalized) states:
|n, m > = (a†)n(b†)m|vac >,
|n, m > = An
1Am
3 |vac > . (59)
The invertibility of the Bogoliubov-type transformation (55) implies that the |n, m > eigenstates form
a complete (albeit nonorthogonal) set that can be expressed in terms of the decoupled eigenvectors
|n, m > (the converse is also true).
We can therefore write
|vac >= |0, 0 >= |0, 0 > . (60)
The spectrum of K(γ ), N (γ ) coincides with the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and number operator of a
decoupled harmonic oscillator. |n, m > is an eigenvector for K(γ ), N (γ )with respective eigenvalues

Since the operators are non-Hermitian, their eigenvectors are nonorthogonal. This implies measurable
physical consequences. Let us suppose that we are able to prepare the system in a given common
eigenvector of K(γ ), N (γ ), let us say the state |1, 1 >. Following the standard rule of quantum
mechanics, we can compute the probability of this state collapsing, after a measurement operation,
to the vacuum state. A simple computation shows that the probability is p = |N < 1, 1|0, 0 >N |2
(|0, 0 >N , |1, 1 >N are the normalized states). In the case at hand we have
p = |γ |2
16+ 9|γ |2 . (62)
This probability is restricted in the range 0 ≤ p < 1
9 < 1. The deformation coupling parameter γ ,
via its squared modulus, has testable consequences.
8. Comment on Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators and the � ≥ 5
2
cases
The same spectrum of eigenvalues is obtained for
i) the coupled (γ �= 0) crypto-Hermitian operator (42),
ii) the decoupled (γ = 0) crypto-Hermitian operator, and (up to a vacuum energy shift)
iii) the Hermitian Hamiltonian (given by (51) for γ = 0) of two decoupled oscillators.
The construction of Sect. 7 can be repeated by starting with the Hermitian conjugate of the operator
(42). In this case the spectrum of the three resulting operators is unbounded. It is given, up to the
vacuum energy shift, by En,m = n − 3m. The Hilbert space of the decoupled harmonic oscillators
with energy modes 1,−3 continues to be L2(R2), obtained by applying the creation operators a†, b†
to the Fock state |0, 0 > (a|0, 0 >= b|0, 0 >= 0). Due to the unboundedness of the spectrum, |0, 0 >
can no longer be interpreted as the vacuum state.
The system with an unbounded spectrum is related to the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators. We recall
[4,5] that the Pais–Uhlenbeck model is a higher-derivative system. It admits, via the Ostrogradskiı̆

construction [7] (see Ref. [30] for a review), a Hamiltonian formulation. The resulting Ostrogradskiı̆
Hamiltonian is canonically equivalent to a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators with alternat-
ing (positive and negative) energy modes. The n-oscillator Pais–Uhlenbeck system is canonically
expressed as
Hn =
n∑
i=1
(−1)i+1ωia
†
i ai, (63)
where ωi ∈ R and the constraint ωi < ωi+1 is satisfied.
The harmonic oscillator with energy modes 1,−3 is a special case of the 2-oscillator Pais–
Uhlenbeck model. In a series of papers [8–12], the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators with energy modes
given (up to a normalization factor) by the arithmetic progression ωi = 2i − 1 were linked to the
conformal Galilei algebras ĉga� (with � = n− 1
2 ).
The present analysis proves that this association is rather subtle. We would like to stress that in this
paper we consider (as it is standard in PDE theory) the symmetry generators to be at most first-order
differential operators. In this respect the Pais–Uhlenbeck PDE given by the decoupled harmonic
oscillators does not possess any enhanced symmetry (not even at the special 1,−3 energy modes).
The PDE, invariant under the conformal Galilei algebra, is obtained for the coupled operator only for
γ �= 0. The decoupled operator (γ = 0) possesses the 12-generator symmetry algebra (introduced
in Sect. 6) that does not contain the conformal Galilei algebra as a subalgebra.
Even so, these results are not in contradiction with the findings in previous works on Pais–
Uhlenbeck oscillators. For example, in Ref. [9] it was shown that on the Hamiltonian level the
ω1 = 1,ω2 = −3 Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators possess the (centrally extended) 3
2 -conformal Galilei
symmetry in terms of Poisson brackets among conserved charges. It can be shown, on the other hand,
that at the quantum level, some of the Noether charges entering Eq. (39) in Ref. [9] are second-order
differential operators.
For general half-integer �, the invariant PDEs that possess the conformal Galilei algebra ĉga�
(for a definition, see Ref. [3]) as a symmetry algebra depend on � + 3
2 coordinates. The invariant
PDEs are deformations of decoupled equations, depending on �− 1
2 deformation parameters γj �= 0
(j = 1, . . . , �− 1
2 ). The decoupled systems are recovered in the limit, for any j,γj → 0.
The invariant PDEs with a continuous spectrum are
i∂τ�(τ , �x) =
(
−1
2∂
2
x1
+ i
∑�−1

j=1 γjxj∂xj+1

The energy modes ωi are normalized so that |ωi| = 2i− 1. The solution ωi = εi|ωi| with all positive
signs (∀i, εi = +1) corresponds to the bounded discrete spectrum discussed in Ref. [2]. By taking the
Hermitian conjugation, the solution with flipped signs, εi = −1 for all i, also leads to a ĉga�-invariant
PDE.
An explicit computation of the on-shell condition for � = 5

proves that the ĉga 5

explained above, the alternating choice (ε2 = −1, ε3 = +1) is related to a special case of three
Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators (with 1,−3, 5 energy modes).
An open problem is finding a general proof, valid for all half-integer �, that every choice of εi = ±1
signs leads to the ĉgal symmetry algebra of the PDE equation (65).
9. Conclusions
In this section we summarize the new results obtained in this paper.
We constructed the most general class of second-order PDEs, invariant under the d = 1 centrally
extended conformal Galilei algebras ĉga� with half-integer �, proving that they are Schrödinger
equations that are deformations of decoupled equations. For � = 3
2 the unique deformation parameter
is γ �= 0 (the decoupled systems being recovered in the γ → 0 limit).
At � = 3
2 the invariant PDEs with discrete spectra, besides γ , depend on two frequencies ω1,ω2
(entering the equation in nonsymmetric form). The invariance under ĉga�= 3
2
is only recovered at
special critical values of the ratio r = ω2
ω1
given by r = ±1
3 ,±3. The r = 3 value reproduces the
bounded spectrum presented in Ref. [2], while the negative values r < 0 produce an unbounded
spectrum that coincides with the spectrum of two Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators at the given ratio r.
We further investigated the symmetry algebra of the γ = 0 decoupled systems for a generic value of
r = ω2
ω1
, obtaining the following results. Enhanced symmetries are encountered at the critical values
r = ±1
3 ,±1,±3. Two inequivalent 12-generator symmetry algebras are recovered at r = ±1
3 ,±3
and r = ±1, respectively.
The ĉga�= 3
2
conformal Galilei algebra is not a subalgebra of the 12-generator, γ = 0 and r =
±1
3 ,±3, decoupled symmetry. From ĉga�= 3
2
, in the γ → 0 limit, a contraction algebra is recovered.
The contraction algebra (see Sect. 6) is an 8-generator subalgebra of the full r = ±1
3 ,±3 symmetry
algebra of the γ = 0 decoupled system.
As a corollary of this analysis we showed that the contraction algebra, rather than the conformal
Galilei algebra itself, is an enhanced symmetry of the r = −3 decoupled Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators.
Concerning the � = 3
2 PDE with a discrete spectrum, we showed that, besides the r = 3 real
bounded spectrum, a real unbounded spectrum is obtained at r = −1
3 ,−3. For all admissible val-
ues r the induced operators on the r.h.s. are not Hermitian. They are, nevertheless, PT-symmetric
[18]. They are not, on the other hand, pseudo-Hermitian [21], since the nonsingular similarity
transformations (see Eqs. (25) and (53)), mapping the coupled into the decoupled system, are
not realized by a Hermitian operator. The non-Hermitian operator (51) acts on the Hilbert space
L2(R2). Its real discrete spectrum coincides with the spectrum of two decoupled harmonic oscil-
lators. The Bogoliubov transformations relating the coupled and decoupled systems are explicitly
given.
For generic half-integer �, the number of nonvanishing deformation parametersγj is �− 1
2 . For � = 5
2
the arithmetic progression of ωi frequencies entering Eq. (65) and producing the ĉga�= 5
2
symmetry
algebra is given by ±1,±3,±5. The 1, 3, 5 sequence corresponds to the bounded spectrum, while
the 1,−3, 5 sequence corresponds to a special case of three Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillators.
The extension of this construction to the � = 1
2+N0 centrally extended conformal Galilei algebras
with d > 1 (see Ref. [3]) is immediate. The invariant PDEs with discrete spectrum correspond to
non-Hermitian operators whose spectrum is real and given by d copies of the energy modes created
in the d = 1 case.

In the class of systems investigated here, the oscillators all turn out to have different frequencies.
Equal frequency oscillators are obtained from a different class of second-order PDEs invariant under
