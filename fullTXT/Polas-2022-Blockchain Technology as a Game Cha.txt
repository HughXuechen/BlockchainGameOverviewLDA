Abstract: Blockchain technology has been heralded as a game changer for addressing severe envi-
ronmental and economic sustainability challenges. In response to rising environmental concerns,
blockchain technology (BCT) is transforming green innovation, culminating in green economic prac-
tices and well-established business models. Recognizing this, we investigated the role of blockchain
technology in green innovation practices and its impact on green economic sustainability, which has
an impact on green environmental sustainability. Moreover, 184 small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) were surveyed in Lima, Peru. Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered using stratified
random sampling. The positivist approach was implemented using a statistical induction method.
Prior studies’ research constructs were measured using validated measurement scales. For quantita-
tive data analysis, using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) framework,
this study provided two key findings. First, sustainability orientation and sustainability attitude
have a positive and significant effect on the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy
(solar) technology towards a sustainable green economy. Second, the intention to use blockchain
technology mediates the relationship between sustainability orientation and social perception with
the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a sustainable
green economy. We recommend that small- and medium-sized enterprises embrace green innovation
and blockchain technology to protect the environment and boost community cohesiveness.

1. Introduction
Technological advancements have made significant contributions to the development
of the economy and the advancement of humanity, such as through blockchain open
innovation. Because it is altering how economic transactions are carried out, blockchain
open innovation is one of the technological developments that has a lot of promise for
this progress [1,2]. Blockchain open innovation is already taking place all around the
world; it’s just an issue of scale or viewpoint [1,3]. Companies are now broadening its
reach, especially through digital tools, into a universal strategy that is spreading in all
directions, after keeping it purely for their local partners for so long. Individuals and small
businesses are now being targeted by businesses, and users and customers are becoming

“cocreators” and are actively involved. Because blockchain open innovation has constraints,
it needs to recreate itself on the basis of renewed trust and ideals that prioritize ethics [1,2].
Recognizing that BT is unmistakably occurring everywhere, it’s fascinating to observe how
blockchain open innovation may interact with blockchain technology, and one of the most
intriguing things for us is its ability to revolutionize innovation processes [3]. Using BT can
help us get closer to a fundamental rethink of how we conduct business and compete [3],
which is one of the primary aims of blockchain open innovation.
Green entrepreneurship is a fundamental driver of the green economy. Rapid economic
growth that uses green innovation has resulted in a significant increase in the consequences
of environmental concerns in Peru [1,2,4]. As a result, eco-innovation has become a critical
component in leveraging ecologically favorable opportunities and ecosystems to offset
natural resource depletion [3,5]. Consequently, green innovation is recognized as the
primary source of industry advancement, taking a variety of environmental considerations
into account. Businesses are seriously considering making green innovation methods
mandatory due to increased external demand from consumers (eco-friendly products), the
environment (pollution, groundwater quality), the community (health dangers), and the
government (governance of revenue). As a result, resource scarcity, expanding human
wants and preferences, community pressure, and government regulations push firms to
achieve a balance between long-term development and corporate expansion [2,3].
The notion of green entrepreneurship is growing in response to the need for sustainable
development [3,6]. The green economy, on the other hand, is viewed as a means of
achieving long-term prosperity and a higher standard of living. A green economy can
help with environmental challenges, resource use, and the wellbeing of people at the
bottom of the economic pyramid [5,7]. Numerous studies have shown that transitioning
to a green economy has far-reaching economic and societal consequences [4,7,8]. With
this level of logic, the “go green” message has been resonating all over the world. Green
entrepreneurship is also seen as one of the most essential tools used in the transition to a
green economy. As a result of the struggle for sustainability, an entrepreneurial attitude
based on an intrinsic talent for managing organizations has emerged. Entrepreneurship’s
significance in creating a wealthier and more environmentally sustainable society is only
now being recognized [7,9].
Blockchain technology is drawing the interest of a diverse variety of businesses,
including energy firms, startups, technology developers, and financial institutions, as
well as governments and academic institutions globally, as an emerging technology [5,8].
Several industry executives feel that blockchain technology has the potential to deliver
significant benefits and innovation. Blockchain technology, for example, was inspired
by decentralized digital currency [3,6]. Decentralization and its reliability in distributed
systems, as well as its secure data storage technique and zero exchange transaction costs, are
just a few of blockchain technology’s noteworthy characteristics. A blockchain is essentially
a distributed ledger network in which nodes communicate with one another to directly
trade data and transactions. A blockchain’s key characteristics are decentralization and
immutability [1,10–12].
Blockchain technology has the potential to improve the energy economy’s processes,
markets, and users, making it more environmentally friendly as a result. Green energy
can help to lessen the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions created by
current usage [13,14]. Businesses such as banks, manufacturers, small- and medium-sized
firms, and agricultural product manufacturers are already using blockchains to boost green
innovation that necessitates automation and remote sensors. Blockchain technology, by
establishing a secure and private mesh network, has provided Peruvian green innovation
with a new framework that reduces the risks associated with central server architecture.
Blockchain technology enables a safe and low-power architecture for remotely monitoring
physical activity without the use of traditional centralized cloud servers. This results in
a more ecologically friendly IoT ecosystem, also known as green innovation. Blockchain
technology is increasingly being employed in green innovation [14,15].

Most importantly, the emphasis on comprehending environmentalism and sustain-
ability strategic initiatives has proven that a green orientation can help firms’ principal
concerns and world natural resources. While green entrepreneurship is still seen as an
appropriate development strategy, the literature reveals that it is underutilized [16]. A
transformation in the public’s perspective and attitude toward green activities, particularly
in the workplace, is required for the green economy and sustainable development to take
root and take hold [17].
Promoting green innovation is a tough endeavor due to the specific characteristics
associated with standardized discoveries [3,18] in SMEs. To break free from the limited
sandbox of standards, SMEs must go outside their typical industrial knowledge base
for new sources of expertise, both within and externally. Firms, particularly small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), cannot create knowledge solely through their own re-
sources (research and development (R&D)). As a consequence, they communicate and
collaborate with rivals and external partners, using each other’s expertise, experience, and
assets, as outlined by the notion of open innovation using blockchain technology [5,19].
In the case of environmental-related green technologies, where internal and external in-
formation borders are becoming permeable, firms are increasingly relying on open green
innovation methodologies [6,20] using blockchain technology. A crucial policy concern for
addressing environmental challenges is the extent to which green ideas may be improved
through blockchain technology. Government authorities must intervene in this area to
eliminate the impediments that inhibit the green effect of inventive openness. Such im-
pediments can result in a pattern of failure in innovation [20], which can be avoided by
adopting green innovation behavior when working with external partners to extend their
knowledge base (and R&D) on green innovation and blockchain technology [6,10,19].
The study’s objective was to investigate the factors that influence the use of blockchain
technology for green innovation by employees of small- and medium-sized businesses in
Lima, Peru. Here, the positivist method was used to acquire empirical evidence through
the hypothetic deductive observation procedure [21]. Descriptive research is a study that
has well-defined problem statements, established assumptions, and a substantial amount
of data to support it [21,22]. A cross-sectional survey was utilized to choose 184 small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Lima, Peru. Using structural equation modeling, the
hypotheses’ direct and indirect impacts were examined. Few studies have used empirical
analysis to investigate the relationship between blockchain technology and the adoption of
green innovation and whether entrepreneurs are motivated to adopt green innovation via
blockchain technology in order to contribute to the green environment and green economic
development. We also discuss outstanding issues and future research areas that must
be taken into account when developing a sustainable green innovation ecosystem using
blockchain technology.
Finally, we aimed to identify the main drivers of green innovation within SMEs and
investigate the prospects of blockchain applications in this area that contribute to green
economic growth. The research questions are as follows:
RQ1: How is blockchain technology applied in business operations?
RQ2: What are the most important factors influencing green innovation in the small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector?
RQ3: What are the possible benefits to a country’s economic growth from implementing green
innovation utilizing blockchain technology?
A literature review is followed by the formulation of hypotheses, which is then
followed by a research technique that comprises the design of a research project, data
collection, and analysis of the results. Following that, the findings are scrutinized, including
the demographic features of the respondents, model assessment measurement, discriminant
validity, structural model evaluation, and hypothesis testing. The conclusion highlights the
study’s impact after a review of previous studies.

2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development
2.1. Blockchain and Open Innovation
When discussing blockchain and open innovation, the term “coopetition” comes to
mind. Indeed, with the new data science, classification algorithms, and artificial intelli-
gence methods, it is clear that for rivals to take advantage of a market, they must pool their
data [4,7,9]. To facilitate such sharing, a new type of governance based on the notion of a
common data repository is required. Full blockchain open innovation isn’t suited for all
use cases, isn’t straightforward to implement, and won’t be achievable if the network has
significant competitive pressures [7,11]. However, we believe that the most transformative
value can be generated when blockchain open innovation, BT, and other intelligent open-
source technologies are combined. Transparency and privacy in the service connection
between humans and technology are at the heart of the dynamic of individuals and orga-
nizations being trust-free in blockchain business services. Because it permanently stores
transaction history at every node of the blockchain, BT allows anyone to see the records of
each transaction they conduct [6,8,12,23]. Furthermore, because blockchain transactions
are recorded using public and private keys (i.e., lengthy strings of characters that no one
can read), persons can opt to remain anonymous in order to safeguard their privacy while
allowing other parties to authenticate their identity [6,10,24].
2.2. Sustainability Orientation
There are many various approaches to sustainability today, such as maintaining yield
to keep up with increased demand, preserving a desirable way of life for the future, and
promoting ecological balance [9,25–27]. All of the preceding ideas on sustainability are part
of a broader perspective on sustainability that encourages partnering with the environment
so that future generations are not deprived [11,28,29]. This approach is also stated to
aid in the operationalization of sustainability by capturing the conditions of economic,
environmental, and social components [9,30]. Persons who are more worried about the
environment are more inclined to participate in sustainability exercises [12,23,31,32].
It has been discovered that those who consider supporting sustainability while con-
ceiving the activities have a strong appreciation for the movement [11,12,24,33]. A business
strategy that integrates environmental and cultural issues is referred to as “sustainable ori-
entation” [27]. An examination of the notion of sustainability orientation reveals that it was
created with the sole purpose of supporting sustainable enterprise [23,31,34]. Numerous
studies reveal that there is a positive and significant relationship between sustainability
orientation and the adoption of green innovation [12,27,31]. Kuckertz and Wagner [28]
discovered the beneficial impacts of a sustainability orientation focused on green innovation
adoption in a study. Entrepreneurship is also said to have a keen and persuasive influence on
sustainability orientation [24,32,33,35]. As a result, we arrived at the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Sustainability orientation has a positive and significant relationship with the
adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a sustainable
green economy.
2.3. Sustainability Attitude
Attitude is described as “the extent to which a person has a negative or foreboding per-
ception or appraisal of the behaviour under consideration” [24,35,36]. People might have
either a positive or negative attitude toward a given object, which influences their motiva-
tion to adopt green innovation. Furthermore, numerous studies have found that a person’s
attitude is a big and powerful motivator of their entrepreneurial urge that affects their
intention to adopt green innovation [29,34,37]. According to Tih and Zainol [38,39], attitude
is also a significant factor in influencing pro-environmental intention and sustainability
commitment [37,40]. People’s propensity to engage in specific behaviors is influenced in
part by their own mental attitude. Furthermore, their way of thinking has a huge impact
on green entrepreneurial ambitions that impacts the adoption of green innovation [41–43].
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 5 of 19
Numerous entrepreneurship studies have found that attitude influences the adoption of
green innovation [39,42,44].
According to studies such as [45] and [44], researchers discovered that one’s attitude
influences one’s pro-environmental behavioral intention that leads to green innovation. Ac-
cording to [46], an individual’s positive or negative attitude may influence their motivation
to execute sustainable actions that lead to green economic sustainability. Ahmad et al. [47]
discovered that people’s environmental behavior was influenced by their attitude. As a
result, it was hypothesized that:
Hypothesis 2 (H2). Sustainability attitude has a positive and significant relationship with the
adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a sustainable
green economy.
2.4. Social Perception
Individual and group activities are influenced by social perception, which is an external
factor. The sense of societal pressure that a person has impacts whether or not they will
act [48]. Given that people are more concerned with how their social actions are seen by the
general public, we investigated the impact of social perception on personal conduct and
entrepreneurs’ intentions to adopt green innovation that employs green energy technology
and leads to green economic sustainability [49–51]. In general, social perception is one
of the external factors that influences whether or not other people or groups accept or
reject an individual’s actions or statements that drives them to adopt green innovation that
uses green entrepreneurship practices [33,36,43]. Social perceptions are also defined as a
person’s perception of social pressure to behave, whether positive or negative [29,43].
A growing number of studies claim that people’s drive to become more entrepreneurial
stems from their self perception in society, which increases their intention to adopt green
innovation and causes their green entrepreneurship practices to lead them to adopt green
innovation that employs green energy technology. People’s decisions to engage in such
acts are influenced more heavily by public opinion [43,51]. Today’s rural people are more
concerned with technological advancement, which gives them the courage to reject the
notion that they are on the bottom rung of civilization [36,51,52]. No matter where they live
on the planet, everyone has the same opportunities. Some of these people are well ahead
of where they would be in the nineteenth century in terms of scientific progress, which
was not even a consideration for both men and women. People can have positive emotions
in response to the stressors they see in society [50,52]. Rural people’s social perceptions
of society are becoming more positive and grateful, which affects their adoption of green
innovation intentions that use green entrepreneurship practices [33]. As a result, because of
social perception, persons in developing countries are more likely to start green innovation
adoption where they may use green energy technology that reduces CO2 and leads to green
economic sustainability. Thus, it was hypothesized that:
Hypothesis 3 (H3). Social perception has a positive and significant relationship with the adoption of
green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a sustainable green economy.
2.5. The Importance of Blockchain Technology in Green Innovation That Employs Green Energy
Renewable energy sources have lately emerged as a crucial consideration for blockchain
technology adoption due to their lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuels.
Wind, geothermal heat, sunlight, and rain are all renewable energy sources that can be
used to generate electricity [18,19,49,53–56]. Clean, renewable energy is produced as a
result of the use of these resources. Due to improvements in renewable energy technolo-
gies, people can now generate their own electricity without relying on expensive fossil
fuels [36]. This is where the smart grid comes in, allowing us to make use of all of the
free and abundant green energy sources surrounding us. The smart grid, which is a mod-
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 6 of 19
ernized electrical system, makes use of information technology and analogue or digital
communications [20,43,57–61].
Furthermore, the difficulties of security, interoperability, and data transfer are critical
to smart grids. The fluctuating and unpredictable character of renewable energy sources
necessitates the incorporation of complex technology into the current network [40,62,63]. A
blockchain-based smart-grid design is used to incentivize the use of renewable resources
and construct a better environment. The proposed paradigm is based on the inverted
application of the recently introduced forking attack to the blockchain. In the energy grid
concept, stakeholders are represented by a central authority and distributed peers. This
technology is promising and could be used to improve ethical smart grid systems in order
to build a greener planet [64–66].
The application of green certificates in an industrial operating system may be achieved
using blockchain technology. The possibility of peer to peer energy exchanges using a
microgrid design and blockchain [67] was investigated. It is believed that a blockchain-
based system could be used to accurately assess and monitor the environmental impact
of energy-related assets [67,68]. It is possible to go greener as a result of blockchain’s
potential to improve the energy supply chain. Blockchain technology has enabled energy-
sharing economy applications, leading to various authors advocating new market models
and the democratization of energy supplies [69–71]. Blockchains, when combined with
smart contracts, promise transparent, tamper-proof, and secure platforms capable of de-
livering creative, environmentally responsible business solutions [72,73]. Thus, it was
hypothesized that,
Hypothesis 4 (H4). The intention to use blockchain technology mediates the relationship between
sustainability orientation and the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar)
technology towards a sustainable green economy.
Hypothesis 5 (H5). The intention to use blockchain technology mediates the relationship between
sustainability attitude and the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar)
technology towards a sustainable green economy.
Hypothesis 6 (H6). The intention to use blockchain technology mediates the relationship between
social perception and the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology
towards a sustainable green economy.
Figure 1 reveals the framework of the study. Figure 1 illustrates the hypotheses that
there is a positive and significant relationship between the adoption of green innovation
and sustainability orientation, sustainability attitude, and social perception (H1, H2, H3).
Furthermore, it illustrates the hypotheses that the intention to use blockchain technology
mediates the relationship between the adoption of green innovation and sustainability
orientation, sustainability attitude, and social perception (H4, H5, H6).

3. Methodology of the Study 
3.1. Study Context 
This study focuses on Peruvian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Man-
ufacturing accounts for roughly one-third of global energy consumption and CO2 emis-
sions [74]. Peru is the greenest city among the top greenest cities in the world [75]. In 
contrast, a “green worldview” has grown in popularity in recent years [76]. This probe is 
made much more necessary by the current situation of the law. The Paris Climate Accord 
has a direct impact on Peru. Our research provides a current assessment of the impact of 
environmental management issues on green entrepreneurship and green innovation as 
well as firm success.  
3.2. Research Design 
A positivist approach was adopted, which allows deducing empirical knowledge 
from data-driven hypotheses [21]. Because there were so many factors, a comprehensive 
quantitative investigation was also conducted. [22]. Peruvian firms were ideal subjects for 
this study because the Peruvian government has implemented a number of sustainability 
policies and has established a number of training initiatives to encourage participation in 
the production of environmentally friendly green technologies in manufacturing. 
3.3. Questionnaire Design 
A total of five variables were used in the final survey, which included 25 questions. 
To confirm the validity of the questionnaire’s content, a pretest had to be conducted before 
the final survey was executed. Four sustainability orientation items were used to construct 
the survey instrument adopted from Appendix A [76]. It was based on [77] that the four 
sustainability attitude items were adopted. Social perception has been adopted from [78]. 
Four items adopted from [79,80] were used to measure the intention to use. Green inno-
vation was measured by adopting four items from [81]. Likert scales ranging from 
strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) were employed to measure the constructs 
3.4. Sampling and Data Collection 
More than 216 rural SMEs in Lima, Peru, were provided as self administered ques-
tionnaires between September and October 2021. It was possible to select a representative 
sample of 184 complete and valid responses. Due to a lack of specifics, 32 responses went 
missed. A lack of confidence in the survey could be a factor. Only face-to-face participa-
tion was permitted. As a whole, our results are in line with the standards set out by [82]

3.4. Sampling and Data Collection
More than 216 rural SMEs in Lima, Peru, were provided as self administered ques-
tionnaires between September and October 2021. It was possible to select a representative
sample of 184 complete and valid responses. Due to a lack of specifics, 32 responses went
missed. A lack of confidence in the survey could be a factor. Only face-to-face participation
was permitted. As a whole, our results are in line with the standards set out by [82] for
a sufficient sample size. Our survey’s response rate was 85.19 per cent, according to a
survey-based sample. The study’s findings were then tested by a survey of 184 participants.
Everyone in the study was made aware of the fact that their data would be kept confidential
and that they had given their consent to participate in the research. It was also noted that
the data could only be used for research purposes. In advance of launching the final survey,
a pilot study involving a total of 16 participants was completed. These respondents are not
included in the final survey.
Data from stratified random sampling were processed by a team of locally trained
research assistants. Our limited resources were better managed thanks to random stratifi-
cation. For each respondent who took the survey, it took no more than a few minutes to
complete. Using a double-back translation method, the primary survey was translated into
Spanish to better understand the respondents. It was possible to carry out the time trend
extrapolation test that was described by [83] and widely used in business, psychology, and
academics by implementing the nonresponse bias. Nonresponse bias cannot be seen in
our findings because we compared early respondents (the first 25%) to late respondents
(the last 25%). VIF values more than 10 but less than 0.1 indicate the presence of multi-
collinearity, according to [84]. Because the inner VIFs in this investigation were less than 5,
multicollinearity was not an issue in this study.

3.5. Data Analysis
An SEM (structural equation modelling) validation was performed on the research
model to ensure its accuracy. Smart PLS 3.2.9 was used to test the data analysis and study
model’s feasibility, reliability, and validity. We were able to obtain a required sample size
for SEM analysis using the minimum R-square method suggested by [84]. As a result,
PLS-SEM is the most accurate method for predicting outcomes. Both measurements and
structural models can be simultaneously handled by it. In addition, it is a useful method
for analyzing complex route models [85]. Small sample volumes may be handled by the
PLS-SEM while still delivering highly accurate results for the first time. As a result, PLS-
SEM was an appropriate tool for our investigation. Measurement and structural mode was
evaluated using the alpha coefficient and other statistical tests such as convergent validity
and discriminant validity.
3.6. Mediation Analysis
As stated by [86], a two-step technique was employed to explore the mediating
influence of the intention to use in this study, by looking at the impact of SO, SA, and SP
on green innovation adoption through intention to use in the first step. The indirect effect
of SO → IU → GI and SP → IU → GI were significant in this study (details are given in
Section 4.5. Using SO, SA, and SP without eliminating the mediator (IU), the researchers
looked at the effects on the GI for H4 and H6. Furthermore, the positive sign of these
indirect and direct effects was observed; it is possible to conclude that SO → IU → GI has
full complementary mediation that supports H4. Complementary partial mediation thus
supports H6 (SP → IU→ GI).
4. Results and Analysis

4.2. Model Measurement, Validity and Reliability
Table 2 shows the model’s evaluation. The outer loading can be as high as 0.50 [87].
Table 2 shows that the outer loading of the study is more than 0.50. If the composite
reliability score is greater than 0.70, it is advised that the internal consistency of the reliability
be evaluated. As shown in Table 3, the overall reliability of the study is more than or equal
to 0.70. Vinzi et al. [88] suggests that the Cronbach’s alpha be greater than 0.70. Table 2
shows that the Cronbach alpha is more than 0.70. As a result, all constructs with the same
value disclose Cronbach’s alpha criteria. The convergent validity was estimated using the
average variance extracted (AVE) [88]. In order for convergent validity to hold, the loading
factors of both items must be more than 0.50. Table 2 displays AVE values greater than 0.50.

Table 2 shows that in order to compute R2, we had to take into account changes in the
endogenous variable. It was proposed [89] to use three different R2 values (R2 of 2%, R2 of
13%, and R2 of 26%) to evaluate the three distinct impacts. In other words, independent
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 10 of 19
factors have a considerable impact on the intention to use (0.903 or 90.3 percent). The
intention of respondents to use could have a significant impact on whether or not they
adopt green innovation as a strategy (0.912 or 91.2 percent). The model’s NFI is near to
one, indicating that it was well-suited to the study’s objectives [85]. Low SRMR values of
0.08 imply that the model was appropriate for these data [85]. In this case, the NFI is high,
at 0.901.
The model’s ability to predict outcomes is seen in Table 3. In other words, the model’s
predictive value is greater than zero [90]. Cross-validated communality methodologies
are used to evaluate the predictive value of the well-established PLS path model. As seen
in Table 3, the model has predictive relevance. Finally, the intention to use has a medium
impact on green innovation adoption. Overall, the model has an outstanding fit and a high
degree of prediction accuracy.
4.3. Discriminant Validity
4.3.1. Fornell–Larcker Criterion Analysis
Table 4 shows a comparison of the square roots of latent variables (LVs) and AVEs. In
order to determine the model’s validity, we used the Fornell–Larcker [91] criterion. AVE (in
bold) for all variables is equal to the square root of the number in this range (0.839–0.880).
As a result, the variables’ discriminant validity was preserved and identified for use in the
current study model.

The diagonal values are the square root of the AVE (in bold) of the latent variables and indicates the highest in
any column or raw. Note: LV—Latent variable.
4.3.2. Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) Analysis
When the discriminant validity was tested, it was discovered that HTMT values were
always less than 0.85 (Table 5). The discriminant validity of the variables was validated
using an HTMT value of 0.85 [92].

Note: Discriminant validity exists if the HTMT < 0.85 (Henseler et al., 2005); Discriminant validity exists if the
HTMT <0.90 (Gold et al., 2001).
4.3.3. Cross Loads
Load values or crossing loads [91] determine the discriminant validity that exists only
when load values are greater than the original load values. Crossing load values would be
undesirable if the major diagonal values and correlations between latent variables (LV) and
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 11 of 19
square roots of AVE values were more dissimilar. The model’s validity was maintained by
displaying AVE values in (see Table 6) between the LV and the square roots.

innovation (β = 0.229, t = 3.701; p < 0.05, see Table 7). In this aspect, we can infer that our

The first hypothesis proposed that sustainability orientation has a positive and signifi-
cant relationship with the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar)
technology towards a sustainable green economy. According to the findings, sustainability
orientation was found to be positively associated with the adoption of green innovation
(β = 0.229, t = 3.701; p < 0.05, see Table 7). In this aspect, we can infer that our original
hypothesis was supported. Studies conducted by Guo et al. [94] and Weng et al. [95]
support this hypothesis.
The second hypothesis proposed that sustainability attitude has a positive and signifi-
cant relationship with the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar)
technology towards a sustainable green economy. According to the findings, sustainabil-
ity attitude was found to be positively associated with the adoption of green innovation
(β = 0.264, t = 3.062; p < 0.05, see Table 7). In this aspect, we can infer that our origi-
nal hypothesis was supported. The findings of Yousaf [96] and Guo et al. [97] support
this hypothesis.
The third hypothesis proposed that social perception has a positive and significant
relationship with the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) tech-
nology towards a sustainable green economy. According to the findings, social perception
was not found to be positively associated with the adoption of green innovation (β = 0.116,
t = 1.306; p < 0.05, see Table 7). In this aspect, we can infer that our original hypothesis
was not supported. The findings of Wang et al. [98] and Zhang et al. [99] do not support
this hypothesis.
Furthermore, in the fourth hypothesis, it was assumed that the intention to use
blockchain technology mediates the relationship between sustainability orientation and
the adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a
sustainable green economy. Green innovation adoption and sustainability orientation were
discovered to be linked through a mediating role of intention to use (β = 0.103, t = 2.624;
p < 0.05, see Table 7). This evidence supports our fourth hypothesis.
Moving forward to the fifth hypothesis, it was assumed that the intention to use
blockchain technology mediates the relationship between sustainability attitude and the
adoption of green innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a
sustainable green economy. Green innovation adoption and sustainability orientation were
revealed to be unrelated due to the mediating impact of intention to use (β = 0.065, t = 1.226;
p > 0.05, see Table 7). This evidence does not support our fifth hypothesis.
Moreover, in the sixth hypothesis, it was assumed that the intention to use blockchain
technology mediates the relationship between social perception and the adoption of green
innovation that employs green energy (solar) technology towards a sustainable green
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 13 of 19
economy. Green innovation adoption and social perception were discovered to be linked
through a mediating role of intention to use (β = 0.203, t = 3.382; p < 0.05, see Table 7). This
evidence supports our sixth hypothesis.
5. Conclusions
Blockchain technology has the potential to improve the administration of energy
systems, financial markets, e-governance, and smart cities, resulting in a greener IoT
ecosystem and green innovation [100]. Finally, there is blockchain technology where
transactions are safe, transparent, and unalterable, and they are protected against tampering.
Blockchain technology is rapidly adopting IoT research and development technology and
is capable of overcoming issues and bottlenecks. Blockchain technology is increasingly
becoming popular [101]. As a result, the focus of this study was on the role that blockchain
technology may play in developing a more environmentally friendly Internet of things
ecosystem, as well as critical factors that can be addressed via blockchain technology. The
objective of this study was to provide a timely and convenient assessment of blockchain
in the green IoT sector. When creating a sustainable green IoT ecosystem that ultimately
contributes to the growth of the green economy, the findings show unresolved issues and
future research directions that should be addressed.
According to the findings of this study, sustainability orientation, sustainability atti-
tude, and social perception all play an important role in the establishment of green mindsets
and endeavours. The findings of this study on green innovation may assist the government
of Peru in developing a mindfulness program or educational program framework that fo-
cuses a stronger emphasis on green innovation and sustainability economy. Because of their
ability to produce more environmentally friendly firms, these activities have the potential
to help Peru achieve its goal of becoming a green economy. To ensure that economic gains
completely adhere to the green agenda, the green economy focuses on cultivating green
innovation and a green mindset among small- and medium-sized business entrepreneurs.
This is an absolute requirement. The findings of the study will encourage the development
of sustainability in organizations as well as the evaluation of green entrepreneurship that
avoid acts that harm the natural environment in order to boost the value of associations.
Eco-friendly entrepreneurship has the ability to significantly influence how businesses
run. Sustainability as a value and the drive to profit go hand in hand, resulting in a firm
philosophy that is both environmentally and socially responsible.
6. Implications of the Study
This study contributes to the green economy by offering an up-to-date, academically
led assessment of the energy sector. Initial blockchain technology research focused on
system architectures, distributed consensus processes, and performance difficulties. The
authors of this study then explored the benefits of blockchain technology in connection to
various energy use scenarios. Following that, we performed a thorough assessment of a
wide range of blockchain activities, highlighting the specific areas in which energy system
stakeholders and industrial parties are pursuing green innovation [102]. We discovered
that most projects are still in the early stages of development, and research on crucial
improvement areas that would allow for desired scalability, decentralization, and security
is still happening. A multitude of impediments, including legal, regulatory, and competitive
constraints restrict the widespread implementation of blockchain technology, which has
the potential to jeopardize energy firms. Research, testing, and collaborations will indicate
whether the technology can reach its full potential, demonstrate commercial feasibility, and
finally be accepted by the general community in its entirety.
Furthermore, the findings provide motivation and excitement for the continuation
of green entrepreneurial firms, particularly among small- and medium-sized businesses
(SMEs). The purpose of the project was to inspire and educate future entrepreneurs about
green entrepreneurship by fostering entrepreneurial mindsets and intentions that are
strongly related to sustainability orientation, sustainability attitude, and social perception.
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2022, 8, 62 14 of 19
This would lead to more growth, as well as more sustainable behaviors and a more sustain-
able style of life [80,103]. According to the study’s results and conclusions, people are more
likely to believe they have all of the knowledge needed for a new endeavor. Finally, this
research contributes to the body of information on how to enhance eco-economic success
through the development of national habitats [80,103–106].
Moreover, in order to successfully deliver robust green innovation performance, it is
proposed that technological absorptive ability be combined with technological orientation,
Industry 4.0, and open innovation perspectives. Firms should encourage collaborative
innovation initiatives that focus on green innovation and a long-term view. Not only
will they contribute to ecological and environmentally friendly innovation for long-term
gain, but certain governments also give tax advantages and bonuses for green innovation,
allowing businesses to profit from these incentives and lower their expenses. In this context,
open innovation-based partnerships might help to promote green innovation, which is
seldom achieved without incentives in the usual course of business [107–113].
7. Limitations and Directions for Future Research
Like some other studies, this study is not beyond limitations. This study focuses on
Peruvian entrepreneurs in Lima where a quantitative methodology was used to assess the
magnificence of green innovation. The cross-sectional data were used to achieve the study
objectives. It was difficult to collect data from SME entrepreneurs as the number of samples
is small in this study. Only one location was used to collect data from respondents. Finally,
the use of a survey questionnaire limits the area of the research even further. As a result, we
urge that further study be performed in a variety of national contexts, as well as in economic
sectors other than the SMEs sector. Furthermore, these additional economic sectors offer
exciting prospects for future research, which might include green economy social ventures.
Ideas of sustainability transformations can finally be used when it comes to understanding
the role that businesses play in the green economy. The boundless potential of blockchain
technology and its problem-solving abilities will profoundly alter the landscape of efforts
to develop a long-term green innovation ecosystem. The research direction for this study
will provide the framework for future study and urge scholars to thoroughly investigate
the application of current theories to better explain new phenomena at the junction of
blockchain technology and the green innovation ecosystem. Future research should focus
on Gen Z and Y to understand their nascent entrepreneurial propensity that leads to adopt
green innovation using green entrepreneurship practices.
We suggest that policymakers and strategists incorporate the open innovation method,
which is a commonly used approach in innovation management, in the context of boosting
green innovation. Furthermore, we propose that because our study focused on SMEs,
which are typically in greater need of open innovation due to limited resources and a
low risk-taking proclivity. We looked at the supplied factors in Peruvian SMEs in general,
regardless of their function, influence, and implementation in specific industries. As a
result, we recommend that future studies analyze sectors such as electrical and electronics,
chemical, and others separately, and then compare their levels of green innovation success.
