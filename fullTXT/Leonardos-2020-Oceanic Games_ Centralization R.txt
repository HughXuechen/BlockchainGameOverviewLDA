Oceanic Games: Centralization Risks

Abstract To participate in the distributed consensus of permissionless blockchains,
prospective nodes—orminers—provide proof of designated, costly resources. How-
ever, in contrast to the intended decentralization, current data on blockchain mining
unveils increased concentration of these resources in a few major entities, typically
mining pools. To study strategic considerations in this setting, we employ the concept
of Oceanic Games [27]. Oceanic Games have been used to analyze decision making
in corporate settings with small numbers of dominant players (shareholders) and
large numbers of individually insignificant players, the ocean. Unlike standard equi-
libriummodels, they focus onmeasuring the value (or power) per entity and per unit
of resource in a given distribution of resources. These values are viewed as strategic
components in coalition formations, mergers and resource acquisitions. Consider-
ing such issues relevant to blockchain governance and long-term sustainability, we
adapt oceanic games to blockchain mining and illustrate the defined concepts via
examples. The application of existing results reveals incentives for individual miners
to merge in order to increase the value of their resources. This offers an alternative

1 Introduction
Decentralization is a core element in the design of permissionless blockchains. To
participate in the blockchain consensus mechanisms, prospective network nodes—
also calledminers—need to provide proof of some costly resource. This resourcemay
be computational power in protocols with Proof of Work (PoW) selection mecha-
nisms, [15, 28], or coins of the native cryptocurrency in Proof of Stake (PoS) selection
mechanisms, [5, 8]. Under default conditions, the selection is proportional tominers’
resources and hence, it depends on their actual distribution. An integral assumption
in the security philosophy of permissionless blockchains is that the network of min-
ing nodes remains “sufficiently” decentralized and distributed. In the extreme case,
sufficiently means that no single entity holds 50% or more of the resources but in
practice much more fragmentation may be desired to safeguard the safety properties
of the underlying protocol [3, 11, 22].
With this in mind, the picture illustrated in Table1 is disconcerting. Table1 shows
the distribution of blocks among miners in the two largest1 cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin
and Ethereum, and indicates that the desired assumption of a highly decentralized
(and distributed) network is currently not satisfied. As can be seen, the vast majority
of mining resources is concentrated in a small number of “major” nodes or mining
pools in which individual miners join forces to reduce the variance of their payments
[14, 34]. The rest is scattered among a large number of minor and individually
insignificant miners. The discrepancy between the intended distribution and the con-
centration of resources that is observed in practice raises some questions. What is
the actual power of such pools or major miners to influence the evolution of the
blockchain? Does this distribution create incentives for mergers and formation of
coalitions (cartels) that will seize control of the majority of resources and manipu-
late the blockchain [24, 26]? What strategic considerations arise and what are their
implications on blockchain governance and long-term sustainability?
Similar questions have been examined by conventional economics in the context
of corporate governance. To study interactions between shareholders with various
degrees of power in particular, [27] developed the model of Oceanic Games. These
are games featuring a mixture of few large players (shareholders) and a contin-
uum of infinitesimal players, called the ocean, each of which holds an insignifi-
cant fraction of corporate shares. The resemblance with blockchain mining—with

shares corresponding to units of mining resources—is apparent. Our goal in this
paper is to explore incentives in blockchain mining from the perspective of Oceanic
Games and complement existing studies that focus on safety and security related
issues [9, 13, 29].
The central idea in the literature of Oceanic Games is the measurement of a value
for each entity and for each unit of resource given the distribution of resources among
shareholders. The concept of value is considered as a powerful tool in the theory of
decision making [2, 31, 33] and [32]. For instance, if a miner holds 51% of the total
resources, then each of her units is worth much more than if she holds only 49%
of the total resources, since in the former case, the entirety of her shares gives her
absolute control over the blockchain. Similar, but maybe less obvious considerations,
arise also in intermediate cases. If a miner holds 49% of the resources and a second
miner holds 2% of the resources, then both miner’s resources value higher than in
the case in which the first miner only holds 47% of the resources, since in the former
case, the two miners may collude and jointly seize control of the blockchain.
Motivated by these considerations, we adapt the model of Oceanic Games from
[27] on blockchain mining. Our aim is to measure the value of mining resources
per miner and per unit of resource as a strategic component in the process of power
gain and coalition formation between mining nodes. With this approach, we shift our
attention from safety attacks and equilibration models, [12, 20], to the understanding
of incentives related to the distribution and acquisition of protocol resources. The
analysis of these issues is relevant to the broader subjects of long term sustainability
and blockchain governance [7].

Based on the above, our contribution in the present paper can be summarized in
the following points
– We model instances of blockchain mining as Oceanic Games: the discrete set
of large players corresponds to the large mining nodes, typically mining pools,
and the continuum of infinitesimal oceanic players to the remaining, individual
miners, cf. Fig. 1. Conveniently, the resulting model does not depend on the under-
lying selection mechanism (PoW, PoS or similar) or consensus protocol and hence
can be used for the study of resource acquisition, strategic interactions, coalition
formations (mergers) and governance related issues in a broad spectrum of per-
missionless blockchains [4, 9, 10, 16, 18, 21, 30]. We extend an example of [27]
to illustrate the defined concepts in blockchain context.
– The application of existing results uncovers incentives for the formation ofmergers
between miners. Starting from an initial distribution in which the oceanic players
control the majority of resources, we use simulations to show that this holds in
two instances: first, in the formation—crystallization—of a coalition out of the
ocean and second, in the exogenous acquisition of additional resources by a group
of individual miners who, nevertheless, have the ability to coordinate their actions
(collude). In both cases, the value of the miners’ resources is higher when they
act as a single entity rather than individual, oceanic players. This result provides
an alternative perspective to the observed centralization in cryptocurrency mining,
cf. Table1.
– Further numerical simulations demonstrate that the above conclusions do not hold
in thewhole range of parameters. Instead, the dynamics of coalition formations and
entry barriers are shown to depend on the current distribution of mining resources
among major miners and the ocean.
– Finally, we use this model to raise issues relevant to the design of future cryptocur-
rencies and formulate prospective research questions.
In general, the present paper can be seen as a first step towards the application of the
Oceanic Game concept in blockchain mining. Beyond some first insight, the extent
to which this model can provide further results in the issues of (de)centralization,
blockchain governance and long-term sustainability is yet to be fully understood.
1.1 Outline
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the model of
Oceanic Games and give an example to illustrate the defined notions. Revelant results
from [27] and their application in blockchain settings are shown in Sect. 3 along with
numerical simulations. In Sect. 4, we raise related issues and research questions and
discuss limitations of the current approach. Section5 concludes the paper.

2 The Model: Oceanic Games on the Blockchain
The current model adjusts the notation and terminology of [27] in a standard
blockchain setting.
Miners: The miners are the physical entities that participate in the block proposal
and creation process. The term is used here in the broadest sense and depending on
the underlying protocol and selection mechanism, it may refer to “conventional”
miners as in PoW, [28], or to virtual miners as in PoS or other alternative forms
[8]. The set of miners consists of two distinctive components
– A finite, discrete set M = {1, 2, . . . ,m} of major miners or mining pools.
– An interval I = [0, 1] of infinitesimal miners. We refer to I as the ocean and to
miners in I , as oceanic players. We only consider subsets U = [u1, u2] ⊆ I of
the ocean I , e.g. U = [0.1, 0.5], and not individual oceanic players.
Resources: To participate in the distributed consensus, each miner needs to provide
proof of some designated, costly resource. This may be a physical or digital
asset such as computational power in PoW or native coins in PoS mechanisms,
respectively. To describe these resources, we use following notation
188 N. Leonardos et al.
– A set of real numbers r1, r2, . . . , rm ≥ 0, where ri denotes the amount of resources
of miner i ∈ M . For any subset S ⊆ M , we will write r (S) = ∑
i∈S ri to denote
the total resources of miners in S.
– A positive constant α > 0 which denotes the total resources of the ocean I .
Accordingly, any subset U = [u1, u2] ⊆ I controls α · |U | of resources where
|U | = u2 − u1.
Based on the above, the total protocol resources R are equal to R := α + ∑
i∈M ri .
While resources change over time, in the present analysis, we will focus on a sin-
gle period or a static setting and hence, unless indicated otherwise, our notation
is independent of the time t . Resources may be expressed as absolute numbers or
percentages but this will be made explicitly clear from the context.
Blockhain Oceanic Games: Given the above, a blockchain oceanic game Γ is
defined by a majority quota, q ≥ 0, using the symbol2
Γ := [q; r1, r2, . . . , rm;α]
with the following interpretation: a coalition of miners C := S ∪U with S ⊆ M
andU ⊆ I wins in the game Γ , if and only if its total resources are larger than or
equal to q, i.e., if
r (C) := r (S) + α · |U | ≥ q
Addition of resources: Given an oceanic game Γ , we want to study the situation in
which new entities acquire resources and enter the protocol. For this, we will use
the notation Γ + with
Γ + := [
q; r1, r2, . . . , rm, rm+1;α
]
and M+ = {1, 2, . . . ,m,m + 1}. In words, Γ + results from Γ by the addition of
a new major player m + 1 with exogenous resources rm+1 > 0. Similar notation
can be used to denote the formation of a new entity crystallizing out of the ocean.
In this case, Γ + := [
q; r1, r2, . . . , rm, rm+1;α − rm+1
]
for some rm+1 > 0, and
M = {1, 2, 3, . . . ,m + 1}.
Values: The first core functionality of the present model is to calculate a value ϕi
for each major miner i ∈ M and one value Φ for the entirety of the oceanic
players, also referred to as the oceanic value. Each miner’s value depends on
that miner’s share of resources and on the total distribution of the remaining
resources among the rest of major and oceanic miners. To define the miner’s
values ϕi , i ∈ M and the oceanic value Φ, let X1, X2, . . . , Xm be independent
random variables uniformly distributed on I = [0, 1]. For each x ∈ I , let r (x) :=∑
j∈M r j · 1{X j < x}, where1{X j < x} = 1 if X j < x and0 otherwise (indicator
2The notation is common in the literature of weighted voting games, see [25, 31, 32] for a more
related application. Also, in most cases, we will be interested in q = 0.5 or 50% but the current
model applies to any q of interest.
Oceanic Games: Centralization Risks and Incentives in Blockchain Mining 189
function). Then, the value of miner i ∈ M is defined by
ϕi := Prob [r (Xi ) + αXi < q ≤ r (Xi ) + αXi + ri ] (1)
and the oceanic value by Φ := 1 − ∑
i∈M ϕi . Intuitively, the value ϕi is the prob-
ability that miner i will be the crucial entity to turn a random coalition of miners
from losing (total resources of the coalition without i are less than q) to winning
(total resources of the coalition with i are equal to or greater than q).3
Value-per-unit of resource: The second functionality of this model is to determine
the value per-unit of resource or power ratio, vi , for each player i ∈ M , which is
defined by
vi := ϕi/ri (2)
Similarly, the value per oceanic unit of resource or oceanic power ratio, voc, is
equal to voc := Φ/α.
2.1 An Example: Why Values and Not Shares?
We illustrate the above with the help of an example adapted from [27, Section6].
We consider a mining situation with two major mining entities or pools, M = {1, 2},
and the simple majority quota q = 0.5 represented by the following game Γ =
[0.5; r1, r2;α], where α = 1 − r1 − r2. The 0.5 or 50% quota corresponds to cntrol
of the majority of protocol resources and hence, of the blockchain as a whole. In
this game a coalition S wins, if r (S) ≥ 0.5, i.e., if it occupies 50% or more of the
protocol resources.4
All possible resource configurations (r1, r2, α) are illustrated in Fig. 2. The hori-
zontal and vertical axes represent miner 1’s and miner 2’s fraction of the resources,
respectively. Their possible combinations are divided in 4 inner regions, �i , i =
1, 2, 3, 4. Region �1 contains all configurations for which the combined resources
of both major miner are less than 50%, i.e., r1 + r2 ≤ 0.5. In this case, the majority
of resources is controlled by oceanic players. However, the ocean is not actually “in
control”, since, by assumption, there is no coherence nor organizational structure
between oceanic players. The explanation of regions �2,�3 and �4 is similar and
is briefly given in the legend of Fig. 2.
Using (1), the value ϕ1 of the first major miner is given by
3For more details and the probabilistic derivation of these values, we refer to [27].
4Due to continuity properties, there is no difference between using the q = 50% quota or symboli-
cally, the q = 51% quota, as is common in the related literature [11, 22, 28].

with r̄i := α − r j for i = 1, 2 and j = 3 − i . The value ϕ2 of Miner 2 is analogous
and the oceanic value Φ is simply equal to Φ = 1 − ϕ1 − ϕ2.
The interpretation of the values in the extreme regions �3 and �4 is straight-
forward. In �3, miner 1 controls more than 50% of the resources and hence, has
absolute power over the blockchain. This implies that her value is equal to 1 and
consequently, the value for both miner 2 and the oceanic miners is 0. Region �4
is similar. The interesting cases arise whenever (r1, r2) ∈ �2, i.e., when the major
miners and the ocean, each control less than 50% of the resources, or (r1, r2) ∈ �1,
i.e., when the resources controlled by the ocean account for more than half of the
total resources. This case is also referred to as the interior case in the original paper.
Some instantiations in regions �1 and �2 are presented in Table2.
An indicative observation—which does not aim to an exhaustive analysis of the
above measurements—is that the values and the ratios unveil disparities between
shares and actual influence or power of the participating entities. For example, there
are instances, as in the (40, 9, 51)-configuration (first row in �1), in which a major
miners’ ratio is larger than the ratio of oceanic players. This imbalance generates a
motive for oceanic players to merge with that miner to increase the power of their
individual resources. Equivalently, the large miner has an increased influence to
attract resources from the ocean. The picture is totally different in the (40, 40, 20)-
configuration (third row of �2), in which the competition between the major miners
raises the value of resources owned by the ocenic players. Both cases can be con-

trasted to the stability in the (25, 24, 51)-configuration, in which all 3 ratios are
approximately equal to 1.
Yet, as argued in [27], the interpretation of values should be done with caution
and only in addition to complementary analytical tools. This is because values do
not take into account qualitative factors such as ethical commitments, operational
constraints or other kinds of incentives.
3 Individual Mining Is Not Stable
A direct outcome of applying the model of Oceanic Games in the blockchain context
is the next result due to [27]. Both parts of Theorem 1 make critical use of the
assumption that the majority of mining resources is controlled by oceanic players.
Their proof relies on a recursion in the number m of major miners and can be found
in [27]. Here, we will focus on the interpretation of Theorem 1 and its application in
blockchain context.
Theorem 1 ([27]) Let Γ = [0.5; r1, r2, . . . , rm;α] with M = {1, 2, . . . ,m} be a
blockchain oceanic game, such that r (M) < 0.5 ≤ α, i.e., such that the majority of
mining resources is controlled by individual (oceanic) miners. Then

i , i =
1, . . . ,m + 1 are the values in Γ +, then
ϕ+
m+1/rm+1 = Φ/α
or equivalently, v+
m+1 = voc.
Interpretation of Theorem 1. Statement (a) of Theorem 1 is an analytical result
which yields the exact formula to compute the values of the major miners and the
ocean. Its usefulness will become aparent in the applications. Statement (b) carries
more intuition. It states that the value-per-unit of resource of a miner entering Γ
is equal to the oceanic value-per-unit of resource in Γ . One possible interpretation,
also supported by [27], is that this provides a stability argument in favor of decen-
tralization, in the sense that there is no incentive for the formation of a “cartel” or a
mining pool, provided that the size of the ocean is big enough, i.e., provided that the
ocean controls the majority of the resources.5
However, as we will see in the following applications, this picture is misleading
and decentralization is actually not stable. In practice, the oceanic value per unit of
resource in Γ + can go below the value per unit of resource of the crystallizing or
newly entering entity. Hence, given that a set of miners can coordinate their actions,
then it may be beneficial for them to either crystallize out of the ocean or to acquire
exogenous resources and form in both cases a single mining entity.
3.1 Applications of Theorem 1
The above interpretations of Theorem 1 are illustrated via the simulation of two
representative scenarios. In both cases, we assess the stability of initial distributions
of mining resources, in which the majority of resources is controlled by the ocean.
This is achieved by comparing the oceanic value per unit of resource to the value per
unit of resource of the same miners when acting as single entity.
I. Crystallization out of the ocean: In the first scenario, we consider an instance
of the blockchain oceanic game in which all resources are initially controlled by
oceanic players. This is described by the game Γ = [50%;α = 100] and M = ∅.
Then, we simulate a gradual formation of a single mining entity by the process of
crystallization out of the ocean. This is captured by a sequence of games (instances)
Γ + = [50%; r1;α] with 0 < r1 < 50 and α = 100 − r1. For each instance, we cal-
culate the value per unit of resource of the single entity that is forming out of the
ocean and compare it with the value per unit of oceanic resource. The results are
shown in Fig. 3.
It is apparent that v1 is higher than voc even for arbitrarily low values of r1 and
that the difference is increasing in the percentage of crystallized resources. This
5This statement actually holds for any quota q ∈ (0, 1) and not only for q = 0.5 as formulated here.

resource (blue line). The
total percentage of resources
that is controlled by the
crystallizing entity is shown
in the horizontal axis
uncovers a motive for coalition formations and merging between miners, even if
the initial distribution is perfectly decentralized. Further simulations (not shown
here) demonstrate that the same picture continues to hold even if M �= ∅, as long
as α > 50% and no single miner in M holds a percentage close to 50%. If there
exists a “large” miner i ∈ M with, e.g., ri > 40%, then the oceanic players may be
disincentivized to collude. However, this is only a semblance of stability, since in
this case, oceanic miners have an incentive to merge with the “large” miner.
II. Acquisition of exogenous resources: In the second scenario, we consider miners
who are acquiring exogenous resources to enter the mining process. We assume
that these miners can either enter the ocean and mine individually or collude and
form a single mining entity. We want to compare the value per unit of resource
in these two cases. Formally, we denote the current distribution of resources by
Γ = [50%; r1, r2, . . . , rm;α] with α > 50% and the total mining resources of the
new entities by w. We want to compare

m+1/w in the game Γ + := [50%; r1, r2, . . . , rm, w;α] to
– vo
oc := Φo/ (α + w) in the game Γ o := [50%; r1, r2, . . . , rm;α + w].
The game Γ + describes the instance in which the entering miners merge in a single
mining entity and the gameΓ o the instance in which the enteringminers become part
of the ocean andmine individually.We assume that initially, themajority of resources
is controlled by oceanic players and that there exist two other major mining entities.
It turns out that the share of mining resources of the other major entities influences
the incentives of the entering miners. To see this, we consider two cases.
Case 1: Let Γ = [50%; 6, 4; 90], so that Γ + = [50%; 6, 4, w; 90] and Γ o =
[50%; 6, 4; 90 + w] for anyw > 0. As shown in Fig. 4, in this case, both major min-

of the new miners when they enter as a single entity is equal to the oceanic value
voc in the initial game Γ (red line). According to [27] this implies that “there is no
incentive for a new entity to form”. However, this only says half the truth. As we can
see by the blue line, if the newly enteringminers enter the ocean as individual miners,
then their value per unit of resource will be lower compared to the case in which
they collude. Hence, given that a group of entering miners are capable to coordinate
their actions, then they are better off if they enter as a single entity than as oceanic
players.
Case 2: Let Γ = [50%; 55, 5; 90], so that Γ + = [50%; 55, 5, w; 90] and Γ o =
[50%; 55, 5; 90 + w] for anyw > 0. As shown in Fig. 5, in this case, the presence of
major miner 1 seems to create a disincentive for a forming coalition and v+
m+1 < vo
oc
for any w > 0 such that w + 90 < 50%. The resulting picture shows that we cannot
generalize the outcome of the previous case. In particular, we conclude that whether
the entering miners have an incentive to form a single entity or to join the ocean
as individual miners, may depend on the actual distribution of resources among the
existing major miners and the ocean. However, this is only a semblance of stability,
stemming from an already centralized initial distribution (r1 > 33%). In this case,
oceanic miners actually have a stronger incentive to merge with miner 1 instead of
forming a new entity.
The previous simulations create an inconclusive picture. In general, the incentives
for miners to merge seem to depend on the current distribution of resources. Since
blockchain mining is a dynamical system that evolves over time, they suggest that
even if the blockchain starts from a sufficiently decentralized point, then it is unlikely
to remain decentralized also in the future or equivalently that decentralization creates
a negative feedback loop, [19, 36]. The dynamics of the coalition formation process
and the entry barriers resemble these of conventional economic markets of either

perfect or oligopolistic competition. These findings provide an alternative perspective
to cryptocurrency mining along with [1], and suggest the need for further research
in this direction.
4 General Issues, Research Perspectives and Limitations
The application of the oceanic-gamemodel in blockchainmining opens new research
perspectives but also has its own limitations. Beyond the insight from existing results,
a complete model needs to account for the additional challenges and address the
questions that are specific to the blockchain context. In the following discussion, we
raise such relevant issues, discuss their connection and research possibilities via the
current model and identify potential limitations.
Cryptocurrencies as Resources: The difference between PoW and PoS in terms of
their resources—computational power versus native coins—has a direct impact
on both the mining process and the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. When
coins are used as mining resources (PoS protocols), their value depends on their
distribution among existing miners, their availability for prospective miners and
the returns (profits) from mining. This in contrast to PoW protocols, in which the
price of the resources—e.g., hardware and electricity—is not tied to the price of
the underlying cryptocurrency.
Resource Acquisition & Entry Barriers: The above suggest that the nature of pro-
tocol resources may also generate different entry barriers. In PoS, the acquisition
of protocol resources, i.e., coins, by prospective nodes depends on the willingness
of current owners to exchange their coins and the way that new coins are minted.
Different configurations may lead to high entry barriers and centralization. In
196 N. Leonardos et al.
PoW, computational power is essentially unlimited and acquisition of additional
resources is independent of the underlying cryptocurrency. This implies lower
entry barriers but also more frequent changes in the configuration (distribution)
of resources among miners.
In particular, the current cost of acquiring enough computational power to control
the majority in the Bitcoin and Ethereum PoW-blockchains is estimated at 1.5 bil-
lion US Dollars [6]. This amount is well within the budget of several physical or
legal entities worldwide. Moreover, it is independent of the value of the underly-
ing cryptocurrency and depends only on the size of the network and the hardware
and electricity costs. With this in mind, it is natural to ask: how stable are PoW
blockchains against arbitrary authorities able to acquire themajority of resources?
How relevant are these questions to the current distribution of resources and how
do they translate in the PoS setting?
In this context, further work on blockchain oceanic games can aid the community
to raise and study questions about investment in cryptocurrencies. When viewed
not only as assets but also as means to gain power in the mining process and the
governance of a blockchain, cryptocurrencies fit to the current perspective and
their mechanics can be better understood.
Mathematical Modelling: From a mathematical perspective, oceanic games
bridge the gap between atomic and non-atomic congestion games [23]. Yet, the
use of values instead of equlibria to study real settings has its own limitations [27,
32]. This is mainly due to the probabilistic derivation of values, which ignores
qualitative aspects such as ethical commitments, preferences or any other motives
of the participating agents. However, despite these limitations, if properly inter-
preted, values can become a powerful tool in the analysis of strategic interactions.
In an immediate direction, they can be used to rethink the notion of blockchain
fairness or equitability, which is currently based on the theoretically tentative
premise that one unit of resource—one vote also implies fairness [13, 35].
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we employed the concept of Oceanic Games [27], to model and study
strategic interactions in blockchain mining. Oceanic Games have been used in con-
ventional economics to analyze decision making in corporate settings with a small
number of major players—shareholders or here, mining pools—and a continuum of
minor, individually insignificant players, called the ocean. This stream of literature
focuses on the measurement of the value per miner and per unit of resource for each
miner given a distribution of resources. Values are then interpreted as strategic com-
ponents in decisions related to resource acquisition,mergers and coalition formations
and offer an alternative perspective to the common equilibration models.
An immediate implication of existing results was that given a sufficiently large
initial distribution of resources, there are incentives both for active and for newly

entering miners to merge (form cartels or coalitions) and act as single entities. These
observations provide an alternative justification of the observed centralization and
concentration of power in the mining process of the major cryptocurrencies. Con-
trary to common perceptions, they amount to the existence of a negative feedback
loop in terms of decentralization as a core ingredient in permissionless blockchain
philosophy, [17], and reveal the need for futher research in this direction. In a general
discussion, we identified critical issues related to resource acquisition, entry barri-
ers and centralization risks in blockchain mining and formulated relevant questions
that may be answered by further exploration of the present model. These findings
can be placed in the broader context of governance and long-term sustainability for
pemissionless blockchains.
