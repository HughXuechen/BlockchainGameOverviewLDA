The Impact of Covid-19 on Blockchain Adoption Time of Shipowners
 Abstract - The outbreak of Covid-19 has accelerated the 
need for digitalisation in maritime supply chains. Blockchain 
is a promising digital technology for post-Covid-19 recovery 
because of its immutability, transparency, traceability and 
security. This paper aims to analyse the impact of Covid-19 
on blockchain adoption time among shipowners. A game 
theoretical model is built to solve the problem. In numerical 
applications, the impact of Covid-19 is observed by comparing 
the results to those without Covid-19. It is found that Covid-
19 has a positive effect on accelerating blockchain adoption 
for a few small shipowners. This indicates that Covid-19 
provides a good business opportunity for blockchain 
developers to market their products.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 The maritime supply chain is under digital 
transformation to revolutionise its processes. Various 
technologies are increasingly deployed by maritime 
stakeholders, such as sensors, RFID, big data analytics and 
blockchain [1], [2]. However, the diffusion of digitalisation 
varies across maritime organisations. For example, among 
the 174 members of International Maritime Organization 
(IMO), only 49 countries have digital port community 
systems by June 2020 [3]. The outbreak of Covid-19 has 
urged stakeholders to expedite the use of digital 
technologies in maritime supply chains to reduce human 
interaction, sustain operations and enhance efficiency. 
 Blockchain is considered a promising technology to 
solve the problems amplified by Covid-19, due to its 
features of immutability, transparency, security and 
traceability. Quite a few blockchain initiatives from 
maritime organisations are observed after the outbreak of 
Covid-19, such as COSCO shipping, Shanghai 
International Port Group and the International Maritime 
Employer’s Council and the International Transport 
Worker’s Federation [4]–[7]. As mentioned by [8], it is an 
emerging trend in the maritime industry that big customers 
such as BHP adopt blockchain at an increasing speed and 
they require their vendors like shipowners to join their 
blockchain system. The optimal adoption time of 
shipowners under this situation has been discussed by [8]. 
However, in view of Covid-19, a new important question 
arise - how the pandemic would affect shipowners’ 
decisions on blockchain adoption time under this situation.  
 Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, different organisations 
are affected at various levels, either positively or 
negatively. Some of them may not even afford to adopt a 
new technology like blockchain in the short term despite 
the understanding that the technology helps them. It 
remains unclear how those organisations would respond to 
the Covid-19 in terms of whether and when to adopt a new 
technology.  
 In the existing literature, the impact of Covid-19 on the 
maritime industry is mainly discussed from the aspects of 
freight rate, vessel calls, cargo volume and crew change 
[9]–[11]. Although automated and digital technologies are 
recommended by [9]–[11] to improve resilience to the 
pandemic crisis, they do not focus on technology adoption 
itself. Very few studies discuss the impact of Covid-19 on 
technology adoption, particularly on technology adoption 
time.  
 In order to narrow the research gap, this paper analyses 
the impact of Covid-19 on shipowners’ adoption time when 
facing a blockchain adoption request from a big shipper, 
which is an emerging trend in the industry. It extends the 
work of [8] by including pandemic-related settings to 
capture the potential changes in shipowners’ business 
performance due to Covid-19.  
 The remaining of the paper is organised in the 
following way. Section II presents the model setup. Section 
III conducts a numerical application and provides result 
analysis. At last, conclusions are drawn in section IV. 
 
II.  MODEL SETUP 
 
 The model considers a two-layer maritime shipping 
market with a very large shipper and multiple shipowners. 
Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the shipper would like to 
adopt a blockchain-based system to digitalise the 
documentation process of its current supply chain and 
require its shipowners to participate in the system. 
 
A. The Model 
 
 Before we describe the model in detail, a few 
assumptions are made. Firstly, the annual shipping quantity 
of the shipper remains the same unless a disruption 
happens. The affected shipping quantity remains the same 
during the disruption impact period. Secondly, the cost of 
blockchain adoption consists of two parts, namely an initial 
setup cost 0( )C and annual membership fee ( )aC . Thirdly, 
the costs and gains relating blockchain adoption are 
discounted at a rate of  , which is different from interest 
rate .  Fourthly, the special benefits to a shipowner due to 
blockchain adoption is denoted as ) (i

proportionally to shipping quantities handled ) ( t t
i ii qg kq , 
where k is the coefficient of blockchain benefits to 
shipowners. Lastly, the shipper is assumed to have a very 
strong market position so that it has the bargaining power 
to impose penalty policies on shipowners. 
 When the shipper announces its blockchain initiative, 
it also introduces a penalty policy with two concepts of 
penalty ratio ( ) and cutoff time ( )cT . Shipowners who join 
the shipper’s blockchain system within the cutoff time are 
defined as leaders. Otherwise, they are followers. The 
original shipping quantity between the shipper and 
shipowner i before the outbreak of Covid-19 is denoted as 
0
iq . The penalty policy works in the way that followers’ 
shipping quantities will be reduced by the shipper at a ratio 
of  . The reduced quantities from followers will be re-
allocated to leaders proportionally ( ) based on leader’s 
original shipping quantities with the shipper. The total 
reduced quantities of followers are equal to the total 
increased quantities of leaders, i.e.,

will be returned to the original ones once all shipowners 
join the blockchain system. 
 Due to Covid-19, shipowners experience changes in 
shipping quantities and profit margin. At the same time, it 
is uncertain how long the impact will last. pT denotes the 
impact duration of Covid-19 pandemic.  denotes the 
percentage change in shipping quantities between the 
shipper and shipowners, so the new shipping quantity of 
shipowner i  during the pandemic period is (1 ) t
iq for 
[0, ]pt T .  denotes a scaling parameter reflecting the 
changes in shipowners’ normal business profit margin. The 
new business profit of shipowner i during the pandemic 
period is hence ( )t
i iq for [0, ]pt T , where ( )t t
i i iq mq 
represents the normal business profit of shipowner i  at 
time t  before Covid-19 and m  is the shipowner 'si profit 
margin per shipping quantity.

the payoff function of shipowner i , which will be different

III.  NUMERICAL APPLICATIONS AND RESULTS 
 
 This section conducts a numerical application with a 
big shipper and ten shipowners with industry data. The 
Nash equilibrium of the numerical case in terms of 
shipowners’ optimal blockchain adoption time is 
summarised in Table I. It is noted that most shipowners 
would adopt blockchain at the earliest possible time, i.e., 
* 0iT  . But very small shipowners such as shipowner 9 
and 10 would not adopt blockchain until 16 and 21 years 
later, respectively.

19, the impact of the pandemic on blockchain adoption can 
be observed. Firstly, the leadership or followership does 
not change due to Covid-19. Those who would be a leader 
(follower) without Covid-19 would still be a leader 
(follower) with Covid-19. Secondly, the blockchain 
adoption time of small leaders (e.g., shipowners 6, 7 and 8) 
is earlier with Covid-19 than without Covid-19. The 
blockchain adoption time of followers is slightly delayed 
because of Covid-19. However, such a delay can be 
negligible in terms of the percentage change. Thirdly, the 
payoff of all leaders is increased due to Covid-19, while the 
payoff of followers is similar with and without the 
pandemic. 
 The results indicate that Covid-19 has a positive effect 
on accelerating blockchain adoption, but limited to some 
small shipowners. For very small shipowners, there is no 
significant impact of Covid-19 on them in terms of their 
blockchain adoption decisions. It makes sense as Covid-19 
increases shipowners profits based on the market 
information due to increased profit margin during the 
pandemic. The increased profit makes earlier blockchain 
adoption more affordable for some small shipowners, while 
it cannot further improve the blockchain adoption time of 
big customers as their adoption time is already the earliest, 
i.e., * 0iT  . For very small shipowners, the additional 
profits brought by Covid-19 are limited by the very small 
shipping quantity and hence are not sufficient enough to 
induce them to forward their blockchain adoption time.
  
IV.  CONCLUSION 
 
 This study analyses the impact of Covid-19 on 
blockchain adoption time for shipowners by extending the 
work of [8] with new pandemic-related settings and 
parameters. A numerical application with industry data is 
conducted to demonstrate how to apply the model. The 
result shows that Covid-19 has a positive effect on 
accelerating blockchain adoption, but limited to a range of 
small shipowners. It suggests Covid-19 provides a good 
business opportunity for blockchain developers to market 
their products for small shipowners, but not those very 
small ones. 
 The contributions of this study are twofold. Firstly, it 
makes a novel attempt to analyse the impact of Covid-19 
on blockchain adoption time in an industry. Secondly, it 
provides practical implications to blockchain developers 
for expanding their market shares in maritime supply 
chains.
