Abstract—The combination of blockchain and supply chain is 
conducive to building a trusted and shared alliance environment. 
This paper discusses the evolution direction of alliance members 
in a supply chain under the environment of blockchain network. 
Income matrix is firstly established and then dynamic equation is 
obtained. Based on dynamic equation, equilibrium points and 
Jacobian matrix are derived. Through analyzing the sign of 
determinant and trace of Jacobian matrix, the stability of 
equilibrium point is studied. Further, the simulation presents the 
evolution trajectories of alliance members under different 
situations. The experimental results show that blockchain has a 
positive effect on the choice of the strategy and on evolution 
speed of the alliance. The work will help to develop a supply 
chain alliance relationship that features openness, sharing, 
credibility and win-win cooperation. 
Keywords—blockchain, supply chain alliance, stability analysis, 
evolutionary game 
I. INTRODUCTION
The lack of information sharing makes it difficult to obtain 
the relationship between supply and demand in supply chain. 
Taking advantage of information asymmetry, some alliance 
members might take completely selfish behaviors and betray 
the alliance, which ultimately lead to the collapse of the 
alliance. 
Blockchain is a digital, decentralized and distributed ledger 
[1], [2]. It provides a tool for solving the problem of 
information asymmetry. From the technical perspective, 
blockchain is composed of distributed database, consensus 
mechanism and cryptography algorithm. From the perspective 
of economics, blockchain makes new contracts and new 
transactions. When some laws, regulations, fund management 
mechanism and other features are added, the blockchain builds 
a rule-based economic order. Davidson et al. [3] believed that 
the blockchain system enables all nodes to exchange data 
freely and securely in a decentralized environment, which 
avoids human intervention and obtains system autonomy.  
Therefore, we integrate the blockchain into the supply 
chain. But, the overhead of consensus mechanism in 
blockchain will increase with the increase of transaction data 
volume. Because there are large amounts of data in supply 
chain, the service might be inefficient if a single blockchain 
network is adopted. We propose a supply chain system with the 
help of cloud platform. 
In a real supply chain system, the members are usually in a 
changing environment and they require to adjust the strategy 
dynamically. So, a static game model is difficult to adapt to 
changing business conditions. Using evolutionary game to 
analyze supply chain is more suitable for market demand. 
Alchian [4] believed that moderate competition offers the 
opportunities for evolutionary game. Smith [5] provided the 
basic concept of evolutionary stability. Since then, 
evolutionary game has developed rapidly in various fields. And 
domestic scholars have gradually paid attention to evolutionary 
game. Cui et al. [6] used evolutionary game theory to discuss 
the process of limited rational stakeholders participating in 
enterprise ownership allocation and reaching Nash equilibrium. 
Yuan et al. [7] developed a dynamic pricing game model of 
multichannel supply chain, and focused on the impacts of 
channel competition on the complex. In [8], a general 
evolutionary game model composed of green sensitive 
governments, enterprises and consumers is built. The above 
works [4-8] have not studied the fusion of blockchain and 
supply chain.  
At present, there are few works on the fusion issue. [9] 
proposed a framework integrating supply chain with 
blockchain and designed a consensus mechanism to improve 
system performance; but the paper has not studied economic 
game and evolution direction of alliance members. Sun et al. 
[10] aimed to reduce financing risks by analyzing the
mechanism of blockchain technology in supply chain finance
using the evolutionary game; there is no further discussion on
the evolution path under different conditions.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) In 
order to solve the problems in the supply chain such as 
information sharing and dishonest transactions, the blockchain 
is introduced. In order to improve the efficiency of the 
blockchain network in processing large-scale data, we 
introduce cloud storage. (2) The evolutionary game of supply 
chain alliance based on blockchain is studied. Firstly, the 
incomes of suppliers and retailers under the cooperation and 
defection are modeled. Based on the average incomes of 
suppliers and retailers, a dynamic equation is obtained. Then, 
the Jacobian matrix is derived from the dynamic equation, and 
the signs of determinant and trace are discussed. Further, the 
stability of equilibrium points is obtained. (3) Through the 
simulation, the impact of the introduction of blockchain on the 
supply chain is presented. And the evolution processes at 
different initial values are discussed. Our work will help to

understand the evolution of supply chain in the blockchain 
network, establish a reliable alliance, and promote the healthy 
development of supply chain. 
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 
II presents supply chain framework. Section III discusses basic 
assumptions, model parameters and income matrix. Section IV 
offers stability analysis of equilibrium game for supply chain 
based on blockchain. Section V provides simulation 
experiments. Finally, Section VI concludes our work. 
II. SUPPLY CHAIN FRAMEWORK  
A. The Framework 
The supply chain system consists of blockchain network, 
cloud platform and supply chain alliance. 1) The blockchain 
provides tamper-proof services. It stores the important 
transactions and their signature data. 2) Cloud platform 
provides other services such as the storage of a large number of 
transaction details. 3) Supply chain alliance has a two-level 
chain structure and it consists of suppliers and retailers. 
Suppliers provide raw materials, equipment, energy, labor 
services, and so on. Retailers buy some goods from suppliers, 
and then sell the goods to the customers (Fig. 1).  
 
Fig. 1. System framework 
When suppliers and retailers publish supply and demand 
information through the interface, smart contracts on the 
blockchain execute matching algorithm for suppliers and 
retailers. Once the matching is successful, the transaction is 
triggered. Then, the hash value and the signature of the 
transaction are stored on the blockchain, and the detailed data 
are stored on the cloud. Next, the transaction is confirmed by 
verifying whether the signature is correct. If the verification is 
passed, logistics work begins.  
B. Benefits of Blockchain 
The distributed storage and cryptography technology in 
blockchain can ensure that authenticity and integrity of data to 
prevent some deception activities in supply chain. On the other 
hand, the submitting to the cloud can reduce the load of 
blockchain and improve the overall performance of the system. 
More benefits of introducing blockchain are as follows.  
1) Open and fair transaction. In the framework, the 
transaction is automatically completed by the smart contract. 
When the supplier and the retailer publish their information to 
the platform, smart contracts make the matches according to 
their demands. So, the transaction is open, fair and intelligent. 
2) Secure transaction. For an attack on the blockchain, the 
blockchain network can reach a consensus if the malicious 
nodes do not exceed 50% in Ethereum or if they do not exceed 
1/3 in Hyperledger. In general, there are many nodes in the 
supply chain system, so it is very difficult to launch the attack.   
3) Tamper-proof. For an attack on cloud storage, once the 
data in the cloud storage is tampered with, it will not match the 
signature in the blockchain. And the tampering will be found. 
But, the introduction of blockchain brings about some 
changes in the game research of traditional supply chain. So, it 
is the focus of our research. 
III. GAME MODEL 
A. Basic Assumptions 
The alliance has complex and dynamic behaviors. The 
assumptions of alliance members are as follows. 
Assumption 1. Basic strategy of alliance member is 
{cooperation, defection}.  
Assumption 2. Each member should undertake the 
construction costs of the alliance, cloud platform and 
blockchain network. 
Assumption 3. When the relationship between supply and 
demand meets the conditions, the smart contract automatically 
executes the transaction, which eliminates human intervention. 
Assumption 4. If some members betray the alliance, they 
will be punished. Cooperative members will obtain some 
rewards from the penalty of defected opponents and additional 
benefits such as increased goodwill. 
B. Model Parameters 
According to the above assumptions, we adopt evolutionary 
game theory to study decision-making of the members in 
supply chain. The parameters are as follows in Table I.

Therefore, the expected income of a supplier is

Therefore, the expected income of a retailer is

. 
IV.  STABILITY ANALYSIS  
Based on the expected incomes, we obtain the dynamic 
equation of suppliers and retailers. By solving the dynamic 
equation, we obtain Nash equilibrium points. And Jacobian 
matrix is also calculated. After analyzing the signs of the 
determinant and the trace of Jacobian matrix, we obtain the 
stability conditions about the equilibrium of model.

det(J) > 0 and tr(J) < 0, the game has the local stability. Here, 
det() is matrix determinant and tr() is matrix trace. The 
computation of det()  and tr()  of five equilibrium points under 
different conditions are shown in Table III. X1 and X4 are 
stable points, and their game strategies are {Defection, 
Defection}, {Cooperation, Cooperation}, respectively. X2 and 
X3 are unstable equilibrium points, and their corresponding 
strategies are{Cooperation, Defection}, {Defection, 
Cooperation}. For X5, because its trace is 0, it is a saddle 
point.

V. SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS 
A. Evolution in Different Situations 
The model is simulated by Vensim. The initial parameters 
are initial time=0, final time=30, time step=1, and the unit is 
month. In addition, α=0.5, β=0.5, As=50, and Ar=50. Different 
parameters may lead to different results. Therefore, we try 
different parameters to conduct simulation research. The 
parameters satisfy Situation 1 to Situation 5. 
Situation 1. Bs +Vs + F-Ct *θ<0, Br + Vr + F – Ct *(1-θ) <0, 
Rs +Vs +F-Ds – Ct *θ < 0, Rr + Vr + F-Dr -Ct *(1-θ) <0.

Rs 9 Ds 6 
Rr 9 Dr 6 
Bs 3 Vs 4 
Br 3 Vr 4 
Ct 25 θ 0.5 
F 5   
The parameters are shown in Table IV, which satisfy 
Situation 1. The change of α value (cooperation probability) of 
a supplier in 30 months is shown in Fig. 2. A retailer has 
similar results. From the figure, we find that the cooperation 
probability of alliance members gradually decreases from 0.5 
to 0. It means that the members tend to adopt a strategy of 
defection and the game enters a stable equilibrium of defection. 
 
Fig. 2. α value of a supplier in Situation 1. 
Situation 2.  Bs +Vs + F-Ct *θ >0, Br + Vr + F – Ct *(1-
θ)  >0. Rs +Vs +F-Ds – Ct *θ >0, Rr + Vr + F-Dr -Ct *(1-θ)>0.  
We increase the blockchain income (Vs, Vr), financial 
penalty (F), and decrease opportunity income (Ds, Dr). We 
modify the parameters Vs=5, Vr=5, F=5.3, Ds=5, and Dr=5 and 
keep other parameters unchanged as Condition 1. The α value 
of a supplier is shown in Fig. 3. A retailer has the similar 
results. Cooperation probability of alliance members increases 
from 0.5 to 1, and the game tends to a stable balance of 
cooperation. 
 
 
Fig. 3. α value of a supplier in Situation 2. 
Situation 3. Bs +Vs + F-Ct *θ >0, Br + Vr + F – Ct *(1-θ)  
<0, Rs +Vs +F-Ds – Ct *θ >0, Rr + Vr + F-Dr -Ct *(1-θ)<0. 
The modified parameters are Vs=7, Vr=4, F=3, Ds=2, Dr=7, 
which satisfy Situation 3.  For a supplier, cooperation income 
is always more than defection income, so he chooses 
cooperation. Meanwhile, for a retailer, defection income is 
always more than cooperation income, he chooses defection. 
Because their strategy choices are completely different, the 
simulation results overflow. 
Situation 4. Bs +Vs + F-Ct *θ <0, Br + Vr + F – Ct *(1-
θ)  >0, Rs +Vs +F-Ds – Ct *θ <0, Rr + Vr + F-Dr -Ct *(1-θ)>0.  
The modified parameters are Vs=4, Vr =7, F=5, Ds=7, Dr=2, 
satisfying Situation 4.  Contrary to situation 3，a supplier 
chooses defection and a retailer chooses cooperation. And the 
model is divergent. 
Situation 5. Bs +Vs + F-Ct *θ <0, Br + Vr + F – Ct *(1-θ)   
<0, Rs +Vs +F-Ds – Ct *θ >0, Rr + Vr + F-Dr -Ct *(1-θ)>0.  
The modified parameters are Vs=4, Vr=4, F=5, Ds=3, Dr=3, 
satisfying Situation 5.  A supplier or a retailer might change his 
own choice because of the other's choice, which increases the 
uncertainty of the system, and the model eventually fluctuates 
at the point of 1 (Fig. 4).

Summing up the above experimental results, Table V can 
be obtained. The related conclusions are as follows. 
TABLE V.  EVOLUTION RESULTS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
Situation1 Situation2 Situation3 Situation4 Situation5 
converge converge diverge diverge fluctuate 
X1 = (0, 0) X4 = (1, 1)   X4 = (1, 1) 
(1) For any member, if his income when defection is less 
than that when cooperation, the evolution result is that both 
parties will adopt the strategy of defection. And the system will 
converge to X1 = (0, 0).  In this situation, the alliance will be 
dismissed. 
(2) For any member, if the income when cooperation is 
more than that when defection. And the system will converge 
to X4 = (1, 1). In this situation, the alliance will continue 
existing.  
(3) For one member, cooperation income is always more 
than defection income. And for the other member, defection 
come is always more than cooperation income. The model is 
divergent.  
(4) A supplier or a retailer will change own strategy 
because of the other's choice, and the model eventually 
fluctuates at 1. 
B. Influence of Blockchain on Supply Chain Evolution 
For a supplier and a retailer, their initial blockchain 
incomes are set as Vs=4, Vr=4.  Then, Vs and Vr are increased or 
decreased by 0.5. Fig. 5 shows the influence of blockchain on 
the decision-making of the members in supply chain. 
 
Fig. 5. Influence of blockchain on the decision-making of supply chain. 
When blockchain income changes, both sides of the game 
can adjust their own strategies. 
(1) When blockchain income of one party increases and 
blockchain income of the other party has not changed, the 
probability of cooperation gradually increases from 0.5 to 1, 
and finally the model tends to a stable equilibrium of 
cooperation.  
(2) Conversely, when blockchain income of one party 
decreases and the other party remains unchanged, the 
probability of cooperation gradually decreases from 0.5 to 0. 
Defection is their common strategy. 
(3) If blockchain income of both sides increases or 
decreases, their strategy is cooperation or defection, and their 
evolution speed will be faster than that when only one-party 
changes.  
Blockchain not only builds a credible operation mechanism 
for supply chain alliance cooperation, but also it improves the 
intelligent processing of the supply chain. Furthermore, it helps 
supply chain alliance to reach the steady state faster. It has a 
positive effect on the choice of the strategy and on evolution 
speed of the alliance. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Under the framework of open and shared blockchain, the 
evolution of supply chain is studied. First, a game model 
composed of suppliers and retailers with blockchain network 
is established under four basic assumptions. Then, the stability 
of the points is analyzed using Jacobian matrix. Through the 
simulation, we present the evolution path of the alliance and 
the impact of blockchain on the decision-making of the 
members. The paper provides an idea for the game research of 
supply chain and blockchain, which is helpful to establish a 
reliable and win-win alliance. In the future, we will study the 
evolution game with more complex alliance relationships.
