Abstract—The mining work concentration problem, whereby 
machine power is monopolized when supporting its operation, is 
becoming a serious problem in virtual currency using the 
blockchain technology that has drawn significant attention in 
recent years. The paper presents a new solution to solve the 
problem by using a simple virtual currency service that allows a 
user to operate the service by giving the user a new incentive 
based on gamification, not traditional economic incentives. We 
conducted experiments that show the feasibility of adopting the 
alternative incentive. 
Keywords—Cryptcurrency; Gamification; Human Crowd’s 
Power; Mining Work Centralization 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Blockchain technology, which prevents duplicate trading 
and tampering of data, has recently drawn a significant amount 
of attention due to its ability to make our society more robust 
and efficient. Blockchain technology is actually a part of a 
cryptcurrency system named Bitcoin proposed in 2008; the 
technology makes it possible to carry out reliable commercial 
transactions that do not go through third parties on the Internet, 
which was difficult to realize before [8]. The blockchain 
technology not only issues its own currency [10]; the 
blockchain technology has also been used for domain name 
service [9], smart contracts [7], etc. The blockchain technology 
will become an important infrastructure to support almost all 
information services in the future. 
While the blockchain technology is expected to be a next-
generation technology, some problems have also been pointed 
out. Since the operation of the network system is carried out by 
distributing the machine power through peer-to-peer 
communication, it is possible to be able to selfishly manipulate 
transaction data by monopolizing more than 51% of the total 
machine power. Taking Bitcoin as an example, incentives for 
the Bitcoin operation are to earn its virtual currency. Because 
only economic incentives are used to obtain the currency, some 
users aim at obtaining the currency by preparing a huge amount 
of machine power, and the machine power has been centralized 
[5]. Such a problem is referred to as the mining work 
concentration problem. 
Many techniques have been studied to solve the mining 
work concentration problem by suggesting an alternative 
mining algorithm, but no research has given a new incentive to 
the user. In this study, therefore, by using a method called 
gamification to motivate people through psychological factors 
[6], the paper investigates whether the mining work 
concentration problem can be solved by providing incentives 
based on psychological factors through gamification rather 
than offering economic incentives. 
II. MINING WORK BASED ON GAMIFICATION 
A. An Overview of Our Approach 
We design a gamified service to justify our approach and 
focus on the mining work centralization problem. It is a 
customized and simplified virtual currency system based on the 
blockchain technology developed for justifying this research, 
giving incentives based on psychological factors using 
gamification against mining work and allowing users to 
perform approval work.  
The developed service consists of the following elements. 
Currency Unit: In this service, the unit of virtual currency 
used is expressed by [coin]. 
Communication protocol: For the sake of simplicity, the 
client/server model was used for developing the service. 
Although the blockchain technology is typically used in the 
P2P method, since the purpose of this experiment is only to 
give incentives for psychological factors to mining work, 
adopting the client/server method would not affect the results. 
Account: The service needs to create an account for each 
participating user. The account is provided with the fields. In 
order to mine virtual curency, it is necessary to generate a 
block.  
Transaction: The service exchanges virtual currency between 
users. For sending coins to others, the remittance account 
name and the amount of coins can be registered. When the 
transaction is performed normally, the transaction data is 
added to the transaction data list, and the user can confirm the 
contents of the transaction added to the data list at any time. 
Block: The service generates blocks storing multiple 
transaction. The creation of the block is done in the visualized

state by a user. The user stores the hash value of one block in 
the newly generated block. Blocks can be connected like 
unidirectional chains. When the approval work succeeds by 
the mining work to be described later, the block is added to the 
block data list. Block information and blocks are added to the 
preceding and succeeding blocks, and the service can check 
how it is connected in a visualized state. 
Mining Work: In order for a user to generate blocks and to 
add them to the block list, the block approval work is required. 
When blocks are approved and the chain extends from the 
block for the longest time, the block creator is given a reward. 
The mining work in this service is performed by manipulating 
visualized values by a user. In the game design, the value of 
the nonce in the block is made to correspond to the shape of 
the puzzle on the 5 × 5 board surface. The purpose is to make 
the user voluntarily perform a series of tasks of changing the 
value of nonce and performing approval work. 
B. Service Design 
In this service, a server/client model is adopted as presented 
above. The server mainly deals with data; account, transaction, 
and block. In a client, the service to offer the functions 
necessary for mining work and exchange of virtual currency is 
provided to a user. 
All operations by the user are performed through a Graphic 
User Interface (GUI) and provide six modes according to the 
necessary functions. The explanation of each mode is listed 
below, and the execution screen of the application is shown in 
Fig. 1. 
Account Registration and Login: The service registers a new 
account or logs in with an existing account. 
Menu: It is possible to change to the transaction generation 
mode, the account list confirmation mode, the mining mode, 
(automatic or manual) and the transaction list confirmation 
mode, respectively. 
Transaction Publication: The service can create a transaction 
for coin remittance from the account the current user is using, 
for any existing account. 
List Up Account: The service can check the list of account 
names in the registered account list. 
List Up Transaction: The service can check the list of 
transaction lists. 
Mining Work: The service allows a user to check the list of 
block lists visually. The blocks are connected by hash value. It 
can generate a new block from the existing latest block. In 
order to generate a new block, mining work is necessary, and 
let this user do this work on the GUI. 
III. AN EXPERIMENT METHOD AND RESULTS 
In order to evaluate whether the developed service gives 
users enough incentives for psychological factors caused by 
gamification, we run the service and conduct experiments 
using a questionnaire based on users’ answers and an interview. 
A. Overview  
This experiment was carried out by distributing client 
software for a total of 44 people (Age: 10-20) offering the 
service described in the previous section. The experiment 
period is one week. The evaluation was carried out using the 
statistical data obtained after the experiment and the 
questionnaire result of the optional answer. 
In addition to manually performing mining work to 
evaluate whether mining work was done as a result of 
incentives for psychological motivation, the function of 
automatically mining work with a certain probability by 
consuming coins held. This approach imitates the mining work 
in conventional Bitcoin whereby the problem is solved using 
machine power. If there are users who manually perform 
mining work even under this circumstance, within the game, it 
can be said that the incentive of the psychological factor 
through gamification is meaningful.  
B. About Motivating Factors 
The section considers what a participant felt motivated to 
mining work. Focusing on the answer to Q1 (What is the 
reason for thinking about mining work ?), 52.9% participants

accounted for "Mining work itself was fun.". Also, 47.1% of 
participants said "I wanted to build my own block and wanted 
to join the block. Because I wanted a reward.", and "It was told 
to me to do the mining work." for 35.3% of participants. This 
means that roughly half of the participants were motivated to 
do mining work through gamification. Similarly, some 
participants were motivated through economic rewards like 
Bitcoin, or the intrinsic motivation to contribute the service’s 
operation. However, 35.3% of participants responded that "I 
was told to do the mining work", which can be inferred as a 
participant who could not have motivated the mining work 
through gamification. In addition, 5.9% of participants 
answered "I wanted to win the mining work competition." This 
means that there are a few participants who were motivated 
through social incentives like the competition to solve a puzzle. 
Since the virtual currency used in this service is the 
currency generated for the experiment, and it was not 
accompanied by actual monetary value, the difference caused 
by the design decision is also necessary to be taken into 
account. In the free interview, some were answers such as 
“Because there was no value of coin”; the motivation to collect 
coin did not rise so much.", or "I thought that motivation would 
change if the reward was directly returned to participants.”  
If the currency used here is a currency with monetary value, 
it can be inferred that the options that can affect the answer 
result of Q1 include "I wanted a reward.", "Because I was told 
to do the mining work." Since these options are all related to 
the incentive by an external factor based on "currency", it can 
be considered that it is independent of the incentives by 
internal factors using gamification. 
C. Effects of Gamification 
This section discusses whether the game elements offered 
by gamification used for the service were given incentives 
from psychological factors to participants. The game element 
used in the service was to associate the nonce value in the 
block with the shape of the puzzle. Focusing on the answer to 
Q2  (Have you had fun in mining work ?), the percentage of 
participants who actually felt pleasure with mining work was 
65%, and the percentage of participants who did not feel fun 
was 35%. In other words, it can be said that more than half of 
the participants had motivation for the game elements in the 
service. 
We also try to perform a comparison between automatic 
and manual mining work. From Table I, the number of total 
blocks generated during the experiment was 819, among which 
542 blocks by manual mining work and 277 blocks by 
automatic mining work were found. That is, 66% of the blocks 
are manually created. This ratio generally agrees with the 
proportion of participants who felt pleasure with respect to the 
mining work incorporating game elements. Looking at the 
answer to Q2, half of the participants answered "Because I 
wanted to do mining work in my hand." This is the reason why 
they did not use automatic mining work. Also, looking at the 
answer to Q3 (This is a question to the person who performed 
automatic mining work. What is the reason why you did it ?) , 
80% of participants answered "I used it just as a trial." as the 
reason for using automatic mining work. On the other hand, 
since 20% of participants answered that "Mining work was 
troublesome." It can be inferred that most participants 
accounted for mining work as games instead of monotonous 
work.

In summary, it is concluded that it is effective to give 
incentives due to internal factors using gamification to mining 
work. 
D. Application to Cryptcurrency 
This section considers whether the mining work using 
gamification can be applied to realistic cryptographic currency 
using the blockchain technology. In the service used This paper 
defines the success probability to do mining work as 1/16. 
According to this probability, if a participant can continue 
using the service or looking at the answer to Q4 (The 
probability of mining work success this time was 1/16. Do you 
think you would continue mining work with this probability ?), 
82% of participants answered "I think I can continue." from Fig. 
2 (a). On the other hand, if looking at the answer to Q5 (If the 
probability of mining work had reached 1/100, would you 
decide to continue mining work ?), whether a participant seems 
to continue mining work when the probability to do mining 
work successfully is 1/100, 35% of participants from Fig. 2 (b) 
replied “I think I can continue.” Also, if looking at the answer 
 
Fig. 2.  Proportion trying to continue manual mining work, with probability of (a)1/16, (b)1/100, and (c)1/10000

to Q6 (If the probability of mining work success is 1/10000, 
would you decide to continue mining work ?), whether a 
participant seems to continue mining work when the 
probability to do mining work has become 1/10000, only 5% of 
participants answered "I think I can continue." from Fig. 2 (c). 
From these answers, it was found that the lower the success 
probability of mining work, the less motivated a participant to 
do mining work. For example, since the success probability of 
performing mining work in Bitcoin is as of January 
2017 [2], it can be said that it may be impractical to apply the 
game element of this service applied to mining work in Bitcoin. 
However, as mentioned above, the service can be used by "fun 
by game" as a motivational factor; it seems likely to be able to 
provide machine power using gamification without direct 
mining work. In other words, it seems to be effective when 
giving participants mining work as puzzles or games as 
incentives to provide machine power. 
We still need to consider how to make puzzles and game 
designs more effective and what kind of design you should not 
get bored with in order to keep participants providing machine 
power, and we will conduct more experiments to justify the 
proposed approach. 
IV. RELATED WORK 
A. Bitcoin Mining 
The most notable blockchain technology is the virtual 
currency named Bitcoin, invented in the paper written by 
Nakamoto in 2008 [9]. He claimed “To implement a distributed 
blockchain server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use 
a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash”. 
Hashcash refers to data and nonce, and it is a mechanism that 
does not allow transactions to be approved until the hash value 
becomes less than a certain value [1]. By making hassle-free 
calculation to confirm the transaction using the hash value, it 
requires huge machine power for preventing illegal 
transactions.  
The mechanism that requires machine power for the 
approval of a transaction like the approach is called Proof-of-
Work (PoW). In order for Bitcoin to operate stably, a large 
number of users need to perform PoW in their computers, so 
incentives for the users to provide the machine power are 
required. Nakamoto also said in his paper “By convention, the 
first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a 
new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an 
incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way 
to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no 
central authority to issue them” [8] Such a mechanism that 
obtains Bitcoin as a reward using the machine power is 
represented as mining by analogy to digging out gold at a mine. 
B. Mining Work Centralization Problem 
When the machine power concentrates on one entity, it is 
pointed out that the entity can modify the chain, which makes it 
impossible to maintain the legitimacy of the system. For 
example, as presented in [3], the authors claimed “Too much 
hash power controlled by one entity can cause Bitcoin to 
become similar to the payment systems and currencies it was 
meant to improve upon. A pool with more than 51% of the 
network hash power can block transactions, double spend, and 
change other consensus rules.” 
As shown in [4], the authors claimed “By using the latency 
of the network such as deliberately shifting the disclosure 
timing of block information, we can create a situation where 
block generation can be monopolized without holding 51% of 
machine power". In [7], the author indicated that the Bitcoin 
mining algorithm has vulnerability to a single concentration 
and is no longer dispersed; then he proposed solving the 
problem where it creates random data based on the state of the 
blockchain, computes randomly chosen transactions from the 
last N blocks of the blockchain, and returns the resulting hash. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed encouraging participation in 
mining work activities by incentivizing users through 
psychological factors made available by gamification; the 
objective was to solve the mining work concentration problem. 
When it comes to make a user perform mining work directly, 
since the probability of the approval work succeeding is deeply 
related to motivation, it does not work on such a design. 
However, the extracted insights show that it is beneficial to use 
ubiquitous machine power by giving the user a gaming element.
