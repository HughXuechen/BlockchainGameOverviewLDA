Abstract: Inadequate gas supply is partly responsible for the energy shortfall experienced in some
energy-poor nations. Favorable market conditions would boost investment in the gas supply sector;
hence, we propose a blockchain-based fair, transparent, and secure gas trading scheme that facilitates
peer-to-peer trading of gas. The scheme is developed using an Ethereum-based smart contract that
receives offers from gas suppliers and bid(s) from the thermal plant operator. Giving priority to
the cheapest offers, the smart contract determines the winning suppliers. This paper also proposes
an economic dispatch model for gas-deficient plants. Conventional economic dispatch seeks to
satisfy electric load demand whilst minimizing the total gas cost of generating units. Implicit in its
formulation is the assumption that gas supply to generating units is sufficient to satisfy available
demand. In energy poor nations, this is hardly the case as there is often inadequate gas supply and
conventional economic dispatch is of little practical value. The proposed economic dispatch model’s
objective function maximizes the quantity of available gas and determines the optimal power output
of each generating unit. The mathematical formulation is verified using data from the Egbin thermal
station which is the largest thermal station in Nigeria and is solved using the General Algebraic
Modeling System (GAMS). Obtained results indicate the viability of the novel approach as it results
in a net power gain of 35 MW. On the other hand, the smart contract proved effective in accurately
selecting winning suppliers and making payment.

1. Introduction
Despite the global drive to curb emissions, some energy-poor nations will need
many years to make the shift from fossil gas-based energy sources to cleaner sources.
A country like Nigeria, for instance, will likely remain heavily dependent on ther-
mal units for a while, making research focused on such units worthwhile. Unlike
nuclear and hydro plants, the operating cost of thermal units varies significantly
with power output, and gas cost constitutes a major portion of this operating cost.
The input/output (I/O) characteristic of a thermal unit relates its gas consumption
to its power output, and this may vary among thermal units as a result of differing
operating temperature, age of equipment [1], manufacturer’s design etc. This disparity
in I/O characteristics gives rise to the need to economically dispatch thermal units.
Economic dispatch (ED) distributes demand among all online generating units, whilst
minimizing operation cost [2]. Many ED formulations and solution methodologies
have been reported in literature [3–7], but most assume the availability of sufficient
gas supply. This is not the case with some major power stations in Nigeria. For a
station experiencing gas supply shortfall, tradition ED formulations and algorithms

fail. The lamentable state of electricity supply in Nigeria is partly due to inadequate
gas supply to thermal plants. Aside from the fact that the total installed generating
capacity is incommensurate to the country’s total demand, inadequate gas supply
makes it impracticable to get the most out of the available generating capacity. To
salvage the situation, we propose an ED model aimed at maximizing the available
quantity of gas. Whereas the input/output (I/O) characteristics of thermal units are
used to perform conventional ED, the proposed model requires the O/I characteristics
of the units. An unconstrained optimization problem is first formulated to estimate the
coefficients of the O/I characteristic curves which are then used to build the model.
The model seeks to maximize available gas. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain-
based transparent, secure gas market. This creates a fair market for gas suppliers which
would encourage an influx of suppliers, thereby boosting gas availability. The advent
of smart contracts underpinned by blockchain technology has resulted in significant
advancement in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. Without third-party involvement,
credible P2P transactions can be made with the aid of blockchain-based smart con-
tracts [8]. Consequently, researchers from various fields are investigating possible
applications of blockchain in their respective domains. The energy sector is also being
disrupted by blockchain technology. For instance, P2P energy trading can be facilitated
by the technology. Blockchain-based smart contracts can be employed to execute en-
ergy trading and payment rules [8]. The Brooklyn microgrid is a New York City-based
mini-energy market which uses blockchain to facilitate surplus solar energy trading
between prosumers and neighbors. The Pebbles project is another blockchain-based
digital platform for P2P energy trading [9]. Similarly, Power Ledger has a platform that
facilitates P2P energy trading and traceability [10]. In [11], a blockchain-based energy
trading scheme that ensures demand/supply balance whilst protecting consumers’
information is proposed. In blockchain-based P2P networks, consumer privacy can
be preserved despite transactions being public [12]. The authors of [13] developed a
framework for P2P energy transaction that suitable for Industrial Internet of Things
(IIOT) transaction scenarios. Smart contracts can improve security and fairness in
energy trading [8]. Another energy trading framework that employs blockchain is also
proposed in [14], and a double layered energy trading platform based on blockchain is
developed in [15]. In addition to energy trading, the authors of [16] have incorporated
carbon allowance trading using blockchain. The technology is also being explored for
use in energy management [17,18]. Some other research articles in blockchain-based
energy transactions are reported in Table 1.
Storage sharing is another emerging area of application of blockchains. The work
presented in [23] explores blockchain-based storage sharing. In the paper, a smart contract-
based scheme is proposed to enable storage sharing among power grid entities. Of par-
ticular interest in this study is the employment of smart contracts to automate auction
procedures. In [8,16,24], auction procedures were performed by smart contracts. Their
transparency and auditability make them appropriate to handle such procedures.
Among the benefits of incorporating blockchain technology in different energy-related
fields, some of which have been highlighted in the foregoing research works, the decentral-
ized nature of blockchains is one of its key strengths. However, most real-world blockchain
applications involve the use of off-chain data that are sourced from traditionally centralized
entities, which undermines the advantages of decentralization. The lack of trust from such
sources inhibits the full realization of many potential blockchain use cases [25]. These
sources of off-chain data have been termed “oracles”. Oracles provide blockchains with
real-world data [26]. To decentralize oracle-based systems, data from multiple oracles
are validated using a consensus mechanism [27]. In the energy industry, Power Ledger
employs decentralized oracles to obtain real world power meter readings.

In this paper, we employ blockchain via a smart contract to facilitate P2P gas trading.
Gas suppliers submit their offers to the smart contract. Similarly, the thermal plant operator
makes a bid for gas to the smart contract. The winning suppliers are determined by the
smart contract, which also receives payment from the plant operator and pays the suppliers
after gas delivery is ascertained. Since the transactions via the smart contract are stored
and executed on a public blockchain, they can be easily viewed and therefore audited.
In summary, we propose: (1) an economic power dispatch model aimed at maximizing
the available quantity of gas. This entails the computation of O/I characteristic coefficients
for thermal units for use in the proposed economic dispatch formulation. Optimal power
generation schedules are then obtained by solving the proposed formulation (an opti-
mization problem) and compared to actual power schedules. (2) A blockchain-based P2P
transparent gas marketplace. The paper focuses only on the smart contract development;
the complete architecture needed for the actualization of the entire scheme is out of the
scope of this study. The smart contract is programmed on a browser-based application
(Remix IDE) and its various functions are manually triggered.
2. Smart Contract-Based P2P Gas Trading
Subsequent to the remarkable success recorded by Bitcoin, blockchain technology has
garnered public attention. A blockchain is made up of blocks of P2P transaction records
that are cryptographically merged in a chronological manner. The ledger is distributed
among key peers on a blockchain network, and sophisticated mechanisms are used to reach
consensus. The technology relies heavily on cryptography for its operation and security.
Following the Bitcoin invention which was particularly intended to serve a cryptocurrency,
smart contract technology emerged. The advent of smart contracts has paved the way for
a wide range of industries to harness blockchain. Based on arbitrary pre-defined rules,
smart contracts can move digital assets between peers within a blockchain network [28].
A smart contract is a piece of code that can be used to represent rules or conditions on a
Energies 2022, 15, 5155 4 of 13
blockchain. It is stored and executed on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, without
involving third parties. Smart contracts are written using specific programming languages
depending on the blockchain they intended for. The Ethereum blockchain, for instance,
houses smart contracts written in either Solidity or Vyper.
Figure 1 shows the proposed system architecture for the smart contract-based P2P gas
trading scheme including decentralized oracles. However, the paper focuses on the smart
contract development alone. The scheme entails gas suppliers sending their offers (in terms
of amount and price) to a smart contract (represented by the space enclosed by the bold line)
and the thermal plant operator sending their demand to the contract. The smart contract
selects suppliers to fill the order of the operator, giving priority to the cheapest offers. As
a result, the operator is assured of getting gas supply at the best prices. The contract also
receives payment from the plant operator. To tackle the problem of oracle centralization, a
decentralized oracle mechanism is proposed [27]. The gas supplier facility, power plant gas
inlet, and outgoing power feeder are each equipped with smart meters. It is supposed that,
for the smart power meter which records energy at the outgoing feeder, the amount of gas
required to generate the recorded energy can be deduced. Hence, similar gas readings are
expected from the three meters. In this context, the smart meters are the oracles, the use of
which emulates the decentralization of blockchains off-chain. The readings are validated
via a consensus mechanism to confirm gas delivery, after which they are sent to the smart
contract, then payment to the suppliers is initiated. This decentralized oracle system makes
it difficult for a bad actor to tamper with gas supply/offtake data.

3.1. O/I Characteristic Parameter Estimation 
An unconstrained optimization problem is first formulated to estimate the 
coefficients of the O/I characteristic curves. It is based on the principle of the least 
squares error approach to polynomial approximation. The O/I characteristic estimation 
problem can be formulated as: 
Min ∑ 𝑃 − 𝑃  (1)
where 𝑃 = 𝛾 + 𝛽 𝑓 + 𝛼 𝑓  (2)
The coefficients 𝛾, 𝛽, 𝛼 are obtained from the O/I characteristic estimation problem 
and used in the adapted economic dispatch formulation.

The proposed ED model aims to maximize power output; hence, the sum of O/I 
characteristics of thermal units serves as objective function. The constraints include gas 
consumption limits and gas balance constraints.

4. Simulation Setup and Solution Methodology
The proposed ED model is specified and solved with GAMS. It is a mathematical
specification language specially dedicated for the solution of optimization problems [29].
Large and complex problems can be represented in GAMS in a concise manner and can
easily be altered for testing and research purposes [30]. It has been effectively employed
by researchers to solve typical economic dispatch problems [29–31]. Typically, GAMS
formulation follows the basic format in [30].
The P2P gas trading scheme is implemented on the Remix IDE. The environment
simulates a blockchain network having participants who can transact in a P2P manner.
It provides nodes or network accounts that each represent a participant. To enable the
initiation on network transactions, nodes are supplied with test Ethers. In the present
study, a node is reserved as the administrator node and used to perform tasks like initiating
payments, while another node is assumed to represent the thermal station. The gas suppli-
ers are represented by other nodes in the network. The foregoing therefore represents a
blockchain network of gas suppliers and the thermal station. The proposed smart contract
is also developed within Remix and can therefore interact with the various nodes in the
environment. For the simulation in this study, gas supply offers are manually submitted to
the proposed smart contract using each supplier’s node, and the thermal station’s bid is
manually submitted using its node. The administrative node is then used to initiate the
selection of winning supplier(s) by the smart contract, and subsequently make payments.
The proposed smart contract is coded with Solidity within the Remix IDE, using an i5-
6200U processor (7.7 GiB memory) and the Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS operating system. Figure 2

details regarding the smart contract functions are given in Algorithm 1.

5. Case Study
A major thermal power plant in Nigeria is taken as case study in this paper. Egbin
power plant is the largest installed single electricity generation plant in Nigeria having an
installed capacity of 1320 MW. It is located in Ijede area of Ikorodu, Lagos State. The plant
was commissioned in 1985 and consists of 6 units each having a generating capacity of
220 MW. It receives its natural gas supply directly from the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC).
As at the time of this research work, only five of the units were functional and data showing
monthly energy generated, gas consumed, and operating hours for each of the units were
obtained from January to September 2014. These were the months for which data were
available and could thus be utilized for research. The average power output and average
gas consumed are computed and shown in Table 2. fimin and fimax are the average gas
consumed when Unit 1 is generating at minimum and maximum average power level
observed from historical records. fa is the sum of average gas consumed by all units taken
from the historical data. These data were used to generate the O/I characteristics of the
thermal units according to the mathematical expressions in (1) and (2), after which (3)–(5)
were used to perform the economic dispatch.

While the data collected are more suitable for investigating the proposed economic
dispatch formulation, they provide details about the amount of gas utilized by the thermal
plant. This guided the development of the hypothetical gas marketplace presented in
Table 3. To test the effectiveness of the proposed smart contract, data from the month
of June were utilized. The average amount of gas used in the month was approximately
132,114 kg/h and the gas supply offers are shown in Table 3. The dollar equivalent of an
ether token is taken to be 4000 USD. The smart contract is developed and tested in the
Remix IDE. The environment offers a simulated blockchain network of peers/nodes, each
equipped with 100 ethers.

Figures 3 and 4 depict results of the smart contract-based gas trading marketplace.
The offers made by the gas suppliers, as well as the demand made by the thermal station to
the smart contract can be seen in Figure 3. Giving priority to the cheapest offers, the gas

The power gain displayed in Table 4 is the difference between the aggregate power 
output during normal operation and total output of the resulting generation schedule 
obtained from the proposed method. For six out of the nine months considered in this 
paper, the approach was successful as power gains were realized. It should be noted that 
the data obtained from Egbin power plant were records of energy generated and gas 
consumed monthly by each unit; hence, the estimated O/I characteristics curves are quite 
imprecise. Data recorded at shorter intervals would give more accurate results. This 
somewhat justifies the negative power gains recorded in the months of June, July, and 
September. However, an aggregate gain of 35 MW is recorded for the whole duration. 
The proposed formulation possesses gas-saving potentials in energy poor countries 
grappling with insufficient gas supply. 
Figure 3 shows the submission of gas supply offers and demand to the smart 
contract. The selection of suppliers as well as the amount of gas to be supplied to meet 
demand is also shown. To meet the demand at the best possible price, received supply

The power gain displayed in Table 4 is the difference between the aggregate power
output during normal operation and total output of the resulting generation schedule ob-
tained from the proposed method. For six out of the nine months considered in this paper,
the approach was successful as power gains were realized. It should be noted that the data
obtained from Egbin power plant were records of energy generated and gas consumed
monthly by each unit; hence, the estimated O/I characteristics curves are quite imprecise.
Data recorded at shorter intervals would give more accurate results. This somewhat justifies
the negative power gains recorded in the months of June, July, and September. However,
an aggregate gain of 35 MW is recorded for the whole duration. The proposed formula-
tion possesses gas-saving potentials in energy poor countries grappling with insufficient
gas supply.
Figure 3 shows the submission of gas supply offers and demand to the smart contract.
The selection of suppliers as well as the amount of gas to be supplied to meet demand
is also shown. To meet the demand at the best possible price, received supply offers are
re-ordered in ascending order of prices, thereby giving the lowest price offer topmost
priority. This results in the supplier order—D, A, E, B, and C. It can be observed from the
figure that Suppliers D, A, and E are selected to supply their entire offer amounts, while
Supplier B is expected to supply the fraction of its offer amount needed to completely meet
the demand.
Figure 4 shows the flow of funds to/from the smart contract. The thermal station
makes payment to the smart contract upon confirming the cost of gas demanded, then
the suppliers are paid via the smart contract. It can be seen that only suppliers A, B, D,
and E were paid, as expected. By investigating the gas offers alongside the employed
gas supplier selection mechanism, it can be seen that the accurate amounts were paid
by the smart contract to individual suppliers. The accurate selection and payment of the
suppliers by the smart contract proves its effectiveness in transparently selecting suppliers
and making payments.
The study develops a smart contract that facilitates P2P gas trading between power
plant operators and gas supplies. The smart contract has been developed for the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) and hence can also be used on other EVM-compatible blockchains.
Although it already implements some key trading logics in the system, the smart contract
needs to be modified to be integrated with a practical system. For instance, it needs to be
enhanced for greater autonomy and ability to receive data from oracles.
7. Conclusions
The novel ED has been successfully applied to Egbin thermal plant. Egbin power plant
is one of the plants faced with the challenge of insufficient gas to power generating units.
O/I characteristics parameter estimation is first performed to determine the coefficients γ,
β, and α, after which these values are utilized in the adapted ED formulation. Simulation
results showed that the proposed approach can achieve a greater output power than
was realized during normal operation of the plant. It can therefore be concluded that
the proposed ED approach can be effectively applied to gas-deficient thermal stations.
Results from P2P gas trading simulations also prove the effectiveness of the proposed
Ethereum smart contract in accurately selecting gas suppliers and making payments. With
the proposed gas dispatch model, available gas can be optimally used for maximum power
output. The proposed fair and transparent P2P gas trading attracts gas suppliers, thereby
improving gas supply to the thermal plant.
Future work could involve modeling emissions into the novel formulation and in-
cluding the ramp rate constraints. With regards to the P2P trading, further work could
entail the development of an appropriate mechanism of distributing transaction costs
incurred by the smart contract among the participants of the trading scheme. In addition,
the communication architecture and security mechanism for secure transmission of data
between users and the smart contract should be investigated.
