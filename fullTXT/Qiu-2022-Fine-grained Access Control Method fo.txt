Abstract—Blockchain technology has the advantages of 
decentralization, de-trust, and non-tampering, which breaks 
through the limitations of traditional centralized technology, so it 
has gradually become the key technology of power data security 
storage and privacy protection. In the existing smart grid 
framework, the grid operator is a centralized key distribution 
organization, which is responsible for sending all the secret 
credentials, so it is easy to have a single point of failure, resulting 
in a large number of personal information losses. To solve the 
problems of inflexible access control in smart grid data-sharing 
framework and considering the limitation of multi-party 
cooperation among grid operators and efficiency, an attribute-
based access control scheme supporting privacy preservation in 
smart grid is constructed in this paper. A fine-grained access 
control scheme supporting privacy protection is designed and 
extended to the smart grid system, which enables the system to 
achieve fine-grained access control of power data. A decryption 
test algorithm is added before the decryption algorithm. Finally, 
through performance analysis and comparison with other 
schemes, it is verified that the performance of this system is 7% 
higher than the traditional method, and the storage cost is 9.5% 
lower, which reflects the superiority of the system. Full 
optimization of the access policy is achieved. It is proved that the 
scheme is more efficient to implement the coordination and 
cooperation of multiple authorized agencies in the system 
initialization.

I. INTRODUCTION 
With the wide application of big data, fog computing, and 
Internet of Things technology, more and more applications 
store a large number of users' private data in the near-end fog 
node for computing. This solves the problem of insufficient 
storage space or limited computing resources of most mobile 
terminals in the current Internet of Things environment. At the 
same time, with the rise of new network architectures such as 
SDN, the computing, and storage capabilities of edge network 
devices and core gateway devices are continuously enhanced 
[1]. However, because the private data of users can bring 
commercial value to criminals, Internet of Things devices with 
weak performance have become the main target of hackers 
[2]. To prevent the user's data from being stolen, it is 
necessary to authenticate all unknown devices in the 
environment through identity authentication and other 
technical means, and then grant the corresponding device 
access to data after passing the identity authentication. 
However, most of the existing identity authentication schemes 
ignore the user's privacy disclosure in the authentication 
process, including the user's functional attributes, real identity 
privacy and geographical location privacy. 
Power data can be used by other organizations outside the 
grid system, for example, to calculate costs, monitor 
unexpected behavior, and predict future conditions. However, 
the power data of a single smart meter contains private 
information such as household habits, which needs to be 
protected. Therefore, how to balance the availability and 
privacy of power data is a problem faced by the smart grid [3]. 
In addition, RTUs and power consumers want to control 
access from users. Users want to get different power 
information depending on their specific tasks. For example, 
maintainers and system engineers monitor the network, while 
costing and analysis will be performed by auditors [4]. 
Therefore, in the smart grid system, it is particularly important 
to achieve fine-grained access control of power data [5]. 
However, most of the existing smart grid schemes focus on 
information aggregation but ignore the privacy protection and 
access control in the process of power data sharing. 
Blockchain technology is a trusted storage network 
composed of distributed equal nodes, consisting of tamper-
proof block data and automatically executable smart contract 
code, which has the characteristics of tamper-proof, 
coordination autonomy, high security, and trust of 
decentralized decision-making [6]. In the research of data 
sharing mechanisms based on blockchain, Dai Mingjun et al. 
[7] promoted the storage space of blockchain through 
distributed storage (DS) based on network coding (NC). Yang 
Jiachen et al. [8] introduced encryption algorithms to solve the 
problem of distributed secure storage of big data. Wang Zuan 
et al. [9] separated the original data storage and data 
transactions by using a double-chain structure and combined 
with proxy re-encryption technology to achieve secure and 
reliable data sharing. In 2016, Alharbi et al. [10] proposed an 
efficient privacy-preserving identity-based signature (IBS) 
scheme for smart grid communication. In 2017, a smart grid 
communication model [11] was proposed by Sedaghat et al., 
in which the cloud proxy service center, as a trusted third 
party with powerful computing power, is responsible for 
partially decrypting the shared ciphertext to reduce the burden 
of authorized users. In 2019, a privacy-preserving power data 
aggregation scheme [12] was proposed by Liu et al., but this 
scheme does not consider the access control of shared data. 
This paper aims to design a fine-grained access control 
scheme supporting privacy preservation in the cloud 
environment. Firstly, a fine-grained access control scheme for 
data sharing with a completely hidden access policy is 
constructed. Then, based on this, extended research on

smart grid is constructed.

vectors, and the access policy is completely hidden.

II. RELATED WORK 
A. Access Control Security Model 
With the rapid development of the ubiquitous power 
Internet of Things (IoT), various IoT intelligent terminal 
devices deployed in the smart grid generate a large amount of 
data. Although the application of cloud Internet of Things 
technology has effectively solved the problem of massive data 
collection, storage and sharing, the smart grid is faced with a 
huge number of intelligent terminal devices deployed in all 
aspects of the grid, users with a sharp increase in data and 
mixed personnel. Therefore, the data privacy security issues 
that involve posing a serious security threat [13]. These 
security threats are mainly manifested in: 
Data security risk: the combination of smart grid and 
Internet of Things technology, and the application of various 
emerging technologies in the smart grid makes the system 
complexity of the smart grid become higher. The security risk 
of various types of data is increased [14]. The application of 
cloud Internet of Things technology effectively realizes the 
collection, storage, and management of terminal data, but 
when it interacts with users, business systems, and power grid 
researchers, the misoperation and illegal access will cause data 
leakage. 
User privacy risk: In the smart grid, while protecting the 
privacy data of ordinary users, it is also necessary to prevent 
the leakage of grid system data. Users' personal information 
and power consumption data belong to users' privacy; and the 
important operation data of each link of the smart grid system 
also need to be protected [15]. In the face of distributed 
attacks by illegal elements, illegal access by malicious users 
and illegal operations by staff, the privacy data of power grid 
users and systems will be threatened. 
B. Safety Requirements 
According to the security threat analysis of data privacy 
protection in the smart grid cloud Internet of Things, effective 
access control methods are adopted to achieve the goal of data 
privacy security, and the following security requirements are 
considered: 
1) Authentication: The identity of the user connected to 
the smart grid control center needs to be authenticated to 
prevent the user from stealing private data under false names. 
Data visitors must be authenticated with the control center in 
both directions [16]. 
2) Data confidentiality: When a visitor in the smart grid 
needs to decrypt and obtain encrypted data, its attribute set 
needs to meet the access policy requirements defined by the 
data owner, and unauthorized visitors cannot access user data. 
3) Anti-collision attack: Unauthorized users cannot 
combine their key information to decrypt the ciphertext 
through the collusion of multiple users. 
4) Forward-backward confidentiality: The newly 
authorized visitor cannot decrypt the previous ciphertext data 
with his own private key; the unauthorized visitor cannot 
decrypt the decrypted ciphertext data [17]. 
5) Data integrity: All kinds of private data must be 
encrypted before they can be transmitted between entities to 
avoid illegal tampering, damage and plagiarism during 
transmission and storage [18]. 
III. POWER GRID BIG DATA ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM 
The system consists of five main bodies, as shown in Fig. 
1. 
Grid Operator (GO): As a certification center, the GO is 
responsible for setting up the smart grid system, distributing 
GIDs to users, and granting access to users. In addition, GO 
distributes identity keys for legitimate users. 
Multiple Distribution Operators (DGOs): As multiple 
attribute authorities, each DGO is responsible for establishing 
its own domain, managing attributes, and distributing attribute 
keys to users according to the attribute set. 
Cloud storage server: It is responsible for storing power 
data in the form of ciphertext. The cloud storage server does 
not participate in the access control and data decryption 
process.

Power data owners: Power data owners include RTUs and 
power consumers. The owner of the power data can define an 
access policy, use it to encrypt the power data, and upload it to 
the cloud storage server. 
Users: Users may be maintainers, system engineers, 
researchers, policymakers, and auditors of power systems 
[19]. After the user downloads the encrypted power data from 
the cloud storage server, if the user wants to decrypt it, he 
needs to prove his identity to GO and initiate a key request to 
DGOs. 
A. Fine-grained Shared Security Game Strategy 
This section will elaborate the security model of the 
scheme based on the security game between the attacker A  
and the simulator B . Among them, the security game will 
have the following stages: 
Initialization: attacker A  sends fine-grained authority 
*
kDGO
 to emulator B , and d gets the public parameter 
pp
 
of the system. 
Authority establishment: for each fine-grain authority, that 
simulator B  runs an authority establishment algorithm. The 
public key kPK
 and the private key kSK
 are obtained, and 
then the public key kPK
 is published to A  [20]. 
Stage 1: Attacker A  submits attribute vector 
y
 and GID 
and initiates a user key challenge to impersonator B . Wherein 
the vector 
y
 is generated by encoding the attribute set 'S  
randomly selected by A . B  runs the user key generation 
algorithm and replies the corresponding ,k jSK
 and gidSK
 to
A . In phase 1, A  may interrogate the key within the PPT. 
Challenge: A  submits two messages 0M
. 1M
of equal 
length and two policy vectors 0x
, 1x
to B . Wherein, the 
vectors 0x
 and 1x
 are respectively encoded and generated by 
the access strategies 
'
0W
 and 
'
1W
selected by A  [21]. But it 
must be satisfy that neither that vector 0x
 nor the vector 1x
 is 
orthogonal 
y
, that is, 0 1( , 0) ( , 0)x y x y    
. 
Simulator B  tosses a coin to generate a random bit 
 0,1 
, and then runs the encryption algorithm to generate 
the corresponding ciphertext 
CT  and sends it to attacker A . 
Stage 2: As in stage 1, A  then makes a user key challenge 
to B . But must satisfy that vector 0x
. Neither 1x
 nor the 
vector 
y
 is orthogonal. 
Guess: A  guesses 

and gives 
'
. If 
' =
, then A  
wins and the winning margin is

B. Threshold Access Policy 
The key technologies of threshold access policy encoding 
are divided into the following two parts: 
1) The access policy W is transformed into a vector x : 
First, the power data owner defines an access policy

Then, for each element ,i jt

attribute-based access control scheme supporting privacy

System initialization: This phase consists of the following 
two algorithms. GO generates the whole system by running 
the system establishment algorithm, and DGOs generates its

bilinear group 1 2 1 2( , , , , , , )Tp g g e G G G

       (6) 
Authentication and key distribution: When a user joins the 
system, GO assigns a unique GID to the user. If the user wants 
to decrypt the ciphertext, first, the user needs to convert the 
attribute set S into a vector 
  1,jy y j L= 
, the user needs 
to submit the attribute set S and the attribute vector 
y
 to 
request the key from GO. For the legal user who has 
completed the registration, GO will distribute the identity key 
gidSK
 with the signature to the legal user by running the 
identity key generation algorithm. Next, the user needs to 
submit the attribute set S, the attribute vector 
y
, and the 
identity key gidSK
 with the GO signature to request the 
attribute key from the DGOs. Each kDGO
 then uses Verify 
to verify the signature. Once the verification is passed, each 
kDGO
 generates attribute keys ,k jSK
 by running the 
attribute key generation algorithm and sends them to the user. 
This process involves the following two algorithms: 
Identity key generation (GO-KeyGen): For the 
authentication center GO in the system, randomly select two 
vectors 
( 1) ,k k

 and calculate the user identity key:

Where, 
( , )u H GID y=

Attribute key generation (DGOS-KeyGen): For each 
authority kDGO
 in the system, it is first necessary to convert 
the attribute set kS
 into a vector

data pM

and the ciphertext pCT
 is uploaded.

Data recovery: Any user can access the power data 
encrypted in the cloud, but only when S W⊥ , the authorized 
user can successfully decrypt it. In order to reduce the cost of 
decryption, the decryption process is divided into two stages: 
decryption test and complete decryption. The user first runs 
the test algorithm to verify S W⊥  or S W . If 
( , ) 1F W S =
 
is output, the user runs the full decryption algorithm; 
otherwise, the decryption is terminated. Details are as follows:

VI. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS 
A. Experimental Platform 
The experimental environment builds a micro-cloud 
environment to simulate the big data service under the cloud 
platform. The server-side and client-side configurations are 
shown in Table I. 
This paper is based on the Pairwise Cryptography 
Laboratory (PBC) and uses 160-bit elliptic curve groups over 
a 512-bit finite field, which are used to calculate the cost of 
the test operation and the decryption operation. 
B. Performance Analysis 
In the simulation test, 1GE
, 2GE
and TGE
 respectively 
represent the time cost of an index operation in 1G
, 2G
 and 
TG
. WN
and SN
 represent the number of attributes in the 
access policy and user attribute set, respectively. The ê  
represents the time cost required to compute a bilinear 
function. The 
( )O H
 represents the time required to compute 
a hash function. The ip
 indicates the number of possible 
values for a multivalued attribute. 
1) Theoretical analysis: In Table II, this scheme is further 
compared with scheme [22-25] from four aspects of key 
generation cost, encryption cost, test cost and decryption cost.

It can be seen from Table III that this scheme is more 
efficient than the scheme [25] in the key generation and 
decryption stages because of the calculation of the hash 
function in the scheme [25]. 
2) Simulation test: The actual performance of the present 
protocol and the protocol [25] will be tested. The results show 
that, compared with the scheme [25], the present scheme has 
obvious advantages in both the key distribution phase and the 
decryption phase. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the storage 
cost of this scheme and the scheme [25] in each stage of the 
algorithm. In the simulation, the lengths of the elements in the 
bilinear groups 1G
, 2G
, and TG
 are set to 512 bits. Assume 
that there are 10 authorities in the system, that is, 10N = , 
and specify that each authority manages five attributes.

Fig. 2. Storage Cost Comparison. 
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that, compared with the scheme 
[25], the construction of this scheme requires less space to 
store the public key and the secret key of the user. Fig. 3, Fig. 
4 and Fig. 5 respectively show the running time comparison of 
the user key distribution algorithm, the encryption algorithm 
and the decryption algorithm in this scheme and the scheme 
[25]. 
Fig. 3 shows that the running time of the user key 
distribution algorithm of the two schemes increases linearly 
with the number of attribute sets. 
As can be seen from Fig. 4, the efficiency of the 
encryption algorithm in this scheme is obviously low, which is 
a compromise for security performance.

Fig. 4. Time Comparison of Encryption Algorithms. 
 
Fig. 5. Time Comparison of Decryption Algorithms. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the decryption test algorithm in this 
scheme takes significantly less time than the full decryption 
algorithm. If the attribute set of the user does not satisfy the 
access policy, the scheme only executes the decryption test 
algorithm and does not need to execute the complete 
decryption operation. Due to the decryption test operation, the 
time required for successful decryption of the present scheme 
is much shorter than that of the scheme [25]. 
C. Discussion 
If the distributions of encryption and decryption are 
statistically similar, there is no one simulator B that can 
distinguish the two strategies by any advantage. 
Proof: In the challenge phase, simulator B randomly 
selects A, to satisfy. 
Then generate:

is 
uniformly distributed in the group. Therefore, there is no 
adversary that can distinguish strategies 
3Game
 and 4Game
 
with any advantage. 
In the strategy 
4Game , in the opponent's view, the choice 
of b by the simulator B is statistically independent, and the 
opponent cannot win the strategy by any advantage. 
If the K-Linear assumption holds, the privacy-preserving 
power data access control scheme is IND-CPA secure. 
It is proved that under the k-Linear assumption, based on 
the proof of the above lemma, the attacker's advantage in 
winning the real security strategy is negligible. Therefore, the 
attacker cannot break the scheme in the PPT. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a fine-grained access control scheme is 
proposed to support data sharing in the smart grid. The main 
work includes: 
1) The decentralized attribute-based encryption scheme is 
extended to the smart grid system, which is based on a more 
flexible threshold access structure. 
2) In order to improve the efficiency, a test phase is added 
before the data is completely decrypted, which avoids many 
unnecessary decryption operations. 
3) Based on the k-Linear assumption, it is proved that the 
scheme achieves adaptive security. 
Performance analysis shows that this scheme has obvious 
advantages compared with similar schemes. 
The content of this paper can protect the privacy 
information of the trajectory data, and improve the availability 
of the data. Finally, through the experimental verification, it is 
proved that the proposed method not only protects the privacy 
information of trajectory data but also improves the 
availability of data. 
In the next step, when the privacy budget is allocated by 
the special series method. Although infinitely many points can 
be protected, if there are too many position points in trajectory 
data, the smaller the privacy budget allocated to the later 
position points is, the larger the corresponding added random 
noise is. Then, the availability of the data will be reduced.
