Abstract. Recently, due to the development of network and the development of
hardware, users can enjoy games anywhere, and as a result various games have
been developed so that items in the game using cash and game cache have
skyrocketed. The user (participant) uses his cash and game cache to estimate the
probability and make the investment. However, there is a problem that the item
does not come out even though the number of times of approaching the prob-
ability is reached. The reason is that developers can manipulate the probability
information stored in the database, and the data of the probability game can be
recorded uncertainly so that users can suffer damage. In this paper, we propose a
reliable system based on a blockchain for a random item in a game. The
developer marks the probability in the blockchain. The user can verify the
information stored in the blockchain. Since the event that the user participates in
is also stored in the blockchain, the user verifies/checks the information stored in
the blockchain, thereby enhancing the reliability of the corresponding game.

1 Introduction
The recent development of wired and wireless networks and the development of
hardware that allows games to be played, users can enjoy games regardless of location
and time. Developers develop various games to satisfy users’ needs. Developers needed
funds to maintain their games, and developers have made many attempts to cover them.
To make a purchase of a game, to purchase a piece of the update at the time of an
additional update, or to sell an item in a game for a fee. Among them, the items in the
game occupied a lot of demand, and the developers applied the probability to the items
in the game to induce the user to make a lot of demand. The user (participant) uses his
cash and game cache to estimate the probability of the item and make an investment.
However, there is a problem that the item does not come out even though the number of
times of approaching the probability is reached. The reason is that developers can
manipulate the probability information stored in the database, and the data of the
probability game can be recorded uncertainly so that users can suffer damage. In this
paper, we propose a reliable system based on a blockchain for a random item in a game.
The developer marks the probability in the blockchain. The user can (participant)

information stored in the blockchain, thereby enhancing the reliability of the corre-
sponding game.

2.1 Game Market
The game market is experiencing explosive growth with the addition of traditional PC,
video and mobile gaming environments due to advances in network and hardware.
Mobile cloud enabled us to implement high-performance mobile games in our mobile
environment [1], and PC and video games are now available thanks to the development
of GPU. Table 1 lists game revenues worldwide. China spends about 37,945 M dollars
on games, followed by the United States and Japan [2]. As such, the game market
represents a large industry. Game companies make consumers pay the right price for
maintaining the game, and the first is that they pay for the game when they buy the
game. Second, every time a game is updated, consumers pay for the update. Third,
there is a different way of paying the price depending on the amount of game users use.
Finally, there is a way to make profits by selling paid items in games.
2.2 Blockchain Technology
A blockchain is linked to a chain based on a technique for creating a block that stores
transactions. It is stored in a distributed data store. Any public blockchain can read
transaction data and add transactions. The data stored in the blockchain is verified from
other nodes after the block is created, and the recorded transaction cannot be deleted.
Therefore, it is possible to prevent the forgery and alteration of the data, If the block is
not occupied by more than 51%, the block will be reliable [4]. There are public

blockchains, private blockchains, and consortium as types of blockchains. In the public
blockchain, the bitcoin and ethereum are typically used, and transaction details use a
proof-of-work method to verify the modulation by an attacker and to detect and gen-
erate an abnormal block [3]. The private blockchain is available only to a specific user,
and if it is not possible to disclose the data, it will use the private bloc chain. The
private blockchain may not focus on cryptography, and instead uses a competing
algorithm such as the Federated Byzantine agreement (FBA) instead of the PoW to
validate in the public blockchain [5]. It also has fast processing speed and high data
throughput, so it can have fast response speed [6]. Consortium blockchains are only
available to consortium users, and data write and read permissions and block creation
are only available to consortium participants. Because it has the advantages of public
blockchain and private blockchain, it is mainly used between government and private
enterprise, it has some anonymity, and it can have fast processing speed [7] (Table 2).
3 Conclusion
Recently, the game market has grown rapidly due to the development of network and
hardware, and various game services have been operated in a form in which users pay
for the maintenance of their games. Players are paying more money from users by
adding the odds on the items in the game and the items in the game. In this paper, we
propose blockchain based random item acquisition to provide reliable game service.
The proposed blockchain based service stores the intrinsic probability of an item in a
blockchain. When a user (participant) participates in acquiring a specific item, the
user’s information is also stored in the blockchain transaction, And the probability of
manipulation of the developer can be prevented. Future research will implement a
service framework for preventing probability data in other environments.
