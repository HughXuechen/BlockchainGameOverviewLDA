ABSTRACT This paper studies the blockchain cryptographic tokens by means of mean-field-type game the-
ory. It introduces the variance-aware utility function per decision-maker to capture the risk of cryptographic
tokens associated with the uncertainties of technology adoption, network security, regulatory legislation, and
market volatility. We establish a relationship between the network characteristics, token price, number of
token holders, and token supply. Both in-chain diversification and cross-chain diversification among tokens
are examined by using amean-variance approach. The results suggest that the number of tokens in circulation
needs to be adjusted in order to capture risk-awareness and self-regulatory behavior in blockchain token
economics. The Sharpe and Modigliani ratios for cryptographic tokens are revisited.

I. INTRODUCTION
In basic game theory, a utility function of a decision-maker
should capture its preferences and its satisfaction for using
an action. The satisfaction drives the demand of the agent,
which in turn drives the price together with the supply.
Network economics applies a similar principle by includ-
ing network characteristics. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer
network. A blockchain is a distributed cryptographic ledger
shared amongst all participating nodes, over which every data
or transaction is recorded. The transactions are collected in
blocks, which are found in a random process from the proto-
col. Some blockchains have cryptographic tokens and some
others do not. In the context of cryptographic assets, a utility
function of an agent would be dependent on the number of
tokens in circulation in the blockchain, the demand, which is
the aggregated drives of agents or entities, the network char-
acteristics (security, vulnerability, delay), and incentives to
verifiers (miners, validators, stakeholders, delegates, enough-
token-holders etc). The game-theoretic incentives are key
elements (i) for developers to deliver a high quality product,
(ii) for users to adopt the platform, (iii) for the verifiers to
engage in a desired set of behaviors, (iv) for all to enable a
medium of exchange.

A. RELATED WORKS
Earlier to the cryptographic tokens, token economics [1], [2]
had similar issues and obstacles in community settings. These
obstacles included identifying procedures to enhance pro-
gram efficacy, to train staff, to overcome client resistance, to
promote long-term maintenance and transfer of training, to
the extension of the token economy to institutional settings,
to integrate token economieswithin existing institutional con-
straints, and the disseminability of the procedures on a large
scale. More than four decades later, most of these difficul-
ties on adoption, utility, self-regulation apply to the current
cryptographic token-based networks. Blockchain-based star-
tups have embraced initial coin offerings, initial token offer-
ings, pre-sale tokens, initial exchange offering, as a vehicle
to raise early capital. The cryptographic tokens offered in
these sales are intended to fill a widely large set of roles
on different platforms. Moreover, cryptographic tokens pose
new challenges in terms of distributed network security and
distributed denial of service, which affects token’s demand
and price. As indicated in [3], designing a successful token
must take into account certain aspects of computer science,
monetary theory, financial economics, and game theory. The
work in [4] examines blockchain economics by means of two
approaches: innovation-centric and governance-centric. The
authors discussed how the governance approach, based on
new institutional economics and public choice economics,
can create spontaneous organizations, i.e., new types of

economies. The authors in [5] examine how value can be
created out from blockchain and how tokens, and indeed the
entire blockchain economic system, operate as something
like a vote of confidence. Blockchain-based cryptographic
tokens provide online data and open sources, and hence the
evolution of market prices can be analyzed. Based on a set
of 143 cryptocurrencies for a sample spanning 2014-2018,
the work in [6] shows that, there is no evidence of sig-
nificant momentum payoffs, supporting the view that the
cryptocurrency market is getting more efficient. The work
in [7] examines 456 different cryptocurrencies, and show that
return predictability diminishes in cryptocurrencies with high
market liquidity. The authors in [9] proposed a simulation
framework for blocking projects including offers and return
on investment. At the time of writing this paper, 2154 crypto-
graphic tokens are displayed at coinmarketcap.com and their
(reported) prices evolution are available online. For more
recent references on blockchain technologies we refer the

B. CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER
This article studies basic game theoretic token incentives in
risk-aware blockchain technologies. We revisit basic prin-
ciples of network economics using mean-field-type game
theory [54], [57]. We examine risk-aware game-theoretic
models that combine risk-awareness, prices, and the secu-
rity of both the network and the number of active partic-
ipants. Despite its simplicity, the setting yields insightful
implications for the equilibrium relation between the fun-
damental notions of token economics: the demand and the
supply sides of the blockchain-based cryptographic token
market. As the variance appears in the payoff functional, one
obtains a distribution-dependent payoff. Moreover, the payoff
functional of each agent is non-linear with the respect the
probability distribution of the state. This leads to a class
of variance-aware mean-field-type games, which are games
with non-linearly distribution-dependent payoffs. Our contri-
bution can be summarized as follows (see Figure 1):
• Token-less Blockchain economy (Proposition 1): we
show that the optimal investment of decision-maker
i in the token-free blockchain shares the following
interesting features:
– increases with the total number of active partici-
pants to the token-free blockchain.
– increases with the productivity
– decreases with the probability of success of an
attack of the blockchain by malicious nodes.
• Token-based Blockchain economy (Proposition 2):
we show that the optimal number of tokens of a
decision-maker has the following interesting features:
– increases with the total number of active partici-
pants in the blockchain.
– decreases with the probability of success of an
attack.
– decreases with the token price
– increases with the productivity
– increases with interest rate of the token price.
• Token adoption (Proposition 3): we provide sufficient
conditions under which the token enables and improves
the adoption of blockchain technology.
• Token diversification within the chain: We show how to
diversity in-chain tokens under correlated prices.
• Token diversification cross-chains: The methodology
extends to cross-chain tokens with different access costs.
C. STRUCTURE
The rest of this article is structured as follows. Section II
presents a definition of a mathematical definition of a
blockchain, and analyzes the token outcomes: adoption,
demand, and supply. Section III focuses on token diversifi-
cation and exchange cross-chain and within the chain.
II. MEAN-FIELD-TYPE GAME-THEORETIC SETUP
A. BLOCKTREE
A blocktree is a 2-tuple (B, E), where:B ⊂ B, is a non-empty
set of valid blocks, including at least one element b0 (the
genesis block). Let E ⊂ B2 such that it exists a unique path

from the initial block b0 to any other block. A total order �
over B, preserving E, i.e.
(b, b′) ∈ E H⇒ b′ � b.
The blockchain is the unique path from the genesis block
b0 to the last block max� B. A blockchain is built by a
network of processes applying sequentially the expansion
operation starting from the initial blocktree {b0, {}}. In the
distributed case, every processing node refers to its own view
of the blocktree and strives to build a consensus with each
other on the shared blockchain while increasing its depth.
Regular nodes try to build valid blocks. When such valid
block is found by a node, it expands its local blocktree from
its last block (i.e. the last block of its own view of the
blockchain) and broadcasts it to the others. When a regular
node receives a new block from another one, it updates its
local blocktree expanding it with the new block. During this
updating phase, forks may actually be observed due to blocks
broadcasting delay. Building a new valid block is an opera-
tion that may take many forms depending on the blockchain
protocols. Several type of nodes are considered depending
on the behaviors: empathy-altruism, regular, spiteful and
malicious behaviors. There are several consensus algorithms
implemented in the blockchain literature (see Tables 1 and 2
below). As of today, there is no chain-based protocol that
outperforms all the others. Each protocol has pros and contras
(network performance, end-to-end delay, security, cost) as
well as the economic and game theoretic analysis (utility,
gain, cost, adoption, medium of exchange) should be taken
into consideration. The evolution of the protocols [51] may
suggest co-existence and randomization among the class of
better protocols. However, the randomization of better proto-
cols will have a different cost and different outcome. Thus,
the tradeoffs need to be designed and analyzed.
B. BLOCKCHAIN WITHOUT TOKENS
To proceed, let us consider a basic setup where risk-aware
users can conduct businesses and enjoy the exchange surplus
on the blockchain platform without holding tokens, but by
using a base currency (e.g., dollar, euro, yuan), the numeraire,
as a medium of exchange. Let us consider the following
risk-aware best-response problem:

whereB is a Brownianmotion,wi is the flow of good achieved
on the blockchain by transacting in its native cryptographic
token by decision-maker i, xi is the amount in dollar used in
decision-maker i, n is the total number of decision-makers
that decide to join the blockchain network (i.e., xi > 0,).
h is a positive one-to-one mapping. a is a binary random
variable representing the state of the attack, a = 1 when the

attack is successful. Aλi is the productivity of i. The initial
flow of good is positive wi(t0) > 0. Here, the interaction
with other decision-makers occurs through the term n(t) =∑
i 1{xi(t)>0}. The parameter ηi is a risk-awareness index of
decision-maker i.The power parameter for the dollars amount
in the dynamics (1) is given by ρ ∈ (0, 1). The term ξ is
the instant access cost, and it can be expressed as a function
of waiting cost. An example of such a function was derived
in [23] using queueing theory.

Delays are costly to the users and the delay costs per unit
time are distributed randomly with cumulative distribution F ,
whereDK is the expected waiting time measured in blocks of
size K , λ̂ is the arrival rate of request, and µ̂ is the service
rate.
Note that, this game problem (1) is not a standard
stochastic differential game problem because of the vari-
ance term. This is a variance-aware mean-field-type game
problem [8], [54], [55], [58].
Proposition 1 (No tokens): The equilibrium strategy of i in
the token-less blockchain technology is
x∗i =
(ρ

) 1

where Ã = A(1 − ν)

(by malicious node or a group of malicious nodes) succeeds
under the blockchain protocol.

where Fλi is the cumulative function of the productivity ran-
dom variable.
To prove this proposition we have used a dynamic pro-
gramming principle for mean-field-type games. As the drift
does not contain the state variable wi and the reformulation
do not have a running payoff, the equilibrium strategies are
obtained by one-shot direct optimization for each decision-
maker.
Notice that the optimal investment of decision-maker i in
the token-free blockchain shares the following interesting
features:
• increases with the total number of active participants to
the token-free blockchain.
• increases with the productivity Aλi of the token-free
blockchain.
• decreases with the probability of success ν of an attack
of the blockchain by malicious nodes.
C. REDUCTION OF THE COST OF VERIFICATION
Settlement is the process of transferring an asset or
information to another party. Reconciliation ensures that
internal records pertaining to a particular transaction are con-
sistent across the relevant parties. Transfers of cryptographic
assets through a distributed digital ledger require verification
because electronic objects files, unlike physical objects, can
be easily duplicated or changed. For this, a blockchain net-
work needs verifiers. In a centralized network, a specific node
(a firm or an institution) is entrusted with the responsibil-
ity of verification. In exchange, it charges users with fees.
In a distributed network, verification tasks are not delegated
to a single node but to different members of the network.
Trust does not rely on a node, but on the behavior of the
network and its protocols. The verifiers contribute resources

that deliver a certain level of trust. A consensus protocol allow
participants to agree on a common output that aggregates
private inputs when some dishonest (who do not follow the
process) participants may attack the process. This question,
known as the byzantine agreement, was studied in [12], [13].
The cost of verification of the blockchain will be affected
by the used protocol and the economic incentives to the
verifiers [20]. If there is a significant reduction of cost of
verification of the blockchain compared with the traditional
operation, then part of this saving can be used to fund token
at the beginning of the blockchain. Below, we examine the
effect of tokens on the blockchain economy.
D. BLOCKCHAIN WITH A NATIVE TOKEN
In the current blockchain technology, token economics and
legislation are important challenges to be addressed. Before
issuing a token, it is important to define the goal, con-
text and objectives of that token. Does it add value to the
blockchain project? Does the token price have an economic
demand-supply values fit?
Next, we evaluate a native token introduced in the
blockchain from a non-zero price p(0) and non-zero produc-
tion A(0).

dA = A(dAdt + σAdBA),
A(0) > 0,
dp = p(dpdt + σpdBp),
p(0) > 0. (3)
Now, n is the total number of decision-makers who decide
to join the blockchain network (i.e., ui > 0, to hold some
tokens). uipE[ dpp ] is the token appreciation and ξ is the access
cost. We rename dp to be dp(1 − ν)

(1−ρ) . We provide the
changes compared with the results of Proposition 1.
Proposition 2 (With tokens): The equilibrium strategy of i
is

The number of participants in the blockchain with tokens is

In order to prove this proposition, we have used again
dynamic programming principle for mean-field-type games.
Only the drift is modified and the new drift does not con-
tain the state variable wi. There is no running payoff. Thus,
the equilibrium strategies are obtained by one-shot direct
optimization for each decision-maker.
The optimal number of tokens of decision-maker i has the
following interesting features:
• increases with the total number of active participants in
the blockchain.
• decreases with the probability of success ν of an attack.
• decreases with the token price p
• increases with the productivity Aλ
• increases with interest rate dp of the token price
As observed in practice, the network security affects the price,
the adoption and the sustainability of blockchain technolo-
gies. This simple model captures that behavior.
Proposition 3: If the network security level is identical
νto = νnto = ν, then the following inequality holds:
nto > nnto.
This means that the introduction of token can boost the
adoption and participation to the blockchain technology.
Proof: The proof follows from the monotonicity of F
and the fact that ρ
[r−dp]
( r−dp

)
1
1−ρ is monotone with dp.
The demand is D = 1
p (

1−ρ [h(κton̄)Ãκton̄], and the
supply of tokens is Sto. Hence, the following formula holds
in equilibrium:
Sto =

p
(
ρ
r − dp
)
1
1−ρ [h(κton̄)Ãκton̄]. (5)
This determines a token price formula pto of the tokenized
blockchain technology as a function of the total population
size n̄, token user base κto and the supply of tokens Sto.
pto =

The velocity [52] of a token is the number of times (fre-
quency) that the token is exchanged from one transaction to
another over the period of time [0,T ], or in other words, how
often token is turned over. The token velocity is a crucial
parameter in influencing the value of the token. Based on (6),
if the target is a big market size n with a scarce supply S,
when the token has high velocity, then there will only be lim-
ited value appreciation potential to the token. Token velocity
should be taken into consideration in the design of dp.
Note that, if we modify the utility function by inserting
uidp instead of uipE[ dpp ], the result would be completely dif-
ferent in terms of the nice properties mentioned above. This is
because dp will bring the controlled diffusion term uipσpdB
which affects the optimization part with a term 1

we use uiE[dp] instead of uipE[ dpp ], one obtains a function of

of the token-less blockchain νnto, the token creates a negative
effect and the number of active users will decrease. The
ability of the token to create a positive value, to boost adop-
tion or to be a medium of exchange depends the parameters
mentioned above.
E. SPECIFIC CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKEN
We apply the methodology to blockchain-based networks
whose consensus algorithms rely on pure PoS and Algo-
rand. The analysis of Bitcoin and PoW can be found
in [14]–[19], [21], [22], Ethereum and lighting network
incentives [50]. Algorand [46]–[48] is based on the crypto-
graphic sortition mechanism [46], [49] i.e., for every round,
it efficiently selects only few verifiers, this is made randomly
from the set of all users, and in a way that it is unpredictable
until the very last moment. The original protocol of Algorand
does not specify an incentive to verifiers. As the temporary
verifiers are among the token holders, they may have wanted
to protect their own tokens. Thismakes a lower cost validation
procedure if there is enough participation and if the number
of regular nodes is high enough. How to get enough partici-
pation of honest nodes, to be connected online at any random
time?
• Voluntary contributors from token holders and/
or those with good reputations (above a certain
threshold)
• Community or federation-based contributors who are
token holders and with good reputation states
• Incentives for truly decentralized nodes who are token
holders and good reputation states.
In order to encourage participation frommore than amajor-
ity of randomly selected committee members, the nodes who
honestly participate get an award (in tokens). If a malicious
node is detected, then that node will not be rewarded and
disincentive schemes are applied.
1) INCENTIVES FOR VERIFIERS
In order to consolidate the incentives to the verifiers, we pro-
pose to add a relatively small award (in token) to the randomly
selected verifiers for their service. They consume energy to
send and propagate messages whenever active. Thus, the pro-
duction (supply) is not at free cost. One should consider
the cost of delivering (end-to-end delay and timely) such
a task. Each verifier will have a specific state depending
on their reputation score. The verifier will be its reputa-
tion increased after a successful completion of a transaction.
A detected malicious behavior will have its reputation state
to be decreased if detected. After a certain time step in the
evolution of protocol, the number of nodes with high reputa-
tion state is big enough. The probability of selection can now
combine token and reputation or between two types of tokens
as illustrated in Figure 2.
A typical example of committee selection is to choose a
proportional probability to
[e(toi−t̄o)]λ[e(ri−r̄)](1−λ), or
λ[e(toi−t̄o)]+ (1− λ)e(ri−r̄),
where ri is the current reputation of i and toi is the number of
tokens that i is holding in the system. If a malicious node is
detected, then the user’s reputation is set down to zero as well
as its token state.
In a single interaction between a set of verifiers and an
user, the verifiers have no incentive to provide services to
the user. The mechanism we study for creating incentives
to provide service involves the exchange of cryptographic
tokens. Each agent can hold an arbitrary non-negative number
of cryptographic tokens, but cannot hold a negative number
of cryptographic tokens and cannot borrow.
The blockchain creates incentives for the verifiers and
nodes to provide or share resources, by either providing a
supply of tokens or by recommending strategies on their

reputation. The best response strategies depend on the current
token holdings and reputation.
For node i to send information to node k, a fully distributed
and random number of nodes are selected to form a com-
mittee J . The committee J is selected based specific random
process. A strategy profile is a collection (si, sk , {sj}j∈J ). sj
output maps to acceptance or rejection for j to participate to
the vote as a honest node, or to attack or not if a malicious
node. If requested service is provided, a portion of tokens is
transferred to the committee members and to shared equally.
The client’s holding of tokens decreases by tos and each
verifier holding of tokens increases by 1
|J | tos. Let ū is the per
capita supply of tokens. The distribution of token holdings
between verifiers should satisfy the following equalities:∑
to
µ(to) = 1,∑
to
to µ(to) = ū, (7)
2) ADOPTION-DEPENDENT PRICE
With a pure proof-of-stake the more tokens a user keeps in
its accounts, the more chance of being selected at one of
the voting rounds. However, its vote counts as one single
vote and voter replaceability holds. We change d̃p = dp +
λ̃h(n) to capture the dependence of the price on the number
nodes participating to the blockchain. Also, the productivity
d̃A = dA + λ̃h(n) changed because the random committee
is drawn from the population sampling at each round. These
changes do affect the above calculations. In particular, the
fixed equation (4) is changed. Does a token-rich agent have an
incentive to save tokens instead of spending them within the
blockchain? There should be an incentive such that the token
can enable as a kind of medium of exchange while avoiding
rewarding to those who send back and forth.
III. MANAGING TOKENS: DIVERSIFICATION
AND EXCHANGE
Once the native token is adopted in the system, one can
diversify with several other projects and tokens. We consider
two different tokens with price dynamics given by
dp1 = p1(d1dt + σ1dB1),
p1(0) > 0,
dp2 = p2(d2dt + σ2dB2),
p2(0) > 0, (8)
where B1 and B2 are two Brownian motions (possibly corre-
lated such that E[dBidBj] = βijdt with βii = 1.) Empirical
observation from coin-market-cap shows a non-negligible
positive correlation of some cryptographic tokens with the
major tokens and some others have negative correlation.
So correlation between the random variable is reasonable in
the crypto networks. Tables 3 and 4 show the correlation
between some major cryptographic tokens in 2018 and 2017.
Daily prices of Bitcoin and ten other largest cryptocurrencies
by market capitalization are used (Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin
Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Tron, Cardano, IOTA, andMon-
ero). The entries are obtained using
cov(X ,Y ) :=
E[(X − E(X ))(Y − E(Y ))]√
E[(X − E(X ))2]E[(Y − E(Y ))2]
.
By stochastic integration formula one gets
d[(p1 − Ep1)(p2 − Ep2)]
= (p1 − Ep1)[(p2 − Ep2)d2 dt + p2σ2 dB2]
+ (p2 − Ep2)[(p1 − Ep1)d1dt + p1σ1dB1]
+ p2σ2p1σ1β12dt. (9)
Taking the expectation yields
d[cov(p1, p2)] = dE[(p1 − Ep1)(p2 − Ep2)]
= [d1 + d2 + σ1σ2β12]cov(p1, p2)
−E[p1]E[p2]σ1σ2β12, (10)
By direct computation, one has
E[p1]E[p2] = E[p1(0)]E[p2(0)]e(d1+d2)t .
Hence the covariance is
cov(p1, p2)
= e[d1+d2+σ1σ2β12]t {cov(p1(0), p2(0))
−E[p1(0)]E[p2(0)]σ1σ2β12
∫ t
0
e−[σ1σ2β12]t

= e[d1+d2+σ1σ2β12]tcov(p1(0), p2(0))
+ e[d1+d2]tE[p1(0)]E[p2(0)](eσ1σ2β12t − 1) (11)
This means that, even if B1 and B2 were uncorrelated, an ini-
tial correlation of the token prices will propagate and affect
both tokens prices law later on. The total token value is
m = p1 ui1 + p2 ui2, where uik is the number of tokens

Note that, the control action ui1 is constrained. The corre-

more involved.

The risk-awareness index ηi of decision-maker i plays an
important role in the optimal allocation strategy. From the
terminal condition: αi(T ) = ηi > 0. This means that ηi
affects significantly the value of (τ̄i, ei) which in turn affects
the value of E[m]
A. SHARPE AND MODIGLIANI RATIOS FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS
The Sharpe ratio [59], [60] was developed by Nobel laure-
ate William F. Sharpe and it is used to help investors to
understand the return of an investment compared to its risk
(Table 5 shows a sample data of the Sharpe ratio from long-
hash.com). The classical Sharpe ratio is the average return
earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility
or total risk. For cryptographic tokens, we do not recom-
mend to use the risk-free model. We instead recommend
a risk-reference model because of empirical volatility. We
consider two cryptographic token assets with parameters
(dk , σk ). The parameters τi, τ̄i, ei can be seen as functions of
modified Sharpe ratios.

.
As both cryptographic token prices are volatile, we mod-
ify the evaluation criteria. Mimicking Modigliani and
Modigliani [61], [62] who proposed a slightly modified ratio,
one can consider the ratio
M2
:= E[rk − rref ]
σref
σrk
+ E[rref ],
with rk being the return on cryptographic token k, σrk is
the variance on cryptographic token k, rref is the return on
the market reference, and σref is the variance on the market
reference. It is in units of percentage return, which is instantly
interpretable by the crypto users and investors. Note that ei
can be rewritten as
ei =
 m0
γi
σ 22 αi
σ1

((d1 − d2)σ2

.
The last factor
(
(d1 − d2)

σ1
)
can be seen as M2
− E[rref ],
therefore it is related to the Modigliani ratio.
B. IN-CHAIN DIVERSIFICATION
Consider two tokens within the same blockchain technol-
ogy. The network characteristics are similar. In terms of
utility function, the token diversification problem between
decision-makers is the following risk-aware mean-field-type
game problem: [53], [57]:
sup

ηi

var[wi(T )], subject to

dm = [d2 m+ p1ui1(d1 − d2)]dt
+ σ1 p1 ui1dB1 + σ2(m− p1 ui1)dB2,
m(0) > 0,
dA = A(dAdt + σAdB),
0 ≤ p1ui1 ≤ m,
n =
∑
i
1{ui1>0} + 1{p1ui1<m}, (20)
In the in-chain procedure, there is a need of token circulation
at a later stage. To so do, one can incentivize users for
spending tokens. However, sending back and forth between
two accounts may be penalized.
C. CROSS-CHAIN DIVERSIFICATION
We now consider cross-chain diversification between
two tokens from two different blockchains. The network
characteristics: productivity and security level Ak , ak , νk are
different. The utility characteristics: hk , λik , ρk , ξkk ′ , rk are
different. Likewise, the number of token adopters nto1 and
nto2 are also different.

D. ARBITRARY NUMBER OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS
We consider L different tokens, L ≥ 2 being arbitrary and∑L
i=1 Ki correlated noises. The token dynamics is given by
dm = [d1m+

L∑
i=2
piui ≤ m, (22)
with the correlation E[dBijdBkl] = βijkldt, βijij = 1 for any
(i, j). The unconstrained constraint problem can be explicitly
solved by using the above methodology. However, the prob-
lem is constrained by the state m. Thus, a projection into the
set {u |
∑L
i=1 piui = m, ui ≥ 0}, which is a weighted simplex
may be required.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have studied basic cryptographic token
on blockchain using variance-aware mean-field-type games.
We have seen that incentives, network security, network delay
(via the productivity) affect the behavior of the agents. The
incentive proposed here exhibits the following features:
• A well-designed token can incentivize the agents and
boost participation (Proposition 3)
• The participation boosts demand and requests for ver-
ifiers. Then reputation and token are designed to give
incentives to verifiers and to disincentives malicious
nodes. The reputation allows to select verifiers who are
really known for their goodwork in the blockchain. They
do not necessarily have to have a large amount of native
tokens.
• As good works are completed, the quality-of-experience
is calculated, and more and more reputed nodes will be
available and those reputed agents will be selected for
verification and validation.
• This enables better network security, less delay, better
supply and a medium of exchange, which in turn enables
for demand.
As a future work, it would be interesting to examine incen-
tives for larger medium of exchange and possible extension
of this study beyond blockchains. The structure of the used
network and protocol play important roles in the verification
and validation of new information, data or transaction to be
added the network. Direct acyclic graph has been proposed as
an alternative network. It removes blocks and work directly
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Poisson Point Process.
