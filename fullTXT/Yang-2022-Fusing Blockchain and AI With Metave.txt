ABSTRACT Metaverse as the latest buzzword has attracted great attention from both industry and academia.
Metaverse seamlessly integrates the real world with the virtual world and allows avatars to carry out rich
activities including creation, display, entertainment, social networking, and trading. Thus, it is promising
to build an exciting digital world and to transform a better physical world through the exploration of the
metaverse. In this survey, we dive into the metaverse by discussing how Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) fuse with it through investigating the state-of-the-art studies across the metaverse components, digital
currencies, AI applications in the virtual world, and blockchain-empowered technologies. Further exploita-
tion and interdisciplinary research on the fusion of AI and Blockchain towards metaverse will definitely
require collaboration from both academia and industries. We wish that our survey can help researchers,
engineers, and educators build an open, fair, and rational future metaverse.
INDEX TERMS Metaverse, blockchain, artificial intelligence, economy system, digital economy.
I. INTRODUCTION
The concept of metaverse was proposed almost 30 years
ago in the science fiction named Snow Crash, written by
Neal Stephenson [3]. Metaverse has been one of the hottest
buzzwords to attract the tech industry’s attention due to
the rapid advancements of Blockchain, Internet of Things
(IoT), VR/AR, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud/Edge Com-
puting, etc. The sandbox game platform Roblox [4] is the
company that firstly incorporates the term ‘metaverse’ into
their prospectus and proposes the key characteristics (e.g.,
identity, friends, immersive experience, low friction, civil-
ity, economy, anywhere, variety) of metaverse. The social
company, Facebook, is renamed as Meta [5] to help bring
metaverse to life and make people meet each other, learn,
collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what they can
imagine. The video game Fortnite [6] that is released by
Epic games puts the players into a virtual world, such as
a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world, experiencing new
levels of photorealistic interaction [6]–[9] and watching vir-
tual concert [1]. Metaverse seamlessly integrates the physical
world with the virtual world and allows avatars to carry out
rich activities including creation, display, entertainment, so-
cial, and trading. Nowadays, both academia and industries
dive into the exploration of metaverse. For example, Jingteng
Tech [10] has developed BeamLink, by which users can
share photos, documents, and have an interactive meeting
collaboration, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Furthermore, the optical
sensors (e.g., depth and cameras) deployed with CNNs are
commonly applied to capture the gestures and movements of
dancers. The poses and movements of dancers, as shown in
Fig. 1(f), can be clustered as a high-dimensional feature space,
which is further converted into dance performance in vir-
tual environments [11] through techniques like dynamic time
wrapping [12]. Compared to the physical world, autonomous
avatars can understand human dancer’s voice-to-motion map-
ping. Powered by deep learning, avatars can also mimic dance

moves with high dance resemblance and emotional expres-
sions. Given those potentials of metaverse, a problem is that
researchers cannot accurately judge the shape and boundary
of the future metaverse. They could only envision some of its
possible characteristics, such as open space, decentralization,
human-computer interaction experience, digital assets, and
digital economy.
The avatars of human players, their creations, and con-
sumption in metaverse truly affect the physical world and
even change the behaviors of people in the physical world,
through the influence of people’s thoughts (e.g., choosing the
entertainment method). This change has a profound social sig-
nificance [13], [14], and thus forms the lifestyle of post-human
society while reconstructing the digital economic system. The
metaverse can be viewed as a complete and self-consistent
economic system, a complete chain of the production and
consumption of digital items. The economy of metaverse
refers to the digital production-based economic behaviors,
e.g., creation, exchange, and consumption in the digital world
are the fundamental components of the digital economy. The
development of the economic system can be regarded as one
of the most challenging tasks of metaverse. This is because
the production and consumption of digital assets that can be
traded in the virtual world is a phenomenon that traditional
economists have not encountered [15]. Moreover, in a public,
fair, and self-organized virtual world, the centralized eco-
nomic system of the physical world cannot operate efficiently
due to the high transaction volumes involved. Considering the
interaction between the virtual world and the physical world,
metaverse should enable the currency circulation to break the
barrier of life, products, learning, working, etc. Therefore,
the economic system of metaverse must be constructed in a
decentralized manner such that the virtual assets of avatars
could be traded efficiently in metaverse.
Blockchain as a decentralized ledger without a centralized
authority has drawn enormous attention in diverse applica-
tion fields in recent years. Blockchain is highly expected
to bring a variety of opportunities to metaverse, and trig-
ger a new round of technological innovation and industrial
transformation. On the other hand, recent advances in AI
have brought promising solutions to overcoming the chal-
lenges of metaverse development, such as Big Data analytics,
AI-empowered content generation, and intelligence deploy-
ment. Consequently, the integration of AI and blockchain
becomes a promising trend to promote the benign evolution
of the blockchain/AI-empowered metaverse ecosystem. Al-
though the advent of blockchain and AI has spawned a large
number of new technologies and applications, the fusion of
blockchain and AI with metaverse also poses several emerg-
ing research challenges. For example, transaction volumes in
metaverse systems are much higher than those in the physical
world due to the features of digital products and markets.
Blockchain-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) enable avatars
to generate the content that can be traded with their digital
certificates [16], [17].
We then review several representative survey articles here,
to highlight the difference between our survey. Lim et al. [18]
focus on the network demands [19] of metaverse from the per-
spective of edge intelligence [20] since metaverse is viewed
as ‘the successor to the mobile Internet’. Du et al. [21] pro-
pose a privacy-preserving targeted advertising strategy for the
wireless edge metaverse to enable metaverse service providers
to allocate network bandwidth to users so that the users can
access metaverse from edge sites. Jiang et al. [22] introduce
a kind of collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded
Distributed Computing to support the computation require-
ment of metaverse services [23]. The up-to-date survey [13]
mainly reviews the state-of-the-art technologies as enablers

to implement metaverse, such as high-speed networks (e.g.,
5 G) and edge computing, Blockchain, and AI. The authors’
findings demonstrate the gap between the up-to-date technolo-
gies and the demands of implementing metaverse. The other
survey [24] focuses on metaverse analytics, the search traffic,
news frequency, and the topic concerning sustainable growth.
Duan et al. [25] highlight the representative applications for
social goods and propose a three-layer metaverse architecture
from a macro perspective, which contains infrastructure, inter-
action, and ecosystem. In contrast, our survey discusses how
to fuse blockchain and AI technologies with metaverse. As
depicted in Fig. 2, AI technologies are applied to the digital
creation and digital market. Meanwhile, blockchain can guar-
antee digital assets, digital currencies, and the digital market.
On the other hand, in this survey, we emphasize the fusion
of AI and blockchain technologies to establish an intelligent,
open, fair, and promising future metaverse.
The contributions of the paper include the following three
points.
� We first present the preliminaries of the economic system
in the metaverse.
� We then discuss how blockchain and AI technologies
fuse with the metaverse, and review the state-of-the-art
studies.
� Finally, we envision typical challenges and open issues
to shape the future metaverse in the next decades.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
mainly describes the characteristic of the ecosystem of meta-
verse by comparing it with the conventional economy. Sec-
tion III discusses the artificial intelligence technologies and
the challenges of applications in the metaverse. In Section IV,
the fundamental Blockchain technologies and applications
FIGURE 3. Conventional economy and metaverse economy. icons are from

are introduced in metaverse by comparing with the current
breakthroughs. Section VI mainly discusses the challenges
and open issues of shaping the future metaverse. Finally, Sec-
tion VII concludes this paper.
II. PRELIMINARIES OF ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN
METAVERSE
The economy is the fundamental component of the metaverse.
From the more idealistic perspective, metaverse should be in-
teroperable such that users can trade virtual items like clothes
or cars from one platform to another. Firstly, as depicted in
Fig. 3, we shall describe the metaverse economic system ac-
cording to the mainstream games and existing research works.
The metaverse economic system is composed of four parts:

https://www.flaticon.com/
digital creation, digital asset, digital market, and digital cur-
rency, whose exploitation will lead to the transformation of
the conventional economy.
� Digital Creation is the foundation of the metaverse. The
creation progress is similar to the material products in
the physical world. The development of the economy
of the metaverse is decided by the number of creators.
Thus, the digital creation activities urgently need a basic
authoring tool that can make the creation easily and
personalized [26], [27]. The Decentraland [28] is a game
platform that provides two kinds of authoring tools for
creating interactive Decentraland applications, i.e., the
Builder and the Decentraland SDK. Players can execute
a simple drag and drop editor by the Builder without
coding required, while the Decentraland SDK enables
players to have sufficient freedom to create their appli-
cations. Lee et al. [29] summarize the research works
on computational arts that are relevant to the metaverse,
describing novel art work (e.g., immersive arts, robotic
arts.) in blended virtual-physical realities.
� Digital Asset has the hidden property, which is the
precondition of trade. For instance, in the FPS game
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, players can equip
their weapons with all kinds of ‘skins’ that shows the
asset attributes the ‘skins’ since the ‘skins’ can be ex-
changed, traded, or bought at the platforms (e.g., BUFF,
Steam). However, these trade platforms need to make
the users’ accounts known to the public, which might
incur privacy issues since there is no reliable mechanism
to guarantee the digital asset and platform. Hence, peo-
ple’s confirmation of digital assets is inseparable from
the value provided by the blockchain and the encryption
system of the blockchain. Because encryption algorithms
can capitalize on data, and consensus mechanisms help
people verify and confirm transactions.
� Digital Market is the fundamental place in which
avatars can trade to have income like in the physical
world. The mature market of metaverse that should en-
sure the creation of products and real trade accomplished
in metaverse must be different from the existing digi-
tal market. Bourlakis et al. [30] examine the evolution
of retailing, i.e., from traditional to electronic to meta-
verse retailing, and sheds light on the ways metaverse
influence that evolution. Cliff et al. [31] mainly discuss
the research that applies computational intelligence, i.e.,
the methods from AI and machine learning to automat-
ically discover, implement, and fine-tune strategies for
adaptive automated trading in financial markets. Decen-
traland marketplace [32] allows users to trade all their
Decentraland on-chain assets like what they could be-
have in the physical world.
� Digital Currency is the media in metaverse with which
the avatars can finish the trade and exchange. While in
the metaverse, fiat currency cannot satisfy the demands
of the development of the metaverse due to the high cost
of the legal currency system. In addition, fiat currency is
converted from physical currency (e.g., gold, silver) that
is different from the digital-based currency of metaverse.
Roblox enables players to buy various items by pur-
chase with real currency, from a recurring stipend given
to members with the premium membership, or from
other players by producing and selling virtual content
in Roblox [4]. The Diem payment system [33] supports
single-currency stablecoins (e.g., USD, EUR, and GBP)
and a multi-currency coin (XDX). We shall talk about
the fusion of blockchain in metaverse in section IV.
As demonstrated in The Wealth of Nations, the traditional
economics in the real world are based on some basic premises
such as the scarcity of resources, and selfish individuals [34].
In contrast, the individuals in the metaverse are selfless and
illogical. These individuals prefer to emphasize their personal
feeling such as happiness and a sense of accomplishment. This
is because there is no farming society and industrial society
experienced by human beings, and no traditional industrial
structure in the virtual world. In the metaverse, the conceptual
economy will be the basic form of economic activities. The
natural form of financial currency can no longer be precious
metals, but the virtual social currency. Hence, the difference
between the economy of the metaverse and the conventional
economy can be summarised as follows:
� In metaverse, identity determines value instead of the
undifferentiated labor in the conventional economy.
� The marginal benefits will increase in metaverse instead
of diminishing marginal benefits of production in the
physical world.
� The marginal costs of products will decrease, compared
with the physical world.
� Transaction costs in metaverse tend to zero, which will
incur frequent transactions.
Now, the metaverse economic system is still in its early
stage, because it can barely transplant and test the innovations
of the digital economy, including various digital currencies,
test cooperative economy, sharing economy, and inclusive fi-
nance. To enable an intelligent and secure metaverse, we think
that key technologies such as AI and blockchain should be
fused with the metaverse. Therefore, we review the related
studies that can offer us inspiration in the following sections.
III. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN METAVERSE
Artificial Intelligence is a research discipline proceeded based
on the hypothesis that every aspect of learning can in prin-
ciple be so precisely described [35]. The state-of-the-art AI
studies focus on machine learning, deep learning, and rein-
forcement learning in the fields including computer vision,
decision-making, and natural language process (NLP). Intu-
itively, the breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the real
world motivate people to realize metaverse. For example, ma-
chine learning provides technical support for all systems in
metaverse to reach or exceed the level of human’s learning.
It shall significantly affect the operational efficiency and the
intelligence of metaverse. Intelligent voice services provide

technical support, such as voice recognition and communica-
tion, for metaverse users.
A. REPRESENTATIVE AI ALGORITHMS
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression [36],
random forest [37], singular value decomposition [38]) en-
able machine to have the human ability by learning from
experience and data. For example, support vector machine
[Fig. 4(a)] [39] is a kind of representative machine learning
algorithm and is used for the problem of pattern classifica-
tion, regression, and learning a ranking function. The support
vector classification aims to find an optimization hyperplane
to separate the dataset by minimizing the following object
function:
L(ω) =
∑
i=1
max
(
0, 1 − yi
[
ωT xi + b︸ ︷︷ ︸
Loss function
] +λ‖ω‖2
2︸ ︷︷ ︸
regularization
, (1)
where ω denotes a weight vector, b denotes the threshold,
and λ denotes a Lagrangian factor that determines the trade-
off between margin maximization and regularization in the
loss function. However, machine learning algorithms usually
require to select features manually, which limits its wide ap-
plications since a large amount of labeled data is needed.
The convolutional neural networks (CNNs, or ConvNets
[Fig. 4(b)]) are a kind of representative deep neural network
inspired by the biological neural network. The normal CNNs
are based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution
kernels or filters that slide along input features and pro-
vide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps.
CNNs are always composed of convolution layers, pooling
layers and fully connected layers [40]. The great amount of
reduction in CNN is achieved by a technique called weight
sharing between neurons. Given an image X ∈ R
M×N and a
filter W ∈ R
m×n, where m << M, n << N , the convolution
can be written follows:
yi j =
m∑
u=1
n∑
v=1
ωuv · xi−u+1, j−v+1, (2)
where ω is the shared training parameters. Thus, CNNs are
regarded as a kind of prevalent supervised learning that could
perform well in many computer vision applications such
as facial recognition, image search, augmented reality, and
more.
While reinforcement learning describes the sequential
decision-making problem faced by an agent that must learn
experience through trial-and-error by interacting with a dy-
namic environment [41]. The schematic of RL is demon-
strated in Fig. 4(c). Considering the Markov decision pro-
cesses (MDPs) [42] and deep neural network, deep reinforce-
ment learning is promising to revolutionize the field of AI and
represent a step towards establishing an autonomous system
with a higher level of understanding of the visual world [43].
And there are two main approaches to solving RL problems:
value functions and policy search. Value function methods are
based on estimating the value (expected return) of being in a
given state. The optimal policy π∗, has a corresponding state-
value function V ∗(s), and vice versa; the optimal state-value
function can be defined as:
V ∗(s) = max
π
E[R|s, π ]. ∀s ∈ S, (3)
where, s denotes the state, and π denotes the policy that agent
follows. By contrast, policy search methods do not need to
maintain a value function model but directly search for an
optimal policy π∗. Until now, there have been developed many
deep learning-based RL (DRL) algorithms, including deep Q-
network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and
asynchronous advantage actor-critic. These DRL algorithms
can be applied to achieve over-human performance in some
fields [43]. In the next section, we review the works on AI
technologies that are related to the metaverse when it comes
to the establishment of a metaverse environment and object
creation in the metaverse.
B. ESTABLISHMENT OF METAVERSE ENVIRONMENT
Not only metaverse users, but the objects or things in the
physical world also interact with the metaverse, evolving to
persistently represent the structure, behaviors, and context
of a unique physical asset (such as a component, a human,
or a process) [44] in the virtual world (see Table I). With
the breakthroughs of digital transformation, the latest trend
in every industry is to build digital twins with the ultimate
126 VOLUME 3, 2022
TABLE 1. A Summary of the Application of AI in Metaverse
goal of using them throughout the whole asset life-cycle with
real-time data [45]. Digital twins are instrumental not only
during the conceptualization, prototyping, testing, and design
optimization phase but also during the operational phase.
The virtual world of metaverse generates a huge amount,
variety, and velocity of data, such as structured data, and
unstructured data, which makes deep learning-based digital
twin (DT) essential [46]. It can provide a better under-
standing of the underlying mechanics to all the stakeholders
by the fusion of the virtual world with data sciences [47].
Ham et al. [48] propose a new participatory-sensing-to-
digital twin city framework for community functioning in
cities. The work fuses crowdsourced and unstructured visual
data-based reality information with a three-dimensional (3D)
virtual city to update the 3D city model that is fed into a
computer-aided virtual environment (CAVE) for interacting
and immersive visualization. To address the challenge of pro-
cessing unstructured point clouds, epitomized by high cost,
movable objects, limited object classes, and high informa-
tion inadequacy/redundancy. Xue et al. [49] present a novel
unsupervised method, called Clustering Of Symmetric Cross-
sections of Objects (COSCO), to process urban LiDAR point
clouds to a hierarchy of objects based on their characteristic
cross-sections. COSCO follows the Gestalt design principles,
including proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and similarity.
Lai et al. [50] propose a novel virtual environment for
visual deep learning since the existing works have the
drawbacks, such as small scenes or limited interactions
with objects, which provides large-scale diversified indoor
and outdoor scenes. Augmented reality (AR) devices could
provide people with immersive and interactive experiences
while their applications are latency-sensitive. Hence, in the
work [51], Chen et al. exploit to address the computation
efficiency, low-latency objects recognition, and classification
issues of AR applications by integrating mobile edge
computing paradigm with federated learning. A city DT
system depends on long-term and high-quality data to
bring to perfection. Pang et al. [63] propose a federated
learning-based DT framework to enable multiple city DTs to
share the local strategy and status quickly while accumulating
the insights from multiple data sources efficiently, thereby
enhancing privacy protection settings.
Lee et al. [64] present a serious game for self-training
fire evacuation drills, in which the avatar is synchronized
with multiple trainees and can be placed in different remote
physical locations with the option of real-time supervision.
The proposed system architecture includes a wearable motion
sensor and a head-mounted display to synchronize each user’s
expected motion with her/his avatar activity in the cyberspace
of the metaverse environment. This system architecture
provides an immersive and inexpensive environment for the
easy-to-use user interface of a fire evacuation training system
based on network experience. The model [54] explicitly deals
with occluded body parts by hallucinating plausible solutions
of not visible joint. Fabbri et al. propose a new end-to-end
architecture that is a three-branch multi-stage CNN with four
branches (visible heat-maps, occluded heat-maps, part affinity
fields, and temporal affinity fields) fed by a time linker feature
extractor.
To overcome the lack of surveillance data with tracking,
body part, and occlusion annotations they created the vastest
computer graphics dataset for people tracking in urban sce-
narios by exploiting a photorealistic video game. During the
initial stage of the metaverse, it still requires technological
companies or governments to collaboratively establish the
AI-based infrastructure when it comes to the computational
capacities, data, technologies, etc. While scattered ownership
of data is another barrier since companies often don’t want
to share commercially sensitive information, nor do govern-
ments [65]. To address this issue, federated learning (FL)
has emerged as a kind of collaborative learning paradigm,
allowing participants to train the shared model locally by
transferring the training parameters instead of raw data. FL
paradigm can protect the data privacy and reduce the commu-
nication overhead [66], especially for the large-scale scenarios
with large models and massive data. With respect to the data
VOLUME 3, 2022 127
YANG ET AL.: FUSING BLOCKCHAIN AND AI WITH METAVERSE: A SURVEY
privacy, there have been many research on applying FL in
medical institutions [67], industries [65], banks [68], etc.
Mohammadi et al. [52] propose a semi-supervised deep re-
inforcement learning-based framework that utilizes a fusion of
labeled (users’ feedback) and unlabeled (without such users’
feedback) data to converge toward better control policies in-
stead of wasting the unlabeled data. The proposed framework
is scalable to satisfy the demands of smart city services. In-
tuitively, this research on semi-supervised deep reinforcement
learning-based can be mapped into the service of the meta-
verse. While the development of intelligent metaverse remains
the challenges, such as integrating big and fast/streaming data
analytics, big dataset shortage, and on-device intelligence.
C. OBJECT CREATION IN METAVERSE
After the descriptions of AI-based establishment of virtual
world, we shall argue the authoring tools in metaverse since
AI-based authoring tools provide technical support for all sys-
tems and roles to reach or exceed the level of human learning.
Authoring tools will greatly affect the operational efficiency
and intelligence of metaverse.
1) AVATAR AND NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
The notion avatar can be derived from the Sanskrit word. It
identifies the god Vishnu’s manifestations on earth. However,
it was the first to be used for player representations in virtual
worlds [69]. Avatars are not only used in games, but also as
users’ representations in e-commerce applications, virtual so-
cial environments, and in geographically separated workplace
meetings [70].
Chen et al. [57] propose a novel method for personal intel-
ligent behavior avatar to make the optimal strategic decision
for the user through the interactions between the user and
agents by integrating Bayesian Networks and reinforcement
learning in the virtual environment. To create a controllable
and responsive avatar with large motion sets in computer
games and virtual environments, Lee et al. [58] presents a
novel method of precomputing avatar behavior from unla-
beled motion data in order to animate and control avatars at
minimal runtime cost. Meanwhile, a reinforcement learning
method [59] is applied to train a virtual character to move
participants to a specified location. The virtual environment
demonstrates an alleyway displayed through a wide field-of-
view head-tracked stereo head-mounted display. This method
opens up the door for many such applications where the
virtual environment adapts to the responses of the human
participants with the aim of achieving particular goals. Apart
from the mentioned above, AI-driven non-player characters
(NPCs) are computer-operated characters who act as enemies,
partners, and support characters to provide challenges, offer
assistance, and support the storyline. While from the game
perspective, most of the human-looking NPCs are not intelli-
gent enough to interact with players in specific game genres
(e.g., real-time strategy, some modes of first-person shooting),
which requires strong tactical decision-making abilities. Wang
et al. [55] propose a reinforcement learning-based domination
team for playing unreal tournament (UT) domination games
that consists of a commander NPC and several solider NPCs.
During each decision cycle in the running process, the com-
mander NPC decides troop distribution and according to that
decision, sends action orders to other soldier NPCs. Each
soldier NPC tries to accomplish its task in a goal-directed way,
i.e., decomposing the final ultimate task (attacking or defend-
ing a domination point) into basic actions (such as running
and shooting) that are directly supported by UT application
programming interfaces (APIs). The RL agents as means of
creating NPCs that could both progressively evolve behavioral
patterns and adapt to the dynamic world by exploring their
environment and learning optimal behaviors from interesting
experiences [71], [72].
Berner et al. [56] develop a distributed training system and
tools for continual training which allows researchers to train
OpenAI Five for 10 months. By defeating the Dota 2 [73]
world champion (Team OG), OpenAI Five demonstrates that
self-play reinforcement learning can achieve superhuman per-
formance on a difficult task. Rahmatizadeh et al. [60] attempt
to address the challenging problem of behavior transfer from
virtual demonstration to a physical robot through training a
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network
to generate trajectories. During the training process, a Mixture
Density Network (MDN) is applied to calculate an error signal
suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The
learned controller in the virtual environment can be trans-
ferred to a physical robot (a Rethink Robotics Baxter) and
successfully perform the manipulation tasks on a physical
robot, which motivates the avatar to create AI objects that
can impact the physical world. Similarly, the works [61], [62]
exploit the interaction between the virtual environment and
physical world by CNNs.
2) AI-BASED ACTIVITIES IN METAVERSE
In games (e.g., [8], [4], [74]), the basic characteristics of
metaverse can be perfectly explained and displayed. However,
no game has fully achieved an ideal metaverse. Games con-
ventionally have rules, objectives, and boundaries that enable
them to shape a specific gameplay. In contrast, metaverse does
not require any specific gameplay. Some online social games
are very similar to metaverse, such as sims [74]. Metaverse,
however, differs from video games, because it involves many
activities that are not necessarily for fun. Examples are re-
viewed as follows.
� Metaverse users can attend events (concert, virtual ex-
hibition, remote education, meeting collaboration, etc.)
without having to travel.
� Metaverse is virtual and real symbiosis, which means it
can evolve in parallel even if people leave the virtual
world anytime.
Being aware of the difference between video games and
metaverse, we can exploit metaverse from the perspective of
video games, and extend it to the fields of manufacturing,
128 VOLUME 3, 2022
education, creation, entertainment, social, and so on. Ando et
al. [75] present a way how to infer the observed exhibits in
a metaverse museum from a movement log based on Second
Life. To use recommendation systems in metaverse museums,
they need some pieces of information to infer which exhibits
the user is visiting via performing this task efficiently and
precisely by focusing on the avatar’s states in the museum.
Yampolskiy et al. [53] propose a set of algorithms that
are capable of verification and recognition of avatar faces
with a high degree of accuracy. Lugrin et al. [76] propose
a method for the AI-based simulation of object behavior so
that interactive narrative can feature the physical environment
inhabited by the player character as an ‘actor’. The prototype
based on the top of the Unreal Tournament game engine relies
on a ‘causal engine,’ which essentially bypasses the native
Physics engine to generate alternative consequences to player
interventions. The evaluation method [77] can be applied to
the human-centered evaluation of AI-based games, grounded
in the analysis of player retellings of their play experiences
in Civilization VI, Stellaris, and two distinct versions of the
research game Prom Week. The reason is that it is difficult
to understand through existing evaluation methods, such as
the typical narrative structure that players tend to have in
their minds when playing a specific game. The diversity of
subjective experience narratives that might occur in a specific
game.
Puder et al. [78] demonstrate that an open distributed envi-
ronment can be viewed as a service market where services are
freely offered and requested. Any infrastructure which pur-
sues appropriate mechanisms for such an environment should
contain mediator functionality (i.e., a trader) that matches
service demands and service offers.
In the open and decentralized metaverse, DRL is expected
as a promising alternative for automated trading in the meta-
verse ecosystem since DRL can enable the well-trained agent
to make the decision automatically. Liu et al. [79], [80] believe
that proper usage of AI will initiate a paradigm shift from
the conventional trading routine to an automated machine
learning approach. Therefore, Liu et al. [79] propose a DRL-
based system to achieve efficiently automate trading in the
ecosystem, named FinRL, which can solve dynamic decision-
making problems and build a multi-factor model. In addition,
Liu et al. [80] attempt to reduce the simulation-to-reality gap
and data processing burden through an open-source library
that includes hundreds of market environments for financial
reinforcement learning.
IV. BLOCKCHAIN IN METAVERSE
Blockchain is widely believed as one of the fundamental
infrastructures of metaverse, because it can bridge isolated
small sectors together and provide a stable economic system,
which helps offer transparent, open, efficient, and reliable
rules for metaverse. For example, hash algorithms and times-
tamp technologies as the major components in the data layer
of blockchain could provide metaverse users the traceability
and confidentiality of the data storing in the bottom layer
FIGURE 5. Layered Architecture of Blockchain.
of blockchains. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the conventional
Blockchain architecture includes a data layer, network layer,
consensus layer, incentive layer, contract layer, and appli-
cation layer. The correlations between those layers and the
metaverse are explained as follows.
� Data transmission and verification mechanism provide
network support for various data transmission and veri-
fication of metaverse economic system.
� Consensus mechanisms solve the credit problem of
metaverse transactions.
� Distributed storage of blockchain ensures the security of
virtual assets and the identities of metaverse users.
� Smart contract technology offers a trustworthy environ-
ment for all participating entities in the metaverse. It
realizes the value exchange in the metaverse and ensures
the transparent execution of system rules described in
contract codes. Once deployed, the code of smart con-
tracts cannot be modified anymore. All clauses depicted
in those smart contracts must be completely executed.
Without the support of blockchain technology, it will be dif-
ficult to identify the value of the resources and goods trading
in the metaverse, especially when those virtual elements have
economic interactions with the real-world economy. Thus, it
is undoubtedly worth exploring the blockchain technology in
the metaverse.
In this section, we introduce the blockchain-empowered
applications in metaverse considering four perspectives, i.e.,
Cryptocurrency, Transaction characteristics, Authentication,
and Market & Business.
A. CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR METAVERSE
What is the functionality of cryptocurrency in the metaverse?
How to issue and apply cryptocurrency in the metaverse?
Faced with these questions, we discuss whether the conven-
tional cryptocurrency-issuing rule applies to metaverse in this
subsection.
Cryptocurrency is one of the main applications under the
spotlight empowered by blockchain. It also makes blockchain
VOLUME 3, 2022 129
YANG ET AL.: FUSING BLOCKCHAIN AND AI WITH METAVERSE: A SURVEY
more popular. The trust of a wide range of users supports
the value system of cryptocurrencies and drives both the cir-
culation and trading of cryptocurrencies. To date, more than
12,000 virtual currencies have been issued worldwide, and
new virtual currencies are still being created every single day.
The price of mainstream cryptocurrencies keeps hitting record
highs. At the time of the writing, the exchange rate of the US
dollar to Bitcoin hits 50000:1 (USD/BTC) recently.
Like the real world builds upon fiat currencies, the future
metaverse inevitably needs cryptocurrencies, which deliver
value during their circulation, payment, and currency of set-
tlement. In detail, blockchain systems have implemented a
series of operations for cryptocurrencies, such as creation,
recording, and trading. All these fundamental operations are
necessary for the metaverse (see Table II).
Traditionally, Bitcoin [81] adopts the UTXO (Unspent
Transaction Outputs) transaction model to trace the usages
of this cryptocurrency, while Ethereum [82] records the bal-
ance of each account address, which can be queried directly
through the Ethereum dataset tools (e.g. Etherscan). Both
UTXO and Ethereum adopt the Proof of Work (PoW) consen-
sus. Miners mint coins by generating new blocks. However,
there is a cost for them to generate blocks. In such PoW
consensus, miners mine blocks by calculating a hash puzzle,
which consumes a giant amount of electricity. For Ethereum
2.0, miners under the PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mecha-
nism mine blocks by electing, which depends on the coin age
of miners [83].
Using blockchain technologies, there are multiple ways
to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges. The vast majority
of cryptocurrency exchanges occur in centralized exchanges
such as OKEx and AOFEX. The advantages of the centralized
exchanges include low-latency transactions, simple interfaces
and a certain level of security. However, the centralized ex-
changes also experience scandals such as price manipulation
by insiders taking advantage of information asymmetries.
Other cryptocurrency exchanges occur in decentralized ex-
changes, where smart contracts or other peer-to-peer network
execute transactions automatically [84]. In some cases, the
smart contracts, e.g., IDex and Paradex, maintain continuous-
limited order books offchain, a counterparty of the order or the
exchange itself performs order matching and submits order
pairs to the smart contract for processing. In other cases,
such as Uniswap and Bancor, the smart contract performs
as a counterparty and trade with its user directly. It is easy
to foresee that metaverse built by different corporations will
coexist in the near future. Thus, various cryptocurrencies used
in those smaller metaverses need to be exchanged like fiat
currencies in the physical world. We envision that multiple
cryptocurrencies will also coexist in future metaverse. The
metaverse users will naturally need to exchange different
cryptocurrencies in the same way as described above.
B. TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS IN METAVERSE
Metaverse is expected to have various types of financial issues
such as estate purchases, item rentals and service acquisitions,
which include almost everything people do in the physical
world. Therefore, transactions in metaverse are not merely
related to intra-metaverse scenario, and not only for token
transferring.
Once a user launches a transaction on the conventional
blockchain, the transaction will be first broadcast to miners
and be stored in their local transaction pools. The miner picks
up a certain number of transactions and next performs the
hash-based consensus. The block generated by the first miner
to find an output to the puzzle that fits the specified difficulty
will be uploaded to the chain and broadcast to all the other
miners.
In metaverse, it is not hard to predict that those blockchain
nodes will process a giant volume of transactions since meta-
verse has a significant number of users, who trade in the
virtual world every second while using various intra- or inter-
metaverse applications. As conventional, the full blockchain
nodes working in metaverse need to store all the historical
transactions locally, which brings a great burden for the full
nodes.
Another issue associated to metaverse transactions is the
requirement of low confirmation latency. Internet applica-
tions that satisfy human habits often have end-to-end latency
between tens of milliseconds and hundreds of millisec-
onds. Even further, metaverse applications based on three-
dimensional display and interaction require an latency within
10 milliseconds in order to avoid dizziness. All those low-
latency applications enforce metaverse transactions to have
low-confirmation latency.
The existing blockchain consensus protocols have several
constraints that prevent them from being directly applied
to metaverse. For instance, the PoW mechanism relies on
miner’s hash power to achieve consensus on a certain trans-
action data. Considering the huge data volume of metaverse,
PoW consensus will consume a large amount of mining re-
sources. The PoS mechanism, on the other hand, relies on the
number and age of coins held by miner nodes for reaching
consensus towards a group of proposed transactions. Since
the Matthew effect is more pronounced on metaverse, the PoS
mechanism cannot ensure the fairness of the miners participat-
ing in the consensus in metaverse. Therefore, metaverse needs
new consensus protocols and new blockchain mechanisms to
meet the rigorous requirements of transactions.
We then review some state-of-the-art studies to find
some clues to address the transaction issues aforementioned.
In [85], the authors merge blockchain with IIoT architecture
and propose a hierarchical storage structure where histori-
cal information is stored on the cloud and the latest block
is stored on IIoT devices. The new architecture could offer
immutable and verifiable services. To reduce the cost of block
validation during forwarding, Frauenthaler et al. [86] propose
to validate the block header only when needed, making in-
teroperation between Ethereum-based blockchains feasible.
Yang et al. [87] change the traditional linear structure of
blockchains using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure
where blocks are organized into a compacted DAG structure.
130 VOLUME 3, 2022
TABLE 2. A Summary of the Blockchain Technologies in Metaverse
This new structure can improve security and decrease the
transaction verification time. Aumayr et al. [88] present a
virtual channel protocol based on UTXO that is compatible
with almost all cryptocurrencies, aiming to reduce the con-
firmation latency in the context of many transactions waiting
to be processed. To accelerate transaction relay in blockchain
networks, Zhang et al. [89] propose a Repulay protocol where
nodes select neighbors based on a reputation mechanism and
verify transactions only with a certain probability. Overall,
the proposed RepuLay also helps nodes save their bandwidth
while guaranteeing the quality of transaction relay.
C. BLOCKCHAIN-EMPOWERED MARKET IN METAVERSE
Blockchains before Ethereum, such as Bitcoin, only sup-
port token transferring. Until the emergence of the Ethereum
platform, smart contracts begin to support Turing-complete
programming. Complicated businesses could be executed in
a virtual machine through smart contract codes. Ethereum re-
alizes the upgrade of blockchain applications from cryptocur-
rency to crypto-business. Various blockchain reconfiguration
of market and business could be implemented.
Empowering by the advanced blockchain technologies, de-
centralized finance (DeFi) can boost the decentralized market
and business in the metaverse. We review several represen-
tative studies related to the DeFi market and business here.
In [84], the authors analyze the behavior of arbitrage bots in
the context of the cryptocurrency market. They find that arbi-
trage robots could observe the transactions in the transaction
pool and perform arbitrage without risks. They also present
a cooperative strategy to maximize the profit of arbitrage
robots and point out that miners could act as arbitrage robots
under certain circumstances. However, the MEV (miner ex-
tractable value) could incentivize the emergence of forking
attacks. The authors propose a cooperative bidding strategy
for them to strive for more profit. They also find that the
current amount of MEV in a month is more than 25× the cost
of a 51% attack on Ethereum. DeFi, based on smart contracts
and Fungible Tokens (FT), offers a new approach to innovate
economic models in the metaverse. Existing successful solu-
tions, such as Uniswap [90], a decentralized exchange (DEX)
implemented on Ethereum, automatically provide users with
liquidity for their tokens. DEXs is a new kind of marketplace
that can offer a secure peer-to-peer exchange of crypto-asset
tokens for trading [91]. The core of a DEX, named atomic
swap, enables two parties to exchange tokens or crypto-assets
without involving an intermediary party. Cybex [92] as a
DEXs-based DApp, provides a peer-to-peer marketplace for
tokens to be exchanged. Cybex also issues its token called
CYB. It is worth noting that CYB is only allowed to use
in the Cybex market when paying for the exchange of new
tokens, staking to borrow crypto-asset tokens, paying transac-
tion fees, etc. The Diem Blockchain [33] is the technological
backbone of the payment system, operated by a network of
validator nodes. The software that implements the blockchain
is open-sourced so that anyone can build upon it and scale
their financial needs.
D. BLOCKCHAIN-EMPOWERED AUTHENTICATION IN
METAVERSE
Currently, the economic activities in metaverse mainly include
the auction of virtual assets, including land, scarce items,
precious real estate, the development and leasing of land, the
rewards of game tasks, and the profits from investing in cryp-
tocurrency. Thus, metaverse invokes a new form of funding
that draws inspiration from both the real and virtual world.
NFT has been mainly used to commemorate special mo-
ments or to collect digital assets, and recently it is creating
a new digital content business by combining it with meta-
verse [93], [94]. NFT can guarantee the uniqueness of the
digital assets by keeping encrypted transaction history per-
manently on the blockchain. Each token has a unique recog-
nizable value, which enables to authenticate the ownership of
digital assets. For example, the blockchain-empowered NFT
has been applied to prove the uniqueness of the avatar and the
created things in metaverse [95].
V. INTEGRATION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND AI ON
METAVERSE
Yng: As aforementioned, we have discussed the details of
AI and blockchain, and their impacts on the metaverse. The
integration of AI and blockchain, namely blockchain intel-
ligence and intelligent blockchain, shall be explored due to
their close interactions. For example, the decentralized AI as
an integration of AI and blockchain [100] enables to process
and perform analytics or decision making on trusted data
without any support from trusted third parties. Hence, in this
section, we shall discuss their integration and seek to answer
the question: what contributions can intelligent systems make
in metaverse [101].
VOLUME 3, 2022 131
YANG ET AL.: FUSING BLOCKCHAIN AND AI WITH METAVERSE: A SURVEY
A. BLOCKCHAIN FOR AI
Blockchains can offer various components for AI, including
dataset, algorithms, and computing power through trading
from the decentralized marketplace. Blockchain encourages
the innovation and adoption of AI to an unprecedented level
in the context of metaverse. Several representative examples
are reviewed as follows. Mamoshina et al. [102] propose a
blockchain-based decentralized model that enables users to
access their personal data in an AI-moderated healthcare data
exchange. The proposed model allows users to upload their
data directly to the system and grants access to their data using
transparent pricing. Such transparent pricing is determined by
a data value model, guaranteeing fair tracking of all data usage
activities. Woods [103] analyzes the importance of fusing AI
techniques and blockchain infrastructure, aiming to address
the security risks faced by the Internet. The author finds that
bots-bots and human-bots interactions have increased since
52% of the web traffic is generated by bots. Thus, bot-bot
communications will exceed human-bot interactions accord-
ing to the increasing bot traffic. In metaverse, each person will
have multiple avatars. This fact inevitably leads to huge traffic
due to massive interactions.
B. AI FOR BLOCKCHAIN
To design a blockchain, developers have to tune massive
parameters and consider trade-offs between incentive, con-
sensus, security, and many other aspects. AI technologies can
be applied to deal with those problems and help blockchain
systems achieve higher performance. In addition, with the
breakthroughs of machine learning, a blockchain governed
by a machine learning-based algorithm might enable auto-
matically detection of attacks and invoke appropriate defense
mechanisms. For example, Salimitari et al. [104] propose a
machine learning-based framework, which aims to offer a se-
cure and robust consensus in blockchain-based IoT networks.
The authors then present a two-stage consensus protocol for
the AI-enabled blockchain that exploits an outlier detection
algorithm in an IoT network.
VI. CHALLENGES AND OPEN ISSUES
Through the previous review, we found that AI and blockchain
are fundamental technologies for the metaverse. Although
those technologies are promising to build a scalable, reliable,
and efficient metaverse, we are aware that the metaverse is
still in its infant stage. Thus, this section discusses the chal-
lenges, open issues, and suggestions for the fusion of AI and
blockchain in the metaverse.
A. OPEN ISSUES ON DIGITAL ECONOMY IN METAVERSE
Different from the physical world, the digital creation in
the virtual world might be unlimited. The identity of digital
objects determines value instead of the undifferentiated labor
in the conventional economy. In the field of digital creation,
it is necessary to develop authoring tools to enable the users
to produce original content easily and gain rewards efficiently
at a low cost. Those tools could improve the enthusiasm of
content producers of the metaverse. The marginal benefits
will increase in the metaverse instead of diminishing marginal
benefits of production in the physical world. The difference in
marginal benefits between the physical world and the virtual
world demands a value conversion mechanism to bridge their
gap.
In future metaverse, people prefer to turn to their virtual
cabinet to select a digital outfit, while companies begin to
hype the virtual skins, virtual clothing, and even virtual estates
with a high price which will block a large portion of players
to join in the metaverse. Hence, it is necessary to propose
particular governance mechanisms under the cooperation of
worldwide companies. Furthermore, how to establish a digital
currency system that enables the currency exchange between
the metaverse and the physical world remains an open issue.
In addition, the transaction volume and frequency that oc-
curred in the metaverse will become extremely much higher
than happened in the physical world. Thus, how to support
such high-volume and high-frequency transactions remains a
challenging problem in the future metaverse. Another issue
related to future metaverse might be the inflation caused by
massive cryptocurrency supplements in a decentralized econ-
omy system built upon blockchain and AI technologies.
B. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ISSUES
The breakthroughs of artificial intelligence technologies, es-
pecially deep learning, enable academia and industries to
make great progress in the automatic operation and design
in the metaverse and perform better than conventional ap-
proaches. For example, the study [8] applies AI to generate
vivid digital characters quickly that might be deployed by
virtual service providers as conversational virtual assistants to
populate the metaverse. However, existing deep learning mod-
els are usually very deep and have a massive amount of pa-
rameters, which incurs a high burden for resource-constrained
mobile devices to deploy learning-based applications. While
current AI technologies are just at the stage where people tell
the machine to do specific tasks instead of enabling the ma-
chine to learn to learn automatically. Most learning tasks are
only suitable for the closed static environment and have poor
robustness, and poor interpretability that can not satisfy the
requirement of availability, robustness, interpretability, and
adaptability in an open and dynamic environment.
Meta-learning [105] is a promising learning paradigm that
can observe how different machine learning approaches per-
form on a wide range of learning tasks. Learning from
this experience, meta-data can learn new tasks much faster
than others possible. Not only does meta-learning dramati-
cally speed up and improve the design of machine learning
pipelines or neural architectures, it also allows us to replace
hand-engineered algorithms with novel approaches learned in
a data-driven way. Therefore, meta-learning remains challeng-
ing to achieve auto-machine learning in future years.
132 VOLUME 3, 2022
C. BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED ISSUES
Although blockchain technologies have achieved a lot of im-
provements, there are still challenges and open issues while
fusing blockchain in metaverse. We post several questions in
the following to inspire readers to deeply dive into the related
technical studies.
� Can the existing real-world NFT platforms adapt to
the high transaction volumes in the metaverse? NFTs
are unique cryptographic tokens that deployed on
blockchains. Assigning non-reproducible features, NFTs
digitalize real-world items like artworks and real estate.
However, the current NFT platforms are in their initial
stage. To meet the high-volume requirement of future
metaverse’s applications, to improve the service level of
NFT platforms is an essential research and engineering
topic.
� What rules does metaverse require towards a healthy dig-
ital blockchain-empowered market and business? From
the perspective of policy, the combination of decentral-
ization and regulation might be a promising way for
the digital blockchain-empowered market. DAO [106]
is regarded as an efficient, decentralized, and promising
paradigm that works with like-minded folks around the
globe. The members in DAO have built-in treasuries that
no one has the authority to access without the approval of
the group. DAOs are executed through smart contracts,
which are transparent codes verifiable by anyone. Thus,
exploiting DAOs, decisions can be governed by propos-
als and voting, to ensure everyone in the metaverse has a
countable voice.
� Is the real-world blockchain-empowered application
model able to be directly transplanted to metaverse?
Nowadays, the overwhelming speculations over thou-
sands of cryptocurrencies and the scams of initial coin
offering (ICO) have brought notorious doubts on meta-
verse. Moreover, the existing blockchain-empowered ap-
plication models cannot meet the stringent requirements
of metaverse with it low latency and high through-
put performance. Hence, a high-performance and secure
blockchain-empowered application model is needed for
the various applications used in future metaverse.
� Does metaverse need new blockchain platforms and
new consensus mechanisms? The foundation of the
blockchain is consensus mechanism, such as PoW and
PoS. However, the existing consensus mechanisms have
shortcomings with regard to large amount of hash
computing and various security issues. The future de-
centralized applications demand a blockchain platform
to fulfill the following desired characteristics, i.e., low
latency, high throughput, fast transaction-sequential per-
formance, offline payment of transactions, low trans-
action fee, modern free internet business model, etc.
Hence, new blockchain platforms and new consen-
sus mechanisms are expected to appear for future
metaverse.
D. GOVERNANCE IN METAVERSE
Currently, the concept of the metaverse is mainly used and
propagated by companies such as Roblox and Meta (Face-
book previously). Predictably, the most popular ecosystems
soon are built and operated by these giant corporations. Tiny
metaverse has only a few application scenarios. In contrast,
the macro metaverse would include all scenarios required
by users. To realize such a vision, large companies need to
cooperate to create a huge unified metaverse. The problem is
how to incentivize those giant companies to cooperate? Once
the unified metaverse is set up, how do make uniform rules
that govern the whole unified metaverse?
On the other hand, the threats of market manipulation and
money laundering will exist in the future metaverse. Thus, the
market governance will be viewed as more significant from
the perspective of regional jurisdiction of the metaverse.
E. BLOCKCHAIN-EMPOWERED APPLICATIONS FOR
METAVERSE
Various applications will boost the virtual economy in the
metaverse, such as blockchain-empowered Apps for office
work, social networks, NFT markets, game finance, etc. For
instance, the blockchain-based game Axie Infinity [107] es-
tablishes a digital pet universe in which players can battle,
raise, and trade fantasy creatures called Axies. The game
allows players to deposit from an Ethereum wallet to a Ronin
wallet via the Ronin Bridge. In short, the game allows the
currency exchange between fiat and cryptocurrency since the
players can buy ETH on a cryptocurrency exchange like
Binance or Coinbase or with fiat on Ronin, and send it to
their address due to the legality of cryptocurrency in some
countries. Although this blockchain-empowered game finance
does not work in some countries, we believe that the future
metaverse will embrace a much more open, fair, and rational
physical world.
F. SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOR METAVERSE
From the perspective of metaverse companies, developers, and
metaverse users alike, a natural question is how to guarantee
their security & privacy in metaverse which could mean vio-
lation of their privacy, potential identity theft, and other types
of fraud [108].
For example, a lot of private properties in the metaverse,
including the digital assets, the identity of virtual items, cryp-
tocurrency spending records, and other private user data, are
required to be protected. Thus, metaverse-oriented cryptogra-
phy mechanisms are open proposals for privacy preservation
in the metaverse.
VII. CONCLUSION
Artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies are ex-
pected to play essential roles in the ever-expanding meta-
verse. For example, metaverse uses artificial intelligence and
blockchain to create a digital virtual world where anyone can
safely and freely engage in social and economic activities that

YANG ET AL.: FUSING BLOCKCHAIN AND AI WITH METAVERSE: A SURVEY
transcend the limits of the real world. Exploiting metaverse,
the application of these latest AI and blockchain technologies
will be accelerated as well.
By surveying the most related works across metaverse com-
ponents, digital currencies, AI technologies and applications
in the virtual world, and blockchain-empowered technologies,
we wish to offer a thoughtful review to the experts from
both academia and industries. We also envisioned critical
challenges and open issues in constructing the fundamental
elements of metaverse with the fusion of AI and blockchain.
Further exploitation and interdisciplinary research on the
metaverse entail collaboration from both academia and indus-
tries to strive for an open, fair and rational future metaverse.
