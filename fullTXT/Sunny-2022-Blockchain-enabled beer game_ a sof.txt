1.Introduction
Blockchain is gaining the attention of media, businesses, public sector agencies and various
international organizations as a technology that generates trust and confidence in
untrustworthy environments (Raja Santhi and Muthuswamy, 2022; Sultan et al., 2018). In a
simple form, blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where transactions are recorded
permanently and immutably with timestamps. Blockchain has numerous other definitions,
crafted from different perspectives (Wamba et al., 2020). The unceasing possibilities of
blockchain in different application areas pinpoint the fact that this technology will surely be
more disruptive than the Internet in due course of time.
Supply chain management is an important area with tremendous scope for blockchain
technology (Dujak and Sajter, 2019). The ability to impart trust and transparency among the
entities makes the technology feasible for operations in all sorts of supply chains

(Batwa and Norrman, 2021; Singh and Sharma, 2022). While blockchain replaces third-party
intermediarieswith its decentralized and distributed architecture, supply chains can significantly
reduce its cost of operations. As a secure digital ledger, blockchain records every transaction in a
network with timestamps and combines them chronologically with the principles of
Cryptography. With this, supply chain entities taking part in the network can instantly track
and trace the products and services (Sunny et al., 2020). Customers can access authentic product
information when they purchase blockchain-based traceable products. Core implications of
blockchain technology in the context of operations and supply chain management includes
enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management; reducing illegal
counterfeiting; improving sustainable supply chain management; advancing inventory
management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new product
design and development; and reducing the cost of supply chain transaction (Babich and Hilary,
2020; Cole et al., 2019; Lohmer and Lasch, 2020). Even though blockchain is a candidate offering
these attractive benefits, organizations remain hesitant to utilize it for several reasons. Lack of
understanding is the paramount important factor that pulls down the adoption rate of the
blockchain (Kamble et al., 2019). The common publicmust get an advanced level of knowledge on
blockchain to leverage the industrial applications to decentralize their software systems and
transactions across the web and, thus, establish improved cyber-security to the evolving cyber-
infrastructure (Mittal et al., 2021).
Admittedly, blockchain is a blend of multidisciplinary fields like software engineering,
distributed computing, cryptography and game theory (Sultan et al., 2018). Due to this, it will be
tough to thoroughly understand the underlying concepts and inner workings of blockchain
technology, especially for entities with a non-technical background. There are three major
dimensions for familiarizing blockchain technology (Dettling, 2018; Dettling and Schneider,
2020). The first dimension covers the basic building blocks of blockchain and its underlying
mechanism. The seconddimension includes the relevance of blockchain, and the last dimension
deals with the applications of blockchain. Remarkably, many online and offline tools are
available for addressing the first and second dimensions. On the other side, software tools
capable of conveying the practical applications of blockchain are not widely available,
especially in the sphere of supply chain management. Prolific approaches are yet to evolve not
only for exploring the impact of blockchain but also to experience the potential application
areas of blockchain, including supply chain management (Strang et al., 2020). Addressing this
gap, this paper introduces, conceptualizes and demonstrates a software tool called “Blockchain-
Enabled Beer Game” (BEBG) for familiarizing the application of blockchain in supply chain
inventory management. Blockchain has immense relevance in the sphere of inventory
management. With the help of smart contracts, blockchain can instantly record the data on the
origins of materials, purchase orders, inventory levels, goods received, shipping manifests and
invoices in a tamper-proof manner (Cole et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2021).
The main contribution of this work is represented by the design and development of a
software tool for familiarizing blockchain technology. The proposed software tool is a
role-play simulation game. The current work uses the design-based research methodology to
develop the same (Hevner et al., 2004). The theme of the traditional beer distribution game has
chosen to establish a blockchain-enabled scenario for inventory management (Roser et al.,
2021). A decentralized application (DApp) was prototyped on the Ethereum blockchain to
demonstrate the tool (Cai et al., 2018). Since BEBG is developed in the form of a DApp, it can
provide the opportunity to interact with a live blockchain directly. In this sense, a live
blockchain is part of the theme or storyline of the game. This feature of BEBG makes it
different from all the existing tools for learning blockchain technology.
BEBG is effective in familiarizing the application of blockchain in inventorymanagement.
While playing BEBG, participants witness how each inventory-related transaction gets
secured.With BEBG, players can understand how blockchain enables transparency, security

and trust in a supply chain scenario, if they are aware of the first two dimensions for
familiarizing blockchain technology. Academic institutions, especially business schools, can
use this tool to teach the students the practical use of blockchain technology. Industries can
adopt BEBG for training the employees to make them aware of the scope of blockchain in
their inventory distribution management. The research community can devise BEBG to infer
the impact of blockchain in supply chain management.
The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related
works reported in the literature. Themethodology followed in thiswork is explained in Section 3.
Section 4 introduces BEBG by explaining the conceptual framework. Section 5 narrates the
design and development of BEBG. The scope, effectiveness and implications of BEBG are
discussed in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper with some directions for future work.
2. Literature review
2.1 Gaming as an approach for familiarizing blockchain technology
While reviewing subsequent and more recent literature, it is evident that the approach of
gaming is already adopted for learning blockchain technology. A set of offline/online tools are
currently available to use.
The recently developed board game called “BlockTrain” facilitates the opportunity to
learn the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology (Cortiz et al., 2021). The game
design considers a specific scenario of information manipulation and divergent data to
contextualize and create an atmosphere for the players. The authors have used data analysis
and descriptive statistics to evaluate the proposed game. Mittal et al. (2021) have developed a
game called Cybersecurity Enhancement through Blockchain Training (CEBT) for students
and professionals to tackle the impediments in taking up blockchain technology. CEBT is a
web-based serious game. This game ultimately targets imparting a basic awareness about
how a blockchain works, how blocks get added to the blockchain and other concepts
pertaining to the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Notably, the design of this game
proposes an AI technique for adapting the gameplay with intelligent game objects via
utilizing the player’s responses. Targeting the students of elementary schools, Choi et al.
(2021) introduced a card-based game for teaching the principles of blockchain. The authors
evaluated the learners’ understanding of blockchain before and after using the proposed
game and found that the method effectively teaches blockchain.
Understanding of the basics of blockchain and its mechanism is a prerequisite for
learning the relevance and application of blockchain. Stating this fact, Dettling and
Schneider (2020) developed Bloxxgame to teach the concepts like hashing, signatures,
consensus algorithm, etc. Abney et al. (2020) presented a paper-based simulation game
called blockchain paper game (BPG) to explain the concept of distributed ledger and smart
contract. Pedagogy using BPG allows for class discussions on information dissemination,
transparency, timeliness, accessibility and security. Similarly, Udokwu et al. (2022)
introduced a blockchain-based survival game to facilitate blockchain education. This
game can explain blockchain properties such as digital identity, consensus management,
immutable recordings and digitization of assets.
Christianson (2019) developed a paper-based hands-on exercise that could be used with
any group of students as a teaching aid to convey the concepts related to blockchain
technology. The exercise is open to the public, and materials are available on the web. As the
major limitations, this manual simulation takes too much time, and it is impossible to deal
with complex business scenarios.Weng et al. (2019) combined the role-play approachwith 3D
animations to simulate a classroom environment. Learners will get puzzle sets packed with
questions on blockchain technology. Upon answering the questions, participants can get into
newer game levels. The game ultimately guides the participants through the fundamentals of
Blockchain-

1027
blockchain. Oktian et al. (2019) has presented the conceptual framework of a serious game
called “Blockchain Mining” to convey the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm used in
Bitcoin blockchain. This game brings the blockchain newcomers the importance of mining
and insights on how the consensus works.
Blockchain-SimGame exemplified the application of simulation in introducing novel
concepts in Information Systems (Au et al., 2018). Blockchain-SimGame presents different
scenarios and real-life applications of blockchain. With the graphical interface of this
simulation game, players can understand the basics of blockchain. Developers of Blockchain-
SimGame have done a questionnaire-based evaluation for assessing its effectiveness. The
Java application called ChainTutor allows the learners to experiment with the important
concepts of the blockchain (Liu, 2018). The application has a dedicated graphical user
interface capable of simulating low-level details of blockchain, such as the generation of keys,
hashes, transactions, blocks, wallets, etc.
Blockchain Simulation is a business-oriented blockchain awareness program
conducted by a group of technology, design and simulation experts Blockchain
Simulation (2018). The highlight of this program is a paper-based manual simulation. It
is mainly developed for non-technical people like advocates, carrier owners, retailers, etc.,
to understand blockchain applications in a business environment. Participants can play
the part of companies and experience the benefits of a blockchain for improving their
decision-making capabilities.
Interestingly, most of the tools mentioned above are developed to provide the users with
an understanding of the blockchain fundamentals. Dettling and Schneider (2020) suggested
that this is just about the first and second levels of learning blockchain. Users need to get
aware of the applications of blockchain to familiarize themselves with the technology
entirely. However, the tools explained above are not feasible for this. Notably, the tools
reported in the literature are mainly based on metaphors or contradicting environments,
which cannot provide the feeling of being in a real blockchain scenario. A significant
percentage of the available tools are to be used in offline mode. Set-up times for such tools are
considerably high compared to those working in online mode.
This work aims to develop a software tool for students, employees and researchers to get
insights on applications of blockchain in inventory management, one of the core components
of supply chain management. As a unique feature, a real running blockchain is part of the
theme of the proposed BEBG.
3. Methodology
This work follows design-based research, a widely adopted research methodology in
education. Design-based research targets a particular problem to develop a suitable solution
and evaluate the same to know how well it works. The solution may undergo multiple
iterations of testing before it gets finalized. Figure 1 depicts the methodology adopted in
this work.
3.1 Problem identification and proposed solution
As reflected in Section 2, game-based tools are already available for learning blockchain
technology, but the majority deals with the fundamental concepts of blockchain. Of course,
without knowing the fundamentals, no one can further explore any technologies. As far as
blockchain technology is concerned, people should understand the fundamentals, impacts
and applications to widen its utility further. In the absence of initiatives and efforts to
facilitate a more profound understanding of potential applications, blockchain will remain a
mysterious technology without any practical use-cases. This work proposes a role-play
simulation game as a solution for the comprehension of blockchain technology, mainly to
familiarize with blockchain applications.

Thiswork considers the opportunities of blockchain technology in supply chainmanagement
and addresses the issues with the unavailability of appropriate tools for exploring the same.
Given this, the authors designed and developed a software tool to explore the scope of
blockchain in inventory management.
3.2 Objectives of the solution
The ultimate objective of the proposed software tool is to provide experiential learning on the
application of blockchain in inventorymanagement.While interactingwith the tool, the users need
to feel like being in a real blockchain-enabled environment. Remarkably, the purpose of the
proposed solution is to familiarize the application of blockchain rather than to convey the
fundamentals of blockchain as the majority of the existing tools do. In this sense, a basic
understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain is a prerequisite for using the proposed solution.
3.3 Design and development
Regarding the design, the proposed role-play simulation game partially adopts the theme of
the world-famous “Beer Distribution Game” as the foundation. Beer game mimics the
production-distribution system of a four-stage serial supply chain. The following points
justify the game design based on the theme of the beer game (Cortiz et al., 2021).
(1) The theme of the beer game explicitly exhibits a set of problems that blockchain can
address. These include lack of transparency, lack of coordination among the entities,
lack of data validation, etc.
(2) All the players of the beer game need to trigger a transaction in the form of order
quantity to the immediate upstream member. In this sense, all the players will get an
opportunity to take up the role of a node in a blockchain network.
(3) The serial structure of the supply chain enables the users to understand the concepts
with ease.
Remarkably, this paper does not focus on developing an adaptation of beer
distribution game; instead, the game-based tool presented in this work uses the
theme of the beer game, particularly for familiarizing the application of blockchain in
Figure 1.

supply chain inventory management. The tool is designed in the form of a DApp,
and with this, users get an opportunity to interact with a supply chain scenario
integrated with live blockchain. Thus, users can acquire a feeling of being in a real
blockchain-enabled environment. The development of a decentralized application
has three critical phases: analysis, design and implementation (Karamitsos et al., 2018).
Section 4 introduces BEBG, and its entire development process is explained in
Section 5.
3.4 Demonstration and evaluation
Authors have demonstrated the developed software tool to a small group of undergraduate
and post-graduate students of the industrial engineering stream and faculty members from
different disciplines. A SWOT analysis was performed with them to investigate the
effectiveness of BEBG. In addition to this, informal feedback was collected from the students
to get deeper insights into their outlooks. Section 5 also provides the demonstration of
the DApp.
3.5 Communication
Communication in design-based research is basically for exposing the research and its
findings to the external world. The feedback from the externals can be considered for
reforming the solution until it delivers the intended purposes. As given in Dettling and
Schneider (2020), with this paper, authors expect an increase in the attention of the external
researchers and academicians towards the proposed solution.
4. Introduction to blockchain-enabled beer game
This section elaborates on the general overview of the proposed blockchain-enabled beer
game, its design and implementation details. To demonstrate the concept, a DApp was
prototyped on the Ethereum blockchain.
4.1 General overview
As in the traditional beer game, BEBG also mimics the operations in a four-stage
serial supply chain with roles: retailer, wholesaler, distributor and factory. The core
feature that makes BEBG different from the traditional beer game is the presence
of a decentralized and distributed ledger. This ledger will permanently and
immutably record all the inventory-related information transactions of the supply
chain. The information from a particular stage in a specific period includes details
of inventory level, demand from the downstream member, order placed to the
upstream member, backorder details, etc. The entire logic of the game can be
programmed as smart contracts. In BEBG, all the players are part of a P2P network,
and they are assumed to be supply chain actors who perform trade-related activities
over a web interface. Here, the blockchain ledger is part of the game’s setting,
i.e. players interact with a virtual supply chain in a blockchain environment.
Transparency is one of the core characteristics of blockchain, and BEBG allows the
participants to experience this via the theme of beer game. Players can always make
suitable order decisions by referring to the inventory-related information added by
other entities in the blockchain ledger. The conceptual framework of the BEBG is
presented in Figure 2.
While accessing the inventory-related information from the blockchain ledger,
players can see details like block number in which the transaction got recorded, current
block hash, previous block hash, transaction hash, address of the sender and recipient,
IMDS
122,4
1030
timestamp, etc. Access to these details helps the players of BEBG to witness how
transactions get recorded in a real blockchain environment. While interacting with
BEBG, those who have a basic awareness of the fundamental concepts of blockchain can
easily comprehend the way blockchain works and the way blockchain keeps the data
secured. While multiple teams use BEBG in the same session, it can create a competitive
atmosphere. In this sense, BEBG holds the features of a fun game and that of a
serious game.
In general, six dimensions characterize a game: fantasy, goal, sensory stimuli,
challenge, mystery and control (Garris et al., 2002). BEBG allows a player to take up the
role of a supply chain actor and thereby creates an opportunity to govern their
organization in a simulated environment. The theme and characters of the beer game
make a fantasy in BEBG. To maintain the element of challenge within BEBG, teams
representing supply chains can compete to achieve the goal of the game. Competition
among the teams enables challenge. BEBG holds well-defined rules and goals. Mystery in
a game is enhanced by the dichotomy of information, complexity, novelty, surprise and
violation of expectations. Uncertainty/dynamic variation in the customer demand creates
a mysterious ambience in BEBG as in the beer game. Sensory stimulus is an essential
characteristic of games that grabs players’ attention. The user interface (UI) of BEBG
provides some sensory stimuli to the users. Control refers to the exercise of authority or
the ability to regulate, direct or command something. In BEBG, the smart contract that
executes the game logic controls the game from the beginning until the end with an
instructor’s support and assistance.
4.2 Game design
Theme, players, objectives, rules, resources and resource management, game state,
information, sequencing and player interaction are the vital components of a game. While
designing a game, these components are to be carefully framed. The components of BEBGare
explained below.
4.2.1 Theme. Inventory management in a blockchain-enabled supply chain is the theme of
this role-play simulation game.
4.2.2 Players. As in the traditional version of the beer game, here also the game can be
played between teams representing different supply chains. A retailer, wholesaler,
distributor and factory constitute a supply chain. Each of these players is part of a P2P
network.
4.2.3Objectives.Themain goal in this game is tominimize the total supply chain inventory
cost by making optimal order decisions. Players have to run their supply chain
collaboratively by using the information they can access from the blockchain ledger.
While playing BEBG, players can explore the scope of blockchain in inventory management
as a means for secure and transparent information sharing.
4.2.4 Rules. Two or more teams can play this game, either one after another using a single
private blockchain network or simultaneously using different networks with the same
configuration. The game can be set up for a predefined period. Each team has to run its
supply chain during this period by maintaining the total supply chain inventory cost as
minimumas possible. The period is inweeks. The gamewill start once the retailer receives the
first order from the customer in week one. If enough stock is available, demand will get
automatically fulfilled from each stage to their customers. Unmet demand becomes
backorder, i.e., each stage has to immediately deliver this quantity to their customers once the
stock is replenished. Each role can submit its orders to the immediate upstreammembers (for
example, retailer to wholesaler, wholesaler to distributor and, finally, distributor to factory).
Therewill be an associated inventory holding cost for every unit of beer holding at each stage.

Again, for each backorder, there will be an associated backorder cost. Total supply chain cost
will be the sum of inventory holding and backorder costs. The order lead time (olt) is set as
zero by default because blockchain ensures real-time information sharing. It is assumed that
the supply chain will start its operations only in the first week, and players place their orders
periodically every weekend.
Upstream member will start processing this order at the beginning of the following week.
In short, the order placed by a stage at the end of the week (wNo) reaches its supplier at the
beginning of the week (wNoþ1). Once the order is processed, the shipment will be ready for
delivery. Delivery lead time (dlt) is set as one by default. Therefore, the shipment made by the
supplier on (wNoþ1) reaches its customer at the beginning of the week (wNoþ2). It is
assumed that the factory has a production facility to produce unlimited units of beer;
consequently, the production quantity against the production order issued by the factory at
the end of a week (wNo) is available with the factory for distribution at the beginning of
(wNoþ2). Once the predefined period is over, the game will project the team’s performance
details.
4.2.5 Resources and resource management. A distributed digital ledger containing all the
details of transactions in the supply chains is the core resource in the game. Each player can
access it tomake suitable order decisions. Details from each stage of the supply chain, such as
demand received, orders placed, pipeline inventory, backorder, total inventory, etc. are
accessible from the ledger.
4.2.6 Game state. Each week, from each stage of the supply chain, the system
captures the details about demand received, orders placed, pipeline inventory,
backorder, total inventory, etc. The new game state will be periodically appended into
the ledger.
4.2.7 Information. In the proposed game, the player from a team can access the game state
of other co-players via the blockchain ledger. Optionally, information about the demand
distribution can be shared with the players.
4.2.8 Sequencing.Everyweek, irrespective of any particular order (sequence), every role in
a supply chain can place their order depending on the demand they receive. Once all the
players place the order, the week gets updated.
4.2.9 Player interaction. With the blockchain ledger, each player can access the
game states of their team members. Player interaction is vital in this game, as the
game’s success relies on the team members’ collaborative efforts. The irrational
ordering behaviour of even a single player can pull down the performance of a
supply chain.
5. Development and demonstration of blockchain-enabled beer game
This section covers the development and demonstration of the conceptualized BEBG.
For demonstration, a prototype of the conceptualized beer game has been developed in
the form of a DApp.
5.1 Development phases
The development of a blockchain application has three important phases: the analysis phase,
the design phase and the implementation phase. A brief description of these phases is
presented in Table 1. In this work, a permissioned private Ethereum blockchain was
preferred to develop the DApp.
5.1.1 Analysis phase. The analysis phase primarily deals with identifying entities or roles
that need to be incorporated in the DApp and their responsibilities. As in the traditional beer
game, the BEBG requires four players representing retailer, wholesaler, distributor and
Blockchain-
enabled beer
game
1033
factory. In addition, an admin is needed to set up the game by deploying the smart contract.
The instructor assigned to assist the players can take up the role of the admin. These five
entities are considered as externally owned accounts, i.e. they canmake transactions by using
their private keys.
All these five entities can read and write data into the blockchain. Except for admin,
other entities have additional permission for validation, i.e. the permission to check
the validity of the transactions and blocks against a set of rules defined by the
developers of the blockchain network and keep them secure using a hash. This
validation process is equivalent to “mining” in public blockchains (Wang et al., 2019).
The summary of the permissions given to the entities is shown in Table 2. A reputation-
based consensus called Proof of Authority (PoA) has opted in this work. PoA
consensus protocols are used when participants are known to each other. PoA is simple
in its logic and requires fewer resources than other popular consensus algorithms like
PoW or PoS (De Angelis et al., 2018). It was proposed as part of the Ethereum
ecosystem for private networks and implemented into Aura and Clique clients. Clique
is the PoA algorithm implemented in Geth (Go-Ethereum) (Explanation on Geth is
available in Section 5.1.3). PoA algorithm deals with two types of nodes: validators or
authorities and clients. Validators propose, validate and add blocks, whereas clients
issue transactions. Clique can operate with a single validator. But, it is to be noted that
operating with a single validator offers no redundancy if the validator fails. Since this
work is all about the conceptualization and demonstration of the proposed game, we
selected Clique for the ease of development.
5.1.2 Design phase. After identifying the required roles and responsibilities for the DApp,
the smart contract structure is to be framed. A smart contract hasmany vital components like
functions, events, state variables, etc. Once the structure is prepared, the smart contract can
be coded in a suitable language.
5.1.2.1 Sequence diagrams. A sequence diagram depicts the interactions between
objects within an application in sequential order. The sequence diagram presented in
Figure 3a considers the interaction of two players, i.e. a buyer and supplier, in a
particular period. The first interaction of any player is with the DApp for validating
the role. Hence, the function validatePlayer() is called. This function checks with the
system for proper authentication using the public address. Each player holds a unique
Ethereum address. Players get into the network using this address and invoke
different functions in the smart contract. Once the authentication is done, players can
get access to the DApp. Through the front-end of the DApp, players can place their
orders as transactions. The OrderItems() function written in the contract gets
executed, and the amount of items ordered is stored in the blockchain with a
transaction hash. If the transaction succeeds, a notification is sent to the buyer, saying
that the order has been successfully placed. This transaction makes changes in the
state of the smart contract. As a result, the seller receives this order as their demand,
and shipment is sent to the buyer. Figure 3b shows another sequence diagram
considering the whole supply chain. It shows the flow of actions of all the supply chain
members in one week. Note that this diagram is prepared with an assumption that the
authentication of supply chain members is already over. Players can order at any time
without considering whether another member has ordered or not. As already
mentioned, it is assumed that the factory receives products from its production
facility having infinite capacity.
5.1.2.2 Framework for smart contract. This section mainly covers the algorithms that
define the working of BEBG. The smart contract consists of three major functions
which are order(), checkWeekEnd() and updateDetails(). The constructor initializes
the players’ details and sets the details like order lead time, delivery lead time,

maxWeeks, startWeek, endWeek, holdingCost, backOrderCost, inventory orderState,
customerDemand and inventory details for the first week. maxWeeks indicates the
maximum weeks to play the game. startWeek and endWeek together define the
performance evaluation period of the supply chain. holdingCost and backOrderCost
represent inventory holding cost and backorder cost (per unit per week), respectively,
and they are arrays containing four values. customerDemand is the demand
received by the retailer. orderState is a Boolean array that keeps value 1 for a
particular player if they made the order for a particular week, else the value is 0. The
role of this array is to check whether everyone has ordered for that week. Another
array named inventory stores the end inventory details for all the players. In the
beginning, at week 0, the factory, distributor, wholesaler and retailer have certain
initial inventory with them. From Week 1 onwards, the retailer gets the customer
demand. An array of structures called Details is defined for each player to capture the
trade-related details of every week. Details array contains the state variables presented
in Table 3.
Another structure, Player, includes three state variables role, upstream and
downstream. The purpose of this structure is to assign roles for the players. Mapping in
Solidity is a reference type similar to arrays. It is equivalent to a dictionary or a map in
other programming languages. The smart contract for BEBG contains three mappings:
players, weekDetails and adds. The structure named players maps the public address of
the players to their role. weekDetails maps players’ public addresses to the array of
structures named Details. It keeps track of each player’s details every week of the
game. adds maps the roles of the players to their corresponding address. The order()
function inputs an amount, adds the amount to the current week’s inventory details
and updates the player’s order state.
Algorithm-1 describes theway the retailer places an order from the front-end. Algorithm-2
depicts how order() function in the smart contract works by considering the retailer role as an
example. The order() function calls the checkWeekEnd() function, which checks the order
state of all the players. Algorithm-3 highlights how checkWeekEnd() function works. If all the
players have placed the order, checkWeekEnd() function calls the updateDetails() function for
all the players and finally increases the week number to indicate the beginning of the
next week.
Event is a way that DApps can get information at a specific point during smart contract
code execution. An eventweekend{} is created to convey to the players that a particular week
has ended. Algorithm-4 considers retailer and wholesaler and defines how updateDetails()
works. Basically, updateDetails() function computes and updates the various inventory
details of the players based on the business logic. The way updateDetails() works for the
factory is slightly different because of the assumption that the factory produces the required
quantity of beer from its own production facility. Algorithm-5 defines the function
updateDetails() particularly for factory. If at least one of the players has not placed the order,

checkWeekend() simply returns without performing any action, and the other players have to
wait until everyone places the order.
5.1.3 Implementation phase. Smart contract coding, deployment and realization of DApp
have to be done as part of this phase. The entire logic of the game is written in Solidity
language in the form of smart contracts. Solidity is the flagship language of Ethereum. It is to
be noted that the Ethereum protocol supports many languages other than Solidity. Serpent
and Mutan are examples.
In general, the development environmental setup for a DApp is entirely different from that
for a conventional application. This section explains the major components/tools devised to
set up the development environment, particularly for making the prototype.
5.1.3.1 Geth. Geth or Go-Ethereum is a program that helps start an Ethereum node in a
system. Once this program is launched, it establishes the connectivity between a node and
blockchain. Geth is developed and maintained by the Ethereum community. Using Geth, it is
possible to connect with the Ethereum mainnet, testnets or other customized networks. It

offers options to connect with permissionless Ethereum public blockchain and permissioned
private blockchain.
5.1.3.2 Truffle. Truffle is a test-driven development framework for Ethereum-based
DApps. Truffle offers options for compilation, deployment and testing of Ethereum smart
contracts. It is available as a node package, and it facilitates a good number of external
packages developed by the community, which makes the development environmental set up
easy. In short, Truffle allows developers to spin up a smart contract project at the click of a
button and provides you with a project structure, files and directories that make deployment
and testing much more effortless.
5.1.3.3Web3.Web3 is fundamentally an Ethereum JavaScript API, which helps to connect

an individual Ethereum node with JavaScript Object Notation-Remote Procedure Call (JSON-
RPC) to read and write data to the network.
The two primary requirements for the development of BEBG are (1) a smart contract and
(2) a DApp with an appropriate front-end and a back-end that interacts with the players and
the smart contract. Figure 4 shows the structure of the DApp. Initially, an Ethereum-based
permissioned private blockchain was initiated with Geth. The advantage of such a
permissioned blockchain is that it does not require any real Ether to test or deploy any
applications. It allows creating fake Ethers, and one canmake continuous transactions. Using
Geth, to start a private Ethereum blockchain, a genesis file is created in themaster node. Here,
the admin node is referred to as themaster node. A tool called Puppeth is used for creating the
genesis data. Geth will take this genesis file to make the genesis block, launching a custom
private blockchain (Dannen, 2017).
Once the blockchain is started, other peers can be added. Players and admin can interact
with the DApp via browser. The front-end of the DApp is constructed with Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Ethereum JavaScript API.
DApp communicates with the Ethereum node through RPC. Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM) is an isolated environment for executing a smart contract that runs on all nodes of the
Ethereum blockchain. EVM has its language called EVM bytecode. Solidity, a high-level
language, is compiled into bytecode and uploaded onto the Ethereum blockchain. Figure 5a
shows the implementation of BEBG as a summary.
The admin deploys the smart contract as a transaction through an externally owned
account. Players can place their orders using their own externally owned accounts.
These transactions change the state of the smart contract. Figure 5b depicts the details of the
structures Details and Player.
Admin can input the various game parameters through a dedicated admin page. A
password is set for accessing the adminpage. These parameters include the number ofweeks to
be played, initial inventory, order lead time, delivery lead time, evaluation period, holding cost,
backorder cost, demand details and details of demand distribution. The admin UI is shown in

Figure 6a. Order lead timewill be zero by default because blockchain can place the order in real-
time. Order lead time and delivery lead time can be varied, provided that the value should be the
same for all four roles. Demand data can be uploaded as a.csv file. Other researchers have
already adopted this way of uploading demand data because of several advantages (Jacobs,
2000). Details of the demand distribution include the type of distribution and related
parameters. For instance, it can be a normal distribution, with a mean of 80 and a standard
deviation of 10. Admin can decide whether to share this information with the players or not.
Once all the required fields are entered, the admin can deploy the smart contract and generate
the public keys for the players. Using this public key and a password, the players can login to
the game window. Credentials can be manually shared with the players. A set of information
that includes (1) week details; (2) order lead time; (3) delivery lead time; (4) distribution details
(optional); (5) details of the player (player role, public key); (6) demand; (7) backorder; (8) received
quantity; (9) received backorder quantity; (10) shipped quantity (allocated for demand); (11)
shipped quantity (allocated for backorder); (12) shipment to be received (next week); (13)
backorder to be received (next week); and (14) end inventory details of all the players will be
available in theUI for each player. Figure 6b shows the player UI. In Figure 6b,A represents the
field for the player’s role, and B indicates the space for displaying the public ID for the role.
Fields marked as C, D, E and F show the end inventory details.
Each player can access the entire trade-related details of all the other players from their
respective “player details page” in the form of structured tables via the tabs provided in the
UI, at the bottom. The structure of the table is presented in Figure 7a. The table includes their
order details also. In Figure 7a,A depicts the space for highlighting the player role, and B is
the field for exhibiting the concerned public ID. By using the information available in this
table, players can take order decisions and enter the required order quantity in the field given
for the same. Players can download the trade details of any of the roles with the “download
button”. By clicking on the block number, players can access additional information like the
block in which the transaction is available, the transaction hash, current block hash, previous

block hash, recipient address, sender address, timestamp, transaction input, gas used, etc.
Figure 7b exhibits the page showing block details. The primary identifier of a block is its
cryptographic hash and it is analogous to a unique digital fingerprint. On the Ethereum
blockchain, gas indicates the cost required to execute a transaction on the network. Gas price
refers to the amount of ETH (in a small unit called gwei) that must be paid to miners for
processing transactions on the network. A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded
information identifying when a particular event occurred, usually giving date and time of
day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. Timestamps prove that a specific
document has existed since a period. Transaction hash is a value that gives a unique identity
for a transaction.
Once the game is over, the system calculates the performance of each of the roles and the
supply chain’s performance as a whole. Performance is calculated in terms of (1) total supply
chain cost, (2) bullwhip effect and (3) fill rate.After the game, eachplayer can see theperformance
details by clicking the “Click to see performance” button that appears on the window. Order
graphs of all the team players will also be available on the performance details page. Game
performance details can be downloaded using the concerned “Download details” button.
5.1.4 Trial game with blockchain-enabled beer game. For the convenience of the readers, a
trial game is set up and played for five weeks. The workflow in BEBG can be explained using
the game interactions between any two players. Explanations in this section are concerning
the interactions between two roles, i.e. retailer and wholesaler, and gameplay is narrated
using Figures 8–10. This trial game is purely for the sake of demonstrating the game and for
conveying the game logic. Order and delivery lead times are set as 0 and 1, respectively. Initial
inventory is 190 for all the players. The performance evaluation period is set fromWeek 1 to
Week 5. Demand is normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10.
Holding costs are 5, 4, 2 and 1 for the retailer, wholesaler, distributor and factory, respectively.
The backorder cost of each player will be double their respective holding cost. AtWeek 1, the
retailer receives an order (in the form of “Customer Demand”) of 79 from the end customer.
This demand is satisfied from the available inventory (sum of “Previous Inventory”,
“Received Demand” and “Received Backorder”). On Week 1, the available inventory equals
the initial inventory, which is 190. The retailer has sufficient inventory to satisfy the
customer. Hence, the retailer’s “Shipping Quantity (allocated demand)” forWeek 1 is 79. Now,
at the end of the week, the retailer orders 80 to the wholesaler (Figure 8a). The entered order
quantity communicates with the smart contract and instantly gets recorded in the
blockchain.
Any player can access details from the blockchain by clicking on the block number
provided on the player details page. The player details page for each role can be seen by
clicking the respective tabs given in the field for inventory details at the bottom of the player
UI. Based on the order quantity placed by the retailer, the state of variables in the smart
contract gets updated. End inventory details of the players are marked over their
corresponding inventory details tab. AtWeek 1, the end inventory of the retailer is 111. Order
placed by the retailer onWeek 1 will be available on the wholesaler side only onWeek 2. This
is due to the assumption that downstream members place their order on the weekend, and
upstreammembers start processing it only on the first day of the following week. OnWeek 2,
the wholesaler satisfies this order from their inventory. Hence, “Shipping Quantity (allocated
demand)” for the wholesaler onWeek 2 is 80 (Figure 8b). The retailer can get the information
regarding the shipment quantity from the wholesaler on Week 2 itself. In Figure 8c,
“Shipment to be received (next week)” is updated as 80 (in Week 2, the retailer receives an
order of 64, and satisfies the same, thusmaking the end inventory equal to 47). Shipment from
thewholesaler will arrive at the retailer side onWeek 3. In Figure 8d, it is given that “Received
Demand” is 80; thus, the end inventory becomes 36 (“Customer Demand” is equal to 91).

This sequence of operations repeatedly happens between each pair of consecutive players.
The decision on how much to order will be based on the information available from the
blockchain ledger. The player details pages for retailer andwholesaler after the completion of
the trial game is given in Figure 9a, b.
After the game is over, DApp performs the calculations and displays the performance
details on the game performance page as given in Figure 10a. For illustration, the order graph
generated by the DApp for the retailer is given in Figure 10b.
6. Discussions and findings
BEBG, the software tool presented in this paper, allows the participants to virtually take part
in the operations of a blockchain-enabled supply chain and helps them to familiarize the
application of blockchain in inventory management. BEBG facilitates the opportunity to
explore how the integration blockchain turns an untrustworthy scenario into a trusted one.
The intention of BEBG is not to make the player learn all blockchain concepts directly but to
provide a space mimicking one of the core application areas of blockchain technology. In this
sense, a basic understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain is essentially required for
interacting with BEBG. Plenty of offline or online-based games is available for learning the
fundamentals and relevance of blockchain. Users can use these games to acquire the
prerequisites for learning with BEBG. To effectively demonstrate blockchain technology,
academicians can consider combining other games with BEBG. With this, students can get
familiarized with the application of blockchain immediately after learning the fundamentals.
The same strategy can be implemented to train employees who are new to blockchain.
Information sharing is very crucial in supply chain inventory management. Information
sharing enables coordination and collaboration among the entities (Baah et al., 2021). Players
(retailer, wholesaler, distributor or factory) of BEBG communicate over a real blockchain
network. In this way, BEBG mimics blockchain-based information sharing in a four-stage
serial supply chain. Each role in BEBG is equivalent to a network node. They have to make
transactions to the permissioned Ethereum blockchain to share the order information with
immediate upstream entities. When a player places an order to the immediate upstream
member, it gets validated and recorded in the blockchain. The UI of BEBG provides the
details of each transaction made by all the supply chain entities. Players can see the
transaction details and verify the same. Moreover, players can witness the updating of
transactions in real-time. In short, the major benefits of BEBG include,
(1) It creates a simulated supply chain environment to explore blockchain technology.
(2) It provides the opportunity to interact with a live blockchain. This feature can give
the feeling of being in a real supply chainworking in a blockchain environment. Other
learning tools reported in the literature fail in this aspect.
With BEBG, players can understand the core characteristics of blockchain, such as
transparency, consensus-driven governance, decentralization and immutability. In fact,
transparency is the only characteristic that the participants can explicitly experience with
BEBG. Other characteristics like consensus-driven governance, decentralization and
immutability can be sensed indirectly, but it demands: (1) the presence of an instructor
and (2) a basic awareness of the fundamental concepts of blockchain and its underlying
mechanisms. Admittedly, basic awareness can be acquired with most of the tools reported in
the literature review section. The role of the instructor is ultimately to make the participants
aware of how the basic elements of blockchain are imparted in this application and how the
elements constitute blockchain’s core characteristics. For instance, while participants play
BEBG, if they are aware of the concept of public key, the instructor can convey that the
address of the player (node) displayed on the player UI is the player’s public key, which is
IMDS
122,4
1050
visible to all the other players (other nodes). Similarly, if the players are aware of the notion of
hashing, the instructor can insist the participants to compare the current block’s hash with
the hash of its previous block to convey how blocks get chained in a blockchain. Other roles of
the instructor include,
(1) To introduce thegame scenario: Participants interactingwithBEBGmaynot be familiar
with the theme of the beer game. An instructor is needed to convey the issues that
blockchain can address in the beer game scenario before they start playing BEBG.
(2) To explain how the elements of blockchain reflect in a practical application scenario.
(3) To clarify the queries from the participants. Interaction among the instructor and
players will make the gaming session more effective.
6.1 Evaluation
This work uses SWOT analysis to evaluate the proposed software tool. In general, SWOT
(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis is a method for understanding
the internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats that
characterize an organization, industry, individual or country. SWOT analysis can be
suitably used for evaluating game-based learning tools (Kavak et al., 2021; Kucukkal and
Kahveci, 2019). A SWOT analysis was conducted with the students and faculty members
directly involved in the development process of BEBG and the participants who played it.
The responses were compiled and presented in Table 4.
Informal feedback was collected from the participants after performing the SWOT
analysis. In general, participants expressed a positive attitude towards BEBG as a tool for
conveying the scope of blockchain in supply chain inventory management. Participants
pinpointed the fact that a basic level of understanding of blockchain concepts is a compulsory
requirement for learning the applications of blockchain with BEBG.
In the future, an appropriately framed game questionnaire can be used for formally
evaluating the proposed BEBG (Mittal et al., 2021). Aspects like topic mastery, entertainment,
socialization, etc. can be considered for the formal evaluation.
6.2 Implications of BEBG
Blockchain is a technology that will transfigure the culture of communication globally.
Though the termblockchain is widely popular, itsworking and underlying concepts are still a
mystery to ordinary people. Awareness of the fundamentals, relevance and applications of
blockchain is necessarily required for influencing its permeation (Mittal et al., 2021). In this
sense, BEBG has significant implications for society.
As of now, industries are highly interested in blockchain, but they remain hesitant to
adopt it due to the unavailability of skilled manpower exposed to blockchain’s potential
applications. It is a fact that those who are technically unaware of technologywill not attempt
to consider it in their business operations. Simulation games have significant scope in this
context. In this circumstance, BEBG can support the industry as a productive tool for training
employees who are new to this technology. On the other side, BEBG can be used in academic
institutions to teach blockchain applications in supply chain management. Students can
easily understand the notion of blockchain since BEBG is made in the form of a role-play
simulation game. Hence, the BEBG game can be included in the academic curriculum,
especially for management students, to facilitate experiential learning on applying
blockchain in supply chain management. Awareness among the students can significantly
accelerate blockchain’s acceptance and adoption rate.
The research community can suitably use the proposed BEBG to derive valuable
conclusions on the consequences and impacts of blockchain. It is a fact that themajority of the

SWOT analysis
IMDS

studies reported in the literature that highlight the benefits of blockchain inmanaging supply
chains are qualitative. Industries are awaiting valid studies that quantitatively assess the
benefits of blockchain adoption in business operations (Longo et al., 2019). In this situation,
experimental investigations are in demand. Supply chain role-play simulation games are
excellent experimental platforms. Developed BEBG can be presented before students,
managers and other interested stakeholders for collecting the game data to infer the impact of
blockchain in various dimensions. Further, this data can be scientifically analysed with
statistical tools and techniques to make valid conclusions.
7. Conclusions and scope for future work
This work presents a software tool called Blockchain-Enabled Beer Game (BEBG) that
can effectively convey the application of blockchain in supply chain inventory
management. BEBG is designed by adopting the theme of beer distribution game, and
it is prototyped in the form of a DApp. In this sense, this work contributes to the literature
on gaming applications in education. Development of the tool is completed by following
the design-based research methodology. A SWOT analysis is done to evaluate the
effectiveness of the tool. A basic understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain is a
prerequisite for using BEBG. An instructor is essentially needed to assist and guide the
players during the sessions on BEBG. The proposed game can be utilized for students,
business people and researchers who are new to blockchain applications in supply chain
management. BEBG can be devised as a pedagogical tool in academic institutions, as a
training tool for industries and entrepreneurs and as an experimental platform for
researchers.
Although BEBG is offering the intended outcomes in its current form, it is not free from
limitations and drawbacks. Most importantly, the procedure to set up the private blockchain
network for playing BEBG is a time-consuming task. It requires an advanced level of
knowledge in the technical aspects of blockchain. Again, the existing version of BEBG is
designed for interacting with a single team (with four members) at a time. Hence, it is
ineffective for a vast population of users. As a significant drawback, the game is not self-
explanatory. An instructor is needed to explain the logic of the beer game and describe how
blockchain serves the supply chain with its characteristics.
As future work, BEBG can be further developed tomake it into amulti-level gamewherein
the beginner levels can be designed to convey the fundamentals of blockchain. Audio-visual
elements can be additionally integrated with BEBG to minimize/eliminate the need for
instructors. DApp can be modified to support multi-team gaming for a large population of
participants. Finally, the game UI can be appropriately redesigned to visualize the global
state of the shared ledger.
