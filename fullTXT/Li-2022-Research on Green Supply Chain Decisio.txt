ABSTRACT
Abstract: Falsification of product energy efficiency data affects the
accuracy of carbon footprint tracking in green supply chain, and
is not conducive to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.
Therefore, applying blockchain technology to eliminate the risk of
fraudulent product energy efficiency data in the green supply chain,
and then investigating its impacts on green supply chain decision-
making is a new proposition worth studying. By constructing a
Stackelberg game model including a manufacturer and a retailer,
this paper analyzes the impacts of applying blockchain technology
on green supply chain pricing decisions, carbon emission reduction
and profit. We find that the increased risk of product energy effi-
ciency data fraud will have negative impacts on product wholesale
price, selling price, carbon emission reduction, and order quan-
tity; Furthermore, the improvement of brand credibility brought
about by the application of blockchain is conducive to enhancing
the level of carbon emission reduction, and has essential impact
on the wholesale price and the selling price, while the impacts of
the marginal use cost of blockchain are the opposite. Finally, the
triple factors including fixed cost, marginal usage cost and degree
of brand credibility improvement jointly affect the profits of en-
terprises when applying blockchain. Our results have important
managerial implications for government and companies who in-
tend to improve their financial and environmental performance by
applying blockchain technology in green supply chain.

1 INTRODUCTION
In order to accelerate the construction of ecological civilization and
achieve the common goal of mankind, the Chinese government has
made a solemn commitment and taken positive actions to strive to
achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals by 2030 and
2060, respectively. Doing a perfect job in carbon footprint tracking
is the key to achieve these goals. In practice, product energy effi-
ciency labeling provides consumers with product energy efficiency
information and is also an important measure of government en-
ergy conservation management. Even though energy label data
fraud is illegal, this phenomenon is common.
In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused
Volkswagen of Germany of installing relevant software on some
of its diesel vehicles, so that the car can reduce the emission of
pollutants in the state of being tested, so as to pass the car inspection,
while the exhaust emission of the car is 40 times the standard. In
2018, Tesla was reported by the EPA that the fuel efficiency values
of Model 3 were inconsistent with its energy efficiency label data.
On June 10, 2019, Gree reported to the State Administration for
Market Regulation that Aux produced and sold substandard air-
conditioning products. Falsification of energy efficiency data not
only damages consumer rights and the market reputation of green
products, but also has adversely effects on carbon footprint tracking.

How to solve the falsification of product energy efficiency data and
promote carbon emission reduction has become a key issue.
Blockchain technology has significant features such as decentral-
ization, consensus trust, asymmetric encryption, and timestamps,
which are the key to the efficient application of the achievements of
Industry 4.0 to the supply chain [1]. The application of blockchain
enables product-related information to be tracked and verified from
the production end to the consumer end, and cannot be tampered
with, effectively reducing operational risk and moral hazard and
has achieved certain results in practice. IBM proposed to apply
blockchain technology to food field, to control the whole process
of products from the source of production to the terminal of con-
sumption.
The application of blockchain technology will also generate
new costs, including the cost of improving hardware equipment,
training relevant personnel, andmarginal costs in the process of use.
However, blockchain technology can enable the smooth transfer of
information between members of the supply chain, help consumers
to obtain real information about products, and reduce the cost of
consumers’ choice. As a result, the brand credibility of the relevant
enterprises can be improved, and the firms can benefit. Based on the
above theoretical and practical researches, this paper aims to answer
the following questions: (1) What impact will the risk of product
energy efficiency data fraud have on the green supply chain? (2)
What impact does the application of blockchain technology have on
green supply chain decision-making? (3) When will it be profitable
to apply blockchain technology in green supply chain?
For analyzing the impact of the application of blockchain tech-
nology on the green supply chain, this paper constructs a green
supply chain benchmark model (T-model) and a green supply chain
model based on blockchain technology (B-model). First, we analyze
the impact of risk of product energy efficiency data fraud on the
green supply chain; Second, we analyze the impact of applying
blockchain on carbon emission reduction and pricing decisions.
Finally, we analyze the impact of applying blockchain on the profits
of manufacturer and retailer.
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Blockchain
The blockchain technology invented by Satoshi Nakamoto is a
radical innovation that can achieve much more. Kshetri believed
that blockchain technology has broad application prospects in the
field of logistics and supply chain [2]. The existence of the "bullwhip
effect" in supply chain aggravates the uncertainty of the supply
chain, and the application of blockchain technology can effectively
tackle this problem [3]. Transactions in the supply chain are faced
with verification cost and transaction cost, and the application of
blockchain technology can effectively reduce these two types of cost
[4]. Whitaker and Kräussl found that the transfer of credit between
members of the supply chain is smooth [5]. At present, Blockchain
technology not only helps to achieve product traceability, but also
helps to establish a credit rating system to improve the efficiency
of supply chain management [6].
Industry 4.0 provides a broader future for ecological and social
sustainability [7]. The technology that enables Industry 4.0 to be
effectively applied to the supply chain is the blockchain [2]. Ac-
cording to the research of De Giovanni, the blockchain technology
application in supply chain is not always profitable [8]. Min argued
that more attention should be paid to the role of blockchain in
improving the stability of supply chain [9].
2.2 Green supply chain
Both theoretical and practical research attach great importance to
the sustainable development of supply chain [10]. Bazan claimed
that reducing energy consumption is the key to reduce carbon
emission in supply chain [11]. Adhikari and Bisi applied cost sharing
contract and profits sharing contract to coordinate the green supply
chain, and further studied the impact of fairness concern on green
supply chain [12].
By constructing a Stackelberg game model, Xia studied the in-
fluence of cross-shareholding on green supply chain decision [13].
Chen analyzed the impact of cooperation between supply chain
members on pricing decisions and carbon emission reduction deci-
sions [14]. Wu found that increasing investment in carbon emission
reduction of products by manufacturers can create a win-win situa-
tion [15]. Huang investigated the impact of financing decisions on
carbon emission reduction under the cap-and-trade policy [16].
In summary, the research of blockchain in supply chain is mainly
qualitative, and the quantitative research is less. To the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the role of
blockchain in eliminate the risk of product energy efficiency data
fraud.We construct a green supply chain benchmarkmodel with the
risk of falsification of product energy efficiency data and a green
supply chain extended model using blockchain technology, and
analyze the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain
technology to the green supply chain, explore the effects of applying
blockchain technology on the green supply chain decision and
profit. The research results provide decision-making references for
supply chain members to complete the carbon emission reduction
goal.
3 MODELS
3.1 The green supply chain benchmark model
In this section, we contemplate the green supply chain composed of
manufacturer𝑚 (he) and retailer 𝑟 (she). The risk of falsification of
product energy efficiency data exists in the green supply chain, and
companies maymisreport their carbon emission reduction data [17].
The retailer needs to pay a certain cost to find qualified products,
including verifying the authenticity of product energy efficiency
data. The manufacturer increases the research and development
(R&D) investment so that the product can achieve carbon emission
reduction level 𝑘𝑇 on the basis of the original energy consumption
level to enhance the market competitiveness of the product, and
determines the wholesale price 𝑤𝑇 simultaneously. The retailer
orders 𝑞𝑇 units of product from the manufacturer and sells them to
consumers at price 𝑝𝑇 . The benchmark model decision sequence is
showed in Figure 1.
Due to the existence of the risk of falsification of product energy
efficiency data in the supply chain, consumers are in a relatively
weak position and cannot confirm whether the information ob-
tained is accurate, so they do not fully trust the energy efficiency

data of products. The greater the risk of falsification of product
energy efficiency data in the supply chain, the lower the consumer’s
trust in the product. Therefore, the product demand faced by the
retailer is affected by the price, the product carbon emission reduc-
tion level and the risk of falsification of energy efficiency labeling
data, and its order quantity is:
𝑞𝑇 = 𝐷 − Y𝑝𝑇 + _𝑘𝑇 (1 − 𝛾) (1)
Without carbon emission reduction investment, 𝑞𝑇 = 𝐷 − Y𝑝𝑇 >
0,and 𝑝𝑇 > 𝑤𝑇 > 𝑐 . The profit functions for the manufacturer and
the retailer are:
Π𝑇
𝑚 (𝑤𝑇 , 𝑘𝑇 ) = (𝑤𝑇 − 𝑐) 𝑞𝑇 −
𝑧𝑘2
𝑇

(2)
Π𝑇
𝑟 (𝑝𝑇 ) = (𝑝𝑇 −𝑤𝑇 ) 𝑞𝑇 − 𝑐𝐴𝐴

(3)
The relevant variables are explained as follows:
𝐷 is the maximum market demand; Y is the price sensitivity of
the consumer; _ is the consumers’ sensitivity to carbon emission
reduction level; 𝑐 is the unit production cost.
The risk of falsification of energy efficiency label data is charac-
terized by parameter 𝛾 , and 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1.
−𝑧𝑘2
𝑇
2 is the R&D cost paid by the manufacturer to improve the
carbon emission reduction level of the product; 𝑧 is the unit carbon
emission reduction cost.
−𝑐𝐴𝐴
2
2 is the cost paid by the retailer to find a qualified product;
𝐴 is the retailer’s effort level to procure eligible goods, and 𝑐𝐴 is
the marginal cost of this effort level.
Based on equations 1), (2) and (3), the optimal decision results
and profits of the manufacturer and the retailer are shown in Table
1. The risk of falsification of product energy efficiency data has the
following impacts on the supply chain:
Proposition 1. In the 𝑇 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 , 𝜕𝑘𝑇
𝜕𝛾 < 0, 𝜕𝑝𝑇𝜕𝛾 < 0, 𝜕𝑞𝑇
𝜕𝛾 < 0
, 𝜕𝑤𝑇
𝜕𝛾 < 0 .
Proposition 1 shows that as the risk of falsification of product
energy efficiency data increases, the carbon emission reduction level
𝑘𝑇 and the wholesale price𝑤𝑇 of the manufacturer will decrease,
and the order quantity 𝑞𝑇 and the selling price 𝑝𝑇 of the retailer
will decrease. The greater the risk factor of falsification of product
energy efficiency data, the higher the consumer’s distrust of the
manufacturer, which damages the brand credibility of the energy-
saving product. If the quality of product cannot be recognized by
consumers, the sales volumewill inevitably decrease, and the profits
of retailer and manufacturer will be affected. The manufacturer is
also reluctant to invest more in the research and development of
energy-saving products. In order to promote sales, the retailer will
choose to lower the price of products, forming a negative feedback
loop in the green supply chain.
3.2 The green supply chain model based on
blockchain
In the model based on blockchain, the retailer builds a transaction
platform based on blockchain technology, and she need to invest
a fixed cost 𝐹𝐵 to complete related technical transformation and
hardware equipment upgrading, including purchasing equipment
and hiring professional and technical personnel. In addition, the
marginal cost, related to the number of the trading, linked to the
use of the blockchain is generated during the transaction process.
In practice, blockchain technology has the characteristics of multi-
party writing, joint maintenance, public ledger, decentralization,
and non-tampering, which makes the transaction process more
transparent, removes operational risks andmoral risks in the supply
chain, and consumers can obtain real data about the product. As
transactions are more transparent and reliable, the brand credibility
of stakeholders in the supply chain will be enhanced by using
blockchain. At the same time, the retailer can obtain accurate data
of the product. Same as De Giovanni’s hypothesis, we assume that
the retailer’s price comparison cost is zero [8]. The supply chain
decision sequence is showed in figure 2.
When trading in the supply chain based on blockchain tech-
nology, the risk of falsification of product energy efficiency data
is effectively eliminated, and consumers can obtain real informa-
tion on product energy efficiency data. Thus, the retailer’s order
quantity is:
𝑞𝐵 = 𝐷 − Y𝑝𝐵 + _𝑘𝐵 (4)
The profit functions for the manufacturer and the retailer are:
Π𝐵
𝑚 (𝑤𝐵, 𝑘𝐵) = (𝑤𝐵 − 𝑐 − 𝑐𝐵 + 𝑣) 𝑞𝐵 −
𝑧𝑘2
𝐵
2
(5)
Π𝐵
𝑟 (𝑝𝐵) = (𝑝𝐵 −𝑤𝐵 − 𝑐𝐵 + 𝑣) 𝑞𝐵 − 𝐹𝐵 (6)
where:
𝑣 is the value coefficient of brand credibility, 𝐹𝐵 is the allocation
of fixed cost in each transaction, and is collectively referred to as

of other related variables in the 𝐵−𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 is the same as the specific
interpretations in the 𝑇 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 , and 𝑝𝐵 > 𝑤𝐵 > 𝑐 + 𝑐𝐵 − 𝑣 > 0. In
the −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 , specifically, the manufacturer broadcast the product
wholesale price𝑤𝐵 on the network, and this information is open
and transparent. The retailer can obtain the real information about
the product, and then decide the order quantity 𝑞𝐵 based on the
wholesale price published by the manufacturer, and sell them to
consumers at the price 𝑝𝐵 . Based on equations 4), (5), and (6), the
optimal decision results and profits of the manufacturer and the
retailer are shown in Table 1.
4 MODEL ANALYSIS
4.1 The effects of cost on firms’ decisions in
B-Model
This subsection focuses on analyzing the impact of cost on decisions.
Details as follows:
Proposition 2. (1) 𝜕𝑘𝐵
𝜕𝑐 < 0;
(2) If _2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
2Y , then
𝜕𝑤𝐵
𝜕𝑐 < 0, 𝜕𝑝𝐵𝜕𝑐 < 0;
(3) If _2
2Y ≤ 𝑧 < _2
Y , then 𝜕𝑤𝐵
𝜕𝑐 ≥ 0, 𝜕𝑝𝐵𝜕𝑐 < 0;
(4) If _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, then 𝜕𝑤𝐵
𝜕𝑐 > 0, 𝜕𝑝𝐵𝜕𝑐 ≥ 0.
Proposition 2 shows that as the production cost increases, the
manufacturer facing the greater cost pressure has to reduce the
relevant R&D investment, resulting in a lower level of product
carbon emission reduction; If _2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
2Y , even if the production
cost increases, the manufacturer and the retailer can still use price
promotion strategy; If _2
2Y ≤ 𝑧 < _2
Y , due to the cost pressure,
the manufacturer must choose to increase the wholesale price to
ensure his profit, and the retailer in the downstream of the supply
chain still has profit margin to sell at a lower price; If _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, the
manufacturer’s carbon emission reduction cost is high, and the
retailer has to raise the selling price in the face of further increasing
wholesale price.
4.2 The effects of blockchain technology on
firms’ decisions in B-model
The application of blockchain technology in the supply chain will
have the following effects:
Proposition 3. (1) 𝜕𝑘𝐵
𝜕𝑣 > 0, 𝜕𝑤𝐵
𝜕𝑣 > 0; (2) If _2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
Y , then
𝜕𝑝𝐵
𝜕𝑣 > 0; If _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, then 𝜕𝑝𝐵
𝜕𝑣 ≤ 0.
Proposition 3 shows that good brand credit has a positive impact
on the carbon emission reduction level 𝑘𝐵 and the wholesale price
𝑤𝐵 . If _2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
Y , from Proposition 2, we know that when the
unit production cost 𝑐 increases, the retailer will reduce the selling
price 𝑝𝐵 . Under this condition, if the value coefficient of brand
credibility 𝑣 increases, the retailer should increase the selling price
𝑝𝐵 . If _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, when the unit production cost 𝑐 increases, the retailer
will increase the selling price 𝑝𝐵 . When the value coefficient of
brand credibility 𝑣 increases, the retailer should decrease the selling

Figure 3: Impacts of 𝒗 and 𝒄𝑩 on the wholesale price
price 𝑝𝐵 . As consumers are price sensitive, the retailer should adjust
the pricing decision based on changes in different factors.
Proposition 4. (1) 𝜕𝑤𝐵
𝜕𝑐𝐵
< 0, 𝜕𝑘𝐵
𝜕𝑐𝐵
< 0; (2) If _2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
Y , then
𝜕𝑝𝐵
𝜕𝑐𝐵
< 0; If _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, then 𝜕𝑝𝐵
𝜕𝑐𝐵
≥ 0.
Proposition 4 shows that the marginal blockchain usage cost
𝑐𝐵 is also one of the important factors affecting the decision of
the supply chain. Comparing Proposition 3, we find that the mar-
ginal blockchain usage cost 𝑐𝐵 and the value coefficient of brand
credibility 𝑣 have opposite effects.
Proposition 5. (1) If 𝑣 − 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 𝑇𝐻1, then𝑤𝐵 ≥ 𝑤𝑇 ; (2) If 𝑣 − 𝑐𝐵 ≥
𝑇𝐻2, then 𝑘𝐵 ≥ 𝑘𝑇 ;(3) If 𝑣 − 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 𝑇𝐻3, then 𝑝𝐵 ≥ 𝑝𝑇 .
Where 𝑇𝐻1 =
−2𝑧𝛾 (𝐷−Y𝑐 ) (1−𝛾 )
4Y𝑧−_2 (1−𝛾 )2 , 𝑇𝐻2 =
−𝛾 (𝐷−Y𝑐 ) [4Y𝑧+_2 (1−𝛾 ) ]
2Y [4Y𝑧−_2 (1−𝛾 )2 ] , 𝑇𝐻3 =
−3𝑧𝛾_2 (𝐷−Y𝑐 ) (2−𝛾 )
2(_2−Y𝑧 ) [4Y𝑧−_2 (1−𝛾 )2 ] .
Proposition 5 shows that the value coefficient of brand credibility
𝑣 and the marginal blockchain usage cost 𝑐𝐵 have important impact
on the decision-making level. Three thresholds are given between
𝑣 and 𝑐𝐵 . When the difference between 𝑣 and 𝑐𝐵 is greater than the
corresponding threshold, the decision levels of the manufacturer
and the retailer in the𝐵−𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 is greater than those in the𝑇−𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 .
Next chapter will use numerical analysis to more intuitively analyze
the impact of blockchain technology on the supply chain.
5 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
This section compares and analyzes the impact of applying
blockchain technology on green supply chain decision-making
and profits through numerical simulation. The basic parameters
are set as follows: 𝐷 = 200, Y = 1.2, 𝑐 = 10, 𝑧 = 2, _ = 2, 𝛾 = 0.1.
5.1 The impact of blockchain on the wholesale
price
Figure 3 shows that the wholesale price𝑤𝐵 decreases with increas-
ing 𝑐𝐵 and increases with increasing 𝑣 , which is consistent with the
conclusions of Propositions 3 and 4. Combining Proposition 5, we
discover that when the blockchain marginal usage cost 𝑐𝐵 is high,
and the value coefficient of brand credibility 𝑣 is low, the wholesale
price𝑤𝐵 in the 𝐵 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 will be lower than the wholesale price
𝑤𝑇 in the 𝑇 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑙𝑒 .

5.2 The impact of blockchain on the carbon
emission reduction
Figure 4 shows that the carbon emission reduction level 𝑘𝐵 de-
creases with increasing 𝑐𝐵 and increases with increasing 𝑣 , which is
consistent with the conclusions of Propositions 3 and 4. Combining
Proposition 5, when the blockchain marginal usage cost 𝑐𝐵 is high,
and the value coefficient of brand credibility 𝑣 is low, the carbon
emission reduction level 𝑘𝐵 in the 𝐵 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 will be lower than the
carbon emission reduction level 𝑘𝑇 in the 𝑇 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑙𝑒 .
5.3 The impact of blockchain on the selling
price
Figure 5 shows that the selling price 𝑝𝐵 decreases with increasing
𝑐𝐵 and increases with increasing 𝑣 , which is consistent with the
conclusions of Propositions 3 and 4. Combining Proposition 5, when
𝑣 −𝑐𝐵 ≥ 𝑇𝐻3, then 𝑝𝐵 ≥ 𝑝𝑇 . Figure 5 is plotted under the condition
_2
4Y < 𝑧 < _2
Y . When _2
Y ≤ 𝑧, the conclusion has been given by
propositions 3 and 4, and its graph is no longer drawn here.
5.4 The impact of blockchain on the profits
Figure 6 shows that the manufacturer’s profit Π𝑇
𝑚 decreases as the 𝛾
increases;When the value coefficient of brand credibility 𝑣 is greater
than the marginal use cost of the blockchain 𝑐𝐵 , Π𝐵
𝑚 is always

Figure 6: Impacts of blockchain on the manufacturer’s profit
Figure 7: Impacts of blockchain on the retail’s profit
greater than Π𝑇
𝑚 ; When the value coefficient of brand credibility
𝑣 is less than the marginal use cost of the blockchain 𝑐𝐵 , the risk
coefficient 𝛾 has a threshold 𝛾0, so that the manufacturer’s profit
Π𝐵
𝑚 is equal to Π𝑇
𝑚 ; If 𝛾 is less(greater) than 𝛾0, Π𝐵
𝑚 is less(greater)
than Π𝑇
𝑚 .
To facilitate analysis, in Figure 7, the fixed investment of the
retailer’s blockchain construction 𝐹𝐵 in the 𝐵 −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 is assumed
equal to the cost paid by the retailer to find a qualified product
in the 𝑇 − 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑙𝑒 . The impact of the fixed cost of the retailer’s
blockchain construction 𝐹𝐵 on the profit is analyzed in Figure 8. As
can be seen from Figure 7, the retailer’s profit Π𝑇
𝑟 decreases with
the increase of the 𝛾 ; When the value of brand credibility is greater
than the marginal use cost of the blockchain, the retailer’s profit
Π𝐵
𝑟 is always greater than Π𝑇
𝑟 ; When the value coefficient of brand
credibility 𝑣 is less than the marginal use cost of the blockchain
𝑐𝐵 , we found that if 𝛾 is less(greater) than 𝛾1, Π𝐵
𝑟 is less(greater)
than Π𝑇
𝑟 . In Figure 8, the value coefficient of brand credibility 𝑣
is assumed equal to the marginal use cost of the blockchain 𝑐𝐵 . It
can be seen from the figure, 𝐹𝐵 and 𝑐𝐵 have the same effect on
the profit. In summary, whether a retailer should adopt blockchain
technology is influenced by the triple(𝑣, 𝑐𝐵, 𝐹𝐵).
6 CONCLUSION
This paper studies the impact of applying blockchain technology
on the green supply chain decisions. We found that when certain
Figure 8: Impacts of blockchain on the retail’s profit
conditions are met, the application of blockchain technology can
effectively improve the economic and environmental benefits of
the supply chain. The main conclusions are as follows:
• When the risk of falsification of product energy efficiency
data increases, the carbon emission reduction level decreases,
making products less competitive in the market. The whole-
sale price, the order quantity and the selling price decrease
accordingly, and the profits of the manufacturer and the
retailer decrease, too. The falsification of product energy
efficiency data seriously affects the healthy development
of the supply chain, increases the burden of government
supervision, is not conducive to carbon footprint tracking,
and affects the realization of carbon peaking and carbon
neutrality goals.
• Cost is an important factor influencing decision-making.
When unit production cost increases, the manufacturer will
reduce the carbon emission reduction level of products,
which is not conducive to the realization of carbon peaking
goals. The manufacturer and the retailer should make reason-
able pricing decisions based on the size of carbon emission
reduction cost and the changing trend of unit production
cost.
• Applying blockchain technology has an important impact on
supply chain decisions. When the value coefficient of brand
credibility increases, the manufacturer will increase the prod-
uct carbon emission reduction level and the wholesale price.
However, the impact on the selling price is relatively compli-
cated. When certain condition is met, the selling price of the
product will increase (decrease) with the increase (increase)
of the brand credibility value coefficient. The impact of the
blockchain marginal usage cost on supply chain decisions
are opposite to the impact of the brand credibility value
coefficient.
• Applying blockchain requires increased fixed investment
and marginal usage cost, but it also helps to improve brand
credibility. These three factors jointly determine whether
the incremental profit brought by the use of blockchain tech-
nology can cover its costs, which is also the key to whether
supply chain members choose to apply the technology.
This paper provides some managerial implications:
48
Research on Green Supply Chain Decision-Making Based on Blockchain to Eliminate the Risk of Energy Efficiency
Data Fraud BDSIC 2022, November 25–27, 2022, Xiamen, China
• The improvement of corporate brand credit brought about by
the application of blockchain technology deserves attention.
From the perspective of regulatory authorities, the govern-
ment should pay attention to the positive role of blockchain
technology in eliminating the risk of falsification of product
energy efficiency data.
• Manufacturer should actively improve production technol-
ogy and increase production efficiency to reduce production
costs. The government should introduce relevant policies to
create favorable conditions for green product manufacturer
to reduce production costs, thereby promoting carbon emis-
sion reduction. At the same time, the manufacturer and the
retailer should make reasonable price decisions based on the
specific circumstances of each cost to maximize profits.
• Whether an enterprise chooses to apply blockchain technol-
ogy needs to be comprehensively considered. The govern-
ment should guide and standardize the behavior of market
entities, give relevant policies to reduce the cost of construc-
tion and use of blockchain technology, and accelerate the
promotion and application of blockchain in green supply
chain.
This paper investigates the role of blockchain technology in
green supply chain, and analyzes the impact of applying blockchain
technology on the decision-making and profits of supply chain
members. However, this study has certain limitations, and future
research can consider the impact of carbon quotas on green supply
chain decision-making; The application and impact of blockchain
in carbon trading can be further explored.
