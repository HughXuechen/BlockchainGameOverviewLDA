Abstract The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with the application
of blockchain technology in railway system. As the focus of this book is BigData and
Service Operations Management, it is pertinent to understand Big data-blockchain
relationship first before we can delve into Railway service operations and applica-
tion.We begin by linking Big Data and Blockchain, followed by studying blockchain
applications in various sectors, in order to provide a solid foundational understanding
of the same. Thereafter, we set the context of Indian Railways, moving on to a struc-
tured understanding of the railway service and blockchain applications. followed by
creating a specific provenance framework followed by conclusion, limitation. Big
data signifies a novel technology paradigm for data that are generated at high velocity
and high volume, and with high variety. The significance of Blockchain technology
has drastically enhanced with the advent of Big Data because blockchain technology
can help in recording and storing data for long duration. These technologies are
envisioned as a game changer capable of revolutionizing the business drastically.
Blockchain which is essentially a ‘distributed ledger’ has found applications in the
financial and supply chain space. The value derived through this technology is in
terms of transparency, veracity, track ability, traceability and auditing. The possi-
bility of transparent information that can be traced to the origin of materials and
processes and operations which are shared on blockchain ledger can provide product
provenance, chain of custody and authenticity. Transport is an important service and
represents the essence of service operationsmanagement. Railways is an eco-system.
It provides a service that is asset intensive which has its own challenges in terms of
maintenance and infrastructure. At the same time there are service concerns in terms
of human safety and comfort. This provides a complex eco-system to work with.
Blockchain as a digital tool intervention providing transparency, provenance and
auditability can enhance the performance of the system This study attempts to create
a model to understand the contribution of blockchain in the Indian Railway system.

1 Introduction
The Blockchain characteristics which make it a disruptive technology lies in its
following characteristics. The data on Blockchain is always complete, accurate, reli-
able and authentic thereby providing Integrity. It is believed that the overall cost of
the chain shall also decrease as many intermediaries which are into auditing, assur-
ance and quality and thus might get supernumerary. It is Cryptographically secure
which is due to the consensus mechanism. Further, Transparency can be attributed
to the non- alteration feature along with the time-stamped version.
Railways is an eco-system. It provides a service that is asset intensivewhich has its
own challenges in terms ofmaintenance and infrastructure. At the same time there are
service concerns in terms of human safety and comfort. This provides a complex eco-
system toworkwith. Blockchain as a digital tool intervention providing transparency,
provenance and auditability and can enhance the performance of the system This
study attempts to create a model to understand the contribution of blockchain in the
Indian Railway system.
The chapter is organised as follows. First chapter explains the relationship between
big data and blockchain. The next section looks at comprehending blockchain as a
technology and its various applications in business. This is followed by the relevant
background studies of blockchain to understand the spread of applications. This
is followed by creating the background with the details of the context of Indian
Railways. Further, mapping the provenance framework to blockchain application is
accomplished followed by conclusion [15], future research and limitations.
2 Big Data and Blockchain
The era of ‘Big data’ has arrived. It is not limited to amere concept, fad but has started
impacting the lives and businesses significantly [15]. Big data is the compilation of
huge data sets that can be analysed computationally to provide insights and patterns,
trends and associations relating to behaviour and interactions [1, 2, 9, 10]. It has
applications in almost all industries: retail, healthcare, financial services, government,
agriculture, customer service among others.
In the initial study four specific features characterized big data [24]. These include:
• Volume which represents the large scale of big data, which requires innovative
tools for their collection, storage, and analysis.
• Velocity refers to the rate at which the data are generated or updated, pointing to
the real-time nature of big data.
Frontiers of Blockchain for Railways 295
• Variety refers to the variation in types of data. Big data can come in diverse
and dissimilar forms from multiple sources, such as texts, spreadsheets, audios,
videos, and sensors.
• Veracity refers to the complex structures of big data assets that make them
ambiguous, imprecise and inconsistent.
The process of Big data analytics includes the process of examining large data
sets to find and visualise business insights viz. hidden patterns and correlations, envi-
ronmental impacts, business trends, customer choices. These insights and analytical
results can help targeted approach towards marketing, better operational control
and efficacy new revenue opportunities, and better customer service. The successful
application of big data requires a well-researched and realistic deployment of big
data analytical tools. The steps include data generation, data acquisition, data storage,
advanced data analytics, and decision making for value creation. One of the ways
of recording and storing data is to use cloud-based storage, but it is an expensive
solution. Further, Blockchain provides a cheaper, efficient solution for storing data
through its traceability and distributed ledger solution. Its ability to guarantee the
accuracy and transparency of data has shifted the focus onto blockchain.
Blockchain can be an efficient mode for online data storage [11]. In addition to
this, the decentralized network can grant access to many users. Various parties in
a transaction store the transactional information in different ledgers. All of these
parties can be granted access to one single network with the help of Blockchain.
Transactions can be recorded in the network which can be further validated by all
the concerned parties. Since all the information will be stored in the Blockchain it
will be convenient to access these details. Because of the design of the Blockchain
technology, users can view historical transactions effortlessly. Tracking the origins
of a transaction becomes effortless.
3 Comprehending Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology can be perceived as a kind of open distributed digital ledger
that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in an authentic way.
Rather than relying on a third trusted party such as a bank, it uses a peer to peer
approach where verification and validation are done by the nodes of the distributed
network. Not only this technology eliminates the involvement of a Third Party for the
purpose of authentication (because very often these third parties become the source
of security breach). Using this approach, the possibility of fraudulent transaction
is minimized to zero because the group of transactions called blocks is not only
protected by digital signature that subsequently goes through a mathematical puzzle
for time alignment, but also needs to be the longest and fastest one in the network
amongst the existing good nodes to succeed. This means that all transactions are fully
secured and fraudulent transactions, if any shall form a long chain of such blocks
whichwill be transparently visible to all parties clearly identifying the perpetrators for
296 M. G. Sharma and S. M. Sharma
disciplinary action and also such fraudulent transactions will be next to impossible
to get overlooked. Thus this mechanism is completely secured from hacking by
outsiders through spoofing, phishing, etc.
4 Recent Background Studies
Researchers have combined supply chain and block chain and analysed the potential
for value creation for various stakeholders both in the upstream and downstream
business ecosystems. The model builds a common IT based platform centred on
distributed data storage using the node consensus algorithm to generate and update
the same. The fact that the data is encrypted ensures security of transmission and
restricted access. This helps in speeding up the cash flow in an enterprise and thereby
improving asset creation and utilization [19]. Studies cite that Blockchain is a digi-
tally signed account transaction with a highly trusted record [3, 4]. in some policy
studies it has been shown that Transparency, traceability and auditability provided
by blockchain help minimize system corruption and fraud while keeping the system
under control [3, 14]. Integration of blockchain with supply chain would ensure
product tracking which is a big challenge; [5, 6]. The intermediary can be eliminated
and information exchange between parties is structured and controlled. It has been
propounded that overall efficiency of the system is increased because of transparency
provided by physical traceability in supply chains, information and financial security
inmanagement systems, leading to an increase in overall efficiency [6, 8]. Blockchain
technology has the ability to address all three dimensions to address collabora-
tion, cost optimization, and risk management. This technology allows companies
to gain total access of the end-to-end supply chain data while ensuring that it can
be securely stored and privately shared with authorized stakeholders [23]. There are
many industry specific studies for application and challenges of block chain appli-
cation like the construction industry [22]. Researchers have looked at the possibility
of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) to overcome such events [16]. As has
been illustrated by Muniandi blockchain can help achieving the goals of providing a
platformwithmore transparency, fit for use by all passengers without any exclusions,
prevents siloation and prevents frauds.
Researchers have looked at the potential application of block chain for digital
ticketing and enhancing customer experience [20, 21]. This can be done by a mix
node which may be active or passive. The passive nodes only maintain the latest
data and do not perform any mining operation [18]. Since, the data is verified by
simultaneously cross checking with adjoining nodes, it is fail safe, collusion resistant
and resilient to external attacks. Thus this technology is useful in various facets of
train operation and maintenance [20, 21]. Researchers have also found utility for
block chain in ensuring safety in heavy haul operations by reducing manual decision
making [12, 13].

5 Application Context of Indian Railways
Railways are the preferred choice of transportation mode in the world population due
to their environment-friendly, safer, long-distance interstate, and intercity mobility
options. Indian Railways (IR) is the fourth largest Railway network in the World
and considered the lifeline of the country. About 22,000 trains run on the network
in a day. It therefore has a large fleet of about 11,000 locomotives, 70,000 coaches
and about 2.94 lakh wagons. During 2018–19, it carried 8,439 million passengers
and 1221.48 million tonnes of freight traffic. The present rail share of freight is 27%
and is mainly attributable to traditional bulk commodities like fertilizers, coal, iron
ore and food grains. These constitute approximately ~60 % of IR’s freight business.
IR needs to cater to freight increase for commodities which are dominated by road
movement through appropriate strategies/product offerings. Such a modal shift is
possible by improving the transit through speed and predictability and by improving
the capacity through better terminal and network access and improved availability
of rolling stock. The service in terms of product offering and costing also has to
improve to meet the customer needs in real time. Thus the objective of railway to
provide a safe, secure, dependable, economical and reliable service. It represents a
service which is both technology and human intensive and applies all the essential
elements of service operations. This is the basis of including the chapter in this book.
The application of Blockchain in Railways can be classified into three broad
categories (Fig. 1).
1. Infrastructure and Real Time Operations.
2. Equipment Maintenance Management.
3. Customer oriented Service Operations.

Given the objective of Indian railways to provide safe, reliable, dependable
and comfortable service, the blockchain intervention shall secure both financial
transactions but also train running (Fig. 2).
Railway systems are infrastructure intensive and these have to be maintained in
proper fettle so that trains can ply smoothly. The fixed infrastructure consists of
tracks, overhead wires for electric traction and the signaling system. The moving
assets are the rolling stock consisting of the coaches, wagons and locomotives. The

5.1 Infrastructure
With the primary focus on safety and given the enormity, complexity, heterogeneity
an interoperability issues of the present system, blockchain can be a solution for
the same. The existing system in Indian Railways has decentralized train operations.
There are huge challenges which include system dissonance at the interface, commu-
nication failure, SPAD due to wrong signal. The fixed infrastructure is monitored
through IT systems like the track management system for track, the Supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for the overhead wires and the elec-
tronic interlocking systems for the signaling system. These systems presently work
in isolation, however the benefits can be enormous if these communicate with each
other and share relevant data authentically and proper coordination is there. Through
the application of blockchain, the actors in the system can access data real time and
transparently.
The condition of the infrastructure elements can also be captured in tamper-proof
records. This data can further be utilized to ensure that the work of maintenance is
carried out in an optimized manner thereby reducing the down time and improving
the availability for train operations. Communicating through smart contracts with
the track elements which include level crossings, signals, interlocking track circuits,
releasing them and setting diversion points will provide efficiency in the system.
No manual intervention will be required and would be done by the automated
central system based on rules and without conflict. This can enhance the total track
availability of the track thereby impacting the throughput of the track.
Presently train operations are controlled centrally, however these can be made
more dynamic by decentralising the decision making of routing in a manner which is
safe, reliable, efficient and auditable. TheEuropean train control systemwhich Indian
Railways plans to adopt is a step in this direction as itmaintains “safe blocks” inwhich
trains operate and takes corrective action in case the operator does not react timely.
Most of the operations change every minute based on failure of equipment or other
unforeseen circumstances. This decentralized system shall make it possible for the
trains and track elements towork as first-level active participants and carry out several
actions such as route locking, setting a changing point position, communicating with
other trains, automatic speed control and braking, GPS drove Train localization.
All these actions shall be network-driven and ensure compliance with the standard
working rules. The reliability of which shall be derived from thematching of physical
reality (trackside equipment) and the IT counterpart (Digital twin). Thiswould enable
the detection of trackside malfunctions and the prevention of accidents. Going by
the cardinal principles of Railway Signaling which give utmost priority to the safety
of human life, the validation of every decision on the go shall be done by strong
authorities as multiple parties such as station masters. Or even a better alternative
will be to involve the signaling rules and control procedures in the smart contract, a
copy of which shall be carried by each train to be followed while making their own
route-based decisions. In this case, a Blockchain API shall be superimposed over
such Rail network enabling all the trains with conflicting movements for a particular
300 M. G. Sharma and S. M. Sharma
route to act as the ‘active nodes’ dynamically andmake a ‘consensus-based-decision’
as elaborated in the schematic.
Further, combination of these emerging technologies like blockchain, VC,
RBC, the heartbeat signal from trains, ATO control algorithms, 5G using train-to-
track/track-to-track communication links, can solve the problem of railway traffic
conflict control along with the objective to minimize or nullify the overall indi-
vidual train delay progressively. Blockchain can be used for all other transactions
for example, for checking the driver’s license and driver authorization, checking the
compatibility of sub-systems and billing the infrastructure. As of now, the technology
is in an experimental state where potential use cases are being developed and tested
to affect the following areas.
5.2 Maintenance (Rolling Stock and Infrastructure)
Trains are complex equipment and have large number of subparts and assemblies.
Maintenance is an important function to meet the objective of reliability, safety
and dependability of the train. Maintenance are broadly of two types: Preventive-
Scheduled and Reactive-Unscheduled Maintenance. It is seen that with higher
preventive maintenance, need and cost for reactive maintenance gets reduced.
Further, reactive maintenance has more negative impact because of unscheduled
breakdowns and higher downtime cost. Scheduled maintenance are triggered by
time period, usage or monitoring the condition of parts. Currently the rolling stock is
maintained based on preventive maintenance and follow scheduled repairs based on
time or usage. Another possibility is to have condition based monitoring wherein it is
essential to monitor the performance of the parts in real time based on the condition
of the equipment. This implies that we can predict when things will go wrong and
pull back the train for repairs at the right time. Also these individual components
or sub-assemblies are connected together and their performance can be observed in
tandem. Remote monitoring of diesel locomotives by providing sensors in critical
subassemblies has been in practice. The alerts are sent to a central control centre
and corrective or preventive action initiated to prevent failure. These alerts can also
be shared in real time with the manufactures and designers and this will help to
close the loop and ensure better quality of the products as all defects and failures get
logged and can be investigated using the data prior to the failure. It will be easier for
the suppliers to link these to individual batches in their production and they would
be able to zero in on the operators and the machines. The transaction costs of this
traceability which is presently done manually will also be nominal.
This would also help in reduction in the warranty claims and effective spare parts
management. The spares mostly rotables can be tracked and performance logged,
thereby providing better control at a reduced cost. The onetime cost of the technology
has to be traded off against the long-term benefit.
Since the components from many Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
have to talk to each other, blockchain technology can be the solution for securing the
Frontiers of Blockchain for Railways 301
network and linkages with complete traceability. Similar usage can be there in the
smart coaches being developed by Indian Railwayswherein different components for
passenger interface, electrical and braking systems, water and infotainment etc. are
monitored through sensors.Once this is done then all the data fromall the coaches and
locomotives can be shared and used for improving the maintenance thereby reducing
the downtime and enhancing the utilisation of the asset. Further, there are track side
equipment like hot box detectors, wheel impact load detectors etc. which externally
monitor the condition of rolling stock. The data from these can also be integrated to
enhance the overall output and understanding of the rolling stock. The movement of
these stock is being planned based on the operational software which can share inputs
with this system and this will ensure that the maintenance can be planned with least
disturbance to the movement of trains. All these are important in the context multi
operator regime when clear responsibility and traceability has to be ensured from a
legal and contractual perspective. Smart contracts can be implemented to make rule
based contracting. Further block chain supported by IOT and sensor technology shall
provide the fundamentals for modern maintenance. IOT based condition monitoring
and sensors which shall form dense, connected networks will transmit data to central
data centres but alongside the strengths the threats to the system is equally precarious.
Blockchain through its encrypted tamperproof system can provide a trustworthy
system which is verifiable and the data trail is auditable.
5.3 Customer Service
The next set of service operations application for Blockchain is focussed around the
customer experience and journey seamless and hassle free. Presently the customer
buys tickets and orders for services like E-catering and blankets for which payments
are made through different gateways and there is also the need to authenticate the
identity of the traveller to ensure that only authorised passengers are travelling. This
is evenmore important from the security perspective, Blockchain ledger can be useful
in ensuring the above and facilitating instant payments with no need to authenticate
further and also guaranteeing the identity. This can further be extended to intermodal
transfers and movements which will further enhance the customer experience and
provide seamless transport solutions. These would help journey planners to provide
end-to end solutions across sea, road, air and rail. The same is the case for freight
customers or in the parcel business where the need to carry the railway receipts as
proof will be eliminated with use of blockchain technology. This will also be useful
in delivering consignments to third parties and avoid documentations like Goods
Receipt Note. Challenges of Short delivery, Incorrect deliveries can be addressed
like many times the consignment would not get loaded in the train or would get
over carried. Block chain will be a reliable and accurate medium to confirm the
transaction. This shall help in building the brand image of the Railways as a safe and
secure service provider and earn the loyalty of the customers.
302 M. G. Sharma and S. M. Sharma
There has been a focus on customer retention by rewarding travellers for their
loyalty. It is being done both by the credit card companies and railways. For this,
loyalty programs need to be accurate and user-friendly to ease the complexity
involved in keeping an account of passenger’s loyalty points and redemption as per the
defined policies. In accuracy is a deterrent to future loyalty. Blockchain can be used
to develop a platform to improve the interoperability between multiple schemes but
also allows invoicing and payment transfer between partners using smart contracts.
Redemption of reward points from one service to another such as automatic credit
of points after a train journey, which can further be used to pay an online cab service
shall add to a better travel experience.
For undertaking the journey in any reserved class on Indian railway, a prescribed
proof of identity shall be available online. On the blockchain, identification of the
passenger, change of booking or enquiry can be done using traveller IDs which
eliminates the need to carry any hard copy of id proof during travel. This will enhance
the travel experience of the passenger and the same can also be used for seamless
inter-modal connectivity as most passengers use road or metro etc. for the first mile
and last mile connectivity to the rail system.
Automatic billing can be done on Rail networks which provide access to other
passenger and freight railways at regulated infrastructure charges. The passengers
buy tickets manually and the payments to subcontractors and vendors are made
through traditional methods. Blockchain technology enable all these payments to
happen instantly on a secure network using Blockchain ledger. The apportionment
of earnings between various players and also between various railway systems can
be done easily without having system of manual checks which add to the inefficiency
and delays. This will simplify the accounting as well as the statistical formulations.
The traceability will also help in case of accidents where compensation is tenable as
this can be handled easily and securely using the block chain technology.
On the freight side too blockchain can help connect the customer and the logistics
provider in a better way. The access to real time loading information, train and truck
movement during transfer and availability of crew can help reduce the cycle time and
thereby bring down the logistics cost. The smoother flowof authenticated information
across the various players can be a game changer and this can reduce the needs for
the manual interfaces used presently to collect the information which is subject to
noise and leads to sub-optimal decision making and planning.
6 Mapping the Railway Application to the Provenance
Framework
From the literature, aStandardProvenanceknowledge frameworkhas beendeveloped
by [17] that has its application in showing how provenance knowledge can enhance
assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain (Fig. 4).
Frontiers of Blockchain for Railways 303
Fig. 4 Standard provenance knowledge framework
This model is very comprehensive and captures the contribution of Blockchain
very succinctly. The risks perceived by the customer can broadly be classified into
physical risk, financial risk, psychological risk, social risk and physical risk. These
risks help in providing origin, authenticity, trust of custody and integrity to the supply
chain. This eventually links to the blockchain capability of traceability, Certifiability,
trackability and verifiability.
This standard model was explained by the authors to the focus group members.
The focus group of seven Railway Experts through a brainstorming exercise have
mapped it to the Railway Application Provenance Model. One of the author is a
railway expert with 30 years of experience in Indian Railways. The total experience
of the focus group is 140 years. This provides an understanding of the intrinsic reason
of blockchain application.
It was observed that the blockchain capabilities that provide value to the chain
are different. Whereas in the infrastructure and rolling stock vertical, the value is
derived through trackability but in the case of Customer service it is authenticity of
transactions and assurance that is required (Fig. 5).

Implementation of Blockchain are filled with challenges. Rail system being a
complex ecosystem having convergence of many supply chains – interoperability
amongst different chains require huge scale. Indian Railway system is going through
a major transition along technology, regulation, energy source and all of them create
their own set of uncertainties. Cybersecurity and unrestricted access available to the
auditors may itself be misused, either intentionally or inadvertently. This needs to
be considered and where possible, mitigations should be applied. The geographical
span of Indian railways network is huge and Blockchain network alongside through
the nook and corner of the country faces huge scalability constraints such as network
bandwidth and data storage. Other factors such as size of block and time gap between
two consecutive blocks also effect the scalability. There is an inverse relationship
between the size of the block and the no. concurrent of transactions taking place. India
as a country is developing and the geographical spread of the country and railway
network is huge. The availability of 24×7 network at remote locations from where
the data is generated can also be a constraint in the implementation, however, this is
a steady slow process of technology acceptability and eventually the infrastructure
constraints are overcome.
7 Conclusion
Transport is an important service and represents the essence of service operations
management. Amongst the different modes of transportation railway system remains
one of the most complex systems. In this book on ‘Big data and service operations
management’ in this chapter, we have explored Blockchain-based application in the
railway ecosystem from service operations perspective.
This is an era of Big data. The volume and variety of data generated is enormous
and it is generated by human-users and machines. Any business or organization that
can assimilate data to address the difficult questions about their operations can benefit
from big data. the demand for big data transcend across all sectors and business.
Those who work to understand their customers’ business and their problems will be
able to proactively identify big data solutions appropriate to their needs, and thus
gain competitive advantage over their competitors. Blockchain which is radically
changing the future of transactions in industries can help in smart contracts and as a
digital currency. It can help in digital record keeping in operations and maintenance
as well as for IPRs and Research. It can help in descriptive analytics, diagnostic,
prescriptive, predictive and cognitive analytics.
Although the technology of Blockchain has been there for quite some time, but
the advent of big data has made the application of Blockchain more significant.
Blockchain can effectively store online data and perform monitoring and controlling
accessibility of data across in an efficient manner. Various parties in a transaction
store the transactional information in different ledgers. All of these parties can be
granted access to one single network with the help of Blockchain.
Frontiers of Blockchain for Railways 305
Broadly considering three verticals along which the application can be catego-
rized. These include infrastructure, rolling stock and customer service. All three
orchestrate synchronously to provide the safe and reliable service. Thus we can
understand what happened, why it happened and what will happen. Organization-
ally, this digital transformation which will have a cross functional impact will need
multi-disciplinary teams for innovating, operationalizing and transforming. Each
department like accounts, HR, operations, infrastructure, business development and
procurement will be impacted and will need to modify their systems and processes
to cope with the change. Thus IR will need to change how it educates its managers
to understand, assimilate and champion the transformation. This would be a cultural
transformation andwould also need chief technology officers at all levels so as to help
leaders think, act and react differently. Since new possibilities will arise they need to
comprehend the same and think divergently. Teams will become collaborative and
mobile and it will be easier to connect virtually across the geographical boundaries.
We can use simulation based decision making and the system can self-learn
thereby reducing the human intervention and improving the quality of decision
making. Each of these vertical application is a study in itself, infest with its own
specific challenges. These can be specific directions for the study.
This is a conceptual paper of application of blockchain for Indian railways. The
contribution of this paper is to provide a structure to understand blockchain appli-
cation in Indian railways and provide a framework for blockchain applications in
railway specific operations management. Future research can look at technology
adoption models and being a complex ecosystem, the technology adoption and diffu-
sion also will be fest with complications and difficulty. Models can be devised to
address these issues.
The technology adoption will also include change management and human
resource challenges which can be researched. This shall have socio-technical rami-
fications. This can also be a potential area of research. The interface and interac-
tion of blockchain and supply chain is significant and has to prudently understood
and analyzed before and during implementation. The supply chains of electronics,
mechanical, electrical spare parts have to be properly aligned.
The limitation of this study is that it has limited number of members in the focus
group and biases might arise. Further, the focus has been on one technology but AI,
IOT along with Blockchain will provide a more comprehensive understanding and
trajectory of technology change. Future studies can include the total impact of all
these technologies jointly.
To Conclude, understanding the tradeoffs of security, privacy, transparency, func-
tionality, auditability, risk, and scalability are delicate balances which have to be
analyzed while consideration of the blockchain implementation in Indian railways.
