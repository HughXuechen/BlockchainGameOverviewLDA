Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are emerging field characterized by complex data
model, dynamics and strict time requirements. Ensuring cybersecurity in ITS is a complex task
on which the safety and efficiency of transportation depends. The imposition of standards for a
comprehensive architecture, as well as specific security standards, is one of the key steps in the
evolution of ITS. The article examines the general outlines of the ITS architecture and security issues.
The main focus of security approaches is: configuration and initialization of the devices during
manufacturing at perception layer; anonymous authentication of nodes in VANET at network layer;
defense of fog-based structures at support layer and description and standardization of the complex
model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI at application layer. The article
oversees some conventional methods as network segmentation and cryptography that should be
adapted in order to be applied in ITS cybersecurity. The focus is on innovative approaches that have
recently been trying to find their place in ITS security strategies. These approaches includes blockchain,
bloom filter, fog computing, artificial intelligence, game theory and ontologies. In conclusion, a
correlation is made between the commented methods, the problems they solve and the architectural
layers in which they are applied.
Keywords: ITS; IoT; VANET; cybersecurity
1. Introduction
Internet of things (IoT) is a consequence of converging of several technologies like: real-time
analytics, machine learning, embedded systems, wireless networks, control systems, home and building
automation. From the consumer point of view, IoT is a synonymous to products pertaining to the
concept of the intelligent home, intelligent healthcare, intelligent city and so forth. Many of these
areas have similar characteristics and face similar challenges. Borrowing technologies between IoT
sub-areas is common but needs to be considered well and explored in practice. Despite the similarities,
even within the same area the requirements for communication range and bit rate, real-time operation,
reliability and security vary. As sub-area of the smart city Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are
characterized by many of the features of IoT. Their distinctive features are: strict time requirements,
dynamics and large volumes of data. One of the main characteristic property of the ITS is the high
demand of cybersecurity. ITS applications can be classified as: transport safety, road traffic efficiency
and infotainment. Road safety applications have very high cybersecurity requirements combined
with hard real time constrains. Although road traffic efficiency and infotainment applications are
not directly related to the physical safety of road users, cybersecurity requirements remain high, as
a breach in any of them can reflect on the efficiency of the whole ITS. For example, overloading the
communication channel for infotainment application purposes may interfere with the normal operation
of security application, which may be critical [1].
Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) are a key component of all modern developments for
ITS. Nodes (vehicles) in VANET exchange short messages, called beacons, during certain periods.

The beacons contain important information about vehicles and the environment, for example, direction,
acceleration, speed, road conditions, weather conditions and so forth. Connecting vehicles in wireless
one hop communication poses many tasks such as authentication of newly joined vehicles, the need to
protect the identity of the user, interruptions, providing multi hop communication, high heterogeneity
(depending on whether the cars are congested in a big city or in a suburban area). Much of the research
on ITS cybersecurity focuses on network security [2–5].
Reference [6] indicates the importance to maintain connectivity of nodes with software-configurable
security services that ensure protection. This need is dictated by the characteristics of VANET—high
dynamics in changes of network topology, uncertain structure, unclear network perimeter, high
mobility, enabling and disabling of nodes.
Reference [7] compares the two main technologies for VANET—cellular and based on Wi-Fi.
It points out that knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each technology is a step towards stable
and secure communication in VANET.
In Reference [3] the authors emphasize the need of an efficient and secure authentication and
privacy scheme and offer storage a group of aliases through a bloom filter. The experiment will be
discussed in more detail in Section 5.
VANETs are not the only vulnerable component of ITS. Cybersecurity in a system as complex
as ITS takes place on all levels. Efforts to automate transport have led to the application of Fog and
Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning in ITS. This can significantly slow down
the actual application of fully automated vehicles due to the complexity of ensuring cybersecurity.
The non-technological aspect of ITS security should not be underestimated. It is expressed in careful
consideration of authorization policy, development of standards, governance, policy, regulation,
awareness and education [8].
In Reference [9] the authors overview the main ITS enabling technologies—smart vehicles, public
transportation, IoT devices, networking and summarizes the issues by linking them to the relevant
components in ITS. The authors argue that the most outstanding advantage of removing the human
factor during the driving task is that traffic safety will be improved. In order to achieve that a
cybersecurity strategy should be established. The authors highlight the role of the politics and the
necessity of international benchmarked regulatory framework.
Reference [10] emphasize the connection between Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and
road safety. The authors consider that standardization of procedures, education of the society and
establishing dedicated communication networks for additional security between communicating
vehicles are important ways to implement cybersecurity in CAV.
In Reference [11] the focus is on certifications and audits based on standards and regulations
developed in cybersecurity for CAVs. The main difficulty is the complexity of the system combining
robotic vehicles and vehicles driven by humans, pedestrians, cyclists and so forth. Another aspect is
social IoT enabling Mobility as a service (MaaS). There are significant unanswered questions concerning
privacy and the reliability of the information. The answers to these questions will largely determine
what ITS will look like in the future. The authors believe that a very restrictive regulation will slow
down CAVs development and real-world deployment but this is a necessity to prevent safety and
security from being sacrificed by commercial interests.
2. ITS Cyberattacks
The heterogeneity of ITS complicates the task of classifying and identifying cyberattacks.
This section lists ITS specific attacks, which will later be associated with the architectural layers:
2.1. VANET Man-in-the-Middle Attack
The man-in-the-middle attack is a classic type of cyberattack, that the attacking party intercepts
messages between the two communicating parties and forwards modified content. In case of
man-in-the-middle attack on the physical and data link level in VANET, the attacking party take into
Computers 2020, 9, 83 3 of 12
account the fact that the nodes have a certain range. They either have to attenuate the signal or they
have to modify the location information in case they take advantage of a situation where the attacked
nodes are out of range but the attacking party is in the range of both nodes. Example of man-in-the
middle VANET attack: the attacking party interferes in the communication between two or more
vehicles and changes their location information. This can disrupt the proper functioning of road safety
or efficient traffic applications [9,12].
2.2. Routing Attacks
The physical and the data link level of VANET define one-hop communication. Multi-hop
communication is provided by routing protocols. Routing attacks are cases in which there is a breach
in the routing protocols of VANET and a malicious node prevents the data from reaching their final
destination. Black hole attack is an example of a routing attack in which, malicious node silently drops
all the packets, that are supposed to be re-transmitted. Gray hole attack is another sub-type of routing
attack in which dropping is performed only on selective packets [9,12].
2.3. Timing Attacks
Timing attacks cause a communication delay and thus disrupts the operation of applications
that have real-time requirements. For example, in a cooperative adaptive cruise control system an
emergency message is sent to the neighboring vehicle in order to prevent collision. If the attacking party
manages to cause a delay (for instance by overloading the network traffic), despite the correct receipt
of the data, the reaction in the braking system will delay and the collision will not be prevented [12].
2.4. Spoofing
In case of spoofing attack the attacking party broadcast corrupt data in order to cause invalid
reaction in the system. Example: The attacking party is sending bogus GPS coordinates and thus
disrupting the operation of the navigation system [9].
2.5. Denial-of-Service Attacks (DoS)
DoS is a classic cyberattack that affects the availability of system components. In ITS it is especially
dangerous in case some safety critical feature is concerned. Sybil is typical VANET DoS attack in which
a malicious vehicle impersonates as multiple identities and injects false broadcast messages into the
network. Thus disrupts the normal exchange of information [9,12].
2.6. Internal Vehicle Network Attack
Due to the fact that most internal vehicle networks are designed at a time when cars are not
connected, they are vulnerable to attacks. For example, the attacker can easy gains access to the internal
network, based on CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol and thus manage to control airbag control
system [9].
2.7. Identity Attack
Identity privacy ITS may refers to the privacy of a driver, passenger, pedestrian and so forth.
The attacking party may try to extract information about personal data, location, actions, habits.
An example of an identity attack is a case in which the attacking party manages to obtain information
on how nicknames are assigned in VANET and thus track the location of a vehicle [9].
2.8. Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping is a classic passive attack in which the attacking party does not disrupt
the communication process but manages to gain unauthorized access to information. Example:
The malicious party may eavesdrop on the communication between the vehicle and the road
Computers 2020, 9, 83 4 of 12
infrastructure during the payment of the toll and thus gain access to the user’s bank account
details [12].
2.9. Attack against Fog
Due to their physical characteristics (usually physically accessible) and limited resources in
comparison to the Cloud, ITS’s Fog components are difficult to protect and can be subject to various
types of attacks. Example: Fog node summarizes and purifies data from sound and vibration sensors.
By altering the aggregated information, the malicious party directly affects the data analysis algorithm
for planning the organization of the road traffic [5,9].
2.10. AI Attacks
The attacks against AI could be related to data manipulation (Data poisoning attack),
Environmental Perturbations or Policy manipulation. Example: In order to mislead the machine
learning algorithm, the attacking party may select and send data so as to cause false trends in the
model [9,13].
3. ITS Architecture and Security Challenges
The ITS can be seen as a sub-type of IoT and so it can be developed using similar approaches and
architectures. The Figure 1 depicts the architecture contours of most IoT developments. It could also
be applied in ITS [8].

3. ITS Architecture and Security Challenges 
The ITS can be seen as a sub-type of IoT and so it can be developed using similar approaches 
and architectures. The Figure 1 depicts the architecture contours of most IoT developments. It could 
also be applied in ITS [8]. 
 
Figure 1. Internet of things (IoT) architecture outlines [8]. 
The presented architecture consists of four layers responsible for different functions of IoT. 
Applying this outlines in ITS gives each layer a more specific functions. 
Perception layer of ITS encompasses users’ smartphones, in-vehicles’ sensors and infrastructure 
devices. Many of security issues at perception layer are concerned to configuration and initialization 
of the devices during manufacturing and internal vehicular network design, as in most cases it is not 
intended for connected cars [8,14]. 
Network layer is a complex alloy of wired and wireless technologies. One of the big cybersecurity 
questions at this layer is providing authentication of the nodes in VANET. Due to the need to protect 
personal data, authentication needs to be anonymous. The limited range of nodes and the strict time 
requirements introduce additional difficulties [2,3,6]. 
Among the developments for VANET architecture standards, two network technologies are 
outlined—the family of standards IEEE 1609 (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment—WAVE), 
based on 802.11 and the 3GPP standard (applicable for 4G and 5G LTE-Long Term Evaluation networks 
called Cellular Vehicle to Everything—C-V2X) [4,7,15]. 
WAVE describes authentication mechanism based on a list of hierarchical certificates. It specifies 
precise requirements for specific cryptographic primitives and does not provide an alternative. The

based on 802.11 and the 3GPP standard (applicable for 4G and 5G LTE-Long Term Evaluation networks
called Cellular Vehicle to Everything—C-V2X) [4,7,15].
WAVE describes authentication mechanism based on a list of hierarchical certificates. It specifies
precise requirements for specific cryptographic primitives and does not provide an alternative. The issue
here is that in dynamic situation and load network the procedure described in standard is not satisfying
the time constraints. It require: the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) and concrete
elliptic curves P-256 and P256r1; the maximum size of the private key—32 bytes; AES-CCM (Advanced
Standard Encryption in Counter Mode)—a symmetric encryption algorithm and the hash function
SHA-256 [4,7,16].
C-V2X technology defines two modes of operation—mode 4 (Unmanaged Mode) and mode 3
(Managed Mode). The standard security mechanisms of LTE standards are applicable in Managed
Mode. In Unmanaged Mode, security issues remain unresolved. The standard sets requirements for
duplication protection, integrity, confidentiality and envisage the use of pseudonyms. It outlines the
requirements but does not make recommendations for specific mechanisms [7,16].
The 5G philosophy is service oriented. Slicing Security as-a-Service or SSaaS, enables operators to
provide differentiated and customized security package, including encryption algorithms, encryption
parameters, capabilities for blacklist and whitelist configuration, authentication methods and isolation
strength and so forth. [15].
At support layer the data is being processed in the Fog or Cloud depending on their temporal
and spatial specifics and security considerations. As an emerging technology, Fog-based structures
present new security challenges because the operation environments of distributed Fog systems are
more difficult to protect than a centralized Cloud. The existing security and privacy measurements for
cloud computing cannot be directly applied to the fog computing due to its features, such as mobility,
heterogeneity and large-scale geo-distribution [5,8].
The application layer reflects the final interaction with the user, which can be expressed in
information, warning and even activation of a certain system in the vehicle (in the case of unmanned
vehicles). Before reaching the user the data acquired in the sensor layer can be processed in multiple
locations. Depending on data semantics, security requirements and time constraints calculations can
be done locally, in the vehicle itself, in road side units (RSU), at Fog or Cloud. The data in ITS meet
all the characteristics of Big data, which is a precondition for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Its application into security-critical systems such as ITS must be carefully considered, as it is very
vulnerable to a number of cyberattacks [1,8,15,17–19].
Table 1 summarizes the security issues addressed in this document, their respective architectural
layers and the possible cyberattacks.

4. Conventional Methods in ITS Cybersecurity
Although ITS are relatively new, many of the technologies they integrate have been tested in
practice and the experience gained can be reused. In terms of security, some of the classic approaches
will certainly play a key role. The effective approaches of defending support layer are: strong
authentication, encrypted communication, key management, regular auditing and private network
and secure routing [8,12,20,21].
Cryptographic methods are the heart of cybersecurity. The application of cryptographic
techniques in the automotive industry has a history since 90s. Traditional algorithm and encryption
standards are not completely suitable for ITS as they cannot meet the requirements of high throughput
performance, low latency and reliability. Lightweight encryption has become a basic requirement in
ITS [8,12].
Network segmentation is another classic approach that improves both network security and
efficiency. When talking about ITS network segmentation, it should be taken into account that some of
the nodes are mobile, dynamically joining and with anonymity requirements. In VANET, the separation
of clusters from communicating cars would play an important role, thus building hierarchy in the
network. Depending on the goals and the situation, different metrics can be taken into account—the
behavioral characteristic, based on historical data, the resources, the location and so forth. [21].
In Reference [21] authors describe IoT security segmentation pattern. They take into account
security level, attack surface, heterogeneity, identity, compliance, threats and overhead.
5. Innovative Approaches in ITS Cybersecurity
The introduction of technologies that were not originally designed to serve time-critical areas, as
well as introduction of technologies from areas where cybersecurity is not directly related to users’
physical security, leads to an increase in the vulnerability to cyberattacks in ITS. Borrowing technologies
between different sub-areas in IoT is quite natural. In this section some innovative technologies that
have found application in ITS or have found application in similar areas and their application in ITS
is yet to be experimented with are presented. Given the multi-faceted nature of ITS, approaches to
achieving cybersecurity objectives are multidimensional. Methods discussed in the Section 6 relate to
the application layer and are holistic in nature, while this section discusses methods that have a local
impact—in the network and perception layer. Blockchain, anonymous authentication in Fog and bloom
filter are applicable in resource reduction in anonymous authentication of dynamic nodes in VANET.
Security-by-contract and sensor fusion are applied in the sensor layer. Although data fusion can take
place in any of the layers in the system, the sensor fusion approach is related to the perception layer, as
the closer to the source the information is processed the less security risks exist [2,3,6,8,14,22–24].
5.1. Blockchain
Blockchain is an extremely dynamic technology in recent times. With regard to ITS, one of its
main applications is in anonymous authentication solutions in VANET. The use of distributed storage
can be very suitable for storing data of the legitimacy of nodes. The nodes decide whether to admit
a new participant in the communication based on its reputation. In this way, malicious nodes are
discouraged. Another option for applying a blockchain is upper architecture layers as a secure data
warehouse. Although some of the described examples present MANET networks, the simulation
results can be considered to be applicable to VANET as a subtype of MANET [6,22–25].
The authors of Reference [22] introduce the concept of “shortest, most reputed path” using the Ad
hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol for MANETs. They create a simulation,
using Matlab, dividing the network into subnets in each of which there are mining nodes that monitor
of the other nodes and add transactions to the blockchain. The blockchain contains information about
the reputation of the nodes. The authors claim an approximately 12% improvement in overall packet
delivery in the presence of routing attacks, compared to conventional routing algorithms in MANETs.
Computers 2020, 9, 83 7 of 12
The authors of Reference [25] discuss the general importance of security in IoT systems, focusing
on MANET. They describe a future development (similar to Reference [21])—blockchain-based OLSR
(Optimized Link State Routing Protocol), taking into account not only the node’s reputation but also
its energy level.
In Reference [24] an overview of significant applications of blockchain technology and possible
attacks is presented. To analyze the traffic behavior on the network, five virtual clients were created.
The authors conclude that the problem of ensuring data security is not completely resolved. They
emphasize the possibility of identifying traffic to blockchain technology using behavioral analysis and
recommend hiding traffic and preventing the interception of traffic from this technology, including by
behavioral analysis.
Reference [23] offers a different application of blockchain for IoT—SEBS (Secure Element Blockchain
Stratagem). It applies blockchain in the data layer, combining it with hardware secure elements in the
sensor layer. The conclusion is that the proposition can increase the performance of critical security
operations by 31 times, all while reducing computational and memory overheads.
Reference [6] introduces blockchain with floating genesis block and its contribution to resolve
the issue of continuously growing blockchain within the VANET/MANET networks. The authors
offer a comparative analysis with other methods that reduce the time to decide on the connection of
new nodes in VANET and conclude that this modification allows resolving the blockchain growth
issue completely in case blocks are downloaded from trusted nodes. They note that the modification
introduces an element of centralization of the system and make a proposal to mitigate this drawback.
5.2. Anonymous Authentication in Fog
As Fog nodes provide precious opportunities to protect the privacy of the consumers before
personal sensitive data leave the edge. Fog technology is one of the solutions to the problem of
anonymous authentication in VANET [2,8,14].
Reference [2] introduces fog computing for anonymous vehicle legitimation. The advantages of
this solution are that do not need to authenticate all the RSUs in the driving period, thereby reducing
the times of authentications between legitimate vehicles and RSUs. The system model of this study
consists of three layers: the cloud layer, the fog layer and vehicles.
5.3. Bloom Filter
Bloom filter is another solution to the issue of reducing resources when using changing aliases.
Reference [3] presents validation of pseudonyms in VANET, based on Bloom Filter. Bloom Filter
stores all certificates generated for a given period. Instead of requiring a response from a trusted
party for each package received, a reference is made to the Bloom Filter, which refreshes over time.
The disadvantage is that this method gives false positive results. The authors include auxiliary
methods—requesting the trusted party and list of illegitimate participants.
5.4. Security by Contract
Security by contract paradigm is based on a description of the relevant features of the application
and the relevant interactions with its host platform. This approach is a possible solution to many of the
security tasks in the sensor layer, as it is also applicable to devices that are put into operation [14].
In Reference [14] is presented security solution for correctly defining rules in IoT devices applicable
by a user, administrator or manufacturer. It consists of security contracts that can be verified against the
security policy stored within the Fog node. By real smart home experiment, pseudo-code algorithms
and a number of illustrative examples the authors motivate the necessity to develop such system.
5.5. Sensor Fusion
Sensor fusion can offset incorrect information from corrupting computations and reducing data
ambiguity. A great advantage of this technology is that it allows the use of inexpensive sensors and
Computers 2020, 9, 83 8 of 12
thus significantly reduces the final cost of the products without affecting the measurement result.
Sensor fusion is already applied in practice in many modern automobiles [9].
6. An Intelligent Security in IoT
Due to the complexity of ITS an intelligent and proactive defense approach is a necessity.
The methods described in this section relate to the holistic approach of ITS cybersecurity and have been
successfully applied in security systems in other areas. In relation to ITS, they are mentioned on many
sources as methods that will outline the overall appearance of ITS in the future but still the experimental
results of their application in ITS are few. This is largely due to the fact that the development of the
whole system is not mature enough. This section discusses examples of the application of artificial
intelligence, machine learning, ontologies and game theory in security systems [8,15,17].
6.1. Artificial Intelligence
With the advent of IoT, AI is increasingly used in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), due to
the increased risk to security and complexity of tasks. AI will definitely find a place in future ITS
cybersecurity, due to the need for adaptive solutions to the rapidly changing system and the need for a
holistic approach [11,17].
Reference [13] describes a novel hybrid Deep Learning and Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DeepDCA) in
the context of an IDS. The authors argue that experimentation results show that DeepDCA demonstrate
over 98.73% accuracy and low false-positive rate.
6.2. Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is the subset of AI that is most widely used in cybersecurity systems. Its
weakness is that it is vulnerable in the training phase, so the training data set must be carefully selected.
If a noise is inserted, the whole system can be compromised (Envision Attacks, Poisoning Attacks).
It is necessary to create a strong classifier through proactive approaches. Due to this disadvantage, ML
techniques are often used as an auxiliary mechanism [15,26].
Reference [27] presents automatic IP blacklisting applying linear regression techniques.
The authors claims that it can reduce the incorrect blacklisting by nearly 90% and improve the
time to eliminate malicious IP compared to human agents.
6.3. Ontology
Ontology is a promising tool to address heterogeneous issues, especially for unstructured data.
The application of ontology to the IoT security domain is an emerging area [8,28].
In Reference [28] authors present a data-security ontology for IoT, from the perspective of data.
It represents a common vocabulary describing the practical security aspects related to data access and
exchange relevant to producers, consumers and intermediaries. Its objective is to provide relevant
information about data provision, access and handling, as well as to regulations that may affect it and
certifications and provenance.
6.4. Game Theory
Game theory is a powerful mathematical tool that has been successfully applied in the fields of
cybersecurity and privacy [8,29].
In Reference [29] the proposed method combines reputation and game theory-based methods for
selfish node detection in MANETs. It consists of several steps which are performed as games between
nodes in a clustered network when sending or forwarding the node’s data packets. Each player
independently chooses their own strategy for forwarding or not forwarding. The experimental results
have shown that the proposed method can detect selfish and malicious nodes efficiently, decrease
the end-to-end delay of the data and consumption of node resources (energy, battery, memory, etc.).
Computers 2020, 9, 83 9 of 12
The proposed approach gives the malicious and selfish nodes the second opportunity to cooperate
with other nodes and thus improve the network performance.
7. Discussion
ITS is a complex multi-component system in which is sensible to cybersecurity and vulnerable in
all its subsystems. In presented paper a four-layer model of IoT architecture that has been adapted to
differentiate the issues more clearly is shown.
At perception layer Spoofing attacks result in incorrect data acquisition. Denial-of-Service can
cause failure of any of the systems. The main issue at this layer is configuration and initialization of
the devices during manufacturing and internal vehicular network design, which does not comply with
the connection of vehicles in dynamic networks.
Security by contract concept is a promising technology at perception layer, especially with regard
to issues related to changes and improvements in security strategies. Sensor fusion is successfully
applied in practice in order to eliminate inaccurate information.
At network layer numerous of cyberattacks are possible due to dynamic topology of the VANETs.
Sometimes the attacking party can act passively, for example eavesdropping. Black and gray hole
attacks omit the re-transmission of packets and thus disrupt communication. Man-in-the-Middle
attack spread modified data. Timing attack delay transmission of the data and this way it damages
systems that rely on real-time response. Sybil rely on replacing the identity of a nodes, thus can cause
Jamming or Denial-of-Service. Due to the possibility of Identity attack the authentication of the nodes
is necessarily to be anonymous.
Different solutions with regard to anonymous authentication, are being sought to reduce the
network and computing resources required for the continuous exchange of pseudonyms in VANET.
One of the fastest growing technologies that is being experimented in this area is blockchain.
In addition to anonymous authentication, blockchain in ITS security could find application in upper
architecture layers as a secure data warehouse. Another answer to the question of reducing resources
in anonymous authentication is Fog computing. Keeping the vulnerable identity information of the
nodes at the edge of the system would limit the risk of attacks. The use of several complementary
technologies is a possible solution to the issue of resource-effective authentication. A good example
of this is a bloom filter as a main method and a blacklist and a request to the legitimate party as an
auxiliary methods.
At support layer, defense of fog-based structures is the main issue.
Conventional security methods as cryptography and network segmentation are the most
appropriate solution for Fog defense. They need to be adapted to the needs of ITS.
At application layer, the main issues that security should focus on are description and
standardization of the complex model of data and metadata and defense of systems, based on AI.
The possible attacks at this layer are Data poisoning, Environmental Perturbations and
Policy manipulation.
Due to the complexity of ITS, an intelligent security strategy is required. AI, machine learning,
ontologies and game theory are tools that have found application in cybersecurity solutions. Their
application and adaptation to ITS needs to be studied in detail. Intelligent security often is based on
cooperation between cybersecurity specialists and a variety of intelligent security solutions.
An example of collaboration between experts and automated cybersecurity approaches is a
system for cyber-risk scenario analysis for connected and automated vehicles (CAV) based on Bayesian
Network (BN) presented in Reference [30]. In the initial phase of establishment, BN is constructed based
on expert judgment. Quantitative and qualitative information from NVD (National Vulnerability) for
88,438 known vulnerabilities were used to refine BN, using machine learning methods. The performed
tests demonstrate nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk
level. Proposed methodology is applied to CAV GPS systems.
Computers 2020, 9, 83 10 of 12
Another example of simulation analysis that can help in developing methodologies to resist or
mitigate the effects of the attacks in a CAV platoon, such as intrusion detection, privacy protection
and counteracting control methods anomaly detection is presented in Reference [31]. To understand
cyberattack effect propagation the authors use a directed graph model, presented with adjacency matrix.
For the simulation it is assumed that platoon of 15 CAVs is traveling on a straight road segment without
overtaking and lane changing and incorporate the effects of three types of attacks (bogus messages,
replay/delay and collusion attack). It was concluded that cyberattacks could influence vehicles
unnecessary delay, extremely small gap, abrupt acceleration/deceleration and rear-end collisions.
The authors propose the cooperative intelligent driver model.
The two described studies are good examples of initial development of ITS cybersecurity
methodologies that need to be considered and integrated into a comprehensive system and tested into
real vehicles.

8. Conclusions and Future Work
ITS are complex, time-critical systems in which the physical safety of road users and the efficiency
of transport services directly depend on the provision of cybersecurity. Although developments for
ITS standards exist, the imposition of a comprehensive standard as well as the creation of a security
strategy is not yet a fact. The interoperability between the various standards within the ITS and the
interaction with the surrounding world (Smart Cities, IoT) needs to be well considered and tested.
Some of the described technologies such as blockchain, lightweight cryptographic methods,
network segmentation and sensor fusion will certainly find a place in the appearance of ITS, although
more experimental results are needed, as well as tests on how they will fit into the overall system.
Another part of the discussed technologies is in the initial stage of research regarding their
application in ITS. AI and Machine Learning are mentioned in many sources as an important
technology that will determine the vision of ITS. The advantages of utilizing such approaches are
greatly publicized, while the security implications of their integration with ITS remain not studied

enough. On the other hand, experimental results from the application of these technologies in ITS
security systems are needed. Another technologies that is expected to be developed under ITS domain
are Game theory and Security-by-Contract. They are successfully applied in IoT cybersecurity solutions
and is likely to find a place in ITS cybersecurity.
