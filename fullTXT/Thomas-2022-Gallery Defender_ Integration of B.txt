Gallery Defender: Integration
of Blockchain Technologies into a Serious
Game for Assessment: A Guideline
for Further Developments
André Thomas and Alexander Pfeiffer
Abstract Blockchain technologies are already being used in many different appli-
cations to secure specific data sets. For the same purpose, blockchain is also used in
digital games. This technology is not only discussed, but also actively implemented
in the educational sector, for example, in such projects as “Blockcerts”. Typical
applications are issuing certificates and their validation by using a one-way hash;
more creative uses of blockchain beyond that are still uncharted territory. This arti-
cle shows how blockchain (Ardor and its childchain Ignis) has been integrated into
a serious game for assessment of students’ knowledge. More specific details include
encrypted meta-data in the respective transactions, and offer guidelines for future
projects in education.

1 Introduction
Blockchain offers significant opportunities, particularly from the socioeconomic per-
spective, that go beyond the current ways in which we deal with data storage. This
includes such areas as art [17], museums [13] and learning. A summary of opportu-
nities of blockchain for education can be found in the report by Grech and Camilleri
[7]. Transfer of data sets into the blockchain and potentially rapid verification of
their validity opens up new infrastructural and other possibilities that are related to
the defining qualities of blockchain-based technical solutions [7, 11].

– Transparency enables provenance of digital assets, i.e. artworks, so their buyers
and sellers can conduct transactions and be sure that each party has the right to
enter into that transaction;
– Controllability (self-sovereignty) allows individuals to identify themselves online
while at the same time maintaining control over their personal data;
– Trust, in its algorithmically ensured form, provides enough confidence in pay-
ments and verified certificates;
– Disintermediation removes central controlling authority from the interactions
between different blockchain users: the transactions are carried out in a peer to
peer fashion, and the required records are made available to every participant;
– Immutability of a decentralized ledger of records enables permanent storage,
without the possibility of modification unless designed otherwise;
– Collaboration can be carried out in a more democratic manner, as the parties can
transact directly with each other without the need for mediating third parties.
Based on the information available in 2017, the report concludes that the use of
blockchain applications in education is still in its infancy, although it is gaining fast
momentum. A number of case studies have been conducted nevertheless, including
the implementations at the Open University UK, the University of Nicosia, MIT
and various educational institutions in Malta: each of these implementations were
in a pilot phase at the time of the report [7]. The results of the pilot phase suggest
that blockchain technologies might have a disruptive effect on current providers in
the educational software market in the near future. As of recently, this disruption is
becoming the reality, as many educational institutions and services has moved online
due to the pandemic situation in 2020/21.
Based on [7], the following use cases for blockchain solutions can be named in
relation to education.
– Creation of digital certificates and credentials, as well as designing digital proofs
of authenticity for material certificates and printed credentials;
– Immutable storage of proofs of performance at examinations, including the related
metadata;
– Recognition of examination results between and within educational institutions
without the need for the central authority;
– Creating a personal “lifelong learning” record of achievements (a virtual CV) on
blockchain;
– Verification of authenticity of the certificates issued by third parties;
– Management of intellectual property, e.g. results of research in the context of
project implementation;
– Processing of payments, etc.
The demonstrator presented in this paper builds on Grech and Camilleri’s vision
of the rapidly approaching future regarding blockchain in education [7]. The aim of
the team of authors was to develop a serious game [16], complete with the option
for examination that transmits the results of the tests to all relevant persons (teachers
as well as students). This solution is designed to include all relevant metadata, such
Gallery Defender: Integration of Blockchain Technologies … 45
as the curriculum stored in the database, the issuing institution, selected personal
details of the examiner and examinee, etc. into transactions on blockchain.
The research that accompanies the demonstrator addresses the following research
question:
Which basic requirements are needed to use blockchain technologies not only for the veri-
fication of original documents by using a one-way hash, but to use blockchain directly with
assessment instruments in real-time environments, taking technological, social and commer-
cial factors into account?
2 Related Work
The last several years havebrought considerable development in the area of blockchain
research in the field of digital games, specifically in the field of education. However,
there is hardly any or even no publication on serious games in connection with
blockchain technologies. Below we look at the most notable working papers and
articles that deal with the subject of distributed ledgers and games in the ways that
can be applied to gamification of education.
A number of studies focuses on the design challenges of blockchain-based games.
Kraft [10] explores the problem of generating fair randomness in a deterministic,
multi-agent context (for instance, a decentralized game built on a blockchain). He
states that the existing state-of-the art approaches are either susceptible to manipu-
lation if the stakes are high enough or if they are not generally applicable. Therefore
he introduces a new approach based on game theory. Min et al. [15] discuss the
blockchain integration for games and then categorize existing blockchain games
from the aspects of their genres and technical platforms. In practice, Cai et al. [4]
develop two different prototypes to research the aspect of multi-chain as well as
multi-game approaches with the aim to create an interoperable blockchain gaming
framework. Lee et al. [12] examine the effects of speculative and enjoyable aspects
of users’ playing behavior in blockchain-based collectible games. As collectibles
require dedicated marketplaces to circulate, Chen [5] observe blockchain technol-
ogy as an innovative element of the virtual items trading platform. He concludes that
the biggest impact of blockchain technology in the short term is the redistribution
and integration of the game and trading platform market.
Gamification of education has a relatively small number of researched blockchain
cases. In one of the earliest relevant studies, Jirgensons and Kapenieks [8] com-
pare Blockcerts with Ethereum Smart Contracts developed by Open University, UK,
while Baldi et al. [3] describe how to impersonate a legitimate issuer of Blockcerts
certificates with the aim to produce certificates that cannot be distinguished from
originals by the Blockcerts validation procedure. Setting the groundwork for the
project presented in this paper, Pfeiffer and König [16] discuss the use of blockchain
technologies in educational games for assessment from a humanities perspective.
Komiya et al. [9] examine consensus algorithms as a reward system. They introduce
their approach “Proof-of-Achievement (PoA)” which is an algorithm optimized for
46 A. Thomas and A. Pfeiffer
blockchain games, focusing on the number of tasks achieved in the game. The aim of
using the PoA algorithm is to increase the motivation for playing blockchain-based
games. Similar to Komiya, Yuen et al. [20] also perceive consensus algorithms like
Proof of Work “PoW” as a bottleneck for games. Their proposal is called “Proof-of-
Play” with a focus on Peer-to-peer (P2P) Games. Agustin et al. [1] describe appli-
cation of blockchain technology in e-certificates in the open journal system. The
study reports that issuance of e-certificates in an open journal system is a way to
manage and verify, prevent duplication or even falsification of e-certificates and the
reputation of the open journal system is already given. This project is based on
Blockcerts by Learning Machine (originally developed at MIT). Finally, Aini et al.
[2] explore different approaches to gamification that embed blockchain technologies
in the educational sector.
3 The Context of the Demonstrator
To set up the demonstrator in the educational framework, we developed the educa-
tional game Gallery Defender on blockchain. This serious game replays the require-
ments of art history knowledge in the introductory college level Art History Curricu-
lum Framework:
The learning goal equals the game goal [6] and is defined in the following way.
All students, which equals the players of the game, will understand, analyze, and describe
art styles in their historical, social, and cultural contexts.
Gallery Defender is inspired by the game ARTé: Lumiere [19] already available
to students online. In our case, the new serious game introduces art concepts to the
player/learner at the first stage and assesses the acquired knowledge of them at the
following stage. The results are then transferred to the educational institution.
The game is a turn-based card game that consists of multiple levels. It develops
a simple narrative, according to which the player/learner is invited to take the role
of a gallery owner. Using their profound knowledge of art history, the player must
defend the artworks of the gallery from a masterful thief (Fig. 1).
Each level provides the player/learner with a deck of cards that carry images of
historical paintings on them. A small subset of the deck is dealt into the hands of
players at the start of each turn. Each card corresponds to the action, which is denoted
by a small icon; these actions include the attack icon, represented by a “race car”
icon, and defense actions, represented by the “headphones”, “helmet”, and “building”
icons. (These actions were chosen from existing icon assets that the authors already
owned, and the icons themselves are not related to learning outcomes.)
The player/learner plays against a simple AI who declares an action at the start
of each turn. There is exactly one painting in their hand that corresponds to the AI’s
declared action at any time, which must be correctly matched to the art movement
that it belongs to by dragging the card into one of several labeled buckets near the
bottom of the screen.

Fig. 1 Screenshot of gameplay in the first version of the game
After successfully matching some number of artworks (which vary by level),
the player/learner can move on to the next level. Incorrectly matching too many
artworks to art movements will result in failure of the level. Not all levels contain the
same number or types of art movements. Additionally, certain levels may allow the
player/learner to click on various buttons to gain more information about artworks,
art movements, and their previous moves. The Simulation and Assessment Levels
are based on the highest difficulty settings possible.
Following the classification of König [16], Gallery Defender is built on the Game
BasedLearning andAssessment framework. Thismeans that the content andmethods
are identical in both learning and assessment mode. However, these areas are strictly
separated from each other, and the user learns when they step from one sphere into
the other.
Gallery Defender utilizes blockchain technologies in three different ways.
The player/learner receives a digital token at the end of the assessment, which
contains the grade, points, and time that the assessment was finished as a mes-
sage. This token and the attached message are stored forever and unchangeably on
the blockchain in the player/learner’s Ardor Blockchain Wallet. The certificate is
encrypted and can only be decrypted by the sender and the original recipient. How-
ever, using a shared key enables the player/learner to share the results with third
parties, such as their future boss, their family or another school/university (Fig. 2).
The tokens used in the token system of the demonstrator are defined as utility
tokens, minted on the Ignis child chain of the Ardor Network. It is of utmost impor-
tance that the tokens cannot be traded or sent outside of the learning/assessment
environment to prevent speculative behavior [12].
In addition, the player/learner with particularly good results receives an additional
token. This token can be exchanged for digital rewards, e.g. a game poster, which

Fig. 3 The grade in the game (on the left) is translated into the exact amount in the blockchain
tokens (on the right)
Gallery Defender: Integration of Blockchain Technologies … 49
corresponds to the gamification principle realised on blockchain. This functionality
can be used to build an entire ecosystem for rewards on blockchain within the context
of education, as well as beyond this context.
Finally, the third type of a token is the verification token. Teachers can request this
token with further information about the respective test result. After the assessment
has been carried out, within a definable time the message is deleted, and only the
proof that the token has been sent remains immutable on blockchain (Fig. 3).
4 Methodology
Gallery Defender was created in three iteration steps. The first two iterations took
place on the testnet of the system, the third and last iterationwas then implemented on
the mainnet of the Ardor blockchain. These particular stages were evaluated by using
online questionnaires. These questionnaires were filled out at live events such as the
ConnectedLearningSummit, Irvine or the Future andReality ofGamingConference,
Vienna. Additional participants were recruited, and they received a hyperlink via e-
mail to test the demonstrator. The link could be requested using the contact address
on the research website of the project. The total number of participants on this survey
during the iterative design process was n = 105. The professional background of the
survey participants ranges from education and technical professions to people with
a background in sociology. This is the case due to the two specific events at which
the tests were conducted. A more detailed report on testing has been published [18].
In the first place, testing helped find bugs in the solution. Secondly, new features
were suggested by respondents, for example, on how to improve the gaming experi-
ence. The focus, however, was on the implementation of blockchain technologies to
validate test results from both the socio-economic and technical perspective. For this
purpose, open fields could be filled out and therefore both qualitative and quantita-
tive feedback was collected. This was evaluated using the methodology of qualitative
content analysis according to Mayring [14] and is discussed in the following section.
5 Results
The results of the content analysis as part of the iterative design process have led to
the following guidelines and recommendations.
Either a public blockchain or a combination of private/consortium blockchains
should be used in a setting that makes sense and does not limit the reasons why
blockchain itself is being used. For instance, in one proposed architecture, personal
data is stored using a private blockchain to ensure GDPR compliance. Other highly
sensitive data remains in the private area of the respective institution, but the private
blockchain sends the hash-value of each block-height to a public blockchain to reduce
the possible attack vector for manipulation.
50 A. Thomas and A. Pfeiffer
More attention should be paid on the performance of the used networks, regarding
number of possible transactions per specified timeframe. In our project, “non freely
tradeable utility tokens” are being used (as opposed to fungible and non-fungible
freely tradeable tokens). More specifically, the tokens cannot be re-transferred to
other users freely, but also, the issuer cannot withdraw them from the user either.
Transaction fees to the network are paid by the respective issuer(s) or operator(s)
of the token(s). Therefore the users themselves do not need to hold any “tradeable
networkmaintenance utility tokens”, or “cryptocurrencies”, nor do they need to know
about blockchain. For users the experience should equate to simply using an app.
More advanced users can always track their transactions using a public available
blockchain tracker or their very own node.
It is possible to encrypt the message associated with the token, so only the trans-
action itself is publicly visible, while the private information remains private and
only accessible to those parties who should have access to it (for the relevant period).
To achieve this shared-keys (or even sub-shared keys, making information avail-
able for a specific timeframe or for dedicated users) can be generated, and thus a
sharing system for third parties who get access to the information attached to the
token can be developed (but not the token itself as information bearer).
The message containing the core content, in certain cases where it makes sense,
can be deleted from the blockchain after some time (with the knowledge of the
partners involved). Only the proof of the transaction itself remains to reduce the
blockchain bloat.
Users can, if they want, always operate a full node and this with existing devices
such as their own modern smartphone, their own PC or with inexpensive hardware
such as a Raspberry Pi.
The Full Node can be operated without holding network maintenance tokens or
cryptocurrencies with the option to run a copy of the blockchain and look into it.
Holding “tradeable network maintenance utility tokens”, or “cryptocurrencies”
is only necessary if the users want to be part of the active network and conduct
mining/forging.
The availability of digital qualified signatures, or other secure forms of digital and
forgery-proof identity verification, like an advanced Self-Sovereign Identity System.
A blockchain wallet needs to be created, similar to well-known solutions like
the “Exodus Wallet”, which can hold different tokens, issued on various systems.
However, instead of holding “cryptocurrencies” this time it is a utility token as
information carrier.
Further education on the topic of blockchain is needed, if private individuals and
companies operate directly with private keys, generated when they open a respective
blockchain wallet.
Assuming that the time is not yet there in regards to trusting users to handle a
unique key that cannot be restored if lost, it can be defined that the private key itself
is only known to application utilizing blockchain to secure certain data, while setting
up a classic user and password system which starts the blockchain operations.
Finally, we strongly encourage the designers and adopters of such systems to
‘think green’: opt-in for solutions that are safe but environmentally friendly. This is
Gallery Defender: Integration of Blockchain Technologies … 51
especially important for use cases like storing educational data from a game, which
do not store monetary records. Therefore, we call for evaluation of a consensus
algorithm that fits best for the purpose intended.
6 Conclusion
From these key findings, the following questions can be identified,which researchers,
developers and users of systems and applications using blockchain technologies
should ask themselves.
– Is a private or public blockchain used?
– Which Blockchain or combination of blockchains systems is used?
– Can the information-carrying tokens be sent from one account to another without
this being originally intended?
– Is the private information of the token sufficiently encrypted? And if so, who has
the keys to access the data?
– Can (temporary) shared-keys be created that give access to (specific) information
for third parties?
– Is it possible for companies, universities and government institutions to operate
their own nodes in the network and thus have data sovereignty? If so, how much
effort and costs are involved?
– Is it even possible for users to run their own node? And if so, with what effort and
costs?
– Do the partners involved have to purchase cryptocurrencies? If so, for what pur-
poses and from which sources? And subsequently, do the users have to purchase
cryptocurrencies?
– Who pays the transaction fees to the network? Can the solutions be used that do
not charge transaction fees? If this is the case—which network was used and what
are the effects of using a transaction fee-free solution?
– Who creates the required blockchain wallets—partners of the respective project
or users themselves? Can this be done for them in an automated manner “through
the app”? If the latter, who and in what form has control over the private keys?
Although blockchain technologies are constantly evolving from a technological
perspective and a lot has been achieved since Grech and Camilleri’s report [7],
blockchain technologies have not yet arrived at the mainstream areas of application.
We could observe this during the content analysis stage of our research: those survey
participants who linked blockchain to speculative hype expressed critical opinions
on the topic. The second aspect that could be read out of the survey was that there
are many blockchain developers and scientists who are fixated on a specific system
and do not want to look at other systems or multi-chain solutions.
Therefore, there is still a lot of educational work to be done. One can hope that
in the next few years a lot of applied research will be conducted, which will also
reach the end users and thus communicate the topic hands-on. A very important
52 A. Thomas and A. Pfeiffer
finding of the project was also that the demonstrator and the testing together with the
proponents, which had little contact with the matter, the active testing helped them
to better understand blockchain, as they stated in the follow-up discussions.
7 Future Research
Three aspects will be addressed in the follow-up to the research project presented
above.
– Ethical integration of the blockchain solution with digital identity systems.
– Solutions for management of private or shared keys, so that the system is secure
but also understandable for its users.
– Further development of interfaces between different parts of the system, so that a
wallet can read information from different tokens, and the learning or assessment
software can transfer the results to different agents as it is appropriate for the user
or the institution.
