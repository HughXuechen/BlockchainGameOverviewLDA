       Abstract— The scarcity and exigency for blood and organs 
has created many discrepancies in current approaches. These 
have created the criteria for malpractices such as organ 
trafficking and black market selling. This research presents a 
solution with a secured-smart blood and organ donation web 
developed system, allowing both patients and healthcare 
providers to access information about the blood and organ 
processing records. The database would be managed using the 
Blockchain technology which could be only accessed by 
authorized users. Finally, tracking all registered donors, the 
proposed system generates a smart identity developed by 
Ethereum Smart Contract (ESC). System predicts blood 
demand for the future ten years using Linear Regression Model 
with 0.998 of high R-squared accuracy value. This reduces 
shortages and wastage of blood. Also, using global positioning 
system and K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning algorithm, 
the system finds the best matches among donors and seekers 
according to the nearest location. Further, the system will 
automatically send questionnaires for registered users to 
identify and evaluate their awareness and issues about organ 
donation. Overall, this study aims for a secured and transparent 
web application. Thus, it facilitates an innovative and a 
productive blood donation and organ transplantation process in 
Sri Lankan healthcare sector. 
       Keywords— Blockchain technology, K-Nearest Neighbor 
Algorithm, blood prediction, organ transplantation 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This paper introduces a good quality framework to cross 
over any barrier between the blood benefactors, the 
individuals deprived of, and keen on blood and organ 
donation. Blood donation is one of the most generous and 
critical commitments an individual can make to the society. It 
doesn't hurt a human to donate blood. The donor's body can 
recover blood within a few weeks. Sri Lanka is considered as 
one of the leading models to other regional developing 
countries which have achieved strides in the area of blood 
transfusion in the Asia region. At present, the blood print 
storage is managed by the National Transfusion Service, 
which is popularly known as the central blood bank. It is the 
sole supplier of blood and blood-related products to all 
government hospitals and most private sector hospitals. There 
are 101 hospital based blood banks and two independent blood 
centers affiliated with 19 cluster centers based on 
geographical distribution. The overall blood transfusion 
service in Sri Lanka has been recognized and rewarded several 
times[1]. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement and 
endeavoring for service excellence in areas of blood and organ 
donation management. 
‘LifeShare’ system is a web application through which 
registered users can check accessibility/availability of their 
blood requirement. As and when required, users can also send 
online requests for blood to the contributor, thus to coordinate 
with regard to blood necessity. Other than these, the proposed 
system automates the matching of blood groups through a 
special location tracking system that is integrated to an 
online/cloud platform. Currently, blood banks in some private 
hospitals do not have in place, such an advanced and 
integrated system, as such, it is expected to introduce the new 
online system for blood banks of Asiri Hospital, Lanka 
Hospitals, Durdans Hospital etc. Another point is that an 
effective organ transplant system in local healthcare sector is 
at an infant stage with drawbacks, and yet to be improved. 
Also, this research seeks to identify the level of 
awareness/knowledge, attitude, transparency and 
commitment among people by sending notifications to user’s 
account about special notices, system generated user friendly 
questionnaires and news updates. An additional feature is 
sharing of blood and organ requests in social media or via 
short message systems (SMS) to spread the message through 
the society. Finally using all these techniques, this proposed 
platform will provide a highly efficient and productive service 
to people. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW

research in terms of functionalities and areas/aspects. The 
main purpose of this project is to build a blood donation 
application that is user friendly and has the intelligence. In

doing so, it seeks out donations which will no longer be a 
matter of risk, thus free of worries. At the beginning of the 
project, some secondary resources supporting this study were 
researched. Accordingly, researchers gain insights on existing 
functions that helped identify the study framework and scope 
of work. 
Inventing a Tykn’s digital identity platform [2] suggests 
that the healthcare industry could easily and seamlessly be 
verified; this is via digital verifiable credentials issued by 
other organizations. A healthcare facility could trust the 
authenticity of a patient credential without even having to 
check the actual data contained therein. These privacy 
maintaining channels for identity management in blockchain-
based devices, would be assured through cryptography and 
zero-knowledge proofs. If the signature matches the one in 
patient’s credential, it’s considered as authentic. These 
findings may have been more applicable to ‘LifeShare system’ 
Smart ID which assists disconnected and duplicated patient 
information records, for widespread integration with a 
distributed master identity record. Additionally, users can 
create an identity profile where access is permitted only to 
authorized users. 
 By inventing the Veins Application, Perera suggests that 
location-based apps are effective in finding the nearest donor 
for a particular blood donation requirement. Developer 
Sachira Fernando (CEO of Inforgrid Holdings) and his team 
were the creators of this project [3]. Also, a similar project 
communication is important during an emergency. This 
project is an SMS-based blood donor management application 
launched by Dialog Axiata PLC in collaboration with the 
National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS), Sri Lanka. The 
objective of the project is to facilitate more donors to add to 
the national blood supply system, thereby assist the Sri 
Lankan public in an emergency. ‘SMS Blood’ enables mobile 
users to register as blood donors through SMS. To register for 
this service, the user must type BLOOD from his Dialog 
Mobile and send to 7777. Upon registering, users can access 
services provided by the NBTS using their Dialog mobile by 
dialing #770#; users can even locate the nearest blood 
donation center and view their donation history [4]. 
 Pacheco concludes that, he successfully developed a 
‘Characterizing Organ Donation Awareness’ from social 
media. Approximately 22 people die every day in the USA 
due to lack of organs for transplant. Research available to date 
suggests that the most effective solution is to increase organ 
donor rates from expanding the donor eligibility criteria 
(donor pool) to perform mass media campaigns. Hypothesis is 
that social media can be utilized as a sensor, to characterize 
organ donation awareness and population engagement when 
donating for each different organ. This paper aims at exploring 
the extent in which social media, such as Twitter, may be used 
to sense the population regarding organ donation awareness 
[6]. 
 Xiaochu reveals that the need for, and services of 
predicting blood supply and demand will be increasingly 
important in the next 20 years, with population ageing in 
China. As a result, this will increase demand for blood 
products, which may lead to severe disruption of blood supply 
and demand. This study aims to predict changes in blood 
supply and demand by 2035 in China [8]. It should be 
emphasized that this study would have been more reliable, if 
it had rare blood type predictions incorporated into the study, 
when compared to the proposed ‘LifeShare’ system. Various 
literature reviewed in this section along with the proposed 
system provide a reliable and secure system for any 
stakeholder who can also be a potential user. Especially, 
voluntary blood donors and organ donors feel more confident 
as they will now be in safe hands during the donation process. 
III. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
     Main objective of this research is to provide unique 
platform for both blood and organ donation management with 
advanced security features for the first time in Sri Lanka; 
also, to minimize death rates associated with organ donations. 
Secondary objectives are as follows; 
A. Blockchain-based tracking and generating a smart ID:  
      The blockchain technology could help to improve the 
process, by providing a more reliable and accurate data in 
blood and organ donation. This would secure the blood and 
organ donation process, while protecting sensitive patient and 
donor details [7]. The system provides access to identity 
management commands and stores hash representations of 
identity data. 
B. Automated blood group matching with location tracking 
system: 
       Automated blood group matching finds the best match 
blood donor by global positioning system (GPS) location 
service. Application is also geared to locate the best matches 
among the accessible donors with the assistance of 
automation algorithm.  
C. Predicting future blood supply and demand in Sri 
Lanka:  
      ‘LifeShare’ aims to supply blood uninterruptedly in 
immediate incidents through pre-stored storages. By 
predicting future blood supply and demand, blood shortage 
can be estimated in advance. Therefore, by predicting data 
models and statistics, storing extra blood bags of rare blood 
groups can be planned for future 10 years. 
D. Evaluating previous organ donation failures in Sri 
Lanka and finding solutions via features of the proposed 
system: 
      The current research seeks to identify the level of 
knowledge, attitude, transparency and commitment among 
people by updating special notices and news. Questionnaires 
are generated for five main solid organs such as kidney, 
lungs, liver, heart and pancreas. System analyzes responses 
for each questionnaire and thus, can support to improve the 
quality of service. 
IV. METHODOLOGY 
       High Level Architecture of overall research contains an 
unique web-based system which supports to both desktops 
and mobiles. Users are mainly donors, seekers and healthcare 
personals. Seekers may be either healthcare 
personals/officers or general seekers. The proposed system 
sets out the procedural approach of how to bridge the gap 
between the recipient, donor, and blood banks. This new 
application will provide a common ground for all three 
parties (i.e. recipient, donor, and blood banks) and thereby 
will ensure fulfillment of demand for blood requested by the

recipient and/or blood bank. The proposed system provides 
one of the best solutions for the Sri Lankan healthcare sector. 
 
 
Fig. 1. System Hardware Architecture diagram 
System Design: “LifeShare” system has developed for 4 
components as follows; 
A. Blockchain-based tracking and generating a ’Smart 
Identity. 
      For blockchain-based component process, the system 
generates a smart ID for donors and recipients after verifying 
data accuracy. Therefore, users can share their identity with 
main health organizations by linking their private key which 
can retain data non-identifiable to those without the key. The 
donor and recipient records can, be seen as in an integrated 
global database based on Blockchain technology, secured with 
cryptographic tools. Confidentiality and privacy can be 
ensured using encryption tools and techniques[7].  
      Smart ID uses the Ethereum blockchain model to represent 
an identity using a smart contract; attributes can be added by 
the identity owner and are stored in hash form. This is the 
Smart ID contract as used by the Smart ID instance. It 
describes core functionalities required as part of a Smart ID 
contracts with encryption keys, attributes and endorsements. 
A Smart ID is an ‘Ethereum smart contract’ (ESC) address. 
The ESC must be constructed using valid Smart ID bytecode. 
Smart ID enables disconnected and duplicated patients 
information records, to widespread integration with a 
distributed master identity record. Users are able to create an 
identity profile and allow trusted users, including institutions, 
to verify its authenticity. Users can then interact between one 
another directly, in safe mode knowing the authenticity of 
their counterparty. 
B. Automating blood group matching with the location 
tracking system. 
      According to the auto matching function, a person willing 
to become a blood donor has to perform all compulsory blood 
tests before donating blood. Then the user can obtain the 
medical eligibility details. After all, he must register and input 
required details into the system. If the person is found to be an 
eligible donor, personal details and eligibility details will be 
fed into the system database of eligible donors by healthcare 
personnel. An email and notification will automatically be 
sent to the user. Thereafter, the system will be able to track 
and locate the user whenever required.  
      Healthcare personnel send a query using the web 
application to find donors of the required blood group. The 
query provides two lists of all donors with the required blood 
group, together with a notification for those donors who have 
their tracking option on. One list includes details of the nearest 
donors with location. The other indicates details of non-
nearest donors. The GPS location service tracks location of 
donors. In doing so, it aims onwards find the best matches 
among the donors available with the help of automation 
method. In this method, blood factors of the person who needs 
blood, will be compared with those of all donors in the 
database. This system deploys of K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN) ML Algorithm to detect the best matched donors; this 
projects a unique feature unlike in other systems. App will 
filter only those people who are eligible to donate blood 
according to age and the last donated date. Remarkably, 
‘LifeShare tracking system’ is also equipped with the feature 
to track the blood donation history of a donor. It means that, if 
a person donates blood once, then he will not be shown in the 
map for the next three months. Such health and safety features 
are inbuilt to the system because it’s not healthy to donate 
blood more than once in three months.  
C. Predicting future blood supply and demand in Sri Lanka. 
       The system predicts future blood supply and demand 
volume in Sri Lankas’ hospitals. This is carried out 
considering the main three cases as Routine surgery cases, 
Emergency surgery cases and Road traffic surgery cases 
which usually occur on a daily basis in hospitals of Sri Lanka. 
Data sets that created contains linear regression model to 
predict the blood according to those cases. In statistics, linear 
regression models the relationship between a scalar response 
and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one 
explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For 
more than one explanatory variable, the process is called 
multiple linear regression. This study uses simple linear 
regression to predict blood volume. Then the model is 
deployed using flask with react JS. Also, react graphs show 
the predicted output graphically. Other than this, there are four 
types of blood loss classes in the medicine field. However, in 
this proposed system, the following average volumes are used 
for each class; Class 1- 650ml, Class 2 – 1,250ml, Class 3 – 
1,750ml, Class 4 – 2,500ml[8]. 
        First, the doctor should select the blood loss class. Then, 
concern is the number of patients for the given blood loss 
according to blood groups. In the next step, the doctor can 
save data and predict output for the given blood group or go 
forward and add the other blood loss class details as in the 
above scenario. Likewise, the doctor can add details of all 
patients according to each blood loss class separately. Finally, 
the total blood volume requirement for patients according to 
blood groups can be predicted.    
D. Evaluating previous organ donation failures in Sri 
Lanka and finding solutions via the system. 
       As the public interest for organ donation is relatively low, 
once developed this system can help improve the attitude of 
people towards organ donation. By updating special notices 
and news, research seeks to gain insights in identifying the 
level of knowledge, attitude, transparency and the extent of 
commitment among people. System generates a list of donors 
separately, about those who are eligible to donate each organ

by using ML with python language. Apart from this, daily 
organ prediction was carried out using ML model using flask. 
This study uses introducing of special features, integrating the 
same into an online platform. Another special feature is 
sharing of requests regarding blood and organs in social media 
or via SMS, to spread the message through the society. 
Analyzing responses of questionnaire can help acquire 
knowledge and perception/attitude on donating of blood and 
organs. By the way of Artificial intelligence (AI), special 
notices and notifications can be sent to users; these includes 
information, circulars and rules about donating blood and 
organs.  
E. Dataset in detail 
      This community-based cross-sectional study was 
conducted among 250 people living in various districts 
throughout Sri Lanka. Accordingly, system analysis was 
carried out using pre-tested questionnaires, which included 
details on blood and organ donation.  system was predicted the 
daily blood volume for the hospitals using the dataset that 
contains 1000 tuples of data in different hospitals around Sri 
Lanka. In the dataset we collected number of routine surgery 
cases, Emergency surgery cases, road traffic accident cases as 
independent variables and total blood volume as dependent 
variables according to the relevant hospital name. Thereafter, 
those data were imputed into linear regression algorithm 
considering dependent and independent variables. 
F. Tools and Technologies 
      React JS technology has been deployed to develop user 
interfaces and Node JS, Java for back end functions. Visual 
Studio Code, IntelliJ and Sublime text are tools for React JS, 
Node JS and Java function implementations. MySQL 
workbench and XAMPP used for database connection. 
Algorithms have been created in python language, by using 
PyCharm.   
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
     The blockchain technology enabled to improve the blood 
and organ donation process by providing more reliable and 
accurate data, while protecting sensitive patient and donor 
details. Followed by verifying data accuracy, the system 
generates a smart ID for donors. Donors and seekers can share 
their identity with main health organizations by linking their 
private key, which can remain data non-identifiable to those 
without the key. Users can then interact between one another 
directly and safely, knowing the authenticity of their 
counterparty. The threat of fake identities as well as hacking 
are unlikely and impossible in blockchain technology.  
 
 
Fig. 2. Screenshot of Smart contract created for smart Id 
 
      As mentioned under Section IV-A, a smart ID is an ESC 
address. Above Fig.2 smart contract was programmed by 
solidity; it connects with the front-end which has given an 
output as a smart ID with a hash value.  The smart contract 
was be constructed using valid Smart ID bytecode. System 
provides access to identity management commands and stores 
hash representations of identity data. A unique smart ID 
number has been generated for all registered blood and organ 
donors throughout the registered period in the system. System 
updates details of blood and organ requests.  
 
Fig. 3. Blockchain flow diagram 
      Furthermore, blood donors, organ donors, recipients and 
normal users have separate account logins. In the meantime, 
the blockchain process is ongoing through the administration 
panel by connecting/linking all accounts. Finally, all 
information analyzed as well as database are stored as blocks 
in the blockchain. 
1. Matching results between donors and seekers: 
      Database includes two tables called donors and seekers. In 
the matching process, text fields will be filled by using 
seeker’s details and submitted. Then, seeker’s record will be 
added into the system (seeker’s table). Thereafter, the system 
will check the matched donors and display these results. These 
two processes are set to the same onclick method through the 
submit button. Whenever, a blood donor is required, 
healthcare personnel can access the system to locate and 
contact the nearest blood donor, much quickly and easily. 
2. Eligibility checking results of donors according to 
time:  
     Time taken to find a donor through the system by 
comparing the current process and proposed process is 
different. As in the proposed system, automated blood group 
matching finds the best match blood donor by GPS location 
service. Application is also geared to locate the best matches 
among the accessible donors with the assistance of automation 
algorithm. So, it will take a minimum time period as about 5 
seconds to find donors. Other current system processes take 
that minimum time period as above 60 seconds. It has proven 
by our accuracy test. So, the process proposed is effective than 
the existing processes.

3. Location tracking results of donors, hospital, blood 
banks and centers:  
     This locating function is directly connected to donors’ 
details in the donor table. Here, a column named location 
includes buttons for each row, and for each donor. When a 
user click one of these buttons/donors, the system opens the 
map and shows location of that particular donor. Then the 
seekers can search near-by donors by their own mobile 
devices. Nevertheless, at this level, seekers will not have 
access to personal addresses of donors due to privacy issues. 
Instead, seekers can contact the hospital, blood bank or center 
to which the donor belongs. 
 
Fig.4. The donor auto matching and tracking process. 
 
      Once values are inserted, users in the healthcare sector 
can predict the daily total blood volume according to those 
number of cases as follows. Then daily total blood volumes 
are multiplied from the international blood group distributing 
percentages. This way, much reliable and accurate blood 
volume forecasts/predictions for all blood groups can be 
obtained. R-squared value should be between 0.5 and 1. 
According to our research following Fig.5, output was 0.998 
R-squared value which gave a high Model Accuracy 
(according to the values given by the user for respective 
cases). 
 
 
Fig.5. Daily blood volume prediction 
 
      By using this component, the blood bank can predict the 
total blood volume for the respective hospital easily than it 
used to be. Emergency prediction using blood loss class is a 
function that depends on emergency incidents in hospitals. 
Once the user analyzes these details of charts and graphs, they 
can obtain a clear idea about blood volume needs for patients 
under emergency cases. Thereafter, based on these data, 
healthcare users can place orders for blood through the 
hospital blood bank unit for patients, easily and speedily. 
 
 
Fig.6. Emergency Blood volume prediction. 
 
      By developing this web-based application system, it will 
assist to improve attitude/perception, transparency and 
knowledge of people towards organ donation. By sharing 
blood and organ requests in social media or via SMS, it 
spread the message through the society. Further, the system 
will automatically generate and send simple and user-friendly 
questionnaires for each solid organ (hence for five organs) for 
registered people. Purpose is to evaluate their knowledge, 
issues, failures and likeliness about organ donation. System 
analyzes responses of questionnaires, therefore, can guide to 
make improvements to the process of organ donation. Thus, 
it contributes towards reducing death rates and minimizing 
organ donation failures. This system generates a list of organ 
donors who are registered for donation of organs. 
Additionally, this generates a separate list of donors who are 
eligible to donate organs for five solid organs like kidney, 
lungs, liver, heart and pancreas.

      According to the researched data set, system generates the 
percentage of organs people who are waiting for a donation. 
Out of all donors, 80% were aware of organ donation. Among 
these participants, awareness was highest in the age group 
18–30 years 98.8%, male 57.1%, and female 42.9%. 
 
  
Fig.8. Contribution of people to organ donation 
 
      Above Fig.8. shows the percentage of people as to how 
they contributed to organ donation. Sources of awareness 
about organ donation was primarily through media (80%). 
Most of the participants (67%) felt that the purpose of organ 
donation was to save life. Most of the participants (91%) 
responded that all healthy adults are eligible organ donors 
whereas 87% of the participants were of the view that 
monetary benefits could not be accepted for organ donation. 
Most participants (70%) were willing to donate their organs 
after death. Among the participants who refused to donate 
their organs, family refusal (42%) was cited as the most 
common reason. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
       No one should die from lack of blood or organs. To date 
there is no artificial replacement for blood and human organs. 
As soon as the product is for placement to a live environment, 
since this was a considerable problem among donors and 
recipients in this system can play a major role of progressing 
blood and organ donation. Specially there wasn’t specific 
systems to focusing on advanced features as the system 
facilitated by the blockchain technology and location 
tracking. An exclusive feature of this ‘Lifeshare’ application 
was it can share within any blood bank connects through the 
general hospitals as well as for private hospitals by including 
their relevant databases. That was fruitful in changing 
discrepancies and malpractices in existing procedures, to a 
system that is user friendly, secure and intelligent. At present, 
no specific systems are in place in the Sri Lankan healthcare 
sector, to map blood groups volumes required and location 
tracking. This study also shows that a high level of awareness 
exists about organ donation among people and most 
participants are willing to donate their organs. As such, the 
‘LifeShare’ system provides a unique platform for a 
productive blood and organ donation management. With 
advanced security features such as minimizing the risk of 
organ trafficking, “LifeShare’ system is a breakthrough in Sri 
Lanka’s healthcare sector. Imagine a country where no 
person needs to die with a shortage of blood and organs.
