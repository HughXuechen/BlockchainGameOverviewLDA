Abstract
The prominent achievement of blockchain technology stimulates exceptional
innovation. The major component of blockchain is the consensus mechanism.
The standard consensus mechanisms specifically Proof-of-Work (PoW) rely on
mining procedures and stake-based mechanisms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
rely on massive stake investment as the sole criteria for selection of leader nodes.
However, PoW impose huge computational power requirements and latter may
incorporate malicious nodes as leader nodes in anonymous blockchain. These
issues might fuel the way for distrust among the participants in blockchain.
Henceforth, a novel game theory based reliable PoS mechanism for blockchain
has been proposed. Federated learning has been used to compute trust_score
for each node. The nodes are trained on locally generated dataset. Further, a
game theoretic approach has been proposed that uses a reward and punish-
ment scheme to ensure threshold level of trust_score maintenance by each node.
Finally, a crop insurance use case has been developed with the consensus mecha-
nism and blockchain coded in python. The insurance claims are made to operate
through smart contract based mobile app system to impart more authenticity.
The system is tested and results show an intrusion accomplishment rate reduced
by approximate 40% when compared to the standard PoS mechanism and by
approximately 33% for algorand, 29% for ouroboros and 20% for tendermint. The
mean absolute error also decreases by 30% within specific time. Furthermore,
the proposed federated learning-based system is compared with basic neural
network-based machine learning model and the results reveal that a significant
reduction in average training time amounting to 8.35 second is achieved. Test
accuracy has also been analyzed for various learning mechanisms.

the existing processes for improvisation. Blockchain is one such technology with huge potential for application in wider
domain.
Blockchain is characterized by features of distributed shared ledger and database with the inclusion of attributes
like transparency, traceability, decentralization, and immutability.1 The distributed ledger can only be altered by
consensus mechanism mutually agreed upon by all participants.2,3 Some major consensus mechanisms are PoW
(Proof-of-Work), PoS (Proof-of-Stake), DPoS (delegated PoS), PBFT (practical byzantine fault tolerance). The blockchain
finds its applications in diverse fields including finance and Internet of Things (IoT) owing to its prodigious fea-
tures. With the inclusion of smart contracts, the application domain of blockchain is extended from cryptocur-
rency to nonfinancial applications.4,5 The smart contracts state the terms of contract with self-executing line of
code and are recorded over the distributed ledger.6 Likewise, numerous use cases of blockchain technology in
agriculture domain have been presented.7 Evidently, the agriculture production systems have been benefited by
the inclusion of technologies like IoT, machine learning and blockchain in several operations of agriculture like
food supply chain management, smart irrigation practices, yield monitoring, forecasting and harvest prediction and
so forth.8,9
Simultaneously, blockchain also finds remarkable applicability in financial sector as well. Crop insurance is one such
crucial financial area which aids to support the agriculture finances but is not studied and researched. Thus, it is dis-
cussed in this research work. While, technology enthusiasts have endured to succor the farmers in optimizing the yield
production for their income proliferation, weather-based disasters might be responsible for influencing the farmer’s
income. Thus, to uplift the farmers’ financial status crop insurance is encouraged among them. Crop insurance enables
the farmers to repay their loans and simultaneously bear the natural as well as man-made calamities.10 The process of
insurance includes multiple organizations and individuals. The insurer offers risk protection to the insured individual
who is a policyholder. Likewise, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna is an insurance scheme presented with a purpose
to provide financial aid to Indian farmers. It aims to provide the risk coverage and insurance coverage to the eligible
farmers.11
The process of crop insurance needs to include more outstanding features like transparency, trackability and security
to offer trust and reliability among the farmers. Evidently, blockchain technology finds its apposite role in the offering
insurance services to users. Blockchain based insurance system offers more transparency, real time traceability into the
insurance services.12
However, one major issue of concern with crop insurance is the intrinsic and extrinsic risks associated with the insur-
ance sector and the need for extended security features in technology. The insurance providers collect and store huge
volumes of personal data from users which is frequently transferred over the networks. The networks might be prone to
perilous cyber-attacks. This makes it necessary to have an insurance system which comprises highly advanced security
and privacy features for end users.13
The information stored in a blockchain governed by conventional consensus mechanisms might be prone to attacks
and the personal identifiable information might be vulnerable to unethical access.14 Thus, more enhanced consensus
mechanism is required for blockchain.
1.1 Analysis of mainstream consensus algorithms
The mainstream consensus algorithms offer various anticipated properties which are crucial for the effi-
cient working of blockchain procedure. Various conventional consensus mechanisms are analyzed as shown
in Table 1.
PoW is a splendorous algorithm for offering the decentralization and security in the blockchain. It prevents vari-
ous glitches from entering the network like double spending.15-17 But PoW is inefficacious in providing the efficient
resource usage. Huge resource consumption at the end of miners is the concern that drive the way for another consensus
mechanisms.
Thus, PoS is the breakthrough in this concern. The PoS protocol was developed with the objective of eliminating the
need for high energy and computational powers requirements in PoW.18 In PoS, nodes referred to as validators initially
have to deposit a stake which is in point of fact a number of coins. Likewise, DPoS19-21 was developed to offer higher energy
efficiency. However, DPoS is still in its inception stage. Thus, this research work proposes to extend the functionality
of PoS.

1.2 Motivation
Although the PoS holds huge capability to offer vast applicability, yet it has its own vulnerabilities which are as follows:
• Low-cost attacks: The PoS based blockchain networks are more susceptible to attacks by the imposter validator node
with the coveted idea of grabbing rewards on top. It might cost insignificantly low to the malicious node or even zero
cost by creating and managing fake stakes.22 The attacker node can just fill the spurious data in the RAM or the disk of
the victim node to breakdown the network to create fake stakes. The attacker node will be successful in depleting the
resources of outstanding validator nodes, thereby eliminating the opportunities for any other node to win the rewards
and populate the blockchain with erroneous blocks.
• Anonymity of validator nodes: Although, anonymity is the upshot of blockchain networks, yet it can prove to be ruinous
in case of validator nodes for PoS consensus protocol. The parties involved in transaction might be reluctant to share
the personal information to any third party. Anonymity of users’ identity is the way out to alleviate the chances of users’
personal information from being stolen by the trickery nodes present in the network. There may be the malicious nodes
which may be at ease of losing few stakes in the possibility of earning greater profits.23
• Trust-less environment: The blockchain environment is characterized by skeptical situation where every node is dis-
trustful of the other node. The PoS algorithm allows to choose the next block validator cogitating the stakes owned by
the respected nodes which might call for malicious activities in the network by awe less validator nodes. Thus, it would
be more preferred, if at the time of selecting the new block, the other validating nodes are aware the trustworthiness
of the node originated the transaction. Every node should reflect its trust score to enable other validating nodes while
voting for the new block. A trust evaluation model will help scale down the detrimental activities from mischievous
nodes in a network24 .
The PoS consensus mechanism with some alterations toward improving the security ought to be the most apt choice
for the blockchain based system for insurance sector. Besides, the insurance system requires a completely digital system
with enhanced security features as it is more prone to external attacks. Thus, the presented research work proposes a
novel PoS consensus algorithm combined with the federated learning for trust management among validator nodes to
be used in crop insurance system based on blockchain. The behavior of validator nodes is modeled using game theory to
maintain threshold level performance which retains the overall performance of the system.
2 LITERATURE SURVEY
Blockchain has been successfully able to gather engrossment equally from industry as well as academia. It finds numerous
applications varying from cryptocurrency, internet of things, financial services to providing a secure and traceable solution
to public services.25
The robust features of distributed ledger make it a secure and credible system operating in the absence of any cen-
tralized authority.26 The Figure 1 shows the basic architecture of blockchain with different nodes in network generating

block consisting of transactions.27 A block is added to the blockchain only after it is successfully verified by all partici-
pants under the requirements of consensus mechanism.28 Consensus mechanism is one of the significant components of
blockchain.
2.1 Research trends in consensus mechanisms
The consensus algorithm is a mutual process which makes process of agreed decision making exist in decen-
tralized network. Blockchain members use consensus mechanisms to verify the validity of transactions. The con-
sensus algorithm is followed by every node in blockchain network to authenticate the data to be appended to
blockchain.29
An exhaustive survey of major primitive consensus mechanisms and their related terminologies is presented in Ref-
erence 30. Conclusive analysis about the diverse consensus mechanisms is presented which reflect its significance for
the future envisions in remarkable development in blockchain. The general consensus mechanisms such as PoW avoids
the conflict among participating mining nodes through the computing capability priority order. Whereas the PoS con-
sider the only the amount of stake in electing the node for block creation and validation.31 Apart from the conventional
consensus mechanisms some research works such as Reference 32 have shown interest to present reputation-based
consensus mechanism for permissionless blockchain. Authors in Reference 33 have present a novel proof-of-activity con-
sensus mechanism by integrating the conventional PoW and PoW consensus mechanism for refining certain parameters
including cost but the inherent nature of PoW prevents it from energy efficiency improvement. Likewise, the proposed
research work also presents a novel consensus mechanism but by extending the existing consensus mechanism that
is, PoS.

F I G U R E 2 Conceptual overview of proposed system
The related work to present and augment PoS mechanism are discussed as it forms relevant part for the pro-
posed consensus mechanism. Some researchers have been keen to explore the applications of PoS in diverse fields.
In Reference 34, PoS public blockchain is used to evaluate the pricing scheme for the P2P energy trading mar-
ket. Furthermore, PoS is expanded to handle IoT data streams in Reference 35. Authors in Reference 36 improves
PoS consensus mechanism by considering security challenges but does not monitor the constant performance of the
system nodes.
While some research works are focussed to enhance the PoS mechanism for removing some of its flaws. The authors
in Reference 37 extends the standard PoS mechanism by integrating with identity for channelizing in trustless systems
based on reputation. While Reference 38 presents an architecture for general staking based on novel data structure for
multiple components of the system.
The proposed research work also proceeds with the basic objective of extending PoS mechanism for inclusion of
trust-based factor for enhancing the security of the overall consensus mechanism. Figure 2 shows the conceptual overview
of the proposed research work. The consensus mechanism can be improved with some machine learning mechanism.
Thus, various learning paradigms have been studied in consequent sections.
2.2 PoS based mechanisms
2.2.1 Tendermint
The tendermint consensus protocol39 uses BFT (byzantine fault tolerance) and PoS for block creation and confirmation.
Similar to PoS, the validator nodes make deposit to get the voting rights. The final block proposing node is selected by
voting and procedure including deterministic round robin voting in each communication round. The tendermint pro-
tocol is considered to be quit secure consensus but with the assumption of 2/3 participants of network being honest.
The major applications of tendermint are the BigchainDB (https://www.bigchaindb.com)40 and Ethermint41 (https://
ethermint.zone).
2.2.2 Ouroboros
The ouroboros consensus42 mechanism is a PoS based protocol. It selects a dynamic committee based on the net stake
owned. The time is divided into epochs. The committee members in each epoch undergo the procedure for 3-phased coin
tossing protocol and initiate the FTS (follow the Satoshi) algorithm which further helps in leader node selection. The
FTS algorithm takes a string as input and provides a token index as the output. This token index address is chosen as the
validator node for block selection.

2.2.3 Algorand
The algorand consensus43 also selects a dynamic committee based on net stake owned. It uses verifiable random function
(VRF) as cryptographic sortition algorithm for leader node selection. The VRF takes private key of a node and a string
as input to present a hash and a public verification proof as output. The hash is matched with the hash value range of
each participating node. The matching node becomes the leader node. The hash value for each node is proportional to
the stake amount owned. The VRF does not allow the leader node to be revealed before it submits the proof. The detailed
comparison of these technologies with the proposed consensus is depicted in Table 2.
2.2.4 Chains-of-activity
Chains-of-activity consensus protocol,33 again uses FTS algorithm to choose the validation leader node. Here, the FTS
algorithm uses different input. The chain is divided into equal parts of length l and the time into epochs. In each epoch,
blocks of each part participate. The hash of each block in an epoch is combined to find the leader node for next epoch.
The malicious behavior of the node is continuously supervised and in case found guilty, the deposit of that node will be
confiscated.
2.3 Different learning mechanisms
2.3.1 Centralized machine learning classifier
Centralized machine learning requires a central server where the learning nodes are connected. The participating learning
nodes, regularly upload their own local data to the centralized cloud server. The centralized server performs the complex
computation and finally present the outcomes for test data making it computationally efficient for participant nodes.
However, the data being used for learning purpose may be the personally identifiable data such as the health data records,
location data, payment related details and many more. It could lead to data security issues like eavesdropping. Further,
it may lead to other issues like the uploading of high range of data could lead to high communication overhead thereby
leading to high latency in the network.44
2.3.2 Distributed machine learning classifier
Distributed machine learning is designed to eliminate the need for moving the real time data to a central server. In
distributed learning, the participant learning nodes train their models independently and send their model updates on
central server at regular intervals. At central server, convergence testing is performed after certain decided rounds of com-
munication for providing the average output for each node. It helps to train and test large scale dataset and provide a
scalable solution for learning classification model.45
2.3.3 Federated learning
The concern for enhancing the privacy and security of end user’s personal data has led to the evolution of a novel learning
mechanism which is termed as federated learning. The federated learning mechanism is based on a concerted deep learn-
ing framework which enables all the engaged devices to participate in training process while safekeeping their data on
their local devices and regularly update the learning model by passing only the required meta data. Federated learning has
been introduced by google in leu of preserving the security of user’s data. The google authorities suggested that a global
training model can be initiated on a central server which will be downloaded on individual devices. It will be trained iter-
atively using the local data of devices. The global model will be updated iteratively and consequently trained. The final
model is again distributed to devices to get inference related results.46The difference between distributed learning and
federated learning is that in federated learning training is initialized on local epochs.

2.4 Federated learning in blockchain
The security enhancement in standard consensus mechanisms is crucial to be used in financial sectors as the data
security and privacy are quite imperative in financial applications. But data might be crucial for performing some
data analysis and prediction. In the customary systems data collected at the edge nodes is transferred to the cen-
tralized server where the data is fed into the analysis algorithms and is shared by some team of data scientists.
Federated learning enhances data security and privacy as it eliminates the need of uploading private data. Research
communities have shown keen interests to study the exclusive characteristics and research potential of federated
learning.47,48
Although the review study works49,50 reveal the idea of convergence of blockchain with AI. Authors explore the pos-
sibility of using blockchain to do away the key challenges associated with AI. Similarly, Reference 51 have presented
a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, WekaCoin based on distributed learning consensus. The distributed learning consensus
channelizes machine learning based system ranking. In the same lines researchers have tried to integrate the robust fea-
tures of federated learning with blockchain. In Reference 52, authors had presented a blockchain integrated federated
learning implementation for improving the collaboration among the mobile edge devices while reducing the communica-
tion overhead. This association between two technologies is used in numerous applications as discussed in Reference 53.
The authors proposed a new design as FLchain. Various issues concerning the FLchain design are explored such as com-
munication cost, decentralization, privacy protection, and resource allocation. The incessant research and development
in federated learning is the major driving factor for adopting federated learning in integration with blockchain. Likewise,
a blockchain based federated learning architecture is presented in Reference 54 which offers the opportunity to exchange
as well as verify the local learning models.
2.5 Game theory and blockchain
The presented research work also proposes to ensure the consistent performance through the mathematical model
of game theory. Game theory is a mathematical concept that deals with the analysis of interaction among rational
decision-making entities. The entities involved in decision making process acts as game players and tend to maximize
their payoff also termed as utility, in view of the other players’ strategies. Game theory is mathematical model to reach a
consensus in case of conflict in decision making.55,56 Game players choose the moves to reach decisive “win” and “loose”
outcomes. Game theoretic model is grouped in two major categories: cooperative and noncooperative approaches. In
cooperative games, the game players choose their strategies collectively after agreement among each other for the benefit
of the system as a whole. It assumes that the game players adopt collective strategies as a group called as coalition and
work cooperatively for decision making.57 Whereas in noncooperative game theory, game players choose their strategies
individually to maximize their own payoff. The players compete with each other being indifferent toward benefit or loss
of others.58
The game theory was originally developed with the objective of assisting and analyzing the economic conduct of busi-
ness firms, markets as well as individual consumers. In business economics,59 game theory provides set of mathematical
tools for predicting and analyzing the decisions of rivals for the firm managers. Also, it assists in strategic negotiation for
the economic competition.60
In the recent years researchers have even tried to establish a gaining relation between the blockchain and the game
theory. The main objective is to devise a blockchain network with the human behavior modeling for the greater bene-
fit of the blockchain network. In the same context game theory has been used to enhance the security of the blockchain
by preventing various security attacks such as selfish mining, majority attack.61 The authors in Reference 62 have
presented a novel system for secure information sharing leveraging the blockchain technology integrated with game the-
oretic approaches. Similarly, a game theoretic approach for calculating the reward in bitcoin mining is introduced in
Reference 63 for encouraging the honest participation among blockchain nodes.
2.6 Novel contribution to literature
Many research works that have been surveys the existing consensus mechanisms and some researchers have been keen
to channelize the blockchain based solutions in specific applications. Although the credibility of the blockchain can be

assured with the numerous variants of the blockchain but to a certain extent the security factor in anonymous blockchain
environment cannot be resolved well. In these solutions, the security of the system depends on the assumption of majority
participation of honest nodes. Thus, the proposed research work presents a novel game theory based reliable PoS consen-
sus mechanism. It aids to add more security automatically to existing PoS consensus with the help of federated learning
by considering the behavior of the nodes. Along with adding more security to system, the proposed system also ensures
the constant expected good behavior of the system through game theory without the intervenes of any third party. The
proposed consensus based blockchain is used for crop insurance application for imparting the much-needed superfluous
security to the system.
3 PROPOSED RELIABLE POS CONSENSUS MECHANISM
In the light of issues discussed with PoS consensus algorithm, the proposed research work suggests to extend the PoS
consensus algorithm with trust maintenance of validator nodes. Customarily, the trust maintenance mechanism can
salvage the services of a third-party managing database services but it could lead to breach of security over the anonymity
of nodes. Thus, before adding the new validator nodes, it has to undergo the trust_score calculation procedure using
federated learning while preserving anonymity of nodes.
3.1 Trust score computation
The conventional PoS consensus process is revised to integrate trust_score for each node along with net stake worth in
decision making while voting procedure. The Figure 3 shows the architecture for trust_score calculation. Node ni which
wants the access to the network as validator node will proceed with Algorithm 1 for trust score calculation.

The aspiring validator node has to submit the validator fee. They are required to submit certain number of coins as
their stake in the network. The magnitude of stake will decide their chances to be selected as the next block forging node.
The participant has to simultaneously register at the cloud server which will help in updating the global model
variables. It stands clear that every node accesses cloud for model downloading where global model will be updated
and sent back to the nodes. The neural network is used to predict the values of output variable. The central server
is programmed to select the subset of participants as they have to perform local model training tasks. It initiates a
neural network based global model 𝜔0 to each participant. Every node, ni which registers at server, is required to main-
tain a dataset. For initial period of 10 days, data about node is collected by the interface. During this time period, the
node ni can only approve or disapprove the block initiated by some other leader node. The dataset collected contains
T, 𝛿, 𝜎1.
The data is collected in time series format. The parameters X = [T, 𝛿, 𝜎1] will serve as the input parameters and the 𝜎2
is the parameter to be predicted for node ni using the neural network-based training model. The Y= 𝜎2 will serve as the
next block approval (NBA) probability for node ni as depicted in Equation 1. These variables are collected and maintained
locally in specific node with the help of local records.
Y ← f (X)
After the dataset collection phase is over, the training nodes selected will perform data analysis and then it gets added
to the dataset values. To obtain an accurate next block approval probability, the local nodes will train the global model
by using its own dataset which is being updated after every 10 days. The nodes work collaboratively to train the ini-
tialized global model which gets updated iteratively every fixed time period using Equation (2). The node ni𝜀N where
N = {n1,n2, … ,nn} with n number of participants in the network. The global model is updated iteratively by each
single node. Every participating node uploads the local model over the centralized server which is averaged into a

global updated model using federated averaging algorithm. The server uses the trained weights of generic neural net-
work model to calculate the average of all these values and finally present the network with global neural network
model.
Using the updated global model computed with the use of Equation (3), value of NBA will be calculated for each node
and sent to the blockchain. For every node ni, server will use the associated NBA value to find out the trust_score for
node ni using the Equation (4). Where TS is the trust_score, 𝛾 is aging parameter. We try to link more weight to older
nodes. If TS> t1 then node ni gets access to the network as validator node. The system will verify if TS> t2 only then
in future the particular node ni will be eligible to be selected as the leader node. The values of t1 and t2 depend on the
system.
Meanwhile, every node in network broadcast the received transactions in the network. When ample number of trans-
actions are collected, the nodes select the leader node based on the trust_score, which initiates the block creation. Every
other node in network validates the block after authenticating the block. Every transaction in the block is executed and
it is added to the blockchain. The leader node is rewarded for adding this block to blockchain.
3.2 Integrating game theory in proposed PoS
A Game theoretic model is used to include self-sufficiency in the system to maintain a level of threshold trust score
value for each participating node. The responsibility of maintaining the threshold value of trust score remains with the
validation leader node selected in previous step. The different roles in proposed game theory model are:
a Validation leader: It creates, proposes and broadcasts to the network. It will be responsible to adjust the calculation
metrics of trust score in certain cases where it seems right otherwise use the value calculated of trust score in previous
step.
b Validators: It is responsible for validating the newly proposed block.
The validator node might attain a level of threshold just to enter the network with the objective of performing malicious
activities and not maintain the required level of performance. It might lower the value of trust score after entering the
network. Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the validation leader to maintain the optimum performance of the system.
The validation leader will be rewarded for performing such task with efficiency. But it might also be punished for doing
its duty.
Following are the players in the game:
Player 1 (P[x]): All validator nodes.
Player 2 (P[y]): Validation leader node.
Playing strategies:
It includes the set of actions defined for each specific category of players in the game theory. All the notations required
for game theory model are mentioned in Table 3.
P(x): 1. It will try to maintain the specified threshold level of trust score This move is denoted by C.
2. It will not maintain the specified threshold level of trust score. This move is denoted by D.

P(y): 1. It will use default trust score calculated. This move is denoted by M.
Y It will make the rules to calculate the trust score stricter (in order to make process more difficult). It will increase the
threshold t2. It is denoted by N.
The expected payoff for player(y) for playing N is:
Exp(N) =
[
p.
{(
Py −m
)
− Ey
}
+ (1 − p)
(
−Ey −m
)]
. (5)
The expected payoff for player(y) for playing M is:
Exp(M) =
{
p.Ry + (1 − p).m
}
. (6)
So, player P(y) plays N (use strict rules) if
Exp(N) > Exp(M)
or
p >
Ey
Py − Ry −m
. (7)
Likewise, the expected payoffs for player P(x) are calculated.
Exp(D) =
[
(q.Rx − Ex) + {(1 − q).Px − Ex}
]
(8)
and
Exp(C) = 0. (9)
So, player P(x) plays “D” if
Ex(D) > Ex(C)
or
q > 2.Ex − Px
Rx − Px
. (10)
Table 4 shows the strategic form of the given game theory model. Equilibrium can be achieved with Equation (7). The
game matrix for different possible situations is represented in Table 5. If the player P(y) maintains a probability of playing
“N” at the specified level indicated in Equation (7), then the other player P(x) has no incentive to deviate from its strategy.
Similarly, if the player P(x) maintains the probability of playing “D” then other player P(y) has no incentive of deviating
from its current strategy. Thus, P(y) will be punished in case the player P(x) is successful in making move “D” without
being encountered.
4 USE CASE: CROP INSURANCE
The main objective of current research work to deploy the above-mentioned consensus mechanism to reduce the current
flaws of the financial systems like crop insurance for the social security of the farmers. The process of crop insurance can
be made more automated, transparent and secure by channelizing federated learning based- blockchain in the crop insur-
ance system. We propose a smart contract approach for registration of farmers, crop insurance and smart contract-based

authentication of insurance claims which leads to automatic claim redemption. The process of crop insurance is discussed
in reference to following parameters:
4.1 Stakeholders
A. Federal government: The role of government is crucial in paying a major portion of the premium for crop insur-
ance according to the standard criteria set under insurance scheme. The government authorities initiate and deploy
the smart contract for insurance of crops which save the assorted variables linked with insurance like the premium
balance, claim history and so forth for particular farmers.
B. Empanelled insurance companies: These are the insurance companies and other financial institutes like commer-
cial banks, co-operative banks along with their regulatory bodies which have been registered onto the government
records. These entities have the means for processing the requests for insurance premium processing, claim pro-
cessing and other detailed problem handling by the farmers registered onto the government records using the smart
contracts.
C. Beneficiaries: The farmers satisfying the minimum eligibility criteria for availing the benefits of insurance scheme
can register with the government through smart contract. This smart contract saves their details such as name, email
and secret passphrase.
4.2 Registration
The farmers send the request to register through the front end dapp which makes a contact with REG smart contract.
It allows the farmer to provide his personal details like nation’s identity number and asks for a secret passphrase. The
farmers are required to provide their preferences for crops, their locality. These details will be saved in offline database on
cloud but the hash of the data will be saved on blockchain connected to overlay network. The personal data of farmers is

accompanied with the digital signatures which are linked with the secret passphrase chosen by the farmers and a nation’s
identity number. While saving on the cloud, if the digital signatures are missing, the cloud server will discard the data.
Cloud server will save the data in the form of merkle tree of identical size.64 The data is grouped into identical block size
which is converted to merkle tree. Figure 4 shows the Merkle tree architecture. The format of merkle tree provides the
ease of generating a hash of the data using a function f. The hash function will take an input string of variable length but
will generate an output string of identical length. This hash will be saved on the blockchain network.
4.3 Insurance data sharing and claim payment
Once the farmers have registered successfully. They can pay the required amount of premium.
i. The farmer will visit one of the empanelled companies for crop insurance under the scheme.
ii. The insurance company will try to generate the hash using the same hash function by using the nation’s identity
number and the secret passphrase decided by farmer during registration.
iii. If the hash matches, the INS contract will change the status value to “accept” and it will trigger an event to government
to make a contact with the third-party database for weather data fetching in real time using OAAS (Oracle as a service)
since the smart contract cannot access the data from third party.
iv. After verifying data from both sides, the claim payment starts automatically. Figure 5 shows the flow of crop insurance
system.
5 INSCROPS: BLOCKCHAIN BASED CROP INSURANCE MOBILE
INTERFACE
The abstract architecture described in Sections 3 and 4 are developed using a mobile application InsCrops which is pro-
vided to end users in proof-of-concepts based implementation. In this section, a mobile application for the aid of all
stakeholders of the proposed system is discussed.

landing page for farmer node
The first step in the application is to choose among the category of participant among the various categories that is,
validator, farmer and insurance company After selecting the role, the user lands up on specific page where he can proceed
with the required actions as discussed in previous sections. The validator node [see Figure 6A] participates in federated
learning procedure and thus has to download the global training model. Finally, the validator node participates in the
voting procedure through the provided interface. The participating node is assigned a role according to its trust_score
either as a validator node or as a validator leader node. Figures 6B,C show the further processing in both type of roles. The
basic functionalities of insurance system are provided to the farmers such as premium payment, applying the insurance
claim and checking his last transaction history [see Figure 6D]. Note that the premium payment module currently does not
use blockchain but uses a third-party payment gateway. Once the farmer applies for insurance claim from the interface,
he needs to visit the nearest empanelled insurance company. Whenever the insurance company tries to perform the
specified operations, it will undergo the blockchain exclusive operations as discussed in Section 4.3 thus, leading to a
secure pathway for crop insurance claim settlement.

batches with blocks, adding tamper-resistant digital fingerprints to blocks and finally to link blocks one by one. The
consensus mechanism is modified using python programming language with federated learning framework designed
on PySyft.65
Under Consortium blockchain, a selected group of users are granted the permission to participate in decentralized
consensus procedure. It is generally used by some specific industrial groups such as financial sector.66 There are two
smart contracts, REG for registration of farmers and INS for insurance related functions. The local cluster implementa-
tion is performed in combination with the insurance application set-up scenario by using Chaquopy67 (https://github.
com/chaquo/chaquopy) plugin in android studio. The network size of 16 nodes for farmers, 2 nodes for insurance com-
panies along with 50 validator nodes is set up. The genesis block extensively adds the stakeholder nodes in network. The
blockchain nodes are setup in two labs. Lab1 consists of 35 validator nodes, 9 farmer nodes and 2 insurance companies.
Lab2 contains the remaining nodes for the implementation.
The experiment is conducted on LAN deployment within the two labs. The AWS EC2 cloud services are used.
The central server was implemented on a 1.6 Ghz i5 computing system with 8GB of RAM. The various PoS based
protocols mentioned in section are also implemented for analysis of the proposed system in reference to the existing
approaches. In Tendermint, the wait time is set to be 2 ms. In ouroboros and algorand, the epoch time is set to be 3 ms.
The hyperparameters for federated learning are initialized as follows: the learning rate 𝛼 = 0.01, the total batches = 8
and local training epoch 𝛽 = 60. The learning rate and the training loss for each batch is recorded and then the loss is
plotted against learning rate as shown in Figure 7 which reveal that loss is minimum for learning rate 𝛼 = 0.01. Equiv-
alently, the loss is minimum and accuracy is maximum for epoch 𝛽 = 60 as demonstrated by Figure 8 and Figure 9,
respectively.
The validator nodes dynamically collect data and perform the training simultaneously. The python code is extended
to include the mathematically oriented game theory approach. The network has been simulated with assortment of both
category of users performing their part in the game theoretic model. For the initializing the system processing, 2% nodes
of system are already considered to be part of the approved validator nodes. The system is run through total 10 iterations
which might acquire different validation leader in each iteration.
6.1 Performance validation
In this section, we try to study and analyze the attack resistance capabilities of the proposed PoS consensus mechanism.
For the purpose of evaluation, we estimate the intrusion accomplishment rate (IAR) which is defined as follows: the
success rate of a malicious validator attacker trying to annihilate the performance of underlying system. It is assumed
that the out of the total number of validator nodes, the proportion of attackers range from 10% to 30%. As depicted
in Figure 10, the proposed consensus mechanism is less prone to the external data attacks. The proposed PoS mecha-
nism is compared with standard PoS mechanism as well as the algorand, ouroboros, and tendermint implementation.

The ouroboros algorithm relies only on the net stake owned by a node which increases the risk of malicious nodes in
the network. The algorand algorithm works with slight variation in ouroboros algorithm. It does not reveal the final
leader node without submitting the proof. But the randomness used in the input string selection process can be biased
by some rival node. The tendermint consists of two step voting process. But it relies on majority participation of honest
nodes.
Evidently, the proposed frameworks perform better due the incorporation of federated learning which does not require
to move the data from users to central servers for data analysis whereas in PoS mechanism, the only criteria used is stake
owned by the users and thus can be at times misleading.
Also, we compute the value of MAE (mean absolute error) using the Equation 11:
MAE = 1
n
n∑
i=1
∣ xi − xp ∣, (11)
where xi is the observed 𝜎2 value and xp is the predicted 𝜎2 value.

F I G U R E 11 MAE analysis for proposed system
F I G U R E 12 Time comparison for different classifier models
The MAE for given federated learning model is shown in Figure 11. The MAE value for proposed system decreases over
time and shows constant value after some specific time. We compare the proposed system with basic neural network-based
machine learning classifier. The essence of the model uses neural network for prediction of values.
The basic learning model is trained and assessed on whole dataset collected from all individual nodes. The dataset
is transferred over the network to single local node for evaluation. Evidently the single node consumes more time for
training over the model because of the limited computing capabilities of single node. Moreover, the dataset transfer over
the network expends more time as well as bandwidth. It took 25.6 seconds to train the model and led to accuracy score of
86%. Figure 12 shows the training time taken by each node.

F I G U R E 13 Analysis of learning mechanisms
In federated learning classifier, the nodes are trained locally isolated from the network on their own generated dataset.
After fixed iterations, the weights are transferred to the server for accretion. As depicted by the features of federated
learning models, the communication overhead due to data transfer is abridged. The average time taken by nodes for
training on local node is 17.65 seconds with an aggregated accuracy of 84.5%. The system is compared with standard
centralized learning procedures as well as distributed machine learning.
Figure 13 depicts the comparison between the 3 learning criteria. Federated learning outperforms the centralized
learning as well as distributed learning.
For the purpose of evaluating the system, varying number of validator nodes are deliberately proposed to be the nodes
which have an intention of performing malicious activity and will try to not maintain the threshold level of trust score
after entering the network. Thus, these nodes will prefer to play the move “D” in game theoretic model.
6.2 Modeled moves
This system is tested under varying combination of moves chosen by players of both categories. The moves of players
are simulated and the performance of the system is evaluated under two major set of instances. The moves chosen by
player P(y) play a significant role in deciding the overall performance of the system. The performance of the system will
be superior when majority of the average trust score of the nodes in the system is above the threshold decided while setup
of the system. The nodes which maintain their trust score value above the decide threshold value are considered to be the
loyal nodes which will actually strive for the better performance of the system rather being involved in certain malicious
activities.
Case 1. when player, P(y) makes move N.
The player P(y) is made to choose move N. The majority of the nodes maintain their average trust score value above
threshold value if the probability, p of making move N is above the specified calculated value in Equation (7). Whereas the
nodes maintaining their average trust score above threshold value become comparatively low in number when probability
to make move N is less than the specified calculated value.
Thus, if the player P(y) actually makes move N when probability is above the calculated value, the performance of the
system is superior and low otherwise. It is to be noted although the performance of the system will not be affected too
much, but the player P(y) gets more punishment that being rewarded. This is illustrated in Figure 14A.
Case 2. When player, P(y) makes move M.
The player P(y) is made to choose move M. The majority of the nodes maintain their average trust score value
below threshold value if the probability, p of making move N is above the specified calculate value. Whereas the nodes

maintaining their average trust score above threshold value become high in number when the probability to make move
N is less than the specified calculated value.
Thus, if the player P(y) actually makes move M when probability of making move N is above the calculated value, the
performance of the system is low and high otherwise. This is illustrated in Figure 14B.
Overall, it can be concluded that performance of the system is worst in case when the concept of game theory requires
to make move N but the player P(y) chooses to make move M.
The significance of choosing to evaluate the system under varying modeled moves is to ensure the satisfactory level
of performance of the system under almost all scenario since ultimately the system will be manged by anonymous users.
6.3 Attacks prevention
In this section, we analyze the effectiveness of proposed PoS algorithm for resisting against various security attacks. The
evaluation exhibits the efficacy of proposed PoS mechanism in combating the various security attacks which is the prime
requirement in any application pertaining to finances, banking, and insurance.
6.3.1 51% Attack
There might be some scenario where the attacking nodes have acquired enough hashing power and stake to accomplish
the 51% attack to put down the network. But the proposed PoS mechanism employs continuous monitoring through

federated learning which will be able to immediately detect any fault or slip in system. The federated learning allows to
learn and grow simultaneously to avoid the 51% attack by associating a trust_score with every node which updated after
specified time period.
6.3.2 Sybil attack
In a blockchain network, an arbitrary challenger node can produce multiple simulated identities to take conquer the
network. Such adversary nodes are called sybil nodes. Such attacker nodes can create an illusion of being the fully autho-
rized node as shown in Figure 15. They can disconnect the genuine nodes from the network. In a blockchain network,
the virtual sybil nodes will forward the block of only the malicious nodes in order to take charge of the network.68 The
proposed PoS consensus mechanism certainly aids to resist the sybil attack because before adding the new block by any
random node requires its trust_score to be above a threshold value. Moreover, it is quite apparent to maintain a genuine
trust_score.
In order to evaluate the performance of the system, few nodes in the system are deliberately coded as sybil nodes.
The system with proposed PoS is able to counter more sybil attacks as compared to the system with conventional PoS
consensus mechanism as depicted in Figure 16.
7 CONCLUSION
The presented research work proposes a novel consensus mechanism that integrates federated learning and game theory
with standard PoS mechanism. In an anonymous environment of blockchain, the proposed research work associates a
trust_score with each validator node to enable the participants of network select the trust-worthy nodes. The trust_score is
calculated using federated learning and maintained using game theory. The proposed mechanism uses game theory-based
reward and punishment model to ensure only the trust worthy nodes survive in the system. The system has been analyzed
under various experimental conditions. The proposed system is presented as an application for crop insurance involving
farmers and the empanelled insurance companies. The choice of insurance sector for implementation is motivated out
of needs of crop insurance sector is governed by high security requirements, timely transaction completion for farmers,
tracking and traceability. The proposed system shows nearly consistent intrusion accomplishment rate under varying
proportion of malicious nodes with an improvement of nearly 40% with respect to standard PoS consensus mechanism.
Moreover, the mean absolute error of the learning model is reduced by nearly 30% over time. The proposes system also
shows superior performance in terms of accuracy and training time incurred as compared to the basic machine learning
classifier.
8 FUTURE WORK
There are many mainstream consensus mechanisms for blockchain but they differ in terms of resource efficiency, scal-
ability, computational complexity, security resilience. There is a constant requirement of improving the efficiency and

performance of blockchain consensus mechanisms. In the same direction, the proposed research work presents a novel
consensus mechanism for improving the consensus mechanism for improving the performance of existing consensus
mechanism, that is, PoS.
However, there are few open areas in proposed research work. This proposed research work can be extended to
enhance the scalability of the overall system. Since federated learning is involved, thus it becomes imperative to work
toward the throughput performance of the system. Certain research efforts for improving the block generation time can
further improve the applicability of the system. Detailed literature survey reveals that more research efforts are required
for the efficient channelization of extreme potential of artificial intelligence models to do away the difficulties faced in
blockchain. Future research goals should be focussed to address the technical aspects of the blockchain technology in
combination with the specific social context of the insurance applications in general and financial applications in gen-
eral. Also, the proposed research work makes the room for novel ideas in enhancing the fault tolerance of the insurance
system by adjusting the learning parameters of the learning model.
