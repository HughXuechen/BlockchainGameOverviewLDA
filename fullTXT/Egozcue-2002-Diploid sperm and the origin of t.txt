Trisomy 16, the 45,X monosomy and triploidy are the more frequent chromosome anomalies in spontaneous
abortions. Earlier estimations, based on frequencies of diandric triploidy at conception, resulted in a good correlation
with the frequencies of diploid sperm in infertile males (up to 1.9%). Recent data have shown that most diandric
triploids originate by dispermy, although 8.3% of them are produced by diploid sperm resulting from meiotic
errors. Using these data, the estimated frequency of diploid sperm is still in good correlation with the percentage
above. Furthermore, analysis of male pronuclei (PN) in 3PN zygotes produced by ICSI with sperm from oligo-,
crypto- and azoospermic males revealed that 33.3% of them were diploid, while none of the PN produced by
normozoospermic males by IVF was. The estimated frequency of diploid sperm in these infertile males is also in
good correlation with the previous figures. The data suggest that most diandric triploids are produced by
normozoospermic males by dispermy, while most diandric triploids produced by oligozoospermic males would
result from fertilization by unreduced, diploid sperm.

Introduction
Trisomy 16, the 45,X monosomy and triploidy are the chromo-
some abnormalities most frequently found in spontaneous
abortions. The association of trisomy 16 and of the 45,X
monosomy with abortion is well known. However, the
extremely high incidence of triploids among spontaneous
abortions is often overlooked.
Diploidy, on the other hand, is the most common chromo-
some anomaly found in the sperm of patients with meiotic
disorders (Egozcue et al., 2000), in oligozoospermic males
(Bernardini et al., 1997; Downie et al., 1997; Egozcue et al.,
1997; McInnes et al., 1998; Aran et al., 1999; Pang et al.,
1999; Pfeffer et al., 1999; Calogero et al., 2001) and in some
carriers of balanced chromosome reorganizations (Egozcue
et al., 2000; Pellestor et al., 2001) with proportions of diploid
sperm ranging from 0.10 to 9.6%.
Most studies on the relationship between chromosome
anomalies in sperm and the production of chromosomally
abnormal embryos or offspring are usually centered on sex
chromosome or autosomal disomies, and seldom on diploidy
(Zaragoza et al., 2000; Calogero et al., 2001; Macas et al.,
2001; Pellestor et al., 2001).
However, in the most important study published so far on
the parental origin of triploidy (Zaragoza et al., 2000) at least
8.3% of diandric triploids originated from diploid sperm, and
© European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 5
a study (Macas et al., 2001) on the chromosome constitution
of paternal pronuclei in zygotes obtained by ICSI observed
that 33.3% of the abnormal male pronuclei were diploid.
In a recent paper (Egozcue et al., 2000) we underlined the
important role of diploid sperm in the origin of triploidy, as
well as the very high contribution of triploidy to pregnancy
wastage, and suggested that a disturbance of the anaphase I
(spindle assembly) checkpoint (Rieder et al., 1994) related to
the presence of synaptic anomalies and to the subsequent
presence of erratic chromosomes could give rise to the produc-
tion of diploid sperm. Although this paper was published quite
recently, since then two studies have provided considerable
new data on the origin of triploidy (Zaragoza et al., 2000;
Macas et al., 2001).
The parental origin of triploidy
Zaragoza et al. carried out a molecular study of 91 triploid
spontaneous abortions. Most triploids (60/91) were of paternal
origin, 27 cases were maternal and in four cases the origin
was unknown (Zaragoza et al., 2000).
Regarding the 60 triploids of paternal origin, 37 cases
(61.6% of diandric triploids) originated by dispermy, five
(8.3%) were produced by diploid sperm, one resulted from a
postmeiotic error, and in 17 cases the origin could not be
determined.
S.Egozcue et al.
Prior to the publication of the work by Zaragoza et al.,
several studies had come to the unexpected conclusion that
most triploidy was digynic. Based on estimated frequencies of
triploidy at conception of 4.5% (Munné and Cohen, 1998) to
8.8% (Jacobs, 1992; Egozcue et al., 2000) or even higher
(12.4 %) (Eiben et al., 1990) and on an erroneously low
proportion of diandry of only 25%, we (Egozcue et al., 2000)
came to the conclusion that 1.12–2.2% of triploidy was
diandric; although these figures underestimated diandry, they
were in good correlation with the proportion of diploid sperm
found in infertile males (up to 1.90%) (Egozcue et al., 2000).
Using the new data of Zaragoza et al. (2000), which show
that at least 8.3% of diandric triploids originate from diploid
sperm, the proportion of diploid sperm can be estimated at
0.73%, which is still in good correlation with the percentages
of diploid sperm found in infertile males (up to 1.90%).
Although in this case the estimated percentage is slightly
lower, one has to take into account that it corresponds to
a general population of males, which also includes more
normozoospermic than oligozoospermic individuals.
Diploid pronuclei and the origin of triploidy
Of even more interest are the recent data of Macas et al.,
who analysed the chromosomal constitution of 163 paternal
complements from 163 tripronucleate (3PN) zygotes obtained
by ICSI using the sperm of oligozoospermic (90 cases),
cryptozoospermic (28 cases) and azoospermic (20 cases, with
sperm obtained from the epididymus or the testes) patients
(Macas et al., 2001). The data were compared with those
obtained in136 paternal complements from 68 3PN zygotes
produced by IVF from normozoospermic males.
The first important observation is the high proportion of dis-
permy, which was not specifically indicated in the paper, but can
be deduced from the high incidence of dispermy in spontaneous
triploids (61.6%) (Zaragoza et al., 2000), from the even higher
incidence of dispermy induced by IVF conditions, and from the
high number of paternal pronuclei (136) found in the 68 IVF
zygotes analysed. This is in good agreement with the data of
Rosenbusch et al. (1997), who found an excess of XYY triploid
zygotes over the theoretical expectations, indicating a possible
increase of dispermy related to IVF, and with those of Zaragoza
et al. (2000), who found that in spontaneous abortions dispermy
is the most frequent cause of triploidy (Rosenbusch et al., 1997;
Zaragoza et al., 2000).
However, in the oligo-crypto-azoospermic group, in which
the zygotes had only one paternal pronucleus (as established
by careful analysis of the oocyte and the polar body character-
istics), four of the 12 abnormal male pronuclei (33.3%) were
diploid. This impressive proportion of diploidy included three
diploids in seven abnormal, Y-containing pronuclei, and one
diploid in five abnormal X-containing pronuclei.
On the other hand, not a single diploid male pronucleus
was found in the control population of pronuclei obtained by
IVF from normozoospermic males.
These data confirm that in patients with low numbers of
sperm, the presence of diploid sperm is the most constant and
frequent chromosome anomaly (Egozcue et al., 1997).
The proportion of diploid pronuclei was of two diploids in
6
eight abnormal pronuclei (25%) in oligozoospermic males, one
diploid in two abnormal pronuclei (50%) in cryptozoospermic
males and one diploid in two abnormal pronuclei (50%) in
azoospermic males.
The overall frequency of diploid male pronuclei was 1/73
(1.3%) in X-bearing pronuclei and 3/90 (3.3%) in Y-bearing
pronuclei. Even if the numbers are still low, a proportion of 1.3–
3.3% diploid sperm is in good correlation with the proportion of
diploid sperm in infertile males (up to 1.90%).
Although in this case the estimated frequency of 3.3% diploid
sperm is slightly higher, one has to take into account that it
corresponds to a population of oligo-crypto-azoospermic males.
Conclusions
From the comparative analysis of previously published data
(Egozcue et al., 1997; Zaragoza et al., 2000; Macas et al.,
2001) it is possible to come to the following conclusions
regarding the origin and distribution of triploidy: (i) Over the
total number of triploids, 65.9% are diandric (of paternal
origin), 61.6% by dispermy, 8.3% by fertilization of an oocyte
by a diploid sperm and 1.6% as a result of mitotic errors. In
17 cases (28.3%) the origin of the anomaly could not be
established (Zaragoza et al., 2000); (ii) The proportion of
diploid sperm in infertile males (Egozcue et al., 1997) (0.10–
1.90%) is in good correlation with other estimated frequencies:
1.12–2.2% (Egozcue et al., 2000); 0.73% as calculated by us
from the work of Zaragoza et al. (Zaragoza et al., 2000); and,
in male pronuclei, 3.3% (Macas et al., 2001). In the former
case, the lower figure (0.73%) could result from a population
with a majority of normozoospermic males, while in the latter
case the higher figure could be related to a population made
exclusively of oligo-crypto-azoospermic males.
Normozoospermic males produce diandric triploid zygotes
mainly by dispermy. Oligo-crypto-azoospermic males produce
diandric triploid zygotes mainly through the fertilization of
normal oocytes by diploid sperm.
From a clinical point of view, it is obvious that patients
with a severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia have a higher risk
of producing triploid embryos after ICSI (Macas et al., 2001).
This information should be taken into account in relation to
the reproductive history and future management of these
couples. A sperm chromosome study by fluorescence in-
situ hybridizaton (FISH) may be indicated in some cases.
Unfortunately, at present, and using standard sperm selection
procedures, such as Percoll separation, the proportion of diploid
sperm can only, at best, be reduced by half (Kovanci et al.,
2001). Diploid sperm can only be completely eliminated by
flow sorting (Vidal et al., 1999), a technique that results in a
drastic decrease of sperm counts and that, as a result, cannot
be used in patients with reduced numbers of sperm.
