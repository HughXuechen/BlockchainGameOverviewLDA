In the blockchain network, to get rewards in the blockchain, blockchain participants pay for various forms of competition such as
computing power, stakes, and other resources. Because of the need to pay a certain cost, individual participants cooperate to
maintain the long-term stability of the blockchain jointly. In the course of such competition, the game between each other has
appeared invisibly. To better understand the blockchain design of cooperation mechanisms, in this paper, we constructed a game
framework between participants with different willingness, using evolutionary game theory, and complex network games. We
analyzed how the behavior of participants potentially develops with cost and payoff. We consider the expected benefits of
participants for the normal growth of the blockchain as the major factor. Considering the behavior of malicious betrayers, the
blockchain needs to be maintained in the early stage. Numerical simulation supports our analysis.
1. Introduction
,e public blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that is
used to build a decentralized ledger and can be trusted to
achieve autonomy without third-party supervision. ,e
most well known of all blockchains is Bitcoin, in which the
Nakamoto consensus protocol [1] creatively integrates a
variety of mechanisms and technologies, laying the foun-
dation for the subsequent development of the blockchain.
Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decen-
tralization, traceability, non-tampering, programmability,
and collective maintenance.
Blockchain is a time-ordered one-in-one-out directed
graph, interconnected to form a chain structure that uses
cryptography to ensure that the distributed ledger is tamper-
evident and unforgeable. In a broad sense, blockchain
technology is a new distributed infrastructure and com-
puting paradigm. It uses a blockchain data structure to store
data, decentralized node consensus algorithms to generate
and verify data, cryptography to secure data transmission
and access, and smart contracts composed of automated
scripting code to use data.
Besides applying some sophisticated technologies, the
blockchain also considers some mechanisms. In the
blockchain represented by Bitcoin, the entire nodes (block
miners) are economically encouraged to abide by the
“longest chain policy” to preserve the stability of the
blockchain. Most blockchains follow this policy. ,e block
bookkeeper packs any set of verified transactions into a data
structure, announced a candidate “block,” and broadcasts it
to the entire network. Each blockchain participant consis-
tently uses the longest chain as its local blockchain copy.,is
design can ensure that we can write the new blocks with the
most resources into the chain in time.
Many blockchains also used bitcoin’s incentive mech-
anism. It comprises two parts: effort and reward.

(i) Effort. ,e process of solving intensive problems
makes Sybil attacks [2] economically unbearable
(ii) Reward. ,e reward given to the new block producer
(miner) will be released after the network admits the
block it publishes
Taking Bitcoin as an example, the hash puzzle-solving
process is regarded as a computing power competition among
miners. After investing in a certain amount of effort, theminers
will get two types of rewards during the mining process: new
currency rewards for creating new blocks and transaction fees
included in the block. To get these rewards, miners are vying to
complete a mathematical puzzle based on a cryptographic hash
algorithm, which requires powerful computing power. In
addition, each transaction may include a transaction fee.
Miners who successfully “dig out” a new block during the
mining process can receive “tips” for all transactions recorded
in the block. ,e competition of this algorithm and the
mechanism by which the winner has the all right to record
transactions on the blockchain provide the safety of Bitcoin.
Blockchain is a competitive platform for users. ,e anonymity
of its participants and the transparency of network information
create innate conditions for pursuing a balanced game. And the
periodic expansion of new blocks in the blockchain provides an
appropriate arena for repeated games.
Some scholars have applied game models to blockchain
issues. How many transactions a new block contains is the
miner’s choice. Houy [3] defined the Bitcoin mining game
between miners, assuming that the number of transactions in
a block results from the game, and studied the Nash equi-
librium of the game. From the perspective of game theory,
Schrijvers et al. [4] defined the mining pool payment function
in a single mine pool and analyzed whether several mining
pool strategies meet the requirements of incentive compat-
ibility, proportional payment, and budget balance. Eyal dis-
cussed the attack between the two mining pools [5], there is a
contradiction between individual rationality and collective
rationality between the pools, which is like the tragedy game
of the commons. He believes that the interception attack
reduces the computing power of the entire network.
Security issues in the blockchain have always been the
concentrate of attention. 51% attack, selfish mining attack
[6], and other threats always exist. ,e focus of this article is
the impact of the strategic choice of each blockchain par-
ticipant on the cooperation mechanism. We consider in-
dividual miners have bounded rationality and will adopt
specific participation strategies in the blockchain. We model
the strategy choice in the network as an evolutionary game
and study the evolutionary stability of the dynamics of
strategy selection.
,e contributions of this paper are threefold. (1) We
formulate the cooperative behavior on the blockchain. (2)
We use evolutionary game theory to analyze how the par-
ticipants of the blockchain change their strategies and their
incentives. (3) We also analyzed the influence of network
structure on cooperative behavior on the blockchain.
We organized this paper as follows. In Section 2, we
review the background on security issues in the blockchain
and evolutionary game theory. We formalize the new block
generation right game and analyze it in Section 3. In Section
4, we assign values to the parameters in the model and
conduct simulations and discuss the results. Finally, we
conclude with future directions in Section 5.
2. Background
2.1. &e Relationship between Cooperation, Trust, and
Security. Cooperation, trust, and security are three concepts
that are connected with each other and have their emphasis.
Different security scenarios, relationship types, and in-
ternal interactions within the system require different levels
of trust. Trust depends on the restraint of the interacting
parties, which is usually determined by agreement in the
system. Since trust involves both risks and benefits, the need
for trust is different for cooperation. Sztompka [7] believes
that the simplest definition of trust is the gamble of believing
in the future actions of others. Gambetta [8] emphasized that
trust required depends on the strength of the mechanism
that determines cooperative decision-making, and it also
depends on the social context in which we decide and treats
trust as “a result of cooperation.”
It does not base the basis of cooperation on pure trust,
but on the continuity of the relationship. Axelrod and
Hamilton [9] believe that, in the long run, whether the
conditions for the establishment of a stable cooperation
model between the two parties are mature is more important
than whether they trust each other. In order for the coop-
eration to be stable, theremust be a large enough incentive in
the future. It requires that the participants in the system have
a large enough chance to meet again, and the meaning of
their encounter again cannot be discounted too much.
Lamsal believes that trust and security are tightly cou-
pled [10].,ere are various ways to provide security services.
However, encryption is one of the most extensive and ef-
fective ways to provide these services. But the management
of cryptographic keys becomes a problem. ,e fundamental
problem that any key management system is trying to solve:
Is the key trusted?
Trust and security go hand in hand, and trustworthiness
is the foundation of security. A trusted mechanism cannot
accomplish any security function alone but can be imple-
mented in various systems and work with the security
mechanism of the system to play the role of reinforcing and
managing security. But traditional security measures cannot
really cover the smart environment, so trust is important.
“6G White Paper: Research Challenges for Trust, Security
and Privacy” [11] pointed out that the 6G network must
support embedded trust for an increased level of informa-
tion security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies, and trust
mechanisms need to be defined.
In the modern network environment, users do not feel
what kind of information has been collected, and they do not
know where and who uses this information. With the
gradual popularity of such application scenarios, the concept
of trust has recently approached the concept of security and
is closer to the needs of users. As the cooperative relationship
between the participants in the network advances, the trust
relationship is established unconsciously.

2.2. Security Issues in Blockchain. Blockchain uses some
mature cryptographic principles and consensus mechanisms
based on distributed ledger technology to realize trusted
interaction without the intervention of a third party in a
distributed environment. ,e improvement of system effi-
ciency and cost reduction brought by blockchain provides
new methods for economic and social development and
various industries. Blockchain can build trust in a low-cost
way. Blockchain has developed rapidly recently, and scholars
have tried to use blockchain in fields such asmedical care [12],
edge computing [13], and the Internet of ,ings [14, 15].
,ese application areas involve the following features of
blockchain technology.
(i) Decentralization. ,e blockchain network is based
on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to create infor-
mation broadcasts, and the failure of a single node
has no global impact.
(ii) Untamperable. All nodes maintain the ledger in the
blockchain, and the consensus mechanism ensures
that most nodes allow the ledger and provides a
strong correlation between data blocks with a hash
function, and the data on the chain are open to the
entire network, and the data are verifiable and
traceable.
(iii) Anonymity. Cryptography and other technologies
separate the user’s real identity from the network
identity so that the user’s identity can be protected
and establish a foundation of trust at the same time.
In a blockchain network without third-party supervision,
the essence of security is the confrontation between honest
participants and malicious betrayers. Traditional network
security threats will also exist in P2P network; using identity
authentication, intrusion detection, traffic monitoring, etc.,
plays a significant role in network security protection.
However, defense often lags attacks, and it is intractable to
respond to more complex attacks and defenses in the net-
work promptly. With the risk of more complex attacks, it is
also a major challenge to coordinate the selection of defense
strategies and generate attack responses before the attackers
have caused severe losses. Besides the traditional security,
the special scenario of the blockchain network takes unique
challenges to the network security.,is is because traditional
data-based network security research methods are prob-
lematic to handle with blockchain network attacks that have
real monetary benefits.
,e blockchain suffers the following security threats:
(i) 51% Attack. ,e 51% attack is an attack method that
uses computing power as a competitive condition and
controls the advantage of computing power to cancel
payment transactions that have occurred. Blockchain
networks such as Bitcoin have encryption security
because of decentralization. After most nodes on the
Bitcoin network agree, the public ledger is credible.
However, if a single entity or team can control over
50% of the hash rate, then they can change the state of
the blockchain. It can get the random number needed
to mine the block faster than others and decide the
packaged transaction and affect the effectiveness of the
block. After launching the attack, the attacker will
continuously destroy the value of a cryptocurrency by
implementing double-spending or posting various
fraudulent transfers on the chain.
(ii) Selfish Mining. A selfish mining attack is a method
against Bitcoin mining and the incentive mecha-
nism. Its purpose is not to destroy the operating
mechanism of Bitcoin, but to pursue additional
rewards and make honest miners perform invalid
calculations.
In short, the core idea of a selfish mining attack is
that malicious mining pools deliberately delay
publishing new blocks worked out by them, and
create a private branch under their control, making
the chain to fork. Honest miners continue to mine
based on public branches, while malicious mining
pools mine based on private branches controlled by
them. If the malicious mining pool calculates more
blocks, the length of the private branch they control
is naturally ahead of the public branch. ,e mali-
cious mining pool chooses not to rush to publish
these new blocks and strives to further increase the
mining revenue. However, because of the limitation
of the computing power of the malicious mining
pool, the length advantage of the private branch will
not be maintained consistently. When the public
branch is close to the length of the private branch,
the malicious mining pool will announce the branch
generated by itself to replace the legal one and take
the reward of these new blocks.
(iii) Eclipse Attacks. ,e method of eclipse attacks [16] is
different from 51% attack. ,ey attack specific nodes
or node clusters so that the network appears “parti-
tioned” to achieve double-spending and other pur-
poses. Due to network spare capacity and computing
power distribution limitations, the blockchain usually
limits the upper limit of a single node that can receive
information and actively link to other nodes. ,e
concentrate of an eclipse attack is to start with the
information of the nodes linked to and received. If the
node receiving information and the externally linked
nodes are all controlled by malicious nodes, it is
equivalent that themalicious nodes isolate and control
the received information to the target node. Here, it is
called the node that suffered an “eclipse attack.” If the
malicious nodes can control more nodes and launch
an eclipse attack on more normal nodes, then the
malicious nodes will split the blockchain network into
two distinct partitions, just like a fork.
2.3. Application of Evolutionary Game &eory in Blockchain.
In game theory, players can adopt several strategies, have a
certain influence on other players, and get a certain payoff
in the interaction. Game theory is the study of rational
choice of strategies between individuals to pursue the
maximization of their interests. ,e core concept is Nash
Complexity 3
equilibrium. Daskalakis et al. [17] conclude that it is almost
impossible to find Nash equilibrium on a large scale in
action-graph games. ,ey proved it belongs to a subset of
the NP problem. But when the participants are anonymous,
they need only polynomial time to approach the Nash
equilibrium.
,e evolutionary game theory concentrates on how
individuals with bounded rationality can continuously op-
timize their payoffs by comparing in the repeated game.
Similar to the concept of fitness in the evolution of nature,
players with a high payoff are more likely to take part in the
next round of the game, while a play with a low payoff is
more likely to be eliminated. Eventually, a particular strategy
will reach equilibrium in the system.
,e blockchain is a natural testing ground in this respect
because of the following characteristics:
(1) Based on the decentralized P2P communication
method, information symmetry becomes workable.
In the blockchain network, all individuals share the
same database, and all information releases appear as
broadcast. ,en, not only are the two parties in the
transaction holding information, but all communi-
cating parties have corresponding information. ,is
has completely changed the limitations of infor-
mation asymmetry between the two parties and
created conditions for joint decision-making.
(2) ,e status of participants in the blockchain is equal.
Besides the alliance chain, which is between the public
chain and the private chain, the rights and status of
the nodes in an individual blockchain are equal. It
enhances the autonomy of decision-making. In the
game, the inequality of social status is prone to cause a
party to have the dominant advantage, making the
result more predisposed to the dominant party. ,e
blockchain has changed this state and created a nearly
free environment, making it easier to analyze the
results in a rational decision-making manner. With
the blessing of blockchain technology, both parties to
the transaction have complete transaction data, and
each transaction subject can make independent de-
cisions based on their knowledge, and there is almost
no distinction in transaction rights.
(3) Cryptography provides a credible environment. All
participants and their information on the blockchain
are digital. On the premise that it does not compromise
encryption technology, transaction data is irreversible
and cannot be denied. Participants in the transaction
process are more prone to trust each other.
(4) Generating new blocks with no curb on the rounds
creates conditions for repeated games. We can
consider the processing of each new block as a re-
peated game, and participants do not demand to
reveal their private keys and remain anonymous. As
the chain continues to grow, it reaches the Nash
equilibrium.
In a complex network environment, players do not
have sufficient ability to get global information, nor have
enough ability to choose the best strategy to maximize
their profits. ,is condition of blockchain shows that
participants are bounded to rationality in the strategy
selection process.
,ere are two types of behaviors in the system: coop-
eration and defection. Cooperation refers to the behavior of
paying a definite cost to benefit the opponent, but defection
is to get benefits from other players. According to the law of
survival of the fittest, high payoff players will eliminate low
payoff ones.
,ere will be group selection [18] among players. A
group can contain several players, and the players within the
group are cooperative, while the groups are competing. ,e
contact relationship of blockchain participants also needs to
be considered, which can be represented by the network. In
the network, the node means a player, and the edge between
nodes serves as the game relationship between players. In
each round of the game, players interact according to the
game model and update their strategies according to payoffs.
From a security perspective, purely technical cannot
completely resolve the security threats of the blockchain
system, and the design of the mechanism brings a new
perspective to answer security issues.
3. The Evolutionary Game of
Blockchain Security
,e reason attack in the blockchain is hard to raise is not that
these participants have noble morals, but that they have
calculated that the benefits of honest participation are higher
than malicious attacks. ,at is why they maintain the
blockchain system instead of destroying it. Not only suffering
51% attacks, but the blockchain must also be able to resist a
variety of attacks.While using various security technologies, it
is necessary to construct an excellent mechanism. For ex-
ample, in the process of evolution of the blockchain, there are
competition mechanisms [19, 20] and voting mechanisms
[21], etc.,esemechanisms drive the blockchainmore secure.
Blockchain is a consensus system that pursues Nash equi-
librium and the Nash equilibrium point of a blockchain
system with an efficient mechanism design can approach the
optimal ideal state. ,is is also a significant reason to treat
blockchain as a revolutionary technology.
When the miners successfully dig a block, they become
the block producer in this round. ,ey can charge a fee for
the included transactions. ,ey can also get additional
economic rewards for new block. ,is is an incentive for
miners. With the uninterrupted generation of new blocks,
each participant continuously improves its game strategy by
learning the experience of the winners and forms a fresh
offensive and defensive situation. Motivated by the con-
tinuous improvement of the game strategy of the blockchain
participants, a developing defense-attack system of the
blockchain has finally been established.
3.1. Description and Assumptions of the Model. In the
blockchain system, different participants have distinct
preferences. To facilitate the model, we arrange all miners
4 Complexity
into two groups. Group A presents an inclination for co-
operation, while group B is more selfish. In the evolutionary
game, both groups A and B can only have access to in-
sufficient information with bounded rationality. And they
both imitate the strategies they would consider most helpful
and improve the strategies they have worked in previous.
Both groups will constantly adjust their strategies to max-
imize their payoffs.
,e strategies of the two sides of the game include the
“cooperation” strategy of observing the consensus mecha-
nism and the “defection” strategy of not observing the
consensus mechanism. ,e following are the assumptions
and parameter descriptions in the model.
Define the cooperation cost of participants in group A as
Ca and the cost of participants in group B as Cb. ,e dis-
tinction between the two groups is that group A tends to
abide by the rules and gets payoffs on the blockchain
honestly; with more computing power and other resources,
participants of group B are more prone to invest in hostile
costs to get payoffs on the blockchain. We define the total
revenue brought by each round of the game as R, which will
be distributed to two groups of participants after each round.
When a serious malicious attack occurs in the blockchain,
participants will suspect the sustainability of the blockchain
system, and the revenue R cannot be maintained. To es-
tablish the long-term validity and rationality of the block-
chain, the model satisfies the following conditions:
Ca >Cb, R>Ca + Cb.
Considering that no matter what participation means,
the participants chosen, even adopt some attacks, each
round of block generation game will gain certain benefits as
long as the blockchain can continue to run. However, this
type of payoff has distinct expectations for various partic-
ipants. Participants in group A can get mining rewards and
commission income in the forthcoming. ,is type of ex-
pected payoff is defined as Ka, and group B will have hope it
can control the blockchain to get illegal revenue, and we
define this kind of expected revenue as Kb.
In order to reduce the occurrence of malicious situa-
tions, the blockchain system adopts some punitive measures,
adding some regulations to the consensus mechanism, such
as delaying the issuance of mining rewards and collecting
deposits. We use P to represent this kind of punishment.
3.2. Model Analysis. Based on the assumptions and pa-
rameters in the previous section, this section establishes a
payment matrix between blockchain participants. Players
adopt various strategies, get the payoffs, and establish a
dynamic system. We show the strategy matrix in Table 1.
We use Eh

group A using different strategies (honest cooperation,

Unlike classical one-shot games, in the blockchain system,
participants can take part in the game many times, and each
block produced is regarded as a fresh round. Participants may
shift their strategies. Malicious participants may attack or
persuade honest participants to change their strategies in the
next game. To investigate the changing state of participants,
we employ evolutionary games in our analysis.
Assume that all blockchain participants have designated
a specific strategy at the genesis round. All participants are
honest or malicious, and they stay in the blockchain envi-
ronment in a certain proportion. After several rounds of
games, we examine the changes in the population.
In the evolutionary game, the evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS) is a strategy that other strategies cannot in-
vade. ,e case with punishment has a strong ESS because,
according to the loss aversion theory [22], punishment can
influence decision-making more than not getting incentives.
3.3. Blockchain Evolutionary Game in the Complex Network
Environment. Game model, network structure, and evolution
rules are the three important factors of network evolution.
Blockchain is based on a peer-to-peer network, which guar-
antees the fairness of the status of nodes to the greatest extent.
In the classic evolutionary game theory, the contact relation-
ship between players is uniform. However, the relationship
between participants in the blockchain is completely random.
,erefore, the actual network factor is also an important part to
be considered. ,e network can describe the connection re-
lationship between blockchain participants. Each node
Complexity 5
represents a participant, and the edges between nodes represent
the communication relationship between participants. In each
round of the blockchain generation process, participants adopt
evolution rules to update the game strategy.
In the small-world network, it is easier for collaborators
to unite on the random network to form a large cooperative
cluster, which promotes the emergence of cooperative be-
havior on the random network [23]. ,e emergence of
cooperation in BA scale-free networks has emerged in many
types of games, and the collaborators occupy the dominant
position in the network [24]. In the BA scale-free network,
the central nodes exist as stubborn collaborators. ,ese pure
collaborators can effectively resist the attacks of malicious
betrayers by forming an interconnected subnet.
In the blockchain network, various participants are
pursuing payoffs, but the methods used are distinct. From
the perspective of blockchain security, besides paying at-
tention to collaborators, the behavior of betrayers needs
more attention. Each coin has two sides. ,e influence of the
network structure on cooperative behavior also has a cor-
responding influence on the betrayers.
Except for some alliance chains and private chains, most
of the blockchains have incentive mechanisms to adjust their
expectations for future benefits. ,e blockchain system en-
courages participants to work actively, so that there are
enough nodes in the system to ensure the normal operation of
the system. Incentive theory ensures that a rational participant
can continue to work honestly. If malicious participants are in
a helpful position, blockchain will not reward them. ,ere-
fore, the best strategy for a rational blockchain participant is
to maintain honest cooperation in the blockchain.
Distributed individuals maintaining this behavior will not
pose a serious threat to the system, but malicious players
contact each other to form a community structure in the
network, which may pose a threat to the system. ,e mech-
anism design of the blockchain needs to ensure that rational
behavior is honest.,erefore, if participants are dishonest, they
will not be rewarded or even punished, so the expected future
benefits will decrease.,is has strong behavioral constraints on
the bounded rationality assumption mentioned above and
encourages miners to take part honestly in the blockchain.
In response to the above analysis, we designed corre-
sponding simulation experiments. In the next paragraph, we
will examine the development of cooperation in the
blockchain from two different perspectives: the proportion
of participants and the parameters in the game matrix.
4. Experimental Evaluation and Related Work
4.1. Experimental Evaluation. We evaluate different profit
situations through experiments to determine the changes in
the proportion of honest collaborators and malicious par-
ticipants in the population in the blockchain system under
distinct game conditions.We ran experiments for the reward
matrix of the case (Table 2).
Initially, 67% of group A were honest cooperators, and
20% of group B were malicious betrayers. Blue and red
signify the proportions of validators with honest and
malicious strategies, respectively. ,e Y-axis tracks the
population proportions, and the X-axis tracks the genera-
tions (i.e., block rounds). As shown in Figure 1, we can
notice that the honest strategy is an ESS.
We also run simulations by modifying the initial pro-
portions of malicious participants. ,e initial proportions of
malicious participants range from 0 to 33%. As shown in
Figure 2, the proportion of malicious participants has shown
a downward tendency.
In the simulation experiment, we discover that, although
the honest strategy is ESS, it is a weak ESS when group B’s
expected payoffs become higher, which is shown in Figure 3.
,e speculation is that when participants notice that there is
a high expected payoff with defection, it will motivate them
to flourish in a malicious direction.
,e above experiment does not consider the influence of
the network structure on the blockchain game and the fre-
quency of cooperation. We use the parameters in Table 2 to
design the game within the group A population in two typical
complex networks in Figure 4. Figure 4(a) runs theWS small-

network model [26]. In the simulation, the NetworkX library
of python is used. ,ere are 1000 nodes in the WS network,
and each node has 5 neighbors, and the probability of random
reconnection is 0.3. ,ere are 1000 nodes in the BA network,

birth updating process. ,e simulation discloses that it takes
quite lengthy rounds for honest collaborators to establish a
trusting, cooperative relationship. ,is protracted process
provides an opportunity for malicious behavior on the
blockchain.
4.2. Related Work. In the research on the combination of
blockchain and game theory, it mainly appears on the
following topics: the game of mining behavior in the
blockchain, security on the blockchain, and crypto-
currency and its applications.
In generating new blocks in the blockchain, there is a
competitive mining process. ,is leads to a game between
individuals. Some papers study the distribution of com-
puting power [27] and the choice of forks [28]. With the
continuous growth of miners, individual mining competi-
tion becomes more and more fierce. ,erefore, miners
spontaneously form mining alliances (mining pools). Some
scholars conduct research on the choice of mining pools and
the rewards in the mining pools [4, 29].
,ere are threats, such as selfish mining, 51% attacks,
and denial of service (DoS) on the blockchain. Some papers
start with the study of gaming behavior from the aspect of
blockchain security. ,ere is a game between the cost of an

attack on the blockchain and whether the system launches an
attack and the strength of the attack [5, 30].
An important application of game theory is in the
analysis of economic behavior, so a lot of research involves
the game of economic behavior in the blockchain, for
example, the choice between different cryptocurrencies
[31], the choice of transactions when making a new block
[32], and some payment behaviors involving actual
transactions [33].
,e article [34] focuses on the reward mechanism in the
blockchain and uses evolutionary games to analyze how the
behavior of participants develops with the reward mecha-
nism. ,e authors also found that punishment plays a
central role in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.
Compared with this article, in our blockchain game model,
we found that future revenue expectations will affect the
behavior of the blockchain.We also consider the influence of
the network model on the cooperation mechanism in the
blockchain.
5. Conclusion
We formulated the cooperation and defection behavioral
game in the blockchain system. Using evolutionary game
theory, we found the importance of reducing the profit
expectations of malicious participants in maintaining the
integrity of the ledger. When considering the influence of
network factors, it takes a long time to establish a co-
operative process within the blockchain. ,us, more at-
tention needs to be paid to the security protection of the
initial stage of the blockchain. ,ese findings provide
mechanism guidance for the security of the blockchain. A
safe and reliable system should be considered from the
most basic physical layer. We will start with the security
and credibility requirements of the physical layer and
design corresponding technologies and mechanisms,
enhance our game model, and construct a stable block-
chain mechanism.
