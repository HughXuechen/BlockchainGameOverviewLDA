Abstract—In proof-of-stake based consortium blockchain
networks, pre-selected miners compete to solve a crypto-puzzle
with a successfully mining probability proportional to the amount
of their stakes. When the puzzle is solved, the miners are encour-
aged to take part in mined block propagation for verification to
win a transaction fee from the blockchain user. The mined block
should be propagated over wired or wireless networks, and be
verified as quickly as possible to decrease consensus propagation
delay. In this letter, we study incentivizing the consensus prop-
agation considering the tradeoff between the network delay of
block propagation process and offered transaction fee from the
blockchain user. A Stackelberg game is then formulated to jointly
maximize utility of the blockchain user and individual profit of
the miners. The blockchain user acting as the leader sets the
transaction fee for block verification. The miners acting as the
followers decide on the number of recruited verifiers over wired
or wireless networks. We apply the backward induction to ana-
lyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium.
Performance evaluation validates the feasibility and efficiency of
the proposed game model in consensus propagation.

I. INTRODUCTION
RECENTLY, blockchain has been emerging as a promising
paradigm that enables trustless nodes/users to securely
interact with each other without relying on a trusted third party.
Blockchain provides immutable ledgers and decentralized plat-
forms for various practical scenarios [1]. Based on diverse
characteristics, blockchain networks can be categorized into
three main types: public, private and consortium blockchain
networks. A public blockchain network has better information

transparency and auditability due to no access limitation.
However, block mining and blocks synchronization among
all nodes incur high cost and long delay, and thus makes
public blockchain networks unsuitable for energy-limited and
time-sensitive scenarios. Private blockchain networks are only
accessed by a specific, limited organization and cannot be
widely adopted in diverse trading activities [1].
Compared with the above blockchain networks, recently,
consortium blockchain networks have attracted enormous
attention due to the advantages of modest cost, good scal-
ability and short delay [2]. The widely adopted consor-
tium blockchains denote the certain blockchains that apply
the proof-based consensus algorithms (e.g., proof-of-stake)
among a set of pre-selected miners to maintain the dis-
tributed ledger, in which the efficient consensus management
is achieved [1], [3]. In particular, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a
popular consensus algorithm requiring only mild cost and
computing power on mining competition. The probability of
winning a mining competition is determined by a miner’s
stake, since the difficulty level of the crypto-puzzle for each
miner is adjusted according to the amount of their stakes [3].
There are two major steps in consensus management for
PoS-based consortium blockchain networks: (i) mining step
and (ii) mined block propagation for verification step. The pre-
selected miners in PoS-based consortium blockchain networks
record new transactions from the blockchian user into a block,
and compete to solve a crypto-puzzle with a probability pro-
portional to the amount of their stakes in the mining step.
In the blockchain networks, the fastest miner finding a valid
nonce that meets the difficulty of the crypto-puzzle propagates
its mined block to other miners for verification over a wired
or wireless channel. If this mined block is finally added into
the blockchain, the miner will receive a mining reward for its
effort in the consensus management [3], [4].
However, due to the limited number of pre-selected miners
in consortium blockchain, the miners are encouraged to prop-
agate the mined block to more verifiers [2]. Recruiting more
verifiers can avoid centralized block verification and decrease
impacts of compromised verifiers leading to more reliable and
secure blockchain network [1], [5]. Additionally, some light-
weight nodes, e.g., nearby mobile devices with blockchain
clients [6], reachable quickly through wireless networks, can
also be the verifiers in consortium blockchain. These ver-
ifiers can form different verifier sets to finish verification.
Each miner needs to recruit its own verifiers to verify the
mined blocks. The block verification tasks are divided into
sub-tasks and assigned to pre-selected miners over the network
according to their individual number of recruited verifiers for
verification [7], [8]. When the mined block is verified to be
valid, the miners share the transaction fee according to their
verification contributions.
For the blockchain user, if its offered transaction fee is high
enough, the transaction records in mined blocks can be verified

by more verifiers [6], [7]. However, the more verifiers lead to a
costly and time-consuming consensus process due to the larger
block transmission cost and block verification processing and
network delay [5]. The blockchain user should strategically
set transaction fee to incentivize the miners and save the cost.
In this letter, we study the consensus propagation problem
and balance the tradeoff between the delay of propagation pro-
cess and the offered transaction fee from the blockchain user
in PoS-based consortium blockchain networks. We first model
the interaction among the blockchain user and miners as a
Stackelberg game, in order to jointly maximize the utility of
the blockchain user and the individual profit of miners. We
obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium and prove its existence and
uniqueness. Lastly, we present the numerical results to show
the efficiency of the game model.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
As illustrated in Fig. 1, there are three entities in the PoS-
based consortium blockchain network under our consideration:
1) blockchain users, 2) miners, and 3) verifiers. In this letter,
both miners in the blockchain network and mobile devices with
blockchain clients can be the verifiers [6]. A blockchain user
generates transaction records and periodically broadcasts the
transaction records to pre-selected miners in the network. The
miners put the issued transaction into a data block, and use
their own computing power to solve a crypto-puzzle accord-
ing to given parameters of the blockchain [3].1 Compared with
traditional proof-of-work, the difficulty level of crypto-puzzle
of PoS for each miner depends on the amount of their own
stakes. The more stake leads to a lower difficulty level [3].
Once a miner successfully solves the puzzle, the miners prop-
agate the puzzle result and the block data to their verifier sets
for verification. Each miner has its cooperative verifier set con-
sisted of a certain number of nearby verifiers [9]. The fastest
miner to finish the propagation can earn the mining reward R
in the consortium blockchain.
Similar to [8] and [10], each pre-selected miner in the con-
sortium blockchain is assigned a particular verification task
according to their own recruited verifiers. Thus, every miner
can share the given transaction fee, denoted as x, from the
blockchain user based on their verification contributions, i.e.,
the number of recruited verifiers. Moreover, there exists the
communication cost between the miner and verifiers due to
the block verification overhead.
B. Problem Formulation
We consider a consortium blockchain network with a group
of pre-selected miners (denoted by J = {1, . . . , y}) and large
1If there are multiple blockchain users submitting transactions at the same
time, the mining task for these transactions will be arranged in a queue
according to transaction fee, in which the conflict will not happen.
verifier sets cooperating with different miners (denoted by
V = {V1, . . . , Vi}, i ∈ J). Each miner decides on the ratio of
recruited verifiers in its cooperative verifier set for verification.
Let R = {r1, . . . , ri} denote the strategy profiles consisting
of all miners’ strategies. The strategy represents the ratio of
recruited verifiers in cooperative verifier sets. So the number of
recruited verifiers for each miner i ∈ J is ri |Vi |, wherein |Vi |
is cardinality of set Vi . The probability of winning a mining
competition for miner i depends on the mining contribution,
which is expressed by Pm = �e−λzT [4], where � is the pro-
portional value between individual stake and total stakes in
the consortium blockchain. We use a random variable follow-
ing a Poisson process with the mean value of λ = 1/600 to
model the occurrence of solving the crypto-puzzle [4]. z > 0
is a given delay factor, and T is the number of transactions
in the mined block. The profit function of miner i consists of
1) expected revenue obtained from mining and mined block
verification, 2) incurred communication cost due to overhead
of verification, and 3) a pre-defined electricity and other costs
of mining ci , which is formulated as follows:
U i
m = l1RPm + l2x
ri |Vi |∑
j∈J
rj
∣
∣Vj
∣
∣ − αi ri |Vi | − ci . (1)
l1 and l2 represent the weight factors of expected rev-
enue obtained from mining and verification, respectively,
and l1 + l2 = 1. R denotes the fixed token reward issued
by the blockchain system and RPm is the obtained token
reward according to the mining contribution of miner i in the
consortium blockchain. x ri |Vi |∑
j∈J
rj |Vj | represents the obtained
transaction fee of miner i according to its verification contri-
bution, i.e., the number of recruited verifiers, ri |Vi |, for mined
block verification. Note that communication between the miner
and its recruited verifiers can be through a wired or wireless
connection, which incurs a certain communication cost (e.g.,
bandwidth resource) during mined block propagation [11].
Thus, we use αi (ri |Vi |) to represent the communication
cost, where αi > 0 is a given average communication cost
coefficient.
The utility of the blockchain user includes expected satis-
faction and incentive cost, i.e., the transaction fee, as follows:
Us = f [r1, r2, . . . , ri ; τ1(r1), τ2(r2), . . . , τi (ri )] − x , (2)
where τi (ri ) is the mined block propagation time for
miner i ∈ J. f [r1, r2, . . . , ri ; τ1(r1), τ2(r2), . . . , τi (ri )]
is the satisfaction function with respect to the ratio
of recruited verifiers in verifier set. Similar to that
in [12], we consider a general and realistic assumption
that f [r1, r2, . . . , ri ; τ1(r1), τ2(r2), . . . , τi (ri )] is a strictly
concave function in variables r1, r2, . . . , ri . Moreover,
f [0, 0, . . . , 0; τ1(0), τ2(0), . . . , τi (0)] = 0. This satisfaction
function is also monotonically increasing in each ri, i ∈ J.
The miners may have different block propagation time
owing to the different number of recruited verifiers for verifica-
tion. In the mined block propagation step, the time needed for
a block to reach a consensus is determined by both the trans-
mission delay, τ i
p , and the block verification time, τ i
v , among
the recruited verifiers. For a mined block of size b, the aver-
age time for reaching a consensus, i.e., the block propagation
time, is denoted as: τi (ri ) = τ i
p +τ i
v = bri |Vi |
δk1
+k2ri |Vi |b [7].
k1 > 0 and k2 > 0 are coefficients given by the system. δ is
the average effective channel link capacity of communication
connection between miners and verifiers. Similar to that in [7],
ri|Vi |/k1 represents the network scale parameter and k2ri|Vi |

represents the parameter determined by both the network scale
and the average verification speed of the verifiers. The utility
of the blockchain user is affected by both the satisfaction level
in terms of block propagation delay and the offered transac-
tion fee. The more verifiers lead to a more secure blockchain
network [5]. However, this also results in the larger block
propagation time since the miners may need to communicate
with some verifiers that are not close through multi-hop relays.
Thus, in the following, we define a security-delay metric si to
balance the network scale (i.e., the number of recruited ver-
ifiers) and the block propagation time for miner i, which is
expressed by
si =
m1(ri |Vi |)q
m2
τi
Tmax
=
m1k1δTmax
bm2(1 + k1k2δ)
× (ri |Vi |)q−1, (3)
where m1 > 0 and m2 > 0 are coefficients given by the
system. Tmax denotes the maximum value of tolerant block
propagation time of the blockchain user. q ≥ 2 is a given factor
indicating the network scale. In what follows, we consider
q =2 for ease of presentation [5]. We rewrite Eqn. (2) as
follows:
Us = f (s1, s2, . . . , si ) − x . (4)
The interaction between the blockchain user and miners can
be formulated as a Stackelberg game, where the blockchain
user is the leader and the miners are the followers [13]. In
Stage I, the blockchain user determines transaction fee to
pay to miners, and the miners respond with the best ratio of
recruited verifiers in Stage II according to the transaction fee.
Note that a rational miner will not take part in the mining
process with a negative profit. Therefore, the transaction fee
offered by the blockchain user is assumed to be bigger than
a minimum value denoted as xmin. Specifically, the objective
functions for the leader and followers are expressed as follows:
Leader:max
x
Us(x),
s.t. x > xmin.
Followers:max

s.t. 1 ≥ ri ≥ 0. (5)
III. GAME EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
We employ the backward induction method to analyze the
Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game [2].2 Given the
transaction fee x decided by the blockchain user, the miners
compete to maximize their individual utilities by choos-
ing their ratios of recruited verifiers in verifier sets, which
forms a noncooperative Miners’ Verification Game (MVG)
Gm = {J, R, {U i
m}i∈J}, where J is the set of miners, R is
the strategy set of miners, and U i
m is the profit function of
miner i.
Definition 1: A set of strategy profiles Rne =
{rne

i } is the Nash equilibrium of the MVG
Gm = {J, R, {U i
m}i∈J}, if, for ∀i ∈ J, U i
m(rne
i , Rne−j , x ) ≥
2We can utilize a Bayesian game to analyze the game behavior among min-
ers with incomplete information. According to the Bayesian game theory, an
incomplete game can be divided into different complete games corresponding
to various miner type combinations, which are subjected to the joint prob-
ability distribution. Each miner maximizes its expected profit function by
scheduling ratio of recruited verifiers with the consideration of other min-
ers’ recruited strategies. An iterative algorithm can be designed to obtain the
equilibrium according to [4], when the miners do not know others’ strategies.
Due to the limited space, we only discuss the complete information case and
provide the closed-form expression of Nash equilibrium in this letter.
U i
m(ri , Rne−j , x ) for ri ≥ 0, where Rne−j represents the Nash
equilibrium set excluding rj .
Theorem 1: A Nash Equilibrium exists in MVG Gm =
{J, R, {U i
m}i∈J} [4].
Proof: By differentiating U i
m defined in Eqn. (1) with
respect to ri , we have ∂U i

and ∂2U i

< 0. Where J−j represents a group of miners
excluding j. Noted that U i
m is a strictly concave function with
respect to ri . Therefore, given any x > 0 and any strategy
profile Rne−j of the other miners, the best response strategy
of miner i is unique when ri ≥ 0. Accordingly, the Nash
equilibrium exists in the noncooperative MVG Gm .
Furthermore, we obtain the optimal strategy denoted as r∗i
by solving ∂U i

When x ≤ αi
l2
∑
j∈J−i
rj |Vj |, we set r∗i = 0, since miner i
does not participate in block verification to avoid a deficit in
this case [12]. Thus, the minimum value of transaction fee
for the blockchain user is xmin = max(αi
l2
∑
j∈J−i
rj |Vj |),
where max(·) is the maximum element in the set of
{αi

obtain

where |J| is cardinality of set J.
According to the above analysis, the blockchain user knows
that the miners can achieve a unique Nash equilibrium for any
x > xmin [12]. Therefore, the blockchain user can maximize
its utility given in Eqn. (4) by choosing the optimal transaction
fee x∗, which is characterized by Theorem 2. In particular, by
substituting Eqn. (6) into Eqn. (3), we have
Us = f [

Theorem 2: There exists a unique Stackelberg Equilibrium
(x∗, rne
i ) in the noncooperative Stackelberg game, i.e.,
Eqn. (5), where x∗ is the unique maximizer of the blockchain
user’s utility in Eqn. (7) when x > xmin, and rne
i is given by
Eqn. (6) with x∗.
Proof: Note that f [r1, r2, . . . , ri ; τ1(r1), τ2(r2), . . . , τi (ri )]
is a strictly concave function in variables r1, r2, . . . , ri ,
f (s1, s2, . . . , si ) is also a strictly concave function. Hence,
the utility Us in Eqn. (7) is a strictly concave function of
x for x ∈ (xmin,∞). The value of Us given in Eqn. (7)
is −max(αi

∑
j∈J−i

approaches −∞ when x goes to ∞. There exists a unique
maximum value of Us when x = x∗ in Eqn. (7), which can
be calculated through bisection method [12]. Therefore, the
unique Stackelberg Equilibrium (x∗, rne
i ) in the noncoopera-
tive Stackelberg game can be achieved.

x [12]. It is easy to show that ∂2Us
∂x2 < 0, so it is a
concave function that satisfies the assumptions in Section II
and analytical result in Section III. We evaluate performance
of the proposed game with varied number of verifiers and
different variation ranges of communication cost. We con-
sider a blockchain network with verifiers in the range of
[100, 800] [4]. The communication cost between miners and
verifiers varies from 300 to 335 [5], and follows a uniform dis-
tribution. More parameter settings are shown in Table I mostly
adopted from [4] and [7].
As shown in Fig. 2(a), we compare the total number of
participating verifiers, i.e., |J|. The total number of participat-
ing verifiers is decreasing when the communication cost has
bigger variation range. Here, the variation range is the differ-
ence between the maximum and minimum of communication
cost for miners. Fig. 2(b) shows that bigger variation range
of communication cost brings lower utility of the blockchain
user when there are 800 verifiers in the blockchain network.
We randomly choose miner i with a mining probability
Pm = 1/800 and the maximum of random communication
cost in the range of [300, 310], i.e., αi = 309.8632, and thus
evaluate its profit with respect to the total number of partic-
ipating verifiers in Fig. 3(a). The profit of miner i decreases
when the total number of participating verifiers increases due
to more intensive competitions among the verifiers. Moreover,
the profit of miner i in our proposed game is significantly
higher than that in the baseline scheme that each miner has the
same number of recruited verifiers. The reason is that all min-
ers can maximize their profits through calculating individual
optimal number of recruited verifiers.
Fig. 3(b) shows the computation time of our proposed
game. The running time is linear-like increasing when the
number of verifiers increases. The optimal strategies of par-
ticipating verifiers for miners can be efficiently calculated
according to Eqn. (6). In summary, according to the results,
our proposed Stackelberg game is effective and efficient for
consensus propagation in blockchain networks.
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we have focused on the consensus propagation
problem in PoS based consortium blockchain networks. We
have addressed this problem considering the tradeoff between
delay of block propagation process and offered transaction
fee from a blockchain user. A Stackelberg game has been
developed to jointly maximize the profit of the miners and
the utility of the blockchain user. Thereafter, the existence
and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium have been vali-
dated. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed
game is feasible and efficient for consensus propagation. In
future work, we will investigate the wireless communication
cost affected by channel quality and fading, and network
congestion.
