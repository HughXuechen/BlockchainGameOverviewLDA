Abstract—Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly
increasing in various domains such as disaster management, de-
livery of goods, surveillance, military, etc. Significant issues in
the expansion of UAV-based applications are the security of (IoT
to UAV) communication, and the limited flight time of the UAVs
and IoT devices considering the limited battery power. Standalone
UAVs are not capable of accomplishing several tasks, and therefore
swarm of UAVs is being explored. Security issues in the swarm of
UAVs do not allow the applications to leverage the full benefits that
one can offer. Several recent studies have proposed the use of a
distributed network of UAVs to upgrade the level of security in the
swarm of UAVs. In this paper, a framework for secure and reliable
energy trading among UAVs and charging stations is presented.
Advanced blockchain, based on the tangle data structure is used
to create a distributed network of UAVs and charging stations.
The proposed model allows the UAVs to buy energy from the
charging station in exchange for tokens. If the UAV does not have
sufficient tokens to buy the energy, then the model allows the UAV
to borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens
can be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees.
A game-theoretic model is used for deciding the buying strategy
of energy for UAVs. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed
model helps in providing increased utility for the swarm of UAVs
and charging stations in a secure and cost-optimal way as compared
to the conventional schemes. The results can eventually be applied
to IoT devices that constantly need energy to perform under ideal
conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
THERE has been a paradigm shift from manual work to
automation in almost all domains of engineering in re-
cent years [1], [2]. The use of UAVs has been instrumental in
bringing this shift. For example, UAV’s are being used in varied
applications such as healthcare, military, surveillance, disaster

management, etc. [3], [4], [5]. However, there are very few ap-
plications that are actually using UAVs to perform real-time and
scalable tasks [6]. This is on account of the various fundamental
issues related to using UAVs in real-life applications. The first
and foremost issue is the limited flight time of the UAV, which
is due to limited battery storage capacity [7]. The battery size
in UAVs cannot be increased due to the weight limitations.
If the weight of the UAV is large, it becomes difficult to fly
the UAV at high altitude and for a long duration [8]. Various
works have proposed the use of a swarm of UAVs instead
of a standalone UAV for various applications [9]. Although
the swarm of UAVs shows various benefits over standalone
UAVs, the security issues in the swarm of UAVs are much
higher than in the case of a single UAV [10], [11]. For longer
flights or missions, UAVs require time to time charging. In such
situations, UAVs can avail the service of intermediate charging
stations [12], [13]. The traditional way of energy trading between
UAVs and charging station is highly inefficient if the UAVs are
used in a large number. In the traditional system, all the charging
stations act in a standalone mode, and the UAVs are also not
aware of the current energy availability at a particular charging
station [14]. UAVs need energy at the minimum possible cost
and in minimum possible time. This requires a strong peer
to peer communication between the UAVs and the charging
stations [15]. Therefore, few recent works propose the use of
a distributed network of charging stations and UAVs. Some of
the works in recent years have focused on the use of blockchain
for UAV to UAV communication [16], [17]. Blockchain is a DLT
(Distributed Ledger Technology) that allows secure peer to peer
transactions among multiple entities that are in different geo-
graphical locations [18], [19]. Blockchain technology creates
an immutable distributed ledger of all the transactions between
the different nodes of the network [20], [21]. Every node can
view all the transactions that are committed in the chain, but
no node can tamper or change the data that is committed in the
chain [22], [23].
Although blockchain proves to be highly efficient in cre-
ating a distributed network for energy trading among UAVs
and charging stations, there are few fundamental limitations of
blockchain that limit the use of this technology in such appli-
cations. Blockchain algorithm suffers from some fundamental
drawbacks such as the latency of transaction confirmation, the
scalability limitations, and the probabilistic nature of consensus
algorithms [32], [33]. The consensus algorithm used in the

blockchain is also very power-hungry [34]. Micro-transactions
cannot be added in generic blockchain as the incentive given
to the miners for such transactions ends up to be higher than
the actual transaction value. Processing fees of transactions
are increasingly high, and the size of the block is constrained,
thereby limiting the use of generic blockchain for a large number
of small transactions. Various works propose the use of other
consensus algorithms such as Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of
Burn (POB), or Proof of Elapsed Time (POET) to overcome the
limitations of the generic blockchain. However, all these con-
sensus algorithms follow the Proof of Work (POW) algorithm.
A new distributed application cannot be created using the POS
consensus process as none of the nodes in the network has any
stake or cryptocurrency to put on stake. In this paper, we propose
a novel application of a distributed network of charging stations
and UAVs based on advanced blockchain or IOTA. IOTA is a
type of DLT that uses a tangle data structure to store transactions.
IOTA based DLT is equally secure and distributed as traditional
blockchain, but at the same time, it provides low latency and con-
sumes very less power as compared to generic blockchain [35].
Unlike normal blockchain, IOTA-based blockchain ledger does
not have any miners to process transactions [36]. There is no
transaction fee involved in IOTA, and micro-transactions are
also possible. Following are the major contributions presented
in this paper:
� A distributed network of charging stations and UAVs is
proposed where they can interact and negotiate for charge
price over the network. An IOTA based consensus is used
to reach an agreement among the nodes in the network.
� UAVs are allowed to trade for energy with the charging
station in exchange for tokens based on their immediate
needs. If the UAV does not have sufficient tokens to buy
the energy, then the model allows the UAV to borrow tokens
from the charging station.
� The borrowed tokens can be repaid back to the charging
station with interest or late fees. The charging stations are
also allowed to vary the late fees based on the time of
repayment to enhance their revenue.
� A game-theoretic model is proposed to parallely enhance
the utility and revenue of both the UAV and the charging
stations.
� Simulation of the proposed model is implemented, and the
numerical analysis is presented to prove that the proposed
model is better than the traditional scheme.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the recent related work in the area of UAV charging.

tributed network for energy trading between UAVs and charging
stations. Section IV presents some prelims and background

II. RELATED WORK
In this section, a survey of all the existing literature related
to UAV charging are presented along with their advantages and
limitations. Myung Jae Shin et al. [29] present a framework
based on machine learning and auction mechanism for schedul-
ing energy requirements for a network of drones.
Nowadays, machine learning-based models are also used in
UAVs in different ways. Based on the predictions made by the
machine learning algorithms, an auction model is designed to
allow the drones to bid for the energy. Authors in [26], present a
collaborative scheme for choosing the station for drone charging.
All the flying drones send their energy request to the cloud server,
and the cloud decides about the allocation of UAVs to charging
stations. The limitation of the model is that it is completely
centralized, and all the activities of the UAVs are completely
dependent on the decisions coming from the central cloud server.
This would result in lot of latency that could be an issue in various
critical applications of UAVs such as use of drones for healthcare
and medicine delivery.
David Dominique et al. [25], present a contract based UAV
charging system. The UAV is allowed to land on the charging
pad in the designated position of orientation. The charging cost
for the UAV and the revenue of the charging stations are not
considered. Authors of [30] focus on reducing the route traveled
by the UAVs for delivery, rather than increasing the flight time.
The authors use the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) to
calculate the minimum possible route for delivery. Fundamental
features of the TSP are analyzed, and route distortion is defined.
Haider Mahmood Jawad et al. [37] focuses on the use of
UAVs in agricultural applications. Electromagnetic induction
(EM) is used to charge the drones on the fly to increase their
flight time and communication distance. A magnetic resonant
coupling technique is used as it allows high transfer power and
helps in minimizing the energy loss in transit. Authors of [27]
provide a detailed review of all the different wireless charging
techniques being used for charging the UAVs on the fly. A de-
tailed comparison of the working, advantages, and limitations of
each technique is presented by the authors. Chiuk Song et al. [28]
propose the ways of reducing the electromagnetic interference
in wireless charging of UAVs. Strong electromagnetic fields are
generated while transferring the energy from source to battery.
Such fields might also deliver strong electric currents to the
end-users.
Sheng Zhang et al. [24] propose a model for flexible wireless
charging. The authors consider that the energy demand for UAVs
is not always consistent and might change based on various
factors. The fluctuations in energy consumption are considered,
and an itinerary selection and charging association algorithm
is proposed. Roberto G. Ribeiro et al. [31] proposes the use of
UAVs in the mining industry. The periodic inspection of disasters
in mines is a very important and difficult task. Drones can be used
to inspect the leakage or other issues in mines. Solar-powered

drones cannot be used in mines due to the unavailability of solar
energy. High flight time is also required to perform an effective
inspection. The authors propose a concise mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) model for charging station planning and
drone routing.
There are several works that focus on enhancing the capabil-
ities of UAVs in multiple domains. These works also focus on
using the latest technologies to increase the overall battery life
and flight time for the drones. However, most of these works use
a centralized server or third-party cloud services to manage UAV
communication. Moreover, there are very few works that focus
on reducing the cost of UAV charging and increasing the revenue
of the charging stations simultaneously. Centralized approaches
are highly susceptible to data thefts and also act as a single point
of failure. Existing literature lacks the concept of a distributed
network of charging stations and UAVs where the nodes can
securely request for energy and can negotiate or decide the
price for charging. Furthermore, in existing literature, the price
charged by the charging stations is considered as fixed. This
restricts the charging stations from varying the price to increase
their revenue. Therefore, we propose a distributed framework
for UAV charging that is fair, cost-optimal, accurate, and secure.
Additionally, we consider factors like dynamic pricing offered
by the charging stations according to different use cases, which
is discussed in the later section of the paper.
III. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Fig. 1 shows the steps involved in a distributed network for
energy trading between charging stations and UAVs. Initially,
after the charging stations and UAVs join the network, they
start with an information exchange process. These messages are
recorded on the IOTA tangle.
1) The first box shows the first step where the message
passing or information exchange takes place between the
charging stations and the UAVs. These messages include
the information about charge requirement, criticality, a
cost that drone is willing to pay, etc.
2) The second box shows the tangle creation to securely
store the information that is being exchanged between
the charging stations and the UAVs. All the messages
encrypted and digitally signed to prevent the issues related
to data integrity and non-repudiation.
3) The third box shows the possibility of energy trading in the
peer-to-peer network between UAVs and charging stations
in exchange for IOTA tokens without any intermediary or
centralized controlling authority.
4) The fourth box shows that all the UAVs in the IOTA
network acquire a minimum number of IOTA tokens to
buy energy from the charging stations. If the UAVs do not
have enough tokens, then they borrow IOTA tokens form
the charging stations based on game theory.
5) The fifth box shows the occurrence of negotiations be-
tween UAVs and charging stations based on optimal price
formulation strategy discussed in section VII.
6) The sixth box finally shows the actual allocation of a UAV
to a charging station for energy trading.
IV. BACKGROUND AND IOTA PRELIMS
In the distributed network of charging stations and UAVs,
the IOTA tangle is used to record and to process the large

number of frequent micro-transactions. Tangle is a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) based distributed ledger [35]. Fee-less
micro-transactions, asset transfer, and trusted identities are some
of the features provided by the IOTA tangle. All the UAVs
and charging stations act as nodes when they are connected to
the IOTA network. All the UAVs can borrow energy from the
charging station based on their energy requirements to increase
their flight time. This process could be done without involving
any centralized third party. The UAVs can buy energy from
nearby charging stations when required [38], [39]. Next, we
discuss a few prelims required to understand the proposed model
and the solution framework.
A. Digital Identity
Digital identity is one of the important building blocks for any
distributed ledger technology [40], [41]. The level of trust among
the parties involved in energy transactions is ensured by their
digital identity [42]. The security of a large amount of user data
that is growing at a tremendous rate is often compromised when
centralized and traditional identification methods are used [43].
A better alternative is the use of a verified digital identity stored
on a distributed ledger. Also, the fees charged by the third parties
that provide authentication and verification services are saved by
using digital identity verification methods [44].
B. Tip Selection Algorithm
In the traditional blockchain, computing power is a major
factor for verifying whether the user is making an authentic
transaction or not [45], [46]. Miners are used for validating
and adding new transactions in the next block. The task of
mining is done by the new transactions in the IOTA tangle. All
the nodes present in the network directly or indirectly approve
the new transactions. This makes the participating nodes and the
miner indistinct. This also prevents distributed denial of service
(DDOS) attacks to the IOTA network as all nodes are equivalent,
and no node has some special privilege. Any new transaction
that enters in the tangle is required to select and approve two
previous transactions. An edge is created between the selected
transactions and the newly added transaction. The new transac-
tion requires to solve a cryptographic puzzle to be approved as
a transaction. Then the new transaction waits for its approval
by the other upcoming transaction. A tip is used to refer to an
unapproved transaction in a directed acyclic graph. The process
of tip getting validated by the new transactions is decided by the
tip-selection algorithm [35]. Therefore, tip-selection algorithms
and the rate at which new transactions are added in the tangle
decide transaction confirmation latency.
A rating is given to each transaction initiated by any node
in the network using the tip selection algorithm. The rating
is equal to the number of transactions that reference it. The
transaction is considered important if its weight is larger than
other transactions in the network. To select two non-conflicting
tips for the verification of the newly arrived transaction is the aim
of the tip selection algorithm used in IOTA. For any transaction
X , the cumulative weight CWX is defined as the own weight
plus weight of transaction that approves it. For example if
X2, X3, X4, . . .XN are the transactions that approve X1. The
weight of X1 is WX1 and weight of X2, X3, X4, . . .., XN is
WX2 ,WX3 ,WX4 , . . ..,WXN
respectively, then
CWXα
=
α∑
a=1
Xa +
N∑
b=α+c
Xb (1)
where, Xa be any event that approves event Xα directly and Xb
be any event that approves event Xα indirectly.
C. Consensus Mechanism
For every distributed ledger technology, it is imperative to
generate a level of trust among the nodes for the authenticity
of the transactions [47]. The cumulative weight of the transac-
tions calculated above is used to reach consensus in IOTA as
compared to the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm in a traditional
blockchain [48], [49]. Consensus finality is referred to as a
final agreement among all the network nodes. Blockchain never
reaches consensus finality due to the issues of forking and
pruning. In the generic blockchain, a block that is mined today
or a transaction that is added to the main chain today, might
get pruned and removed from the main chain after some time.
There is no surety that the current transactions will remain in the
main chain forever or not. Therefore, generic blockchain never
reaches consensus finality. This is not the case in the consensus
process followed in the IOTA network. In IOTA, when almost
every participant present in the IOTA network declares that a
particular transaction is more valid than other transactions, then
consensus is achieved. In IOTA, the consensus is distributed
in the tangle, and the participant is required to validate two
past transactions for placing one’s own new transaction in the
network, as discussed above.
Apart from securing IOTA from the tip selection algorithm
and cumulative weight-based consensus mechanism, a new se-
curity layer has been added to the IOTA consensus protocol to
overcome the issue of conflicting tips. This security measure is
a voting-based mechanism called as a shimmer. The traditional
voting mechanism cannot automatically scale if the number of
nodes in the network increases. Also, each node is required
to know the other nodes in the network in case of traditional
voting-based algorithms. In the shimmer algorithm, the peers
tend to change their state based on the state of other peers and
do not need to know the state of all the nodes in the network.
D. Transaction Procedure
Every charging station and the UAV has its own pseudo-
anonymous, virtual, and private wallet, which stores IOTA to-
kens used for making transactions [50], [51]. The user has to
create a secret password called seed (a string of 81 trytes) for
using IOTA as a network [52]. IOTA is based on trinary or ternary
computing. Trit is a digit in a base 3 (0 or 1 or 2). Tryte consists
of 3 trit. It can be in one of 27 states consisting of 26 uppercase
alphabets or digit 9. Each seed can create 957 addresses and
private keys using the IOTA address generation algorithm. Since
it is public, users can send messages and tokens to other users
using the address field in the transaction. Bundles are signed
using unique private keys, for withdrawing IOTA tokens from
address.

V. PROPOSED SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, the complete system model is discussed, along
with the roles of different components present in the IOTA
network. The purpose of the proposed model is to balance the
supply and demand of the energy required to charge the UAVs.
The model focuses on increasing the overall flight time of the
UAVs. A game-theoretic model is used to perform energy trading
in a cost-optimal way.
A. Components of Proposed Energy Trading Model
1) Energy Nodes: A node can be either of UAV (buyer) or a
charging station (seller). The UAV must have a minimum amount
of IOTA tokens to buy energy from the charging station. If the
UAV does not have the minimum amount of tokens, then it can
borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens
need to be repaid back to charging stations with interest or late
fees imposed by the charging station.
2) Energy Aggregator: The smart contract in the IOTA net-
work acts as an energy aggregator. The work of the smart contract
is that of a broker or a mediator between a buyer and a seller node.
It helps in setting up a communication between two parties who
want to share energy. The buyer and the seller interact directly
via a smart contract without the presence of a third-party broker.
3) Smart Meters: Smart meters will incorporate the proposed
pricing algorithm by considering the details such as energy
already present in the account, amount of energy being traded
and the charging price. The charging price and amount of energy
being traded between UAV and charging station is according
the the values calculated by the smart meter, as an intermediate
broker.
B. Working of Proposed Energy Trading Model
In this section, various steps involved in the energy trading
process are discussed step by step.
1) System Framework and Entry of Nodes in a Network: The
users are registered on the IOTA network, and each user after
registration becomes a unique entity node. Each node with a
unique ID gets its public and private keys. Every node obtains a
set of wallet addresses, and the distributed ledger stores all the
information regarding energy requests and trading in mapping
lists. Wallet addresses contain energy coins, and IOTA tangle
stores all the transaction records of UAVs and charging stations.
As discussed above, the wallet addresses are given to the nodes
by the IOTA network as soon as they enter the network and
desire to perform transactions. There are charging stations that
act as energy suppliers for the UAVs. The UAV’s are allowed
to enter the network to trade energy with the charging station in
exchange of IOTA tokens. If the UAV does not have sufficient
tokens, then it can borrow tokens from the charging station to
buy the required energy. The borrowed tokens are later repaid
to the charging station with interest or late fees imposed by the
charging station. The UAV that is neither willing to purchase the
energy nor willing to borrow the tokens and does not have the
minimum threshold amount of energy is not allowed to enter the
network. This will act as a checkpoint to ensure that only the
nodes satisfying the above-mentioned criteria enter the network,
and the network is not flooded by more number of nodes.
2) Different Roles in Energy Trading Network: There are
many nodes in the network which act either as a buyer node
(UAVs) or a seller node (charging station). The energy-deficient
UAVs buy the energy from the charging station in exchange for
IOTA tokens. The token deficient UAVs can first borrow the
tokens from the charging station and can then buy the energy in
exchange for the borrowed tokens. The borrowed tokens need to
be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees.
3) Exchange of Energy Between Buyers and Sellers: A smart
contract’s exchange function is responsible for all the trans-
actions in IOTA. It takes a few parameters, like the address
of the buyer and the amount of energy it wants to buy. The
smart contract matches the buyer’s (UAVs) requirements with
the sellers present in the seller pool based on the charging price
and late fees imposed by the seller (charging station).
4) Payment Security Plus Incentives and Rewards: The
UAVs in the network after each transaction get the updated data
of new seller nodes and information about the energy available
with the new seller. Each transaction needs to be signed with a
digital signature of the initiator.
5) Hashing in Energy Trading: For verification, each event
or transaction carries a hash of the previous transaction as is done
in the traditional blockchain [53]. This makes the transactions
in the network tamper-free and immutable.
VI. GAME THEORY IN ENERGY TRADING MODEL
In the proposed energy trading model, UAVs act as buyers,
and charging stations act as the sellers. The role of the charging
station is to feed the energy in the UAVs. Each UAV has access
to these charging stations, which have enough IOTA tokens.
UAVs need to have sufficient IOTA tokens to request for energy.
The charging stations provide IOTA tokens to the UAVs, which
makes them capable of purchasing the energy from the charging
station [54]. Energy trading between UAVs and charging stations
is done depending on the present balance of tokens with the
UAV and its previous transaction history. On-demand of UAVs,
sufficient tokens are transferred from the charging station to the
UAV’s wallet address. UAVs can also request for the energy from
the charging station in exchange for the tokens that they already
have. In this section, the various steps and scenarios in energy
and token trading among the nodes in the network are discussed.
A. Request for Tokens from Charging Station
Initially, a UAV Di (an IOTA node that is in need of tokens)
sends a request to the charging station and waits for an acknowl-
edgment from the charging station. The detailed steps followed
in the process of getting the tokens are discussed as follows.
1) Di sends a request message along with other information
about its own account address IDi, all previously used
transaction history Hi,k
K
k=1, number of tokens requested
amounti and available number of tokens crediti to the
charging station Cj .
Di → Cj : requesti = IDi ‖ Hi,k
K
k=1 ‖ amounti ‖
crediti

5396 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 69, NO. 5, MAY 2020
2) After charging station gets the requesti from UAV, it ver-
ifies the UAV’s identity and previous transaction history
from Hi,k
K
k=1 to check the UAV’s account status.
3) The message “TokenSharingSuccess” is obtained only
to that UAV Di who is able to fulfill certain following
necessary requirements:
a) There is a sufficient amount of crediti, which must be
a positive amount.
b) The account must be active and should have success-
fully completed the recent transactions with charging sta-
tions. The request is rejected if the UAV fails to complete
the previous transactions.
4) A shared wallet SWtl is created between charging station
Cj and UAV Di. The public and private keys are sent to
UAV Di. The charging station and UAV both have access
to the shared walletSWtl. The shared wallet can be further
reused for other transactions between charging station Cj
and UAV Di.
5) If all the requirements are fulfilled from UAV’s side,
then Di receives a “TokenRequestSuccess” message
Mi along with message signature MSign as a reply from
charging station Cj which indicates that the UAV Di is
eligible for tokens.
Cj → Di : responsej = SWtl ‖ Mi ‖ MSign ‖
T imestamp
where, Mi = amountj ‖ statusi ‖ ti ‖ PRi
Here, Mi includes some information like amount
amounti, current wallet status statusi, repay time du-
ration ti in which UAV has to repay the tokens to charging
station and otherwise it has to pay a late fee xi, and
previous records of repayment PRi.
B. Energy Trading Using Borrowed Tokens
UAV Di can now obtain the tokens from the shared wallet
SWtl for energy trading. All payments made via SWtl wallet
will get verified and recorded by the charging stationCj . The en-
crypted value of the token data is also added inPRi by the charg-
ing stations. Following steps further, elaborate on the procedure:
1) The UAV Di sends the acknowledgment of received to-
kens along with the “TokenReceivedSuccess” message
Mj , message signature MSign to charging station Cj .
Then charging station Cj verifies the certification as well
as validates the duration of the wallet SWtl used for
payment.
2) The charging stationCj records information attached with
a digital signature of this trade in the network such as the
bill, the “TokenRequestSuccess” message Mi, address
of wallet which is to receive the tokens.
3) The charging stationCj will compare the received success
messageMj with the original success message in its record
for verification via decryption technique. The charging
station then checks the status statusi of this Mj . If the
UAV Di has sufficient funds, then required tokens are
transferred through the shared wallet SWpl to charging
stationCj . If it is not the case, a message is sent to charging
station Cj stating “NotEnoughFunds.”
C. Repayment of IOTA Tokens
After a certain duration of IOTA tokens shared by Cj , UAV
Di is encountered with a new message Mnew
i with repayment
information based on the following possibilities.
1) First Possibility: If the UAV Di repays its tokens within
repayment time ti, then Di is charged with a certain amount of
interest yi along with the principal amount.
2) Second Possibility: If UAV Di is not able to repay the
charging station Cj within time ti, then credit-status of UAV
will further degrade. The new credit-status value for the UAV
will be updated as:
creditin+1 = creditin − (q ∗ amounti) (2)
where creditin denotes nth transaction’s value of the credit, and
q is a predefined constant greater than 0. The charging station
generates a transaction record about this process, and adds to the
address pool and appeared to the network. So, even if the UAV
Di finally finishes paying the tokens, it still experiences a fine
amount.
3) Third Possibility: In the case when UAV, Di is not able
to repay the charging station’s tokens for a considerably long
period, then the charging station will put that particular UAV
into the blacklist. This ensures that nodes in the future will not
cooperate with this UAV for energy trading.
VII. OPTIMAL PRICE FORMULATION
In this section, an optimal energy trading algorithm is pro-
posed to increase the token revenue of both the UAVs and the
charging stations. The proposed formulation also encourages
energy trading among UAVs and charging stations by optimizing
the various parameters such as rate of interest yi, late fee xi,
and amount of tokens shared [55]. The UAVs with insufficient
tokens, borrow the required tokens from charging stations. UAVs
likewise need to boost their profitability by asking the appropri-
ate token amount. Similarly, the charging stations trade IOTA
tokens and charge with interest rate of yi and late fees xi in a
way that enhances their revenue.
A. Problem Formulation
The energy given by a charging station Cj to UAV Di is
denoted as Ai. The minimum energy demand for UAV Di is
denoted as Qmin
i and pi is a given cost of the energy requested
by UAV Di. The fulfillment capacity of UAV Di is indicated as:
uf = di ln
(
Ai
pi
−Qmin
i + φi
)
(3)
where, di>0 and φi>0 are the factors predefined for UAV Di.
The utility of Di is defined as:
ui = σi (uf − yjAiti)− (1 − σi)xjAi (4)
where σi is repayment capacity of a UAV Di, i.e., its ability to
repay the tokens in assigned time ti. The records of previous
transactions comprise of token repayment record denoted by
RPi(s, f), where s denotes the number of times that UAV Di
repaid tokens successfully within repayment time, and f is

the number of failures in repaying the tokens. The repayment
capacity σi of a UAV Di can be defined as the number of times
that UAV repaid tokens successfully (s) upon total number of
transactions between UAV Di and charging station Ci (s+ f ).
The value of σi can be calculated with the help of token repay-
ment record RPi(s, f) for UAV Di as follows.
0 < σi =
(
s
s+ f
)
≤ 1 (5)
The value of yj refers to the extra tokens charged by the
charging station Cj as interest based on the time ti for which
the UAV was allowed to use the tokens. The xj denotes the fine
amount, i.e., late fee given by the UAV Di in case of delay in
repayment. The late fee xj given by the UAVDi is defined as the
difference between the time at which UAV Di made repayment
and time given by charging station Cj to UAV Di to repay
the tokens, multiplied with the interest rate yj at which UAV
Di borrowed tokens form charging station Cj for time ti. The
correlation between the value of yj and xj is given as follows.
xj = ηi ∗ (Ti − ti) ∗ yj (6)
where Ti is the time at which the UAVDi made token repayment
to charging station Cj and ηi >1 is a predefined constant.
The utility of the charging station comprises of the extra
tokens charged from UAV Di as interest, and fine amount if
Di can’t repay the requested tokens in time ti. The overhead of
charging station is given by
Ψj = Ai ∗ ti ∗ ci (7)
Here, ci is the unit cost of tokens requested by UAV Di from
the charging station. Accordingly, the monetary advantages of
the charging station, Cj are characterized as follows.
ucs
j = zj (yjAiti −Ψj) + (1 − zj)xjAi (8)
where, zj is the credit score for UAV Di given by the charging
station Cj and its value should lie in the range from 0 to 1.
The value of zj is determined from the previous completed
transactions by UAV Di in the network. The higher credit score
brings the higher value of zj .
Behavior or action of one entity affects the decision of others
as both charging stations, and the UAVs want to maximize their
economic benefits and profitability, respectively.
In this paper, a Stackelberg game approach is used to maxi-
mize the economic benefit of both UAVs and charging stations.
The Stackelberg game formally tells us about the staggered basic
leadership procedures of various independent decision-makers
(i.e., followers) in light of the choice taken by the main player
(leader) of the Stackelberg game. We, at that point, determine
the Stackelberg balance of the planned game [56]. Here, the
charging station is the seller energy node, and the UAV is the
buyer energy node. The charging station Cj sets its decision of
interest rate yj , and fine amount xj for every UAVDi separately.
The UAVs observe the decision of the charging station and react
with the best outcome of the energy Ai as per the late fee xj
given by the charging station. The overall structure of the game
G is defined as follows.
G =
{
(D ∪ {C}) , {ui}i∈I ,
{

B. Problem Solution
Backward induction methodology is used to get the equilib-
rium of game defined in Eqn. (9). By differentiating ui from
Eqn. (4) with Ai, we get:
∂ui
∂Ai
=
σidi
Ai −Qmin
i pi + φipi
− σiyjti − (1 − σi)xj (11)
Further differentiating ui with respect to Ai, we have:
∂2ui
∂A2
i
= − σidi(
Ai −Qmin
i pi + φipi
)2 < 0 (12)
As the second derivative of ui is negative, we will obtain a
strictly concave function. We acquire the optimal methodology
using the following equation:
∂ui
∂Ai
= 0 (13)
By solving Eqn. (13) the relation between UAVDi’s favorable
amount of tokens Ai, and late fee xj given by charging station
Cj is expressed as follows.
Ai =
σidi
σiyjti + (1 − σi)xj
+ li (14)
where,
li = Qmin
i pi − φipi (15)
Substituting Eqn. (14) into Eqn. (8) utility of charging station
ucs
j is changed as follows:
ucs
j =
σidi [zjyjti − zjtici + (1 − zj)xj ]
σiyjti + (1 − σi)xj
+ li[zjyjti − zjtici + (1 − zj)xj ] (16)
Further we simplify the Eqn. (16) as follows:
ucs
j =
r1yj − r2 + r3xj
σiyjti + (1 − σi)xj
+ r4yj − r5 + r6xj (17)
where,
r1 = σidizjti
r2 = σidizjtici
r3 = σidi (1 − zj)

The utility function ucs
j is found to first increase to certain
maxima, and then it starts decreasing with the increase in the
value of xj . This proves that the utility function ucs
j is convex
in nature. The following equation gives the optimal pricing for
energy sharing.

Stackelberg Equilibrium is achieved
To accomplish the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE), the charging
station needs to communicate with UAVs [57]. Algorithm 1 is
introduced to give a distributed path to all the UAVs and the
charging station to obtain the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium
iteratively.
VIII. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
A. Simulation Settings
For assessing the performance of P2P energy trading between
charging stations and UAVs, the simulation results are presented
in this section. In our model, we have considered a network
consisting of j charging stations and i UAVs. The predefined
factors di and φi for UAV Di lie in an interval of [1,5] and [5,7]
respectively. The token repayment time, i.e., ti for any UAV, lies
in the interval [5,9] months. The cost of the energy requested by
UAV Di is pi lies in the interval [6,15] dollars. The minimum
energy demand for UAV Di is Qmin
i and lies in an interval of
[50,60] kJ. The predefined credit grade factor relies upon Di’s
credit grade denoted by zj and lies in the interval of [0,1]. The
entire code for network creation is written in python.
B. Performance Evaluation
Results generated by the simulation of the model are com-
pared and evaluated in this section. Consider in a network there
is 1 charging station and 4 UAVs that need the energy to complete
their task. The UAVs which do not have enough tokens to buy
energy will borrow the IOTA tokens from charging station over
late feexj with repayment time ti. The late fee ofxi is calculated

in proportion to the borrowed tokens. Fig. 2 shows the change
in the value of utility of charging station ucs
j over change in
late fee xj . The value of utility of charging station ucs
j increases
initially and then decreases with the increase in a late fee. This
is so because as the value of xj increases over some threshold,
the UAVs are less motivated to accept the tokens. Therefore, the
utility of the charging station starts decreasing after a certain
increase in the value of xj . Finally, the appropriate value of late

fee xi should be imposed on UAV Di according to Algorithm 1,
which results in maximizing the utility of charging stations.
Fig. 3 shows the change in the value of utility of UAVs ui
over the change in the value of late fee xj to UAVs. From Eqn.
(4), it is observed that with the increase in the value of late fee
xj , there will be a decrease in the value of utility of UAVs. So
optimal value of late feexj is negotiated with charging stationCj
through Algorithm 1, which results in maximizing the utilities of
both UAVs and charging stations. Fig. 4 refers to the change in
energy given by the charging station to UAVs over the increase

in the value of late fee xj . This is so because the UAVs expect
less energyAi as the value of xj increases. From the Eqn. (14), it
is interpreted that the relation between energy given by charging
station Ai and late fee are inversely proportional to each other.
In order to acquire the minimum energy required by UAV Di,
i.e., Qmin
i , it should negotiate the energy Ai at optimal late fee
value xj through Algorithm 1.
Fig. 5 shows a change in the utility value of charging sta-
tion and energy given by charging station to UAVs with the
increase in the value of late fee xj . The utility value of the
charging station increases initially and then decreases with the
increase in the value of the late fee. The energy Ai given by
charging station to UAVs will be inversely proportional to late
fees. So with an increase in the value of late fee xj , there
will decrease in energy given by the charging station. This
finally results in a decrease in the utility of the charging station.
Therefore, the optimal late fee value xj is charged by charging
station from UAVs, in order to maximize its utility based on
Algorithm 1.
Fig. 6 shows the comparison of utility value of charging
stationucs
j in random and proposed model. In the random model,
the value of late fee xj and energy given by charging station
Ai to UAV are selected randomly and are not changed, which
results in a lower utility value than the value through proposed
model. However, in the proposed model, the value of late fee xj

changes with the change in energy given by charging station Ai
to UAVs. This continues until the values of the utility of charging
stations and UAVs are maximum. Similarly, Fig. 7 presents the
comparison of the utility value of UAVs ui in the random and
proposed model.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a distributed framework for
energy trading between UAVs and charging stations. We have
used an IOTA based tangle data structure to create a distributed
network. IOTA tokens are shared between the different entities in
the network. The UAVs can borrow the tokens from the charging
station and can purchase energy using those tokens. UAVs need
to return the tokens to the charging station in a predefined time.
UAVs also need to return some extra tokens as interest for using
the tokens. If the UAVs fail to repay the tokens in a predefined
time, a fine is charged by the charging station. The fine rate is the
motivating factor for the charging station to give tokens to the
UAVs. UAVs expect more tokens in less fine, and the charging

stations expect high fine. A game-theoretic approach is applied
to this scenario to maximize the profit of both UAVs and charging
stations. Numerical results prove that the proposed model to give
better revenue to the UAVs and charging stations as compared to
its counterparts. The overall utility of the drones and the charging
stations is enhanced based on the numerical analysis. We expect
that the proposed scheme can be generalized to accommodate
IoT devices. In particular those devices that are used in critical
applications such as healthcare systems.
