To run a multi-sport event, it is necessary to have a design of accounting information system for ticket sales that can
run efficiently and can reduce opportunities of fraudulent acts. A case study during the 18th Asian Games 2018 shows
that there were problems of inadequate ticket sales facilities for prospective spectators due to vendor diversion to the
frictional problems such as venues located in various regions and protection of spectator rights in accordance with
the purchased tickets. Some cases found in the multi-sport event were false seats and fictitious spectators allowed
entrance to some arenas they did not have the right to enter, although they have gone through verification measures
using line-of-sight barcoding technology. Some cases were also found during the 18th Asian Games 2018, in which
there was a problem of inadequate ticket sales facilities for prospective spectators due to a change of vendor. There
were also frictional problems on venues which are spread in various regions and regarding protection of spectators’
rights per their purchased tickets. Moreover, it is fundamental that we take concern in the current pandemic situ-
ation, all event organizers are obliged to consider implementing health protocols issued by the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO) for safety to break the chain of COVID-19 infection. This study is conducted to identify the core of
those problems and offer a solution by implementing radio-frequency identification (RFID) and blockchain tech-
nology to optimize the services applied in the multi-sport event, especially during and post-pandemic. Ticketing
effectiveness for spectators are also challenged by budgetary and eco-friendliness issues.
1. Introduction
This proposed system may contribute in empirical studies to
recommend a better ticketing system for either the event committee
and third-party ticket vendors especially for multi-sport events so that it
can run more safely, effectively, efficiently, eco-friendly, and account-
able which can benefit to all parties involved by the implementation of
radio-frequency identification (RFID) and blockchain technology in the
system. These benefits may even make events, especially multi-sport
events where there are many matches to choose with their various
venues and schedules that can be disseminated by smart contracts and
tags within the tickets. While in previous researches on this particular
sector are often more focused on the ticketing system for public trans-
portation and revenue management. This paper focuses more on the
ticketing system for multi-sport events and other related events Figures

In this paper, there will be findings and discussions on how RFID and
blockchain are two of the most sufficient technologies to be implemented
in an accounting information system – especially in the field of ticketing
management. While we already have various studies on these topics, we
have not found a more focused study particularly regarding this issue. As
to why this issue is relevant, is for us as a society to get prepared for
upcoming multi-sport events and other events with similar ticketing ar-
chitecture, either during or post-pandemic Tables 1 and 2.
The implementation of advanced health measures, the use of RFID, and
blockchain integrated with accounting information system may hopefully
help resolving some of these issues. This technologywill be used for amore
accurate identification processing with the use of smart contracts which
are unique to each user from athletes to committeemembers, or in this case
– the live spectators.
Theories applied in this study are sales accounting information sys-
tem, revenue cycle, agency theory, business process, pricing decisions,

ligence (AI). Some prior works are also put into use as references such as:
a) Duran et al. (2014) which involves ticket bundling for sports and
entertainment industry through optimizing revenue management to
maximize event profitability by allocating relevant resources; and b)
Chou et al. (2018) regarding resources including support systems related

to services, security and time efficiency. These theories are then mate-
rialized through, for instance, disseminating classes in ticketing (Ellison
et al., 2017).
RFID is implemented in various industries such as security, library,
airline, and sports. It has proven to be a useful instrument that offers
optimization of resources; customer service quality; accuracy

Chen et al. (2014) stated that the usage of RFID is fundamental in this
proposed system, as it can play the roles of tickets or ID cards, most
RFID-tagged products are small and portable, and people may carry them
in their daily life. Meanwhile Adam-Kalfon and El-Moutaouakil (2017)
explained that blockchain technology can be used as a peer-to-peer (P2P)
data lending as a transactional medium through the marriage of two
concepts: asymmetric cryptography and distributed information tech-
nology architecture. Kim et al. (2019) identified that various users may
provide new services and communicate to each other in the world of

internet of things (IoT); which has more complexity than distributed IT
architecture, which requires various hardware and software alike.
This study consists of six sections. The first section explains the
background, gaps, and objectives of this paper, including the basis of
selected research aspects and thoughts about ticketing accounting in-
formation system design through implementing RFID and blockchain
technology and how they can contribute to making events more secure,
effective, efficient, eco-friendly, and fraud-proof, so that this system will
hopefully benefit all stakeholders involved. The second section dissects
referenced literatures regarding relevant theories and hypotheses. The
third section explains the methods being used to research related issues??
in a qualitative exploratory approach. The fourth section describes an
analysis of the suggested system in this paper for a multi-sport event; how
RFID and blockchain could ease and create a more accountable; multi-
sport event; its data-flow diagram (DFD); entity relationship diagram
(ERD); and relevant tables. The fifth section explains the study authors’
point of view regarding multi-sport events. Lastly, the sixth section
concludes the paper as a whole, with a summary and recommendations
for future studies.

2. Literature review
2.1. Agency theory
This research applies agency theory, which was popularized by Jen-
sen and Meckling (1976), which introduces two entities into the pro-
posed accounting information system: the principal and its agents. As
anything related to accounting and sales has to be put through an
auditing process, so the way to solve related issues is to use agency theory
– as the theory itself is commonly used in researches in the field of
auditing. As mentioned by Safriliana et al. (2018), in such architecture,
we may encounter an information asymmetry, which mainly rests on the
difference of information interests between agents and the principals.
Using the Olympics as an example, the Olympics council as the principal
overseeing the system, while Olympics committee and ticket vendors
would act as agents.
2.2. Ticketing
The main issue of this research surrounds multi-sport event ticketing
systems, which are not too reliable in general with some end user issues.
To solve this issue, this research is based on papers such as Duran et al.
(2014) that highlights ticketing system in both sports and entertainment
industries, Chou, et al. (2018) regarding ticket price bundling, and Elli-
son et al. (2017) regarding online ticketing. Duran focuses on how rev-
enue management can maximize profit by resource allocation such as
flight seats, hotel rooms, and event tickets. These three measurements
can also be implemented in multi-sport event ticketing. Which later can
be functioned as an important point in creating strategic advantages and
competitiveness in this emerging industry where this issue also involves
appropriate pricing for spectator classes in a venue, when and to whom a
discount can be applied, or which sports are suitable to be put into the
portfolio. To support this idea, Chou researched Taiwan High Speed Rail
(THSR), which prioritizes service, security, and timeliness. These
particular characteristics can also be found in multi-sport events where
spectators have the right to select their favorite matches and sports,
similar to passenger classes in train ticketing. Therefore, a mapping
system can be made to accommodate spectators to public transportation
systems and getting involved in the social and economic impact on the
multi-sport event. This issue is also found by Ellison regarding the use of
Sydney's Opal card with its multimodal ticketing – namely, MyMulti
which allows trips with various vehicles in a designated geographic area.
Similar instances in multi-sport event are sports and matches to public
transport selection for spectators in a smart, integrated systems.
2.3. Radio frequency identification (RFID)
The use of RFID is found in many sectors such as security, libraries,
airlines, to sports. RFID has advantages to offer such as in optimizing
resources, customer service, transaction accuracy, to business processes.
Ahsan et al. (2011) emphasize that the system can be implemented by the
use of RFID tags with unique numerical orders which cannot be changed
for issues regarding security, which can also benefit spectators and multi-
sport event organizers.
2.4. Blockchain
According to Adam-Kalfon and El Moutaouakil (2017), blockchain is a
form of technology which can store data in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner.
This technology was born by the marriage of two concepts; the first one
being asymmetric cryptography which allows engagements between
public key and private systems, the second one is the information tech-
nology (IT) architecture which is distributed specialized in a P2P concept.

2.5. Internet of things (IoT)
Al-Fuqaha et al. (2015) believe that by the usage, the Internet of
Things (IoT) is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sen-
sors, and Internet protocols; and by the definition, the IoT consists of a
growing number of physical objects which are connected to the Internet
at an unprecedented rate. In the world of IoT, various users can provide
new services and interact to each other.
In a 2020 study, Tawalbeh, et al. refer IoT as a concept of connected
objects and devices of all types over the Internet – either wired or
wireless. In which organizations and individuals can communicate with
each other remotely in a seamless connectivity, also called as hyper-
connectivity. The term IoT was coined by Kevin Ashton in the year 1999
to promote the RFID concept – with sensors and actuators, which is also
relevant in this paper.
Kim et al. (2019) found that an IoT which has more complex speci-
fications than IT infrastructure is composed by many hardware and
software. Similarly, blockchain is predicted to be applied in many
Internet sectors, it can also be integrated into data, transaction, and
authorization management. This issue is in line with many things needed
by a multi-sport event organizer and committee to manage spectator data
in a secure, effective, efficient, and fraud-proof infrastructure which can
be traced from the very first ticket transaction, spectator data manage-
ment can prove whether the ticket holder is allowed in the arena or not to
spectator authentication by the ticketing department so the spectators
can enter the arena on schedule, in their respective seat class and venue
as stated in their purchased tickets.
3. Methods
A qualitative exploratory approach was used to conduct this research.
This method was used to give certain information to other individuals
and parties about the issues which are being researched, initiated by
personal judgments of an issue based of historical data to then respond,
gather, analyze, and interpret those data. After that, a test needs to be
conducted to those issues, and then the general idea to be expanded and
resumed by perfecting questions related to the research.
As for the method being used to conduct this research, a qualitative
exploratory approach (Neuman, 2014) and a study case (Yin, 2016) are
deemed as more appropriate to engage on such topics. These are
considered regarding the research scope in the field of ticketing – espe-
cially on the accounting information system for multi-sport events, then
both the primary and secondary data are either quantitative or qualita-
tive, and the data collection procedure which was kickstarted by a
first-hand observation, followed by interviews, and accompanied by
documentations and literature review.
This research has been conducted in three steps. The first one is to
determine variables and research objects, this analysis was based on an
experience as a volunteer, particularly as a liaison officer to guests and
spectators at the 18th Asian Games 2018 in which were found some
problems regarding proper service to spectators to security. The second
one is to conduct interviews and documentations in which the interview
was conducted with a partner AI company of the Indonesian Police at
ensuring the safety of the 18th Asian Games 2018, namely Nodeflux. Also,
relevant interviews were conducted by asking relevant questions to
spectators and volunteers alike for relevant issues regarding this
research. Lastly, is to analyze problems and indicators the problems that
were found need a set of indicators to make the research more focused on
the main issue. The illustrative method as to conduct an analysis ac-
cording to Neuman (2018, 490) is as follows, then followed by the
conceptual framework:
4. Results and discussion
From some cases found in the 18th Asian Games 2018 as a volunteer,
all of those had spectators and journalists of foreign nationalities
A. Nugraha et al. Heliyon 7 (2021) e08167
involved. With various countries of origin, backgrounds, and motives can
be concluded as a frictional case. Therefore, an integrated ticketing ac-
counting information system intertwined with visitor data as a whole -
whichever their status - is needed.
Beyond those, the working security system was implemented by
artificial intelligence (AI) induced face recognition system which was
integrated into designated command centers in each regional police
where the venues are located. But at the time it was limited to only
process visitors of Indonesian nationality.
To get the multi-sport event ticketing system running, some processes
regarding data flow are needed. There are three subjects involved to run
this system, they are (1) to-be spectators as the buyers, (2) event organizing
committee as the official ticket issuer, and last but not least (3) blockchain
as the validator of the transaction. In the system there needs to be a
planning for the matches which consists of (1) sports, (2) contingent, (3)
region, (4) venue, (5) arena (with seats capacity), (6) schedule (including
the date, hour, and match duration), and (7) seat class. After data collec-
tion, the main data will be shown in the ticketing system prepared for
future purchases. The shown data will then direct to-be spectators to input
the data to the buyers' account which are (1) full name, (2) home address,
(3) email address, (4) phone number, and (5) special needs, such as the
condition whether to bring children below 18 years old and adult spec-
tators with disability concerns. Also, regarding the ongoing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to include health
measurements of the spectators such as body temperature and vaccination
report. Payment will be transferred virtually via desired payment gateways
whether it is bank account, virtual account (VA) or digital wallet. After
payment checkout, a barcode will be sent to spectators' registered email.
Multi-sport event organizers conduct a partnership with retail businesses
as games partners to place kiosk card dispensers in the form of vending
machines to dispense radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags attached
ticket wristbands integrated with a near-field communication (NFC)
technology connected with the blockchain records. The dispensers are
modified with barcode scanners to scan the barcodes sent to each specta-
tors’ email as shown on their smartphones.
Figure 6. Entity relationship diagram (ERD) of th

In this proposed system, tickets will be integrated within the block-
chain hierarchy. In this case, blockchain has a role as the transaction
validator for tickets with verified purchase, so that the wristbands
embedded with RFID tags do not have to be dispensed multiple times,
spectators only have to walk pass the reading range door access UHF
RFID gate reader which are available at the front gates of each venue and
arena to scan the tags automatically. If the ticket is the same one as
purchased, which are already stored in the blockchain hashes with smart
contract specially made for transactions to allow the spectators to watch
the match. If the ticket is not the same as purchased, then the RFID gate
reader will ring an alarm with a beeping sound which will alarm the
security staffs to direct them out form the arena. If then found another
difficulty, then the issue will be directed to a designated command center
in the venue or arena as needed, whether by handy talkie (HT) or face-to-
face with the staffs.
Agency theory is implemented in this proposed accounting informa-
tion system because this system has two types of entities. The first one
acts as the business principal, mainly is the International Olympics
Committee (IOC) to the designated Olympics council in the region
(usually by continent, e.g., the Olympics Council of Asia (OCA) for Asia
region) or just the IOC if it is the Olympics and Paralympics being held -
by the hands of the multi-sport event committee to run the agreed sys-
tem. Asymmetric information also happens between the IOC, the Olym-
pics council and the multi-sport event committee so that the ticket sales is
suitable with the seat capacity for spectators in the arenas for ticket
vendors acting as agents who - as business entities will maximize their
profit from ticket sales. This asymmetric information if occurs will be
harmful for the spectators as consumers who have purchased the tickets
as their desired matches, so an agency theory is needed so that their
consumer rights can be distributed fair and square upon the relationship
between the business principal and its agents.
In this proposed system there are several data-flows which are rep-
resented by some diagrams, generally called. As data-flow diagram
(DFD). Those diagrams are mainly represented by a context DFD which is
the contextual foundation of multi-sport event ticketing system. In the
e proposed accounting information system.
A. Nugraha et al. Heliyon 7 (2021) e08167
context DFD, the data flows from or to each other's entities. Those data
are classified into three, the first one – namely, spectators for the spec-
tator data, the second one being ticket vendors with purchase order
which flows into the multi-sport event accounting information system
(AIS), and out of the AIS for the sales report directed to the third one
which is the organizing committee.
In Figure 6, we explore how each data is being transferred to each
attribute to further the exchange of information. These data were then to
be used as attributes for a working, effective, efficient, less-fraudulent,
and sustainable ticketing accounting information system – especially
for multi-sport events alike. With this, we explore the entity relationship
diagram (ERD) used to build, develop, and maintain the accounting in-
formation system. There should be known that these attributes are
dissected into five subsystems – they are specialized in transaction pro-
cessing, operating engineering, operational intelligence, quality, and
lastly in effectiveness and efficiency. These subsystems are essential to
each of their specialties so that the data flowmay work seamlessly within
the system as a whole.
These diagrams – such as data-flow diagram (DFD) and ERD as
aforementioned, are needed to counter some difficulties that may appear
in the implementation of the new system. As there might be some
weakness that can be found or even human error in the running of the
system that may occur at any time, a controlling measure is needed to be
applied for a more responsible and less-fraudulent workflow. This mea-
sure can be integrated into the sales record attribute as an accountability
control.
As for the people responsible in running the system, there have to be
two sides on the run. Those are the ones managing the system and the
multi-sport event committee who run the games. In this scenario, the
people might have a clearer vision as to what are the tasks that matches
their job description and how can the system – as a control measure, be
integrated into their jobs whether it is in or even after the games for
accountability reasons.
The implementation of RFID and blockchain is agreed by some parties
can benefit many sectors (Kuang and Su, 2013; Singh, 2020; Kim et al.,
2019). However, some also disagree to apply these changes as for societal
adaptation (Angell and Kietzmann, 2001) to budget issues (Hsu et al.,
2020). These views are also apparent in interviews held with INASGOC
officials and third-parties such as if there are still transactions beingmade
and the tickets are being distributed fairly then there will be no need of
such changes to apply new things like RFID and blockchain into the
system. Flowcharts are also regarded as non-apparent in transaction
systems.
5. Conclusions
With the implementation of RFID and blockchain in multi-sport event
ticketing accounting information system design, a more efficient and
accountable multi-sport event is expected. So, either the committee and
the ticket vendors as partners of the event can benefit from this system as
it can help them run the event way more easily at solving little issues that
may cause a domino effect for the event's success and credibility in its
stakeholders' eyes. Case-study centric papers are expected to be more
structured so that the proposed system can be more beneficial at least as a
reference to enhance a multi-sport event's safety, effectiveness, effi-
ciency, eco-friendliness, and accountability. Also, more papers focusing
on the use of RFID and blockchain in similar systems are encouraged for
system's sustainability and further improvements in the future. While the
system can also be applied to other events similar to a multi-sport event,
such as amusement parks, exhibitions, andmovie theaters. Application of
artificial intelligence (AI) is also encouraged for future researches.
Furthermore, this paper has some study limits, those are the effectiveness
for spectators – especially, to scan the RFID tags, the eco-friendliness
itself whether the ticket wristbands would be discharged or kept, and
some budgetary issues.
