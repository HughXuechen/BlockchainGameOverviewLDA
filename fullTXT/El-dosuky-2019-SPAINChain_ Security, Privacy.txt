scientific terms. Blockchains, underpinning crypto-currency, could be
the remedy for this vulnerability. This paper quickly overviews secu-
rity, privacy, Ambient Intelligence, and the use of Blockchain as a safe-
guard for IOT, before proposing and evaluating SPAINChain:Security,

1 Introduction
The home sweet home is a smart one indeed. Environment “smartness”, or Ambi-
ent Intelligence [1] in scientific terms, comes at the cost of vulnerability due to:
– security attacks [2], and
– manipulation of privacy-sensitive data [3].
This vulnerability in Internet-of-Things (IoT) necessitates the existence of a
safeguard for both security and privacy without sacrificing “smartness” of the
environment [4].
Blockchains, underpinning crypto-currency [5], could be the remedy for this
vulnerability.
This paper quickly overviews security, privacy, Ambient Intelligence, and the
use of Blockchain as a safeguard for IOT (in Sect. 2), before proposing, evaluat-
ing and concluding SPAINChain:Security, Privacy, and Ambient Intelligence in
Negotiation between IOT and Blockchain in subsequent sections.

2 Previous Work
This section quickly overviews security, privacy, Ambient Intelligence, and the
use of Blockchain as a safeguard for IOT.
2.1 Security
Security is modeled based on CIA model which is an amalgamation of Confiden-
tiality, Integrity, and Availability [6]. The former ensures that solely authorized
users have access. Integrity ensures that data is received as sent, without modi-
fication, The latter ensures data availability when needed.
Non-bespoke IOT devices usually lack a safeguard for security, that they
can be easily hacked [7]. Smart home vulnerability is inevitable, even with the
existence of gateways controlling packets exchange to and fro [8] Object security,
as implemented in OSCAR architecture [9], is powerful that IoT researchers
commence utilizing it as in [10].
Cryptography seems to be a key ingredient in many confidentiality solutions
[11]. Recently, a clever Variable Key-length cryptography (VKLC) solution is
proposed based on the motto, “A valuable thing needs higher security” [12].
It constructs a dynamic model for the estimated economic value of data, and
enforces the appropriate security accordingly. The more“valuable” the data, the
bigger the cryptography key length.
Bitcoin, or blockchain v.1, introduces Proof-of-Work (POW) cryptographic
puzzles [5]. Not only a blockchain ensures transparency, but also it can be an
integrity-assurance ingredient [13].
2.2 Privacy
Access control, usually implemented as an access matrix of privileges [14], is not
enough to reaching the holy-grail of privacy [15]. Preserving IOT privacy raises
many challenges [16]. Blockchains are at the rescue to provide a decentralized
access [17], and credibility verification [18]. A middleware is proposed between
sender and receiver to control access [3]. IGOR is recently proposed [19] and
augmented to provide a unified IOT access control [20].
2.3 Ambient Intelligence
There is a plethora of smart home projects, leveraging Ambient Intelligence [21].
Implementation usually takes the form of a context-aware middleware as shown
in Fig. 1.
The cycle is self-describing. Usually a context is related to energy consump-
tion, and this paper shall stick to that.

2.4 Blockchain-IOT Integration
For a detailed survey of possible blockchain-IOT integration scenarios, kindly
refer to [22]. Integration involves inevitable challenges [23] such as scalability
and latency. Blockchain Platforms are meticulously analyzed for IoT [24]. Based
on that analysis favorable platforms (Table 1, showing ranking of Security, Scal-
ability, Suitability for smart contract on a scale of 1 to 5) and selection criteria
(Fig. 2) are determined.
3 Proposed System
Let us first set the mathematical foundation of IOT-Blockchain Mapping.
Theorem 1 (IOT-Blockchain Mapping)
λB ← δB(εT − λT )
εT
+ ξB (1)
where λB is blockchain feature, usually platform rank, in interval [ξB , ξB+δB ]. ξB
is the minimum and is not necessarily a zero, allowing negative values. ξB + δB
is the maximum. Hence, δB is the range. λT is IOT feature, usually energy
consumption, in interval [0, εT ]. Clearly, εT is the maximum. ��
Proof
0 ≤ λT ≤ εT (2)
0 ≥ −λT ≥ −εT (3)
εT ≥ εT − λT ≥ 0 (4)
1 ≥ εT − λT
εT
≥ 0 (5)

Table 1. Blockchain platform favorability [24]
Blockchain (Security, scalability, smart contract)
Bitcoin (Type 3) (3, 1, 1)
Ethereum (Type 3) (3, 3, 4)
Hyperledger (Type 2) (4, 4, 4)
Ripple (Type 2) (4, 4, 4)
Multichain (Type 1) (4, 4, 1)
Eris (Type 1) (4, 3, 4)
0 ≤ εT − λT
εT
≤ 1 (6)
0 ≤ δB(εT − λT )
εT
≤ δB (7)
ξB ≤ δB(εT − λT )
εT
+ ξB ≤ ξB + δB (8)
Note that the middle expression:
δB(εT − λT )
εT
+ ξB (9)
is a blockchain feature in interval [ξB , ξB + δB ]. Denoting it λB,
λB ← δB(εT − λT )
εT
+ ξB (10)
��
Based on this mapping theorem, it is possible to seek the optimal blockchain-
IOT pairing as in Fig. 3, in which device T (seeking context C) is paired with
blockchain B (with configuration suitable for the same context C). Hence, shift-
ing from access matrix to a dichotomy of B matrix and T matrix. The former
determines the context for each blockchain (Table 1 and Fig. 2 help in construct-
ing such a matrix), and the latter determines the context for each IOT device
(It could be dynamically constructed, utilizing cycle shown in Fig. 1). Context
elicitation and blockchain matching are depicted in Fig. 4. Now the time is ripe

Fig. 5. Conceptual model of SPAINChain
to propose SPAINChain conceptual model (Fig. 5), implemented as a set of lay-
ers (Fig. 6). SPAINChain elects the best blockchain to safeguard a specific IOT
device in a certain context.
SPAINChain is decomposed of 4 + 1 layers. The lowest layer, L0, is the basic
blockchain scanner. The top layer, L4, is for interaction with entities outside
SPAINChain. It integrates IGOR ([19] for authentication and access control,
striving for privacy), an updated ontology of IOT devices, an updated ontology
of available Blockchains, Data Importer, and Data Exporter. L3 is for user conve-
nience. It integrates an updated Users’ list, Context Aquisitioner, Preprocessor,
and Visualizer. The layer beneath, L2, is for maintaining ambient intelligence.
It integrates an updated ontology of Contexts, Context Modeler, and Context
Disseminator. L1 integrates the core Negotiator, Context Reasoner, OSCAR ([9]
for security), and VKLC ([12], determining sufficient degree of security based on
context).

Fig. 8. Blockchain gamut Fig. 9. Device gamut
The gamut of devices is based on monthly energy consumption, as estimated
by Electric Regulatory Agency in Egypt [25].
Fig. 10. Mean time overheads
SPAINChain 423
The gamut of blockchain is based on a new concept called solidus. Solidus
is basically the sum of favorability dimensions shown in Table 1, adjusted by
preference of blockchain type, as follows.
Solidus(B) = (1 − γ ∗ (BType − 1)) ∗
∑
dim∈FavDims
Bdim (11)
where γ is a degradation factor, set to 0.1. For Eris with BType = 1 and favora-
bility (4, 3, 4), Solidus(Eris) = 11.
Distribution of mean time overheads either with or without capabilities are
shown in Fig. 10. Overheads are bearable. The key merit here is the dynamic
determination of sufficient degree of IOT privacy and security based on context.
This allows for a dynamic overhead compared to fixed blockchain-based overhead
solutions such as [26].
5 Conclusion and Future Work
IOT-Blockchain mapping is proven to be feasible. Based on this mapping theo-
rem, it is possible to seek the optimal blockchain-IOT pairing, in which device
T (seeking context C) is paired with blockchain B (with configuration suitable
for the same context C). Hence, shifting from access matrix to a dichotomy of B
matrix and T matrix. The former determines the context for each blockchain, and
the latter determines the context for each IOT device. The gamut of devices is
based on monthly energy consumption, while the gamut of blockchain is based
on a new concept called solidus. Solidus is basically the sum of favorability
dimensions, adjusted by preference of blockchain type.
Then came SPAINChain, decomposed of 4 + 1 layers. The lowest layer,L0,
is the basic blockchain scanner. The top layer, L4, is for interaction with enti-
ties outside SPAINChain. It integrates IGOR [19], devices, Blockchains, Data
Importer, and Data Exporter. L3 is for user convenience. The layer beneath,L2,
is for maintaining ambient intelligence. L1 integrates the core Negotiator, Con-
text Reasoner, OSCAR [9], and VKLC [12].
SPAINChain attempts to determine sufficient degree of IOT privacy and
security based on context, by allowing an automatic negotiation between IOT
and blockchains.
Future direction shall consider producing SPAINChain based on the proof-
of-concept provided in this paper.
