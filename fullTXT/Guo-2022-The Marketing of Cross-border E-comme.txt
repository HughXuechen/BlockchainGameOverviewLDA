Abstract
This article applies mathematical probability theory to statistical algorithms to conduct game analysis on the
relevant marketing decisions of foreign trade cross-border e-commerce. We build a theoretical framework for the
collaborative development of SMEs and cross-border e-commerce platforms. At the same time, build a
trustworthy transaction margin mechanism for cross-border e-commerce transactions in a fuzzy market
environment. The participation of the blockchain big data platform can promote the development of foreign trade
cross-border e-commerce toward a more transparent and healthy partnership.

1. Introduction
Before the New Deal, cross-border e-commerce bonded imports were implemented as a
"negative list.". Commodities already in transit but not on the list have been stranded at the
terminal and airport. These have brought huge losses to cross-border e-commerce companies
[1]. If the business owner predicts that the relevant regulatory authorities will continue to
improve, it will increase the stocking of goods not on the positive list. This leads to a
monopoly of "people without me." Therefore, there will be a three-stage game from stocking
to sales: In the first stage, there is a game of "stocking" and "supervision" between the
company and the government. The second stage is that after the company has decided, there
will be a network of strategies of multiple companies in the market. This article assumes that
one company has adopted a strategy of stocking products other than the "positive list" to form
a monopoly in the cross-border e-commerce market. Another company can only stock and sell
products using traditional trading methods. This forms competition with its sales channels.

The third stage is the pricing strategy of the sellers of the two channels in the market when
facing rational consumers [2]. This strategy maximizes self-interest. The relevant suggestions
put forward by this article through the three-stage game analysis between the government,
enterprises, and consumers are more theoretical and practical.
2. The first stage: the evolutionary game between the enterprise and the government
Promoting the steady and healthy development of the cross-border e-commerce industry
while meeting regulatory requirements and preventing and controlling risks is a crucial matter.
This puts forward higher regulatory requirements for relevant regulatory agencies such as
customs, taxation, and national inspection. The introduction of the "positive list" is a
manifestation of increased supervision. From the relationship between relevant regulatory
agencies and cross-border e-commerce companies, companies will always pursue excess
profits and increase their supply types in the short term. In this way, the monopoly situation
of "people without me" is realized. The government has stepped up supervision to prevent the
risks of moving too fast. This reduces the profit margins of cross-border e-commerce
companies [3]. When the government gradually enriches the positive list, cross-border e-
commerce companies will start a new round of stocking decisions for products not on the
positive list. The two sides promote each other in a dynamic game.
The subjects of the game are cross-border e-commerce companies and related regulatory
agencies. The enterprise's decision strategy set is {stocking, not stocking}. The regulatory
agency’s decision-making strategy set is {included in the list, not included in the list}. Cross-
border e-commerce companies normally stock up to obtain normal income 1EI and pay the
cost 1EC . Relevant regulators who choose to be included in the list will obtain benefits 1MI
and pay costs 1MC . When the company stocks goods out of the list and the regulator does not
supervise it, the company obtains an excess income 2EI , pays a cost 2EC , and the regulator
assumes the risk 2MC . In the case of not being included in the list by the supervisory authority,
it will obtain income 2MI . At the same time, if the company adopts stocking, the regulatory
agency will obtain additional penalty income 3MI and bear the cost 3MC . The combination of
the game process is as follows:
(1) When a company chooses not to stock products not on the positive list, the regulator
adopts the income function of the two parties when they are included in the list as:
11 1 1 11 1 1,E M
E M M MR I C R I C    .
(2) The company adopts the inventory strategy for the products outside the positive list, and
the supervisory agency adopts the listing strategy. The income functions of the two parties at
this time are: 21 1 2 1 2 21 1 1 2,E M
E E M E M M ER I I C C R I C C       .
3) The enterprise adopts the non-stocking of the goods outside the positive list, and the
supervisory agency adopts the non-listed list. The profit function of both parties is
21 1 1 21 2 1
E M
E E M MR I C R I C    respectively.
(4) The company adopts the strategy of not being included in the list when the company
adopts the stocking of goods that are not on the positive list. The profit function of both
parties is 22 1 1 2 3 22 2 3 1 3,E M
E E E M M M M MR I C C I R I I C C        respectively.
In the game process, cross-border e-commerce companies adopt non-stocking and stocking
strategies with a probability of 1-a, respectively [4]. The regulatory agency adopts the listing
and non-listing strategies with the probability of b and 1-b. The income matrix of regulatory
agencies and cross-border e-commerce companies is shown in Table 1.

The income of cross-border e-commerce companies adopting pure non-stocking and pure

respectively. Among cross-border e-commerce companies, a proportion of a companies
choose a non-stocking strategy, and a proportion of 1 a companies choose a stocking
strategy. Then the average income is 1 5( ) (1 )E E EE R R a R b     , and the income of the
relevant regulatory agencies using the pure listing and pure non-listing strategies is

relevant regulatory agencies, an institution with a ratio of b adopts the listing strategy, and an
institution with a ratio of 1 b adopts the non-listing strategy. Then the average return is
2 2( ) (1 )M M ME R R b R a     .
Assuming each participant's bounded rationality and F(a)=0, the fixed point of the replicated
dynamic equation can be solved. We get the dynamic replication equation of cross-border e-

From Figure 1, we can see that the evolutionary stable equilibrium points in the dynamic
evolutionary game between cross-border e-commerce companies and relevant regulatory
agencies are (1, 0)A and (0,1)B respectively [6]. There are four areas in the evolutionary
dynamic game process, of which, in the area OBDE, it will converge to (0,1)B (stocking,
listing). The EDCA area will converge to (1, 0)A (not stocked, not included in the list). F is
the saddle point. This means that cross-border e-commerce companies choose the strategy of
not stocking with the probability of a, and the relevant regulatory agencies choose the strategy
of not being included in the list with the probability of b.

From the perspective of the long-term and healthy development of cross-border e-commerce,
the probability that relevant regulatory agencies will be included in the positive list is as

The above formula shows that the difference between the public opinion pressure of the

Conclusion 1: The stocking probability of an enterprise is directly proportional to the excess
income, and it is inversely proportional to the stocking cost. The probability that a regulatory

agency chooses to monitor is directly proportional to the penalty income. It is inversely
proportional to the pressure of public opinion not included in the list. It is directly
proportional to the reputation impact of the list.
3. The second stage: the game of channel competition among enterprises
Under the condition that the government allows the sale of off-list goods, enterprises are
automatically divided into two teams with an out-of-stock strategy due to stocking and not
stock. Enterprise 1 can only purchase goods through traditional trading methods and sell them
through traditional retail channels [7]. Enterprise 2 can stock up and sell on cross-border e-
commerce channels and traditional trade channels. At this stage, this article makes the
following assumptions:
(1) The market is a supply chain system composed of a cross-border e-commerce channel
sales company and a traditional retail channel sales company. (2) The two companies pursue
their profit maximization through price competition. (3) Two companies sell the same product,
and the product itself is completely replaceable. (4) Each company has its own fixed loyal
consumers. There are still a group of consumers in the market who are pursuing low prices.
In this stage, the Bertrand model is used to characterize the competition among enterprises.
Let uec and utc denote the unit product inventory cost ( )ue utc c of the enterprise through
cross-border e-commerce channels and traditional trade channels, respectively. ( 1,2)cif i 
represents the fixed costs of enterprises 1 and 2, respectively. ( 1,2)tip i  represents the sales
prices of enterprises 1 and 2 in traditional trade channels, respectively. 2ep represents the
sales price of enterprise 2 in the cross-border e-commerce channel. It is assumed here that the
price influence of the commodity itself is greater than the mutual influence. Then the demand
function faced by enterprise 1 can be expressed as follows:
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2t t eD l m p n p n p    (1)
The demand function faced by enterprise 2 in traditional trade sales channels can be expressed
as follows:
2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2t t t t t eD l m p n p n p    (2)
The demand function faced by enterprise 2 in cross-border e-commerce sales channels can be
expressed as follows:
2 2 2 2 2 1 2( )e e e e t tD l m p n p p    (3)
Among them, 1 2 2, ,t el l l represents the potential market size of companies 1 and 2 in their
respective sales channels. 1n represents the degree of substitution of two companies in
traditional sales channels. 2n represents the degree of substitution between traditional sales
channels and cross-border e-commerce sales channels. Therefore, the profit function of
enterprises 1 and 2 can be expressed as follows:

Since the sum of the modules of the non-diagonal elements in each row of 1M is less than the
module of the diagonal elements in this row, 1M is the diagonal dominance matrix. In this
way, we can easily obtain that 1M is a non-singular positive definite matrix [8]. Therefore,

In the supply chain of traditional trade channels, since commodities are substitutable, their
demand elasticity is relatively large. Due to the low cost of cross-border e-commerce stocking
channels, enterprise 2 chooses to cut prices in cross-border e-commerce stocking channels to
gain market share [9]. At this time, enterprise 1, with only one stocking channel, chooses the
price reduction strategy. Enterprise 2 chooses to reduce the price simultaneously. Therefore, it
can be seen that after the introduction of the positive list, the prices of some products that are
not on the positive list (such as the Kao steam eye mask) will have a certain degree of price
reduction in supermarkets. This is to resist the advantages of cross-border e-commerce in
stocking sales before and after introducing the positive list. Due to the monopoly of cross-
border e-commerce stocking channels, price demand elasticity is small. When the demand
elasticity of cross-border e-commerce stocking channels increases, Enterprise 2 can only use
traditional trade stocking imports for products that are not on the positive list. There are still
some consumers in the market who are keen to sell products through cross-border e-
commerce stocking channels. The decline in the supply of this channel has caused Enterprise
2 to increase its profits by increasing prices. As the monopoly advantage of cross-border e-
commerce stocking channels is gradually disappearing, in order to maintain market share,
enterprises 2 have to adopt a strategy of lowering prices in traditional trade stocking sales.

Due to the substitutability of products and the greater flexibility of alternative channels, cross-
border e-commerce stocking channels have to increase prices to maintain profit margins after
the tax reform [10]. Corresponding enterprise 2 will keep the price advantage of cross-border
e-commerce stocking channels in the minds of consumers, and will also increase prices
correspondingly in traditional trade stocking channels. As a market follower, Enterprise 1 also
raises prices to increase profits.

Since the channel is not dominant, the demand of enterprise 1 is greatly affected by the price
in the competition with enterprise 2, so at this time, the price and demand decrease at the
same time, which leads to a decrease in profit. When the demand elasticity of cross-border e-
commerce stocking channels increases, enterprise 1 seizes the opportunity to choose to reduce
prices and increase market share at this time, which will lead to increased demand and profit
recovery.

Since the demand of enterprise 1 in the competition with enterprise 2 is greatly affected by
price, when enterprise 1 chooses to reduce the price, enterprise 2 will also choose to reduce
the price. Because enterprise 1 has some loyal customers, in the price game, enterprise 2's
demand and profit decrease when facing the market demand of enterprise 1. However, the
dual stocking channels of enterprise 2 enable enterprise 2 to have an advantage in the
Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences (aop) (aop) 1–10
Bertrand game with enterprise 1. The demand market for traditional trade stocking channels
faced by enterprise 2 is greater than that of enterprise 1. Profits of traditional trade stocking
channels have risen. As sales progress, more companies adopt traditional trade to enter the
market, which increases the elasticity of demand in the traditional trade market [11].
Enterprise 2 adopts a price reduction strategy to compete with Enterprise 1 completely
Bertrand, achieving Bertrand equilibrium in price competition. This will lead to reduced
profits. Corollary 1 shows that the existence of consumers who have a soft spot for cross-
border e-commerce stocking channels makes enterprise 2 raise prices in cross-border e-
commerce channels. However, due to the decrease in demand, profits will fall sharply.
4. The third stage: the game of channel and product competition among enterprises
In the second stage of Bertrand competition, this article only considers one commodity.
Because this product is completely replaceable, the competition is only channel competition.
In actual competition, companies often take the complementary cooperation between
commodities and channels and complement each other to occupy the market. In this stage,
this article considers that enterprise 1 uses complementary products to improve its
competitiveness. Then the demand function faced by enterprise 1 for product A under the
traditional trade stocking mode can be expressed as follows:

when companies 1 and 2 are playing Bertrand game.
Since the complementary commodity B has just entered the market and its demand elasticity
is small, enterprise 1 will choose to increase the price in order to occupy the market to obtain
excess profits. At the same time, company 1 will lower the price of commodity A as a bait to
increase sales profits. Due to the competitive relationship of commodity A, enterprise 2 will
respond to the price reduction in a timely manner. During the Bertrand game of price
reduction between the two parties, the elasticity of demand for commodity A gradually
increases. Since enterprise 1 uses complementary product B to occupy the market, it will use
the bundling strategy to increase the prices of products A and B at the same time. When the
demand elasticity of the cross-border e-commerce sales channel of commodity A increases,
enterprise 1 will reduce the price to counter enterprise 2. At the same time, enterprise 1 still
chooses to increase the price of commodity B as a supplement to the reduced profit of
commodity A. Similarly, Enterprise 2 will also respond to price cuts in traditional channels. It
will use cross-border e-commerce channels to increase prices to supplement profits.
5. Conclusion
This article establishes a three-stage game in the process of an import and export trade
enterprise's transformation to cross-border e-commerce. We use the Bertrand game model to
analyze the channel price game with market competitors in the second stage after the effect of
the first stage is reached. The article makes certain theoretical suggestions for enterprises to
rationally price in order to obtain high profits. Traditional trade stocking channels use the
introduction of complementary products as a strategy to counter cross-border e-commerce
stocking channels. Similarly, we use Bertrand game to analyze the pricing strategy of
enterprises in the game process.
