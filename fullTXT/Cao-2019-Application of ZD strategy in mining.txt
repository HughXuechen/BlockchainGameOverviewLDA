Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralized billing system that guarantees mutual trust among parties through decentralized data
storage, sophisticated encryption and signature technologies. The basis of blockchain is P2P distributed network, encryption
algorithm and consensus mechanism. To improve the reward during the process of mining, the mining pool will choose to
cooperate or attack with other mining pools. In this paper, the zero-determinant (ZD) strategy is applied to to optimize the
strategy selection during the mining process, which enforces mining pools selecting cooperative mining and thereby increase the
overall revenue of the pools. In addition, numerical illustrations are also presented to support our theoretical analysis.
Key Words: Blockchain, ZD strategy, mining game, infiltrate rate
1 Introduction
The formal proposal of blockchain technology can be
traced back to the idea of a bitcoin in 2008 by a scholar
named Nakamoto Satoshi, which is a distributed ledger tech-
nology in P2P networks. The advantage of blockchain tech-
nology lies in the decentralized design. It realizes point-to-
point transaction based on decentralized credit in a distribut-
ed network where nodes do not need to trust by using encryp-
tion algorithm, time stamp, tree structure, consensus mecha-
nism and reward mechanism. Blockchain technology is not
a single, completely new technology, but the integration of
various existing technologies, such as encryption algorithm-
s, P2P file transfer, and consensus mechanisms. These tech-
nologies are skillfully combined with databases to form a
new way of data recording, delivery, storage and presenta-
tion. Among them, the consensus mechanism has a very im-
portant position in the blockchain technology, which allows
the whole network nodes reaching a consensus and create a
trust-free accounting mechanism on the blockchain [1].
Bitcoin system applies blockchain as the underlying
framework supporting technology of the system, and
achieves the irreparable modification and unforgeability of
transactions through the consensus mechanism of Proof of
Work (PoW) [2]. The core idea of the PoW consensus mech-
anism is to ensure data consistency and consensus securi-
ty by introducing computational power competition of dis-
tributed nodes. Specifically, each node uses its own comput-
ing power to compete with each other to solve a SHA256
mathematical problem that is complex but easy to verify [3].
The node that first completes the problem will obtain the
transaction billing right and obtain certain rewards. In a bit-
coin system, the implementation of PoW produces a block.
The process of producing the block is also known as min-
ing and the nodes are called miners [4]. According to the
bitcoin system, a block is created every 10 minutes, which
means that a miner with very little mining power may not
be rewarded for a long time if he mines alone, so the miners
choose to join the pool.
A pool consists of a pool manager and a number of miners,
in which miners use computational power to mine and obtain

a return proportional to the computational power sending to
the manager. The sending part of the work proves to be no
value for the bitcoin system, and can only be used as a yard-
stick to measure the miners’ contribution to the calculation,
i.e. the miners do not contribute to the effective calculation
but gain some of the profits from the pool. This behavior is
called block withholding attack [9]. In a pool, miners can
intercept and attack the pool, sharing the benefits of the pool
with other miners. However, the pool can also use miners
to infiltrate into other pools, and block interception attacks
on other pools [7]. In the PoW consensus process, the pool
dilemma corresponds to the classical prisoner dilemma mod-
el [17]. The Nash equilibrium of the pool dilemma model is
mutual attack. However, the benefit of pool-to-pool mutual
attack is less than that of no attack, which means that the
system is not optimal. To improve the overall benefits of the
system, it is necessary to establish relevant mechanisms to
make the pool tend to cooperate [10, 16, 18, 19].
Zero determinant (ZD) strategy [5, 6] is a new method ris-
ing in the game theory in recent years. It can break the tradi-
tional Nash equilibrium theory and optimize the system in-
come [8]. Whatever strategy the opponent adopts, the party
adopting the ZD strategy can not only control the opponen-
t’s income[20], but also force the opponent to have a linear
relationship with his own income to achieve the optimal sys-
tem [11–15]. In this paper, we will use ZD strategy in the
pool game to optimize the system benefits, and ultimately
get higher returns.
The organizational structure of this paper is as follows:
The two-pool game is described in Section 2. The algorithm
of zero-determinant strategy is given in Section 3. Section 4
carries on the data simulation and the result analysis, which
indicates that the ZD strategy can effectively improve the
overall income. We summarizes our work in Section 5.
2 System model
In the process of mining, a pool can gain profit by the
power contributed by the pool members. Let the power of
the two mining pools is p1,p2 and 0 < pi < 1, i = 1, 2, 0 <
p1+ p2 ≤ 1. Without loss of generality, set the total revenue
R = 1. When the pool chooses to cooperate, it gets the m
reward, and when it chooses to attack, it gets the km(0 ≤
m ≤ 1, k ≥ 1) punishment, where k is the proportion of the
punishment to the reward. d(d ≥ 0) is the profit of the pool

that chooses to attack, d′ (d′ can be positive or negative) is
the final income of the mining pool when all pools choose to
attack. There is the situation of their payoff (see Table 1).
Table 1: Payoff of Pool
N A
N p1, p2 p1 +m− d, p2 − km+ d
A p1 − km+ d, p2 +m− d p1 − km− d′, p2 − km+ d′
The payoff of pool i(i = 1, 2) is pi · 1 = pi when both
pools choose N (Not to attack), that is, they do not send
miners into each other’s pool. When one pool chooses not
to attack and the other chooses to A( Attack), the pool that
chooses not to attack will get a reward m, but will lose d
revenue, its revenue is pi + m − d(i = 1, 2), the pool that
chooses to attack will be punished km, and get d revenue
from the pool that is attacked, its revenue is pi−km+d(i =
1, 2). When all pools choose to attack, the income of pool i
is pi +m± d′(i = 1, 2).
Next, we discuss the Nash equilibrium of the strategy.
• When m < d′ < d < km and m−d < d′−km < d−
km. When the mining pool 1 chooses not to attack, the
mining pool 2 increases its own revenue by selecting the
non-attack strategy; when the mining pool 1 selects the
attack strategy, the mining pool 2 will not significantly
reduce the revenue by selecting the attack. It can be
obtained that the Nash equilibrium points of the mining
pool 1 and the mining pool 2 are (N, N) and (A, A).
• When d > d′ > km. When the mining pool 1 chooses
not to attack, the mining pool 2 increases its own rev-
enue by selecting the attack strategy; when the mining
pool 1 selects the attack strategy, the mining pool 2 will
increase its own income by selecting the attack, so the
Nash equilibrium is (A, A).
• When d′ < d < m and m−d > 0, d′−km < d−km <
0. When the mining pool 1 chooses not to attack, the
mining pool 2 will not reduce its own revenue by se-
lecting the non-attack strategy; when the mining pool
1 selects the attack strategy, the mining pool 2 choos-
es not to attack the strategy to increase its own revenue
than the attack strategy. At this time, the Nash equilib-
rium point is (N, N).
It is analyzed that in the case of m < d′ < d < km and
m−d < d′−km < d−km, the Nash equilibrium is (N, N)
and (A, A). If both mining pools choose to attack each other,
then the income of the two mining pools will not be high
when the cooperation is selected, and the system revenue
will also decrease. In order to improve system revenue, we
apply the ZD strategy to the mining pool game.
3 Game optimization with ZD strategies
In the two-pool repeated game, the mining pool that
chooses the attack strategy will send its own loyal miners
to another mining pool to carry out block withholding at-
tacks to gain income, thereby increasing the income of its
own pool. We use ri,j , i, j = 1, 2 to indicate the infiltrate
ratio of the mining pool i to the mining pool j, and ri,i is
the power ratio of the mining pool itself, and
∑2
j=1 ri,j = 1,
0 ≤ ri,j < 1, i = 1, 2. The two-pool game model can
be regarded as the iterative prisoner dilemma model. The
pool can choose attack and non-attack strategies, which cor-
respond to competition and cooperation respectively. There-
fore, the probability of selecting the cooperation of the min-
ing pool i is ri,i, and the probability of selecting the attack
is ri,j . In each round of the game, each mining pool has
four conditions: (N, N), (N, A), (A, N), (A, A). The mixed
strategy choices for mining pool 1 and mining pool 2 are
r1 = (r11,1, r

r1 and r2 are the change vectors for selecting the N strategy
in the next round of game, ie, r11,1 is the probability that pool
1 choose N strategy in the next round of game when pool
1 and the pool 2 choose N strategy in the current game, the
probability of selecting the A strategy is 1−r11,1, that is, r11,2.
The probability that the mining pool 2 selects the strategy N
is r12,2, and the A strategy is selected with the probability of
1−r12,2 = r12,1. Similarly, r21,1, r

1,1 and r41,1 are respectively
expressed as the probability of selecting N strategy of pool
1 in the next round of game when the behavior of the pool 1
is (N, A), (A, N), (A, A) in the current game, the probability
of choosing A strategy is r21,2, r

are respectively expressed as the probability of selecting N
strategy of pool 2 in the next round of game when the behav-

the probability of choosing A strategy is r22,1, r

The process of the repeated game between the mining pool

chain, and the corresponding probability transfer matrix is:

Because the M matrix has a characteristic vector whose
eigenvalues are one. Let M ′ = M − I , then M ′ is ir-
reversible, and the determinant is equal to zero. Define
the steady-state distribution vector of the M matrix as v,
v = (v1, v2, v3, v4)
T and
∑4
i=1 vi = 1, then
vT ·M = vT , (3)
i.e.
vTM ′ = 0. (4)
It is known from the properties of Kramm’s law and the ad-
joint matrix:
Adj(M ′)M ′ = det(M ′)I, (5)
then each row of Adj(M ′) is linearly related to vT . We
select any vector of four elements f = (f1, f2, f3, f4)

The second column and the third column of the determinant
are separately controlled by the mining pool 1 and the min-
ing pool 2. By the nature of the Markov chain, the payoff of
the pools at steady state are:

then:

2,2), if the mixing strategy of the pool
1 satisfies r′1 = φ(αw1 + βw2 − γ · 1), φ is a non-zero
parameter, or the mixing strategy of the pool 2 satisfies r′2 =
φ(αw1 + βw2 − γ · 1), then:
αe1 + βe2 − γ = 0 (10)
We call the strategy adopted by pool 1 or pool 2 as zero
determinant strategy. It can be seen from the formula that
when one of the pools adopts zero determinant strategy, no
matter what strategy the other side adopts, it can always keep
a linear relationship between the expected returns of the two
pools and satisfy γ = αe1 + βe2.
Corollary 1. Assuming that pool 1 adopts a zero determi-
nant strategy, the parameters α and β satisfy:
−1 ≤ α
β

parameter γ satisfies:
γ ≤ min{αp1+βp2, α(p1+m−d)+β(p2−km+d)}, (12)
γ ≥ max{α(p1 − km+ d) + β(p2 +m− d),
α(p1 − km− d′) + β(p2 − km+ d′)}. (13)
Proof. According to Eq.(10), α
β < 0, when pool 1 adopts
zero determinant strategy, it needs to satisfy r′1 = φ(αw1 +
βw2 − γ · 1), that is:

The probability ri1,1(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the hybrid strategy
needs to satisfy 0 ≤ ri1,1 ≤ 1, which is:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
0 ≤ r11,1=φ(αp1 + βp2 − γ) + 1 ≤ 1
0 ≤ r21,1=φ[α(p1 +m− d) + β(p2 − km+ d)− γ] + 1 ≤ 1
0 ≤ r31,1=φ[α(p1 − km+ d) + β(p2 +m− d)− γ] ≤ 1
0 ≤ r41,1=φ[α(p1 − km− d′) + β(p2 − km+ d′)− γ] ≤ 1
.
(15)
In the Eq.(15), when φ > 0, there are:
γ ≥ max{αp1+βp2, α(p1+m−d)+β(p2−km+d)} (16)
γ ≤ min{α(p1 − km+ d) + β(p2 +m− d),
α(p1 − km− d′) + β(p2 − km+ d′)}. (17)
In the mining pool game model, there is p1 − km + d ≥
p1 +m − d, p2 − km + d ≥ p2 +m − d. Without loss of
generality, assuming α < 0, β > 0, then
α(p1+m−d)+β(p2−km+d)≥α(p1−km+d)+β(p2+m−d).
(18)
Obviously, inequality (18) is incompatible with inequality
(16) and (17).
When φ < 0,
γ ≤ min{αp1+βp2, α(p1+m−d)+β(p2−km+d)} (19)
γ ≥ max{α(p1 − km+ d) + β(p2 +m− d),
α(p1 − km− d′) + β(p2 − km+ d′)}. (20)
By inequality (19), (20), it is necessary to satisfy
α(p1 − km− d′) + β(p2 − km+ d′) ≤ αp1 + βp2, (21)
namely,
α
β
≥ −(−km+ d′)
−km− d′

−km− d′
= −1. (22)
In summary, when the mining pool 1 adopts the zero de-
terminant strategy, that is,r′1 = φ(αw1 + βw2 − γ · 1), the
parameters α, β satisfy the inequality (11), and the parame-
ter γ satisfies the inequalities (12) and (13).
Corollary 2. When α = 0, the pool 1 adopts the ZD strategy
to satisfy r′1 = φ(βw2 − γ · 1), and βe2 − γ = 0, it can be
launched:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨

r11,1 = φ(p2

r31,1 = φ(p2+m−d
e2 − 1)γ
r41,1 = φ(p2−km+d′
e2 − 1)γ
. (23)
Theorem 1. When the pool 1 adopts zero determinant strat-
egy to achieve maximum overall payoff, we can get specific
zero determinant strategy as follows:
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
r11,1 = 1
r21,1 = φ[α(m− d) + β(−km+ d)] + 1
r31,1 = φ[α(−km+ d) + β(m− d)]
r41,1 = φ[α(−km− d′) + β(−km+ d′)]
. (24)
Under this strategy choice, the profit of the two pools can
reach a higher value, and the total income can reach up to
w = w1
1 + w2
1 .
Proof. Let e1 = w1
1 , e2 = w2
1 , it can be proved by combin-
ing with Eq.(10) and Eq.(14).

4 Numerical simulation and result analysis
Based on the two-pool game model analysis in Section 3,
this section will verify the feasibility of adopting the ZD s-
trategy in the mining pool through numerical simulation, that
is, what the infiltrate ratio of the mining pool is controlled,
the highest profit can be achieved. The main experimental
tool used in this section is Matlab. The mining pool adopts
zero determinant strategy to control its own linear relation-
ship with the counterpart’s income. The relevant parameters
are set as follows: the mining pool get the reward m = 0.1
for choosing not to attack, and the ratio of punishment to
reward is k = 3, then km = 0.3, in addition, d = 0.28,
d′ = 0.15, φ = − 1
45 , α = −1,β = 7. Let us first consider
the case where the two mining pools have the same power,
assuming p1 = 0.5, p2 = 0.5.
In Fig.1, the mining pool 2 has always adopted the
TFT strategy, and the mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strate-
gy, TFT strategy, WSLS strategy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3) strategy,
(0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy. We can see that the payoff of the

mining pool 1 can reach a better value after a certain itera-
tion when it adopts the ZD strategy, but the other four strate-
gies can not. In addition, when the mining pool 1 adopts the
TFT and WSLS strategy, the change trend of their income
are completely similar in the iterative process.
In Fig.2, the mining pool 2 has always adopted the
WSLS strategy, and the mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strat-
egy, TFT strategy, WSLS strategy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3) strate-
gy,(0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy. From the image we can see that
when both the mining pool 1 and the mining pool 2 use the
WSLS strategy, the payoff of the mining pool 1 is the low-
est at the beginning, but after several iterations, it reaches
the highest value very quickly. Although after some itera-
tions, the mining pool 1 can achieve a higher return when
using the ZD strategy, but it is lower than the gain from us-
ing the WSLS strategy. This shows that the adoption of the
ZD strategy does not necessarily lead to the highest value of
revenue, but only to achieve a better value. Obviously, in this
case, adopting the WSLS strategy is the best choice.

Fig. 6: The income of the pool 1 when it adopts other strate-
gies and pool 2 adopts (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy.
In Fig.3, the mining pool 2 has always adopted the
(0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3) strategy, and the mining pool 1 adopts the
ZD strategy, TFT strategy, WSLS strategy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3)
strategy, (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy. By comparison, the min-
ing pool 1 has a significant advantage over the other four s-
trategies when adopting the ZD strategy, although these five
strategic choices can not make the income of the mining pool
1 reach the highest value. What’s more, there is a tendency to
reduce revenue when the mining pool adopts TFT and (0.7,
0.3, 0.5, 0.1) strategy. When the mining pool 1 adopts the
ZD strategy, the WSLS strategy and the TFT strategy, the
initial benefits are equal, but after iteration, it develops to-
ward three different trends. In Fig.4, the mining pool 2 has
always adopted the (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy, and the mining
pool 1 adopts the ZD strategy, TFT strategy, WSLS strat-
egy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3) strategy, (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy. In
the beginning, the benefits obtained by the five strategies are
similar, but after several iterations, only when the ZD strate-
gy is adopted, the trend of the payoff of the mining pool 1 is
gradually increasing and reaching a better value. The other
four strategies all have a downward trend change. By com-

paring several sets of simulation results, we find that the ZD
strategy adopted by the mining pool in the game process can
not guarantee the highest return, but it can always keep the
income within a better range. Therefore, in order to achieve
a better profit , the ZD strategy is indeed a good choice.
Next, let’s make α = 0 and observe the change of benefit
of the mining pool 1 through simulation results. In Fig.5, the
mining pool 2 has always adopted the TFT strategy, and the
mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strategy, TFT strategy, WSLS
strategy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3) strategy, (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy.
Comparing Fig.5 with Fig.1, the overall revenue change of
the mining pool 1 does not change much. However, the
speed of achieving the optimal income is faster than that
of α = −1, when the mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strat-
egy. In Fig.6, the mining pool 2 has always adopted the
(0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy, and the mining pool 1 adopts the
ZD strategy, TFT strategy, WSLS strategy, (0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3)
strategy, (0.7,0.3,0.5,0.1) strategy. Comparing Fig.6 with
Fig.4, when the mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strategy, the
speed of achieving the optimal return is faster than α = −1,
and the optimal income is also relatively high. There are

no major differences in the profit changes of the other four
strategic choices.
In Fig.7, we use simulation results to observe whether the
unequal initial power of the pools affect the total return. In
the case of setting different initial power of the mining pool-
s, the mining pool 1 adopts the ZD strategy, and the mining
pool 2 adopts the TFT strategy. We find that different initial
power do not affect the change in the total income of the two
pools. Under the setting of four different initial powers, the
total income of the mining pool can reach the highest. Final-
ly, we take different values for the parameter φ and observe
the impact on the total income of the pools. In Fig.8, let φ be
equal to four groups of different numbers. Through the sim-
ulation results, we find that the value of φ affects the speed
of reaching the highest returns, but does not affect the final
returns, and the greater the φ value, the faster the maximum
returns are achieved. That is to say, the value of φ is posi-
tively correlated with the speed at which the optimal value
of the income is reached.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed ZD strategy algorithm to
optimize the strategy selection of the mining pool. In terms
of the ZD strategy, we can control the other party’s revenue
and promote the total revenue of the two mining pools. We
have found that the speed at which the mining pool adopts
the ZD strategy to reach the optimal value when α = 0 is
greater than when α = −1. Further, regardless of the initial
power of the mining pool, it does not affect the optimiza-
tion of the mining pool strategy selection by the ZD strategy
algorithm.
Block chain technology is widely used in today’s soci-
ety, and has a good development prospects. PoW consen-
sus mechanism plays a very important role in block chain
technology. When nodes attack each other, it will affec-
t the security of block chain technology. In this paper, the
ZD strategy is applied in the mining pool game, which can
optimize the choice of mining pool, promote the coopera-
tion of the mining pool, and improve the system revenue.
In addition, blockchain technology brings together decen-
tralized, decentralized data storage, consensus mechanisms,
mature encryption, signature and other computer technolo-
gies. This paper studies the problems in consensus mecha-
nism, but there are still more directions for the whole block
chain technology to be discussed in depth.
