A Review of Challenges and Solution
in Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading
of Renewable Sources
Ritweek Das, Stuti Snata Ray, Gayatri Mohapatra, and Sanjeeb Kumar Kar
Abstract Peer-to-peer energy trading is the futuristic approach to conserve and trade
renewable sources of energy in an economical manner. Peer-to-peer trading leads to a
decentralized open free market which benefits both the prosumers who have surplus
energy and the consumer with energy deficit. This paper provides a review on the
challenges, outcomes, solutions and future research that should be conducted in this
area. The various challenges are integrating generation, transmission in a large scale,
efficient control of microgrid, developing smart energy meter, complex behavior of
prosumers and consumers. The areas of consideration by the previous researchers are
game theory, simulation, trading platform, blockchain, optimization and algorithms.
We provide a solution by creating a POWERITER cryptocurrency to trade power
within local microgrid within blockchain ecosystem for transparency and secured
features. It will be a public distributed ledger with proper timestamp consensus. The
miners will be rewarded POWERITER tokens to maintain the ledger. This paper will
help the researchers for qualitative and quantitative analysis of peer-to-peer energy
trading technologies. It is a relatively new topic; there must be a further research to
implement this concept in the real-time environment.

28.1 Introduction
Energy sector is themost crucial and important paradigm for infrastructure, economic
development andwelfare of nations [1]. Traditionally, we depend on the conventional
sources of energy such as coal, natural gases, oil, hydro and nuclear power which
lead to pollution. The researchers are constantly working on the renewable sources
of energy to meet the increasing demand of electricity. According to IBEF report,
“by 2022, solar energy is estimated to contribute 114 GW, followed by 67 GW from
wind power and 15 GW from biomass and hydropower. The target for renewable
energy has been increased to 227 GW by 2022” [2].
The global investment in the power sector as shown in Fig. 28.1 is increasing
every year. Since there is a huge investment in the production of electricity, there
is monopoly of big corporation. They can manipulate the price according to their
connivance which will affect the consumers [3]. There must be a free open market to
trade electricity which will lead to competitive pricing [4]. Energy trading benefits
the corporation such as increasing the overall efficiency and reducing operating cost.

The p2p transfer of electricity is initially possible for prosumers. The genera-
tion of electricity is unpredictability and intermittent characteristic of DER [5]. The
prosumers have two choices either they can store energy or they can sell it to energy
deficit region. The major challenge is to balance the demand and supply effectively
[6]. The p2p architecture for transfer to energy has been classified into two types that
are trading architecture and optimization model.
28.2 Overview of Peer-to-Peer Architecture
28.2.1 Trading Architecture
The energy trading architecture is the decentralized transfer of power among the
peers without involving any single entity. In this, the prosumers generate electricity
in a small scale from the rooftop solar panel.When prosumers have surplus of energy,
they can sell to consumers in the power grid as given in Fig. 28.2.There are four layers
for p2p energy trading, namely business layer, control layer, ICT layer and power
grid layer.
28.2.2 Optimization Model
In power systems, consumer demand varies from time to time. During the peak
hours, the load can cause frequency deviation which can lead to system failure. The
utility companies always balance the demand and supply by load scheduling and
price-based optimization.
310 R. Das et al.
Load scheduling is achieved through variousmethods including interruptible load,
direct load control (DLR) which allows the power company to manipulate customer
appliances and demand side bidding (DSB) where the customer is allowed to prepare
a bid.
There are three types of optimization model.
Centrally controlled model
In this model, there is a central controller which connects two local grids. It can
optimize the availability in the peak hours. This model is a non-profitable model
because the local cannot compete with the utility company pricing. This model can
only be implemented by utility companies, and it can be used in rural areas.
Incentive-driven model
The incentive model helps to reduce the transportation cost. The prosumers get
incentive to contribute more in an ecosystem. The grid operator coordinates energy
sharing by matching supply and demand between sellers and buyers as well as by
providing the infrastructure for energy routing. The incentive can be in form of price,
auction and smart contracts.
Cooperative-based model
Cooperative model allows a base station having local renewable energy to perform
energy trading with the main grid based on coordinated multi-point communica-
tion powered by smart grids. “It minimizes the energy cost of cellular systems by
providing an algorithm that allows the BS and the smart grid to manage the two-way
energy trading. The demand from BS varies over time due to the fluctuation in power
generated from renewable energy sources. The proposed model allows the BS to sell
electricity to the grid when the power generated from renewable energy sources is
excess and to buy power from the grid when the production is low” [6].
28.3 Comparison with Existing Models
We have done the tabulation of the following data from the proposed models [7–11]
as given in Table 28.1.
28.4 Challenges in the Proposed Model
Energy management in smart grid
There are many challenges while depending on only renewable or traditional sources
of energy. There is a challenge in optimizing peak demand and load dependency. In
traditional system, the operating cost is very high [12]. In the renewable system,

the initial cost is high for households. The transmission is bit complicated, and the
system is less efficient.
Security, transparency and transaction time
In traditional system, there is less transparency. The transaction speed is very slowly.
The security in a transaction is comprised by utility operators. There are many new
technologies which have almost solved the problem like blockchain, smart contract,
IoT and AI, cryptocurrencies, etc. [13].
28.5 Proposed Solution
In this model, we are using solar energy for energy management for multiple homes
and transfer of electricity from one home to other in case of energy deficiency faced
by the neighborhood grids. The primary goals are to maximize financial benefit and
reduce the peak of the upstream grid [14]. This way, the proposed manages each
home energy hub’s energy generation and storage, as well as energy purchase and
sale, on two levels: lower and upper level. As the solar panel is set to full power point
monitoring (MPPT) so we will connect a DC-DC converter to extract maximum
power from the solar panel. This will operate the solar panel at maximum power and
will step down to supply the HVDC bus. We have used a bidirectional battery which
is beneficial in rainy days [15]. Then, we will connect an inverter that will have input
as DC and will convert it to 230 V AC which will be supplied to home. A common
AC bus bar to the houses will transfer the energy when needed [16].
28.6 Future Outcomes
Thep2p architecturewill be the integral part of the power system.Therewill be highly
optimized smart grid which will reduce the operating cost and increase the efficiency.
There will be complete dependency on renewable sources of energy to reduce carbon
footprint in the ecosystem. The new technologies will create a transparent, secured
method of payment [17]. The algorithm of various technologies can be applied in
the power system which will helpful in generation, transmission and consumption.
As we know now government is promoting e vehicle and there is huge opportunity
we can use our system to charge electric cars [18].
28.7 Conclusion
We are designing a business model which will be helpful for both consumer and
suppliers. Our POWERITER cryptocurrency can be used in energy sector to trade

surplus power among prosumers. We have free market to have competitive pricing
which will benefit the consumers. We have given the incentive to suppliers (miners)
to generate POWERITER cryptocurrency and make profit while trading it with fiat
currency. Everything is transparent because of public distributed ledger blockchain.
We promote the use of renewable energy by giving incentive to both buyer and
supplier.
