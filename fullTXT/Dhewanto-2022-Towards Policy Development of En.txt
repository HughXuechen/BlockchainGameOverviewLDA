ABSTRACT
Finance sector is one of the crucial sectors with high potential
growth in Indonesia. However, the sector face challenges because
the policies have not been able to cover the headway of the fi-
nancial technology. Furthermore, the finance sector perceived as
lack of interactive cooperation between the stakeholder in the
game, which makes its ecosystem less entrepreneurial. This re-
search assesses policy development through a literature review
on the entrepreneurial ecosystem of financial technology. Finan-
cial technology devises innovation to add more value between
consumers and businesses —this study draws attention to the fi-
nancial technology sector, which has matured compared to other
industries. The study deployed a qualitative approach using an
entrepreneurial framework by Isenberg, which discussed actors,
roles, infrastructure, organizations, and actions that produce an en-
vironment that supports entrepreneurs. The results show the player
and key roles among regulators’ policies and consumers of finan-
cial technology, especially when it relates to the benefit perceived.
There are also overlapping related to delivering support for finan-
cial technology between regulators, but lack of social performance
improvement. Current disruptive technology in finance, such as
artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data,
could play vital roles in achieving sustainability. The framework of
the entrepreneurial ecosystem is given to provide an understanding
of the policy strategy in the financial technology case.

1 INTRODUCTION
The financial sector has an important role in the economy and
continues to develop according to the needs of the community. In-
novation in the financial sector is known as financial technology.
Financial Technology, shortly called Fintech, is a combined result
of financial services with technology that eventually changes the
business model from conventional to modern [1]. Initially, in the
financial sector, people did business in face-to-face payments carry-
ing cash. However, they now facilitate long-distance transactions
by making payments that can be processed in seconds. Press Re-
port from Bank Indonesia (2021) stated that there are more than
320 Fintech startups currently operating in Indonesia. Chair of the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce mentioned that fintech has the
potential to help provide alternative sources of financing for Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), facilitating inclusive and
stronger growth. Currently, although MSMEs contribute 60% to
GDP and 97 percent of employment, only 25% of MSMEs receive the
required financing. Therefore, fintech allegedly has the potential to
increase the inclusiveness of financial services, especially for the
100 million population who still do not have a banking account and
cannot access financial services from banks. During pandemic, the
success of traditional business actors from the region in expand-
ing their business thanks to the support of digital technology and
fintech [2].
Fintech emerged in line with changes in society’s lifestyle, which
fast-paced users of information technology currently dominate [3].
With Fintech, problems in business transactions and payments,
such as not having time to look for goods in offline shopping places,
banks/ATMs to transfer funds, and reluctance to visit a site because
unpleasant services can be minimized. In other words, Fintech
helps transactions and payment systems become more efficient
and economical but remain effective. The rapid change of fintech
is encouraged by Bank Indonesia, the Central Bank of the Repub-
lic of Indonesia, to ensure that the payment traffic that has been
penetrated by technology continues to run in an orderly and safe
manner. Regarding fintech policies, it has been regulated through
Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 18/40/PBI/2016 about Implementa-
tion of Payment Transaction Processing, Bank Indonesia Circular
No. 18/22/DKSP Regarding the Implementation of Digital Financial
Services, and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 18/17/PBI/2016 about
Electronic Money. Indonesia’s finance sector is sufficient in com-
pliance of available rules. However, the problems arise since the

growth of technology is not keep up with the pace of the regula-
tion. Thus, the financial sector lagged behind. The current issue on
financial sector also included sustainable finance and lack of risk
assessment initiatives [4].
The Fintech in ASEAN 2021 [5] report shows the composition
of Indonesian financial technology (fintech) companies or financial
technology is dominated by payment and loan applications. As
many as 29% of Indonesian fintech companies are engaged in pay-
ments, and 23% of companies are involved in loans. In the report,
the large composition of companies involved in this sector is mainly
due to the many people who are not served by banks (unbanked) or
are not served by banks (underbanked). Furthermore, investment
technology covers 14% and financial, and accounting technology
covers 13% of the total fintech companies in Indonesia. Meanwhile,
companies engaged in new cryptocurrencies account for 8% of the
entire companies.
The Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or
OJK) Report in 2021 [6] noted that the distribution of fintech P2P
(Peer to Peer) lending loans reached Rp. 13.78 trillion ≈ USD 936
million, as of January 2022. This value was up 1.32% compared
to the previous month, Rp. 13.60 trillion ≈ USD 924 million. The
distribution of fintech lending loans in January 2022 also increased
46.90% compared to the same period last year. In January 2021,
the distribution of fintech lending was recorded at Rp. 9.38 trillion
≈ USD 637 million. The fintech lending loans were distributed to
13.56 million borrowing entities (borrowers) in February 2022. The
number of borrowers increased slightly by 0.66% compared to the
previous month. The majority of 10.78 million borrowers came from
the Java region. Rp 8.43 trillion or around USD 572 million in loans,
or 61.21%, was given to the productive sector. Of that amount, Rp
2.92 ≈ USD 198 million trillion was loaned to other non-business
sectors. Loans disbursed to the wholesale and retail trade sector
reached Rp 2.17 trillion ≈ USD 147 million. Meanwhile, loans to
the household sector were recorded at Rp 690.81 billion (≈ USD
46 million). In terms of lenders, the number reached 10.45 million
entities with Rp 10.83 trillion (≈ USD 735 million). During this
period, cooperative lending by institutional lenders (super lenders)
was contributed by 69 conventional financial service institutions
amounting to Rp 1.81 trillion (≈ USD 122 million). This shown the
Indonesian finance sector is large and is one of the backbones with
great potential growth.
Indonesia’s financial service indicates to drive entrepreneurial
ecosystem in a country [7]. However, the real value of a technol-
ogy can be realized when it is being implemented together with
the improvement of the entrepreneurship ecosystem [8]. There
is limited research on the ongoing scholarly discussion related to
financial technology sector in Indonesia with its relation to policy
in terms of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially in Indonesia.
Thus, this study intends to discover and understand deeper of the
actors, roles, infrastructure, organizations, and actions that produce
an environment that supports entrepreneurs. This study research
questions are 1) How is current policy of financial technology sec-
tor in Indonesia that is supporting entrepreneurial ecosystem? 2)
What are the recommended policy improvements for the fintech
sector? Finding out a better theoretical comprehension of the issues
and policies, this study also mapping the classification of actors,
roles, infrastructure, organizations, and actions that produce an
environment that supports entrepreneurs. Therefore, this research
main goal is to raise understanding and offer a conceptual frame-
work that could assist future research and shed light on the further
challenge issue in financial technology sector of Indonesia.
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section, the literature review will discuss about the ongoing
scholarly which relevant to the topic of research. Therefore, the
explanation divided into two categories: policy development in en-
trepreneurial ecosystem and review of financial technology sector
in Indonesia.
2.1 Policy Development in Entrepreneurial
Ecosystem
The entrepreneurial ecosystem [9] discusses the collaboration
of players, functions, infrastructure, institutions, and occa-
sions/activities that enable an environment that advocates en-
trepreneurial activity. The entrepreneurial ecosystem is assembled
from various elements and counterparts with incorporated aids to
achieve entrepreneurial goals and is established on shared peril and
prospect.
Policy development that advocates an entrepreneurial ecosystem
in this research is related to government action towards financial
technology through reviewing and resolving issues such as con-
sumer protection, financial integrity, and legislation chain—a signif-
icant regulation part of business activity [10]. The financial sector
is one of the most influenced industries by the regulatory circum-
stances due to its regulatory orders for transparency and market
risk reduction [11]. As to support its policy development regard-
ing entrepreneurial ecosystem, government assist the entrepreneur
with incubators. The incubator is considered a bridge between "fin"
and "tech" which makes fintech superior with exponential growth
[12]. In 2022, Indonesia has 85 incubators listed under Technology
Business Incubator Institute. [13]. The number is assumed too low
for the entrepreneur ecosystem to improve. The entrepreneurship
program is carried out by the National Research and Innovation
Agency (Badan Research and Innovation Nasional or BRIN) and the
Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. There
are 14 programs as tabulated in Table 1. Most of the entrepreneurial
policy in Indonesia is targeted towards higher education students.
Fortunately, most of the support are dedicated to entrepreneurs or
startups in technology sector.
The ratio of the entrepreneurs’ number to the population in
Indonesia is lower than in some countries in Southeast Asia. The
balance is only 3.47 percent, much lower than Singapore’s (7 per-
cent). One of the factors for the low number of entrepreneurs in
Indonesia is the lack of highly skilled individuals. According to
a report by the research institute SMERU, only 0.5 per 100 indi-
viduals aged 15 years have remarkable skills [14]. Other countries
also had better results, such as the United States with 6.5 per 100
individuals, Thailand with 9.4 and South Korea with 18.2. The low
percentage is because the educational curriculum only focuses on
technical skills, such as reading, memorizing, and arithmetic, but
has not yet accustomed individuals to thinking critically, analyt-
ically, and solving problems. The lack of individual skills makes
it difficult for Indonesia to produce new entrepreneurs. Related to

entrepreneur education, Indonesia only has 33 Entrepreneurship
Study Programs that have been accredited [15]. Currently, The
Presidential Decree on National Entrepreneurship Development is
needed to catch up with the number of entrepreneurs in Indonesia,
which still reaches 3.47 percent. The government targets the growth
of the entrepreneurship ratio in 2024 to reach 3.95 percent so that
the national economic structure grows stronger. The government
fosters this number by announcing the Presidential Regulation of
the Republic of Indonesia Number 2 of 2022 about National En-
trepreneurship Development 2021-2024. The facilities as referred
to in the Regulation in Article 11 are given to Entrepreneurs in the
form of registration of business licenses; facilitation of domestic
and export standardization and certification; access to financing;
priority in the procurement of government goods and services; pri-
oritizing State-Owned Enterprise digital market access; gain access
to the supply of raw materials and auxiliary materials; accessing
public facilities including commercial area land, shopping areas,
and strategic promotion places on public infrastructure; conduct-
ing research and business development; gain access to increasing
business capacity through mentoring, education and training, and
technical guidance.
The policy development on the entrepreneurial ecosystem is
now in the embryonic phase. However, the policy development
related to financial technology is not created yet, even though the
business has high potential. From 2018 to 2021, the Investment
Alert Task Force closed 3,365 illegal online loans in Indonesia. This
data reflects that it is a real challenge for industry players who com-
mit to keeping their industry good and from the regulator’s side.
The Minister of Finance revealed that the government legislative is
currently drafting a Bill for the Development and Strengthening
of the Financial Sector. This Bill will discuss the definition and
scope of fintech, fintech operating legal entities, regulation and
supervision, coordination of fintech supervision and development
arrangements, licensing of fintech associations, and consumer pro-
tection [17]. Even in the future, in this Bill, the term "fintech" will
be changed to "financial sector technology innovation" to cover
activities within a reasonably broad industry. Furthermore, The
Financial Services Authority will introduce a regulatory sandbox
that allows digital financial innovation to develop [18]. Further-
more, policy related to digital economy [2] agreed on 12 elements
strongly associated to fintech: (1) strengthening fintech commit-
ments (2) enabling new technologies to improve financial service
provision (3) strengthening competition and commitment to open,
free, and fair competition (4) encouraging fintech to promote fi-
nancial inclusion and financial market development (5) monitoring
developments in deepening understanding of emerging financial
systems (6) (adapting regulatory and supervisory frameworks for
regular development and financial system stability (7) maintaining
financial system integrity- (8) modernization of legal frameworks
for provision of legal landscape (9) domestic monetary and financial
system stability (10) financial and data infrastructure to maintain
sustainability of fintech benefits (11) encouraging international
cooperation and information exchange (12) increasing collective
oversight of international monetary and financial systems.
2.2 Review of Financial Technology Sector in
Indonesia
Financial services describe business conducts, advantages and sat-
isfactions correlated with the sale of capital that delivers users
and consumers economic value. The financial services business
is changing its service by stressing customer-centric benefits that
would be apt of merging acceleration and flexibility, endowed by
techniques and cutting-edge innovation. Financial Services Au-
thority Indonesia represented “FinTech” as when financial service
business changes their business by employing technology to pro-
vide financial solutions, which directs to numerous innovations
such as Internet Banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, peer-
to-peer lending, Robo-Advisory, artificial intelligence for online
identification, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and much more to come.
The evolution of financial technology until now has been evolved
into three phases [19]: FinTech 1.0, FinTech 2.0, FinTech 3.0 and
in the future, is predicted to be FinTech 4.0. The first generation
of FinTech, called FinTech 1.0, transpired from 1866 until 1967, is
still analog using telegraph and telephone. The second generation
named FinTech 2.0, where developed nations commence employing
and innovating technologies such as ATM (Automatic Teller Ma-
chine) and e-banking. The third period, called FinTech 3.0, formed
in 2009 until now. FinTech 3.0 demonstrates that providers of fi-
nancial services might not exclusively be in the regulated financial
services industry, which is ascertained by the arrival of the non-
bank institution, mainly uses a technology innovation in its process.
FinTech 3.0 happened in developed countries due to its linkage to
the financial crisis in 2008.
Fintech appeared fast in Indonesia in 2010 [20]. This emergence
resulted from Indonesia’s massively grown communication and
provider technology during the prior decade, which delivered on-
line and mobile approaches. There are six Fintech participants in
Indonesia: the nonbank payment system, investment management,
funding, insurance, market provisioning, and deposit & lending.
Fintech in Southeast Asia has ample prospects to unravel the fi-
nancial circumstances’ considerable problems [21]. Fintech has a
significant role, with an estimated value of $40 billion and annual
growth of nearly 50%. By 2025, fintech will be worth more than
$100 billion, driven by existing digital services. Fintech in Indonesia
is the most dynamic and competitive sector in the world. This is
shown by the presence of 4 fintech unicorns with a value of more
than $1 billion and one decacorn with a value of more than $10
billion [18]. At the beginning of fintech development in 2016, the
available service solutions focused only on payments and loans. In 4
years, fintech services have developed into various business models,
including digital capital raising, InsurTech, andmarket provisioning
[18]. Digital banking and electronic money are escalated to grow
by 30.1% (YoY) and 35.7% (YoY) [22]. Fintech lending developed
fast, with outstanding loans in August 2021 significantly boosted
to Rp. 26.09 trillion, with total new loans throughout 2021 bear-
ing Rp. 101.47 trillion. Behind future great innovation possibilities,
Indonesia is still facing challenges in creating an excellent digital
economy ecosystem. The 2020 Indonesia Global Innovation Index
shows Indonesia’s rank is 85th out of 131 nations. Furthermore, the
2020 Indonesian Digital Literacy Index is on a medium scale.

Towards Policy Development of Entrepreneurial Ecosystem: A Review in Indonesia Financial Technology Sector ICIBE 2022, September 27–29, 2022, Macau, China
Bank Indonesia has taken several steps to support the accelera-
tion of digital transformation [2], for instance: (1) publishing the
Blueprint of Indonesia Payment System 2025; (2) launching national
standardization in the payment system in the form of QRIS (Quick
Response Code Indonesian Standard) and SNAP (National Stan-
dard Open API Payments); (3) Prepare digital innovations for retail
payment systems through BI-FAST; (4) reforming payment sys-
tem regulations; and (5) improving government program services
through electronification of the distribution of social assistance
funds. The movement shows that Indonesia’s fintech is accelerated
and supported well mannered.
3 METHODOLOGY
The study utilizes qualitative methodology [23] to investigate per-
tinent literature on financial technology policies in Indonesia to
comprehend its transition over the years and what subjects entail in
the present state. The literature is also strengthened by appropriate
policy documents, relevant news articles, and views from an expert.
The data organized is to be scrutinized by looking at the policy of
entrepreneurship and fintech. The current ongoing policy revision
and more recent mechanisms are also reevaluated. Since some ap-
proaches only exist in Indonesia, this study provided a proposition
by examining fintech policies and a chance of a research agenda
related to fintech.
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Mapping of Player and Key Role Indonesia
based on Entrepreneurial Ecosystem
The fintech policies here would be divided based on the Isenberg
classification of Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in the Policy domain
[9], Leadership and Government. The leadership will be related
to support, social legitimacy, advocate, entrepreneurship strategy,
urgency, crisis and challenge—meanwhile, the government insti-
tutions, financial aid, regulatory framework, research institutes,
venture-friendly legislation. The leadership subdomain comes from
the community or private institutions—the leadership subdomain
example is the emergence of the fintech association and its financial
solution alternatives. The government subdomain is understood
as the output of government institutions, for example, the ease to
start a business, tax incentives, and laws that could encourage the
climate for business to improve, technology infrastructure. Both
the leadership and government subdomain will be explained on
who the player is and what is the crucial role.
In the leadership domain, the featured only player, and their
key roles, since the regulation is mostly for an internal or informal
suggestion. Table 2 elaborates that the key player in fintech in sub-
domain leadership is the association, fintech startups, education
and training institutions, business players and media. Collaboration
with each player is promoted. Intermediate information channel
collaboration by utilizing available data and through distribution
channels that each player has built. Utilization of the Fintech func-
tion is expected to improve the business efficiency of banks and
institutions. Fintech or other key players have a consumer database
as a valuable resource. The database is utilized as a system built
to run a specific financial transaction mechanism. However, the
public trust in banking or fintech is still low because it is often
considered to endanger data privacy. In addition, fintech is also
considered scary because of the proliferation of high-interest shark
loans (maximum around 25% per year) [16].
Table 3 details the regulation related to the government subdo-
main. Various financial innovations that emerge will attract the
attention of the Indonesian consumer and providers to use financial
services to align with the government’s expectations. So, in the
future Indonesia’s financial literacy and inclusion index will in-
crease. These policy innovations will significantly assist the people
in carrying out their supervisory function of the government. On
the other hand, the government also minimizes corruption because
the public can easily access detailed information. Applying such
fintech, coupled with a cashless society, will undoubtedly overhaul
the practice of bribery and extortion. With a cashless society that
is fully realized, there will be no corrupt transactions through cash.
And the only trade sent via digital money is through fintech. With
the existence of fintech, everything will be recorded in detail and ac-
curately. Besides, digitalized and integrated transaction systems can
accurately provide information about MSMEs for the government.
With the existence of fintech and the application to support cashless
communities, the government can monitor digital money transac-
tions circulating in the community. The circulation of counterfeit
money, mainly from multi-level entrepreneurs, can be eradicated.
The absence of counterfeit money will certainly ensure the welfare
and security of the community in transactions. Figure 1 illustrated
the fintech policies best practice involved government to provide
laws and leadership to a spirit of becoming leading sector.
4.2 Issue and Recommendation of the Policies
in Fintech Sector
Fintech is extending because technological advances deliver options
for secure, speedy, and straightforward financial services. Shifts in
people’s behavior, such as limitations on going out and working
from home policies during a pandemic, drive all sectors to transform
digitally. Fintech targets were expanded to be underbanked, which
means they have limited access to financial services) and unbanked,
which have no access to financial services at all. The Indonesia
Stock Exchange reveals that the total population without access
to financial services is more than 75% of the total population of
Indonesia. [24].
The first issue is infrastructure [16]. Minister of Finance in the
3rd Indonesia Fintech Summit 2021 mentioned that Indonesia’s dig-
ital infrastructure investments are Rp. 7 trillion (USD 474 million)
in 2019, increasing to IDR 10 trillion (USD 678 million) in 2020
[25]. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, explained the obstacles to de-
veloping Indonesia’s digital economy in Jakarta’s 2018 High-Level
Conference Annual Meetings discussion. One of the obstacles for
Indonesia to reaching the potential of the digital economy is in-
frastructure. The uneven distribution of infrastructure and internet
networks in Indonesia is one of the crucial problems to overcome.
Of course, without adequate infrastructure and an internet network,
the discourse of a cashless society will also not materialize. People
will use physical money to transact if the infrastructure and internet
network do not support it. The potential for corruption and budget
transparency is not easy to suppress. In addition, the public does not
benefit from fintech or the digital economy. The disparity between

regions, especially the Indonesian West Region and the Eastern
Indonesia Region, is still a significant obstacle to infrastructure
development. The Director of Resources and Administration at the
Ministry of Communications and Information revealed that areas
outside Java are the most that the internet has not reached. At least
there are still 70 million Indonesians who have difficulty getting
internet access [26]. The need to keep up with the advancement
of infrastructure, especially 5G, is more imminent. Infrastructure
priority is equal distribution of internet access and narrowing the
gap in digital services throughout Indonesia.
The second issue is data safety [27]. Current financial-related
digital platforms have not implemented good personal data pro-
tection governance, which also shows the weakness of Indonesia’s
data protection system, which does not yet have commission and
criminal sanctions for data breaches. However, to address the issue,
the Financial Services Authority ensures that handling complaints
from cybercrime victims has been regulated in Regulation 6 of 2022
concerning Consumer Protection and the Financial Services Sector.
Data leak in August 2020 around 890,000 from the fintech service
provider. The National Cyber and Crypto Agency reported that
from January to August 2021, more than 888.7 million cyber-attacks
ensued in Indonesia. With fintech, this issue should not only have
been about awareness but also how to overcome and strengthen
security.
The third is financial literacy [28]. Knowledge of public financial
literacy is one of the essential factors in the development of the
digital economy. Financial literacy is the knowledge of planning
and manage personal or family finances. Financial literacy will
affect how people save, borrow, invest and manage finances. At
the national level, good financial literacy from the community will
positively impact the nation’s economic progress. According to the
Financial Services Authority (OJK), Indonesian people’s financial
literacy index in 2019 shows a number of 38.03% which means that
from every 100, there are about 38 people in the population who
are well literate. This result shows an increase from the previous
survey, namely 29.7% in 2016 and 21.8% in 2013. Although it shows
288
ICIBE 2022, September 27–29, 2022, Macau, China Wawan Dhewanto et al.
an increase, on the other hand this data shows that there are still
many Indonesian people who are not well literate. Referring to
the 2019 financial literacy index data it can be concluded that out
of every 100 residents, there are around 62 people who do not
have the right knowledge, beliefs, skills, attitudes, and behavior
about financial service institutions and products and services of
formal finance [29]. It is hoped that the improvement in the finan-
cial literacy and inclusion index of the Indonesian people can be
achieved through the 2021-2025 Indonesian Financial Literacy Na-
tional Strategy. Three strategic programs have been created, namely
Financial Capability, Wise Financial Attitudes and Behaviors, and
Financial Access. This program is expected to increase public fi-
nancial literacy conventionally and to improve people’s welfare
through financial inclusion, which is targeted at 90% [30]. Financial
and digital literacy must continue to be improved, supported by a
conducive ecosystem and cross-sectoral collaboration to maximize
the impact of various Government programs and initiatives.
The fourth issue is new genre of financial technology, sharia
fintech. The current statute governing fintech is Regulation from
Financial Service Authority about Information Technology-Based
Lending and Borrowing Services, which was issued at the end of
December 2016. However, the regulation only regulates fintech fi-
nancingwith a conventional system and does not regulate the sharia
system, which is also developing market. On the other hand, Bank
Indonesia has also established regulations for fintech operators
whose activities are related to the payment system. The reason is
that from several regulations issued both from the Financial Service
Authority and Bank Indonesia, there is still a lack of clarity between
the rules for conventional fintech and Islamic fintech. Therefore,
the government needs firmness to protect fintech in Indonesia with
one regulatory umbrella.
5 CONCLUSION
This research underscores the significant role of fintech and digital
technology in transforming the Indonesian economy. The devel-
opment of policies and regulations needs to continue to be carried
out to foster the extraordinary potential of digital technology as
well as fintech, but still maintain data security and the safety of the
public against things that are criminal and distorting. One of the
efforts to promote the ever-growing financial technology is to look
at its policies, player, key roles, and issues. Fintech is still newly
emerging in Indonesia and early stage of adoption. Meanwhile,
the technology itself is gaining attention from the emerging latest
technology and startups. This study is one of few studies in In-
donesia that discuss financial technology, entrepreneur ecosystem
and policy development. Due to fintech’s early stage in Indonesia,
most related research is only focused on technology or innovation,
mostly cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and artificial intelligence.
This study’s findings contribute to the framework of policies in
the entrepreneurial ecosystem of fintech. However, this research
focused on the entrepreneurial ecosystem’s financial technology
policy development. Further research to discover how the policy
development in the entrepreneurial framework developed could be
interesting. Future research with a quantitative approach related to
measuring the significance of whether a policy impacts society or
not should be conducted. Studies about how the new Bill solves the
ongoing issues could also be performed to pinpoint the effective
way of establishing financial technology. The implication for the
policymaker is that the financial technology ordinance should be
more vigorous and comprehensively recognized. The synergy is
also needed among the business owners and the policy maker to
bridge what can be developed and what kind of future is required
by the current fintech business.
