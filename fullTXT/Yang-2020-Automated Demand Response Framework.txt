Abstract—Blockchain technique, with the novelties of
decentralization, smart contract, security and cooperative auton-
omy, is expected to play great effects on promoting the devel-
opment of energy local networks (ELNs). This paper presents
an automated demand response (ADR) framework for decen-
tralized scheduling and secure peer-to-peer (P2P) trading among
energy storage systems in ELNs. Different from most existing
works that trade electricity over long distances and through
complex meshes, this proposed work performs decentralized and
automated demand response through energy sharing of P2P
executors. We explore for the first time the benefits of a promising
blockchain to conduct the overall ADR framework and increase
the P2P trading security. To achieve decentralized scheduling
without relying on a central entity, a price-incentive noncooper-
ative game theoretic model is introduced to produce equilibrium
solutions for energy storage systems. Moreover, we develop a
schedulable ability evaluation system to match trading pairs
involving buying and selling nodes. On this basis, a state-machine-
driven smart contract mechanism is built to realize P2P trading
without reliance on a trusted third party. To illustrate the imple-
mentation details of the ADR method, a distributed algorithm is
designed. Case studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

solution to meet the challenges of developing sustainable ener-
gies, flexible energy management, and secure system control
under the existing energy infrastructure [1], [2]. Energy local
networks (ELNs), served as typical subnets of energy Internet,
are small-scale and localized power systems. Generally, ELNs
are used to provide clean and renewable electricity by inte-
grating with various RESs, energy storages, and demand-side
resources [3].
Due to the characteristics of larger-quantities and wide-
distribution, the energy management of ELNs has become
an intriguing research topic that has attracted much attention
recently. Different from traditional power systems, the con-
notation of an ELN is to achieve better utilization of RESs
through efficiently managing multiple available energy sources
in an economic way [4]. Therein, management design of the
energy storage system (ESS), including stationary and mobile
battery [i.e., plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)] has received
more attention, from centralized options to decentralized
options.
Previous work on energy management in ELNs (e.g.,
microgrid, virtual power plant, and smart building) has primar-
ily focused on centralized optimizations [5]–[9]. These studies
have made great contributions to the development of theoret-
ical level for ELNs. However, several limitations still exist in
centralized framework which can be summarized as: difficult
to solve; easy to expose users’ privacy; low system reliability;
and failed to fit the plug-and-play nature of the ESSs.
Game theory is a natural manner to capture the compe-
tition and decentralized decision-making in smart grid field.
In ELNs field, Mediwaththe et al. [10] applied a nonco-
operative game method to develop decentralized dispatching
for ESS in a neighborhood network. Chen and Zhu [11]
proposed a resilient and fully distributed energy management
for microgrids using game theory, which greatly increases
system reliability. In [12], a two-stage game theoretical model
was designed to achieve distributed demand-side management
in a residential microgrid with renewables, where the ability
of demand transferring is improved. The proposed distributed
approach in [13] was based on the game and learning tech-
niques to manage hybrid energy systems that adapts to the
sudden changes in real time. A game-theoretic decentralized
scheme was presented in [14] for thermal appliances coordi-
nation control in smart buildings. Compared with centralized
options, these options can avoid single point failure and fit
well with the plug-and-play nature of the ESSs [15]. These
kinds of approaches are applicable to the local controllers with

restricted resources, and can increase the system reliability
by employing multiple decision-makers rather than a unique
centralized controller. However, energy trading among the stor-
age systems would become more complex as the increase
of players. Besides, they have failed to evaluate the schedu-
lable ability (SA) of players [10]–[14]. Without making a
reasonable analysis of SA for ESSs, the optimizations may
not be approved by the end-users, and the ESSs may not be
coordinated rationally and flexibly either.
Recently, automated demand response (ADR) is consid-
ered as a favorable technique to avoid above limitations, for
which the most notable feature is fully automated demand
response (DR), where the DR strategy is initiated by an
ADR on receipt of an external signal [16]. It can reduce the
operating costs of DR programs by increasing DR resource
reliability and reducing the amount of effort required from
end-users [17]. These features especially meet the control
requirements of ESSs in ELNs. The ADR controller was
applied in a home energy management system to coor-
dinate the operations of executors in response to pricing
signals [18]. In [19], an ADR system for PEVs usages
guiding was proposed to achieve supply demand coordi-
nated optimization in a distributed grid by integrating risk
aversion. To avoid the need for hard real-time global mes-
sages, an ADR-based task allocation algorithm was designed
in [20] for frequency control. Based on a two-level differ-
ential game framework, [21] focused on a price-sensitive
ADR method to guide the behaviors of controllable appli-
ances in smart buildings. Still, their limitations can be listed
as follows.
1) These kinds of methods adopt an autonomous manage-
ment measure for responsive executors (REs), which
lacks a trustworthy system to guarantee the fairness
and authenticity of the trading, and cannot avoid the
deceptive behaviors of certain dishonest users.
2) Trading rules are not well developed, and suitable
incentive mechanisms are still highly desired to pro-
mote collaboration among users. Therefore, a significant
research effort is still needed to develop an effective
ADR solution for ELNs.
To facilitate the construction of ADR models, blockchain
technique is a promising means for offsetting the limitations in
terms of energy trading due to its advantages of decentraliza-
tion, anonymity, and trust [22], [23]. Specifically, blockchain
is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in a
verifiable and permanent way.
Some existing works have exploited the applications of
blockchain technique in ELN energy management, automated
control, and energy trading. Kang et al. [24] defined a local-
ized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading model among the
PEVs, which shows the potential of blockchain for improv-
ing transactions security. As an extension, Li et al. [25]
further exploited energy blockchain technology to design a
unified and secure P2P energy trading system. In [26], a
blockchain with multisignatures was utilized to solve trad-
ing security problems in distributed smart grids. Furthermore,
Silvestre et al. [27] applied energy blockchain in ELNs for
making distributed decisions, where the focus is on the issue
of energy losses tracking and attribution during the energy
trading. Our previous work [4] has reported that blockchain
has high potential to establish decentralized ADR in the energy
field. Based on [4], this paper further exploits blockchain tech-
nique to ensure the efficient implementation of energy trading
and revenue division. In general, the blockchain is not a one-
size-fits-all solution, therefore detailed designs are needed to
be customized within the blockchain framework for handling
energy trading and technical operations and permitting smart
contracts in ELN scenarios [28]. In this situation, how to
incorporate the decentralized ADR program into blockchain
framework and how to design contracts to work well in P2P
energy trading still require extensive research.
In this paper, we exploit the game and blockchain techniques
to develop a decentralized ADR approach in ELNs toward the
ESSs, which consists of decentralized scheduling and smart
contract. To achieve this, a noncooperative game mechanism is
introduced into the blockchain framework with fully consider-
ing the features and SAs of various ESSs. Numerical analyses
and simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of
the proposed method. The main contributions of this paper
are listed as follows.
1) A decentralized ADR framework for ELNs is intro-
duced to coordinate the actions and maintain the supply
demand balance, where the PEVs load shifting, vehicle-
to-grid (V2G) support, and stationary ESS are taken into
consideration.
2) A price-sensitive game-theoretic model is established
to coordinate the consumption behaviors of REs with-
out relying on any centralized controller based on the
developed pricing scheme, where a novel inconvenience
cost model is included.
3) This paper defines the abilities of REs for managing the
imbalance power in the ELN as SA, and a comprehen-
sive evaluation system of SA is also established using
fuzzy logic.
4) Coupling with the SA values of REs, a smart con-
tract mechanism is designed to achieve trustful and
secure P2P electricity trading with blockchain tech-
nique. Moreover, the implementation procedure is also
illustrated.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the ADR framework for the ELNs. In
Section III, the system model is formulated. Furthermore,
the game-theoretic decentralized scheduling is presented in
Section IV. Section V proposes the blockchain-based smart
contract in details. Case studies and numerical analysis are
presented in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this
paper.
II. FRAMEWORK
A. General Structure of the ELN System
We consider an ELN integrated with renewable sources and
a charging station for investigation, as shown in Fig. 1(a).
Therein, the power supply side consists of PV, WT sources, a
battery energy storage (BES) and a bi-directional connection
to the main grid, and the demand-side includes the end-users

(conventional load demander) and a PEV cluster. In an ELN,
the primary target is to maximize the utilization of its renew-
ables [29]. Thus, it is assumed that the ESSs, including PEVs
and stationary BES, are employed to compensate for the mis-
match power while minimizing the operational cost of the
ELN. We incorporate the role of ESSs into the ADR programs
of ELNs to regulate and adjust their charging/discharging
behaviors for balancing supply demand with game theory and
blockchain techniques.
Remark 1: Note that the REs are considered to be the con-
trol objects of the proposed method, which consist of multiple
PEVs and a BES. For convenience, we simply refer to “REs”
meaning “multiple PEVs and a BES” throughout this paper.
B. Requirements Analysis
In this paper, we focus on the ADR problem in ELNs. A
reasonable and well-designed ADR scheme should be able to
manage the way of energy generation, storage, and consump-
tion inside the ELNs while fully considering the characteristics
of the REs. Before designing our approach, the analysis of the
main requirements of the ELN is necessary [4], [30]–[32].
1) With the development of renewable energy technologies,
RESs capacity is increasing in ELN scenarios. In addi-
tion, load type of demand side is diversified. Numerous
demand-side resources, including PEVs will directly
participate in the management and control schemes,
which greatly increase the operational complexity of the
ELNs. Thus, a promising manner to overcome the limi-
tations of inefficient management and solve the difficulty
is to transform the system scheduling from centralization
to decentralization.
2) In order to promote the active participation and fair com-
petition for each RE on both the supply and demand
sides, it is necessary to formulate competitive and trans-
parent power transaction rules. Meanwhile, a safe and
efficient market-based P2P energy sharing platform is
needed to be established to protect the privacy and to
ensure the security of the electricity trading in the ELN
system.
3) Implementing ADR method in the ELN system requires
intelligent scheduling and efficient execution, while pro-
tecting the privacy of the users in P2P network should
also be considered. To achieve this, it is necessary to
employ the novel measures with intelligentization and
contract.
C. Decision-Making Process
Considering the system structure and those above-
mentioned requirements, the decison-making process of ADR
framework for the ESSs is outlined, as depicted in Fig. 1.
1) Decentralized Scheduling: We propose the use of non-
cooperative game theory to achieve decentralized scheduling
of multiple REs in the ELN system. For each game player, it
needs to make decision on how to achieve the optimal objec-
tive under limited resources, while considering the information
interaction and the iterative updates of the strategies.
2) Smart Contract: We explore a promising blockchain
technique to achieve trustful and secure P2P electricity trad-
ing among the RE holders. To determine the trading-pairs and
the amount of traded energy among them, a novel multifactor-
based SA is defined and evaluated for the executors. After that,
localized P2P trading among the ESSs can be triggered and
executed automatically to realize the ADR program according
to the designed reliable smart contract mechanism.
Based on these considerations, the proposed ADR scheme
will be introduced in details in the following.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Basic Model
In this paper, we consider a discrete-time system where the
scheduling horizon is divided into K equal periods with a con-
stant interval of �t. Let K = {1, 2, . . . , K} denote the set of
operational periods.
1) PEV Model: Let N denote the set of PEVs in the ELN
where its scale is n = |N |. For any PEV l in N , the relevant
parameters are expressed as
Xl =
[
T in

l , uCmax
l , uDmax

]
(1)
where T in

departure time of PEV l, respectively; Sini
l and SE
l repre-
sent the initial state of charge (SoC) and the expected SoC,
respectively; Cmax
l represents the battery capacity of PEV l;
and uCmax
l and uDmax
l represent the rated charging/discharging
power of PEV l, respectively.

The discrete state space model is used to represent the PEV
model, of which the general expression is as follows [33]:
∑
V
:
{
Sl,k+1 = A · Sl,k + B · Il,k
ul,k = C · Sl,k + D · Il,k
(2)
where Sl,k+1 and Sl,k are the SoC levels of PEV l at peri-
ods k + 1 and k, respectively; B and D represent the input
matrices; A and C represent the system matrix and the feed-
forward matrix, respectively; ul,k represents the output of PEV
l at period k; and Il,k represents the input states, which is
defined as
Il,k =
[
PPV
k , PWT
k , LB
k , uc
l,k, ud
l,k

(3)
where PPV
k and PWT
k represent the active power of PV and WT
sources at period k, respectively; LB
k is the conventional load
demand except the load of the PEVs at period k; and uc
l,k and
ud
l,k are the charging/discharging power of PEV l at period k,
respectively. Regarding the proposed PEV model, we set
A = 1, C = 0 (4)
B =
[
0, 0, 0,

Cmax
l
,− �t
Cmax
l ηd
]
(5)
D = [0, 0, 0, 1, −1] (6)
where ηc and ηd represent the charging/discharging efficien-
cies of PEVs, respectively.
In addition, each candidate solution of PEVs should satisfy
the following constraints:
{
0 ≤ uc
l,k ≤ φc
l,k · uCmax

l,k ≤ φd
l,k · uDmax

where φc
l,k and φd
l,k are the charging/discharging binary indi-
cators of PEV l at period k, respectively and Smin,PEV and
Smax,PEV represent the lower and the upper SoC limits of the
PEV battery, respectively.
2) BES Model: The BES can be modeled as a discrete-time
differentiator with input IB
k = [PPV
k , PWT
k , LB
k , uB,c
k , uB,d
k ]T and
with state SB
k representing its normalized SoC level. Its SoC
dynamics are described by the following form:

(11)
where uB,c
k and uB,d
k are the charging/discharging power of
the BES at period k, respectively; QB is the battery capacity;
ηB,c and ηB,d are the charging/discharging efficiencies of the
BES, respectively; and uB
k is the output of the BES at period
k. Different from the PEV battery, the BES should have same
SoC at the beginning and the end of the scheduling horizon
for meeting the charge–discharge cycle [34], [35], that is
∑
k∈K

uB,c

)
�t = 0. (12)
3) RES Model: These sources, i.e., PV and WT systems,
are nondispatchable. The maximum power point tracking
method is used to make them operate at the maximum power
point.
4) Main Grid Supply Model: Let gInt
k be the power
exchanged with main grid at period k, which should satisfy
gInt+
k ≤ �1ρ
Int
k
gInt−
k ≤ �2
(
1 − ρInt
k
)
(13)
where gInt+
k and gInt−
k represent the power that drawn from
and injected back to the main grid, respectively; ρInt
k is a
binary variable, 1 if grid is supplying power during period
k, 0 else; and �1 and �2 are both positive values that impose
the limitations on gInt+
k and gInt−
k , respectively.
5) Power Balancing Model: During the ELN operation, the
overall energy supply in supply side must be equal to the
total load demands in demand-side at every period. Thus,
the following supply demand balance relation is obtained:
PPV
k + PWT
k + gInt
k + uB,d
k +
∑
l∈N ud
l,k
= LB
k + uB,c
k +
∑
l∈N uc
l,k, ∀k. (14)
Remark 2: For convenience, in this paper, we let N denote
the set of REs in the ELN, of which the REs are indexed by
i such that 0 < i ≤ N, where N = |N | = n + 1 represents
the number of REs. Similarly, combining (2) and (11), let ui,k
denote the power consumption of RE i at period k. In every
interval �t, there is
∑
i∈N ui,k =∑l∈N ul,k + uB
k .
On this basis, for ∀i ∈ N , we define mi,k to represent its
energy required at current period k, which can be expressed as
mi,k = (SE
i − Si,k
)
Cmax
i , ∀i ∈ N (15)
where SE
i represents the expected SoC of RE i; Si,k represents
the SoC level of RE i at period k; and Cmax
i represents the
battery capacity of RE i. Note that this equation can also apply
to the BES. Specifically, for the BES, SE
i is equivalent to its
initial SoC according to (12).
B. Internal Pricing Model
In order to coordinate various ESSs (include the PEVs and a
BES) to achieve cost savings and internal supply demand bal-
ance maintenance simultaneously in the ELN system, in this
section, we focus on developing an internal pricing scheme
based on the relationship between power supply and load
demand inside the ELN system. Specifically, as BES owner
and PEV users are mutually beneficial parties, the mismatch
power between supply and demand is the foundation to decide
internal prices, which can be co-decided by all the REs, RESs
outputs, and general load demand [34].
Following our previous work [7], the real-time pricing based
on the generalized net load of the ELN is given as follows:
γ RTP
k = ϕ1 + ϕ2La
k, ∀k (16)
ϕα = prR,α
φR,α
, α = 1, 2 (17)
where γ RTP
k represents the internal real-time electricity price
at period k within the ELN system; ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the price

adjustment coefficients; prR,α and φR,α represent the reference
price and reference load demand values, respectively; and La
k
represents the general net load of the ELN system at period
k, shown as
La
k = LB
k +
∑
l∈N ul,k + uB
k − (PPV
k + PWT
k
)
, ∀k. (18)
The advantages of the proposed pricing rules can be sum-
marized as follows.
1) It is flexible, since the dynamic updates are included to
real-reflect the relationship of the power supply and load
demand within the ELN.
2) It is able to reduce the daily operational cost and main-
tain the internal supply demand balance simultaneously.
C. Cost Model of Responsive Executor
Given the designed internal price γ RTP
k , the cost function of
any individual RE i is composed of two parts.
1) Monetary cost, which is caused by purchasing and
selling electricity, denoted as C1
i,k. Within each time
interval �t, player i performs a noncooperative game to
minimize its cost. According to the developed internal
pricing scheme, the monetary cost of RE i at period k
is calculated as
C1
i,k = ui,kγ
RTP
k �t, ∀i ∈ N . (19)
2) Inconvenience cost, which is used to quantify the dis-
satisfaction level of the REs, denoted as C2
i,k.
Remark 3: In general, C2
i,k should be a continuously
decreasing function with respect to ui,k�t. As the main
duty of a PEV user is to charge his/her PEV, thus, three
basic properties should be considered when formulating this
function.
1) If the charging/discharging amount is positive, the incon-
venience cost should be negative, meaning that the
participant satisfaction is positive.
2) If the charging/discharging amount is negative, that is,
the participant discharges, meaning the inconvenience
cost is positive.
3) If a participant does not charge or discharge, its incon-
venience cost should be zero, i.e., C2
i,k|ui,k=0 = 0 [36].
Also, as the amount of energy consumption continues to
increase, the negative function value decreases slower and
will tend to be stable (the satisfaction level of an RE cannot
infinitely increase).
To meet these above-mentioned properties, we define a
novel inconvenience cost function for each participant i ∈ N
with respect to its power consumption, as follows:
C2
i,k = 1
2ρ
z2
i,k − zi,k (20)
zi,k = wiui,k�t
mi,k
(21)
where ui,k�t represents the actual electricity consumption at
period k; wi represents the priority value of RE i, which will
be introduced in Section V-B in detail; and ρ represents the
influencing factor of the quadratic term such that ρ > 0.
In summary, the cost model of any individual RE i can be
expressed as
Ci =
∑
k∈K
(
C1
i,k + C2
i,k
)
=
∑
k∈K
(

i u2
i,k�t2
2ρm2
i,k
− wiui,k�t
mi,k
+ λui,kγ

)
(22)
where λ is a non-negative weight factor to show the importance
of economics when considering both dissatisfaction cost and
economy simultaneously.
IV. GAME-THEORETIC DECENTRALIZED SCHEDULING
A. Formulation of ADR Game
In order to realize the decentralized ADR for ESSs in the
ELN system, each decision-maker needs to select a reasonable
and optimal consumption plan from its strategy set according
to available information. Therefore, a noncooperative game is
modeled to study how each game participant formulates its
own collaboration strategy to achieve the overall game goal,
in which each component can be described as follows.
1) Players: Game players include all the users of PEVs and
the BES in set N within the ELN system, where it is assumed
that each player only owns a single PEV or a stationary BES.
2) Strategy Space: A strategy space means a set of feasible
consumption plans that minimize the utility function of the
players. For each player i (∀i ∈ N ), its strategy space can
be expressed as �i = {ui| Constraints (2)−(14)}, where ui
represents a candidate consumption scheduling plan.
3) Utility Function: It is used to measure the cost of the
players in the game. With the previous formulation of cost
model in Section III-C, the utility function of player i (∀i ∈ N )
under strategy set [u1, u2, . . . , u|N |−1, u|N |] is defined as
Ui(ui, u−i) � Ci (23)
where u−i = [u1, u2, . . . , ui−1, ui+1, . . . , u|N |] represents the
consumption plan set of all players except player i’s one.
Based on the previous modeling, a noncooperative ADR
game among the REs is built as follows:
GADR = {N , {�i}i∈N , {Ui}i∈N
}
. (24)
Remark 4: The relationship between electricity consump-
tion ui,k ∀i ∈ N and internal price γ RTP
k is interdependent and
interactive. Besides, as an intermediary, the internal price is
considered as an integrated variable to reflect supply demand
relationship in utility function (23). Thus, the formulated ADR
game is sensitive to both strategy ui,k and internal price γ RTP
k .
B. Equilibrium Solution
In the formulated game model, each player i receives the
updated information from both supply and demand sides,

Therefore, every player i ∈ N solves the local programming

its utility function assuming all other remaining players have
selected the optimal strategies, namely,
u∗
i = arg min
ui∈�i
Ui(ui, u−i). (25)
It is noteworthy that the final optimal strategy is derived
through an iterative convergence process. In each iteration,
every player i solves the optimization problem in (25) to obtain
his/her current optimal strategy. The players will update their
own scheduling strategies to a new strategy unew
i ∈ �i if the
new strategy helps to decrease their own costs [37]. Such a
procedure will be repeated until the game converges to the
Nash equilibrium (NE) solution.
Definition 1: A strategy u∗ = (u∗
i , u∗−i) is an NE solution
if and only if the following holds:
Ui
(
u∗
i , u∗−i
)
� Ui
(
ui, u∗−i
)
, ∀ui ∈ �i, ∀i ∈ N (26)
then u∗ = [u∗
1, u∗
2, . . . , u∗
N−1
, u∗
N ] is called the NE of the
game model.
C. Performance Analysis of ADR Game
Theorem 1: For the proposed decentralized ADR game,
there exists a unique NE solution if the following conditions
are satisfied.
1) The strategy space of each player i ∈ �i is nonempty,
convex, and compact.
2) The cost function [i.e., see (23)] is continuous and quasi-
convex on �i ∀i ∈ N .
Proof: 1) Since the strategy space �i is bounded by a finite
set of linear equalities [i.e., (9) and (14)] and convex con-
straints [i.e., (7) and (11)], so the strategy space is readily
approved as nonempty, convex, and compact [38].
2) Due to the utility function Ui ∀i ∈ N is a function of
several variables, to prove condition 2), we need to check
the Hessian matrix of Ui with respect to the strategy �i
[38, Sec. 3.1]. Then, its Hessian matrix can be expressed as
HUi =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
∂2Ui
∂u2

∂2Ui
∂u1∂u2
. . . ∂2Ui
∂u1∂uN

⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
(27)
where
∂2Ui
∂ux∂uy
=
{
w2
i �t2
ρm2
i,k
+ 2λϕ2 > 0, y = x
0, y �= x
(28)
where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ N.
For convenience, let hxy denote the element
[∂2Ui/(∂ux∂uy)], so we have HUi = (hxy)1≤x,y≤N . Its
ν-order leading principal minor can be expressed as
det HUi(ν) =
∣∣∣∣∣∣∣
h11 . . . h1ν
...
...
hν1 . . . hνν
∣∣∣∣∣∣∣
, ν = 1, 2, . . . , N. (29)
It can be seen from (29) that all diagonal elements of
matrix HUi are positive, while the other nondiagonal elements
are 0. That is, det HUi(ν) > 0, ∀ν = 1, 2, . . . , N. Therefore,
the Hessian matrix HUi is a strictly positive-definite matrix,
which means that the utility function is strictly convex. This
implies that the cost function Ui is continuous, and strictly
convex in �i because the Hessian matrix HUi , ∀i ∈ N
is constant for the given distribution and satisfaction of
condition 1) [38, pp. 67–104]. Therefore, the existence and
uniqueness of the NE solution for the game GADR is proved
due to the satisfaction of conditions 1) and 2) [38].
Lemma 1: The unique NE solution of the ADR game is
identical with the Pareto-optimal solution.

problem in ELNs is formulated as an overall cost minimization
model, given as follows:

(33)
Note that (33) satisfies for any RE i ∈ N , following
Definition 1, we can conclude that the optimal solution of the
centralized scheduling problem (30) constitutes an NE solu-
tion of the game GADR. Based on Theorem 1, we can further
obtain that [u†

Pareto optimality is an ideal state of resource allocation,
meaning that it is not possible to make the interests of at
least one player better without worsening the situation of any
player [39]. Let [u	
1, u

N−1

N ] be the NE solution
after a nonempty set of players � ∈ N change their strategies.
For ∀i ∈ �, there is

As u∗ is equivalent to the optimal solution of central-
ized scheduling problem (30), according to (34), we have
[(U∗
i − U	
i )/εi] ≤ 0, that is, U∗
i ≤ U	
i . Therefore, we can
conclude that any player ∀i ∈ � cannot benefit from chang-
ing its strategy, thereby demonstrating that the Pareto-optimal
solution and the NE solution are identical, which completes
the proof.
V. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SMART CONTRACT
A. Blockchain and Technique Feasibility
Blockchain is an emerging P2P technique for decentral-
ized data sharing among network nodes [24], which has the
potential to become an important architectural paradigm for
future electricity trading. In general, it has four main advan-
tages: 1) decentralization; 2) de-trust; 3) traceability; and
4) smart contract. An excellent overview of the features for
the blockchain technique can be found in [4] and [40]. In this
paper, combined with game theory, blockchain is introduced
to achieve distributed management and autonomous supply
demand balance in ELNs.
The specific components of the block in our formulated
blockchain are shown in Fig. 2. As depicted, each block can
be divided into two parts: 1) a block header and 2) a block
body. The block body records all transaction information in the
preceding period. The block header records version number,
the parent block hash, the Merkle root, the timestamp, the
required compensation power, etc. Accordingly, most of the
functions of blockchain are implemented by block headers.
The new block is formed at every �t, the formation process
of which is summarized as follows.
1) Transaction information in local memory is transferred
to the block body.
Fig. 2. Architecture of the block.
2) Then, a Merkle tree of all transaction information is
formed in the block body, of which the root value is
saved to the block header.
3) Using the SHA-256 algorithm, the block header data
of the previous block is generated and recorded into a
parent hash value of the current block.
4) Add the current time to the timestamp.
5) Finally, adjust the difficulty value according to the total
amount of the network so as to control the generation
time of the next block.
Next, we exhibit three aspects as follows, which show that
the blockchain technique is feasible to the ADR requirements
of the ELN system.
1) Decentralization: Blockchain technique supports to con-
ducting a decentralized and secure ADR framework without
relying on a trusted third party. The equivalence and decen-
tralization thinking of blockchain will help the REs make their
optimal decisions independently, which could also improve the
self-utilization of RESs in ELNs effectively.
2) Marketization: The advantage of blockchain in mar-
ket transaction can facilitate the demand-side to participate
in the transaction and interaction of energy system manage-
ment. Also, the transparency and credibility of information
are conducive to maintaining the supply demand balance and
help to establish an energy sharing-based P2P trading market
mechanism in ADR programs.
3) Intelligence and Contract: Which are two salient fea-
tures of blockchain technique. Based on this, various system
functions can be packaged in a decentralized blockchain for
automatic execution. The decision-making and trading behav-
iors in ADR programs have a trend of intelligent development.
Therefore, the blockchain-based smart contract can guide the
trading behaviors of the energy systems, which helps to ensure
the fairness and efficiency of the energy trading and revenue
division to meet the need of intelligent and reliable scheduling.
B. Concept and Evaluation of SA
Definition 2: The concept of SA is defined to represent the
ability of dynamic and bi-directional energy balance for the
REs in an ELN based on V2G technology [34].

YANG et al.: ADR FRAMEWORK IN ELNs: DECENTRALIZED SCHEDULING AND SMART CONTRACT 65
From the perspective of the current and historical
information, multifactors, i.e., battery loss, credit degree, and
reverse power supply capability, are used to make a com-
prehensive evaluation about the SA for each RE. The initial
decision matrix is expressed as B = (bij)N×m, i ≤ N, j ≤ m,
where bij represents the jth evaluation index of ith RE; m rep-
resents the number of the evaluation indices. The evaluation
indices are calculated as follows.
Battery loss bi1, which is related to factors, such as tem-
perature, depth of discharge, charging–discharging cycles, and
initial SoC level of executors. Following [41], the battery loss
of RE i can be described as follows:
bi1 = −χ refεTem
i τS0,i�DOD,iY
cyc
i (35)
where χ ref represents a referenced coefficient; εTem
i , τS0,i ,
and �DOD,i are the accelerating factors of the environmen-
tal temperature, the initial SoC S0,i, and the depth of the
discharge DODi, respectively; and Ycyc
i is the number of
charging-discharging cycles of RE i.
Credit Degree bi2: It is a measure of how well an RE
behaves when participating in ADR programs according to
the history scheduling data
bi2 = 1
H
H∑
h=1

(36)
where H represents the number of times of the RE i partic-
ipates in the scheduling in a certain time horizon; Toff
h,i and
T in
h,i represent the planned departure time and connection time
of RE i in hth scheduling, respectively; and Td
h,i is the actual
departure time in hth scheduling. Owing to the always on-site
nature of BES in the ELN, its credit degree is set as 1.
Reverse Power Supply Capability bi3: The reverse power
supply capability of the REs can increase the standby capacity
of the system and improve the stability of the grid operation,
shown as
bi3 = 1

where Sini
h,i represents the initial SoC level of the RE i in the

From (35)–(37), we know that the above indicators have
different dimensions and value ranges. To address this, a linear
extreme method-based dimensionless is introduced, which is
shown as
di,j,a = 1 − |bij − b∗
j |
max1≤i≤N,1≤j≤m
{
|bij − b∗

} (38)
where di,j,a is the jth dimensionless index of RE i; b∗
j is the
optimal value of the jth index, for the positive (negative) index,
and b∗
j represents the maximum (minimum) value of the jth
index.
With these dimensionless indices, to evaluate the schedul-
ing ability of the REs, we employ fuzzy logic algorithm,
which is mainly composed of fuzzification, fuzzy reasoning,
and de-clarification [42], to integrate the three indices com-
prehensively. In this paper, a three-input–single-output model

Fig. 4. Schematic illustration of the formulated node network.
is adopted, where the inputs are three evaluation indices and
the output is the integrated SA value wi.
Using the fuzzy rule observation window, the relationship
between output and inputs at a certain period can be under-
stood in great detail. From Fig. 3, we can see that the indices
of reverse power supply capacity and credit degree of the REs
are positive indices, with the increase of which the priority of
REs participation scheduling will increase, while the battery
loss is a negative index.
C. Smart Contract
Node Network and Work Logics: In this paper, a blockchain
technique is employed to formulate the ADR framework in
ELNs. Since the blockchain is attached to the nodes, to use
the blockchain technique, one of the prerequisites is to build
the node network. Thus, the various information can be stored,
transmitted, and validated with the distributed node network
instead of using a central entity [27]. The way of blockchain-
based information transmission and storage can make it more
secure and reliable for the game strategies calculated by the
nodes to spread to all nodes in the network. Specifically, we
regard the PEVs, a BES, and the power storage calculation
unit as the nodes in the ADR model, which can be structured
into a node network, as shown in Fig. 4.
Combined with the game theory, we propose the following
rules for the work logics.
1) When a new RE enters the ELN system, a new node will
be formed, denoted as vi (i = 1, 2, . . . , |N |), which is
capable of computing and generating its own private and
public keys with its own IP address.

66 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020
2) After step 1) is done, the new RE uploads its own
basic parameters [4] to the information database, and
broadcasts them to the whole network with the pub-
lic key. Meanwhile, the block-data and the information
database are downloaded from the other nodes in the
node network [40].
3) Build a new empty block every �t period.
4) The required compensation power of the ELN system
is calculated and saved every �t period by the shortage
calculation unit, then broadcasted to the entire network.
5) After receiving the compensation demand, each node
corresponding to each RE adopts the optimal strategy
ui to cope with the limited resources. Then, the strategy
ui is uploaded for sharing and verifying by the entire
node network.
6) After receiving the strategy information from the node
network, each node further calculates and updates
its consumption strategy according to the known
information using noncooperative game, and then
uploads to the node network.
7) The interactions of the strategy ui of different nodes
lead to the different Ui, resulting in the adjustment of
the charging/discharging plan of nodes.
8) During the game, the behaviors of the players gradually
become balanced, reaching a stable NE, in which each
node and the entire node network achieve consensus
with minimum cost.
The above is then followed by the P2P trading among the
nodes based on the detailed smart contract mechanism.
Smart Contract: The smart contract is the core compo-
nent of the blockchain. It is the decentralized, de-trusted
program code that runs on the distributed ledgers and is
automatically executed by the computers. A computer lan-
guage is used instead of a paper contract to specify the
rules that the exchange follows and is automatically executed
when satisfying the prespecified conditions. In this part, we
present an intelligent management contract, which is a kind
of smart contract, mainly, including two parts: 1) the manage-
ment of energy storage lease fee and 2) the management of
compensation fee.
Based on the decentralized blockchain and noncooperative
game theory techniques, all REs can determine their consump-
tion strategies after the game is completed. Before signing an
intelligent management contract, the trading-pairs of the con-
tract must be determined first. To achieve this, a novel priority
value-based confirmation method is introduced to facilitate the
P2P electricity trading among the REs, which is depicted in
Fig. 5.
The operation details of the P2P trading rules are designed
as follows.
1) Choosing Different Roles: During the electricity trading,
REs are divided into two groups, i.e., charging nodes
and discharging nodes, according to their consump-
tion strategies and current system status (the balanced
nodes that do not participate in the collaboration are not
considered).
2) Trading-Pairs Matching: The two groups of nodes are
both sorted based on the priority values. The basic
Fig. 5. Comparison list of charging/discharging nodes.
Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of state machine-driven smart contract mechanism.
trading-pair matching rule is that the charging node with
higher priority declares to trade with the discharging
node with higher priority. As shown in Fig. 5, the charg-
ing and discharging nodes with highest priority values
are located on the positive axis (starting point), which
decreases with the counterclockwise direction.
3) Selling and Buying: The trading amount between the
selling and buying nodes is proportional to the sector-
angle. Therefore, the trading-pairs and trading amount
of electricity are matched according to its position in the
comparison list.
The state machine is adopted to trigger the execution of
the smart contract once the trading-pairs are determined. The
diagram of the state machine-driven smart contract is depicted
in Fig. 6.
After determining the contract-parties, the smart contract
will be signed and recorded in the block after verification,
followed by its execution process. The energy storage lease is
equivalent to the transfer of the right to use the storage battery.
Therefore, after the transaction is over, the lessee will pay
the leaser a certain energy storage lease fee. In addition, the
number of charging/discharging conversions of both traders is
monitored during the smart management contract. Taking the
lesser as an example, if the number of its charging/discharging
conversions exceeds the specified threshold over a certain time
horizon in the contract, the ADR program manager needs to
compensate for its battery lifetime reduction cost, and transfer
it to the lesser along with the energy storage lease fee. This
is an active compensation measure to encourage end-users to
participate in the ADR programs [43], [44].

resents the ideal charging/discharging cost of RE i at period k
without considering the charging/discharging losses.
The cost of battery lifetime reduction, denoted by Cbat,i, is
composed of two components [45], [46], shown as
Cbat,i = CD
bat,i + CF
bat,i, ∀i ∈ N (40)
where CD
bat,i represents the battery degradation cost caused by
discharging and CF
bat,i represents the cost of battery loss caused
by fluctuations in charging/discharging power.
All the transaction data at the current period is uploaded to a
new block and being validated by all nodes. After verification,
this new block is added to the blockchain for all nodes to
access the data.
D. Implementation Algorithm
Following the details discussed above, the scheduling plans
of REs will be determined using the designed ADR method in
a decentralized manner based on the blockchain technology.
To be specific, the detailed procedures for the implementation
of the proposed method are summarized in Algorithm 1.

VI. CASE STUDIES
A. Cases Description and Simulation Results Analysis
For numerical experiments, an office area ELN system is
taken as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed ADR method. The installed capacities of WT and
PV generators in this ELN are 50 kW and 60 kW, respec-
tively, and the number of PEVs (with V2G option) available
for scheduling is 12. The initial SoC of BES is set as 0.45,
while each PEV has an initial SoC which varies from 0.40
to 0.60. The connection time for the PEVs is between 6:30
and 8:30 with the expected departure time between 20:00 and
22:30. Typically, the outputs of the WT and PV sources as
well as the basic load within a day are illustrated in Fig. 7.
The rest parameters needed for the experiments are as shown
in Table I.

TABLE I
PARAMETERS SETTING
All the simulations are conducted using a CPLEX solver
under MATLAB 2013b and YALMIP environment in a com-
puter with a Intel Core i7 CPU@2.9 GHz and a 4-GB
memory.
The power compensation results are presented in Fig. 8.
The trends of electricity price and the net load in the ELN are
depicted in Fig. 9. To show the SoC changes of each RE in
a day, we have drawn this three-dimensional thermodynamic
map in Fig. 10. From these results, the following conclusions
can be drawn.
1) The proposed ADR method can effectively coordinate
the work of ESSs to facilitate the utilization of RESs
while the PEVs still can be charged to the desired SoC to
complete the charging plans before their expected depar-
ture time. Meanwhile, the SoC levels of PEVs and BES
are always controlled within their limit range.
2) When the required compensation power of the ELN is
positive, the SoC of the ESSs rises with time; while
the required compensation power is negative, the SoC
decreases with time, which verifies the effectiveness of
the ADR method toward the ESSs.
3) The proposed ADR method enhances the responsive
potential of storage resources, and it can be inferred that
the resilience of the ELN system is strengthened to cope
with unforeseen attacks and risks.
B. Behaviors Analysis of REs
1) Analysis of SA and Response Behavior: We select two
typical PEVs for comparison in Fig. 11, where the rela-
tionship between the priority value and responsive power
is demonstrated. Comparing the specific response power of
Fig. 11. Comparisons between the scheduling priority and the actual response
power of a certain two PEVs.
PEV2 and PEV3 during the accessing periods, the correspon-
dence between the priority value and the power change is
obvious in the two periods of 7:00–10:00 and 15:00–20:00.
When the priority values of the two periods of 10:00–14:00
and 19:00–21:00 are close, the power curves of the two PEVs
are substantially parallel. After 21:00, since the departure time
of PEV3 is earlier, its priority value is significantly larger than
PEV2, resulting in a rapid decline in its power curve. It can
be seen that the response power trend is basically consistent
with the priority value during the accessing period of the two
PEVs. It can be observed from the above results that we use
the concept of SA to reflect the various attributes of the REs
can make the response power of each executor more reason-
able and better meet the needs of dynamic scheduling of the
system.
2) Influence of Weight Factor λ on the Results: To quantify
the importance of monetary cost in the utility function, we
introduce the weight factor λ to the utility function for the
game players. In this part, we analyze the influence of various
λ on energy interaction and cost. The related results are given
in Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 12, λ has a small influence on
the total cost and the load transfer amount in the range of
0.1–100. When λ < 3, the total cost decreases slightly with
the increase of λ, while the amount of load transfer increases
slightly. When λ ≥ 3, the total cost and the amount of load
transfer tend to remain the same. Meanwhile, the interaction
between the ELN and the main grid becomes smaller as the
λ increases. It means that the ELN is less dependent on the
main grid, and the loss caused by the interaction and the cost
of the interactive tie-line and equipment can be reduced under
this circumstance. The total inconvenience cost is basically
unchanged when λ < 3, and it will gradually increase with λ
when λ ≥ 3. In summary, the weight factor λ is most suitable
at around 3, where there exists a balance between the monetary
cost and the inconvenience cost.
3) Influence of Mobile Storage: We further study the influ-
ence of changes in the number and initial SoC value of PEVs
on the self-utilization of RESs and total cost. The simulation
results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14.
As shown in Fig. 13, in the case of a large PEV scale, the
low initial SoC of PEVs will lead to low utilization rate of the

RESs. It can be noticed that the PEV scale has a significant
impact on the RESs utilization rate. The reason for this fact
lies in that the time for large-scale PEVs accessing and leaving
the ELN is relatively dense, and it is prone to reverse peaking,
thus resulting in lower RESs utilization. However, from the
perspective of total cost, as shown in Fig. 14, the total cost
decreases with the electricity required by the PEVs. Therefore,
we can conclude that when the PEV scale is large and the PEV
charging demand is high, the adopted system will realize better
economic performance.
C. Trading Records in the Form of MERKLE Tree
An example of smart contract in a specific application case
is given in this part. After the game completes at 21:00, the
calculation results concerning the consumption power of each
node are shown in Table II. According to the smart contract
operation rules described in Section V-C, the transactions,
including the contract-pairs and trading amount, are recorded
in the form of Merkle tree, as shown in Fig. 15.
We illustrate the security of transactions with an example
that someone tries to modify the transaction information, of
which the modification is shown in the red text in Fig. 15.
When the transaction information changes, its associated hash
value changes, leading to the change of the root node of the
Merkle tree. Simply verify the data of the root node and it
can be easily known if the transaction information has been
tampered with. Similarly, comparing the modified Merkle tree
and the original Merkle tree from the root node, the falsified

transaction information can be quickly found. This fact demon-
strates that the proposed method can significantly improve the
security and reliability of the energy trading.
During the ADR implementation process, each node can
automatically realize the energy transfer without the participa-
tion of a third party. As a program stored on the blockchain,
smart contract can be triggered and executed automatically
according to prespecified conditions, which can not only
improve transaction security and privacy protection but also
effectively achieve economic benefits for both the ELN and
the REs.
D. Case Studies
To further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADR
method, a comparative study is presented considering the four
cases in the following (the proposed method is defined as
Case I). Case II: Game-theory-based distributed scheme [47].
Each individual RE determines its strategy based on a price-
driven model under a noncooperative game framework, where
the developed pricing rule is used for the purpose of facilitat-
ing the comparisons. Case III: Centralized real-time control

scheme [48]. Control actions of the REs are determined
only based on the difference between power supply and load
demand at every current period. Case IV: Uncoordinated con-
trol scheme (a reference scheme). All the REs are operated in
their inherent way without optimization scheduling.
The comparison results of the total load demands and net
load demands under the four cases are illustrated in Fig. 16.
Moreover, system performances of the ELN in different cases
are presented in Table III.
Referring to Fig. 16 and Table III, the load curves of
Cases I and II are more stable than those of Cases III and IV,
and the peak-to-valley difference of the net load is greatly
improved. Where, compared with Cases III and IV, the
RESs self-consumption rate of Case I is increased by 0.96%
and 14.58%, respectively; the RESs self-consumption rate of
Case II is increased by 1.28% and 14.9%, respectively. In
addition, the net load fluctuations of Cases I–III are reduced
by 99.14%, 99.25%, and 81.37%, respectively, compared with
Case IV. It is worth noting that the computational time of
Case I is only about 20% of Case II, showing a better com-
putational efficiency. It can be seen from the results that
the proposed ADR method can effectively improve RESs
utilization and load characteristics.
TABLE IV
SIMULATION RESULTS OF ECONOMY IN THE ELN SYSTEM
Economically, to further verify the advantages of the
proposed method, we present the economic indicators in the
four modes for comparison, as shown in Table IV.
Combined with the above figures and economic calculation
results, the following conclusions can be drawn. Case I per-
forms best in reducing the operational cost of the ELN system.
Specifically, we can see from the total cost that all the three
cases are in a profitable state, however the profit of Case I is
higher by 8.18%, 9.43%, and 24.81% over other three cases,
respectively. The energy loss cost of Case I is reduced by
1.55% and 9.67%, respectively, compared to Cases II and III.
These facts contribute to the conclusion that the ADR method
can significantly improve the economy of the ELN system.
In addition, PEV cluster is expected to participate in the
power regulation of ELN as a new mobile type of energy stor-
age in this paper. In the perspective of average cost of PEV
users, Case I is reduced by 26.08%, 37.12%, and 54.89%,
respectively, compared with the Cases II–IV. Facilitated by
the proposed ADR method, the PEV cluster and the BES
can receive the system compensation demand information to
dynamically adjust their charging/discharging behaviors. Our
ADR method can effectively improve the economic benefits
of individual users, thereby improving the enthusiasm of PEV
users to participate in power adjustment in ADR programs.
Besides, the RESs subsidy of Case I is similar to that of
Cases II and III, which is 4.32% higher than that of Case IV.
This also reflects that the proposed ADR method is capable
of promoting the self-consumption of the RESs in the ELN
system.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes an ADR framework combining decen-
tralized scheduling and smart contract for multitype ESSs
in ELNs. We explore for the first time the benefits of a
blockchain technique to present a secure P2P trading frame-
work among ESSs concerning ADR programs without relying
on a trusted third party. Specifically, a game-theoretic decen-
tralized scheduling model is studied based on the developed
internal pricing scheme. We have proved that the equilibrium
solution is consistent with Pareto-optimal. To improve trad-
ing security and privacy protection, we propose the use of
blockchain to design a localized P2P trading mechanism to

make distributed energy-sharing decisions for ESSs with smart
contract. Numerical results have illustrated that the proposed
decentralized ADR method can effectively improve economic
benefits for both the ELN system and PEVs as well as enhance
the supply demand balance in ELNs compared with traditional
typical algorithms. Our method could contribute to providing
an efficient and secure way for ELNs to implement in practice.
