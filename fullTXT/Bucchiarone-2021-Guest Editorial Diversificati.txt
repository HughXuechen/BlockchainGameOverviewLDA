Diversification in Urban Transportation Systems and
Beyond: Integrating People and Goods
for the Future of Mobility
THE increasing growing need for optimization of
transportation in a sustainable and green environment
is fundamental for the future of mobility. Companies, gov-
ernments, and non-governmental institutions are trying to
find new ways to contribute to this challenge. In particular,
the approach is to improve the efficiency and the quality of the
movement of diversification of an integrated way of transporta-
tion of people and goods. Many people may need to be at some
location at some point in time, or many goods may need to
be transported to nearby destinations with the same packaging
conditions. The main goal of this Special Issue was to integrate
the most recent advances in transportation that connect the
hybrid point of view. In particular, key contributions integrate
several interesting topics related to earning algorithms for the
integration of passengers and goods, gamification techniques,
semantic data, blockchain, and edge computing. Other topics
in urban mobility, railway, and highways were considered,
and hot topics on shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) brought
huge value. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) opens the
doors for new development in Vehicle to Everything (V2X),
which are crucial for the development of new services that
generate business and social impact in the future of a diversi-
fied way of the integration of passengers and goods mobility.
I. INTRODUCTION
Modern cities are complex socio-technical entities that exist
to provide services effectively to their residents and visitors.
In the transportation context, people need to travel quickly
and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging
from a trip of a few blocks to a journey across town or further.
At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered consid-
ering the needs of both the users and the businesses.
The continuous growth of population and the expansion
of urban centers bring us new mobility challenges for public
and private stakeholders and people living in crowded cities,
particularly considering the exponential increase of the amount
of data to be extracted and exploited [1].
Examples of such technologies are the dynamic introduction
of fares, and the application of artificial intelligence technolo-
gies based on big-data analytics and crowdsourcing [2], [3].
The provision of mobility services for people and
goods effectively to residents and visitors is a complex

socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart
mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of
the city transport facilities as well as sustainable mobility
within the urban environment. In the last few years, several
cities indicated interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV)
for the “last-mile” mobility services. With them, it seems to
be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles.
AVs are beginning to be thought of as a new mobil-
ity/delivery service in the city centers where narrow streets
are not easily served by traditional buses, and new mobility
strategies are required [4], [5]. They allow them to serve
critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise
and pollution.
Connected and autonomous vehicle technology and ser-
vices for the mobility of people and goods in mixed-mode
environments can improve efficiency, safety, and cleanliness.
From this point of view, autonomous vehicles must take
into consideration people’s acceptance [6] to get the market
diffusion of new technology.
An example of technology is the use of data platforms for
the customization of bus routes in city centers. This process
is very useful for the creation of environmental friendliness
and congestion alleviation in metropolitan areas. Furthermore,
gamification techniques empower citizen engagement and
traveler behavior toward green and sustainable actions.
Gamification techniques that empower autonomous driving
based on game theory are key challenges to non-cooperative
decision-making. Gamification is a key business opportunity
for small-medium companies aiming at changing the parading
in transportation with diversity strategies.
A key hot topic in the business environment is the eco-
platooning for cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs)
under Mixed Traffic Flow is becoming very common. This
phenomenon could be viewed as an issue for technology and
policy development and a great business opportunity for the
future of mobility services towards green transportation. It is
crucial for energy-efficient and secure driving, being also a
key research challenge in this sector [7], [8].
Leveraging on current research based on autonomous shut-
ters for public transportation of people and goods, a new
model [9] is capable of empowering companies to explore
new business models with social impact, thus increasing the
diversity capacity of transportation in smart cities.
The social aspects related to the improvement of the flow
of mobility of people and goods in city centers are key

factors towards the creation of a better environment that
enables new businesses in smart cities [10]. In particular,
the understanding of mobile data flow in smart cities for the
recommendation of better mobility habits for people is a
key business opportunity for public and private partnerships.
Another business opportunity is the concept of learning
algorithms for transportation of people and goods, which
is critical in the business of last-mile delivery due to a
large amount of on-line sales, thought out large platforms
of e-commerce. Furthermore, toward integrating people and
goods in a new mobility framework, it is fundamental to
the creation of software platforms capable of taking into
consideration the needs of different actors [11].
II. SPECIAL ISSUE GOALS
For this Special Issue, our assumption is that radical changes
will be introduced in the transport systems. These changes
will transform the current transport modes, and a higher
level of autonomy will be used compared to the present,
e.g., with the adoption of connected autonomous vehicles
and improved signaling. While attempting to reduce conges-
tion, technologies have already shown their positive impact
on making streets cleaner and safer. Nevertheless, living
in a profit-driven society, these technologies will eventually
attract private investment; however, what is the most adequate
funding scheme for a technology-driven transport system?
Who will cover the infrastructure installation and maintenance
costs for electric vehicles and connected and autonomous
cars? Furthermore, the future relies on digital data and digital
connectivity, highlighting the need is to protect the privacy of
the public.
In this Special Issue, we are interested in contributions
discussing how we can safeguard society and ensure a high
quality of life for all in a diverse and technology-dependent
transport system. In particular, we are interested in the follow-
ing themes:
• designing an inclusive transport system, e.g., engaging
the public into the design of technological solutions;
• ensuring that sustainable technological solutions are inte-
grated into future transport systems, e.g., modernizing
regulatory frameworks, societal needs, and strategic trans-
port planning (we can say smart cities but we need to
define the term, as it varies across disciplines);
• the use of technologies for transport studies, environmen-
tal assessment, and resilience in artificial intelligence.
III. SPECIAL ISSUE SUMMARY
For mobility diversification to be effective, there needs
to be a mix of commonality combined with elements that
explore the boundaries of this conceptual space. We can
explore this with the notion of betweenness centrality, which
describes how nodes in networks influence other nodes to
greater or lesser extents. This approach, made famous by
Google’s Page and Brin with their PageRank algorithm, uses
a matrix representation of the links and weights between the
nodes of a network to construct an Eigenvector that lists nodes
from most to least influence [12]. While the Google approach
uses inbound and outbound hyperlinks, words in documents
can also be used [13]. Using this approach, we can look at
which articles in this Special Issue are most central to the
concepts described in these articles, and also which articles
add the most diversity to this issue.
To explore these relationships, one of the editors
(Dr. Feldman) developed an interactive tool (Figure 1) that
shows the ordering of the documents in this issue and the word
network that connects them. Once normalized by document
length, the four articles that are at the top of the list, or most
central are Distefano et al.’s “Trustworthiness for transporta-
tion ecosystems: The blockchain vehicle information system,”
Hu et al.’s “Eco-platooning for cooperative automated vehicles
under mixed traffic flow,” Manchella et al.’s “FlexPool: A dis-
tributed model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
joint passengers and goods transportation, and Lv et al.’s
“Diversified technologies in Internet of Vehicles under intelli-
gent edge computing.”
This is reasonable, since these four papers focus on the role
of the vehicle as the central element of their approaches,
while also addressing broad themes in intelligent transporta-
tion research.
By this measure, the most central paper is Mazzara’s, which
presents “an all-encompassing scenario laying at the inter-
section of several domains, including manufacturing, logis-
tics, traveling, insurance, maintenance, and trading.” These
transactions are guaranteed by blockchain. The sprawling
nature of the problem ensures that many aspects of intelligent
transportation are touched upon.
The following three articles all deal with aspects of com-
municating between and the coordination of vehicles.
Hu describes research that creates string-stable groups of
coordinating vehicles, or platoons, that can optimize their
behavior with respect to energy footprint, even when shar-
ing the road with less-predictable human drivers. Manchella
approaches the optimal dispatching of vehicles to service the
joint transportation of goods and services using a deep learning
model that uses reinforcement learning to discover optimal
strategies rather than depend on an explicit, pre-defined model.
Finally, Lv’s article focuses on moving these processes out to
the vehicles themselves as an efficient internet of vehicles that
not only include vehicles but also communicate with roads,
infrastructure, and pedestrians.
After removing these papers from the list and recalculating
for centrality, we find that urban transportation represents
a cluster of research in this issue. Chen et al. discuss their
work on customized bus scheduling, which optimizes bus stops
stops, route design, and timetables using an objective function
that minimizes passengers’ inconvenience, the total number
of stops among all routes, and costs. This model is validated
using data from the Beijing transportation network. Autili et al.
address coordinating urban cooperative transport systems
using the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE, an EU-supported plat-
form that uses the concept of choreographies as a framework
for supporting reuse-based development of internet-connected
services, in this case, transportation. Iovino et al., on the other
hand, look at the problem of bus transit from the perspective
of the user who needs real-time information about bus fleets
to create an optimal route at a given time. The authors can
assemble a transit graph containing this information using a
recurrent LSTM network. The effectiveness of the approach

was validated against ground-truth data from the local bus
system of L’Aquila Italy.
The rest of the article in this issue explore the less-traveled
areas of intelligent transportation systems: Li et al. explore
ways of collecting data fairly using networks of UAVs that
have limited speed and flight times. Lv et al. approach the
particularly thorny problem of coordinating the behavior of
autonomous vehicles and human drivers coordinating lane-
changing using a model derived from a Stackelberg equilib-
rium from noncooperative game theory. Lou et al. perform
detailed research into electric train power management and
regenerative braking. Cao et al. provide an approach for devel-
oping transportation recommender systems that go beyond the
basic “A to B” solutions to produce personalized options that
range from the efficient to the frivolous. Kazhamiakin et al.
approach personalization from a different angle, involving the
use of gamification as a way of encouraging sustainable
transportation choices. Finally, Sobral et al. dig into the
semantics of the terms that represent origin-destination knowl-
edge. They do this by creating and visualizing ontologies that
represent this knowledge using the affordance of heat map
matrices.
Finally, as someone who just used unstructured text ana-
lytics to frame this section, I cannot help but appreciate
Baburajan et al. and their research into evaluating autonomous
vehicle questionnaire response using topic modeling on open-
ended responses and comparing those with closed-form
answers. In everything from bus schedules to getting along
on the roads to answering surveys, we must never forget that
transportation systems exist to support people. Our systems
always need to reflect this important fact.
IV. RESEARCH CHALLENGES FOR THE
FUTURE OF MOBILITY
The future moves relentlessly to more sustainable, equitable,
efficient, and convenient mobility. Achieving these goals,
if desirable to all, raises quite a few research challenges.
This Special Issue shows that there co-exist different research
streams concerned with diversity in transportation systems,
and new ones will certainly appear in the next few years. The
future of mobility will rely on strengthening the collaboration
between research and practice, involving citizens, urban
planners, and academia in pursuing the common goal of safer,
sustainable, inclusive, and equitable mobility.
Mobility data curation is a fundamental and critical
research challenge. First, it is easier to collect mobility data
than to handle and transform it into insightful information and
knowledge. Transport operators, agencies, or governments col-
lect and store vast volumes of data daily, but seldom is this data
used and analyzed. Second, most of the research challenges
regarding the future of mobility rely on the availability and
reliability of collected data over time [14]. It is not possible
to assess the impact of a transport policy or the effect of a new
mobility service or technology if data is not properly curated.
Lastly, the protection of our personal digital identities as, for
example, the establishment of rules that simultaneously allow
the exploitation of data collected from Automatic Fare Collec-
tion (AFC) systems while guaranteeing the anonymity of the
riders, are essential to creating a trustworthy environment.
Research on the impact of autonomous vehicles on urban
mobility will continue to increase since they will definitely
shape the future of the cities. Communications infrastructure,
vehicle collaboration protocols, and data collection schemes
are already active research areas. Challenges regarding ethics,
safety, and security of autonomous vehicles, as well as
their role in the optimal mix of ride-sharing services, will
become more prominent once they become part of our daily
lives [15]. Public transport planning and operations is a
traditional line of research. Today, more than ever, network
planning, timetabling, routing, and dispatching operations have
become increasingly connected, integrated, and optimized
across modes of transportation. The availability of real-time
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 22, NO. 4, APRIL 2021 2011
information and increasingly powerful computation tools make
it possible to handle the whole transportation network, inte-
grating different modes and operators. Then, it would be
possible, for example, to develop integrated optimization tools
aiming at the synchronization and robustness of timetables and
schedules [16], handling disruptions [17], and automating parts
of the planning process. Research on these topics will increase
ridership, reduce waiting times, and, ultimately, increase the
attractiveness of public transports.
Urban mobility is far more comprehensive than traditional
public transportation. In recent years, we have witnessed
the emergence of new concepts, new mobility services, with
different business models. Traditional public transportation
is becoming complemented with the demand for responsive
transportation services, micro-mobility, or ride-sharing ser-
vices. Through Mobility-as-a-Service apps, riders can plan,
pay, and use any transport mode or service in an integrated
and seamless way. It is increasingly important to research on
the topic of decision support systems and frameworks that
would help urban planners and transport operators in choosing
the optimal mix of mobility services to offer, together with
the definition of equitable and inclusive fare structures [18].
Behavioral, collaborative, simulation-based, or gamification
models could play an important role in this area, allowing
to simulate and evaluate scenarios that would improve the
mobility experience while decreasing the costs involved.
In this complex and diverse ecosystem, there is still plenty
of space left for the active involvement of the citizens in
the definition and evaluation of a system that is meant to
suit their needs. Independently of the data collected daily
from intelligent transportation systems, which may provide
individual mobility and activity profiles, or origin-destination
matrices, it is of utmost importance to research on participative
and collaborative methods that would promote the integration
of a varied and inclusive sample of citizens in the urban
mobility characterization process.
