Abstract
The 5G mobile network is promising to handle the dynamic traffic demands of
user equipment (UE). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with wire-
less transceivers can act as flying base stations in heterogeneous networks to
ensure the quality of service of UE. However, it is challenging to efficiently
allocate limited bandwidth to UE due to dynamic traffic demands and low net-
work coverage. In this study, a blockchain-enabled bandwidth allocation
framework is proposed for secure bandwidth trading. Furthermore, the pro-
posed framework is based on the Cournot oligopoly game theoretical model to
provide the optimal solution; that is, bandwidth is allocated to different UE
based on the available bandwidth at UAV-assisted-based stations (UBSs) with
optimal profit. The Cournot oligopoly game is performed between UBSs and
cellular base stations (CBSs). Utility functions for both UBSs and CBSs are
introduced on the basis of the available bandwidth, total demand of CSBs, and
cost of providing cellular services. The proposed framework prevents security
attacks and maximizes the utility functions of UBSs and CBSs.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In today’s advanced and modern world, users have
everything available at their fingertips by using wireless
communication [1, 2]. A user can access computation-
intensive applications [3, 4] such as real-time chat apps,
video streaming apps, gaming, and many others without
glitches. The rapid development in the mobile communica-
tion system 5G provides a secure network environment
with more reliability and reduces latency to improve the
quality of service (QoS) to users. Unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) [5] play a crucial role in the future generation of
wireless communication because of their deployment
flexibility, lower cost, and high mobility. A UAV is used as
a flying base station to provide better QoS to low single
users, and it extends the terrestrial network coverage and
capacity of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) [6]. A UAV-
based HetNet is a new paradigm for the future generation
of cellular communication systems, and it consists of cellu-
lar base stations (CBSs) provided by the cellular service pro-
viders (CSPs) and UAV-assisted-based stations (UBSs)
provided by UAV service providers (USPs).
UBSs are humanity’s best invention, moving
dynamically to different areas in different directions to
meet the network demands of HetNets [7, 8]. These
network demands include handling unexpected traffic of

user equipment (UE) and providing good QoS to UE in
terrestrial areas [9] such as disaster management and
remote regions. A UBS uses bandwidth-sharing [10] or
bandwidth-trading mechanisms [11] to deliver wireless
services to UE to provide efficient QoS. CBSs share an
ideal bandwidth with UBSs through the selling process in
the bandwidth-sharing mechanism. In the bandwidth-
trading mechanism, CBSs purchase the required
bandwidth from UBSs, and the purchased bandwidth is
allocated to USPs through the trading mechanism. This
study considers a scenario to handle terrestrial areas such
as disaster management and remote regions, where unex-
pected traffic occurs. The bandwidth-trading mechanism
is suitable for such areas because UBSs use the
newly allocated bandwidth from USPs. Many researchers
[12, 13] have used various algorithms to implement the
trading mechanism between CBSs and UBSs. However,
security constraints and privacy issues such as authenti-
cation and malicious activity are not considered when
entering or leaving the network for secure trading. More-
over, the trade-off between UBSs’ optimal profit and
CBSs’ optimal bandwidth utilities is not considered.
Blockchain [14, 15] is a promising solution for
handling security threats and privacy issues of HetNets.
Blockchain is repeatedly used in research, industry, and
various applications of UAV networks. Blockchain is a
decentralized and distributed architecture of nodes that
securely communicate with each other, without a cen-
tralized third party. In this study, a blockchain-enabled
bandwidth auction framework is considered to address
security and privacy issues and maximize the utility func-
tion of CBSs and UBSs in HetNets.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• Bandwidth trading was introduced between CBSs and
UBSs to motivate CBSs to hire UBSs to meet the
dynamic traffic demand of UE and provide good QoS
to UE in terrestrial areas. Moreover, the trading
approach enhances the revenues of CSPs and USPs.
• A blockchain-enabled bandwidth-trading framework
based on the game theory is proposed to prevent
security attacks and privacy issues while performing
bandwidth trading. The framework creates a peer-to-
peer blockchain network between CBSs and UBSs. It
improves transaction security and privacy without
depending on a third party.
• The Cournot oligopoly game model is used for
bandwidth allocation to deliver efficient services to UE
in HetNets, where CBSs act as bandwidth buyers and
UBSs are bandwidth sellers.
• The numeric results of the proposed framework show
that it offers the best services to UE in the low network
area and maximizes the profit of UBSs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
presents related research work. The network model is
given in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the proposed
framework and provides a complete overview of the pro-
posed bandwidth-trading model. Performance evaluation
is provided in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the
study with possible future directions.
2 | RELATED WORK
A UBS is a promising solution to meet the unexpected
traffic demand of UE in HetNets. A UBS provides QoS to
UE within the coverage area based on the available band-
width and improves the coverage of HetNets [16]. The
bandwidth allocation of UBSs is based on a CBS demand,
that is, the best bandwidth is provided to their associated
UE. The demanded bandwidth allocation is performed
through a random allocation mechanism, trading mecha-
nism, and spectrum sensing.
Spectrum sensing is typically inaccurate and susceptible
to sensing errors, and spectrum databases are managed cen-
trally [17]. A UAV-assisted HetNet (UAHT) was proposed
in Li and Cai [18] for enhancing the coverage area and
deployment of UBSs in the network. In the UAHT method,
bandwidth allocation of UAVs is based on historical data of
the network and allocates bandwidth based on the fixed
mechanism. A novel resource allocation method (NRAM)
was proposed based on the Cournot oligopoly model in
Gomez and others [19] for bandwidth allocation in high
network-loaded areas. Here NRAM enhances the UE satis-
faction level and provides better possible resource allocation
through BS cooperation. Similarly, in He and Wang [20], a
game theoretical nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
power allocation method (GNPAM) is proposed for multi-
media upstreaming in the Internet of Things using the
Cournot oligopoly model. In GNPAM, UE uploads multi-
media content to a BS through the NOMA technology, and
the UE obtains the desirable utility gain.
In Manzoor and others [21], the random allocation
method was considered for bandwidth allocation, which
depends on the received signal to interference and noise
ratio of UE from a CBS. The UBS randomly allocates the
required bandwidth to the CBS, and the cost is charged
for providing cellular service to the UE. Similarly, the
game theoretical-based bandwidth allocation (GTBA)
method was analyzed in Xu and others [22] to enhance
the utility of UBSs. The GTBA approach is based on the
Stackelberg game model. UBSs are considered the game
leaders, and CBSs are the followers in the game. The
leader estimates the bandwidth price to provide cellular
services, and the follower estimates the required band-
width to provide QoS in the coverage area. The game is

continued until the Stackelberg equilibrium is reached;
that is, it maximizes the utilization of the UBS. However,
in the random allocation method, UBSs fix the cost per
unit of bandwidth, which ignores maximizing the utility
of the CBS, that is, QoS is provided to UE. Moreover, the
authors in earlier studies [21, 22] did not consider any
security constraints during the allocation from UBS to
CBS, and the CBS utility maximization was based on the
moves of the leader.
In Hassija and others [23], blockchain and game
theoretical-based framework (BGTF) were introduced for
secure bandwidth allocation. In BGTF, the required
parameters, such as bandwidth demand and cost, are ini-
tialized to apply the game model. UBSs set their available
bandwidth and costs charged by service providers. Simi-
larly, the CBS sets its minimum demand in terms of
bandwidth requirements and the cost they are willing to
pay. Next, auctioning is performed while estimating the
median values of the cost and bandwidth provided by
UBS and CBS. Then, the cost of the CBSs increases
slightly, whereas the bandwidth decreases slightly. This
process is repeated until an equilibrium point is reached.
The contract theory was used in Hu and others [24] to
provide QoS to UE in a low coverage area through spec-
trum trading between CBSs and UBSs. However, Hassija
and others [23, 24] did not consider the security and pri-
vacy challenges in spectrum trading. The design model of
the blockchain with respect to bandwidth allocation was
not explained properly.
Many researchers [25–28] have used blockchain tech-
nology for secure communication and network privacy in
wireless networks, where UBS communicates with UE.
However, no study has used blockchain for secure band-
width trading between CBSs and UBSs; that is, malicious
attacks are prevented from unauthorized CBSs and UBSs
during bandwidth trading. This paper addresses the secure
bandwidth-trading limitations and maximizes the utility
function of UBSs and CBSs. A blockchain-enabled
bandwidth-trading framework based on the Cournot oligop-
oly game is proposed. The proposed framework enhances
the profit of UBSs as well as provides good QoS to UE.
3 | NETWORK MODEL FOR
BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION
Here, the network environment is a HetNet, which con-
sists of a set of CBSs provided by CSPs, UBSs provided by
USPs, and UE. CBSs provide cellular services to the asso-
ciated UE, and UBSs provide cellular services to UE,
which is unable to receive the best QoS from CBS due to
low coverage or limited resources. Different network
environments include disaster areas, remote areas, or
unexpected traffic demand areas such as crowded public
events. Here, some UE suffers from low latency or no
network coverage, which leads to many problems such as
low revenue for CSPs and less trust in CBSs. Considering
this network model, CBSs can provide the best QoS to all
UE in the network area at an affordable cost, and UBSs
are a highly promising solution.
The network model in the proposed work is depicted
in Figure 1. Let B¼fb1, b2, b3, :::, bmg indicate the set of
CBSs, and U ¼fu1, u2, u3,:::,ung denote the set of UBSs.
Here, m and n represent the number of CBSs and UBSs,
respectively. Consider a scenario in which a public event
is being held in a rural area, and all UE is associated with
different CBSs from B¼fb1, b2, b3, :::, bmg in the area.
Here, the network traffic demand is high, and the number
of served UE is greater than the supported capacity of the
CBSs. Moreover, some UE receives the best QoS, some UE
receives QoS with low latency, and some UE has low cov-
erage. To meet the network traffic demands of UE and
CBS resource availability is low in the considered scenario.
To provide QoS to the UE, the CBSs may hire or rent UBSs
from U ¼fu1, u2, u3, :::, ung based on the traffic demand
of the UE. In such circumstances, CBSs may choose the
same or different UBSs based on the cost of bandwidth
per unit, required bandwidth, time complexity, available
bandwidth at UBSs, and so on. The hiring of UBSs
through the bandwidth-trading framework is based on the
Cournot oligopoly game model. The hired UBSs provide
the best QoS to the UE with low coverage and latency.
In the proposed work, the Cournot oligopoly game
model is used to find the optimal bandwidth to be allocated

to CBSs by UBSs. Before performing the game, the system
establishes a peer-to-peer blockchain network between
CBSs and UBSs to prevent malicious attacks during band-
width trading. However, reliable and third-party centers
can disclose private data to an attacker in this environment.
Moreover, in this scenario, data transmission through UAV
networks broadcasts untrusted features that could breach
the system’s security and privacy. The different types of
attackers or opponents are mentioned below.
• Malicious bandwidth provider: A malicious USP adver-
tises fraudulent bandwidth leasing without sufficient
bandwidth available.
• Malicious bandwidth buyer: A malicious CSP refuses to
pay because it claims it has not received any bandwidth.
• Malicious trusted third party: A malicious trust center
may not only disclose CBSs’ privacy but tamper with
UBSs’ credit value for profit.
To address these security risks, distributed and
trusted management techniques are required to detect
and protect against malicious peers. To overcome these
limitations, a blockchain-based bandwidth-trading model
is proposed to secure the environment for operators.
4 | BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED
BANDWIDTH-TRADING
FRAMEWORK
Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer ledger designed
to securely record transactions between participants in a
verifiable and permanent manner without using a trusted
center. Blockchain enables secure bandwidth-trading execu-
tion in a distributed and transparent environment. This
section proposes a blockchain-enabled bandwidth-trading
framework to support safe bandwidth trading between
CSPs and USPs. The proposed blockchain-enabled
bandwidth-trading framework is depicted in Figure 2.
4.1 | Overview of framework
The proposed framework forms a private blockchain
network and provides a digital identity between nodes,
that is, CBSs and UBSs. Data identification is performed
on the node when entering or leaving the network for
secure communication. The trusted authority manages
data identity and executes the bandwidth-trading model
in the blockchain network. The Ethereum framework is
used in this study to simulate and verify the effectiveness
of the proposed framework. The components of the
framework are defined as follows:
1. Trusted authority: The trusted authority is in charge of
initializing the entire bandwidth-trading model, produc-
ing public parameters and cryptographic keys, and man-
aging the identities of the operators. Notably, the trusted
authority functions as a parameter initializer to provide
entity identity authorization and certificate issuance
before initiating blockchain-enabled bandwidth trading.
It remains offline most of the time.
For the framework initialization on the blockchain net-
work, an elliptic curve digital signature technique and
asymmetric cryptography are employed to ensure data
integrity and unforgeability. The government

department acts as a trusted authority and verifies the
identity of a provider. A provider is considered a legal
entity with its registration information. The provider’s
information is its identity id and public/private key
pairs. To avoid confidentiality and integrity issues, a
public key is used to encrypt transactions; to avoid
authentication and nonrepudiation issues, a private key
is used to digitally sign transactions.
2. Bandwidth provider and requester: The CBS acts as the
bandwidth requester to purchase bandwidth from the
UBS. The UBS acts as the bandwidth provider and sells
the bandwidth to the CSP in return for revenue. The
proposed bandwidth-trading model is executed between
the bandwidth requester and provider. All transactions
between the bandwidth requester and provider are used
for block creation, and then, the created block is verified
through a consensus algorithm. If the block is con-
firmed, it is added to the blockchain network.
4.2 | Consensus algorithm
The term “consensus” refers to an agreement reached
among nodes in a peer-to-peer network. In a centralized
network environment, the central server or authorized
person works as a trusted operator, and it is used to reach
an agreement among the participating nodes. There is no
central authority in a distributed network environment,
so different consensus algorithms are used to maintain
trust in the distributed environment. One of the basic
and most commonly used consensus algorithms is the
proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm [29, 30]. Here, any node
with a certain amount of storage and computing power
can operate as a trusted authority for validating transac-
tions and adding them to the main blockchain network.
However, the PoW algorithm is unsuitable for distributed
private network environments. The proof-of-authority
(PoA) algorithm is an alternative consensus mechanism
that relies on known and reputable validators to produce
transaction blocks and provides computational power to
a network [31]. It enables faster transactions by using a
byzantine fault tolerance algorithm with identity as a
stake. The proposed work exploits the PoA algorithm to
validate and add transaction blocks to the chain.
4.3 | Proposed bandwidth-trading model
A. Game modeling
The proposed bandwidth-trading model provides a
trade-off between the bandwidth demand of CBSs and the
cost charged by UBSs through the Cournot oligopoly game
model. In this model, CBSs and UBSs are considered
players and have equal priority. Initially, CBSs and UBSs
can set their requirements in the model, that is, the band-
width demand of CBSs and the cost charged by UBSs per
unit of bandwidth. To obtain the demanded bandwidth of
CBSs and revenue of UBSs, separate utility functions are
developed for CBSs and UBSs. The utility function of UBSs
is composed of the revenue generated from the sale of
secure bandwidth and the cost of providing bandwidth. The
utility function of the uth UBS is defined as follows:
FuðPuÞ¼ Pu ∗ Ab�Cu ∗ Ab, ð1Þ
where Pu represents the secure bandwidth price of the
uth UBS and Cu denotes the cost for providing bandwidth
of the uth UBS. Ab represents the required bandwidth of
the bth CBS. There is an inverse relation between the
market price and demand, that is, Pu ¼G�1ðAbÞ.
Pu ¼G�1ðAbÞ ) Ab ¼GðPuÞ, ð2Þ
Pu ¼ G�1ðAbÞ
) Ab ¼ GðPuÞ:
ð3Þ
Hence, the utility function of CBSs in (1) can be written
as follows:
FuðPuÞ¼Pu ∗GðPuÞ�Cu ∗GðPuÞ: ð4Þ
The utility function of CBS is composed of the user
satisfaction derived from acquiring secure bandwidth and
the cost of acquiring secure bandwidth from the accom-
panying UAV. The utility function of the bth CBS is
defined as follows:
FbðAbÞ¼ sb ∗ logð1þRb ∗AbÞ�Pd ∗Ab, ð5Þ
where sb represents the user satisfaction of the bth CBS
and Rb denotes the achieved data rate of the bth CBS.1
The logarithmic function scales the value with respect to
sb. The objective of both CBSs and UBSs is to maximize
their utilities.
B. Game analysis
The Cournot oligopoly game model is used for band-
width trading, where CBSs and UBSs are players with
equal priority. Equations (1) and (5) are utility functions
for UBSs and CBSs, respectively. Assume that there is the
Nash equilibrium (NE), that is, CBS and UBS will have
the optimal UE satisfaction level at the same time UBSs
achieve the optimal level of output. The NE is the inter-
section of the best response of CBSs and UBSs.

C. Proposed algorithm
The Cournot oligopoly game model proposes an
optimal bandwidth allocation algorithm. The proposed
algorithm is used to find the optimal bandwidth and
respective prices of CBSs and UBSs, which are shown in
Algorithm 1.
The description of the proposed algorithm is as
follows:
• First, initialize the bandwidth price, the available
bandwidth of the UBSs, and the bandwidth demand
rate of CBSs.
• If the total demanded bandwidth of CBSs is greater than
or equal to the available bandwidth of UBSs, update the
bandwidth price of UBSs using (8) and update the band-
width demand of CBSs using (9). The UBS bandwidth
price and CBS bandwidth demand are updated; that is,
they increase or decrease on the basis of the constant
values.
• Else, the bandwidth price of UBSs is updated
using (10), and the demanded bandwidth of CBSs is
updated using (11). (10) increases the bandwidth
demand based on constant parameters. Similarly, (11)
finds the optimal bandwidth price of UBSs using the
gradient descent (rUmðPmÞ) method. The gradient
descent is given as

• The process is repeated until no significant changes in
the Pm and An.
The computational time complexity of the proposed
algorithm is OðnmÞ, where m represents the number of
CBSs and n represents the number of UBSs.
4.4 | Design goals
The proposed blockchain-enabled bandwidth allocation
model achieves the following security and privacy goals:
• Service provider authentication: Service providers
should be anonymously authenticated so that no one
can deceive registered providers.
• Privacy: A provider’s requests, responses, and transac-
tions should not reveal any personal information about
their sources.
• Traceability: In the event of a dispute or unexpected
events, the trusted authority can trace the identity of
the provider.
• Reliability: Based on the design of the framework, each
provider maintains a copy of the chain of transactions,
and the transaction is linked to the bandwidth-trading
model. Thus, no node can perform any modification
without proper authorization.

5 | PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, the security assessment of the proposed
blockchain-enabled bandwidth-trading model is provided
in Section 5.1. Next, the numeric results of the proposed
model are discussed in Section 5.2.
5.1 | Security assessment
In contrast to conventional communication security and
privacy protection, our proposed framework can ensure
that the bandwidth-trading model is secure through a
private blockchain. It provides a defensive capability
against various potential security attacks. Additional
details regarding the proposed framework for security
assessment are presented below.
1. Privacy protection: This characteristic is ensured by
the encrypted transmission of information between
operators. It is impossible to deduce the original pri-
vate message from the operators without knowing the
sender’s secret key.
2. Prevention of replay attack: Using a unique identifier,
each transaction is digitally signed. Consequently, trans-
actions with the same identifier will be rejected by the
consensus server, thereby preventing replay attacks.
5.2 | Simulation result
In the simulation scenario, the network area is consid-
ered a HetNet with five UBSs and CBSs, respectively. The
bandwidth demand of each CBS is assumed to be differ-
ent, that is, 4, 7, 9, 12, and 15 Mbps. Similarly, each UBS
bandwidth price is different, that is, 0.14, 0.23, 0.35, 0.40,
and 0.5 cents. The satisfaction parameters of the five
CBSs are 0.5, 0.3, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.5, respectively. The itera-
tion step size ϵ is equal to 0.1. Through comparative anal-
ysis, the proposed model is compared with the BGTF
method [23] and GTBA method [22].
The BGTF model performs the game auction using
the bandwidth demand and cost parameters of CBSs and
UBSs. In the game auction, the estimates of the median
values of cost and bandwidth are provided by UBSs and
CBSs. Then, the cost of CBSs increases slightly, and the
bandwidth decreases slightly. This process is repeated
until an equilibrium point is reached. The GTBA uses the
Stackelberg game model. In the GTBA model, UBSs are
leaders and CBSs are followers, that is, the leader moves
first, and then, the follower moves sequentially. Here, the
leaders receive benefits because they can manipulate
extraction patterns by exploiting resource constraints,
that is, the utility function of UBSs. In contrast, the pro-
posed framework maximizes the utility function of UBSs
and CBSs with secure bandwidth allocation in HetNets.
In Figure 3, the performance comparison of the
proposed model, BGTF model, and GTBA model is pre-
sented in terms of the number of iterations for computing
the bandwidth allocation of each CBS. From the figure,
the proposed model takes less number of iterations over
different CBSs than the BGTF and GTBA models. The
proposed model decreases the number of iterations by
approximately 25%–40% and 30%–50% compared with
the BGTF and GTBA models, respectively. In the GTBA
model, the number of iterations increased because the
leader places its demand first and then the follower
places the demand based on the leader’s move. Hence,
the requirements were not satisfied easily compared with
the proposed model. In the BGTF model, the game auc-
tion is based on the fixed values of the bandwidth and
price changes until meeting the requirements of the equi-
librium point. Hence, Figure 3 shows that the proposed
model consumes less computation time than the GTBA
model to reach the required optimal solution.
Figure 4 shows the utility of various CBSs in the pro-
posed, BGTF, and GTBA models with different band-
width demands as input. The proposed model provides
better bandwidth demand and maximizes the utility of

and GTBA models, respectively. In the GTBA model,
leaders do not allow players to put their demands inde-
pendently, irrespective of the initial bandwidth availabil-
ity of UBSs. Moreover, as the bandwidth of UBSs is fully
utilized, their revenue also increases.
Similarly, Figure 5 shows the achieved utility of vari-
ous UBSs in the proposed, BGTF, and GTBA models. The
proposed model provides higher utilities on UBS2 to
UBS5 in terms of revenue compared with the BGTF and
GTBA models. UBS1 receives lower revenue in the pro-
posed model than in the GTBA model because the leader
puts more price at initialization and satisfies the respec-
tive bandwidth. The proposed model enhances UBS2 to
UBS5 utilities by approximately 30% and 60% compared
with the BGTF and GTBA models, respectively. Figures 4
and 5 show that the proposed model maximizes the
utilities of both CBSs and UBSs compared with the BGTF
and GTBA models. The overall performance of the pro-
posed model is improved compared with that of the
BGTF and GTBA models in terms of the obtained band-
width of CBSs, enhanced revenue of UBSs, and secure
trading communication.
Figure 6 shows the bandwidth demand versus the
obtained bandwidth of the proposed model. As shown in
Figure 6, the obtained bandwidth by each CBS is at par
with the demanded bandwidth, that is, the utilization of
CBSs is maximized. Moreover, it enhances the revenues
of UBSs. In the proposed model, all players have the lib-
erty to raise their demands irrespective of the demand
and price of other players.

Similarly, Figure 7 shows the transaction-processing
time during bandwidth trading against the increasing
number of players. The block transaction-processing time
is the duration between the transaction initiation and the
transaction confirmation in a new block [32]. Here, the
X-axis represents players in the proposed bandwidth-
trading model, that is, the number of UBSs and CBSs.
Here, the number of players also indicates the number of
transactions in each trading iteration, as every player is
allowed to initiate a single transaction for every trading
iteration. The Y -axis represents the average transaction-
processing time in seconds. Figure 7 shows that the block
transaction-processing time increases with an increase in
the number of players. The proposed model achieves an
18-s average transaction-processing time for 50 players.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a blockchain-enabled bandwidth-trading
framework is exploited for allocating bandwidth to CBSs
to handle unexpected traffic demands of UE and provide
QoS to UE in terrestrial areas. Bandwidth trading is per-
formed between CBSs and UBSs using the proposed opti-
mal bandwidth allocation model based on the Cournot
oligopoly game theory. Before performing the game, the
framework establishes a peer-to-peer blockchain network
between CBSs and UBSs to prevent malicious attacks
during bandwidth trading. The network authenticates
and verifies each UBS and CBS before they enter the
trading network. The performance evaluation of the pro-
posed framework shows that it enhances the network’s
transaction security and privacy protection. Moreover, it
provides the best QoS to the UE in low network coverage
areas and maximizes the profit of UBSs.
