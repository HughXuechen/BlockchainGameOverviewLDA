Abstract：As an important renewable alternative energy source, one of the most critical aspects 
that can be used reasonably is the improvement of the biomass energy supply chain. In view of 
the uncontrollable transportation process in the biomass energy supply chain, Blockchain 
technology(BT) is introduced to optimize the biomass energy collection, transportation, and 
storage processes. On this basis, the game model is applied to analyze the impact of BT on the 
members of the biomass supply chain and the overall profit of the supply chain. Research 
shows that the application of BT is beneficial to increase the profits of biomass energy supply 
chain members within the threshold range, and for the overall benefit of the supply chain, the 
overall benefit of the supply chain under centralized decision-making is the highest. 
1. Introduction 
In recent years,  Chinese biomass energy industry has made great progress, but there is still a 
problem of high production costs. In the biomass energy supply chain, transportation costs, storage 
costs and collection costs associated with transportation issues account for a large part of production 
costs. Therefore, in order to attract industrial participants' interest and more investment in 
biomass-based industries, how to save transportation costs and improve the profitability of biomass 
power generation has become the key to promoting the sustainable development of the biomass power 
generation supply chain. BT has technical advantages such as decentralization, non-tampering, 
distributed sharing, asymmetric encryption, and smart contracts[1]. In recent years, the successful 
application of the supply chain in many industries has had a great impact. This is biomass The further 
development of the energy generation industry provides new ideas. 
2. Biomass energy supply chain 
Nunes Leonel J. R. et al. [2] think that by developing a logistics management system of biomass 
storage Park, there are two different biomass storage parks to solve the internal logistics problem in 
the process of biomass power generation. Amin mirkoue et al. [3] proposed an energy supply chain ,the 
results show that hybrid supply chains can improve the sustainability performance of traditional 
supply infrastructure by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impact (up to 5%). Zahraee SM 
et al. [4] are committed to studying the impact of improving efficiency by changing transportation 
technology and production technology on the environmental sustainability of palm oil. Nunes et al. [5] 
compiled a literature review on biomass fuel research and summarized the research of different 
scholars on the biomass supply chain, mainly focusing on three aspects. Sangpil Ko et al. [6] 
established a mixed integer programming model and concluded that external (social and 
environmental) costs accounted for a considerable part of the total transportation cost (about 26-37%).

MILP model, and proposed a multi-stage solution method.Su Shiwei et al. [8] summarized the literature 
at home and abroad, and obtained the research on the impact of the special properties of raw material 
fuel raw materials and the uncertain factors in the transportation collection process on the logistics 
cost, which is the conclusion of the possible research directions of domestic scholars in the future[9]. 
3. Application of blockchain in biomass energy supply chain 
3.1. Application of blockchain in demand management 
Power plant companies will write demand for biomass energy into the demand block. Each purchase 
station obtains the biomass energy demand from the demand block, summarizes it, retrieves the 
current storage situation of the power plant, and then reasonably determines the demand content of the 
storage in the power plant and the needs of the purchase station based on the purchase station's own 
situation and the situation of other purchase stations Complete the demand goal to complete the 
demand[10] . 
3.2. Application of blockchain in procurement management 
the acquisition station determines the storage content, that is, the type, quantity, supply time limit, 
quality status, etc., when the demand cannot be met, the acquisition station completes the acquisition 
of biomass energy in accordance with the requirements of the procurement procedures, and writes the 
acquisition content into the procurement blockchain to facilitate responsibility People organize 
collection[11]. 
3.3. Application of blockchain in contract management 
The purchase station maps the biomass energy purchase and storage conditions with the demand of 
power plant companies, and writes the mapping results into the contract block. After the delivery 
process is completed, the acquisition station and the power plant company will include the delivery 
process in their respective receiving block and supply block to ensure that other companies in the 
supply chain can supervise the entire process.  
4. Construction of game model 
The parameters are set as follows: 
cm The unit production cost of the power plant enterprise; 
ct  The transportation cost of the acquisition station;

conversion rate of the repurchased product. K is acquire capabilities. Therefore, the acquisition

ct  mr 2 / 2, m is the sensitivity coefficient of the acquisition radius to the transportation cost, and r is 
the acquisition radius. The implementation cost of BT is ce  he2 / 2 , h is the sensitivity coefficient of 
BT capability to implementation cost, and e is the degree of BT capability. 
4.1. Decentralized decision model construction 
The model under decentralized decision-making is represented by "S". Under decentralized 
decision-making, power plant enterprises and purchase stations form a secondary biomass energy 
supply chain. The profits of power plant companies, purchase stations and the overall supply chain are 
as follows: f a bp en    , zS  qp(w ct  cp) ,

First of all, by bringing in the cost function, using Stackelberg game theory analysis, the optimal 
purchase price and sales price can be obtained as follows: 
pS 

Secondly, by bringing wS  and pS
 into qsS and qpS , it can be seen that the optimal acquisition and 
sales are as follows: 
qsS 

Finally, wS 、 pS 、qsS、qpS  are brought into the profit function, we can see that the optimal 
supply chain members and the overall profit are: 
zS 

4 .2. Centralized decision model building 
Under centralized decision-making, use "D" to indicate that under centralized decision-making, power 
plant enterprises and purchase stations form a secondary biomass energy supply chain as a system as a 
whole, so the overall profit of the supply chain is:

First, using Stackelberg game theory analysis, the best selling price can be obtained as: 
pD 

Secondly, by bringing pD in qsD  and qpD , we can see that the optimal purchase volume and 
sales volume are:

4.3. Nash decision model construction 
Under the Nash decision, "N" means that under the Nash equilibrium decision, the power plant 
company and the purchase station form a secondary biomass energy supply chain. Both are in the 
same decision-making position. The sales price is the unit marginal profit of the power plant company. 
Then the supply chain The profits of the members and the overall supply chain are as follows:

First, using Nash equilibrium game theory analysis, the optimal purchase price and sales price can 
be obtained as follows:

Secondly, by bringing wN

sales volume are: 
qsN  

Analysis of the impact of BT on sales volume and repurchase volume under three different 
decision-making modes. As shown in Figure3-Figure4, with the enhancement of BT, sales and 
repurchase volumes show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, indicating that there is a 
threshold, so that the enhancement of BT capabilities within the threshold is beneficial to the 
improvement Increase in sales.

Figure 7. Analysis of the impact 
of BT on the overall profit of 
the supply chain 
 
With the enhancement of BT capabilities, under different decision-making modes The profits of 
supply chain members all show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, indicating that the 
technical capabilities of the blockchain are within the threshold range, which is conducive to 
increasing the profits of the biomass energy supply chain members and bringing higher profits to the 
supply chain as a whole. However, if the threshold is exceeded, improving the technical capabilities 
of the blockchain will affect the income of the supply chain members and reduce the overall profit 
of the supply chain. Therefore, considering the company's own capabilities, the implementation of 
BT should be controlled within a certain threshold. The profit of the acquisition station is higher 
than the profit under the Nash equilibrium decision under the decentralized decision, and the profit 
of the power plant enterprise is higher than the profit of the acquisition station under the Nash 
equilibrium decision.  
5. Conclusions 
This article separately discusses the current status of biomass energy transportation and the current 
development of BT, and innovatively combines the two, expounds the application of BT to the 
biomass energy supply chain, which is important for the collection, transportation, and transportation 
of biomass energy. Optimization of storage process. Using the game model, it shows that the BT is 
within the threshold range, which is beneficial to increase the profits of the members of the biomass 
energy supply chain and improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain. Among them, it is more
