ABSTRACT
Background and aims: Play-to-earn (P2E) gaming is a newly emerging form of gaming increasingly based
on blockchain technology. In this paper, we examine the mechanics and business model of these games
and their potential benefits and risks for players.Methods: The paper draws upon and critically synthesises
the developing published literature on predatory monetization in gaming as well as objective market data
drawn from credible online sources. Results: P2E gaming blurs the boundaries between gaming and
trading and may not yield many of the benefits promoted to consumers or otherwise conveyed through
marketing and social media messaging. Particular risks include the deflationary nature of reward cur-
rencies and the asymmetric reward structures that heavily favour early investors and exploit late adopters.
Discussion and conclusions: This paper highlights the need for greater consumer awareness of the me-
chanics and risks of these new gaming models. It will be important for business models to be more
transparent and designed so as to encourage more equitable game outcomes, sustainable returns, a balance
between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and protection for potentially vulnerable players.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last two decades, there has been a significant transformation in the nature of
commercial gaming. In the 1990s through to the 2000s most gaming was based on a ‘pay-to-
own’ (P2O) model. In P2O, consumers would outlay money for consoles, handheld devices
or computer software (e.g., CDs) that could be installed. There was usually a single (often
larger initial financial outlay), but then all games and game options were largely owned.
Player access to gaming features or levels was predominantly based on natural game pro-
gression and playing skill. In the 2000s, as broadband Internet spread around the world,
new models began to emerge (King & Delfabbro, 2019a, 2019b). These included: (a) free-to-
play (F2P) models in which people could gain access to entire games, but which required
them to pay for additional content such as gaining access to certain levels or content or
pay for in-game assets; (b) subscription models in which whole games are sold in stages;
or (c) ‘Freemium models’ in which limited versions of games are made available, but the
person has to pay to obtain full access to all the functionality of the game. Broader terms such
as play-to-play (P2P) are often applied to any games which require an outlay to gain access to
games or game functionality, with the term ‘play-to-win’ (P2W) referring to games which
advantages in the game are afforded by paying money (e.g., to get better in-game assets)
rather than through just skillful play. In each case, the trend has been towards the greater
monetization of games, with an increasing focus of encouraging the use of ongoing micro-
transactions and repeat purchases to provide additional streams of revenue for the gaming
industry (King, Delfabbro, Gainsbury et al., 2019).

According to Davidovici-Nora (2013) and Hamari and
Lehdonvirta (2010), new F2P business models involving in-
game micro-transactions emerged within the Asian region as
a result of problems with real money transactions, the use
of bots and cheating software, piracy and other criminal
activities in the late 1990s and 2000s. In essence, when some
massive multiplayer online (MMO) games became popular,
the only way to trade in-game assets was on third party sites.
Concerns arose when this created disparities between
different players (traders and non-traders of assets), copy-
right violations, and the involvement of unscrupulous
operators. The internalization of in-game assets, in-game
currencies (i.e., a more internalized market-place) gave
platforms more control over their own copyright and the
gaming ecosystem. F2P, as Davidovici-Nora points out, also
afforded many marketing advantages and game flexibility
including: the ability to attract new players who could try the
game for free and new sources of value for longer-term
players. This new model appears to have been commercially
successful with the global online microtransaction market
estimated to have attracted about $59 billion in 2021 and
is projected to reach $67 billion in 2022 (The Business
Research Company, 2022).
Despite their many commercial benefits to the industry,
F2P features such as microtransactions1 have attracted some
criticism and have sometimes been described as ‘predatory’
(King & Delfabbro, 2018; Petrovskaya & Zendle, 2021).
Predatory, in this context, refers to situations in which the
cost of games to consumers are often unclear or where
gamers may feel increasingly compelled to make purchases to
retain their position in the game. Some monetization features
have also been likened to a form of ‘gamblification’ of
gaming. Discussed in detail by Macey and Hamari (2022),
this term refers to contexts in which gambling context be-
comes increasingly present in activities. This process can
either occur at an affective level (e.g., gambling is more
normalized or the term is used) or more structurally when
realistic or partially realistic (e.g., chance games for prizes) are
made available in gaming activities. A particularly well pub-
licized example of this are loot boxes (Garea, Drummond,
Sauer, Hall, & Williams, 2021; King & Delfabbro, 2020; King,
Delfabbro, Gainsbury et al., 2019) which are features (e.g.,
treasure chests or card packs) that can be purchased or
earned and which deliver outcomes based on chance-based
algorithms (Drummond & Sauer, 2018; Drummond, Sauer, &
Hall, 2019; Griffiths, 2018; Macey & Hamari, 2022). Loot
boxes have attracted regulatory attention because they appear
to share some features with gambling: the purchase of a stake
in an outcome governed by chance (Derevensky & Griffiths,
2019; Zendle & Cairns, 2018).
Although most research into ‘Pay-to-Play’ (P2P) has
shown that only a minority of gamers purchase loot boxes
and tend to spend only a modest amount (Zendle, Cairns,
Barnett, & McCall, 2020), these features appear to be
attractive to higher risk gamblers. For example, studies
consistently show that those who purchase loot boxes are
more likely to be high intensity gamers (e.g., people who
play 30þ hours per week) who score higher on measures of
Internet Gaming Disorder (Gibson, Griffiths, Calado, &
Harris, 2022; Zendle & Cairns, 2018; Zendle, Meyer, & Over,
2019; Zendle et al., 2020). Purchasers of loot boxes also tend
to score higher on measures of problem gambling (Brooks &
Clark, 2019; Li, Mills, & Nower, 2019) which suggests that
those who engage in other forms of monetary risk-taking
may be more attracted to these features. This gives rise to
concerns that some young people under the age of 18 years
are being exposed to gambling-like content in games, and
that loot boxes might impose an additional source of
financial harm (Carey, Delfabbro, & King, 2021; Delfabbro,
King, & Carey, 2021). The transition from loot boxes to
gambling has been referred to as the “gateway hypothesis”
and gambling to loot boxes as the “reverse gateway hy-
pothesis” (Close et al., 2021; Spicer et al., 2022). Spicer et al.
showed that most people report a transition from gambling
to loot boxes, but that around 20% reported using loot boxes
first before gambling. It is not clear, however, whether this
reported impact of loot boxes on gambling might be
amongst young people who already had an interest in
gambling, but had not yet participated in gambling because
they were under-aged. Delfabbro and King (2020) favored
the view that loot boxes were likely to be attractive to those
who were already interested in gambling and preferred this
style of activity (a ‘selection effect’).
THE RISE OF PAY-TO-EARN (P2E) GAMING
In addition to concerns about the increasing monetary cost
of games, another narrative within the gaming community
has been that gaming, in general, has not been a well-
rewarded activity (De Jesus et al., 2022; Francisco, Rodelas,
& Ubaldo, 2022). Despite the emergence of a growing and
multi-billion-dollar esports industry that benefits a small
elite percentage of gamers, most people who engage in
intensive (and often competitive gaming) usually have little
to show for all their effort. Players may play games for 30 h
per week, earn many in-game assets or solve complex games,
but obtain little tangible compensation. For this reason,
there has been growing interest in the potential merits of so-
called ‘Play-to-Earn’ or P2E games, which could reward
players for their gaming (Jiang & Liu, 2021; Serada, 2020;
Serada, Sihvonen, & Harviainen, 2021). The idea here is that
players might earn tokens or rewards for their game-play as
well as assets which they definitively own and which can be
converted into fiat currency.2 In other words, the model
extends beyond existing largely in-game and within closed
1The cost of micro-transactions can vary. Loot boxes can cost as little as $2,
but access to premium content on some games can entail expenditures of
$20–50.
2A fiat currency is a form of exchange and store of value backed by executive
governments. It is not backed by gold or silver or other independent store
of value.

economy currencies or point systems and assets, to one that
more strongly resembles an open trading market in which
in-game success can translate into real-world financial out-
comes. The concept of P2E games has existed for some time
in the form of the development of virtual in-game currencies
(e.g., Diablo series), the trading of in-game assets for real
world currency (Davidovici-Nora, 2013; Hamari & Leh-
donvirta, 2010), which includes skins-trading that has
enabled players to buy and sell cosmetic features of games
on trading platforms or other third party sites. More
recently, this technology has evolved to encompass block-
chain technology.
OVERVIEW OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that stores trans-
actions or events in a sequence using cryptographic tech-
nology (Ammous, 2018; Narayanan, Bonneau, Felten,
Miller, & Goldfeder, 2016). This event sequence has the
qualities of being largely immutable once the transactions
are recorded, transparent (i.e., they can be viewed ‘on chain’)
and the records of the transactions are usually decentralised
or not stored in a single location. Blockchains use algo-
rithmic or consensus systems to ensure that the sequence of
transactions remains valid (e.g., to avoid the double-
spending problem resolved through the Bitcoin algorithm)
(Casey & Vigna, 2019). This can be achieved using ‘proof of
work’ systems that involve multiple computers trying to
solve complex numerical sequences to ensure that trans-
actions are ordered into sequential blocks that occur in a set
order and interval (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) (Ferdous,
Chowdbury, & Hoque, 2021). Alternatively, there can be
other mechanisms such as ‘proof-of-stake’ consensus which
involve the use of validators (usually parties who have large
holding of governance tokens) to ‘agree’ that each trans-
action is processed validly and fairly in a way that does not
allow any party to game the system or gain unfair advantage
(e.g., Cardano, Solana, Polkadot) (Milunovich, 2022). In
either case, blockchain provides a way of enabling the
development of decentralised finance systems, whereby to-
kens can be created, bought and sold on exchanges, sent peer
to peer, and used to make purchases without the involve-
ment of central organisations such as banks (Casey & Vigna,
2019).3
Blockchain can be used to secure the value and transfer
of currencies or digital assets. Blockchain based currencies
are commonly referred to as ‘crypto-currencies’, although a
distinction is drawn between ‘coins’ produced through
mining and ‘tokens’ issued without this process (Charfed-
dine, Benlagha, & Khediri, 2022). Crypto-currencies are
usually defined by their tokenomics: (a) whether they have a
finite or infinite supply; (b) how many tokens are circulating
at a given time relative to total supply; (c) their market value
per coin; (d) total market capitalization (total coins in cir-
culation 3 current market price) and (e) fully diluted
market cap (current market price 3 total potential market
supply). Blockchain can also be used to validate the
ownership and transfer of other digital assets such as non-
fungible tokens (or NFTs) which can be in-game assets,
artworks, animations, or documents (Nadini et al., 2021).4
The potential benefit to gamers is that blockchain can pro-
vide a system to validate the earnings and assets of gamers.
For example, it gives rise to the possibility that gamers could
own in-game currencies as well as assets in the form of NFTs
that are validated on a blockchain. As with crypto-cur-
rencies, ownership is determined using asymmetric algo-
rithms that create a private code or key that is possessed by
the owner (e.g., in a wallet), but which generates a public key
(in a pair) that is recognized by the blockchain. Only the
person who owns the associated private key in that pair has
access to (and effectively) ‘owns’ the asset or crypto-cur-
rency (Ammous, 2018; Casey & Vigna, 2019).
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO P2E
GAMES
P2E gaming does not necessarily have to use blockchain
technology. However, the above advantages of this tech-
nology have meant that many games are being developed
using leading Layer 1 blockchains,5 which have the scale
(and also the speed) to provide the monetized features that
are desired. In effect, this technology makes it possible for
players to earn a form of currency that could be converted
into fiat currency; to own their own gaming assets; and the
ability to buy and sell gaming assets for currency. One of the
first examples of the use of blockchain-based assets were
VGO skins (Abarbanel & Macey, 2019), whereas the first
popular game to utilize the full functionality of NFTs and
cryptocurrency with P2E benefits was Cryptokitties, an
Ethereum-based game that was popular in 2017–18 (Jiang &
Liu, 2021; Scholten et al., 2019). Cryptokitties involved the
purchase of NFTs (kitties) which were used in competition
between players to earn in-game currency. The game had
only a relatively short period of popularity at around the
peak of the 2017 cryptocurrency “bull-run” of 2017. As Jiang
3Decentralised finance refers to systems based on blockchain and which
allow the transfer of value between different parties based on smart con-
tracts. Earnings can occur in several ways. Examples include: staking
(allowing tokens or coins to be locked into contracts that return interest
in return) or by providing liquidity to markets (people receive a cut of the
transactions fees on the exchange)
4Non-fungible tokens are digital assets which are assigned to blockchains
(minting) so that they can be transferred between parties as based on
public-private key system. They are usually priced in the units of the
crypto-currency on which they are based (the layer 1). Non-fungible means
that they are unique, whereas crypto-currency or any other money is
fungible (no dollar is unique-each can be exchanged for another).
5A layer 1 blockchain is the blockchain that provides the functionality to run
smart contact that power applications based on that blockchain. Examples
include: Ethereum, Solana or Cardano. Smart contracts involve the transfer
of value from one party to another which is recorded on a blockchain
ledger.

and Liu (2021) show using on-chain data from the Ethereum
network, this game declined in popularity because of an
over-supply of players and ‘kitties’ on the market; a decrease
in returns and increasingly disparity between player out-
comes; the increasing NFT entry cost; and, increasing
congestion on the Ethereum network. However, it set the
scene for a model of gaming that brings together the me-
chanics of crypto-currency technology and modern gaming
that is now being replicated on multiple blockchains (e.g.,
Polygon, Solana). A summary of how many emerging
blockchain gaming projects and technology are incorporated
into gaming is provided in Fig. 1. Not all people may engage
with games exactly this way (e.g., people may load in cur-
rency into platforms from hard-wallets: Trezors or Ledgers);
however, the example given should provide readers who are
unfamiliar with crypto-currency processes how gaming
might be undertaken and how this can be integrated with
decentralized finance applications.
As Fig. 1 shows, most people will start the financial
process with a centralized transaction. They will use their
bank or credit card to send money to a centralized crypto-
exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). They would then usually
purchase the principal Layer 1 currency on which the game
is based (e.g., Ethereum, Solana or Harmony are three
leading Layer 1s with popular games). The person would
then usually have to set up a browser or mobile extension
(e.g., Metamask) and configure it to the respective mainnet
(e.g., Harmony) or add a browser wallet (e.g., Phantom for
Solana). Cryptocurrency (e.g., Solana) is then sent from the
central exchange to the decentralised wallet using the target
receipt address. Once it has arrived (for a small fee), the
person then has money to pay for ‘gas fees’ for transactions.
The person may also (in some cases) purchase governance
tokens which provide voting rights in the game (not all
games will have this) and/or they may need to purchase
some amount of the in-game currency to get started. To take
part in the game, they connect their decentralised wallet or
ledger if they want to use a hard wallet. This gives the game
access to the currencies which the person holds. Some games
or gaming ecosystems will have a governance or game token
and in-game utility token (e.g., Defi Land has the DFL token
which can be used to make purchases and which can be
staked for interest and also Goldy which is the “in-game”
currency which is used to make simple in-game trans-
actions). Others (e.g., Synesis One has just the one single
token which fulfils both purposes).
In most of these emerging games, successful participation
involves the purchase of in-game assets (NFTs). These are
usually purchased using the Layer 1 currency (e.g., Solana)
that can be obtained on open markets or via ‘drops’,6 which
usually means that people have to register, be engaged in
various social media groups or sign up processes to be
eligible. Drops are often time limited and highly competitive.
Once these NFTs (the first and valuable ones are termed
‘GEN0 or genesis NFTs) are obtained at a relatively low price
in the drop, they can then be purchased at a much higher
price in marketplaces (e.g., Magic Eden on Solana). Without
these NFTs, it may be difficult to do very well in the game,
so that the small number of people who acquire these assets
early will have a significant advantage over late-comers
(Aguila, Bartolata, & Estrañero, 2022). Even if games are not
fully developed or released, quite vigorous and lucrative
markets can be developed for game NFTs. Examples of this
include Solchicks or Star Atlas on the Solana blockchain.
The value proposition or benefit for players is that, if
they own these NFTs, and engage in the game then they can
receive many potential benefits. These can include: the ca-
pacity to earn in-game currency which can be converted into
fiat currency; the ability to earn additional NFTs; possible
capital gains on the original NFTs; enjoyment and chal-
lenges from playing; and, the kudos of winning competitions
or advancing on leader-boards. Other potential benefits, if
the game is integrated into decentralised finance protocols
(DEFI) is the ability to stake the token rewards for additional
tokens for larger financial gains.
The example of Axie Infinity
So far, only relatively few games have attracted a significant
number of players, so P2E gaming still remains very much in
its infancy. Nevertheless, newer games are emerging with
significantly higher production values, which run on cheaper
and faster blockchains such as Solana and Polygon. Perhaps
the most successful and well-known game so far since
Cryptokitties in 2017 is Axie Infinity (AI with the AXS
token), a tournament game on Ethereum, in which people
match off their NFT ‘creatures’ (or Axies) against others to
win an in-game currency (known as ‘Smooth Love Potion’
or SLP) (Aguila et al., 2022; De Jesus et al., 2022). These
Axies (the NFTs) have to be purchased and the cost has
steadily risen since the game was launched in March of 2018.

a specific advertised time at which this occurs. NFTS often sell out in
minutes.

AXS was one of the most successful crypto projects in 2021
and the price of the token skyrocketed, even during a mid-
year 2021 crash, attracting thousands of new players. Players
reported earning several hundreds of dollars per week and
the project introduced a ‘scholarship system’ which allowed
asset holders (Axie owners) to rent out their Axies to players
elsewhere in the world to play on their behalf (in return for a
cut of the earnings). This shared similarities with the model
used by Cryptokitties which allowed players to rent out their
NFTs to others. Axie Infinity’s (AI) success was generally
longer lived than Cryptokitties and the project achieved a
multi-billion dollar market capitalization based on token
value, but the project has lost a very large proportion of its
players during 2021–22 (De Jesus et al., 2022). This is
because of the over-supply of Axies, the cost of entry,
diminishing returns and also the general loss of retail in-
terest in the crypto-currency market due to the succession of
market downturns in the same period.
UNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS AND RISKS
TO CONSUMERS
The P2E model has the potential to yield a number of
benefits to both consumers as well as the industry. For
consumers, the use of blockchain technology provides an
opportunity for gamers to gain greater ownership over their
digital assets (currency and NFTs); provides a potential
source of revenue; will link more skillful play with valued
game outcomes; and, boost the price of crypto-currencies
associated with the games (both the in-game currencies as
well as that of the Layer 1 on which the game is based).
Revenue from the NFT sales can also be more easily directed
back to artistic creators and avoid some of the issues of
copyright violation and piracy observed before FTP games
were introduced (Davidovici-Nora, 2013). From an industry
perspective, P2E has the potential to increase the price of
crypto-currencies and boost technological development;
allow greater control over the game assets (the NFTs)
through official and authorized trading platforms (i.e., to
avoid the problems of early RMT on third party sites); and,
build ecosystems which enable the best players to benefit
from longer-term investments in the game. However, it is
important to be mindful of the potential risks associated
with P2E and the challenges that will need to be addressed.
There are a number of these and so we have set these out in
several sections.
Tokenomics and inflation
The most insidious and often hidden problem with many
new crypto-currency projects (including many games) is that
the in-game token which is earnt from playing may not retain
its value. When projects are developed, a substantial pro-
portion of the tokens are held by the project founders, the
development team, and private owners (usually venture
capitalists). This can often be 30–40% of all tokens. An
example is Solchicks (Cryptorank, 2022), a high production-
value game under development on Solana. As can be observed
(refer to Fig. 2), only around 37% of the tokens are identified
as being associated with use of the ecosystem (https://
whitepaper.solchicks.io/). A significant proportion is allo-
cated to the developers, advisors and the team, with around
14% given out in private or presale events. Such information
is not usually easily available to the public and often requires
experience in the crypto-markets to know where to look.
Some fortunate public investors can gain access to these
tokens through initial decentralised exchange offerings
(or IDOs) often via ‘launch pads’ (e.g., Seedify, Starlaunch,
Pulsepad). To be eligible for these early offerings, people
usually have to purchase and stake specific launch pad
tokens. Often to get reasonable allocations to purchase
(e.g., $200), investors might need to spend more than
$UK25k worth of launchpad tokens to be part of higher
launchpad ‘tiers’ (readers can find details of one of the most
significant launchpads here https://medium.com/seedify/
the-updated-tier-system-c9652ce5cf5b). All of these parties
receive the tokens at IDO or pre-IDO prices which is
usually many times lower than the price at which the token
is released on the market. Thus, it is not uncommon for
tokens purchased for a few cents (eg. $.05) at IDO to enter
the market for over $1 and then, through market forces,
increase to several dollars thereby yielding the early in-
vestors a 50–300X return on their investment.7 In this way,

the venture capitalists are rewarded for their investment in
the project by being able to sell their tokens at much higher
prices. In many of these projects (and on Solana in partic-
ular) only a very small proportion of tokens are released into
the market initially (e.g., 5–10%). The rest are often subject
to a withholding period or ‘cliff’. Once this passes, then
tokens are unlocked for the early investors in a series of
stages or ‘tranches’ as part of a vesting schedule. As a result,
the supply of the tokens continuously rises over time, usually
just after the main retail market has purchased the tokens
and invested into the game. Retail investors are therefore left
earning and holding a token which inevitably loses value as
more and more of the supply is released (usually over about
2 years). As a result, the rewards from the game are
continuously devalued and those who invested after the IDO
may lose 90% of the value of any tokens purchased.
For example, Fig. 3 shows the price action for Thetan
Arena which had only 27% of total supply in circulation even
by March 2022 (https://doc.thetanarena.com/whitepaper).
The IDO price for this token was $US.08 (https://cryptorank.
io/ico/thetan-gem), but the Coinmarketcap plot for this
project makes it difficult to see any price lower than around
$1.40 (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/thetan-arena/).
At peak, the price reached around $20 per token, but fell to
$1 (a 95% loss of value in a period of less than 3 months).
Some of this was, unquestionably, due to broader market
conditions (the crypto downturn at the same time), but
tokenomics is also likely to have played a role. Figure 4 shows
how the release of tokens increased in the period associated
with the price action and what any potential investors face in
the future. Sites such as https://messari.io/ allow investors to
examine the vesting schedule for project (i.e., how many
tokens will be released over time or the likely inflation), but
this information is not usually available for smaller gaming
or very new projects and has to be observed from white
papers or other sources.
As a result, inexperienced investors are unlikely to be
aware of this type of problem which relates to another
domain of knowledge; namely: the mathematics of invest-
ment and trading. In effect, to avoid experiencing financial
harm, gamers would require knowledge of investment stra-
tegies and trading. Such advice is, however, rarely provided
by social media sites (e.g., YouTube channels) that promote
these tokens, often after the IDO has been completed.
Competition and unsustainable gaming models
Another difficulty with P2E is that game rewards can become
very diluted. If games are potentially profitable, this en-
courages other competitors to enter the market. This means
that it may become increasingly difficult for individual
players to earn an income from the game. For example, in
‘Axie Infinity’ (AI), a significant portion of players’ income is
received through ‘breeding’ Axies and selling them on the AI
marketplace (Aguila et al., 2022). Early investors attracted
the greatest profit, with Axies being sold for an average of
$200 in mid 2021 (De Jesus et al., 2022). However, as the
value of NFTs is often relative to their scarcity, the growth in

popularity of AI resulted increased ‘breeding’ and a surplus
volume of Axies on the market; decreasing the price of this
NFT to an average of $6 USD by mid 2022 (Dowling, 2022).
A similar issue may arise if a very small group of players or a
syndicate of players dominate the game by purchasing the
best NFTs and sharing the game-play. A further complexity
is likely to be the emergence of bots or computerized players
that use methods to play the game continuously and in an
optimized way that is beyond the scope of everyday players.
All of these are potential issues that plagued Cryptokitties,
and will need to be monitored as this form of technology
develops (Jiang & Liu, 2021).
A parallel issue with AI is the games overall lack of long-
term economic viability. Like the majority of P2E models, AI
relies on players financial input/output to regulate the value
of the in-game currency. In other words, the games economy
is influenced by the number of players investing into AI,
relative to the number of tokens being ‘cashed out’. With the
recent steady decline of new players, the game is in a current
state of inflation, with SLP prices dropping from a high of
$0.42 to $0.01 USD as of early 2022 (Aguila et al., 2022).
The rate of inflation and individual returns may only
continue to worsen as the platform struggles to maintain
its current market share and has to compete with the
introduction of newer P2E games and cryptocurrency plat-
forms more broadly. This problem is further exacerbated
by the fact that playing leads to the production of more
and more in-game currency. In other words, players could
become victims of their own success. In effect, the better
people become in the game or the more upgraded and
productive their NFTS, the more in-game currency they will
earn. Without additional use cases or burning of this token,
the price will gradually go down. Issues such as this affected
games such as Axie Infinity, but also the game Townstar, a
popular agricultural game in the Gala Games ecosystem.
Thus, a fundamental challenge for these game ecosystems
will be to find ways to encourage players to spend the in-
game token. Upgrading and buying new game NFTs may
only work for some time. Some ideas may include creating
other collective content which is exclusively available for
those who spend the currency, but which does continue to
earning; access to new content; the ability to rework existing
assets, or access other opportunities such as competitions or
affiliative products and services.
Late-entry risks
A third and related challenge is the fact that those who enter
later into the game may stand very little chance of earning a
good return. For example later-comers may find that the
best quality NFTs are too expensive to purchase and be up
against players who have very developed NFTs and a much
better position in the game (Jiang & Liu, 2021). Such players
may also be faced with a depreciating currency and declining
returns from any attempts to invest the currency into DEFI
protocols operating in conjunction with the game (Annual
Percentage Returns or APRs on yield farming is often very
high initially, but drops as the size of the liquidity pool in-
creases). A final problem is that the popularity of the game
may be short-lived. With so many new games coming onto

the market and the potential advantages to early adopters,
the inflow of people may slow over time thereby leading to
reduced demand for the in-game currency, as seen in Axie
Infinity (Aguila et al., 2022; De Jesus et al., 2022) and
Cryptokitties (Jiang & Liu, 2021). When combined with the
off-loading of currency by earlier investors in the project
and/or the game (who were able to benefit from the higher
market price of the token), this means that late adopters may
be faced with an economy with falling prices and reduced
liquidity to dispose of their tokens. Jiang and Liu (2021)
showed that these problems led to the rapid decline in the
number of players of Cryptokitties, with the many thou-
sands who had entered the game in December 2017 no
longer playing only a few weeks later.
Exploitation
A further risk with these games is the potential for
exploitation. If it is possible for early investors and owners
of NFTs to lend out their assets to others, it is possible that
people (and young people in particular) from developing
nations may be most attracted to scholarship roles. It is
known, for example, that some gaming guild projects target
developing nations as the most likely source of potential
participants (Francisco et al., 2022). For example, Axie
Infinity (AI) has obtained a lot of interest in countries such
as the Philippines because of its potential attractiveness as a
source of income to lower income gamers. As with some
other games that have previously allowed people to play for
in-game assets and sell them on third party sites, concerns
have been raised that P2E games could lead to exploitation
of low paid workers who might be encouraged to engage in
long periods of repetitive gaming (“grinding”) for rewards
which are shared with others. Similarities between this
activity and the process of “gold farming” could potentially
be drawn. “Gold farming” was the term used to describe
gaming operations in countries such as China and various
parts of South-East Asia in which people would work long
hours in factory-like conditions to earn in-game currency
or assets (Dibbell, 2015; Nakamura, 2009; Tai & Hu, 2018;
Woodcock, 2018). An important current development in
crypto-currency/ blockchain market has been the devel-
opment of guilds which enable people to share and rent
assets if they cannot afford the high entry cost required to
purchase some NFTs, but this does raise the possibility
that some of the concerns raised about “gold farming”
could re-emerge in a new form or under a different name.
Unverified reports on the Internet and social media include
accounts of “scholars” having to send nude pictures of
themselves before being signed or being asked to agree
to highly unbalanced deals or “cuts” in revenue earned
(Hackernoon.com).
Extrinsically motivated game-play and grinding
A potential psychological risk associated with highly mone-
tized games is that the motivation for gaming may switch
from intrinsic enjoyment or challenge, to a predominant
focus on the monetary outcome of the activity (extrinsic
motivation) (Mills & Allen, 2020; Peracchia, Presaghi, &
Curcio, 2019). The effects of high extrinsic motivation within
a video-gaming context are well documented, and associated
with greater problem gaming (Mills, Milyavskaya, Heath, &
Derevensky, 2018) poorer self-control and maladaptive
gaming behaviors (Mills & Allen, 2020). Emerging research
indicates these effects may be intensified within a P2E
setting– whilst traditional online games were designed for
enjoyment, the introduction of P2E has caused a shift in
consumer interest (Aguila et al., 2022; De Jesus et al., 2022).
As a result, players report a greater desire for financial in-
centives within monetised gaming, often at the expense of
genuine enjoyment (De Jesus et al., 2022). An additional
consequence of increased extrinsic motivation may be
players engaging in ‘grinding’ behaviours, which involves the
repetitive completion of menial gaming tasks to obtain
additional merit points or in-game currency (Columb,
Griffiths, & O’Gara, 2022; King, Delfabbro, & Griffiths,
2010). Grinding may therefore increase the frequency and
duration of play and create greater risk of harm associated
with excessive gaming. Further, within a monetised gaming
context, grinding may encourage greater purchases of ‘pay-
to-skip’ or other microtransactional content, allowing
tedious game play to be avoided and desired content to be
obtained quicker (Columb et al., 2022; Hamari et al., 2017).
More broadly, the shift towards gaming as a monetary ac-
tivity may not well received by many gamers who already
regard features such as loot boxes as a short-cut to game
progress and an anathema to what should essentially be a
skill-based activity or one based on entertainment (Dar-
akjian, 2015; Macey & Bujic, 2022; Tregel, Schwab, Nguyen,
Müller, & Göbel, 2020).
Attractiveness to riskier players
As research into loot boxes, micro-transactions and cryp-
tocurrency trading has shown, it is possible that these
games may be attractive to people who already have an
interest in higher risk gaming or speculation (Gibson et al.,
2022). One hypothesis is that people who are already highly
invested in gaming and who are willing to spend money on
in-game assets will be more likely to view these new gaming
models as attractive (Delfabbro, King, & Arthur, 2021;
Delfabbro, King, Arthur, & Georgiou, 2021; Li et al., 2019).
Although this might be beneficial to gaming if the adoption
of blockchain validates the ownership or in-game assets
and enables greater financial returns, it may also mean that
those who are tempted to accelerate their game progression
by purchasing loot-boxes might be more inclined to take
similar ‘financial short-cuts’ in P2E gaming. In other words,
such people may be more tempted to spend money (e.g., buy
more NFTs on open markets) rather than earn these
rewards through game-play. The other hypothesis is that
P2E gaming may attract many people who are already
engaged in more speculative trading in the crypto-currency
market. Engagement in crypto-currency trading has an as-
sociation with higher impulsivity and problem gambling, so
that there is a greater likelihood of people with an existing

propensity to take greater risks to be engaged in this form
of gaming. Given that many new gaming projects are likely
to have small market capitalizations (often under $50 m),
the token prices are likely to be much more volatile and
have the potential for greater downside movements if there
are market corrections (although they can also increase
dramatically in price for short periods during bull-markets)
(https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-
market-cap). Investment in what are often called low and
micro-cap projects is generally considered the highest risk
and most speculative form of crypto-currency investment
and is often differentiated from longer-term investment in
Bitcoin, Ethereum and the larger Layer 1 projects with
market caps in the billions. A large market cap (over $10b)
takes more sell pressure to drop or increase the price,
whereas it is much easier for smaller projects (e.g., $50 m) to
experience significant price moments because less money is
required to shift the price. Most gaming projects (see https://
coinmarketcap.com/view/gaming/) have market-caps under
$1USb. Apart from Axie Infinity, there is no standalone game
at the present time with a market capitalization above $US1b.
Many are under $100 m and are considered small projects.
BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONSUMER
PROTECTION
The analysis in this paper has implications for a number
different areas and stakeholders. From a business perspec-
tive, there is a need to ensure that some duty-of-care is
applied when implementing these games to avoid replication
of the issues associated with “gold farming” and general
labor exploitation. An ethical approach will be to maintain
awareness of how the game is being utilized around the
world; to have a clear statement of principles; some sort of
process for registration for guilds using any scholarship or
NFT rental program. There should be reporting mechanisms
that enable the game operator to take action against in-
dividuals who may be engaging in unscrupulous practices
(e.g., disallow rewards or the use of certain NFTs or ad-
dresses) based on confirmed misuse of the technology. In
addition, some minimum rates of return could be set and
potentially some reward structures based on the level of
engagement, rather than just actual rewards (e.g., some
NFTs) to give scholarship players opportunities to elevate
their status in the game.
There is also the need for player/consumer protection,
particularly in relation to education regarding the nature of
the games: the potential risks of excessive gaming; the
tokenomics and potentially inflationary nature of the reward
tokens; the potential factors that may serve to reduce the
benefits for new players over time; and potential strategies
that might be used to mitigate risk. These may include not
buying the gaming token too early, converting any early
gains into USD stable-coin to hedge against future declines
in value; having a time and monetary budget when playing;
and, treating the game more as a play and earn exercise
rather than as a source of income.
More broadly, there is a need to develop a code of
practice or industry regulation to mitigate potential risks.
These involve: greater transparency in the tokenomics and
likely effect on the price of tokens over time; opportunities
for late-comers to gain some benefit from the game (e.g.,
rewards based upon game-play that is not solely influenced
by the possession of expensive NFTs); and, health and safety
information about the potential risks of excessive gaming.
An important element will be to make the activity enjoyable
so that the monetary element of the game is not seen as the
sole motivation for gaming. Genuine rewards should be
obtainable by those who play skillfully and even a small
random element in some reward structures (note: without
the need to pay anything) could create greater equity for
players with different levels of investment in the game.
Game designers might also consider structural features such
as burning tokens or setting maximum supply to reduce the
inflationary nature of reward tokens.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, it seems likely that the growth in P2E games
will continue over the next 2–3 years such that this is likely
to become a market with millions of consumers and
potentially billions invested or staked in the games as well
as the associated NFTs. Such games are also likely to
overlap considerably with developments in the metaverse,
which refers to the development of increasingly realistic
and immersive virtual worlds. For these reasons, it is
important for ongoing and timely academic research to
monitor the uptake and effects of these games. Consumers
are most likely to benefit from information, protections
and regulation that is evidence-based and which involves
a collaboration between developers, gaming platforms,
and the consumer themselves. Future work could examine
the prevalence of this activity and the extent to which its
adoption is best predicted by existing gaming interests
(i.e., does it attract conventional gamers?) or will it be a
vehicle for widening the range of speculative activities
currently undertaken in the crypto-currency market (i.e.,
will it introduce crypto-currency investors into gambling).
There is also a need for further research into the ethics of
the scholarship programs that is inclusive of the experi-
ences of people in countries which are particularly involved
in this activity.
