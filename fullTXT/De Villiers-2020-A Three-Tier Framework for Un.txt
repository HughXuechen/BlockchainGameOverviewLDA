ABSTRACT Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency
has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to
fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has
seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring
its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has
emerged on blockchain’s role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may
be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as
a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain’s potential in electricity. This is
accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three
tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that
could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into
disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature
review is performed on blockchain’s role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier.
The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established
industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action
are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since Satashi Nakamoto’s seminal whitepaper proposing
the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was published in 2008 [1],
blockchain has gained much notoriety [2]. The technology
is most often associated with cryptocurrency, largely due
to the latter’s high-profile agitation of banking and finance.
Cryptocurrency has become a hot topic in investment cir-
cles, as more and more individuals acquire cryptographic
assets [3], such as Ether, Litecoin or the aforementioned
Bitcoin. As increasingly numerous outlets and services begin
accepting cryptocurrencies payment, it has become difficult

to ignore its current and potential impact as an alternative to
fiat currency.
But what is blockchain? The term refers to a ledger of
data which is decentralised, immutable and can be monitored
with no trust from any party involved [2]. Blocks of stored
transactions are strung together using hash chains [4]. When
a new transaction is completed, it is automatically transmitted
to all parties, who then have the option to recognise it (and
thus add it to the accepted canonical ledger) or reject the
contribution. The commonly used proof of work mechanism
has miners solving complex mathematical problems. These
problems are asymmetrical in difficulty i.e. they are difficult
to solve but easy to verify [2]. Thus, the system will add
blocks of transactions as they are successfully verified [4].

Theminer who performed thework of solving these problems
is granted cryptocurrency as a reward for contributing to the
operation of the system. An alternative consensus method is
(delegated) proof of stake. This method, while still largely
experimental, does not rely on computing power. Rather it
makes use of the idea of ownership within the network [4],
using a game theory system. Users who own more of the
cryptocurrency or who have a better reputation thus have
more voting power. In terms of applications of these methods,
Bitcoin and most other blockchains, use the proof-of-work
system.
The next major evolution in the blockchain space came in
the form of smart contracts. These were first conceptually
proposed by Nick Szabo in 1997 [5] as immutable scripts that
execute automatically under specific circumstances, without
any third party involvement [6]. The first and most notable
platform for actually implanting smart contracts comes in
the form of Ethereum, a next-generation blockchain [7] that
functions as a Turing-complete world computer [8]. Smart
contracts on the Ethereum blockchain process cryptographic
assets strictly according to pre-defined rules. The aptness of
the execution of these smart contracts is verified using similar
principles that govern the verification of Bitcoin transactions.
For this reason, the execution of a smart contract cannot be
impeded or interfered with by any party.
Blockchain now has potential beyond merely being a
decentralised database, potentially acting as a tool for new
business systems, models and applications. Smart contracts
allow cryptographic wealth to be transferred and handled
according to prestated conditions, creating a paralegal space
where ‘‘code is law’’. They also potentially present a new and
exotic method of mediating relationships between people,
organisations and governments. Therefore, any trust-based
industry may be seriously affected by an uptake in their
use. Smart contracts may take over finance handling from
banks [9]. The services of notaries and lawyers could be
largely automated [10], with blockchain-based trust and reg-
ulation mechanisms coming to the forefront. While this may
all be conceptually true, there has been very little implemen-
tation in reality. None of the many Ethereum-based dapps
(decentralised apps) have seen significant uptake, and may
still be deemed novelties.1 For instance, the MakerDAO,
the most popular Ethereum dapp at the time of writing has
just over 2400 users [11], and can thus hardly be considered
mainstream.
Various sectors are considering adopting blockchain
in some form or another [12], [13]. This interest is
likely due to various unique features, including its secu-
rity, stability and decentralised nature [13]. For instance,
the online gambling industry has, to some extent, embraced
the technology [14], [15], using cryptocurrency as a pay-
ment layer, as well as making use of the secure ledgers
for information exchange. The insurance sector has also
explored blockchain usage as a secure public store for client

assets [16], while the real estate industry is considering stor-
ing land titles in a similar manner [17]. The field of logistics
and supply chain management is undergoing a more notable
transformation due to its adoption of blockchain [18], largely
as a tracking database. This novel technology allows for
simplified transparent tracking by using a public blockchain
as a ledger. Blockchain is also being used as a tool for tracking
ownership of copyright and other intellectual property [19].
Recent times have seen also an increase in research propos-
ing blockchain as a potential tool for the energy indus-
try [20], [21]. Proposed energy related blockchain-based
ideas range from the straightforward, such as crytpocur-
rency rewards for renewable generation [22], to the more
exotic, such as restructured autonomous finance mechanisms
for renewable energy projects [23]. There has, however,
been very little real-world blockchain usage in the current
state of the electrical energy sector. Due to an enthusi-
asm around the concept, and with much media attention,
blockchain has become a ‘‘buzzword’’ within the technology
sector [12], [24]. Thus, there may be a confusion and hes-
itance concerning its value in the electricity industry. Fur-
thermore, it is unclear if, when, and how the rising tide of
blockchain will affect the electricity industry. Many concepts
are either in a purely conceptual stage or have only been
embraced in a limited manner. All this uncertainty may lead
to confusion for engineering management who are seeking to
use the technology to add value to their specific sector.
The use of smart contracts to mediate relationships in the
electricity sector has also been suggested, such as in [25],
where they are used for price negotiation and automatic
settlement and payment after use. As this paper attempts to
examine, the traditional centralised structure of the energy
industry (in terms of ownership, physical structure and gov-
ernance), with limited interaction and data-flow, could poten-
tially be upturned by the introduction of blockchain and smart
contracts (at least according to some exuberant commen-
tary). Involved parties may all be given a voice in a future
energy supply structure [26]. This could result in a new
form of shared governance, spreading responsibility across
all involved. That is to say, important decisions regarding,
for instance, grid expansion, operation and generation tech-
nology make-up, could be made collectively by all energy
consumers and producers. The general energy consuming
public may thus become stakeholders in large-scale gener-
ation. Thus, blockchain technology may have the potential to
disrupt the purchase and supply of electricity at all points in
the value chain. If and how these exotic concepts are to gain
public acceptance remains to be seen.
This paper sets out to answer the question ‘Can we
examine the history and methodology of technological
disruption, in conjunction with a comprehensive litera-
ture review, to predict the outcomes and implications of
blockchain’s growing influence in the electricity indus-
try?’ This work thus also attempts to serve as a guide
for management personnel and strategic decision-makers
wishing to make sense of blockchain’s role in the energy

sector, as well as those who are understandably sceptical.
In Section II a novel taxonomy of blockchain is formulated,
ranging from superficial impacts to complete industry disrup-
tion. This exists across three tiers, the defining characteris-
tics of which are expanded on in Section II. The taxonomy
attempts to describe the general steps of disruption of industry
by blockchain. Blockchain technology’s use in the energy
industry specifically is then examined in a general literature
review in Section III through this lens. Existing and hypo-
thetical applications of blockchain technology are sorted by
the three tiers. The Disruptive Technology tier includes some
conjecture by the authors, such as a fully blockchain-based
energy supply system that has not been discussed in depth
thus far in the existing literature. The authors also provide
some thoughts on proposed ideas and their future trajecto-
ries, including real world suitability and the likelihood of
mainstream uptake. Any implications of adopting blockchain
technology are also discussed. The section concludes with
a speculative summary of the most likely outcomes for
blockchain’s role in the energy industry. These ideas are
examined through the lens of the above-mentioned novel
taxonomy.
II. METHODOLOGY
This section describes a novel methodology for conducting
a literature review of the extant proposals for blockchain
use in the electricity industry. The guiding principle for this
literature review is the classification of ideas according to
the depth of disruption they portend for the industry. This is
to provide industry management and decision makers with
a ‘‘funnel’’ of potential future industry trajectories. Three
identified tiers make up a blockchain taxonomy consisting of
a spectrum from sustaining technology to deep potential dis-
ruption of the established sector. These tiers are formulated to
evaluate the potential effects an idea may have on its relevant
industry, thus serving as a guide for the literature review. They
are informed by the range of blockchain philosophies and
conceptualisations, from benign database to radical liberating
technology.
A. TAXONOMY FORMULATION
When examining the exact process of how a technology
disrupts an industry, literature can be traced back as far as
Diffusion of Innovations, a book first published in 1962 [27].
In this book author Everett Rogers theorises about the spread
and adoption of an innovative idea. Rogers’ theory puts
emphasis on four elements that affect the uptake of an
idea, namely the validity of idea itself, the means of com-
municating the idea, the passage of time and the prevail-
ing social systems [27]. These are streamlined into five
stages [27]:
• Knowledge.
• Persuasion.
• Decision.
• Implementation.
• Confirmation.
Rogers’ system served as partial inspiration to the Four
Stages of Disruption formulated by Steven Sinofsky of
venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (notable for their
sizeable investments in blockchain concepts, such as Coin-
base, Ripple and OpenBazaar, amongst others). However,
Sinofsky argues that Rogers’ stages of diffusion struggle
to fully characterise disruptive technology [28], something
perhaps difficult to predict in the 1960s.
‘‘A central question to disruption is whether it is inevitable
or preventable. History would tend toward inevitable, but an
engineer’s optimism might describe the disruption that a new
technology can bring more as a problem to be solved.’’
- Steven Sinofsky, Andreessen Horowitz [28]
Sinofsky’s four tiers of disruption are as follows [28]:
• Disruption of incumbent.
• Rapid linear evolution.
• Appealing convergence.
• Total re-imagining.
These tiers are loosely based on Elisabeth Küblerr-Ross’
classical five stages of grieving (denial, anger, bargaining,
depression and acceptance) [29], taken from the viewpoint
of the incumbent i.e. the ‘‘disruptee’’.
Richard Adler, of international think tank Aspen Institute
authored a piece with another view on technology disruption
in [30]. A chapter in this report titled The Taxonomy of Dis-
ruption proposes two broad categories, the first of which is
disrupting the scale of operations [30]. This category claims
that disruption can occur by either increasing fragmentation
of an industry, or by increasing concentration of an industry.
The second type of classification is disrupting ways of con-
necting with others [30]. This is split into two concepts again,
namely redefining relationships and accelerating learning.
The novel taxonomy proposed in this paper attempts to
focus on blockchain technology’s very specific path of dis-
ruption, so the concepts above by Rogers and Sinofsky are
perhaps too broad. The Aspen Institute’s method closes in
on the intended target, but is again too general. Kilkki et. al
construct a more specific layered framework for disruption
and the interactions involved [31]. A brief summary of their
complex model is as below [31]:
New theory→ New technology→ Technology acquires
patents → Technology results in value generation model
→ Industry architecture changes→ Consumer behavioural
changes.
The eventual outcome has implications for society and
authorities, even resulting in new laws and regulations [31].
Closing in on blockchain and smart contracts as specific
subject matter, Wang et. al hypothesise on future smart con-
tract developments in three steps as below [32]:
• Formal verification.
• Layer two.
• Smart contract driven parallel organisation and societal
management.
The first category focuses on applying proof that a smart
contract can fulfil its formal specification. The second
65672 VOLUME 8, 2020
A. de Villiers, P. Cuffe: Three-Tier Framework for Understanding Disruption Trajectories for Blockchain
category covers the rise of a smart contract based ecosystem
acting as a consensus mechanism for the transition of states
and token payment. Wang et. al’s final category is smart con-
tract driven parallel organisation and societal management
i.e. governance mechanisms [32]. Similarly, Lu et. al, in their
study on blockchain’s use in the oil and gas industry, divide
up the use of the technology into three main categories [33]2:
• Trading.
• Management/decision-making.
• Supervision.
On a slightly different tangent, Bryan Smith of
Coin Insider arranges blockchain technology into three
generations [7].
• Generation 1: Cryptocurrency, store of value, transfer of
value between peers without a central authority.
• Generation 2: Smart contracts and associated mecha-
nisms, management of digital assets (inspired largely by
the Ethereum project).
• Generation 3: Future developments.
In the formulation of this paper’s taxonomy, the authors
settled on a three tier structure, as opposed to the sources
above which use four, five or more categories. The first
tier attempts to condense some of the ideas above, such
as Sinofsky’s disruption of incumbent and Adler’s scale of
operations disruption. Kilkki et. al’s steps up to and includ-
ing their value generation model, are considered here. The
final, and most pervasive idea is taken from Smith’s first
generation of blockchain. The first tier is thus established
as using blockchain for commodities and transactions. This
tier is discussed in Section II-B1. This level of blockchain
penetration is likely to have no more than minor effects on
industry, and can be likened to natural technological advance
i.e. sustaining technologies.
The intermediate tier of disruption is equated to
Smith’s second generation of blockchain. The first three
stages of Sinofsky’s disruption model are condensed here,
with communication being the primary quality. Killki et. al’s
industry architecture is relevant to some degree, but perhaps
not on a major scale. Lu et. al’s first two categories are
considered, as trading and management mechanisms are the
primary focus of smart contract usage thus far. Adler’s sec-
ond category sub-classification of redefining relationships
is also applicable. All these ideas considered, the second
proposed tier considers derivatives and ecosystems i.e. smart
contract ecosystems with associated mechanisms for trading,
communication, management etc. Smart contracts act as an
automated treasurer in asset handling. This is expanded on
in Section II-B2. Wang et. al’s idea of societal manage-
ment/governance mechanisms are perhaps the most accurate
summary of the proposed second tier. This tier could result
in significant disruption for an industry, but not cause a total
shift in structure and operation.
The third tier of disruption tends towards more exotic
concepts. This is inspired by Sinofsky’s final category of
2Lu et. al include another category focusing on cybersecurity, which is not
relevant to the present study.
complete re-imagining, as well as Lu et. al’s third blockchain
category of supervision methods. Kilkki et. al describe
the logical final conclusion as implications for society and
authorities. The primary focus of the third tier of the proposed
blockchain taxonomy is thus established as ownership struc-
tures and governance, as expanded on in II-B3. This level of
industry disruption by a blockchain is likely to have severe
impacts on an industry, thus the designation as Disruptive
Technology.
B. TAXONOMY STRUCTURE
This section expands on each of the tiers of blockchain dis-
ruption, exploring the typical attributes and examples within
each category. The tiers are summarised in Table 1. This table
includes the defining characteristics of each of the tiers, and
attempts to visually demonstrate their operational structures.
1) TIER 1: SUSTAINING TECHNOLOGY
Subject matter grouped within this tier consists of technolo-
gies and ideas that, if adopted, would allow existing indus-
tries to continue with their current business model. These
technologies are generally complimentary within the current
paradigm, and manifest as additional layers to industry work-
ings. No governmental permission or regulatory changes are
required. A company embracing this technology may have
a small team assigned to overseeing implementations and
relevant operations.
Thus, tier one requires minor or no physical infrastructure
change and largely piggybacks off of existing systems. There
is little involvement by utilities or governing bodies. Adding a
cryptocurrency payment layer requires only digital and some
administrative changes. This tier can be compared to gener-
ation 1 of blockchain technology, such as Bitcoin, which is
mainly focused on the store and transfer of value [7].
2) TIER 2: EVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY
Ideas grouped in this tier generally would require some
form of restructuring of businesses within an industry. These
are concepts that would, to some extent, replace currently
accepted mechanisms if adopted. If a company were to utilise
this technology, theymight require a full department to imple-
ment and oversee its development and application. Some reg-
ulatory changes will likely be necessary, but authorities and
governing bodies will not be severely impacted. Emphasis is
on implementation of new and novel ecosystems, as in [7].
Advanced mechanisms of derivatives are also examined.
3) TIER 3: DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
This section examines the deepest tier of disruption. Most
concepts within this tier require a significant overhaul of
industry/sector workings. Emphasis is placed on the potential
governance and ownership aspects of blockchain i.e. radical
new ways of structuring para-legal relationships between
entities. This section for categories based on a what could
be case, as there are very few real-world applications thus
far i.e. a futurist outlook. Thus, this tier encapsulates a full

societal embrace of blockchain, accompanied by a host of
radical changes.
III. GUIDED LITERATURE REVIEW
This section uses the blockchain disruption taxonomy of
Section II to conduct a structured literature review of the
electricity sector to provide a guide for the perplexed.
The taxonomy also allows the authors some conjecture. Con-
cepts based on similar or related ideas are grouped into the
various subsections below using the three tiers. Relation-
ships, similarities and differences between these underlying
ideas are explored and commented on. Table 2 groups and
summarises the examined concepts by the three tiers of dis-
ruption established before. This table includes the defining

characteristics of each of the tiers in the electricity sector,
and attempts to visually represent their operational structures.
Citations for the various sources examined are also grouped
by their approximate tier. The table’s third tier (Disruptive
Technology) also includes citations, but these are for publi-
cations on which the more abstract ideas (such as those in
Section II-B3) are based.
This section serves as a guided tour through the exist-
ing ideas for electrical energy engineering management and
decision makers interested in blockchain as potential tool for
their industry. A recent comprehensive literature review on
blockchain-related activities and initiatives in the electricity
sector has been performed by Andoni et. al [35] and this
publication is referred to often in the present paper. The
concepts and ideas discussed in their piece are examined
through the lens of the taxonomy developed in Section II.
A. SUSTAINING TECHNOLOGY
This taxonomic level is proposed to capture ideas that will
have minimal effect on existing industries as a whole. These
are generally concepts that work as complimentary services.
No or little additional physical infrastructure is required, such
as smart meters, processing equipment, Internet of Things
(IoT) enabled devices etc. That is to say, these concepts
will usually piggyback on existing infrastructure and indus-
try paradigms, with no direct involvement from the existing
regulating bodies. Therefore, implications for the electrical
energy industry will be minimal at most.
The primary focus of this tier is on commodities and trans-
actions. Cryptocurrency is the simplest application, serving
to facilitate the store and transfer of funds. As a payment
layer alone it is likely to have only a minor impact on an
industry, especially if existing coins are used, rather than
minting an application-specific coin. Advantages are the
same as any case where cryptocurrency is used over fiat cur-
rency [36]. Distributed ledger technology, however, provides
a secure and transparent method of asset management [16],
and acts as a secure public database for keeping track of
ownership.
Tokenisation is a major theme in this tier. This is the
process whereby a physical product or asset is represented
cryptographically, and can thus easily be traded, transferred,
stored or analysed. The concept is expanded on, and the exact
process of energy tokenisation is explained in III-B1.
VOLUME 8, 2020 65675
A. de Villiers, P. Cuffe: Three-Tier Framework for Understanding Disruption Trajectories for Blockchain
1) CRYTPOCURRENCY AS PAYMENT LAYER
The simplest blockchain-based application in the energy sec-
tor consists of allowing energy purchase with cryptocurrency
as payment layer. Established cryptocurrencies have been
gaining ground as a new method of electronic payment [37].
Services such as Living Room of Satoshi, Enercity [35] and
other gateways make payment of electricity bills with cryp-
tocurrency possible, serving as proof of concept. These busi-
nesses usually accept cryptocurrency and pay electricity bills
on behalf of clients using fiat currency. However, a number
of energy utilities, such as Dutch energy provider BAS [35],
have begun accepting Bitcoin directly, without a mediator.
Another related application consists of rewarding producers
of home generation with special cryptocurrencies. Once a
producer has registered for the program, they can verify their
production and receive cryptocurrency in return. Verification
can be done by manually submitting meter readings [22],
or automatically by internet-enabled smart meter if the pro-
ducer has invested in this. It should be noted that this process
may be subject to the Oracle problem [38], as it relies on trust-
worthy access to off-chain data. Reward can take the form of
a pre-existing coin such as Bitcoin in the case of [39], or an
application-specific coin such as Solarcoin [22]. A potential
producer may be incentivised to invest in generation assets
(such as home-scale PV or wind) if they could receive cryp-
tocurrency reward for their production. This could be a more
attractive option than simply receiving a small credit on their
bill from the utility operator when exports are measured.
A proof of concept exists in [22]. Another related exam-
ple attaches the value of a cryptocurrency to a weighted
aggregate of renewable energy markets [40]. Utility operators
could provide reward for assisting with grid stability, such
as supplying reactive power, load shifting for demand side
management and providing a ‘‘clean’’ waveform with low
harmonic content.
For electricity wholesalers, cryptocurrency billing may
be a potential method of streamlining the payment pro-
cess, by switching over to a purely digital system
(i.e. without any relationship to fiat currency). It may
also present a simple method of rewarding feed-in gen-
eration. If the company is unwilling to engage in the
admittedly tumultuous sector of traditional cryptocurrency
value fluctuation, they may consider adopting an existing
stablecoin instead, such as DAI [41], Libra or Digix Gold
Tokens.
In these examples no tokenisation of energy takes place
(defined in Section III-B1) and a smart meter is not necessar-
ily required. In regards to potential implications for the adop-
tion of these technologies, utilities would only be involved on
a minor scale, agreeing to accept cryptocurrency as payment.
Metering would be adequate in its existing common ‘‘dumb’’
form. In the authors’ opinion, these concepts are likely to
becomemore commonplace in the coming years, but unlikely
to create major disruption within the industry as a whole on
their own.
2) BLOCKCHAIN NOTARISATION
Distributed ledger technology can serve as an immutable
digital notarisation; the time [42], date and contents of a trans-
action cannot be changed once added to the blockchain [10]
and is visible to all. Thus, blockchain contents cannot be
refuted due to the associated timestamps. This has been pro-
posed as a tool to keep track of renewable energy credits [43]
and carbon credits [44]. Furthermore, it can be used to keep
track of ownership of generation equipment and electrical
infrastructure, especially in shared ownership schemes, such
as those discussed in Section III-C1. Records for Company
A’s carbon emissions may be stored on a blockchain by a
trusted service, making it possible for regulators to track
emission performance. It may also allow for simplified car-
bon credit trading; Company B may purchase some number
of A’s carbon credits, perhaps with cryptocurrency. In another
example, a wind farm company could keep a list of their assets
on the blockchain, making ownership records transparent.
Fraudulent behaviour could be decreased in this way. The
notarisation aspect and its use in the energy sector are primary
characteristics of the Sustaining Technology tier, as own-
ership and commodity tracking are the focus. Blockchain’s
usage as a notarisation tool seems likely to become common-
place in the coming years. As before, this is unlikely to have
major industrial implications, serving rather as an additional
tool for existing systems.
B. EVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY
This tier serves to categorise ideas that may cause signif-
icant electricity industry disruption. The primary focus is
on derivatives, implemented within a smart contract-based
ecosystem. Smart contracts allow for new approaches to
multi-party, derivative and complex transactions [6]. Resid-
ing on the blockchain, they can be accessed by any party,
thus making their workings fully transparent [45]. They also
allow for some level of autonomous operation and can be used
to disintermediate current operations. Exchanges with users
can be handled automatically, with assets being received and
distributed according to a predefined set of rules [46]. Smart
contracts can thus make for exotic trading arrangements that
facilitate the emergence of an ecosystem. Groups of smart
contracts can be used to form Decentralised Autonomous
Organisations (DAOs). A DAO functions like a virtual medi-
ator, enforcing and executing specific rules and actions [42],
accomplished without human management or directors [47].
This allows for a new take on finance, similar to online
crowd-sourcing models, such as Kickstarter [48], but without
any trusted intermediate service.
Considering the above, some form of infrastructure change
is required for ideas within the Evolutionary Technology tier,
most likely IoT enabled devices that can communicate with
the relevant blockchain. With smart contracts taking on a
more prevalent role, there may be some regulatory/legislature
change required to accommodate this [49]. This is likely
to mean that existing regulators play some role e.g. banks
65676 VOLUME 8, 2020
A. de Villiers, P. Cuffe: Three-Tier Framework for Understanding Disruption Trajectories for Blockchain
recognising cryptocurrency’s associated fiat currency value,
notarisation that legally accepts blockchain timestamps as
legitimate.
Within this tier of disruption, the traditional top-down
structure of electricity supply is disrupted. That is to say,
decentralised generation is encouraged and becomes more
commonplace, eventually competing with grid-scale genera-
tion. Therefore, utility roles may be reduced if these technolo-
gies are embraced. This is expanded on in Section III-B2.
1) PEER-to-PEER ELECTRICITY TRADE
Of the existing industry literature, a majority examines
blockchain’s role in enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity
trading on a local scale [35]. The P2P paradigm allows for
the exchange of generated energy between involved parties,
at least in a financial sense [50], [51]. No longer in a purely
passive consumer role, these parties now act as prosumers
(proactive consumers), who perform intelligent management
and/or generation [52], [53]. This could disintermediate
utilities.
P2P trading schemes usually make use of energy tokenisa-
tion in some form. In data science, tokenisation is defined
as the method of replacing sensitive, complex data with
non-sensitive simple values, while storing actual values in a
secure ledger [54]. Thus, in the case of energy tokenisation,
a token is created for every unit of energy generated, a concept
proven in [40]. The value of a token will typically be attached
to a specified energy value e.g. one token represents one
kW.h or kW.min of electrical energy. Different to the data
science definition of tokenisation above, the physical energy
is not necessarily bound to a specific token, except in the case
where storage of some kind can be implemented. Tokenisa-
tion allows energy to become tangible as a commodity, thus
falling within the Sustaining Technology tier.
Suppose an individual or business, hereafter referred to as
Prosumer Awishes to trade energy on a P2P network. A smart
meter is installed at the premises. This device must have some
means of communication with the necessary blockchain, and
would typically be IoT-enabled in some measure. A good
example is that developed by Pylon Network [35], [55]. If the
premises has a form of generating equipment (e.g. PV array,
small wind generator), this might typically be required to be
sub-metered. When Prosumer A generates, say, one kW.min
of electricity from their home system for export, the meter
registers this and an energy token Tok1 is added to the
blockchain under A’s unique ownership ID (e.g. private key).
Prosumer B, who wishes to purchase this energy, sends a unit
of cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin, Litecoin, or a stablecoin such
as Tether) at a predetermined price. This price could be a
fixed rate at an agreed tariff, or use some form of automated
auctioning mechanism as in [56] or [57]. Tok1 is transferred
to Prosumer B’s unique ID. When Prosumer B consumes this
energy, their smart meter communicates with the blockchain,
and the specific energy token is dissolved.
It is worth considering the Oracle problem [38]: the meter
and underlying smart contract mechanism trust the input
received to make decisions. Thus, if the meter is tampered
with, it is theoretically possible to purchase or sell fraudu-
lently. The blockchain is only as good as its input. There-
fore, some form of monitoring authority may be required to
perform routine checks, in the same manner as electricity
providers currently do. A number of the examples covered
in this subsection combine tokenisation with smart contracts,
thus tend towards the Evolutionary Technology tier classifi-
cation.
In the P2P case, the decentralised nature of a blockchain-
based environment allows for a trust-free energy market
without a central mediator [20] (besides the trust put in the
operation of the smart meter and the electrical installer).
The dynamic nature of such a market allows for real-time
distributed decisions [50], such as reacting to demand or fluc-
tuating renewable generation. A P2P energy trading system
has been successfully implemented on a microgrid level [58].
A proof of concept and working example of such a P2P
energy trading case is the Brooklyn Microgrid, operated
by LO3 Energy in New York [59]. Involved parties were
found to save significantly on their electricity bill, especially
those who contributed generation to the marketplace [60].
The project has seen considerable success, such that an
addition project has been implemented on a larger scale in
Vermont [61]. A similar scheme exists in Australia [62].
Although energy exchange is usually limited to the geograph-
ical area, P2P energy trade can potentially help satisfy local
energy demands. Transfer losses can be decreased in this
manner [63], as local consumers can be given preference to
encourage grid balancing.
FIGURE 1. Visual representation of a smart contract-based peer-to-Peer
energy trading environment.
The P2P concept is expanded further, with proposals for
exchanges on an even smaller scale, in the form of machine-
to-machine electricity trade [64], or between electric vehicles
and the grid. A partial or total P2P ecosystem, as described
above, would make extensive use of smart contracts for
semi-autonomous operation without human mediation, and
thus fits within the Evolutionary Technology tier, although
completely reliant on energy tokenisation as in the Sustaining
Technology tier. Such an ecosystem is demonstrated visually
in Figure 1. Most would require some form of smart metering
with a means of communicating with the blockchain. P2P
ecosystems may also employ smart contracts to implement
derivatives, hedging and insurance mechanisms, with these
VOLUME 8, 2020 65677
A. de Villiers, P. Cuffe: Three-Tier Framework for Understanding Disruption Trajectories for Blockchain
smart contracts autonomously tracking assets, facilitating
value transfer and distributing funds. This is similar to the
workings of [41]. The energy industry is likely to undergo
only minor changes at first, unless a pure P2P platform is
established. The latter scenario may take years to implement,
if at all.
Large scale energy providers should investigate blockchain
as platform for energy exchanges, to easily integrate into any
future P2P-based platforms. The role of electricity whole-
salers may be reduced by a significant measure, so energy
providers could remove them as an intermediary by selling
directly. Developers of lifestyle villages and housing com-
plexes may be interested in implementing some form of
P2P system. Alternatively, the tokenisation process poten-
tially presents an accurate and secure metering method for
grid operators and electricity wholesalers.
2) TOKENISED ENERGY ADVANCED CONCEPTS
This section examines some possible advanced concepts
and derivatives that are possible in a blockchain-based P2P
tokenised electricity trading environment.
An advantage of the tokenised energy utilised by
blockchain-based methods is the associated metadata. Meta-
data specific to the particular energy quantum is generated
and included during the tokenisation process, and is poten-
tially visible to all involved parties on the blockchain’s dis-
tributed ledger. This attribute allows each token to include
additional details of the unit of energy it represents, stored
within the block of transactions, or as a second-layer meta-
coin [65]. The nature of generation (e.g. wind, solar, fossil
fuel) can be attached to each token [66], as well as some
form of geotag. If a consumer wishes to exclusively purchase
energy produced from local or renewable sources they may
do so, perhaps at a premium.
Thus, energy tokenisation allows guarantee of origin [66],
which could underpin schemes whereby a consumer would
pay a tariff based on their geographic grid distance from the
producer. Likewise, the time of generation can be included
for the specific token. This can be used to lock the unit of
energy to a specific time-of-use period, which could discour-
age hoarding for use during peak periods, minimising the risk
of grid imbalance. Furthermore, a demurrage mechanism,
which diminishes the redemptive energy value of a token over
time, is possible, as in [57]. Producers and consumers are
thus incentivised to act fast, implicitly creating a time of use-
style demand responsemechanism. This tightens the coupling
between physical energy use and the associated financial
abstraction. This may allow for some form of electricity
supply chain management.
In an unrestricted peer-to-Peer energy trade environment,
some parties could find themselves effectively independent of
utility-scale generation and electricity wholesale companies.
They would thus only pay some form of network access fee,
perhaps a flat rate, to the network operator, andwould have no
enduring contractual relationship with any electricity supply
company.
Notwithstanding the above, the fiat currency-based tradi-
tional energy sales model is likely to continue to serve as
the average consumer’s purchase method. Partial disruption
is achieved at this level without any major implications for
electricity wholesalers.
The methodology behind P2P energy trading can be
extended to Electric Vehicles (EVs). The standard model
for EV charging typically involves a home charging point
or a paid public charging point. IoT-enabled vehicles are
becoming an oft-discussed topic, especially in the case of
bi-directional energy trade between EVs and/or the grid [67].
Blockchain has been suggested as a possible tool in this pro-
cess, by facilitating advanced energy trade mechanisms [63],
[68]–[70]. The methodology largely mirrors the P2P energy
trading described above. EVs, when connected, can auto-
matically and anonymously trade with nearby parties using
smart contracts-based mechanisms, potentially easing grid
congestion [70]. The vehicle may temporarily act as a local
generator, if it is established to have excess energy stored.
Furthermore, blockchain technology could enable shared EV
charging from a single charging station, thus minimising
charge port anxiety for users [71]. EV charging infrastructure
designers may want to consider the above for projects in the
near future, but are some time from any of these concepts
being realised in a significant capacity. Those in the field of
IoT-enabled vehicles could potentially benefit greatly from
blockchain-based methods, however an adequate P2P based
ecosystem will need to be implemented first. With many of
the above concepts still needing to be proven, EV charg-
ing providers will have to be convinced to adopt the P2P
technology before any major changes occur. They will likely
continue to profit from the use of their installed infrastructure.
3) GRID-SCALE DISRUPTION
This tour of blockchain in electricity is now reaching the
fringes of the Evolutionary Technology tier and is heading
toward the Disruptive Technology tier, as attention shifts
towards governance concepts.
A grid operator of some kind will always be required to
install and maintain transmission and distribution infrastruc-
ture. This scenario is unlikely to be decentralised in any way,
due to the skilled labour and informed planning required.
However, the grid operator could be collaboratively owned.
Parties could invest cryptocurrency into DAO to gain shares
in the grid operator company. Stakeholders could earn a
pro-rata share in the grid operating company’s revenue as
in the concepts mentioned in Section II-B2. The company
would function along the lines of a non-profit organisation,
with earnings being reinvested into grid maintenance and
expansion. If automatic P2P trading becomes ubiquitous,
commercial Megawatt-scale producers could sell exclusively
on the blockchain, as mentioned before. Their role may be
reduced, as distributed home-scale generation will have a
higher level of penetration at this point. Furthermore, large
scale generators may exist in some form of collaborative
ownership, similar to the concept discussed in Section III-C2.

C. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
Blockchain as a tool for governance and exotic ownership
models is a fairly new idea, but is being investigated by a
number of researchers and institutions. The general concept is
that controlling decisions can be made via blockchain-based
votingmechanisms [42] and could be extended to all involved
parties. As before, a large amount of human involvement
can be removed: what better manager/representative than
a (theoretically) purely democratic and incorruptable digital
one [72]? A simple application is a secure and transparent
voting mechanism [73]. Voting would be performed on the
blockchain, making it secure and less vulnerable to tampering
or voter fraud [74]. A public blockchain would also allow
voting records to be completely transparent, but voters would
retain their anonymity behind their unique public keys.
FIGURE 2. Examples of digital ballots that may be used in blockchain
governance.
The next step involves automatically implementing and
acting on policies. Management operations could largely
be performed by smart contracts, in combination with the
voting mechanisms above. Figure 2 shows two examples
of digital ballots that may be used in the proposed system.
Dues are automatically enforced with groups of interact-
ing smart contracts [45], [73]. It has even been argued that
blockchain-based governance could be extended to the point
of replacing the state altogether [75], but this is unlikely
to see large-scale adoption soon, as it may be difficult to
practically enforce obligations and act on breaches in con-
tracts and dues. An interesting example within this tier is the
Ethereum-based entity MakerDAO and its associated stable-
coin DAI, which maintains a tight pegging to the US dollar
using decentralised incentive structures. The core mechanism
by which DAI maintains its pegging is by users locking
assets into smart contract collateralised debt positions [41] to
underpin the issuance of new DAI tokens. This mechanism,
and other decentralised and anonymous governance struc-
tures, gives the DAI token a functional and stable monetary
policy without any kind of central bank or other controlling
entity. In the event that these mechanisms are implemented
and generally embraced policy-makers and authorities in the
electricity industry will be majorly impacted, as their roles
will essentially be automated and/or made a product of group
consensus.
A blockchain-based voting/governance system could make
industries more democratic; representatives would be elected
directly by stakeholders as a part of a non-hierarchical
model [73]. This method could benefit from advanced voting
concepts, such as quadratic voting [76] or liquid democ-
racy [77] (wherein individuals would have the option to elect
specialist representatives within their various social circles).
Thus, public participation is made possible within the energy
industry.
1) EXOTIC OWNERSHIP MODELS
Once P2P energy trade has become more commonplace
between prosumers, there are a number of interestingDisrup-
tive Technology tier concepts, such as Virtual Power Plants,
that can be implemented. Despite an increase in distributed
generation capacity from prosumers, its impact on the grid
as a whole is still relatively minor. This lack of effect may
be due to a number of factors, such as difficulty in com-
munication, volatility of potential export profits [52] and
infrastructure cost, resulting in a high entry barrier for the
general population. Prosumers can theoretically coordinate
to act as a single aggregated service-centric entity. Retail
suppliers are incentivised to provide higher prices for a more
predictable supply [78]. This concept is known as a Virtual
Power Plant (VPP) [79]. A smart contract may facilitate the
consensus mechanism for a number of generating prosumers
to form a VPP. Votes can be cast and, if unanimous, the smart
contract arranges the members into a VPP and acts as the
VPP mediator, liaising with the appropriate grid operator and
fairly disbursing revenues. The mechanism can automatically
decidewhich portions ofmultiple parties’ generated energy to
sell off at specific times to meet the obligations to the buying
utility. It could also handle the allocation of proceeds from
sales.
VPPs allow prosumers a certain level of ‘‘hedging’’.
A specific VPP Member A’s home generation could be
under-performing at a certain time due to weather condi-
tions, but Member B, who is based in another geographic
location where weather conditions are favourable, may sub-
sidise this lack of production. Similarly, Member A may con-
tribute some energy production revenue to Member B when
conditions are reversed. VPPs allow public participation in
grid-scale energy markets [80], thus serving as a more stable
source of revenue for energy generation asset holders. Most
existing proposed VPP strategies still involve some form of
central mediator acting as the ‘‘power plant aggregator’’ [52],
[79], [81]. The VPP-based ideas examined above consist of
elements from all three tiers. VPPs and will certainly make
use of energy tokenisation and likely some form of ownership
ledger (Sustaining Technology tier), exist on some form of
smart contract platform (as mentioned previously), which
handles the exchanges of energy and currency (Evolution-
ary Technology tier) and will use some form of consensus
mechanism for governance and decision-making between
stakeholders (Disruptive Technology tier). Generation leasing
companies or companies with generation at a number of
facilities may consider these concepts as a means of hedg-
ing revenue i.e. selling generation from multiple sources to
guarantee a minimum daily production.
VOLUME 8, 2020 65679
A. de Villiers, P. Cuffe: Three-Tier Framework for Understanding Disruption Trajectories for Blockchain
Continuing on the theme of collaborative generation,
a blockchain-based energy purchase mechanism holds the
potential to allow a shared large-scale economy of produc-
tion. Generation assets can be installed in geographically
ideal locations (e.g. solar arrays in sunnier climates), but
profits are distributed amongst all stakeholders. This accom-
plishes financial securisation through blockchain [82]. Asset
owners are then paid in cryptocurrency. If the market operator
settles in cryptocurrency, these revenue shares are guaranteed.
Alternatively, they can receive their share of energy tokens
for self consumption. A similar leasing mechanism has been
implemented on PV arrays in the case of [35], [83]. Forward
and future contracts are used to hedge revenues for renewable
generators.
2) SMART CONTRACT FINANCE
Grid-scale renewable energy projects are notoriously cap-
ital intensive [84]. This high expense, coupled with the
intermittent nature of renewable generation often makes
finance difficult [40], [85]. Lenders may be unwilling to
put forward the funds without a guarantee to make returns
on investments. Many finance organisations are currently
exploring smart contract technology as a potential hedg-
ing tool [9], and this may be extended to the renewable
energy industry [86]. A smart contract may accept funds
from investors, similar to a crowd funding process [23].
Once complete, the project proceeds may be shared pro-rata
with investors [82], [87]. These results are all accomplished
without any central mediator, with proceeds paid in cryp-
tocurrency directly. The process roughly imitates the intended
workings of the Ethereum-based DAO [9] by allowing public
participation and ownership in large scale projects, while
not depending on any single corporate entity. The secure
public keys attached to each blockchain user makes authority
management possible [23], adding a layer of security in this
process. Thus, similar to how finance is approved in the
traditional sense, a user’s reliability can be assessed based
on their payment and consumption history (both of which
publicly available once their public key ID is identified),
perhaps with a form of consensus votingmechanism allowing
stakeholders to select partner investors.
Unlike other, more abstract, concepts in this tier, the
idea of smart contract finance for large scale renew-
able energy projects has already seen some real-world
manifestation [35], [87]. The idea does not necessarily
depend on the development of a P2P blockchain trading
ecosystem. Proceeds are simple to divide (especially with
market operator co-operation), even if fiat currency is used.
Thus, it should be a consideration for companies attempting
to secure funding for such projects. This could potentially
upend the existing energy finance industry, with all interme-
diaries essentially being automated. Thus, those in energy
finance may pivot to allow such mechanisms, and specialise
in their implementation.
In a similar vein, but on a smaller scale, generation assets
for homes and businesses can be purchased on credit and paid
off over time. The smart meter can intervene and disconnect
supply if payments are not honoured. This system is compa-
rable to the workings of M-PAYG [35], who provide ‘‘pay
as you go’’ solar PV leasing. If energy is exported for profit,
some portion can automatically be put towards payments on
the equipment itself. This could be based on a smart contract,
in combination with a P2P electricity trading platform.
IV. CONCLUSION
Owing to excitement around the subject, blockchain has been
subject to much attention. Research into its usage has been
extensive, with a variety of ideas ranging from plausible to
more exotic. The electrical energy field is not exempt and has
seen its fair share of research and business implementations.
As such, engineering and management personnel may find
themselves confused as to blockchain’s true usefulness and
likely impact in their specific sectors. This study has eluci-
dated a tiered taxonomy of industry disruption by blockchain
technology. This taxonomy is used as a framework to guide
a literature review on blockchain’s usage in the electrical
energy industry. The likeliness of adoption of the various
concepts is discussed. Although there is certainly potential
for significant change in the industry, there are many barriers
to implementation (especially for more exotic concepts) and
the actual depth of disruption is yet to be seen.
Ideas grouped in the first tier seem most likely to occur.
One recommendation is that electricity wholesalers should
most likely invest in developing cryptocurrency-based pay-
ment options, as this change would be relatively simple to
implement and could largely act as future-proofing in terms
of advanced payment layers. Cryptocurrency as a payment
layer has seen some mainstream acceptance, and this trend is
likely to continue. Those involved in generation asset man-
agement or carbon trade should consider a novel blockchain
as secure and transparent ledger, which would make adapting
to large-scale roll outs of distributed ledgers easier in the
future.
The second tier seems less likely to occur in the near future.
That said, peer-to-Peer trading mechanisms have already
been implemented on a small scale, and those involved in gen-
eration leasing could consider this mechanism. IoT-enabled
smart metering developers could allow for some form of
blockchain interfacing in future products. Developers of
housing complexes could consider a peer-to-Peer trading
system between units. If this level of disruption is achieved,
energy wholesalers are most at risk, and should investi-
gate expanding or pivoting into new services. For both this
tier and the first tier it is important to recall the Oracle
problem, which always requires a degree of trust in some
information-providing entity for any smart contract which
requires off-chain data.
In terms of the third tier, very high-level concepts are
present, and are least likely to see implementation in the near
future, if at all. Regulation changes and resistance of existing
entities may prove too strong as barriers of entry. While the
technology is promising as a radical tool for reimagining
management and governance, in the authors’ opinion those in
65680 VOLUME 8, 2020

engineering management do not need to worry about losing
their jobs to smart contracts any time soon.
