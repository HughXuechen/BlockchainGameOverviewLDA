Abstract: The objective of this research was to review the manuscripts registered in the Scopus
database related to business ecosystems during the period 2018–2022. A total of 96 documents
were selected and examined under a bibliometric and bibliographic approach. The results showed
an annual growth rate of 13.21%. The United Kingdom (n = 22) led the countries with the most
documents, computer science (n = 40) is the subject area with the most publications, and articles
(n = 61) and conference papers (n = 23) dominated the types of documents. The nine most studied
topics were innovation ecosystems, collaborative ecosystems, sustainable business ecosystems, digital
business ecosystems, ecosystems of the Internet of Things, circular ecosystems in companies, regula-
tory frameworks for digital business ecosystems, resilience of business ecosystems, and ecosystems
in smart cities. Six unexplored themes were extracted for future research: ICT industries, smart
contracts, electric vehicles, serious games, energy, and blockchain. It should be noted that this study
is one of the most up to date, and 85.5% of the 96 publications were original studies, i.e., valuable
information that supports the results.
Keywords: sustainability; digital business ecosystems; circular ecosystem; innovation; IoT
1. Introduction
A business ecosystem (BE) is identified when a group of companies pool their expertise
around an innovation to develop innovative products and satisfy customers [1–4]. BEs
have a main objective, and that is to create value for regular customers, which is why they
require good organization [5–8].
BEs are made up of a network of organizations, and this includes suppliers, customers,
distributors, government agencies, and competitors, among others. Everyone is involved
in supplying a particular service or product through competition and cooperation [8,9].
Companies that leverage business ecosystems will be better positioned to drive innovation
and capital efficiency in creating user value. A good understanding of business ecosystems
is increasingly important to keep up with and stay ahead of the pace of change [10–13].
Good development of BEs helps to strengthen economies, and consequently jobs
are created and income generated, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) [14–17]. The SDGs are a guide that will guarantee companies to discover if their
impact on economic, social, and environmental matters offers benefits to society, and thus
improve their image and their links with the different stakeholders [18–20].
Business ecosystems are considered essential contributors to many of the SDGs, such
as ending poverty (SDG 1) [21], decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) [22], health
and wellness (SDG 3) [23], quality education (SDG 4) [24], clean water and sanitation
(SDG 6) [25], and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) [26], etc.
The business ecosystem as a management strategy moves to a new stage with the
recent changes in global scenarios [11,27,28]. This is how business ecosystems play a key

role in the knowledge applied by companies that lead to the achievements and objectives
planned by this sector [13].
There are numerous study topics linked to business ecosystems, such as digital busi-
ness ecosystems [4,29,30], sustainability [11,31,32], business development [33–35], business
models [7,36,37], benchmarking [38], electronic commerce [7,39], supply-chain manage-
ment [8,9], and blockchain [40,41], among others.
After the execution of a bibliographic review, it was possible to identify only four
review-type studies related to business ecosystems during the period 2018–2022. The first
was developed in [42], where they analyzed this emerging research channel focused on
business ecosystems from an Asian context. The authors proposed three essential research
directions within business ecosystems: integration, dynamics, and internationalization.
The second study’s [4] purpose was to fill a gap in the research on digital business ecosys-
tems (DBE) through (1) the development of a framework that provides a comprehensive
orientation of DBE research, (2) identifying gaps in the DBE literature, and (3) providing
future research directions.
The third study [41] aimed to explore a model change and ecosystem growth in health
care making use of blockchain technology. This study exposed the evolutionary devel-
opment of blockchain in the context of health care and its dynamic relationship between
participants. The fourth and last study of the review type [43] focused on the fragility in
which multinational companies (MNE) find themselves due to global decoupling; therefore,
the objective of this study was to improve the capacity of MNEs to achieve adaptation to
challenging fortuitous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
In alignment with the two previous paragraphs, the four cited manuscripts focused on
a specific study topic, but none made a complete evaluation of the topics related to business
ecosystems. For these reasons, this bibliometric approach is important, since its objective is
to provide an exhaustive response to these issues and thus be able to identify the scope of
business ecosystems. In this context, it was possible to formulate three questions:
• RQ1. What is the main information of publications on business ecosystems (production
of publications by year, country, thematic area, and type of documents)?
• RQ2. What are the topics covered by business ecosystems?
• RQ3. What are the little-explored topics on business ecosystems that could be part of a
future research agenda?
To answer the research questions, this bibliometric study had as its main objective
to discuss the manuscripts on business ecosystems in Scopus during the period 2018–
2022. This study aimed to identify the main information about business ecosystems (year,
country, thematic area, and type of documents), the topics touched on, and to point out
little-explored research topics. Finally, a bibliographic criterion was applied to recognize
the points of view of the authors who participated in the documents selected for this study.
2. Methodology
This document was prepared with a bibliometric approach. This method is applied in
multiple fields, and is gaining in importance within academia [44]. The five-step bibliomet-
ric method of Zupic and Čater [45] was applied: study design, bibliometric data collection,
analysis, visualization and interpretation (Figure 1).
2.1. Study Design
After the bibliographic review, three research questions were formulated: RQ1, RQ2
and RQ3, previously described in the Introduction section. To respond to RQ1, Microsoft
Excel column charts were chosen to indicate the production of publications according to
the year, country, thematic area, and type of documents. To answer RQ2, a thematic map
was selected, which is a bibliometric method with a conceptual structure that indicates the
directions of the questioned themes. To answer RQ3, the bibliometric method “keyword
co-occurrence analysis” was applied to indicate keywords with the least co-occurrence.
These keywords allowed inferring the least explored topics by business ecosystems.

2.1. Study Design 
After the bibliographic review, three research questions were formulated: RQ1, RQ2 
and RQ3, previously described in the Introduction section. To respond to RQ1, Microsoft 
Excel column charts were chosen to indicate the production of publications according to 
the year, country, thematic area, and type of documents. To answer RQ2, a thematic map 
was selected, which is a bibliometric method with a conceptual structure that indicates 
the directions of the questioned themes. To answer RQ3, the bibliometric method “key-
word co-occurrence analysis” was applied to indicate keywords with the least co-occur-
rence. These keywords allowed inferring the least explored topics by business ecosystems. 
2.2. Bibliometric Data Collection 
A total of 561 documents containing the keyword “business ecosystems” in their ti-
tles were selected in Scopus. Scopus was selected because it has a wide time coverage, it 
currently hosts more than 40,000 peer-reviewed journals from all thematic areas, and its 
updating is regular, which allows access to the latest knowledge. The search was nar-
rowed down to Open Access documents, obtaining 148. Then, the documents were lim-
ited to the period 2018–2022, obtaining 96. This time was determined because the reason 
for this review was to analyze recent studies. The generated search string was as follows: 
“TITLE (“business ecosystem”) AND (LIMIT-TO (OA, “all”)) AND (LIMIT-TO 
(PUBYEAR, 2022) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2021) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2020) OR 
LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2019) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2018)).” All countries, all types 
of documents, and all subject areas were included. 
2.3. Data Analysis 
At this stage, the data were loaded and converted to safeguard quality and viability. 
The data were collected from Scopus in files with CSV format for the Microsoft Excel 365 
web application (Redmond, WA, USA), RIS format for VOSviewer software version 1.6.18 
(Leiden, The Netherlands) and BibTex format for RStudio software version R 4.1.1 (Vi-
enna, Austria). 
2.4. Visualization 
This bibliometric review was supported by column charts using the Microsoft Excel 
365 web application to show the main production of publications (by year, by country, by 
thematic area, and by type of document). Additionally, it was based on the thematic map 
function of the statistical package RStudio for the visualization of the most explored study 
topics. Finally, it relied on the keyword co-occurrence analysis produced by the 
VOSviewer software to visualize the possible underexplored topics that may shape a fu-
ture research agenda.

2.2. Bibliometric Data Collection
A total of 561 documents containing the keyword “business ecosystems” in their
titles were selected in Scopus. Scopus was selected because it has a wide time coverage, it
currently hosts more than 40,000 peer-reviewed journals from all thematic areas, and its
updating is regular, which allows access to the latest knowledge. The search was narrowed
down to Open Access documents, obtaining 148. Then, the documents were limited to
the period 2018–2022, obtaining 96. This time was determined because the reason for
this review was to analyze recent studies. The generated search string was as follows:
“TITLE (“business ecosystem”) AND (LIMIT-TO (OA, “all”)) AND (LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR,
2022) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2021) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2020) OR LIMIT-TO
(PUBYEAR, 2019) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2018)).” All countries, all types of documents,
and all subject areas were included.

At this stage, the data were loaded and converted to safeguard quality and viability.
The data were collected from Scopus in files with CSV format for the Microsoft Excel
365 web application (Redmond, WA, USA), RIS format for VOSviewer software version
1.6.18 (Leiden, The Netherlands) and BibTex format for RStudio software version R 4.1.1
(Vienna, Austria).
2.4. Visualization
This bibliometric review was supported by column charts using the Microsoft Excel
365 web application to show the main production of publications (by year, by country,
by thematic area, and by type of document). Additionally, it was based on the thematic
map function of the statistical package RStudio for the visualization of the most explored
study topics. Finally, it relied on the keyword co-occurrence analysis produced by the
VOSviewer software to visualize the possible underexplored topics that may shape a future
research agenda.
2.5. Interpretation
In this step, the results are described and represented within the framework of the
specific objectives, i.e., the results obtained in the main information, the topics navigated
by business ecosystems, and the little-explored topics for future research are discussed.
Finally, the final document is prepared.

including [48,49].
In 2021, the publications increased to 24 documents, among them those linked to
the sustainability variable stand out [11,18,19,31]. As of the date of preparation of this
bibliometric document (October 2022), only 23 manuscripts had been registered, but ac-
cording to the annual growth rate of 13.21%, a registration of 27 studies is expected. The
publications on business ecosystems of this year (2022) are closely related to the variables
digital business ecosystem and value creation [5,6,50].
3.1.3. Document Production by Country
The 32 countries involved in the 96 documents selected for this bibliometric review
worked together, i.e., a document could be considered by two or more countries. Therefore,

The Netherlands (n = 6) and Taiwan (n = 6) rank 9th and 10th [41,49]. Japan (n = 5) is 
in 11th position, followed by Italy and the United States in 12th and 13th positions, with 
four documents each. Ghana and Sweden occupy the 14th and 15th positions, with three 
manuscripts each. Australia, Austria, Brazil, Malaysia, Spain, and Switzerland are in 16th,

3.1.4. Production of Documents by Subject Area 
According to what was indicated in the methodological design, there was no re-
striction of the thematic areas; therefore, a combined approach of several thematic areas 
linked to business ecosystems is possible. Consequently, a document can be registered by

3.1.4. Production of Documents by Subject Area
According to what was indicated in the methodological design, there was no restriction
of the thematic areas; therefore, a combined approach of several thematic areas linked to
business ecosystems is possible. Consequently, a document can be registered by more than
two thematic areas linked in this investigation. Figure 4 shows the 20 thematic areas that
are attributed in a combined way to the 96 documents selected for this study.
Computer science ranks first in Figure 4, with 40 papers [4,18,29,54,61,67,68]. Business,
management, and accounting ranks second, with 39 manuscripts [13,33,34,36,69,70]. Social
sciences ranks third, with 29 publications [31,37,46,59,71]. Engineering is in fourth place,
with 23 documents [9,35,48,62,72]. Decision sciences and energy register 18 manuscripts
each and these occupy the fifth and sixth places [20,52,73–75]. Environmental science is in
seventh place, with 17 publications [8,10,18,19].
Economy, econometrics, and finance has 11 documents, in eighth position [76,77].
Mathematics with four publications is positioned in ninth place, psychology in tenth
position with three manuscripts, and medicine in eleventh place with two studies. The
rest of the nine thematic areas register only one document each. These areas are arts and

3.1.5. Production by Document Type
Figure 5 shows the types of documents found in this bibliometric study. Articles
account for 61 manuscripts, which represents 63.54% of the total. Conference papers ac-
count for 23 documents, 23.96% of the total. Both articles and conference papers add up to
84 documents. This means that 85.50% of the 96 publications are considered original re-
search (primary sources); therefore, this is valuable information for this bibliometric study.
Reviews number four, 4.17% of the 96 documents [4,41–43]. These four papers allow
us to infer that few reviews have been carried out and the most recent was done in 2021.
Book chapter, editorial, and note number four, three, and one publications, respectively,
representing 8.33% of the total.

9 Ecosystems in smart cities Niche themes
Innovation Ecosystems: In Table 2, this is indicated as a motor theme and includes
publications that deal with how companies, institutions and states relate to each other to
create a collaborative and innovative framework, where they work together and make their
results known, guaranteeing a profound knowledge change [7,11,12,33,46,47,78].
Collaborative Ecosystems: In Table 2, this is indicated as a motor theme and includes
studies that deal with knowledge services supported by digital technologies to be applied
in the distinct stages of the chains, from production, industrialization, coordination to
commercialization [4,20,38,66,79].
Sustainable business ecosystem: In Table 2, this is a basic theme that deals with the abil-
ity of companies to execute long-term tasks, based on economic, social, and environmental
criteria that guarantee the sustainability of the company [10,11,18,19,31,32].
Digital business ecosystem: In Table 2, this is considered a basic theme with publica-
tions that refer to the adaptations of a company and the collaborative network established
to provide improved products or services (via the internet). Therefore, online collabo-
ration is achieved by companies, their associates, and consumers, causing benefits for
all [4,6,29,30,80].
Ecosystem of the Internet of Things: This is a motor theme and the studies on this
subject deal with how the Internet of Things facilitates a better presence and control of
the activities and budgets of a company with the help of the incorporation of software
programs, machine sensors, computer systems and data storage [30,32,36,75].
Circular ecosystem in companies: This is a basic theme with studies that deal with how
the circular economy leads to the development of a company, beyond harming the environ-
ment. This entails the separation of the economic activity from the use of exhaustible re-
sources, in addition to recovering and separating the losses from the design [31,48,49,79,81].
Regulatory framework for digital business ecosystems: This is a motor theme with
studies that refer to secondary laws, that is, the regulations that determine the way in
which services must be provided in a particular situation, as well as the parties in charge of
supervising their app [4,46,82].
Resilience of business ecosystems: This is considered a niche theme and includes
publications that deal with the possibility of adaptation that companies could have in
the face of circumstances that cause inconveniences for their operation, in addition to the
accelerated organizational dynamics that have been taking place lately [20,83].
Ecosystems in smart cities: In Table 2, this is considered a niche theme. This subject
of study deals with the improvements of urban administration to optimize resources and
budget, in addition to providing optimal services to the inhabitants. To this end, they rely
Sustainability 2022, 14, 16224 9 of 14
on the digitization of services, to this is added the control of urban management and the
works that are carried out in cities [60,84,85].
3.3. Future Research Agenda
Following the analysis of the 96 manuscripts identified for this study, in addition to
the 287 keywords, it was possible to extract six topics of study that were little explored
(Figure 7). The selection criterion was to search for the author’s keywords with the least
co-occurrence (n = 1) and linked to the word “business ecosystems”. For this analysis,
the “Association strength” feature of the VOSviewer software was applied. The six key-
words were: ICT industries, smart contracts, electric vehicles, serious games, energy, and
blockchain. These six themes are discussed below.
ICT industries: Studies on how information and communication technology (ICT)
brings together manufacturing and supply sectors, where their products carry out the task
of data processing and communication through digital means, in particular visualization
and transmission [9,79].
Smart Contract: Studies that deal with the design of computer programs designed
to be applied regularly as soon as the companies or people involved in a contract comply
with the regulations of this [86,87].
Electric vehicles: Studies on how public policies, benefits and private initiatives try
to converge to promote the introduction of electric vehicles to civilians and companies,
especially for transportation, coordination, and delivery tasks. The central objective of the
ecosystem is to minimize the obstacles when replacing combustion vehicles in favor of
more sustainable ones [27,64].
Serious games: Studies that deal with digital applications designed for training and
education, where the basic purpose is to impart experiences, train, communicate, remember,
and educate end consumers. It is used as a mechanism for knowledge exchange through
procedures that take advantage of the game (against oneself/others) and a scheme of
rewards and sanctions to measure learning from a game-based perspective [88,89].

3.3. Future Research Agenda 
Following the analysis of the 96 manuscripts identified for this study, in addition to 
the 287 keywords, it was possible to extract six topics of study that were little explored 
(Figure 7). The selection criterion was to search for the author’s keywords with the least 
co-occurrence (n = 1) and linked to the word “business ecosystems.” For this analysis, the 
“Association strength” feature of the VOSviewer software was applied. The six keywords 
were: ICT industries, smart contracts, electric vehicles, serious games, energy, and block-
chain. These six themes are discussed below.

of rewards and sanctions to measure learning from a game-based perspective [88,89]. 
Energy: Studies that deal with how the increase in global demand for renewable en-
ergy helps to slow down climate change. These demands encourage utilities to expand 
their portfolios and drive energy transformation through the involvement of efficient, re-
liable, green, and sustainable technologies [6,61]. 
Blockchain: Studies that deal with how blockchain, based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) 
scheme, is considered a widespread registration technology that allows avoidance of in-
termediaries to execute operations with minimal risk in real time and without errors 
[6,18,56,90–92].

4. Limitations
This bibliometric study was based on data obtained from the Scopus database, and
the reason for its selection is specified in the methodology section. Second, the document
search was limited to open access documents (both open access and subscription editions).
Finally, the information used was from the period 2018 to October 2022.
5. Conclusions
This study has shown that business ecosystems contribute in many ways to the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Considering the main information, 85.5% of the
publications in this bibliometric study are original research, so the results are based on
valuable information.
To respond to RQ1, the production of publications per year showed an annual growth
rate of 13.21%; therefore, research on business ecosystems is constantly growing. The UK
leads in document production, with 22. Notably, the UK has a vibrant and diverse business
ecosystem that is supportive of newcomers. Additionally, the government has programs
that offers tax breaks for investors while lowering investment risks for early-stage startups.
In addition, it has four of the top 10 universities in the world and is consistently ranked as
one of the top 10 countries in the world to do business. This country has approximately
40 trade agreements with around 70 countries, thus strengthening relations of mutual
economic growth; therefore, they make up a strong and global trade ecosystem.
Computer sciences, business, management and accounting, and social sciences are
the top three areas of knowledge, with 40, 39, and 29 publications. This pattern in the
production of publications allows us to infer the interrelation between these three areas, and
that is that BEs need the intervention of the social sciences so that society can consolidate
and progress.
In response to RQ2, nine study topics touched by business ecosystems were identified,
of which three are basic themes, four are motor themes, and two are niche theme (Table 2).
To answer RQ3, potential future research topics were discussed, giving rise to six little-
explored areas (Section 3.3).
It is suggested to carry out research with the topics categorized in Table 2 as niche
themes, and with the six potential topics for future research. This manuscript is one of the
most up-to-date bibliometric studies on business ecosystems (October 2022).
The findings revealed the nine most explored topics during 2018–2022 and suggest
another six to be explored in future research. In this sense, this study would be useful
for future studies on business ecosystems due to the many topics to explore that were
mentioned above.
