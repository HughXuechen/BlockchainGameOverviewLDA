Abstract—With the explosive growth of smart IoT devices at
the edge of the Internet, embedding sensors on mobile devices
for massive data collection and collective environment sensing has
been envisioned as a cost-effective solution for IoT applications.
However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated
middleware for (semi-) centralized task dispatching, data storage
and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive
to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and
face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper,
we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely
decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-
powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors
use the power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons
for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is
then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services,
i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance.
Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission and the
transaction fee incurred by the blockchain’s distributed ledger
services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission
rates to maximize their individual payoff. Thus, we formulate a
noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation
among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the
existence of the Nash equilibria as well as a series of insightful
numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.

I. INTRODUCTION
At the dawn of 5G, the world has seen an enormous increase
in the number of pervasively connected IoT devices, which are
used in a plethora of scenarios such as vehicular networks,
the logistics/manufacturing sectors, smart homes and e-health.
With the trend of sensor miniaturization and the widespread
adoption of IPv6, Cisco predicts that by 2021 an extraordinary
amount of 847ZB data will be generated by IoT devices
annually and about 7.2ZB will be finally stored worldwide [1].
Such technological development has created unprecedented
opportunities of access to ubiquitous sensing data about the
context in concern, e.g., smart city and urban environment,
for both real-time use and big data-based analysis. However,
it also imposes great challenges to network operation and data
processing. Compared with the conventional Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs), most of the IoT sensors are owned by users
instead of operators. Meanwhile, the data generated by the
same sensors may be consumed by different data services,
which require various levels of data quality, timeliness and
sampling frequency for different purposes. For this reason,
conventional WSNs is limited in proliferation due to the cost
of deployment and maintenance as well as the rigidness with
task-specified data processing/dispatching structures.
To overcome the limitations of conventional WSNs in both
network operation and data processing, a number of novel
paradigms have been proposed at both the network side and
the data processing side. In [2], a framework of wireless-
powered sensing systems was proposed to address the issues
of limited temporal-spatial coverage in urban crowdsensing
over wearables. Therein, the mobile operator deploys ultra-
dense charging stations using energy beamforming in small
cells, which only require incremental upgrade of the protocols
running on existing infrastructure. Such design enables the
accommodation of the massive-scale, already-in-field IoT de-
vices for Radio Frequency (RF)-powered pervasive sensing.
Power transfer is used as incentiveness for IoT devices to
execute tasks of crowdsensing applications. For involved par-
ties, this framework helps to form the basis of an energy-data
market at the data collection stage. At the operator side, data
processing/aggregation is usually delegated to the cloud-based
backend [3] or semi-centralized edge servers [4]. Under this
paradigm, interconnections between the sensor cloud and the
data processing backend rely on an intermediate layer provided
by the operator for handling the tasks of data mediation, such
as task association, data filtering, privacy preserving and data-
integrity verification [3]. However, with the presence of such a
middleware pre-designed and fully controlled by the operator,
the IoT platforms and crowdsensing framework face the same
problem of lacking adaptability and high installation cost as
in WSNs. Also, the centralization of data processing, storage
and trading inevitably causes the security risks such as data
falsification and manipulation because of a single breach.
To overcome the flaws and vulnerability caused by cen-
tralization at the data processing stage, we resort to the
emerging technology of permissionless blockchains [5]. Note
that the functionalities of blockchains such as tamper-proof
value transfer and smart contracts enables decentralized data-
access control and transaction automation. Thus, a data trading
platform based on permissionless blockchains is able to ensure
that the task assignment, the data collection, storage and
trading are all performed in a decentralized but trusted manner.

Then, the centralized intermediate layer can be safely removed
to enhance privacy and data security while the data integrity is
still publicly verifiable. In brief, a permissionless blockchain
system can be seen as a replicated database maintained by
a number of pseudonymous nodes over peer-to-peer (P2P)
connections. Blockchains use the public key infrastructure
(PKI) mechanism and the data structure of hash linked list to
ensure that the time order and the content of a data record
(also known as a transaction) cannot be tampered without
being noticed once it is confirmed on the chain [5]. The
blockchain relies on Byzantine fault-tolerate mechanisms, e.g.,
Nakamoto protocol [6] or practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(BFT) protocol [7], to coordinate the Byzantine agreement,
i.e., peer consensus, about the state of the transaction storage
among the consensus nodes. For permissionless blockchains,
the messaging complexity for reaching the consensus among
the P2P nodes are expected to be sufficiently low such that
the size of the consensus network scales well.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework of an RF-
powered IoT crowdsensing system. The IoT system under
consideration involves three parties, i.e., the massive-scale
IoT devices/sensors working as a sensing cloud, the wireless
network operator, and the permissionless blockchain network
as shown in Figure 1. The sensors operate by using wireless
power transferred from RF-energy beacons. The power is
consumed by the sensors for data sensing and for data trans-
mission to the access point. The network operator provides
wireless power transfer facility, i.e., RF-energy beacons, and
data communication services, i.e., an access point, to the
sensors. In exchange, the sensors are charged with a certain
price for the transferred power by the network operator.
The permissionless blockchain enables smart contracts in the
form of programmable automata on the chain [8]. After the
task schedulers (i.e., data consumers) deploy their own data
trading contracts onto the blockchain, the sensors are able to
autonomously choose a task to work for by responding to one
of those smart contracts. By encapsulating the sensing data
into transactions, the sensors send the data via virtual channels
on the blockchain for ledger processing, e.g., data verification
and ordering. The blockchain network adapts the scheme of
Proof-of-Work (PoW) [6] for Sybil attack prevention [5]. As
a result, the consensus nodes in the blockchain also charges
a transaction fee for processing the data from sensors. After
the data verification, the sensors trade the secured data on
the blockchain with data consumers for revenue. Here, the
data trading processes are completely self-organized with no
middle layer controlled by the operator. From the perspective
of the sensors and the data consumers, the blockchain can be
regarded as a decentralized Platform as a Service (PaaS).
We investigate the self-organized data sensing process by
focusing on the behaviors of data sensors. We consider that
the sensors are rational and self-interested in maximizing their
individual utility. The utility of a sensor can be defined as a
function of the revenue from data trading, the payment made
to the network operator and the transaction fee paid to the
blockchain network. By choosing the data transmission rates,

system.
the sensors are able to control the volume of traded data,
and hence both the payment made to the blockchain and the
operator and the revenue received from the task schedulers.
However, when the sensors share the same wireless channel for
data communication, this leads to a competitive situation due
to co-channel interference. Also, we note that the transaction
throughput at the blockchain side is a function of the sensors’
transmission rates and depends on the consensus protocol
adopted by the blockchain. Therefore, by considering the
influence of the blockchain consensus protocol, we formulate
the competition among sensors as a noncooperative game. Our
analysis shows that by choosing the proper blockchain con-
sensus protocol, the following key properties are guaranteed
in the proposed IoT sensing system:
• The data, i.e., transaction, throughput of the blockchain
scales well such that the massive data volume from the
sensor cloud is handled smoothly.
• The rational and self-interested sensors noncooperatively
decide on their own sensing/transferring data for individ-
ual utility optimization.
• The noncooperative sensors are able to reach a system
equilibrium in a self-organized manner with limited co-
ordination among themselves.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider an RF-powered IoT crowdsensing system as
shown in Figure 1. Specifically, a cloud (i.e., set) of sensors
denoted by N harvest energy from the beamforming-enabled
RF-energy beacons to support data transfer from the sensors to
the access point. Each sensor i∈N independently negotiates
with the operator about the wirelessly received power level pi
within the range Dpi
=[0, pui ]. The data and payment transfer
between the sensors and the data consumers is settled over
virtual/logical (i.e., overlay peer-to-peer) links in the form
of smart contracts in the blockchain network. The sensors
upload their sensing data to the blockchain by sending them
via the access points over a shared physical channel. Before
investigating the behaviors of the decentralized sensors, we
first describe the impact of the consensus protocol on the
performance of the blockchain.
A. Scalable Consensus Protocol for Blockchains
The considered IoT sensing system requires that the data
services, e.g., data storage, trading and task dispatching, are
implemented on top of a permissionless blockchain. Namely,

the sensing data are encapsulated into blockchain transactions
of fixed size, and the data trading process is performed in
the form of smart contract execution. To enhance the storage
efficiency, only the digest of each transaction is stored on the
chain, and the content (i.e., payload data) of the transactions is
stored off-chain by each consensus node. We note that as the
number of transaction increases with the scale of the sensor
cloud, it is necessary for the blockchain to provide scalable
transaction throughput. However, since most of the popular
Bitcoin-like blockchains rely on the Nakamoto protocol [6] for
achieving probabilistic consensus, they are severely limited by
their throughput bottleneck1 [5].
To ensure that the blockchain’s data processing capability
matches the volume of data traffic from the sensor cloud, we
adopt the scalable consensus protocol based on sharding [5]
in the considered sensing system. Compared with the PoW-
based Nakamoto protocol, which requires full data replication
on each consensus node in the network, the sharding pro-
tocol dynamically partitions the consensus nodes into small
groups of committees running BFT protocols. As a result,
each committee only processes a subset (i.e., shard) of all
the pending transactions, and the data replication is limited
within each committee. Then, by increasing the number of
the consensus nodes, the blockchain is able to form more BFT
committees and process more transactions at the same time. In
other words, sharding protocols parallelize data processing on
the blockchain. Meanwhile, by allowing dynamical creation
of shards out of the consensus nodes newly joining the
blockchain network, the throughput constraint in Bitcoin-like
blockchains can be completely lifted.
In this paper, we adopt the ELASTICO protocol from [9] to
exemplify the approach of system analysis in the context of
blockchains’ sharding consensus. ELASTICO proceeds trans-
actions in loosely-synchronized epochs, at the beginning of
which the consensus nodes are required to provide solutions to
their own PoW puzzles in order to join a BFT committee. More
Specifically, ELASTICO is composed of two major stages,
namely, the first stage of identity verification (i.e., PoW puzzle
solution) for BFT committee formation and the second stage
of BFT protocol execution for data processing. We assume
that the consensus nodes are equipped with roughly the same
computing power. Then, according to the analysis of ELAS-
TICO [9], the transaction throughput increases almost linearly
with the computational power admitted by the blockchain.
Therefore, it is possible to scale the transaction throughput
of the blockchain according to the total data transmission rate
of the sensors, as long as the sensors are able to sustain the
maintenance cost of the blockchain.
B. Sensor Interaction Model
After choosing the scalable consensus protocol for the
blockchain, we are reedy to investigate the behaviors of the
sensors in the decentralized IoT system. Let ci be the fixed

transactions per second.
power level used by sensor i for circuit maintenance and data
sensing. Then, the power used by sensor i to transmit data for
storage and trading is pi − ci. We consider the path loss as
a function of the distance di between sensor i and the access
point connected to the blockchain. Let r = [ri]
�
i∈N be the
vector of the transmission rates, p = [pi]
�
i∈N be the vector
of received powers, i.e., the power transferred from the RF-
energy beacons received by a sensor. Likewise, let p−i be
the vector of the received powers except sensor i. Then, the
transmission rate of sensor i can be derived as follows ∀i ∈ N :
ri = Ri (pi,p−i) = bilog2

where σ2 is the variance of the additive white Gaussian noise,
gi is the channel gain of sensor i, and bi is the correspond-
ing bandwidth. We define R (p) = [Ri (pi,p−i)]
�
i∈N , where
R (p) :Dp=×i∈N Dpi
�→ Dr is a continuous closed mapping.
We consider that the maintenance cost of the blockchain is
measured in the supplied computational power. Based on the
linear relationship between the computational power and the
transaction throughput in ELASTICO, we can further express
the required computational power as m
∑
j∈N Rj (pj ,p−j),
where m > 0 is the computational power coefficient and∑
j∈N Rj (pj ,p−j) is the total data rate of the sensor cloud.
Furthermore, it is well-known that the power consumption in
modern computer architecture can be modeled as a quadratic
function of the corresponding computational frequency [10].
Therefore, the power consumption of the sharded blockchain
network can be derived as

where a, b and c are the power consumption coefficients.
To enjoy the data service (e.g., smart contracts and transac-
tion recording) provided by the sharded blockchain, sensor
i needs to pay the transaction fee to compensate the cost
of the consensus nodes incurred by energy consumption. We
assume that the sensors proportionally share the blockchain
maintenance cost among themselves according to the volume
of data that they propose to the blockchain. Then, the rate
of payment by sensor i depends on its fraction of the total
transmit rate as follows:
Ci =

The revenue of a sensor is a function of the volume of
its sensing data recorded by the blockchain. Let λi denote
the price of unit bitrate of sensor i and φ denote the price
of unit power transferred from the RF-energy beacons. To
support the wirelessly received power level pi for sensor i, the

based on the Slivnyak-Mecke’s
theorem [11], where η is the path-loss exponent of wirelessly
power transfer and dti is the distance between the RF-energy
beacons and sensor i. Based on (1)-(3), the utility of sensor i
can be expressed as follows:

In (4), a larger λi indicates a higher quality (hence a higher
value) of the data generated by sensor i.
Each sensor aims to maximize its individual utility, i.e.,
max
pi∈Dpi
ui (pi,p−i), given the interference from other sensors.
Therefore, the sensors’ strategy are coupled, and a nonco-
operative game can be formulated as a four-tuple Gs =
{N ,p,Dp,u}, where
• N is the set of active sensors, i.e., the players;
• Dp ⊂ R
|N | is the domain of p, i.e., strategy, and an
|N |-polyhedron;
• p ∈ Dp is the sensor-determined received power vector;
• u = [ui]i∈N is the vector of sensors’ utilities as a
function of p, where ui is given by (4).
Based on the game formulation, we consider the Nash
equilibrium to be the solution for the sensors.
III. EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
To ease the analysis of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) in game
Gs, we consider that the sensors optimize their utilities by
deciding on their transmission rates instead of on their power
strategies p. This is owning to the fact that the vector of
the functions describing the relationship between r and p,
i.e., r = R (p), is a continuous, closed injective operator as
shown in Theorem 1. Then, there exists an inverse operator of
R (p), denoted by R−1 (r) : Dr �→ Dp, such that the sensors’
received power vector p is uniquely determined given their
transmission rates r.
THEOREM 1. There exists an inverse operator of R (p), i.e.,
R−1 (r) : Dr �→ Dp, such that p = R−1 (r).
Proof. Let γi (ri) = e

γi (ri) = Λi (β (p)) =

. (5)
Since ∀i∈N both γi (ri) and βi (pi) are continuous, closed
injective operators, the injective properties of R (p) can be
ensured iff Λ (β (p)) = [Λi (β (p))]i∈N is injective.
We prove by contradiction that Λ (β (p)) is injective. As-
sume that Λ (β (p)) is not injective. Then, there exist p′,
p∈Dp and p′ �=p such that r′=r. Without loss of generality,
we assume p′i>pi. To ensure r′i = ri, p
′ should satisfy

fore, the assumption that Λ (β (p)) is not injective cannot be
true, and Λ (β (p)) is injective. With the injective property of
γi (ri) and βi (pi), ∀i ∈ N , R (p) is an injective operator.
Since R (p) is a continuous, closed operator, its inverse
operator, i.e., R−1 (r), exists and the proof is completed.
By Theorem 1, the utility of sensor i in the form of (4)
can be rewritten as in (10). It is now possible for each
sensor to optimize the individual utility by deciding on its
transmission rate instead of the received powers from the RF-
energy beacons. Then, we can obtain the following condition
for the existence of the NE in game Gs:

since ri = Ri (pi,p−i) defined in (1) is concave with respect
to pi, its inverse operator, i.e., pi = R−1

ingly convex with respect to ri according to the injective prop-

ui (ri, r−i) is
therefore smaller than 0. According to Theorem 1 in [12], the
solution to the noncooperative game Gs exists, and the proof
is completed.
It is well-known that following the concavity condition in
Theorem 2, the continuous better-reply in the form of simul-
taneous gradient ascent admits an equilibrium point (see [12,
Theorem 7]). Due to the space limit, we omit the presentation
of the equilibrium searching algorithm and the discussion on
the globally asymptotic stability of the equilibrium. Interested
readers are referred to [12] for more details.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we present numerical studies to evaluate
the performance of the IoT crowdsensing system. For
ease of illustration, we consider 10 sensors, i.e, |N | = 10,
working as a sensing cloud. The bandwidth of a sensor
is bi = 2, ∀i ∈ N , and the noise σ is 1. The vector of
the distances between the sensors and the access point
connected to the blockchain, i.e., d = [di]i∈N , is set
to be [0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.25],
and α = [αi]i∈N = [3.5, 3, 2.5, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 3.5].
The channel gain g = [gi]i∈N is set to be
[1.95, 2, 2.18, 1.95, 2, 2.18, 1.95, 2, 2.18, 1.95]. The price
of unit received power φ is set to be 0.01, and the circuit
and sensing power vector for the sensors c = [ci]i∈N , is
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]. The coefficients in the blockchain
power consumption model are a = 0.1, b = 0.1, c = 0.1 and
the computational power coefficient is m = 3. The distance
between the sensors and RF-energy beacons dt = [dti]i∈N is
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1] × 10−3 + 1 and η = 2. The price of
unit bitrate of sensors is λi = 20, ∀i ∈ N .
A. Numerical Result
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the NE and best responses,
respectively. Figure 2(a) illustrates the NE of the transmission
rates for sensors 2 and 3. The NE is the point at which the best
responses for sensors 2 and 3 intersect. We observe that the
transmission rate of sensor 3 increase as the computational
power coefficient m increases. The reason is that when m
increases, the computational power increases more quickly,
resulting in high energy consumption of the blockchain. Con-
sequently, the transaction fee rises sharply, and hence the less
cost-effective transaction fees that sensor 3 will be charged. In
this case, sensor 3 increase its transmission rate. In contrast,
the transmission rate of sensor 2 decreases as the value of
the computational power coefficient m increases. The reason
is that the transmission rate of sensor 2 is higher than that
of sensor 3, which means that the transaction fee of sensor
2 increases more rapidly than that of sensor 3. Accordingly,
sensor 2 decreases its transmission rate.
We then evaluate the utilities of sensors 2 and 3. In
Figure 2(b), the utility of sensor 2 changes because of the
different transmission rates for transferring the data to the
blockchain. From Figure 2(b), there is a point where the utility
of sensor 2 is maximized, which is pointed by the arrowhead
of “Best response”. This point indicates the NE for sensor 2.
As is evident from Figure 2(b), this utility, which is a function
of the transmission rate, is unimodal, and the optimal solution
can be obtained analytically.
We next investigate the sensors’ states, i.e., the transmission
rates, ratio of the total transaction fee, and utilities in Fig-
ures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c), respectively. As shown in Figure 3,
the transmission rates of sensors 1, 4, 7, and 10 are among
the highest ones because of their shortest distance to the RF-
energy beacons. Specifically for sensors 1 and 2, the gap
between sensors 1 and 2 in the utility is even larger than that in
the transmission rate, i.e., u1
u2
≈ 0.35
0.33 > r1
r2
≈ 0.31
0.3 . The reason
is that each sensor needs to pay the transaction fee according

Figure 4: Transmission rates and utilities under varied m
to its fraction of the sum of all the sensors’ transmission rates
while the total transaction fee is increasing rapidly, i.e., as a
convex function, with respect to the total transmission rates.
This means that the less the sensor’s fraction of the sum of
all the sensors’ transmission rates is, the less cost-effective
transaction fee that it will be charged. This is consistent with
the result shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we study the impact of the computational power
coefficient m on the achievable transmission rates of each
sensor at the equilibrium. In Figure 4(a), we observe that the
transmission rate of sensor 1 increases as m increases. This
is due to the fact that the transaction fee charged to sensor 1
will be less cost-effective as m increases if it operates with a
small transmission rate. Then, sensor 1 tends to increase its
transmission rate. In contrast, due to the large fraction of the
sum of all the sensors’ transmission rates, the transaction fees
for sensors 2 and 3 will increase rapidly as m increases. In
this case, both sensors 2 and 3 will decrease their transmission
rates. Then, the utility of sensor 1 increases as m increases
while those of sensors 2 and 3 decrease (see Figure 4(b)).
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented a noncooperative-game
model to analyze the transmission strategy in the self-
organized wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system built
upon permissionless blockchains. We have focused on the in-
teractions of the sensors and considered the impact of both the
interference and the blockchain maintenance cost on the sen-
sors’ utilities. Analytically, we have established a joint model
describing the impact of the sensors’ transmission strategies
on their transmission rate and the needed transaction fee on the
blockchain side. We have studied the equilibrium strategies of
the sensors in the wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system
by using best response. We have analytically examined the
conditions for the solution, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, of the
game to exist. Our future work will extend to the study in the
impact of user-demands on the sensors’ strategies.
