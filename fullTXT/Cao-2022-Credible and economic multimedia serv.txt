Abstract
The cloud network has the advantages in efficiently offloading the large-scale
Internet traffic, which is considered as a promising architecture to provide the
satisfactory multimedia services for mobile users. However, most current stud-
ies lack the joint consideration of economic and security of services in hybrid
cloud networks. In this paper, a novel multimedia service optimization mecha-
nism is proposed hereby to meet the user's requirements mentioned above while
guaranteeing the reliability of service. Firstly, a credible scheme is designed to
help the mobile users distinguish the reliable cloud providers. Meanwhile, a
blockchain-based content credibility approach is further designed to guaran-
tee the reliability and integrity of video contents. Moreover, a noncooperative
Stackelberg game model is presented to maximize the profit of each party. Fur-
thermore, the equilibrium of this game is achieved by the methods of backward
induction and gradient descent. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that
our solution has efficient performance in terms of secure service ratio, utility,
service pricing, etc.
1 INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of wireless communication technologies and the popularity of mobile devices, a variety
of multimedia services, such as interactive live video, immersive media, online gaming, etc, have sprung up.1,2 These
large-scale multimedia applications have led to an exponential growth in wireless network traffic and increasingly account
for 82% of mobile Internet traffic in 2022.3 This growth trend puts tremendous pressure on the current mobile network. To

tackle this issue, the cloud network as a potential solution provides a beam of light to the conflict between transmission
performance and quality of experience.4,5 In particular, edge clouds (ECs) have the natural advantage to efficiently miti-
gate redundant transmissions from central cloud (CC)6,7 and provide satisfactory quality of service for mobile users (MUs).
Although cloud networks can solve the problem of large-scale traffic offloading, it still faces several crucial challenges.
Firstly, both the CC and ECs need to pay cost such as bandwidth and energy to satisfy the diversified service demands
of mobile users.8-10 Thus, it is necessary to investigate an economic incentive approach to coordinate CC and ECs, where
the revenue and consumption should be considered to determine the pricing strategy for each party. Secondly, the ECs
are managed by different operators. Due to the fragility of management, some ECs are more vulnerable while facing
external attacks, which leads to untrustworthy services.11,12 At the same time, the video contents obtained by MUs are still
vulnerable to modification, castration, and deletion.13,14 Therefore, the credibility of each cloud and service content also
should be taken into account to guarantee the security of multimedia service in hybrid clouds. Motivated by the above
aspects, economic and credible multimedia services are essential for mobile users in hybrid cloud networks.
Even though the existing solutions provide valuable insights in service optimization, most of them lack the joint consid-
eration of economic and security of services in cloud networks, which is urgent to be resolved (a detailed overview of the
state of the art is presented in Section 2). For this purpose, a novel service optimization mechanism based on Stackelberg
game is proposed hereby to effectively achieve the above targets, which is a significant extension of our previous work.15
The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows.
• A credible service provider evaluation scheme is designed according to the interactive behavior to help the mobile users
identify the reliable cloud providers, which is inferred by direct credibility and indirect credibility.
• A blockchain-based content credibility approach is further presented to indicate whether the video content is reliable
and has not been tampered with, which is calculated by a carefully crafted smart contract to audit the video possession
and history records.
• A noncooperative Stackelberg game model is proposed between mobile users and cloud service providers, where the
equilibrium of the game is analyzed by the methods of backward induction and gradient descent.
• Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experiment results validate
the effectiveness of our solution in terms of secure service ratio, utility, pricing, and service requirements.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related work. Section 3 presents the system model
in cloud networks. Section 4 proposes the credible multimedia service mechanism. Section 5 formulates the optimization
problem. Section 6 provides the analysis of the game process. Section 7 conducts the simulation experiment. Section 8
concludes this paper.
2 RELATED WORK
Service optimization and application methods in cloud networks recently attracted the growing attention from the sci-
entific community. In this section, related works on those subjects are summarized and qualitatively compared to our
approach (see also Table 1).
2.1 Cloud network applications
Extensive application research has been conducted on cloud networks. Pan and McElhannon16 propose the method that
an edge cloud node has an offload effect to the central cloud computing platform while lacking the consideration of col-
laboration between these service clouds. Rimal et al17 point out central cloud and edge cloud can coexist and complement
each other in cloud networks, playing a mutually supportive role. Weinman18 considers that the future network is a hybrid
cloud architecture and the distributed edge cloud will complement the central cloud. As each user has the price-optimized
statistics across multiple clouds, these hybrid clouds can be proven to be economically optimal through the dynamic

pricing strategy. Zeng et al19 investigate a green fog computing platform in the cyberphysical system, which jointly con-
siders service data rates, load balancing, and replica deployment to provide the energy-efficient service composition. Jin
and Wen20 propose a novel network function virtualization–based multimedia cloud system, including end-to-end and
layered view perspectives. The authors further describe the architecture ranging from the optimal resource provision
to automated optimization. Experimental results show that the cost of multimedia services provided by network func-
tion virtualization–based cloud system can be substantially reduced. Imagane et al21 design an edge cloud system based
on the OpenStack deployment. This system utilizes the grained service slicing and chaining to achieve the efficient and
low-latency multimedia service provisioning.
Based on the above overview, it can be observed that service applications in cloud networks have recently been exten-
sively studied. However, most of the previous works did not consider the service reliability of applications in cloud
networks.
2.2 Service optimization management
There are increasing researches on service optimization in cloud networks. Nie et al22 consider highly of the security
in cloud platform, but their main purpose is to solve the information privacy rather than the reliability of cloud nodes.
Chen et al23 quantitatively analyze the impact of credibility by stochastic geometry and set the trusted node as high priority
to ensure the security of service. Jimenez et al24 propose a new hybrid cloud architecture to manage the multimedia
resource. The hybrid platform combines multiple cloud computing models and considers both the levels of QoS and
the security of cloud environment. Nevertheless, due to the imbalance of interests of all parties, the economic services
cannot be effectively guaranteed. Zeng et al25 investigate how to reduce the overall cost for purchasing the services from
edge clouds. The authors jointly consider the data scheduling and the network resource allocation without any prior
knowledge. The tradeoff between the queue backlog and the service cost is achieved by using the Lyapunov optimization.
Liu and Liu26 propose a price-based Stackelberg game method to optimize the offloading problem of computing task in
edge clouds. First, a unified and differentiated pricing algorithm is developed to maximize the revenue of the edge cloud.
Then, the users make offloading decisions to minimize their latency and payment cost based on this pricing strategy.
Yuan et al27 investigate a profit maximization approach based on the hybrid heuristic optimization to discover the law
of variation of service prices in hybrid clouds over time. This method can dynamically schedule all arriving tasks for
execution in hybrid clouds while ensuring latency constraints for delay tolerant services. Zeng et al28 present a novel deep
reinforcement learning–based edge computing resource management framework. Based on the framework, the authors
design a mobile autonomously perceived service migration strategy according to the user mobility pattern, which can
minimize the operation cost of services.
Although insightful views have been presented, it is worth noting that few of them coordinate the service security and
cost effectiveness of providers and users in hybrid clouds. In comparison, our focus is on jointly optimizing these two
aspects, aiming to attain the multidimensional service optimization on both sides.

3.1 Network Model
A hybrid cloud network scenario is considered, where multiple ECs execute the offloaded data for the CC (see Figure 2).
We assume that both ECs and CC can provide streaming services to MUs. Specifically, we assume that CC in cloud net-
works can serve for all MUs, denoted by n0. The other cloud service providers e = {1, 2, … ,ne, … ,N} represent ECs.
Meanwhile, the mobile users, denoted by  = {1, 2, …m, … ,M}, are able to access the CC and EC simultaneously. For
convenience, we further let  = {n0} ∪ e denote the set of all providers and let n denote an arbitrary service cloud,
where ∀n ∈ {n0,ne}.
We assume the coverage area of ECs is disjoint. We use the indicator I to indicate whether MU m is within the coverage
area of EC ne. The indicator calculation is shown in Equation (1)
Imne =
{
1, if user m in EC ne,
0, otherwise.
(1)
It is worth noting that provider CC serves for all MUs. Thus, the indicator of CC satisfies: Imn0 = 1.
3.2 Popularity-based cost model
We consider the cloud network system has constant video bitrate requests by mobile users. We assume there are Q dif-
ferent types of videos in cloud network system, with  = {1, 2, … q, … ,Q}. We suppose that video contents are split
in segments and all segments are assumed to be with equal size.29 For video content q, the set of segments is defined
by q = {seg1,q, seg2,q, … segi,q, … segS,q}. Moreover, each user usually completes the entire video service through mul-
tiple requests. Moreover, let qmn represent the amount of video segments requested by MU m to provider n. Thus, the
number of video segments requested by user m in a single timeslot will be less than the total number of video segments
(ie, qmn ≤ |m
q |).
We assume each type of videos has a different measure of popularity reflected by the probability of requests for it. Similar
to previous research works,30,31 the distribution of user requests for videos is defined by a general Zipf distribution as
z(q) = Ω
q𝛾
, q = 1, … ,Q, (2)
where Ω = 1∕
∑
q′∈
1
q′𝛾 , 𝛾 denotes the exponent characteristic of the Zipf distribution, with 0 < 𝛾 < 1. The videos are
ranked by their popularity in cloud networks, and let video q denote the qth popular video, ie, q = 1 means the most
popular video while q = Q denotes the least popular video.
The more video services offered by service clouds, the more profits can be earned by them. Moreover, the more popular
the video is, the less service cost is incurred by clouds. Thus, the service clouds are more willing to provide more of

proportional to the popularity as
cn =

n
z(q)
, (3)
where c0
n denotes the unit service cost of cloud n. Without loss of generality, we define it as a fixed initial value associated
with the caching cost of cloud servers. Besides, we observe that if the value of q is smaller, the service cost cn will be lower.
We assume that the service cloud has no priority for the requesting videos and has all types of videos.
4 CREDIBLE MULTIMEDIA SERVICE MECHANISM
In this section, we elaborate the proposed credible mechanism. Firstly, the credibility scheme of service cloud is pre-
sented to help calculate the security of the service provider. Then the blockchain-based content credibility is introduced
to identify the credibility of the service videos.
4.1 Credible scheme of service cloud
As the service providers (CC and ECs) are deployed by different cloud operators, some providers are honest to pro-
vide multimedia services, while others may conduct malicious attack to threaten mobile users. Namely, the honest
providers' services are trustful, while the malicious providers may be not credible. Therefore, to provide credible multi-
media services for mobile users, the credibility of each provider needs assessment. The credibility can be evaluated by two
aspects, including direct credibility and indirect credibility (as shown in Figure 3), which are denoted by DCmn and ICmn,
respectively.
4.1.1 Direct credibility (DC)
According to the number of interactions between the MUs and providers, one MU can obtain the current subjective
assessment of direct credibility to the provider. We define the direct credibility by two aspects: positive credibility and
negative credibility. First, we denote the assessed credibility via the previous interaction as vk
mn, with 0 ≤ vk
mn ≤ 1.
In addition, with consideration that the influence of interaction interval, the value of credibility needs to multiply by
log( 𝜔
t−tk
+ 1), where t and tk represent the current and kth interaction time, respectively. 𝜔 denotes the decay influence
factor, with 𝜔 > 0. Then, the positive credibility and negative credibility can be defined as

where K denotes the number of interactions between MU m and provider n. Based on the Equation (4,5), the direct
credibility of MU m to provider n can be calculated by Equation (6)
DCmn =
𝜎 · CPositive
mn
PPositive
mn + 𝜂 · CNegative
mn + 𝜓
, (6)
where 𝜓 is the uncertain factor and 𝜎 and 𝜂 are the positive weight factors. From Equation (6), we can observe that as the
number of interactions between MU m and the trusted cloud n increases, the direct credibility of this cloud will continue
to raise. Conversely, if cloud n experiences untrustworthy behavior in a service interaction, his credibility will decrease
rapidly.
4.1.2 Indirect credibility (IC)
In general, the more intimate the relationship, the more trustworthy the MU is. The credible MUs will provide trustful
recommendations. Therefore, when one MU enters the scope of a new EC, he can utilize the direct evaluation of the
surrounding MUs and the relationship in this EC as an indirect credibility. The indirect credibility of each MU can be
defined as
ICmn =
M∑
m′=1,m′≠m
DCm′nrmm′Im′n
M∑
m′=1,m′≠m
Im′n
, (7)
where rmm′ denotes the relationship degree between MU m and MU m′. The relationship degree of MUs can be represented
by matrix R
R =
[ r11 … r1m
… … …
rm1 … rmm
]
s.t. 0 ≤ rmm′ ≤ 1,∀m,m′ ∈ ,
(8)
where rmm′ = 0 denotes that these two MUs have little social relationship and rmm′ = 1 indicates that the social
relationship between the two MUs is very close.
4.1.3 Credibility of service provider (PC)
Then, the value of credibility about MU m to service cloud n can be determined by jointly considering direct credibility
(DC) and indirect credibility (IC). The credibility of MU m to cloud n can be defined as
PCmn = 𝜑mn · DCmn + (1 − 𝜑mn) · ICmn, (9)
where𝜑mn denotes the weight factor of DCmn, with 0 ≤ 𝜑mn ≤ 1. Then, we use variable 𝜀 to represent a trusted threshold,
and when the value of PC is greater than this threshold, it is considered to be trustworthy. On the contrary, it means that
it is not credible.
4.2 Blockchain-based content credibility (BC)
Despite the fact that the credibility of service clouds can be calculated through multiple interactions, the service content
obtained by MUs is still vulnerable to modification, castration, and deletion. When tackling with the content credibility,
video files are large in size, and will be divided into larger amount of segments than a normal file during transmission.
This will result in a heavy calculation. Therefore, we focus on the issue of the credibility of video segments delivered to
MUs by different service clouds. We present a blockchain-based credibility calculation scheme, which utilizes a carefully
crafted smart contract32 to audit the video content through querying and calculating the current video possession and
history records from the service cloud, thus producing a credibility index indicating whether the content is credible. The
whole procedure of calculating the credibility of the service cloud is illustrated in Figure 4.
The proposed blockchain-based scheme is operated by means of a smart contract deployed on a trusted public chain.
The smart contract deployed on the blockchain can be described as Figure 5.

When service cloud n distributes a video to MUs, the segments of the video should be encrypted. Hence, the service
cloud n first requires a key from the smart contract to encrypt the video content. Meanwhile, the smart contract needs to
verify the identity of the requesting service cloud. Before verification, if the identity IDn of service cloud n is not enrolled,
we enlist it in the identity array, which yields  = {ID0, ID1, … IDN}. When the smart contract returns a certain key to
service cloud n, it empowers the service cloud to provide the video by adding it to the playing list of IDn. The encryption
and decryption procedure of video segment si,q can be described as Equation (10)
Li,q ≡ skb
i,q(mod n+),
Lkv
i,q ≡
(
skb
i,q
)kv
(mod n+),
(10)
where Li,q and si,q denote the encrypted and original video segments, respectively. n+ is a large positive integer, and kb
and kv are public key and private key, respectively.
After the above procedure, service cloud n is qualified to distribute the videos. However, when MU m retrieves video
q from cloud n, no prior knowledge for him to know whether cloud n is authorized. Besides, MU m needs to validate
whether the video content is modified through transmission. For this reason, we adopt hash function H(.) to achieve
this goal as it is particularly sensitive to modifications. Specifically, the open addressing method33 can be embraced to
implement the hash function.
Since videos are delivered through segmentation, it is computationally heavy to verify each segment for MUs. Therefore,
we utilize the Merkle tree hash method to verify which segment of the video is modified. Merkle tree34 is a binary tree
that each root is a hash value calculated from its children. As a result, the root of the Merkle tree could represent the
whole video. Any modification will result in a different hash root. The procedure of building a Merkle tree is defined as

root is the root hash value of video q. xi is the hash value of video segment Li,q. Total hash roots owned by cloud n
compose the authorized playing list n = {h1
n, h2
n, … hq
n, …}.
The credibility of video q provided by cloud n can be categorized to three situations, including both video q and cloud n
are registered on the blockchain, only cloud n is enrolled, and the identity of cloud n is not signed up. Therefore, we can
calculate the content credibility based on blockchain as:
BCq
n =
⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩
1, if both the video and cloud are enrolled,
𝜆𝑓norm
(∑Q′
q=1 𝜁nq
)
, else if only cloud is enrolled,
0, otherwise cloud is not enrolled,
(12)
where 𝜆 is a balancing parameter. fnorm(x) is an interval function between [0, 1], which satisfies 𝑓norm(x) = 1
1+x−1 , x > 0. Q
′
denotes the total categories of videos owned by cloud n, with Q′ ∈ . 𝜁nq denotes the credibility of video q provided by
cloud n, which is a positive constant.
The procedure ends with a message dispatched to the service cloud n declaring the capability of delivering the video
q. Afterwards, when MU m requests to fetch the video services, it first poses a query to the smart contract to acquire
the credibility of video q provided by cloud n. The smart contract is responsible of validating both the video content and
the identity of the cloud, and then, the specific credit score will be returned to the MU. The design of smart contract is
described in Algorithm 1.
4.3 Credible degree calculation of multimedia service
When MU m requests video content q from service provider n, the credible degree of multimedia service can be determined
by the joint consideration of provider credibility (PC) and blockchain-based credibility (BC). Thus, the credible degree
(CD) can be defined as
CDq
mn = 𝜆PC · PCmn + 𝜆BC · BCq
n, (13)
where 𝜆PC and 𝜆BC denotes the positive parameters of PCmn and BCmn, respectively.

5 PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, with the credible service mechanism, a game theoretic paradigm for multimedia services among one
central cloud, one edge cloud and MUs is explored to improve the MU's service experience in hybrid cloud networks,
where the interaction process between these three parties is modeled by the Stackelberg game. We first describe the utility
function of each player. Then, we present the optimization strategy for the three parties.
5.1 Utility function
Here, MUs will request the multimedia services from the nearby providers CC and EC simultaneously after assessing the
credible degree of these service providers. In order to obtain benefits and pay for the cost, each provider first determines
the unit service price; then, MUs will purchase the required services from them. To satisfy the requirements of each party,
we need to introduce the utility function for CC, EC, and MUs in the following.
5.1.1 Utility of CC
The utility of provider CC is defined as
Un0 = Pn0 − Cn0 , (14)
where Pn0 and Cn0 represent service revenue and service cost of provider CC n0, respectively.
Intuitively, the more services the MU requests, the more the revenue of CC is. Therefore, we define the revenue function
Pn0 of CC as
Pn0 = pn0
M∑
m=1
qmn0 Imn0 , (15)
where pn0 ∈ [0, pmax
n0
] is the unit service price, which is a nonempty convex and compact subset of the Euclidean space.
qmn0 is the number of video segments requested by MU m to service cloud CC.
According to the popularity-based cost scheme, the service cost function is defined as
Cn0 = cn0
M∑
m=1
qmn0 Imn0 , (16)
where cn0 denotes the service cost of the qth popular video provided by CC.
5.1.2 Utility of EC
Similarly to CC, the utility of provider EC ne can be defined as
Une = Pne − Cne , (17)
Pne = pne
M∑
m=1
qmne Imne , (18)
Cne = cne
M∑
m=1
qmne Imne . (19)
5.1.3 Utility of MU
Here, MUs prefer to purchase credible services from the more trusted providers; hence, the utility function of MU m can
be defined as
Um = 𝜆m log
(
1 + CDq
mne
qmne + CDq
mn0
qmn0
)
− pne qmne − pn0 qmn0 ,
(20)
where 𝜆m denotes the service satisfaction factor of MU m.

5.2 Optimization strategy
The optimal strategies of the three players are analyzed based on their utility functions. Since each party is selfish, the
optimization target of three players can be transformed to the maximization of benefit problem.
5.2.1 Problem 1
For provider CC, the maximum utility can be formulated as
max
pn0
Un0 (pn0 , qmn0 )
s.t.
M∑
m=1
qmn0 ≤ En0 ,
(21)
where En0 represents the transmission capability of CC n0.
5.2.2 Problem 2
Similarly, the optimization problem of provider EC is formulated as
max
pne
Une
(
pne , qmne
)
s.t.
M∑
m=1
qmne ≤ Ene ,
(22)
where Ene represents the transmission capability of EC ne.
5.2.3 Problem 3
Finally, for requester MU, the optimization problem is formulated as
max
qmn0 ,qmne
Um
(
qmn0 , qmne ,p
)
s.t. qmn0 + qmne ≤ |m
q |, (23)
where |m
q | represents the total amount of video segments requested by MU m and p = {pn0 , pne}.
6 GAME OPTIMIZATION
A two-stage noncooperative Stackelberg game is presented to analyze the interactions between the providers and MUs.
The objective is to calculate the Stackelberg equilibrium according to the optimization strategy of the leaders (service
clouds) and the followers (MUs). In addition, the backward induction method and gradient iteration algorithm are utilized
to achieve the Nash equilibrium in this game.
6.1 Game analysis
When the service price is determined by clouds, MUs need to determine the quantity demand from the service clouds.
Note that the determination of MUs is not only affected by the unit service price of CC but also influenced by EC's price
strategy. We present a noncooperative game G =< , ;Un0 ,Une ,Um > to analyze the pricing competitions among CC
and ECs, where the solution of the game is a Nash equilibrium.
Definition 1 (Stackelberg equilibrium). Let p∗
n0
and p∗
ne
denote the pricing solutions for Problem 1 and Problem 2,
respectively. In addition, let q∗ = {q∗
mn0
, q∗
mne
} denote a requirement solution for Problem 3. Then, we can get a

∀m ∈ ,∀n ∈ {n0,ne} .
(24)
We utilize a backward induction method to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. In stage II, based on
the initial service price and credible degree, we study the optimal decision of MUs on the amount of service demand in
order to solve Problem 3. In stage I, according to the requirement decision of MUs q∗ = [q∗
mn0
, q∗
mne
], we further investigate
the optimal strategy of providers CC and EC on the service price. In this case, we can solve Problem 1 and 2 for the optimal
price p∗.
6.2 Strategy analysis of MUs in stage II
To solve the Problem 3, each MU targets the maximization of the utility by deciding its optimal requirement.
6.2.1 Case 1 CC
We first take the derivative of the utility function (23) of MU m with respect to qmn0 as
𝜕Um
𝜕qmn0
=
𝜆mCDq
mn0
1 + CDq
mne
qmne + CDq
mn0
qmn0
− pn0 . (25)
Then, the second derivative of MU m with respect to qmn0 is calculated as in Equation (26)
𝜕
2Um
𝜕qmn0
2 = −
𝜆mCDq 2
mn0(
1 + CDq
mne
qmne + CDq
mn0
qmn0
)2 < 0 . (26)
Obviously, Equation (26) implies that the utility function of MU m exists a maximum value. Then, let the first derivation
Equation (25) be equal to zero; we can calculate the optimal service demand qmn0
∗ of MU m to the provider CC
qmn0
∗ = max
[
𝜆m
pn0
−
1 + CDq
mne
qmne
CDq

. (27)
6.2.2 Case 2 EC
We take the derivative of the utility function of MU m with respect to qmne
𝜕Um
𝜕qmne
=
𝜆mCDq
mne
1 + CDq
mne
qmne + CDq

qmn0

Similarly to Case 1, the optimal service demand qmne
∗ of MU m to the provider EC can be calculated as
qmne
∗ = max
[
𝜆m
pne
−
1 + CDq
mn0
qmn0
CDq

. (29)
According to the optimal service demands of above two cases, we note that the demands to provider is proportional to
the credible degree and is inversely proportional to the service price. Moreover, if the amount of service demands from
EC is reduced, the amount of requirements from CC will increase.

6.3 Strategy analysis of providers in stage I
When the optimal strategy of requirement of MUs is obtained, the price strategy of services will be determined in Stage I.
We first re-evaluate the providers' utility function according to the demand strategy (27, 29) as
Un0 = (pn0 − cn0 )
M∑
m=1
[
𝜆m
pn0
−
1 + CDq
mne
qmne
CDq
mn0
]
Imn0 , (30)
Une = (pne − cne )
M∑
m=1
[
𝜆m
pne
−
1 + CDq
mn0
qmn0
CDq
mne
]
Imne . (31)
From Equation (30, 31), we can note that the utility of the providers depends not only on its own price but also on the
amount of the MU's demands to another provider. In fact, the price decision of these two parties is affected between each
other.
In this case, we make use of the best response to find the Stackelberg equilibrium point. When the price strategy of EC
is given, the best respond function of CC can defined as
pn0 = R
(
pne
)
, (32)
where pne denotes the unit service price of provider EC.
Afterwards, we need to analyze and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium through the following
theorems.
Theorem 1 (Existence). There exists at least one Nash equilibrium for provider CC in the game.
Proof of Theorem 1. Since the unit price pn0 is continuous, bounded, and closed (see Equation (15)), we calculate the
first derivative of utility function un0 with respect to pn0 as
𝜕Un0
𝜕pn0
=
M∑
m=1
[
𝜆mcn0
pn0
2 −
1 + CDq
mne
qmne
CDq
mn0
]
Imn0 . (33)
Then, the second derivative of un0 is calculated as
𝜕
2Un0
𝜕pn0
2 = −
M∑
m=1
(2𝜆mcn0
pn0
3
)
Imn0 < 0 . (34)
Equation (34) implies that the utility function of un0 is a concave function. Namely, the game exists at least one Nash
equilibrium.35 Thus, Theorem 1 is proved.
In order to obtain the optimal price of un0 , we solve the first derivation of Equation (33) as
M∑
m=1
[
𝜆mcn0
pn0
2 −
1 + CDq
mne
qmne
CDq
mn0
]
Imn0 = 0 . (35)
Then, the optimal price of CC can be determined

Theorem 2 (Uniqueness). The noncooperative game has a unique Nash equilibrium for CC.

Proof of Theorem 2. From Theorem 1, we know that there exists a Nash equilibrium for CC. Let p∗
n0
be the optimal
price for provider CC, which satisfies the best response function (32). Then, we need to prove that Equation (36) is a
standard function.
Definition 2. A function R
(
p∗
ne
)
is standard if, for all p∗
ne
> 0, the following properties are satisfied.36
• Positivity: R
(
p∗
ne
)
> 0;
• Monotonicity: If p∗
ne
≥
(
p∗
ne
)′, then R
(
p∗
ne
)
≥ R
((
p∗
ne
)′);
• Scalability: For all 𝛼 > 1, 𝛼R
(
p∗
ne
)
> R
(
𝛼p∗
ne
)
.
1. Proof of positivity
As the amount of demand by MUs is usually positive, the positivity property is satisfied for the best response function
R
(
p∗
ne
)
> 0.
2. Proof of monotonicity
According to the Equation (29), let Θmne =
1
CDq
mne
+ CDq
mn0 qmn0
CDq
mne
. Then, optimal service demand qmne
∗ of MU m to EC
can be redefined as
qmne
∗ = max
[
𝜆m
pne
− Θmne , 0
]
. (37)
Substitute the qmne
∗ into the optimal price of CC, Equation (36) can be rewritten as
p∗
n0
=
√√√√√√√√√√√
M∑
m=1
𝜆mcn0 Imn0
M∑
m=1
(
1
CDq
mn0
+ CDq
mne
CDq
mn0
(
𝜆m
pne
− Θmne
))
Imn0
. (38)
From Equation (32, 38), it can be observed that pne is proportional to the price of R(pne ). Thus, the monotonicity is
proved.
3. Proof of scalability
Since R
(
p∗
−n0
)
and R
(
𝛼p∗
−n0
)
are positive real numbers, to prove the scalability, 𝛼R
(
p∗
ne
)
−R
(
𝛼p∗
ne
)
can be converted
to the following formula:
𝛼R
(
p∗
−n0
)
R
(
𝛼p∗
−n0
) =
√√√√√√√√√√√
M∑
m=1
[

CDq
mn0
+ 𝛼CDq

CDq
mn0
(
𝜆m

Imn0

m=1
[
1
CDq
mn0
+ CDq
mne
CDq
mn0
(
𝜆m
pne
− Θmne
)]
Imn0
. (39)
As 𝛼 > 1 and Equation (39) > 1, 𝛼R(p∗
−n0
) > R
(
𝛼p∗
−n0
)
. Thus, the proof of scalability is completed.
According to the above proofs, the best response function (36) is a standard function. Namely, the noncooperative
game has a unique Nash equilibrium for provider CC.36 Similarly to CC, the best response function pne = R
(
pn0
)
for
EC also has a unique Nash equilibrium.
6.4 Gradient-based iteration algorithm
Based on the above analysis, a gradient-based iteration algorithm (GIA) is designed for the two stage Stackelberg game
(see Algorithm 2).

6.4.1 Analysis of GIA
The target of GIA is to achieve the optimal price strategy based on the credible service mechanism. The novelty of this
algorithm is to incorporate the idea of gradient descent in the best response function, which can achieve the Nash equi-
librium more quickly with less computing power. Firstly, MU m computes the credibility of service cloud n through the
credible mechanism. Then, MU m calculates the credibility of the content q provided by cloud n through the blockchain
method. In addition, MU m determines whether to request the video services from cloud n according to the value of credi-
ble degree. Furthermore, the two-step Stackelberg game begins to execute. Cloud n first makes the decision on the service
price by Equation (36). Next, MU m determines the quantity required based on the credibility and service price of cloud n
in Equation (27). Afterwards, we use the gradient-based descent method to achieve the best game equilibrium, in which
𝜇 denotes the step size. ∇Un (pn) denotes the price gradient with 𝜕Un
𝜕pn
. 𝜀 indicates the threshold of the price change strat-
egy (eg, 𝜀 = 10−4). The algorithm eventually terminates until the price is not falling or the price gradient is less than the
threshold 𝜀.
6.4.2 Algorithm complexity
The complexity of GIA is (||| |), which is proved as follows. For each iteration time, the algorithm complexity is
mainly determined by the sets of MUs and cloud providers. We know that the numbers of MUs and cloud providers are|| and | |, respectively. Thus, the algorithm complexity is (||| |).
7 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, extensive numerical simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
scheme. We first introduce the simulation environment. During the experiment, we assume that there are 1 CC, 8 ECs,
and 30 MUs in hybrid cloud networks. The request process of the video service is continuous. The assessed credibility
of MUs is initialized with vk
mn ∈ [0, 1]. The provider CC is considered to be credible, and ECs are trusted with a certain
probability and set with different values. The service price of CC is more expensive than ECs. As the distance of CC is

farther than EC, the service consumption of CC is assumed to be higher. All simulations are performed over 300 seconds.
The main parameters are shown in Table 2.
7.1 Credible degree analysis
We first perform the credible degree analysis of the proposed method. One CC and four ECs are selected for the credible
degree experiments. Among them, cloud CC, EC1, and EC2 are registered on the blockchain, while the identity of cloud
EC3 and EC4 are not signed up. In addition, the credibility of these service providers (PC) are initialized to 0.8 (CC), 0.7
(EC1), 0.6 (EC2, EC3), and 0.5 (EC4), respectively. After massive experimental tests, we found that when the credibility of
service provider is greater than 0.6, the number of service untrustworthy behaviors will be less, and the service quality is
relatively stable; thus, we set the credible threshold of service providers to 0.6 (ie, one provider with the credibility greater
than 0.6 is considered to be trusted; otherwise, it is not credible).
Figure 6 shows how the changes of the credible degree by a MU to these service clouds over time. It can be seen that
the trust curves of CC, EC1, and EC2 gradually increase as the number of interactions rises. This is because all of them
belong to the high-trust service clouds, and more frequent interactions will lead to higher trust. We can further observe
that the credible degree of EC3 is significantly lower than EC2; this is because EC3 lacks the security check function for
the video content it owns. Moreover, it is observed that the jitter of EC4 is more intense than EC3. This is because the
security protection of EC4 is weaker than EC3, resulting in more vulnerable and more frequent untrustworthy behavior.
This case ultimately leads to a decline of the EC4's credibility.
7.2 Service demand under different price strategies
Then, we analyze the service demands of MUs through different price strategies of hybrid clouds. We first set the initial
unit price of CC to be twice that of EC. Moreover, the credibility of CC is set higher than EC. Figure 7 shows the changes
in MU's service demand under different provider pricing strategies. We can observe that the MU's demand and provider's
pricing fluctuates dramatically at the beginning. As the game process evolves, the demand and pricing curves will gradu-
ally stabilize. In addition, from the enlarged view of the timeline 240 to 300, we know that the MU's demands is inversely
proportional to the provider's pricing, and when the pricing of one provider (eg, CC) increases, the MU's demands for
another provider (eg, EC) will be larger. Until the game reaches equilibrium, the requirements and pricing strategies of
all parties will not change. Besides, note from Figure 7 that although the average price trend of CC is higher than EC, the

demand for CC will be higher than that of EC; this is because MUs would rather spend more money to purchase higher
credible services from cloud provider CC.
7.3 Secure service ratio analysis
We contrast the safety service ratio(SSR) of the proposed method with the latest caching secure method,12 social secure
method,23 and random method.
Safety service ratio (SSR): The proportion of credible segments that can be acquired on service clouds to the total amount
of video segments requested by the MU. Thus, SSR can be defined as SSR(t) = ̃(t)
(t)
, where ̃(t) denotes the number of
credible video segments obtained by the MU during timeslot [0, t] and(t) denotes the total amount of segments requested
by the MU during the same time.
The proportion of trusted ECs in cloud networks is set from 40% to 80%. Figure 8 shows that as the growth of the
trusted proportion, the SSR of four methods will gradually increase and tend to be consistent. Specifically, the SSR of the
caching security method is relatively low because it ignores the security check of the content. The quality of experience
of users will degrade due to the modification, castration, and deletion of contents. In addition, the social secure strategy
uses nodes with intimate relationships to perform reliable services. This method can achieve better security within close
range; however, it excessively relies on social relationships in networks, which has serious limitation. Finally, the proposed
method is superior to the other methods under the same trusted proportion. This is because our approach jointly considers
the credibility of providers and the security of the content. It is worth noting that when the trusted proportion is relatively
low, the advantages of our method will be more obvious.

7.4 Utility analysis of MU
Figure 9 shows the utility of MU under different satisfactory factor and cost consumption. As the factor 𝜆m increases, the
MU's utility gradually rises. This is because 𝜆m characterizes the MU's satisfaction with the credible service. When the
value of 𝜆m is larger, the service satisfaction is higher, and the MU's utility is also increased. Moreover, when the unit cost
consumption of the EC's service is reduced, the MU's utility will also increase. The reason is that the service price of the
EC will decrease as the cost consumption of the EC decreases (see Equation (38)), causing the increase of MU's utility
eventually (see Equation (20)).
7.5 Utility analysis of hybrid clouds
Figure 10 shows the utility of hybrid clouds under different credible degree. The credibility setting of service clouds is the
same as in Figure 6. We observe from Figure 10 that as the credible degree of service clouds increases, so does the utility
of these clouds. The reason is that the service credibility is proportional to the service price (see Equation (36)). When
the cost of service clouds is the same, the service utility of clouds is proportional to the service credibility. As shown in
Figure 10, the service utility will start to jitter at the beginning and will gradually stabilize as time goes by. This is because
as the service interaction continues, the service credibility of hybrid clouds will change, which will result in a change in
the service utility. However, with the arrival of the game equilibrium, both credibility and utility will be stable.

7.6 Pricing analysis of hybrid clouds
Figure 11 shows the pricing strategies of hybrid clouds under different credible degree. Similar to the service utility, as
the service credibility increases, so does the pricing of service clouds. In addition, we note that the lower the credibility
of the service cloud, the greater changes of the pricing strategy at the initial stage. This is because low-security service
clouds are more vulnerable to external attacks, which will lead to poor user satisfaction. In this case, the service cloud
must maintain the utility by reducing the price of the service. Besides, it can be seen that the higher the security of the
cloud, the faster the pricing strategy will be confirmed. This is because the more reliable the service cloud, the more stable
its trust will be; thus, the game equilibrium will converge more quickly.
8 CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents the mechanism to deliver multimedia content in hybrid cloud networks, where both the CC and
EC can provide service to MUs, competitively and collaboratively. Firstly, a secure scheme is designed by the interactive
behavior to evaluate the service cloud's credibility. Secondly, a blockchain-based credibility method is further proposed to
indicate whether the video content owned by service clouds is reliable. Afterwards, the Stackelberg game model based on
the credible mechanism has been investigated to depict the interaction among the cloud providers and MUs. Furthermore,
the equilibrium of the game is obtained by the methods of backward induction and gradient descent, so as to maximize
the secure and economic profit of each party. Finally, extensive simulations prove that the credibility and economy of
multimedia service can be effectively guaranteed in our method.
