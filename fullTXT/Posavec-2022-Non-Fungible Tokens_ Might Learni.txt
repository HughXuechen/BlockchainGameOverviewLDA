Abstract - Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as a variant of tokens 
making up the blockchain, are recently gaining attention with 
different opportunities for the real and virtual assets and 
with potential use cases in decentralized markets, arts, 
gaming and education. This paper gives an overview of the 
NFT concept and its uses and presents the results of the 
survey conducted in Croatia in 2021 with the goal of gaining 
insight into familiarity of respondents with the concepts of 
the blockchain and NFTs. The results of the survey, especially 
when compared to publicly available results of an 
international survey from 2020, indicate that educative 
efforts might be needed in Croatia towards increasing 
knowledge about NFTs taking into account their wide 
potential areas of application.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Although the blockchain technology is best known for 
its usage in cryptocurrency systems, its fundamental 
characteristic of being a distributed database with 
guaranteed fidelity and security of data records makes it  
applicable as a reliable way of storing data about different 
types of transactions (other than financial) as well. 
The conventional definition of a blockchain is that it is 
a fully distributed and decentralized system in which all 
participants are required to follow specific rules for 
achieving data synchronization [1]. In general, a blockchain 
is a shared, trusted, public ledger of transactions, 
inspectable by everyone but which no single user controls. 
In particular, it is a distributed database that maintains a 
continuously growing list of transaction data records, 
cryptographically secured from being tampered with and 
revised [2]. 
Blockchains were initially designed and used for 
financial transactions, whereby the so-called “double 
spending issue” is resolved. Such applications are by 
convention referred to as Blockchain 1.0 [1], with the best 
known example being Bitcoin. Blockchain technology has, 
however, also showed the potential to be used for any kind 
of peer-to-peer value transaction on top of the Internet. The 
blockchain is essentially a kind of a distributed system 
which provides the computational capability for 
applications to run on multiple computation nodes [3].  
With the emergence of Ethereum as the second 
generation blockchain (after Bitcoin), the concept of smart 
contracts was introduced to the blockchain world as a 
powerful feature of blockchain technology. A smart 
contract is computer code which automatically executes all 
or parts of an agreement between two parties and is stored 
on a blockchain-based platform [4]. More specifically, a 
smart contract is a collection of code and data that is 
deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on 
the blockchain network and executed by nodes in the 
blockchain network [5]. Blockchain systems with 
conditionality based on smart contracts are usually referred 
to as Blockchain 2.0, with Ethereum being a typical 
representative [1]. 
Along with smart contracts, decentralized applications 
(DApps) have started to emerge. Decentralized applications 
are applications that operate automatically without the top-
down control by any company or individual. In Ethereum, 
the contract layer is decoupled from the blockchain layer, 
whereby the blockchain itself is used by smart contracts 
that trigger transactions automatically when certain pre-
defined conditions are met. The mechanism of smart 
contracts enables easy development of applications for 
different application contexts and general purpose 
programs [3]. 
The second generation of blockchains has therefore 
extended the purpose of blockchains beyond purely 
transferring cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, for example, with 
its Turing-complete programming language (Solidity) 
offers a generally programmable platform which can be 
used as infrastructure for a variety of decentralized 
applications [6]. 
One of the fundamental concepts of blockchain 
technology is the concept of tokens. In general terms, a 
token is a representation of an asset. Within the blockchain 
technology context, tokenization is the process of 
converting something of value into a digital token usable in 
a blockchain application. Assets tokenized on the 
blockchain can represent tangible assets like e.g., gold, real 
estate or art, or intangible assets such as e.g., voting rights 
or ownership (Table I) [7].

In the blockchain context, tokens can on a general level 
be differentiated as [6] (Figure 1): 
- native (built-in) tokens – tokens that are inherent to 
a blockchain and are needed for any blockchain 
operation as well as for maintaining the blockchain 
itself (sometimes also called protocol tokens); 
- application tokens – tokens that are used by 
applications on top of the blockchain. 
Native and application tokens are usually easily 
interchangeable and have an important role in governing 
the blockchain platforms. Their characteristic of being 
interchangeable or convertible is in the blockchain context 
called fungibility, i.e., these tokens are fungible. 
 
Figure 1.The Ethereum technology stack (adapted from [2] and [6]) 
As opposed to fungible tokens, the concept of non-
fungible tokens (NFTs) has recently emerged in the 
blockchain world and attracted interest in both the 
industrial and the scientific communities, as a unique way 
of attributing ownership to a digital asset.  
The remainder of this paper will focus on non-fungible 
tokens, their current usage and potential as well as related 
challenges. The paper will also present the results of a 
survey conducted in Croatia in 2021 which indicates that 
the concept of non-fungible tokens has not been widely 
adapted given their rising usage potential. 
II. THE CONCEPT OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS 
A. What is a non-fungible token? 
The main idea behind the concept of a non-fungible 
token (NFT) is that it is indivisible and unique. A non-
fungible token stores a complex digital value directly 
attributable to an entity [8]. 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can therefore be used to 
represent ownership of unique items. They enable 
tokenizing artefacts or assets such as art, collectibles or 
even real estate (Figure 2). These tokens have only one 
official owner at a time and are secured by (in most cases) 
the Ethereum blockchain. 
 
Figure 2. Examples of fungible and non-fungible 
 tangible and intangible assets 
As opposed to the concept of “fungibility”, which is a 
property of an asset or a commodity that can be exchanged 
with other assets or commodities of the same type and value 
(e.g., money, “generic” gold bars), “non-fungibility” refers 
to assets or commodities that have unique characteristics 
and are not interchangeable (e.g., real estate, a gold bar with 
a unique artistic engraving). 
B. A short history of non-fungible tokens 
The term “non-fungible token” was, following a 
community consensus, officially coined in the Ethereum 
Standard ERC-721 published in January, 2018 to represent 
a “diverse universe of assets” including physical property, 
virtual collectibles, and negative value assets such as loans 
or responsibilities [9].  
However, the first non-fungible token was actually 
created back in 2014 as an art experiment at a hackathon. It 
represented a video clip by digital artist Kevin McKoy and 
required a Bitcoin-based blockchain to be sold. This non-
fungible token, called “Quantum”, has most recently been 
sold for 1.47 MUSD at a Sotheby’s auction in 2021 [10]. 
A significant amount of development and 
experimenting with non-fungible tokens occurred in the 
period 2014-2016 on the Bitcoin-based platforms, but they 
have really taken off with the Ethereum platform going live 
in 2015 and the majority appearing after 2017. Some of the 
most well-known projects with non-fungible tokens include 
CryptoPunks [11] (a collection of 10,000 unique digital 
characters stored on the Ethereum blockchain), 
CryptoKitties [12] (a blockchain game on Ethereum in 
which players can purchase, collect, breed and sell virtual 
cats), Decentraland [13] (a 3D virtual world browser-based 
platform) and others. 
Interest in non-fungible tokens has significantly 
increased in 2021 with other blockchains (such as Cardano, 
Solana, Tezos, etc.) starting to introduce their own non-
fungible tokens, especially with increased interest in the 
metaverse field. The future will show whether and how 
these trends will continue. 
C. Standards behind non-fungible tokens 
As standards generally describe the underlying 
principles for a technology to function seamlessly, non-
fungible token standards in particular describe how to build 
non-fungible tokens upon a particular blockchain protocol. 
As Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce non-
fungible tokens, and as Ethereum still remains the most 
widely used platform for non-fungible tokens, the 
prevailing standards behind non-fungible tokens are ERC 
standards, where ERC stands for “Ethereum Request for 
Comments”. 
ERC-20 is one of the most significant standards for 
smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for fungible 
token implementations. ERC-20. With the emergence of 
non-fungible tokens, standard ERC-721 was introduced in 
2018 and describes basic functionalities such as 
transferring tokens from one account to another, getting the 
current token balance of an account, getting the owner of a 
specific token and the total supply of the token available on 
the network, as well as some other functionalities [14].

Standard ERC-1155, published in 2018, is a multi-
token standard for smart contracts that can include any 
combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or 
other configurations (e.g., semi-fungible tokens) [14]. 
With the rise of other blockchain platforms supporting 
non-fungible tokens, other standards may be expected in 
the future, but up to October 2021, the only other non-
Ethereum NFT standard is TRC-721 published by the open-
source blockchain TRON [9]. 
III. USES OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS:  
CURRENT AND EMERGING 
The total value of NFTs issued on the Ethereum 
blockchain by the end of October 2021 was estimated at 
14.3 billion USD, up from 340 million USD in 2020, with 
some analysts expecting the value to double in 2022 and to 
reach 80 billion USD in 2025 [15].  
The biggest NFT sales so far have been of digital 
artworks (such as an artwork by digital artist Beeple sold at 
the auction house Christie’s for 69.3 million USD), making 
NFTs for artwork the biggest mainstream use of NFTs 
today [16]. The appeal of NFTs to artists may arise from 
the fact that NFTs are easier, faster and more democratic 
than the traditional art world model. By minting an NFT for 
a piece of artwork, artists can set their own price and define 
royalties and rules for selling the artwork encoded in a 
smart contract, thereby also avoiding high commissions by 
galleries [16]. 
Galleries, museums, libraries and archives have also 
recently begun selling NFTs for works from their 
collections The British Museum, for example, has entered 
the NFT market by partnering with a French start-up 
platform LaCollection and launching two NFT auctions: 
for more than 200 works of the famous Japanese artist 
Katsushika Hokusai in late 2021 and for works of the 
English artist J.M.W. Turner, ongoing at the time of 
submitting this paper [17]. The famous Viennese Belvedere 
has on February 14, 2022 launched an NFT sale of 10,000 
digital pieces of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece “The Kiss”, 
with 3.2 million EUR in sales reached already at the 
morning of the launch [18]. 
Musical artists have also begun entering the NFT arena, 
and NFTs have the potential of being transformative for the 
future of music, as songs, albums, music, lyrics, and 
soundbites can all be protected by NFTs [19]. NFTs can 
enable a fairer compensation to musicians for their work by 
letting them control ownership rights and distribution of 
their work without the involvement of third party platforms. 
Apart from digital artwork, NFTs are used for 
protection and trading of other types of digital collectibles 
such as e.g., virtual real estate, trading (or collectible) cards, 
diamonds, domain names, etc. [20].  
Projects with NFTs for physical or tangible assets are, 
based on publicly available information sources, are in very 
early stages and it remains to be seen how and if those will 
take off. An example is a recent NFT auction of five paired 
digital and physical items by the luxury carmaker 
Lamborghini [21]. Another example is a project within the 
wine industry, including a platform for selling fine wine as 
an NFT (called WIWA) in partnership with wine producers, 
distributors, and merchants worldwide. The goal of the 
platform is to simplify wine trading process by utilizing 
blockchain technology and NFTs, thus creating a more 
transparent, efficient wine ecosystem that encourages trade 
but protects provenance [22]. 
Another use case for NFTs that started to emerge in real 
life is event ticketing. When buying tickets for events, such 
as cultural, entertainment  or sports events in the traditional 
ticketing market, consumers must rely on a third party with 
the risk of buying a counterfeit or fraudulent ticket. An 
NFT-based tickets issued by the blockchain, on the other 
hand, represents a unique asset, whereby the smart contract 
provides a transparent ticket trading platform both for the 
event organizer and the consumer [20]. 
The already flourishing gaming industry may 
experience a further boost with the usage of NFTs. Users 
can create their own or purchase rare digital items in games, 
selling them for profits. This can attract a lot of investors to 
join the games, making NFTs more prominent. 
Furthermore, NFTs enable ownership of items in games 
thereby providing an economic aspect in games to the 
benefit of both developers and players [20]. 
Although still in their early stages, augmented reality 
applications are being embraced by many industries. 
Augmented reality as a technology superimposes digital 
elements upon the real (physical world) and it could highly 
benefit from NFTs for securing the property rights of 
included digital elements, i.e., NFTs could add the missing 
intellectual property and privacy layers needed to create a 
complete augmented reality application [8]. 
A potential use of NFTs to fund research might arise the 
interest of universities and other research institutions 
following a notable initiative of this kind by University of 
California, Berkley. It has, namely, in June 2021 raised 
about 50,000 USD in an auction for an NFT based on the 
Nobel Prize-winning research behind cancer 
immunotherapy. The proceeds of the auction are aimed at 
funding early-stage research with a potential broad impact 
on the society [23]. Another example of a university 
entering the NFT arena is the University of Miami which 
has been auctioning NFTs for a number of memorabilia of 
its football team (“The Miami Hurricanes”) [24]. 
When it comes to using NFTs in the education sector, 
the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering has 
provided students who have completed a sequence of 
courses on the fundamentals of blockchain technology 
certificates of completion through NFTs [25]. Duke 
University is one of the first institutions to provide 
educational credentials as NFTs, and it remains to be seen 
whether this trend will continue in the nearest future. 
Another example of NFTs used in education is the 
example of Preply, a global language e-learning platform, 
which has experimented by rewarding their best language 
tutors with NFTs representing digital artwork [26].  
NFTs have also found their use in COVID-19 digital 
certificates, specifically in the Republic of San Marino 
where those certificates contain two QR codes. One QR 
code aligns with the European Union requirements, while 
the other QR code is linked with an NFT thereby

guaranteeing its digital authenticity and enabling its 
verification [27]. 
The examples presented in this chapter are by no means 
exhaustive but have been selected to illustrate the variety of 
potential NFT uses. 
IV. CHALLENGES WITH NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS  
As with any new technology, a number of challenges 
related to the development and usage of applications need 
to be addressed and subsequently overcome. This chapter 
lists some of the most prominent challenges with NFT 
applications and platforms [9], [20].  
A. Slow confirmation 
Current NFT applications are tightly coupled with their 
underlying blockchains and therefore suffer from their slow 
performance, which makes the confirmation of non-
fungible tokens also quite slow. This is mainly due to the 
underlying blockchain mining protocols used for the Proof-
of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The current trend is 
that most of PoW mechanisms are migrating to faster and 
cheaper mining protocols to overcome this challenge [28]. 
B. Energy consumption 
Perhaps the most notorious challenge with blockchain 
applications arises from their huge energy consumption, 
especially in the light of the increasing awareness of the 
worldwide climate crisis. Current energy expenditures with 
the PoW mechanism are too high and unstainable (as 
claimed by Ethereum in [29]). NFT transactions are even 
more energy consuming because of complex operations 
with contracts requiring significant computational 
resources and storage. 
Attempts at tackling this challenge are largely focused 
on the transition from the PoW to the Proof of Stake (PoS) 
blockchain consensus mechanism. However, the transition 
to the PoS mechanism, while maintaining the essential 
principles of security and integrity, is not trivial ( [29]) and 
requires significant efforts and investments. The future will 
show how this challenge will impact the trends in 
blockchain usage in general. 
C. Security issues 
A system or application using non-fungible tokens 
combines the technology of blockchains, storage and web 
applications. Each of these components are subject to 
security challenges thus making the whole system 
vulnerable. A comprehensive approach towards security 
issues therefore needs to be implemented which must 
address the following security threats [20]: spoofing 
(impersonating another entity, thus violating authenticity), 
tampering (malicious manipulation of data thus violating 
integrity), repudiation (not being able to prove that a 
transaction took place, thus violating non-repudiability), 
information disclosure (exposing information to non-
authorized users, thus violating confidentiality), Denial of 
Service (attacks to the system aimed at making it 
inoperable, thus violating availability) and elevation of 
privilege (gaining permissions beyond those initially 
granted, thus violating authorization). 
D. Problems with broken links 
NFT systems and applications rely on the Ethereum 
blockchain to determine the ownership of digital assets. 
Although this ownership record cannot be altered, it merely 
stores a link to the actual asset. The asset itself is still hosted 
on a conventional URL where its creator originally posted 
it. This URL, just like any other URL on the internet, can 
over time rot or decay (i.e., cease to point to the original 
target because of the target becoming permanently 
available or relocating to a new address). This will mean 
that a link to a digital asset could point to a dead webpage. 
Some of the NFT platforms are attempting to address 
this issue by deploying the InterPlanetary File System 
(IPFS), which is a peer-to-peer (P2P) web-based file system 
and protocol helping to ensure that files are distributed 
across many hosts [9]. IPFS allows content to be accessed 
as long as anyone on its network hosts a copy. IPFS, 
however, does not fully resolve the NFT broken link threat 
as it can also suffer from broken links. Efforts will be 
needed in the future to further address this issue. 
E. Interoperability 
Currently existing NFT ecosystems are mostly isolated 
from each other due to their underlying blockchains. The 
majority of them are fortunately based on the Ethereum 
blockchain, thereby using similar data structures and 
following similar rules. However, with the rise of a variety 
of NFT applications on different blockchains, the 
interoperability of future NFT ecosystems will need to be 
taken into account from the technology and usability 
perspective. 
F. Governance issues 
As any new and nascent technology with applications 
in different domains, non-fungible tokens face the 
challenge of being properly regulated with the 
corresponding markets in different legal systems. The 
services with digital assets, which include cryptocurrency 
exchanges as well as NFT systems, will need to be 
regulated by innovation-friendly suitable regulations.  
Initiatives are already underway in several countries, such 
as the Baltic countries, France and Malta ( [20], [30]), but 
many other countries issues are being resolved by existing 
laws and regulations thereby imposing complex and 
sometimes contradictory terms. Furthermore, issues related 
to intellectual property (IP) of digital assets represented by 
non-fungible tokens need to be taken into account from the 
taxation perspective [20].  
V. RESULTS OF A SURVEY ON FAMILIARITY WITH 
AND USAGE OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS 
With the rise of popularity of non-fungible tokens, an 
international survey [31] was conducted in 2020 by 
Crypto.com, the company operating a large cryptocurrency 
exchange platform of the same name. The survey included 
29,674 respondents, mostly from Europe, North America  
and Asia (a total of 83%), wherein 10% of respondents 
were female and 88% male, as many as 61% were born 
after 1980, and 52% had a university degree or higher. As 
indicated in Figure 3, 47% of respondents have heard of 
NFTs and of those who have heard of NFTs, more than half 
have never used NFTs while only 24% use NFTs on a 
regular basis of every few months or more often. 
703

Furthermore, of those who have heard of NFTs, 24% claim 
to have a good or expert understanding of NFTs, while 63% 
claim to have basic understanding. The survey also 
revealed that 49% of respondents invested in NFTs 
expecting financial gain, while 45% did so because of their 
interest in technology 
 
Figure 3. Respondents having heard of NFTs and  
NFT usage frequency (adapted from [31]) 
The actual types of used NFTs according to the 
Crypto.com survey are illustrated in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Types of used NFTs (adapted from [31]) 
A similar survey of a much smaller scale was conducted 
in May, 2021 as a part of a final thesis by one of the 
coauthors of this paper at the Zagreb School of Economics 
and Management [32]. The survey included 371 
respondents from Croatia, wherein 17% were female and 
83% male, 76% were born after 1980, and 35% had a 
university degree or higher.  
As indicated in Figure 5, only 15% of respondents know 
what an NFT is and of those who do know what an NFT is, 
44% have never used NFTs while only 2% them frequently. 
 
Figure 5. Respondents knowing what an NFT is and 
NFT usage frequency (adapted from [32]) 
The comparison between the results of the international 
survey [31] and the study in Croatia [32] when it comes to 
the frequency of usage of NFTs might be slightly 
misleading when taking into account only respondents who 
actually know what NFTs are. However, if the frequency of 
usage is observed on the total number of respondents, a 
total of 80% of respondents of the survey from [31] have 
never used NFTs, while as many as 92% respondents of  the 
Croatian survey from [32] have never used NFTs. 
The actual types of NFTs used or would be used by 
respondents according to the Croatian survey are illustrated 
in Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6. Types of NFTs used or would be used (adapted from [32]) 
Despite the recent rise in popularity of NFT applications 
in different areas, both surveys mentioned in this chapter 
indicate that a significant proportion of respondents is not 
familiar with the NFT concept, whereby this is especially 
pronounced in the survey conducted in Croatia. These 
results may surely be attributable to the fact that NFTs are 
indeed quite a new concept whose adoption, provided that 
the applications indeed do take off, will take time as with 
any new technological concept. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Despite challenges requiring attention and skepticism 
that may be perceived around non-fungible tokens (NFTs), 
NFTs are currently having a moment, but their long-term 
value and future are still unclear. Arguments are ongoing 
whether NFTs are just a hype or fad, but history has shown 
the need to be careful about dismissing current hypes, as 
the importance of technological innovations often becomes 
clearer once the hype dies down (e.g., the dotcom bubble or 
the initial cryptocurrency enthusiasm) [33]. 
The potential of NFTs in the future can lie in their 
ability to completely change the rules of ownership in the 
digital world, as transactions of changing ownership of 
something have usually depended on layers of 
intermediaries for establishing trust in the transactions. 
With blockchains, recorded transactions are reliable 
because the information cannot be changed, and smart 
contracts can be used to automatically ensure that assets 
change ownership with involved parties respecting their 
agreements. The connected digital world needs to solve the 
problem of digital proof of ownership in all sectors, and 
NFTs might be one of the means for that [33]. 
Given the potential of NFTs in the future, as well as 
their already existing uses and applications, even taking 
into account their future which at the moment may seem 
unclear, the results of both surveys mentioned in this paper 
indicate that the level of knowledge about NFTs can hardly 
be considered as sufficient, especially as indicated by the 
survey conducted in Croatia. Educative efforts might 
therefore be needed both in formal education, but also in 
lifelong learning endeavors, to increase awareness and 
familiarity with the concept of NFTs, Wide areas of 
potential uses of NFTs with the rise of decentralized 
applications as well as many other developments of 
decentralized economies that might happen will have an 
impact on people’s everyday lives. Such developments may 
be expected with the increasing portion of digital natives in

general populations, in the business and academic 
communities.
