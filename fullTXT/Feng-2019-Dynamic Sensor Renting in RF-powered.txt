Abstract—Embedding sensors on wireless devices for collabo-
rative environment sensing has been envisioned as a cost-effective
solution for IoT applications. However, existing IoT platforms
faces challenges, e.g., unsustainablility due to the limited on-
device battery and tremendous cost of deploying middlewares for
centralized task dispatching. In this paper, we employ wireless
energy transfer and permissionless blockchains to construct a sus-
tainable and decentralized IoT crowdsensing platform. Therein,
IoT sensing cloud composed of multiple co-located sensors is
wirelessly powered by RF-energy beacons for data sensing and
transmission. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for
distributed data/transaction verification and trading. The data
users access the crowdsensing service by renting sensors from
the sensing clouds. Both the sensing clouds and data users are
self-interested and aim to maximize their individual profits. The
sensing clouds handle the interference of concurrent wireless
transmissions and the on-chain transaction cost. Meanwhile,
each user distributes its limited budget over the sensing clouds
to optimize the service quality. We formulate a Stackelberg
differential game to analyze the interaction among the sensing
clouds and data users. Then, we investigate the Stackelberg
equilibrium by capitalizing on Pontryagin’s maximum principle.
Furthermore, we provide a series of insightful numerical results
about the Stackelberg equilibrium.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the accelerated development of 5G and Internet of
things (IoT) technologies, a plethora of scenarios now sees
the trend of massive deployment of smart devices for data
collection/analysis and cyber-physical system control. Gartner
Inc. predicts that 14.2 billion IoT devices will be installed
world-wide by the end of 2019, and the number will increase
twofold, reaching more than 25 billion by 2021 [1]. Such wide
use of IoT devices has created unprecedented opportunities
of access to ubiquitous sensing data about the environment
context in concern (e.g., urban environment such as pollution
and traffic condition) for both real-time use and big data-based
analysis. However, it also imposes great challenges to network
operation and data processing. Compared with the conven-
tional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), existing IoT models
are characterized by the feature of high-level decentralization,
hence lacking cooperation due to user deployment and non-
existence of infrastructure operators. Furthermore, the data
generated by the same sensors may be consumed by different
data services, which require various levels of data quality and
sampling frequency for different purposes. For those reasons,
the existing architectures of WSNs are limited in proliferation
due to the high cost of maintaining connections in massive
networks as well as the rigidness of the task-specified data
processing/dispatching frameworks.
In this paper, we study an RF-powered IoT network, where
the user-deployed IoT sensing clouds powering themselves
with the RF-energy transferred from the operator-deployed
power beacons. Unlike conventional WSNs, a number of non-
supplementary sensing tasks are posted by different data users.
The sensing clouds can freely choose different sensing tasks
to which the sensing clouds respond. Due to the nature of
decentralization and task-demand heterogeneity, a series of
challenges are to be addressed in the considered RF-powered
IoT sensing system:
∙ Connectivity: Facing multiple sensing tasks, the RF-
powered sensing clouds need to choose a suitable data
user to which the sensing clouds respond without the help
from a central coordinator.
∙ Reliability: Unlike the conventional WSNs, it is required
that the turstworthiness among different parties can be
established without the help of a central intermediary.
∙ Adaptivity: The considered RF-powered IoT sensing sys-
tem is expected to not only support multiple data sensing
tasks, but also be extensible to serve new data sensing
demands of other users in the future.
To address these challenges without introducing centraliza-
tion at the data processing stage, we resort to the emerging
technology of permissionless blockchains [2] to ensure that
the task assignment, the data collection, storage and trading
are all performed in a decentralized but trusted manner.
The introduction of the blockchain removes the intermediate
layer while enhancing user privacy and data security with
the embedded cryptographic functionalities [2], and the data
integrity is publicly verifiable thanks to the special data
structure built upon the chain of data blocks. In brief, a
permissionless blockchain system can be seen as a replicated
database maintained by a number of pseudonymous nodes over
P2P connections. Blockchains use the public key infrastructure
(PKI) mechanism and the data structure of hash linked list to
ensure that the time order and the content of the corresponding
digest of a data record (also known as a transaction) cannot
be tampered without being discovered once confirmed in the
local replica [2]. The blockchain adopts a certain Byzantine
fault-tolerate (BFT) mechanism, e.g., Nakamoto protocol [3]
or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocol [4],

to coordinate the Byzantine agreement (i.e., peer consensus)
about the state of the transaction storage among the nodes.
In this paper, we propose a novel resource management
framework of RF-powered wireless crowdsensing, where the
wireless network operator is only responsible for providing
the infrastructure of data communication and power beacons
at flat prices [5]. Our designed crowdsensing system involves
four parties, i.e., the massive-scale (wireless) sensors working
as multiple sensing clouds, the wireless network operator
working as a utility provider with a flat-rate pricing scheme
for wireless power transfer, a permissionless blockchain to
handle the data trading, task dispatching and data storage,
and the sensing application schedulers, i.e., data users. As
shown in Fig. 1(a), the IoT sensing clouds are connected to
the permissionless blockchain through the backhaul provided
by the wireless network operator. The blockchain enables
smart contracts in the form of programmable automata on
the chain [6], with which the sensing clouds and the data
users are able to deploy their own sensing cloud service access
contracts or choose some of them to answer to. The sensing
data is delivered by the sensing clouds to the data users via the
logical links established on the blockchain, and the data is en-
capsulated as transactions over the blockchain. Note here that
the service access and data delivery processes are completely
self-organized in the form of smart contract, without the need
of any help from an intermediary controlled by the operator.
Then, from the perspective of the sensing clouds and the data
users, the blockchain can be seen as a decentralized platform
as a service (see Fig. 1(b)) and the details about the blockchain
network organization are completely hidden behind the smart
contract interface. With our proposed crowdsensing system,
the following key performance properties are satisfied:
∙ The data (i.e., transaction) throughput of the blockchain
scales well such that the massive data volume from the
sensing clouds is handled smoothly.
∙ The sensing clouds are able to work in a self-orgainzed
manner with limited coordination among themselves.
∙ The sensing clouds are rational and each of them indepen-
dently decides on its own sensing/transferring schedule
for revenue optimization.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model. Section III presents the formula-
tion of a Stackelberg differential game. Section IV analytically
analyzes the equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg differ-
ential game. Section V presents the numerical performance
evaluation. Section VI concludes the paper.

that sensing cloud 𝑖 can receive. Let 𝑐𝑖 be the power of
sensing cloud 𝑖 used for circuit maintenance and data sensing,
the power used by sensing cloud 𝑖 to transmit data to the
blockchain for trading is therefore 𝑝𝑖 − 𝑐𝑖. The propagation
model of sensing cloud 𝑖 follows (1) by the free-space
propagation model and consider the path loss as a function
of the distance between sensing cloud 𝑖 and the access point
connected to the blockchain, i.e., 𝑑𝑖. Let r = [𝑟𝑖]𝑖∈𝒩 be
the vector of the transmission rates and p = [𝑝𝑖]𝑖∈𝒩 be the
vector of received powers. Likewise, let p−𝑖 be the vector of
the received powers except sensor 𝑖, the transmission rate of
sensing cloud 𝑖 can be derived as follows:

where 𝜎2 is the noise, 𝑔𝑖 is the channel gain of sensing cloud 𝑖,
and ℎ𝑖 is the bandwidth of sensing cloud 𝑖. We define R (p) =
[𝑅𝑖 (𝑝𝑖,p−𝑖)]𝑖∈𝒩 , and R (p) : 𝒟p = ×
𝑖∈𝒩
𝒟𝑝𝑖

There is a set of users, denoted by 𝒦, who want to rent
sensors from the sensing clouds. The users rent a portion of
the sensors in each sensing cloud by setting the smart contract
with the sensing clouds through blockchain. The rented sensors
collect data and send the data to its corresponding sensing
cloud. Then, the sensing cloud transmits the data to the users
by wireless transmission. Due to the limited transmission rates
of the sensing clouds, the sensing cloud determines the data
transmission rate for each user based on the portion of its
sensors rented by the user. The portion of the sensors rented by
the user in each sensing cloud depends on the percentage of the
sensing cloud’s total revenue from the user. Each user 𝑘 ∈ 𝒦
has a budget of 𝑤𝑘 for renting the sensors. Let 𝑥𝑖𝑘 denote the
ratio of user 𝑘’s budget paid to sensing cloud 𝑖, sensing cloud
𝑖 will accordingly receive the revenue of 𝑥𝑖𝑘𝑤𝑘 from user
𝑘 and provides the data at the rate of 𝑥𝑖𝑘𝑤𝑘∑
ℎ∈𝒦
𝑥𝑖ℎ𝑤ℎ
𝑅𝑖 (𝑝𝑖,p−𝑖)
to user 𝑘, where
∑
ℎ∈𝒦
𝑥𝑖ℎ𝑤ℎ is the total revenue of sensing
cloud 𝑖. Therefore, the utility of user 𝑘 obtained from the data
collected by its rented sensors in sensing cloud 𝑖 is
𝑈𝑖𝑘

⎟⎠− 𝑥𝑖𝑘𝑤𝑘, (2)
where Ψ𝑖𝑘 (⋅) is a continuous and increasing concave function
representing the benefit that the user 𝑘 can obtain from the
data provided by sensing cloud 𝑖 [7]. Ψ𝑖𝑘 (⋅) depends not only
on the transmission rate of the data but also on the quality
and type of the data. The higher the quality of the data is,
the higher utility that the user can achieve. Also, the type
of the data can affect the users’ utilities. For example, if the
user wants to estimate the road traffic jam in a city while the
sensing cloud provides the data concerning the weather, the
user will obtain less utility from the data concerning weather
than that from the data of road traffic.
We assume that the smart contract service is implemented
based on a framework of sharded blockchain. According to
the protocol in [8], by assuming a fixed transaction data
size, the transaction throughput of the sharded blockchain
is linearly related to the transmission rate. Moreover, the
computational power admitted by the sharded blockchain
is a linear function of the transaction throughput [8] and
hence is a linear function of the transmission rate. Without
loss of generality, the computational power of the sharded
blockchain required to support the total transmission rate from
all the sensors, i.e.,
∑
𝑗∈𝒩
𝑅𝑗 (𝑝𝑗 ,p−𝑗), is 𝑚
∑
𝑗∈𝒩
𝑅𝑗 (𝑝𝑗 ,p−𝑗),
where 𝑚 > 0. Furthermore, since the energy consumption
of the sharded blockchain is convexly related to its com-
putational power [9], a quadratic functional form can be
adopted to describe the relationship between the computational
power and its corresponding energy consumption [10]. There-
fore, the energy consumption of the sharded blockchain is
Υ
(
𝑚
∑
𝑗∈𝒩
𝑅𝑗 (𝑝𝑗 ,p−𝑗)
)
, where Υ(⋅) is a quadratic function
and hence an increasing convex function.
To enjoy the data service (e.g., smart contracts and trans-
action recording) provided by the sharded blockchain, sensing
cloud 𝑖 needs to pay a transaction fee to compensate the cost of
the consensus nodes, e.g., incurred from energy consumption.
We assume that the sensing clouds proportionally share the
blockchain maintenance cost among themselves according to
the volume of data that they propose to the blockchain. Then,
the payment of sensing cloud 𝑖 based on its fraction of the
total transmit rate is 𝑅𝑖(𝑝𝑖,p−𝑖)∑

Let 𝜙 denote the price of unit power transferred from the RF-
energy beacons. To support the wirelessly received power level
𝑝𝑖 for sensing cloud 𝑖, the wirelessly transferred power level
of the RF-energy beacons 𝑖 is 𝑃 t (𝑝𝑖, 𝑑

𝑖) = 𝑝𝑖 (𝑑

𝜂 based on
the Slivnyak-Meckes theorem [11], where 𝜂 is the path-loss
exponent of wirelessly power transfer and 𝑑t𝑖 is the distance
between the RF-energy beacons and sensing cloud 𝑖. The total

For the convenience of analyzing the Stackelberg equilib-
rium of the Stackelberg differential game in Section IV-B, we
let the sensing clouds maximize their profits by deciding on
their transmission rates instead of their received powers. This
is due to the fact that the vector of the functions describing the
relationship between r and p, i.e., r = R (p), is a continuous
closed injective operator as shown in Theorem 1. This means
that there exists an inverse operator of R (p) denoted by
R−1 (r) : 𝒟r �→ 𝒟p such that the power consumption of
the sensors, i.e. p, can be determined by their transmission
rates, i.e., r.

⊤ is injective.
We apply the proof by contradiction method to prove
that Λ (𝜷 (𝒑)) is injective. We assume that Λ (𝜷 (𝒑)) is not
injective. Then, there exist p′ ∕= p and p′, p ∈ 𝒟p such that
r′ = r. Without loss of generality, we assume 𝑝′𝑖 > 𝑝𝑖. As

and 𝛽𝑖 (𝑝𝑖), ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝒩 , R (p) is an injective operator. Further-
more, since R (p) is continuous closed operator, its inverse
operator, i.e., R−1 (r), exists and the proof is completed.
Then, according to Theorem 1, the profit of sensing cloud

III. A STACKELBERG DIFFERENTIAL GAME
FORMULATION
In this section, we model the interaction between the sensing
clouds and the users as a Stackelberg differential game. In
the lower level of the game, the interplay among the users
is formulated as an evolutionary game by using replicator
dynamics. In the upper level, the sensing clouds determine
their transmission rates in a continuous time space.
A. A Lower-Level Evolutionary Subgame Formulation
In the proposed evolutionary game framework, the users
evolve their sensing cloud rental strategies to rent the sensors
from the sensing clouds through blockchain. The reason that
the users are in the same level, i.e., lower-level is that they have
the same set of information and make decisions simultaneously
by observing each other’s strategies. This is different from
the sensing clouds that usually rent out the sensors first and
then collect data for the users. Hence, the sensing clouds are
considered to be the leaders and their problems are defined in
the upper level.
With the utility of user 𝑘 from sensing cloud 𝑖 defined in (9),
the average utility of user 𝑘 from all the sensing clouds is
expressed by
𝑈𝑘 (x𝑘,X−𝑘, r) =
∑
𝑖∈𝒩
𝑥𝑖𝑘𝑈𝑖𝑘
(
𝑥𝑖𝑘,x𝑖−𝑘
, 𝑟𝑖
)

⎟⎠− 𝑥𝑖𝑘𝑤𝑘
⎤
⎥⎦ .
(10)
Then, by the pairwise proportional imitation protocol [12] and
given the sensing clouds’ transmission rates, i.e., 𝑟𝑖, the repli-
cator dynamics yields the following lower-level evolutionary
subgame, i.e., a system of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs):
∇𝑡𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) = 𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡)×[
𝑈𝑖𝑘

𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) ,x𝑖−𝑘

]
,
(11)
with initial strategies, i.e., Dirichlet boundary condition,
𝑥𝑖𝑘 (0) = 𝑥0
𝑖𝑘, ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝒩 , ∀𝑘 ∈ 𝒦.

According to (8), the instantaneous profit of sensing cloud
𝑖 at time 𝑡 is given by
Π𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) , r−𝑖 (𝑡),x𝑖 (𝑡)) =

Note that the Stackelberg differential game in (14) is to
maximize the cumulative profit of the sensing clouds taking
the strategy evolution processes of the users’ strategies as the
constraint. In other words, these strategies indicate the states
of the sensing clouds.
IV. EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
We analyze the equilibriums of the lower-level evolutionary
subgame and the Stackelberg differential game in this section.
We first use the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem in [13] to prove
the uniqueness of the solution to the lower-level evolutionary
subgame in Theorem 2. Then, by using the Lyapunov’s second
method for stability, i.e., Lemma 1, we prove the stability
of the solution to the lower-level evolutionary subgame in
Theorem 3. At last, we prove that there exists a Stackelberg
equilibrium in Theorem 4.
A. Solution to Lower-Level Evolutionary Subgame
Firstly, we investigate the uniqueness of the solution to
the lower-level evolutionary subgame defined in (11), i.e., the
uniqueness of the evolutionary equilibrium.
THEOREM 2. For any given r (𝑡) = rgiven ∈ Dr, the lower-
level evolutionary subgame defined in (11) is uniquely solvable
and hence admits a unique evolutionary equilibrium.
Proof: The uniqueness of the solution to the lower-level
evolutionary subgame can be validated by using Cauchy-
Lipschitz theorem in [13]. Due to the limited space, we omit
the proof.
Lemma 1. Lyapunov’s second method for stability [14]:
Consider the system of ODEso
∇𝑡y (𝑡) = F (y (𝑡) , 𝑡) , ∀ 𝑡 ∈ 𝒯 , y (0) = y0. (15)
Provided that there exists a function 𝑉 (y (𝑡)) : ℝ𝑛 �→ ℝ such
that
∙ 𝑉 (y (𝑡)) = 0, if y (𝑡) = 0,
∙ 𝑉 (y (𝑡)) > 0, if y (𝑡) ∕= 0,
∙ ∇𝑡𝑉 (y (𝑡)) = d
dy(𝑡)𝑉 (y (𝑡)) × d
d𝑡y (𝑡) = (∇y𝑉 )
⊤ ×
∇𝑡y (𝑡) = (∇y𝑉 )
⊤ ⋅ F (y (𝑡), 𝑡) ≤ 0, i.e., negative
semidefinite, for all values of y (𝑡) ∕= 0,
then the solution to the system of ODEs defined in (15) is
stable.
THEOREM 3. For any given r (𝑡) = rgiven ∈ 𝒟r, the lower-
level evolutionary subgame defined in (11) admits a stable
evolutionary equilibrium.
Proof: By adopting the Lyapunov’s second method for
stability introduced in Lemma 1, we design a Lyapunov
function as follows:
𝑉 (X (𝑡)) =
⎡
⎣ ∑
𝑖∈𝒩 , 𝑘∈𝒦
𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡)
⎤
⎦
2
, (16)
where 𝑉 (X (𝑡)) : 𝒟X �→ ℝ satisfies
𝑉 (X (𝑡))
{
= 0, ifX (𝑡) = 0 ∈ 𝒟X,
> 0, otherwise.
(17)
With any given r (𝑡) = rgiven ∈ 𝒟r, the first derivative of
𝑉 (X (𝑡)) with respect to 𝑡 is given in (18). This means that
∇𝑡𝑉 (u (𝑡) ,v (𝑡) ,x (𝑡)) is negative semidefinite, i.e., ≤ 0.
According to Lemma 1, the lower-level evolutionary subgame
defined in (11) admits a stable evolutionary equilibrium. The
proof is then completed.
B. Solution to Stackelberg Differential Game
For the formulated Stackelberg differential game, Pon-
tryagin’s maximum principle [15] can be used as necessary
optimality conditions to find the optimal strategies. With Pon-
tryagin’s maximum principle, a Hamiltonian system could be
established for the Stackelberg differential game. In this case,
we denote the right side of the first constraint in our formulated
Stackelberg differential game, i.e., (14), as 𝜃𝑖𝑘 (X (𝑡) , r (𝑡)).
Accordingly, the present value Hamiltonian function can be
defined as follows:
𝐻𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) , r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,X (𝑡) ,𝝁𝑖 (𝑡)) =
Π𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) , r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,x𝑖 (𝑡)) +
∑
𝑘∈𝒦
𝜇𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) 𝜃𝑖𝑘 (X (𝑡) , r (𝑡)) , (19)
where 𝝁𝑖 (𝑡) = [𝜇𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) , . . . , 𝜇𝑖𝑘 (𝑡)]
⊤ and 𝜇𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) is the
costate variable of sensing cloud 𝑖 associated with 𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡). With
the definition of the Hamiltonian function, the corresponding
maximized Hamiltonian function is defined as follows:
𝐻∗
𝑖 (r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,X (𝑡) ,𝝁𝑖 (𝑡))
=max
𝑟𝑖(𝑡)
{𝐻𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) , r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,X (𝑡) ,𝝁𝑖 (𝑡))∣ 𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) ∈ 𝒟𝑟𝑖} . (20)
As proven in the optimal control theory, the optimal strategy
of the original problem must also maximize the correspond-
ing Hamiltonian function. Therefore, all candidate optimal
strategies have to satisfy the following necessary optimality
conditions:
0 =
∂𝐻𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 (𝑡) , r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,X (𝑡) ,𝝁𝑖 (𝑡))
∂𝑟𝑖 (𝑡)
, (21)
�̇�𝑖𝑘 (𝑡) = 𝜇𝑖𝑘 (𝑡)− ∂𝐻∗
𝑖 (r−𝑖 (𝑡) ,X (𝑡) ,𝝁𝑖 (𝑡))
∂𝑥𝑖𝑘 (𝑡)
, (22)
where (22) is the adjoint equation to describe the dynamics of
a costate variable.
THEOREM 4. For the Stackelberg differential game defined
in (14), the candidate strategy of the sensing clouds, i.e., r∗ (𝑡),
is a Stackelberg equilibrium.
Proof: We use the Pontryagin’s maximum principle [15]
to construct the candidate equilibrium strategy r𝑖 (𝑡). More-
over, 𝒟X is a convex compact set, and Theorem 2 has proven
the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the lower-
level evolutionary game in (11) with any given r (𝑡) ∈ 𝒟r.

According to these conditions, we can state that the obtained
strategy of the sensing cloud together with the obtained
users’ sensing cloud rental strategies constitute the Stackelberg
equilibrium.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct extensive numerical studies to
evaluate the performance of the players in the Stackelberg
differential game. For ease of illustration, we consider a
crowdsensing platform containing 5 sensing clouds and 3
users, i.e., 𝑁 = 5 and 𝐾 = 3, over the time space of
𝒯 = [0, 20]. The vector of the distances between the access
point connected to the blockchain and sensing clouds is
d = [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5] while the vector of the path
loss coefficients is 𝜶 = [2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3] and the noise
is 𝜎2 = 1. Moreover, the vector of the channel gains
is 𝒈 = [7.65, 7.8, 7.95, 8.1, 8.25] and the vector of the
bandwidths is 𝒉 = [40.1, 40.2, 40.3, 40.4, 40.5]. The price
of the power received by the sensing clouds is 𝜙 = 0.01,
the vector of the distance between the RF-energy beacons
and sensing clouds is dt = [𝑑t𝑖] = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5], and
the path-loss exponent of wireless power transfer is 𝜂 = 2.
Without loss of generality, the quadratic functional form
for the energy consumption of the sharded blockchain, i.e.,
Υ(⋅), is Υ(𝑧) = 𝑎𝑧2 + 𝑏𝑧 + 𝑐, where the coefficients are
𝑎 = 0.01, 𝑏 = 0.01, and 𝑐 = 0.01. The coefficient describing
the linear relationship between the computational power of
the sharded blockchain and its supported total transmission
rate 𝑚 = 0.1. For the utility function Υ(𝑧), we adopt
Ψ𝑖𝑘 (𝑧) = 𝐴𝑖𝑘 −𝐵𝑖𝑘 × 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝐶𝑖𝑘𝑧) from [7]. The coefficient
matrices of the users’ utility functions are A = B = C =
[3.2, 3.5, 3.3; 3.5, 3.4, 3.4; 3.4, 3.3, 3.5; 3.1, 3.1, 3.1; 3.3, 3.2, 3.2].
The initial strategies of the users’ are x0
𝑘 =
[0.325, 0.175, 0.275, 0.125, 0.1], ∀𝑘 ∈ 𝒦. The vector of
the budget is w = [5.1, 5.2, 5.3].
A. Numerical Results
1) Demonstration of the stability of evolutionary equilib-
rium: The stability of the evolutionary equilibrium can be
verified by using the direction fields of the replicator dynamics.
We use the evolutionary process of the users’ sensing cloud
rental strategies on sensing clouds 1 and 3 as examples.
The direction fields between 𝑥21 and 𝑥11, 𝑥31 and 𝑥11 are
shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2,
any unstable strategy will follow the blue arrows to reach
its corresponding evolutionary equilibrium, which is marked
by the black circle. This demonstrates the convergence and
stability of the evolutionary equilibrium and is consistent with
Theorem 3.

Figure 3: Evolutionary Equilibrium
2) Dynamic strategies: We next investigate the dynamic
strategies of the lower-level evolutionary subgame from the
initial strategies, i.e., x0
𝑘 = [0.325, 0.175, 0.275, 0.125, 0.1],
∀𝑘 ∈ 𝒦. The dynamic strategies of the lower-level evolu-
tionary subgame are subject to the control of the sensing
clouds’ transmission rate strategies. The dynamic change of
the strategies in the lower-level evolutionary subgame indicates
the adaptation of the users’ sensing cloud rental strategies.
As shown in Figs. 3(b), (c), and (d), the strategies of the
lower-level evolutionary subgame converge to the evolutionary
equilibrium at which none of the users wants to change
their strategies unilaterally. Although the sensing cloud 1’s
initial transmission rate, i.e., 𝑟1, is at a high value due to
the shortest distance between sensing cloud 1 and the access
point connected to the blockchain, i.e., 𝑑1 = 5.1, as well
as the smallest path loss coefficient, i.e., 𝛼1 = 2.6, among

these five sensing clouds, the budget ratios on sensing cloud
1 of both users 1 and 3, i.e., 𝑥11 and 𝑥13, decrease from
the initial large values to the small values at the evolutionary
equilibrium. The reason is that the users’ preferences of the
sensing cloud depend not only on their data transmission rate
but also on their data type. As a result, the profit of sensing
cloud 1 decreases. In this case, sensing cloud 1 decreases
its transmission rate to lower its cost and hence achieve its
cumulative profit maximization. In contrast, due to a small
initial transmission rate of sensing cloud 2, i.e., 𝑟2, as shown
in Fig. 3(b) and the users’ preference of its data type, sensing
cloud 2 cannot provide the data optimally. In this case, the
transmission rate of sensing cloud 2 increases from the initial
value to the larger value at the evolutionary equilibrium.
Accordingly, all the rational users’ budget ratios on sensing
cloud 2, i.e., 𝑥21, 𝑥22, and 𝑥23, increase from the initial small
values to the large values at the evolutionary equilibrium as
shown in Figs. 3(b), (c), and (d).
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented a hierarchical dynamic game framework
to analyze the strategies of the sensing clouds and the users in
the crowdsensing market under the permissionless blockchain
as a decentralized but trusted trading platform. The interaction
among the sensing clouds, the blockchain, and the users has
been modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg differential game.
Specifically, the dynamics of the users’ sensor rental strategies
are captured by the replicator dynamics in the lower-level
evolutionary subgame. The stability and uniqueness of the
evolutionary equilibrium have been validated both analyti-
cally and numerically. The stable and unique evolutionary
equilibrium has been obtained as the solution to the lower-
level evolutionary subgame. Taking into account the lower-
level evolutionary subgame, the transmission rate determina-
tion problem of the sensing cloud has been formulated as a
Stackelberg differential game. Moreover, we have provided
a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the
equilibrium of the game. For the future work, we will further
include the blockchain as a player.
