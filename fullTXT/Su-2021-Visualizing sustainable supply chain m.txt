Abstract: Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has been attracting extensive attention
from both practitioners and scholars. The main objective of this paper is to visualize and conduct a
systematic scientometric review on 9151 articles and reviews published from 2007 to 2021. Research
techniques of co-author analysis, co-word analysis, and co-citation analysis are applied to reveal
the social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure of the SSCM field, identify
main concepts and research hotspots, and illuminate major specialties and emerging trends. The
results of this work show that: (1) the top five most productive scholars are Joseph Sarkis, Kannan
Govindan, Minglang Tseng, Angappa Gunasekaran, and Charbel Jose Chiappetta Jabbour. The
top five most productive institutions are Hong Kong Polytech University, Islamic Azad University,
University of Southern Denmark, Dalian University of Technology, and University of Tehran. (2)
The main concepts include sustainable supply chain management, green supply chain management,
circular economy, corporate social responsibility, and reverse logistics. The research hotspots of
the SSCM field, currently, are game theory and circular economy related topics. (3) The leading
researchers and influential journals are also identified. The emerging trends include sustainable
supplier selection, circular economy, cap-and-trade regulation, blockchain technology, big data
analytics, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the best-worst method and logistics performance. Finally,
limitations and future researches are discussed. We expect this paper will show a big picture of the
SSCM field for researchers as well as practitioners.

1. Introduction
The last decade has witnessed more and more attention from both practitioners and
scholars on the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) domain, which takes environ-
mental, social, and economic outcomes into consideration across a focal firm’s supply chain
process. More and more enterprises realize the importance of sustainable development
and construct sustainable supply chain systems to implement SSCM. To tackle the severe
threat and high level of uncertainty due to disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic [1],
demand uncertainty [2,3], a challenging market, combined with pressure from stakeholders
(competitors, end-users, or governments, etc.) [4], reputational risk [5], and corporate social
responsibility [6], firms make SSCM a strategy so as to ensure long term benefits and
achieve a competitive position in the market. SSCM practices, such as adopting green
human resource management [7–9], applying environmental management systems [10,11],
and evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers [12–14], are implemented by firms in
their internal management and external supply chains’ operations.
Therefore, it is no wonder that SSCM has aroused the interest of scholars. The em-
pirical and conceptual papers concerning SSCM topics have been growing significantly,
which indicate that SSCM has evolved into a significant separate stream of supply chain
management or a new stage of supply chain management, which was believed by the study

of [15]. In recent years, SSCM scholars have been exploring various scenarios and propos-
ing new findings and designs through scientific studies, such as implications of blockchain
technology on SSCM [16,17], approaches and algorithms for sustainable supplier evalu-
ation and selection [18–21], drivers or factor influencing the adoption of SSCM [22–24]
and so on, which have contributed significantly to the development and evolution for
SSCM research. Indeed, with the development of the SSCM field, there are several closely
related concepts paid much attention to by scholars as well, including corporate social
responsibility (CSR), green supply chain management (GSCM), responsible supply chain
management (RSCM), sustainable procurement (SP), and green procurement (GP). On the
one hand, these concepts share some similarities, which put more emphasis on social and
environmental obligations and responsibilities. On the other hand, they have some signifi-
cant differences. CSR can be classified into internal and external CSR, of which the former
focuses on employee health and safety, work-life balance, diversity, equal opportunity,
and so on, whereas the latter includes firms’ community, philanthropy, and environmental
programs and activities concerning the external reputation of the organization [25]. GSCM
integrates environmental thinking into supply chain processes [26] such as waste manage-
ment, cleaner production and technologies, whereas RSCM encapsulates socially and/or
environmentally responsible supply chain issues [27]. In addition, both SP and GP embody
concern for social, environmental, and economic aspects within procurement processes [28],
excluding product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing processes, and
so on. Based on previous studies [29–32], SSCM can be defined as a process of planning,
organizing, leading, and controlling to coordinate material, information, and capital flows
along the supply chain through continuous innovation and decision-making, in order to
realize an organization’s social, environmental, and economic goals, which are derived
from stakeholder requirements over the short and long term. Comparing with the above
relevant concepts, SSCM includes the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability (economic,
environmental, and social). Therefore, in this study, we focus specifically on SSCM.
The development of SSCM research is a dynamic and accumulating process related to
research paradigms and scientific research projects in this field and will also be affected
by the development of relevant technologies and research fields, such as the development
of big data technology, algorithm optimization, etc. The literature review can outline
the existing framework, theoretical research, and empirical contributions, and clarify
the emerging trends of SSCM research. Several literature reviews have been conducted,
many of which focus on a particular issue or aspect, such as blockchain technology for
SSCM [33], stakeholder pressure in SSCM [4], SSCM in global supply chains [34] or the
automotive industry [35]. Due to the increasing number of research papers on SSCM and
increasingly diversified disciplines involved, these literature reviews, which are based on
personal subjective judgment [36] and depend on the research level of scholars, cannot
objectively and comprehensively reflect the knowledge structure, evolution, and trend
of SSCM. However, there are limited bibliometric literature reviews on SSCM [37,38] to
help us gain a better understanding and overview of the evolution of this field. This paper
seeks to fill in this gap to reveal social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual
structure, identify main concepts and research hotspots, and illuminate major specialties
and emerging trends. As such, we explore the following main research questions:
RQ1: What is the social structure of the SSCM field?
RQ2: What is the conceptual structure of the SSCM field?
RQ3: What is the intellectual structure of the SSCM field?
We visualize and conduct a systematic scientometric review on 9151 publications
spanning from 2007 to 2021. CiteSpace software is used in this paper to conduct co-author
analysis, co-word analysis, and co-citation analysis [39]. The above analysis methods
are all derived from the co-occurrence analysis technique, which is based on the basic
assumption that when two authors, keywords, cited references, or other items appear in
the same record, they can be considered to be related to some extent [36]. Comparing with
prior studies, the novelties of the study are as follows. First, we reveal social structure,
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 3 of 25
conceptual structure, and intellectual structure for the first time by using the bibliometric
method, which can help readers understand the SSCM field from different dimensions.
Second, we first collect a bibliographic dataset of SSCM area through both a query-based
search approach and a citation expansion search method, which is considered more repre-
sentative and comprehensive. Compared with traditional literature review, there are some
specific advantages using CiteSpace software to conduct this systematic bibliometric re-
view, which can help us obtain more objective research topics, track the development trend
and evolution of knowledge structure, and can be complementary to a traditional literature
review [40,41]. CiteSpace software can help scholars quickly focus on key information and
identify the knowledge structure and evolution of a certain knowledge field. We expect
this paper will show a big picture for researchers as well as practitioners.
The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, based on the analysis of co-
authorship network and their institutions’ network, we reveal relationships of collaboration
and identify scholars and institutions that are most productive or located in structural holes.
Second, based on the analysis of co-occurring keywords network, we identify the main
concepts and research hotspots of the SSCM field. Third, based on the analysis of author,
journal, and document co-citation network, we identify leading researchers, influential
journals, emerging trends, and major milestones in the development and evolution of the
SSCM field.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 provides retrieval strategy and
process about our data, and explains the methods we used. Section 3 reports results of
social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure of the SSCM field. Finally,
the paper ends with conclusion and discussion, including main findings and contributions,
limitations, and future researches.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Material Collection
2.1.1. Retrieval Strategy
The literature review of SSCM using CiteSpace software takes a bibliographic dataset,
whose quality measured by recall and precision from the perspective of information
retrieval as the basis of subsequent analysis. Therefore, formulating an optimal retrieval
strategy in advance is of prime importance and significantly challenging, especially when
we attempt to develop an overview and identify emerging trends of SSCM. Overall, there
are two retrieval methods, namely a query-based search and a citation expansion search in
electronic databases to attain documents for literature review [42].
The query-based search method typically requires terms or phrases to find records of
publications relevant to a research topic of interest, which is perhaps the preferred way.
For instance, the search query of Nimsai et al. [38] consisted of two phrases about SSCM:
“sustainable development and supply chain” or “sustainability in supply chain” in the first
search. Other valid search terms may include “sustainable supply chain” “supply chain
and sustainab*”, or “green supply chain management” to search for bibliographic records
in the field of SSCM [34,43,44]. However, the detection of latent semantic relations or
closely related concepts is the main drawback of the query-based search method, by which
recall takes precedence over precision [42]. Some relevant papers may not appear by search
term sieve, which poses profound challenges to the quality of the dataset. Based on the
view of citation index that papers citing the source material deserve further consideration,
the citation expansion search method can uncover potentially valuable and relevant papers
that may be overlooked by the method of query-based search. For example, Li et al. [45]
conducted a bibliometric analysis on hospitality management research, in which citation
expansion was carried out on the core dataset using citation expansion function of the Web
of Science database. Chen et al. [40] applied the method of topic term search and citation
expansion, in order to cast a wider net in the bibliometric analysis of orphan drugs and
rare diseases.
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 4 of 25
Based on the above analysis, the query-based search combined with the citation
expansion search method is applied to construct a representative and comprehensive
dataset concerning SSCM research field in our retrieval process, which can maximize
recall and precision. Specifically speaking, we firstly retrieve scholarly publications of
SSCM as an initial dataset, namely the core dataset by the query-based search approach.
Subsequently, the citation expansion search method is applied to expand the core dataset
through citation links.
2.1.2. Retrieval Process
In order to source documents of SSCM for this review, we followed the retrieval
process step by step: Web of Science (WoS) core collection, core dataset, expanded dataset,
duplicates removal, and finally, total records. Figure 1 shows an explicit sequence of the
retrieval process and corresponding results, which can mitigate subjectivity in selecting
papers and ensure procedural transparency [46].

search and citation expansion, in order to cast a wider net in the bibliometric analysis of 
orphan drugs and rare diseases. 
Based on the above analysis, the query‐based search combined with the citation ex‐
pansion search method  is applied to construct a representative and comprehensive da‐
taset concerning SSCM research field in our retrieval process, which can maximize recall 
and precision. Specifically speaking, we firstly retrieve scholarly publications of SSCM as 
an  initial dataset, namely  the core dataset by  the query‐based search approach. Subse‐
quently,  the  citation  expansion  search method  is  applied  to  expand  the  core  dataset 
through citation links. 
2.1.2. Retrieval Process 
In order to source documents of SSCM for this review, we followed the retrieval pro‐
cess step by step: Web of Science (WoS) core collection, core dataset, expanded dataset, 
duplicates removal, and finally, total records. Figure 1 shows an explicit sequence of the 
retrieval process and corresponding results, which can mitigate subjectivity in selecting 
papers and ensure procedural transparency [46]. 
 
Figure 1. Retrieval process diagram. 
First of all,  the WoS Core Collection was selected  for  the reason  that  the database 
covers the world’s leading peer‐reviewed journals about SSCM research domains. In light 
of the interdisciplinarity of SSCM, such as environmental sciences, operations research, 
and business, we delimited the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐E) and Social Sci‐
ences Citation Index (SSCI) in the WoS Core Collection. Secondly, we referred to the study 
of Patel and Desai (2019) [47] who used “sustainable supply chain management” to re‐
trieve peer‐reviewed research articles. The search term “sustainable supply chain man‐
agement” is also a professional term. An advanced search was conducted to construct the 
core dataset on 8 March 2021, using the topic search (TS)TS = “Sustainable Supply Chain 
Management” and restricting results by  the English  language and article/review docu‐
ment types with an open‐ended timespan. Any papers published before the retrieval time 
deserve further investigation. It does not matter whether our dataset includes the whole 
year or not. According to the study of Bouazzaoui et al. [46], we delimited peer‐reviewed 
articles  and  reviews,  and  excluded  books, proceeding papers,  and  other unpublished 
works in order to control for the quality of publications. A total of 592 records, including 
524 articles and 68 reviews, resulted from the query‐based search approach. Then, we ex‐
panded  the  initial dataset  through citation  links by using  the “Create Citation Report” 
function of the WoS database to construct the expanded dataset. This citation expansion 
search uncovered 8131 articles and 973 reviews that cite one or more publications of the 
core dataset. In addition, there are 545 duplicates including 480 articles and 65 reviews 
needing discarding when these two datasets were merged into one dataset. Eventually, as 
indicated in Figure 1, after refinement of excluding these duplicates, total unique records 
of 9151 peer‐reviewed papers composed of 8175 articles and 976  reviews with 320,376 
valid references were obtained. These papers published from 2007–2021 are considered 
for later scientometric review. 
Figure 2 shows the distribution of publications of the SSCM domain over the years, 
which can be an indicator reflecting the macro development trend [48] and scholars’ in‐
terests. As is showed in Figure 2, there was a rapid increasing trend from 2007 to 2020, 
Figure 1. Retrieval process diagram.
First of all, the WoS Core Collection was selected for the reason that the database
covers the world’s leading peer-reviewed journals about SSCM research domains. In light
of the interdisciplinarity of SSCM, such as environmental sciences, operations research, and
business, we delimited the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) and Social Sciences
Citation Index (SSCI) in the WoS Core Collection. Secondly, we referred to the study of
Patel and Desai (2019) [47] who used “sustainable supply chain management” to retrieve
peer-reviewed research articles. The search term “sustainable supply chain management”
is also a professional term. An advanced search was conducted to construct the core dataset
on 8 March 2021, using the topic search (TS)TS = “Sustainable Supply Chain Management”
and restricting results by the English language and article/review document types with
an open-ended timespan. Any papers published before the retrieval time deserve further
investigation. It does not matter whether our dataset includes the whole year or not.
According to the study of Bouazzaoui et al. [46], we delimited peer-reviewed articles and
reviews, and excluded books, proceeding papers, and other unpublished works in order to
control for the quality of publications. A total of 592 records, including 524 articles and 68
reviews, resulted from the query-based search approach. Then, we expanded the initial
dataset through citation links by using the “Create Citation Report” function of the WoS
database to construct the expanded dataset. This citation expansion search uncovered 8131
articles and 973 reviews that cite one or more publications of the core dataset. In addition,
there are 545 duplicates including 480 articles and 65 reviews needing discarding when
these two datasets were merged into one dataset. Eventually, as indicated in Figure 1, after
refinement of excluding these duplicates, total unique records of 9151 peer-reviewed papers
composed of 8175 articles and 976 reviews with 320,376 valid references were obtained.
These papers published from 2007–2021 are considered for later scientometric review.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of publications of the SSCM domain over the years,
which can be an indicator reflecting the macro development trend [48] and scholars’ in-
terests. As is showed in Figure 2, there was a rapid increasing trend from 2007 to 2020,
especially after 2015, which indicates that SSCM research is getting more and more aca-
demic attention. The reason why publications in 2021 are only 430 is that our dataset
only covers the first three month of the year. In 2007, there were only two papers, one of
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 5 of 25
which [49] studied aspects of SSCM and introduced the concepts of first-, second-, and
n-order supply chains. The other paper [50] studied the pinch analysis approach combined
with multi-criteria analysis to realize a more sustainable production. In 2017, a decade later,
the quantity increased to 909, to be 9.93% of total records. The number of publications hit
the peak in 2020 when 2571 papers were published. Besides this, 79.29% of the publications
(7256 out of 9151) were published in the last five years (2017–2021), suggesting that the
SSCM research has entered a booming period.

especially after 2015, which indicates that SSCM research is getting more and more aca‐
demic attention. The reason why publications in 2021 are only 430 is that our dataset only 
covers the first three month of the year. In 2007, there were only two papers, one of which 
[49] studied aspects of SSCM and introduced the concepts of first‐, second‐, and n‐order 
supply chains. The other paper [50] studied the pinch analysis approach combined with

2.2. Methods 
Currently, there are a variety of tools that can perform bibliometric analysis, such as 
CiteSpace, VosViewer, Bibexcel, etc. Each tool has different features and the choice de‐
pends on the requirements and intended purpose of the analysis. Compared with other 
tools, CiteSpace can be used to generate knowledge maps, show the knowledge structure 
and its dynamic changes, evaluate research status, reveal research hotspots, and predict 
research  trends by analyzing  literature  in a  certain  research  field.  It  is widely used  in 
COVID‐19 research [51], regenerative medicine [52], hotel management [45], innovation 
system [36], and other disciplines. Therefore, this paper conducts a bibliometric review on 
the SSCM field using CiteSpace 5.7 R2. 
According to the study of [53], research techniques of co‐author analysis, co‐word 
analysis, and co‐citation analysis are applied in this study to analyze different aspects of 
the SSCM field including social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure. 
Firstly, using the method of co‐author analysis, we map networks of co‐authorship and 
co‐authors’ institutions in the SSCM field, so as to reveal the social structure. Secondly, 
using the method of co‐word analysis, we map the network of co‐occurring keywords to 
reveal the conceptual structure and identify main concepts and research hotspots. Thirdly, 
we carry on co‐citation analysis, taking authors, journals, and documents as analysis units 
to reveal the  intellectual structure of the SSCM field. Specifically, document co‐citation 
analysis is based on the assumption that when two documents are cited by the third one 
at the same time, there is some correlation between the two documents. We also carry out 
clustering about references. The cited references in the cluster are cited by the academic 
group, which play the function of knowledge base, whereas the citing articles may be de‐
rived from the corresponding clustering and are considered as the research fronts [39]. 
Clustering quality can be measured by network modularity and weighted mean silhouette 
[51]. The former indicator reflects the clustering effect of the whole network structure. The

2.2. Methods
Currently, there are a variety of tools that can perform bibliometric analysis, such as
CiteSpace, VosViewer, Bibexcel, etc. Each tool has different features and the choice depends
on the requirements and intended purpose of the analysis. Compared with other tools,
CiteSpace can be used to generate knowledge maps, show the knowledge structure and its
dynamic changes, evaluate research status, reveal research hotspots, and predict research
trends by analyzing literature in a certain research field. It is widely used in COVID-19
research [51], regenerative medicine [52], hotel management [45], innovation system [36],
and other disciplines. Therefore, this paper conducts a bibliometric review on the SSCM
field using CiteSpace 5.7 R2.
According to the study of [53], research techniques of co-author analysis, co-word
analysis, and co-citation analysis are applied in this study to analyze different aspects of
the SSCM field including social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure.
Firstly, using the method of co-author analysis, we map networks of co-authorship and
co-authors’ institutions in the SSCM field, so as to reveal the social structure. Secondly,
using the method of co-word analysis, we map the network of co-occurring keywords to
reveal the conceptual structure and identify main concepts and research hotspots. Thirdly,
we carry on co-citation analysis, taking authors, journals, and documents as analysis units
to reveal the intellectual structure of the SSCM field. Specifically, document co-citation
analysis is based on the assumption that when two documents are cited by the third
one at the same time, there is some correlation between the two documents. We also
carry out clustering about references. The cited references in the cluster are cited by the
academic group, which play the function of knowledge base, whereas the citing articles
may be derived from the corresponding clustering and are considered as the research
fronts [39]. Clustering quality can be measured by network modularity and weighted mean
silhouette [51]. The former indicator reflects the clustering effect of the whole network
structure. The larger the value is, the easier it is to divide the whole network into several
groups with close connections among members but loose connections between groups.
Modularity between 0.4–0.8 is acceptable. The latter indicator measures the similarity
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 6 of 25
among members, and the larger the value, the more significant a certain cluster division
is [42].
This paper mainly uses metrics of frequency or count, betweenness centrality and
citations burst to identify important nodes, which may be authors, journals, keywords, and
documents [39]. The sizes of nodes with higher frequencies or counts are bigger than those
with lower frequencies. For example, cited references with high citation frequency have
been widely recognized by the scientific communities and have large citation rings in the
figure [51]. The betweenness centrality, as a structural indicator, indicates the position of
a particular node in the network. Nodes with high betweenness centrality (greater than
or equal to 0.1) are located in structural holes and covered by purple circles in the figure,
which have the potential to link various research themes and may bring transformative
findings. Knowledge “turning points” can be identified by this metric [36]. From the
perspective of information flow, scholars in the structure hole are supposed to connect
different researchers and get in touch with various ideas, perspectives and viewpoints,
which can make them more open-minded and creative. The citations burst, as a temporal
metric, can be applied to identify particular nodes such as keywords or cited references,
which have attracted wide attention of scholars in a certain period [40].
3. Results
In this study, we reveal social structure (RQ1), conceptual structure (RQ2), and intel-
lectual structure (RQ3) of the SSCM field by the methods of co-author analysis, co-word
analysis, and co-citation analysis.
3.1. Social Structure of SSCM Field
We focus on network of co-authors and their institutions in this section to analyze
social structure.
3.1.1. Co-Authorship Network
In order to study key authors and their collaborative relationships in the field of SSCM,
this paper analyzes the authors of 9151 literatures related to SSCM. The co-authorship
network was generated by CiteSpace whose parameters are set up as follows: top 50 Per
year (2007–2021), LRF = 3, LBY = 5, and e = 2. To make the map easier to visualize,
we pruned the sliced networks and merged networks based on a pathfinder algorithm,
resulting in a network with 607 nodes and 585 links whose largest subnetwork is shown
in Figure 3. Each node is labeled by the corresponding author. The linkage between
two nodes indicates that two authors collaborated to research in the same paper. The
thicker the linkage is, the high the level of cooperative relationship is. In addition, the
nodes with frequency greater than or equal to 15 are displayed. From Figure 3, we can
identify cooperative relationships among scholars and productive scholars clearly in the
largest subnetwork.
In terms of cooperative relationships, the density of the network is 0.0037, indicating
that authors’ group has not yet formed strong relationships of collaboration. There are only
two scholars for which the betweenness centrality is more than 0.1, including Joseph Sarkis
(with the betweenness centrality of 0.17) and Kannan Govindan (0.11). These two authors
are located at structural holes. It is clear that Joseph Sarkis (with the count of 103), Kan-
nan Govindan (99), and Minglang Tseng (72) are the top three most productive scholars,
followed by Angappa Gunasekaran (59), Charbel Jose Chiappetta Jabbour (53), Stefan
Seuring (50), Sunil Luthra (46), Biswajit Sarkar (42), Ana Beatriz Lopes De Sousa Jabbour
(41), and Sachin Kumar Mangla (41) in the field of SSCM research. From the perspective of
citation burst, there are 63 burst authors, of which 20 authors have a duration no less than
four years. In addition, the following authors have been bursting to present: Minglang
Tseng, Syed Mithun Ali, Ming K Lim, Rakesh D Raut, Morteza Rastibarzoki, Sachin Kumar
Mangla, and Wenyan Song who have burst durations no less than four years.

3.1.2. Co‐Authors’ Institutions Network 
In order to explore core institutions and relationships of cooperation in the field of 
SSCM, we generated a network of co‐authors’ institutions. CiteSpace parameters are sim‐
ilar to the co‐authorship network. The font size of an organization is proportional to the 
number of publications. The connection and thickness between nodes represent the coop‐
eration relationship and frequency between two institutions. 
The nodes and linkages number of the whole cooperation network of research insti‐
tutions are 291 and 283, respectively. The network density is 0.0067. The largest subnet‐
work has 226 node network members, accounting  for 77% of  the  total network nodes, 
shown in Figure 4. From Figure 4, we can identify the institutions that contribute most 
papers and/or have occupied crucial positions in the largest subnetwork. In terms of pub‐
lications  frequencies of various  institutions, Hong Kong Polytech University  (with 170 
publications), Islamic Azad University (155), University of Southern Denmark (138), Da‐
lian University of Technology (104), and University of Tehran (99) are the top five most 
productive institutions, followed by Polytechnic University of Milan (94), University of 
Kassel (88), University of Nottingham (81), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (79), and Iran 
University of Science and Technology (71). It is a remarkable fact that other institutions in 
China have played an active role in the research progress on SSCM, such as University of 
Electronic Science and Technology of China (68), Tianjin University (67), Chongqing Uni‐
versity (64), Sichuan University (63), Tongji University (61), Tsinghua University (55), and 
so on. In terms of betweenness centrality, institutions such as University of Sheffield (0.55), 
University of Kent (0.34), University of Liverpool (0.32), University of Plymouth (0.31), 
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (0.31), Aalto University (0.31), and Chalmers Uni‐
versity of Technology (0.31) have occupied crucial positions  in the research network of 
SSCM research. In addition, the citation burst of institutions can be an indicator reflecting 
institutions that publish many papers during a short period. There are 90 institutions with 
citation burst, of which eight institutions have been lasting for more than five years, in‐
cluding University of Bath (with a burst strength of 7.22, from 2009 to 2016), Arizona State 
University (7.44, 2011–2017), Oregon State University (5.23, 2010–2016), Griffith Univer‐
sity  (3.26, 2011–2017), University of Padua  (9.19, 2012–2017), University of Strathclyde

3.1.2. Co-Authors’ Institutions Network
In order to explore core institutions and relationships of cooperation in the field of
SSCM, we generated a network of co-authors’ institutions. CiteSpace parameters are
similar to the co-authorship network. The font size of an organization is proportional to
the number of publications. The connection and thickness between nodes represent the
cooperation relationship and frequency between two institutions.
The nodes and linkages number of the whole cooperation network of research institu-
tions are 291 and 283, respectively. The network density is 0.0067. The largest subnetwork
has 226 node network members, accounting for 77% of the total network nodes, shown
in Figure 4. From Figure 4, we can identify the institutions that contribute most papers
and/or have occupied crucial positions in the largest subnetwork. In terms of publications
frequencies of various institutions, Hong Kong Polytech University (with 170 publications),
Islamic Azad University (155), University of Southern Denmark (138), Dalian University of
Technology (104), and University of Tehran (99) are the top five most productive institutions,
followed by Polytechnic University of Milan (94), University of Kassel (88), University
of Nottingham (81), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (79), and Iran University of Science
and Technology (71). It is a remarkable fact that other institutions in China have played
an active role in the research progress on SSCM, such as University of Electronic Science
and Technology of China (68), Tianjin University (67), Chongqing University (64), Sichuan
University (63), Tongji University (61), Tsinghua University (55), and so on. In terms of
betweenness centrality, institutions such as University of Sheffield (0.55), University of
Kent (0.34), University of Liverpool (0.32), University of Plymouth (0.31), University of
Massachusetts Dartmouth (0.31), Aalto University (0.31), and Chalmers University of Tech-
nology (0.31) have occupied crucial positions in the research network of SSCM research. In
addition, the citation burst of institutions can be an indicator reflecting institutions that
publish many papers during a short period. There are 90 institutions with citation burst,
of which eight institutions have been lasting for more than five years, including Univer-
sity of Bath (with a burst strength of 7.22, from 2009 to 2016), Arizona State University
(7.44, 2011–2017), Oregon State University (5.23, 2010–2016), Griffith University (3.26, 2011–
2017), University of Padua (9.19, 2012–2017), University of Strathclyde (6.42, 2012–2017),
Linkoping University (5.49, 2012–2017), and University of Twente (2.87, 2011–2016).

3.2. Conceptual Structure of SSCM Field 
In  this section, we apply  the method of co‐word analysis  to reveal  the conceptual 
structure, and identify main concepts and research hotspots. 
3.2.1. Co‐Occurring Keywords Network 
Keywords, as representative words of a paper, are high‐level summary of content 
[48], which can enable researchers to gain an understanding of the core and essence of the 
study. High frequency and betweenness centrality of co‐occurrence of keywords can re‐
flect main concepts  in  its research  fields. Therefore,  the method of co‐word analysis  is 
applied to reveal the conceptual structure of SSCM fields. For the purpose of conducting 
a co‐word analysis utilizing CiteSpace software, the configuration parameters were set up 
as follows: top 30 Per year (2007–2021), LRF = 3, LBY = 5, and e = 2. The sliced networks 
and merged network map of co‐occurrence were pruned by a pathfinder algorithm. The 
network of co‐occurring keywords, with 129 nodes and 156 links, is shown in Figure 5. As 
is shown in Figure 5, each keyword is represented by a circle‐node whose size is a sign of 
the frequency of a keyword. The color of linkages between keywords indicates the first 
time when two keywords occurred in the same paper. The brighter the color of linkage is, 
the closer the first year of co‐occurrence is to the present. In addition, the nodes with fre‐
quency greater than or equal to four are displayed. We can also obtain the count and cen‐
trality of keywords from CiteSpace. The importance of keywords cannot only be judged 
by the frequency or count, but also its betweenness centrality in the network. Table 1 lists

3.2. Conceptual Structure of SSCM Field
In this section, we apply the method of co-word analysis to reveal the conceptual
structure, and identify main concepts and research hotspots.
3.2.1. Co-Occurring Keywords Network
Keywords, as representative words of a paper, are high-level summary of content [48],
which can enable researchers to gain an understanding of the core and essence of the study.
High frequency and betweenness centrality of co-occurrence of keywords can reflect main
concepts in its research fields. Therefore, the method of co-word analysis is applied to
reveal the conceptual structure of SSCM fields. For the purpose of conducting a co-word
analysis utilizing CiteSpace software, the configuration parameters were set up as follows:
top 30 Per year (2007–2021), LRF = 3, LBY = 5, and e = 2. The sliced networks and merged
network map of co-occurrence were pruned by a pathfinder algorithm. The network of
co-occurring keywords, with 129 nodes and 156 links, is shown in Figure 5. As is shown in
Figure 5, each keyword is represented by a circle-node whose size is a sign of the frequency
of a keyword. The color of linkages between keywords indicates the first time when two
keywords occurred in the same paper. The brighter the color of linkage is, the closer the
first year of co-occurrence is to the present. In addition, the nodes with frequency greater
than or equal to four are displayed. We can also obtain the count and centrality of keywords
from CiteSpace. The importance of keywords cannot only be judged by the frequency or
count, but also its betweenness centrality in the network. Table 1 lists the top 20 keywords
with high count or centrality. From Figure 5, we can identify keywords with high frequency
and/or with high betweenness centrality and draw out main concepts.

In terms of frequency, sustainability with the frequency of 1359 ranks first of all
the keywords. Supply chain management is the second high count keyword, followed
by supply chain (446). Scholars also pay great attention to circular economy (322) and
corporate social responsibility (203). The keywords sustainable supply chain management
(184), green supply chain management (170), and green supply chain (158) represent the
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 10 of 25
subdivided classification of supply chain management studied by scholars. The keyword
literature review (196) and case study (143) represent the methods of SSCM research.
Supplier selection (155) and reverse logistics (132) are also high frequency keywords.
On the other hand, keywords with high betweenness centrality indicate that they are
in the center of network and important in linking other keywords or other research topics.
The centrality of nodes in a purple circle are greater than 0.1. For example, the centrality of
supply chain is 0.47, greater than 0.1, which links corporate social responsibility, circular
economy, resilience, green product, and so on. Table 1 shows the top 10 high betweenness
centrality value of keywords, in which the keywords supply chain, sustainable supply
chain management, and reverse logistics show the highest betweenness centrality among
all others at 0.47, 0.42 and 0.42, respectively. Other keywords such as strategy, corporate
social responsibility, sustainability, corporate sustainability, and supplier management at
betweenness centrality values range from 0.3 to 0.4. Keywords whose centrality is greater
than 0.1 deserve to be studied further.
Considering both criteria of frequency and betweenness centrality, the values of fol-
lowing keywords are high: sustainability, supply chain, sustainable development, circular
economy, corporate social responsibility, sustainable supply chain, sustainable supply chain
management, green supply chain, case study, and reverse logistics. These keywords can be
summarized into five main concepts: sustainable supply chain management, green supply
chain management, circular economy, corporate social responsibility, and reverse logistics.
3.2.2. Keywords Burst Analysis
The notable increase in the frequency of a keyword during a relatively short period of
time usually reflects research hotspots, which are paid special attention by the scientific
community. We carried out keywords burst detection to identify research hotspots of the
SSCM domain using CiteSpace [54]. Table 2 shows 25 keywords with bursts of at least two
years. In chronological order, the burst keywords in the SSCM field have been changing
over the years from 2007 to 2021.

The keywords with a burst period greater than five years include supply chain man-
agement (2008–2013), environmental management (2009–2015), social responsibility (2010–
2016), transportation (2010–2014), eco-efficiency (2010–2014), logistics (2011–2015), strategy
(2011–2015), and corporate sustainability (2013–2018), which indicate that these topics got
more attention and are more influential than other keywords, thus, they became research
hotspots of the SSCM domain in corresponding periods. Besides, the game theory and
circular economy beginning bursting in 2018 and 2019, respectively, continue bursting to
the present, which are research hotspots currently.
From the point of view of burst strength, supply chain management (25.39) is the
strongest burst, followed by circular economy (22.22), environmental management (22.05),
social responsibility (11.21), transportation (4.99), and supplier management (4.79), which
are research hotspots in their corresponding periods. It is noteworthy that circular economy
is not only bursting to present, but also has high burst strength. This keyword appeared in
322 records including 50 records in 2018, 87 records in 2019, and 126 records in 2020 in our
dataset. On the whole, we argue that the research hotspots of the SSCM field currently are
game theory and circular economy related researches.
3.3. Intellectual Structure of SSCM Field
In this section, we apply the method of co-citation analysis to reveal intellectual
structure by analyzing cited authors, journals, and documents.
3.3.1. Author Co-Citation Network
Author co-citation network is generated to identify highly cited scholars whose publi-
cations are widely recognized by research communities in SSCM research. When two schol-
ars are cited in the same publications, the relationship of author co-citation occurs. We
take 9151 peer-reviewed papers’ references as analysis objects. The highly cited authors
may not be SSCM scholars, but their contributions certainly have a great impact on the
development of the SSCM field. CiteSpace configurations were set up as follows: Top N
(N = 50) Per year (2007–2021), LRF = 3, LBY = 5, and e = 2. Sliced and merged networks
were pruned according to the pathfinder algorithm, which resulted in 233 nodes and
419 links. The bigger the size of each node, the more citations the scholar has. The thicker
linkage between two nodes is, the more times two authors are cited in the same papers.
The nodes with citations over 200 are labeled by the corresponding first author. The nodes
with betweenness centrality no less than 0.1 are covered by a purple circle. From Figure 6,
we can identify cited authors with high citations and/or with high betweenness centrality
and draw out leading researchers.

show a rapidly increasing trend from 2008 to 2020. Professor Stefan Seuring of Universität
Kassel in Germany is cited the most every year, except for 2020. It is worth mentioning
that Kannan Govindan, who works at China Institute of FTZ Supply Chain in Shanghai

It is noteworthy that professor Kathleen M. Eisenhardt is not a SSCM scholar, but
she is in Figure 6. Many of her papers are cited by SSCM scholars and her contributions
can be considered as the knowledge base (theory or method) for the SSCM field. For
example, Sarkis et al. (2011) [55] referred to Eisenhardt’s paper titled “Agency theory: an
assessment and review”. Govindan et al. (2014) [56] referred to Eisenhardt’s paper titled
“Better stories and better constructs: the case for rigor and comparative logic”. Her paper
titled “Theory Building From Cases: Opportunities And Challenges” [57] is highly cited by
SSCM scholars.
In terms of betweenness centrality, there are 16 scholars whose betweenness centrality
are no lower than 0.2, indicating they are more influential than other scholars and exert
a great impact the development of SSCM research. The top 10 of these authors include
Thomas Dyllick (with a centrality of 0.64), Charles J. Corbett (0.5), Lutz Preuss (0.47), Robert
D. Klassen (0.42), John Elkington (0.39), Qinghua Zhu (0.33), Joseph Sarkis (0.3), Paul R.
Kleindorfer (0.27), and Kannan Govindan (0.26). When authors have both high citation and
betweenness centrality, they can be considered as influential or leading scholars [36,58]. In
this paper, taking citations count and betweenness centrality simultaneously, the following
scholars, whose citation and centrality exceed 500 and 0.1, can be regarded as leading
researchers: Stefan Seuring, Kannan Govindan, Craig R. Carter, Qinghua Zhu, Joseph
Sarkis, John Elkington, Stephan Vachon, Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, Ming-LangTseng, and
Gülçin Büyüközkan.

In addition, we can also identify influential scholars from the point of citation bursts,
that is, a scholar is cited much during a short period. The citations of several authors
have been bursting to present, including Sunil Luthra (with a burst strength of 50.88, from
2018), David J. Teece (36.45, 2018), Behnam Fahimnia (24.1, 2018), Yan Liu (80.21, 2019),
Andrea Genovese (61.07, 2019), Martin Geissdoerfer (59.93, 2019), Xu Chen (59.01, 2019),
Jing Li (58.79, 2019), Jafar Rezaei (52.81, 2019), Charbel José Chiappetta Jabbour (49.24,
2019), L.A. Zadeh (39.34, 2019), Amit Kumar (37.48, 2019), and Rameshwar Dubey (33.98).
The publications of these authors are worth studying because of their significant impact on
SSCM research.
3.3.2. Journal Co-Citation Network
In this section, we first analyze the source of publications and then detect the most
representative cited journals in the SSCM field.
It is found that 9151 papers related to the SSCM field are published in 889 journals,
the top 10 of which are listed in Table 3. These 10 journals published 4029 papers, which
account for 44.03% of the total records, which contribute greatly to progress in this field
and reflect a high concentration. As for frequency, the most productive journal is the Journal
of Cleaner Production publishing 1434 SSCM related papers and accounting for 15.67%
of papers of the total records, followed by Sustainability (10.96%), International Journal of
Production Economics (3.81%), International Journal of Production Research (2.87%), Business
Strategy and the Environment (2.19%), and Supply Chain Management—An International Journal
(1.90%). Because a higher impact factor does not equate to a higher journal quality, we build
on ABS journal rankings (2018). There are five journals rated 3, including the International
Journal of Production Economics, International Journal of Production Research, Business Strategy
and the Environment, Supply Chain Management—An International Journal, and Production
Planning & Control, which are highly regarded and very selective in what they publish.
Journal of Cleaner Production, Computers & Industrial Engineering, and International Journal
of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management are rated 2, which indicate papers in these
journals are fully refereed according to accepted standards and conventions. Besides, these
journals have a pluralistic nature, such as environmental sciences, engineering, operations
research, business, management, and so on, which indicate that the academic field of SSCM
is interdisciplinary [59].

We then generated a journal co-citation map to detect and evaluate influential journals
that contribute to the development of SSCM research and serve as the knowledge base
to some degree, as shown in Figure 8. CiteSpace configurations were set up as follows:
Top N (N = 50) per year (2007–2021), LRF = 3, LBY = 5, and e = 2. Sliced and merged
networks were pruned by the pathfinder algorithm, which resulted in 129 nodes and
247 links. The node sizes of cited journals and linkage thickness indicate citations and
co-citations, respectively. The nodes with count exceeding 500 are labeled by corresponding

abbreviations of journals. From Figure 8, we can identify cited journals with high citations
and/or with high betweenness centrality and draw out influential journals.

3.3.3. Document Co-Citation Network
When a group of documents is frequently cited in conjunction with other documents,
this cluster may represent a certain research theme. Compared with other clusters, each
cluster member is cited more frequently by a group of the same citing articles. In this
section, based on 320,376 valid references cited in the 9151 records in our dataset, we
applied the method of document co-citation analysis to visualize the landscape view of
the SSCM field and analyze underlying knowledge base and research fronts. CiteSpace
parameter settings are set up as follows: g-index (k = 40) Per year (2007–2021), LRF = 3,
LBY = 5, e = 2 and Pruning = None. The synthesized network of co-cited references in
SSCM research, with 2327 nodes and 12,165 links, is shown in Figure 9. We then carried
out clustering, which generated 220 clusters, which are labeled with title terms extracted
from citing articles through the Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) algorithm. Compared with the
latent semantic indexing (LSI) algorithm focusing on identifying common theme, the LLR
algorithm tends to emphasize unique topics [39]. Figure 9 shows 19 clusters, including
#0 Chinese manufacturer, #1 sustainable supply chain management, #2 green supply
chain management, #3 sustainable supplier selection, #4 circular economy, #5 and-trade
regulation, #6 closed-loop supply chain, #7 sustainable production network, #8 blockchain
technology, #9 supply chain management profession, #10 big data analytics, #11 corporate
sustainability strategies, #12 COVID-19 pandemic, #13 supply chain resilience, #14 green
human resource management, #15 best-worst method, #16 logistics issue, #21 energy
efficiency, and #26 logistics performance, which are major specialties of the SSCM field.
Each cluster signifies distinct aspects of SSCM issues and topics. For instance, the brilliant
yellow-colored area at the lower right quadrant is labeled as #8 blockchain technology,
which indicates that cluster #8 is cited by papers about blockchain technology related topics.
The color of the convex hull of each cluster indicates mean year calculated on publication
year of the cluster’s members. In addition, the brighter the color is, the closer average year
of one cluster is to the present. The quality of co-citation clusters is supposed to meet both
criteria of modularity and weighted mean silhouette, which deserves to be thoroughly
investigated. The modularity of the network is 0.7664, which is considered as a higher
value, denoting that a well-structured network is developed and the specialties in SSCM
fields are clearly defined. The weighted mean silhouette, as an indicator measuring the
internal homogeneity of each cluster, is 0.8659, signifying the clustering is highly reliable
and the members of corresponding cluster are more similar than other clusters’ members.

A timeline view of clusters is generated to show the origin, evolution, and time span
of each cluster in Figure 10. Disappearance of a cluster may not mean that scholars have
lost interest in this field, but may mean that they continue to explore new research direc-
tions [39]. As is depicted in Figure 10, each cluster’s members are showed in chronological
order along the horizontal axis, whereas clusters are displayed vertically from top to down
according to their sizes.

Then, we list detailed information of these 19 clusters in Table 4, including cluster ID,
size, percentage of the network, silhouette value, start-stop time, duration, mean year, and
labels based on the LLR algorithm. Silhouette values of all 19 clusters are greater than 0.7,
indicating that clusters are highly reliable and members have high internal consistency.
The largest cluster is #0 Chinese manufacturer composed of 361 nodes, which accounted
for 15.51% of the whole network. Each of the seven largest clusters has over 100 members
representing 64.12% of cited references of the entire network. We are particularly interested
in the duration of one cluster. There are eight clusters whose durations exceed 10 years,
including #0 Chinese manufacturer, #1 sustainable supply chain management, #2 green
supply chain management, #3 sustainable supplier selection, #5 and-trade regulation, #6
closed-loop supply chain, #9 supply chain management profession, and #11 corporate
sustainability strategies, of which cluster #3 spans the longest period, lasting 16 years. In
terms of activeness, we find nine clusters remaining active, including #1 sustainable supply
chain management, #3 sustainable supplier selection, #4 circular economy, #5 and-trade
regulation, #8 blockchain technology, #10 big data analytics, #12 COVID-19 pandemic, #15
best-worst method, and #26 logistics performance, which can be considered as emerging
trends of SSCM, except #1.

Taking size and activeness of clusters into consideration, this study mainly focuses on
the following specialties: #1 Sustainable supply chain management, #3 Sustainable supplier
selection, #4 circular economy, #5 and-trade regulation, and #8 blockchain technology.
By reading core publications that include highly cited references as knowledge base and
representative citing articles as research fronts, we can understand these clusters in depth.
The cluster #1, labeled by sustainable supply chain management, is the second largest
cluster containing 244 members and with a range of a 11-year duration from 2010 to 2020.
A study by Ahi and Searcy (2013) is identified as the most cited reference and also has
the strongest burst strength in the cluster. Ahi and Searcy [31] proposed a concise and
comprehensive definition of SSCM, which captured key characteristics of both supply
chain management and business sustainability. They argued SSCM was the extension
of GSCM. As the second most cited article, the study of [15] used the term SSCM in a
broad sense, which included all the environmental or social research of supply chain
management, such as GSCM. The most representative citing article for cluster #1 is that of
Sánchez-Flores [44] covering 36 cited articles in the cluster, which performed a systematic
literature review about SSCM research in the context of emerging economies, and showed
that when compared to developed countries, the research in emerging economies lagged
and was still in its infancy. The study of Mardani [60], covering 33 cited article in the cluster,
further presented a systematic review regarding applications of the structural equation
modeling (SEM) in the evaluation of GSCM and SSCM.
The cluster #3, labeled by sustainable supplier selection, is the fourth largest cluster
across a 16-year period from 2005 to 2020, which is the longest period of time among all
clusters. Supplier selection plays a crucial part in SSCM. This cluster focuses on how to
select and evaluate suppliers to achieve “triple bottom line” benefits. There are several
novel integrated approaches to sustainable supplier selection and evaluation operations.
The study of [61] presented a novel integrated fuzzy PIPRECIA—interval Rough SAW
model for green supplier selection. Chattopadhyay et al. [62] employed an integrated
D-MARCOS method, which can address the uncertainty in the supplier selection process.
Durmi [63] applied the Full Consistency method (FUCOM) to define the evaluation of
criteria for sustainable supplier selection. The study of [64] combined FUCOM—Rough
SAW approach for supplier selection. When it comes to research fronts, the top two
citing articles to this cluster offer literature reviews of state-of-the-art studies concerning
sustainable supplier selection [65,66]. Based on previous researches, Ecer and Pamucar [67],
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 18 of 25
Hendiani et al. [68], and Kannan et al. [69] cited more than 20 members in cluster #3 and
proposed the integrated F-BWM and fuzzy CoCoSo’B multi-criteria model, the multi-stage
hierarchical fuzzy index-based approach, and the hybrid approach combining the fuzzy
best-worst method and the interval VIKOR technique, respectively.
The cluster #4, labeled by circular economy, contains 157 references, with a silhouette
value of 0.972, which is considered a high value. The average year of all members in
this cluster is 2017, with an eight-year duration (2013–2020). The most cited article in
cluster #4 is published by Genovese et al. who asserted that in view of an environmental
point, integrating principles underlying circular economy into SSCM can provide potential
enhancement [70]. The study of Geissdoerfer, with the strongest burst strength in the cluster,
distinguished the terms circular economy and sustainability explicitly, therefore, clarifying
their conceptual contours [71]. The most active citing article covering 37 papers is the
paper of [72], which first researched circular economy in the leather industry context and
found that financial facility played a vital role in the implementation of circular economy
practices by using the best worst method.
The cluster #5, labeled by and-trade regulation, has 151 members with a silhouette
value of 0.945. The label can be revised as cap-and-trade regulation through reviewing
citing articles. Cap-and-trade regulation is a carbon policy aimed at combating global
warming. The most representative article in cluster #5 was published by Ghosh and
Shah [73] who explored the influence of cost sharing contract on green supply chains. With
regard to representative citing articles, some studies conducted supply chain researches
under cap-and-trade regulation, such as channel coordination in a two-echelon sustainable
supply chain [74,75], stochastic dual-channel supply chain [76], production and carbon
emission reduction strategies [77], and low-carbon production [78]. Tang and Yang [79]
analyzed the influence of power structure and financing mechanism on a low-carbon
supply chain.
The cluster #8, labeled by blockchain technology, has 84 members, with a silhouette
value of 0.99. As a distributed digital ledger technology, blockchain technology has com-
pletely overturned the traditional idea of centralized organization, and is expected to solve
some problems of some global supply chain management problems due to the globaliza-
tion of supply chains. The most cited article in cluster #8 is the paper titled “Blockchain
technology and its relationships to sustainable supply chain management” [17], which is
also hot paper in the WoS Core Collection. This paper examined the potential application
of blockchain technology to overcome some barriers of supply chain sustainability. The
most citing article of this cluster is the study of Chang and Chen [80] who conducted a
literature review of blockchain-based supply chain research and argued that the application
of blockchain can facilitate distributed governance and process automation for supply
chain operations. Kayikci et al. [81] applied blockchain technology into a food supply chain
and proposed a blockchain-enabled food supply chain framework, which can resolve trace-
ability and accountability problems and ensure transparency. The study of Orji et al. [82]
and Ar et al. [83] evaluated the critical factor of blockchain adoption in freight logistics
industry and the feasibility of blockchain in logistics industry.
3.3.4. Bursts in the Network of Document Co-Citations
In this section, we identify the top 20 references with the strongest citation bursts
lasting more than five years between 2007 and 2021 (see Table 5), which can be considered
as major milestones in the development and of evolution SSCM search [39].
From 2007 to 2021, the focus of these major milestones can be summarized as follows.
(1) Literature review of SSCM or GSCM. Sarkis et al. [55] conducted an organizational
theoretic literature review of GSCM, whereas Carter and Easton [84] conducted a system-
atic review of SSCM. Other papers provided reviews from various angles. For example,
using the method of content analysis, Gold et al. [85] highlighted that supply-chain-wide
collaboration can facilitate inter-organizational resources and, thus, maintain inter-firm
competitive advantage. Seuring [86] reviewed modeling approaches used in SSCM research
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 19 of 25
and founded multi-criteria decision-making, equilibrium models, and analytical hierarchy
processes were dominant approaches. (2) Building a conceptual framework of SSCM or
GSCM. Seuring and Muller [29], and Carter and Rogers [30] presented a framework of
SSCM, respectively, whereas Sarkis [87] provided a framework of GSCM based on a bound-
aries and flows perspective. It is noteworthy that the study of Seuring and Muller [29] had
the strongest burst value of 139.32. (3) Evaluation or process of supplier selection. The
study of [88] has experienced the longest burst period of six years, which introduced a
method combining grey system with rough set theory for the supplier selection. Based
on fuzzy analytic network process, Buyukozkan and Cifci [89] developed a fuzzy multi-
criteria decision framework with incomplete information. These scholars [90], then, in 2012,
proposed a hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making model for evaluating green
suppliers, which integrated DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS in a fuzzy context. (4) Other
topics related to SSCM, such as corporate social responsibility [91], firm performance [92],
and sustainable sourcing [93].

4. Conclusions and Discussion
4.1. Main Findings and Contributions
SSCM has been attracting extensive attention from both practitioners and scholars.
More and more firms realize the importance of the concept of sustainable development
and implement SSCM practices in order to realize an organization’s social, environmental,
and economic goals. The significant increasing number of empirical and conceptual papers
on SSCM topics indicates that SSCM research is getting more and more academic attention.
However, there are limited bibliometric literature reviews on SSCM to help us gain a better
understanding and overview of the evolution of this field. The main objective of this study
is to visualize and conduct a systematic scientometric review on 9151 articles and reviews
published from 2007 to 2021. Research techniques of co-author analysis, co-word analysis,
and co-citation analysis are applied in this study to address three research questions: RQ1:
What is the social structure of the SSCM field? RQ2: What is the conceptual structure of the SSCM
field? RQ3: What is the intellectual structure of the SSCM field? We mainly focus important
nodes with high frequency, high betweenness centrality, or high burst strength. We reveal
social structure, conceptual structure, and intellectual structure, identify main concepts
and research hotspots, and illuminate major specialties and emerging trends, which are
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 20 of 25
valuable to the readers. We expect this paper will provide a big picture for researchers as
well as practitioners. The main findings and contributions are as follows.
Firstly, based on the analysis of co-authorship network and their institutions network,
the social structure of the SSCM field is revealed. The authors’ group has not yet formed
strong relationships of collaboration. Joseph Sarkis and Kannan Govindan are located
in structural holes. The top five most productive scholars are Joseph Sarkis, Kannan
Govindan, Minglang Tseng, Angappa Gunasekaran, and Charbel Jose Chiappetta Jabbour.
The following authors have been bursting to present: Minglang Tseng, Syed Mithun Ali,
Ming K Lim, Rakesh D Raut, Morteza Rastibarzoki, Sachin Kumar Mangla, and Wenyan
Song who have burst durations no less than four years. As for institutions, University of
Sheffield, University of Kent, University of Liverpool, University of Plymouth, University
of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and Chalmers University of Technology have occupied
crucial positions in the research network of SSCM research. Hong Kong Polytechnic
University, Islamic Azad University, University of Southern Denmark, Dalian University of
Technology, and University of Tehran are the top five most productive institutions. There
are eight institutions that have been lasting for more than five years, including University
of Bath, Arizona State University, Oregon State University, Griffith University, University
of Padua, University of Strathclyde, Linkoping University, and University of Twente.
Secondly, based on the analysis of co-occurring keywords network, the conceptual
structure of the SSCM field is revealed. The top five keywords with high count include
sustainability, supply chain management, supply chain, sustainable development, and
circular economy. The top five keywords with high betweenness centrality include supply
chain, sustainable supply chain management, reverse logistics, strategy, and corporate
social responsibility. The keywords with a burst period greater than five years include
supply chain management, environmental management, social responsibility, transporta-
tion, eco-efficiency, logistics, strategy, and corporate sustainability. The top five strongest
burst keywords include supply chain management, environmental management, social
responsibility, transportation, and supplier management, which are research hotspots in
their corresponding periods. The main concepts include sustainable supply chain manage-
ment, green supply chain management, circular economy, corporate social responsibility,
and reverse logistics. The research hotspots of the SSCM field currently are game theory
and circular economy related researches.
Thirdly, based on the analysis of author, journal and document co-citation network,
the intellectual structure of the SSCM field is revealed. The top five most highly cited
authors are Stefan Seuring, Kannan Govindan, Craig R. Carter, Qinghua Zhu, and Joseph
Sarkis. The leading researchers are Stefan Seuring, Kannan Govindan, Craig R. Carter,
Qinghua Zhu, Joseph Sarkis, John Elkington, Stephan Vachon, Kathleen M. Eisenhardt,
Ming-LangTseng, and Gülçin Büyüközkan. The top five productive journals include the
Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability, International Journal of Production Economics, In-
ternational Journal of Production Research, and Business Strategy and the Environment. The top
five influential journals in SSCM research include Journal of Cleaner Production, International
Journal of Production Economics, International Journal of Production Research, European Journal of
Operational Research, and Supply Chain Management—An International Journal. The emerging
trends have shifted away from Chinese manufacturer, green supply chain management
(GSCM), closed-loop supply chain, green human resource management, corporate sus-
tainability strategies, supply chain resilience, energy efficiency, supply chain management
profession, logistics issue, and sustainable production network toward sustainable supplier
selection, circular economy, cap-and-trade regulation, blockchain technology, big data
analytics, COVID-19 pandemic, best-worst method, and logistics performance, which are
likely to define the new research fronts in the field of SSCM research. Moreover, we also
identify top 20 references with the strongest citation bursts lasting more than five years
between 2007 and 2021, which can be considered as major milestones in the development
and evolution of SSCM search.

4.2. Limitations and Future Researches
Our papers have several limitations from the following aspects: databases, publication
types, search terms, method, and citation manipulation. Firstly, the bibliometric dataset is
retrieved from SCI-E and SSCI in the WoS Core Collection. Various results and conclusions
may appear if the dataset is collected from other databases. Therefore, future research
can retrieve data from other databases such as the Scopus database, which also includes
comprehensive scientific data that is rigorously vetted and selected. Secondly, we delimit
peer-reviewed articles and reviews in the English language, and exclude publications from
other document types such as books or proceeding papers and other languages such as
the Chinese language, which may result in incomplete records. Therefore, future research
should cover more various publication types and other languages papers. Thirdly, while we
ensure a rigorous retrieval process to construct a representative and comprehensive dataset,
we also agree to the point that there may exist many articles, which lack the search term
but still focus on the SSCM. Other search terms (e.g., green procurement, RSCM/GSCM,
sustainable development and supply chain, sustainability in supply chain), which capture
some constructs of SSCM, may also be used as search terms to cover a wider range of
articles in future study. Fourthly, we mainly used the scientometric review approach to
conduct a review. We can integrate the scientometric review approach with the traditional
systematic review approach in future research. For example, we have revealed cluster
#8 blockchain technology, which has 84 members, with a silhouette value of 0.99. We
can identify representative cited references as the knowledge base and citing articles as
research fronts of this cluster. Then we can use a traditional systematic review approach to
consolidate these core publications. Therefore, we can get a comprehensive review and
synthesis of extant SSCM studies with respect to theoretical perspectives, methodologies,
gaps, and potential research avenues. In addition, citation manipulation may occur due to
author self-citation, editor or journal self-citation requirements, which may influence the
accuracy of co-citation analysis on SSCM research.
Though this study has its limitations, we remain confident that our systematic and
comprehensive review offers valuable insights and guidance to readers including both
researchers and practitioners in the field of SSCM. The findings presented in this paper
provide insights regarding productive scholars and institutions, influential journals, main
concepts, research hotspots, major specialties, and emerging trends for readers to better
understand the state of the art of the SSCM field. Moreover, this study can facilitate
SSCM practitioners to select appropriate institutions for SSCM consulting or cooperation.
Based on our findings, we could suggest several related topics for future researches,
which include sustainable supplier selection, circular economy, cap-and-trade regulation,
blockchain technology, big data analytics, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These topics
are emerging trends identified by the analysis of co-citation clusters. However, scholars
pay more attention to the first three ones, rather than the rest. Specialties of blockchain
technology, big data analytics, and the COVID-19 pandemic deserve more in-depth studies
and further exploration. Several future research avenues or research questions are proposed
to better understand these three themes.
(1) Blockchain technology. The application of blockchain technology to the supply
chain can pose more challenges and opportunities for SSCM and has the potential to
transform practices [16,94]. As a distributed database system, blockchain technology can
be made use of to obtain competitive advantages and enhance market positions. There are
several research questions that need to be further explored. RQ1: How does the introduction
of blockchain technology significantly transform SSCM practices, such as advancing inventory
management and replenishment, reducing the cost of supply chain transactions, or reducing the need
for intermediaries? RQ2: How can blockchain technology be effectively implemented in complex
supply chain networks? RQ3: What are the implementation challenges of the supply chain finance
driven by blockchain technology, and how can they be overcome?
(2) Big data analytics. The big data processing technology can enable data integra-
tion [95], information feedback, and decision-making coordination in modern supply
Sustainability 2021, 13, 4409 22 of 25
chains more and more effectively, which have become a possible source of competitive
advantage. There are extensive research values and significance in the SSCM field within
the context of big data. Considering the application of big data analytics, the following
research questions need to be well answered. RQ1: How does the theory application and devel-
opment of big data analytics challenge existing theory on SSCM? RQ2: What are the mechanism
and path of the impact of big data analytics on SSCM? RQ3: How can big data analytics be applied
for dynamic decision-making, evaluation of procurement risk, channel coordination, and strategic
partnership in SSCM? RQ4: How can firms predict irresponsible supply chain issues, such as
child labor, unethical behavior, and environmental pollution, through the information management
practices based on big data analytics?
(3) COVID-19. With the increasing complexity of the supply chain across the world, the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and caused chaotic
situations in SSCM, which can pose survivability challenges to many enterprises [96]. Ex-
isting research has not yet conducted in-depth discussions about SSCM in the context of
COVID-19 crisis. Thus, in future research, several research questions are worth explor-
ing in depth. RQ1: To what extent and how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced SSCM?
RQ2: Whether SSCM companies better alleviate the effects of COVID-19 and gain profits in
the post-COVID-19 economy? RQ3: How to optimize SSCM for resource allocation during
epidemics/disasters?
