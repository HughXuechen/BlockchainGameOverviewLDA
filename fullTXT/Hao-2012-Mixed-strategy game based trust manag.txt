Abstract. Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to a large number
of security threats and malicious attacks. The traditional security ap-
proaches from encryption and authentication are insufficient to defend
the insider attacks which are launched inside of the WSNs and bypass
the crypto-based defence. Trust management has been recently suggested
as one of the effective security mechanisms for distributed systems, and
is a promising new approach to solve the security challenges in wire-
less sensor networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still a
challenge to establish an integrated trust management mechanism with
comprehensive security analysis. In this paper, we consider the clustered
wireless sensor network in which the cluster head is in charge of the trust
management of other sensor nodes. We propose a novel, integrated trust
management mechanism for the cluster wireless sensor networks, and
analyze the optimal decision making policy by using game theory. First,
the upstream/downstream joint monitoring scheme is implemented to
securely and efficiently observe the behavior of the insider nodes. Then
based on the monitoring results, the local trustworthiness and global
trust worthiness are derived based on the trust exchange and the trust
computation. Finally, by game theoretic analysis of the security interac-
tion between the attacker and the network, the optimal trust policy can
be made based on min-max rule, and the optimal utility of the WSNs
can be guaranteed.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background and Related Works
Wireless sensors are small and inexpensive devices powered with low-energy bat-
teries, equipped with radio transceivers, and capable of responding to physical
radio signals. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are collections of wireless sen-
sors that are autonomously distributed to gather data from their surrounding
environments, to report the changes to data processing center[1]. Though the

development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications
such as battlefield surveillance, today such networks are used in many industrial
and civilian applications[1, 20].
Although wireless sensor network is promising for various important applica-
tions, the security issues in wireless sensor networks have been a roadblock for
their development[2, 20]. The critical goal of networks is to protect the network
against various attacks which is especially putting more threat to wireless sensor
networks due to their characteristics such as open medium, multi-hop, and dy-
namic topology[1, 20, 21]. The attacks against wireless sensor networks mainly
fall into two categories: (1) Outsider attack: The adversary adopts the meth-
ods including eavesdropping on information, injecting fractional data to jam the
networks traffics, and fabricating fake records to disturb the normal function of
the network[20, 21]. For these kinds of outsider attacks, it is of no necessary for
the adversary to compromise any insider sensor nodes thoroughly. (2) Insider
attack: The adversary breaks through the safeguard (e.g. the cryptographic and
authentication mechanisms), and consequently, the insider nodes are compro-
mised by the adversary and are changed into malicious attackers[18–20, 30, 35].
Traditional security systems are mainly used to protect the WSNs from outsider
attacks. However, since the insider attackers have access to the public and private
keys and bypass the cryptography system, it is preferred to use cryptographic
solutions as a first line of defence, and utilize non-cryptographic solutions as a
second line to protect the network against the insider attackers[14].
In contrast to the conventional approaches, trust management is becoming
a new methodology to solve the challenging issues for communication and net-
works security [2–13, 17, 22, 24, 28]. The notion trust management is first coined
by M. Blaze et.al in 1996[3]. The original trust management is about making
the policy for the authorization to strangers, by means of recommendations from
third parties. Trust management is then embodied as a distributed authentica-
tion system. Several later access control systems such as SPKI (simple public
key infrastructure)[15] and dRBAC(distributed role-based access control)[16] are
also inspired by the idea of trust management. With the advancement of the re-
search, the subsequential studies of trust management have approached to the
extensive fields as evaluation, analysis, and quantification of the trust and trust-
worthiness of network entities over time. The key problem towards the studies
of trust management is to obtain the precise, practicable trust values and cor-
respondingly, how to make the optimal trust policies[6].
Similar to the implementation of trust management in wired networks[5], on-
line service, and e-commerce systems[4], it is also of significance to introduce the
trust management into the fields such as ad hoc networks, peer-to-peer networks,
and also wireless sensor networks. Since the insiders are capable to launch at-
tacks and break the crypto-based security systems, trust management is consid-
ered as one effective second line of defence for the wireless network security[7–
12, 14, 17, 18, 32]. As a natural consequence of introducing trust management
into wireless sensor network environments, trust has been put forward with quite
differentmeanings and corresponding features. In wireless sensor networks, taking
Mixed-Strategy Game Based Trust Management for WSNs 241
into consideration of trust management, each sensor node is assigned a trust value
to reflect its trustworthiness according to its historical behavior and performance.
And trustworthiness in WSNs is generally interpreted as belief, subjective prob-
ability and reputation which represent the quantified values of availability, real-
isability, or security property of the insider nodes. Obtaining the behavior record
of the insider nodes of WSNs, the trust management scheme then calculate the
trust value and carry out reward or punishment according to the specific trust
policies[6].
In the literature, many authors address the issues of trust definition in dif-
ferent scenarios for wireless sensor networks[7–12]. Momani et al. propose the
Data/Communication trust[9]. Lin et al. introduce Hybrid Trust base on Soft
Trust and Hard Trust. These two works take into consideration of the veracity of
data, connectivity of path, processing capability of node, and service level of net-
work services. G. Saurabh et al. present a reputation based framework for data
integrity for wireless sensor networks. Their scheme considers information which
is collected by each insider node running the Watchdog mechanism to moni-
tor the neighbors[7]. R.A. Shaikh et al. introduce peer evalutaion scheme based
on direct observation of the monitor and recommendations from a third node.
Therefore their work is based on group trust[8]. E. Aivaloglou et al. propose
a hybrid trust and reputation management protocol by integrating certificate
based trustworthiness and behavior based trustworthiness[11].
1.2 Challenging Issues
As discussed above, being an alternative solution to traditional security
mechanisms, trust is gradually utilized in wireless sensor networks security[9], to
maintain and manage the historical behavior of the insiders (generally known as
reputation), and make policies for authorization or feedback (reward or punish-
ment) to these insiders. In a word, trust for wireless sensor networks, is a mecha-
nism that deals with the insider threats, based on historical behavior observations
and decision policies[6]. A typical trust mechanism forWSNs should contain these
important components.
– Monitoring scheme, which is preferred to be light weighted.
– Trust information exchange, which is required to be low cost.
– Trust Policies for authorization or reward/punishement decision.
Based on the special attributes of trust management for wireless sensor networks,
and the previous works on this field, the unique challenging issues for establishing
the trust management for wireless sensor networks mainly fall into the following
categories:
(1) Low Cost Trust Observation and Exchange. Existing trust management
mechanisms are mostly used in wired distributed systems, which differ from
the WSNs trust management application, especially in the aspects of power-
consumption and performance observation model. Therefore, it is of great signif-
icance to reconstruct these existing schemes to make them acclimate to the new
242 D. Hao, A. Adhikari, and K. Sakurai
WSNs environments. Concretely, in WSNs, if the monitoring scheme is always
running, the stringent power will be rapidly consumed[30]. Besides, if the trust
information exchange scheme requires too much communication, it will become
a burden to QoS[1, 20, 24]. Therefore, light weighted insider behavior monitor-
ing scheme, and efficient insider information exchange scheme are essential for a
more effective and low cost trust management mechanism.
(2) Trust Management against Insider Threats. The outsider attacks may be
prevented by crypto-based solutions[20, 21]. However, as the insider attackers
are inside the network, and have access to the pubilic/private key systems, they
can bypass such secure systems[14]. Therefore, to design an effective detecting
mechanism, we should implement methods other than cryptographic solutions
as the alternative solution to cryptography. At the same time, we should also
take into consideration the stringent power resource of each monitoring node.
(3) Policy and Decision Making for Trust Management. The final step of trust
management is to make a decision about what kind of priority will be authorized
to the insider nodes, according to certain decision-making policies. This kind of
policy should guarantee that the network will maximize its potential utility, in
other words, reduce the attacker’s damage to minimum[6]. Thus, how to make
these policies have always been a key problem for trust management, and it
deserves a comprehensive theoretical and mathematical analysis.
1.3 Our Contribution
In view of the above related works and the challenging issues, in this paper,
we propose an integrated trust management mechanism for the wireless sensor
networks. We consider the clustered wireless sensor networks in which at least
one cluster head exists among the insider nodes. The main objective of our trust
management mechanism is to observe the historical behavior of insider nodes,
exchange the observations from different routes, and make security decisions for
classifying different insider nodes into different trustworthiness level, according
to the trust policies.The main contributions of our work are summarized as:
(1) To observe the behavior of insider nodes, and to collect the evidence
for trust management, we implement a light weight upstream/downstream joint
monitoring scheme. By using this scheme, each insider will be observed by its
upstream and downstream neighbors. By utilizing Watchdog and signed Check
Packets, this joint monitoring scheme can be made cheat-proof. As well, the joint
monitoring can reduce power consumption comparing to previous monitoring
schemes which require either complex computation or need to be run in the
promiscuous mode[20] consistently.
(2) An integrated trust computation and exchange mechanism is implemented.
By using the check packet, each insider node will send its opinion on both its
upstream and downstream neighbors to the destination node. Then destination
node for each route will calculate the local trust of the insiders based on the
information from the check packet, and then submit the local trust values to the
Mixed-Strategy Game Based Trust Management for WSNs 243
cluster head. The cluster head, which is capable of calculating the global trust,
will finally make an authorization decision, and inform the decision to all the
inside nodes in this network. Comparing with previous local reputation based
schemes, our integrated trust computation will increase the accuracy and effec-
tiveness of trust computing and exchanging. Moreover, since only the destination
nodes need to submit the local trust to the cluster head, this protocol does not
require hight communication cost.
(3) We analyze the interaction between the insider attacker and the cluster
head as a repeated trust game with mixed-strategy. The final security policy is to
classify the insiders into different trust levels. And this policy is defined according
to the game equilibrium. This trust policy will bring the network system with
optimized utility, by choosing the defence strategies that minimize the attack
damages which the attacker wants to maximize. Without loss of generality, we
consider two kinds of attackers: smart attacker and naive attacker, and we reveal
the security decision making should be different for these two kinds of attackers.
2 Upstream and Downstream Joint Observation
One important issue to detect the misbehaving insiders in WSNs is how to iden-
tify the misbehavior, including packet dropping and packet tampering. In this
section, we utilize the upstream/downstream monitor scheme[14] to maintain
the history of packet loss and tamper at an arbitrary insider node.
2.1 Insider Threat Scenario
In WSNs, the insiders are the sensor nodes which have legitimately registered
into the network and have legal identities and access to the public/private key
system. The insider attacks in WSNs focus on the users which had internal access
to information and network systems[18, 19, 34].
Following the reactive routing protocols[20], when a source node S wishes to
send its data packets to the destination node D, it will first broadcast its Route
Request message[1, 3, 20]. On receiving this message, the insiders which have
the existing route to D will reply a Route Response message, and sender
will include the insiders which have good behavior history into its route to the
destination D. After that, sender S will begin to transfer its data packets to
destination D. On receiving the data packets from S, each insider can decide
either to forward these packets or to drop them, or to tamper the packets. If
the packets are dropped by the insiders, the packet receive ratio at D will de-
crease and the network performance will drop dramatically which reflects that
the integrity is damaged. If the packets are tampered by the insiders, the con-
fidentiality and availability will be damaged. Since packet tampering is more
difficult to be detected, we consider that it causes more damage to the network
than packet dropping.

2.2 Joint Monitoring in One Route
The whole network communication is divided into multiple time windows. In each
segment of these time windows TW (t)[20], there are many routes responsible for
data packet forwarding. To perceive the misbehavior of the WSN insiders, the
most directway is trafficmonitoring [1, 20, 21]. Utilizing the upstream/downstream
joint monitoring scheme[14], each node can be observed by its upstream and down-
stream neighbors in the route.
Consider in route x, the sender sends its data packets through the insider
nodes v1, v2, ..., vm, ..., vn. Each time an insider vm receives a data packet, it will
update its local counter about how many packet it has received from its upstream
neighbor vm−1. We record this number as nr(vm−1, vm). Then the insider vm will
forward the data packet to its downstream neighbor vm+1. Working under the
Promiscuous Mode[20], sensor nodes are capable of observing the downstream
nodes within its broadcast domain, about whether it tamper, drop or forward
the packets, respectively. The node vm will record the number of packets vm+1
dropped as nf (vm+1), the number of packets vm+1 tampered as nt(vm+1), and
the number of packets vm+1 dropped as nd(vm+1).
Let MS→D be an integral number. To obtain the trust of all the insider nodes
along the route x, after every MS→D data packets, the sender S will generate a
check packet, and send it thought the route x to destination node D. When this
check packet passes through route x, each insider in x will attach its opinions
about its upstream and downstream neighbors to the variable field in the check
packet. Noting that within one time window TW (t), along one route x, there
may be multiple check packets.
Consider a simple but representative case, when the insider m is included in
a 5-hop route, described as S � v1 � v2 � v3 � D, where S and D denote the
sender and destination node, respectively. When the check packet passes each
node, the node will attach their messages to the the empty fields in the check
packet. The information in the check packets along the 5-hop route is:
S
M0→ v1 : M0 = S ‖MS→D ‖Cup
F (S, v1), C
up
T (v1) ‖Sign(S);
v1
M1→ v2 : M1 = M0 ‖v1
∥
∥nr(S, v1)
∥
∥Cdown
F (v1, S) ‖Cup

T (v2) ‖Sign(v1);

M3→ D : M3 = M2 ‖v3 ‖nr(v2, v3)
∥
∥Cdown
F (v3, v2) ‖Cup
F (v3, D) ‖Sign(v3).
The message attached to the check packet at each node are denoted as M0, M1,
M2 and M3, respectively. The first field in M0 and second field in M1, M2 and
M3 are the identities of each node. MS→D is the total number of data packets
S has sent to D during between every two check packet. Cup
F is the upstream
neighbor’s opinion on how the insider node behaves on packet dropping, based on
the Promiscuous mode monitoring such as Watchdog. It describes the percentage
of packets that an insider node drops, and observed by its upstream neighbor. For
instance, Cup
F (S, v1) is S’s opinion on insider v1 about how v1 behaves as packet
dropping. On the other hand, Cdown
F is downstream neighbor’s opinion on how
the insider node behaves as packet dropping, which also indicates the percentage
Mixed-Strategy Game Based Trust Management for WSNs 245
of packets that an insider node m drops. Cup
T is the upstream neighbor’s opinion
on how one insider behaves as packet tampering. Finally, at each node, the
message is attached with an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Sign(vm)[20]. The
signature is generated based on the node’s identity vm, and can protect this
message from being tampered.
On receiving the check packet, the destination node will retrieve the ID of
each insider node, and verify the signatures. After that, the destination node
will calculate the local trust of each insider node m in this route, based on
the m’ upstream/downstream neighbors’ opinions. In the next section, we will
introduce the local trust and global trust computation and exchange.
3 Trustworthiness Exchange Protocol
In the last section, the upstream/downstream joint monitoring scheme is imple-
mented, and the insiders’ historical behavior can be obtained by such monitoring
scheme. Based on the observation records, in this section, we propose the local
trust computation and global trust exchange protocol. The local trust means
the trust values that are generated based on the monitoring information from a
single route, while the global trust is the integrated trust value which collects
the opinions on one insider node from all the routes.
3.1 Local Trust Computation
In the check packet, for each insider node vm, there are two categories of opin-
ions: the opinion about packet dropping, and about packet tampering. We first
consider the packet dropping. As we illustrated in the last section, the up-
stream node vm−1’s opinion on node vm about its packet dropping is recorded as
Cup
F (vm−1, vm), which is located between interval [0, 1]. By using Watchdog[20]
mechanism, the upstream node vm−1 can overhear whether node vm forwards,
drops, or tamper packets. Then Cup
F (vm−1, vm) can be calculated as:
Cup
F (vm−1, vm) =
nd(vm)
nf(vm) + nt(vm) + nd(vm)
(1)
where nf (vm) denotes the number of packets that node vm forwards to vm+1, and
monitored by vm−1 by using Watchdog; nt(vm) denotes the number of packets
being tampered by vm and successfully observed by vm−1. And nd(vm) denotes
the number of packets being dropped by vm and observed by vm−1.
We then investigate downstream node vm+1’s opinion on vm about packet
dropping, which is denoted as Cdown
F (vm+1, vm). This opinion is generated ac-
cording to the number of packets each node received, which is attached in the
check packet, and it is also a real number located between interval [0, 1]. Recall
that, in the check packet, the attached number of packets that vm receives from
vm−1 is nr(vm−1, vm), and the number of packets that vm+1 received from vm
is nr(vm−1, vm). Then node Cdown
F (vm+1, vm) can be recorded as:
246 D. Hao, A. Adhikari, and K. Sakurai
Cdown
F (vm+1, vm) = 1− nr(vm, vm+1)
nr(vm−1, vm)
(2)
On receiving the Check Packet which contains the opinions Cup
F (vm−1, vm) and
Cdown
F (vm+1, vm), the destination node D will calculate the route x’s opinion on
each insider node about how they behaves as packet dropping:
CF (m) = κ× Cup
F (vm−1, vm) + (1 − κ)× Cdown
F (vm+1, vm) (3)
Since the accuracy of upstream monitoring and accuracy of downstream moni-
toring are different, we define κ and 1−κ as the weights of upstream and down-
stream nodes’ opinion about insider m, respectively. Larger CF (m) indicates vm
drops more data packets between every two check packets.
Besides the opinion about packet forwarding, another item observed is the
ratio of packets that have been tampered by the insider vm, which is denoted as
Cup
T (vm). The upstream node vm−1 can observe the packet tempering behavior
of node vm by using Watchdog. Cup
T (vm) is defined as:
Cup
T (vm) =
nt(vm)
nf (vm) + nt(vm) + nd(vm)
(4)
where nf (vm), nt(vm) and nd(vm) have the same meanings as in equation (1).
After the destination node D receives the check packet, it will generate CT (m)
to denote the route x’s opinion on insider vm about packet tampering. And
CT (m) = Cup
T (vm).
After the destination node D generates CF (m) and CT (m) for all the insiders
in its route x, it will calculate the local trust value of the insiders in route x.
The local trust value from route x for an insider node m is denoted as T local
xm ,
which consists of two parts, one is trust for packet tampering and the other one
is trust for packet dropping:

where RDxm(i) (or RTxm(i)) is the value of CF (m) (or CT (m)) corresponding to
the i-th check packet. μ1cp and μ2cp are the discount factors of trustworthiness
which mean the decaying of trust over time. Nx
cp denotes the total number of
check packets generated along route x during time window TW (t).
The metrics T local
xm (Packet Tamper) and T local
xm (Packet Drop) are called local
trust for the reason that it indicates only the route x’s opinion on insider node
m. However, local trusts are insufficient to evaluate the insiders’ trustworthiness.
First, if only local trust is conducted, it will take a long time for a node to obtain
enough observation records of all the other nodes in the network. Second, one
insider may behave maliciously in one route, but legitimately in another route.
Mixed-Strategy Game Based Trust Management for WSNs 247
This may mislead those routes that have not been attacked before. Therefore, a
comprehensive global trust value which is integrated from all the local routes is
required.
3.2 Global Trust Computation
Assume within time window TW (t), there are N routes along which the insider
node m participates in. In other words, those N routes intersect at node m. At
the end of TW (t), the destination nodes of each route will submit the local trust
value on the insiders to the cluster head. It is assumed that the cluster head is
the trusted third party (TTP). Because if the cluster head is compromised by
adversary, the entire network will also be besieged soon.
Let Ω denote the set of all the N routes which utilized insider m in the
window TW (t), and x ∈ Ω be one route. Let H(x,m, t) be the number of
times that route x has utilized the insider m during TW (t). Therefore, the
total number of times that insider m has been used in the past time win-
dow TW (t) is recorded as H(m, t) =
∑
x∈Ω H(x,m, t). Let T local
xm (i) ∈ [0, 1]
denote the local trustworthiness of insider m in the view of route x, where
i ∈ {Packet Tamper, Packet Drop}. And let Kr(x, t) be the balance factor of
trust value from route x, during time window TW (t). Kr(x, t) is introduced
to offset the risk of non-credible feedbacks from route x, such as bad-mouthing
attack or whitewashing attack[20]. After these, the global trust value can be
defined as a function of T local
xm (i), H(x,m, t), and Kr(x, t):
Tm(i) =
∑
x∈Ω
[
H(x,m, t)
∑
x∈Ω H(x,m, t)
× T local
xm (i)×Kr(x, TW (t))
]
(6)
where i ∈ {Packet Tamper, Packet Drop}. The value of global trust measures
a generalized trustworthiness that an insider m is held by all the routes, which
utilized m as an insider node during the last time window TW (t). Based on this
global trust values during the past TW (t), the cluster head will classify the in-
sider nodes into different categories (e.g. Legitimate, Suspicious and Malicious).
The legitimate insiders will be permitted to access more services of the network
system. The malicious insiders will be isolated from the system immediately.
And for the suspicious insiders, the cluster head will inform all the member
nodes that such suspicious insider should be given more frequent observations.
For example, each route xmay reduce the value of MS→D which will increase the
frequency of generating the check packet to check the suspicious insider nodes.
It’s worth noting that, the final format of the global trust value Tm(i) where
i ∈ {Packet Tamper, Packet Drop}, is a pair of real numbers locating in the
interval [0, 1], they can also be considered as probabilities. The global trust
value thus can be indicated by the accumulative packet drop ratio and packet
tamper ratio of the insider node m. The significance of calculating the global
trust comparing to the local trust is that: in the global trust, the sample space
which covers all the routes that utilized the insider node m, is much richer than
the sample space for single route’s local trust evaluation. According to the Law
248 D. Hao, A. Adhikari, and K. Sakurai
of Large Numbers [36], the average of the results obtained from a large number
of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as
more trials are performed. Therefore, the integrated global trust is more close
to the real probability that each insider node drops (tampers) data packets.
4 Game-Based Analysis for Trust Policies
In this section, the proposed trust management mechanism is analyzed by game
theory. The trust policy is made to distinguish the malicious, suspicious, and
legitimate insider nodes based on the game equilibrium. The reason for utilizing
game theory for the trust decision making is owing to the tradeoff existing in
the communication phase. For instance, by dropping or tampering packets, the
attacker may receive illegal utility, but may also take risk of being punished.
For the cluster head, it can severely punish an insider node for its losing a little
packet, but the usability of the network will decrease. Therefore, the interaction
between the cluster head and the insider node is a multi-dimensional decision
making problem which is often modeled and analyzed as a game[35].
4.1 Trust Game Model
In clustered WSNs, the game is between any one of the insider attackers who
takes attack strategies, and cluster head who makes decision on how to classify
the insiders based on the global trust values. The attacker wants to bring damage
to the network, and the cluster head wants to prosecute the attacker out. The
loss of the network system is the same as the gain of the attacker. Therefore, we
model the game as zero-sum non-cooperative game[34]. The first step of game
theory based analysis is to identify the players and their available actions (or
strategy). The insider node is perfectly informed of the historical strategies of
the cluster head, for the reason that the strategy of the cluster head, which is
the global trust value, has been broadcasted to all the members in the network
including the insider attacker. On the contrary, the insider’s past strategies are
not perfectly observed by the cluster head, because the observation mechanism
is not perfectly accurate. Moreover, because the cluster head takes its strategy
after the insider, we construct the game in an extensive form.
Fig.1 portrayed the one-shot trust game between the insider and the cluster
head. This game is illustrated as a tree in which the attacker takes its attack
strategy first and the cluster head takes the defence strategy in succession af-
ter the attacker. The red node at the root denotes the insider, and 1:1 means
the first move of the first insider node. The insider node may take any one of
the 3 strategies: Behave Normally(N), Drop Packet(D), and Tamper Packet(T),
which are presented by red lines starting from the root. Similarly, the cluster
head’s moves start from a blue node, and 2:1 means the first move of the cluster
head. The cluster head can make 3 kinds of decisions: Trust the insider, clas-
sify it as Legitimate(L), Semi-Trust the insider, consider it as Suspicious(S), and

completely distrust the insider, classify it as Malicious(M). Since there is no
observation mechanism with 100% detection rate[21], the cluster head is not
totally certain that the insider chooses one of the strategies from its strategy
space. Therefore, the cluster head’s 3 sub-trees belong to the same information
set, which is illustrated by a dash line linking the 3 blue nodes. After both the
attacker and the cluster head choose their own strategies to fight against each
other, the interaction between these two players will come to an outcome, which
are denoted by different leave nodes in the end of the game tree. We can see that
there are totally 9 leaf nodes at the end of the extensive game tree which identify
all the possible outcomes (3×3) of the one-shot trust game. The following items
describe the meanings of all the possible outcomes of this trust game.
– (N,L): Insider node behaves normally, and cluster head trusts the insider,
classify it into legitimate member.
– (N,S): Insider node behaves normally, but cluster head mistakenly semi-
trusts it, and classifies it as suspicious insider.
– (N,M): Insider node behaves normally, while cluster head makes an error,
distrusts it, and classifies it as malicious attacker.
– (D,L): Insider node drops packets, but cluster head considers the drop as
due to channel problems, classifies the insider as Legitimate Member.
– (D,S): Insider node drops packets, and cluster head correctly semi-trusts it,
classifies it as suspicious and requires further observation.
– (D,M): Insider node drops packets, and cluster head distrusts it, severely
classifies it as malicious and isolates it from service.

wrongly trusts it, and regards it as legitimate.

– (T, S): Insider node tampers some packets, while cluster head classifies it as
suspicious and requires further observation.
– (T,M): Insider node tampers some packets, and cluster head regards it as
malicious and isolates it from service.
The corresponding payoff for the insider at each of the above outcomes is denoted
as Um(u, v), where u ∈ {Normal(N), Drop(D), T amper(T )} is the strategy from
insider, and v ∈ {Legitimate(L), Suspicious(S),Malicious(M)} is the strategy
of the cluster head. Since in the clustered wireless sensor network, the attacker’s
gain is the same as the network’s loss, therefore the utility of the network is
Un(u, v) = −Um(u, v), which indicates a zero-sum game[35]. We illustrate the
utilities for the cluster head (the network) at different outcomes as the matrix
in the following table, in which the Un(u, v) may vary in different application
scenarios[20]. For example, the damage from a tampered data packet in the
battle field sensor network will be much more severe than the damage in the
civilian applications.
Table 1. Different Payoffs for Network at Different Outcomes
Strategy Trust(Legitimate) Semi-Trust(Suspicious) Distrust(Malicious)
Behave Normally Un(N,L) Un(N, S) Un(N,M)
Drop Packets Un(D,L) Un(D, S) Un(D,M)
Tamper Packets Un(T,L) Un(T, S) Un(T,M)
In Table 1, the first elements in each utility function are actions of the insid-
ers, while the second elements are the actions of the cluster head. For example,
Un(T,M) is the utility for the cluster head under the situation that the insider
node tampers a packet, and the cluster head classify it as malicious and distrust
it. It is worth noting that, Un(u, v) is the utility under pure strategy. In game
theory, the notion of pure strategy means the players choose the strategies de-
terministically. That is to say, the players choose each strategy with probability
0 or 1. However, in the real case, the rational attacker will change its strategy
over time, and sometimes just pretends to be legitimate and takes the malicious
strategy with certain probability. This kind of rational attacker will choose each
possible strategy with a certain probability. Thus, the trust game is a mixed-
strategy game, in which the player’s strategy is probability distribution over the
action set.
Table 2 illustrates the mixed strategy for both the attacker and the cluster
head. In this mixed strategy game, the attacker’s strategy is a probability dis-
tribution {p, q, 1− p− 1} over all its possible action set {N,D, T }. Variables p,
q, 1 − p − q are the probabilities for the attacker to adopt each of the actions
Behave Normally(u = N), Drop Packet(u = D), and Tamper Packet(u = T ),
respectively. On the contrary, for the cluster head, its strategy is a probability
distribution {x, y, 1− x− y}, over the cluster head action set {L, S,M}. Here x,

Drop Packets qx qy q(1− x− y)
Tamper Packets (1− p− q)x (1− p− q)y (1− p− q)(1− x− y)
y, 1−x−y are the probabilities for the cluster head to classify the insider node as
Legitimate(v = L), Suspicious(v = S) and Malicious(v = M), respectively. The
mixed strategy of the insider attacker is denoted as sm(p, q) which is a probabil-
ity distribution over action set {Normal,Drop, Tamper}, while m denotes this
potential attacker. And the mixed strategy for the cluster head is sn(x, y) which
is a probability distribution over {Legitimate, Suspicious,Malicious}, while n
indicates the cluster head. The combination in each grid in the Table.2 is the
joint probability for both the attacker and the defender to choose certain actions.
For example, the grid for (1− p− q)(1− x− y) means the joint probability that
the attacker tamper the packet while the cluster head classify it as malicious at
the same time. The matrix in Table.2 is thus the joint probability distribution
for each possible outcome.
4.2 Trust Game Equilibrium
In the last subsection, we have construct the trust game model based on the
Attack-Defence interaction between the insider node and the cluster head. To
find the optimal defense strategy for the cluster head, we need to analyze this
trust game. The key point in the game analysis is to find the Nash equilibrium[31].
For this trust game, the Nash equilibrium points indicates the outcome in which
neither the insider nor the cluster head wants to unilaterally change its strategy.
Otherwise, the unilateral change of the strategy will only lead to its own utility
degradation[34, 35]. In the field of network security and trust management, a
security analysis deserving its name is a min-max method that the defender first
looks at the maximal damage that an attacker can cause for a specific defence,
and then searches for the defence that minimizes the maximal damages[6, 35].
This min-max decision rule, in zero-sum game theory, is well known as the nec-
essary and sufficient condition for the Nash equilibrium[34].
We utilize the min-max rule to approach the Nash equilibrium. Taking into
consideration the payoff matrix in Table 1 and the Joint distribution of mixed-
strategy matrix in Table 2, the trust game’s Nash equilibrium (s∗m(p, q), s∗n(x, y))
is restricted to the following function set:
⎧
⎨
⎩
s∗m(p, q) = arg min
sm(p,q)
max
sn(x,y)
Em (sn(x, y), sm(p, q));
s∗n(x, y) = arg max
sn(x,y)
min
sm(p,q)
Em (sn(x, y), sm(p, q)).
(7)
252 D. Hao, A. Adhikari, and K. Sakurai
where sm(p, q) and sn(x, y) are the mixed strategy of attacker and cluster head,
respectively. Furthermore, s∗n(x, y) denotes the dominant mixed strategy in which
the value of x and y will bring the network with the optimal utility. s∗m(p, q) de-
notes the dominant mixed strategy of the attacker. Em (sn(x, y), sm(p, q)) is the
overall utility expectation in the status that attacker chooses the mixed strategy
sm(p, q) while cluster head chooses the mixed strategy sn(x, y). This utility ex-
pectation is calculated by the mathematical expectation over the utility matrix
from Table 1, taking into consideration of the mixed strategies in Table 2.
According to [34], every finite strategy game has at least one mixed strategy
Nash equilibrium. Given the real numbers of the elements in Table 1, the above
min-max function can be easily solved by nonlinear optimization method. Then
the values of p, q, x and y can be derived. The values of p, q, and 1−p−q are the
thresholds for the global trust values Tm(i) according to equation (6). Comparing
with the thresholds p, q and 1 − p − q, if Tm(Packet Tamper) is higher than
(1−p−q), the insider m should be considered as malicious; if Tm(Packet Drop)
is higher than q, the insider m should be at least viewed as suspicious. As the
time window TW (t) changes, the strategies of both the attacker and the cluster
head will also change, this is about the evolution of the trust game, which will
be discuss in the next subsection.
4.3 Trust Game Evolution
In last section, we analyzed the trust game within single time window TW (t).
Since the communication of the network goes on, there are multiple time win-
dows, the trust game is extended to multi-stage repeated game. We utilize
the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)[33] which is a generalization form
of multi-round game Nash equilibrium to analyze the evolution of this trust
game. The QRE is calculated by the following equation:
P k
i =
exp(λ× EUk
i (P−i))
∑
m exp(λ× EUm
i (P−i))
(8)
where P k
i is the probability for player choosing strategy k, which is the same
as the p, q and 1 − p − q (or x, y and 1 − x − y) in the one-shot trust game.
EUk
i (P−i) is the expected utility to player i of choosing strategy k given other
players are playing according to the probability distribution P−i. In the trust
game, EUk
i (P−i) is equal to Un(i, j). Larger λ indicates that the players become
more rational, and are more eager to take Nash equilibrium strategies. Table 3
in Appendix shows the relationship between the strategies and the value of λ.
We consider the trust mechanism confronting two kinds of attackers: 1)Smart
insider attackers who are rational, prefer to protect itself, hide in the network and
launch long-term attack; 2)Naive insider attackers, who are irrational, and want
to launch severe attacks even taking the risk of being detected. Following the
utility preference ordering methord[37], the smart attacker’s preference sequence
of all the potential 9 outcomes is: (T, L) > (D,L) > (T, S) > (D,S) � (N,L) �
(T,M) > (N,S) > (D,M) > (N,M). On the contrary, the naive attacker
Mixed-Strategy Game Based Trust Management for WSNs 253
will attach more importance on bring damage to the wireless network systems,
than protect themselves. Therefore, its preference sequence for the potential
outcomes is: (T, L) > (T, S) > (D,L) > (D,S) � (N,L) � (T,M) > (D,M) >
(N,S) > (N,M). Also following the method in[37], the example utilities Un(i, j)
are defined. Then by using the tool GameBit[38], the QRE of the repeated trust
game is derived.

Fig. 2. Comparison of Strategy Evolution of the Smart and Naive Attackers
Fig.2 illustrates the strategies’ evolution of the smart and naive attackers. The
red lines indicate the evolution of the strategies of naive attacker. The repeated
trust game starts with equal probabilities (0.33) for each strategy. With the
number of time window TW (t) increases, the trust game repeats. In Fig.2(a),
the naive attacker’s probability for normal behavior(N) decreases faster than the
smart attacker. In Fig.2(c), the smart attacker slowly increases its probability
for tampering packet, to avoid being detected, while the naive attacker have less
fear of taking risks, and is more eager to tamper packets. From this, we are aware
of that the smart attacker are more tricky to avoid being detected. Based on this
analysis, any insider whose strategy trajectories locate on the left of the red lines,
should be classified as malicious immediately; Any nodes whose trajectories is
on the right of the blue lines, can be considered as legitimate temporarily; And
those nodes whose strategy evolution trajectory between the red and blue lines,
should be at least viewed as suspicious.
Fig.3 illustrates the co-evolution of the strategies of smart attacker and cluster
head while they play the trust game. From Fig.3(a) we can see: with the game
repeats, the attacker prefers more to tamper packet, but gradually decreases the
probability for dropping packets. This is because while time goes on, the risk
of being detected also increases. Therefore the attacker does not want to take
the risk of being considered as malicious for dropping packets. In Fig.3(b) we
can see that, more repetitions of the trust game will give the cluster head more
information to increase the detection accuracy. Therefore, the probability for
wrongly classify the attacker as legitimate (green line) consecutively decreases.
Noting that the blue line first increases to a peak value, but then decreases,
finally even reaches to value 0. This interesting phenomena indicates significantly
that: during the first period (before step 15), due to lack of observation, the
cluster head can not make decision that the insider node is a smart attacker.

However, it becomes more suspicious of this insider attacker. With the trust
game repeats, it obtains more and more information of the smart attacker’s
misbehavior. Therefore, it decidedly decreases the probability for the strategy
for classifying the insider node as Suspicious and Legitimate, but increases the
probability to identify it as a malicious attacker. More data about the trust
game’s co-evolution is illustrated in Table 3 in the appendix.
5 Conclusion
We proposed an integrated trust management mechanism for clustered wireless
sensor network. The behavior of insider nodes are observed by a light weight
upstream/downstream joint monitoring scheme. The opinions from the moni-
tors are then calculated to get the local trust value. Local trust values are then
submitted to the cluster head, and the global trust is generated according to
our trust calculation and exchange algorithm. After that, the threshold for the
global trust, is analyzed by a mixed-strategy repeated trust game. The analysis
not only considers static case in which the trust game only runs one-shot, but
also extends the attacker-defender trust game to a repeated scenario. The opti-
mal trust policy is made based on the mixed strategy game analysis. By using
this trust management mechanism, it is possible for the WSNs to reduce the po-
tential damage from the malicious and suspicious insider attacker to minimum.
The future work is to implement this trust management mechanism, design an
effective intrusion detection system for WSNs by taking into consideration of
false positive rate and false negative rate.
