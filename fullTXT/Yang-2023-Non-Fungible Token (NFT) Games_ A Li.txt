Abstract—Non-fungible token (NFT) is a variant of tokens 
that can be used to represent unique and valuable digital items. 
NFT can prove true ownership of virtual assets in game spaces, 
allowing it to be utilized in computer games. It is an emerging 
field that attracts a great deal of academic and professional 
interest. Nonetheless, there are critics of the NFT game, and 
some may compare it to a Ponzi scheme. The purpose of this 
study is to identify the recent research trends in the field of 
NFT game research. We discovered 23 NFT game articles by 
searching the SSCI/SCI Expanded, Scopus, and IEEE 
Explore Library databases. The study summarizes these 23 
articles in order to reveal the major issues addressed in the 
literature. Recent research on social media influencers yields 
fundamental insights from these findings.   
Keywords—non-fungible token, NFT, cryptocurrency, 
blockchain, bibliometric analysis 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The advent of blockchain technology has made 
cryptocurrency possible. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency 
created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group using 
the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, is recorded in a public 
distributed ledger known as blockchain. Blockchain 
consists of an ordered list of nodes and links, with the nodes 
storing information and the links, or chains, connecting 
them. Blockchain enables a decentralized transaction 
ledger[1]. NFT provides an innovative approach to how 
digital assets are traded and have seen a rapid increase in a 
variety of applications[6]. However, there are some ethical 
concerns regarding the trading of NFT. An NFT-based 
game such as StepN, a fitness app, requires the purchase of 
"sneakers" that depreciate over time in order to play the 
game and earn game points, which can be exchanged for 
real currency. StepN is a Ponzi scheme because the revenue 
generated by players is contingent on a steady influx of new 
players. 
Non-fungible token (NFT), a variant of the blockchain's 
tokens, is gaining popularity due to its potential applications 
in decentralized markets, the arts, gaming, and education[2]. 
NFT that are enabled by blockchain technology and smart 
contracts may be used to represent unique and valuable 
digital assets. NFT can be used in computer games as one of 
the most important future application domains for 
blockchain and smart contracts[3] because NFT can prove 
the true ownership of virtual assets in-game spaces, and only 
NFT holders can transfer them[4]. There is a common belief 
that NFT were created as a means for game players to trade 
their virtual goods within the game space[5].  
NFT provide an innovative approach to how digital 
assets are traded and have experienced a rapid rise in plenty 
of application[6]. However, there are some ethical concerns 
for NFT trading. For example, A NFT-base game called 
StepN, a fitness app, requires purchasing “sneakers” NFT 
that wears out over time to play the game and earn game 
points, which can be traded for real currency. The revenue 
earned by StepN players depends on a constant influx of 
new players, linking StepN to a Ponzi scheme [7]. 
There are enormous online materials discussing NFT 
games, including blogs, website, video, podcast, etc. 
However, few academic literatures discuss NFT from a 
rigorous academic viewpoint.  
The current study contributes to the academic literature 
by summarizing the recent academic research about NFT 
games. The remaining sections of this paper are structured 
as follows: Section 2 describes the research methodology of 
the current study. Section 3 presents the findings, and 
Section 4 provides a summary of the paper’s findings, 
contributions, and discussions. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
The systematic literature review may aid in identifying 
research gaps and explicating the potential for future 
research. This section describes the literature review 
methodology utilized in the current study.  
A. Data Collection 
We searched the databases of SSCI/SCI Expanded, 
Scopus, EBSCO Academic Search Ultimate, IEEE Explore 
Library, and ACM Digital Library for pertinent literature. 
The SSCI/SCI Expanded and Scopus databases were 
chosen for the study because they are well-known among 
academics and widely utilized for bibliometrics research. 
SSCI/SCI Expanded and Scopus are the most popular 
journal quality lists due to their interdisciplinary scope[8]. 
Scopus indexes more journals than SSCI/SCI Expanded. 
Thus, SSCI/SCI Expanded can be used to compile a 
manageable collection of articles for review when 
researchers are confronted with thousands of articles in a 
subject area. To include more articles in the literature 
review, the researchers may wish to broaden their search 
for an emerging research field. 
The EBSCO Academic Search Ultimate database was 
selected because it offers the broadest coverage across 
nearly all academic disciplines. Prior investigation made 
use of the database (i.e., Saracoglu et al., 2022; Getsay & 
Chen-Gaffey, 2021; Pulikowski & Matysek, 2021). 
The IEEE Explore Library and ACM Digital Library 
were chosen due to the prevalence of computer science and 
information engineering fields in pioneering NFT game 
research. A significant amount of NFT game research can 
be published in IEEE or ACM journals, transactions, and 
conference proceedings. 
Our research was restricted to English-language peer-
reviewed articles, excluding books, book chapters, 
editorials, and other non-refereed publications. This is

because peer-reviewed academic articles are regarded as 
authoritative sources of information and rank first in terms 
of influence. We include both journal and conference 
articles because this is a new field that has been the subject 
of a few journal articles. To the best of our knowledge, no 
prior systematic review attempt to synthesize the literature 
in the field of NFT games has been discovered. 
 
B. Search Keywords 
The systematic literature review research, according to 
Linnenluecke [9], should be replicable. Therefore, we list 
the search codes in Table I. The current study searches the 
literature using the Boolean operator. Non-fungible tokens 
and games are the keywords utilized in this study (games). 
The authors have searched for blockchain and 
cryptocurrency-related keywords. However, the vast 
majority, if not all, of literature containing the keywords 
blockchain and cryptocurrency is not relevant to the use of 
non-fungible tokens in computer games, online games, or 
mobile games. Numerous blockchain and cryptocurrency 
articles that mention games discuss the application of game 
theory to cryptocurrency mining or the use of 
cryptocurrency in a variety of settings, including supply 
chain management, energy supply, and many others. They 
are more concerned with strategy and competition analysis 
than with non-fungible tokens. Some involve purchasing 
computer games with cryptocurrency. To narrow the scope 
of the literature review, neither blockchain nor 
cryptocurrency is used as search terms. 
Despite the fact that this search formula is not 
exhaustive, the majority of relevant articles have been 
retrieved. In order to comprehend the current development 
and research focus of NFT games in all disciplines, the 
current study set the research domain to all fields, as 
opposed to limiting it to particular research fields. As is 
typical in systematic literature reviews, the search formula 
was used to search the title, keywords, and abstract. No date 
restrictions were placed on the search for literature on NFT 
games in the present study. The expiration date was 30 
November 2022.

III. LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTS 
Non-academic peer-reviewed articles and articles 
written in languages besides English were excluded from 
the current study's literature search.  
A. SSCI/SCI Expanded 
The initial database search of SSCI/SCI Expanded 
yielded six articles. All obtained articles' titles and abstracts 
are manually read by the authors. Additionally, we 
discovered that game is a commonly used term. Numerous 
articles stated that games were not comparable to NFT 
games. For instance, the articles containing the terms 
"game changer" [31], "game theory" (nonzero-sum games 
in game theory in the economics field), and "Bayesian 
game model" [32] did not pertain to computer games or 
NFT games. The term game is also used to describe the 
competition among miners in cryptocurrency mining. To 
eliminate irrelevant articles, we manually read the titles and 
abstracts of each one. For articles whose relevance was not 
evident from the title or abstract, full-text screening was 
conducted. After manual inspection, we've determined that 
all six articles in the SSCI/SCI Expanded database research 
NFT games. 
B. Scopus 
The initial Scopus search yielded twenty-five articles. 
The authors manually read the titles and abstracts of all the 
obtained articles and determined that eighteen of them 
contained NFT-related research. However, the search of the 
SSCI/SCI Expanded database already returns four articles. 
C. EBSCO Academic Search Ultimate 
The initial search of EBSCO Academic Search Ultimat 
yielded seven articles. The authors manually read the titles

and abstracts of all the obtained articles and determined that 
two of them contained NFT-related research. These two 
articles are additionally included in the SSCI/SCI 
Expanded database. 
D. IEEE Electronic Library 
Initial results from a search of the IEEE Electronic 
Library yielded eleven articles. The authors manually read 
the titles and abstracts of all the obtained articles and 
determined that seven of them contained NFT-related 
research. One article is additionally included in the 
SSCI/SCI Expanded database, and six papers are already 
included in the Scopus database. 
E. ACM Digital Library 
The initial ACM Digital Library search yielded twelve 
articles. The authors manually read the titles and abstracts 
of all the obtained articles and determined that four of them 
contained NFT-related research. Nonetheless, two 
additional articles are included in Scopus. 
We obtained a total of 23 articles from our database 
search. 
IV. LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTS 
A. Distribution of the Year of Publication 
 Table II illustrates the publication year distribution of 
NFT games articles. NFT game is a novel concept. Prior to 
2020, only one scholarly article was published. However, 
the number of published articles skyrocketed from one in 
2020 to nineteen in 2022. It is anticipated that research into 
NFT games will increase dramatically in the near future. 
B. Journal or Conference publication 
 In the field of computer science and information 
engineering, academic conferences are a vital source of 
information for emerging research fields. The lengthy 
review period of journals is a potential barrier to the 
dissemination of knowledge in emerging research fields. 
The number of NFT game articles published in journals or 
presented at conferences is shown in Table III. 
C. Frequently Used Keywords 
 The current study analyzed the co-occurrence of 
keywords using VOSviewer in order to determine the 
relationship between the keywords. There are 165 keywords 
for all articles on social media research. There are 16 
keywords that appear in two or more articles (Table IV). 
Figure 1 depicts the co-occurrences of the most prominent 
keywords in social-media influencers-related research 
articles. 
V. DISCUSSION 
NFT is a new invention that uses blockchain technology 
and can be used to identify in-game digital asset owners. It 
is a technology in development. To promote NFT games, a 
new business model, such as play-to-earn, is proposed. 
NFT games are accompanied by a variety of criticisms, 
such as Ponzi schemes. 
This study summarizes previous research on NFT 
games. Although a great deal of research has been 
conducted on NFT and blockchains, few studies have 
focused on NFT games. We discovered only 23 scholarly 
articles on NFT games. Due to the fact that this is a new 
and developing topic, it merits more consideration. We 
believe that the references uncovered in this study provide 
a useful introduction to the academic study of NFT games 
for those who are new to the research.
