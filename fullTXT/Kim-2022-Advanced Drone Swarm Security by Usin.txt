Abstract: This research contributes to the security design of an advanced smart drone swarm network
based on a variant of the Blockchain Governance Game (BGG), which is the theoretical game model
to predict the moments of security actions before attacks, and the Strategic Alliance for Blockchain
Governance Game (SABGG), which is one of the BGG variants which has been adapted to construct
the best strategies to take preliminary actions based on strategic alliance for protecting smart drones
in a blockchain-based swarm network. Smart drones are artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled drones
which are capable of being operated autonomously without having any command center. Analytically
tractable solutions from the SABGG allow us to estimate the moments of taking preliminary actions
by delivering the optimal accountability of drones for preventing attacks. This advanced secured
swarm network within AI-enabled drones is designed by adapting the SABGG model. This research
helps users to develop a new network-architecture-level security of a smart drone swarm which is
based on a decentralized network.

1. Introduction
Drones have been widely adapted for both the military and civilians in ways which
include criminal investigations, public safety, and surveillance forces [1]. Their dynamic
mobility, rapid reaction, and simple development offer new possibilities for applications
with affordable expenses [2–4]. A drone swarm is a coordination of multiple drones
in which they communicate to make decisions for collective actions. One application of a
drone swarm is a drone light show (see Figure 1) and this swarm has a central computer on
the ground that tracks all individual drones and controls their swarm behavior [5].

The movements of the drones are designed to achieve a flight path that minimizes the
collisions between the individual ones, while each individual drone does not contribute
in the decision making process [6]. Drone swarms are beneficial for performing casualty
strikes. Particularly in a militarized drone swarm, a smart drone swarm which is intel-
ligently guided without a control center has been considered as a single or integrated
AI-enabled weapon system [7]. One example is the 103 Perdix drones launched by the
Department of Defense (DOD) in 2016 [8]. The smart drones are operated by using artificial
intelligence (AI) that allows the drones to transform in several formations, fly across sample
battlefields, and update configuration factors [7–9]. A drone swarm could be adapted for
states lacking nuclear weapons and for assassination weapons. It could be also extended
for enhanced delivery systems for biochemical weapons [10].
Cybersecurity threats on drones have increased in sophistication, which increases
high risks for attacks in drone communications. Their deployments face huge difficulties
and criticism as a result. Recently, the vulnerability of DJI drones has been discovered
through drone hijacking [11]. The absence of suitable drone security mechanisms made
the attack possible [12]. The security treats in a military environment setting have brought
harmful effects that damage classified military information. The session hijacking attack
in a drone swarm is one of the examples in which an attacker is enabled to extract pre-
viously exchanged information for various malfunctioned activities [3]. For defending
these cybersecurity threats, blockchain technology has been adapted after being imple-
mented for cryptocurrency [13,14]. Blockchain-adapted security models have been widely
studied [15–19] because blockchain is highly secured by design and exemplifies a federated
computing system, although its records are alterable. Hence, blockchain-based network
security is even more extended to the drones [20,21].
The recent studies are targeted on the presence of Byzantine robots which allow
for logging events in a zero-knowledge proof to analyze the behavior of the robots in
the swarm without incurring the risk that some malicious agent has modified
them [13,15,16,22,23]. Blockchain-based smart contracts in autonomous robots allow de-
centralized systems with equally distrusting nodes to agree on the outcome of the pro-
grams [15,22]. The Autonomous Robots Go Swarming (ARGoS) model has been developed
for analyzing a collective decision scenario in a robot swarm [23]. Despite the presence of
Byzantine robots, blockchain technology allows a robot swarm to achieve consensus in a
collective decision problem [15,16].
The Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) and its variants have been designed for pre-
venting blockchain-based attacks and keeping the network decentralized [24,25]. The BGG
is the stochastic game model to predict the moments of taking preliminary security actions
before attacks [24]. One of the BGG variants is the Strategic Alliance for Blockchain Gover-
nance Game (SABGG), which introduces a strategic alliance within the nodes [25] instead
of keeping the backups [24] (see Figure 2). This innovative game model is applied for im-
proving drone securities in this research. The analytical function of the smart drone swarm
network architecture for enhancing securities and protecting from attackers is constructed
for avoiding a conventional drone attack in a swarm.

The advanced blockchain-based secured smart drone swarm network is a decentral-
ized network for drones in a swarm to defend attacks by adapting the SABGG. The SABGG
could secure the smart drones in a swarm on the network architecture level. The network
architecture level of security by using the BGG has been studied recently [26] and this
research is a successor of the BGG application. The objective of this research is adapting
an innovative mathematical model into a practical application. It is the first practical BGG
adaptation into a military domain, particularly, a network architecture security design in
a smart drone swarm communication. The mathematically proven SABGG model pro-
vides a guideline for actual implementations into real-world security situations, including
healthcare, Internet-of-Things, and federated machine learning, which is one of the main
advantages of this research.
The paper begins with the introduction of an advanced blockchain-based secured
smart drone swarm network and the smart drone swarm network is described by using
the BGG variant in Section 2. This stochastic game model predicts how many blocks are
generated and finds the moment of taking the security actions in advance. The mixed
strategic game for constructing a cost function of the model is also provided in this section.
The optimization of the drone swarm network for a special case is analytically calculated
and numerically simulated in Section 3. The paper finally ends with the conclusion in
Section 4.
2. Stochastic Game for Smart Drone Network Framework
The Strategic Alliance for Blockchain Governance Game (SABGG) [25] is applied into
the drone swarm network architecture to improve the communication network security.
Two players are involved in this game. One player is an attacker who intends to fork a
private chain and the other player is a defender who honestly mines blocks. The explicit
function from the SABGG predicts the moment of one step prior to 51 percent attack [24,25]
and this function is applied to a drone swarm network architecture.
2.1. Advanced Blockchain-Based Secured Smart Drone Swarm Network Structure
The advanced secured drone swarm network structure is considered when the drones
in a swarm are connected to one another and the swarm is hooked up as a single blockchain
network (see Figure 3). Although drones in a swarm are fully connected, they may not
be connected with a command center (or a control center). Such a drone swarm could
execute their commands artificially and independently despite their disconnection with a
command center. Each drone randomly generates unique data (e.g., GPS coordinates or
motor RPM values) and broadcasts these data to others. These activities are equivalent
with transactions in a typical blockchain network.
Figure 3. Adapting SABGG for the drone swarm network architecture.
Unlike other conventional blockchain networks, BGG-based networks do not have a re-
ward system but use the verifiable random function (VRF) for generating new blocks [27,28].
Alternatively, the weighted-mean-subsequence-reduced (WMSR) algorithm is designed for
achieving resilient consensus in decentralized sensor networks and smart robot
swarms [15,29–32]. By applying the VRF or WMSR on the EVM (Ethereum virtual ma-
Mathematics 2022, 10, 3338 4 of 13
chine), all drones in the swarm network shall have nearly equal chances to generate the
blocks without or only with minimal computational power. The mechanism for protecting
a smart drone swarm network is identical to the SABGG. The governance in a swarm
network is driven by the decision making parameters that include a prior time before
catching more than half of the total drones by an attacker.
2.2. SABGG Models for Advanced Blockchain-Based Secured Smart Drone Swarm Network
The SABGG which is a antagonistic game of two players describes the smart drone
swarm network structure. Each player becomes either a defender or an attacker (called “A”
and “B”). They compete each other to win the game by building blocks either for true or
false ones in a drone swarm network.
The probability space (Ω,F (Ω), P) is considered with independent σ-subalgebras
FA, FB, Fτ ⊆ F (Ω). Two processes
A := ∑
k≥0
Xkεsk , s0(= 0) < s1 < s2 < · · · , a.s. (1)
B := ∑
j≥0
Yjεtj , t0(= 0) < t1 < t2 < · · · , a.s. (2)
are FA-measurable and FB-measurable marked Poisson processes with respective inten-
sities λa and λb. These two values λa and λb represent the computing performance for
generating the blocks of an attacker and a defender in a blockchain network. The above
processes indicate the actions of players A (an attacker) and B (a defender). An attacker gen-
erates blocks with fake transactions and builds blocks of magnitudes X1, X2, . . . formalized
by this process. The processes A and B are transformed as follows:
E
[
gA(s)
]
= eλa(s)(g−1),E
[
zB(t)
]
= eλb(t)(z−1). (3)
This game system is monitored at random times in accordance with the point process
and this observation process is equivalent with the PoW (Proof-of-Work) completion
duration in a typical blockchain-based network:
T := ∑
i≥0
ετi , τ0(> 0), τ1, . . . , (4)
which is a delayed renewal process, and the formalization of the observation process is
as follows:
Aτ ⊗Bτ := ∑
k≥0
(Xk, Yk)ετk , (5)
and it is with position-dependent marking and with Xk and Yk being dependent with
the notation:
∆k := τk − τk−1, k = 0, 1, . . . , τ−1 = 0, (6)
and
γ(g, z) = E
[
gXk · zYk
]
, g > 0, z > 0. (7)
By using the double expectation,
γ(g, z) = δ(λa(1− g) + λb(1− z)), (8)
and
γ0(g, z) = E
[
gA0 zB0
]
= δ0(λA(1− g) + λb(1− z)), (9)
where

e−θτ0
]

Mathematics 2022, 10, 3338 5 of 13
are the magical transforms of increments τ1, τ2, . . . . The game is ended when the total
number of attacked drones Aj in the swarm network becomes more than the half of the
total drones in a swarm by player A or when player B keeps more than the half of the
total drones respectively in advance (i.e., Bl >
M
2 ). To further formalize the game, the exit
indexes are defined as follows:
ν := min
{
j : Aj (= A0 + X1 + · · ·+ Xj) ≥
(
M
2
)}
, (11)
ν1 := min
{
j : Aj (= A0 + X1 + · · ·+ Xj)− C ≥
(
M
2
)}
, (12)
µ := min
{
l : Bl(= B0 + Y1 + · · ·+ Yl) ≥
(
M
2
)}
, (13)
where C is the random number of available intact nodes (i.e., drones) and the capability
of the allies is less than the half of the total nodes in the network system (i.e., C < M
2 ).
The defender (player B) might still win the game even without requesting an alliance but
the chance of winning is lower than with a strategic alliance because an attacker should
govern both the allied nodes and half of the total nodes at tν. Contrarily, the attacker (player
A) could win the game at τµ when it takes the place beforehand. The game is ended at
min{ν, ν1, µ} and the σ-subalgebra of the process (A,B) can be analogously denoted as
F (Ω) ∩ {ν < ν1 < µ}. The confined game of player A is targeted. The first passage time
τν is the associated exit time from this confined game and formula (5) is modified as
At ⊗Bt :=
ν
∑
n≥0
(Xn, Yn)ε∆n , (14)
which provides an explicit definition of the basic model observed until tν and the joint
functional of the swarm network model is as follows:
ΦdM
2 e(ξ, g0, g1, b, z0, z1) = E
[
ξν · gAν−1
0 · gAν
1 · b
Aν−C · zBµ−1

, (15)
‖ξ‖ ≤ 1, ‖g0‖ ≤ 1, ‖g1‖ ≤ 1, ‖b‖ ≤ 1, ‖z0‖ ≤ 1, ‖z1‖ ≤ 1, (16)
where M indicates the total number of drones in the swarm network (see Figure 3).
The SABGG Theorem establishes an explicit formula ΦdM
2 e from (7)–(10). According to the
theorem in [25], the functional ΦdM
2 e of the process of (15) satisfies the following expression:
ΦdM
2 e(ξ, g0, g1, z0, z1) = D

and
Θ := γ(g0g1bqr, z0z1s), (19)
Θ0 := γ0(g0g1bqr, z0z1s), (20)
γ := γ(g1bq, z1), (21)
γ0 := γ0(g1bq, z1), (22)
γ1 := γ(g1b, z1), (23)
γ1

Γ := γ(br, s), (25)
Γ1 := γ(r, 1), (26)
σ := E

. (27)
Additionally, the operator D(a,b,c)
(q,r,s) in (17) is defined as follows [24,25]:
D
(a,b,c)
(q,r,s) (•) =


)

∂a∂b∂c
∂qa∂rb∂sc

(1−q)(1−r)(1−s) (•), a, b, c ≥ 0
0, otherwise.
(28)
and then we can find
h(a, b, c) = D
(a,b,c)
(q,r,s)
[
D(a,b,c) {h(a, b, c)}(q, r, s)
]
(29)
where
D(q,r,s)
(a,b,c) [h(a, b, c)] := (1− q)(1− r)(1− s)

h(a, b, c)qarbsc
}
, (30)
||q|| < 1, ||r|| < 1, ||s|| < 1. (31)
From (11)–(13), we can find the PGFs (probability-generating functions) of the exit
index ν:
E[ξν] = ΦdM
2 e(ξ, 1, 1, 1, 1), (32)
and the general decision making parameters are ν, τν−1, Aν, and Aν−1. Calculating a
marginal mean of certain parameters is occasionally more efficient than finding an explicit
PGF of each parameter, and the particular decision making parameters of the smart drone
swarm network can be found as follows:
E[τν−1] = E[τ0] +E[∆1](E[ν]− 1), (33)
E[Aν] = E[E[Aν|ν]] = E[A0] +E[ν− 1]E[Xk], (34)
E[Aν − C] = E[Aν]−E[C], (35)
E[Aν−1] = E[E[Aν|ν− 1]] = E[A0] +E[ν− 2]E[Xk]. (36)
2.3. Mixed Strategy Game Design for SABGG
A two-person mixed strategy game is considered for drone swarm security and player
B is a defender who has two strategies at each monitoring moment, one step before an
attacker completes generating alternative blocks with false transactions. Player B has
the following two strategies: (1) Regular—regular operations that the smart drone swarm
network is running as usual and (2) Safety—the network is operating under the safety
mode by executing a preliminary action in the drone swarm. In the view of player A (an
attacker), he might either succeed or fail to catch the intact drones. Therefore, the responses
of player A would be either NotBurst or Burst. Let us assume that the cost for maintaining
the alliance is cb, where b is the number of drones in a swarm. If the attacks succeed at
generating alternative blocks within the smart drones, the drone network bursts and the
whole value of the drone swarm V shall be lost. The drone swarm network might still be
busted although the smart drones are fully connected with its allies before catching blocks
by an attacker. In this case, the cost shall be counted by all drones in the swarm on top of
the alliance costs. The normal form of this game is as follows:
Mathematics 2022, 10, 3338 7 of 13
.Players: N = {A, B}. (37)
.Strategy sets: s
sa = {“NotBurst”, “Burst”}.
sb = {“Regular”, “Safety”}.
The conventional cost matrix at the prior time to burst at τν−1 could be constructed as
follows (see Table 1).
Table 1. Cost matrix.
NotBurst (1 − q(sb)) Burst (q(sb))
Regular 0 V
Safety cb cb + V
Here, q(sb) is the bursting probability of a swarm network, which depends on the
strategic decision of player B:
q(sb) =
E
[
1{Aν≥M
2 }
]
, sb = {Regular},
E
[
1{Aν−C≥M
2 }
]
, sb = {Safety},
(38)
and the alliance cost should be less than the cost of other strategies. Otherwise, player B
spends a greater cost for the strategic alliance than for the cost of a whole drone swarm.
Recalling from (38), the probability of bursting a blockchain network becomes a Poisson
compound process when the observation process is memoryless (see Section 3.1 in detail):
q(sb) =

∑k> N

]

. (40)
Although the total number of the drones in a swarm is determined, the actual alliance
C remains uncertain until an alliance request is actually accepted from others. Let us
assume that the number of available allied drones C follows the binomial distribution with
the average acceptance rate for each strategic ally as $. The Laplace transform of C (i.e., σ
from (27)) is as follows:
σ = E
[
b−C
]
=
($

)(M

. (41)
The number of allies C at the moment τν−1 might be arbitrary with satisfying the
number of allies C ∈
{
0, 1, . . . , M
2 − 1
}
. Even though any discrete random variable might
be considered for the strategic alliance, the binomial random variable well describes these
kinds of binary sum decision making situations. The optimal value $∗ is the mean of the
Bernoulli distribution when the intact drones are reserved. The rate of accountability $
could be defined as follows:
$∗ = inf
{
η ≥ 0 : S0

)
≥ S1($)
}
, (42)

Therefore,

3. The Optimization Practice for SABGG-Based Drone Security
The drone security optimization practice in a swarm network is introduced in this
section. The best strategy for defending a swarm network is providing the strategic alliance
to give the least chance for governing drones by an attacker with false command requests.
This practice case is targeting to optimize the accountability of the strategic alliance with
other drones in a swarm.
3.1. Special Case for Advanced Drone Swarm Security
The memoryless observation process has been adapted into various stochastic models
because the model does not need to spend any additional cost for the past information. This
special condition is practical particularly for the actual implementations (i.e., numerical
simulations or coding) of our theoretical model. It is noted that the operator D from (28) is
defined on the space of all analytic functions at 0. Under the memoryless condition, we
can explicitly find the solutions of q0 and pA−1 and calculate the exit index ν, the decision
making moments (i.e., τν and τν−1), and the probabilities of the number of blocks from (17).
To construct the cost function of the advanced drone swarm, Formulas (7)–(10) shall be
reformulated as follows:
γ(g, z) = δ(λa(1− g) + λb(1− z)) = γa(g) · γb(z), (48)
γa(g) = δ(λa(1− g)), (49)
γb(z) = δ(λb(1− z)), (50)
and
γ0(g, z) = δ0(λa(1− g) + λb(1− z)) = γ0
a(g) · γ0

γ0
a(g) = E

]
= δ0(λa(1− g)), (52)
γ0
b(z) = E
[

= δ0(λb(1− z)), (53)
From (20)–(28) and (48)–(53),
Θ = Θa ·Θb := γa(g0g1bqr) · γb(z0z1s), (54)
Θ0 = Θ0
a ·Θ0

γ = γaγb := γa(g1bq)γb(z1), (56)
γ0 = γ0

b := γ0
a(g1bq)γ0
b(z1), (57)
γ1 := γ(g1b, z1) = γa(g1b)γb(z1), (58)

b(z1), (59)
Γ := γ(br, s) = γa(br)γb(s), (60)
Γ1 := γ(r, 1) = γa(r) (61)
The memoryless observation process allows the process to be exponentially distributed
and the functionals from (48)–(61) are transformed as follows:
γ0

γ̃0 = E[τ0], γ̃ = E[∆k]. (70)
The first exceed level (also called the exit index) is the most vital factor that can be
fully analyzed at first [33]. Other decision making parameters, including the marginal
mean of τν−1, Aν, and Aν−1, can be easily calculated once the exit index is explicitly solved.
From (32) and (54)–(61), the functional of the exit index is as follows:
E[ξν] = ΦdM
2 e(ξ, 1, 1, 1, 1) = R1 + R2 − R3, (71)

The explicit solution of the first exceed index under the memoryless observation
from (71)–(76) is exactly the same as the solution of the SABGG, and the functional has
been analytically proven by Kim [25].
3.2. Linear Programming Practice
A drone swarm network security is considered for a linear programming (LP) practice.
The strategy direction for protecting the drone swarm is for priority connection with
neighbor drones to lower the change in an attacker catching blocks with false control
requests. This case deals with the drone swarm which consists of 20 AI-enabled drones
with the estimated cost of USD 1500 per each drone (see Table 2). It is noted that all values
shown in the table shall be only for demonstration purposes and these numeric values shall
be invested further for the real cases.
Table 2. Initial conditions for the smart drone swarm optimization.

· $ (USD) Cost for reserving nodes to avoid attacks per
each car
E[ν] 3 (trial) Average number of the observation until the
attacker governs the smart drone swarm
C ≤ M
2 (drone) Random number of accepted drones at τν−1
Since the SABGG-based advanced drone swarm network has been analytically solved,
calculating the values for the cost function and the required probability distributions is
straightforward. The LP model based on the above conditions is as follows from (43)–(46):

The total cost S($) shall be minimized by the given $, which is the optimal value of the
alliance accountability (i.e., the acceptance rate). The illustration in Figure 4 visualizes an
optimal result by using the SABGG-based drone swarm network with the given conditions.
According to the initial setup in Table 2, the minimal cost for executing one smart drone
swarm operation is USD 876 when the drone swarm keeps a 48 percent acceptance rate
(i.e., $∗ = 0.48) for the alliance request to other drones. The moment of alliance request
τν−1 shall be one step prior to the time when an attacker catches more than half of the
total drones. This practice is targeted only for visualizing cost optimization, not for simu-
lating smart drone management. It is noted that the visualization (see Figure 4) is aimed for
showing how the SABGG closed forms (e.g., (17) and (78)) could be applied for analyzing
the operation costs of a secured smart drone swarm.

4. Conclusions
An advanced secure drone swarm network architecture protects a drone swarm from
an attacker by adapting a blockchain governance game variant. The Strategic Alliance for
Blockchain Governance Game (SABGG) which is an analytically proven game model has
been applied as a blockchain governance game variant. The SABGG has been adapted
for a decentralized network to improve drone swarm security. The special SABGG case
demonstrates how the theoretical model is actually implemented for smart drone security.
Although this research is still theoretical and there are several steps remaining for actual
implementation into real drones, the practical case demonstrates how an SABGG network
could be implemented for smart drone securities and its feasibility. This paper is the first
piece of research that applies an SABGG model into a swarm network architecture security.
The advanced smart drone swarm network is the successor of blockchain-governance-
game-based IoT security applications, particularly in the intelligent military domain. The
managerial aspects and actual implementations of smart drone operations could be the
next step. Additionally, expending the domains for applying the BGG and its variants
could definitely be another direction of future research.
