Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is becoming a prominent
topic and demonstrating the development trend of integration
with other theories in order to achieve an efficient allocation of
electricity resources in the electric vehicle (EV) market. In this
article, we present a novel Secure iNtra-regional-Inter-regional
P2P Electricity Trading System (SNIPPETS) for EVs. A trading
information prediction model is constructed based on Ensemble
Learning, upon which an intra-regional-inter-regional trading
mechanism is proposed to find the optimal electricity allocation
strategy, including the price and volume of electricity traded
between EVs, in order to maximize the regional overall social
welfare. In the intra-regional-inter-regional trading mechanism,
multi-objective optimization is performed within each region to co-
ordinately maximize the benefits of different types of EVs, followed
by an investigation of pricing competition among neighboring re-
gions based on a supermodular game. Furthermore, blockchain
is introduced to support transaction payments and improve data
security and privacy. Finally, the proposed SNIPPETS is validated
through case studies. Compared to the traditional energy trading
system and representative existing trading systems, SNIPPETS
can effectively improve the regional overall social welfare and has
higher computational efficiency.

I. INTRODUCTION
IN RECENT years, the continual deployment of distributed
energy resources has introduced new opportunities as well as
challenges to the electrical market, particularly the transaction
pattern of the market. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, a
new transaction pattern, has been proposed in this context to
better coordinate distributed energy. Instead of the traditional
hierarchical grid structure, P2P electricity trading platforms
offer a flat network architecture that encourages distributed node
interaction while also providing competition in a transparent

market [1]. Several studies have shown that P2P electricity
trading not only allows participants to earn significant revenues
from it [2], but also facilitates the power grid to reduce peak
demand [3] and improve reliability [4].
On account of these advantages, increasing attention has been
paid to the investigation of P2P electricity trading. To mention
a few, [5] suggested a P2P electricity trading strategy based on
the maximum and minimum electricity to guarantee the prof-
itability of both consumers by considering the actual electricity
market structure of South Korea. [6] investigated the internal
mechanism of a community P2P electricity trading system and
designed a three-layer framework to implement the system
in practice. [7] established P2P electricity trading, combining
flexible resources and various on-site generation to provide sig-
nificant economic benefits to individual customers and industrial
sites. [8] reported a localized electricity market architecture for
P2P electricity trading among residential prosumers with smart
meters, renewable energy resources, and home energy manage-
ment systems. Specific to the field of electric vehicles (EVs),
P2P electricity trading allows EVs to participate in electricity
transactions and thereby increase the energy efficiency of the
distribution network by actively trading and sharing electricity.
Since [9] introduced P2P electricity trading to the EV area, a
lot of breakthroughs in related research have been made, the
majority of which are focused on optimizing the benefits of
trade participants. To name a few, [10] designed an EV bidding
agent that can realize benefits for EVs and leveling effect of the
power demand through the day. [11] presented a system based
on the quality of service to match single-consumers to multiple-
providers and multiple-consumers to multiple-providers based
on the needs of various EVs, resulting in resilient and reliable
transactions. For inter-regional P2P electricity trading, [12] in-
troduced the superconductive magnetic energy storage technol-
ogy, which improves the success rate of user matching.
Overall, according to the trading process and the mode of
information interaction between participants, P2P electricity
markets can be divided into decentralized markets and coordi-
nated markets [13]. In a decentralized market, the trading process
and the information interaction are carried out in a decentralized
manner, thus better protecting data security and privacy [2].
However, due to the lack of centralized control [14], decen-
tralized markets are relatively inefficient, and social welfare
cannot be maximized [13]. In a coordinated market, peers within
a P2P network communicate and trade through a centralized
coordinator, and the benefits of the entire P2P trading network
are allocated among the buyers and sellers according to rules

predetermined by the coordinator [13]. Although coordinated
markets compromise on the degree of decentralization, their
key advantage is the ability to maximize social welfare [15].
Meanwhile, one of the latest developments in P2P electricity
trading with EVs is the introduction of blockchain [16]. It
can improve the energy efficiency of electricity trading and
enhance the security and privacy of transaction data, thus com-
pensating to some extent for the weaknesses of coordinated
markets.
Despite the fact that numerous advances have been achieved
in the area of P2P electricity trading with EVs, there are still
some research gaps. First, electricity consumption prediction
is needed to obtain a range of future P2P electricity trading
volumes, but few of the existing studies have considered the
impact of occupants’ electricity use behavior on their electricity
consumption. Besides, previous research on P2P trading has
a number of unaddressed issues that make it challenging to
improve the overall social welfare of all trading participants. For
example, there is a potential benefit conflict between electricity
buyers and sellers, where buyers and sellers have opposing
preferences for trading prices, but existing studies often do not
address this issue head-on and do not suggest ways to reconcile
the conflict directly. As another example, existing studies mostly
consider P2P trading only within local regions, without taking
into account potential competition among neighboring regions.
Motivated by the above discussions, we propose a Secure iNtra-
regional-Inter-regional P2P Electricity Trading System (SNIP-
PETS) in a coordinated market in this study, where an intra-
regional-inter-regional transaction mechanism is developed to
enhance regional overall social welfare including the benefits of
all EVs and all aggregators (AGs, aka coordinators). Ethereum is
also deployed to compensate for data security and privacy. Case
studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness and superiority
of the proposed SNIPPETS. The main contributions of this paper
are summarized as follows:
1) We propose a coordinated P2P market that is more prac-
ticable in the near future, consisting of different mar-
ket participants: electricity buyers, electricity sellers, and
a regional coordinator. Furthermore, a two-stage intra-
regional-inter-regional trading mechanism is designed for
the proposed market.
2) We develop an EV electricity consumption prediction
model based on Ensemble Learning, which learns from
historical data about external conditions (e.g., battery type,
driving status, etc.) as well as users’ energy use behavior
(e.g., more wasteful or more frugal) to predict EVs’ future
electricity consumption. Tests on real data demonstrate the
high accuracy of the established prediction model, which
facilitates subsequent P2P electricity trading.
3) We propose a coordination method based on a multi-
objective optimization problem (MOP) to optimize the
allocation of electricity within each geographical region in
SNIPPETS, which addresses the benefit conflicts between
electricity buyers and sellers.
4) We propose a supermodular game to model the price com-
petition across geographically neighboring regions and
to reach a Nash equilibrium. Simulation results indicate

that our model has a significant impact on improving the
overall social welfare of the market.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the system architecture of SNIPPETS. Section III
explains the procedures and detailed trading rules of P2P elec-
tricity trading in SNIPPETS. Section IV proposes the related
algorithms and Section V shows the simulation results, respec-
tively. Section VI concludes the paper.
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OF SNIPPETS
In this section, a novel decentralized P2P electricity trading
system, i.e., SNIPPETS, is proposed and the specific system
architecture is shown in Fig. 1.
It is observed from Fig. 1 that the whole trading area can be
geographically divided into k (k ∈ K = {1, 2, . . .,K}) regions,
where each region contains one AG, several EVs and charging
piles. This paper assumes the electricity trading takes place in the
slot-ahead market and considers a time-slotted system, where
time is denoted as t ∈ T = {1, 2, . . ., T} and the duration of
each time slot is 60 minutes. Before the starting of a time slot
t, each EV determines the electricity amount range to trade in
t and send this transaction information to the local AG, then
the information will be spread to all neighboring intermediaries
through the communication network. With the participation of
both the local AG and neighboring AGs, the electricity buyers
and sellers reach an agreement and complete the transaction
through an intra-regional-inter-regional transaction mechanism.
After that, the transaction data would be updated on Ethereum.
On the one hand, Ethereum has properties, such as decentraliza-
tion and tamper-proofness, which enables electricity trading to
be executed in decentralized, transparent, and secure market en-
vironments and can improve the security of transactions. On the
other hand, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has
a smart contract function, where it is easier to define transaction
rules, and the transaction payments and information storage are
executed through these pre-defined rules.
The P2P electricity trading model of SNIPPETS includes the
following entities:
1) EVs: EVs play different roles in SNIPPETS, e.g., electricity
buyers (charging EVs), electricity sellers (discharging EVs),
and other EVs without charging or discharging needs that are
not considered in our research. Each EV chooses its role and

determines the electricity trading range based on the current state
of charge (SOC) and the electricity consumption prediction.
2) AGs (Electricity Intermediary): AGs act as electricity in-
termediaries in SNIPPETS. They provide EVs with access to
the electricity market and wireless communication services [17].
After receiving the transaction information from local and neigh-
boring EVs, the AG would organize transactions among EVs
based on all collected information.
3) Charging Piles: each charging pile in SNIPPETS has a
built-in smart meter for calculating and recording transactions in
real time. EVs could go to charging piles to charge or discharge,
then electricity buyers pay sellers for the electricity through in-
termediaries according to the records in smart meters of charging
piles.
4) Ethereum: Ethereum supports the proposed energy trading
mechanism as a payment instrument and distributed database
in SNIPPETS, where each EV and each AG has an Ethereum
account for the payment process. Under the organization of AGs,
once the P2P energy trading details (including the traders, vol-
ume, price, etc.) are determined, buyers and sellers will complete
the payment and receipt via the regional AGs and Ethereum.
Then, the detailed transaction and payment information will
be recorded on Ethereum. During this process, an API named
web3.py will be used to realize the information interactions
between the trading mechanism and Ethereum, as shown in
Fig. 2.
III. P2P ELECTRICITY TRADING SYSTEM
In this section, the main elements of the proposed SNIP-
PETS such as the EV consumption prediction model, the intra-
regional-inter-regional transaction mechanism, and the private
Ethereum are presented, where the details of P2P electricity
trading rules and procedures of SNIPPETS are elaborated.
A. Determination of Electricity Trading Amount Range
This subsection shows how to determine the EV electricity
trading amount range. An electricity consumption model is
firstly designed to predict the electricity consumption during
the next time slot and then combined with consideration of the
current SOC of EVs to determine the range of electricity trading
amount.
Fig. 3. Technical framework of the EV consumption prediction model.
1) Electricity Consumption Prediction Model: The existing
methods to predict EV electricity consumption can be divided
into two categories, i.e., indirect methods and direct methods.
Indirect methods predict the electricity demand through interme-
diate variables, such as daily agendas consisting of a sequence of
episodes [9], while direct methods predict the electricity demand
by establishing a mapping between the available data set and the
electricity consumption [18]. In real-world scenarios, the direct
methods may be more efficient than the indirect methods, thus
this paper focuses on predicting the EV electricity demand in a
direct manner. In particular, a new prediction model based on
the LightGBM algorithm is proposed, which uses the operating
data of 87 pure EVs in Beijing from October to December
2019 [19] to predict the EVs’ electricity consumption during
the next time slot, then take it as an input for subsequent P2P
electricity trading research. Table I presents the original data
classified into three categories, i.e., time, vehicle information,
and charging information.
As shown in Fig. 3, the prediction model is built with four
steps, i.e., data preprocessing, feature engineering, model de-
signing, and result analysis. Firstly, we perform data prepro-
cessing by removing and filtering abnormal data. Then, we
carry out the feature engineering to generate the feature set,
where the basic information (daq_time, soc, etc.) in Table I
is adopted as basic features. Afterward, category features such
as mileage features, electricity consumption features, temporal
features, and electricity consumption behavioural features are
derived through data attribute integration and segmentation. In
particular, the electricity consumption behavioral feature is to
compare a user’s electricity consumption per unit distance per
unit time, with the average of ones of all other users under similar
conditions. This feature reflects the “level of wastefulness” of
the user’s electricity use behavior.
Then, features related to electricity consumption prediction
are selected according to the feature importance, and the feature
set is generalized hereto. After the feature engineering stage,
the LightGBM algorithm is utilized to predict EV electricity
consumption during a time slot. Finally. the indexes of Accuracy
and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are introduced to judge
the predictive effect of the established model. Fig. 4 shows the
training process and the effectiveness of the proposed model,
where for the training set and the validation set respectively, the

accuracy can be greater than 95% and the RMSE scores can be
less than 6.
In actual applications, based on the EV’s basic information
(battery type, capacity, etc.) and vehicle real-time information
obtained by sensors (soc, latitude, longitude, etc.), EVs only
need to input the expected mileage in the next time slot as
mileage features, then the estimated electricity consumption can
be given by the model as is illustrated in Fig. 5.
2) EV Classification: After predicting the EV electricity con-
sumption of the next time slot and considering each EV’s current

SOC, two different groups of EVs are found in our research, i.e.,
Electricity Buyers (EBs) and Electricity Sellers (ESs). In view
of the uncertainty of electricity trading demand in actual trading
scenarios, we determine the amount range of trading electricity
in what follows by discussing the minimum and maximum
trading electricity amount of these two groups, respectively.
- EBs are expected to be unable to meet their electricity
demand in the next time slot with the remaining electricity,
i.e., the EBs need to be charged in the next time slot and will
participate in P2P electricity transactions as buyers. We denote
each EB as EBi with i ∈ I = {1, 2, . . ., I}, the corresponding
minimum electricity demand value di,min and maximum elec-
tricity demand value di,max of EBi are described as
di,min = min
[

i − STOt
i , di,max
]
, ∀i ∈ I, (1)
di,max = STO0
i − STOt
i , ∀i ∈ I, (2)
where cEB
i is the predicted electricity consumption of EBi
given by the prediction model, STOt
i is the current battery state
of EBi at time t and STO0
i denotes the battery capacity of
EBi. Therefore, the expected electricity trading range of EBi
is (di,min, di,max).
- ESs are expected to have surplus electricity in the next time
slot, i.e., they do not need any intermediate charging during the
next time slot and have the willingness to sell the surplus elec-
tricity to get additional income. Similarly, we denote each ES as
ESj with j ∈ J = {1, 2, . . ., J}, the corresponding minimum

and maximum electricity supply value of ESj are described as
sj,min = 0, ∀j ∈ J , (3)
sj,max = STOt
j − cES
j , ∀j ∈ J , (4)
where cES
j is the predicted electricity consumption of ESj
given by the prediction model, STOt
j is the current battery state
of ESj at time t and STO0
j denotes the battery capacity of
ESj . Therefore, the expected electricity trading range of ESj
is (sj,min, sj,max).
We present the aforementioned operating data of 87 pure
EVs [19] in Fig. 6, which shows the electricity trading demand
distribution of EBs and ESs respectively during a time slot. To be
more specific, we feed the data [19] into the electric consumption
prediction model to obtain the predicted electricity consumption
of EVs. Then the EVs are divided into energy buyers and sellers
according to the methodology in Section III-A2, and their energy
trading demands, i.e. the di,min of buyers and the sj,max of
sellers, are determined respectively and finally used to create
Fig. 6.
It can be observed that most EBs require a small amount of
electricity less than 10 kWh, while most ESs have more than
20 kWh of electricity storage to trade. This suggests that the
existing electricity utilization efficiency of EVs can be greatly
improved and the P2P trading may be helpful to facilitate the
utilization of idle electricity.
B. Intra-Regional Electricity Allocation Optimization
This subsection aims to optimize the trading electricity allo-
cation of EBs and ESs within the region such that the benefits
of EBs and ESs can be maximized. As presented in Section II,
the whole trading area is divided into several regions with one
AG acting as an electricity intermediary in each region, and the
intermediary in the regionk is denoted asAGk withk ∈ K.AGk
could communicate with every local EV to establish a real-time
electricity trading market and promote electricity trading [20].
In region k, we denote each EB as EBk
i with i ∈ I and each
ES as ESk
j with j ∈ J . In transactions, any EB/ES could trade
electricity with multiple ESs/EBs simultaneously. The trading
electricity amount dki denotes the overall electricity actually pur-
chased byEBk
i and the trading electricity amount skj denotes the
overall electricity actually sold by EBk
i , and the corresponding
expressions are

where dki,j is the electricity amount bought by EBk

efficiency.
Denote ωi as the charging willingness constant of EBk
i , then
the utility function of EBk
i is described as
U(EBk
i ) =

ln(dki − dki,min + 1). (7)
The corresponding cost function of EBk
i is
C(EBk

where
C1(EBk
i ) = qdki (9)

Once the local intermediary receives the electricity trading
range information from local EBs and ESs, it will share the
information with neighboring intermediaries through the com-
munication network. By utilizing the collected electricity trading
information of local and neighboring EVs, the optimization
problem (15) will be organized by the intermediaries in the local
region and every neighboring region. The optimization problem
needs to weigh the benefits of both EBs and ESs, therefore, we re-
gard it as a MOP that contains multiple objective functions. The
purpose of the MOP is to find the optimal electricity allocation
strategy that balances all optimization objectives well, that is,
find the Pareto set that contains all Pareto optimality allocations
and does not exist any so-called Pareto improvement [21].
To maximize the overall benefit of both EBs and ESs and
find optimal electricity allocation solutions (Pareto set), each
intermediary needs to solve the MOP (15) within the region. A
variant of methods can be utilized to find the Pareto set of the
MOP, such as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
(NSGA-II), the Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization
(MOPSO), etc. Considering the Multi-objective Evolutionary
Algorithm Based on Decomposition(MOEA/D) [22] possesses
lower time and space complexity, thus we introduce it to solve
the MOP in this paper and the detailed process is described in
Algorithm 1 of Section IV-A.
C. Inter-Regional Price Competition Game
This subsection takes into account the price competition
among neighboring regions to determine the electricity price of
each region, where the competition mechanism and correspond-
ing characteristics are analyzed based on the Supermodular
game theory.
1) Preliminaries of Supermodular Game: Supposing that all
the intermediaries of neighboring regions participate in the
electricity price competition and that each intermediary has its
individual benefit to maximize selfishly, this can be described
as a non-cooperative game.
Supermodular game is one of the most important non-
cooperative game theories and it provides a general and
brief method for analyzing games with complementary strate-
gies [23]. Specifically, when one player takes a higher action
in the supermodular game, the best response of the others
is to increase the strategies as well, which is applicable to
our inter-regional competition situation. Herein, we adopt the
supermodular game theory to describe the inter-regional price
competition such that the electricity price of each region can
be determined. In the following, two definitions related to the
supermodular game are presented:
Definition 1: F is a function from the lattice S to the real
number set R, i.e. F : S −→ R. In the case of function F (x)
is twice differentiable, F (x) is supermodular if the following
inequality holds [24]:
∂2F (x)
∂xi∂xj
≥ 0, ∀x ∈ S, j �= i. (16)
Definition 2: A game is a supermodular game, if 1) The set
of strategies Si of player i is a compact subset of R and 2) F is
supermodular.
2) Formulation of Supermodular Game: We formulate the
inter-regional price competition mechanism in SNIPPETS as a
static non-cooperative game based on supermodular game the-
ory. The game takes place in the local region and all neighboring
regions, where each intermediary acts as a game participant
and determines its regional pricing strategy. During the game,
intermediaries do not cooperate with each other, i.e., they set
the strategies independently and selfishly by considering other
players’ strategies of the last round so as to maximize individual
benefits. Specifically, we formulate the competition and interac-
tion among regions as follows:
Players: Intermediaries from a local region and its neighbor-
ing regions.
Strategy: The player’s strategy is to adjust the regional elec-
tricity trading price within the region. In other
words, the strategy of AGk is to set the electric-
ity price pk, where pk ∈ (0,mp0) limits the price
in a reasonable range, p0 indicates the real-time
power grid electricity price and m ∈ R+ is a con-
stant. We use p−k = (p1, . . ., pk−1, pk+1, . . ., pK)
to denote the electricity price vectors of AGk’s
all neighboring intermediaries and each component
pl ofp−k satisfies pl ∈ (0,mp0)(1 ≤ l ≤ K, l �= k)
as well.
Benefit: The regional benefit πk(pk,p−k) of AGk is related
to the monetary income obtained by AGk.
In this case, πk(pk,p−k) is expressed as
πk(pk,p−k) = pkgk(pk,p−k), (17)
where gk(pk,p−k) is the total regional electricity trading de-
mands of EBs in response to the electricity prices and is given

x+mαkp0 − θk
mp0(αk +
∑K
l=1,l �=k βk,l)
, (19)
whereαk > 0 is the demand response coefficient for the price of
AGk, βk,l > 0 is the demand response coefficient for the cross-
price of AGk with its neighbors, and θk indicates the market
share of AGk.
As each intermediary wants to maximize the individual benefit
by setting its electricity price, AGk must solve the following
maximization problems to determine pk:
max
pk∈R+
πk(pk,p−k)
s.t. k ∈ K (20)
and the solution p∗k of (20) can be written as
p∗k = argmax
pk∈R+
πk(pk,p−k). (21)
3) Supermodularity and Convergence of the Game: This
subsection verifies the price competition game among regional
intermediaries is a supermodular game and shows the conver-
gence of the game based on its supermodularity.
According to the definitions of the supermodular game in
Section III-C1, the sufficient condition for the benefit function
of the intermediary having the supermodularity is
∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
≥ 0. (22)
To check (22), take the derivative of (17), we get
∂πk(pk,p−k)
∂pk
= gk(pk,p−k) + pk
∂gk(pk,p−k)
∂pk
, (23)
∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
=
∂gk(pk,p−k)
∂pl
+ pk
∂2gk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
, (24)
where
∂gk(pk,p−k)
∂pl
=
dki,max − dki,min
mp0(αk +
∑K
l=1,l �=k βk,l)
βk,l ≥ 0,
(25)
pi
∂2gk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
= 0. (26)
Therefore, it is obvious that (22) holds, i.e., the inter-regional
price competition game is a supermodular game indeed.
Then, we analyze the convergence of the game. It is well-
known that there must be a Nash equilibrium for the supermod-
ular game and according to [25], the condition for the existence
of the unique Nash equilibrium is
−∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂2pk
≥
∑
k �=l
∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
. (27)
Recalling (24), (25) and (26), we obtain
∑
k �=l
∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂pk∂pl
=
dki,max − dki,min
mp0(αk +
∑K
l=1,l �=k βk,l)
K∑
l=1,l �=k
βk,l.
(28)
On the other hand, the following equations can be derived from
(23), i.e.,
−∂2πk(pk,p−k)
∂2pk
= 2αk
dki,max − dki,min
mp0(αk +
∑K
l=1,l �=k βk,l)
. (29)
Substituting (28) and (29) into (27), we know that the super-
modular game of this paper has a unique Nash equilibrium if
and only if
2αk ≥
K∑
l=1,l �=k
βk,l. (30)
Based on the study in [24], the Nash equilibrium can be
obtained with the best response algorithms, therefore, we adopt
the idea of the best response algorithm to realize the supermod-
ular game process and finally obtain the Nash equilibrium, i.e.,
each intermediary determines its regional electricity price and
corresponding benefits. (More details of the algorithm can be
found in Algorithm 2 of Section IV-A.)
After the regional electricity price determination process of
each intermediary through Algorithm 2, the final bid-winning
intermediary and its region will be chosen according to the
following optimization problem:
min
k
[∑
i
(δ1pkd
k

]
s.t. dki = gk(pk,p−k), k ∈ K, (31)
where ri,k denote the geographical distance between EBi and
region k, a > 0 and b > 0 are constants indicating the distance
influence, δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 are the the influence coefficients
on decision making, δ1 represents the payment influence and δ2
represents the geographical distance influence.
Once the trading region and its electricity price are deter-
mined, the total regional electricity trading demand is then
determined by (18), with which we can select the optimal
electricity allocation scheme from the Pareto set generated in
Section III-B. Finally, the payment amount that EBk
i will pay
the chosen intermediary is
pay(EBk

and the payment amount that ESk

diary is

IV. ALGORITHMS
A. Electricity Allocation Optimization Algorithm
In order to solve the intra-regional MOP in Section III-B
and find the Pareto Set, we design an electricity allocation
optimization algorithm based on the MOEA/D algorithm [22].
The idea of the algorithm is to transform the MOP into a
series of single-objective optimization sub-problems (SOPs),
and then use the adjacent SOPs’ information to optimize each
SOP simultaneously by evolutionary algorithms. Considering
each solution on the Pareto front corresponds to the optimal
solution of every SOP, as a consequence, a set of Pareto optimal
solutions can be finally obtained by solving the MOP. We use
the Tchebycheff approach as the decomposition strategy, which
is presented as follows:
min gte (x | λ∗, z∗) = max
1�m≤M
{λm |fm(x)− z∗m|}
s.t. x ∈ Ω, (35)
where fi(x) is the objective function, gte is the new objec-
tive function obtained by using Tchebycheff decomposition
strategy, z∗ = {z∗1 , . . ., z∗M} is the reference point with z∗m =
max{fm(x) | x ∈ Ω} for ∀m = 1, . . .,M . For each Pareto op-
timal solutionx∗, there always exists a weight vector λ∗ such that
the solution of (35) is a Pareto optimal solution corresponding
to the optimal solution of the original MOP. The details of the
algorithm can be found in Algorithm 1.
B. Electricity Price Competition Game Algorithm
In order to solve the inter-regional competition problem in
Section III-C formulated by the supermodular game, we adopt
the idea of the best response algorithm to realize the game
process and obtain the Nash equilibrium, which means the

TRANSACTION DETAILS OF REGION k IN SNIPPETS
V. CASE STUDY
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
SNIPPETS on a real dataset in an urban area of Beijing [19]. The
latitude of the observed area is from 36.129 to 42.595 and the
longitude is from 115.885 to 118.543. We randomly take the data
on 06 December 2019 as an example. The cost factors l1 is taken
as 0.01 and l2 is taken as 0.015 in (10) and (14), respectively.
The average electricity transmission efficiency coefficient ρ is
taken as 0.9 while the convergence thresholds ε and ε are taken
as 0.001.
To show the general trend of daily electricity prices, we
use a real electricity price dataset [26] to stack grid electricity
price movement graphs for one month in Fig. 7, where each
line represents the price of electricity for one day (0:00 to
24:00), in order to show the general trend in electricity prices
over a 24-hour period, including peak and trough periods. It
demonstrates that the power grid electricity price is relatively
high between 7:00 to 22:00, which is exactly the time when
P2P transactions are most likely to occur. The power grid elec-
tricity price and hourly average transaction electricity prices of
SNIPPETS over one day are depicted in Fig. 8. According to
Fig. 8, the transaction price is lower when trading in our proposed
P2P trading system compared to trading directly with the grid
between 7:00 to 22:00. However, the price difference is not
much at night since the power grid price falls and most EVs are
inactive at night, which is in accordance with practical situations.
Fig. 8 mainly demonstrates two advantages of our proposed
trading system: 1) the proposed P2P trading mechanism can
reduce costs in terms of electricity trading price, and 2) the
proposed P2P energy trading can bring a leveling effect to
reduce fluctuations in load, therefore reducing the cost of power
plants [10].
To reveal more details about the transactions, we randomly
selected the data at 19:00-20:00 on 06 December 2019, where
transactions take place in six regions totally during this time
slot. Taking region 2 as an example, after the intra-regional
optimization mechanism, i.e. Algorithm 2, a set of solutions
for the optimal electricity allocation in the region is generated,
as shown in Fig. 9, where each point represents the amount of
electricity sold by an ES to an EB.
Since region 2 and its two neighboring regions are involved
in one game, thus we take them as an example. Fig. 10 shows
the convergence evolution of the benefits of the intermediaries
in regions 1-3 achieved by Algorithm 2, where all the regional
benefits converge after only several iterations.
In order to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of
the proposed trading system, we next compare it with some
other trading systems.In addition to the proposed SNIPPETS,
the systems involved in the comparison include
1) PETCON: PETCON is proposed by [27] for the EV P2P
energy trading scenario. PETCON uses an iterative double auc-
tion mechanism to determine energy trading schemes among
EVs.
2) Stackelberg Game-Based Trading System: the trading sys-
tem proposed by [28] is used for P2P energy trading, where
the Stackelberg game approach is used to model the interaction
between energy buyers and sellers.
3) Traditional Trading System: in a traditional electricity
trading scenario, once EBs have predicted the future electricity
consumption and determined their trading demands, they pur-
chase electricity directly from the power grid at the real-time grid
tariff. Since there are no more intermediaries in the traditional
energy trading system, the social welfare function differs slightly
from (34), where the benefits of intermediaries are no longer
considered, i.e. the overall social welfare is
SWk=
∑
i∈I
[U(EBk
i )−C(EBk
i )]+
∑
j∈J
[U(ESk
j )− C(ESk
j )].
(36)
Comparing SNIPPETS with the trading systems described
above, we present the comparison results in several aspects.
Fig. 11 shows the transaction iteration number comparison
of SNIPPETS, PETCON [27], and Stackelberg game-based
trading system [28] for all the regions, where it is observed the
proposed SNIPPETS requires fewer iterations to reach the Nash
equilibrium.
Table II shows the solution time required for these P2P trading
systems. It can be seen that the proposed SNIPPETS takes the
shortest time compared to PETCON [27] and the Stackelberg
game-based trading system [28], which indicates that SNIP-
PETS has the best algorithmic computing performance.

Further, we show the comparison results of regional overall
social welfare, which is composed of the benefit of EBs, ESs,
and the regional intermediary as defined in (34). In particular,
we compare the regional overall social welfare of the proposed
SNIPPETS, PETCON [27], Stackelberg game-based trading
system [28], and the traditional trading system. The comparison
results are presented in Fig. 12. It can be seen that SNIPPETS
has the highest regional overall social welfare compared to other
trading systems, indicating that the proposed SNIPPETS can be
effective in improving the overall social welfare of the regions.
Finally, we demonstrate how the coordinated P2P energy
trading market could be implemented on blockchain as a dig-
ital platform. Indeed, blockchain offers an achievable way to
construct a secure and privacy-preserving trading environment
due to its inherent technical characteristics, such as traceabil-
ity, immutability, transparency, and automation [29]. Therefore,
Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain with smart contract func-
tionality [30], is used to execute the payment process. In the
transaction, we create one account with 10000 ETH for each
EV and one account with 10000 ETH for each AG. When the
transaction details are determined under the coordination of the
intermediary, each EB pays for the electricity with an additional
commission charge to the intermediary, and the intermediary
transfers the payment to ESs after deducting the commission
charge for ESs. The payment information for each participant is
then written to their accounts. Taking Region k for example,
its detailed transaction information is shown in Table III to
represent the deployment of Ethereum, where each transaction
that occurs on Ethereum corresponds to a unique ID and shows
that the transaction process has been completed on Ethereum.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel P2P electricity trading sys-
tem with EVs named SNIPPETS. The system addressed benefit
conflicts between electricity traders, as well as price competition
among neighboring regions, thereby improving overall social
welfare.
SNIPPET is made up of the following components. To begin, a
LightGBM-based prediction model was constructed, which used
category information and driving data of EVs to classify them
into different categories and predict their electricity trading vol-
ume. Then, an intra-regional-inter-regional transaction mecha-
nism was proposed for SNIPPETS to maximize social welfare
throughout the transaction, where the MOEA/D algorithm was
developed to solve the MOP for coordinating benefits of all
EBs and ESs within each neighboring region by adjusting the
trading volume, and the supermodular game theory was adopted
to model the price competition among neighboring regions using
the trading price as the main variable. Furthermore, Ethereum
was deployed to execute the payment process and record the
transaction data.
The effectiveness of SNIPPETS was verified through simula-
tion experiments. The results show that 1) the proposed energy
consumption prediction model has good predictive effective-
ness. 2) SNIPPETS requires fewer iterations and shorter solution
time compared to other trading systems. 3) SNIPPETS can
achieve the highest overall social welfare when compared to
other trading systems.
A limitation of our study is that the Ethereum module of
SNIPPETS only supports transaction payments and data stor-
age, and lacks the protection of transaction information during
the trading process. Future research needs to focus on better
integration of blockchain into energy trading systems to achieve
more comprehensive protection of trading data.
