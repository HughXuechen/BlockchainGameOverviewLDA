Abstract— Currently, blockchain technology has been widely
used due to its support of transaction trust and security in next
generation society. Using Internet of Things (IoT) to mine makes
blockchain more ubiquitous and decentralized, which has become
a main development trend of blockchain. However, the limited
resources of existing IoT cannot satisfy the high requirements of
on-demand energy consumption in the mining process through
a decentralized way. To address this, we propose a decentralized
on-demand energy supply approach based on microgrids to
provide decentralized on-demand energy for mining in IoT
devices. First, energy supply architecture is proposed to satisfy
different energy demands of miners in response to different
consensus protocols. Then, we formulate the energy allocation
as a Stackelberg game and adapt backward induction to achieve
an optimal profit strategy for both microgrids and miners in
IoT. The simulation results show the fairness and incentive of
the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
AS a new form of distributed peer-to-peer encryption
storage application, blockchain [1] is considered as a
subversive innovation of computing models causing global
new technological innovations and industrial changes [2].
Satoshi Nakamoto proposed blockchain in the groundbreak-
ing paper “Bitcoin, a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”
published in 2008 [3]. Blockchain is a distributed ledger main-
tained by network-wide nodes [4]. Due to its ability to solve
transaction trust and security, blockchain can be used to record
transactions, data, medical records, and identity management,
i.e., It has been widely used in the logistics industry, smart

healthcare, smart home, real estate, and insurance industry
fields [5]. The consensus mechanism of the blockchain enables
mutual trust between nodes. For example, the consensus
mechanism most commonly used in blockchains is Proof-of-
work (PoW) [6], which has become the mainstream approach
in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum [7]. With
high security, PoW consumes lots of power for computation.
Although many other consensus protocols have been proposed
to reduce PoW’s energy consumption, most of them are still
based on PoW’s hybrid consensus mechanism, which requires
the calculation of a puzzle and consumes the corresponding
energy.
With the development of Internet-of-Things(IoT) [8],
mobile transactions in next generation society have con-
tinued to grow globally in recent years [9]. Due to the
ability to solve transaction trust, blockchain has become a
new approach to ensure security [10]. Blockchain in IoT
increases the scalability of blockchain in decentralized wire-
less networks [11]. While the computational performance of
mobile devices improves, the applicability of blockchain tech-
nology for smart IoT applications, such as smart homes and
smart factories, for example, has become the trend of the
blockchain research. As a new research topic of blockchain,
there have been many mobile blockchain-related practical
implementations. FiiiLab proposed the first mobile blockchain
token FiiiCoin powered by its own consensus mechanism
delegate proof of capacity (DPoC) in 2018. Supported by the
mobile payment POS terminal FiiiPOS, FiiiCoin can be mined
by IoT devices such as mobile phones [12]. IFMChain is the
third generation of mobile public chain product proposed by
Instinct Company, which is the first mobile blockchain that
supports access to mobile devices [13]. Besides, there have
been some mobile blockchain APP projects. For instance,
Phoneum is a mobile-only cryptocurrency, which enables all
mobile users to participate in the economy based on the
blockchain [14]. Recently, Bitmain also announced that they
would launch a new mobile mining pool ANTBOX.
However, the computation and power consumption of IoT
devices are important challenges restricting the application of
blockchain. At present, some studies have introduced mobile
edge computing (MEC) for challenging computational tasks.
MEC migrates storage and computing processes from the
cloud to the edge of the network [15]. Computing and data
storage can be distributed to the edge near IoT terminals,

sensors, and users, which eases the computational require-
ments while optimizing the network service architecture [16].
However, the energy consumption challenge of blockchain in
IoT still exists.
With the development of blockchain, the consumption of
electricity is currently increasing. For example, it is estimated
that the global electricity consumption of Bitcoin is increasing
by about 1–32 TWh per year, while 32 TWh is equivalent to
the annual electricity consumption of Denmark. New studies
are starting to use proof of stake (PoS) [17] and proof of
activity (PoA) [18], which are more energy efficient and can
be a viable alternative to the extended blockchain.
Most of the energy currently used for mining comes from
centralized environment-unfriendly fossil fuels [19]. In order
to satisfy the distributed needs of mining and reduce the
impact on the environment, decentralized renewable energy
is also needed as a means of powering the mobile blockchain.
The mobile blockchain has a strong geographical distribution
while having a large demand for energy. Here, the microgrids
can realize the large-scale application of distributed renewable
power and achieve a stable supply of multiple energy sources.
Microgrids have the potential to realize a distributed effi-
cient power supply for IoT-based blockchain using renewable
energy.
In response to these aspects, we propose a decentralized
on-demand energy supply approach based on microgrids to
provide decentralized on-demand energy for mining in IoT
devices. The microgrids can realize the unified deployment and
allocation of distributed renewable energy to miners in IoT.
On the one hand, users (miners) receive rewards through min-
ing a new block and purchase energy from the microgrids. The
microgrids perform real-time scheduling and decision-making
according to the user’s energy consumption to ensure that
the system benefits and maximizes smooth operation. The
contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
1) We propose a decentralized on-demand energy supply
approach based on microgrids to provide decentralized
on-demand energy for mining in IoT devices. The energy
supply includes an interaction process and a game
process. The microgrids perform real-time scheduling
and decision-making according to the miner’s energy
consumption to ensure that the system benefits and max-
imizes smooth operation. The energy supply architecture
satisfies different energy demands of miners in response
to different consensus protocols. To the best of our
knowledge, the problem of powering blockchain devices
in mobile IoT environments has barely been studied in
previous studies.
2) We model the energy allocation as a Stackelberg game
between microgrids and miners in IoT. We apply back-
ward induction to achieve optimal profit strategy for both
of them. The simulation results show the fairness and
incentive of the proposed approach.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II dis-
cusses the related works. Section III discusses the architectural
principles of the system and describes the system architecture
of the energy supply for blockchain in IoT based on the
microgrids. Section IV introduces the energy allocation using
a Stackelberg game model. We evaluate the performance of
our proposed strategy in Section V. Eventually, we draw some
conclusions in Section VI. Besides, we propose the direction
of work that can be studied in the future.
II. RELATED WORKS
There have been many studies that concentrate on address-
ing the high-energy consuming challenge caused by PoW [20].
Some researchers have modified the PoW algorithm or com-
bined it with PoS. UnitedBitcoin [21] implements a hybrid
consensus protocol that is split between PoW and PoS. In Unit-
edBitcoin, on average, 50% blocks will be mined by PoS,
and 50% blocks will be mined by PoW. PPCoin [22], which
was officially released by Sunny King on August 19, 2012,
is a combination of two types of proof. PoW-based mining is
used in the early stage to ensure fairness. The PoS protocol is
adopted in the later stage to ensure network security. PoA also
combines PoS with PoW [18]. The node must have a known
and authenticated identity, and the node obtains the right to
secure the network by placing this identity and, finally, gets the
block reward. Research in [23] proposes a blockchain-based
architecture to provide secure data record in the cloud environ-
ment that uses the PoS protocol. Xue et al. [24] propose proof
of contribution (PoC), which reduces electricity consumption
by effectively rewarding the daily labor contributions of all
community miners. Ethereum released the Casper implemen-
tation specification in April 2018 [25], which is a hybrid
consensus protocol as a transition from PoW to POS.
With the development of IoT [26], mobile blockchain
becomes a new research topic in the field [27].
Luong et al. [28] consider computing off-loading in mobile
blockchain by two off-loading approaches, off-loaded to
the nearby MEC nodes or mobile users. Research in [29]
considers the same problem by a social welfare maximization
problem. They discuss the pricing problem by modeling
an auction-based market model, which includes miners,
blockchain owner, and MEC providers. Li et al. [30]
propose a computing resource management approach of
mobile blockchain by formulating a Stackelberg game to
guarantee the benefit of miners and edge service provider.
Liu et al. [31] consider mobile video streaming scenario
based on MEC-enabled mobile blockchain. These studies
all concentrate on the computing resource management of
blockchain in IoT but ignore the energy consumption of
mobile blockchain [32].
Blockchain could be a secure transaction guarantee of the
microgrids. Based on the blockchain, smart contracts that
control energy consumption and power generation have the
potential to support all types of existing energy and new
energy markets [33]. Di Silvestre et al. [34] consider some
technical approach to solve the transaction of energy in
microgrids using the blockchain. They implement blockchain
to establish a trust system between consumers. The pro-
posal in [35] tries to achieve proportional-fairness control of
distributed energy in microgrids by a smart contract based
on the blockchain. Liu et al. [36] propose data coins and
energy coins for blockchain to realize multiple transactions
in the electronic vehicular environment. The blockchain is

implemented to store smart contracts that achieve proportional
fairness. However, all these studies about blockchain and
microgrids concentrate on how to use blockchain to ensure
secure transactions in the microgrids but no research proposes
how to use microgrids to provide energy for blockchain.
In this paper, we propose a decentralized on-demand energy
supply approach based on the microgrids to provide decen-
tralized on-demand energy for mining in IoT devices. The
strengths of this system contain these two aspects: first, our
proposal provides efficient decentralized environment-friendly
energy for IoT-blockchain. Second, our proposal formulates
the game between miners in IoT and the microgrids. We realize
the equilibrium of the game and maximize the benefits.
III. PROPOSAL OF SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
We propose the new system architecture in this section,
as shown in Fig. 1. First, we introduce the architectural
principles of energy supply architecture for blockchain in IoT
based on the microgrids. We propose our system according
to these principles. In Section III-B, we give an overview of
our architecture. Then, we provide the details of the com-
ponents of these two subsystems: microgrids and blockchain
in IoT.
A. Architectural Principles
1) Stochasticity: Both microgrids and IoT-blockchain
behave randomly. Distributed energy as the unstable energy
supply is related to regional environments, such as wind power,
hydropower, and solar power. On the other hand, the mobility
of IoT devices leads to load instability. Blockchain miners
using IoT devices can make energy requests to different
microgrids. This causes the load request in the system to be
unstable. The supply and the load instability require dynamic
feedback and real-time deployment of the system.
2) Multi-Energy Supply and Storage: IoT-blockchain
requires stable and continuous energy to support computing.
Due to the instability of distributed energy, it is necessary
for the system to design a hybrid energy source to ensure
stable and continuous power to support mining for blockchain.
Microgrids need to integrate distributed energy from different
sources. Besides, the subsystem requires traditional fossil
energy generation as an aid or alternate. Renewable energy
is mixed with non-renewable energy to provide energy to
the system. Due to load instability, excess energy needs to
be stored in the battery. Due to the extra cost of storing
energy, microgrids may require a higher price to get the same
amount of resources. Energy, communication costs, and tokens
in blockchain systems may serve as a means of closed-loop
circulation.
3) Multi Processing Modes and Consensus Protocols:
Considering the computing power of the devices and the
environment in which they are located, for IoT-blockchain
miners, there exist two modes of processing. In mode 1, miners
use IoT devices to perform computing tasks locally when the
following conditions hold: 1) mining IoT equipment in smart
homes can be easily recharged and 2) there are no mobile edge
service providers available near the IoT-blockchain devices.
On the other hand, in mode 2, miners off-load the com-
puting tasks to nearby MEC providers. The MEC providers
accept a range of mobile IoT devices and provide computing
power to solve mathematical calculations for miners. The
blockchain relies on consensus protocols to build a trust
network. Most of the consensus protocols, now, proposed are
based on PoW’s hybrid protocols, which have basic demands
for power. Different consensus protocols have different energy
demands.
4) Game Between Service Provider and Multi-Miners With
Limited Energy: When energy is limited, there is a competi-
tion between multiple miners who purchase energy from the
microgrids. Multiple users will offer different prices to the
microgrids to purchase energy. The benefit of the miners is
related to the rewards for mining and the cost of purchasing
energy. A game is formulated between multiple users in the
restricted environment. The goal of the game is to maximize
the income of everyone. In this case, the system should
consider multiple factors to balance this game. The benefits of
the microgrids are determined by the cost and the price paid by
the miners. The cost of the microgrids includes transmission
costs, repair costs, and power facility protection fees, which
consists of three main components: power generation costs,
power supply costs, and electricity sales costs. There are
cooperation and interest interaction between the microgrids
and the miners. The user’s goal is to maximize the profit from
mining. From the perspective of energy providers, they focus
on how to determine energy distribution to maximize their own
interests. The system should obtain a balance among members
of different roles.

B. Microgrids-Based Energy Supply
In this section, we first propose an overview of our system
architecture. Then, we introduce the details of each part of the
architecture.
We propose a decentralized on-demand energy supply
approach based on the microgrids, as shown in Fig. 2. The
goal of this system is to achieve decentralized management
of distributed renewable energy through microgrids in order
to provide a stable and efficient environment-friendly energy
supply for blockchain applications on geographically dis-
tributed IoT devices. The microgrids integrate, store, and
manage geographically concentrated distributed energy, pro-
viding environment-friendly energy for mining in IoT devices.
Blockchain applications deployed in IoT devices compete
by mining and probabilistically acquire rewards. The miners
selectively adjust the demand for energy to the microgrids.
There are two subsystems in our proposed architecture.
The goal of the microgrids is to dynamically provide a stable
output of energy. There have been many studies on microgrid
adaptive dynamic energy management systems. We apply a
smart microgrid energy management system using adaptive
dynamic programming (ADP) [37]. Through such an energy
management strategy, we can improve the reliability and
stability of the system, reduce the cost of power generation,
and extend the life of the system. This system includes two
networks: the critic network and the action network. The action
network (energy control module) achieves the approximate
optimal strategy of microgrids. The critical network provides
dynamic performance feedback to the action network in order
to achieve the target state, which is one of the inputs of the
action network. Other inputs of the action network include
three parts: energy status, microgrids status, and load demand
status. Load demand status refers to the current demand of the
load. Energy status consists of four parts. The main source
of energy is distributed energy, which means that renewable
energy includes hydropower, wind power, and solar power,
i.e., besides, non-renewable energy (fossil energy) is needed
as an alternative energy source. In addition, the system also
requires an energy storage device such as a battery. Users
in IoT, such as smart homes, can sell excess power from
self-generation to the microgrids, which is another source of
energy of microgrids. From the above-mentioned considera-
tions, the energy source of the microgrids has four main parts:
distributed generation (renewable energy), energy storage,
grids energy (non-renewable energy), and energy purchased
from users. The details of these components are presented in
the following part.
1) Distributed Generation (Renewable Energy): Distributed
energy sources include a mix of multiple renewable
energy sources. Energy status, such as hydropower, wind
power, and solar power, is one of the inputs to smart
microgrids scheduling.
2) Energy Storage: In order to ensure a stable output of the
microgrids, we need to set up energy storage devices.
Due to the instability of distributed renewable energy
and IoT-blockchain miners, the energy storage device
acts as a battery to replenish and assist the microgrids.
The battery stores excess power when the distributed
energy supply is sufficient or when the number of
miners in the area is small. In order to facilitate the
scheduling of battery energy, the energy storage state
is also an input to the intelligent microgrids energy
dynamic scheduling strategy. In order to extend the
battery life, the system minimizes that the number of
times the battery is charged/discharged and extends the
single charge and discharge time.
3) Grids Energy (Non-Renewable Energy): In order to pre-
vent power outages and insufficient resources, the sys-
tem needs fossil energy as an energy aid. To maximize
the use of distributed energy and the minimal use of
fossil energy, the energy status of grid energy is used as
an input to the microgrids dynamic energy management
strategy.
4) Energy Purchased From Users: Blockchain guarantees
point-to-point power trading in the microgrids. IoT users
such as smart homes may be able to generate electricity
to satisfy their power needs and sell excess power to
the microgrids. The microgrids purchase electricity at
an appropriate price and store it in the energy storage
devices as one of the sources of energy.
Inputs of the critic network include two parts: input status
and dispatch feedback. Input status consists of energy status,
microgrids status, and load demand status. Dispatch feedback

LI et al.: DECENTRALIZED ON-DEMAND ENERGY SUPPLY FOR BLOCKCHAIN IN IoT: A MICROGRIDS APPROACH 1399
of the system refers to the output energy of microgrids. The
critic network helps the action network to improve perfor-
mance and achieve optimal dynamic planning strategies. The
energy control module controls and adjusts the energy in
the microgrids dynamically based on the input and feedback
signals from the critic network.
In the mining management module, there exist two
processes. In the interactive process, miners who need energy
send energy requests to the surrounding microgrids. The
microgrids make decisions based on the system energy status
and the load status and give feedback to the miners. Then,
in the game process, the energy and payment interactions
between the miners in IoT and the microgrids are realized.
The existing consensus protocols have different energy
requirements, and we satisfy the energy demand of different
consensus protocols. We maximize the use of energy through
the benefit game among different miners. For instance, under
the hybrid consensus protocol of PoS and PoW, each miner
has a certain probability to be selected as the miner of the
next excavation block. When a miner who needs energy sends
a request to the microgrids, the mining management module
would make decisions whether it allows the system to provide
energy for the miner according to the system energy status and
load demand. Then, the mining management module would
send feedback to the miner. Miners who are permitted to be
powered by the microgrids have different energy demands.
Therefore, each miner has a different energy demand for the
microgrids. Each member will propose an energy unit price
according to different needs. Members earn different profits
due to different incomes and expenses. The system, therefore,
needs to provide a strategy to achieve energy distribution in
a profitable situation. In Section IV, we propose the game
between the members in IoT and the energy provider.
In order to implement a dynamic energy management strat-
egy, the microgrids require the load demand for IoT devices
and dispatch profiles as complementary inputs to the system.
On the other hand, the microgrids need to provide energy
configuration components to help the system to achieve energy
allocation for members. The purpose of the collaboration
between two subsystems is to maximize the benefits of the
system-wide role while providing a stable and reliable energy
input for mobile blockchain miners.
IV. MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Game Model
In our game model, we consider mobile blockchain in IoT
devices using PoW consensus, which is supported by the
microgrids with renewable energy. There are three entities in
the system: blockchain miners, MEC providers, and micro-
grids. Mobile blockchain miners in IoT devices put the trans-
action records into a block and calculate a puzzle to obtain the
right of a new block. Miners could earn tokens by producing
new blocks. The power consumed by miners per unit time is
related to the proportion of the calculated power. Limited to the
computing capacity, miners off-load the computation task to
nearby MEC providers that are located geographically. MEC
providers calculate the hash value for miners. The process

of computing has a large demand for energy. To meet the
requirement, miners purchase energy from the microgrids for
MEC providers. The price of electricity purchased is proposed
by microgrids. Besides, microgrids operation requires a lot of
costs, including power generation costs and maintenance costs,
i.e., we finally consider the behavior of two entities in the
system model: miners and microgrids. In our model, miners
include IoT-device users and MEC. MEC that off-loaded
computing tasks can be regarded as a miner who owns higher
computing capacity. Meanwhile, MEC has a demand for
energy powered by the microgrids. Therefore, the model in
this paper only considers two players—miners and microgrids.
B. Problem Formulation
In the system model, the mobile blockchain miners using
IoT devices to record transactions and achieve the mining
process are represented as a set of nodes B, which are denoted
as N = {1, 2, · · · , n}. The profit of miners is determined by
two factors: 1) reward, which is given by distributing the block
producing process, and 2) payment, which is the price paid
to the microgrids for the electricity needed for mining. The
amount of electricity required by each user is different, and
the price of electricity proposed by the microgrids is differ-
ent. Therefore, there is a non-cooperative game between the
users’ benefits, and the user dynamically adjusts the requested
electricity to maximize the self-revenue. For the microgrid,
it focuses on the comprehensive pricing strategies of different
users to maximize benefits. To solve the problem, we con-
sider the interaction between the microgrid and the mobile
IoT-blockchain miners as a Stackelberg game. The microgrid
could be considered as a leader in the game who proposes
a non-uniform pricing strategy for different miners. Miners
could be considered as followers who decide their demand
for electricity according to the price. Therefore, we consider
our game model as G = {SB
Bi∈B, SM ; U B
Bi∈B, UM }, which is
described in the following.
1) SB
Bi∈B is the strategy space of miners B, which is
defined as the energy demand on miners. Let P =
{p1, p2, . . . pn, i ∈ N} denote the energy that each
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:16:08 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
1400 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2019
miner would purchase from the microgrids. We have
SB
Bi∈B = {pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax}. SM is
the strategy of microgrids, which is the proposed
price to each miner. The strategy space is defined as
SM = {yi , i ∈ N, 0 ≤ yi ≤ ymax}.
2) U B
Bi∈B is the utility function of miners B, which is
determined by a reward of producing a new block and
energy cost. UM is the utility function of microgrids,
which is determined by electricity fee and operating cost.
The objective function of miner’s sub-game can be
described as follows:
max
pi
UBi (pi )
s.t .p ∈ [pmin, pmax]. (1)
We represent y∗ = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) and p∗ =
(p1, p2, . . . , pn). Then, the objective function of microgrid’s
sub-game can be described as follows:
max
y∗ UM (y∗, p∗)
s.t .y ∈ [0, ymax]. (2)
These two sub-games consist of the Stackelberg game.
C. Utility Function Formulation
In the model, we consider that the device is installed in
a CPU. The amount of electricity consumed by a device is
related to the frequency of the CPU, which refers to the CPU
clock cycle, which is the number of operations per second. The
energy consumption relationship is shown as follows [38]:
P =CV 2 f. (3)
Here, P represents energy consumption. C can be simply
regarded as a constant, which is determined by factors such
as the process. V is the voltage, while f defines the main
frequency of the CPU. Frequency is positively correlated
with computational power, which is denoted as w. In the
blockchain, the computation power refers to the hash fre-
quency, which is the number of times a hash can be calculated
per second. In our model, we assume that the frequency is
linearly related to the computational power as the following
equation presented [39]:
f = h × w. (4)
By substituting (4) into (3), we have the relationship
between the energy demand and computation power that is
P = Kw, where K = hCV 2.
The relative energy demand of miner i is denoted as η =
(pi/(
�
j∈N
p j )), which is linearly related to the relative demand
of computation power. The process of successfully mining
a new block follows the Poisson distribution. Therefore,
the probability of successfully appending a new block and
obtaining the tokens is determined by
Pr
i
= ηe−λzti (5)
where z is a constant determined by a delay factor. ti is the size
of blocks, which means the number of transactions included
in the new block.
The miners’ benefit consists of tokens and transaction fees
from mining. The current transaction fee represents less than
5% of the revenue. Thus, in the model, we only consider
tokens. Let T denote the tokens that a miner could win by
mining a new block successfully. We can define the utility
function of miners as follows:
UBi (pi) = T
pi�
j∈N
p j
e−λzti − yi pi . (6)
The profit of microgrids is determined by electricity fee and
operating cost. Costs can be classified into fixed costs, variable
costs, semi-fixed costs, and semi-variable costs depending on
their nature. Final costs can be classified into fixed costs a
and variable costs by. According to the production cost of
the classical production function, when the output exceeds a
certain relevant range, the unit cost of the cost function and
the unit variable cost nonlinearly change. Therefore, we can
assume a quadratic cost function for microgrids in our model.
a, b, and c can be seen as cost-related constants. Thus, we can
define the utility function of microgrids as the following
function:
UM =
�
i∈N
yi pi −
�
a(
�
pi )
2 + b
�
pi + c
�
. (7)
V. GAME EQUILIBRIUM OF MINERS AND MICROGRIDS
In Section IV, we form the Stackelberg game with two
sub-games. In this section, we analyze the Nash equilibrium
of the game. Under the premise of roughly predicting the
energy demand of miners, the microgrid provides electricity
price strategies for different users. The miners observe the
electricity price strategy to dynamically adjust their own needs
and maximize their own interests. We adopt the backward
induction approach to find the demand equilibrium of the
miners’ sub-game and, thus, get the Nash equilibrium of the

A. Miner’s Energy Demand Sub-Game
Definition 1: In the game G = {SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B}, SB
Bi∈B =
{pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax} is the strategy space of
miners B, which is defined as the energy demand of miners.
The energy demand set of miners p∗ = (p1, p2, · · · , pn)
is the Nash equilibrium of the game if the strategy SBi
of miner i is the best response to the strategy of other
miners (SB1, · · · , SBi−1 , SBi+1 , · · · SBn ), which means that for
every miner i ∈ N , pi ∈ [pmin, pmax], Ui (pi , P−i , y∗) ≥
Ui (pi j , P−i , y∗), where P− j is the demand strategy of miners
excluding pi .
Theorem 1: A Nash equilibrium exists in G =
{SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B}.
Proof: pi is continuous in [pmin, pmax]. Then, we find the
first derivative and the second derivative for the utility function
with respect to pi as the following:

Thus, Ui (pi , P−i , y∗) is a strictly concave function with
respect to pi . A Nash equilibrium exists in the sub-game G =
{SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B}, SB
Bi∈B = {pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax}. The
proof is completed. Therefore, for any miner i ∈ N , the model
can find the best profit strategy, and the best strategy is unique
when pi ∈ [pmin, pmax].
Theorem 2: The Nash equilibrium in G = {SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B},
SB
Bi∈B = {pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax} is unique.
By solving ((∂ui 0/(∂ pi)) = ((T e−λzti

When the following condition holds:

If T e−λzti < yi
�
i �= j
p j , we assume that the demand of miner
i is zero, which means that the microgrid would not offer
energy for miner i . If pi ≤ pmin, we set that the demand of
miner i is the same as pmin, while pi ≥ pmax,we set that the
demand of miner i is the same as pmax.
According to (8), after mathematical deduction, we have the
following expression:�

Thus, we can obtain the Nash equilibrium of miner’s
sub-game G = {SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B}, SB
Bi∈B = {pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤
pi ≤ pmax}.According to (13), we can obtain a set of dynamic
demand strategies of miners. Then, in Section V-B, we would
analyze the sub-game of the microgrids, which concentrates
on the maximization of the profit of microgrids according to
the demand strategies of miners.
B. Microgrid’s Sub-Game
By analyzing the Nash equilibrium of miner’s sub-game
G = {SB
Bi∈B; U B
Bi∈B}, SB
Bi∈B = {pi , i ∈ N, pmin ≤ pi ≤
pmax}, the microgrid provides dynamic electricity price strate-
gies for different users to maximize its profit.
Theorem 3: In the game G = {SB
Bi∈B, SM ; U B
Bi∈B, UM },
SM is the strategy of microgrids, which is the proposed
price to each miner. The strategy space is defined as
SM = {yi , i ∈ N, 0 ≤ yi ≤ ymax}. There exists a unique
Stackelberg equilibrium in the Stackelberg game. The pricing
strategy set of microgrid y∗ = (y1, y2, · · · , yn) could achieve
the profit maximization of microgrid and pi is given by (13)
when the following condition holds:

By substituting the optimal strategy of miners into microgrid’s
game, the optimal pricing strategy set of microgrid y∗ =
(y1, y2, · · · , yn) could achieve the profit maximization of
the microgrid. The model could achieve the Nash equilibrium
and the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game.
C. Gradient-Based Iterative Algorithm of the Game
According to the above-mentioned analysis, we use the
gradient-based iterative algorithm in order to find the Nash
equilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game.
We adopt Algorithm 1 to achieve the optimal strategy of
miners and microgrid provider.

VI. SIMULATION
In this simulation, we compare the performance of our
proposed Stackelberg model with several sets of experimental
data and analyze the underlying causes. Limited to the low
computing capacity and power consumption of IoT devices,
it is reasonable for IoT-blockchain miners to join a mining
pool. IoT miners devote their computing power to the mining
pools. According to the computing capacity and the number of
IoT-blockchain miners, the mining capacity of mining pools is

different. In our simulation, we assume that each miner joins
a mining pool.
Considering the widespread deployment of IoT devices,
the number of IoT miners in a mining pool is much bigger
than a traditional mining pool. We assume that one microgrid
provides energy for 200–800 IoT miners in different mining
pools. The number and the status of IoT devices result in
different energy demands for each mining pool. In a mining
pool, the strategy of the mining pool to distribute the reward
and the strategy of the miner to choose a mining pool is
another research, which has been widely studied in many
works. Therefore, in this simulation, we only focus on the
energy allocation of microgrids. Considering the different
demand of mining pools, we set that the range of power
demand is pmax = 150. Besides, we set that the range of
electricity price is ymin = 0 and ymax = 80. The size of the
block obeys a normal distribution μ = 50 and σ 2 = 5. Other
model parameters are set as follows: z =5×10−2, T =1×104,
a = 0.01, b = 3, and c = −1.
First, we consider the impact of the number of miners to
the profit of microgrids and the energy demand of miners,
as shown in Fig. 4. We can find that when the number of
miners participating increases, both the miner’s energy demand
and the benefit of the microgrids increase. The reason is
that when the miners involved increase, there is an incentive
for miners, and thus, there is more competition between
miners, which leads to more energy demand. Greater energy
demand brings more benefits to microgrids. As the size of
the block increases, the probability of successfully mining the

energy demand versus the single reward tokens.
block decreases, and therefore, the profits of microgrids are
correspondingly reduced.
Then, from Fig. 5, we observe that with the increase of
single reward token, there is an increase in miners’ energy
demand and microgrids’ benefits. As the reward tokens earned
by the miners increased, this became an incentive for the
entire game, which increases the miners’ energy requirements.
As a result, the benefits of microgrids have also increased.
Besides, it is shown in Fig. 5 that miners’ energy demand
and microgrids’ benefit decrease when the propagation delay
of blockchain increases. When the propagation delay of the
blockchain becomes higher, the possibility of successfully
mining a new block is reduced. This reduces the enthusi-
asm of the miners, which leads to a reduction in the min-
ers’ energy request. Finally, the benefits of microgrids also
declined.
Fig. 6 presents the relationship between the number of
miners and the price. When the unit price of energy proposed
by the microgrids increases, the energy demand of miners
decreases. In contrast, the profits of microgrids increase due
to higher unit prices. In addition, with the increase in the
number of miners, the profit growth rate of the microgrids
has gradually declined. As the number of miners increases,
competition among miners becomes more intense. In this case,
the opportunity for miners to successfully mine a new block
and get rewards becomes smaller. As a result, the energy
demands of miners become smaller. Therefore, the profits of
microgrids are also dropped.

Fig. 6. (a) Benefit of microgrids versus the price of energy. (b) Miners’
energy demand versus the price of energy.
Fig. 7. Energy demand of different mining pools versus the single reward
tokens.
Besides, considering the difference between mining pools,
we explore a case study of three different mining pools. We set
mining pool 1 of 80 miners with the upper limit of price
ymax = 90, mining pool 2 of 100 miners with the upper limit
of price ymax = 80, and mining pool 3 of 120 miners with
the upper limit of price ymax = 70. In our simulation, mining
pool 3 has the biggest scale of miners with the lowest price
of energy provided by a microgrid. From Fig. 7, we observe
the demand of different mining pools. With a larger scale of a
mining pool, the mining tasks of the mining pool get bigger,
which causes a higher demand for energy. Due to the policy
and restricts of price, the performance of different mining
pools shows an incentive of miners. When the upper limit of
price decreases, there is an incentive for mining pools, which
causes bigger demands.
In addition, we also simulate the relationship between
the power generation cost of the microgrids and the energy
demand of miners. Since the cost of microgrids is a quadratic
cost function, the change of cost is not determined by a single
variable. We suspect that the profit of the microgrids is related
to both these three values of a, b, and c. We have not given
specific changes in this paper.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized on-demand
energy supply architecture for miners in IoT, using micro-
grids to provide renewable energy for mining in IoT devices.
The energy management framework satisfies different energy
demands in response to different consensus protocols. Then,
we model the game between the microgrids and the miners as
a Stackelberg model. We apply backward induction to achieve
an optimal profit strategy for both of them. The simulation
results show that our strategy supports the fairness of the
game between different roles and show a strong incentive
to encourage collaboration among microgrids and miners in
IoT. In future studies, we would consider energy allocation
among different consensus protocols. We will also consider
the energy allocation between multi-microgrids suppliers and
multi-miners. Besides, the security issues of our proposal
should be considered. The combination of energy blockchain
and microgrids energy supply is also our research direction in
the future.
