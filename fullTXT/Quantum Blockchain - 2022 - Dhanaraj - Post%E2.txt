Abstract
The mass migration of rural citizens toward urban areas in search of better 
employment opportunities, better education erupts a new threat for urban citi-
zens. The increased population due to migration contributes in increasing traffic 
jams, green house gas emissions, waste disposal. To provide better day-to-day 
services to citizens, common issues such as fair broadband distribution and con-
nectivity, digital and knowledge inclusion needs to be respected with possible 
integration and smooth management of various social, physical, and business 
infrastructure. Furthermore, the rapid development of digital society opens up 
vast of opportunities in smart cities thus implementing goals of education and 
healthcare for all, green society, green city. However, the continued adoption 
of new technologies such as internet of things (IoT) and cloud technologies 
for various applications in smart cities suffers from issues such as high latency, 
bandwidth bottlenecks, scalability, security, and privacy. The smart cities are 
usually autonomous in nature, which relies on distributed infrastructure and 
features applications such as intelligent information processing, heterogeneous 
network infrastructure, ubiquitous sensing, and intelligent control systems 
implemented in areas such as public safety, healthcare, and diagnosis. Besides, 
the blockchain-enabled applications such as data platform for sharing valu-
able data between non-trusted organizations, blockchain-based financial sys-
tems, online games, online education system, and identity management system 
improve reliability and democratization of cities by eliminating centralization. 
However, majority of applications depends on either digital signature or public 
key cryptography-based schemes  which, in turn, depend on the premise that

computation of private key from public key is computationally hard. But with 
advent of quantum computer, the time complexity of all hard problems such 
as discrete log problem and integer factorization has reduced from millions of 
years to few seconds, thus endangering traditional cryptographic mechanism, 
which includes public key, secret key, and digital signature–based protocols 
used in blockchain technology–based services in smart cities. The quantum 
computing which uses law of physics for communication does not depend on 
mathematically hard problems. In addition, convergence of quantum computing 
with blockchain technology provides us with amicable solutions for smart cities. 
This chapter discusses overview of quantum computing, key characteristics, and 
quantum key distribution and presents an architecture enabling post- quantum 
blockchain–based applications within smart cities. In addition, the need of 
various services relying on quantum blockchain in smart cities is presented. 
Moreover, to enable conceptual architecture for post-quantum blockchain–
enabled services in smart cities, smart contracts are designed for implementing 
transportation application.

11.1 Introduction
Distributed ledger has become an alternative to cloud computing. The 
flexibility provided by distributed ledger to store database in local prox-
imity and allowing modification of records only after achieving mutual 
consensus among peers makes this technology extremely popular in mar-
ket. In addition, each peer within network possesses synchronized copy 
of records. Although various work related to smart city application utiliz-
ing blockchain is present [1–4], huge scope of improvement in different 
verticals of society within any smart city still exists. Initially, with aim 
to store financial transaction history, distributed ledger is proposed in 
cryptocurrency, namely, Bitcoin. However, the secure implementation of 
blockchain-based application within any smart city demands combina-
tion of consensus and cryptographic techniques. Few popular consensus 
mechanisms which are widely used in blockchain-based applications are 
practical Byzantine fault tolerance [5], delegated proof of stake [6], proof 
of work [7], and proof of stake (PoS) [8], while hash-based and public key 
 cryptography-based techniques are used to achieve security. However, 
with availability of quantum computer, all cryptographic mechanism 
using public key techniques becomes vulnerable. In addition, quantum

computer capabilities to break mathematically hard problems such as 
integer factorization have only threatened the existing infrastructure. 
Quantum computer can easily attack on consensus and cryptographic 
mechanism in blockchain-based applications. Also, quantum computer 
has ability to phenomenally reduce complexity of SHA256 hash function 
used in Bitcoin for mutual consensus [9]. In addition, ECDSA scheme 
used in Bitcoin has become vulnerable due to advent of quantum com-
puter. The centralized structure of smart city has only fabricated unau-
thorized data manipulation by powerful groups. Sometimes, with focus 
to fulfill their malicious agendas, huge accumulation of private data of 
individuals, transfer of illegitimate message in form of fake news, etc., 
are performed, thus endangering basic rights of privacy of individuals. 
Besides, illegitimate sell of retrieve data from centralized application has 
only boosting dark markets, thereby generating chances of increased 
crime. Although, decentralized mechanism can alone solve the men-
tioned issue but coordinated targeting by few industries can be per-
formed with the private information achieved through quantum attacks. 
A classic example could be need of transportation pattern, vehicle-re-
lated information of individuals by few manufacturing companies to sell 
their specific products.
11.1.1 Motivation and Contribution
Because of the ever increasing population within smart cities, tremendous 
challenges have been emerged, thus requires quick redressal. One such 
problem is validation of driver records while driving vehicles to accom-
plish any journey within smart cities. In addition, government used to 
charge toll fees, etc., from drivers through toll collection point installed 
around particular road. Besides, penalties are also charged to vehicle’s 
driver for reckless driving, wrong lane driving, breaking traffic rules, and 
safety measures. The non-possession of valid driving license, pollution cer-
tificate, etc., can lead to generation of penalty for individual vehicle. Also, 
because of multiple toll points, many junction and crossroads within smart 
cities, handling of vehicle records and managing penalty related records are 
tiresome. In addition, transfer of records through different organization is 
complex. Besides, there does not exist any standard benchmark approach 
which provides solution to such issue. However, a decentralized network, 
namely, blockchain network could become fruitful in envisioning solu-
tion. In literature, the smart road pricing (SRP) system using blockchain

is subsequently introduced guaranteeing enhanced security as data stored 
in blockchain network is protected from tampering but arrival of quan-
tum computer will also make standard encryption technique vulnerable. 
Therefore, we proposed a quantum blockchain–enabled SRP system to 
be used within smart cities. The specific contribution of this chapter is as 
follows:
• In addition to discussion on the need of post-quantum 
blockchain–enabled services within any smart city, we have 
proposed an architecture for post-quantum blockchain–
enabled application for transportation application within 
any smart city.
• We have used distributed ledger to build blockchain network 
and stored records of each registered vehicle such as owner 
details, vehicle number, and license detail of driver in the 
blockchain network with aim to protect the transportation 
application from single point of failure within smart cities. 
The proposed work incorporates different roles, namely, vehi-
cle, toll point, district transport agency, and network admin. 
All roles require permission for accessing data already stored 
in blockchain network. Besides, different smart contract has 
been designed to enable the whole SRP system (transporta-
tion application) within smart cities. The proposed system 
incorporates quantum blind signature within smart contract 
to enable automation of SRP system achieving unconditional 
communication security within smart cities.
The organization of rest of the chapter includes preliminaries section 
where quantum computing and blockchain are described. Various recent 
literature utilizing quantum techniques in different application areas such 
as healthcare and cloud computing have been explored in Section 11.3. 
Section 11.4 describes background details of proposed work detailing 
design goals. Later, the proposed SRP system with detailed system archi-
tecture and vehicle records utilizing BB84 protocol along with designed 
smart contracts are described in Section 11.5. Finally, Section 11.6 con-
cludes the work.

11.2 Preliminaries
This section gives insights about building blocks of proposed protocol, i.e., 
quantum computing, quantum key distribution (QKD), and blockchain. 
Besides, the need for amalgamation of quantum computing and block-
chain is presented.
11.2.1 Quantum Computing
This section includes overview on quantum computing in addition to 
specifying details of key characteristic as well as quantum platform and 
software development kit (SDK) available in market where quantum 
algorithm can be simulated or executed on real quantum computer. 
The quantum computer will be made up of quantum chips contrary to 
 silicon-based chips installed in classical computers. Moreover, the poten-
tial of quantum computer to break mathematically hard problems such as 
integer factorization (IF) problem and discrete log (DL) problem made it 
extremely popular, meanwhile, endangering all existing protocols whose 
security depends on mathematically hard problems. In addition, expo-
nential increase of curiosity by major multi-national companies (MNCs) 
in building quantum computer that has not only created the hype rather 
availability of quantum computer in market is assured. Recently, IBM’s 
roadmap predicts the arrival of 1,000 qubit quantum computer within 
few years. The announcement by several scientist indicates intense plan-
ning for cryptographic agility term used to upgrade existing protocols 
before they become vulnerable or outdated. In addition, quantum com-
puting is also expected to turn around computationally difficult task such 
as training of neural network, which are known to be building blocks of 
several machine learning algorithm. The need of optimization for various 
deep learning algorithms only fosters the need of availability of quantum 
processing units (QPUs) to researchers and industry through cloud. It is 
expected that, similar to graphic processing units (GPUs), QPUs will be 
available to any individual for deploying their algorithm very soon. Now, 
what follows are basics of quantum system.

11.2.1.1 Basics of Quantum System
Quantum system depends heavily on quantum mechanics which uses 
complex number contrary to real numbers. In addition, contrary to bit, 
which is described with set of states, i.e., either 0 or 1, quantum bits are 
used by quantum system which could be narrated through 2D system 
[c0, c1]
T where
 |c0
2| + |c1
2| = 1. (11.1)
where 2
0c  and 2
1c  signify the probabilities obtained after measuring the 
qubits in state |0 > and state |1 >. A real world implementation of quantum 
bit in day-to-day life will make switch of a bulb in ON and OFF state at the 
same time. In fact, the presence of electron in two different orbits around 
nucleus and existence of photon in any one out of two polarized states 
established the implementation of quantum bits. Therefore, existence of 
quantum indeterminancy and superposition effects within all system lies 
in universe.
11.2.1.2 Architecture of Quantum System
The quantum system possess reversibility property thereby action per-
formed on quantum system must allowed to be reversed. The assurance of 
reversibility property within architecture of quantum system brought up 
the need of reversible gates. Reversible gates constitute all operations which 
are represented by unitary matrices and are not measurement. Example of 
reversible gate includes identity gate, NOT gate, CNOT gate, Toffoli gate, 
and Fredkin gate. The widely used AND gate in classical computing is not 
reversible as with output of |0 > from AND gate in hand, no one can deter-
mine whether input was |00 >, |01 >, or |10 > contrary to NOT gate and 
identity gates which are reversible.
 NOT ∗ NOT = I2 (11.2)
 In ∗ In = In (11.3)
Therefore, an operator which acts on qubits and represented by uni-
tary matrices is known as quantum gates. In addition, it may be noted that 
Toffoli and Fredkin gates are not only reversible but also is universal and 
unitary. However, all mentioned quantum gates are limited by no- cloning

theorem for imitating fanout operation but transportation of quantum 
states is still feasible between two systems.
11.2.1.3 Key Characteristics of Quantum Computing
The key characteristics of quantum computing include superposition, 
measurement, and entanglement. Superposition enables quantum system 
to be in more than one state with some probability at the same time. The 
quantum state interferes with each other in superposition. Constructive 
interference enables addition of probability amplitudes of quantum states, 
while destructive interference cancels out probability amplitudes of each 
quantum state. Besides, entanglement is achieved due to superposition of 
quantum states. Because of entanglement of quantum particles a single 
system is formed thus generating correlation between entangled particles. 
This generated correlation is so strong that interconnection between par-
ticles remains unchanged even separated over light-year distance. Besides, 
measurement of quantum particle collapses the superposition state of par-
ticles producing binary state either state 0 or state 1.
11.2.1.4 Available Quantum Platform
The major corporation of world is investing huge amount of money for 
research and development of quantum computing applications. Similar 
to cloud computing as a service, major corporations of world are plan-
ning to provide quantum computing as a service. Recently, Microsoft has 
announced public preview of one product related to quantum computing, 
namely, Azure Quantum. It will enable developers and researchers to run 
newly designed applications or algorithm on real quantum computer (upto 
40 bit quantum computer) through cloud. They have partnership with com-
panies like Riggeti and Honeywell to make quantum computer accessible 
through cloud. In addition, Azure quantum SDK is also available which 
will allow developers to test their newly designed algorithms testing or 
simulation locally. Similarly, IBM offers open source SDK, namely, Qiskit. 
It also allows developers to run and test their quantum algorithm either 
locally or through cloud to real quantum computer. Google also offers a 
python library, namely, Cirq, to be used while writing quantum algorithm 
before running them on real quantum computer or simulator. In addition, 
an open source library, namely, TensorFlow quantum, is available to run 
quantum classical machine learning applications.

11.2.2 Quantum Key Distribution
QKD is implemented by utilizing non-orthogonal single quantum states. 
The existing QKD protocols can be classified on the basis of dimensions 
of source code into discrete variable and continuous variable protocol, 
whereas, if entanglement of light source is taken into account, then it is 
classified into prepare and measure as well as entanglement based proto-
cols. The following subsections discuss the classified QKD in detail.
11.2.2.1 Discrete Variable QKD
While encoding and decoding these types of protocol includes finite- 
dimensional quantum states while, for key distribution, examples include 
all protocols which use certain number of relative phases of photon. 
Discrete variable QKD protocol incorporates prepare-and-measure as well 
as entanglement-based protocol in addition to distributed phase reference 
(DPR) protocol. With view to practical implementation of discrete variable 
QKD, first experiment results are revealed by Charles Bennett and Gilles 
Brassard. Later, extreme interest is shown by industry and governments 
with aim to improve the experimental results and extended the covered 
distance of QKD. Till date, discrete variable QKD can cover distance of 
200–300 km.
• Single-Photon Protocols: A type of quantum protocol 
which utilizes single photon’s different quantum states for 
encoding and decoding while distributing the keys. Various 
single-photon protocols includes protocol designed by 
Bennet and Brassard, namely, BB84 in the year 1984 [10], 
two-state protocol, namely, B92 [11], and six-state protocol 
by Bruß [12].
• Entangled Photon: A type of quantum protocol which uti-
lizes pair of mutual entangled photon for key distribution. 
These photons contrary to single photon utilizes entan-
gled states for communication. The few popular protocols 
under this category are protocols proposed by Bennett et al., 
namely, BBM92 [13], and by Ekert in 1991 [14].
• Other Discrete Variable protocols: Various researchers 
tried to explore the field and proposed different one way 
discrete variable protocols such as protocol by Inoue et al. 
in year 2002 [15], “fast and simple one way quantum key

distribution” by Stucki et al. [16] in year 2005. Besides, 
two-way discrete variable QKD protocol are well described 
through Bostrom and Felbinger [17] and by Lucamarini and 
Mancini, namely, LM05 protocol [18].
11.2.2.2 Continuous Variable QKD
It is type of QKD where infinite-dimensional quantum states are used while 
distributing keys. Further classification of continuous variable QKD leads 
us to squeezed state, entangled state, and coherent state schemes. Examples 
of squeezed protocols and coherent protocols are [19–21]. Besides, exper-
imental results of continuous variable QKD reveals transmission distance 
of 25 km. Later, major breakthrough is achieved in year 2013 when Jouguet 
et al. demonstrated successful implementation of QKD covering distance 
of 80 km [22].
11.2.2.3 Measurement Device-Independent QKD
Under the strict assumption of perfect single photon and photon detector, 
QKD is proved to be secure but QKD becomes vulnerable under loose 
assumption. Considering vulnerability under loose assumption, various 
researchers designed device-independent protocols such as protocol by 
Acin et al. [23]. However, inefficiency of loophole free bell test (LFBT) on 
which measurement device-independent protocols are based turns out to 
be serious issue. Later, protocols such as one side independent [24] and 
semidevice-independent [25] are proposed. In addition, various attacks 
such as wavelength dependent, faked state, and detector time shift attack 
are prevented using measurement device-independent QKD. The security 
proof and experimental analysis of these types of protocol is well described 
in [26].
11.2.3 Blockchain
It may be defined as list of linked records with properties such as data 
traceability and tamper-resistance. The list of linked records is known as 
blocks with each block connecting to previous block. Blockchain employs 
consensus algorithms for providing guarantee related to consistency of 
records. The privilege related to read-and-update the ledger leads us to 
classification of blockchain as public blockchain where strong autonomous

facilities exist by achieving pure decentralization settings and private 
blockchain which incorporates control over network up to some extent. 
Blocks used in blockchain utilize cryptographic hash function to create 
a chain. However, scalability and efficiency always remain a critical issue 
during blockchain implementation. Smart contract enables automation of 
blockchain-based applications in addition to ensuring few popular proper-
ties such as atomicity, synchronicity, provenance, availability, immutability, 
and immortability (no records can be removed) in blockchain, thus open-
ing up scope for designing various application in different industries rang-
ing from healthcare industry, energy industry, robotics energy, agriculture 
and food industry, and manufacturing industry. In addition, blockchain as 
a service is expected to completely revolutionize the existing centralized 
ecosystem. Figure 11.1, shows life cycle of transportation application in 
blockchain.
11.2.4 Reason for Blend of Blockchain and Quantum-Based 
Security in Applications Within Smart Cities
All existing applications designed and implemented in smart cities uti-
lize public-key cryptographic techniques to provide security. All public 
key cryptography-based protocol utilizes the assumption of mathematical 
hard problems, i.e., the security of existing applications within smart cit-
ies depends on mathematically hard problems such as integer factoriza-
tion (IF). However, the arrival of a few bits quantum chips has indicated 
the availability of full-fledged quantum computers in the market much 
sooner than anticipated. The arrival of a full-fledged quantum computer 
will make existing classical public key-based protocols vulnerable to such 
an extent that attackers do not require to work very hard to break any

system. Besides, utilizing blockchain technology direct access will be pro-
vided to every vehicle creating transactions in blockchain network related 
to vehicle’s activities on road. In addition, with use of different available 
application programming interfaces (APIs) along with smart contract, 
transmission of data and execution of transaction within blockchain net-
work will be enabled. Also, with vehicle’s public identity, all transaction 
related to vehicle will be entertained, thereby enabling unique identifica-
tion of all committed transaction in blockchain network. Later, vehicle can 
verify his records to toll point and district transportation agency when-
ever asked to verify while moving on road by sharing his secret key. Use of 
quantum secret based authentication and data sharing will provide uncon-
ditional security. Therefore, a decentralized quantum-based security will 
allow applications within smart cities to become more secure when com-
pared to traditional security techniques.
11.3 Related Work
A blockchain-based architecture to provide security in maintaining elec-
tronic health records is presented in [27]. This paper discusses incentive 
mechanism in detail with frequency of addition of new blocks while giv-
ing overview on access control techniques. In addition, a scheme by Yue 
et al. reveals different architecture utilizing blockchain to store health 
data records securely [28]. This work includes design of application using 
blockchain where patient health records can be shared with doctors, cli-
nician, etc., through access control mechanism. Also, in the scheme by 
Zhang et al. [29], two new protocols are presented, which enables forma-
tion of secure connection and sharing of data between different nodes in 
blockchain network. A scheme by Xia et al. [30] utilizes blockchain to 
share medical records. The work presents new data sharing scheme which 
is used by cloud infrastructure providers within blockchain network. In 
addition, a scheme by Liang et al. [31] discusses medical record sharing 
implementing blockchain in mobile healthcare applications. The work uses 
patient’s wearable devices, medical inputs manually added by doctors, etc., 
to constitute medical data record then stores the generated data in cloud, 
thereby enabling sharing of medical data with healthcare companies as per 
agreement. Later, a scheme by Lin and Guo [32] discusses a system uti-
lizing quantum blind signature in order to provide identity and message 
verification. The scheme generates secret keys for messages using quantum 
bits. Besides, in the scheme by Khodambashi and Zakerolhosseini [33], a 
smart contract is proposed utilizing quantum blind signature. This work

just not only protects the system from quantum attacks but also elimi-
nates the need of trusted third party. A scheme by Lin and Yanlin also uses 
quantum blind signature to propose quantum circuit which could become 
a perfect candidate to be used in development of electronic payment as 
well as electronic voting system [34]. A protocol by Minghui-Zhang et al. 
[35] uses entangled state for quantum blind signature in order to provide 
traceability, unforgeability, etc. Also, in [36], utilizing light weight quan-
tum blind signature, a smart contract in blockchain network is presented 
by Cai et al.
The availability of quantum computer will definitely boost up number 
of active applications utilizing quantum computing in various verticals of 
society. Quantum computing applications are used nowadays in ever grow-
ing industries that even blend quantum computing with popular machine 
learning applications. In addition, in field related to cloud computing, fog 
computing, and Internet of Things (IoT), vast opportunity is available to 
design applications that solve specific problems using quantum computing 
within any smart city. The potential of quantum computing is of extreme 
importance. Various researchers tried to uncover the hidden potential 
of quantum computing in different fields such as scheme by Sharma and 
Kalra [37] in field of cloud computing. The scheme utilizing QKD pre-
sented identity-based secure authentication for cloud infrastructure. The 
scheme ensures identity authentication with unconditional security. In 
cloud-related application areas, some notable works are also presented 
by research community such as in schemes [38–40] where properties of 
QKD are employed to authenticate the entities. The QKD is known to use 
polarization of photon to encode information. In the scheme by Lohachab 
and Karambir [41], QKD and payload-based techniques are presented for 
mutual authentication of IoT devices, employing elliptic curve cryptogra-
phy (ECC) in application area related to IoT. Also, in applications related 
to vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), identity authentication scheme is 
introduced for participating vehicles using QKD [42]. In addition, in [43], 
quantum authentication and communication protocol is designed utilizing 
one-time pad, while, in the scheme by Mehic et al., detailed discussion on 
performance of QKD network in widely used network simulator NS-3 is 
presented [44].

decision sequence, measurement sequence, template, and encrypted key 
generation.
11.4.1 Design Goal of Proposed Work
The security and privacy issues play a critical role while envisioning design 
goal of any protocol. Nowadays, easy availability of high-performance 
computing infrastructure has enabled any adversary to attack on critical 
infrastructure very comfortably. In addition, announcement of huge prize 
money in form of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin on dark web with aim to 
manifest coordinated attack has threatened any infrastructure like never 
before. Therefore, with aim to ensure secure communication in the pro-
posed SRP system within smart cities utilizing quantum-blockchain, pre-
cautions against the following are designed as goals.
11.4.1.1  Impersonation Attack
It is a form of attack where adversary after manifesting himself to be trusted 
entity of network shares sensitive information thus creating a confusion 
within the network. The adversary steals the legal parameters to carry out 
impersonation attack.
11.4.1.2  Sybil Attack
It is a form of attack where adversary operates multiple pseudonymous 
identities in order to influence the authority of network. The multiple 
pseudonymous identities enables adversary to broadcast multiple bogus 
message, thus allowing him to conduct illegal actions. Examples of Sybil 
attack include 51% attacks in the blockchain network and generation of 
multiple fake reviews to any products in e-commerce platform. In order 
to prevent Sybil attack, different powers to different members need to 
be assigned. In addition, payment of certain cost for each member who 
intends to connect in the network should be followed, i.e., cost to create 
an identity must be accompanied. Also, the direct and indirect validation 
mechanism should be carried out to members before joining the network.
11.4.1.3 Message Modification Attack
It is a form of active attack where adversary aims to alter, delay, or 
reorder some segment of message for purpose of fulfilling unintended 
effect. It involves modifying the packet header and usually performed

when adversary wants to either disturb or gain insights about receiver. 
Whenever instead of altering or reordering the message adversary insert 
fake data within some section of message, then it leads to bogus infor-
mation attack.
11.4.1.4 Message Replay Attack
It is the form of attack where adversary delays or resends the intercepted 
message with aim to generate the mirage of accidents of packet to legal 
receiver. With proper technique of encryption, timestamping of each mes-
sage along with small window time, establishing a session with random key 
which can be utilized only once, could prevent the network from message 
replay attack.
11.4.1.5 Denial-of-Service Attack
It is the form of attack where adversary floods the network with traffic 
information, fake requests, or with information that is responsible for trig-
gering a crash. The adversary performs denial-of-service attack with aim 
to overload the network so that legitimate message cannot be entertained, 
i.e., intended members are denied with access to network.
11.4.1.6 Source Authentication
The process of ensuring the legitimacy of sender is called as source authen-
tication. It is one of the primary features, which prevents the network from 
outsider attack.
11.4.1.7 Message Integrity
The process of ensuring that message are not altered or tampered during 
communication within the network by any adversary. Message digest is 
widely used to check the message integrity. Message digest is obtained 
whenever message is passed through hash function. Receiver, after receiv-
ing message and digest pair from sender, computes new digest after pass-
ing the received message from hash function. In addition, comparison of 
new computed digest and received digest is performed by receiver to verify 
integrity of message.

11.4.1.8 Identity Privacy Preservation
The process of preserving real identities of members within the network 
is known as identity privacy preservation. It is achieved by anonymizing 
the real identities of members with the help of pseudo identities within the 
network.
11.4.2 Conversion of Bits From One State to Another
The proposed work uses QKD and thus requires participation of quan-
tum bit. With use of polarization of photon and interconversion rule, con-
version of binary bit to quantum bit and vice versa occurs. The proposed 
protocol denotes photon polarizer through decision sequence and mea-
surement sequence. It may be noted that decision sequence and measure-
ment sequence are alike but do not carry out same function.
11.4.3 Decision Sequence
Decision sequence enables conversion of binary bit into quantum bit. It 
consists of two types of polarizer, namely, circular and linear polarizer. 
Horizontal and vertical directions are used to denote linear polarizer, 
while diagonal direction denotes circular polarizer. In addition, circular 
and linear polarizer consists of two states which are orthogonal to each 
other. To be specific, circular and linear polarizer follows orthogonality 
property.
11.4.4 Interconversion Rule
Interconversion rule is widely used during conversion of bits. In accor-
dance with interconversion rule, sender utilizes decision sequence to 
find out which polarized photon aligns to zero or one. In proposed work, 
interconversion rule is defined as follows: | →> ⇒ 0, and | ↑> ⇒1. Also, 
| ↗> ⇒ 0 and | ↖> ⇒ 1.
11.4.5  Measurement Sequence
Measurement sequence enables restoration of binary bit from quantum 
bit. It also consists of two types of polarizer, namely, rectilinear and diago-
nal polarizer similar to linear and circular polarizer of decision sequence.

In fact, the linear and rectilinear polarizer along with circular and diag-
onal polarizer correlate with each other. Moreover, in accordance with 
uncertainty principle, decision sequence and measurement sequence are 
conjugate bases with rectilinear (linear) and diagonal (circular) polarizer 
as conjugate states, i.e., receiver will only able to retrieve certain results if 
linear polarizer is measured by rectilinear and circular polarizer are mea-
sured by diagonal polarizer. On contrary, uncertain results are obtained. In 
addition, existence of non-orthogonality property between linear (recti-
linear) and circular (diagonal) polarizer makes them indistinguishable. In 
the Table 11.1, L and R are used to denote linear and rectilinear polarizer, 
whereas C and D represent circular and diagonal polarizer.
11.4.6 Template and Encrypted Key Generation
Decision sequence and measurement sequence are randomly chosen by 
sender and receiver during communication. The generation of template 
occurs in accordance with decision sequence and measurement sequence. 
In addition, pre-master secret is generated as shown in Table 11.1. 
The pre-master secret comprises of accurate as well as inaccurate binary 
bits. Besides, 1/2k denotes selection probability of accurate measurement 
where k signifies length of bits. The accurate measurement sequence is 
shown in green color. Moreover, observing pre-master secret and template, 
encrypted key [0101] is produced as reported in Table 11.2.
11.5 Proposed Work
The proposed quantum blockchain–enabled SRP system includes four 
roles, namely, vehicles, road side units, network admin, and district

SRP system gets illustrated in Figure 11.3. There is one district transportation 
agency within any smart city responsible for maintaining records of all regis-
tered vehicles within any city. The district transportation agency handles the 
collection of money in penalties or taxes by deploying different infrastructures 
such as toll points. In addition, the generation of driving licenses, pollution 
certificates, documents related to the vehicle, etc., is also managed by the dis-
trict transportation agency. In addition, to stop the unlawful driving activities 
by young drivers, members of the district transportation agency perform strict 
auditing at any junction or crossroads within the city. The uninformed and 
instant auditing by members of the district transportation agency leads to an 
exponential decrement in lane speed violations and hazardous accidents, cre-
ating safe and secure transport facilities within the city.

QKD is used within smart contract. Specifically, a quantum communica-
tion protocol, namely, BB84, which is proposed by Bennett and Brassard 
is used. The BB84 allows unconditionally secure exchange of keys between 
parties as well as enables intrusion detection by prohibiting copying of 
quantum states in accordance with no-cloning theorem. The implementa-
tion of BB84 protocol utilizes polarization photons (linear and circularly 
polarized photons) in order to encode information. These polarization pho-
tons are well known for encoding one bit string to q bit and can retrieve q 
bit string to traditional binary bits. The high-level description and basics of 
proposed protocol is already discussed in Section 11.4. Besides, Table 11.3 
summaries the notations which are used in the proposed work whereas 
Table 11.4 reports the time complexity of proposed algorithms. The secu-
rity of BB84 protocol is well discussed in [45].
11.5.3 Life Cycle of Smart Contract
The proposed quantum blockchain–enabled SRP system for smart cities 
incorporates smart contracts utilizing quantum blind signature. The quan-
tum blind signature is well discussed in [46]. The post-quantum  blockchain–
enabled application within any smart city utilizes quantum blind signature 
to provide unconditional security, which includes three stages, namely, con-
tract development stage, contract release stage, and contract execution stage, 
as illustrated in Figure 11.4. As the name suggests, contract development

stage revolves around development of smart contract. It primarily includes 
exchange of keys using QKD, contract negotiation, contract coding, and 
quantum blind signature. The second stage, namely, contract release stage, 
includes process to perform contract testing thereby performing release 
of contract. Execution of contract testing will allow transfer of smart con-
tract to each node within the network. As soon as each node receives smart 
contract due to implementation of contract testing, it performs packing 
of received smart contract into a set known as contract set. Contract set 
contains hash value of contract in set and then transfer to different nodes 
in the blockchain network for further processing. The other nodes, after 
receiving this contract set, compare the hash with its own contract, leading 
to decision by all nodes in network regarding release of contract. The third 
stage, namely, contract execution stage activities, just not only includes trig-
gering of contract and creation of block but also verification of quantum

blind signature and execution of protocol. In fact, contract execution is per-
formed using event-based trigger mechanism. As soon as smart contract, 
which requires verification of quantum blind signature, is received to any 
node within the network, then verification of quantum blind signature is 
carried out by respective node. Successful verification will result in creation 
of new block otherwise not only creation of block gets failed but prohibition 
of contract execution also takes place.
11.5.4 Algorithm Design and Flow
The QKD occurs between trader and block creator. As soon as utilizing 
negotiated key, a signed transaction message is received to block creator, 
utilizing shared key K, the decryption process of signature is performed by 
block creator, thus producing business request R. It may be noted that since 
there is chance of collapsing a block creator in any stages of life cycle of 
smart contract therefore block creator by performing recovery techniques 
can recover from that particular stage. In addition, automatic execution of 
contract is enabled in case where business request R and specific signature 
state b is found to be same otherwise leading to failure of block creation. 
The steps for execution of smart contract is illustrated through Figure 11.5.
11.5.4.1 Stage 1: Contract Development
The development phase of contract uses QKD for exchange of keys. QKD 
enables sharing of keys through quantum channel between block creator 
and trader. In addition, block creator prepares n pair entangled particles 
in superposition state. Then, negotiation of contract with respect to con-
tract term and quantum keys is carried out. After that, block creator and 
trader analyze the feasibility of contract term, safety of channel and key. 
Henceforth, with aim to process business transaction request Ti, blinding 
factor t and transaction summary k are chosen randomly.
 T tkT mod ni i( )  (11.4)
Now, result obtained after blind transformation of transaction request is 
forwarded to signer. After carefully selecting negotiation particles, signer 
generates quantum state Ti corresponding to each pair of particles.
 Ti|(a) >= Ti|(a) >= α|0 > + β|1 > where, |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.  (11.5)

Post-Quantum Blockchain in Smart Cities 287
Next, business trader forwards quantum state Ti(b) to block creator 
while retain Ti(a) to itself. Block creator then verifies the validity of signed 
transaction request and communicates entangled pairs back to trader. As 
soon as trader listens back from block creator, calculates particle ai, Ti, and 
obtains encrypted result, thereby utilizing bell measurement for generating 
quantum key corresponding to signature S.
 S = Ek(Ti) (11.6)
11.5.4.2 Stage 2: Contract Release
In this stage, contract testing is done. If testing results is found to be posi-
tive, then release of contract is performed.
11.5.4.3 Step 3: Contract Execution
In this stage, triggering of contract is performed after successful fulfillment 
of conditions. After triggering, the verification process of quantum blind 
signature is accomplished, leading to conduction of contract evaluation 
and contract execution. The successful verification will generate a transac-
tion message Ti . As soon as contract is executed, in addition to creation of 
a new block, broadcast of message revealing successful transaction to all 
nodes within the network is performed.

11.6 Conclusion
The potential of quantum computing has threatened existing infrastruc-
ture, thus motivating research community to design new quantum resis-
tant protocols.
Besides, use of blockchain enables complete transformation of var-
ious applications in any smart cities. Blockchain eliminates need of 
trusted third party, thus decentralizing the smart city application with 
automated secure data collection and sharing while ensuring protection 
against single point of failure. In addition, the amalgamation of quan-
tum computing with blockchain can do the wonders for any smart cities

applications. Therefore, this chapter just not only discusses in detail 
about quantum computing, blockchain, blend of blockchain, and quan-
tum computing but also describes a post-quantum blockchain architec-
ture for transportation application within any smart city. The description 
also includes design of a SRP system containing smart contracts with 
aim to store and share vehicle records securely among four roles, namely, 
vehicle, toll points, network administrator of network, and district trans-
portation agency. The presented work will not only enable smooth man-
agement of vehicle records but also boost up the collaboration between 
different organization situated within the same city, thereby realizing 
vision of robust and inclusive smart city.
