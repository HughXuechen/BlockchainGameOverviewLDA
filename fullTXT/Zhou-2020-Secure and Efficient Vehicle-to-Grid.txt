Abstract—Smart grid has emerged as a successful application
of cyber-physical systems in the energy sector. Among numerous
key technologies of the smart grid, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) provides
a promising solution to reduce the level of demand–supply mis-
match by leveraging the bidirectional energy-trading capabilities
of electric vehicles. In this paper, we propose a secure and effi-
cient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain,
contract theory, and edge computing. First, we develop a con-
sortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for
V2G. Then, we consider the information asymmetry scenario,
and propose an efficient incentive mechanism based on contract
theory. The social welfare optimization problem falls into the cat-
egory of difference of convex programming and is solved by using
the iterative convex–concave procedure algorithm. Next, edge
computing has been incorporated to improve the successful prob-
ability of block creation. The computational resource allocation
problem is modeled as a two-stage: 1) Stackelberg leader–follower
game and 2) the optimal strategies are obtained by using the
backward induction approach. Finally, the performance of the
proposed framework is validated via numerical results and
theoretical analysis.

usability of physical systems [1], [2]. A typical application
of CPSs in the energy sector is the smart grid [3], which
employs up-to-date information, communication, and control
technologies to optimize the management and operation of
power grids. Various researchers have investigated the smart
grid from the perspective of cyber-physical integration, such
as cyber-physical energy management [4] and cyber-physical
attack mitigation [5].
However, the large-scale penetration of intermittent dis-
tributed renewable energy sources and uncoordinated electric
vehicles (EVs) leads to significant power fluctuation [6]–[9]. In
order to maintain the reliable and safe operations of the smart
grid, a large number of centralized generators, and energy
storage devices have to be deployed, which results in sig-
nificant capital expenditure and operational expenditure [10].
An alternative choice is to leverage the bidirectional energy-
trading capabilities of EVs. Particularly, a large group of EVs
can be coordinated to absorb excessive energy during the off-
peak time and deliver energy back to the grid during the
peak time, which provides a promising solution to flatten out
the peak load and reduce the level of demand–supply mis-
match without deploying additional generators and storage
devices [11], [12]. This new energy trading paradigm is known
as vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which is essential to build a safer
and more sustainable CPS in the energy sector [13].
The studies on V2G energy trading have received consider-
able attentions from both industry and academia. A distributed
EV cooperation mechanism was proposed in [13], which not
only enables the efficient management of charging and dis-
charging operations, but also offers V2G regulation services
to support grid operation. Pal and Kumar [14] presented a
neighbor connection-based energy scheduling approach, which
explores both vehicle-to-home and V2G energy trading to
reduce household electricity payments. Despite the above-
mentioned advantages, the wide area deployment of V2G still
confronts several critical challenges, which are summarized as
follows.
First, there lacks a distributed security mechanism for V2G
energy trading. Conventional centralized mechanisms rely on
a trusted intermediary to manage, audit, and verify every
energy transaction [15], which is vulnerable to a series of
security threats, such as single point of failure, denial of
service attacks, and privacy leakage [16]. For example, a
transaction record may be changed, tampered, or deleted by

some malicious middleman attackers. Most of the current
works mainly concentrate on EV charging and discharging
management [11], [13], [17], [18], while the security and pri-
vacy issues have been neglected. Therefore, a distributed
security mechanism is indispensable to guarantee the reliable
operation of large-scale V2G energy trading in an untrusted
and nontransparent energy market.
Second, there lacks an efficient incentive mechanism for
V2G energy trading. Due to the increased battery consump-
tion and other costs incurred by discharging, EV owners are
reluctant to participate in large-scale V2G energy trading
unless they are well compensated. For example, EV own-
ers usually suffer from the problem of range anxiety due to
the limited cruising range and the long charging time [19].
Hence, when designing the incentive mechanism, a sufficient
amount of energy must be preserved for EV owners in order to
reach their destinations. Furthermore, the preference of each
EV toward V2G participation belongs to the EV’s private
information, which is only known by the EV itself. This sce-
nario is called information asymmetry. Most of the previous
works, e.g., [11], [13], and [20], have assumed that the EV’s
information is perfectly known by every entity in the energy
market, and cannot be directly applied to V2G energy trad-
ing with asymmetric information. Therefore, it is of vital
importance to develop an incentive mechanism, which can
effectively maximize the economic benefits under the scenario
of information asymmetry.
To address the above challenges, we develop a new V2G
framework for CPSs, which leverages blockchain, contract
theory, and edge computing to enable secure and efficient
energy trading [21]. We consider a V2G energy trading sce-
nario which involves three major entities: 1) local energy
aggregators (LEAGs); 2) EVs; and 3) edge computing service
provider (ESP) [22], [23]. The energy trading between LEAGs
and EVs is secured by employing consortium blockchain, in
which all the transactions are created, propagated, and veri-
fied by authorized LEAGs. Then, we put forward a contract
theory-based incentive mechanism to motivate EVs to par-
ticipate in energy trading. The contract is tailored for the
unique characteristic of each EV type to maximize the utility
of the LEAG under the constraints of individual rational-
ity (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), and monotonicity. The
formulated contract optimization problem falls into the cate-
gory of difference of convex (DC) programming. We further
reduce the total number of IR and IC constraints by exploiting
the relationships between adjacent EV types. The simplified
problem is solved by using the iterative convex–concave pro-
cedure (CCP) algorithm. Several heuristic schemes are also
developed as performance benchmarks. Next, edge computing
has been incorporated in block creation to reduce transmis-
sion as well as processing latency. Specifically, LEAGs can
purchase services from the ESP, and offload the computation-
intensive proof-of-work puzzles to proximate edge computing
nodes. Considering the conflicting objectives of the ESP and
LEAGs, the interaction between them is modeled as a two-
stage Stackelberg leader–follower game [24], [25], and the
optimal service price and service demands are obtained by
using the backward induction approach. Finally, we provide
a comprehensive theoretical analysis on contract feasibility,
performance convergence, game equilibrium, and energy trad-
ing security. The relationships among social welfare, EV
type, reward, discharged electricity, edge computing service
price, and edge computing service demands are elaborated via
numerical results.

II. RELATED WORK
Blockchain is a specific distributed shared database, which
has been illustrated to possess salient advantages, includ-
ing security, immutability, and decentralization [15]. It allows
every transaction to be recorded in a verifiable and permanent
way, which is essential to create a distributed, transpar-
ent, and secure energy-trading environment. Blockchain has
experienced rapid evolutions from version 1.0 to 3.0. While
blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 are more related to Bitcoin and
cryptcurrencies, as well as transferring contracts or proper-
ties, blockchain 3.0 extends its application fields from financial
transactions to much broader sectors, including energy, edu-
cation, government, health, etc. [26]. Recent works have
employed blockchain to address the transaction security issues
of peer-to-peer energy trading among EVs. Liu et al. [27]
proposed a decentralized blockchain-enabled EV charging
scheme to simultaneously minimize the fluctuation level of the
power grid and the EV charging cost. Li et al. [28] proposed
a blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading system for
industrial Internet of Things, which relies on a credit-based
payment strategy to reduce transaction confirmation latency.
Aggarwal et al. [29] proposed a blockchain model named
EnergyChain to enable secure energy trading between smart
grid and smart home, which involves miner selection, block
creation and validation, and transaction handling. However,
due to the high computational cost associated with block cre-
ation, blockchain has not been widely deployed in EVs with
limited computational capabilities.

ZHOU et al.: SECURE AND EFFICIENT V2G ENERGY TRADING IN CPSs: INTEGRATION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND EDGE COMPUTING 45
To reduce the computational complexity, we propose an
edge computing-based consortium blockchain, in which a dis-
tributed ledger is created, publicly audited, and shared by
multiple authorized nodes with moderate cost. First, unlike
conventional blockchain, the distributed shared databases are
only maintained by authorized LEAGs [30]. Second, edge
computing [31], where computational resources are distributed
across network edges, is employed to solve the proof-of-work
puzzles of block creation. Compared to centralized cloud com-
puting, edge computing is more suitable to handle large-scale
decentralized energy-trading transactions. Since the compu-
tational tasks are processed at close proximity to end users,
dispensable network hops and transmission latency can be
effectively eliminated.
Edge computing has been widely applied in a series of
delay-sensitive applications to reduce computational delay.
Garg et al. [32] proposed a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-
enabled edge computing framework where data are transferred
from vehicles to edge nodes for real-time processing by lever-
aging UAVs as intermediate aerial communication devices.
A probabilistic data structure-based cyber-threat detection
approach was developed to handle the data of vehicles.
Zhou et al. [33] proposed a new edge computing framework
from an air–ground integration perspective, in which the com-
munication and computational resources of both UAVs and
vehicles are combined in a complementary manner to pro-
vide massive-connectivity low-latency ultrareliable services.
In [34], a robust mobile crowd sensing framework was
developed by integrating deep learning-based data validation
with edge computing-based local processing. Different from
the above-mentioned works, we focus on the application sce-
nario of blockchain-based energy trading in V2G, and the
application-specific characteristics, such as Hash power, suc-
cessful probability of block creation, and propagation time
of block are taken into account. The computational resource
allocation problem is modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg
leader–follower game, in which the positions of players are
hierarchial, and the leader, i.e., the ESP, can enforce its own
strategy upon the followers, i.e., LEAGs.
Another challenge in V2G energy trading is the incen-
tive design. There exists some work which have addressed
the incentive design problem in V2G by exploiting robust
optimization theory [11], Stackelberg game [35], genetic algo-
rithm [36], etc. A generalized Stackelberg game-based pricing
scheme was proposed to optimize the operations of V2G from
the perspective of energy and reserve [35]. Ghofrani et al. [36]
developed a genetic algorithm-based EV charging and dis-
charging mechanism to minimize the penalty cost of wind
power imbalance as well as the EV discharging expenses.
Nevertheless, all these works rely on a common assump-
tion that the EV-side information is perfectly known by the
LEAG, while information asymmetry has been neglected. In
this paper, we consider the more realistic scenario where
the precise EV-side information is unknown, and develop a
contract-based incentive mechanism to maximize the expected
utility of LEAG based on contract theory. Contract theory pro-
vides a powerful tool to address the incentive problem with
asymmetric information [37], and has already been widely

applied in various applications, including device-to-device
communications [38], cognitive radio [37], and small-cell
caching systems [39].
In summary, we investigate the feasibility of integrating
consortium blockchain, contract theory, and edge computing
to realize secure and efficient V2G energy trading in CPSs.
The proposed framework can effectively improve transaction
security and privacy protection, motivate EVs to participate
in energy trading, and increase the successful probability of
block creation.
III. CONSORTIUM BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURE ENERGY
TRADING FRAMEWORK
The consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading for
V2G is shown in Fig. 1, which consists of three major entities:
1) EV; 2) LEAG; and 3) ESP. The specific capability and
functionality of each entity are elaborated as follows.
A. EV
EVs with bi directional energy trading capabilities are able
to play different roles. On the one hand, an EV can act as an
energy producer by discharging its battery to provide electric-
ity during the peak time. On the other hand, it can also act
as an energy consumer by charging its battery with cheaper
electricity while helping to absorb the excess energy during
the off-peak time. With a properly designed incentive mecha-
nism, each EV can actively adjust its charging and discharging
behaviors to maximize its individual payoff. The details for
how to design the incentive mechanism will be illustrated in
Section IV-B.

B. LEAG
The LEAG provides an array of energy trading services,
including information collection, status monitoring, and charg-
ing/discharging coordination. For example, during the peak
time, the LEAG can employ a group of discharging EVs
to produce energy in response to local peak load demands.
Meanwhile, the EVs which participate in the energy trading
will obtain dedicated payments for their contributions to local
supply demand balance. Here, energy coin which is one kind
of digital cryptocurrency is utilized as the payment for the
energy trading.
There are three major components in the LEAG: 1) a
memory server; 2) an account server; and 3) a transac-
tion server. All of the transaction records in the consortium
blockchain are stored in the memory server. The digital assets
of each EV in terms of energy coins are stored in a digital
wallet. To preserve privacy, the true address of the wallet is
replaced by a set of public keys, e.g., random pseudonyms.
Each EV also has a transaction account which stores all of its
transaction records. The mapping relationships between ran-
dom wallet addresses and corresponding transaction account
are maintained in the account server. The transaction server
is responsible to implement incentive mechanisms and coor-
dinate charging and discharging activities.
C. ESP
The ESP with unified control of the integrated computation,
communication, and storage resources provides edge comput-
ing services for LEAGs. The ESP issues a price for its service,
and each LEAG determines the service demand to be pur-
chased based on the price. Then, the computation-intensive
proof-of-work puzzles can be offloaded from an LEAG to its
proximate edge computing nodes instead of being processed
locally or by remote cloud nodes. The details for how to model
the interactions between the ESP and LEAGs, and how to
design the optimal service price and service demands will be
illustrated in Section V.
The operation details of the consortium blockchain-based
secure energy trading are explained as follows. Existing
cryptographic algorithms, including elliptic curve digital sig-
nature algorithm (ECDSA), Boneh–Boyen short signature, and
SHA-256, have been employed. In the beginning, each EV
has to register with a legitimate authority to obtain its public
key, privacy key, and certificate. The public/privacy keys can
be generated and distributed by the authority. The certificate
represents a unique identity for the EV via binding its reg-
istration information. Each EV has a set of wallet addresses
issued by the authority. During initialization, an EV finds the
wallet address that is used by its nearest LEAG and verifies
the wallet integrity. Afterward, it downloads the corresponding
data from the memory server.
The secrecy of the private key is maintained by the EV
for signing transactions, while the public key is shared with
other authorized entities to verify its signatures [40]. The pub-
lic/privacy keys can be generated by using some specific algo-
rithms, such as ECDSA [41], a new signature scheme based
on lattice [42], a novel anti-quantum transaction authentication
scheme in the blockchain [43], etc.
After energy trading, a discharging EV will receive the
specified reward if the corresponding contract item has been
successfully fulfilled. The energy coins are transferred from
the LEAG to the wallet address of the EV. The transac-
tion is digitally signed by the LEAG to ensure its integrity
and authenticity, and then is broadcasted to the network. The
other LEAGs not only check the transaction via analyzing the
digital signature, but also check whether the LEAG which
issues this transaction is authorized to spend the energy coin
or not. A fake transaction will be discarded, and only valid
transactions are included in a new block.
Next, to add the new block to the blockchain, all the autho-
rized LEAGs start the mining process, in which they compete
to find a valid proof of work similar to Bitcoin [44]. This pro-
cess requires to find a random value α, combined with the hash
of the previous block header � and the hash of transactions,
which satisfies Hash(α+�) < β. Here, β represents the level
of difficulty [45]. If an LEAG finds a valid proof of work,
it will broadcast the result to other authorized LEAGs. Upon
receiving the result, the other LEAGs verify it and determine
whether to accept it or not. If a majority of LEAGs agree on the
result, i.e., a consensus has been reached, then the new block
will be added to the blockchain, and the LEAG which created
this block will be rewarded by a certain amount of energy
coins. Finally, the amount of energy coins that is transferred
from the LEAG to the EV will be received in the EV’s wallet.
It requires extremely high computational power to create a
false block, find a valid proof of work before other LEAGs,
and control the majority of the LEAGs [26]. Furthermore,
malicious attacks which try to modify the transaction records
can be prevented since each validated block is linked to the
previous block via secure cryptography methods. Any change
of a transaction will affect both the block containing it and
subsequent blocks.
If the computational capability of an LEAG is limited, it
can purchase edge computing services from the ESP. Then,
the computation-intensive proof-of-work process is handled
by nearby edge computing nodes with powerful computation
capabilities, and the successful probability of block creation
will be significantly improved. We assume that transaction
verification is handled locally by LEAGs in order to reduce
the cost of purchasing computing service. The reason is the
computational complexity of transaction verification is much
lower that of block creation, i.e., mining. Taking Bitcoin for
example, the level of difficulty is dynamically adjusted after
every 2016 blocks to guarantee that the block generation time
is exactly 600 s [46]. As the total computational power of
the overall network increases continuously, the difficulty is
also increased accordingly to maintain the fixed block gen-
eration time. Nevertheless, the proposed framework can be
easily extended to the scenario where both block creation and
transaction verification are offloaded to edge computing nodes.
The data shared among EVs, LEAGs, and ESP also suffer
from the chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext
attack (CCA). CPA represents an attack strategy for crypt-
analysis in which the ciphertexts for arbitrary plaintexts are
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:14:32 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
ZHOU et al.: SECURE AND EFFICIENT V2G ENERGY TRADING IN CPSs: INTEGRATION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND EDGE COMPUTING 47
available to the attacker [47]. CCA represents another attack
model in which the cryptanalyst collect information from
decryptions of chosen ciphertexts and try to recover the secret
key based on the collected information. Since how to mitigate
CPA and CCA has already been intensively investigated, it is
ignored here due to space limitation and is left to the future
work. Interested readers can refer to related works [47]–[50].
The decentralized consensus can be guaranteed due to the
following two reasons. First, the ESP mainly makes a revenue
by selling computing services, and is not rewarded for block
creation. Thus, it does not have a strong incentive to cheat in
verification. Second, a new block is verified by every LEAG
independently according to the same rules. If some dishonest
LEAGs accept some fake transactions in a new block, the other
honest LEAGs will update their own copy of the blockchain
without using the invalid block. As a result, the fake block
branch is much shorter than the valid branch, which will be
discarded since LEAGs only maintain a copy of the longest
chain [51].
IV. CONTRACT-BASED INCENTIVE MECHANISM
FOR V2G ENERGY TRADING
A. EV Type Modeling
We use EV type to quantify the preference of an EV toward
discharging, which is only known by the EV itself. A higher-
type EV is more willing to participate in the V2G energy
trading and discharge a larger amount of electricity to gain a
higher reward. It is intuitive that EVs with higher types are
more preferred by the LEAG. For the sake of simplicity, we
assume that the set of EV types belongs to a discrete and finite
space. The EV type is defined as follows.
Definition 1: Considering a parking lot with K discharging
EVs, these EVs can be sorted in an ascending order based on
their preferences and classified into K types. If the set of EV
types is denoted as � = {θ1, . . . , θk, . . . , θK}, then we have
θ1 < · · · < θk < · · · < θK, k = 1, . . . ,K. (1)
In the following, we derive the specific expression of the
EV type. Considering type θk EV, the stage of charge (SoC)
is calculated as [52]
SoCc
k = Ec
k
Ek,max
(2)
where Ec
k represents the amount of currently available energy,
and Ek,max is the battery capacity. After discharging, the
remaining SoC should satisfy the minimum energy require-
ment of traveling, which is given by
Ec
k − Lk
Ek,max
≥ χ(dk) (3)
where Lk is the required amount of electricity and dk is the dis-
tance that has to be traveled before the next charging. χ(dk)
denotes the minimum electricity required to travel the dis-
tance dk, which is a monotonically increasing function of
dk. By combining (2) and (3), we can derive the discharging
capability, which is given by
Lk ≤ [
SoCc
k − χ(dk)
]
Ek,max. (4)
Hence, type θk can be defined as
θk := [
SoCc
k − χ(dk)
]
Ek,max. (5)
Remark 1: From (5), it is observed that θk is positively
proportional to SoCc
k and Ek,max, and inversely proportional
to χ(dk). For example, a larger EV type represents that either
the EV has more energy available, or it will not travel a long
distance in the near future.
In the information asymmetry scenario, the LEAG does not
know the specific type of each EV, but only has the knowledge
of the probability distribution of each type. We assume that the
LEAG knows that there are a total of K types of discharging
EVs and an EV belongs to type θk with a probability Pk, i.e.,∑K
k=1 Pk = 1.
B. Contract Formulation
Instead of providing the same contract for EVs with dif-
ferent types, a contract which consists of K contract items is
designed for K types of discharging EVs, i.e., one for each
type. For example, the contract item designed for type θk EV
is denoted as (Lk,Rk), where Lk denotes the required electric-
ity and Rk is the dedicated reward in terms of energy coins.
The contract is defined as C = {(Lk,Rk) ∀k ∈ K}, where
K = {1, . . . , k, . . . ,K}.
Considering the K types of EVs, the expected utility of the
LEAG is calculated as
UL({Lk}, {Rk}) = K
K∑
k=1
Pk(γLLk − Rk) (6)
where γL is the unit value of electricity for the LEAG.
Remark 2: A contract item (Lk = 0,Rk = 0) means that
type θk EV does not intend to participate in discharging. On
the other hand, the LEAG will benefit from the EV discharging
only if γLLk − Rk ≥ 0. Otherwise, the LEAG has no incentive
to employ type θk EV for discharging.
The utility function of type θk EV which accepts the contract
item (Lk,Rk) is given by
UEV
k (Lk,Rk) = θkm(Rk)− γLk (7)
where γ is the unit cost of discharging the battery. θkm(Rk)
represents the value of Rk for type θk EV. The function m(Rk)
is a monotonically increasing concave function of Rk, where
m(0) = 0, m′(Rk) > 0, and m′′(Rk) < 0. Without loss of
generality, m(Rk) can be defined as a quadratic function, i.e.,
m(Rk) = −a
2
R2
k + bRk (8)
where a and b are assumed as constants, which should sat-
isfy m′(Rk) > 0 and m′′(Rk) < 0. Nevertheless, the proposed
scheme can be extended to other forms.
The expected social welfare is the total sum utility of the
LEAG and the K EVs, which is given by
SW({Lk}, {Rk}) = UL({Lk}, {Rk})+ K
K∑
k=1

k (Lk,Rk). (9)

The utility of LEAG maximization problem under asymmetric
information is formulated as
P1: max{Lk},{Rk}
UL({Lk}, {Rk})
s.t. C1 : θkm(Rk)− γLk ≥ 0, (IR)
C2 : θkm(Rk)− γLk ≥ θkm(Rk′)− γLk′ , (IC)
C3 : 0 ≤ R1 < · · · < Rk < · · · < RK
C4 : Lk ≤ θk
∀k, k′ ∈ K (10)
where C1, C2, and C3 represent the IR, IC, and monotonicity
constraints, respectively. C4 represents the upper bound of Lk.
Definition 2: The IR, IC, and monotonicity constraints are
defined as follows.
1) IR Constraint: Type θk EV, ∀k ∈ K, will get a non-
negative payoff if it selects the contract item (Lk,Rk).
2) IC Constraint: The IC constraint ensures the self-
revealing property of the contract. For instance, type θk
EV ∀k ∈ K, will get the maximum payoff if and only if
it selects the contract item (Lk,Rk) designed for its own
type.
3) Monotonicity Constraint: The reward of type θk EV ∀k ∈
K, should be higher than that of type θk−1 EV, and lower
than that of type θk+1 EV.
Based on the IR, IC, and monotonicity constraints, the
following properties can be derived.
Lemma 1: For any k, k′ ∈ K, if θk > θk′ , then Rk > Rk′ .
Rk = Rk′ if and only if θk = θk′ .
Lemma 2: For any Lk,Rk ∈ C, the following inequalities
hold:
0 ≤ R1 ≤ · · · ≤ Rk ≤ · · · ≤ RK
0 ≤ L1 ≤ · · · ≤ Lk ≤ · · · ≤ LK
0 ≤ UEV
1 ≤ · · · ≤ UEV
k ≤ · · · ≤ UEV
K . (11)
Proof: The detailed proof of Lemmas 1 and 2 are omitted
here due to space limitation. A similar proof can be found
in [38].
C. Optimal Contract Design Under Information Asymmetry
1) Contract Feasibility: First, we define the sufficient and
necessary conditions for contract feasibility.
Theorem 1 (Contract Feasibility): The contract C =
{(Lk,Rk) ∀k ∈ K} is feasible if and only if all the following
conditions are satisfied.
1) 0 ≤ R1 ≤ · · · ≤ Rk ≤ · · · ≤ RK and 0 ≤ L1 ≤ · · · ≤
Lk ≤ · · · ≤ LK .
2) θ1m(R1)− γL1 ≥ 0.
3) For any k ∈ {2, . . . ,K}, γLk−1 + θk−1[m(Rk) −
m(Rk−1)] ≤ γLk ≤ γLk−1 + θk[m(Rk)− m(Rk−1)].
Proof: The detailed proof of Theorem 1 is omitted here
due to space limitation. A similar proof can be found in
[37, Appendix D].
2) Problem Transformation: The utility of LEAG
maximization problem P1 involves K IR constraints and
K(K − 1) IC constraints. To provide a tractable solution, the
following procedures are carried out to simplify the problem.
Step 1 (IR Constraints Elimination): For type θk EV, k ∈
K, k �= 1, we can derive
θkm(Rk)− γLk ≥ θkm(R1)− γL1 > θ1m(R1)− γL1 ≥ 0
(12)
where the first inequality is due to the IC constraint, the second
inequality is due to θk > θ1, and the third inequality is due to
the IR constraint. Hence, if the IR constraint of type θ1 EV is
guaranteed, then the IR constraints of EVs with higher types
are automatically satisfied.
Step 2 (IC Constraints Elimination): We define the IC con-
straints between type θk and type θk′ , k′ ∈ {1, . . . , k − 1}, as
downward incentive constraints (DICs). Similarly, the IC con-
straints between type θk and type θk′ , k′ ∈ {k + 1, . . . ,K},
are defined as upward incentive constraints (UICs). In the fol-
lowing, we will show that both the DICs and UICs can be
reduced.
We consider three adjacent EV types, i.e., θk−1 < θk < θk+1,
which satisfy
θk+1m(Rk+1)− γLk+1 ≥ θk+1m(Rk)− γLk (13)
θkm(Rk)− γLk ≥ θkm(Rk−1)− γLk−1 (14)
where (13) denotes the DIC between type θk+1 and type θk,
and (14) denotes the DIC between type θk and θk−1.
By combining Rk+1 ≥ Rk ≥ Rk−1, we have
θk+1m(Rk+1)− γLk+1 ≥ θk+1m(Rk−1)− γLk−1. (15)
Therefore, if the DIC between type θk+1 and θk holds, then the
DIC between θk+1 and θk−1 also holds. The DIC constraints
can be extended downward from type θk−1 to type θ1, which
are given by
θk+1m(Rk+1)− γLk+1 ≥ θk+1m(Rk−1)− γLk−1
≥ · · ·
≥ θk+1m(R1)− γL1. (16)
Thus, we demonstrate that if the DICs between adjacent
types hold, then all the DICs hold automatically. Similarly,
we can demonstrate that if the UICs between adjacent types
hold, then all the UICs hold automatically.
Based on the above analysis, the K IR constraints and
K(K − 1) IC constraints can be reduced to 1 and K − 1,
respectively. P1 is rewritten as
P2: max{Lk},{Rk}
UL({Lk}, {Rk})
s.t. C1 : θ1m(R1)− γL1 ≥ 0, (IR)
C2 : θkm(Rk−1)− γLk−1 ≤ θkm(Rk)− γLk, (IC)
C3,C4, k = 2, . . . ,K. (17)
3) Optimal Contract With Reduced Constraints: We can
prove that the objective of P2 is a concave function by check-
ing the Hessian matrix. However, convex programming cannot
be directly applied here because the constraint C2 involves the
difference of two concave functions, i.e., θkm(Rk−1)− γLk−1
and θkm(Rk) − γLk. Therefore, the CCP algorithm proposed
in [53] is adopted to solve P2, which is summarized in
Algorithm 1.

7: Update. τ := τ + 1, Rk,0[τ + 1] = R̂k[τ ]∀k ∈ K.
Until satisfying the stopping criterion (20).
Denote fk(Rk) = θkm(Rk). Since fk(Rk) is differentiable with
regards to Rk, fk(Rk) can be approximated by using its first-
order Taylor series expansion as
fk(Rk) ≈ fk
(
Rk,0[τ ]
) + ∇fk
(
Rk,0[τ ]
)(
Rk − Rk,0[τ ]
)
(18)
where Rk,0[τ ] represents the initial point at iteration τ .
Hence, the constraint C2 with the difference of two concave
functions is transformed to the difference of a concave function
and an affine function, which is written as
C̃2 : θkm(Rk−1)− γLk−1 ≤ fk
(
Rk,0[τ ]
) + ∇fk
(
Rk,0[τ ]
)
× (
Rk − Rk,0[τ ]
)
. (19)
By replacing C2 with C̃2, P2 is transformed into a convex
programming problem, and can be easily solved by using
Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. At each iteration τ ,
the local optimal solutions L̂k[τ ] and R̂k[τ ] are obtained by
solving the transformed convex problem. Then, the initial point
for Taylor series expansion at iteration τ + 1 is defined as
Rk,0[τ + 1] = R̂k[τ ]. Next, the above iteration is repeated to
derive a new local optimal solution.
The iterative process terminates until a predefined stopping
criterion is satisfied. For example, the improvement in the
social welfare is less than or equal to some positive threshold
ε, i.e.,
UL
({
L̂k[τ + 1]
}
,
{
R̂k[τ + 1]
})
− UL
({
L̂k[τ ]
}
,
{
R̂k[τ ]
})
≤ ε.
(20)
Theorem 2 (Convergence): At any iteration τ , the obtained
{L̂k[τ ]} and {R̂k[τ ]} are feasible. Furthermore, {SW}∞τ=0 is non-
decreasing, and will converge to the maximum social welfare,
i.e.,
UL
({
L̂k[τ ]
}
,
{
R̂k[τ ]
})
≤ UL
({
L̂k[τ + 1]
}
,
{
R̂k[τ + 1]
})
.

Proof: The detailed proof of Theorem 2 is omitted here. A
similar proof can be found in [53].
D. Optimal Contract Design Without Information Asymmetry
If there exists a selfish LEAG which is precisely aware of
each EV’s type, it can further increase its profit as long as each
EV only accepts the contract item designed for its own type. In
this scenario, the LEAG has to ensure that the payoff of each
EV is non-negative. Otherwise, the EVs have no incentive to
accept the contract item. To this end, the contract item has to
meet the IR constraint. Furthermore, the contract item has to
satisfy the following property.
Lemma 3: In the contract design without information asym-
metry, any contract item (Lk,Rk) ∈ C should satisfy θkm(Rk) =
γLK . That is, the payoff for any EV is zero.
Proof: Lemma 3 can be proved by contradiction. Given an
optimal contract item (Rk,Lk), if θkm(Rk)−γLk > 0, then the
LEAG can increase its utility by increasing Lk until θkm(Rk)−
γLk = 0. This contradicts with the assumption that (Lk,Rk) is
optimal.
Thus, by enforcing the utility of each EV to be zero, the
social welfare is equivalent to the utility of the LEAG. The
corresponding optimization problem is formulated as
P3: max{Lk},{Rk}
UL({Lk}, {Rk})
s.t. C1 : θkm(Rk)− γLk = 0
C2 : 0 ≤ R1 < · · · < Rk < · · · < RK
C3,C4 ∀k ∈ K. (22)
To solve (22), we have to work out the solutions of K
quadratic equations, i.e., θkm(Rk) − γLk = 0 ∀k ∈ K.
Assuming that Rk1 and Rk2 are the two solutions of the kth
quadratic equation, the optimal solution is given by
({Lk}, {Rk}) = arg max
{Rk}∈({Rk1},{Rk2})
(UL({Lk1}, {Rk1}),UL({Lk2}, {Rk2})). (23)
Lemma 4: In the contract design without information asym-
metry, for any EV type θk, k ∈ K, Rk is fixed regardless
of θk.
Proof: Substituting θkm(Rk) − γLk = 0 into (9), it can be
verified that the social welfare SW increases monotonically
with
∑K
k=1 Lk. Hence, the LEAG can increase Lk until Lk = θk.
Next, substituting Lk = θk into θkm(Rk) − γLk = 0, we have
m(Rk) = γL, which means that Rk is fixed regardless of θk.
V. EDGE COMPUTING-BASED COMPUTATIONAL
TASK OFFLOADING
A. Hierarchical Game Formulation
In order to win the block mining competition, an LEAG can
purchase edge computing services from the ESP to enlarge its
computational capability. We assume that there are N LEAGs,
and the set of LEAGs is denoted as N . The service demand
of the nth LEAG is denoted as sn. For the nth LEAG, the
successful probability of block creation, i.e., Pn, depends on
two factors: 1) its relative hash power Pn,h [54] and 2) its
block orphaning probability Pn,o [44], which are explained as
follows.
The relative hash power of the nth LEAG is defined as
the ratio of its computational power with respect to the total
computational power, i.e.,
Pn,h(sn) = sn
sn + ∑
n′∈N ,n′ �=n sn′
, n ∈ N (24)
where Pn,h > 0 and
∑
j∈N Pj,h = 1.

50 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020
Upon finding a valid proof-of-work, the nth LEAG has to
broadcast the created block to the other LEAGs in order to
reach a consensus. If the nth LEAG happens to choose a large
block which propagates slowly due to the data size, then the
block is more likely to be discarded due to the high transmis-
sion latency. Accordingly, the chance of the nth LEAG to win
the competition of block mining will be diminished. This phe-
nomenon is called orphaning [44]. By assuming that the block
propagation time follows a Poisson distribution, the orphaning
probability is given by
Pn,o = 1 − e−�t(Dn)
T (25)
where T denotes the expected block interval time, which is
10 min in Bitcoin. �t(Dn) denotes the relative propagation
time of a block with size Dn, which is defined as
�t(Dn) = t(Dn)− t(0). (26)
Here, t(Dn) is the propagation time to deliver a block with size
Dn and t(0) presents the lag of the communication channel,
i.e., the time required for delivering the block header. t(0) is
bounded by the constraint t(0) ≥ dc/c, where dc denotes the
transmission distance, and c denotes the speed of light.
Based on the approach proposed in [44], t(Dn) can be
approximated by using its first-order Taylor series expansion
around Dn = 0 as
t(Dn) ≈ t(0)+ ∇t|Dn=0 Dn (27)
where the second term of (27) is partially related to the car-
rying capacity of the communication channel. Based on the
Shannon–Hartley theorem, it can be written as ∇t|Dn=0 =
1/(G1G2), where G1 and G2 present the channel capacity
and coding gain, respectively. Hence, by taking ∇t|Dn=0 =
1/(G1G2) and (27) into (26), �t(Dn) is written as
�t(Dn) = t(Dn)− t(0) ≈ Dn
G1G2
. (28)
The successful probability of block creation, i.e., Pn, is
given by
Pn(sn) = Pn,h(sn)
(
1 − Pn,o
)
= sn
sn + ∑
n′∈N ,n′ �=n sn′
e
− Dn
G1G2T . (29)
Once the consensus process is successful, the nth LEAG
will gain a revenue which consists of two parts: 1) the reward
for its contribution to block creation Qn and 2) the transaction
fee Mn. The net revenue of the nth LEAG can be calculated
as the expected profit minus the service cost, i.e.,
Un,b(sn) = (Qn + Mn)Pn(sn)− pcsn (30)
where pc is the unit service price of edge computing.
The utility of the ESP is defined as the total revenue
obtained from service provisioning minus the operation cost,
i.e.,
UE(pc) =
∑
n∈N
pcsn − γc
∑
n∈N
sn (31)
where γc is the unit cost of service provisioning.
Owing to the dominant market position of the ESP com-
pared to LEAGs, the competitive interaction between the
ESP and LEAGs can be modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg
leader–follower game. In the first stage, the ESP is the leader
that determines the unit service price pc, and obtains the rev-
enue from LEAGs for solving the offloaded proof-of-work
puzzles. In the second stage, the LEAGs act as the fol-
lowers, and determine the service demand to be purchased.
The two-stage Stackelberg leader–follower game is formulated
as follows.
Stage 1: The service price optimization problem is solved
in the first stage, which is formulated as
P4: max
pc
UE(pc)
s.t. C5 : pc,min ≤ pc ≤ pc,max (32)
where pc,min and pc,max denote the minimum and maximum
bounds of the unit service price.
Stage 2: The service demand optimization problem is solved
in the second stage, which is formulated as
P5: max
sn
Un,b(sn)
s.t. C6 : sn,min ≤ sn ≤ sn,max (33)
where sn,min is the minimum computational resources (hash
power) required by the nth LEAG, and sn,max represents the
maximum computational resources that can be provided by the
ESP.
B. Equilibrium Analysis
The optimal price and the optimal service demands can be
derived by using the backward induction approach [24].
1) Solution of the Second-Stage Optimization Problem:
First, given a service price pc, the second-stage service demand
optimization problem P5 is solved for each LEAG. During
the service demand optimization, every LEAG competes with
each other to maximize its own relative hash power, and
thus, to maximize its successful probability of block creation.
From (24), we can observe that the relative hash power of the
nth LEAG not only depends on its strategy sn, but also depends
on the strategies of the other LEGAs, e.g., sn′ , n′ ∈ N , n′ �= n.
Therefore, the competition among N LEAGs can be modeled
as an N-player noncooperative game. Denote the optimal strat-
egy of the nth LEAG as s∗
n, and let s∗−n = {sn′, n′ ∈ N , n′ �= n}
represent the set of optimal strategies of the other LEAGs in
the set N excluding the nth LEAG. We have the following
properties.
Theorem 3 (Nash Equilibrium): The set of optimal ser-
vice demand strategies, i.e., {s∗
n, s∗−n} ∀n ∈ N , constitutes a
Nash equilibrium of the second-stage N-player noncooperative
game.
Proof: For any feasible sn, n ∈ N , we have
Un,b
(
s∗
n, s∗−n, pc
) ≥ Un,b
(
sn, s∗−n, pc
)
. (34)
Hence, {s∗
n, s∗−n} constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 4 (Nash Equilibrium Existence): A Nash equi-
librium exists in the second-stage N-player noncooperative
game.

ZHOU et al.: SECURE AND EFFICIENT V2G ENERGY TRADING IN CPSs: INTEGRATION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND EDGE COMPUTING 51
Proof: Based on [55], a Nash equilibrium exists if the
following two conditions are satisfied.
1) {sn, n ∈ N } is a nonempty compact convex subset of a
Euclidean space.
2) Un,b(sn) is continuous and quasi concave with regards
to sn.
First, for any n ∈ N , the strategy space [sn,min, sn,max] is
a convex, continuous, compact, and nonempty subset of the
Euclidean space, which satisfies the first condition.
Second, the second-order derivative of (30) with regards to
sn is given by
∂2Un,b

n′∈N ,n′ �=n sn′
(

)3
< 0. (36)
This proves that Un,b(sn) is concave with regards to sn.
Therefore, a Nash equilibrium exists in the second-stage
N-player noncooperative game.
Theorem 5 (Best Response): Given s∗−n, the best response
function of the nth LEAG, i.e., Bn(s∗−n), is given by (38).
Proof: Since Un,b(sn) is concave with regards to sn and
C6 is affine, P5 is a standard convex programming problem.
By setting the first-order derivative of (30) to zero, i.e.,
(∂Un,b/∂sn) = 0, we have

Proof: The Nash equilibrium is unique if the best response
function of any LEAG, e.g., Bn(s∗−n) ∀n ∈ N , is a standard
function. Based on [55], Bn(s∗−n) is a standard function if the
following conditions are satisfied.
1) Positivity: Bn(s∗−n) > 0.
2) Monotonicity: If s∗−n ≥ s̃∗−n, then Bn(s∗−n) ≥ Bn(s̃∗−n).
3) Scalability: For all ψ > 1, ψBn(s∗−n) > Bn(ψs∗−n).
First, to prove positivity, we have to prove that
Bn
(
s∗−n
) = s∗−n > 0. (40)
By setting (∂Un,b/∂sn) = (Qn + Mn)(∂Pn,h/∂sn)

Hence, the best response function of any LEAG is a standard
function and the Nash equilibrium is unique.
2) Solution of the First-Stage Optimization Problem: Based
on the optimal service demand strategies of all the LEAGs
obtained in the second stage, the first-stage service price
optimization problem can be solved. By substituting the Nash
equilibrium of the second-stage N-player noncooperative game
into (31), the utility of the ESP UE can be written as

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we validate the proposed scheme via
simulations.
A. Contract Feasibility and Social Welfare
We consider a parking lot with one LEAG and K = 20
EVs. We assume that the EV type follows a Gaussian dis-
tribution. For any EV, the battery capacity is 24 kWh, and
the unit discharging cost is 10 cents/kWh, i.e., γ = 10. The
unit revenue of electricity for the LEAG is 13 cents/kWh,
i.e., γL = 13. The contract without information asymmetry
and the linear-pricing scheme studied in [38] are utilized for
the purpose of comparison. In the linear-pricing scheme, the
LEAG does not distinguish EVs by their types, and offers a
unified price ρ to all the EVs. There exists a linear relationship
between the reward and discharged electricity, e.g., Rk = ρLk,
k = 1, . . . ,K.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the discharged electricity and the
reward, respectively. It is observed that both the reward and
the discharged electricity increase monotonically with the
EV type, which follows Lemma 2. Furthermore, numerical
results show that the contract without information asymmetry
demands much higher amounts of electricity from EVs, but
offers EVs with the same reward, which is consistent with
Lemma 4. In the linear-pricing scheme, the amount of dis-
charged electricity is lower than the other schemes, which
represents that the unified pricing scheme cannot effectively
motivate EVs to participate in the energy trading.
Fig. 2(c) shows the relationship between utilities of type 4,
type 8, and type 12 EV and contract items. It is validated
that the proposed contract is incentive compatible. An EV can
achieve its maximum utility if and only if it selects the con-
tract item dedicated for its type. Furthermore, we can observe
that the utility of EV increases with the EV type, which is
explained in Lemma 2.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the utility of the LEAG and the
utilities of EVs, respectively. Without information asymmetry,
the LEAG can achieve a much higher utility, while the utility
of any EV remains zero, which is consistent of Lemma 3.
Thus, the presence of information asymmetry actually protects
EVs from over-exploitation since the precise knowledge of
EV type is unknown to the LEAG. The linear-pricing scheme

achieves the worst performance since the type of EV has not
been fully exploited.
Fig. 3(c) shows the relationship between social welfare and
EV type. The contract without information asymmetry per-
forms worse than the contract with information asymmetry.
The reason is that under complete information, the utility
of any EV is exactly zero, which significantly decreases the
social welfare. The linear-pricing scheme achieves the lowest

social welfare because the information of EV type has been
neglected.
Fig. 4 shows the convergence performance of the proposed
CCP-based solution. Three initial points, i.e., {Rk,0[1]} =
12, 10, and 9 are chosen to characterize the impact of
initial point on the convergence speed. As the iteration num-
ber increases, all the three cases converge to the optimal
social welfare. Particularly, the case with {Rk,0[1]} = 12
only requires ten iterations to reach convergence. The rea-
son is that 12 is closest to the average value of the
optimal rewards shown in Fig. 2(b) (which is 12.66).
In comparison, the case with {Rk,0[1]} = 9 requires more than
200 iterations.
B. Edge Computing-Based Computational Task Offloading
To verify the benefits brought by edge computing, we con-
sider two cases with four and eight LEAGs, i.e., N = 4
and N = 8, respectively. In the case of N = 4, we assume
that edge computing service is not available to the first three
LEAGs, and we fix their computational power as 10, 20, and
30, respectively. Meanwhile, we assume that the fourth LEAG
can purchase service from the ESP and vary its purchased
service demand to demonstrate the impact on the successful
probability of block creation. In the case of N = 8, the compu-
tational power of the first seven LEAGs is fixed in the range
[10, 40]. The conventional scheme without the assistance of
edge computing is used for comparison [30]. We assume that
Dn follows a normal distribution, i.e., N (μDn , σ
2
Dn
), where
μDn = 200 and σ 2
Dn
= 10.
Fig. 5 shows the successful probability versus the pur-
chased service demand. When the service demand purchased
from the ESP is 55, simulation results demonstrate that
the successful probability of the proposed edge computing-
based scheme outperforms that of the conventional scheme
by 92.4% and 124.6% in the cases of N = 4 and N = 8,
respectively. The reason is that the relative computational
power of the LEAG which has access to edge computing
services can be increased by orders of magnitudes compared
to those LEAGs which only rely on their local computational
power.
Fig. 6 shows the total service demand, the profit of the ESP,
and the average profit of the LEAG versus the transaction
fee Mn. The simulation parameters are sn,min = 90, sn,max =
210, pc,min = 0, pc,max = 15, Qn = 12000, γc = 3, G1 = 50,
G2 = 4, and N = 50. Fig. 6(a) and (b) demonstrates that both
the total service demand and the profit of the ESP increase
monotonically with the transaction fee. The reason behind is
that the increased transaction fee provides a larger incentive
for LEAGs to purchase more services from the ESP. This not
only improves the successful probability of LEAGs but also
increases the profit of the ESP. Furthermore, it is observed that
both the total service demand and the profit of the ESP increase
monotonically with the block creation reward Qn, which is
also due to the fact that a higher reward provides a greater
motivation for LEAGs to buy more services.
Fig. 6(c) shows the average profit of the nth LEAG achieved
by four different schemes: 1) the proposed scheme; 2) the
conventional scheme without edge computing; 3) the aggres-
sive scheme in which the nth LEAG always purchases the
maximum amount of services sn,max; and 4) the conser-
vative scheme in which the nth LEAG always purchases
the minimum amount of services sn,min. It is clear that
the proposed scheme outperforms the other three heuris-
tic schemes because the LEAG’s strategy is optimized with
regards to the transaction fee. When the transaction fee
is low, the conservative scheme performs better than the
aggressive scheme. It is not worth to buy more services
because the expected profit cannot compensate the cost of
purchasing services. In comparison, when the transaction
fee is high enough, the LEAG should purchase a larger
amount of services to increase the chance of winning because
the expected profit is much higher than the service cost.
Under all scenarios, the conventional scheme without edge
computing performs the worst due to the reason explained
in Fig. 5.
C. Privacy and Security Analysis
In this section, we provide the privacy and the security
analysis.
1) Anonymity: Instead of using its true identity, each EV
uses a unique public key to communicate with others, which

ZHOU et al.: SECURE AND EFFICIENT V2G ENERGY TRADING IN CPSs: INTEGRATION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND EDGE COMPUTING 55
prevents malicious attackers from tracking an EV’s identity.
Furthermore, an EV can change its public key after each trans-
action to avoid the linking attack, i.e., the different pieces
of data belonging to the same EV are linked together to
deanonymize the EV.
2) Authentication: In the process of proof-of-work, every
transaction has to be publicly audited and authenticated by
authorized LEAGs. It is impossible to compromise all of the
authorized LEAGs in the network.
3) Integrity: Once a block has been appended into the
blockchain, it contains the hash of the previous block, and
its own hash will be contained in the subsequent block.
Therefore, it is infeasible to modify the block unless the
majority of the computational power are controlled by a mali-
cious attacker. Moreover, the transaction data contained in a
block are encrypted with asymmetric encryption techniques. It
takes a tremendous cost to decrypt the encrypted data without
knowing the private key.
4) Transparency: Since the blockchain technology is open
source, any user, software developer, and service provider can
have access to the blockchain and monitor the corresponding
transaction data. That is, the transaction data are not saved
in one single node and are transparent to all entities. As a
result, any malicious data modification can be noticeable and
traceable.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a secure and efficient V2G
energy trading framework for CPSs by combining blockchain,
edge computing, and contract theory. Specifically, a contract-
based incentive mechanism was developed to motivate EVs
to participate in energy trading, and the energy trading
between EVs and LEAGs is secured by exploiting consor-
tium blockchain. Furthermore, an edge computing-based task
offloading mechanism was proposed to relieve the computa-
tion burden of LEAGs and increase the successful probabil-
ity of block creation. The numerical results and theoretical
analysis show that the proposed framework achieves good
performance in terms of contract feasibility, task offloading,
and security. Some important conclusions are summarized as
follows.
First, the proposed framework enables efficient energy
trading under information asymmetry. The asymmetric
information of EV type can be effectively elicited by the
incentive-compatible contract, i.e., an EV’s type is auto-
matically revealed by observing its selection of contract
items. Second, the CCP-based contract optimization algorithm
can effectively maximize the expected utility of the LEAG.
However, the determination of initial point has a significant
impact on the convergence performance of CCP. Thus, how to
select initial point to increase the convergence speed requires
further investigation. Third, the successful probability of block
creation can be effectively improved by utilizing edge comput-
ing. Simulation results demonstrate that the successful proba-
bility can be increased by 124.6% with the presence of eight
LEAGs.
In future works, we will investigate the more complicated
scenario where even the statistical knowledge of the EV type is
unknown, and study how to leverage machine learning-based
approaches to infer the corresponding knowledge.
