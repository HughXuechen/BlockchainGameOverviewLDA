Abstract 
Inquiry-based Learning is an efficient learning method. This method is applied in 
many science courses. It is a research-oriented method which awakens personal 
curiosity of learners. Learners are motivated intrinsically, and they learn by research. 
Wide research areas can be investigated using Inquiry-based Learning. It can be 
applied to all learning areas. In the literature, Inquiry-based Learning is applied to 
science education. In this paper, Inquiry-based Learning is applied to a software 
engineering course. The application is novel because the area is a non-science area. 
Cryptocurrencies, which are applications of blockchain technologies, are selected as 
the research area. Research is done by students freely. Results of research are 
combined and shared among students. Students are assessed. Inquiry-based 
Learning is applied in a least structured way. In other words, open Inquiry-based 
Learning is applied. To empower it, gamification is used. A methodology for open 
Inquiry-based Learning is presented. The effect of gamification is measured.

1. Introduction 
Learning can start with questions. In fact, this method of learning is used by scientists 
implicitly. This method is effective because personal curiosity awakens and motivates 
learning. The method can be used in all areas of learning, and it is known as Inquiry-based 
Learning (IBL). IBL enhances student engagement, self-confidence, learning performance, and 
research skills. 
IBL is well-suited for science education because IBL depends on research. However, it can be 
applied to all areas. In this work, IBL is applied to a software engineering course in a least 
structured way. In other words, open IBL is applied to the course. IBL is an active process 
because learners act as scientists. Learners control their learning process. The control is at the 
maximum level in open IBL. 
Real-world problems are good candidates for IBL. However, implementation of real-world 
problems is not easy in classroom settings. Therefore, simulations of real-world problems can 
be used in IBL. Moreover, tools, frameworks, and environments can be designed and used. In 
this work, a developing area in computer science is used for IBL. Blockchain technologies are 
new and attractive for many people. In that area, there are numerous cryptocurrencies, and 
this is an interesting area for research. 
Using game elements in applications is called gamification. In learning, gamification can also 
be used to increase motivation. IBL and gamification are merged in many applications. Game 
elements are employed in different stages of IBL. IBL supports learning performance. 
Gamification supports learning performance. Usage of both doubles learning performance. In

the paper, open IBL is employed in the blockchain research area. Since open IBL is less 
structured, its implementation is more problematic than other IBL implementations. 
Gamification can be used to calibrate open part of the IBL. 
In this work, open IBL is applied in a software engineering course. The course is about 
blockchain technologies. Blockchain technologies are closely related to cryptography 
(Antonopoulos 2017). Cryptocurrencies are implementations of blockchain technologies. In 
the paper, cryptocurrency area is investigated in an open IBL approach. The open IBL approach 
is strengthened with gamification. This is a novel approach because open IBL is applied to 
technological data. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, related work is given. Then, 
the methodology is described. In the following sections, applications of the methodology and 
results are presented. Lastly, discussion and conclusion are stated. 
2. Related Work 
People learn and adapt to environment. Learning is a very important activity in life. Therefore, 
efficient learning mechanisms are valuable for humankind. If learners manage their learning 
activities, learning may become more efficient and effective. This type of learning is known as 
Self-regulated Learning (SRL) (Kravcik and Klamma 2012). One type of SRL is IBL 
(Mikroyannidis, Okada, and Scott 2013). In IBL, learning is initiated by questions, and learners 
act like scientists. IBL triggers personal curiosity of learners. Learners gather information, 
develop ideas, make discoveries, and build knowledge (Levy and Petrulis 2012). Hence, they 
contribute to their personal development. IBL is not a teacher-centered approach. On the 
contrary, it is a learner-centered approach (Gormally et al. 2009). Learners gain self-
confidence and improve research skills (Kienzler and Fontanesi 2017). 
In Spronken-Smith (2012), a review on IBL can be found. Student engagement, higher-order 
learning outcomes, and academic achievement can be improved by IBL. IBL combines teaching 
and research. IBL increases interaction and enjoyment. In Spronken-Smith (2012), key 
attributes of IBL are determined. Learning is an active approach and is stimulated by inquiry. 
IBL is a learner-centered approach where learning is self-directed. Examples of IBL show that 
it can be applied at all stages of the disciplines of higher education. IBL usage in numerous 
disciplines of higher education is reported in Aditomo et al. (2013). The usage ranges from 
small to large classes in undergraduate and graduate programs where research is intensive or 
not. In Pedaste et al. (2015), core features of IBL are identified in a systematic literature 
review. At the beginning, all the phases and sub-phases of IBL are determined. Afterwards, 
required features are identified for the phases. As a result, a synthesized framework is 
provided for the whole IBL process. 
In Spronken-Smith et al. (2011), cases of IBL are reviewed to determine the factors that affect 
its usage. The attributes of teachers, course designs, departments and institutes are identified 
for effective use of IBL. IBL is well suited for real-world problems. Scientists study real-world 
problems and learn through their research. Likewise, learners in IBL act as researchers and 
learn the subjects. However, implementation of real-world problems is difficult in education. 
Therefore, simulations of real-world problems are employed to apply IBL. In Tsai (2018), an 
electricity problem from daily life is simulated and used in IBL. In Buckner and Kim (2014), 
students are engaged with real-world problems through simulations. 
In Hsu, Lai, and Hsu (2015), scaffolding in IBL is discussed. Three versions of scaffolding are 
compared. The goal-oriented one is more effective than teacher-led and deconstructed 
versions of scaffolding. The key features of goal-oriented scaffolding are an advanced

organizer, deconstruction of complex tasks and evaluation of the process. In Dorier and García 
(2013), a large-scale implementation of IBL is analyzed to determine conditions to use IBL 
effectively. The analysis is organized in four levels: discipline, pedagogy, school, and society. 
In Madhuri, Kantamreddi, and Prakash Goteti (2012), a laboratory course in engineering 
chemistry is designed using IBL approach. The results show a significant improvement in 
learning performance. In Panasan and Nuangchalerm (2010), IBL and project-based learning 
are compared in the fields of learning achievement, analytical thinking and science process 
skills. Results show that both are effective and efficient. In Gormally et al. (2009), IBL is applied 
in a lab course. Science literacy and research skills of students are improved greatly. 
Learning environments are created with tools to enhance learning performance. Learners can 
completely control their learning using learning environments. In Mikroyannidis, Okada, and 
Scott (2013), a learning environment is introduced to improve IBL. In the learning 
environment, students learn to collaborate and investigate. In Tsai (2018), a computer-
simulated environment is developed to do scientific inquiry for IBL. The environment has 
positive effects on learners to increase their knowledge significantly. In Levy, Aiyegbayo, and 
Little (2009), a learning activity management system is used to create learning designs for IBL. 
Teachers or students can create learning designs for knowledge creation. In Apedoe and 
Reeves (2006), digital libraries are used to design and implement IBL in courses. Digital 
libraries support intellectual curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Students build 
different interpretations of real-world data using digital libraries. In Buckner and Kim (2014), 
a framework is presented to integrate information and communications technologies with IBL 
in classroom settings. The effectiveness of the framework is tested in various countries. In 
Oliver (2008), a web-based tool is developed to support IBL. The tool is characterized by 
meaningful contexts, feedback, strong learning scaffolds, support, and efficient 
administration. The tool increases problem-solving experiences of students and supports 
student engagement. In Mulder, Lazonder, and De Jong (2014), a computer simulation is used 
to create models by consulting heuristic worked examples. Heuristic worked examples 
enhance models created for IBL. In Maaß and Doorman (2013), a complex model for IBL is 
presented for large-scale implementation. The model is used to change ordinary teaching in 
various contexts. 
IBL can be described as a workflow (Pedaste et al. 2015). The workflow has 5 distinct phases. 
It starts with orientation and ends with discussion. In between, there are conceptualization, 
investigation, and conclusion phases. Conceptualization, investigation, and discussion phases 
can also be divided into sub-phases. Discussion phase can be present at any time through the 
workflow as well as at the end of the workflow. 
Gamification is the usage of game elements in applications (Alhammad and Moreno 2018). 
Gamification can be applied to IBL. In Dicheva et al. (2015), a review is made on the application 
of gamification to education. The effectiveness of game elements in education is examined. 
Which game elements are effective in which educational contexts are reviewed. In 
Mikroyannidis, Okada, and Scott (2013), virtual badges are rewarded to students in personal 
learning environments. Students get badges when they reach certain milestones in the 
workflow. Virtual badges shared in social networks increase student motivation. In Gao, 
Fabricatore, and Lopez (2019), game elements used in IBL are reviewed. Various game 
elements are used to support core features of IBL. Learning process, environment creation, 
and progressive guidance are empowered. In Tsai (2018), the IBL environment is supported 
with game elements such as points and story. Game elements are used to increase the intrinsic 
motivation of students (Garris, Ahlers, and Driskell 2002). In this work, gamification is used to 
Gamification of Open Inquiry-based Learning of Blockchain Technologies

U.Porto Journal of Engineering, 8:1 (2022) 12-22 15 
strengthen IBL in the application to a software engineering course. In Zion et al. (2004), the 
dynamic nature of IBL is investigated. Learning is a process where changes occur during 
research. In this work, gamification is applied in an iterative way, which yields changes in each 
iteration. 
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets based on blockchain technology (Härdle, Harvey, and Reule 
2018). Currently, there are 3589 cryptocurrencies ("CoinMarketCap", n.d.). In Marella et al. 
(2020), the underlying technological attributes of cryptocurrencies, which drive trust, are 
analyzed based on Bitcoin. The two properties, immutability and openness, are unique to 
cryptocurrencies compared to traditional financial instruments. Openness drives 
transparency, and immutability drives accountability. Transparency is the main element for 
creation of trust. In Irresberger et al. (2021), an empirical overview is provided for 
cryptocurrencies. Why a few cryptocurrencies dominate the market is analyzed based on a 
framework. The key elements of the framework are scale, security, and adoption. A review of 
the market for cryptocurrencies can be found in Corbet et al. (2019). In Li et al. (2019), 
characteristics of cryptocurrencies are presented using a representative set of 
cryptocurrencies. Technical and business characteristics are provided for practitioners. An 
important technical characteristic is consensus algorithm. Proof of Work (PoW), Practical 
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the mostly used consensus 
algorithms. In Li and Whinston (2020), features of cryptocurrencies and their economic 
implications are investigated. The three cryptocurrencies which are Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP 
are used in the investigation because they have the highest market values. The differences 
among the cryptocurrencies are extracted according to their identity management, coin 
supply, and consensus algorithms. In this work, the richness of cryptocurrencies enabled it to 
become the research area for open IBL implementation. 
IBL is a student-centered approach, and it is directed by students. In the process, teachers 
guide students. The guidance level of students differs in versions of IBL. Guidance can be in 4 
levels (Gao, Fabricatore, and Lopez 2019). These levels determine types of IBL. In open IBL, 
guidance is at minimum level, and students guide themselves. Students build research 
questions, define inquiry methods, and execute the IBL process. In guided IBL, while teachers 
provide research questions, methods are determined and executed by students. In structured 
IBL, teachers provide methods as well as research questions. Students carry out research. In 
confirmation IBL, students are guided in all stages of the process. IBL is implemented in science 
courses. In this work, open IBL is applied to a software engineering course, which is a non-
science course. Implementation of open IBL is difficult because there is minimum guidance by 
teachers. For this purpose, gamification is used to empower open IBL. 
3. The Methodology 
Open IBL is applied using a methodology to a software engineering course. The methodology 
is depicted in Figure 1. Prediction is at the center of the methodology. First, students do their 
research. Then, findings are collected, shared, and predictions are made. Finally, assessment 
is realized. These phases are repeated a few times as cycles. Throughout the cycles, 
gamification is applied using game elements. Each cycle is also a game element “competition”.

Figure 1: Methodology 
A competition has 3 phases as the following: 
 Phase 1: Research Phase 
 Phase 2: Prediction Phase 
 Phase 3: Assessment Phase 
At the base of the methodology, there are questions and answers to those questions. In other 
words, question-answer pairs are extracted through research, and they form knowledge to be 
shared. The aim of the methodology is to find the best question-answer pairs. For this 
purpose, rules are determined at the beginning of the methodology. The rules are called 
qualification rules. Qualification rules should motivate students to extract the best question-
answer pairs in the research area. 
At the beginning of the methodology, the research area and the qualification rules are 
determined: 
 Research area is determined 
 Qualification rules are arranged 
In this work, the research area is cryptocurrencies. Qualification rules are arranged to 
maximize the quality of questions. In the research phase, a different subject is assigned to 
each student. Each student prepares a few qualified questions according to the qualification 
rules. They also prepare their answers. According to the quality of questions, students are 
graded. Therefore, students are motivated to prepare perfect questions. In the prediction 
phase, the prepared questions and answers are collected and shared with other students. 
Each student predicts the questions which will be asked in the assessment phase. The 
predictions are made according to the qualification rules determined at the beginning of 
gamification. The qualification rules are used to measure the quality of questions. The 
predictions are considered in the classes and discussed with students. Correct predictions are 
the sources of game elements “points” and “leaderboard”. Each student can follow his/her 
points and his/her rank on the leaderboard. In the assessment phase, an exam is arranged 
with selected questions. Questions are selected according to the qualification rules by the 
teacher. 
In Table 1, competitions and cryptocurrencies are shown. In the course, there are 11 
registered students. Gamification is applied in 3 competitions. For each competition, 2 
cryptocurrencies are determined for each student. Cryptocurrencies are categorized as X-
category and Y-category cryptocurrencies.

Gamification is applied in the methodology, and its effect on learning is measured. For this 
purpose, a control group is formed. Actually, the control group is not formed in students. The 
research area is divided randomly into two groups as experimental and control groups. X-
category of the cryptocurrencies is the experimental group, whereas Y-category of the 
cryptocurrencies is the control group. Gamification is applied to only X-category 
cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the learning performance of X-category compared to Y-category 
shows the effect of gamification in learning. 
Each student will prepare 2 questions for the assigned cryptocurrencies in each competition. 
Answers to the questions will also be prepared. Each competition has 3 phases. Each phase 
will last for 1 week. The details of the phases are the following: 
Phase 1: Research Phase 
 Each student will prepare 2 questions about each of the assigned cryptocurrency. 
 Each question will be graded with the following qualification rules: 
o Question should be related to the assigned cryptocurrency. 
o Question should be related to an interesting property of the assigned 
cryptocurrency. 
o Answer should be correct. 
o Question should be short. 
o Answer should be short. 
In the Research Phase, students prepare question-answer pairs for the assigned 
cryptocurrencies. In other words, for each competition, there are 2*n question-answer pairs, 
where n is the number of students. Of these pairs, n pairs are in X-category and the other n 
pairs are in Y-category. These 2*n question-answer pairs are shared before the Prediction 
Phase. At this time, students do not know these 2*n question-answers are correct or not. 
However, they should select 5 question-answer pairs from X-category questions, which will be 
asked in the exam of the competition. 
Phase 2: Prediction Phase 
 In the Assessment Phase, an exam will be conducted. In the exam, there will be 5 
questions from X-category and 5 questions from Y-category. 
 The students will make predictions from X-category cryptocurrencies according to the 
qualification rules. 
Gamification of Open Inquiry-based Learning of Blockchain Technologies 
Davut Çulha 
U.Porto Journal of Engineering, 8:1 (2022) 12-22 18 
 Each student will predict 5 questions from X-category cryptocurrencies. Each student 
will predict which questions can be asked in the exam. If all predictions are realized, the 
student will get full points from this phase. If some of them are realized, the student will 
take points proportionally. 
In the Prediction Phase, students do their predictions on only X-category question-answer 
pairs. In other words, they do predictions on gamified cryptocurrencies. They will attend the 
exam in the Assessment Phase without knowing the correctness of the questions and answers. 
In the exam, the best questions will be asked according to the predetermined qualification 
rules. These rules are known by the students. 
Phase 3: Assessment Phase 
 In the Assessment Phase, an exam will be conducted. In the exam, there will be 5 
questions from X-category and 5 questions from Y-category. 
 The questions will be selected according to the qualification rules by the teacher. 
 The most interesting questions will be selected. In other words, there can be 2 
questions, 1 question or 0 questions from each cryptocurrency. 
Students attend to the exam without knowing the correctness of the questions and the 
answers. They are responsible for all the 2*n questions. After the Assessment Phase, the asked 
question-answer pairs are discussed in the class. 
4. Experimental Results 
Open IBL is applied in the course SE427 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Technologies. The 
course is a technical elective course and is taught in Software Engineering Department at 
Atilim University. The course is composed of midterm, final, project and assignments. Open 
IBL is used for the assignment part of the course. Table 2 shows the competition results. 11 
students did research about given cryptocurrencies in competitions. The column P under the 
heading competition shows the number of correct predictions of students in the related 
competition. Column X under the heading competition shows the exam results for X-category 
cryptocurrencies. Similarly, column Y shows the exam results of Y-category cryptocurrencies. 
Under the heading total, the predictions and exam results are summed. The last column shows 
the proportion of X and Y columns. In other words, it is the division of X-category exam results 
with the Y-category exam results.

Table 2: Competition Results 
Gamification of Open Inquiry-based Learning of Blockchain Technologies 
Davut Çulha 
U.Porto Journal of Engineering, 8:1 (2022) 12-22 19 
In each competition, an exam was made. There are 5 X-category questions and 5 Y-category 
questions. In other words, there are 5 gamified questions and 5 non-gamified questions. Each 
question is 10 points so that each exam is over 100. Each student can take at most 50 from X-
category (column X) and at most 50 from Y-category (column Y). For example, Student 05 did 
2 correct predictions in the first competition, and he/she took 45 points from X-category and 
40 points from the Y-category. After 3 competitions, he/she obtained 120 points form X-
category and 85 points from Y-category with totally 3 correct predictions. He/she got better 
points from X-category. If it is compared with Y-category, the proportion 1.41 is found. This 
shows the dominance of X-category in the grades. 
Open IBL is applied to the course. In order to determine the effect of gamification, 
gamification is applied to only X-category cryptocurrencies. The Y-category cryptocurrencies 
are not gamified. In other words, students made their predictions for X-category 
cryptocurrencies. 
In each competition, 5 questions from X-category cryptocurrencies and 5 questions from Y-
category cryptocurrencies are asked in the assessment phase. Students predict 5 questions 
from X-category cryptocurrencies. Predictions are discussed in classes with students to 
motivate them. 
The result column shows the average proportion of X-category and Y-category exam results. 
Gamification is applied to only X-category. Therefore, the result column shows the effect of 
gamification in learning. According to the results, gamification affects learning performance 
23% better. 
5. Discussion 
The application of open IBL has lasted for 9 weeks. During this period, predictions are 
discussed in the classes to increase student engagement. Students did their research. 
Moreover, they also did research about other cryptocurrencies because they wanted to check 
whether those questions were correct or not. In this way, they tried to understand properties 
of other cryptocurrencies. Their learning efficiency was increased. 
In the experiment, although the number of students is small, the effect of gamification 
highlights itself. In future studies, it is better to repeat the experiment with an increased 
number of students. In the methodology, the control group is not formed in students. Instead, 
the research area is divided into two groups. A similar approach may be applied to other 
application areas. Another limitation of the work is that it is applied to undergraduate 
engineering students. The proposed methodology may be applied to other groups with 
different profiles. 
Usual applications of IBL are in science courses. Science courses are related to nature. Like 
scientists, students do research on nature. Each research is interesting because there are 
plenty of things for research in nature. On the other side, technology is growing exponentially. 
Currently, it creates plenty of data. In the future, research on technological data will increase 
very much, and their research will be similar to the current nature research. Actually, this work 
is a step of future research on technological data. 
6. Conclusion 
IBL increases learning performance. In this work, IBL is applied to a software engineering 
course. The course is related to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Cryptocurrency 
technology is a suitable and wide area for research. There are numerous cryptocurrencies. In 
the course, cryptocurrencies are investigated using IBL. Since the research area is fairly wide, 
open IBL is well-suited. In open IBL, all the questions are determined and investigated by 
Gamification of Open Inquiry-based Learning of Blockchain Technologies

U.Porto Journal of Engineering, 8:1 (2022) 12-22 20 
students. However, this flexibility may cause students to go out of discipline. Therefore, 
gamification is used to calibrate the flexibility as well as to increase learning performance. 
Briefly, open IBL is applied to a non-science area using gamification. 
For the gamification of open IBL, a methodology is presented. The methodology depends on 
predictions. It uses 3 game elements as competition, points and leaderboard. In gamification, 
3 competitions are realized. In each competition, research, prediction, and assessment phases 
are passed. In the research phase, students do their research. In the prediction phase, 
students check other research and try to predict the best research. Correct predictions provide 
points to students, and students follow their ranks in the leaderboard. In the assessment 
phase, students are assessed with selected questions. The predictions and selections of 
questions are made according to the predetermined qualification rules. Briefly, a gamification 
methodology for open IBL is presented. 
IBL is applied to science courses. In this work, open IBL is applied to a software engineering 
course using gamification. In order to measure the effect of gamification in the application, 
half of the research area is not gamified instead of grouping of students. At the assessment 
phases, gamified and non-gamified parts of the research area are assessed in the exams. 
According to the assessments, gamification increases learning performance in open IBL. 
Moreover, students do more research in open IBL because they need to check the correctness 
of other research. Therefore, student engagement is increased.
