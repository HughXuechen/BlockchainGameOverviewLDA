Abstract—The world-changing blockchain technique provides
a novel method to establish a secure, trusted, and decentralized
system for solving the security and personal privacy problems in
the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As the mining process
in blockchain requires high computational power, the lightweight
IoT devices need to purchase computational resources from edge
servers and thus can offload their computational tasks. The
amount of computational resource purchased by IoT devices
depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process,
and will directly affect the security of the blockchain network.
The security of the blockchain is closely related to the profits of
the blockchain platform. Actually, there is a trade-off between
blockchain security and the profits of the blockchain platform. In
this paper, we investigate the incentive mechanism for the
blockchain platform to attract IoT devices to purchase more
computational power from edge servers to participate in the
mining process, thereby building a secure blockchain network
while guaranteeing the profits of the blockchain platform. We
model the interaction between the blockchain platform and IoT
devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain
platform act as the leader, and IoT devices act as followers.
We analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg
equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the
Stackelberg equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations, and
analyze the strategies of the blockchain platform and IoT devices
under different situations.

I. INTRODUCTION
CURRENTLY, Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted more
and more attention in many areas, such as smart cities,
agriculture, health care, industry, etc. Especially in the smart
factory area [1], IoT provides interconnection to smart factories
by connecting different types of industrial machines and devi-
ces, which helps to realize intelligent manufacturing. To deal
with the huge number of IoT devices, a traditional centralized
architecture is applied to provide services for IoT devices,
where IoT devices are connected to a cloud server through the
internet. With the rapid growth of the number of IoT devices
and the performance requirement of the IoT applications, how-
ever, the traditional centralized IoT architecture faces many
challenges, such as security, personal privacy, bandwidth con-
straint, and service delay [2]. To avoid these issues, some works
introduce decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures for
IoT applications [3]–[5], where each device can exchange
information or trade directly with other devices without a third-
party organization. However, these P2P architectures are still
faced with security and personal privacy issues.
In the past few years, the world-changing technology,
blockchain, provides an effective way to solve the above
issues, due to its inherent security and privacy protection prop-
erties, and has been widely used in IoT applications [6]–[9].
There are many types of blockchains based on different con-
sensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of
Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In this paper, we consider
that the PoW consensus mechanism is adopted when con-
structing an IoT blockchain. The reason is that PoW is by far
the most mature consensus mechanism, which has been veri-
fied on the Bitcoin system [10] for years. While PoS is
affected by the Matthew effect, where the rich get richer phe-
nomenon will happen [11]; PBFT has poor scalability and
high latency [12]; DAG-based blockchain is vulnerable to
double-spending attacks [13], and facing the threat of spam
attacks and denial of service attacks [14]. Under the PoW con-
sensus mechanism, participants (miners) of the blockchain
need to compete with each other to solve a hash puzzle, which
is very costly to get the right answer but easy to be validated.
The winner has the right to generate a new block and will get
a reward from the blockchain platform (the process is called
mining). However, PoW consumes too much computing
resources, which prevents IoT devices from directly joining
the construction of the blockchain. Fortunately, the edge com-
puting architecture makes it possible for IoT applications to
establish a blockchain network, where IoT devices can offload
the computational tasks to edge servers [15]–[18]. Specifi-
cally, incentivized by the reward from the platform for packet-
ing a new block, each IoT device will purchase a certain
amount of computational resources (such as CPU and GPU)
from edge servers to participate in the mining process for max-
imizing its own profit.

For the blockchain platform, one of the most important
property is security. A more secure blockchain network will
attract more IoT devices to join in, thereby generating more
transactions. The blockchain platform charges a certain trans-
action fee for each transaction. Therefore, the security of the
blockchain network is closely related to its benefits. The better
the security, the more the benefits got by the platform. For the
blockchain with the PoW consensus mechanism, its security
mainly depends on the total computational power of the entire
network. An attacker who wants to tamper with the context in
a block of the blockchain needs to solve the hash puzzle faster
than the current whole network. Thus, it’s much harder for
attackers to modify the blocks if all miners provide more
computational power for the blockchain network. The block-
chain platform will give a reward to those who generate a new
block, so as to attract IoT devices (miners) to purchase more
computational resources from edge servers. If the reward is
too small, it will not attract miners to purchase enough compu-
tational resources, which will make the blockchain not suffi-
ciently secure. If the reward is too large, the cost of the
platform will increase, and the platform will get fewer profits
or even make a loss. Thus, there exists a trade-off between
blockchain security and profits of the platform.
In this paper, therefore, we study the incentive mechanism of
the blockchain platform to motivate IoT devices to purchase
more computational resources to participate in the mining pro-
cess, so that a secure blockchain network can be established
while the profits of the blockchain platform can be guaranteed.
The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows.
� By considering the trade-off between blockchain secu-
rity and profits of the platform, we design an incentive
mechanism for the IoT blockchain platform to attract
IoT devices to purchase more computational power
from edge servers. Thereby building a secure block-
chain network while guaranteeing the profits of the
blockchain platform.
� We analyze the relationship between the security of the
blockchain network and the total computational power
of the entire network, and give the probability that an
attacker can successfully tamper with the blockchain.
� We formulate the interaction between blockchain plat-
form and miners as a two-stage Stackelberg game. We
analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg
equilibrium, then propose an efficient algorithm to com-
pute the Stackelberg equilibrium point.
� We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the per-
formance of our proposed algorithm, and we analyze
the strategies of platform and miners in different situa-
tions. Our work is helpful for the IoT blockchain plat-
form to set a reasonable reward pricing strategy to
maximize its utility, which is closely related to the secu-
rity of the blockchain network.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section II, we introduce the related works of this paper. In
Section III, we describe the system model and analyze the
blockchain security that motivated our problem, and then we
formulate our problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In
Section IV, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the
Stackelberg equilibrium, and give the best strategies for min-
ers and blockchain platform. We conduct extensive perfor-
mance evaluations in Section V. And finally, we conclude this
paper in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORKS
Recently, there are numerous works that concentrate on IoT
blockchain networks. Hassan et al. [19] discuss the integration
of blockchain in a smart energy system, their work is helpful
in developing flexible blockchain platforms for the smart
energy system. Mollah et al. [20] investigate the application
of blockchain technology in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV),
they point out several key challenges in applying blockchain
in IoV, and introduce some related works for solving these
challenges. Xu et al. [21] propose a blockchain-based fair non-
repudiation network computing service provisioning scheme
for IoT, in which the blockchain is used as a service publica-
tion proxy and an evidence recorder. The massive data of IoT
applications can be stored on remote servers with network
storage technology, and it is a critical challenge to ensure the
security and integrity of the data. Some studies deal with the
challenge with blockchain technology. Xu et al. [22] propose
a blockchain-based decentralized arbitrable remote data audit-
ing scheme for network storage service, in which they use the
smart contact to solve the data possession disputes. The
authors in [23] propose a deduplicatable data auditing mecha-
nism for network storage services based on blockchain tech-
nology. Their design could meet the security requirements of
network storage services and meanwhile improve the scalabil-
ity of the system.
Moreover, there are a series of works study the blockchain
from the aspect of auction or game theory. Sun et al. [24] con-
sider a multi-task cross-server resource allocation scenario in
blockchain-based mobile edge computing, they model the
interaction between edge servers and mobile devices as a dou-
ble auction, and propose two double auction mechanisms. Yao
et al. [25] model the resource management and pricing prob-
lem as a Stackelberg game, and they design a multiagent rein-
forcement learning algorithm to search the near-optimal
policy. Jiao et al. [26] propose an auction-based market model
for the trading between the cloud computing service provider
and miners. Their purpose is to efficiently allocate computing
resources to maximize the social welfare. Wang et al. [27]
propose a blockchain and double auction mechanism-based
decentralized electricity transaction mode for microgrids, to
achieve secure and quick electricity transactions. Xiong et al.
[28] formulate the interaction between the cloud providers
and miners as a Stackelberg game, and apply backward induc-
tion to analyze the equilibria in each sub-game. Chang et al.
[29] formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game between the
edge service provider and miners, and they aim to find the
Stackelberg equilibrium under two different mining schemes.
However, most of the above works only consider the interac-
tion between the cloud servers and miners, and none of them
consider the profits brought by blockchain security from the

perspective of the blockchain platform, which is fundamen-
tally different from our work.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we first introduce the edge computing system
of the IoT blockchain network. We then analyze the security of
the blockchain network. Finally, we formulate the incentive
problem between the blockchain platform and miners.
A. System Model
In the blockchain network, the core problem is to achieve a
distributed consensus. Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the PoW
consensus protocol in 2008 which is used for Bitcoin [10]. In
the PoW consensus, the users who want to generate a new
block need to solve a hash puzzle, which is very costly to be
addressed but easy for others to verify. This process is called
mining, and these users are termed as miners. These miners
compete with each other to solve a hash puzzle, the one who
first solve the hash puzzle has the right to generate a new block
and will get a reward from the blockchain platform.
For the IoT blockchain network, the lightweight IoT devi-
ces cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the
limited computational capability. Incentivized by the reward
from the blockchain platform, IoT devices will purchase com-
putation resources from edge servers, each edge server offers
its own unit price for computational resources. As shown in
Fig. 1, the blockchain network is maintained by all of the IoT
devices. As for the mining process, each miner will offload its
computational task to the edge server to compete with others,
as shown in Fig. 2. The probability of each miner winning the
competition depends on the amount of computational resource
it purchased. All the miners purchase computational resources
with the goal of maximizing their own profits.
B. Blockchain Security
Blockchain is a list of blocks that are linked by block hash
value, and each block record a set of transactions. More spe-
cifically, a block contains two parts: block content and block
header. The block content is the details of transactions
information, which records all the inputs and outputs of each
transaction. The block header consists of the previous block
hash value, which is used as a cryptographic link that creates
the chain, a version number that used for tracking for software
or protocol updates, a timestamp that records the time at which
the block is generated, a Merkle tree root of all the transac-
tions, a hash threshold value that records the current mining
difficulty, and a nonce, which is used for solving the PoW
puzzle.
The blockchain starts with a genesis block which is given by
the blockchain platform, and all subsequent blocks will put
some previously generated block’s hash value into their block
header. Miners compete with each other to solve a hash puzzle,
the one who first solve the puzzle has the right to generate a new
block, and new blocks will be added behind the genesis block.
Forks may happen when multiple miners solve the hash puzzle
at the same time, thus each user maintains the blocks in the form
of a block tree [32]. According to the longest chain principle
[10], each user will choose the longest branch in the block tree
as the current blockchain, as shown in the left part of Fig. 3.
For a blockchain miner, to get the right to generate a new
block, it needs to solve a hash function (PoW puzzle), that is, it
needs to find a nonce and record it in the block header such that
the hash value of the block header is less than the hash thresh-
old. As the hash function has no back door, the only way to find
such a nonce is to run many hash operations. The difficulty of
the PoW puzzle is determined by the given hash threshold
value, which is a 256-bit binary number that starts with a cer-
tain number of consecutive zeros (difficulty). For example, if
the hash threshold starts with 60 consecutive zeros, the proba-
bility of finding the correct nonce by performing a hash opera-
tion is 2�60, which means that it takes an average of 260 hash
operations to solve the PoW puzzle. To stabilize the growth
rate of the blockchain, the platform will dynamically adjust the
difficulty of the PoW puzzle based on the total computational
power of the whole blockchain network. Take the bitcoin
blockchain as an example, the difficulty of the PoW puzzle will

be updated every 2 weeks to ensure that it takes 10 minutes (on
average) for the blockchain to generate a new block[33].
Assume that an attacker wants to tamper with the context of
a block, the change of the context will change the hash value
of the block, so the attacker needs to find a new nonce to solve
the PoW puzzle of this block. Moreover, as each block con-
tains the hash value of the previous block, the change of a
block context will change all the subsequent blocks, so the
attacker should find the nonce for every subsequent block. In
fact, the attacker needs to fork a new branch, and start a block
mining race against other miners of the network. The attacker
successfully tamper with the blockchain once the attacker
wins the race, as the new branch forked by the attacker
becomes the longest one in the block tree. As shown in Fig. 3.
Now we analyze the probability of success of an attacker.
Assume that the total computational power of the blockchain
network is H by the hash rate, and the attacker’s computation
power is h. Then the probability an honest miner finds the
next block can be denoted by p ¼ H�h
H , and the probability
that the attacker finds the next block is q ¼ h
H . According to
[34], the probability that the attacker will ever win the race
from z blocks behind can be calculated by

and Gð�Þ is the gamma function.
Consider that an attacker’s computational power is h ¼
1 TH=s, and he wants to tamper with the context of the 4th
block from the blockchain tip. Fig. 4 shows the probability of
the success of the attacker against the total computational
power of the network. It can be seen that as the total
computational power of the network increases, the probability
that the attacker successfully tamper with the blockchain
significantly decreases. Specifically, when H ¼ 10 TH=s,
P ð4Þ ¼ 0:387%; when H ¼ 20 TH=s, P ð4Þ ¼ 0:033%. The
probability of the success of the attacker is reduced by more
than 10 times if we double the computational power of the
entire network. The result suggests that the larger the computa-
tional power of the whole blockchain network, the harder it is
for the attacker to tamper with the blockchain, and thus the
more secure the blockchain network will be.
C. Problem Description
We first show the notations that used in our problem
description in Table I.
As described before, the blockchain platform provides cer-
tain rewards to incentivize miners to participate in the mining
process, and each miner purchase computational resources
from its nearby edge server for getting more profits.
For the blockchain platform, the revenue is mainly derived
from the transaction fees. We assume that the average transac-
tion fees in a block is B. The platform will give a reward R to
the miner who packaging a new block. Note that the reward R
should be no larger than B, otherwise the blockchain cannot
maintain perpetual operation. As discussed in Section III-B,
the total computational power will significantly affect the
blockchain security, so the blockchain platform will get benefit
from the huge computational power provided by the miners. As
shown in Fig .4, the decrease speed of the probability that an
attacker successfully tamper with the blockchain slows down
as the total computational power of the entire network
increases. Moreover, the blockchain security cannot bring
unlimited profits, and with the improvement of blockchain
security, the increase in profits will become smaller. Therefore,
we use the sigmoid function to describe the profits brought by
the total computational power of the entire network. Then we
define a utility function U to make a trade-off between block-
chain security and profits of the blockchain platform.

where S is the miners set, mi is the computational power pro-
vided by the i-th miner, sð�Þ is the sigmoid function that
defined as sðxÞ ¼ 1
1þe�x , a > 1 is a constant parameter that
controls the importance of the total computational power, and
0 < b < 1 is a constant parameter that controls the conver-
gence rate of the sigmoid function.
For the miners, consider there are a set S of IoT devices that
are interested in participating in the mining process, where
S ¼ fs1; s2; ; sng. Each miner si 2 S will purchase mi compu-
tational power from edge servers to compete with others in
pursuit of a maximum financial profit. According to the princi-
ple of the PoW consensus protocol, the speed of a miner for
solving the hash puzzle depends on the number of hash opera-
tions it can perform per unit of time, that is, its computational
power. Therefore, the miner who purchases the most computa-
tional power is most likely to solve the PoW puzzle first. We
use pi to denote the probability that miner si winning the com-
petition among all miners in solving the PoW puzzle, pi can
be defined as
pi ¼ miP
sj2S mj
: (4)
The unit price of the computational power purchased by
miners may be different, as they purchase computational
power from different edge servers. Assume that the unit price
of the computational power purchased by si is �i per day. We
also assume that the blockchain will generate an average of N
new blocks per day. Then the expected reward that miner si
can get in a day is piRN , and its cost is �imi. We use Pi to
represent the expected profit got by miner si in one day, then
Pi can be calculated as follows,
Pi ¼ piRN � �imi: (5)
Both the blockchain platform and miners will dynamically
adjust their strategies to get the maximum profit. We model
the interaction between the blockchain platform and miners as
a two-stage Stackelberg game. In the upper stage, the block-
chain platform sets the reward to incentivize miners to partici-
pate in the mining process. In the lower stage, miners decide
the optimal amount of computational power they purchase.
We formulate the optimization problems for the blockchain
platform and miners as follows.
We first introduce the lower stage of the game. Given the
reward R of the blockchain platform and other miners’ strate-
gies m�im�i, where m�im�i ¼ fm1;m2; ;mi�1;miþ1; ;mng. The miner
si decides the amount of computational power mi it purchased
to maximize its own profit. This sub-game problem can be
written as follows.
Problem 1: miners’ sub-game.

s:t: mi � 0
For the upper stage of the game, the blockchain platform
will dynamically adjust the reward R to maximize its utility.
As defined in equation (3), the utility of the blockchain plat-
form is directly related to the strategies mm of miners, where
mm ¼ fm1;m2; ;mng, and the reward R. This sub-game can be
formulated as follows.
Problem 2: blockchain platform’s sub-game.

Problem 1 and Problem 2 together form a Stackelberg
game. The object of the game is to find a Stackelberg equi-
librium point where neither the leader (blockchain platform)
nor the followers (miners) want to change their strategies.
In this paper, the Stackelberg equilibrium can be defined as
follows.
Definition 1: Let m�m� and R� be the optimal strategies of
miners and blockchain platform, respectively, where m�m� ¼
fm�1;m�2; ;m�ng. Then, the point (m�m�, R�) is the Stackelberg
equilibrium point if it satisfies the following two conditions,

IV. GAME ANALYSIS FOR THE INCENTIVE MECHANISM
In this section, we analyze the existence and the uniqueness
of the Stackelberg equilibrium of our proposed Stackelberg
game. We first analyze the lower stage of the game, in which
we aim to find the Nash equilibrium for the miners’ sub-game.
Based on the analysis of the lower stage, we then analyze the
utility maximization of the blockchain platform’s sub-game in
the upper stage.
A. Analysis of the Miners’ Sub-Game
After the blockchain platform set the reward R for miners,
all of the miner will dynamically adjust their strategies to get
the maximum profits until reach a Nash equilibrium. In the

following, we will prove that the Nash equilibrium point exists
in the miners’ sub-game through a theorem.
Theorem 1: The Nash equilibrium point exists in the min-
ers’ sub-game.
Proof: For the miners’ sub-game, the object function Pið�Þ
is defined in ½0;1Þ. From equation (5), we can know that
mi � RN

, otherwise, the profit of miner si will be negative.
Thus mi is continuously chosen in ½0; RN

�, which is a non-
empty, convex and compact subset of the Euclidean space.
Next, we calculate the first order and second order derivatives
of function Pið�Þ.

Therefore, Pið�Þ is a strictly concave function, and we then
conclude that the Nash equilibrium point exists in the miners’
sub-game. &
As Pið�Þ is a strictly concave function with mi, given the
reward R of the blockchain platform and other miners’
strategies m�im�i, miner si has a unique best strategy ui, and
it can be achieved when the first order derivative of Pið�Þ

Sort the miners in ascending order of �i, for clarity,
miners are renumbered and still denoted by S ¼

We assume that the the first q miners have a non-zero strat-
egy, i.e., mq > 0, mqþ1 ¼ 0. We let Sq ¼ fs1; s2; ; sqg. It’s
obvious that
P

ing corollary.
Corollary 2: Let q be the number of miners that have a non-
zero strategy in a Nash equilibrium, then we have q � 2.
Proof: Firstly, it’s clear that q > 0, otherwise, according to
equation (5), any miner si who purchase computational power
with the amount in ð0; RN
�i
Þ can get more profit. Then we con-
sider the case that q ¼ 1. Let s1 be the miner who has a posi-
tive strategy, and its current best strategy is to purchase m1
amount of computational power. According to equation (5),
s1’s current profit is RN � �1m1. However, s1 can increase its
profit by continuously reducing m1 to 0, which indicates that
miners didn’t reach a Nash equilibrium point. Therefore, the
corollary holds. &

Based on the above analysis, we design the following algo-
rithm to find the Nash equilibrium point for the miners’ sub-
game.
In the following, we first prove the strategies produced by
Algorithm 1 is a Nash equilibrium for the miners’ sub-game,
then we prove that the Nash equilibrium is unique.

Theorem 2: The strategies produced by Algorithm 1 is a
Nash equilibrium for the miners’ sub-game.
Proof: For miners in S0, their strategies are calculated by
equation (15), it’s clear that these miners get the current best
strategies as the first order of Pið�Þ equals to 0 for si 2 S0. To
prove the theorem, we only need to prove that for any miner
sj 2 SnS0, its current best strategy is 0. According to the
description of Algorithm 1, we have
�j �
P
si2S0 �i
jS0j � 1
; 8sj 2 SnS0: (16)
From equation (14), we know that
P
si2S0 �i ¼ RNðjS0j�1ÞP
si2S0 mi
,
substituting it into equation (16), we obtain that RNP
si2S0 mi
� �j
for any sj 2 SnS0. As sj =2 S0, we have
P
si2S0 mi ¼P
si2Snfsjg mi. Therefore,
RNP
si2Snfsjg mi
� �j for any sj 2 SnS0.
According to equation (11), we know that the current best
strategy for any miner sj 2 SnS0 is 0. Thus the theorem
holds. &
The following corollary helps us to prove the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium for the miners’ sub-game.
Corollary 3: Given any Nash equilibrium mnemne ¼
fmne

2 ; ;mne
n g for the miners’ sub-game, let Sh be the set of
miners with a non-zero strategy, then we have Sh ¼ S0, where
S0 is got by Algorithm 1, and jS0j ¼ p.
Proof: Assume that miners have been sorted in ascending
order of �i. According to Corollary 1, we know that mne
1 �
mne
2 �� mne
n � 0. Suppose that Sh ¼ fs1; s2; ; shg, i.e. jShj ¼
h. To prove Sh ¼ S0, we only need to prove that h ¼ p. If h >

�pþ1 �

si2S0 �i
jS0 j�1 �

si2Sh �i
jShj�1 , substituting this into equa-

P

according to equation (10), the first order derivative of Phþ1ð�Þ

which implies that miner shþ1 can improve its profit by increasing
its strategymne
hþ1. This contradicts thatm
nemne is anNash equilibrium.
Therefore, we have h ¼ p, and thus the corollary holds. &
Theorem 3: The miners’ sub-game has a unique Nash equi-
librium point.
Proof: According to Corollary 3, the miners’ sub-game can
be seen as a game among miners in S0, as for any miner si 2
SnS0 we always have mi ¼ 0 in a Nash equilibrium. There-
fore, we only need to prove that the sub-game of miners in S0
has a unique Nash equilibrium point.
As the strategy of each miner in S0 is positive, and the
profit Pið�Þ for any si 2 S0 is a concave function according to
equation (9), each miner will get its best strategy when the
first order derivate of Pið�Þ equals to 0. As shown in equa-
tions (13)-(15), we get unique solutions by solving the set of
functions that the first order derivate of Pið�Þ equals to 0 for
each si 2 S0. Therefore, the miners’ sub-game among miners
in S0 has a unique Nash equilibrium, and thus we can con-
clude that Theorem 3 holds. &
B. Analysis of the Blockchain Platform’s Sub-Game
According to the analysis in Section IV-A, for any value of
reward R given by the blockchain platform, there always
exists a unique Nash equilibrium for the miners. Therefore,
given any value of R, the blockchain platform has a unique
utility, and it can maximize its utility by setting an optimal R.

combining equation (14), we have

Theorem 4: There exists a unique Stackelberg equilibrium
ðm�m�; R�Þ in our proposed Stackelberg game, where m�m� and R�
are optimal strategies for miners and blockchain platform.
Proof: As the definition of the blockchain platform’s sub-
game, the utility function Uð�Þ is defined with R 2 ½0; B�. We
then calculate the first order and second order derivatives of
Uð�Þ with respect to R,
@U
@R
¼ abXsðbXRÞ 1� sðbXRÞð Þ � 1; (20)
@2U
@R2
¼ ab2X2sðbXRÞð1� sðbXRÞÞð1� 2sðbXRÞÞ: (21)
As bXR � 0, the range of the sigmoid function sðbXRÞ is
½12 ; 1Þ, and then we have 1� sðbXRÞ > 0 and 1�
2sðbXRÞ � 0. Thus @2U
@R2 � 0 holds. Therefore the utility func-
tion Uð�Þ is strictly concave with R for R 2 ½0; B�. It means
that a unique R� can be found to maximize Uð�Þ. Combined
with Theorem 3, we conclude that there exists a unique Stack-
elberg equilibrium in our proposed Stackelberg game. &
The maximization of Uð�Þ is achieved either at the extreme
point where the first order derivative of Uð�Þ equals to 0, or at
the boundary of domain area (i.e., R ¼ 0 or B). If abX < 4,
we have @U
@R < 0; 8R 2 ½0; B�, then Uð�Þ is a decreasing func-
tion in ½0; B�, and the best strategy of the blockchain platform
is R� ¼ 0. If abX � 4, by solving the equation @U
@R ¼ 0, we
have sðbXRÞ ¼

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct extensive simulations to evalu-
ate the performance of our proposed incentive mechanism for
blockchain-based internet of things.
A. Experimental Settings
In our experiments, we set the basic parameters of our prob-
lem as follows. We assume there are totally 1000 IoT devices
that are interested in participating in the blockchain mining
process, i.e., jSj ¼ 1000. The unit price �i of computational
power purchased by each miner si from edge servers uni-
formly ranges from 100 to 105. For the blockchain platform
utility model, a is set to be 10000, b is set to be 0.001, and B
is set to be 2000. We assume that it takes an average of 10
minutes for the blockchain platform to generate a new block,
and thus it will generate an average of 144 new blocks per day,
i.e., N is set to be 144. Unless otherwise stated, the above
parameters will be set as default settings. Each value in figures
in this section is the average of 100 runs.
B. Results and Analyses
1) Number of Participating Miners (jS0j): As described in
Algorithm 1, only the miners in S0 will purchase computational
power to participate in the mining process, then we study how
the unit price of computational power and the total number of
IoT devices affect jS0j.
In Fig. 5, we set the minimum unit price of computational
power to be 100, and set the difference of unit price from
1% to 10%. Here, the difference of unit price represents the
range of �i for each miner. For example, when the differ-
ence of unit price is set to be 2%, then �i is randomly cho-
sen in ½100; 102� for each miner. From Fig. 5 we can see
that jS0j decreases when the difference of unit price of
computational power increases. This is because when the
difference of unit price is large, �i of each miner will
become diverse, and thus there will be more miners violate
the while condition in Algorithm 1. We can also see that the
effect of the difference of the unit price is very significant,
even when the difference of unit price is as small as 1%,
there are only about 44:8% of miners participate in the
blockchain mining process.
In Fig. 6, we fix the difference of unit price of computa-
tional power at 5%, and study how the number of IoT devices
affect jS0j. It can be seen that the growth of jS0j does not have
a linear relationship with the number of IoT devices. There
are about 28:5% of miners participate in the blockchain min-
ing process when jSj ¼ 500, while there are only about 9% of
miners participate in the blockchain mining process when jSj
increased to 5000.
2) Effect of Unit Price �i on Utilities and Strategies: We fix
the difference of the unit price of computational power at 5%,
and study how �i of each miner affect the utilities and strate-
gies of blockchain platform and miners.
As shown in Fig. 7, when the unit price of computation
power increases, the blockchain platform needs to improve
the reward to achieve maximum utility until the maximum
value of the reward is reached. And miners tend to purchase
less computational power as it will cost more money. Com-
bining Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we can observe that the platform
utility decreases as the unit price of computational power
Fig. 5. Impact of the difference of unit price on jS0j.

increases, this is because the platform improves the reward
but miners provide less computational power. We can also
see that the miners’ average profit increases even though
they have to pay more money to afford unit computational
power. The reason is that miners purchase less computa-
tional power, while the platform gives more rewards to
them.
3) Effect of jSj on Platform Utility and Miners’ Profits: We
fix the range of the unit price of computational power at
½100; 105�, and study the effect of jSj on platform utility and
miners’ profits.
As shown in Fig. 9, the platform always has a stable utility
no matter how jSj changes. However, miners’ average profit
will decrease as jSj increases. This is because there will be
more miners participate in the mining process, and thus inten-
sifies the competition.
Fig. 10 shows the profits of miners s1, s50, and s100. Note
that all miners have been sorted and renumbered in the
ascending order of �i. We can see that the profits of min-
ers s1 and s50 decrease with the increases of jSj, the result
is similar to that in Fig. 9. However, for miner s100, its
profit increases when jSj increases from 500 to 1000, then
slowly decreases as jSj increases. The reason is that when
jSj increases from 500 to 1000, �i of each miner becomes
more tight, and then the difference between �100 and any
other �i (1 � i < 100) decreases. So miner s100 become
more competitive and thus can get more profits. In detail,
when jSj ¼ 500, �1 ¼ 100:011, �50 ¼ 100:504 and �100 ¼
100:992; when jSj ¼ 1000, �1 ¼ 100:004, �50 ¼ 100:247
and �100 ¼ 100:496. We can also see that the unit price of
computational power will significantly affect the profits of
miners, especially when the number of participating miners
is small. For example, when jSj ¼ 500, �50 and �100 are
only 0:49% and 0:98% larger than �1, respectively. How-
ever, the profit of miner s1 is 2.5 times that of the miner
s50 and 10.6 times that of miner s100.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we first analyze the relationship between
the security of the blockchain network and the total
computational power of the entire network, and define a
utility function to make a trade-off between blockchain
security and profits of the blockchain platform. Then we
design an incentive mechanism for the IoT blockchain net-
work to motivate IoT devices to purchase more

computational resources form edge servers, thus that a
secure blockchain network can be established while the
profits of the blockchain platform can be guaranteed. We
model the interaction between the blockchain platform and
IoT devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game. We prove
the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilib-
rium and design an efficient algorithm to compute the
Stackelberg equilibrium point. We also conduct extensive
simulations to evaluate the performance of our designs.
Our work is helpful for the IoT blockchain platform to set
a reasonable reward to build a secure blockchain network.
