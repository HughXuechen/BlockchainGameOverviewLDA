Abstract 
Blockchain supports free and reliable transactions of the production material supply chain (PMSC). 
However, few scholars have combined the blockchain with supply chain management. Based on 
blockchain, this paper explores the collaborative management of material supply chain for production 
and manufacturing job-shops (PMJs). Specifically, a collaborative management model was constructed, 
and the execution of the smart contract between PMJ and production material supplier (PMS) was 
explained. Then, the Stackelberg game between PMJ and PMS in the model was analysed, and the 
calculation method of the total benefit of PMS and PMJ was derived, under the information sharing 
mode of the blockchain-based PMSC model. Through trust evaluation, the dishonest companies were 
identified in the PMSC. To ensure the safe and reliable data sharing between the companies in our model, 
the probability for the dishonest companies to participate in smart contract was reduced, making it less 
likely for false shared data to appear in the chain. The effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based 
model for the collaborative management of PMSC was proved through simulations.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Supply chain management in an important part of the management of production and 
manufacturing companies [1-6]. The cost of production materials accounts for more than half 
of the standard cost for most products generated in production and manufacturing job-shops 
(PMJs) [7-12]. Therefore, the competition between production and manufacturing companies 
is essentially the contest between production material supply chains (PMSCs). The quality of 
PMSC management directly bears on the quality, cost, and completion time of the products of 
the PMJ, and even affects the selling profit of the products. Therefore, the optimization of 
PMSC management must be prioritized in company management. 
The application of blockchain technology to supply chain management ensures that the 
upstream and downstream companies of the PMSC can carry out cooperative transactions freely 
and reliably, providing an effective solution to the thorny issue of tracing production materials 
on the supply chain [13-18]. Although blockchain technology can improve PMSC management 
in an all-round way, the direct application of the technology will suppress the consensus-making 
efficiency, and lower the fault tolerance [19-28]. Before introducing the blockchain to the 
PMSC, it is necessary to improve the smart contract and consensus mechanism, with the aim to 
optimize the effect of collaborative management. 
To solve the problems in the supply chain production and distribution (P&D) system, 
Büyüközkan et al. [22] combined system analysis and system simulation into a realistic 
optimization scheme, and promoted the scheme to various companies. Focusing on supply 
chain management, the P&D system was optimized from the strategy, tactic, and operation 
aspects of supply chain management, through system analysis, system simulation, case analysis, 
and comparative research. Kleinknecht [23] recognized the dual role of intellectual capital, 
which is characterized by human capital, relationship capital, and structural capital, in

improving the sustainable production of companies, and proposed to motivate sustainable 
production directly or indirectly through supply chain management driven by the blockchain. 
Gu et al. [24] put forward a new structure of the supply chain system, and illustrated the real-
world production process with a labelled directed acyclic hypergraph. By labelling all the parts 
of multicomponent products, a timestamp was automatically added to protect the supply chain 
data. 
The blockchain can formally supervise the entire supply chain without going from one place 
to another. Drawing on the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and blockchain 
technology, Kusi-Sarpong et al. [25] presented an evaluation system for the supply chain 
network production capacity, facilitating the acquisition of data in real time, and the automatic 
evaluation of company production capacity. The blockchain technology supports open and 
distributed data storage and sharing, and enables fair and automatic data transactions. In the 
light of the features of the blockchain system, Madhwal et al. [26] detailed the supply chain 
governance mechanism for agricultural products based on blockchain technology. Under the 
basic framework of blockchain, the functional framework was designed for the governance of 
agricultural supply chain. Furthermore, the trust mechanism and contract mechanism of the 
blockchain-based agricultural supply chain governance were analysed. 
So far, blockchain management and performance have been fully analysed at home and 
abroad, providing theoretical support to the sharing of supply chain information. However, the 
existing studies on the blockchain mainly consider the application of the blockchain in finance, 
and rarely combine the blockchain with supply chain management. To fill the gap, this paper 
explores the collaborative management of material supply chain for PMJs based on blockchain. 
The main contents are as follows: Section 2 elaborates on the advantages of blockchain-based 
collaborative management mechanism of the PMSC, constructs a collaborative management 
model, and demonstrates the execution of the smart contract between PMJ and production 
material supplier (PMS). Section 3 analyses the Stackelberg game between PMJ and PMS in 
the model, explains the order of moves of the two parties, and derives the calculation method 
of the total benefit of PMS and PMJ, under the information sharing mode of the blockchain-
based PMSC model. Section 4 identifies the dishonest companies in the blockchain-based 
PMSC model by trust evaluation, reduces the probability for the identified dishonest companies 
to participate in smart contract, making it less likely for false shared data to appear in the chain. 
In this way, the companies in the proposed blockchain-based PMSC model can share data safely 
and reliably. 
2. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED COLLABORATIVE PMSC MANAGEMENT 
For PMSC companies, the key to establish mutual trust is to develop a flat, efficient, and self-
trusting supply chain information sharing model. With advantages of self-trust and collective 
maintainability, blockchain technology can adapt well to the trust construction between PMSC 
companies, and effectively improve the cooperation efficiency between each company and PMJ. 
PMSC is a group of multiple stakeholders. If the stakeholders want to share information 
related to their own interests, the sharing process must be highly secure. Based on asymmetric 
encryption and smart contract, the blockchain can technically ensure the authenticity and 
reliability of the shared information, while limiting the information sharing authority of each 
company. 
PMSC involves cross-regional and inter-departmental businesses. Thus, the PMSC 
information sharing model must be able to integrate all shared information efficiently into high 
quality information. By virtue of peer-to-peer transmission, smart contract, and consensus 
algorithm, the blockchain can create a distributed communication architecture based on each 
company, and realize the efficient integration and sharing of information in the chain. 
Yang, Tan: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Management of Job Shop Supply Chain 
366 
In the PMSC, the companies both cooperate and compete with each other. The blockchain 
can provide an authentic, credible, timely, and complete environment for information sharing. 
In the environment, the shared information is effective and fully utilized, and the competition 
and benefit distribution mechanisms are reasonable and fair, making the PMSC more 
competitive. 
In a blockchain-based PMJ production project, the PMSC companies responsible for 
supplying the project materials should provide the information of procurement, inventory, and 
distribution in a timely manner. The collected images and videos should be converted into 
digital signals for further analysis, using barcodes, sensors, radio frequency identification 
(RFID), and other technologies. In reality, the PMSC companies need to share private 
information related to their own interests, under the premise of mutual trust, to prevent their 
confidential information from being stolen by other companies. Concerning the establishment 
of mutual trust between PMSC companies, the PMJ production project can exchange digital 
information using the public and private keys of each company, in the context of the 
collaborative management of blockchain and supply chain. For the information safety of the 
PMSC, the data shared by the companies can be encrypted by asymmetric encryption 
algorithms, in order to ensure the safety and completeness of shared information. 
The traditional PMSC management mode includes complex and diverse manual processing 
links. If these links cannot share information timely, it would be impossible to satisfy the 
demand for production materials, or complete the production project within the schedule. This 
paper adopts the smart contract technology of the blockchain to develop a more intelligent 
PMSC management process.

Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of the blockchain-based model for the collaborative 
management of PMSC. The blockchain-based collaborative management of PMSC covers two 
phases: In the first phase, the PMS enters the blockchain, and configures the block smart 
contract. In the second phase, the contents of the smart contract are materialized, including 
pricing, and stock tacking. 
The proposed PMSC model is a chain of the production links in a specific production project 
of PMJ, which are arranged in time order. Once a company generates a new smart contract, the 
contract contents of the previous block will be covered by the new block, i.e., each new block 
contains all the information of the previous block. As per its own needs, the PMS can expand 
the smart contract. For example, the PMS can set the condition for automatic integration of its 
material requirement information: the inventory of production materials falls short of the 
demand of the PMJ. The smart contract will be executed as soon as the contractual condition is 
satisfied. The execution process of smart contract is explained in Fig. 2. 
3. GAME ANALYSIS 
The nodes in the PMSC model can be divided into PMJ and PMS. The two parties are engaged 
in a Stackelberg game. The PMJ, as the leader, predicts the material demand according to the 
order quantity and production process, and determines the purchase time, as well as the type 
and quantity of the materials to purchase. The PMS, as the follower, designs the price and 
material supply strategy based on the PMJ’s material demand information, with the goal to 
maximize its own benefit. Upon receiving the purchase information from PMJ, the PMS will 
offer a price for each type of materials. When the production is confirmed, the PMS will 
optimize the material price to maximize the company’s expected price utility. Meanwhile, the 
PMJ will optimize the material purchase strategy to maximize the benefit of the production 
project. Based on the above assumptions, the order of moves between PMJ and PMS in the 
game is described in Fig. 3. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the PMJ and the PMS move in the following order during the game: 
(1) The PMS appears in the initial phase of production material procurement. 
(2) The PMJ predicts material demand according to order quantity, and production process, 
obtains the PMS discount factor through a survey, generates the PMS pricing function based 
on historical data, and then analyses the historical material prices offered by the PMS. 
(3) The PMJ publicly announces the purchase quantity and dynamic purchase strategy for 
production materials. 
(4) Upon receiving the PMJ’s purchase information, the PMS calculates the expected price 
utility of the company, and decides whether to offer a price for material supply to the PMJ. 
(5) The PMS offers a price or leaves. 
(6) The Stackelberg game between the two parties ends. 
The PMJ predicts material demand according to order quantity, and production process, and 
then purchases a quantity E of production materials form the PMS. Then, the PMS determines 
the price P1 per unit of materials, according to the quantity of purchased materials. The 
production cost of the PMS per unit of materials is denoted by D1; the selling price determined 
by the PMJ per unit of materials is denoted by P2; the extra inventory cost of the PMS per unit 
of materials is denoted by D2; the oscillation range of the purchase quantity is denoted by α; the 
benefits of PMS and PMJ are denoted by R1 and R2, respectively; the total benefit is denoted by 
R3; two constant parameters are denoted by ψ1 and ψ2. If the oscillation range of the purchase 
quantity is available, then α is nonzero; otherwise, α is zero. The relationship between the 
quantity of production materials and the selling price per unit of materials can be expressed as: 
 +−= 221 PE          (1)

Figure 3: Order of moves in the game. 
Under the information sharing mode of the blockchain-based PMSC model, all the 
information provided by PMJ and PMS are updated, and shared with other nodes. Thus, any 
node of the PMSC can acquire the latest, complete information shared by any other node at any 
time. In the ideal condition, the PMS does not need to manage the inventory. In the real world, 
however, it is necessary to consider a safety inventory that incurs no extra cost. In the latter 
case, the benefits of PMS and PMJ can be respectively calculated by: 
( ) ( )( ) +−−=−= 22111111 PDPEDPR         (2) 
( ) ( )( )22112122 PPPEPPR  −−=−=
       (3) 
Comparing the PMSC management modes before and after the introduction of blockchain 
technology, the PMSC nodes gain more benefits under the blockchain-based information 
sharing environment. In this case, the total benefits of PMS and PMJ can be calculated by:

In the PMJ material supply chain composed of PMS and PMJ, the PMSC companies can 
obtain more benefits under the mode of sharing the information about operation, purchase, price, 
and supply than under the traditional supply chain management mode. Therefore, the 
collaborative management strategy between blockchain and supply chain is superior to the 
traditional management mode of supply chain, and effectively enhances the overall benefit of 
the supply chain. 
4. TRUST EVALUATION 
To ensure the safe and reliable data sharing between the companies in the blockchain-based 
PMSC model, this paper identifies the dishonest companies in the chain through trust evaluation. 
Then, the probability for the identified dishonest companies to participate in smart contract was 
reduced, making it less likely for false shared data to appear in the chain. The trust between 
Yang, Tan: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Management of Job Shop Supply Chain 
369 
PMS and PMJ was determined based on the number of satisfactory collaborations, and the 
number of unsatisfactory collaborations between the two parties. The trust of the blocks created 
by each company was measured by the number of true and false blocks created by that company. 
The trust of the check blocks of each company participating in PMSC block check was derived 
from the check numbers of true and false blocks of that company. 
In the PMSC model, the improved EigenTrust algorithm is adopted to record the 
collaborations between PMS and PMJ. Once a collaboration is complete, the PMJ will evaluate 
the collaboration service provided by the PMS, and, on this basis, rate the trust of that party in 
collaboration. The mean of collaboration scores reflects the trust of that company in PMSC 
collaborations. Let Oi be the trust of company i in PMSC collaborations; dij be the trust between 
company i and the PMJ in the jth collaboration; N be the total number of collaborations between 
company i and the PMJ. Then, we have:

To enhance the probability of satisfactory collaboration between each company and the 
PMJ, the trust of the blocks created by a company that often creates false blocks should be 
reduced, making it less likely for that company to create blocks. The quality of blocks created 
by a company can be characterized by a pair of parameters (ei, si), where ei and si are the number 
of true and false blocks created by company i, respectively. If the block submitted by company 
i to the PMSC is false, the ei value will be increased by 1; If the block submitted by company i 
to the PMSC is true, the si value will be increased by 1. Let σ1
i be the tolerance of the PMJ to 
the false blocks created by company i. Then, the trust of the blocks created by company i can 
be calculated by:

Eq. (6) shows that, when ei = si = 0, NOi equals 1. When ei is greater than 1, and si remains 
constant, the NOi value decreases with the growing number of false blocks submitted by 
company i. After ei surpasses si, the NOi value will be zero. As long as ei remains constant, the 
greater the si, the larger the NOi. To maximize NOi, a company must create as many true blocks 
as possible, while avoiding creating false blocks. 
Similarly, more companies participating in block check should make true block checks, in 
order to enhance the probability of satisfactory collaboration between each company and the 
PMJ. If a company often makes false block checks, the probability for that company to 
participate in block check should be reduced. The number of false and true block checks by 
company i can be illustrated by a pair of parameters (qi, di). If company i makes a false block 
check, the qi value will be increased by 1; if company i makes a true block check, the di value 
will be increased by 1. Let σ2
i be the tolerance of the PMJ for the false block check made by 
company i. Then, the trust of the block checks by company i can be calculated by:

when qi = di = 0, UOi equals 1. When qi is greater than 1, and di remains constant, the UOi value 
decreases with the growing number of false block checks made by company i. After qi surpasses 
di, the UOi value of company i will be zero. As long as qi remains constant, the greater the di, 
the larger the UOi. To maximize UOi, a company must make as many true block checks as 
possible, while avoiding making false block checks. 
To sum up, the global trust TR of company i in the PMSC model can be established based 
on the trust in collaboration, the trust of creating blocks, and the trust of block check:

5. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS ANALYSIS 
Unlike traditional supply chain management, the blockchain-based collaborative management 
of the PMSC adopts the consensus mechanism, which assumes that all companies participating 
in material supply are consensus nodes. The assumption prevents the transmission of massive 
invalid shared information, and ensures the probability of satisfactory collaborations between 
each company and the PMJ. Firstly, the authors simulated the number of communications under 
traditional supply chain management and blockchain-based collaborative management of the 
PMSC. Fig. 4 shows the simulation results.

Figure 4: Number of communications under different management modes. 
As shown in Fig. 4, when there were relatively few companies, the PMJ and PMS 
communicated not frequently in different production projects under different management 
modes. In each group, with the growing number of nodes, the two management modes differed 
more and more significantly in terms of the number of communications between PMJ and PMS.

During the intern at the Material Department of a production and manufacturing company, 
the demand for 10 kinds of production materials was collected, which are supplied by 10 
different PMSs. Based on the collected demand data, the proposed model was simulated on 
LINGO 16.0 (cracked version). The operation cost of the supply chain, and the distribution 
interval of production materials were compared between different management mode. Tables I 
and II show the simulation results under the traditional and collaborative management modes, 
respectively. The comparison reveals the variation of supply chain operation cost between 
different management modes. 
As shown in Tables I and II, the collaborative management mode of the PMSC significantly 
reduced the overall cost of the supply chain from the level of traditional supply chain 
management mode. Compared with the traditional mode, the PMSs delivered materials faster 
with a shorter interval under the collaborative mode. This means the collaborative management 
of the PMSC can coordinate the supply and demand decisions of production materials in view 
of the global situation of the supply chain, realize timely information sharing, and greatly reduce 
the docking time and number of communications between PMJ and PMS, thereby enhancing 
the collaborative benefits of the PMSC.

Figure 5: Node trusts of different PMSs for the same material. 
Fig. 5 compares the node trusts of different PMSs for the same material. It can be observed 
that our strategy of identifying dishonest companies on the chain by trust evaluation makes it 
more likely for the PMJ to collaborate with companies with a high node trust, and significantly 
elevates the probability of satisfactory probability between the two parties. Company 4, with a 
high node trust in every production project, boasts a strong competitiveness. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper mainly investigates the collaborative management of PMJ material supply chain 
based on the blockchain. Firstly, a collaborative management model was constructed to display 
the execution process of smart contract between PMJ and PMS in the model. Then, the 
Stackelberg game between the two parties was analysed, and the calculation formula was 
derived for the total benefit of the two parties, based on the information sharing mode of the 
blockchain-based PMSC model. Through trust evaluation, the dishonest companies were 
identified in the PMSC. Then, the probability for the identified dishonest companies to 
participate in smart contract was reduced, such that the companies in the blockchain-based 
PMSC model can share data safely and reliably. 
Next, the authors simulated the number of communications under traditional supply chain 
management and blockchain-based collaborative management of the PMSC. With the growing 
number of nodes, the two management modes differed more and more significantly in terms of 
the number of communications between PMJ and PMS. Furthermore, the operation cost of the 
supply chain, and the distribution interval of production materials were compared between 
different management mode, revealing the variation of supply chain operation cost between 
different management modes. Finally, the authors compared the node trusts of different PMSs 
for the same material. The results show that our strategy of identifying dishonest companies on 
the chain by trust evaluation makes it more likely for the PMJ to collaborate with companies 
with a high node trust.
