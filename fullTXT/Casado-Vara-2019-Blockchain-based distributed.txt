Abstract. The management of heterogeneous distributed sensor net-
works requires new solutions to address the problem of data quality and
false data detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper,
we present a nonlinear cooperative control algorithm based on game
theory and blockchain. Here, a new model is proposed for the automatic
processing and management of data in heterogeneous distributed wire-
less sensor networks stored in a blockchain. We apply our algorithm for
improving temperature data quality in indoor surfaces.

1 Introduction
Wireless Sensor Networks have become important in the last years and nowadays
are present in practically all the sectors of our society. Their great capacity to
gather data may facilitate the construction of smart environments, allowing for
a flexible analysis of processes that occur in the environment and the services
offered to users [1–9]. Distributed sensor networks and depending on the network
topology and sensor neighbourhood are also presented. In our work, coalitions of
neighbours are created by using clustering techniques. This distributed and self-
organized (overall temperature equilibrium arises from local game interactions
between sensors of an initially disordered temperatures system) game is designed
to provide reliability and robustness to the data collected by a WSN [10–13]. It
identifies sensors gathering defective or inaccurate measurements and detects
areas with similar temperatures. This article tackles the problem of WSN data
reliability from the point of view of game theory and probability, which is a
novelty approach in this field [14–17].
In this paper, we present an algorithm that will ensure the robustness and
reliability of the data collected by WSN and stored in a blockchain [18–22]. In our

approach we apply game theory (GT) to data stored in the blockchain. Our game
is distributed and self-organized so that it can work in a WSN regardless of the
number of sensors, the architecture of the WSN or the type of sensors to which
the game is applied [23–27]. The design of the game fulfills the following needs:
it is capable of recognizing the neighborhood in which it is implemented [28–30].
The game also identifies the possible coalitions that can be formed between the
neighbors. Finally, the temperature is determined by the winning coalition for
the sensor to which the game has been applied. The algorithm also has a high
reliability as it uses blockchain to store data and create a log [31,32].
2 Conclusion
This work proposes a distributed and self-organized cooperative algorithm using
game theory. The algorithm has been applied to the data collected by a WSN in
an indoor surface. The main goal of the game is to improve the robust control
of the WSN by consensus temperature monitoring. Furthermore, the submit-
ted work achievements ensure data quality, false data detection (i.e., inaccu-
rate sensors) and temperature data optimization to improve energy efficiency in
cooperative WSNs. The most significant results obtained in this work are listed
below.
This paper provides a novel, blockchain-based, distributed and self-organized
algorithm, which allows to self-correct temperature data collected by the sensors
according to their surrounding temperatures. We also address some interesting
results and some quite promising industry applications. In our future work, we
will extend the game to larger topological manifolds and we will study these
manifolds dynamically.
