Abstract In this chapter, we outline reasons why cryptogaming, like cryptocurren-
cies in general, is an area of special interest for blockchain research. We suggest
that cryptogaming is a field that drives forward the development of blockchain appli-
cations. Games require continuous interest, added value through interaction, and
sufficient content in order to stay viable as a business model. They therefore chal-
lenge the ways in which we commonly view blockchains as first and foremost trust
technologies and sidesteps from traditional banking, contracts and insurance, and call
us to envision a much wider application of the technology than is currently being
discussed in both popular media and research.

1 Introduction: Serious and Not-So-Serious Applications
of Blockchain
Blockchain is widely understood as a universal technological enabler of trust due to
the transparency and immutability of data it conveys. There is no need to appeal to
a third party as a trustee to verify a transaction between two agents on blockchain,
nor supposedly any question about ownership (see e.g., [1]). For this reason, public
discourse has labelled blockchain technology as “the trust machine” [2]. Some of the
nuance has been lost in this discussion, though: third-party verification is not required
in this particular configuration, but the human factor of trust remains. Trust between
human actors is crucial in situations such as ‘hard forks’, operating cryptocurrency
exchanges, initial coin offerings, and acknowledgement from traditional financial
structures [3, 4].

Cryptocurrencies have gone a long way from the crypto-anarchic intentions of
the original Bitcoin paper [5] to professional trading instruments such as the JPM
Coin developed byMorgan [6]. Today, ongoing blockchain development projects aim
to enable traceability and proof of ownership to complicated spheres of operations
such as land registry [7], identity management [8, 9], and information management
in supply chains [10]. There is yet another growing phenomenon within blockchain
applications: the so-called cryptogames. For the most part, they are ignored—or at
least overlooked—in the otherwise very thorough blockchain research (see [11] for
an example). This appears to be because they come from a non-serious direction and
are not seen as relevant for societally or financially oriented research on topics such as
security tokens, altcoins or smart contracts. However, these “leisures of blockchain”
[12] may be significant from a sociological and psychological point of view, and
furthermore, important in introducing blockchain applications to the wider public.
In this brief chapter, we outline reasons why cryptogaming, like cryptocurrencies
in general, is an area of special interest for blockchain research. Our starting point
is the notion that cryptogaming is a field that drives forward the development of
blockchain applications, and that games as an area of technological innovation and
popular culture is ideal for “public testing” of new technologies. Games require
continuous interest, added value through interaction, and sufficient content in order
to stay viable as a business model. They therefore challenge the ways in which we
commonly view blockchains as first and foremost trust technologies and sidesteps
from traditional banking, contracts, and insurance, and call us to envision a much
wider application of the technology than is currently being discussed in both popular
media and research.
2 Cryptogames
Cryptogames are digital games the designers and publishers of which claim to
provide additional value to their users or developers from one or more aspects of
the blockchain technology. These aspects, as observed at trade events and on game
developers’ and games’ home pages can be, for instance, permanent ownership of
non-fungible tokens (in the form of items, creatures, etc.), transportability of non-
fungible tokens to other games, mining of cryptocurrency through play, or the ability
to use one’s cryptocurrency acquisitions for play instead of spending them on illegal
cryptomarkets or taxable currency exchanges.
So far, cryptogames have manifested mainly in the form of casino-type
games, collectible-based games, and attempts at recreating the traditional genres
of gaming (massively multiplayer online games, first-person shooters) through
adding blockchain-based value to them [13]. Similarly to cryptocurrencies, crypto-
collectibles “reveal” their value in trading and may eventually become another form
of investment. However, the focus on their potential as investments may overshadow
their entertainment value (see [14]).
Cryptogames as Drivers for Blockchain Application Development 57
Cryptogames are one of the key innovation areas in the development of blockchain
technologies. Their innovativeness is based on the requirement of continuous appeal
to users and players, as well as their emerging, more or less functional business
models [15]. Most developers of blockchain applications do not have to put efforts
on user appeal, because they target very specific audiences or a specialized userbase
to begin with. In contrast, a game needs to be playable and interesting for as many
people as possible, and especially multiplayer games online depend on the number of
playerswilling to dedicate their time and effort to gameplay. The popularity of games,
in general, is constantly jeopardized by play being a voluntary activity, competition
from other games and other ways to enjoy leisure, and fluctuating userbases which
make the focus on online games a risky business.
Many cryptogames rely on the existence of popular cryptocurrencies or have their
own currency as either proofs of work or as added value, supposed or real. One such
example is Axie Infinity [16], a relatively popular game about training small creatures
to engage in combat with each other. These breeding and battling mechanics make
it possible to earn a variety of blockchain-based tokens in the game; however, the
game runs on Ethereum, and a new player needs to buy a starting set of digital
creatures with Ether. Therefore, all players must pay the “entry fee” when joining
in, by acquiring the necessary currency, but on the other hand the obligation to use
such currency may drive players away even before they try out the game itself [15].
In essence, as the pre-conversion of players into paying customers exists already at
the entry level of such cryptogames, the business model of these games needs to be
focused on player retention.
Taurion [17] is an example of a game that presents its players with a pervasive
online world of planetary exploration and conflict. The company, however, built its
public presentations upon the promise that the value of the game would be based on
permanent ownership of items via non-fungible tokens, as well as on an integrated
alt-coin that the players could earn and use. The question regarding this type of a
business model then becomes whether enough people are willing to play the game, as
with anyMMO (see [18]). Xaya also developed the official Soccer Manager Elite for
the British game provider. In that game, blockchain is used to manage the ownership
of shares in soccer teams and dividends received [19].
For player retention to work as intended for the company, there needs to be a
sufficient amount of interesting play for the players of a game (play value). Neither
novelty value nor sunken costs are able to keep players interested in the longer run
[20]. The challenge for the nascent industry is to keep the game interesting and
profitable, while avoiding direct pay-to-win mechanics (i.e., the ability to get an
extreme advantage in competitive play by paying real money to the company; [21]).
Axie Infinity, too, has raised the question on whether it has been too focused on
the pay-to-win (or “invest to win” [22]) mechanic, or whether it is in fact a nicely
playable way to get introduced to non-fungible tokens.
The question of sufficient interest and demand remains valid. Outside of certain
countries with strict gambling laws, for example, cryptocasinos are unlikely to hold
mass appeal. It is easier to speculate with the value of something like Bitcoin than it
is to both speculate with its value and simultaneously use it on a virtual roulette. Here
58 J. Tuomas Harviainen et al.
we have two significant cases to present: Flow and Terra Virtua. Flow is a blockchain
platform developed byDapper Labs [23], the company that also owns and updates the
so-far most successful cryptogame CryptoKitties. In its current state, the description
of Flow suggests that it will not be compatible with the Ethereum platform, but it
will instead be seamlessly integrated with Libra, the ambitious blockchain project
of Facebook [24]. As the Google login option will be enabled in Flow, the current
speculation is that it will likely exist in partnership with large centralized ad-serving
platforms than offer an alternative to them in terms of privacy.
Terra Virtua is another example of a blockchain platform that may have an effect
on the game industry in the future. Its goal is to create a mass-market ecosystem for
digital collectibles, including exclusive offers frommajor brands. TerraVirtua utilizes
the Unreal Engine from Epic Games to develop its virtual world [25]. Terra Virtua’s
project, like certain attempts at creating blockchain-based yet sufficiently dynamic
first-person shooters, point towards the idea that it may not just be technological
diversity and innovation, in the form of playability, but also innovative API’s, where
we will see the true contributions of cryptogames to blockchain development. Other
producers, such as BlockleteGames [26], are in turn forming partnershipswithmedia
giants to secure themselves the possibility of including cryptopayments backed by
more established businesses. This parallels with earlier cooperation between social
media platforms ormajormedia IPs and game producers, such as in the case of Zynga
(see [27]). The results of these moves remain to be seen—but are certainly worthy
of further research.
3 Discussion
Above we have outlined a number of examples of recent developments, promises and
challenges, in the cryptogaming sector. Our argument is that the role of games as part
of people’s leisurely choices and the voluntary nature of gameplay, as opposed to
the utilitarian ethos of adopting and using financial and administrative applications,
make cryptogames quite different an area of investigation than other blockchain-
based technologies. There is no doubt that due to their nature as mass-appealing
and low threshold-emphasizing applications cryptogames drive and accelerate the
evolution and diffusion of blockchain technologies. Currencies are often binding, if
exchangeable, for their owners. The same thing is true for many other non-fungible
tokens, from securities to digital artworks. Games add a wild element into this mix,
especially when connected to clever new API solutions.
Games also advance or even force technological innovation in this sector. People
often have very strong platform preferences on where, when and with what they want
to play. In order to collect the necessary revenue to survive in a financially viable way,
cryptogame developers have to adapt to this and push the technical envelope of the
entire sector further. If a large potential cryptogame market was, for example, found
to exist on a console environment, we would witness significant adaptive leaps in
the same way we are now seeing with decentralized apps. Likewise, we believe that
Cryptogames as Drivers for Blockchain Application Development 59
the cryptocurrency micropayment market, still in its infancy, will find its strongest
developments in this sector.
Cryptogames are still coming into existence and finding their ways of being finan-
cially stable. Many cryptogames on the market today are merely copycat versions of
previously existing games or variations of early online pet games such as Neopets
[28], to which blockchain technology is supposed to somehowmagically add signifi-
cant value. However crude in their execution, cryptogames are, in our view, at the core
of this topic, if not the discussion. The way in which they rely upon either cryptocur-
rencies for their value propositions, or on non-fungible tokens for their uniqueness,
means that they are increasingly often cutting-edge applications of blockchain tech-
nology—just not very popular ones. The question therefore becomes, in their seeking
of sufficient player bases, public interest, funding interest, and user retention, where
will they take this technology that can be regarded boring by people not interested
in market price investment and speculation?
4 Directions for Future Research
In the final section of our chapter, we outline the value of cryptogames to blockchain
development and research, as well as point to potential future directions. With the
field still being so diverse with regards to game types and application ideas, it is
recommendable to seek out interesting examples of successful and not so successful
cryptogames for deeper case studies and development inspiration. At the same time,
it is essential to keep an eye out on what else is taking place in the cryptogame
development as well as game and blockchain industries on the whole. Understanding
cryptogames may not only tell us what blockchain is able to do next, but also what
it is not able to accomplish. The voluntary nature of gaming, underscored in this
brief chapter, creates an interesting stress test for the adoption of new applications,
similarly to the manner in which masses of accumulated digital wealth at exchanges
and DAOs created enticing targets for other kinds of stress tests earlier.
Thefinancial andmarket applications of the technology are alreadybeingobserved
(e.g., [11]), but for a voluntary, playful software to succeed and persist a lot more
is needed. A stable-coin may have a backing organization behind it, but games live
and die on player interest. Cryptogame companies need considerable numbers of
players to create new, constant, emergent value through their gameplay, and thereby
retain their users. The games have to be appealing in their content, playability, and
business models. This means that the blockchain cannot be just an add-on. It has to
produce actual added value to the player as well as to the developer company itself.
The added value can be observed in the form of ingenious APIs that make gameplay
and token-based content and ownership storage possible, but that is likely to be just
the beginning. We regard it possible that for example the forthcoming, interesting
options for security tokens are discovered for play, not for more traditional business
forms, and then developed further by other types of companies.

One final topic, implicitly discussed throughout this chapter, is scalability (e.g.,
[29]). For a cryptocurrency, unless one is an idealist interested in changing the entire
banking sector, partial adoption at times may be seen as sufficient (e.g., [30]). For
a cryptogame to function in business terms, it needs both retention and scalability.
So keeping an eye on the first blockchain games that actually reach stable player
numbers above a few thousands will, in our opinion, be also a business advantage for
blockchain developers. On the basis of these future success stories, there will likely
be a rush of new research projects explaining the foundations and characteristics
of such stories, in the same way we have seen studies emerging on other types of
games. As cryptogames become more popular and their business models begin to be
investigated in academic research more widely, we will learn whether their success
was something created by the supposed added value of non-fungible tokens, or just
solid, good game design.
As the points presented in this chapter arise partially from analysing cryptogames,
and partially from critically analysing the marketing hype around them, we look
forward to getting challenged in further research. This said, our belief in the value
of the games together, as a kind of decentralized tool of their own, remains strong.
