Abstract: The quality of fresh products through cross-regional sales has been uncertain to consumers.
To improve the quality of fresh products, some fresh product supply chains have implemented
blockchain technology to provide traceable information for their products, and some regional gov-
ernments have subsidized their local firms to incentivize them to implement blockchain-driven
traceability systems. However, with regional government subsidy heterogeneity, cross-regional fresh
product supply chain firms lack theoretical guidance on their operation decisions. Based on the
research gap, we investigate optimal operation policies in a fresh product supply chain consisting of
a manufacturer and a retailer located in different regions. The local governments may subsidize the
manufacturer or the retailer located in their own regions, which construct four subsidy strategies
(SS, SN, NS, and NN) along the supply chain. We find that the optimal operation policies under
four subsidy strategies can be affected by the sensitivity to traceability level, cost-sharing rate of the
manufacturer, rate of products left after corrosion, and subsidy rate to the manufacturer. Moreover,
the government subsidy to the retailer is always beneficial to the retailer and the supply chain but
does not affect the manufacturer’s operation policies and profits. The government subsidy to the
manufacturer is always beneficial to the manufacturer but not always beneficial to the retailer and
the supply chain. Hence the desired subsidy strategy for the manufacturer is SS and SN, and the one
for the retailer and the supply chain is either NS or SS with different conditions.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the sales of fresh products have become more cross-regional or even global,
and the cross-regional supply of fresh products has been increasingly popular [1–3]. The
cross-regional sales can benefit the firms in the fresh product supply chain (FPSC) by
expanding into a wider market and can also benefit the consumers with a larger variety of
products from other parts of the nation or the world. For examples, in winter, consumers
in the north of China can purchase fresh vegetables planted in the south of China, and
consumers in London can buy Irish beef, Swedish fish, French wine, Danish pork, and Bel-
gian Potatoes (https://www.glotechrepairs.co.uk/news/the-uks-top-food-imports-and-
where-they-come-from/ (accessed on 12 October 2022)). Meanwhile, cross-regional trade
increases the complexity of ensuring food safety and enhancing supply chain efficiency
since fresh products have characteristics of high deterioration rate and short shelf life [2–4].
The cross-regional FPSC mainly refers to the network created between different firms in-
volved in the national or global production, handling, and distribution of fresh products [5]
and is subject to the enforcement of each local government’s regulatory policy [6].

In recent years, safety issues with fresh products have occurred repeatedly and hurt
the health and even the life of the consumer. For example, in 2013, the horse meat scandal
was exposed in Europe because of labeling fraud [1]. In 2017, 22 tons of insecticide-
contaminated eggs were discovered in Denmark (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-0
8-denmark-tainted-egg-total-tonnes.html (accessed on 12 October 2022)), and a Salmonella
outbreak resulted from papayas in multiple states of America (https://www.biovoicenews.
com/applications-blockchain-platform-agri-food-supply-chain/ (accessed on 12 October
2022)). In 2018, contaminated romaine lettuce left more than 210 Americans infected with
Escherichia Coli [7]. In 2020, COVID-19 spread in Qingdao, China, caused by imported
frozen seafood with COVID-19 [8]. The safety issues have absorbed the great attention of
not only the consumers and cross-regional fresh product firms but also the governments.
Information traceability of fresh products can promote flexible and comprehensive
interactions among cross-regional supply chain members and can also provide a feasible
and efficient way to improve the safety of fresh products [3,9–12]. Traceability technology
has been mostly adopted by firms in cross-regional and global trade information systems
based on practice requirements. Because system requirements and standards of fresh
products differ in different regions, traditional traceability technologies are not suitable for
developing a compatibility, steady, effective, and transparent traceability system among
different supply chain firms [9,10,12,13]. In addition, traditional traceability technologies
are not decentralized, so data-holder can arbitrarily change the data in the traceability sys-
tem, and thus the accuracy of traceability data cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, traditional
traceability technologies are not suitable for constructing the expected traceability system
of fresh products.
Blockchain is an emerging information technology [1] and is distributed among a given
business network [2,14]. Different from traditional information traceability technologies, it
has the characteristics of transparency, traceability, and tamper resistance and thus can be
used to create trust [15] and improve business integration in the FPSC [2,16–20]. Triggered
by the increasing food scandals, some enterprises have utilized blockchain to trace their
products. For example, Alibaba adopted blockchain technology to prevent and deter food
fraud in online sales [18]. Walmart constructed the blockchain traceability system to trace
the mango from farms to stores [19].
The implementation of a blockchain-driven traceability system guarantees a high-
quality image to consumers. However, its large initial development and operation cost
sharply decrease the intention of the FPSC firms to adopt it [3,9]. Some governments
subsidized the local firms on the FPSC to deploy the blockchain-driven traceability sys-
tem. For example, some European countries have heavily subsidized the production of
green and organic vegetables (https://www.e-startupindia.com/learn/operation-green-
2020-scheme-50-subsidy-for-fruits-and-vegetables/ (accessed on 12 October 2022)), but
other countries have not. Even in a country, the governments in some regions pro-
vide subsidies, but the ones in other regions do not [21,22]. In China, the governments
of Guangzhou and Hangzhou have launched funding worth 1 billion RMB ($150 mil-
lion) dedicated to blockchain subsidies to new companies, but the other governments
have not (https://www.newsbtc.com/news/blockchain/millions-in-subsidies-offered-
by-chinese-blockchain-industrial-park-to-new-companies/ (accessed on 12 October 2022).
https://news.8btc.com/chinese-guangdong-govt-approves-140m-blockchain-subsidy-half-the-
chinese-blockchain-enterprises-choose-guangdong (accessed on 12 October 2022)). Such vari-
ation in government subsidy strategies among different regions has been referred to as
subsidy strategy heterogeneity. Given the government subsidy strategy heterogeneity, the
current literature mainly focuses on the interaction of the subsidy strategy and blockchain
adoption decision in the FPSC [3,9,21,22], but they do not study the optimal operation
policies simultaneously considering the blockchain-driven traceability level and the sub-
sidy strategy heterogeneity. We hope to fill this gap by addressing the following research
questions. How do a manufacturer and a retailer along the cross-regional FPSC determine
operation policies in response to the subsidy strategy heterogeneity? How do the answers

to these questions depend on the subsidy strategy heterogeneity, the sensitivity to traceabil-
ity level, the cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer, the rate of products left after corrosion,
and the subsidy rate to the manufacturer? What are the desired subsidy strategies from the
perspectives of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the supply chain?
The main contribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we develop the demand and
profit functions in a cross-regional FPSC considering a blockchain-driven traceability system
for four potential subsidy strategies, i.e., Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS and construct joint
pricing and traceability level decision model for each subsidy strategy in manufacturer
Stackelberg game. Second, we determine the optimal operation policy of cross-regional
FPSC for each subsidy strategy and theoretically disclose the impacts of significant factors
on operation policies and profits. Third, we show desired subsidy strategies from three
perspectives of the supply chain, manufacturer, and retailer and further explore the effects
of significant factors on desired subsidy strategies from different perspectives.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant litera-
ture. Section 3 presents the problem description, the basic assumptions, and the notation.
Section 4 analyzes the market demand and constructs the joint pricing and traceability
level decision models for different subsidy strategies. In Section 5, we analyze the optimal
operation policies for each of Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS. Section 6 discusses the desired
subsidy strategy from the perspectives of the supply chain, the manufacturer, and the
retailer. Section 7 provides managerial insights, and Section 8 concludes the paper with
further research. All the proofs are in Appendix A.
2. Literature Review
Our work focuses on operational decisions in a cross-regional FPSC with regional
government subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-driven traceability. It is mainly relevant
to three streams: blockchain adoption in the food supply chain, cross-regional supply chain
operations with blockchain, and FPSC operations with government subsidy and blockchain.
The first stream of literature concerns blockchain adoption in the food supply chain,
Behnke et al. [15] investigated boundary conditions of blockchain adoption in the food
supply chain and showed that organizational measures can affect the successful use of
blockchain. Xu et al. [23] built a traceability model based on blockchain to track and record
the whole process of the fruit supply chain and improved the efficiency and transparency
of the supply chain. Tan et al. [24] studied the halal food supply chain and proposed a
conceptual framework for integrating halal processes and technologies in order to improve
traceability. Coco et al. [25] focused on a traceability system based on blockchain and
Internet of Things technology in the Italian bread supply chain. Wu et al. [3] investigated
the strategies for adopting blockchain technology in FPSC and showed that adopting
blockchain technology was not always optimal. Collart and Canales [26] investigated the
impact of the broad adoption of blockchain-based traceability on the US fresh produce
supply chain and discussed whether blockchain technologies might play a role in enhancing
supply chain resilience. Liu et al. [27] examined the sales mode of the fresh food supply
chain based on blockchain technology and found that competition between traditional and
online channels can incentivize firms to invest more in product freshness and blockchain-
enabled traceability. Liu et al. [28] studied the issue of investment decision and coordination
considering Big Data and blockchain in a green agri-food supply chain and found the
optimal investment policy. For a more detailed review, please refer to the relevant review
literature [2,29–33].
Our study is also related to cross-regional supply chain operations with blockchain
technology, Niu et al. [34] investigated blockchain technology adoption decisions in a
cooperative and competitive supply chain composed of multinational companies located
in high-tax regions and showed that multinational companies would not adopt blockchain
technology when the tax gap is large and downstream competition is fierce. Qian et al. [35]
examined the trust gap in food safety in food trade between Europe and China and
constructed an interconnected traceability model based on blockchain. Choi et al. [36]
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 4 of 40
analyzed the operational risks of the global supply chain of air logistics based on blockchain
technology using a mean-variance method and further provided significant suggestions.
He et al. [37] developed an analytical model to explore the effects of blockchain adoption on
pricing decisions and profits of the global fresh supply chain and showed that blockchain
adoption is not always beneficial to both suppliers and retailers.
Some of the literature is also concerned with the third stream of FPSC operations
with government subsidy and blockchain. For example, Ye et al. [38] studied the strategic
equilibrium of blockchain technology adoption strategy for competing for agri-food supply
chains and showed how the government chooses an optimal subsidy scheme to promote
the adoption of blockchain technology. Liu et al. [39] developed three subsidy models to
explore subsidy policies for the development and application of blockchain technology
and found that the varying subsidy will help the traceability service provider set lower
prices. Meanwhile, Liu et al. [40] focused on subsidy and pricing strategies of an agri-food
supply chain with big data and blockchain and developed three different subsidy models
considering the information service inputs based on big data and blockchain. They found
that the subsidy models will not change the variation tendency of prices.
To better position our study in the extant literature and show the innovation, we
conduct the comparison of our study with the closely relevant literature in Table 1 with
respect to keywords of FPSC, Blockchain, Subsidy heterogeneity, Cross-region, Traceability
level, and Pricing.

It is necessary to point out that the closest literature to our study are Ye et al. [38],
Liu et al. [39], and Liu et al. [40], but there is a major difference between our study and
theirs. Specifically, although Ye et al. [38], Liu et al. [39], and Liu et al. [40] have taken
account of government subsidy, they do not consider the cross-regional FPSC nor the
subsidy differences of multiple regions, which are the focus of our study.
To summarize, the existing studies have made great contributions in separate domains
of blockchain adoption in the food supply chain, cross-regional supply chain operations
with blockchain, and FPSC operations with government subsidy and blockchain, while
their integration is yet to be examined. Thus, the above research results appear less
suitable to solve the operation problem in a cross-regional FPSC with regional government
subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-driven traceability. However, in reality, FPSC firms
require making decisions on operation policies with respect to multiple subsidy strategies
among different regions. On this basis, we conduct the study on operation policies in
a cross-regional FPSC with regional government subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-
driven traceability.
3. Problem Description, Assumption, and Notation
3.1. Problem Description
In this paper, we consider a cross-regional FPSC consisting of one manufacturer and
one retailer. The manufacturer and the retailer are located in different regions. For the
convenience of description, we will refer to the location of the manufacturer as Region 1
and its local government as Government 1, and the location of the retailer as Region 2 and

its local government as Government 2. The government can subsidize the implementation
of a blockchain-driven traceability system for its local firms in the FPSC. Such a subsidy
program not only aims to leverage fresh product quality and safety but also to impact the
operational decisions of the supply chain members.
Given the subsidy strategy difference between the local governments in the two
regions, we focus on the following four combination subsidy strategies:
Strategy NN: Both Governments 1 and 2 will not subsidize supply chain members.
The manufacturer and the retailer need to bear the development cost of a blockchain-driven
traceability system. The structure and interaction process of the FPSC system in Strategy
NN are depicted in Figure 1.

Under each of the four government subsidy strategies, we set up a Stackelberg game. 
The manufacturer plays as a leader, and the retailer plays as a follower. The decision pro-
cess is as follows. In Stage 1, the manufacturer determines the traceability level t  and the 
wholesale price w  considering different local government subsidy strategies and the cost 
of building a blockchain-driven traceability system. In Stage 2, knowing the manufac-
turer’s decision information, market demand, and local government subsidy strategies, 
the retailer determines the margin price r  and further determines the retail price p. 
The retailer will order fresh products from the manufacturer in preselling period ac-
cording to the market demand information. Then the manufacturer will produce and de-
liver fresh products to a retailer before the selling period. When the selling period begins, the 
retailer sells fresh products into the market. For the whole producing and selling processes of 
fresh products, the information is recorded and revealed by the blockchain-driven traceability 
system. 
The problem analyzed in this study is to determine optimal operation policies in a cross-
regional FPSC with regional government subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-driven tracea-
bility. To solve the problem, we require to focus on the following technical sub-questions: 
(1) How to build the demand and profit functions considering blockchain-driven trace-
ability and government subsidy heterogeneity 
(2) How to construct joint pricing and traceability level decision models for Strategies 
NN, SN, NS, and SS in the manufacturer Stackelberg game? 
(3) How to determine optimal operation policies and profits of FPSC members for Strat-
egies NN, SN, NS, and SS? 
(4) How do significant factors affect the optimal policies of manufacturers and retailers 
for Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS? 
(5) How to determine the desired subsidy strategy from each perspective of the supply 
chain, manufacturer, and retailer in the manufacturer Stackelberg game? 
3.2. Assumption 
In order to clearly present our study and formulate the model, the necessary assump-
tions are summarized as follows: 
Assumption 1. The manufacturer and the retailer are under the jurisdiction of different 
local governments, and the government can provide subsidies only to the local firm. 
Figure 4. The structure and interaction process of FPSC system in Strategy SS.
Under each of the four government subsidy strategies, we set up a Stackelberg game.
The manufacturer plays as a leader, and the retailer plays as a follower. The decision
process is as follows. In Stage 1, the manufacturer determines the traceability level t and the
wholesale price w considering different local government subsidy strategies and the cost of
building a blockchain-driven traceability system. In Stage 2, knowing the manufacturer’s
decision information, market demand, and local government subsidy strategies, the retailer
determines the margin price r and further determines the retail price p.
The retailer will order fresh products from the manufacturer in preselling period
according to the market demand information. Then the manufacturer will produce and
deliver fresh products to a retailer before the selling period. When the selling period begins,
the retailer sells fresh products into the market. For the whole producing and selling
processes of fresh products, the information is recorded and revealed by the blockchain-
driven traceability system.
The problem analyzed in this study is to determine optimal operation policies in
a cross-regional FPSC with regional government subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-
driven traceability. To solve the problem, we require to focus on the following technical
sub-questions:
(1) How to build the demand and profit functions considering blockchain-driven trace-
ability and government subsidy heterogeneity
(2) How to construct joint pricing and traceability level decision models for Strategies
NN, SN, NS, and SS in the manufacturer Stackelberg game?
(3) How to determine optimal operation policies and profits of FPSC members for Strate-
gies NN, SN, NS, and SS?
(4) How do significant factors affect the optimal policies of manufacturers and retailers
for Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS?
(5) How to determine the desired subsidy strategy from each perspective of the supply
chain, manufacturer, and retailer in the manufacturer Stackelberg game?
3.2. Assumption
In order to clearly present our study and formulate the model, the necessary assump-
tions are summarized as follows:
Assumption 1. The manufacturer and the retailer are under the jurisdiction of different local
governments, and the government can provide subsidies only to the local firm. Specifically, if the
governments choose to provide the subsidy, then Government 1 will only provide a subsidy to the
manufacturer, and Government 2 will only provide a subsidy to the retailer.
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 7 of 40
Assumption 2. The manufacturer and the retailer need to share the development cost of a blockchain-
driven traceability system, and the cost is a quadratic function of the traceability level [3,41]. Given
the traceability level t and the traceability cost coefficient k, we consider the development cost of a
blockchain-driven traceability system is βkt2/2.
Assumption 3. The packaging of fresh products will clearly indicate traceability information, and
consumers can easily identify product traceability information when buying [3,9].
3.3. Notation
In the following, the notation for decision variables, parameters, and functions is
given in Table 2. It is necessary to point out that superscript i is used to mark four different
subsidy strategies, where i = NN, SN, NS, SS.

4. Models
4.1. Demand Function
In FPSC, the market demand can be affected by some factors, such as the retail price
of fresh product and the product traceability level. Generally, the demand decreases with
the retail price but increases with the traceability level [3]. According to the existing
literature [3,9,42–44], we build the demand function as follows:
D0 = a− bp + αt (1)
where a is the potential intrinsic demand, a > 0; b is the sensitivity coefficient of consumers
to product retail price, b > 0; α is the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to the traceability
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 8 of 40
level of fresh products, and the larger α is, the more sensitive the consumers are to the
traceability level.
According to the market demand function D0 and the rate of products left after
corrosion θ, we can determine the order quantity function of the retailer, i.e.,
D = D0/θ (2)
It is necessary to note that the retail price consists of wholesale price w and margin
price r, and thus it can be expressed as the following equation:
p = w + r (3)
4.2. Profit Functions and Models for Different Subsidy Strategies

5. Optimal Operation Policies
5.1. Optimal Operation Policy for Strategy NN
By solving Model 1, we can obtain the following theorems, corollaries, and propositions.
Theorem 1. For Strategy NN, the optimal wholesale price of manufacturer w∗NN , marginal price
of retailer r∗NN , and traceability level of fresh product t∗NN are
w∗NN =
α2(c + ct)− 2βk(aθ + bc)
α2 − 4bβk
(24)
r∗NN =
α2[c(1− θ) + ct(2− θ)]− βk{aθ(3− 2θ) + b[c(1− 2θ) + 2ct]}
θ(α2 − 4bβk)
(25)
t∗NN =
α[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]
θ(α2 − 4bβk)
(26)
On the basis, according to Equation (3) and Theorem 1, we can obtain the following
corollary, i.e.,
Corollary 1. For Strategy NN, the retailer’s optimal retail price can be uniquely determined, i.e.,
p∗NN = −
3aβkθ + (c + 2ct)
(
α2 + bβk
)
θ(α2 − 4bβk)
(27)
According to Theorem 1 and Equations (6)–(8), we can determine optimal profits of
the manufacturer π∗NN
M , retailer π∗NN
R , and supply chain π∗NN
SC , i.e.,
π∗NN
M = − βk[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]2
2θ2(α2 − 4bβk)
(28)
π∗NN
R = −
k[b(c + 2ct)− aθ)]2

2θ2(α2 − 4bβk)2 (29)
π∗NN
SC = −
k[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]2
(
α2 − 6bβ2k
)
2θ2(α2 − 4bβk)2 (30)
Based on the above analysis, we can obtain the following propositions:
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 11 of 40
Proposition 1. For Strategy NN, w∗NN , r∗NN and t∗NN are related to parameters α, β, and θ, i.e.,
(a) w∗NN and t∗NN increase with α and θ, but decrease with β;
(b) r∗NN increases with α, but decreases with β; r∗NN increases with θ if δnn−r−θ < 0, otherwise
it decreases with θ.
where δnn−r−θ = 2aβkθ2 − (c + 2ct)
(
α2 − bβk
)
.
According to Proposition 1, we use Table 3 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal operation policy to model parameters for Strategy NN.
Table 3. The sensitivities of optimal operation policy to model parameters for Strategy NN.
α β θ
w∗NN ↑ ↓ ↑
r∗NN ↑ ↓ ↓↑
t∗NN ↑ ↓ ↑
Notes: ↑: increase; ↓: decrease.
We find from Table 3 that, in Strategy NN, parameters α, β, and θ can affect the optimal
operation policy w∗NN , r∗NN , and t∗NN . Specifically, w∗NN , r∗NN , and t∗NN increase with
parameter α but decrease with β. w∗NN and t∗NN increase with parameter θ. In addition,
the impact of parameter θ on r∗NN is not monotonous.
For the impact of parameter α on the optimal operation policy, it is because that
increasing α will increase the impact of traceability level on demand. To enhance the
demand, the manufacturer will increase traceability level t∗NN , and then the profits of
the supply chain will increase. Meanwhile, to obtain more profits, the manufacturer will
increase the wholesale price w∗NN , and the retailer will increase the margin price r∗NN .
Obviously, the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to the traceability level will directly
affect the market demand and will further affect the optimal operation policy and profits.
These findings are beneficial for managers in practice to adjust the optimal operation policy
when the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to the traceability level changes.
For the impact of parameter β on the optimal operation policy, it is because that increas-
ing β will decrease the manufacturer’s profit. To keep the beneficial level, the manufacturer
will seek more market demand by decreasing wholesale price w∗NN . Meanwhile, to reduce
the cost, the manufacturer tends to decrease the traceability level t∗NN . In addition, for
equilibrium and stability of the supply chain, the retailer needs to transfer some profits to
the manufacturer by decreasing the margin price r∗NN . In fact, the decreasing r∗NN can also
increase the market demand to a varying degree. These findings can also benefit supply
chain firms in determining optimal operation policy with respect to the change of the
cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system.
For the impact of parameter θ on the optimal operation policy, it is because that in-
creasing θ will reduce the production cost and will further improve the vertical competition
advantage of the manufacturer. Thus, the manufacturer tends to increase the wholesale
price w∗NN to seek more profits. Meanwhile, the manufacturer can transfer some profits
to the retailer by increasing the traceability level t∗NN to improve market demand. In fact,
the manufacturer will bear more traceability cost if increasing t∗NN . Despite receiving the
transferred profits, the retailer can also increase or decrease the margin price r∗NN ; the
trend will depend on the increasing extent of the wholesale price w∗NN and traceability
level t∗NN . These findings can be used to guide supply chain firms to determine operation
policy, especially for the retailer in price adjustment when the rate of products left after
corrosion changes.
Proposition 2. For Strategy NN, π∗NN
M , π∗NN
R , and π∗NN
SC are related to parameters α, β, and
θ , i.e.,
(a) π∗NN
M increases with α and θ, but decreases with β;
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 12 of 40
(b) π∗NN
R increases with θ; π∗NN
R increases with α if δnn−R−α < 0, otherwise it decreases with
α; π∗NN
R increases with β if δnn−R−β < 0, otherwise it decreases with β;
(c) π∗NN
SC increases with θ; π∗NN
SC increases with α if δnn−SC−α < 0, otherwise it decreases with
α; π∗NN
R increases with β if δnn−SC−β > 0, otherwise it decreases with β;
where δnn−R−α = α2(1− β) + 4bβk(1− 2β), δnn−R−β = α2 − 8bk(1− β), δnn−SC−α =
α2 − 4bβk(1− 3β), δnn−SC−β = 2− 3β.
According to Proposition 2, we use Table 4 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal profits to model parameters for Strategy NN.
Table 4. The sensitivities of optimal profits to model parameters for Strategy NN.
α β θ
π∗NN
M ↑ ↓ ↑
π∗NN
R ↓↑ ↓↑ ↑
π∗NN
SC ↓↑ ↓↑ ↑
Notes: ↑: increase; ↓: decrease.
We find from Table 4 for Strategy NN that parameters α, β, and θ can affect optimal
profits π∗NN
M , π∗NN
R , and π∗NN
SC . Generally, π∗NN
M is monotonously affected by parameters
α, β, and θ, and parameter θ can monotonously affect optimal profits π∗NN
M , π∗NN
R , and
π∗NN
SC . However, π∗NN
R and π∗NN
SC are non-monotonously affected by parameters α and β.
Specifically, increasing α will first improve the market demand and then the profit of
the supply chain leader, i.e., the manufacturer, but the change in the retailer’s profit is not
certain. This is because, in this situation, the manufacturer will increase the wholesale price
to seek more profits from the supply chain, and the retailer has to increase the margin price
to keep the profit level or seek more benefits. The change in the retailer’s profit is directly
related to margin price and demand. Since the change extents of margin price and demand
are not uncertain with parameter α, so the impact of parameter α on profit π∗NN
R will not
be monotonous. The profit of the supply chain consists of the profits of both manufacturers
and retailers. Although the manufacturer’s profit increases with parameter α, the retailer’s
profit can decrease; thus, the impact of parameter α on the profit of the supply chain is
not monotonous.
For parameter β, the manufacturer will decrease with the parameter since increasing
β leads to more cost for building a blockchain-driven traceability system. To avoid more
loss, the manufacturer will first decrease the traceability level to reduce the cost and then
decrease the wholesale price to reduce the decline in demand. Meanwhile, the retailer
will also decrease the margin price to reduce the decline in demand, which may lead to a
decline in the retailer’s profit. Given that the retailer’s cost of building a blockchain-driven
traceability system is decreasing, the retailer’s profit may also increase. Accordingly, the
profit of the supply chain may increase or decrease with parameter β.
In addition, increasing θ leads to improving the quality of fresh products and directly
reduces the production cost of the manufacturer and further the total cost of the supply
chain. Thus, the manufacturer’s profit increases. On this basis, the retailer’s profit also
increases since the profit can be transferred from the manufacturer to the retailer for supply
chain equilibrium and stability.
5.2. Optimal Operation Policy for Strategy SN
By solving Model 2, we can obtain the following theorems, corollaries, and propositions.
Theorem 2. For Strategy SN, the optimal wholesale price of manufacturer w∗SN , marginal price of
retailer r∗SN , and traceability level of fresh product t∗SN are
w∗SN =
α2(c + ct)− 2βk(1− s1)(aθ + bc)
α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)
(31)
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 13 of 40
r∗SN =
α2[c(1− θ) + ct(2− θ)]− βk(1− s1){aθ(3− 2θ) + b[c(1− 2θ) + 2ct]}
θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(32)
t∗SN =
α[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]
θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(33)
On the basis, according to Equation (3) and Theorem 2, we can obtain the following
corollary, i.e.,
Corollary 2. For Strategy SN, the retailer’s optimal retail price can be uniquely determined, i.e.,
p∗SN = −
3aβkθ(1− s1)− (c + 2ct)
[
α2 − bβk(1− s1)
]
θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(34)
According to Theorem 2 and Equations (11)–(13), we can determine optimal profits of
the manufacturer π∗SN
M , retailer π∗SN
R , and supply chain π∗SN
SC , i.e.,
π∗SN
M = − βk(1− s1)[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]2
2θ2[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]

[
α2(1− βs1)− 6bβ2k(1− s1)
2
]
2θ2[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
2 (37)
Based on the above analysis, we can obtain the following propositions:
Proposition 3. For Strategy SN, w∗SN , r∗SN , and t∗SN are related to parameters α, β, θ and
s1, i.e.,
(a) w∗SN and t∗SN increase with α, θ, and s1, but decrease with β;
(b) r∗NN increases with α and s1, but decreases with β; r∗NN increases with θ if δnn−r−θ < 0,
otherwise it decreases with θ.
where δsn−r−θ = 2aβkθ2(1− s1)− (c + 2ct)
[
α2 − bβk(1− s1)
]
.
According to Proposition 3, we use Table 5 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal operation policy to model parameters for Strategy SN.
Table 5. The sensitivities of optimal operation policy to model parameters for Strategy SN.
α β θ s1
w∗SN ↑ ↓ ↑ ↑
r∗SN ↑ ↓ ↓↑ ↑
t∗SN ↑ ↓ ↑ ↑
Notes: ↑: increase; ↓: decrease.
From Table 5 for Strategy SN, we can also see that the parameters α, β, θ, and s1 can
affect the optimal operation policy. Since the impact trends and extents of parameters α, β,
and θ on the optimal operation policy are similar to the ones in Table 3, we will not repeat
the illustrations here.
Particularly, w∗SN , r∗SN , and t∗SN increase with parameter s1, this is because the
external subsidy will improve the profit of the manufacturer. To seek more profit, the
manufacturer will increase the wholesale price w∗SN , leading to a decline in demand. For
the equilibrium and stability of the supply chain, the manufacturer will also increase the
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 14 of 40
traceability level t∗SN to improve the demand. Meanwhile, the retailer will seek more profit
by increasing the margin price r∗SN .
Proposition 4. For Strategy SN, π∗SN
M , π∗SN
R , and π∗SN
SC are related to parameters α, β, θ, and
s1, i.e.,
(a) π∗SN
M increases with α, θ, and s1, but decreases with β;
(b) π∗SN
R increases with θ; π∗SN
R increases with α if δsn−R−α < 0, otherwise it decreases with α;
π∗SN
R increases with β if δsn−R−β < 0, otherwise it decreases with β; π∗SN
R increases with s1
if δsn−R−s1 < 0, otherwise it decreases with s1;
(c) π∗SN
SC increases with θ; π∗SN
SC increases with α if δsn−SC−α < 0, otherwise it decreases with α;
π∗SN
SC increases with β if δsn−SC−β < 0, otherwise it decreases with β; π∗SN
SC increases with
s1 if δsn−SC−s1 < 0, otherwise it decreases with s1;
where δsn−R−α = α2(1− β) + 4bβk(1− s1)[1− β(2− s1)], δsn−R−β = α2− 4bk(1− s1)[2− β(2− s1)],
δsn−R−s1 = 2− β(3− s1), δsn−SC−α = α2(1− βs1)− 4bβk(1− s1)[1 + β(3− 2s1)],
δsn−SC−β = α2s1 − 4bk(1− s1)[2− β(3− 2s1)], δsn−SC−s1 = α2 + 8bk[1− β(2− s1)].
According to Proposition 4, we use Table 6 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal profits to model parameters for Strategy SN.

M ↑ ↓ ↑ ↑

From Table 6 for Strategy SN, we can also see that the parameters α, β, θ, and s1 can
affect optimal profits. Since impact trends and extents of parameters α, β, and θ are similar
to the ones in Table 4, we will not repeat the illustrations here.
In addition, π∗SN
M , π∗SN
R , and π∗SN
SC are sensitive to parameter s1. Specifically, subsidy
rate s1 can monotonously increase profit π∗SN
M , but can non-monotonously affect the profits
π∗SN
R and π∗SN
SC . This is because that subsidy rate s1 can directly affect the manufacturer’s
profit but indirectly affect the retailer’s profit. Since the indirect impact trend and ex-
tent of the subsidy rate s1 on the retailer’s profit are related to the increasing size of the
wholesale price, and the change of wholesale price is not certain, the retailer’s profit is not
monotonously affected by the subsidy rate s1. On this basis, the impact trend on the profit
of the supply chain is also monotonous.
5.3. Optimal Operation Policy for Strategy NS
By solving Model 3, we can obtain the following theorems, corollaries, and propositions.
Theorem 3. For Strategy NS, the optimal wholesale price of manufacturer w∗NS, marginal price of
retailer r∗NS, and traceability level of fresh product t∗NS are
w∗NS =

r∗NS =

t∗NS =
α[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]
θ(α2 − 4bβk)
(40)
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 15 of 40
On the basis, according to Equation (3) and Theorem 3, we can obtain the following
corollary, i.e.,
Corollary 3. For Strategy NS, the retailer’s optimal retail price can be uniquely determined, i.e.,
p∗NS = −
3aβkθ + (c + 2ct)
(
α2 + bβk
)
θ(α2 − 4bβk)
(41)
According to Theorem 3 and Equations (16)–(18), we can determine optimal profits of
the manufacturer π∗NS
M , retailer π∗NS
R , and supply chain π∗NS
SC , i.e.,
π∗NS
M = − βk[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]2

Based on the above analysis, we can obtain the following propositions:
Proposition 5. For Strategy NS, w∗NS, r∗NS, and t∗NS are related to parameters α, β, and θ, i.e.,
(a) w∗NS and t∗NS increase with α and θ, but decrease with β;
(b) r∗NS increases with α, but decreases with β; r∗NS increases with θ if δns−r−θ < 0, otherwise
it decreases with θ;
(c) w∗NS, r∗NS, and t∗NS are not related to s2.
where δns−r−θ = 2aβkθ2 − (c + 2ct)

From Table 7 for Strategy NS, we can also see the parameters α, β, and θ can affect the
optimal operation policy. Since the impact trends and extents of parameters α, β, and θ
on the optimal operation policy are similar to the ones in Table 3, we will not repeat the
illustrations here.
It is necessary to note that parameter s2 will not affect the optimal operation policy.
This is because the subsidy from government 2 is related to the retailer’s profit but is not
relevant to the retailer’s decision. In fact, the subsidy from government 2 is an exogenous
compensation for the retailer. Thus, the parameter s2 cannot affect the optimal operation
policy.
Proposition 6. For Strategy NS, π∗NS

SC are related to parameters α, β, θ, and
s2, i.e.,

(c) π∗NS

δns−SC−β = α2s2 + 4bk[2(1− s2)− β(3− s2)].
According to Proposition 6, we use Table 8 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal profits to model parameters for Strategy NS.

From Table 8 for Strategy NS, we can also see that the parameters α, β, and θ can affect
optimal profits. Since impact trends and extents of parameters α, β, and θ are similar to the
ones in Table 4, we will not repeat the illustrations here.
In addition, it is necessary to point out that parameter s2 can affect the retailer’s
profit and further affect the profit of the supply chain. However, it cannot affect the
manufacturer’s profit since the subsidy from government 2 is regarded as the exogenous
compensation for the retailer.
5.4. Optimal Operation Policy for Strategy SS
By solving Model 4, we can obtain the following theorems, corollaries, and propositions.
Theorem 4. For Strategy SS, the optimal wholesale price of manufacturer w∗SS, marginal price of
retailer r∗SS , and traceability level of fresh product t∗SS are
w∗SS =
α2(c + ct)− 2βk(1− s1)(aθ + bc)
α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)
(45)
r∗SS =
α2[c(1− θ) + ct(2− θ)]− βk(1− s1){aθ(3− 2θ) + b[c(1− 2θ) + 2ct]}
θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(46)
t∗SS =
α[b(c + 2ct)− aθ]
θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(47)
On the basis, according to Equation (3) and Theorem 4, we can obtain the following
corollary, i.e.,
Corollary 4. For Strategy SS, the retailer’s optimal retail price can be uniquely determined, i.e.,
p∗SS = −
3aβkθ(1− s1)− (c + 2ct)

θ[α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)]
(48)

According to Theorem 4 and Equations (21)–(23), we can determine optimal profits of
the manufacturer π∗SS

R , and supply chain π∗SS

Based on the above analysis, we can obtain the following propositions:
Proposition 7. For Strategy SS, w∗SS, r∗SS, and t∗SS are related to parameters α, β, θ, and s1, i.e.,
(a) w∗SS and t∗SS increase with α, θ, and s1, but decrease with β;
(b) r∗SS increases with α and s1, but decreases with β; r∗SS increases with θ if δss−r−θ < 0,
otherwise it decreases with θ;
(c) w∗SS, r∗SS, and t∗SS are not related to s2.
where δss−r−θ = 2aβkθ2(1− s1)− (c + 2ct)
[

.
According to Proposition 7, we use Table 9 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal operation policy to model parameters for Strategy SS.

From Table 9 for Strategy SS, we can also see that the parameters α, β, θ, and s1 can
affect the optimal operation policy. Since the impact trends and extents of parameters α, β, θ,
and s1 on the optimal operation policy are similar to the ones in Table 5, and the sensitivity
of parameter s2 is similar to the one in Table 7, we will not repeat the illustrations here.

According to Proposition 8, we use Table 10 to show and compare the sensitivities of
optimal profits to model parameters for Strategy SS.

From Table 10 for Strategy SS, we can also see that the parameters α, β, θ, s1, and s2
can affect optimal profits. Since impact trends and extents of parameters α, β, θ, and s1 are
similar to the ones in Table 6, and the impact trends and extents of parameter s2 is similar
to the ones in Table 8, we will not repeat the illustrations here.
Based on the above theoretical results for Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS and the
comparative analysis among the impacts of model parameters on operation policies and
profits, as shown in Tables 4–10, we highlight the following findings.
Finding 1: For four subsidy strategies, the effects of model parameters on optimal
operation policies generally follow the monotonous trend. Specifically, the optimal policies
increase with sensitivity coefficient α and subsidy rate s1, decrease with cost-sharing rate
β, are not related to subsidy rate s2, and generally increase with rate θ of products left
after corrosion.
Finding 2: For four subsidy strategies, increasing α is always beneficial to the man-
ufacturer but is not to the retailer and the supply chain. This is because increasing α will
lead the manufacturer to seek more share of supply chain profit and may further greatly
reduce the retailer’s profit. Similarly, increasing β always hurts the manufacturer’s profit
and can be beneficial to the retailer and supply chain to varying degrees, but it is not always
beneficial to them. The whole supply chain can benefit from the suitable cost-sharing rate
of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system.
Finding 3: For four subsidy strategies, increasing rate θ of products left after corro-
sion will always benefit all supply chain members since the quality of fresh products is
continuously improved. Therefore, to seek more profits, the manufacturer could improve
the quality of fresh products in production and transportation processes, and the retailer
could maintain the quality during the selling period.
Finding 4: For four subsidy strategies, the government subsidy to the manufacturer
in region 1 is always beneficial to the manufacturer but not always beneficial to the retailer
and the whole supply chain. Generally, the government in region 1 can affect the adoption
intention of all supply chain members with respect to the blockchain-driven traceability
system by adjusting the subsidy rate s1.
Finding 5: For four subsidy strategies, the government subsidy to the retailer in region
2 is always beneficial to the retailer and the whole supply chain but will not affect the
decision and profits of the manufacturer. Obviously, the government in region 2 can directly
affect the adoption intention of the retailer with respect to the blockchain-driven traceability
system by adjusting the subsidy rate s2, and indirectly affecting that of the supply chain.
6. Desired Subsidy Strategy Analysis
By comparing the optimal profits of four subsidy strategies, we analyze desired
subsidy strategies from the perspectives of supply chain, manufacturer, and retailer.
6.1. Desired Subsidy Strategy from the Perspective of Supply Chain
Proposition 9. From the perspective of the supply chain, Strategy NS dominates Strategy NN,
Strategy SS dominates Strategy SN, and the desired subsidy strategy cannot be uniquely determined
and can be
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 19 of 40
(a) Strategy NS if γ1 ϕss−sc − γ2 ϕns−sc > 0;
(b) Strategy SS if γ1 ϕss−sc − γ2 ϕns−sc ≤ 0;
where γ1 =
(
α2 − 4bβk
)2, γ2 =
[
α2 − 4bβk(1− s1)

6bβ2k(1− s1)
2, ϕns−sc = α2[1− s2(1− β)]− 6bβ2k.
We can see from Proposition 9 that the desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of
the manufacturer is not uniquely determined and can be affected by significant parameters
α, β, and θ. To show the impact of the significant parameters on the subsidy strategy, we
conduct the numerical analysis, as shown in Figures 5–7. It is necessary to point out that
we determine the parameters’ values in the numerical analysis according to the optimal
solution conditions for four strategies and the values used in existing literature [44,45]. The
determined values are as follows, a = 200, b = 2, c = 1, ct = 0.5, k = 3, α = 1.5 (α ∈ [0, 3]),
β = 0.72 (β ∈ [0.35, 1]), θ = 0.9 (θ ∈ [0, 1]), s1 = 0.3, and s2 = 0.2.

By comparing the optimal profits of four subsidy strategies, we analyze desired sub-
sidy strategies from the perspectives of supply chain, manufacturer, and retailer.

Figure 7. The impact of parameter θ  on the profits of supply chain. 
Figure 5 discloses the impact of the sensitivity coefficient α  on the profits of the 
supply chain and desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. From 
Figure 5, we find that the profits of the supply chain for four strategies increase with pa-
rameter α , and the profit for Strategy NS is greater than the one for Strategy NN, and the 
profit for Strategy SS is greater than the one for Strategy SN. Obviously, Strategy NS dom-
inates Strategy NN, and Strategy SS dominates Strategy SN. This finding is consistent with 
Proposition 9. In addition, we find Strategy SS is better than Strategy NS, i.e., the desired 
subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain will be Strategy SS and will not 
change with the increase in consumers’ sensitivity to the traceability level of products. 
This finding can testify the conclusion of (a) in Proposition 9. 
Figure 6 discloses the impact of the cost-sharing rate β of the manufacturer for building 
a blockchain-driven traceability system on the profits of the supply chain and desired subsidy 
strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. We can see from Figure 6 that the profits of 
the supply chain for four strategies are not monotonous functions with parameter β, and first 
increase sharply and then decrease with parameter β. Compared with the impacts of param-
eter β on supply chain profits for Strategies NS and NN, the ones for Strategies SN and SS 
are more sensitive. With the change of parameter β, the desired subsidy strategy changes 
from Strategy NS to Strategy SS. It implies that parameter β can affect the choice result of 
desired subsidy strategy. In addition, we find that the more the parameter β is, the lower the 
profit difference between Strategies NS and NN or between Strategies SN and SS. The above 
findings can show the impact of the cost-sharing rate β and testify the conclusion of Propo-
sition 9. 
Figure 7 discloses the impact of rate θ  of products left after corrosion on supply 
chain profits and desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. From 
Figure 6, we find that supply chain profits for four strategies increase with parameter θ , 
and the desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain will be Strategy 
SS. It is necessary to note that desired subsidy strategy will not change with the rate of 
products left after corrosion. We also find that Strategy NS always dominates Strategy 
NN, and Strategy SS always dominates Strategy SN. The above findings are consistent 
with and testify the conclusion of Proposition 9. 
Proposition 9 suggests from the supply chain perspective that the decision-maker can 
pay more attention to the subsidy strategy in region 2 and is further sensitive to the one 
for other supply chain members. The desired subsidy strategy is to offer a subsidy to the 
retailer in region 2, but for the manufacturer in region 1, offering a subsidy will depend 
on the market environment and product characteristics. For a lower cost-sharing rate β 
of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system, the desired sub-
sidy strategy is not to provide the subsidy to the manufacturer in region 2, but for a higher 
one, the desired subsidy strategy is to provide the subsidy.

Figure 7. The impact of parameter θ on the profits of supply chain.
Figure 5 discloses the impact of the sensitivity coefficient α on the profits of the supply
chain and desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. From Figure 5,
we find that the profits of the supply chain for four strategies increase with parameter α, and
the profit for Strategy NS is greater than the one for Strategy NN, and the profit for Strategy
SS is greater than the one for Strategy SN. Obviously, Strategy NS dominates Strategy NN,
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 20 of 40
and Strategy SS dominates Strategy SN. This finding is consistent with Proposition 9. In
addition, we find Strategy SS is better than Strategy NS, i.e., the desired subsidy strategy
from the perspective of the supply chain will be Strategy SS and will not change with the
increase in consumers’ sensitivity to the traceability level of products. This finding can
testify the conclusion of (a) in Proposition 9.
Figure 6 discloses the impact of the cost-sharing rate β of the manufacturer for building
a blockchain-driven traceability system on the profits of the supply chain and desired
subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. We can see from Figure 6 that the
profits of the supply chain for four strategies are not monotonous functions with parameter
β, and first increase sharply and then decrease with parameter β. Compared with the
impacts of parameter β on supply chain profits for Strategies NS and NN, the ones for
Strategies SN and SS are more sensitive. With the change of parameter β, the desired
subsidy strategy changes from Strategy NS to Strategy SS. It implies that parameter β can
affect the choice result of desired subsidy strategy. In addition, we find that the more the
parameter β is, the lower the profit difference between Strategies NS and NN or between
Strategies SN and SS. The above findings can show the impact of the cost-sharing rate β
and testify the conclusion of Proposition 9.
Figure 7 discloses the impact of rate θ of products left after corrosion on supply chain
profits and desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain. From Figure 6,
we find that supply chain profits for four strategies increase with parameter θ, and the
desired subsidy strategy from the perspective of the supply chain will be Strategy SS. It is
necessary to note that desired subsidy strategy will not change with the rate of products left
after corrosion. We also find that Strategy NS always dominates Strategy NN, and Strategy
SS always dominates Strategy SN. The above findings are consistent with and testify the
conclusion of Proposition 9.
Proposition 9 suggests from the supply chain perspective that the decision-maker can
pay more attention to the subsidy strategy in region 2 and is further sensitive to the one
for other supply chain members. The desired subsidy strategy is to offer a subsidy to the
retailer in region 2, but for the manufacturer in region 1, offering a subsidy will depend
on the market environment and product characteristics. For a lower cost-sharing rate β of
the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system, the desired subsidy
strategy is not to provide the subsidy to the manufacturer in region 2, but for a higher one,
the desired subsidy strategy is to provide the subsidy.
6.2. Desired Subsidy Strategy from the Perspective of the Manufacturer
Proposition 10. From the perspective of the manufacturer, the desired subsidy strategy can be an
arbitrary one of Strategies SN and SS.
From Proposition 10, we find that, from the perspective of the manufacturer, the
manufacturer’s profit for Strategy SS is equal to the one for Strategy NS, the one for
Strategy NS is equal to the one for Strategy NN, and the one for Strategy SS is greater
than the one for Strategy NS. Similar to the analysis for Proposition 9, we also conduct the
numerical analysis for Proposition 10 and obtain the impacts of parameters α, β, and θ, as
shown in Figures 8–10.
Figures 8–10 disclose the impacts of the sensitivity coefficient α, cost-sharing rate β
of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system, and rate θ of
products left after corrosion on the manufacturer’s profit and desired subsidy strategy
from the perspective of the manufacturer. We find that these three parameters can sharply
affect the manufacturer’s profits but cannot change the desired subsidy strategy, and the
impact trend of parameter β is opposite to the ones of parameters α and θ. Strategies SS
and SN dominate Strategies NS and NN, and the desired subsidy strategy is arbitrary
one of Strategies SS and SN. Obviously, the above findings can testify the conclusions in
Proposition 10.

egy NS. Similar to the analysis for Proposition 9, we also conduct the numerical analysis for

products left after corrosion on the manufacturer’s profit and desired subsidy strategy 
from the perspective of the manufacturer. We find that these three parameters can sharply 
affect the manufacturer’s profits but cannot change the desired subsidy strategy, and the 
impact trend of parameter β is opposite to the ones of parameters α  and θ . Strategies 
SS and SN dominate Strategies NS and NN, and the desired subsidy strategy is arbitrary one 
of Strategies SS and SN. Obviously, the above findings can testify the conclusions in Proposi-
tion 10.

By analysis, we find the impact trends of the parameters α, β, and θ in Proposition 11
are similar to the ones in Proposition 9, so we do not repeat them here. The findings are
also consistent with and can testify the conclusions of Proposition 11.
Proposition 11 suggests that, from the perspective of a retailer, the desired subsidy
strategy cannot be uniquely determined. Generally, the retailer will benefit from the subsidy
in region 2 and is also sensitive to the subsidy strategy for the manufacturer in region 1.
By comparing theoretical results in Propositions 9–11 and in Figures 5–13, we obtain
the following findings:
Finding 6: The desired subsidy strategy from each perspective of the supply chain,
manufacturer, or retailer cannot be uniquely determined, and Strategy NN will not be
desired subsidy strategy. It indicates that the desired subsidy strategy tends to be offering
subsidies to supply chain member(s).
Finding 7: The desired subsidy strategies from different perspectives are generally
different but can be the same, i.e., Strategy SS under certain conditions. From both supply
chain and retailer perspectives, the desired subsidy strategies can be one of Strategies NS
and SS, but the choice conditions from the two different perspectives are different. From
the perspective of the manufacturer, the desired subsidy strategy is one of Strategies SS
and SN. Obviously, the supply chain members can reach an agreement for Strategy SS.
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 23 of 40
Finding 8: The impacts of the sensitivity coefficient of consumers on the traceability
level of products, the cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-
driven traceability system, and the rate of products left after corrosion on the desired
subsidy strategy are different. Specifically, from three perspectives, the more the sensitivity
coefficient of consumers to the traceability level of products or the rate of products left
after corrosion is, the greater the advantage of desired subsidy strategy is. Conversely, the
more the cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability
system is, the lower the advantage of desired subsidy strategy is.
It is necessary to point out that, for all three perspectives, the sensitivity coefficient of
consumers to the traceability level of products and the rate of products left after corrosion
can only affect the advantage of the desired subsidy strategy but will not affect the desired
subsidy strategy. Different from the impacts of these two parameters, from the perspectives
of the supply chain and retailer, the cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a
blockchain-driven traceability system can affect the desired subsidy strategy. In addition,
from the perspective of the manufacturer, the desired subsidy strategy will not be affected
by the above three parameters.
7. Managerial Insights
Based on theoretical results and main observations in the above analyses, we obtain
the following new and significant insights from managerial and economic viewpoints.
(1) FPSC operation viewpoint: In deciding operation policies, the supply chain members
need to consider the impacts of the consumer sensitivity to traceability level, the
cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability
system, and the rate of products left after corrosion. If the consumer sensitivity to
traceability level and the rate of products left after corrosion is greater, FPSC can
obtain more profits by increasing price.
Obviously, FPSC can benefit from the publicity for the advantages of blockchain-
driven traceability systems since it can increase market demand. In addition, FPSC can
also benefit from blockchain-driven traceability if the manufacturer bears more cost for
building a blockchain-driven traceability system in a reasonable range. It is necessary to
point out that quality improvement is always beneficial to the whole FPSC.
(2) Subsidy strategy selection viewpoint: The desired subsidy strategy is not uniquely-
determined, but FPSC will tend to obtain more subsidies. Specifically, the supply
chain and retailer will prefer Strategies NS and SS, but the manufacturer will prefer
Strategies SN and SS. For four potential subsidy strategies in FPSC, Strategy NN will
never be desired. From all perspectives, Strategy SS could be desired under certain
conditions. Although Strategy SS will not decrease the cost of blockchain-driven
traceability, it can greatly reduce the capital pressure and can further benefit the whole
FPSC members.
(3) Impact factor viewpoint: FPSC firms need to pay more attention to the cost-sharing
rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system since it
is significantly relevant to the desired subsidy strategy. Specifically, with an increasing
cost-sharing rate, the supply chain and retailer will change the desired subsidy strategy
from Strategy NS to Strategy SS, and the manufacturer will change it from Strategy
SN to Strategy SS. Obviously, the value of the cost-sharing rate can directly affect the
operation costs of manufacturers and retailers and further affect the operation policy
and profits of FPSC members. Generally, the manufacturer can reduce the cost by
decreasing the cost-sharing rate.
(4) Government intervention viewpoint: The government subsidy can promote the adop-
tion intentions of FPSC members with respect to the blockchain-driven traceability
system. Compared with the subsidy to the retailer, the one to the manufacturer can
affect more. FPSC will prefer Strategy SS if both governments offer subsidies and
Strategy SN to Strategy NS if only one government provides the subsidy. Obviously,
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 24 of 40
government intervention can directly affect the adoption of a blockchain-driven trace-
ability system and further affect the costs and profits of FPSC members. Therefore,
both governments can incentivize FPSC to adopt a blockchain-driven traceability sys-
tem to improve the safety of fresh products and contribute to the benign development
of the FPSC system.
8. Conclusions
In this work, we studied operation policies in a cross-regional FPSC with regional
government subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-driven traceability. First, we analyzed
four alternative subsidy strategies: Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS, then constructed the
joint pricing and traceability level decision model for each subsidy strategy based on the
manufacturer Stackelberg game. By solving constructed models, we obtained optimal
operation policies and profits and further analyzed the theoretical impacts of significant
parameters on the policies and profits. Moreover, we theoretically disclosed the desired
subsidy strategy by comparing profits for four subsidy strategies from each perspective of
the supply chain, manufacturer, or retailer, numerically explored the impacts of significant
model parameters on the desired subsidy strategy and obtained some significant findings.
We find that operation policies of supply chain members are different for four potential
subsidy strategies and generally can be monotonously affected by the consumer sensitivity
to traceability level, cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building blockchain-driven
traceability system, rate of products left after corrosion, and a subsidy rate of Government
1. However, the subsidy rate of Government 2 will not affect these operation policies. We
also find that the profits of supply chain members are also significantly related to the above
parameters. Particularly, increasing the rate of products left after corrosion can always
benefit both supply chain members, and the subsidy rate of Government 2 can always
benefit the retailer but will not be related to the manufacturer. In addition, increasing
the subsidy rate of Government 1 can always benefit the manufacturer but can hurt the
retailer’s and supply chain’s profits.
We also find that the desired subsidy strategy is not uniquely determined from each
perspective of the supply chain, manufacturer, or retailer, and desired subsidy strategies
from all perspectives are generally different, but under certain conditions, they could be
the same, i.e., Strategy SS. In addition, we find from the numerical analysis that the desired
subsidy strategy from each perspective is not sensitive to the consumer sensitivity to
traceability level and the rate of products left after corrosion but significantly related to the
cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer for building a blockchain-driven traceability system.
Compared with existing studies, our study has four advantages. (1) Our study focuses
on a significant decision problem in a cross-regional FPSC with regional government
subsidy heterogeneity to blockchain-driven traceability; the existing research does not
involve it. (2) Our study develops the demand and profit functions in a cross-regional FPSC
considering blockchain-driven traceability system for four potential subsidy strategies, i.e.,
Strategies NN, SN, NS, and SS and constructs joint pricing and traceability level decision
model for each subsidy strategy in manufacturer Stackelberg game. The existing research
does not involve them. (3) Our study shows the operation policy of cross-regional FPSC
for each subsidy strategy and theoretically discloses the impact of significant factors on
operation policies and profits. The existing research does not involve them. (4) Our
study provides desired subsidy strategies from three perspectives of the supply chain,
manufacturer, and retailer and further explores the effects of significant factors on desired
subsidy strategies from different perspectives. The existing research does not involve them.
In addition, our study also provides some new and significant insights from managerial
and economic viewpoints.
Our study has some limitations, which will lead to our further study. (1) We do
not consider social welfare, but social welfare is an important decision factor in FPSC
operations. For further study, we will pay attention to the social welfare in FPSC and
analyze the subsidy strategy choice from the perspectives of the governments in two
Mathematics 2022, 10, 4592 25 of 40
regions. (2) We do not consider the psychological behaviors of supply chain members, but
the psychological behaviors are also significant decision factors in reality. For further study,
we will also explore the effect of the psychological behaviors of supply chain members on
operations policies and desired subsidy strategy.
