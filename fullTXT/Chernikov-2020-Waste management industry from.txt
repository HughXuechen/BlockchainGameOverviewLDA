Abstract Modern society has a significant impact on ecology, which is why recy-
cling is mandatory for waste management. Existing recycling approaches have many
issues and require decades and huge investments to be implemented. This chapter
describes a strategy for building the waste management industry from scratch,
based on recycling, Agile, DevOps, and modern technologies like cloud, blockchain,
mobile, IoT, and AI. The research described below was backed by a group of scien-
tists, entrepreneurs, and activists, and was hosted by the Repnoe School of Effective
Communications (Voronezh, Russia). Since 2015, the team has done many different
activities and research; it has educated students about recycling; implemented a
supply chain for utilizing paper materials from school/college; made social adverts
about battery utilization; made a map with recycling points; written guides on recy-
cling at home or shops; analyzed international experience and research; system
dynamics modeling; real-world simulation game modeling, business analysis and
modeling; softwaremodeling and architecture; and implemented a proof-of-concept.
Full research results will be available in the upcoming book, Forming of Waste
Management Industry inModernRussia.Wastemanagement involvesmany different
player roles, and every character has its own goals, behavior patterns, and regula-
tion rules. The first statement behind this study is: ‘Waste recycling is more about
economics than about ecology.’ The final goal of recycling is to reduce the number
of non-recycled materials in the overall waste. Businesses should process recyclable
materials, and, therefore, the industry must be profitable. Two roles bring working
capital—waste producers (payments for utilization) and recycled material buyers
(sell goods with such materials on the market), so the government should first focus
on the issues associated with these roles.

1 About Research
1.1 Introduction
During the last decade, ecology and waste management have become a hot topic in
Russia. The number of issues and requests related to invalid waste management is
significantly increasing, and the real percentage of recycled domestic waste is less
than 5%. In comparing the situation in Russia with that in other developing and third
world countries, we find them similar. Every study starts with a set of questions. Our
initial questions are “What is wrong with waste management?” and “How can we
fix it?”
In 2015, the author of this chapter headed this research project to find ways to
modernizewastemanagement inVoronezhCity (an “average city” inCentral Russia).
The research team consisted of scientists, entrepreneurs, and social activists. The
project’s initial goal can be described as “find what is wrong with waste management
and describe possible solutions.” The research team analyzed the experience of using
recycling in many developed and developing countries to detect common issues and
best practices to adopt them for Russia.
As a final solution of the research, the author suggested a sophisticated software-
hardware platform to grow the waste management industry with recycling using
Agile, DevOps, cloud, mobile, IoT, AI, and Blockchain technologies. This chapter
can be used by specialists working on modernizing and digitizing existing waste
management systems as well as growing a waste management industry from scratch.
Let us start our deep dive with project history.
Our study aimed to find ways of implementing recycling within current waste
management processes in Russia. We used different tools and methods to build a
holistic vision of the waste utilization process. This chapter describes a high-level
view of the growing waste management industry with recycling based on modern
technologies and user feedback. Digital transformation specialists who target the
waste management industry can use the models and recommendations provided to
upgrade current processes and systems. This study is based on multi-disciplined
real-world experiments and research and aims to find a “quick way” of making
waste utilization sustainable, structured, and profitable.
1.2 Brief Research History
2015. A group of 13 students from the Repnoe School of Effective Communica-
tions in Voronezh, Russia, started looking for models and approaches to reduce
domestic waste pollution. The project started by analyzing the current state of waste
management in Voronezh. More than 20 local experts, activists, regional government
workers, and business players were interviewed. This helped the researchers to get
an overview of the problem through the cause-effect system dynamics model. Rough
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 217
recyclable materials estimations were also made. “Real-world” waste management
business recycling processes were also explored by a group of Voronezh State
University students during a simulation game called “Waste Market.”
In addition to theoretical research, the team members also did some practical
things like educating school/college/university students, collecting paper in school
and college, posting social adverts in 200 multi-home apartments about the use of
batteries, and more.
The main result of this research phase was understanding that no single local
activity can change the situation, due to a lack of infrastructure and recyclable mate-
rials supply chains from ‘kitchen to secondary usage.’ That is why the team focused
on the business process to find profitable and sustainable supply chains.
At the end of the year, research results were introduced at the Civic Chamber of
the Russian Federation.
2016–2017. The project team prepared an intermediate report to summarize the
first research phase results. This reportwas sent to theAdministration of theVoronezh
region, but no response followed. The team focused on making requirements for a
sophisticated pilot to validate assumptions and gather real data and feedback from
citizens and business players.
2018–2019.Cloud platform architecturewas introduced as a solution for a unified,
scalable, sustainable, and profitable recyclable waste supply chain from the kitchen
to secondary usage. To speed up real-world integration and growth, the suggested
platform should also educate and motivate all participants. The next sections will
cover the cloud platform in detail. Proof-of-concept versions of mobile, cloud and
web applications were developed.
1.3 Research Results
During the research phase of 2015–2018, the following scientific results were
formalized:
1. A logistics model by the National Research University of Electronic Technology
optimized vehicle routes based on real-time events on container occupancy.
Software implementation of this logistics model can be used as a cloud service.
2. The cause-effect system dynamics model (by participation-modeling experts
Elena Bakhanova and Anna Gladkih) can be used to control the risks and side
effects of increasing recyclable materials in supply chains and upgrading the
waste utilization process regionally or nationally. As a result, the team got the
list of relationships with positive/negative/neutral connections between different
aspects of the waste utilization process and its related activities.
3. The simulation game Waste Market (by Dmitry Kavtaradze) was designed to
understand real people’s behavior in the current (hard recyclingwith no feedback)
and upgraded (easy recycling with feedback) waste utilization processes. As a
result, the team built a simulation game model. It told players about the ability
218 V. Chernikov
to speed up recyclable materials supply chain growth by providing feedback for
citizens (rewards for recyclablewaste andproof that ‘mywastewas recycled’) and
businessworkers (increasing high-quality recyclablematerials, rewards/penalties
for playing fairly/unfairly).
4. Business process models and cloud architecture (by Viacheslav Chernikov)
control the waste management industry in the digital age, including apps for citi-
zens, business workers, and government services. This cloud platform should be
implemented using lean and agile approaches based on real-world feedback and
metrics and by providing maximum value for end-users. The usage of real data
on a national level will allow the calculation of the actual number of secondary
waste in all existing supply chains. The government should focus on increasing
that number while keeping it accessible and profitable.
Based on research results, we formalized the following principles on making the
waste management industry in the digital age:
• Accessible: people should be able to recycle without any personal limitations in
public places and houses.
• User-Friendly: it should be easy to learn the principles of waste sorting and
utilization infrastructure.
• Profitable: all supply chains should bringmoney to businesses tomake the industry
attractive for investment.
• Open: high-level data and statistics should be accessible for third party services,
citizens, and partners.
• Sustainable: using recyclable materials should not be affected by an international
or territorial economics situation.
• Manageable: all business process steps should be controlled by gathering real
data, providing reports, and handling semi-automatic issues.
• Unified/Scalable: business processes, tools, and rules should be equal for all
territories and also compatible with international agreements.
• Centralized: To find the overall ‘X value’ (proportion of recycled/not recycled
waste), all data and planning should be done by one service. Centralization will
allow the government to control the industry and increase the X.
The Cloud Platform should be created with these principles in mind.
2 Improving Business Process
To upgrade theWasteManagement Industry (or create it from scratch), it is necessary
to start with money-waste transactions and formalizing the business process. This
chapter includes a description of the business process and brief actors’ behavior.
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 219
2.1 Blackbox Model
To simplify the model of the Waste Management Industry, it is enough to focus on
economic aspects and the recyclable material supply chain. The high-level blackbox
model is shown in Fig. 1.
The base value to control for high-level, industry management should be ‘the X
value’ (T—total waste weight equal to Y + Z, Y—recycled waste weight, Z—waste
delivered to storehouse):
X = Y/(Y + Z)
In general, non-recycled waste can be passed through an incinerator, but this
process will produce some new waste for utilization and costs a lot. This paper is
focused on increasing Y value, but in general, it is possible to reduce the overall
T value of produced waste to achieve a ‘zero waste’ model. The ideal ‘zero waste’
scenario will have some ways of reusing organic waste and high-cost recyclable
materials and will require extra efforts from citizens and government (subsidize non-
profitable waste utilization). It is costly to achieve 100% real recycling. For example,
very distant territories may consume and produce plastic and it is hard to utilize it the
proper way. As a first goal, it is enough to achieve 80% of recycling before investing
money or citizen awareness into high-cost business processes.
Keeping a focus on the waste-money supply chain model allowed the team to
formalize the process using Business Analysis (International Institute of Business
Analysis 2015). The final scheme of the formalized business process is shown in
Fig. 2. Current work focused on terms and business roles stated in Russian waste
utilization regulatory rules and market terms.
This business process model was used by Dmitry Kavtaradze (scientific advisor
of the research project) to create a simulation game that split into two parts: recycling
and without recycling. The game was played with 30 university students and showed
that citizens are ready for waste sorting if they get feedback from the system. This
feedback can be provided as a payback (preferable) for recyclable waste or as ‘trust

Chernikov
signs’ (e.g., information that ‘my waste was recycled’). Business process schemes
without any feedback demotivated players, and they stopped sorting within a short
period.
To find a way of improving the Waste Management Industry with the sustainable
recycling process, the project team described all business roles involved in waste
management:
• State regulators
• Carriers
• Waste producers (citizens and organizations)
• Household management company
• Sorting business
• Recycling business
• Landfill management companies
To describe all these roles within a complex business process of waste utilization,
the following behavior aspects were analyzed (but not limited to):
• High-level goals
• Communication tools to deal with the waste utilization process
This chapter does not include behavior algorithms and regulatory rules (specific
for Russian Federation) for different roles, but these data will be used to implement
a cloud platform for the waste management industry.
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 221
2.2 Business Process Roles (Actors/Players)
All noticeable business process actors described below apply complex systems,
reaching a maximum set of goals from different players.
State regulator: Current work describes all government and state services as a
single actor, or state regulator, within the waste utilization business process.
State regulator goals:
• Control and manage business players to support the sustainable waste utilization
process
• Stimulate business players based on real economic aspects
• Get taxes and ecological payments
• Reduce the negative ecology effect of waste utilization
• Reduce the number of complaints from citizens
• Implement the whole business process and regulate it officially
State regulator communication tools meant to deal with waste utilization:
legislation, licensing, monitoring, and getting feedback/complaints.
Citizens, Small, and medium waste business producers (offices and other public
places).These players are firstwho bringmoney (forwaste utilization) to the business
process.
This player has the following goals:
• Reduce payments for waste utilization
• Get an increased infrastructure and service quality (container cleanness, location,
enough count, modern design)
Communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreement with the household management company (HMC) about the waste
utilization service
• Complaints to HMC
• Complaints to state regulators
• Public protests if the state regulator ignores massive complaints
The household management company (HMC). These companies take money from
citizens/businesses to support household infrastructure, including waste utilization.
HMC’s goals:
• Reduce risks by state regulator checks, followed by an increased number of
complaints
• Reduce waste utilization costs
HMCs communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreement with a waste transportation company (or regional operator)
• Agreement with citizens
• Transfer payments for waste utilization based on agreements
• Implement waste segregation to sell recyclable materials
222 V. Chernikov
A waste transportation company. Picks up the waste and transfers it to the sorting
company or landfill. It can work with a fixed, floating, or semi-realtime schedule.
Player primary goal: increase profit and overall volume of transport service (rated
by money/car hour).
Communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreements with HMCs, regional operators, and other businesses for waste
transportation
• Agreements with landfills
• Optimization of inner business processes
• Licensing by state regulator
• Lobbying and unfair market competition
Recyclable waste resellers are agents who buy recyclable waste from citizens
and other waste producers, then sort and sell it for recycling or more extensive
resellers. Themost valuable andwidely used recyclablematerials are cellulose, glass,
plastic and metals. These types of recyclable materials do not require licensing to be
processed by a business company.
Player business goal: increase profit and overall volume of resold recyclable
materials.
Agent communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Implement infrastructure for recyclable materials processing
• Search for recyclable material sellers (personal or business)
Recycling factories. This is the second player that brings money to the waste
management industry (the first one is a waste producer).
Player business goal: increase profit by increasing quality and overall volume of
sold recycled materials and by decreasing costs of recycling.
Communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreements with waste sellers and resellers
• Agreements with buyers
Sorting company. Make sorting of rough materials at any scale and any material
type.
Player business goal: increase profit by increasing quality and overall volume of
sold recycled materials and by decreasing costs of sorting.
Communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreements with waste sellers
• Improve sorting with automation
• Load balance agreements with other sorting companies
Landfill management company.These companies are interested in getting asmuch
non-recycled waste as possible using fair and unfair techniques. On the other hand,
these companies know the market and can invest in an upgrade to find a profitable
place within massive recycling supply chains.
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 223
Player goals:
• Increase profit by increasing the overall volume of buried waste
• Maximize the lifetime of landfills
Communication tools to deal with waste utilization:
• Agreement with a transportation company and regional operators
• Unfair play:
– market monopolization
– utilization rates manipulation
– unaccounted waste utilization
Regional operator. This role was introduced in Russia in 2019 with the intent that
the regional operator would manage and control the waste utilization process rather
than the state regulator. A regional operator is generally a kind of local management
company for a specific territory that can be connected to a Cloud platform like local
Uber management companies.
3 Waste Management Industry Maturity Levels
Even in developing countries, modern society produces many kinds of waste. Every
type requires a dedicated supply chain to utilize waste or recyclable materials. This
work focuses on domestic waste.
Implementing domestic waste utilization requires a profitable business process in
addition to the existing infrastructure. The necessary infrastructure includes:
• waste bins at the household level
• containers for waste collection from multiple households
• vehicles to transport waste
• landfills as a final destination point for garbage
Optional infrastructure includes recycling infrastructure:
• points/services that buy recyclable waste/commodities
• sorting services
• incinerator services
• businesses that produce raw materials from recyclable waste
Depending on economic aspects of the waste utilization process, such as imple-
menting and supporting infrastructure and making businesses profitable; cultural
aspects, such as citizens following the desired behavior patterns; and ecological
aspects, such as reducing the impact of waste utilization andmining of raw resources,
it is necessary to find a reasonable balance.
For a better understanding of waste utilization processes and specific issues, it is
necessary to classify waste management industries with maturity levels based on X
224 V. Chernikov
Fig. 3 Waste management
industry maturity levels,

Chernikov
value, which is the percentage of recycling. With this classification, it is possible to
analyze and compare waste utilization in different territories.
Currently, different territories are at different levels, from no recycling to zero
waste (Fig. 3):
Level 1. No recycling (X <= 5%). This level is a basement for the recycling
process. First of all, any territory should implement waste utilization with one bin
where all types of waste go to one place. Only the strictly necessary infrastruc-
ture is required, and the business process can be backed by payments from waste
producers (people/businesses pay for waste utilization). Most developing and third-
world countries are on that level, and they have many issues, even with essential
business processes that should be fixed before implementing recycling.
Level 2. Partial recycling (5% < X <= 60%). As a next step of upgrading waste
utilization, most developed countries implemented some ways of recycling. The X
valuemayvary from10 to 50%, depending on the territory.Waste sorting and optional
infrastructure are required for that level. Every person should sort at private/public
places to detach the recyclable waste. Different waste classifications exist in different
territories, but roughly the sorted recyclable waste has to be precisely sorted before
final processing everywhere. Numerous bin and container typesmake it hard to place,
support, and maintain infrastructure. This, in turn, increases business process costs
mentally (more time for education and searching for bins/containers for specific
waste types) and financially (more containers, vehicles, and actions to utilize). This
work suggests using a 2-bins sorting model (recyclable and non-recyclable), which
has already been successfully implemented in many territories. On that level, the
government should focus on increasing the X value to 50%. Level 2 can be imple-
mented only with correctly working Level 1 processes that handle more than 80%
of produced waste and have no protests from citizens and business players.
Level 3. Zero Waste (X > 60%). Most domestic waste is organic by nature and
will destroy itself quickly without a negative ecological impact, so it is possible to
talk about zero waste mode after reaching an X with 60%. To increase the X value, it
is necessary to make extra investments (both financially and mentally). On that level,
organic waste should also be recycled to produce manure, bio-gas, or fuel. As a part
of the extra utilization step, it is also possible to use high-cost incinerating that meets
rigorous ecological requirements. The zero waste mode can only be implemented on
top of profitable and sustainable Level 2 recyclable processes.
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 225
To select an exact number of bins, it is considered best to use two-bin sorting (recy-
clable and non-recyclable) as the most straightforward way from mental (education
curve), practical (less space and bins), and integrative (easy to install) points of view.
These two-bin containers should always be placed together: one with a sign (sticker
or stencil for painting) and one regular without any specially added signs. Containers
for recyclable waste should be equipped with a cover and the recycle symbol.
4 Fixing Business Process Issues
Tomake recyclablematerial supply chains sustainable, profitable, and scalable, it one
must specify the most common problems faced by different business process actors
as they are defined at various levels. The term “issue” in the current context is used
to determine external (infrastructure/environment) or internal (lack of knowledge
or intent) barriers that prevent a single person or organization from implementing
correct behavior within the required business process. The following tables present
a list of the most frequent issues faced during public talks and while interviewing
experts and regular citizens (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
All business players making money from recyclable materials (sorting, reselling,
reusing) are bound by the global market of recyclable waste, which can be unprof-
itable in badly structured markets because of its lack of infrastructure and wrong
social behaviors as well as the many issues listed above. The government should

Market No access to recyclable material supply chains
take control of markets to make them profitable for recycling businesses at any scale,
independent from the global situation.
In general, the state regulator should control all issue resolutions and retrieve as
much real data as possible.
There are also some high-level business process issues:
• No simple way to send complaints/feedback and control resolution (communica-
tion)
• Hard to find a reliable business partner (communication)
• High costs for transportation and sorting due to poor optimization (market)
• Recycled materials price is higher than equal raw materials price (market)
• Limited market for recycled materials (market)
• No way to balance sorting, transportation, and recycling supply chains between
different companies (market)
To fix most of these issues, it is necessary to use a single IT platform that will
gather feedback, complaints, and data from businesses and provide optimization,
education, motivation, and communication tools.
5 Cloud Platform Architecture and Implementation
Cloud platform architecture, like any other software, should reflect the real world by
modeling a complex domain model. The waste management domain model should
also reflect different aspects of complex waste utilization and recycling processes,
and include tools to motivate and educate people.
5.1 Domain Model
Tofindaway tomake a solution formanaging thewhole process fromcitizens to prod-
ucts with recycledmaterials, other approaches were analyzed including (Kumar et al.
2017; Poon 1997; Aazam et al. 2016; Sharmin and Al-Amin 2016). The approach
described in this paper is focused on making a complex chain from the kitchen
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 227
(citizens’ habits) to final products with recyclable materials. The current vision of
software-hardware complex is:
• cloud platform to handle and store all the data, analyze requests and complaints
about artificial intelligence, process all transactions and requests/complaints with
blockchain, process user activities, provide a backend for user information,
analyze collected data to find ways of increasing the overall level of recycled
waste
• mobile and web apps for citizens with information, motivation and getting
feedbacks/requests/complaints
• mobile and web apps for state workers to handle requests/complaints/accidents
and get reports to critical KPIs and information for business players
• mobile, web, and IoT apps for business players to collect tracks of vehicles,
key numbers, and transactions, track planning, information about other business
players, and interface to communicate with state services and citizens
The main goal of developing a unified cloud platform is the integration of all
market players in the waste recycling process across any region or country. Critical
areas for which the cloud platform will be created:
• organization, regulation, and optimization of solid-waste recycling business
processes across a region or country
• involve citizens and businesses in the process of recycling solid waste
• provide direct communication channels for all market players with rating-based
feedbacks
The diagram in Fig. 4 shows the cloud platform’s key functional blocks, which
are divided into the following domains:
• business process (help businesses to do the job effectively)
Fig. 4 The domain model of
the cloud platform, prepared
by Viacheslav Chernikov
228 V. Chernikov
• education (provide educational materials for citizens, businesses, and state
regulators)
• motivation (provide ratings, feedback, statuses, financial support for market
players, citizens, and state services)
Integrating all these blocks into a reliable system requires communication
channels. There are two main types of such communication:
1. Messages with requests, complaints, feedback, or ratings by all business process
players, including tracking statuses and contract completion, should be based
on smart-contracts technology. These messages should be pre-processed with
artificial intelligence services to reduce the level of fake, incomplete, and
junk messages. Additionally, AI-based text classification will allow automatic
responses with possible answers to be provided.
2. Transactions of money and waste between all business process players (citizens,
businesses, and the state) based on blockchain technology.
The fundamental concept of the cloud platform is to provide end-users with the
most valuable features. That is why Agile (Rothman 2016) and Lean (Ries 2011)
approaches should be used together with DevOps practices.
5.2 High-Level Architecture
The cloud platform should consist of many components. Figure 5 shows the high-
level solution architecture.
The cloud platform is a set of services for providing different application inter-
faces (API), collecting and storing data,monitoring critical values, and implementing
different communication channels. A collection of user applications (interfaces)
should be developed for the following stakeholders:
• citizens: mobile and web applications for learning materials and to provide
feedback, including a rating system
• state services: mobile and web application for getting statistics and educating all
players; API services for integration with other online services
• business players: mobile application for on-site workers, a web application
for back-office tasks, IoT devices for tracking critical values, API services for
integrating with on-premises systems
• partners: providing API services for retrieving statistics
The Rapid Software Design approach introduced in (Chernikov 2018a, b;
Chernikov et al. 2018) can be used to simplify and speed up the development of
mobile and web applications.
Technologies and services that are required to implement cloud and client
(web/mobile) applications include but are not limited to:
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 229
Fig. 5 High-level architecture of the cloud platform for the waste management industry, prepared
by Viacheslav Chernikov
• Languages and frameworks: C# (.Net Core, ASP.Net Core, Xamarin.Forms for
iOS/Android) and JavaScript (React.js, Node.js)
• Cloud backend: Azure App Services, ASP.Net Core, Azure Functions
• Databases: Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, Azure Blockchain Service
• Storage for unstructured data and files: Azure Storage
• Messaging: Azure Notification Hub, Azure Service Bus
• AI: Azure Cognitive Services (Vision, Search, Decision, Text Analytics), Azure
Machine Learning
• IoT: Azure IoT Hub
• Security and User Management: Azure Active Directory, Azure Security Center
• Analytics and Monitoring: Azure Application Insights, Microsoft PowerBI
230 V. Chernikov
• DevOps: Azure DevOps, Visual Studio App Center, Azure Dev/Test Lab
Using only two main languages (C# and JavaScript) will allow us to simplify and
standardize the development process with a unified number of tools and practices.
To solve business process issues, some modern technologies should be used:
1. Artificial intelligence:
• Images classification from mobile apps while sending automatic requests for
users on the client-side
• Text requests/feedback classification from mobile and web apps and sending
an automatic response for users
2. Internet of things:
• Vehicle-tracking with smart contracts for automatic detection of issues on the
client’s side
• Connected weighing devices with smart contracts support to track the weight
of recyclable materials
3. Blockchain:
• Money-waste transaction tracking should be done in internal currency. In
general, the exchange rate can be fixed with 1 INT_CUR = 1 CNTR_CUR,
where INT_CUR is internal platform cryptocurrency, CNTR_CUR is a
country currency. All loses on currency exchange should be covered by plat-
form fees, percentage from every transaction, and the exact number should be
defined for real integration. Also, active citizens can use internal currency as
reward points and spent it in internal online shops (sell goods from recycled
materials).
• Tracking complaints/feedback allows state services to get currently issued
tickets and automatically find the organization that is responsible for resolving
specific issue.
The cloud platform should just be considered as a tool for helping the modern
waste management industry with recycling as society moves towards zero-waste
status. Contemporary management approaches like Lean and Agile should be used
to control and grow the industry. Also, DevOps tools and practices will help to speed
up cloud platform development as fast as the real industry will need. User feedback
should support platform evolution.
6 Industry Growing with Lean/Agile/DevOps Approaches
To build the waste management industry with the cloud platform in mind, it should
be strongly considered that the cloud platform operator (business company) should
be profitable and make money on transaction fees. The government should regulate
the industry’s rules, investments, and cloud platform economics.
Waste Management Industry from Scratch Using Agile … 231
To get the first partners and begin to earn first money, it is possible to start
with existing low-profit markets. Using IT and social marketing offline will help
to structure such niches.
There are some potentially profitable businesses, especially with government
support and social marketing:
1. Recyclable waste reselling: Buy sorted recyclable materials from citizens and
companies, possibly grow with office buildings and public places, implement
two-bin sorting and send waste pickup requests via smartphone when a container
is full.
2. Reusable commodity reselling: Buy old furniture, clothes, TVs, fridges, smart-
phones, and other used goods for low prices and recycle them. Growth is possible
by providing selling (your commodities = money for you) or paid (you pay for
utilization) waste removal requests.
Due to the high costs of utilizing toxic waste like batteries, it is necessary to
stimulate business reselling with different regulation rules (e.g., equip every grocery
store with bins for batteries and recyclable materials).
Further improvements to the business process could include logistics optimization
with automated vehicle trip planning, decreasing sorting costs with automatic lines,
and increasing recyclable materials quality by educating and motivating citizens.
To improve apps and services (online/offline), it is necessary to get feedback and
data from real users, including requests, complaints, suggestions, comments, ratings,
application usage metrics, and technical and anonymized data.
The cloud platform can be developed step by step, by using a DevOps approach
and tools to speed industry growth.
7 Education and Motivation to Speed Industry Growth
Waste recycling became popular within the last 50 years, and it took decades for
most countries to integrate waste sorting at the household level. Based on results
from European countries and the US, this work suggests using mobile/web apps
to educate and motivate citizens to do the sorting at home. Previously, the use of
a two-bin (recyclable/non-recyclable) sorting model was recommended to reduce
mental complexity andmesswithin containers, improve accessibility, andmakewaste
sorting user-friendly.
The most active target audience is potentially be young mothers because they care
about their children’s future, the environment, and cleanliness and have enough free
time to learn how to sort waste.
On the other hand, many residents in large modern cities (500,000+ population)
already know aboutwaste sorting and recycling fromwatchingTV, using the Internet,
or traveling abroad. This should be considered when making educational resources
available—most of them should focus on children aged three to nine and elders above
60 who are not familiar with waste sorting.
232 V. Chernikov
The cheapest and straightforward way to educate children and elders about the
correct way to sort waste is by using smartphone games. Such digital games could
have the following features:
• the full game course should include 21 days of regular training with automatic
reminders to make a sustainable habit
• the game should consist of several mini-games and have different levels
• the game can also include international methods of waste sorting for those who
travel abroad
• a player should be rewarded with points and achievements while learning waste
sorting
• the game should also provide ecological advises and interesting facts (e.g., ‘one
battery can poison one cubic meter of soil’).
To simplify the integration of recycling, it is necessary to print stickers with and
international ‘Recyclable’ sign: A5 sized stickers for bins and small stickers to place
on recyclable goods. These stickers can be sent automatically to users registered on
the cloud platform.
Complete education materials should also include different static content (video,
text, presentation) for citizens, activists, state services, and business workers so they
can use waste sorting and the cloud platform properly.
Other education topics should rely on real-world practical advice and provide
simple ready to use vMeme (Beck and Cowan 2005) phrases about recycling with
the following questions:
• What kind of waste is recyclable?
• How to make recycling at home?
• How to join the cloud platform?
• How to get rewards?
There should be a set of simple meme phrases for educational materials and
advertising.
To make waste sorting (new citizen behavior!) integration successful and fast, it is
strictly necessary to provide communication channels between supply chain actors.
Structured communication should include the following message types:
• Issue complaints about business process violation, e.g., a container is broken, or
a vehicle delivered recyclable waste to landfill instead of sorting line
• Feedback on business players’ work quality based on comments and ranking
• Activist meetups and announcements
Such message senders should get reward points based on smart contracts and
activity completion results. These reward points can be equal to or replaced by
internal cryptocurrency to simplify their usage and adoption. Also, citizens can reach
different levels of platform membership and get a special universal loyalty card with
a discount for retail stores (a higher level will lead to more significant discounts).
Motivation is mandatory for making the industry’s growth sustainable so that all
positive actions should be motivated. Another motivation tool is providing open data

for different territories and households—X value at different scale and structured as
a leaderboard.
Using points, achievements/badges, levels, activities, open leaderboards, and real
rewards will require some gamification algorithms to be implemented within the
cloud platform. In the early stage of cloud tools integration in the real world, it is
recommended to implement offline contests and activities (e.g., one-day training of
waste sorting at a specific territory) with free stickers, toys, and other prizes.
On the other hand, it is necessary to stimulate fair playwith clear rules. Companies
with wicked ranks should be blocked at the platform, and all issues (especially
unfixed) should lead to penalties (e.g., a person who sent an approved issue will get
some cryptocurrency from the company that responded to that issue).
Using communication channels, motivation, and gamification will increase
people’s involvement and speed up the growingwastemanagement industry to Levels
2 and 3.
8 Results
As mentioned previously, the current research project was started in 2015 with the
questions, ‘What is wrong with waste management?’ and ‘How can we fix it?’ To
summarize the answer, it is possible to state that the ‘key of most issues is lack of
or invalid communication between business process actors.’ Communication means
all types of information exchange between business process actors such as money
transactions, actionswithin the business process, real-world data, texts, photos, video.
To structure these information channels, it is necessary to implement a cloud platform
that should be backed and controlled by the government as a stable industry. So, our
research came to this answer, ‘Communicationwithin the business process is outdated
and should be upgraded with modern technologies to scale recycling.’
Current project scientific results include the following models:
1. Logistics model by the National Research University of Electronic Technology
2. Cause-effect system dynamics model by participation modeling experts Elena
Bakhanova and Anna Gladkih
3. Simulation game model by Dmitry Kavtaradze
4. Business process models and cloud platform architecture by Viacheslav

• proof-of-concept implementationwith prototypes ofmobile andweb applications,
cloud backend, Agile, DevOps, C#/.Net, Azure
• implementation of landing page http://�pazdel��.pf (http://xn–

• a base assumption about the profitability of a cloud platform on a large scale vali-
dated by business experts—IT-backed business to handle supply chain of recy-
clable materials ‘from office to reselling’ can process orders and transactions like
Uber
• sharing scientific results in several articles and public talks/presentations
• searching for markets with a possible ‘Shut up and take my money!’ situation (a
phrase from cartoon series, Futurama, about a fascinating and attractive product)
and starting a pilot to handle recyclable material supply chains ‘from office to
reselling,’ to get real economics numbers and profitability on a small scale for
extrapolation.

Currentwork describes how to upgradewastemanagementwithmodern technologies
and provide unified ‘Uber-style’ applications for different types of users and busi-
nesses involved in thewastemanagement industry. Significantly, this work is focused
on implementing structured communication channels between different user roles
rather than making ‘smart recyclable bins’ and ‘continuing to monitor” solutions.
This paper also introduced the maturity levels of waste management based on
‘X value’ and existing infrastructure. This work strongly suggests two-bin sorting
on behalf of education and motivation scenarios in order to speed up the movement
toward zero-waste.
Known limitations of that work include the necessity of validation for education
and motivation aspects to find the ready-to-use solutions. Also, it is necessary to
mention thatmost business players within thewastemanagement industry, especially
in developing and third-world territories, have deficient management and ITmaturity
levels that can slow down industry growth. That is why future research should be
focused on obtaining real numbers and feedback by real users so as to confirm the
assumptions related to the education and motivation of users.
10 Conclusion
This article contains a high-level vision of the cloud platform that should be used
for modernizing the waste management industry or implementing it from scratch. In
order to develop a sustainable business process of waste management, it is necessary
to add education and motivation domains to the cloud platform and implement the
whole system parallel to offline activities.
The cloud platform should provide dedicated user interfaces for different types of
users and focus on key X-values—the ratio between the recycled/not recycled solid
waste.
