Blockchain technology is a database that is operated by multiple parts and forms a chain structure through hash index. +e
blockchain uses multiple nodes and distributes multiple accesses to data, thereby reducing the dependence on the central Internet
server and avoiding the possibility of damage to the central server point due to data and data loss. Encryption technology is used to
ensure its integrity and ensure that the data files stored in the blockchain are not tampered with or deleted maliciously. Blockchain
technology has inherent advantages in supply chain finance with its technical attributes such as nontampering, distributed ledger,
and traceability and has great potential to build trust to solve the main problems of supply chain finance, which is conducive to
promoting financial development in the Beibu Gulf region. +is article mainly introduces the application research of blockchain
technology in supply chain finance in the Beibu Gulf region and intends to provide some ideas for the development of supply
chain finance in the Beibu Gulf region combined with blockchain technology. +is article proposes the application research
methods of blockchain technology in supply chain finance in the Beibu Gulf region, including blockchain technology, supply
chain financial risk evaluation on the blockchain, and supply chain finance game for relevant experiments. +e experimental
results of this article show that the average processing time of the algorithm of the designed blockchain supply chain financial
system is 4.10 seconds, the algorithm processing efficiency is faster, and the relevant risks can be better assessed.
1. Introduction
In order to make the development of supply chain finance
reasonable and controllable, it is necessary to improve the
ability to control supply chain financing through emerging
technologies. +e development of supply chain financing
will form cross-industry, cross-regional, cross-departmental,
and in-depth alliances with the government, and industry
associations and funds will form an economic ecological
platform to provide effective services to different entities,
improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain, and
promote the development of the business environment. And
this stage is inseparable from technologies such as block-
chain, the Internet, and the Internet of +ings. Blockchain
technology has attracted more and more attention. At
present, blockchain technology is gradually applied in the
field of supply chain finance. Its technical characteristics play
a practical role in the field of supply chain finance, which can
improve the trust relationship in supply chain finance and
enhance the huge financing ability of supply chain.
In today’s economic globalization, economic integration
and financial integration have become more and more im-
portant. In this context, the development of regional finance
has become an inevitable trend of economic development.
+e Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Zone is located on the
southwest coast of China. It is an important transportation
hub from China to ASEAN countries during the construction
of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. It is an important
member of the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Zone and the Pan-
Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Under the external envi-
ronment full of opportunities and challenges, it is extremely
important for Beibu Gulf Economic Zone to make use of its
internal advantages and overcome its disadvantages to carry
out regional supply chain economic cooperation.

underlying mechanism related to blockchain-IoT security
relationship. From a security perspective, Kshetri focused on
blockchain-based solutions, which are superior to the current
IoT ecosystem in many aspects, which mainly rely on cen-
tralized cloud servers. +rough practical applications and
practical examples, Kshetri believes that the decentralized
nature of the blockchain may cause malicious participants to
be less sensitive to manipulation and forgery. In addition,
Kshetri specifically considered how a blockchain-based
identity and access management system can deal with some
key challenges related to IoT security, and detailed analysis
and description of the blockchain’s ability to track insecure
sources in the supply chain related to IoT devices. +is re-
search lacks experimental data support and is not practical [1].
Gelsomino et al. categorized the research on supply chain
finance so far according to main themes and methods,
proposed directions for future research, and completed a
related literature review, which puts forward twomain points:
a financing-oriented view and a focus on finance institutions
providing short-term solutions involving accounts payable
and accounts receivable; and a supply chain-oriented view
that may not involve financial institutions, but focuses on
accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, and
sometimes even fixed assets optimization of working capital
in financing. Gelsomino LM believes that this review accu-
rately represents the content of supply chain finance research
published within the specified time frame and has identified
the most important issues that need to be addressed in future
research. In addition, Gelsomino LM found, based on the
research deficiencies found in the literature, four key issues
that are marked and hoped to be resolved in future research.
+is study only carried out theoretical discussion, without
relevant experiments, and lacked persuasiveness [2]. Yao
believes that shopping companies must optimize the inte-
gration of their supply chain resources to provide service
capabilities, improve customer experience, and introduce
satisfactory customized services. +ese companies need to
determine how to achieve effective supply chain resource
integration based on different customized service models,
improve their resource utilization, and solve special problems
in the shopping process. Yao explored the dynamic balance
between supply and demand service capabilities by analyzing
the characteristics and service modes of supply chain resource
integration in shopping companies. +e discussion of these
capabilities not only considered traditional optimization
goals, but also looked at general services, emergency services,
and strategies. From the perspective of potential capabilities,
the applicability of resources is evaluated to achieve effective
supply chain resource integration. Yao JM regards the con-
sistency of the ability target orientation of resource partners as
an important optimization goal and evaluates this consistency
by identifying the ability characteristic factors and intro-
ducing them into the supply chain resource integration. He
also proposed an optimization model and an improved ant
algorithm to solve the supply chain resource integration
process. +is research procedure is relatively complicated and
not suitable for popularization in practice [3].
+e innovations of this article are to (1) propose algo-
rithms for supply chain financial risk evaluation and supply
chain financial game on blockchain for research; (2) research
on blockchain-based IoT technology; (3) design the Beibu
Gulf supply chain financial system architecture.
2. Methods for the Application of Blockchain
Technology in SupplyChain Finance inBeibu
Gulf Region
2.1. Blockchain Technology
2.1.1. Blockchain Definition. Blockchain is well known to
mankind and can be understood as a universally distributed
decentralized and intelligent platform in the network [4]. Any
node in the blockchain has a copy of the database, and each
block created is encrypted and stored with transaction in-
formation details; and when each block is created, and the
block is completed and transmitted to all nodes in the
blockchain, the time stamp is created, and all nodes are
notified universally. After each node updates the database, the
encrypted information cannot be changed. Even if the data of
a certain node is destroyed, the node will not be used because
the information of most other nodes is inconsistent [5].
+e official definition of blockchain is as follows:
blockchain is a new way of applying computer technology,
such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission,
consensus mechanism, and encryption algorithm. +e
blockchain is essentially a decentralized database. At the same
time, as the basic technology of Bitcoin, it is a series of data
blocks related to encryption. +e data block contains a batch
of Bitcoin transaction information, which is used to verify the
validity of the information and create the next block [6]. +e
blockchain is composed of multiple blocks, which are auto-
matically formed according to the creation time. It is not
based on other institutions to provide credit ratings but uses
encryption and computer science as a means to ensure se-
curity to create a corresponding secure public database. +e
blocking chain was found to be a technical means to make
decentralized data accounts safe and public [7].
2.1.2. Features of Blockchain
(i) Decentralization. Decentralization is the core feature of
blockchain, and it is also impossible to achieve with other
technologies. Information transmission, distributed storage,
maintenance, and other operations in the blockchain no
longer need to be processed by the central server but rely on
the common maintenance of each node in the network node
[8].
(ii) Distributed Ledger and Storage. Due to the decentral-
ization of the blockchain, each node adopts distributed
accounting storage; that is, each node has a general ledger.
After each node uploads and downloads the information, a
new block is created through encryption. +e establishment
of each block will be notified to all nodes on the chain
through broadcast, and the generation of this block will be
recorded together. All the ledgers of all nodes are updated
once to maintain the consistency of all the node ledgers [9].
2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
(iii) Smart Contract. +e smart contract is formed by the
system program setting. It can complete the recognition,
judgment, generation behavior, execution, and other pro-
cedures by starting a certain condition. It does not require
human setting operations, automatically generates the
business of adding data, and cannot modify or delete other
data, effectively avoiding the interference caused by the
external environment [10].
(iv) Traceability. +e blockchain adds a time stamp to the
generation of each block by adding a time stamp and ex-
pands the blockchain according to the sequence of gener-
ation time. Time is unique, so after adding the time stamp,
double recording can be avoided, and the time stamp cannot
be tampered with or deleted after it is generated [11].
(v) Security. Each information processing of the blockchain
will be encrypted by the hash algorithm in asymmetric
cryptography to generate a string of fixed-length characters,
supplemented with a time stamp, and jointly ensure
uniqueness [12].
2.2. Evaluation of Supply Chain Financial Risks on Blockchain
2.2.1. Judgment Matrix. In the analytic hierarchy process, if
there are n influencing factors of I in the criterion layer, that
is, there are n factors in the sublevel of I, then the corre-
sponding judgment matrix affecting criterion I is an n × n
matrix. According to the construction of the judgment
matrix of the analytic hierarchy process, in the level analysis
of the supply chain financial risk on the blockchain, it can be
assumed that the total risk of the system is I, and the first-
level indicator of the supply chain financial risk evaluation
on the blockchain is Ii � I1, I2, . . . , Ii􏼈 􏼉, and the second-level
indicator is Iin � Ii1, Ii2, . . . , Iin􏼈 􏼉, and the third-level indi-
cator is Iinm � Iin1, Iin2, . . . , Iinm􏼈 􏼉 [13]. +e importance of
each influencing factor to the upper level can be determined
by quantitative indicators. For any secondary index, its
judgment matrix is the matrix formed by comparing the
various influencing factors below the index [14]. Suppose
that the order of the judgment matrix of Iin is m, and Ic d is
the importance ratio of the third-level index Iincand the
third-level index Iin d to the second-level index Iin, and the
following relationship exists:
Ic d > 0,

2.2.2. Calculation of Relative Weight. In the second step of
calculating the relative weight, suppose that the third-level
indicator of supply chain financial risk on the blockchain is
Iin1, Iin2, . . . , Iinm, and the corresponding second-level in-
dicator is Iin weight Win1, Win2, . . . , Winm [15]. Using geo-
metric average method for calculation, the formula is as
follows.
First, calculate the product Mc of each row of the matrix:
Mc � 􏽙

2.2.3. Consistency Test of Judgment Matrix. +e third step is
the consistency test. +e rationality of the judgment matrix
depends on the consistency test. +e consistency test can
avoid the strong randomness of the judgment matrix
without losing the significance of its judgment [16]. Firstly,
the new matrix CV is obtained by multiplying the judgment
matrix and the relative weight coefficient vector, and then
the maximum eigenvalue λmax of the CV is calculated, and
then the value of the consistency index (C.I.) is calculated.
When the order of the matrix is greater than 2, the value of
C.I. is calculated:
λmax �

. (6)
It is generally believed that as long as the value of C.I. is
not greater than 0.1, the consistency is considered accept-
able. If it is greater than 0.1, it is considered that the con-
sistency is not good enough. Some evaluations may be
random and not considered seriously. However, when the
order of the matrix increases, its consistency tends to de-
crease; that is, it will be greater than 0.1, so the randomness
index (RIndom Index, RI) is generally used to check the
consistency of the judgment matrix. RI is a function of the
order n of the matrix. It increases as the order increases. +e
order of the matrix is brought into the table of RI values, and
the corresponding value is obtained to calculate the value of
the consistency ratio C.R. [17, 18].

+e method part of this article uses the above method to
study the application of blockchain technology in supply
chain finance in the Beibu Gulf region.+e specific process is
shown in Table 1.
3. Application Research Experiment of
Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain
Finance in Beibu Gulf
3.1. Research on Internet of 6ings Technology Based on
Blockchain
3.1.1. New Block Structure Design. Blockchain is funda-
mentally different from traditional transaction networks and
has a variety of special characteristics [21]. +eir key
functions include encryption (asymmetric encryption),
hashing, chaining blocks, and smart contracts. Blockchain
transactions represent the interaction between two parties.
For encrypted currencies, transactions represent the trans-
mission of encrypted currencies between blockchain users.
+ese transactions can also refer to the transmission or
recording of messages. Each block in the blockchain can
contain one or more transactions, and the block structure is
designed according to the block’s things [22].
+e general blockchain is a decentralized, distributed,
and public number composed of blocks. In general, each
block is connected to a collection of transactions with a time
stamp. It can be seen that this technology allows nodes to
exchange data by creating transactions. Each transaction
depends on another transaction. +e output of one trans-
action is referenced as input in another transaction, thereby
creating a chain structure in it [23].
+e essence of the blockchain is a distributed database
(account book). +e block header is equivalent to the index
of the data account book, and the block body records specific
transactions. For the Internet of +ings environment, the
traditional block is no longer suitable for the Internet of
+ings environment. +e block design does not match this
direction, resulting in a large amount of redundancy at the
data structure level, which will inevitably lead to a waste of
resources for operations such as fast access to the chain and
update of the new area [24]. For example, the block structure
of Ethereum is more suitable for money transactions and
does not pay attention to physical devices. +is creates a
certain conflict with the environment of a large number of
physical devices such as the Internet of +ings. Due to the
particularity of the IoT environment, IoT devices may not
have high computing power. Compared with the computing
and storage capabilities required as an Ethereum node, to be
applied to the IoT environment, it is necessary to reduce
computing overhead and reduce calculations and power
dependence [25].
3.1.2. Authentication Interaction Based on New Blocks.
+e transaction authentication and interaction process of
the entire system is divided into two steps, zero-knowledge
entry chain and secondary authentication during interac-
tion. +e zero-knowledge proof, such as entering the chain,
is a necessary condition for joining this IoT blockchain
system, and the second identity authentication occurs when
two gateway nodes exchange data [26].
+e first time the new gateway node enters the chain it
uses a zero-knowledge proof algorithm to write information
such as the device number, Diffie-Helman field, and enve-
lope encryption public key into the blockchain. +is time
authentication is necessary. +e zero-identification proof of
the more commonly used and constant data can ensure that
important data cannot be tampered with. At the same time,
these data are likely to be used extensively and frequently in
future gateway node communication. Data disclosure in
advance is helpful for mutual trust and communication
security between gateway nodes. After the data is written, the
second authentication is to use the data of the first
4 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
authentication to perform the second authentication when
interacting between blocks (gateway nodes). Take out the
relevant information and necessary cryptographic data of
the other party from the blockchain, and then you can carry
out secure data interaction [27].
3.2. Architecture Design of Financial System of Beibu Gulf
Supply Chain
3.2.1. Overall System Architecture. +e system is divided into
financial basic platform and business service platform from
the overall architecture design. +e financial basic platform
mainly includes the blockchain layer and the financial service
layer.+e blockchain layer is based on the Hyperledger Fabric
project to build a basic blockchain technology network layer,
which is used to carry data services such as data security
storage and data synchronization in the Beibu Gulf region
and financial services. +e layer mainly includes service in-
terface, operation, and maintenance platform backend, and
operation and maintenance platform front-end. +e service
interface is a service layer that provides business service
platforms in the Beibu Gulf region to quickly access the
blockchain network layer for data interaction; the operation
and maintenance platform provides services including blocks
operation and maintenance operations required by the chain
network and financial service layer. +e business service
platformmainly includes the backend of supply chain finance
and the front end of supply chain finance; its main role is to
serve as the platform layer for carrying various business
processes in the financial business, and different functional
modules can be added according to the specific business to
meet different functional needs.
3.2.2. Blockchain Network Architecture and Its Module
Docking. +e blockchain network in the Beibu Gulf region
mainly connects to the service interface module together with
the service interface to provide blockchain services to the
backend of the supply chain finance. +e blockchain network
includes member management, blockchain services, chain
code services, and distributed ledger modules. Member
management includes member registration, member review,
and member authentication functions; blockchain services
implement underlying consensus management and p2p
communication management functions; chain code services
implement chain code containers and chain code deployment
functions; distributed ledgers store data in the business
process. +e service interface includes four functional
modules: Fabric-SDK, authority management, certificate
management, and dispatch control, which provide an
interface for the backend of supply chain finance to imple-
ment the package and call of certificates and permissions.
Among them, scheduling control is the entrance to the
backend call of supply chain finance, calling certificate
management and authority management to determine user
identity and authority, and calling SDK according to the result
to realize the requested function; authority management is
responsible for managing role authority and functional au-
thority in the supply chain system; certificate manages the
certificate-related operations of platform customers.
3.2.3. Chain Code Implementation. In Hyperledger Fabric,
smart contracts are also called chain codes. +e chain code in
the system described in this article is the supply chain business
logic that controls the core enterprises, suppliers, and banks in
the blockchain network to exchange information or execute
transactions. Set up and get data in the blockchain ledger or
World State database by calling the chain code. Hyperledger
Fabric currently supports Golang and Java to develop chain
code. Since Hyperledger Fabric is developed in Golang lan-
guage, the system described in this article uses Golang lan-
guage that is closer to Hyperledger Fabric to develop chain
code. +e chain code development environment relies mainly
on Docker container and Golang language.
+is experimental part proposes that the above steps are
used in the application research experiment of blockchain
technology in supply chain finance in the Beibu Gulf region.
+e specific process is shown in Figure 1.

Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain
Finance in Beibu Gulf
4.1. Analysis on the Financial Development of Beibu Gulf
City Group
(1) Among the many quantitative evaluation indicators
for the spatial agglomeration identification of the
financial industry, the location entropy index can
measure the agglomeration level of the urban fi-
nancial industry development from multiple per-
spectives in geographic space, reflecting the overall
concentration characteristics of the urban financial
industry space. Based on this, this paper selects two
indicators, the location entropy index and the in-
dustrial city agglomeration index, and uses the
statistical data from 2016 to 2020 to determine the
degree of spatial agglomeration of the financial in-
dustry in the Beibu Gulf city cluster, as shown in
Table 2 and Figure 2.

On the whole, the financial agglomeration level of
the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration shows a
downward trend; from the numerical value of the
agglomeration degree, Nanning, which has a higher
degree of agglomeration, has a downward trend in
financial agglomeration; due to the decline of the
traditional industries in these cities, the emerging
industries have not yet developed. Under the dual
effects of the decrease in the inflow of external fi-
nancial resources and the outflow of internal fi-
nancial resources, the concentration of the urban
financial industry has shown a continuous down-
ward trend.
(2) +e development of financial development in the
Beibu Gulf Economic Zone is inseparable from the
regional financial center. Financial centers can play
the role of regional financial centers and promote the
effective integration of financial resources of regional
financial centers. +e GDP of central cities in the
Beibu Gulf region in 2020 is shown in Table 3 and
Figure 3.
As can be seen from the chart, Nanning in the Beibu
Gulf Economic Zone has the highest GDP and the
strongest economic strength. Nanning is the eco-
nomic center of the whole district, with the largest
number of financial institutions, complete financial
services, a high level of electronics, and the most
complete financial system.
4.2. Experiment Analysis
(1) Checking whether the judgment matrix is consistent
is a necessary prerequisite to ensure better hierar-
chical ranking, because an important criterion for
evaluating whether the importance ranking of the
subelements in the judgment matrix is correct is
whether the matrix is correct. It has logical regu-
larity. In the actual evaluation process, inconsistent
errors often appear, because the evaluator can only
make a rough judgment and cannot guarantee that
the judgment is sufficiently rational. +erefore, it is
extremely necessary to check the consistency of the
judgment matrix. Only when the judgment matrix
satisfies the principle of consistency and is logically
reasonable, can the result be further analyzed; oth-
erwise, the wrong conclusion will be drawn. +e
specific operation to check whether the judgment
matrix has consistency is as follows: first, calculate
the consistency index; then, obtain the corre-
sponding average random consistency index by
looking up the table; finally, calculate the consistency
ratio value and make a judgment. +e value of the
average random consistency index needs to be

obtained by looking up the table. +e first- to
fourteenth-order average random consistency in-
dexes are shown in Table 4 and Figure 4.
When the consistency ratio value is less than 0.1, the
judgment matrix meets the principle of consistency
and can be accepted and analyzed in the next step;
when the consistency ratio value is greater than 0.1, it
can be concluded that the judgment matrix does not
meet the principle of consistency. It must be further
revised before it can be used in the result analysis.
Finally, the index weight value of each expert is
calculated and averaged, and the unified weight of
each index is finally determined.
(2) +e value of the random consistency index (R.I.) is
shown in Table 5 and Figure 5.
When R.I. is greater than or equal to 0.1, it reflects
that the consistency of the judgment matrix is rel-
atively poor, and the judgment matrix must be
reformulated. When R.I. is less than 0.10, it reflects
the consistency of the judgment matrix and proves
that the judgment matrix is available. +e financial
risk indicators of the supply chain on the blockchain
all pass the consistency test required by the analytic
hierarchy process.
(3) +e number of times that malicious nodes are se-
lected as master nodes under different weight co-
efficients in the blockchain consensus mechanism is
shown in Table 6 and Figure 6.
It can be seen that when the weight of ownership is
not 0, three factors are considered comprehensively.
If the weight of the historical consensus score is not
much greater than the percentage of the node’s
remaining power, the ratio of the number of nodes
successfully participating in the consensus to the
total number of consensuses+e weight, the number

of times the malicious node is selected as the master
node will be the same as the algorithm in this paper.
When the weight of the historical consensus score is
much greater than the percentage of the remaining
power of the node, as well as the weight of the ratio of
the number of times the node successfully partici-
pates in the consensus to the total number of con-
sensus, the number of times malicious nodes are
selected as the master node is significantly reduced.
(4) For the blockchain supply chain financial system, in
addition to factors that affect system performance
such as CPU consumption and IO response speed, it
is often necessary to consider the delay of the client
initiating transactions, the processing delay of the
consensus algorithm, and so on. Since blockchain-
based systems use cryptographic techniques such as
one-way hash functions, asymmetric encryption,
etc., such calculations consume extremely high CPU.
In addition, because, in most consensus algorithms,
there is a process in which multiple nodes in the
entire system participate in the consensus voting,
this process will generate a large amount of network
communication, so the performance of the system

depends largely on the processing efficiency of the
algorithm.+e algorithm processing efficiency of the
blockchain supply chain financial system in this
paper is shown in Table 7 and Figure 7.
It can be seen from the data calculation in the chart
that the average processing time of the algorithm in
the blockchain supply chain financial system is 4.10
seconds. +e algorithm processing time is shorter,
and the efficiency is faster. It can be better applied in
the system to better evaluate the related risks and
make more suitable decisions.
5. Conclusions
Supply chain finance is mainly to provide financial solutions
for small- and medium-sized enterprises or small- and
microenterprises. +is business mainly uses core enterprises
as credit endorsements to serve their upstream and
downstream enterprises, so as to realize the cooperative
development between logistics companies, banks, and en-
terprises. +e distributed deployment of the blockchain can
ensure that any node in the network saves the same copy
information. +e data of each node in the network will be
encrypted by algorithms and data, marked with a timestamp.
+is feature allows financial institutions to unique and true
data can be obtained at the postloan management stage. +e
characteristics of the blockchain also guarantee the trace-
ability, anticounterfeiting, identity authentication, and other
issues in the financial transaction process.
+e Beibu Gulf region should keep up with the pace of
the times, cater to the development trend of my country’s
supply chain finance, speed up the resolution of the difficult
and expensive financing problems of Guangxi’s small- and
medium-sized enterprises, and actively accelerate the win-
win cooperation with Internet technology companies,
supply chain companies, and logistics companies. Small-
and medium-sized enterprises in the region and even across
the country provide high-quality and efficient financial
services, which effectively enhance the financial transaction
capabilities, core competitiveness, and risk control capa-
bilities of the Beibu Gulf region in Guangxi and increase
resources and profit for the development of the Beibu Gulf
region.

supply chain finance and the status quo of the development
