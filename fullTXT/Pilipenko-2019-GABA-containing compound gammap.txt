Abstract
Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, decreased glucose/energy metabolism, and dis‐
rupted neurotransmission are changes that occur early in sporadic Alzheimer’s dis‐
ease (AD), manifesting as mild cognitive impairment. Recently, the imbalanced 
function of the gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) system was identified as a critical 
factor in AD progression. Thus, maintaining balance among neurotransmitter sys‐
tems, particularly the GABA system, can be considered a beneficial strategy to slow 
AD progression. The present study investigated the effects of the compound gam‐
mapyrone, a molecule containing three GABA moieties: “free” moiety attached to the 
position 4 of the 1,4‐dihydropyridine (DHP) ring, and two “crypto” moieties as part of 
the DHP scaffold. The “free” and “crypto” GABA moieties are linked by a peptide 
bond (–CONH–), resulting in a peptide‐mimicking structure. In a nontransgenic male 
rat AD model generated by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) adminis‐
tration, gammapyrone (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg ip) mitigated the impairment of spatial 
learning and memory, prevented astroglial and microglial neuroinflammation, and 
normalized acetylcholine breakdown and GABA biosynthesis. In PC12 cells, gam‐
mapyrone protected against oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apopto‐
sis caused by the mitochondrial toxin di‐2‐ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Gammapyrone 
did not bind to GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors in vitro; therefore, we cannot attrib‐
ute its neuroprotective action to a specific interaction with GABA receptors. 
Nevertheless, we suggest that the peptide‐like regulatory mechanisms of gammapy‐
rone or its allosteric modulatory properties are essential for the observed effects. 
Since, the icv STZ model resembles the early stages of AD, gammapyrone, and/or its 
congeners could be useful in the design of anti‐dementia drugs.

1  | INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifaceted, progressive neurode‐
generative disease that includes several detrimental processes in 
the brain: neuroinflammation (Calsolaro & Edison, 2016; Pennisi et 
al., 2017); neurotransmitter system dysregulation (Correia, Perry, & 
Moreira, 2016); increased oxidative stress (Calabrese et al., 2018; 
Pennisi et al., 2017) and glucose and energy metabolism dysfunction 
(Abolhassani et al., 2017; Duran‐Aniotz & Hetz, 2016). All of these im‐
pairments result in the accumulation of amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and other 
misfolded proteins (Lithfous, Dufour, & Després, 2013). Promising 
strategies to combat AD consist of early interventions and disease‐
modifying approaches that can be implemented before the formation 
of Aβ plaques and amyloidosis (Liu, Chen et al., 2018). Thus, a search 
for novel cellular targets and therapies should aim to stop AD before 
it develops (McDade & Bateman, 2017) and shift the strategy from 
the treatment of late‐stage pathology to early stage pathophysiology 
(Styr and Slutsky, 2018). One such approach could be targeting the 
gamma‐aminobutyric acid ([GABA]ergic) system, since this system is 
able to stabilize the intracellular processes that are impaired in AD 
(Nava‐Mesa, Jiménez‐Díaz, Yajeya, & Navarro‐Lopez, 2014).
In this context, our question was whether a compound that con‐
tains GABA moieties would have a role in neuroregulation and restore 
cellular homeostasis. In this regard, we studied gammapyrone, a com‐
pound with three GABA moieties: one natural or “free” moiety attached 
to position 4 of the 1,4‐dihydropyridine (DHP) ring, and two “crypto” 
GABA moieties as part of DHP scaffold moieties (Figure 1). The “free” 
and “crypto” GABAs are linked by a peptide bond (–CONH–), and thus 
resemble a peptidomimetic structure (Klusa, 2016). However, we can‐
not ignore the fact that there is a double bond (–C=C–) between atoms 
2 and 3 and between atoms 5 and 6 of the “crypto” GABA moieties in 
the DHP ring; thus, the “crypto” GABA moieties can be described as 
unsaturated amino acids. Unsaturated amino acids are potential pre‐
cursors to the cross‐linkages in peptides and proteins (Gross, 1977).
Previously, DHP compounds that contained other “free” amino 
acids, for example, glutamate‐containing glutapyrone (Misane et 
al., 1998) and taurine‐containing tauropyrone (Dzirkale et al., 2011) 
have shown different activities in animal models. Additionally, 
amino‐acid containing DHPs differed quantitatively and qualita‐
tively from typical DHP agents (mostly antihypertensive drugs) by 
their high solubility, lack of calcium antagonism and antihyperten‐
sive properties, as well as very low toxicity and neuromodulatory/
regulatory efficacy at low doses (for review see Klusa, 2016).
In this study, we assessed for the first time the influence of 
gammapyrone in the male rat streptozocin (STZ)‐induced nontrans‐
genic AD model. A crucial difference between the STZ model and 
the more frequently used transgenic AD models is that the former 
mimics sporadic AD that constitutes 95% of all AD cases, whereas 
Significance
In this study, rat model of intracerebroventricular streptozo‐
cin injection was used to resemble sporadic Alzheimer’s  
disease (AD). We demonstrated that gammapyrone, a com‐
pound that contains three gamma‐aminobutyric acid  
moieties in its structure, possesses memory‐enhancing, 
anti‐inflammatory and neurotransmitter regulating activi‐
ties in vivo and protects against oxidative stress, apoptosis 
and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. These properties 
indicate the ability of gammapyrone to target the early 
changes that occur before amyloidosis. Gammapyrone and/
or its congeners could be useful in the design of novel  
disease‐modifying drugs for the prevention of cognitive  
decline in predementia AD stages.

transgenic models resemble the familial form of AD that constitutes 
only 5% of all AD cases (Grieb, 2016). STZ model mimics the early 
behavioral, neuropathological, and metabolical features of sporadic 
AD that share similarities with sporadic AD in humans (Salkovic‐
Petrisic, Knezovic, Hoyer, & Riederer, 2013). These features include 
impairments in brain glucose metabolism (De la Monte & Wands, 
2008), neuroinflammation (Rai, Kamat, Nath, & Shukla, 2014), ox‐
idative stress (Tiwari, Kuhad, Bishnoi, & Chopra, 2009), as well as 
brain mitochondrial abnormalities (Saxena, Patro, & Nath, 2011). 
These changes precede and eventually lead to tau and amyloid‐beta 
pathologies and are interdependent with pathological changes in 
the epigenetic mechanisms, namely: (a) aberrations of DNA methyl‐
ation, (b) histone deacetylation and subsequent chromatin remodel‐
ing, and (c) dysregulation of noncoding RNAs (Liu, Jiao, & Shen, 2018).
STZ model, therefore, represents a valid experimental tool to ob‐
tain new insights regarding both early and late brain changes which 
can be translated in novel approaches in the treatment of this disease.
We assessed spatial learning/memory with the Morris water 
maze test and of locomotor activity with the open field test. Ex vivo, 
we determined the expression of cortical and hippocampal proteins 
related to neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP; 
ionized calcium‐binding adapter molecule‐1, Iba‐1), synthesis of 
GABA (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, GAD67), and degradation 
of acetylcholine (AChE). In vitro, binding assays were performed for 
GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors. Neuronal PC12 cells were treated 
with mitochondrial toxin di‐2‐ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the 
effects of gammapyrone on DEHP‐induced oxidative stress and 
 mitochondrial dysfunction were also determined.
2  | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Animals
Male Wistar rats (280 ± 20 g, 9 weeks old) were obtained from the 
Laboratory Animal Center, University of Tartu, Estonia. In the STZ 
model of sporadic AD, sex differences exist; it has been reported that 
learning/memory impairments and several other pathological events 
of AD that were observed in male rats were not observed in female 
rats (Bao et al., 2017). All efforts were made to minimize animal suf‐
fering and to reduce the number of animals used. The experiments 
were conducted in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU 
and local laws and policies on the protection of animals used for sci‐
entific purposes. The animal protocol for this study was approved by 
the Animal Ethics Committee of the Food and Veterinary Service, 
Riga, Latvia. The animals were housed in polypropylene cages (five 
rats per cage) with food (R70, Lantmännen, Sweden) and water pro‐
vided ad libitum, and kept in a controlled laboratory environment 
(temperature 22 ± 2°C, humidity 50–60%, 12/12 hr light/dark cycle).
2.2 | Chemicals and antibodies
Gammapyrone was synthesized in the Laboratory of Membrane 
Active Compounds of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis 
(Riga, Latvia). Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was prepared 
ex tempore (mmol/L): 147 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 
1.7 mM CaCl2 and 2.2 mM d‐glucose were dissolved in water for in‐
jection. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich 
(USA): 3,3′‐diaminobenzidine (DAB, D5905), anti‐GAD67 antibody 
(sc28376), anti‐GFAP antibody (G3893), di‐2‐ethylhexyl phthalate 
(DEHP, D201154), ethopropazine (E5406), ExtrAvidin Peroxidase 
Staining Kit (EXTRA2–1 KT), haematoxylin solution (MHS16), and 
streptozocin (S0130). S‐acetylthiocholine iodide (A16802) was 
obtained from Alfa Aesar (USA). Copper sulfate (102790), potas‐
sium hexacyanoferrate III (104973), and sodium citrate (106448) 
were acquired from Merck Millipore (USA). 3‐(4,5‐Dimethyl‐2‐
thiazolyl)‐2,5‐diphenyl‐2H‐tetrazolium bromide (MTT), Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle medium (DMEM), horse serum, fetal bovine serum 
(FBS), phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), trypsin‐ethylenediamine‐
tetraacetic acid, penicillin‐streptomycin mixture and l‐glutamine 
were from GIBCO‐BCL (UK). 2,7‐Dichlorofluorescein diacetate 
(DCF‐DA) was supplied by Molecular Probes (France). The anti‐
bodies used in this study are summarized in Table 1.

2.3 | In vivo experiments
2.3.1 | Drug treatments
Animal group size was calculated based on preliminary study with a 
5% two‐sided significance level. To detect changes in spatial learn‐
ing/memory performance, six groups (10 rats per group) were used, 
whereas to detect changes in biochemical outcomes, five rats were 
used per group. There were one control and five experimental 
groups. Depending on the group, the rats received intraperitoneal in‐
jections of either saline or gammapyrone once daily on experimental 
days 1–3 (prior to the icv injection of STZ or artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid [aCSF]) and once daily on experimental days 15–22 (Figure 2). 
This design was chosen to assess the prophylactic effects of gam‐
mapyrone on the STZ‐induced changes. Behavioral tests on experi‐
mental days 18–22 were performed 30 min after the injections. The 
groups were the following: (a) saline ip and aCSF icv (Control); (b) 
saline ip and STZ icv; (c) gammapyrone 0.1 mg/kg ip and aCSF icv; 
(d) gammapyrone 0.1 + STZ icv; (e) gammapyrone 0.5 mg/kg ip and 
aCSF icv; (f) gammapyrone 0.5 mg/kg +STZ icv.
2.3.2 | Surgery
On experimental day 4, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 
(3–3.5% for induction and 2% for maintenance) in N2O and O2 
(70%/30% for induction and 50%/50% for maintenance). Animals 
were then fixed on a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Inc., USA). The 
head was shaved and sterilized with an alcohol pad, and a sagittal 
incision in the midline was made. Two lateral holes were drilled in the 
skull in the two ventricles using the following coordinates (Paxinos 
& Watson, 2007): −0.7 mm anteroposterior, 1.7 mm mediolateral 
and −4.0 mm dorsoventral relative to bregma. Using Hamilton mi‐
crosyringe, STZ was injected in these lateral ventricles (750 μg/10 μl 
in aCSF for each animal) at 1 μl/min and 5 μl per ventricle. Control 
group received bilateral injections of aCSF (5 μl/ventricle). For the 
diffusion of the substance, the microsyringe was left in place for 
2 min after each infusion. A 14‐day resting period was implemented 
for the development of cognitive deficiency. The exclusion criteria 
for the behavioral and biochemical tests were as follows: (a) changes 
in behavior (aggressiveness, changes in breathing (tachypnea/dysp‐
nea), decrease in movement, abnormal gait, inability to be handled); 
(b) negative impact of environment (diarrhea with/without blood); 
and (c) worsening of visual appearance (unkempt coat, weight loss 
more than 20%).
Altogether, 11 animals were excluded from the experiments: 2 
animals from the Control group, 3 animals from the STZ group, 1 an‐
imal from gammapyrone 0.1 + aCSF and gammapyrone 0.5 + aCSF 
groups and 2 animals from gammapyrone 0.1 + STZ and gammapy‐
rone 0.5 + STZ groups.
2.3.3 | Open field test
To assess the changes in animal locomotor activity, we conducted an 
open field test on experimental day 18 (n = 8 in the control group, 
n = 7 in the STZ group, n = 9 in the gammapyrone 0.1 + aCSF and 
gammapyrone 0.5 + aCSF groups, and n = 8 in the gammapyrone 
0.1 + STZ and gammapyrone 0.5 + STZ groups). The animals were 
acclimated to the experimental room for 30 min, and then each ani‐
mal was gently placed inside a round arena (d = 100 cm, h = 40 cm) 
for 10 min. A video tracking device coupled with EthoVision XT 11.0 
(Noldus, The Netherlands) was used to record the motility param‐
eters of total distance traveled (cm) and total time spent in the center 
zone (cm/s).
2.3.4 | Morris water maze test
The Morris water maze test was carried out to assess the spatial 
learning and memory of the rats 14 days after the STZ injection 
(n = 8 in the control group, n = 7 in the STZ group, n = 9 in the gam‐
mapyrone 0.1 + aCSF and gammapyrone 0.5 + aCSF groups, and 
n = 8 in the gammapyrone 0.1 + STZ and gammapyrone 0.5 + STZ 
groups). The apparatus (Ugo Basile, Italy) consisted of a blue circular 
tank (d = 180 cm) filled with water (23 ± 1°C) to a depth that would 
cover the plexiglass platform (h = 30 cm, d = 10 cm) for 1–2 cm. Each

animal underwent four trials (120 s for each trial) per day for four 
consecutive days. The animals were trained on experimental days 
19–22 to find the hidden platform from different starting points in 
the pool. Rats were gently put in the water facing the wall of the 
pool. As soon as the animal found the platform, it was given 15 s to 
stay on it to learn the location. The intertrial period was 10 min. On 
experimental day 23, the probe test was carried out. In this case, the 
platform was taken out of the pool, and each animal had to swim 
for 120 s in the pool. EthoVision XT 11.0 video tracking software 
(Noldus, The Netherlands) was used to register the following: (a) rat 
escape latency, that is, time in seconds for each animal to find the 
platform after being put in the pool, during trainings and (b) time 
spent in the target quadrant during the probe trial, and (c) the num‐
ber of platform zone crossings during the probe trial.
2.4 | Ex vivo assessments
2.4.1 | Immunohistochemical detection
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to determine the 
densities of GAD67 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc‐28376, 
RRID: AB_627650), GFAP (1:1000, Sigma‐Aldrich, RRID: AB_477010) 
and Iba‐1 (1:2000, Wako, RRID: AB_839504) in the anterior cingu‐
late cortex and hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA1) region. The lat‐
ter structure was chosen because more pronounced loss of CA1 
neurons occurs in AD, correlating with memory impairment (West, 
Kawas, Martin, & Troncoso, 2006; Zarow et al., 2005). On the next 
day after the probe trial, rats were deeply anesthetized with keta‐
mine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) and transcardially per‐
fused with ice‐cold saline for at least 10 min. After the perfusion, 
animals were decapitated, and the brains were removed and fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr. After fixation, the brains were 
placed in 30% sucrose for 48 hr for cryoprotection and subsequently 
placed in an antifreeze solution.
For each brain, 18 coronal slices per animal (30 μm thick, AP 
plane: Bregma −2.92 to −3.48 mm in the same animal) were obtained 
using a cryotome (CM1850, Leica Biosystems, USA). Free floating 
brain sections were rinsed three times in PBS and 0.1% Triton X‐100 
solution, incubated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 10 min to 
improve antigen retrieval (for GAD67 and Iba‐1), cooled to room 
temperature (20°C) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin 
solution at room temperature for 1 hr to avoid the formation of 
background staining. Sections were then stained with respective 
primary antibody (1:500 for GAD67, 1:1000 for GFAP and 1:2000 
for Iba‐1). After incubation with the primary antibody, the sections 
were rinsed in PBS‐T 3 times and transferred to a solution contain‐
ing the biotinylated mouse immunoglobulins (dilution 1:500) raised 
against GAD67 and GFAP and incubated for 1.5 hr. The Iba‐1 sec‐
tions were incubated with goat anti‐rabbit immunoglobulins conju‐
gated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) for 2 hr. After incubation 
with the secondary antibody, the GAD67 and GFAP sections were 
rinsed three times and incubated with mouse ExtrAvidin Peroxidase 
(1:1000) for 1.5 hr. After rinsing, the sections were incubated with 
PBS solution containing 2.5% DAB, 0.2% H2O2 and 5% nickel am‐
monium sulfate for 30 s (Iba‐1) or 1 min (GAD67 and GFAP). For 
Iba‐1 and SYP1, the sections were also counterstained for 1 min in 
hematoxylin solution. All stained sections were mounted on slides 
and coverslipped. Negative control sections were also stained using 
the same protocol but without the primary antibody. All experiments 
were done in duplicate.
2.4.2 | Histochemical assessment
For each brain, six coronal slices per animal (30 μm thick, AP plane: 
Bregma −2.92 to −3.48 mm in the same animal) were obtained. 
Histochemical detection of AChE‐containing nerve axon density in 
the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal CA1 region was per‐
formed using a previously described method (Karnovsky & Roots, 
1964), which was optimized and described elsewhere (Kadish & Van 
Groen, 2002). Briefly, brain sections (n = 5 brain samples per group) 
were rinsed with a 0.1 M maleate buffer (pH 6.0). Subsequently, 
the sections were incubated with 0.1 M maleate buffer containing 
86.5 mM S‐acetylthiocholine iodide, 30 mM ethopropazine, 30 mM 
copper sulfate, and 100 mM sodium citrate and 0.03 mM potassium 
hexacyanoferrate for 2 hr. Subsequently, the staining was intensified 
by incubating the sections with 2.5% DAB, 0.2% H2O2 and 5% nickel 
ammonium sulfate for 2 min in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.6) for 2 min. 
All experiments were done in duplicate.
2.4.3 | Quantification
The mounted brain sections (24 sections per animal per group) 
were digitized using a Pannoramic MIDI II Scanner (3DHISTECH, 
USA) with a 20X lens. The corresponding regions were then  
selected, and images were captured using Pannoramic Viewer 
(RRID: SCR_014424, 3DHISTECH, USA). The optical densities of 
expressed proteins were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex 
and the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region. All meas‐
urements were made in duplicate. Both immunohistochemical and 
histochemical data were quantified using an open‐source image 
processing software (Fiji, RRID: SCR_002285, Germany). A region 
of interest (same size for all samples) was chosen, and an automatic 
threshold (in arbitrary units) was chosen to detect pixel density. 
Densitometry was reported as the mean intensity in arbitrary units 
per studied region of interest.

receptor (α1, β2, and γ2) obtained from human recombinant cells 
(Wang, 2001). Compound binding was detected using scintillation 
counting and was calculated as percent inhibition of the binding 
of a radioactively labeled ligand specific for the GABA‐A receptor. 
Experiment was done two times, with each assay conducted in du‐
plicate. Inhibition or stimulation higher than 50% were considered 
significant.
2.5.2 | Binding to GABA‐B receptor
The brains from adult male Wistar rats (180 ± 20 g) were removed, 
embedded in cryoglue and cut into 10‐µm thick adjacent coro‐
nal sections (thalamic nuclei, cerebellum and hippocampus) and 
membranes were prepared as described previously (Bischoff et al., 
1999; Dambrova et al., 2008). In brief, membranes were incubated 
with the GABA‐B receptor‐selective radioligand [3H]‐CGP 54626 
(2 nM) and competing drugs (baclofen and gammapyrone) in 200 μL 
of Krebs‐Henseleit (KH) buffer for 90 min at room temperature. 
Gammapyrone was tested at 1, 10, and 100 μM concentrations. 
Non‐specific binding for each assay was determined in the presence 
of 10 mM baclofen. The bound and free radioligands were sepa‐
rated by rapid filtration under a vacuum using Millipore GF/C filter 
paper (Merck Millipore, USA). The filters were washed three times 
with 0.25 ml of KH buffer. Radioactivity of the samples was meas‐
ured with a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac MicroBeta TriLux, 
PerkinElmer, USA). Each experiment was performed twice, and each 
assay was conducted in duplicate. Significant inhibition or stimula‐
tion was considered to be that of 50% or higher.
2.5.3 | Cell culture
Rat PC12 cells (TCC® CRL‐721™, USA) were cultured in DMEM, sup‐
plemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, 1% l‐glutamine (200 mM), 
1% of mixture penicillin (100 international units/ml) and streptomy‐
cin (100 µg/ml) at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Before the experiments, 
cells were differentiated by culturing in serum‐free medium contain‐
ing 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 5 days. Protein concentration 
was quantified using Bradford colorimetric protein determination at 
595 nm (Bradford, 1976).
2.5.4 | Cell viability and toxicity assay
Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay, based on the abil‐
ity of living cells to metabolize the yellow tetrazolium salt to a 
blue formazan via mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase which 
is a member of mitochondrial electron transfer system complex. 
Gammapyrone was added at concentrations 1, 10, and 100 µM. 
Based on the results obtained from the cell viability assay, 1 µM was 
the concentration of gammapyrone chosen to perform DEHP toxic‐
ity tests.
PC12 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 96‐well plate) were incubated 
at 37°C after pretreatment with gammapyrone (1 µM) for 2 hr and 
then incubated with DEHP (83 µM) for 24 hr.
A negative control containing only cells was also evaluated. 
After treatment with gammapyrone, the cells were incubated with 
5 mg/ml MTT for 3 hr at 37°C, the medium was carefully removed 
after the incubation and the formazan crystals were dissolved in 
150 μL dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance of formazan reduction 
product was measured by spectrophotometry at 570 nm using an 
ELx800™ microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). The results 
were expressed as the percentage of MTT reduction relative to the 
absorbance measured from negative control cells. All assays were 
performed in triplicate.
2.5.5 | Determination of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)
To estimate the levels of endogenous ROS formation in control 
and experimental cells, the nonfluorescent probe DCF‐DA, which  
penetrates into the intracellular matrix of cells and is oxidized 
through by peroxides in the presence of ROS to form fluorescent 
2,7‐dichlorofluorescein (Chen, Zhong, Xu, Chen, & Wang, 2010), was 
used. PC12 cells were seeded on 24‐well culture plates (Polylabo, 
France) at 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 hr. Then, the cells were 
incubated with DEHP alone or combined to gammapyrone (1 µM) 
for 24 hr at 37°C. After treatment, cells were incubated with 20 µM 
DCF‐DA for 30 min at 37°C and washed twice with PBS to remove 
the excess probe. The intracellular production of ROS was measured 
by fluorometric detection of 2,7‐dichlorofluorescein oxidation on 
a fluorimeter (FL 800, BioTek Instruments, USA) with an excitation 
wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 522 nm.
2.5.6 | Measurement of mitochondrial membrane 
potential (MMP)
Changes in MMP were determined by the mitochondrial‐specific  
incorporation of a cationic fluorescent dye Rhodamine‐123 (Rh‐123) 
(Debbasch et al., 2001). The cells were seeded in 96‐well cul‐
ture plates and were treated with DEHP alone or combined with  
gammapyrone (1 µM) for 24 hr. Then, cells were rinsed with PBS, 
and 100 μL of Rh‐123 (1 μM) in PBS was added on the plates. Cells 
were incubated (37°C, 5% CO2) for 15 min. Next, the PBS solution 
containing Rh‐123 that was not taken up by the cells was washed 
and replaced by fresh PBS, and fluorometric detection was done. 
The results were expressed as the intracellular Rh‐123 uptake in  
arbitrary units. All assays were performed in triplicate.
2.5.7 | Preparation of mitoplasts
PC12 cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifuga‐
tion at 500 ×g and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). The cell suspen‐
sion was exposed to 2 mg digitonin/mg cellular proteins for10 min 
on ice. The mitoplast fraction, obtained by digitonin cell disruption, 
was pelleted at 14,000 ×g and resuspended in PBS (Signorile et al., 
2014).

2.5.8 | Enzymatic spectrophotometric assay of 
mitochondrial complexes
Mitoplasts were exposed to ultrasound energy for 15 s at 0°C. The 
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH):ubiquinone oxi‐
doreductase (complex I) activity was measured by quantifying the 
oxidation of 100 μM NADH at 340–425 nm (Δε = 6.81 mM−1 cm−1) 
by 50 μg of mitoplast proteins in 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM KCN, 1 μg/ml antimycin, and 
200 μM decylubiquinone The activity was corrected for the residual 
activity measured in the presence of 1 μg/ml rotenone (Piccoli et al., 
2006). Succinate‐cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complexes II+III) ac‐
tivity was measured at 550–540 nm (Δε = 19.1 mM+−1 cm−1) as the 
initial rate of cytochrome c reduction. Proteins (100 μg/ml) were in‐
cubated for 10 min in the assay buffer (25 mM potassium phosphate, 
pH 7.2, 5 mM MgCl2) in the presence of 20 mM succinate, 3 μg/ml 
rotenone, 2 mM KCN and 65 mΜ decylubiquinone. The reaction, 
started by the addition of 20 μM cytochrome c, was corrected by the 
residual activity measured in the presence of 2 μg/ml antimycin A. 
Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) activity was measured by quan‐
tifying the oxidation of 10 μM ferrocytochrome c at 550–540 nm 
(Δε = 19.1 mM−1 cm−1). Enzymatic activity was measured in 10 mM 
PBS using 30 μg mitoplast proteins (Cooperstein & Lazarow, 1951).
2.5.9 | Measurement of mitochondrial ATP 
production rate
The rate of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation was de‐
termined in digitonin‐permeabilized cells, essentially as described 
elsewhere (Valenti et al., 2013). Briefly, aliquots of trypsinized fi‐
broblasts washed with PBS were suspended in 1 ml of medium con‐
taining 210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM Tris/HCl, 5 mM 
KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 3 mM MgCl2 in the presence of the ATP 
detecting system (ATP‐ds). The ATP‐ds consisted of 2.5 mM glucose, 
two units hexokinase, one unit glucose 6‐phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6P‐DH) and 0.25 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos‐
phate (NADP+), with 3 μM rotenone as toxin and 5 mM succinate as 
energy substrate, as well as 10 μM diadenosinepentaphosphate as 
the adenylate kinase inhibitor (Lienhard & Secemski, 1973).
After 5 min of incubation with digitonin (30 μg/106 cells) at 37°C, 
the reduction of NADP+ in the extramitochondrial phase, which  
reveals adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation from externally 
added adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 0.5 mM), was determined as the 
increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Care was taken to use enough hex‐
okinase/G6P‐DH coupled enzymes to ensure a nonlimiting ADP‐re‐
generating system for the measurement of ATP production. The rate 
of ATP production by Complex V was corrected for the residual ATP 
production measured in the presence of 2 μg/mg protein oligomycin.
2.5.10 | Protein extraction and Western blot 
analysis for apoptosis proteins
After the treatment schedule, PC12 cells (1 × 105) in 6‐well plates 
were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in 100 μL lysis buffer 
(0.5 M HEPES containing 0.5% Nonidet‐P40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml 
aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) and incubated 20 min on ice 
before centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined in 
cell lysates using the Protein BioRad assay.
Equal amounts of proteins (30 µg) were separated on 12% SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently blotted onto 
PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). After blocking for 1 hr in TBS 
containing 5% nonfat dry milk at 25°C, the blots were probed over‐
night with the following primary antibodies: Bax (1:500, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, AB_626729), Bcl2 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 
AB_626736), p53 (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, AB_331741), 
caspase 3 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, AB_626803), and β‐
actin overnight at 4°C. The blots were then washed and incubated 
for 1 hr with the corresponding secondary antibodies: horseradish 
peroxidase‐conjugated anti‐mouse or anti‐rabbit IgG (both 1:3000). 
Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence 
using ECL‐kit (GenScript, USA). Proteins levels were then deter‐
mined by computer‐assisted densitometric analysis using GS‐800 
densitometer (BioRad, USA). All assays were performed in duplicate.
2.6 | Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism® software (www.graphpad.com, RRID: 
SCR_002798) was used to conduct the statistical analysis. All data 
are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) values. All data 
were subjected to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality and 
an equal variance test. The Morris water maze training data were 
analyzed using two‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated 
measures to account for inter‐group variations (with group and 
training day as factors) and were followed by Holm‐Sidak’s multiple 
comparisons test. Data from the Morris water maze trainings were 
examined for outliers (>2 standard deviations of the mean); no values 
that met this criterion were found. The Morris water maze probe trial 
and open field data, as well as the quantitative immunohistochemi‐
cal and histochemical data, were analyzed using one‐way ANOVA 
followed by Holm‐Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. In vitro data (in 
PC12 cells) were analyzed using one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

gammapyrone in dose 0.1 mg/kg demonstrated significantly shorter 
escape latency than STZ rats on training day 2 (p = 0.03) and day 4 
(p < 0.001). Treatment with 0.5 mg/kg gammapyrone also resulted 
in significantly shorter escape latency of STZ rats versus STZ group 
on training day 2 (p < 0.001), day 3 (p = 0.009) and day 4 (p < 0.001). 
Differences between groups were discovered also in the probe trial 
parameters: platform crossings (F5,43 = 3.6, p = 0.009, Figure 3b) and 
time spent in the platform quadrant (F5,43 = 3.8, p = 0.006, Figure 3c). 
Rats treated with STZ crossed the platform zone less (p = 0.02) and 
spent markedly less time in the platform quadrant (p = 0.02) than 
the controls. STZ animals treated with gammapyrone at 0.1 mg/kg 
demonstrated more platform crossings (p = 0.009) as well as longer 
time spent in the target quadrant (p = 0.005) in comparison to STZ 
group rats. STZ animals treated with gammapyrone at 0.5 mg/kg 
also showed more platform crossings (p = 0.001) and spent longer 
time in the target quadrant (p = 0.007) compared to the STZ group.

No significant differences were observed between groups in the 
total distance traveled (F5,43 = 0.9, p = 0.5) and time spent in the 
center zone (F5,43 = 1.2, p = 0.3) (data not shown). For the total dis‐
tance traveled, the mean values were as follows: control 447.4 cm; 
gammapyrone 0.1 + aCSF: 513.6 cm; gammapyrone 0.5 + aCSF: 
414.3 cm; STZ: 376.9 cm; gammapyrone 0.1 + STZ: 638.5 cm; gam‐

Significant differences in GFAP density were found between groups 
in the cortex (F5,18 = 17.1, p < 0.0001) and in the hippocampus 
(F5,18 = 6.6, p = 0.0012). Compared to the controls, STZ induced 
a sharp, almost twofold increase in GFAP density in the cor‐
tex (p < 0.0001, Figure 4b) and in the hippocampus (p = 0.0014, 
Figure 4d). A significantly lower cortical GFAP density was observed 
in STZ‐injected rats treated with gammapyrone at 0.1 (p < 0.0001) 
and 0.5 mg/kg (p = 0.0004) compared to the STZ‐treated rats. 
Treatment with gammapyrone at both doses also significantly  
reversed STZ‐increased GFAP density in the hippocampus 
(p < 0.01).
Neither of the gammapyrone treatments per se influenced corti‐
cal or hippocampal GFAP densities.

also significantly increased GAD67 density of STZ rats in the cortex 
(p = 0.0242) and in the hippocampus (p = 0.0398) compared to the 
STZ group.
3.2.4 | Gammapyrone reduced the STZ‐induced 
increase in AChE density
Cortical nerve axon density of AChE was significantly differ‐
ent between groups (F5,18 = 4.6, p = 0.0004, Figure 7b), as well as 
hippocampal (F5,18 = 8.0, p = 0.0005, Figure 7d). Administration 
of STZ resulted in a significant increase in AChE density in the 
rat cortex (p = 0.0188, Figure 7b) and hippocampus (p = 0.0018, 
Figure 7d) compared to controls. Gammapyrone 0.1 mg/kg signifi‐
cantly reduced the elevated AChE density induced by STZ in the 
cortex (p = 0.0003) and hippocampus (p = 0.0002) and at 0.5 mg/kg 
also (p = 0.0001 in the cortex and p = 0.0005 in the hippocampus).

3.3 | Influence of gammapyrone in vitro
3.3.1 | Binding of gammapyrone to GABA‐A and 
GABA‐B receptors
Gammapyrone did not show significant inhibition of [3H]muscimol‐
specific binding. At 100 μM, gammapyrone was able to inhibit [3H]
muscimol‐specific binding only by 19.3% (data not shown). Even 
lower inhibition was observed in case of a selective GABA‐B recep‐
tor antagonist [3H]‐CGP 54626‐specific binding, at 100 μM reaching 
only 8.4% (data not shown).
3.3.2 | Influence of gammapyrone on cell viability in 
PC12 cells
Gammapyrone demonstrated negligible lowering of cell viability at 
1–10 μM versus basic level (0 μM), but a sharp decrease was ob‐
served at 100 μM (p < 0.001, Figure 8a). DEHP induced a twofold 
decrease in cell viability compared to control (p < 0.001, Figure 8b). 
At nontoxic concentration of 1 μM gammapyrone was capable to 
significantly improve the viability of DEHP‐treated cells (p < 0.05, 
Figure 8b).
3.3.3 | Influence of gammapyrone on 
ROS production, mitochondrial membrane 
potential, and the activity of mitochondrial complexes 
in PC12 cells
In PC12 cells, treatment with DEHP resulted in significantly increased 
2,7‐dichlorofluorescein oxidation (p < 0.001, Figure 9a) and de‐
creased uptake of Rh‐123 compared to control (p < 0.001, Figure 9b). 
DEHP also decreased the activity of all mitochondrial complexes 
(Figure 10a–d): complex I (p < 0.001), complex II+III (p < 0.001), 
complex IV (p < 0.01) and complex V (p < 0.01). In DEHP‐treated 
cells, gammapyrone at 1 µM showed significantly lower fluores‐
cence (p < 0.001, Figure 9a), an increase in Rh‐123 uptake (p < 0.001, 
Figure 9b), as well as significantly higher activities of all mitochon‐
drial complexes (p < 0.05, Figure 10a–c, p < 0.01, Figure 10d) com‐
pared to the DEHP‐treated cells. Gammapyrone per se demonstrated 
lower values of Rh‐123 uptake (p < 0.01, Figure 9b) versus control.

3.3.4 | Influence of gammapyrone on 
apoptosis markers
Western blot data demonstrated that DEHP induced a significant 
increase in the density of the apoptosis marker Bax (p < 0.001, 
Figure 11b), significantly reduced the density of Bcl2 (p < 0.001, 
Figure 11a,c) and produced a sharp increase in caspase 3 and p53 
density (p < 0.001, Figure 11c, f, g, respectively). Gammapyrone was 
able to significantly reduce the DEHP‐induced increase in the den‐
sity of Bax (p < 0.01, Figure 11a, b), caspase 3 and p53 (p < 0.001, 
Figure 11c, e, f, and g, respectively), but did not influence Bcl2 den‐
sity (Figure 11a, c). Gammapyrone per se did not alter the densities 
of Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3, but significantly decreased p53 density 
compared to the control (p < 0.01, Figure 11f, g).
4  | DISCUSSION
4.1 | Gammapyrone effects on the GABAergic 
system in a male rat AD model
For a long time, the role of GABAergic system in the pathological 
processes observed in AD was not considered to be important, 
however, recent reviews demonstrated that the dysfunction of 
this system plays a major role in the development of neurodegen‐
erative processes (Calvo‐Flores Guzmán et al., 2018; Nava‐Mesa 
et al., 2014). It is now well‐known that GABA, in addition to glu‐
tamate, maintains the excitatory/inhibitory balance, and plays a 
compensatory role in memory processing (Lanctôt, Herrmaan, 
Mazzotta, Khan, & Ingber, 2004; Obata, 2013). The importance of 
GABAergic pathways in remodeling of the AD brain has also been 
suggested and highlights its role in compensating for the learning 
and memory impairments in the early stages of AD (Govindpani et 
al., 2017). Therefore, the GABAergic system is an essential target 
for the design of novel disease‐modifying drugs, although its role 
in the disease pathogenesis and the cellular changes underlying AD 
has not been extensively studied (Calvo‐Flores Guzmán et al., 2018).
In this context, we examined gammapyrone, a compound con‐
taining peptide‐like structure (“free” GABA connected to the DHP 
ring‐embedded “crypto” GABA). In the first report on gammapyrone 
(Misāne et al., 1993), this compound, at a low ip dose of 0.005 mg/
kg in naïve rats, was found to enhance memory in the conditioned 
avoidance response test, and this effect was associated with neu‐
romodulation that manifested as increases in the levels of GABA, 
noradrenaline, and 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cortex and 
hypothalamus.
In the present study, we used a single icv injection of STZ to 
produce the rapid onset of AD‐related symptoms, including neu‐
roinflammation, oxidative stress, glucose hypometabolism, and 
neurotransmission disruption (Salkovic‐Petrisic et al., 2013). These 
changes result in learning/memory impairments within 1 week 
after the injection and amyloidosis occurs three weeks after the 
injection (Paidi et al., 2015). Therefore, this model provides an op‐
portunity to assess novel neuroprotective compounds with a disease‐ 
modifying potential and offers better predictive value in translating

the obtained results to humans (Salkovic‐Petrisic et al., 2013). One of 
the limitations of the current study was the use of single sex—male—
rats. However, Bao previously reported that the sex differences in 
STZ rats exist by demonstrating lack of learning and memory impair‐
ments, amyloidosis, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic, and den‐
dritic plasticity loss in female STZ rats (Bao et al., 2017).

We administered gammapyrone at doses that were compara‐
tively low for DHPs (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). In the Morris water maze 
test, both doses improved spatial learning by significantly shorten‐
ing the escape latency in STZ‐treated animals. Spatial memory was 
preserved, as demonstrated by a marked increase in platform zone 
crossings and the time spent in the platform quadrant. However, in 
the open field, no influence on locomotor activity was observed; the 
total distance traveled and the time spent in the center zone was not 
different between animals. Furthermore, gammapyrone reversed 
the cortical and hippocampal expression of GAD67 in STZ‐injected 
animals to the control levels, indicating the ability to normalize 
GABA synthesis.
Interestingly, the enhancement of memory and normalization of 
GAD67 in this study were similar to that observed in our previous 
investigations of GABA receptor agonists (Pilipenko et al., 2018, 
2019). Thus, muscimol (GABA‐A GABA site), baclofen (GABA‐B), 
and diazepam (GABA‐A benzodiazepine site) were used at very 
low (subsedative) doses (ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg) that 
were approximately 100 times lower than those inducing memory 
impairments. These data allowed us to suggest that the actions of 
low doses of GABA receptor agonists may be mediated by allosteric 
sites or nonspecific regulatory proteins. We propose that gamma‐
pyrone might also act as an allosteric modulator, since in our study, 
it did not bind to GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors. This indicates 
that specific binding to GABA receptors is not the primary mech‐
anism for the memory enhancing effects of gammapyrone in STZ 
rats. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the interaction of gamma‐
pyrone with some of the 18 subunits of GABA‐A receptor, which 
are identified in different combinations and exert distinct effects 
(Enna & McCarson, 2013). Moreover, the binding site for GABA 
and benzodiazepines has been found on the same protein complex, 
and a large number of cavities that are capable of binding different 
substrates and inducing protein conformation changes exist (Sigel 
& Steinmann, 2012). The complexity might also be attributed to 
the GABA‐B receptor and its subunits (Gassmann & Bettler, 2012; 
Marshall, Jones, Kaupmann, & Bettler, 1999; O’Leary et al., 2014). 
In addition, we might speculate that the activity of gammapyrone is 
also determined by its structural geometry, including the DHP ring, 
which may act as a molecular chameleon and exert potent actions 
interacting with different proteins located on ion channels, recep‐
tors and enzymes (Triggle, 2003).
Normalizing effects of gammapyrone on the expression of 
GABA‐synthesizing GAD67 led us to suggest that the peptide‐like 
component of its molecule is essential to the mechanism of action of 
gammapyrone. This might also explain the regulatory effects on the 
expression of other neuronal (AChE) and glial (GFAP, Iba‐1) proteins 
and mitochondrial processes (see below).
4.2 | Effects of gammapyrone on acetylcholine 
esterase expression in a male rat AD model
In our study, gammapyrone at both tested doses also normalized 
AChE expression in AD rat cortex and hippocampus, whereas STZ 
caused a dramatic increase in AChE expression. It is known that ace‐
tylcholine is the key neurotransmitter involved in normal memory 
functioning (Deiana, Platt, & Riedel, 2011), and that the loss of cho‐
linergic neurons occurs in early AD stages. Moreover, an increase in 
AChE activity leads to an even greater degradation of acetylcholine 
(Micheau & Marighetto, 2011). The reversal of AChE overexpres‐
sion indicates the ability of gammapyrone to regulate cholinergic 
pathology.
4.3 | Effects of gammapyrone on 
neuroinflammation in a male rat AD model
Gammapyrone also acts on neuroinflammatory processes, as it was 
detected by a convincing reduction of STZ‐induced astrogliosis and 
microgliosis in the hippocampus and cortex. Neuroinflammation 
participates in AD progression via the overactivation of glial cells 
(Członkowska & Kurkowska‐Jastrzębska, 2011; Ransohoff, 2016). 
Astroglial cells release gliotransmitters that modulate learning and 
memory as well as maintain synaptic plasticity in the cortex (Ding 
et al., 2007) and hippocampus (Jourdain et al., 2007). Overactivated 
astroglial cells, however, release free radicals, proinflammatory 
cytokines, fatty acid metabolites and prevent neuronal regulatory 
functioning, thereby inducing learning and memory deficits (Liu & 
Hong, 2003). Microglia also plays an important role in the main‐
tenance of normal neuronal functioning by continually monitor‐
ing their microenvironment and releasing multiple inflammatory 
mediators (Akiyama et al., 2000). However, when chronically ac‐
tivated, microglia secrete proinflammatory cytokines that further 
drive a vicious and self‐propagating cycle of reactive microgliosis 
that results in neurodegeneration (Akiyama et al., 2000). Therefore, 
pharmacotherapeutic approaches that protect against neuroinflam‐
mation are currently considered very promising for the treatment 
of various neurodegenerative diseases (Balducci & Forloni, 2018; 
González‐Reyes, Nava‐Mesa, Vargas‐Sánchez, Ariza‐Salamanca, & 
Mora‐Muñoz, 2017).
4.4 | Effects of gammapyrone on the mitochondrial 
functioning and apoptosis in PC12 cells
Another target for primary anti‐AD strategies is the manipula‐
tion of the bioenergetic pathways (Wilkins & Swerdlow, 2016) 
and/or factors that regulate apoptosis (Shimohama, 2000). AD is 
strongly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Correia et 
al., 2013). The relationship between mitochondrial impairment 
and neuroinflammation are still unknown, although it has been 
reported that these phenomena influence each other (Wilkins & 
Swerdlow, 2016). Mitochondria are an essential target that regu‐
lates protein synthesis and synapse remodeling (Devine & Kittler, 
2018). Moreover, neuronal and glial cell death due to apoptosis is 
a common characteristic found in AD patients. Neuroinflammation 
and compromised mitochondrial functioning are known to coin‐
cide with increased ROS concentrations that induce the overac‐
tivation of both astroglial and microglial NO synthases, resulting

in neuronal damage (Morgan & Liu, 2011; Verri et al., 2012). The 
present results suggest that gammapyrone protects PC12 cells 
against a variety of detrimental effects caused by DEHP, a toxic 
agent that induces cell apoptosis and mitochondrial damage (Zeng 
et al., 2012; Rowdhwal & Chen, 2018). The DEHP model was 
used to mimic mitochondrial dysfunction (Chen, Yang, Li, Chen, 
& Xu, 2011). Gammapyrone significantly decreased mitochondrial 
membrane potential in untreated and in the DEHP‐treated cells. 
Gammapyrone also normalized ROS production, reduced DEHP‐
induced cell toxicity and restored the activity of all mitochondrial 
respiratory chain complexes (I‐V). Moreover, gammapyrone acted 
as an anti‐apoptotic substance by regulating the expression of 
proteins involved in cell apoptosis (Bax, caspase 3, and p53). The 
fact that the toxic effects of DEHP were prevented by 1 µM gam‐
mapyrone indicates the potential to restore normal mitochondrial 
functioning in vitro.
4.5 | General conclusions
The obtained results showed that gammapyrone rescued imbalanced 
central nervous system functions in the nontransgenic sporadic AD 
rat model. The effects of gammapyrone treatment manifested as the 
enhancement of spatial learning/memory, reduction of neuroinflam‐
mation, and regulation of neurotransmission. In cell culture, gam‐
mapyrone prevented apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial 
dysfunction.
We suggest that the effects of gammapyrone are multifaceted; 
however, the mechanism of action and the precise target remain to 
be elucidated. We conclude that gammapyrone molecule and/or its 
congeners may be considered prototypes for the design of novel dis‐
ease‐modifying agents that target the early stages of sporadic AD.
