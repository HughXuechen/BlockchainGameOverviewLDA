Internet searches, pronouncements by 
CEOs, new books published, information 
technology magazines, podcasts, major 
software companies, industry analysts, etc. 
All seem to be in a blockchain frenzy…
How does blockchain work?
First of all, let’s take a look at how 
blockchains work. You can read Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s original paper at http://bit.
ly/31oG7ba for much more detail; this is a 
quick summary. 
If you look at any indicator of what the data management world is interested in right 
now, blockchain will be at the top of the list, writes Ron Ballard, database consultant and 
author.

BLOCKCHAIN:  
THE FACTS
AND FICTION
Bitcoin is what made blockchain famous. 
It is not the only blockchain application but 
it is the model for the others; it is by far the 
biggest, so you can assume Bitcoin in this 
description unless we say otherwise. 
Blockchain combines two mature 
technologies: the chain and the hash.
Simple chain structure
The chain structure has been used for 
at least 50 years in data management 
sofware. The simple chain shown here is 
not ‘blockchain’, it is just a chain of blocks. 
Each block is linked to the previous one 
by having a pointer value that matches the 
block ID of the previous block. If we want to 
change a simple chain, we can: we just add 
the new block and adjust the pointers. 
But blockchain wants to make the chain 
‘immutable’ so that once a block has been 
added to the chain it cannot be changed. 
Blockchain achieves this by making it very 
expensive to change the chain, as we shall 
see. 
Hashing
The hash is also a very old computer 
sofware concept, going back at least to 
1953.
A hash is a value that is calculated by 
applying some function to the series of 
bytes that make up a fi eld, a block or even 
a whole fi le. The hash value is usually a 
number. Using a particular hash function 
the same input will always give the same 
output. Let’s start with a very simple 
example. We could take the UTF-8 value of 
each character in the input, add them all 
up, divide the result by 256 and take the 
remainder as our hash. This is what we 
get for a few diff erent strings as shown in 
Table 1.
This hash function is very simplistic and 
can produce only 256 values, so we do get 
some collisions, as in the last two rows of 
this table. 
The hash function used in blockchains is 
usually SHA-256. In this case ‘256’ refers Figure 1

until the end of the chain. 
So, you can change a blockchain but 
if you do, then you have to change every 
block that follows, which costs as much as 
creating all the blocks in the first place. 
Since blockchain is immutable, there are 
other requirements that make it even more 
difficult to change. These include ‘proof 
of work’ and a ‘peer-to-peer network’ to 
validate the blockchain. 
The ‘proof of work’ is an arbitrary 
calculation that is done for every block that 
is added. The calculation is what produces 
the block hash and it is more complicated 
than the example given. In fact, thousands 
of hash calculations are required to 
produce the block hash. 
Bitcoin adds other complications to 
the ‘proof-of-work’ so that it really is very 
expensive to carry it out. The first peer to 
do this successfully gets to create the block 
to the number of bits in the hash, so we get 
2256 or 1077 possible values and the chance 
of a collision is unimaginably small. 
A blockchain
Now we can combine the simple chain 
and the hash to make a blockchain. This 
example is simplified but it still shows 
the main feature that makes blockchains 
‘immutable’. 
The first step is to make our block ID ‘A’ 
the ‘genesis block’. We make a SHA-256 
hash of the contents of the block: 
‘Block ID|A|Transaction|001|Transaction|0
02|Transaction|003|Pointer||’ 
Which gives us the SHA-256 hash:  
dfdba2bdb97e68127d817502c192f94cd25
1e5a5024aed96fb72864e.  
We now use this as the identifier of the 
block. We use the block hash of the genesis 
block as the pointer in the next block (our 
block ID ‘Q’). 
So now, we make a SHA-256 of block 
ID ‘Q’ including the pointer to the genesis 
block: 
‘Block ID|Q|Transaction|004|Trans
action|005|Pointer|dfdba2bdb97e68
127d8175ea200be502c192f94cd251 
e5a5024aed96fb72874e|’
Which gives us the SHA-256 hash: 
3c4374099d09d10d36545c5bf10db1eb2db
e36b936312b95ce9803c923d82c60.
We use the hash of block ID ‘Q’ as the 
pointer in block ID ‘R’ and include the 
pointer to block ‘Q’ in the block hash of 
block ‘R’. We continue up the chain as 
shown in Figure 2.
If we change just one byte in the data of 
block ID ‘Q’, then the hash of block ID ‘Q’ will 
have to change to make this block valid. 
Now block ID ‘Q’ has a different block 
hash. So, to make block ID ‘R’ valid, we 
have to change its pointer so that it points 
to our new version of block ID ‘Q’. 
We have to calculate a new block hash 
for block ID ‘R’, which means we have to 
change the pointer in block ID ‘Z’ and so on

Claims about blockchain
There are many claims made about 
blockchain. Most of them fall into the 
vacuous marketing-hype category, such as:
‘Through many of its unique properties, 
Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could 
not be covered by any previous payment 
system.’  — bitcoin.org
‘From frictionless supply chains to food 
we can really trust, learn how industries 
are revolutionising business with IBM 
blockchain. Let’s put smart to work.™’ 
— IBM
‘Create smarter, more effi  cient supply 
chains, reduce fraud, verify transactions 
more quickly and create disruptive new 
business models with Azure blockchain 
services.’  — Microsoft
‘Improve trust and effi  ciencies in a 
network-driven world with blockchain 
technologies.’ — SAP
‘Oracle blockchain platform securely 
extends your business processes and 
applications while enabling you to process 
business transactions much faster.’ 
— Oracle
‘For the United Nations to deliver better 
on our mandate in the digital age, we need 
to embrace technologies like blockchain 
that can help accelerate the achievement 
of sustainable development goals’. 
— António Guterres, United Nations 
Secretary General.
There are many breaches of truth in these 
statements. There are also some specifi c 
and testable claims:
• Immutable ledger (‘tamper evident’);
• low transaction fees;
• cryptographic proof;
• worldwide payments;
• fast peer-to-peer transactions;
• enables ‘smart contracts’. 
Before we look at these claims specifi cally, 
though, we must consider the show-
stopper for blockchain and that is the 
massive damage it is doing to the 
environment. 
Sustainability
We are in a climate emergency. To waste 
an amount of electricity equivalent to that 
used by Austria is a crime against our 
planet. Figure 3 gives several measures of 
the scale of this crime.
The statistics are for Bitcoin only, 
although; most other cryptocurrencies 
work in the same way. Ethereum is the 
next biggest digital currency and although 
it is signifi cantly smaller than Bitcoin, it 
is still very damaging, using the same 
amount of electricity as Luxembourg.
The organisations that create new 
blocks (‘miners’) are based where there 
is a large and cheap supply of electricity. 
For most miners that means China, 
where electricity is cheap and mostly 
produced using the worst method for the 
environment: coal. 
Blockchain ‘miners’ are in a massive 
international arms-race with one another. 
Those who can deploy the most computing 
power get to add the most blocks to the 
blockchain and earn the most Bitcoins. 
Proponents of Bitcoin say that the 
machines that do the work will become 
more effi  cient. But if they double in 
effi  ciency, the energy use will still be 
obscene. And they also say that the 
number and size of blockchains will 
increase dramatically. 
If the technology is used as widely as the 
hype suggests, then Bitcoin (and blockchain 
generally) will be signifi cant factors in the 
climate change disaster because they use 
so much power. 
This is enough of a reason to put 
blockchain in the technology waste bin 
right now and really does make the 
statement by the UN secretary general 
very problematic: he should know better. 
Other claims
I cannot imagine an advantage of any 
software system that would be great 
enough to make it worth the environmental 
cost of blockchain, but let’s see if any of 
them come close:
Immutable ledger
There are two problems with the 
immutable ledger:
1. It is not immutable.
2. It does not solve the problem of fraud.
There were supposed to be many 
independent anonymous peers keeping 
the blockchain from corruption. However, 
you can watch blocks being added to the

Bitcoin blockchain at https://bitaps.com/. 
You don’t have to watch for long to see 
that most blocks are committed by ‘mining 
pools’. If you can’t spare the 10 minutes 
or so that it takes to check this, then scroll 
down on the webpage to see the pie chart 
that shows most blocks being committed 
by mining pools. 
These pools are mostly in China where 
the state’s influence over business is much 
more powerful than it is in most other 
countries. The idea of independent peers 
has been subverted, so the blockchain 
is now vulnerable to an attack by a 
controlling miner. 
There have been many multi-million 
dollar frauds involving blockchain (see  
https://bit.ly/2vExPjV). The ‘immutability’ 
does not protect against fraud. Most frauds 
occur outside the computer system, in the 
real world. 
If the blockchain faithfully records 
a fraudulent transaction, then that 
transaction is still fraudulent. The 
‘immutable ledger’ is a blinkered techie 
approach which assumes that fixing the 
computer system will fix a problem out 
there in the real world. It doesn’t. 
Low transaction fees
When you submit a request for your 
transaction to be added to the blockchain, 
you specify the transaction fee. The miners 
then choose the transactions with the 
highest fees to add to the next block. The 
more you pay, the sooner you get your 
transaction in a committed block. So, 
transaction fees are very variable and can 
be high if you are in a hurry. 
But the transaction fees are tiny 
compared with the block reward and 
this shows the real cost of blockchain 
transactions. The block reward is currently 
about £100,000. Sometime around May this 
year, the block reward will be halved – this 
is part of the Bitcoin/blockchain design and 
has happened twice before. The value of 
Bitcoin increased each time. 
We don’t know what it will do to the 
economics of mining this time, but a 
decrease in transaction fees does not seem 
a likely outcome.
Cryptographic proof
Hash algorithms are used in cryptography; 
to provide a check on the content of 
a chunk of data; as a type of indexing 
and simply to provide a unique key in a 
distributed database. The blockchain is 
not encrypted. The term ‘crypto’ (with or 
without a suffix) appears to serve only the 
purpose of sounding cool and high-tech, 
when in fact the technology is not very 
sophisticated and is certainly not cool.
Worldwide payments
Bitcoin can do this. So can many other 
payment systems. The transaction fees 
may or may not be less with Bitcoin, but 
the environmental cost is several orders of 
magnitude higher with Bitcoin.
Fast peer-to-peer transactions
The peer-to-peer statement is just untrue. 
When you make a transaction with Bitcoin, 
you deal with miners, who can arbitrarily 
accept or ignore your transaction. You also 
deal with the blockchain software, probably 
via an app. There is still a ‘middleman’, but 
you don’t know who it is. 
As for ‘fast’, it takes an average of 
about ten minutes to get your transaction 
committed, assuming you paid a big 
enough transaction fee to get it into the 
next block. Typical international credit card 
payments are completed in less than a 
second. How does ten minutes qualify as 
‘fast’?
Enables ‘smart contracts’
There doesn’t seem to be much evidence 
of smart contracts actually existing at 
present. And there is no reason why such 
things cannot be implemented with other 
technologies. I have various automated 
payments using my bank accounts and 
credit cards: variable direct debits for 
example. The ‘smart contract’ appears to 
be more marketing fluff and is certainly not 
something enabled only by blockchain.
In summary
Blockchain is not a silver bullet, as the 
big vendors claim. They can make money 
out of blockchain consultancy, but if they 
had any integrity, they would advise their 
clients to avoid blockchain completely.
There are no exciting uses that could 
not be covered by any previous payment 
system. Even money-laundering is still 
possible with other payment systems, 
although it is easier with Bitcoin/
blockchain. Is this actually an advantage of 
blockchain?
Gambling on a highly volatile currency is 
what has sustained blockchain and allowed 
it to set about trashing the environment. 
Blockchain implementations that use 
the original proof-of-work (that is most of 
them) are a climate-change disaster and 
should be stopped. It is hard to see how 
they can be stopped now, but they should 
be. As individuals we can:
• Avoid any use of blockchain-based 
currencies.
• Write to politicians, charities (especially 
green charities), newspapers, climate-
change activists, to make sure they 
understand the environmental cost.
• Refuse to support charities that 
accept Bitcoin donations — move 
those donations to more responsible 
charities.
• Do not buy or commission a 
blockchain-based system (this is easy 
— you will save money too).
• Don’t say: ‘leveraging the power of 
blockchain’ or other such marketing 
nonsense.
• Do say: ‘how, exactly, does blockchain 
help?’
The views in this article are the 
views of the author and are his 
own personal views that should 
not be associated with any other 
individuals or organisations.
‘The “immutable ledger” is a blinkered techie 
approach which assumes that fixing the computer 
system will fix a problem out there in the real world. 
It doesn’t.’
