Abstract. Cyberprotection in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
includes three basic areas: security, privacy and trust. Security and
privacy technologies are related to mechanisms such as cryptography
or authentication protocols that have been extensively explored and
adapted to IoT requirements. However, new risks such as cyber-physical
attacks and novel distributed, and pervasive architectures reveal new
weaknesses where trust and reputation issues are the main challenges
to be addressed. Nevertheless, both, trust and reputation, are intrinsi-
cally subjective and distributed, and algorithms guaranteeing a dynamic
and efficient management of these properties tend to be computationally
heavy and complex. In this context, new trust and reputation services
for pervasive IoT deployments are needed. Therefore, in this paper we
propose a new distributed architecture for the provision of trust and rep-
utation services in IoT systems. The architecture is based on Blockchain
technologies and the composition of different conceptual models (cogni-
tive, computational, neurological, and game-theoretical) using stochastic
functions. The resulting probability may be employed by nodes to create
their own trustworthy subsystem. In order to validate the performance
and usability of the proposal, an experimental validation based on sim-
ulation technologies is provided.

1 Introduction
Internet-of-Things (IoT) [33] is one of the most powerful enabling technologies
for new and promising paradigms such as Industry 4.0 [5], Cyber-Physical Sys-
tems [7] or Enhanced Living Environments [15]. In all these innovative solutions,
software and hardware components manage large amounts of data which, in sev-
eral cases, may be personal and (then) protected by international regulations

such as the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) [28]. More-
over, most of these new technical paradigms are envisioned to be implemented
into critical infrastructures or applications [11], what makes them a potential
focus [1] for many different attacks: from traditional cybercrime to the new
cyber-physical risks [13] and cyber terrorism.
In this context, it is essential to protect IoT deployments using strong policies
and mechanisms. Traditionally, a protected IoT deployment needs to implement
technologies in three different areas: security, trust and privacy [16]. Security
mechanisms [4] include authentication and integrity solutions, which are already
highly adopted by current IoT technologies (mainly inherited from network tech-
nologies and protocols such as Bluetooth or ZigBee) [27]. On the other hand, pri-
vacy mechanisms, including cryptography and anonymization policies, although
they are not fully adapted to the IoT deployments and requirements, they are
also commonly implemented in many non-commercial IoT applications, espe-
cially lightweight versions of well-known algorithms such as The Onion Router
(TOR) [12]. On the contrary, trust solutions face a totally different situation.
Most common trust mechanisms nowadays are based on administrative schema,
or on a social understanding of this concept [6]; what makes very difficult to inte-
grate these technologies without deploying a large infrastructure or considering
a relevant and constant human intervention. Trust mechanisms typically include
two different aspects: intrusion detection and reputation. While intrusion detec-
tion requires, currently, large infrastructures and a great computational power
(the most recent and successful solutions are based on mathematically complex
algorithms such as artificial intelligence [20] and large data repositories); repu-
tation mechanisms are usually supported through a direct human intervention,
where users indicate those behaviors that are malicious, untrustworthy or, in gen-
eral, dangerous (and, based on that input, the nodes’ reputation is obtained).
In that way, both areas are clearly facing open challenges, which prevents their
massive use in the upcoming IoT deployments.
As a possible solution, new trust and reputation calculation frameworks and
mechanisms are proposed. However, these proposals tend to be subjective and
highly distributed, so innovative algorithms guaranteeing a dynamic and efficient
management of trust and/or reputation are typically computationally heavy and
complex [9]. Nevertheless, the increasing computational power of IoT nodes and
single-board computers, together with the universal access to the global Internet
granted by future 5G networks [29], are introducing a much more favorable
scenario for those new proposals.
Therefore, in this paper we are proposing a service-based trust and reputation
calculation solution. The proposed calculation algorithm considers four different
approaches or understandings of trust: cognitive, computational, neurological,
and game-theoretical. Trust, in or proposal, is not a fixed value but a probability
distribution, what represents in a better manner the intrinsic uncertainty of the
observations. Local calculations are then integrated into a global trust value,
which is obtained and updated using a distributed Blockchain network.

From a market perspective, the proposed solution shows a high applicability
as it can be implemented in all kinds of devices and IoT nodes (only common
mathematical operations are employed). On the other hand, several lightweight
implementations of brokers and Blockchain networks can be found, which also
facilitates the applicability of the proposed architecture in all kinds of commercial
scenarios.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the state of
the art on trust solutions for IoT deployments; Sect. 3 describes the proposed
solution, including the proposed architecture and the trust calculation frame-
work; Sect. 4 presents an experimental validation using statistical techniques;
and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.
2 State of the Art on Trust Solutions for IoT Systems
As one of the most relevant open problems nowadays, related to IoT systems,
trust and reputation calculation and management have received a lot of attention
in the last ten years. Many different proposals may be found, although in general
six different categories are typically identified [32].
The first group of works propose the introduction of Trusted Third Par-
ties (TTP) and authentication protocols [17]. In these schemes, trustworthy
components are those which are authenticated by a very secure middleware or
components known as TTP or secure enclaves [23]. Standard ciphers, keys and
protocols are deployed among all components [26]. In hierarchic network archi-
tectures, trust domains may be created and TTP may be built as trustworthy
gateways [21]. Although this scheme is very useful in client-server architectures,
in very distributed IoT deployments is very inefficient.
The second group of trust solutions for IoT deployments is composed of rec-
ommender systems. A recommender system may be of three types: content-based
filtering [30], collaborative filtering [8], and a hybrid system [19]. In general, in
all these approaches, nodes receive and analyze recommendations to decide with
which other nodes they stablish a connection (as people do in societies). These
systems can take advantage of the network structure, but they are totally reac-
tive and cannot be employed as a prevention solution. Moreover, this approach
requires a large human intervention and can be barely automated.
Works in the third group address behavior-based mechanisms. In this app-
roach, nodes monitor the behavior of other components and decide about the
connections they want to maintain or prune [31]. Although this scheme allows
nodes to perform simple local evaluations [8], (as in the previous case) it can
be difficult to employ this technology in prevention policies as collected data
are not enough for supporting predictions. Besides, this approach lacks a global
understating of trust for the entire system of the particular nodes.
In order to solve this challenge and enable the option of implementing pre-
vention policies and making predictions, in the fourth group of trust solutions,
mechanisms are based on metadata. Information such as the geographical loca-
tion of the ownership of nodes is employed to determine which nodes are untrust-
worthy and malicious [25]. This scheme is totally proactive, as malicious nodes
Distributed Trust and Reputation Services in Pervasive IoT Deployments 19
may be removed before they start operating, just knowing their metadata. How-
ever, the percentage of false positives in this approach is higher than in any other
previous approach (what reduces the system performance).
In the last five years, the Blockchain revolution has also affected the IoT
technologies, and different proposals to provide and support trust in IoT deploy-
ments based on Blockchain may be found [3,18,28] (fifth category). However,
in general, in this approaches all data from the nodes is exchanged through
the Blockchain network to secure it and make it trustworthy [2]. Although this
mechanism may provide certain level of trust, some works have reported dif-
ferent attacks and problems associated to this solution [10,22]. Furthermore,
the delay of transactions communicated through Blockchain networks grows up
exponentially, reducing the network performance in a very relevant manner.
Finally, and sixth category, many different hybrid approaches have been
reported. These schemes try to combine the advantages of different mechanisms.
One of the most common proposals includes a behavior-based solution together
with a TTP or middleware (in order to store local calculations and get a global
value) [14]. However, these solutions are still very weak against manipulations,
contrary to Blockchain-based mechanisms.

Therefore, in our proposal, we are combining most of these approaches into
an innovative distributed architecture. The solution is service-oriented and it is
supported by Blockchain, although not all transactions must go through this
network in order to preserve the system performance. Besides, trust calculation
20 B. Bordel and R. Alcarria
includes four different views (cognitive, computational, neurological, and game-
theoretical), in order to guarantee the reactive and proactive character of the
solution.
3 A New Trust Calculation Framework and Architecture
In this section, we propose a novel architecture for trust calculation in IoT
deployments. This architecture (Sect. 3.1) includes a Blockchain network for
global trust calculation using SmartContracts. Besides, nodes may perform four
different trust calculations at local level: cognitive (Sect. 3.2), computational
(Sect. 3.3), neurological (Sect. 3.4), and game-theoretical (Sect. 3.5).
3.1 Proposed Distributed Architecture for Trust Calculation
Figure 1 shows the proposed architecture for trust calculation.
Fig. 1. Proposed architecture for trust and reputation calculation
Distributed Trust and Reputation Services in Pervasive IoT Deployments 21
In the proposed solution, each IoT node may execute locally one trust calcu-
lation algorithm, among the four existing ones: cognitive, computational, neu-
rological, and game-theoretical. In general, and depending on the system con-
figuration, nodes may select the trust calculation algorithm in an autonomous
manner (according to their capabilities, knowledge, etc.) or the system adminis-
trator can do it. Any case, it is important to guarantee that all four calculation
algorithms have a homogenous presence in the IoT deployment (in order to avoid
biases in the global trust calculation function).
Nodes in the IoT deployment, on the other hand, are connected to the
global trust calculation infrastructure through a publication/subscription net-
work. This network offers a REST (representational state transfer) API (applica-
tion programming interface) and service, so nodes can relate with the infrastruc-
ture using HTTP messages. HTTP messages are easier to parse, send, receive
and process than bit-oriented protocols, although they show higher latencies.
Besides, HTTP messages are nowadays, the standard communication medium
for IoT nodes and deployments.
Using these messages, IoT nodes may subscribe to different trust services
and the updates on the trust values from other nodes, other trust calculation
algorithms and/or the global trust calculation infrastructure. At the same time,
the global trust calculation infrastructure (i.e. the Blockchain network) is sub-
scribed to all updates from the IoT nodes. On the other hand, when a relevant
change on the locally calculated trust values is detected by an IoT node, it can
publish the new results. All these message exchanges and pub/sub management
is controlled by a trustworthy broker acting as TTP. In fact, this broker requires
to IoT nodes and the Blockchain network to get authenticated and employ cryp-
tographic mechanisms to preserve the privacy and security of communications.
All nodes that cannot be authenticated by the TTP are automatically rejected.
Moreover, through an SmartContract acting as oracle, the Blockchain net-
work monitors and stores all updates about trust calculations done by IoT nodes
in the deployment. In that way, in the Blockchain network (using a second Smart-
Contract) there is an accountable tracking of reputation and trustworthiness of
all IoT nodes, from different perspectives (cognitive, computational, neurolog-
ical, and game-theoretical) and from different local analyses (as many as IoT
nodes are observing an analyzing the behavior of the given node). Each time this
not rejectable, transparent record is updated, a third SmartContract updates the
global trust calculation (using stochastic functions). Each time the global trust
values are updated, the Blockchain network generates an event, which is publish
through the pub/sub network. Then, all nodes are informed about the global
trustworthiness of all nodes in the IoT deployment.
With all this information (global trust and rejections caused by the TTP),
IoT nodes may define their own “trust domain”, selecting with which nodes they
want to establish a connection (see Sect. 3.5). Hereinafter we assuming rejected
nodes are not connected with any other nodes, and we are focusing on trust
calculation (both, at local and global level).
22 B. Bordel and R. Alcarria
3.2 Cognitive Trust Calculation
As said, each IoT node is locally executing one different trust calculation algo-
rithm. Each one representing a different perspective and understanding of the
idea of trust. In this section we are focusing of the cognitive trust Tcog.
Cognitive trust refers the reputation and trust supported by a priori beliefs,
and it is typically a function of the degree of these beliefs. In a technologi-
cal context, these beliefs refer the expectation of a node to have the necessary
competence, benevolence, and integrity to be relied upon [24]. However, these
qualities are not technical, but sociological. And then, they are inherited from
the node’s owner, location, etc. At them, they are inherited from the node’s
metadata.
Thus, given an IoT node ni (or target node) with an associated collection of
metadata MD(ni) (1), and a second node nj (or observer node) and a set of a
priori trustworthy metadata MD+(nj) (2), it may be calculated the cognitive
trust Tcog(ni;nj) for this pair of nodes (3).
MD (ni) = {mdk (ni) k = 1, . . . ,KT } (1)
MD+(nj) =
{
MD+
k (nj) k = 1, . . . , KT
}
MD+
k (nj) =
{
md+k,r (nj) r = 1, . . . , Rk,j
} (2)
Tcog(ni;nj) = Ptrust(ni;nj) =
KT∑
k=1
Rk,j∑
r=1
(αk,r δ[mdk(ni) = md+k,r(nj)] + βk,r δ[mdk(ni) �= md+k,r(nj)])
(3)
In this expression (3), the result refers the target node ni according to the local
observations of node nj . The result Tcog(ni;nj) must be understood as the prob-
ability Ptrust (ni;nj) of node ni to be trustworthy, considering the observation
of node nj . Besides, δ [·] is the Kronecker’s delta function and αk,r and βk,r are
real parameters to represent the degree or weight of the node’s beliefs.
Cognitive trust may be calculated before the system starts operating, but
needs the definition of a protocol to share the nodes’ metadata with the entire
system.
3.3 Computational Trust Calculation
Computational trust Tcomp is associated to the behaviors that follow the rules
and requirements of authorities in the IoT deployment. Typically, in topics
related to cyberprotection such as cryptography. Although, in most common
proposals, this vision of trust is only employed to enable or disable the sponta-
neous collaboration among nodes, it is also possible to define a more elaborated
metric for computational trust.
Thus, given an IoT node ni (or target node) communicating with a node nj
(or observer node), it may be calculated the computational trust Tcomp(ni;nj)
for this pair of nodes (4).
Distributed Trust and Reputation Services in Pervasive IoT Deployments 23
Tcomp(ni;nj) = Ptrust(ni;nj) =
{
1; k < Kth√
2 hi,j√
1+hi,j
2
; k > Kth
(4)
The proposed function for computational trust is a sigmoid, so it varies in the
interval [0, 1] as probabilities do. In this case, the result has also to be understood
as the probability of node ni to be computationally trustworthy according to the
local calculation performed by node nj .
In this case, k represents the time slots elapsed since the IoT deployment
started operating, and hi,j is a parameter representing the percentage of times
the node ni employed the correct cryptographic configuration (as indicated by
the TTP) when communicating with node nj (5). As this kind of behavior-based
trust calculation algorithms may need a period to converge, for all time instants
before Kth, node ni is considered trustworthy (so the capabilities of the IoT
deployment are not reduced by default).
hi,j =
k∑
m=0
ui,j [−m] · rm+1
i,j
ui,j [m] =
ci,j [m]
ti,j [m]
(5)
On the other hand, in order to introduce a temporal decreasing effect (past
events are less relevant than the recent ones), parameter hi,j is obtained through
a geometric sum, with a ratio ri,j . Then, the ratio ui,j [m] between transactions
with the correction configuration ci,j [m] and the total number of transactions
ti,j [m] in the m-th time slot is weighted according to its antiquity.
3.4 Neurological Trust Calculation
Neurological trust Tneu is the most traditional behavior-based approach for trust.
In general, nodes analyze the honesty of other IoT nodes in the deployment and
obtain a trust value according to the observed and past experiences.
In neurological trust, the observer node nj monitor the number of successful
transactions si,j [m] with the target node niin each time slot m. This quan-
tity is employed to generate a ratio wi,j [m] by considering the total number of
transactions between both nodes ti,j [m] (6).
wi,j [m] =
si,j [m]
ti,j [m]
(6)
However, as said in Sect. 3.3, the impact of past measurements must be lower
than recent evaluations, so all the partial results for every time slot are combined
in a geometric sum (7).
hi,j =
k∑
m=0
wi,j [−m] · rm+1
i,j (7)
24 B. Bordel and R. Alcarria
The resulting parameter, hi,j , depends on the selected ratio for this sum ri,j ,
which control the evanescence of the impact of past measurements. Finally, in
order to calculate the neurological trust, a sigmoid function is employed, where k
represents the time slots elapsed since the IoT deployment started operating (8).
Tneu(ni;nj) = Ptrust(ni;nj) =
{
1; k < Kth√
2 hi,j√
1+hi,j
2
; k > Kth
(8)
As in other previous calculations, this result must be understood as the
probability of node ni to be neurologically trustworthy according to the local
calculation performed by node nj .
3.5 Game-Theoretical Trust Calculation
Contrary to computational or neurological trust, game-theoretical trust Tgame
is a proactive approach. In this case, trust is obtained as the most rational
and probable value in the future, considering the past evidence, behaviors and
evolution of trust. In conclusion, game-theoretical trust employs a historical data
repository to predict the future values of trust.
Given an IoT node ni with a sequence of global trust values tr [k] (9), the
game-theoretical trust is calculated by node nj using the Lagrange polynomial
(10). After calculated this polynomial, the observer node nj can obtain the
game-theoretical trust in any future time slot knext using function L (k).
tr [k] = {tr [k] k = 1, . . . ,Kj} (9)
L (k) =
Kj∑
m=1
tr [m] · �m (k)
�m (k) =
Kj∏
r=1, r �=m
k − r
m − r
(10)
Each observer node nj may develop this extrapolation using a different num-
ber of previous trust measures Kj . The final result for game-theoretical trust
Tgame (ni;nj) will depend on the local values of Kj and knext (11). As global
trust values are points from an stochastic function, as in all previous calcula-
tions, the result Tgame (ni;nj) is understood as the probability of node ni to
be game-theoretical trustworthy according to the local calculation performed by
node nj .
Tgame (ni;nj) = Ptrust (ni;nj) = L (knext) (11)
3.6 Global Trust Calculation
Finally, all IoT nodes in the system send their local evaluations for the target
node ni to the global trust calculation infrastructure (Blockchain network), to
be combined in a global trust value.
Distributed Trust and Reputation Services in Pervasive IoT Deployments 25
Given the IoT deployment has MT nodes, at this point MT different trust
values trustij will be collected for each target node ni. Each one obtained through
a different mechanism and from a different local perspective. Then, in the global
trust calculation system, all these values are employed to create a unique prob-
ability distribution for each target node ni. Using the Laplace’s notion of prob-
ability, all values are grouped to define a discrete probability density function
Tglobal with YT points (12).
Tglobal[y] =
1
MT
card
{
trustij j = 1, . . . MT
... thy ≤ trustij < thy+1
}
with y = 1, . . . , YT , with thy ∈ [0, 1] and th1 = 0 and thYT
= 1
(12)
To do that, the cardinality card {·} function is employed to determine the
number of elements in each set meting a given condition, and limits thy are
employed to define the intervals for grouping the local trust values.
Finally, in order to inform the nodes about the global results using only one
real number (matching, for example, the requirement of game-theoretical trust
calculation algorithm), the non-central moments λz (13) or central moments μz
(14) may be employed, depending on the implementation.
λz =
∑YT
y=1 (Tglobal [y])

z ∈ [0,∞] (13)
μz =

4 Experimental Validation: Simulations and Results
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, an experimental
validation was planned and carried out. During this validation, two different
experiments were performed, in order to analyze the convergence time of the
proposed security mechanism, and the success rate when detecting the malicious
nodes in an IoT deployment.
Both experiments were performed using simulation methodologies and the
MATLAB 2020.B and Simulink suite. Using this numerical tool, one hundred and
twenty (120) devices were represented, each one executing a different application
and trust calculation algorithm. Besides, different amounts of malicious nodes
were considered for different evaluations. All simulation were performed in a
Linux architecture.
Simulated IoT nodes represented a common architecture based on the ESP-
32 microcontroller, WiFi communications and simple sensors such as temper-
ature or humidity. Trust calculation algorithms were distributed among nodes
in a homogeneous but random manner. Nodes also could behave in a malicious
manner randomly, but according to the configured percentages.
26 B. Bordel and R. Alcarria
All simulation were repeated twelve times to remove all possible exogenous
effects. Presented results are obtained as the average of all these partial simu-
lations. Simulations represented twenty-four hours of real-time operation in the
IoT deployment.
The first experiment was focused on the success rate of the proposed solution.
For different amounts of malicious nodes in the IoT deployment, it is analyzed
the percentage of them that are correctly detected and isolated.
The second experiment was focused on the convergence time. For different
amounts of malicious nodes, the maximum convergence time required to evaluate
all nodes and configure the final IoT deployment was evaluated.
Figure 2 shows the results of the first experiment. As can be seen, the success
rate is above 85% in all cases. As the number of malicious nodes goes up, the
success rate also grows up, although this effect is common to most technologies.
The most interesting result in Fig. 2 is the lack of any asymptote. As can be seen,
even if 50% of nodes in the IoT deployment are malicious, the proposed solution
does not get saturated and it is able to operate normally, detecting up to 98%
of malicious nodes.
Fig. 2. Results of the first experiment
Figure 3 shows the results of the second experiment. As can be seen, for
malicious nodes up to 10%, the convergence time is below one hour (3600 s).
However, from this point, the convergence time starts growing up exponentially.
For 25% of malicious nodes, the convergence time reaches two hours, and for
any number of malicious nodes above this limit, Fig. 3 does not show a clear
convergence. Any case, these results are acceptable, considering the convergence
time of other IoT components such as CO2 sensors.

5 Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper we propose a new distributed architecture for the provision of
trust and reputation services in IoT systems. The architecture is based on
Blockchain technologies and the composition of different conceptual models (cog-
nitive, computational, neurological, and game-theoretical) using stochastic func-
tions. Results shows the proposed technology presents a good detection rate and
convergence time. Specifically, success rate is above 85% in very situation and
for malicious nodes up to 10%, the convergence time is below one hour. These
values are acceptable for most IoT deployments, as they typically operate with
a limited number of nodes and generate information in a quite low speed.
Future works will evaluate the proposed solution in real IoT deployment with
commercial hardware devices. Although the proposed simulation scenario shows
a high precision, real deployments are affected by exogenous and unexpected phe-
nomena which may modify the results introduced in this paper. These impacts
will be evaluated in future works.
