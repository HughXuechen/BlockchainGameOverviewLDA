Abstract: This paper deals with the design of the secure network in an Enhanced Internet of Vehicles
by using the Blockchain Governance Game (BGG). The BGG is a system model of a stochastic game
to find best strategies towards preparation of preventing a network malfunction by an attacker and
the paper applies this game model into the connected vehicle security. Analytically tractable results
for decision-making parameters enable to predict the moment for safety operations and to deliver
the optimal combination of the number of reserved nodes with the acceptance probability of backup
nodes to protect a connected car. This research helps for whom considers the enhanced secure IoV
architecture with the BGG within a decentralized network.

1. Introduction
A connected car transfers data to others based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) commu-
nication technologies and it typically means that cars are equipped for Internet access
usually with wireless local area networks (WLANs). Cars have been evolved to support
enhanced driving aids for full autonomous driving by using the artificial intelligence
(AI) and its maneuvers [1]. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a superset of a connected
car which contains sensors, GPS, entertainment systems, brakes and throttles. The IoV is
a moving network which is made up of IoT enabled cars through the usage of modern
electronics and the integrated information to maintain traffic flow. Cars have evolved
from mechanical transportation to the smart vehicles with varieties of communication and
sensing capabilities. The IoV has developed over time from the conventional vehicular
networks that connect the smart vehicles to the smart city with the development of Internet
of Things (IoT) [2]. The IoV is designed to perform more effective fleet management and
accident avoidance [3,4]. An ad-hoc network is applied to connect IoT components as nodes
in a connected car [4]. Adapting the Blockchain technologies into IoV networks brings
huge attentions from researchers and developers because of decentralization, anonymity,
and trust characteristics [5–7]. Additionally, data sharing among vehicles is critical to
improve driving safety and to enhance vehicular services in IoV networks. The studies in
the security and the tractability of data sharing indicate that utilizing consensus schemes
are as hard as establishing Blockchain enabled IoV (BIoV) [6]. Some other studies have
proposed a decentralized trust management system for vehicle data credibility assessment
using Blockchain with joint Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus
schemes [7–9]. Vehicle manufacturers Volkswagen and Ford have filed the patents that
enable secure inter-vehicle communication through Blockchain technologies [10,11]. In the
view point of the IoT securities, several studies are dealing with similar topics regarding the
Blockchain based IoT securities [6,12–14]. Most studies are surveys [12] but none of them
are mathematically approached for developing a network architecture for a Blockchain
based IoT [13,14].

The Enhanced BIoV (EBIoV) network, which has been conceptually introduced on
public [15], is reloaded in this paper. The EBIoV is an IoV network architecture based on the
Edge computing [16,17] with enabling the Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) [18,19] for
improving network securities [15]. Although a public Blockchain is designed for empower-
ing their decentralization [20], current public Blockchain based services including cyber-
currencies are not fully safe from attacks especially based on the mining computation [18].
Hence, a private Blockchain which is a permission-based Blockchain [20] has been pro-
posed for business or government usage [21,22]. Many peoples are interested in a private
Blockchain technology even in a consortium Blockchain technology [20] but they are not
comfortable with a level of control compared to the offered control level in a public decen-
tralized network. More importantly, the control levels in a Blockchain network should be
balanced to retain the strengths of a decentralized network to avoid all security matters
what atypical centralized network contains [18]. By adapting the BGG, we do not need
to concern about the computation power for mining (i.e., generating ledgers) without
losing the strength from fully decentralized networks. A conventional BIoV model could
be applied to trace the provenance of spare parts back through every step of the supply
chain to its original manufacture date and location [15,23]. Car manufacturers concern that
service centers and garages are knowingly fitting counterfeit spare parts to their vehicles
of customers. Counterfeit parts shall damage a brand reputation when the parts become
causes of accidents. Identifying genuinity of car parts by using the EBIoV has been studied
and the network within car components shall be considered as an Edge network [16,17,24].
The Fog computing pushes information to the neighborhood area network amount of
community knowledge at an IoT gateway and it could be combined with the Blockchain
technology for enhancing security matters [17]. In the EBIoV network architecture, diagno-
sis equipment in car service centers is in a Fog network and the database in a headquarter
(HQ) is positioned the level of the cloud network (see Figure 1). This paper provides
the mathematical functional of the EBIoV network architecture for enhancing security
particularly from counterfeits of car parts. The EBIoV security regarding counterfeits of car
parts has already been studied [15] and this research is focused on avoiding conventional
IoV attack in a decentralized network. The BGG is the game model that an attacker and a
defender compete each other by building blocks in private and public chains as a sequence
of stages to generate ledgers [18,19]. The historical strategies and the probabilistic stage
transitions can be observed by both an attacker and a defender. Hence, the interaction
between an attacker and a defender can be modeled as a stochastic game [18,19,25]. This
joint functional between two players of the predicted time of the first observed threshold
to cross the half of the total nodes along with values of each component upon this time.
The defender (a car company) could take a preliminary action (i.e., request to add honest
nodes as a safety mode) for protecting the Blockchain in a vehicle.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the Enhanced BIoV (EBIoV)
network and it describes how to construct EBIoV architecture by using the BGG model
which is a stochastic game between an attacker and a defender. Once a dishonest blocks are
generated, the model predicts how many blocks will be generated and finds the moment
when more than the half of nodes are covered by an attacker. The framework for setting up
the mixed strategic game is provided in Section 3. The optimal values of an EBIoV network
for the memoryless case are analytically calculated in Section 4. The memoryless property
implies that a defender does not spend additional resources to store past information.
Lastly, Section 5 provides the conclusion of the paper.
2. Stochastic Game for BIOV Network Security
The Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) [18,19] has been adapted the BIoV network
architecture to defend against the attacks [15]. This system model consists of one attacker
(i.e., the miner which intends to fork a private chain) and one defender (the miner which
honestly mines on the public chain) [25]. This explicit function (Theorem BGG-1) from the
BGG (Blockchain Governance Game) gives the predicted moment of one step prior to an
attack [18].
2.1. Enhanced IoV Network Structure
The proposed BIoV network structure [15] is explored in detail in this section. The
components in a vehicle, the equipment of a service center and a HQ database are hooked
up as one Blockchain network (see Figure 2). Each smart components in a connected
car could mechanically or electronically generate random values and share these values
with other smart components. Tires, brakes, an engine, a transmitter in a car could be
the smart components which shall be capable to communicate with other components
and to construct ledgers. Connected car components beside a CPU (smart controller)
generate values based on their mechanical actions and these generated values are sharing
with all other components including assigned service centers and a company headquarter.
Each values from car components is unique and randomly generated. And sharing these
generated number is a transaction in a conventional Blockchain network. A service center
has a database which contains information from cars which are served by service centers.
The unique value based on a registered car database are generated and sharing with other
nodes including a company headquarter.
Figure 2. Adapting BGG for the EBIoV architecture [18].
Unlike conventional Blockchain networks, an EBIoV network does not have any
reward system which requires a heavy computational power for being a miner to generate
ledgers. All nodes even in a service center and a HQ have same contribution power and
the equal chance to be a miner. For instance, a node of a CPU is same as nodes of other car
parts although a CPU controls other car parts. The verifiable random function (VRF) which
maps inputs to verifiable pseudorandom outputs is applied to select a node for generating
ledgers [26,27]. The VRF has been applied to perform secret cryptographic solution to
Mathematics 2021, 9, 109 4 of 13
select committees to run the consensus protocol [28,29]. By applying the VRF, all nodes in
the EBIoV network shall have the equal chance to become a miner who generates ledgers
without requiring heavy computational powers. The mechanism for protecting an EBIoV
network is exactly same as the mechanism of the BGG. The governance in a Blockchain
network is followed by the decision making parameters which include the prior time before
catching more than half of total nodes by an attacker. Any action shall not be taken until
one step prior to the time when it passes the first passage time. It still has the chance that all
nodes are governed by an attacker although an attacker catches less than the half of nodes.
2.2. BGG Model for Enhanced BIoV Network
To apply the BGG model into the BIoV network structure, the antagonistic game of
two players (called “A” and “H”) are introduced to describe the Blockchain network in
a connected car as a defender and an attacker. Both players compete to build the blocks
either for honest or false nodes. Let (Ω, F (Ω),P) be probability space FA, FH ,Fτ ⊆ F (Ω)
be independent σ-subalgebras. Suppose:
A := ∑k≥0 Xkεsk , s0(= 0) < s1 < s2 < · · · , a.s. (1)
H := ∑j≥0 Yjεtj , t0(= 0) < t1 < t2 < · · · , a.s. (2)
are FA-measurable and FH-measurable marked Poisson processes (εw is a point mass at w)
with respective intensities λa and λh. These two values are related with the computing
performance for generating blocks for attackers and honest nodes in the blockchain network.
They will represent the actions of player A (an attacker) and H (a defender). Player A builds
the blocks with fake information and sustain respective build the blocks of magnitudes X1,
X2, . . . formalized by the process. Similarly, player H generates the blocks with authorized
information with the blocks of magnitudes Y1, Y2, . . . Both players compete each other to
build their blocks (either genuine or fake). The processes A andH are specified by their
transforms
E
[
gA(s)
]
= eλas(g−1),E
[
zH(t)
]
= eλht(z−1). (3)
The game is observed at random times in accordance with the point process and it
is equivalent with the duration of the PoW (Proof-of-Work) completion in a Blockchain
based network:
T := ∑i≥0 ετi , τ0(> 0)), τ1, . . . , (4)
which is assumed to be delayed renewal process. The observation process could be
formalized as
Aτ ⊗Hτ := ∑k≥0 (Xk, Yk)ετk , (5)
and it is with position dependent marking and with Xk and Yk being dependent with
the notation
∆k := τk − τk−1, k = 0, 1, . . . , τ−1 = 0, (6)
and
γ(g, z) = E
[
gXk · zYk
]
, ‖g‖ ≤ 1, ‖z‖ ≤ 1. (7)
By using the double expectation,
γ(g, z) = δ(λA(1− g) + λH(1− z)), (8)
γ0(g, z) = δ0(λA(1− g) + λH(1− z)), (9)
Mathematics 2021, 9, 109 5 of 13
where
δ(θ) = E
[
e−θ∆1
]
, δ0(θ) = E
[
e−θτ0
]
, (10)
are the magical transform of increments ∆1, ∆2, . . .. This game contains a stochastic process
Aτ ⊗Hτ which describes the evolution of a conflict between players A and H known to an
observation process T ={τ0, τ1, . . .}. The process ends when on the k-th observation epoch
τk, the collateral building blocks to player H (or A) exceeds more than the half of the total
nodes M in the regular operation or player A exceeds more than
(
M

)
+ B nodes under
the safety mode. To further formalize the game, the exit indexes [18] are as follows:
ν := inf
{
k : Ak = A0 + X1 + · · ·+ Xk ≥
(
M

)
+ B
}
, (11)
µ := inf
{
j : Hj = H0 + Y1 + · · ·+ Yj ≥
(
M

)}
(12)
where B is the number of the reserved honest nodes from a headquarter (HQ) which is
depends on the availability from the HQ. Since, an attacker is win at time τν, otherwise
an honest node generates the correct blocks to share with others nodes. We are targeting
the confined game in the view point of player A. The joint functional of the BIoV network
model is as follows:

‖ζ‖ ≤ 1, ‖g0‖ ≤ 1, ‖g1‖ ≤ 1, ‖z0‖ ≤ 1, ‖z1‖ ≤ 1,
where M indicates the total number of nodes (or ledgers) in the BIoV network for each car
(see Figure 2). The BGG-1 Theorem [18] establishes an explicit formula Φ
(

and the functional (13) satisfies following expression:

Γ1 := γ(g1, z1v), Γ1
0 := γ0(g1, z1v). (17)
Additionally, the operator D(m,n)
(x,y) in (14) is defined as follows [18]:

(18)
then we can find
g(m, n) = D
(m,n)
(x,y)
[

, (19)
where
D(m,n) [g(m, n)](x, y) := (1− x)(1− y)∑m≥0 ∑n≥0 g(m, n)xmyn, ||x|| < 1, ||y|| < 1. (20)
Mathematics 2021, 9, 109 6 of 13
It is noted that both operators D , D are originated from the first exceed theory [30,31].
We can find the PGFs (probability generating functions) of the exit index ν from (14):
E[ζν] = E

3. Strategies in Blockchain Governance Game
Let us consider a two-person mixed strategy game which is played by player H as a
defender and player A as an attacker. Player H, who is mostly a car company in an EBIoV
network, has two strategies at the observation moment when one step prior to complete for
generating alternative chains with fake information. Basically, player H has the following
strategies (i.e., operation modes): (1) Regular−regular operations which implicates that
the BIoV network in a connected car are running as usual, and (2) Safety−the network is
running under the safety mode for avoiding attacks by adding honest nodes from a HQ.
Alternatively, player A (an attacker) might succeed to catch the blocks or fail to catch the
honest nodes. Therefore, the response of player A would be either “Not Burst” or “Burst.”
Let us assume that the cost for reserving additional honest nodes is cb where b is a set of
the factors that related with the reserved nodes from a HQ and these related factors could
be one or multiple values.
The headquarter of a car company reserves a certain portion of nodes for protecting
the BIoV network integrity. If an attacker succeeds to generate alternative blocks within car
parts, the network in a car is burst and the whole car value V is lost. It still has a chance
to burst a car network although a defender (or a car company) adds honest nodes before
catching blocks of an attacker. In this case, the lost cost includes not only a full car value but
also a cost for additional reserved honest nodes. The normal form of a game is as follows:
. Players: N = {A, H},
. Strategy sets:
sa = {“NotBurst”, “Burst”},
sh = {“Regular”, “Safety”}
(22)
Based on the above conditions, the general cost matrix at τν−1 when is the prior time
just before bursting could be composed as shown in Table 1 where q(sh) is the probability of
bursting a blockchain network (i.e., an attacker wins a game) and it depends on a strategic
choice of player H:
q(sh) =

E

1{Aν≥M

]
, sh = {“Regular”},
E
[
E
[
1{Aν≥M

∣∣∣∣B]], sh = {“Safety”}.
(23)
Table 1. Cost matrix.
NotBurst (1 − q(sh)) Burst (q(sh))
Regular 0 V
Safety cb cb + V
It is noted that the cost for reserved nodes (i.e., the cost of “Safety” operation strategy
by player H) should be smaller than the whole cost of the other strategy. Additionally, the
number of reserved honest nodes from the HQ is random and this variable B shall have a
certain probability distribution. Let us consider the number of reserved honest nodes has
Mathematics 2021, 9, 109 7 of 13
the binomial distribution with the success probability ρ and the number of trial n. The PGF
of the binomial distribution is as follows:
σn = E
[
bB
]
= (ρb− (1− ρ))n. (24)
The optimal number of reserved nodes n∗ which supported by the HQ depends on
the cost function and the optimal value ρ∗ is the acceptance rate when the reserved honest
nodes are requested to a HQ. The best combination (n∗, ρ∗) could be found as follows:
(n∗, ρ∗) = inf
{
(n, ρ) ≥ 0 : SReg
(
q0
)
≥ SSafe(n, ρ)
}
, (25)
where, at the moment τν−1,

= V · q0, (26)

We would like to design the BGG adapted BIoV network that is capable to take the
safety operation at the decision making moment τν−1. The governance of the Blockchain
network is driven by the BGG decision making parameters. It is noted that no safety
actions are required until the time τν−1. Additionally, it still has the chance that all nodes
are governed by an attacker if the attacker catches more than the half of nodes at τν−1 (i.e.,{
Aν−1 ≥ M
2
}
). If the attacker catches less than half of all nodes at τν−1 (i.e.,
{
Aν−1 < M
2
}
),
then the defender could run the safety mode to avoid the burst at τν. The total cost for
developing the enhanced BIoV network is as follows:
S

q0; n, ρ
)

where

3.1. Memoryless BGG Observation Process for EBIoV Networks
It is assumed that the observation process has the memoryless properties. This
might be a special condition but very practical for actual implementation of a Blockchain
Governance Game [18]. It implies that a defender does not spend additional cost for storing
past information. After building a cost function of a BGG network, we could find explicit
solutions of q0, pA−1 and the moment of decision making after finding the closed form
(PGF) of the first exceed index ν, each probability (generating function) of the number
of blocks at the moment τν
(
i.e., E
[
gAν
1
])
and τν−1
(
i.e., E
[
gAν−1
0
])
. The functional D is
defined on the space of all analytic functions at 0. Recalling from (7)–(10), we have:
γ(g, z) = δ(λa(1− g) + λh(1− z)) = γa(g) · γh(z), (32)
γa(g) = δ(λa(1− g)), γh(z) = δ(λh(1− z)), (33)
and

The exit index (aka, the first exceed level index) is the most important factor to be fully
analyzed because the decision making parameters including the marginal mean of τν−1,
Aν and Aν−1 could be calculated easily once the exit index is explicitly determined from
(18) and (37)–(40):
E[ζν] := L1 + L2 − L3 (41)

Since the observation process has the memoryless properties, the inter-arrival time

3.2. Marginal Means of EBIoV Decision Making Parameters
In the EBIoV network, conventional decision making parameters are ν, τν−1, Aν and
Aν−1. Although all decision making parameters could be fully analyzed, using a marginal
mean of each parameter is occasionally more efficient than finding the explicit PGFs of
parameters. The marginal means of EBIoV decision making parameters could be found
as follows:
E[ν] = ∂

, (57)
E[τν−1] = E[τ0] +E[∆1](E[ν]− 1), (58)
E[Aν] = E[A0] +E[ν− 1]E[Xk], (59)
E[Aν−1] = E[A0] +E[ν− 2]E[Xk]. (60)
Recalling from (23), the probability of bursting a Blockchain network (i.e., an attacker
wins a game) under the memoryless properties becomes a Poisson compound process:
q(sh) = ∑k> M

4. The EBIoV Optimization Practice
This section deals with the BIoV network security optimization practice in a connected
car. The strategy for protecting the EBIoV network is supporting additional nodes to give
the less chance that an attacker catches blocks with false control requests. The example in
this paper is targeting a connected car which consists 16 IoV components in a BIoV network
(15 nodes from car parts and 1 node from a service center) and the estimated car value is
around 50,000 USD (see Table 2).
Table 2. Initial conditions for the cost function.
Name Value Description
M 16 [Component] Total number of the nodes in each BIoV network
V 50,000 [USD] Average value of a BIoV enabled connected car
c(n, ρ) =25 · n · ρ [USD] Cost for reserving nodes to avoid attacks per each car
E[A0] 2 [Blocks] Total number of blocks that changed by an attacker at τ0(=0)
BM 32 [Nodes] Maximum number of honest nodes supported from the HQ
It is noted that the values on Table 2 are artificially made up for demonstration
purposes only. Since the BGG adapted IoV network (EBIoV) has been analytically solved,
finding optimal values of a cost function and calculating a probability distribution of a
model are straight forward. However, software implementation by using a programming
language is still required for solving a LP (Linear Programming) problem. Based on the
above conditions, a LP model could be described as follows from (25) and (28):
Objective:
G = min S(n, ρ)Total
(64)
Subject to:
n ≥ c(n,ρ)
V·q0−c(n,ρ) ; (65)
From (28), the total cost S(n, ρ)Total is as follows:
S(n, ρ)Total =
{

The total cost S(n, ρ)Total could be minimized by the given parameter set (n, ρ) and
the parameter set (n∗, ρ∗) is the optimal combination of an acceptance rate and the number
of total backup nodes which are supported from the HQ. The below illustration in Figure 3
is the conventional graph that shows the optimal result of the BGG based BIoV (EBIoV)
network based on the given initial conditions in Table 2.
Mathematics 2021, 9, 109 11 of 13
Figure 3. Optimization Example for the EBIoV.
It is noted that the total cost for reserving backup nodes should be more than the car
value when an EBIoV network is burst. Hence, the limitation of the success probability for
adding nodes is as follows:
V · q0
c(n, ρ) · (BM − 1)
≤ 1, (71)
where BM is the maximum available reserved nodes per a connected car. According to
this demonstration (based on Table 2), the optimal cost is 1700 USD (per a car) when
the defender reserves 4 additional nodes per each car with the 82.6% acceptance rate for
managing the risk from attackers (i.e., n∗ = 4, ρ∗ = 0.826). The moment of requesting
the additional nodes will be the time τν−1 when is one step prior to the moment when an
attacker catches more than the half of whole blocks.
5. Conclusions
This paper establishes the enhanced Blockchain based IoV network architecture by
bringing a theoretical model in stochastic modeling. The Enhanced Blockchain enabled
Internet of Vehicles (EBIoV) is an advanced secure IoT network architecture for protecting a
connected car from attackers. This new architecture has been designed for a decentralized
network by adapting the Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) to improve the connected
car security. The BGG is a mathematically proven game model to develop optimal defense
strategies to protect systems from attackers. The practical case in the paper demonstrates
how an EBIoV network could be implemented for connected car securities. The EBIoV
network is the first research that applies a BGG model into the IoV security domain. The
BGG model shall be extended to various Blockchain based cybersecurity areas including
IoT security and secured decentralized service network design.
