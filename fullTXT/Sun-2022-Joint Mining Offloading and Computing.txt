Abstract—Mobile edge computing is considered as a promising
solution to mobile blockchain system, where mobile nodes with
limited computing capability may participate in the mining process
by offloading the computing intensive mining tasks to nearby edge
service providers (ESPs). However, malicious ESP will dishonestly
perform miners’ mining tasks, which harms miners’ interests. We
consider blockchain mining and computing offloading services
jointly, and model the interaction between the ESP and miner
nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Then, we obtain the
optimal edge computing demand and the corresponding price of
each miner by solving the Nash equilibrium of the game iteratively
with gradient descent method. Simulation results show that the
more computing power ESP has, the more computing services it
will provide for miners. When the revenues coefficient of ESP on
vehicular services increases, ESP will provide more computing
resources for vehicular services to obtain maximum benefits.

I. INTRODUCTION
As a distributed ledger technology (DLT) with advanced
cryptography, blockchain can achieve peer-to-peer transactions
in a secure and tamper-proof manner in trustless environment
without relying on a trusted central authority, and thus it has
received extensive applications in many application areas, such
as finance, supply chain, government and medical data sharing,
etc [1]–[4]. Consensus is the key to guarantee consistency
and security in blockchain technology. In public blockchain,
such as bitcoin system [5], the proof-of-work (PoW) [6]
consensus is most commonly adopted. With PoW consensus,
each participating node is required to solve a computation-
intensive mathematic puzzle to find a feasible nonce that
satisfies the target difficulty, and the node who finds the nonce
will broadcast the results to other nodes for verification. Once
most of the nodes validate the results, a new block will be
generated and appended to the chain with a mining reward
given to the first winner.
Even though blockchain is a promising solution for many
applications, it cannot be readily applied in mobile scenarios
due to the limitations of the proof like consensus. Generally,
the available computing resources on mobile devices (e.g.,
smartphones and unmanned aerial vehicles) are very limited,
and cannot support the computing intensive block mining tasks.
Edge computing [7] has been proposed as a new solution
for many emerging applications, by moving the computing
capability near to the end users. Thus, edge computing brings
new opportunities for mobile blockchain system [8].
The combination of mobile edge computing (MEC) and
blockchain network is regarded as a promising solution for
mobile blockchain system [9]–[13]. To help the mobile devices
in reaching consensus and storing data, an architecture of
blockchain network combining with edge server was introduced
in [9]. Because the network computing resources determine the
efficiency of the blockchain system, how to obtain computing
resources and incentivize device participation will be the driving
force. The authors in [10] focused on the incentives for rational
miners to purchase computing resources and formulated a two-
stage Stackelberg game between edge service providers (ESPs)
and miners. Many researchers have also worked on solving the
privacy and security issues during the offloading of computing
tasks. The optimal offloading strategy and security issues for
mobile nodes were studied in [11]. The authors in [12] modeled
the interaction of miners and blockchain platform as a two-
stage Stackelberg game, and studied how to incentivize more
miners to join in blochchain. Note that the work in [12] did not
consider the block propagation delay in the block verification
process, and a modified system utility function were considered
by considering the block verification delay in [13].
The authors in [14] developed an optimal auction for edge
computing resources allocation based on deep learning. An
auction-based edge computing resources allocation mechanism
for ESPs was proposed to maximize the social welfare in
[15]. Then, the game model of multiple leaders and multiple
followers was also considered in many articles. A multi-
operator multi-user Stackelberg game to analyze the interaction
among the UE and multiple operators was developed in [16]. In
addition, the author in [17] simulated the computing resource
allocation process as a two-stage starckelberg game process, and
considered the joint optimization of the revenue of cloud/fog
computing service provider (CFP) and the miners. Considering
multiple edge servers, the pricing strategy based an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) was presented in [18].
The authors in [19] proposed a dynamically pricing strategy in
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) resource allocation.
The above researchers proposed a two-stage Stackelberg
game and an auction-based edge computing resources allocation
mechanism at the same time. But it is worth noting that
most works above have investigated the computing resource
allocation of ESPs in a mobile blockchain system with the
assumption that ESPs are trustworthy. However, under current
revenue model, ESP is much likely to collude with some miners

to obtain more revenues. The collusion of the ESP and miners
will cause severe security threats to the blockchain system. The
authors in [20] proposed a reward sharing scheme to mitigate
potential colluding miners in the mobile blockchain system.
Considering the collusion issue in computing offloading, the
authors in [21] and [22] proposed a nonce ordering mechanism
to provide fair computation resource offloading. The ESP maps
the nonce sequence submitted by all users into a merged
nonce sequence, and provides hash computing services for
the merged sequence. However, the above researchers only
considered the model in which ESP uses all computing power
for miners’ computing tasks. For the completeness of the
experimental results, we need to consider whether the ESP
will simultaneously provide computation for other devices.
In this paper, we propose a model in which ESP provides
both vehicular services and mining services. We also consider
that the malicious ESP may not perform the miner’s mining
task with a certain probability. We consider the influence of
the computing power in the blockchain network and ESP uses
the remaining computing resources for other computing tasks.
In particular, we use the two-stage Stackelberg game to model
the interaction among the ESP and miners. Then, we solve the
Nash equilibrium of the game using gradient descent method
iteratively. The simulation results show that the more computing
power ESP has, the more computing services it will provide
for miners. When the revenues coefficient of ESP on vehicular
services increases, ESP will provide more computing resources
for vehicular services to obtain maximum benefits. In addition,
as the increase of the probability of not performing mining
tasks, the revenues of ESP increases.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. The system
model is described in Section II. In Section III, we analyze the
game between ESP and miners, and deduce Nash equilibrium.
The simulations and discussions are given in Section IV. In
Section V, we draw the conclusions.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a MEC aided mobile
blockchain network, where miners perform block mining tasks
to earn rewards. Due to the limitation of computing capability,
miners need to offload their Hash computing tasks to the
ESPs. In addition, ESP also provides computing resources
for vehicular services for data analysis and data storage. We
consider the impact of other miners’ computing power in the
blockchain on the ESP offloading strategy. We consider a
scenario with one ESP and multiple miners. Denote the set of
miners as N = {1, 2, ......, N}. The ESP dynamically changes
the unit price of computing resource for each miner, and then
broadcasts the prices to miners, so that miners decide their
optimal purchase amount of computing resource to maximize
their revenues. ESP only uses part of the computing power
to assist miners in mining, and the remaining part of the
computing power is used for vehicular services for data analysis
and data storage. Note that, to facilitate the theoretical analysis,
we ignore the synchronization issues and the communication
overhead.
B. Problem Formulation
Because ESPs and miners maximize their respective revenues,
we model their interactions as a game model. Hence, we adopt
a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the ESP and miners act
as leader and followers, respectively. In the upper stage, the
ESP dynamically adjusts the unit computing resource price to
maximize its revenue. In the lower stage, according to the price
given by the ESP, each miner decides the optimal purchase
amount of computing resource to get maximum revenue.
Assuming that the total computing power of other miners
in the blockchain system is ωb. We considered that the total
revenue of the miner is composed by the remaining mining
reward minus the cost of purchasing computing resources.
Denote the set of computing resource purchased by each miner
and the corresponding prices as ω = {ω1, ω2, ......, ωN} and
p = {p1, p2, ......, pN}, respectively. Then, the i-th miner’s
cost on purchasing computing resources is given by piωi. The
successful mining rewards from the blockchain platform include
both fixed reward R and transaction dependent variable rewards
rsi, where r is transaction fee rate and si is the block size of
the i-th miner. In addition, we consider the impact of block
verification delay, which is related to the block size. The delay
of block verification is given by exp (−τsi) [23], where τ is
the delay factor. Then, the probability of successful mining is
given by [13]
ki =
ωi∑
j∈N
ωj+ωb
. (1)
Considering the propagation delay of block verification, the
mining reward is given by [13]
Ri = (R+ rsi)e
−τsi . (2)
Thus, the revenue of the i-th miner is given by
Ui = Ri
ωi∑
j∈N
ωj+ωb
− piωi . (3)
Assuming that the total computing power of ESP is ωa, the
part of the computing power used for vehicular services is

40
ω0 = αωa, where α is the ratio of the computing power used
by ESP for vehicular services. Due to the influence of various
factors such as service quality, the incomes obtained by ESP
for data storage and data analysis of vehicular services are
a ln (1 + bω0), where a and b are the coefficients. The unit
computational cost is c. For the ESP, the revenue can be defined
as the profit by providing computing services to miners plus
the income from vehicular services minus the computational
cost. Therefore, the revenue function of the ESP can be defined
as follows:
Us =
∑
j∈N
pjωj + a ln (1 + bω0)− c
∑
j∈N
ωj+ω0
 . (4)
Then, the profit maximization problem of the two sides can
be modeled as the following problems.
Problem 1. For each miner in the lower stage, the optimiza-
tion problem can be formulated as:
max
ωi
Ui(ωi|ω−i, pi) , (5)
where ωi is the computing capability of the i-th miner and
ω−i = ω\ {ωi}.
Problem 2. The problem in the upper stage (ESP side):
max
p
Us(p,ω) ,
s.t.
∑
j∈N
ωj+ω0 ≤ ωa .
(6)
where pi is the unit price of computing resources for the i-th
miner.
III. STACKELBERG GAME ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze Stackelberg game and deduce
the optimal strategies of ESP and each miner.
The equilibrium point of Stackelberg game (SE) is a Nash
equilibrium (NE) between the leader (ESP) and followers
(miners). At the NE point of the game, players can not change
their strategies to obtain greater profit without damaging the
profit of other players. In this paper, the SE point (ω∗i , p
∗
i ) is
defined as follows:
Definition 1. Let ω∗i and p∗i be the optimal computing
resources purchased by the i-th miner and the corresponding
price, respectively, where p∗ = {p∗1, p∗2, ......p∗N}. The point
(ω∗i , p
∗
i ) is the Stackelberg NE point if it satisfies the following
conditions:
Us(p
∗,ω∗) ≥ Us(p,ω∗) , (7)
Ui(ωi
∗|ω∗
−i,p
∗) ≥ Ui(ωi|ω∗
−i,p
∗) , (8)
where ω∗
−i = ω
∗\ {ω∗i } .
Next, we use the method described above to sovle the
equilibrium point of the game. First, given the computing
resource prices profile, we solve the optimal computing
resource demands of miners in the lower stage. Subsequently,
we deduce the optimal computing resource prices of ESP in
the upper stage.
A. Lower stage (miners side) analysis
Before solving the equilibrium point, we first prove its
existence and uniqueness in the miners’ sub-game through
the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The NE point in the miners’ sub-game exists
and is unique.
Proof. The first and second order derivatives of the miners’
revenue function (3) can be written as follows:
∂Ui
∂ωi

∑
j∈N\{i}

(
∑
j∈N

3 ≤ 0 . (10)
Therefore, the miners’ revenue function is strictly concave, and
there must exist a unique ω∗i which is the Nash equilibrium
point in the miners’ sub-problem. To ensure the positivity of
the utility function Ui, we have Ri/
∑
j∈N ωj > pi. Let the
equation in (9) be zero, we can get the optimal computing
resource demand is:

Theorem 1. The unique Nash equilibrium for the i-th miner

Then, we take the summation of (14) for all miners yields, we

According to (9), we have

By substituting (14) into (17), by simple transformations, we
can obtain the Nash equilibrium for the i-th miner as shown
in (13).
B. Upper stage (ESP side) analysis
For any price by the ESP, each miner has a unique Nash
equilibrium point, so the ESP’s revenue can be maximized by
setting a reasonable price.
By substituting (13) into (4), we have the ESP’s revenue
fuction as follow:
Us =
∑
i∈N
piG(1−

j∈N

H = ∂2G/∂pi

. Then we caculate the first
order and second order derivatives of (18), which are given as
follows:
∂Us

+XH + J .
(20)
Because G ≥ 0, J ≤ 0, H ≥ 0, we can get ∂2Us
∂pi2
≤
0. So Us(p) is a strictly concave function, and there is a
unique optimal price that maximizes ESP’s revenue. Because
the Problem 2 is a convex optimization problem, we can deal
with Problem 2 with Lagrange multiplier. Then we can get the
Lagrangian of the Problem 2 as:
L(p, λ) = Us (p) + λ(G− ωb + ω0 − ωa) . (21)
where λ is a nonnegative Lagrange multiplier with the con-
straint
∑
j∈M
ωj+ω0 ≤ ωa.
Thus the KKT conditions that the optimal solution needs to
satisfy are as follows:
∂L(p, λ)
∂p
=

GK − 2 p1R1
G2 +XJ − 2GJW + λJ = 0
GK − 2 p2R2
G2 +XJ − 2GJW + λJ = 0
......
GK − 2 pNRN
G2 +XJ − 2GJW + λJ = 0
,
(22)
λ ≥ 0 , (23)
λ(G− ωb + ω0 − ωa) = 0 . (24)
Then we have two cases as follows:
case 1. When λ = 0, we have G− ωb + ω0 − ωa ≤ 0. By
substituting λ = 0 into (22), we can derive that ∂L(p,λ)
∂p = 0.
Because J ≤ 0, we have ∂L(p,λ)
∂p > 0. This contradicts the
presumption. Thus, the asumption that λ = 0 does not hold.
case 2. When λ > 0, we have G− ωb + ω0 − ωa = 0. With
(22) and (24), we can solve the optimal value of U∗s (p).
Then we use Bisection method to iteratively solve
the optimal unit price. Through constant iterations until
‖p(t+ 1)− p(t)‖1 < ε, with the precision threshold ε. Since
the revenue function Us(p) is concave on each pi, thus p∗
exists and is unique. The optimal price is the NE solution,
p∗ = p(t). In summary, p∗ is the unique NE solution. The
distributed algorithm to find the NE points of miners and ESP
is summarized in Algorithm 1.

4: ESP obtains the optimal price p∗ and Lagrange multiplier

ESP sents the unit computing resource price to all miners;
5: until ‖p(t+ 1)− p(t)‖1 < ε
6: Output: optimal demand µ∗ and optimal price p∗.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we conduct simulations to verify the effec-
tiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, we consider one
ESP, one vehicle and 100 miner nodes (N = 100) in this
scenario. The simulation process is done using MATLAB. The
simulation parameter values are in the TABLE I.

The impact of the ratio of ESP’s computing resources on the
average revenues of miners, the revenue of ESP are evaluated
in Figures. 2-5, respectively. In Fig. 2, we can observe that
the average revenues of miners gradually decreases with the
increase of the ratio of ESP’s computing resources in the total,
α. When α increases, the proportion of computing resources
used by ESP to provide computing services to miners decreases,
and the computing power that miners can purchase decreases.
The lower probability of successful mining by miners leads to
a decrease in the total revenue of miners. In addition, when

the total computing resource of ESP increases, because the
ratio of ESP’s computing resources in the total unchanged, the
number of computing power purchased by each miner increases,
resulting in a increase in the average income of miners.
As shown in Fig. 3, as the ratio of ESP’s computing resources
in the total α increases, each revenues curve of ESP has a
maximum value. As the total computing power of ESP ωa
increases, the proportion of computing resources used by ESP
for mining tasks increases. This is because when the computing
power of ESP is high enough and the total computing power
of other users in the blockchain network remains unchanged,
the more computing services ESP provides to miners, the
higher the probability of successful mining. This incentivizes
miners to buy more computing resources from ESP. In additon,

when the computing power of ESP used for vehicular services
gradually increases, at a certain point α, ESP income decreases.
In Fig. 4, for fixed the ratio of ESP’s computing resources
in the total α, as the revenue coefficient of vehicular services a
and b increase, the revenues of ESP and the optimal computing
power distribution ratio increase. This is because that under
the condition that other conditions remain unchanged, as the
revenue coefficient a increases, the revenue of ESP on vehicular
services increases, so that ESP will provide more computing
services for vehicular services to maximize its revenues.
However, the previous pictures are based on the honesty and
credibility of ESP. In order to study the revenues of ESP when
the ESP is untrustworthy, we introduce the probability of not
performing mining tasks, γ. We consider a model where ESP
does not perform the miner’s mining task with the probability

γ. As shown in Fig. 5, the revenues of ESP increases with
the increase of the probability γ. This is because that when
the ESP does not perform the mining tasks of the miners, the
computing cost of the ESP decreases. When the probability γ
increases, ESP will provide more computing power for miners
to buy, so as to obtain more revenues and reduce computing
costs.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed the optimal computing
resource allocation strategy in mobile blockchain network,
considering both mining services and other computing services.
We have modeled the interaction among the ESP and miner
nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and obtained the optimal
edge computing demand and the corresponding price of each
miner by solving the Nash equilibrium of the game. We have
compared the revenues of ESP under different proportions
of vehicular services and mining services. Simulation results
show that the more computing power ESP has, the more
computing services it will provide for miners. When the
revenues coefficient of ESP on vehicular services increases, ESP
will provide more computing resources for vehicular services
to obtain maximum benefits. In addition, as the increase of the
probability of not performing mining tasks, the revenues of
ESP increases.
