Abstract
Whistleblowing through newspapers is common. However, the whistleblower may face some problems if the anonymous
whistleblowing channel, usually maintained by journalistic organizations, is not reliable. The first problem is the conflict
of interest when the whistleblowing involves commercial or political partners of the journalistic organization. The second
problem is that, in conflict situations, the whistleblower’s anonymity can be unduly violated. To resolve these issues, we
present a blockchain-based anonymous whistleblowing service. Our approach includes a cryptographic scheme based on
a ring signature to ensure the whistleblower’s anonymity and, at the same time, give him/her the possibility to prove
that he/she is the author of the whistleblowing in the future. Through game theory, we model two scenarios involving
anonymous whistleblowing: the first is unfavorable to the whistleblower, and the second is quite favorable. We show that
the whistleblowing channel proposed here, exploring blockchain’s properties and the reliability of ring signatures, creates
favorable conditions for the whistleblower to feel motivated to disclose the whistleblowing.

1 Introduction
In corporate or governmental environments, an individual
may discover information that reveals illicit acts. Faced
with this situation, the person can consider himself/herself
obliged to make such information public. Disclosures like
these can lead to legal action and, consequently, punish-
ment for the organization and the individuals involved. The
whistleblowing channels, traditionally offered by journalis-
tic organizations, are common to report these irregularities.
However, when whistleblowing puts at risk the safety of the

whistleblower, such channels should satisfy at least three
conditions: (1) free of conflict of interest, (2) whistleblower
anonymity, and (3) revocation of anonymity when desirable.
In high-risk situations, a whistleblower must disclose
the information anonymously to avoid retaliation by the
accused. On the other hand, the whistleblowing must
have come from a reliable source for it to have credibil-
ity. Cryptographically, this problem was solved through a
ring signature scheme [1], denoted as RST. This scheme
allows a member of an organization to disclose a message
anonymously, inserting in the signature other members
directly related to the facts. Thus, everyone becomes sus-
pected of the message’s authorship along with the whistle-
blower, but the true author is unknown. Subsequently, some
RST expansion proposals have added ways of revoking the
whistleblower’s anonymity [2–4]. This new property guar-
antees the author of the message the possibility of receiving
some advantages in the future, such as cash prizes or honor.
However, anonymity and revocation of anonymity are
sufficient only when the journalistic organization is, in fact,
reliable. In the actual world, this is not easy to achieve.
When whistleblowing has a significant social or economic
impact, there is the possibility of a conflict of interest
within the journalistic organization, which makes it an
unreliable entity. The reason is that commercial or political

partnerships can turn newspapers into opponents of the
whistleblower. In this context, the newspaper can ignore
the whistleblower’s message or even publish fake news to
discredit the whistleblowing (if it is published on another
reporting channel).
1.1 Our contribution
We demonstrate that an anonymous whistleblowing scheme
through the blockchain protects the delation from conflicts
of interest because the hash power required to interfere with
the publication may not be feasible. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no other works with this proposal.
To better visualize the problem, first we use Game
Theory to show that this conflict can arise in the traditional
means of whistleblowing and may create a scenario
unfavorable to the whistleblowing process. Then, we show
a procedure more favorable may be implemented within the
blockchain, where:
– We combine blockchain and ring signatures to propose
a whistleblowing channel free of conflict of interest,
which poses no risk to the whistleblowing;
– We present a cryptographic scheme based on a ring
signature that, besides guaranteeing the whistleblower’s
anonymity, creates the possibility of revoking his/her
anonymity. That is, if the whistleblower wishes to reveal
his/her identity later, there are ways to prove that he/she
is, in fact, the author of the whistleblowing.
2 Related works
Since the introduction of the ring signature concept in
2001, many works have been proposed based on this idea,
contributing to this technique’s evolution. Some works
change the original signature generation protocol, and oth-
ers add new properties, as we will see below. Currently,
ring signatures are present in privacy-preserving schemes,
such as anonymization techniques in blockchain transac-
tions, as in [5–7], electronic voting [8–10], and others that
propose unconditional anonymity [11–14]. To adapt to our
papers’ scope, we will consider only works that address the
anonymity revocation property.
An important problem that deserves much attention is
how to revoke the anonymity of the whistleblower. In the
original scheme by Rivest et al. [1], the whistleblower
cannot revoke his anonymity because the authors did not
insert this feature. This property has received different
denominations; there is still no consensus on the property’s
name. Since there is no such consensus, we will call it
generically the revocation of anonymity.
Lee et al. [2] proposed a scheme called a convertible ring
signature that adds the anonymity revocation property. The
authors made a tiny change in the symmetric encryption key
that makes up the protocol. The whistleblower uses a secret
parameter to generate the key; such a parameter will be
revealed when he/she decides to assume the ring signature’s
authorship.
Lv and Wang [15] designed a way to revoke the whistle-
blower’s anonymity. The authors proposed a new signature
method defining its own trapdoor function. The scheme was
called verifiable ring signature and has allowed verification
of the signature’s authorship to be performed based on the
logarithm problem discreet.
As can be seen, the above methods somehow alter one or
more steps of the original protocol. An interesting proposal
was presented by Dong et al. [3]; the authors suggest no
changes in the original scheme RST. The authors only
propose a different way to generate one of the signature
input parameters—the initialization value. In this scheme,
the initialization value is the outcome of a cryptographic
hash function, which takes as input a list of random
public values and a secret value. The initialization value
is no longer random, as it was in RST. In this case, the
subscriber’s proof of authorship proves how the scheme’s
initialization value was generated—the secret value will be
revealed in due time, if the whistleblower wishes.
In this paper, we also present a simple and efficient
method for revocation of anonymity based on [4]. We
have been concerned with the method’s simplicity and
robustness, so we maintain our RSA-based scheme. The
importance of keeping RSA as a crucial element is because
it is a popular and highly secure cryptosystem. Here, the
whistleblower also needs to present some secret information
to prove that, in fact, he/she is the author of the ring
signature. The secret values, provided as input to the RSA
at each step of the signature generation process, are no
longer random as in RST [1]. Such values are calculated
deterministically as MACs (message authentication code),
as specified in Section 7.2 - Protocol 1. Besides, it is not
enough to present a single secret value as in [2, 3, 15]; it is
necessary to reveal n − 1 secret values (n is the number of
participants in the ring), making it difficult for an attacker
to counterfeit.
3 Blockchain background
Essentially, a blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of
maintaining an immutable log of transactions carried out
on a network [16]. Blockchain was initially proposed as
a technology underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency [17].
It has been considered disruptive since digitally creates a
102 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
decentralized trust entity, eliminating the need for a reliable
central authority.
3.1 Blockchain architecture
The basic architecture of a blockchain, represented by
Fig. 1, consists of a distributed database, a peer-to-peer
(P2P) network, and the applications that make blockchain
services available to end-users.
The database consists of a public ledger, distributed and
replicated between the nodes of the P2P network. This
ledger is append-only; that is, the registered transactions
cannot be deleted or changed. A transaction records a fact
between network participants, and any new transactions
are reflected in all copies of the ledger. All transactions
generated on the network are organized in blocks. A block
is a data structure that consists of two main parts: the header
and the body.
The block header contains, among other information,
the hash of the immediately preceding block. This allows
constructing a chain of blocks since each block points to
the previous block until reaching the first block. Another
important field in the header is the Merkle root. Since
the hashes of the transactions stored in each block form
a Merkle tree, the hash corresponding to the tree’s root is
inserted in the block header (see Fig. 2). This mechanism
aims to build a structure resistant to violations. Note that
if an attacker tries to violate a transaction, the Merkle root
changes and, consequently, the block hash is also modified.
This change happens because the block hash is calculated
from all header fields concatenated as a single entry. The
result of this is that the chain of blocks is broken, and,
therefore, the breach attempt is identified. This mechanism
ensures that maintaining the hash of the previous block is
sufficient to keep the blockchain protected. The body of the
block is composed of transactions. The maximum number
of transactions that a block can contain depends on the size
of the block and the size of each transaction.
The blockchain is built on top of a P2P network.
The network is made up of several nodes that perform
the task of validating and transmitting transactions. Each
node joins the network for the chance to earn some
reward, usually cryptocurrencies. From the data structure
point of view, blockchain is a growing list of records,
and because of that, not every node has the capacity to
store the entire blockchain. Thus, the blockchain permits
two types of nodes: the full nodes, which maintain a
complete and updated copy of the ledger; and light nodes,
which only store the block headers. For example, a user
who only wants to carry out a transaction needs to have
only one blockchain client application. The user can then
connect to the blockchain using any computing device,
even a smartphone, without the need to store the entire
blockchain.
Blockchain client applications are where the desired
functionality is encoded. The applications make users
interact directly with each other without knowing the details
of the underlying technologies. The blockchain identifies
users by large strings of alphanumeric characters, called
addresses, generated from their public key. A user can
have multiple addresses at the same time. Blockchain
applications are responsible for managing users’ addresses
and storing the corresponding public/private key pair.
Essentially, the application allows the user to carry out
transactions. Ideally, good blockchain applications should
not adopt a client-server model and, therefore, should not
rely on a centralized server [18].
3.2 Consensusmechanism
As a public network—formed by unknown nodes and with-
out a central authority—blockchain requires a mechanism
capable of maintaining consensus on the network. A con-
sensus mechanism is a process of agreement among the
nodes—mutually suspect, on the same message transmitted
to the network or on the blockchain’s state.
Fig. 1 Basic blockchain
structure
103Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
Fig. 2 Simplified chain of blocks structure
The consensus mechanism is carried out by protocols that
keep all network nodes synchronized, ensuring that the same
ledger is consistent across different nodes. Also, it provides
rewards to peers to keep the blockchain up and running.
The mechanism is also responsible for preventing any single
entity from controlling the entire blockchain system.
One of the consensus mechanism’s critical points is how to
decide which node has the right to create a block at a given
time. The best strategy for this problem is that only one node
should propose a block at a time, and the rest of the nodes
should validate the transactions in the block and add to their
blockchains if transactions are valid. [18]. Currently, the two
most popular consensus algorithms used in blockchains are
Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
– Proof of work. Initially presented in [19] and later
inserted into the Bitcoin network. PoW establishes that
a node proves that it has spent some time to find a solu-
tion that satisfies a computational challenge proposed
by the protocol. The solution is difficult and requires
significant computational power. However, checking
the validity of the solution should be quick and easy.
This process is called mining, and the nodes that run it
are called miners.
– Proof of stake. PoS [20] it is an alternative to PoW that
does not require substantial computational power. In
PoS, instead of solving a computational challenge, the
next block’s creator is chosen in a probabilistic way, in
which the chance of being chosen is proportional to the
amount of cryptocurrencies that the user has.
3.3 Blockchain working process
The blockchain operation involves many processes and a
sophisticated combination of techniques, such as cryptography,
distributed systems, and game theory. Its operation can be
summarized as follows.
1. A node creates a transaction and sends it to its neigh-
bors. The neighbor then retransmits the transaction and
so on.
2. When a full node receives a transaction, it is valid
according to the consensus algorithm. Once validated,
the transaction will be included in a draft of the next
block to be proposed.
3. The nodes compete with each other to decide which one
will propose the next block. The node is selected accord-
ing to the consensus algorithm used in the network.
4. The selected node transmits its block to the network
so that the other full nodes validate the new block’s
transactions.
5. If they agree that the transactions are valid, each full
node adds the new block to its ledger instances. In this
way, the consensus mechanism ensures that all network
full nodes have exactly the same chain of blocks. Once
inserted into the blockchain, the transactions within the
block can never be changed or deleted.
3.4 Smart contracts
Essentially, a smart contract is a set of functions stored on
the blockchain in the form of a script that can be executed
by all nodes. The smart contract runs automatically if a
predefined event occurs or can be activated by addressing a
transaction to it. Like blockchain users, a smart contract is
identified by an address. However, unlike a user, each smart
contract has a unique address. The execution of the smart
contract can result in a set of new transactions.
Once recorded on the blockchain, the smart contract is
immutable. In other words, not even the contract creator can
104 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
modify its code or subvert its execution. Like a transaction,
a smart contract is replicated to all full nodes on the network
so that each one can verify the contract’s correct execution.
4 Preliminaries to ring signatures
In 1991, Chaum and Heyst [21] presented a type of signa-
tures scheme called group signatures. Group signatures are
schemes that allow a group member of people to sign a mes-
sage on behalf of the group without revealing the identity of
the person who signed. The scheme ensures that it is evident
that the signature was produced by one of the group mem-
bers, but without identifying which member precisely. This
scheme defines three properties.
1. Only members of the group can sign messages;
2. The receiver can verify that it is a valid group signature,
but cannot discover which group member made it;
3. In case of a dispute later, the signature can be “opened”
(with or without the group members’ help) to reveal the
signer’s identity.
The concept of ring signatures was introduced by Rivest
et al. in 2001 [1] based on group signatures. A ring signature
scheme allows a member of a group to disclose a message
anonymously, in such a way that each member of the group
is considered the possible author of the message. The main
objective of a ring signature is to guarantee the anonymity
of those who divulged the message and also to guarantee the
authenticity of the information, showing that the message
came from one of the members of that group.
The ring signature scheme, although based on group
signatures, has its own characteristics described below.
1. Each group member must be associated with a public
key via PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).
2. The group does not need to be organized or have
a premeditated formation with an exact number of
participants.
3. The rest of the group members should not be informed
that their public keys will be used in this scheme.
4. The message verifier must be unable to tell which
member of a group of possible signers actually
produced the signature.
A traditional ring signature consists of two procedures:
– Signature generation (m, A). Given a message m to be
signed and a set of public keys A = {P1, P2, P3...Pn},
the signer As can produce a ring signature σ using A
and his own secret key Ss .
– Signature verification (m, σ ). Given a message m and a
signature σ that includes A = {P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn}, then
a verifier can determine if σ is a valid ring signature for
the message m, generated by one of the group member.
In the next subsections, we present the fundamental
concepts and techniques used in our approach.
4.1 Trapdoor function
The original ring signature scheme [1] uses the concept of
one-way trapdoor functions. A trapdoor one-way function
is a one-way function f : X → Y with the additional
property that given some extra information (called the
trapdoor information) it becomes feasible to find for any
given y ∈ Im(f ), an x ∈ X such that f (x) = y [22].
This means that with the secret, it is computationally
easy1 to calculate the inverse of the function. In this paper,
we have adopted RSA [24] as a one-way trapdoor function,
which will be able to encrypt and decrypt a message in
polynomial time.
RSA, in honor of its creators – Rivest, Shamir, and
Adleman, was the first asymmetric cryptosystem built using
the public key cryptography concept introduced by Diffie
and Hellman [25], and it is still widely used. We assume that
all the ring members use RSA as their individual signature
schemes.
4.2 Symmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption, also called secret key encryption, is
a method that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a
message. The sender and receiver agree to use a particular
key and then share it between them. The scheme presented
here uses the block cipher concept, which is usually
modeled as a pseudo-random permutation to avoid creating
a deterministic system. In this way, a system resistant to
attacks of multiple known ciphertexts is created.
4.3 Hash function
A hash function is a function H that receives a message m
of arbitrarily size and returns a fixed-size string h, called a
hash value, where, in general, |m| > |x|. This function can
be denoted by
H(m) = h.
More precisely, a hash function is a unidirectional map-
ping H : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}i , for some i > 1 ∈ N. In this
mapping, D is the domain of the function representing the
1Generally, easy is defined to mean a problem that can be solved in
polynomial time as a function of input length. Thus, if the length of the
input is n bits, then the time to compute the function is proportional to
na , where a is a fixed constant [23].
105Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
possible messages of arbitrary size, and I is the function
image representing the possible hash values of size i; thus,
the number of possible hash values is 2i . Since set D is
much larger than set I , two messages m and m′ may be
mapped to the same hash h; this is known as a collision.
Formally, a collision of the hash function H is when two
messages m �= m′ produce H(m) = H(m′).
To be used in cryptographic systems, hash functions must
satisfy some properties; if these properties are satisfied, they
are called cryptographic hash functions [23].
1. Preimage resistant (one-way property). For any given
hash value h, it is computationally infeasible to find m
such that H(m) = h.
2. Second preimage resistant (weak collision resistant).
For any given data block a, it is computationally
infeasible to find b �= a with H(b) = H(a).
3. Collision resistant (strong collision resistant). It is
computationally infeasible to find any pair (a, b) such
that H(a) = H(b).
4. Pseudorandomness. Output of H meets standard tests
for pseudorandomness.
We assume the existence of a publicly defined crypto-
graphic hash function H(·) that maps arbitrary inputs to a
fixed-length bit string.
4.4 HMAC
To authenticate a message, we can use a type of function
called message authentication code (MAC). This function
aims to guarantee the authentication of the data source
but does not guarantee data privacy. MAC that is based
on cryptographic hash functions takes the message to be
authenticated and a secret key as input and output a small
block of data of fixed size, which is transmitted together
with the message.
Formally, message authentication code is a function
MAC, which maps a message m of arbitrary length and a
secret key k of fixed-length to a data block as a hash value
– this function can be denoted by
MAC(k, m) = t .
Generally, the data block t obtained as output from the MAC
algorithm is called the MAC value.
In this paper, to ensure the process of revoking the
whistleblower’s anonymity, we use HMAC—a MAC algo-
rithm based on cryptographic hash function [26]. MACs
are the fundamental elements of this scheme, as it will be
through them that the whistleblower will be able to prove
the authenticity of the disclosed message.
HMAC can be used with any built-in cryptographic hash
function, such as SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512. The hash
function works like a black box—there is no need to modify
the function code to implement the MAC algorithm. There-
fore, the security of the HMAC is directly related to the
security of the hash function used internally. If the HMAC
fails as a secure MAC algorithm, then it is because there
are weaknesses in the built-in hash function, which needs
to be replaced. HMAC security means resistance against
tampering—that is, HMAC is considered broken if an
attacker is able to find any message m together with its
correct MAC value without knowing the key k.
4.5 Composition function
For the generation of the signature, in [1] the following
combining function was proposed.
C(z,u)(y1, ..., yn) = Ez(yn ⊕ Ez(y(n−1)
⊕Ez(... ⊕ Ez(y1 ⊕ u)))), (1)
which take as input a key z, an initialization value u, and
a list of values y1, y2, y3, ..., yn, calculated according to
Protocol 1. This function uses a symmetric encryption Ez(·)
as a sub-procedure and produces as output a value u.
5 Problem statement: conflict of interest
within journalistic organizations
A conflict of interest in a journalistic organization occurs
when the primary interest of the organization or a journalist
is unduly affected by a secondary interest. To describe a
scenario in which the solution presented in this paper can be
applied, consider the hypothetical situation.
A member of a business organization discovers that the
board of directors is involved in a corruption scheme. The
disclosure of illicit schemes involving powerful politicians
and business people often has a significant impact on
society. This can become a tricky dilemma for the
whistleblower. If he/she decides not to denounce, he/she
may even become an accomplice in an illegal action. On the
other hand, if he/she decides to denounce, he/she is likely
to suffer some kind of retaliation. Thus, it is essential that
the whistleblower makes the whistleblowing anonymously
to maintain his/her own safety.
The whistleblower’s main problem is that he/she never
knows if the whistleblowing channels maintained by
journalistic organizations are entirely reliable. When the
whistleblower anonymously delivers to the newspaper
evidence of the corruption scheme, the result is one of the
following situations.
1. The organization involved in the illicit scheme has no
business relationship with the journalistic organization.
The newspaper’s editors consider the whistleblowing
an important journalistic fact. There is no conflict of
106 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
interest. Therefore, the whistleblowing will be pub-
lished and the accused group will probably be investi-
gated. This is the situation desired by the whistleblower.
2. The accused may exercise some control over the
journalistic organization. The newspaper’s editors may
want to protect the individuals involved. One reason
for this protection would be because the journalistic
organization receives great advertising values from
the company involved. Another possible reason would
be the political relationship that the editors maintain
with the accused. Whatever the reason, the journalistic
organization is in a conflict of interest.
Note that the second reason for situation two above may
be even more unfavorable for the whistleblower. The group
that controls the whistleblowing service can try to identify
who made the whistleblowing. If the whistleblower’s
identity is discovered, the accused can pursue him/her to
prevent any further whistleblowing.
5.1 A related case
The case described here represents a situation in which
the proposal presented in this work could be applied.
This is the case of Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks.
Assange became known worldwide when he disseminated
information from whistleblowers on critical issues such
as possible crimes committed by the United States
Army. Assange, together with the WikiLeaks team, is
responsible for disclosing confidential documents from
various countries related to corruption or human rights
violations, but mostly confidential documents regarding the
US government. Assange was concerned about keeping the
source of information anonymous, but he always exposed
himself as a member of WikiLeaks.
In the case of Assange, a system like ours could have
helped preserve the identity of him and his sources. As
a consequence of the disclosures made by WikiLeaks,
Assange was pursued by international authorities. In 2012,
he applied for political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in
the UK, where he stayed until 2019 when British authorities
arrested him. The case of Assange divides opinions around
the world. We are presenting this case here just to show the
importance of an anonymous whistleblowing service, free
of conflicts of interest, which preserves the source’s identity
and still guarantees the whistleblowing’s credibility.
5.2 Game theory to represent the problem
We use game theory as a mathematical model to formalize
the problem of journalistic conflict of interest and show that
the use of traditional whistleblowing channels, such as those
provided by the press, is unfavorable to the whistleblower.
Game theory has many game classes, but in essence, it
is concerned with how rational individuals make decisions
when they are mutually interdependent [27]. Within this
theory, journalistic conflict of interest can be classified as a
dynamic and non-cooperative game. It is dynamic because
players move sequentially and not simultaneously, and non-
cooperative because players have different interests.
The journalistic conflict of interest can be modeled by a
game in extensive form and can be illustrated by a directed
graph, called the game tree (see Fig. 3). It is a kind of
perfect information game because every player—when it
is his turn to perform any action—knows precisely which
vertex in the game tree he/she is currently. In this model,
there are three strategic players, that is, make decisions
rationally: the whistleblower, the journalistic organization,
and the accused. Also, there is a pseudo-player, usually
called “Nature,” which takes random actions. Each vertex
that is not a leaf is labeled to identify the player taking
action. The edges emanating from vertices represent the
possible movements of the player at that point of the game.
The outcomes of this game, represented by leaf vertices,
are given by tuples of integers (n1, n2, n3), where n1 is
the payoff to the whistleblower, n2 is the payoff to the
journalistic organization and n3 is the payoff to the accused.
We do not represent a payoff to Nature since it is indifferent
to the outcomes of the game.
Although the game represented here is not exactly a zero-
sum game (i.e., competitive games where the winnings of
one player are equal to the losses of the other player),
let us conventionally take advantage of the traditional
representation used in these games when the only possible
payoffs are “victory” and “defeat.” So let us represent
the victory by “1” and the defeat by “−1.” Besides, let
us assume that when there is neither a win nor a defeat
for either player, they will give it a “draw” condition,
represented by “0.” Another possible result in this game
involves the idea of a “maximized victory,” represented
by “2.” This maximum victory to be achieved involves
two distinct goals for each player, as shown in the game
description below. This approach used to represent payoffs
has no loss of generality when the success or failure
depends on any cryptographic attack, since the payoffs are
independent of success chances in each attack.
5.3 Game description
The game starts at the vertex v1, called the root of the
game, where the whistleblower can choose the action
don’t denounce or action denounce. If the whistleblower
selects don’t denounce, the game ends with payoff (0, 0, 0).
Otherwise, if the whistleblower decides to denounce, the
game reaches the vertex v2, where Nature randomly chooses
a move.

Fig. 3 Game tree unfavorable to the whistleblower. This is a traditional scenario where the whistleblower is considering using a whistleblowing
channel offered by a journalistic organization
At the vertex v2, Nature represents the whistleblower’s
uncertainty about the existence or not of the conflict of
interest within the journalistic organization. When there is
no conflict of interest, the game develops from the vertex
v3. Otherwise, it develops from the vertex v4. To emphasize
the whistleblower’s uncertainty, we maximize the entropy
assuming an equiprobable outcome of a coin’s flip, since
many variables may act on the journalistic organization.
At the vertex v3, publishers can choose the action publish
or action don’t publish. If they decide to publish, the game
ends with payoff (1, 1, −1). Here, the publication of the
whistleblowing represents a victory for the whistleblower
and the journalistic organization and a defeat for the
accused. On the other hand, the newspaper editors can
choose the action don’t publish. This action indicates that
they did not consider the whistleblowing significant, leading
to the game’s termination with payoff (−1, 0, 0). In that
case, the whistleblower is the only one defeated since he/she
was unable to publish the whistleblowing. The other players
neither won nor lost.
At the vertex v4, publishers can choose the action
destroy or action break anonymity. The destruction of the
whistleblowing leads to the game’s termination with payoff
(−1, 1, 1). Here, action destroy the news means some
attack against it, such as deleting it from the database or
discredit it. This action results in loss to the whistleblower—
because of non-publication—and gains for the journalistic
organization and the accused. On the other hand, the choice
of action break anonymity leads to vertex v5. In this action,
the journalistic organization decides not to publish the
whistleblowing; moreover, it reveals the whistleblower’s
identity. So, it gets a maximum victory, according to the two
possible outcomes of the v5 vertex, because it strengthens
its relationships with the accused and helps to avoid further
108 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
denunciations by intimidating the source. Note that, as the
channel’s implementation is unknown to users, those who
control the channel may include ways to track and identify
the whistleblower.
At the vertex v5, the accused may don’t react or
threaten. The non-reaction leads to the game’s termination
with payoff (−1, 2, 1). In this case, the whistleblower’s
anonymity is already broken; obviously, this is a troubling
defeat for the whistleblower. However, the accused may
choose not to take any offensive action against the
whistleblower. On the other hand, the accused may choose
the action threaten, leading to the game’s termination
with payoff (−2, 2, 2), which increases the whistleblower’s
losses. This action represents the worst defeat for the
whistleblower, given by value −2, because besides doing
not publish the whistleblowing, the accused will persecute
him/her. Here, the accused group achieves a maximum
victory, given by value 2, because they prevent the
publication of the whistleblowing and can avoid a new
whistleblowing through threats to whistleblower.
Now, let us solve the game using the concept of Nash
Equilibrium [28]. In many sequential games, there are
multiple Nash equilibria. However, these equilibria involve
non-credible threats or promises that are not in the players’
interest to take into account. The concept of subgame
perfect Nash equilibrium rules out these situations by saying
that a reasonable solution to a game cannot involve players
believing and acting upon incredible threats or promises
[27]. In other words, a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
requires that the predicted solution to the game be a Nash
equilibrium in every subgame.
As this is a sequential game, to eliminate the implausible
equilibria, we will apply the backward induction method
to find a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium [29]. The
backward induction is a process that analyzes the game
backward, going from the leaf vertices to the root of the
game, seeking to select the actions that maximize the payoff
of each player. In Fig. 3, each player’s best options are
represented by solid green lines.
To start the analysis of the game, note that at the vertex
v5 and v4 the accused and the journalistic organization
(with a conflict of interest) have maximum gains when (1)
the whistleblower is threatened not to make any further
whistleblowing and (2) the journalistic organization breaks
the anonymity of the whistleblower. These choices result
in the payoff vector (−2, 2, 2), while the whistleblower
and journalistic organization (no conflict of interest) have
maximum gains in the action publish of the vertex
v3, resulting in the payoff vector (1, 1, −1). These two
optimal results are equiprobable at the vertex v2, which
belongs to Nature. Using the average of the set, the
expected payoff vector for the action denounce at vertex
v1 is (−0.5, 1.5, 0.5). Therefore, as it is unfavorable, the
whistleblower realizes that the best action at vertex v1 is
don’t denounce.
The game’s solution is the strategy profile
{don’t denounce, (publish, break anonymity), threaten},
represented by the solid green lines in Fig. 3. This
strategy profile is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium,
which represents, among the game’s Nash equilibria, the
one that makes more sense given the game’s sequential
nature. Therefore, this combination of strategy reveals that
the whistleblower’s best action is don’t denounce, leading
to the termination of the game with payoff (0, 0, 0). The
game’s result is inefficient for the whistleblower, motivating
him/her to give up revealing the illicit practices due to
the lack of trust in the whistleblowing channel. Therefore,
uncertainty whether or not the journalistic organization
has a conflict of interest makes the act of denouncing
unfavorable.
6 Themain result: making the game
favorable to the whistleblower
In this section, we insert elements that modify the scenario
presented in Section 5, so that the game becomes favorable
to the whistleblower.
6.1 Assumptions
In this paper, we consider that the scenario where the pro-
posed system will be used requires the following conditions.
1. We assume that an implementation of this system is
accessible to any citizen, provided that he/she has the
requirements to give credibility to the whistleblowing,
as discussed throughout the paper. For this, we assume
that the system will be implemented by social organi-
zations or activists engaged in anti-corruption activities
and concerned with protecting the whistleblower. Note
that the system can be made available as blockchain
client software with a simple enough interface for any-
one, even without knowledge of blockchain’s technical
details to use it. This is a delicate point of the sys-
tem because the techniques proposed here focus on
preventing the authorship of the whistleblowing from
leaking from the signature. However, in some situa-
tions, information leaked through the network underly-
ing the blockchain may lead to user de-anonymization,
as discussed in Section 8.3. This is a problem that has
received much attention from researchers, but it is still
an open problem to the best of our knowledge.
2. We assume that even if the organization providing the
system is exclusively dedicated to social causes and
109Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
is, therefore, seen as trustworthy, there may still be a
conflict between its members. Note that if eventually,
whistleblowing displeases any member of the organi-
zation, he/she cannot delete the whistleblowing, as in
a traditional database. This means that whistleblow-
ing is protected even if it displeases members directly
involved with the implementation of the system. There-
fore, we consider that implementing this system as a
blockchain application has advantages over a traditional
whistleblowing channel. In other words, a possible con-
flict of interest within the organization does not jeopar-
dize the whistleblowing service via blockchain. Thus,
using blockchain, we get fundamental advantages for
the credibility of the system.
3. Each individual who makes up the ring signature
scheme (this will be dealt with in more detail in
Section 8.2) must be publicly associated with a public
key through a certificate authority.2 If, for example,
all members of this scheme belong to the same
institution, it is assumed that the whistleblowing came
from someone within the organization with knowledge
of the facts reported. This, therefore, guarantees the
authenticity and credibility of the source of information,
as stated in Rivest’s seminal work [1]. Anyone can
verify that the members that make up the ring
signature belong to the organization by obtaining
the identity of the owner of the public key and
verifying the relationship that each member has with the
organization. Note that employees in the organization
do not have any special credentials to integrate a
ring signature scheme. They have only one digital
certificate, as any ordinary citizen may have.
4. We assume that the whistleblower will only make the
whistleblowing if he/she can provide evidence since the
whistleblowing will only serve as a means of initiating
an investigation.
6.2 High-level system architecture
Before decision-making, a rational whistleblower seeks
conditions that minimize his/her losses, such as a whistle-
blowing channel free of conflict of interest and that guaran-
tees anonymity while maintaining the source’s credibility.
Besides, support for revoking anonymity is also desirable,
so he/she may receive certain benefits in the future.
Figure 4 shows an architecture composed of elements
that satisfy these conditions. The blockchain, as it is a
decentralized environment and with immutable data, has
the aim of removing from the accused the power to
interfere in the publication of the whistleblowing, thus
2Certification authority is a trusted entity that, by law, may issue digital
certificates to individuals containing their public key.
creating a channel free of conflict of interest. As for
anonymity, it is desirable that it be achieved on two
levels: application and network. At the application level,
we suggest obtaining anonymity through the RST signature
scheme [1]. At the network level, there is still the
challenge of delinking users’ network-level information
from their transactions in the blockchain client software
[30]. The third property, introduced in [4], guarantees
to the whistleblower computational power to prove the
whistleblowing authorship in the future, if he/she deems it
necessary.
In this paper, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) [31] is
used to store the files that make up the whistleblowing,
d, ensuring the integrity and immutability of files. Store
large files in the blockchain, such as PDF files, images, and
videos, results in high financial cost. In the IPFS network,
the files are referenced by a hash, which is calculated based
exclusively on the file’s contents. So, H(d) = z, where z
is one of the entries for the signature generation algorithm
(See Section 7.2).
6.3 The new game
In Fig. 5, we have the game tree with a blockchain-
based whistleblowing channel free of conflict of interest.
At the root of the game, the whistleblower can choose
between three actions: (1) denounce by newspaper, (2)
don’t denounce, and (3) denounce by blockchain. The first
option appears only to represent the outcome of the previous
section’s game, with expected payoff (−0.5, 0.5), with −0.5
to the whistleblower and 0.5 to the accused. Note that this
action leads to the game developed in Fig. 3, but to simplify
the tree of the new game (see Fig. 5), we expose this option
only to indicate the result of the previous game, which ends
with a payoff of −0.5 for the whistleblower and 0.5 for the
accused. This result shows that the accused imposes a defeat
on the whistleblower.
In this new game, the whistleblower and the accused are
the only strategic players. Thus, the results of the game
are represented by pairs (n1, n2), where n1 is the payoff
for the whistleblower and n2 is the payoff for the accused.
In action don’t denounce, the whistleblower ends the game
with payoff (0, 0), where players neither win nor lose. On
the other hand, the action denounce by blockchain makes
the game develop from the vertex v2.
At the vertex v2, the accused can choose the action
don’t react, leading to the vertex v4. This action indicates
that the accused has decided to face the consequences of
whistleblowing. On the other hand, the choice of action
attack against blockchain leads to the vertex v3, which
belongs to Nature.
At the vertex v3, Nature represents the accused’s uncer-
tainty about the outcome of an attack on the blockchain
110 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
Fig. 4 The system architecture
consists of the following
elements: (1) The front-end is
the interface used to perform the
whistleblowing or consult them.
(2) The IPFS (InterPlanetary
File System) is a peer-to-peer
protocol for storing distributed
data. (3) The blockchain runs
the modules Generate
Signature, Verify Signature,
Record whistleblowing e Search,
which are implemented through
a smart contract
network. In this attack, the accused can have success with
probability p or to failure with probability (1−p). The fail-
ure leads to the vertex v5, where the whistleblowing remains
public in the blockchain, and the whistleblower remains
anonymous in the game. On the other hand, the attack’s
success leads to the game’s termination with a payoff (−2,
γ −λb), where γ represents benefits or gains from avoiding
the whistleblowing, and λb represents the loss of resources
invested in the attack. The value −2 means that the whistle-
blower failed to make the message public and, also, was
coerced to remain silent. This result of the game will have
to be the main aim of the accused because, in blockchain,

whistleblowing channel free of
conflict of interest
111Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
the consequences of the whistleblowing are neutralized only
if its elimination and the tracking of the whistleblower can
be successful together. Otherwise, if the whistleblowing is
deleted, but the whistleblower’s identity remains unknown,
then the whistleblower can restart the game by repeating the
whistleblowing, making the computational effort to elim-
inate it unfeasible. On the other hand, only discovering
the identity of the whistleblower and not eliminating the
whistleblowing, in no way reduces the impact of the news
after it has become public.
At the vertex v4, the whistleblower can choose remain
anonymous or revoke anonymity. If he/she remains anony-
mous, then the game ends with payoff (1, −λw), where λw
represents losses caused by the whistleblowing. In this case,
the whistleblowing publication without third-party interfer-
ence represents a victory for the whistleblower and defeat
for the accused. On the other hand, the whistleblower may
decide to revoke anonymity, and this adds another gain,
expressed in the result (2, −λw). This option is useful if
the whistleblowing brings some reward to the whistleblower
that requires proof of his/her identity in the future. Note that
the whistleblower must be sure that the scenario after the
whistleblowing does not offers risks to his/her safety.
For the whistleblower, vertex v5 seems to be equal to
vertex v4, since, at this stage of the game, he/she does
not know his/her position in the game tree because he/she
does not know the decision of the accused in vertex v2.
In cases like this, it is said that the vertices v4 and v5
belong to the same information set, and the game is said to
be a game with imperfect information. In this context, the
whistleblower has no way of knowing whether the accused
has chosen don’t react and the game has reached the vertex
v4 or failed after deciding attack against blockchain and the
game has reached the vertex v5. The actions available to the
whistleblower in both vertices are equal, but the accused’s
payoff in v5 is worse because of the resources spent trying
to implement the attack.
As this is an imperfect information game, we cannot
directly apply the backward induction process. In this case,
to solve the game, we must perform the following steps.
– At the vertex v2, calculate expected payoff for action
attack against blockchain. The accused’s expectation
has weight p for the best result and weight 1−p for the
worst result offered by Nature. Thus, by the ensemble
average, the expectation for the attack can be calculated
as follows:
N = p(−2, γ − λb) + (1 − p)(2, λw − λb)
= (−2p, pγ − pλb) + (2(1 − p), (1 − p)λw
−(1 − p)λb)
= (−2p + 2 − 2p, pγ − pλb + λw
−λwp − λb + λbp)
N = (2 − 4p, p(γ − λw) − λw − λb).
Therefore, the expected payoff of the accused is
p(γ − λw) − λw − λb,
where
– λw = losses caused by the whistleblowing
relative to accused’s wealth, w0. For example,
if w0 = 10 billions dollars and the loss caused
by the whistleblowing is 1 billion dollars, then
λw = 0.1,
– λb = loss of resources invested in the attack
relative to accused’s wealth,
– γ = benefits or gains from avoiding the
whistleblowing relative to accused’s wealth.
– If the accused chooses the action don’t react, the
game reaches vertex v4, where best result for the
whistleblower is (2, −λw). Therefore, the accused
believes that the whistleblower would make the
decision revoke anonymity to obtain the reward with
value 2.
– Thus, the accused can choose the action attack against
blockchain with an expected payoff
(2 − 4p, p(γ − λw) − λw − λb),
or don’t react, which can lead to the result (2, −λw).
– Verify the attack condition - The attack against
blockchain becomes attractive only if
p(γ − λw) − λw − λb ≥ −λw ⇒ p ≥
(
λb
γ − λw
)
,
(2)
for all γ > λw because the gain γ should be relevant.
Note that the accused will face the following problem:
for a successful attack against blockchain, he/she needs to
invest in hash power. However, the hash power is positively
correlated with the attack cost, λb, and this worsens the
attack condition presented in expression Eq. 2. For example,
according to Nakamoto’s model [17], considering that the
accused has 40% of the network’s hash power, then he/she
needs to satisfy the following inequality,(
λb(0.4)
γ − λw
)
≤ p <
(
2
3
)r
. (3)
However, as time passes, the number of mined blocks
r increases and makes the attack unfeasible. For the game
to be favorable to the accused, the expression Eq. 3 must
be satisfied. However, this will only be possible in the first
blocks (when r is small) because
(
2
3
)r
tends to zero and
λb(0.4)
γ−λw
is positive. This means that while investing in hash
power increases the chances of mining the next block, it also
increases λb(0.4). Therefore, the investment will be useless
if the gains are not much greater than the losses (γ � λw
112 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
and γ � λb), but the hash power is very expensive for, in
fact, to become feasible.
Besides, we emphasize that this attack alone is not
enough, because the accused must also discover the
whistleblower’s identity so that he/she does not repeat
the whistleblowing. For that, he/she needs to perform
the following actions: (1) destroy the whistleblowing; (2)
replace the legitimate chain of blocks, which already has r
public blocks after the whistleblowing, by a fraudulent chain
of blocks; (3) discover the whistleblower’s identity.
At the root of the game, the whistleblower chooses
the action denounce by blockchain, with payoff (2, −λw),
because the action denounce by newspaper represents a
defeat, according to the result of Fig. 3, and for the action
don’t denounce there is no gain or loss for both players.
Thus, the solution of the game is a subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium obtained through the strategy profile
{(denounce by blockchain, revoke anonymity), don’t react}
represented by the solid green lines in Fig. 5. This
equilibrium shows that the best actions of the whistleblower
are denounce by blockchain and after revoke anonymity;
whereas for the accused, the best option is don’t react and
publicly confront the accusations. The result of this game
shows that the implementation of a whistleblowing channel
using blockchain creates a more favorable scenario for
whistleblowing of this type.
7 Resolving conflict of interest using
blockchain and ring signature
The reason why the blockchain eliminates the conflict of
interest is related to its decentralization and immutability.
Just like the blockchain was proposed to withdraw control
over financial data from banks, it can also be used to
withdraw control over the journalistic organizations from
certain denounced people. This sophisticated level of trust
in the stored data eliminates possible manipulation of the
news, thus moving the whistleblower from an unfavorable
high-risk game (Fig. 3) for a more favorable and safe game
(Fig. 5).
7.1 Exploring blockchain to ensure reliability
The approach taken in this paper explores some important
properties of the blockchain to ensure safe whistleblowing
service, and at the same time free of conflicts of interest.
Decentralization. In a traditional whistleblowing chan-
nel, each whistleblowing needs to be analyzed by publishers
who decide whether the whistleblowing deserves to be
published or not. This is the first point of conflict of inter-
est in channels maintained by journalistic organizations.
If the whistleblowing reaches economic or political part-
ners, the whistleblowing is likely to be disregarded. In the
blockchain, instead of centralized decision-making, there is
a consensus mechanism—a set of steps that are taken by
most or all of the nodes in a blockchain to agree on a pro-
posed state or value [32]. Therefore, data can be recorded in
a distributed manner without external interference. Imple-
menting a blockchain-based whistleblowing channel lessens
the power of journalistic organizations to decide which facts
may become public. In this way, blockchain can transfer to
society the power to decide the relevance of published facts.
This offers greater resistance against censorship.
Immutability. In traditional centralized architectures, an
individual must trust the information manager to ensure
data integrity. When a central manager cannot be trusted,
a decentralized infrastructure such as blockchain can be
the key to a trust problem. The blockchain implements a
sophisticated level of trust for the stored data. It ensures that
data is not manipulated, replaced, or falsified by a company
or its employees. Due to the transactions’ immutability, the
accused cannot use their political and economic power to
eliminate the whistleblowing.
To guarantee immutability, the blockchain transactions
are grouped in blocks of data, which are interconnected
through a hash, resulting in a chain of blocks. As each block
references the hash of the previous block, any change in a
transaction changes the block’s identification and, therefore,
makes that block invalid in the chain.
In an attack scenario, a dishonest node attempts to change
a record in a block B, which already has r blocks subsequent
to it in the chain, and works to produce an alternative chain
of blocks larger than the legitimate chain. Meanwhile, the
honest node, which mined the block B, is already mining
the next block r + 1. Thus, to change a given B block
successfully, the attacker must recalculate the proof of work
for block B and for all blocks after B, In such a way that the
attacker can catch up and still overcome the work of honest
nodes. According to Nakamoto [17], this race between the
honest chain and a dishonest chain can be modeled as a
Binomial Random Walk. In this case, the success event is
the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its
lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker’s chain being
extended by one block, reducing the gap by −1. Therefore,
the probability of the attacker catches up the legitimate
chain, from r blocks behind, can be calculated by:
qr =
⎧⎨
⎩
1, if 1 − q ≤ q(
q
1−q
)r
, if 1 − q > q
(4)
where
– 1 − q = probability an honest node finds the next block;
113Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
– q = probability the attacker finds the next block;
– qr = probability the attacker will ever catch up from r
blocks behind.
Note that trust in blockchain depends on the percentage
of dishonest nodes in the network. Considering that the
honest nodes’ population must be larger than the dishonest
nodes’ population, and 1 − q > q, the probability drops
exponentially as the number of blocks that the attacker must
reach increases. This means that the blocks’ immutability is
protected because of the high computational cost required
to modify a register within a block. Therefore, immutability
could only, in fact, be broken if the computational power
under the control of a single dishonest miner (or pool of
miners) is greater than the rest of the network. This scenario
is known as 51% attack, where the dishonest miner has the
ability to attack the network, manipulate the blockchain,
overtake all other nodes, and recalculate the recent hashes
of the blockchain.
7.2 Generation of ring signature
In this subsection, we show how the RST scheme can
implement anonymity. In Section 7.4 we show how the
revocation of anonymity can be implemented [4], which
was inserted in the RST scheme to motivate users to use
the whistleblowing channel when there are conflicts whose
future developments can bring them rewards. Finally, in
Section 8.3 we will discuss how the challenge of network-
level anonymity is essential in this problem. Table 1 present
the terminology usually adopted in the ring signatures
schemes.
Figure 6 represents the generation of ring signature [1]
with support for revocation of anonymity as proposed in
[4]. Given a whistleblowing d and a set of public keys
Pi belonging to ring members, the whistleblower uses his
private key Sw to generate a signature following Protocol 1.
Protocol 1 — GENERATING A RING SIGNATURE
1. The whistleblower Aw randomly picks an initialization
value u ∈ {0, 1}l , where l is the size of u.
2. Aw randomly picks n − 1 values ki which will be used
as a key secret in the HMAC algorithm. For each non-
signer member of the ring will be used a value ki , where
1 ≤ i ≤ n , i �= w and n is the number of members of
the ring.
3. The whistleblower Aw computes
xi = HMAC(ki, d).
The signer is the o w-th member and his value xw will
not be computed as a MAC.
4. Aw computes the values
yi = GPi
(xi),
except yw.
5. The whistleblower Aw computes a hash
z = H(d),
which will be used as the key to select a permutationEz.
6. To close the ring gap, there is a unique value for yw
satisfying the equation C(z,u)(y1, y2, ..., yn) = u, which
can be computed efficiently this way:
α = Ez(yw−1 ⊕ ...Ez(y2 ⊕ Ez(y1 ⊕ u))) (5)
β = Ez
−1(yw+1... ⊕ Ez
−1(yn ⊕ Ez
−1(u))) (6)
yw = α ⊕ β. (7)

7. The whistleblower Aw uses the asymmetric encryption
algorithm GSw , where Sw is his private key, to calculate
xw = GSw(yw). (8)
8. The signature on the whistleblowing d is defined by the
tuple:
σ = (P1, P2, ..., Pn; u; x1, x2, ..., xn). (9)
There is an iteration for each ring’s member – it is
composed by choice of key ki , the calculation HMAC
(ki, d) = xi , and the encryption of xi with a public key Pi .
Note that whistleblower Aw randomly chooses his
position on the ring. Thus, the value α in Eq. 5 is computed
clockwise to the position of Aw−1 and the value β in Eq. 6
is computed anticlockwise to the position of Aw+1.
The publication of the ring signature in the blockchain
can prove to its readers that the whistleblowing came
from a reputable source, such as a presidential cabinet
member or one of an organization’s directors. If all the
members who participate in the ring signature belong to the
same organization, this guarantees the information source’s
authenticity and credibility. In this case, so that they are
identified, each group member must be associated with a
digital certificate via the Certification Authority; thus, it is
possible to identify them using their public key. All the ring
members are suspect, but readers cannot determine the real
signer of the whistleblowing. Therefore, the whistleblower
has perfect protection since the identity is unconditionally
protected by the signature scheme, not depending on any
theoretical computational complexity.
7.3 Verifying the ring signature
Anyone with signature data can verify the information’s
authenticity, but no one can identify which group member
produced the signature. Together with the whistleblowing d
and the signature σ , which contains n public keys Pi that
identify n group members, the whistleblower also publishes
the name of each member of the group, including himself.
By executing Protocol 2, a verifier can verify whether
the signature was made by one of the members of the
organization involved in whistleblowing or not (Fig. 7).
Protocol 2 — VERIFYING A RING SIGNATURE
1. For i = 1, 2, ..., n the verifier computes
GPi
(xi) = yi .
2. The verifier computes the key to E:
H(d) = z.
3. Finally, the verifier checks that the yi = GPi
(xi) satisfy
the equation
C(z,u)(y1, y2, ..., yn) = ũ = u. (10)
4. If the ring Eq. 10 is satisfied, the verifier accepts the
signature as valid. Otherwise, the verifier rejects the
signature.
7.4 Revocation of anonymity
The original ring signature scheme [1] guarantees
anonymity to the whistleblower, but does not allow him/her
to reveal himself/herself as the author of the whistleblow-
ing in the future. In cases where whistleblowing gains
great social importance, it is essential for the whistle-
blower to be able to prove unequivocally that he/she is the
author of the whistleblowing, especially in cases where
awards are offered due to the action’s relevance and where
the post-whistleblowing scenario does not pose a risk to
the whistleblower’s safety. In this paper, the proposal to
revoke the whistleblower’s anonymity adopts the protocols
presented in [4].
Based on the game tree shown in Fig. 5, the whistle-
blower can choose whether to preserve his anonymity after

the repercussion of the whistleblowing or to revoke his
anonymity and proof that he made the whistleblowing.
To prove that he is the author of the whistleblowing, the
whistleblower claims to have secret information
ki = {k1, k2, ..., k(w−1), k(w+1), ..., kn}
able to produce the respective values
xi = {x1, x2, ..., x(w−1), x(w+1), ..., xn}.
Note that xw was not generated in the same way as xi . To
convince the verifier, the whistleblower reveals the values
ki and suggests to the verifier that he performs the steps in
Protocol 3.
Protocol 3 — REVOCATION OF ANONYMITY
1. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n e i �= w, the verifier computes the MAC
xi = HMAC(ki, d).
2. The whistleblower declares that he is w-th member of
the ring and that xw is the result of:
xw = GSw(yw),
where yw was calculated according to Eq. 7.
3. The verifier checks that the
xi ∈ (P1, P2, ..., Pn; u; x1, x2, ..., xn).
If the result is true then the verifier can identify the real
signer.
If there is an award to the whistleblower, all ring mem-
bers will probably be interested in this reward and claim
that they have produced such a signature. However, when
the real whistleblower reveals the secret values ki , and use
them as the secret key to calculate the MACs, such as xi =
HMAC(ki, d), everyone should be convinced that he/she
generated the signature, since that only he/she knows the
values ki . Thus, the whistleblower can prove that he/she, in
fact, produced the signature σ .
8 Discussion
In this paper, the combination of blockchain with a ring sig-
nature scheme allows the construction of a platform capa-
ble of making the scenario of anonymous whistleblowing
entirely favorable for the whistleblower.
8.1 Guarantee of inviolability of the whistleblowing
As the attack depends on the percentage of nodes controlled
by the attacker, then the most crucial factor in blockchain
security is the total cost to attack and change the stored data.
So, the more expensive it is to control the majority of nodes
on a blockchain, the more secure it will be [33].
To better understand the blockchain’s security, we can
observe, without loss of generality, the stability of the
Bitcoin system. In [34], some scenarios were presented
in which the system could be attacked. Among them,
two scenarios are directly related to this blockchain-based
whistleblowing channel: (1) the formation of a 51% cartel
and (2) Goldfinger attack.
In a scenario where there is formation of a 51% cartel
in the blockchain network, participants lose confidence in
the system, since they do not know if a transaction is
coming from the cartel or an honest user. In this way, if the
participants wish to preserve the network’s good functioning
to obtain the rewards, then the cartel is undesirable. Besides,
it is unlikely that a 51% attack will generate enough reward
for the attackers to compensate for the formation of the
cartel.
The second scenario shows how an adversary motivated
by political or social issues could be able to destroy
the system. This scenario is described as the Goldfinger
116 Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
attack, where the attacker does not seek rewards within the
network. The attacker wishes to destroy the system to obtain
utility out of the network. In this case, for the attacker to
have guaranteed success, he/she needs to pay the miners a
value that exceeds the entire value of the network.
Note that to destroy the whistleblowing published by a
blockchain-based channel, the accused must consider one of
the above scenarios. In either case, it is very expensive and
very time-consuming. Besides, in the interval of time, while
the accused prepares an attack strategy, the whistleblowing
has already become public and is probably already in the
hands of authorities or the press. Therefore, for the accused,
it is unfeasible to eliminate whistleblowing.
8.2 Guarantee of anonymity and revocation of
anonymity
In a scenario where the whistleblowing channel is executed
in the blockchain, we have seen that only the attack on the
blockchain is not enough, since the accused also needs to
find out the identity of the whistleblower so that he/she does
not repeat the whistleblowing. If the whistleblower remains
anonymous, then the attack’s cost becomes unlimited
for the accused after the successive publication of the
whistleblowing. Therefore, anonymity is a fundamental
property for a blockchain-based whistleblowing channel.
A non-signer should not be able to convince a verifier that
he/she is the author of the whistleblowing because he/she is
not able to efficiently compute the values xi of the signature
σ = (P1, P2, ..., Pn; u; x1, x2, ..., xn).
Note that each value xi is a MAC that depends on the
whistleblowing d and a secret key ki , which is random.
Thus, for each z and u, the ring equation has 2|k|(n−1)
solutions. Therefore, the secret keys ki , used in the HMAC
algorithm [26], ensure that any other member of the ring
cannot assume the authorship of the whistleblowing.
Any member of the ring, motivated by a reward, may
attempt to find the keys ki and assume the whistleblowing
authorship. In this case, he/she needs to calculate
HMAC(k, d) = x1
for all possible values of k, that is 2|k|, until he/she finds
a key that matches x1. Note that this effort is to find only
one key k, but for the attacker to assume the whistleblowing
authorship, he/she needs n − 1 keys (the value of xw was
not computed through HMAC). Thus, the size of the keys ki
chosen by the whistleblower helps ensure his/her credibility
as the author of the whistleblowing.
8.3 Other ways to strengthen whistleblower
anonymity
The cryptographic techniques discussed hitherto (ring
signature and HMAC) only prevent that the authorship of
the whistleblowing leaks from the signature. However, they
do not avoid inferences that take advantage of network-
level information (for example, IP addresses) or access
patterns (obtained, for example, from specific blocks or
parts thereof).
To avoid discovering the authorship of the whistleblow-
ing through analysis of whistleblower’s access data, some
measures must be taken in the design of the front-end
and the blockchain. Initially, it is necessary to have some
instructions to the users or heuristics that detect that the
whistleblowing has a bias that suggests who is the author.
This will allow the whistleblower to make a treatment in
the whistleblowing before making it public. As for the
blockchain network, in [30] it was suggested that privacy
protocols unlink the network-level information of the users
of their transactions. The suggestion is to use mechanisms
that take advantage of the overlay structure that already
exists in blockchains networks to advertise transactions,
since this seems to be a natural way to do publications
anonymously, instead of relying on an external service like
Tor.
9 Conclusion
The best sources of whistleblowing are those nearest
to the facts. However, to make whistleblowing in such
circumstances is a high-risk action because a centralized
whistleblowing channel may be vulnerable to a conflict
of interest. This makes the game among whistleblower,
accused, and journalistic organizations not favorable to
whistleblowing.
To ensure a scenario favorable to the whistleblower,
we propose a blockchain-based anonymous whistleblow-
ing channel. Through game theory, we have shown that
the decentralization and immutability of a blockchain that
offers privacy at the network level can eliminate journalistic
conflicts of interest that can arise in centralized organi-
zations. We also show that cryptographic functions help
achieve a Nash equilibrium in favor of the whistleblower
in this game, thus creating a favorable environment for this
type of whistleblowing.
We have shown that the blockchain is essential to resolv-
ing the conflict of interest, since whistleblowing cannot be
eliminated by the accused using its political or economic
influence, as can happen in traditional whistleblowing
117Ann. Telecommun. (2022) 77:101–118
channels. At the same time, the credibility of the whistle-
blowing comes from the ring signature scheme. A system
like this is essential for investigative journalism and social
organizations that value the right to information.
We argue that the channel is able to withstand the
following attacks: (1) destruction or alteration of the
whistleblowing, due to the immutability of the blockchain;
(2) breach of anonymity due to the ring signature scheme
using symmetric and asymmetric encryption; (3) claim the
authorship of the whistleblowing improperly, due to the
collision-resistant MACs.
