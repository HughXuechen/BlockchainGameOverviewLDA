32.1 Introduction – The Digital Health Revolution 567
32.1  Introduction – The Digital Health Revolution
Arguably one of the greatest drivers of economic participation and prosperity in low‐ 
and middle‐income countries (LMICs) over the last generation has been the advent of 
mobile banking. A decade since its founding in 2007, the Kenyan service M‐PESA now 
enables over 20 million people in Africa to transfer money and receive micro‐credit 
using their mobile phones (Harford 2017). (M‐Pesa [M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for 
money] is a mobile phone‐based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, 
launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network 
operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, 
and India.) M‐Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods 
and services easily with a mobile device. The downstream effects are clear  –  digital 
banking has made it possible for millions of people to receive a stable income, has 
reduced the risk of corruption, and opened new channels of commerce. The BBC has 
called it the “M‐PESA Revolution.” Mobile banking was revolutionary not because the 
technology was advanced, but because it was simple. This was a way to leverage existing 
mobile network infrastructure to solve the burning economic need for simple, secure 
payments.
The same trend is playing out in healthcare, where simple technologies are being co‐
opted to deliver critical health services in low resource environments in Africa and 
other areas. The need is even more pressing than for financial transactions, with 400 
million people still lacking access to essential health services based on a 2015 World 
Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank Group report (Joint WHO/World Bank 
Group Report 2015). Meanwhile, the burden of chronic disease in low‐ and middle‐
income countries continues to rise precipitously. Over 85% of the premature deaths 
attributed to chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occur in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
(WHO 2013). The economic burden of this unchecked rise of non‐communicable dis-
eases (NCDs) in the LMICs has been estimated at US$7 trillion over a 15‐year times-
pan. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set a 2030 target 
to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one third; to curb the infectious epidemics 
of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and other tropical diseases; and to reduce 
maternal mortality by providing universal access to reproductive health services. 
However, the global medical workforce looks to be overwhelmed by these looming pub-
lic health trends, with the WHO estimating a shortage of almost 13 million healthcare 
workers internationally by 2035 (Global Health Workforce Alliance and World Health 
Organization 2013). The bold vision of the SDGs will only be achieved by rapidly upscal-
ing the capacity of an already overburdened healthcare infrastructure using digital 
technologies.
Accompanying the rising burden of chronic disease is the increasing digital literacy 
of  the LMICs. According to the most recent estimates from the International 
Telecommunication Union, mobile phone penetration in LMICs is approximately 85% 
in the 15–74 age group, with a rising rate of mobile broadband subscriptions, at 44 per 
100 persons in 2017 (International Telecommunication Union 2017). Meanwhile, plum-
meting costs of computers, tablets, and wearable devices are creating a rich digital 
infrastructure even in low resource settings.
The last decade has seen tremendous innovation in the use of mobile technologies 
for healthcare delivery (mHealth) and the development of clinical software and data

 platforms (eHealth). From Nicaragua to Zimbabwe, there has been a wide array of digi-
tal health interventions, from large‐scale public health efforts based around short mes-
sage services (SMS) and smartphone apps, through to grassroots initiatives built by 
community health workers to streamline their own workflows. Some of the most suc-
cessful examples have come from maternal health – delivering ante‐ and postnatal care 
via SMS and telemedicine services. However, the applications are far reaching, from 
point‐of‐care TB screening, to gamified platforms for self‐management of chronic dis-
eases, to inventory management and capacity planning services for health administra-
tors. (Gamification software is any tool or platform used for applying game mechanics 
to non‐game contexts in order to boost engagement and successful end‐results. 
Common use cases include customer loyalty, e‐learning, employee engagement, and 
performance management.) The value proposition is clear: digital technologies stand 
to increase healthcare access, improve clinical outcomes and reduce cost.
Traditionally, mHealth has involved SMS reminders and telemedicine consults; how-
ever, the proliferation of smartphones presents a range of new possibilities. Smartphone 
penetration in the LMICs rose from 21% to 37% between 2013 and 2015 (Poushter 
2016), although East Africa and South Asia continue to lag behind global averages, with 
25 and 30% penetration in 2017 respectively (GSMA Intelligence 2017a). Nevertheless, 
an increasing proportion of the world’s population stands to carry with them a com-
puter thousands of times more powerful than NASA’s Apollo navigation systems, with 
a suite of sensors such as a gyroscope, camera and global positioning system (GPS) 
poised to collect new streams of physiological and behavioral data. Illiteracy and lan-
guage barriers continue to be challenges. However, in the words of one MobileMedic 
user: “Even though I am not able to read and write, I am able to work with this mobile 
phone” (MedicMobile 2018). Capitalizing on this ambient technology in an engaged 
user base will open the door to a new mHealth revolution far beyond the traditional 
SMS reminder services.
This Chapter presents a high level overview of mHealth and eHealth technologies in 
the LMICs, highlighting key emerging trends, critical challenges and presenting a vision 
for the future. While we refer to these technologies collectively as “digital health,” we 
recognize that the “broad church” of digital health contains further diversity still, includ-
ing technologies such as wearables, virtual reality, and predictive analytics. While these 
technologies certainly have potential in low resource settings, the majority of case stud-
ies to date have related to mHealth and eHealth.
For this Chapter we have cataloged 120 such applications that were developed for, and 
typically in, low‐income countries. This is by no means a comprehensive list. However, 
it is broadly representative of the digital health solutions identified by searching 
PubMed, the WHO Digital Health Atlas, the GSMA 2017 review of digital health trends 
in developing markets and a range of local and international mobile health news outlets. 
Sixty‐eight per cent had significant operations in Africa, 28% in Asia and 13% in Latin 
America, with several solutions having inter‐continental footprints and counted in each 
region. Although many solutions have multiple functionalities, 17% were categorized as 
being predominantly focused on patient education and awareness campaigns, 23% on 
self‐management and remote monitoring, 35% on empowering frontline healthcare 
workers and managing electronic medical records, 4% on powering remote diagnostic 
devices, 13% on disease‐tracking and epidemiology, 5% on financing and insurance and 
3% on inventory management and supply chain.

32.3 HIV/AIDS 569
32.2  The Current Landscape
To set the scene I begin by reviewing three clinical use‐cases where digital health has 
been applied across the continuum of care. Specifically, I focus on one communicable 
disease (HIV), one non‐communicable disease (diabetes mellitus) and maternal health.
32.3  HIV/AIDS
According to WHO estimates there were almost 37 million people living with HIV in 
2016, of which over 25 million lived in Africa (World Health Organization 2017). 
Despite the development of effective anti‐retroviral therapies (ART), an estimated one 
million people die each year from AIDS‐related causes. The ongoing AIDS epidemic is 
multifactorial, related to awareness, cultural stigma and treatment access and 
adherence.
One problem space where digital health is making a particular impact is ensuring 
adherence to ART regimens for HIV‐positive subjects. WelTel is an international 
platform specializing in SMS support programs for HIV. In a landmark randomized 
study in Kenya WelTel sent patients in the treatment group a weekly text message 
starting with a simple “mambo?” (“how are you?”) (Lester et al. 2010). This weekly 
check‐in was associated with improved adherence to ART (relative risk [RR] of 
non‐adherence 0.81) and reduced viral load (RR 0.84). Other solutions are attempt-
ing to assist care providers. iDART (intelligent Dispensing of Anti‐Retroviral 
Treatment) is an open‐source software platform developed by the South African 
non‐governmental organization (NGO) Cell‐Life, which helps pharmacies in the 
distribution of ART by offering inventory management, patient tracking and effi-
cient barcoding so that medication packages can be reliably sent to remote distri-
bution sites.
While medication adherence is an issue for those on treatment, there is also the 
upstream issue that many subjects are not screened for HIV. An estimated 24% of HIV‐
positive individuals in South Africa remained undiagnosed as of 2012, although this 
number is declining (Johnson et al. 2015). In order to reach the UNAIDS target of 90% 
diagnosis rate by 2020, various mobile health solutions have attempted to increase 
awareness of testing services. An early example was Project Masiluleke, which used the 
clever strategy of inserting screening advice into the blank space of “Please call me” 
SMS messages indicating that HIV screening were being offered for free in South Africa. 
In their first year of deployment in 2008/2009, they saw a tripling in the number of calls 
made to South Africa’s AIDS Helpline (Project Masiluleke 2009).
More recent initiatives are even more comprehensive. The Moyo project in 
Lesotho also aims to improve the access of remote communities to HIV screening 
and ART. Mobile clinics visit these communities offering free HIV testing and 
simultaneously register patients into a surveillance database via a smartphone 
application (app). If a patient needs medical attention or is unable to access ART, 
they are sent money for transportation to the nearest health facility using third‐
party mobile banking tools. In a country where 40% of pregnancy‐related mortality 
is attributed to HIV, this holistic solution for remote communities is extremely 
promising.

32.4  Diabetes Mellitus
The prevailing pattern of morbidity in the LMICs has shifted from infectious diseases 
to non‐communicable diseases, of which diabetes represents a significant burden. Eight 
and one half per cent of the adult population has diabetes internationally, with preva-
lence rising fastest in low‐ and middle‐income countries (WHO 2016). The penetration 
of mobile phones into the population, and into the daily life of the individual, makes 
them a natural tool to effect behavioral change in chronic diseases. mHealth solutions 
have been deployed throughout the continuum of care for diabetes, from preventative 
medicine through to screening, diagnosis and longitudinal support for both patient and 
clinician.
With the International Diabetes Federation estimating that two thirds of diabetics in 
Africa remain undiagnosed (International Diabetes Federation 2017), screening is a 
particular priority. A variety of simple risk scoring tools exist, which have been pack-
aged into mobile apps for use by patients and community health workers. The Diabetes 
Online Risk Assessment (DORA) initiative was launched across 12 African nations to 
provide an accessible web‐based tool for diabetes risk stratification. Moderate and 
high‐risk patients were given an electronic voucher for a blood sugar level (BSL) test 
which could be performed at local pharmacies, and those found to have high sugar 
readings received a diabetes management app with educational resources and symptom 
tracking, as well as a home BSL monitor.
Mobile technologies have also been used to screen for specific diabetic complications 
such as diabetic retinopathy. “Fundus on the Phone” is one example of a smartphone‐
enabled device for capturing high‐quality retinal scans, currently deployed in Bangalore, 
India. Additionally, the PEEK Retina is a portable ophthalmoscope that connects to a 
smartphone, allowing remote ophthalmologists to make a diagnosis and suggest treat-
ment strategies (see Chapter 25).
A new class of self‐management platforms for diabetes has recently emerged through-
out the LMICs. The Indian company JanaCare is one of the leaders in this space, having 
developed a suite of tools including a smartphone test‐strip able to perform blood glu-
cose levels, HBA1c levels, a lipid profile and hemoglobin levels, as well as behavioral 
coaching through an app called Habits with personalized advice and goal‐setting, and a 
physician dashboard that allows patients to be monitored remotely. In Senegal an app is 
helping diabetic patients better manage their sugar levels during the Ramadan fast. 
mRamadan is an SMS reminder service that provides advice for patients and care‐ 
providers around diet and medication titration in the context of fasting.
Evidence is emerging to suggest that engagement with diabetes management apps is 
associated with improved clinical outcomes. A systematic review of mHealth diabetes 
interventions in mostly high‐resource settings found a significant reduction in HbA1c 
in patients “treated” with a mobile app (Kitsiou et al. 2017). This has led to an emerging 
view of diabetes management apps known as “digital therapeutics.”
32.5  Maternal Health
Each day approximately 830 women die during pregnancy or childbirth from prevent-
able causes. Ninety‐nine per cent of these women live in LMICs (WHO 2016). The 
Sustainable Development Goals call for a reduction in maternal mortality to less than

70 per 100 000 live births by 2030 with universal access to reproductive health services. 
This is a particular challenge in low‐income countries because of significant resource 
shortages, especially in the maternal health workforce. In 2010, the UN launched the 
Every Woman Every Child initiative – a global movement advocating for major mater-
nal health reform – which pioneered mHealth initiatives through a targeted grant pro-
gram and support resources. Digital health is seen as an opportunity to upscale the 
capacity of overburdened health services by empowering mothers, training community 
health workers and better distributing specialized resources.
The Wired Mothers initiative in Zanzibar is a classical mHealth intervention involv-
ing SMS‐based reminders during the antenatal and postnatal periods, as well as tele-
consults with a midwife. It was an early example of rigorous evaluation with a cluster 
randomized trial – a trial which ultimately demonstrated an increase in the number of 
prenatal visits and a reduction in overall maternal mortality (from 3.6 to 1.9%) (GSMA 
Intelligence 2017; Sondaal et al. 2016). There are many similar solutions: the Mobile 
Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) has developed SMS‐based pregnancy quizzes 
and an interactive question‐and‐answer service. The MayMay app from Myanmar pro-
vides regular antenatal reminders, educational tips and a listing of local doctors that 
women can access directly.
Alongside the wealth of patient‐facing pregnancy apps is a growing class of tools 
designed for healthcare workers, which attempt to address the severe workforce short-
age by upskilling existing staff. MedicMobile is a San Francisco based not‐for‐profit 
organization that has implemented a number of open‐source solutions for health work-
ers in low-resource settings across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Their maternal 
health package enables community health workers to register pregnancies, track antena-
tal care visits and screen for high‐risk pregnancies and red flags. A systematic review of 
mobile solutions for maternal health workers found widespread applications of mobile 
technologies for providing education, tracking patients, collecting epidemiological data, 
and communicating between care providers. However, more evidence around the impact 
on maternal and neonatal outcomes must be gathered (Sondaal et al. 2016).
32.6  Core Functionalities
The previous section reviewed the breadth of digital health solutions within three clini-
cal verticals. We now draw out the common functionalities that appear across clinical 
domains. Figure 32.1 shows a breakdown of these core functionalities, categorized into 
patient‐facing and clinician‐facing functions.
These functions may be viewed as the building blocks of digital health tools – a useful 
frame‐of‐reference in an ecosystem that is increasingly modular, with open‐source 
packages for various functions that may be stitched together into a custom app. The 
sections below briefly review each of these functions and provide relevant examples.
32.7  Patient‐facing Functions
32.7.1 Patient Education
Patient education is among the most fundamental functions of digital health tools in 
low‐resource settings. A number of systematic reviews in the maternal and child health

space found that the provision of educational resources was the most common function 
(Chen et al. 2018; Sondaal et al. 2016). Patient education can be provided either pas-
sively or actively. The former refers to automated content delivered via mobile or web; 
the latter refers to interactive dialog with the patient via telemedicine or chatbots. Key 
challenges across the spectrum include
1) Ensuring content is accurate and up‐to‐date,
2) Making content engaging to users. A range of engagement strategies have proved 
effective, from simple SMS‐based quizzes for HIV education (for example, using 
Text to Change in Uganda) to more sophisticated gamification such as the Fooya app, 
which aims to promote healthy eating habits and targets childhood metabolic syn-
drome in India and beyond.
32.7.2 Service Linkage and Reminders
mHealth tools can assist patients both in finding relevant health programs and in 
reminding patients of their appointment schedule. Numerous examples of SMS‐ and 
app‐based reminders exist in the management of HIV, TB, antenatal care, diabetes, 
asthma and mental health. One systematic review across low‐ and high‐resource set-
tings showed improved follow‐up adherence in 77% of studies using text reminders 
(Kannisto et al. 2014). Reminder services have been particularly effective in vaccination 
uptake, with one study in Zimbabwe showing a significant increase in childhood immu-
nizations with simple SMS reminders (Bangure et al. 2015).
32.7.3 Self‐management and Remote Monitoring
Self‐management refers to solutions that empower patients to be in control of their own 
care, from assisted diagnosis through to longitudinal disease management. The related

concept of remote monitoring refers to any two‐way communication between patients 
and care providers that enables remote care delivery. I have discussed some of the appli-
cations in diabetes and antenatal care above, largely based around interactive mobile 
software and telemedicine consults with remote healthcare workers. However, the rise 
of sophisticated home sensors is creating a new dimension to self‐management. One 
example is UChek, a low‐cost urine dipstick reader powered by a smartphone. The asso-
ciated app gives readings directly to patients about the presence of urinary leukocytes 
or high glucose, enabling assisted triage for conditions such as urinary tract infections 
as well as better home management of diabetes.
32.7.4 Medication Adherence
Medication non‐adherence is known to be a significant contributor to morbidity in 
both communicable diseases such as HIV and TB, and in NCDs such as congestive 
heart failure. mHealth approaches to medication adherence range from simple SMS 
reminder services, video messages, regular phone calls by healthcare workers, and gam-
ified medication journals powered by smartphone apps. In TB, where directly observed 
therapy (DOT) is recommended, medication adherence tools have needed to become 
more rigorous, with creative techniques such as video observation of therapy (VOT), 
embedded sensors in tablets, smart pill bottles, and low‐cost urine tests which detect 
relevant drug metabolites (DiStefano and Schmidt 2016).
32.7.5 Financing and Insurance
mHealth is helping to streamline the finances of healthcare in the same way as mobile 
banking has streamlined general commerce. With over 75% of Kenyans uninsured, the 
Grameen Foundation pioneered the Uzima Project – a low‐cost health insurance prod-
uct interlinked with a smartphone app that provides patient education and reminders 
(Grameen Foundation 2018). Meanwhile, another Kenyan innovation, Changamka 
Microhealth, is allowing patients to set aside money for medical treatments with prede-
fined costings for procedures. mHealth platforms have also begun to offer financial 
incentives for positive behavioral change. A systematic review of 10 such programs 
offering conditional cash transfers for healthy behaviors in low‐resource environments 
showed increased utilization of preventative health services and, in some cases, 
improved clinical outcomes (Lagarde et al. 2007).
32.8  Clinician‐facing Functions
32.8.1 Clinical Decision Support
Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are being used to upskill community health 
workers with minimal training to deliver high‐quality evidence‐based care. This deci-
sion support can be in the form of clinician education about consensus guidelines. An 
example is the sending of regular text messages with guidance about malaria manage-
ment (which improved adherence when trialed in Kenya) (Zurovac et al. 2011). CDS 
may also involve point‐of‐care advice, personalized to the patient at hand. The George 
Institute for Global Health developed the SMARTHealth India system  –  a plain‐

language mobile CDS tool to conduct cardiovascular screening and basic management 
in rural India (Praveen et al. 2014). This enabled task‐shifting from physicians to com-
munity health workers and allowed more intelligent triage of patients requiring 
 specialist review. One CDS system in Pakistan even empowered laypeople from the 
community to screen others for TB, with financial incentives for case reporting (Khan 
et al. 2012). A review of CDS platforms deployed in sub‐Saharan Africa for conditions 
including pneumonia, antenatal care, pediatric triage and hypertension, found signifi-
cant potential in the use of such mHealth tools by health workers, although evidence 
around outcome improvement was still lacking (Adepoju et  al. 2017). More work is 
needed on translating high level treatment guidelines into practical advice at the point‐
of‐care. This ecosystem would likely benefit from a library of clinically‐validated deci-
sion support tools accessible via application programming interfaces (APIs).
32.8.2 Specialist Advice
Myanmar was ranked last in a WHO ranking of 190 international health systems in 
2000, and has faced ongoing challenges since. The first Myanmar‐based telemedicine 
solution was implemented in 2014 for the purpose of providing specialist advice to 
remote clinicians (Leroux et al. 2016). Rural health workers were able to send x‐rays, 
ECGs and ultrasound images to specialists in Yangon, as well as requesting support via 
video consultation. The service had promising uptake, with over 4500 specialist con-
sults provided in the 16 month trial period. In Tanzania First Derm is being used by 
local physicians for dermatology support, with images being sent via the app to consult-
ants in Dar es Salaam to select which patients should be referred for specialist investiga-
tion (Chung and Hyunsoo 2017). In Botswana similar technology is being used to 
transmit cervical photographs for review by specialist gynecologists, providing effective 
cervical cancer screening to women in remote communities (Quinley et al. 2011).
32.8.3 Communication and Workflow
mHealth technologies are helping clinicians to communicate with one another in order 
to streamline various components of their daily workflows. In Ghana and Liberia, the 
MDNet Program allows free physician‐to‐physician communication nationwide to pro-
mote education and collaboration. mHealth also accelerates feedback loops so that test 
results are communicated rapidly and not overlooked. An example is in Zambia where 
SMS is used for delivering infant HIV screening results back to the referring clinician 
more rapidly (Seidenberg et al. 2012).
32.9  Electronic Medical Record Management
Even in the highest resource settings electronic medical records (EMRs) are challenging 
to implement and configure, with significant shortcomings around user interface and 
interoperability. A number of simple modular EMR architectures have been developed 
for low resource settings, notably OpenMRS – an open‐source EMR suite built and sup-
ported by a distributed community of developers. Even basic EMRs can help streamline

patient care, capacity planning and observational research, especially if data starts to be 
collected longitudinally and shared between care providers (Williams and Boren 2008).
32.10  Point‐of‐Care Diagnostic Tests
mHealth solutions provide the backbone for the emerging sector of point‐of‐care diag-
nostics. Swasthya Slate is a mobile platform paired with a number of low‐cost sensors, 
which allows a healthcare worker to perform over 30 diagnostic tests from vital signs 
through to rapid tests for HIV and syphilis (Wunker 2014). The platform, which also 
offers patient record management and decision support for the clinician, has now been 
deployed widely across India. A number of tools are leveraging the higher‐performing 
cameras in smartphones to analyze blood samples for malaria (for example, Lifelens) 
and screen for anemia based on the color of the sclera (for example, Eyenaemia).
32.11  Epidemiology
During the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, mHealth apps such as the Ebola Care 
App were used to provide real‐time information from the field about new exposures. 
This allowed health authorities and NGOs to track the epidemic, better allocate 
resources and facilitate contact‐tracing. The open‐source tool GeoChat is being used to 
track disease outbreaks such as cholera and avian influenza in Cambodia via crowd-
sourced updates (http://instedd.org/technologies/geochat). Similar systems have been 
deployed for malnutrition, vaccine coverage and dengue fever. The same principle of 
mobile‐powered data collection can be extended beyond the acute setting of outbreak 
tracking to epidemiological surveys and academic research.
32.12  Inventory Management and Supply Chain
A survey of 12 national AIDS programs in 2011 found that 67% of countries experi-
enced episodes of insufficient antiretroviral stock lasting an average of 40 days, largely 
due to maldistribution and forecasting problems (Sued et  al. 2011). mHealth can be 
used to build supply chain resilience by allowing frontline healthcare workers to moni-
tor inventory and by enabling citizens to report counterfeit medications that can arise 
in times of undersupply (Agarwal et al. 1996). In Malawi, for example, cStock was devel-
oped to track medication inventory, providing dashboards for monitoring stock levels 
across the community and sending text messages to health workers when new stock 
became available.
32.13  Challenges to Scale
Despite the volume of new mHealth initiatives, few projects manage to achieve scale 
beyond the pilot stage. The WHO has recently published their MAPS (mHealth 
Assessment and Planning for Scale) toolkit as a framework for digital health solutions

to cross that bridge from pilot to established initiative (WHO 2015). MAPS outline six 
“axes of scale”: groundwork, partnerships, financial sustainability, technology architec-
ture, operations, and monitoring/evaluation. The toolkit provides self‐assessment tools 
to strengthen an mHealth program along each axis. In the following section, I will zoom 
out one level and present four common challenges that the digital health ecosystem at 
large is facing as it matures and scales.
32.13.1 Evidence‐based Practice
Evidence‐based clinical content is critical for scalability, but is often overlooked in 
 digital health designs. A review of apps for TB prevention found numerous examples 
with poorly‐substantiated and, in some cases, incorrect information, with only 2 of 24 
apps citing peer‐reviewed publications (Iribarren et al. 2016). Although the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is bolstering oversight around digital health (US Food 
and Drug Administration 2017), mHealth solutions in the LMICs continue to operate 
without any clinical vetting process. Txt2MEDLINE in Botswana aims to tackle this 
problem by allowing physicians to question MEDLINE literature via SMS. The ecosys-
tem would benefit from more open‐source documents, specifically clinically approved 
educational resources with multi‐language support that could be readily customized 
and integrated into new tools. Ideally this would include multimedia options such as 
educational graphics and videos. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly important to 
gather evidence around clinical outcomes following mHealth interventions. Although 
many of the systematic reviews in this space lament the shortage of high‐quality evi-
dence beyond feasibility studies (Chib et al. 2015; Oliver‐Williams et al. 2017), others 
argue that the rigor of mHealth studies is increasing rapidly (Labrique et  al. 2013). 
Digital health innovators are realizing that they must improve clinical endpoints or 
reduce costs in order to gain widespread adoption.
32.13.2 Integration into Clinical Workflows
A common pitfall of digital health interventions is a lack of integration with the sur-
rounding health infrastructure, resulting in multiple, fragmented point solutions. 
Successful initiatives, such as the deployment of the CommCare app by the m4Change2 
project in Nigeria, have been deeply embedded within existing care pathways. This was 
a simple case‐management and decision support tool for Nokia and Android devices, 
deployed across 10 rural primary health centers. However, the healthcare workers 
received good quality training and were able to use the app alongside their pre‐existing 
workflows. Additionally, the system tied into a cash‐transfer scheme supported by the 
federal health authorities to provide a small incentive payment to women accessing 
antenatal care. The same integration mantra applies for patient‐facing tools – they are 
most valuable if they are interlinked with the health ecosystem, for example by connect-
ing patients to relevant facilities or providing telemedicine support from local 
physicians.
32.13.3 Financial Sustainability
It can be difficult for digital health solutions to draw revenue from the end user, hence 
creative funding models must be considered. Many of the most successful initiatives to

date have been funded by governments or NGOs. However, large technology compa-
nies such as Philips and GE, along with many of the cellular networks such as Telefonica 
and Telenor are contributing significantly to the ecosystem. There are also several 
recent examples of public–private partnerships being used as a successful model for 
building digital health infrastructure in the LMICs. An example is the one between 
Philips and Telkom Indonesia for mobile obstetric monitoring (GMSA Intelligence 
2017; Latif et al. 2017). A recent set of recommendations from the United States National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for USAID to provide seed 
funding to local governments in order to facilitate public–private collaborations (Dzau 
et al. 2017).
As health systems internationally move toward bundled or capitated payment 
schemes, there may also be more scope for digital health programs to provide preventa-
tive medicine in return for a share of cost savings. AxisMed is a chronic disease manage-
ment platform in Brazil that has created a business case around reducing overall 
expenditure through decreased emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In 
Bangladesh Telenor and Grameenphone have developed Tonic – a health management 
platform offering education, service linkage, telemedicine consults and emergency 
insurance packages to over two million users – based around a low‐cost subscription 
model where users pay a monthly access fee (US$1–4). Digital health innovators must 
consider creative reimbursement models to support their initiatives.
32.13.4 Technical Scalability
There are inherent limitations associated with mobile phone technologies in extremely 
low‐resource environments. Mobile Internet continues to be lacking in some regions, and 
up to 10% of the world’s population (predominantly in sub‐Saharan Africa and rural Asia) 
still live without any cellular connectivity (GSMA Intelligence 2015). There can be issues 
around electricity coverage, phone battery life and the cost of mobile devices, making 
access to the most vulnerable populations an ongoing challenge (Latif et al. 2017).
Another aspect of achieving technical scale is data interoperability. It is important for 
digital health tools to be able to push and pull information from other health IT sys-
tems; however, to date there has been poor adherence to standards such as HL7 and 
FHIR. (Health Level‐7 or HL7 refers to a set of international standards for transfer of 
clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various health-
care providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is “layer 7” in the 
OSI model. The OSI model is The Open Systems Interconnection model, a conceptual 
model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecom-
munication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure 
and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with 
standard protocols. The HL7 standards are produced by the Health Level Seven 
International, an international standards organization, and are adopted by other stand-
ards issuing bodies such as American National Standards Institute and International 
Organization for Standardization. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, 
pronounced “fire”) is a draft standard describing data formats and elements (known as 
“resources”) and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic 
health records).
Digital health tools that support interoperability will help to power the emerging par-
adigm of data sharing and large‐scale analytics, which stands to improve efficiency at a

systems level (Latif et al. 2017). In Malaysia, the 2016–2020 eHealth strategy empha-
sizes interoperability as a key priority, aiming toward a “one person, one record” health 
system with an associated data warehouse (World Health Organisation, Malaysian 
Ministry of Health 2016).
Finally, data security and privacy must be a priority for technical scale, especially 
when dealing with vulnerable populations and highly sensitive information such as HIV 
status. The ecosystem would benefit from a simplified version of HIPAA (Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, US) and GDPR (General Data Protection 
Regulation, EU), the prevailing health data privacy guidelines for the western world, 
tailored to low‐resource settings with practical guidance around identity management 
and encryption.
32.14  Emerging Trends and Future Vision
As the digital health ecosystem overcomes the challenges listed above, it can be pre-
dicted that a number of trends will emerge in moving from the “SMS era” into one of 
interactive, personalized digital health. Some of these trends have been pioneered in 
high-resource settings, fueled by the massive injections of talent and capital into digital 
health in recent years. However, others germinated in low-resource settings and are 
rapidly gaining momentum. I briefly highlight some of the most promising trends.
32.14.1 Modularity and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
The OpenMRS example is an open source, community‐supported suite of EMR 
modules that can be analogized across digital health. The Be He@lthy Be Mobile 
campaign from the WHO aims to scale up national digital health initiatives by pro-
viding reusable mHealth toolkits, streamlined service models and collaboration plat-
forms for digital health globally (WHO 2014). Imagine if local health organizations 
could drag and drop functionalities into templated software products with easy‐to‐
use software development kits (SDKs), plug into the latest diagnostic and treatment 
guidelines using application programming interfaces (APIs), and connect with third‐
party services such as telemedicine consults. Technical modularity is helping to 
power the revolution toward human‐centered design, where solutions are created in 
close consultation with end‐users, and thus reshaping digital health more broadly 
(Pym 2015).
32.14.2 Personal Health Clouds
As mobile internet access expands, we can expect digital health tools to increasingly 
move into the cloud, allowing patients to store and manage their personal health data. 
(Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm that enables ubiquitous 
access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher‐level services that 
can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. 
Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of 
scale, similar to a public utility.) The vision of an electronic “health passport” that trav-
els with a patient over time (regardless of how fragmented health facilities may be on 
the ground) would empower patients, streamline diagnosis and treatment and enable 
better population health tracking.

32.14 Emerging Trends and Future Vision 579
32.14.3 Social Care Models
Platforms such as Omada and WealLife (both San Francisco‐based) have recognized 
that strong social networks, between similar patients or even within a patient’s own 
circle of family and friends, can assist in managing chronic disease. This principle is 
already in action organically in communities across the LMICs. However, technology 
can support this process by explicitly forming patients into “care teams,” potentially 
built around different stages of chronic disease management.
32.14.4 Home‐based Care
In the words of the UK’s National Health Service director Sir Bruce Keogh, “the hospital 
of the future is in the home.” Digital health will likely be an enabler of home‐based care, 
providing tailored advice to patients and their carers, and allowing remote health 
workers to manage dozens of cases remotely.
32.14.5 Crowdsourced Medical Advice
The applications shown in Figure 32.1 summarize the mission to democratize medical 
knowledge by allowing physicians to upload clinical photographs and discuss cases with 
a network of specialists from around the globe. This technology is being used by 
Médecins Sans Frontières and a number of other healthcare NGOs to crowdsource 
medical advice. Given the impending workforce shortages and maldistribution of spe-
cialist talent between rural and urban areas, we anticipate that crowdsourcing for clini-
cal education and decision support will be a growing trend. (Crowdsourcing is a 
sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods and services, includ-
ing ideas and finances, from a large, relatively open and often rapidly‐evolving group of 
Internet users. It divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result.)
32.14.6 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI can assist with diagnosis, management, and population health predictions. One 
startup in Nigeria has applied AI to analyze the acoustic patterns of the cry of newborn 
babies in order to screen for neonatal asphyxia (freelanceqz 2017). Another project is 
using automated image analysis to screen for otitis media in tympanic membrane pho-
tographs with a view to deploying low‐cost otoscopes and automating the diagnostic 
step (Myburgh et al 2016). The Artificial Intelligence and Medical Epidemiology (AIME) 
platform in Malaysia aims to predict disease outbreaks by aggregating public health 
and  climate data, with promising results already demonstrated in tracking dengue 
epidemics.
32.14.7 Blockchain Technologies
A flurry of organizations are currently trying to adapt blockchain technology to store 
and manage health data securely. (Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, 
called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.) The advantages of 
this decentralized digital ledger includes an auditable ground‐truth for important 
health data, identity management with custom access levels and smart contracts.

32 Digital Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries580
Blockchain‐based solutions have helped to decrease corruption and improve trans-
parency in the LMICs, such as in managing property rights in Ghana, and there are 
likely some transferable lessons for health systems, especially in settings where unau-
thorized practitioners or corrupt payment systems reduce access for the most 
vulnerable.
32.15  Conclusions
Digital health has a bright future in helping to improve access, quality, and cost for 
health systems around the globe. The benefits will arguably be felt most strongly in the 
LMICs, in the face of severe workforce shortages and the rising burden of chronic dis-
ease. The digital health ecosystem faces challenges such as a shortage of clinical evi-
dence, technical limitations, a lack of sustainable financial models, and interfacing 
barriers with the broader health system. A number of upstream factors can accelerate 
the maturity of digital health in the LMICs: a supportive policy environment, more flex-
ible funding (from governments, aid organizations and industry), and better educa-
tional resources for digital health innovators. Bidirectional knowledge and talent 
transfer between low‐ and high‐resource settings is particularly valuable. The future 
will likely see a combination of tried‐and‐tested technologies such as SMS better 
embedded into care pathways, as well as some of the emerging technologies such 
as artificial intelligence powering new solutions altogether. We have already seen the 
“M‐PESA” revolution for mobile banking – the next chapter will be the digital health 
revolution where these technologies blend into the fabric of healthcare and society.
