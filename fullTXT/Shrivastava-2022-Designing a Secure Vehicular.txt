Abstract Smart vehicles are interconnected and deliver a variety of sophisticated
services to their owners, transit authorities, automobile manufacturers, and other
service providers. Smart cars could be exposed to a number of security and privacy
risks, including GPS tracking and remote vehicle hijacking. Blockchain is a game-
changing technology that can be used for everything from cryptocurrencies to smart
contracts. It may be a viable solution for implementing security in vehicular IoTs.
We present a blockchain-based methodology to preserve users’ privacy while simul-
taneously boosting vehicle security in this paper. The proposed model upgrades the
services of vehicular IoT.

1 Introduction
Automobiles and roadside equipment form self-organizing wireless networks called
vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) (RSUs). The use of real-time dynamic commu-
nication between vehicles and RSUs provides for efficient and long-lasting data
transmission. As a result of the broad deployment of VANETs, intelligent trans-
portation systems (ITSs) are now feasible [1, 2]. A varied collection of VANET-
based applications, which can be classified as safety or commercial, increases not
only driving safety but also driving enjoyment. Safety-related applications include
emergency vehicle warnings, traffic management reports, road accident notification,
and speed monitoring [3, 4]. Commercially focused applications that provide conve-
nience and entertainment includeweather forecasting, broadcasting information from
neighboring gas stations and restaurants, navigation, and Internet connectivity.
We present a secure certificateless authentication solution for vehicle ad hoc
networks in this paper. Centralized and decentralized networks in the IoT are well
described in Fig. 1, and blockchain is well described in Fig. 2.

2 Literature Review
Security in vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) using blockchain for VANETs has
received a lot of attention in recent years. User privacy should be protected, and keys
should be updated. For location-based services,
Lu et al. [5] presented a dynamic key management approach (LBSs). The LBS is
a non-profit organization dedicated in helping. Each session is broken down into a
number of time slots, each with its own set of activities. Following that a vehicular
data authentication mechanism [6] is given, including probabilistic verification. For
malicious behavior detection, an approach is used. In addition, in order to avoid delays
in computing, checking the certificate revocation list (CRL), and group signatures.
The authentication code is a hashed message authentication code (HMAC).
Chuang andLee et al. [7] developed a decentralized authentication security system
(TEAM) for V2V communication. It is essential to notice that the findings are
improved by using the transitive trust relationship frame. Smart cars could be exposed
to a number of security and privacy risks, including GPS tracking and remote vehicle
hijacking.
Shen et al. [8, 9] proposed schemes have been created that emphasize privacy
preservation and lightweight. VANET verification. public-key cryptography that
is based on identity, in particular. For safe certificates, (ID-PKC) [10] has been
frequently used. Obtaining proof of efficiency, several authentication methods have
recently been introduced.
Zhang et al. [11] proposed VANET management is a term used to describe the
process of putting together a virtual Zhang et al. [11] provided an initial hypothesis.
Smart vehicles are interconnected and deliver a variety of sophisticated services
to their owners, transit authorities, automobile manufacturers, and other service
providers. Smart cars could be exposed to a number of security and privacy risks,
including GPS tracking and remote vehicle hijacking.
Jung et al. [12] devised a universal re-encryption strategy based on identity.
For V2R communications, the batch signature verification scheme. This technique,
however, is susceptible to replication [13]. Formal paraphrase An attack Meanwhile,
the VANET authentication framework was created as a result of this. [14] offers a
new preservation and repudiation model (ACPN). Self-created PKC-based pseudo
IDs were designed with this in mind are put into action.
He et al. [15] then devised a successful strategy. The CPPA technique for VANETs
is based on identity. It is worth mentioning that bilinear is a term used to describe. As
a result of the lack of pairing processes, the results are fairly small. Calculations are
cheap. Two more CPPA plans are similar. For VANETs, [1] and [16] were created.

3 Research Gaps
On the basis of the literature survey, we found following research gaps:
• Proximity: Because vehicles are mobile and perhaps fast-moving nodes in a
network, they would need to change parent nodes frequently. Connections to
adjacent peer nodes will be more reliable than connections to distant parent nodes
like a cellular tower. A DSRC protocol satisfies the physical range criteria, as
indicated in the preceding section [17, 18].
• Latency: In vehicles, low latency is crucial given their potential speed. Latency
between any two peers will be reduced if nodes interact with one other (or even
via each other) using DSRC [3, 19].
• Decentralization: When connections are dispersed across different pathways,
network traffic bottlenecks are reduced.
• Fault tolerance: A network with more connections between nodes is better able
to withstand disturbances. This is one of the main advantages of the peer-to-peer
(P2P) approach. Because they are not connected to the grid, vehicle peers will be
unaffected by power or wired network disruptions [15, 16].
On basis of the identified research gaps, we are using blockchain to create a secure
asymmetric cryptographic system. This is commonly used to secure sensitive data
and enables public-key encryption. It is especially beneficial when delivering data
across an insecure network like the Internet.
4 Background and Preliminaries
This section describes preliminaries of our work as follows.
4.1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Let Fp be a finite field of order p and p > 3 be a prime number. 4a3 + 27b2 + 6 = 0
must be satisfied by Fp. An elliptic curve Ep (a, b) over a finite field Fp is described
by the equation:
y2 = x3 + ax + b
Key Generation: Select a no. ‘d’ within range ‘n’
Q = d ∗ P
Designing a Secure Vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) Using Blockchain 673
where d = within range (1 to n − 1).
Q = public key, d = private key.
Encryption:
The agreement on a common integer (the key) lies at the heart of all encryption. The
agreed number is then used to encrypt a message by shifting the characters.
s1 and s2 two ciphertext will be generated.
s1 = k ∗ P (1)
s2 = M + k ∗ Q (2)
Decryption:
The agreement on a common integer (the key) lies at the heart of all encryption.
The agreed number is then used to encrypt a message by shifting the characters and
then to return to the receiving end to decrypt it. The ECC is a way for securing the
agreement of a key.
M = s2 − d ∗ s1 (3)
4.2 Hash Function
If a one-way hash function fits the following criteria, it is deemed secure [20]. (1)
Given any length message x, it is simple (x) to compute a message digest with a
fixed length output h. (2) Calculating x = h1 given y is tricky (y). (3) Given x, it is
computationally impossible to compute× 0= x such that h(×0)= h(x).The Chinese
remainder theorem (CRT) assume that k1, …, kn are positive integer pairs that are
approximately prime. The system of congruence [21] exists for any given set of
numbers a1, …, an. There is only one solution to the modulo g = Qn i = 1 ki, × ai
mod kii [1–n]. The solution is C = Xn i = 1 iii mod ki, where I = g ki and I I = 1
mod ki. The speed of the time sequences can vary. The DTW method is frequently
used to calculate the distance or similarity between time series automatically.
4.3 Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
The approach of dynamic time warping (DTW) [22] is effective for obtaining the
best alignment between two time-dependent sequences (time series). It is important
to keep in mind that the length and collected and forwarded to TA for analysis.
674 A. L. Shrivastava and R. K. Dwivedi
TA also stores the sensitive keys assigned to RSUs and vehicles. TA is believed
to have sufficient storage and processing capabilities in this situation. Furthermore,
because TA is the only valid verifier for the whole VANET, all participating autos
must first be confirmed. The fast growth of cloud computing, in particular, makes it
easier to connect traditional VANETs to cloud servers. As a result, vital information
and sensitive user data can be stored on various cloud servers. Meanwhile, TA’s
calculation capabilities could be improved. In recent years, cloud-assisted VANET
research has attracted a lot of attention [23, 24].
5 System Model
The three main components of VANETs system are described in this section. The
design of the projected VANETs system is seen in Fig. 2.
5.1 Trusted Authority (TA)
The dependable authority is the VANETs system’s dependable command and control
center (TA). TA is in charge of verification vehicle registration, key management,
and other major activities. We believe TA is always truthful and trustworthy. As
seen in Fig. 1, TA provides a variety of programs to authorized cars, Internet access,
including weather forecasts, navigation and, meanwhile, vehicle data, such as traffic
congestion statistics.
5.2 Road-Side Unit (RSU)
The RSU is a one-of-a-kind facility that acts as the only connection between TA and
on-the-road vehicles. The RSU’s job is to communicate with approaching vehicles
via short-range communication technologies (DSRC). In real-world settings, RSUs
are stationed in remote places far from TA, with some of them in dangerous envi-
ronments. As a result, if these RSUs are not regularly maintained, they can easily
be compromised or deactivated, resulting in data leakage from the affected vehicles.
Malicious attackers may be able to obtain sensitive vehicle data by storing corrupted
RSUs. RSUs were designed as semi-trusted entities with limited access to vehicle
data to account for this. The TA will harvest and process the vehicle data and other
crucial information.

5.3 Vehicles
Vehicles are meant to collect data as well as receive VANET services. Each vehicle
has an on-board device (Board unit) that allows it to communicate with road-side
units as well as other vehicles. In our system concept, the vehicle plate number is
recognized as a unique identifying provided by TA, each of which is clearly linked
to a single driver. The driver’s fingerprint/certificate card is also utilized for further
protection, guaranteeing that the driver and the connected vehicle are linked each
time the driver starts his or her vehicle. For the sake of clarity, we regard the driver
and the vehicle as a single entity in this research. Security in vehicular IoT using
blockchain is shown in Fig. 3.
6 Methodology to Fill the Gap
The capacity of blockchain is to incorporate consensus procedures and peer-to-peer
computing. Blockchain has developed a decentralized and safe platform for sharing
information. Indeed, digital encryption technologies are integral to blockchain tech-
nology, propelling blockchain cryptography to the forefront. Blockchain can use
cryptographic technique such as RSA encryption algorithm.

6.1 Proposed Algorithm
RSA algorithm to produce public and private keys, the RSA algorithm is used the
steps of this algorithm are as below:
p and q are two huge prime numbers. Multiply these numbers to produce x = p × q,
where x is the modulus of encryption and decryption.
Select an integer e smaller than x such that a is close to (p−1) × (q−1). It means
that, except for 1, e and (p−1) × (q−1) have no common factor. Select “e” in such
a way that 1e (x), e is prime to (x), and gcd (e, d (x)) = 1.
If x = p × q, then e, x> is the public key. The public key e, x> is used to encrypt
a plaintext message y. The following formula is used to generate ciphertext C from
plain text: me mod n = C.
y must be less than x in this case. A message of a length more than x is handled
as a collection of messages, each of which is encrypted separately.
We use the following formula to compute the d in order to determine the private
key:
Demonstrate that (p−1) × (q−1) = 1 or (p−1) × (q−1) = 1.
De mod ( x ) = 1 de mod ( x ) = 1 de mod ( x ) = 1 de mod ( x ) d , x > is the
private key. The private key d , x > is used to decrypt a ciphertext message c . The
following formula is used to calculate plain text y from ciphertext c.
mod cd x = y.
6.2 Simulation Tool
Ethereum is a completely decentralized blockchain network. Due to the liveliness
and responsiveness of its community, as well as the abundance of its documentation,
the blockchain promises that goods will become completely autonomous and belong
to themselves. They will be able to utilize code: In exchange for money (a type of
code), the door will release its access (through code) for the duration of the specified
time.

7 Result
The proposed methodology outlined in the paper totally eliminates the inefficiency,
as well as the security and privacy of data created in traditional automotive IoT. The
suggested framework does a fantastic job of establishing a fully secure vehicular
IoT. When it comes to vehicle data study, the most important consideration is the
data’s trustworthiness or authenticity. When data are generated and stored using the
blockchain framework, we can always be sure that the data are genuine because it
was joined to the chain by various stakeholders rather than a single controlling body.
The change frommanual to remote monitoring and environment control is always
seen as a more guided and successful approach. A tip-to-tip monitoring was not
possible in the traditional method, and it may lead to many discrepancies. As a result,
a remote network capable of detecting all connected data and alerting vehicles in the
event of an irregularity could be considered one of the best alternatives.
8 Conclusion and Future Directions
Thepossibility of employing blockchain for autonomous vehicle networkswas exam-
ined in this article, and a blockchainmodelwas proposed. The decentralized approach
provides a number of advantages not present in traditional client–server architectures.
While not the ideal application for blockchain technology, examining prospective
applications is nevertheless beneficial. As more powerful ITS systems are built for
real-world application, a disruptive technology like blockchain will almost certainly
find its way into multiple components, even if it is not a core function.
The proposed architecture suits a broader range of applications for future research
direction such as improvement in proximity, latency, decentralization, and fault
tolerance.
