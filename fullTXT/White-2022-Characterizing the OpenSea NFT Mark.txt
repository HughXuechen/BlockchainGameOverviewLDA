ABSTRACT
Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital identifiers used to
represent ownership of various cryptoassets such as music, art-
work, collectibles, game assets and allow for an unalterable and
provable chain of creation and ownership. The market for NFTs
exploded in 2021, and much of the public is being exposed to this
new digital ownership medium for the first time. While uptake
of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of
blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely
misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides
a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater
depth. We analyzed sales data from OpenSea - the NFT marketplace
with the most extensive user base and sales volume. Our study
considered 5.25 million sales that occurred between January 1, 2019,
and December 31, 2021. We first lead by presenting an overview of
our data collection process and summarizing key statistics of the
data set. We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a
small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly,
we review the economic activity within the network to show how
these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and
Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and
sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network,
communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to
congregate in these structures. These findings shed light on areas
of the NFT marketplace that have been relatively unexamined and
provide a multi-level analysis of a multi-billion dollar market.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Ethereum Foundation describes an NFT as allowing us to to-
kenize any unique asset and have them secured by the Ethereum
blockchain. They can "replicate the properties of physical items
like scarcity, uniqueness, and proof of ownership" [16]. Interest in -
and ownership - of NFTs has grown immensely over the back half
of 2021 as individuals start to embrace the underlying blockchain
and cryptocurrency technologies used to deliver them. The largest
global Crypto exchange - Crypto.com - reports that "The global
crypto population has increased by +178% in 2021, rising from 106
million in January to 295 million in December" and that they "expect
the number of global crypto owners to reach 1 billion by the end of
2022" [10]. A substantial increase in the cryptocurrency adoption
rate has a pronounced flow-through effect, leading to a rise in the
number of buyers and sellers of NFTs.
The blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape is quite daunting
for the average person to understand in its current state. Cryp-
tocurrency has many concerns slowing down wide-scale adoption
- primarily energy usage, security, legality, and a general belief
that cryptocurrency is some scam. That being said, many feel that
numerous current-state processes can be improved upon by lever-
aging the power that blockchain provides. At present, NFTs are
predominantly centred around the ownership and distribution of
artwork. However, that is but a small fraction of its practical uses.
For example, blockchain and smart contracts have started to pop
up when dealing with real estate contracts [8], wills and estate
planning [39], movie releases [17], or even as a creative way to do
crowd funding as is the case with Crypto Baristas [3].
To date, research into the NFT marketplace has been relatively
limited. As it is an emerging platform with many unique elements,
much of the prior research has been focused on more minor yet
critical aspects of the market [20, 42]. Most commonly, there have
been papers that seek to look at trends specific to a single collection
[19] or to link NFT pricing to crypto pricing in general [1, 13]. How-
ever, we have found that efforts to examine more comprehensive,
longitudinal market views are less prevalent. There is a lack of
resources to understand how NFT sales have evolved over the last
few years. Our work seeks to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end
view of key statistics of NFT sales and shed some light on how this
growing market is developing.
Even though the cryptocurrency user base increased to 300 mil-
lion people by the end of 2021, the average person has limited
knowledge of how cryptocurrency or the blockchain work. Gov-
ernments worldwide have been embracing it, as in El Salvador [36]
- or have been calling for an outright ban, as is the case in Russia
at the moment [14]. Going even farther still, China has publicly
announced a ban on cryptocurrency eight times since 2014 [43].

more scrutiny as many are deriding them as being Ponzi schemes
or scams.
Our goal is to take a broad approach to analyze NFTs and offer a
more generalist approach to understanding the evolution and trends
of the market. We performed a longitudinal measurement study
of today’s largest NFT marketplace - OpenSea [32]. They provide
a good representation of the NFT market due to their dominance
in sales volumes and the number of traders who frequent their
marketplace. OpenSea has recorded $20.37 billion in sales and has
over 1.2 million active traders in its network [11]. The following
closest network is 950,000 traders but has a volume of just $360
million. We seek to understand user behaviour, economic trends,
and network interactions. From this we expect to be able to better
understand the market in general, possible future trends, and spur
further research into this area.
Data was collected using a combination of the OpenSea API,
web scraping, and manual classification to build our final data
set. We found that sales trends show a shift from what used to be
mainly gaming-relatedNFTs to becoming heavily focused on art and
collectibles. Additionally, the Music category, while new, showed
great promise for growth based on strong album release sales for
well-established artists. We also found that the NFT network was
one of the extremes and was dominated by the top 1% of buyers
and sellers, and the majority of sales went to a few select subsets of
collections. While we found that there were numerous addresses
of buyers who owned just one or two NFTs, we discovered that
the buyer-seller network was composed of several rather large
communities, which show that buyers tend to stick to a particular
category of NFT or that they generally only buy from a small
number of different collections.
Our paper makes the following contributions:
• We perform a longitudinal measurement study of the largest
NFT marketplace today.
• We present a multi-level analysis and characterization of the
NFT marketplace highlighting its salient characteristics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an
overview of the market and defines key terms. Section 3 discusses
prior work. Section 4 presents our measurement methodology and
dataset overview. Section 5 presents our characterization results of
the NFT marketplace relating to user behaviour, economic activity,
and network properties. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
While complex under the surface, the NFT marketplace flow can
be outlined briefly, as shown in Figure 1. Key processes in the NFT
market system are outlined below.
(1) A digital asset is created and its meta-data is held within a
smart contract. This is a program that runs on the blockchain
and is a grouping of code and state data. These contracts
interact with users and "can define rules, as a regular contract,
and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts
cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are
irreversible" [28]. This allows Ethereum transactions to do
much more than simply storing or sending value.
(2) The asset is then ‘minted’ on a blockchain. For our pur-
poses this is the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, however other
Digital asset is 
created.
A new block on the Ethereum blockchain is created 
and information about the NFT / transaction is 
recorded on that block.

options do exist. Minting is the term used to describe the
process by which a new block is created, validated by the net-
work and ultimately confirmed and added to the blockchain.
Each asset has a unique identifier which allows NFT creators
to establish a level of scarcity for their assets. Smart con-
tracts also associate a unique Ethereum wallet address of the
owner with the NFT.
(3) Once on the blockchain, the NFT can be listed on a com-
patible Decentralized app (Dapp) such as OpenSea for other
users to bid on and purchase.
(4) A sale triggers the process in step 2 to repeat; a new block is
created, broadcast, validated, and NFT ownership moves to
a new wallet address.
3 RELATEDWORK
Existing research on NFTs tends to focus more specifically on the
protocols and technology used to support, build, or distribute NFTs
themselves. Much of this is centred on two specific issues that have
been front of mind, especially as adoption rates climb.
One such area of focus is the environmental impact [26] of NFTs;
looking at the greenhouse gas contribution of an Ethereum transac-
tion in its current and proposed future state and how those utilizing
the blockchain can best reduce their net effect on the environment.
The other major area of focus is on anonymity, malicious trading,
and security. As blockchain addresses are anonymous, it opens
the door to unethical trading practices such as "wash trading, shill
bidding, and bid shielding" [12]. Understanding the potential flaws
in the system is critical for future development to ensure a healthy
system. One area yet to be explored in depth is the prospect of
price-boosting, where a creator drives up the price through artifi-
cial demand by selling through a chain of their wallet addresses.
This has been topical as the speculative pricing aspect of collectible
NFTs creates an opportunity for unethical trades.
Existing papers that seek to provide research on market trends in
general more often tend to focus on a small subset of collections or
particular sales categories[19, 35] rather than the market as a whole.
Given the breadth of collections available to buyers in the current
climate, we cannot use the sales trends from a famous collection as
489
Characterizing the OpenSea NFT Marketplace WWW ’22 Companion, April 25–29, 2022, Virtual Event, Lyon, France
a basis of results for all collections. Sought after collections such as
Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club [27] are not representative
of the market in general.
Furthermore, other empirical papers look to explain price varia-
tion spikes [29], or look to establish a linked relationship between
the market value of Bitcoin/Ethereum and the price at which cre-
ators are listing their NFTs. On the other side of the equation, there
has been work that look to NFT creators themselves to understand
the human element of the ecosystem [37].
Our focus is to produce an empirical study across a wide range
of collections and categories to better understand market trends
in general. We seek to understand the power-law behaviour [24]
among buyers and sellers and how a small group dominates the
market. This is evident once you look at the volume of buyers and
sellers represented by just a hand full of communities. Additionally,
we examine the long-term pricing trends in themain NFT categories
and how the typical NFT has adjusted its price position in recent
years. With this, we can gain insights into the quickly evolving
NFT landscape and anticipate areas of growth or decline.
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Data Collection
We opted to collect sales data from OpenSea, the largest active NFT
marketplace. Statistics show that OpenSea has accumulated over
$20 billion in trade volume, boasting more than 1.2 million traders
[11].
The data set was built using the provided OpenSea API, where
we made our queries against the Events endpoint. To make the data
collection and validation process more manageable on both us and
the platform, we split our queries into smaller segments and used a
moving window of Unix timestamps to pull data on all successful
OpenSea sales between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021.
This amounted to a total of 5,252,252 sales records over the three
years.
One limitation of the API was that there was no classification
of the category of NFT that the sale belonged to. There was no
indicator if the NFT fell into Art, Collectible, Music, Trading Card,
etc. To label the sales, we web scraped a large number of categories
to collection name connections directly from OpenSea’s browse
pages. This gave us just over 50,000 collection names and their
corresponding category on OpenSea. We also performed a manual
inspection for the following 1,000 largest collections where web
scraping did not provide the data. This involved browsing several
assets from each collection on OpenSea’s website to make a de-
termination ourselves as to which category of NFT they fall into.
For any collections remaining - as well as those with no provided
collection name from the API - they were labelled as Uncategorized.
In total, we had ten different categories of NFTs tagged as shown
in Table 1.
It is worth noting that Music and Photography did not have sales
data in the early years. Data for these categories started to appear
late in 2020 only, so gaps in 2019 and 2020 are simply from the
recent introduction of these categories.
Additionally, there is considerable overlap between the Art and
Collectible categories, and these two categories are nearly inter-
changeable. For example, OpenSea lists CryptoPunks as Art, whereas
NonFungible Corporation considers them as Collectibles. Our find-
ings for Art and Collectibles were similar, so this categorical vari-
ance is not a significant concern.
The OpenSea API captures the USD price for Ethereum at the
time of sale. As such, all prices mentioned in this paper represent
the exchange rate at the time of sale.
Some confines that we had on our work are well worth men-
tioning. Data was gathered directly from the OpenSea API, which,
while functional, lacked the detail that could enhance the study. No
in-built categorization meant that this had to be done in a hybrid
manner with web scraping and manual review, but that opened
the process to arbitrary labels or misclassification. All NFTs were
on the Ethereum blockchain, and at the time of writing, several
additional established blockchains were offering NFTs that are suit-
able candidates for inclusion into studies. Namely, Solana [38],
Tezos [31], and even Bitcoin [40] have embraced NFTs. As more
blockchains support smart contracts, their transactions would need
to be included.
4.2 Data Overview
Table 1 outlines the breakdown of sales by category and year. Sales
volume had a marked increase over two years - growing 41% from
2019 to 2020 and an incredible 3,857% from 2020 to 2021. There
were days in November 2021 which had more sales than the en-
tirety of 2019/2020. Aside from domains, every category exhibited
considerable year-over-year growth. Music and Photography had
modest showings for their first year on the OpeanSea platform.
Future analysis on sales trends from 2022 onward should examine
if these categories can keep pace with the rest of the market.
Incredibly, collectibles grew by over 10,000% from 2019 to 2021
as buyers started to pay attention to the hype surrounding NFTs
and likely took notice of the sale price of the most well-known
collections. Most sought-after collections such as Cryptopunks and
Bored Ape Yacht Club were selling for hundreds of thousands, if
not millions of dollars.
Virtual Worlds - which account for the gaming-based NFTs, were
the dominant category in 2019 but have been quickly overtaken
by other categories that had more speculative value. That being
said, there is an increasing number of top-tier game developers
who have announced plans for introducing NFTs into their games.
This news has not been met with much enthusiasm [5], but as
the concept matures, Virtual Worlds is likely poised to exhibit
considerable growth in the coming years. In recent years, "Free-
to-play" games with no base price but offer in-game purchases
have become immensely popular. Revenue comes from the sale of
digital game assets inside the game environment. Developers can
earn billions of dollars a year [41] and could make more by cutting
out various bank and processing fees by moving directly to the
blockchain.
However, speculative buyers were more often than not "starting
to show significant resale rates at a loss" as the year went on [9].
As we will soon see in more detail, NFT sales have normalized
somewhat heading into 2022. Ethereum hit its all-time high market
price on November 9, 2021, and began to experience a serious
decline in value around mid-December. This is also when we notice
NFT sales volume decrease dramatically.

Table 2 gives a split by year of the distinct counts of buyers,
sellers, and collections involved in those sales. The ratio of unique
buyers to sellers remained relatively consistent in 2019 and 2020
- 1.16 and 1.28 buyers per seller, respectively - however, in 2021,
we see that this has grown by nearly 55% to a 1.98 buyer to seller
ratio. Unique collections where at least one sale was made also
increased just over 44-fold between 2020 and 2021 to 50,870 distinct
collections.
As shown in Table 3, many sales categories featured rather ex-
treme ranges for prices. The standard deviation (SD) for sale price
by category shows how extreme prices can range. As a result, we
know that the median is a better measure of comparison. Domains
had a rather unusually high maximum sales price, which was for
an Ethereum Name Service domain - paradigm.eth.

5 CHARACTERIZATION RESULTS
5.1 User Behaviour
In this section, we will review the results of our analysis as they
relate to user behaviour. We will look into the trend of how many
typical transactions we would expect from buyers and sellers and
which category of NFT those purchases may fall into. We will show
how the distribution of frequency-rank for buyers, sellers, and
collections fits a stretched exponential distribution. Lastly, we will
look at how the market follows a Pareto 80-20 ratio.
The latest report released from the NonFungible Corporation
noted that "the number of sellers is growing faster than the number
of buyers, which may suggest that the conversion of ‘new entrants’
to become ‘NFT Traders’ is accelerating" [9]. However, we found
that within the OpenSea marketplace, this was not the case. The
growth of buyers is outpacing sellers by a rather large margin. From
2020 to 2021, there was an increase in unique buyers of 3,471%,
whereas for sellers, they saw an increase of 2,208%.
It is interesting to note that despite the significant increase in
NFT transactions in August 2021, the average number of purchases
by a typical NFT buyer declines from 2019 to 2021.
In 2019, the average buyer would purchase approximately 5.7
NFTs in any given month. In 2020, this dropped to 4.7 per month,
and finally, in 2021, it dips again to 4.2 per month. Much of this
could be attributed to the shift in the mix of categories of NFTs
which are being purchased each year.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of sales for each category by year.
In 2019 we saw that the bulk of sales belongs to the Virtual Words
category. However, by 2021 over 80% of all sales fall into the Art
and Collectibles category. This supports previous research which
noted that "the market volume has been largely dominated by NFTs
categorized as Art, which, since then, have contributed 71% of the
total transaction volume, followed by Collectible assets accounting
for 12%" [30]. Virtual World sales had a higher median sales value
of $743.27, while Art and Collectibles were $634.09 and $554.88.
Figures 2 and 6 illustrate how dramatically sales trends differ
between 2019-2020 and 2021. Interest in NFTs picked up in 2021.
As a result, we decided to look at the subset of January 1, 2021,
through December 31, 2021, as it was believed data more or less
starts to normalize and be a better representative of typical sales
trends.

Figure 4 shows a log-log plot of the rank versus frequency of buy-
ers, sellers, and collection counts. We analyzed the results against
several variations of a power-law fit. The results did not fit that
of a Zipf, Mandlebrot, or Lavalette distribution [25]; however, we
found that they all seemed to resemble a Laherrere distribution
more closely [23, 34] once we analyzed sales trends for 2021.
The distribution is defined as f (r ) = cexp(−( rn0
)b ) where f (r )
is the frequency function, r is the rank, c is a normalizing constant,
b is the shape parameter, and n0 is the scale parameter.
The parameters for our models are outlined in Table 4.
We found that the top 20% of buyers accounted for 79.7% of
transactions, whereas the top 20% of sellers accounted for 83.4%
of all transactions. However, when looking at the most popular
collections, the top 20% of collections accounted for an impressive
97.4% of all transactions. We find that our data follows many real
world graphs of the Internet or Social Media and are heavily right
skewed which "demonstrates the existence of (several) high degree
hubs" [7].
Of the top-100 collections sold over the three years, 88 were
either art or collectibles and amounted to 1,056,746 individuals
sales - or 20.2% of all sales analyzed. Virtual Worlds was next with
seven collections and 125,154 sales, followed by Utility (4, 51,649)
and Domain (1, 13,205).
Of note is that the fourth most popular NFT on OpenSea by
sales volume is an asset named ‘NFT Yourself’ from the ‘KINGS OF
LEON X YELLOWHEART’ collection, which is a limited edition
NFT release of a Kings of Leon album. It was listed at 0.35 ETH,
which was equivalent to $133.63 at the time. It had 5,790 sales and
accounted for nearly 38% of the entire Music category on OpenSea.
Sales figures indicate that Kings of Leon managed to bring in almost
$2 million in total sales across multiple marketplaces [22]. However,
that is nowhere near the record $11.6 million in sales generated by
DJ 3LAU with the auction of 33 NFTs [21]. Given that Music is a
relatively new category in the NFT world, these could be outliers;
however, it shows that there is at least an appetite for new digital
distribution methods for music and is a category to watch in the
future.
There has been a bandwagon effect where the NFT market has
been flooded with countless AI-generated art or collectibles collec-
tions. Given that the top 20% of collections account for 97.4% of all
transactions, this suggests that many buyers are instead sticking to
collections they know or are buying well recognized and backed
projects. This also supports the idea that the resale market is start-
ing to exhibit sales at a loss as many smaller collections would not
experience the same primary or secondary sales demand.
Despite massive transactional growth, the average number of NFT
purchases by an OpenSea user has decreased by 1.5 NFTs per month.
The top 20% of buyers and sellers account for 80% of all transactions
in the network, with the top 20% of collections making up 97.4% of
the sales. The market mix has shifted from a gaming focus into the
art and collectible scene as buyers seek to capitalize on the hype for
potential profit on the secondary sales market.
5.2 Economic Activity
What became abundantly clear in our analysis of the NFT market-
place was a system of extremes. There is a common term to describe
someone who spends far more than the typical platform user - a
heavy hitter [4]. This is no different in the NFT space, as a small
group dominates the scene.
Our data’s largest NFT heavy hitter is on record for 48,160 pur-
chases - spanning all categories. Interestingly enough, that same
account address is listed for zero sales, indicating a longer-term
investment strategy. This strategy appears to be rather common as
it was noted on another platform analysis that "only 15.72 percent
of the NFTs that have been successfully sold on their first auction
have been listed for a second auction" [15]. Buyers in the 25th, 50th,
and 75th quartiles held 1, 2, and 6 NFTs respectively. Those in the
top 1% of buyers held 108 NFTs or greater.
The most notable seller in the network appeared a more modest
9,577 times and made sales only against 2 Collectible collections.
Sellers in the 25th, 50th, and 75 quartile had sold 1, 3, or 10 NFTs.

Figure 6: Timeline of daily sales
Those in the top 1% of sellers had sales of more than 228 NFTs in
our three-year period. Figure 5 shows the cumulative percent of
purchases made by each percentile of buyers and sellers. This indi-
cates that the distribution of purchases is skewed heavily towards
the upper percentile for both buyers and sellers.
Sales had several distinct periods of sales increase, as is shown
in Figure 6. First, a small spike occurred in March 2021, peaking at
7,893 daily sales. The main and global peak was on Oct 4, 2021, with
67,681 sales. Following a dip, there was a slight resurgence through
to Dec 14, 2021, with 27,529 sales before the market dropped off and
started to average just over 1,000 sales/day from Dec 18 onwards.
Data collection ended on December 31, 2021, so it is unknown if
this reduced sales capacity continued or to what extent.
When looking at the value of the NFT assets themselves, we
found an extremely long tail of values. In our records, the highest
value NFT sold for a whopping 2,100 ETH, worth $8,030,862 at the
time of sale. The least expensive sale on record was $0.51. Again, if
we look at the distribution of prices, we find that the 25th quartile
for the cost was $206.25, 50th was $527.85, 75th was $1368.70, and
those NFTs which were in the top 1% by sales value were worth
upwards of $25,958.11.
Given these extremes, we opted to look at a representation of
sales value by year with the outliers removed for clarity. We found
that the mean sales price for all three years was reasonably close.
ThemeanNFT sale price for 2019/2020/2021was $1421/$1456/$1476,

5th/95th Quantile
Figure 8: Count of the log-price of NFTs over three years
respectively. The median value is markedly higher in 2021, as evi-
denced by Figure 7, which is expected given the rise in overall sales
quantity and general popularity of NFTs for that year [33].
When we started to account for the category of the NFT, we
found that the Music and Domain categories tended to have the
lowest median value. In contrast, Art, Collectibles, Photography,
and Virtual Worlds tended to have the higher median values and
the highest extreme values.
With a year-agnostic view, we can see the distribution of sales
values as per Figure 8. Ninety-five percent of all sales values fall
between $37.79 and $7,501.58, noted by the red bars.
Figure 9 of time series plots of mean pricing by each category
revealed interesting trends. Most notably, there was a positive trend
in the price over time for Art and Collectibles. The Art category
features frequent spikes, coinciding with drops of specific NFT
collections that buyers thought were valuable. Buyers of specific
collections often get advance notice and priority purchase posi-
tioning if the same creators release a new collection. This, in turn,
creates a sudden surge of primary sales to get one of the limited
NFTs released. This then drives a secondary sales market where
opportunistic buyers hope to flip for a quick profit.
We see this same level of pricing volatility across several other
categories - most prominently with Domains, Trading Cards, Util-
ity, and Virtual Worlds. Sports typically did not experience much
volatility in its pricing, we suspect as it is a relatively small and
seemingly undeveloped category. Music had a marked decrease in

mean price, but given that nearly 40% of all sales were from a single
album sale, it would have an unduly large effect versus the rest of
the category.
We attempted to fit letter-value plots [18] to our data to illustrate
quantile data better, but with the volume of data points - and the
extreme range of values - we found that even this method was
unsuitable.
The NFT marketplace is dominated by heavy hitters who spend far
more than the typical user. The top 1% of buyers owned more than 108
NFTs, while the top 1% of sellers made at least 228 sales. Those NFTs
in the top 1% by sales value were worth upwards of approximately
$26,000. However, 95% of all sales fell between $37.79 and $7,501.58.
Art and collectibles show a positive trend in their pricing over time
and are susceptible to volatile price spikes.
5.3 Network
It was of interest to examine just how buyers and sellers are linked.
Given that we have established a top-heavy distribution for the top
buyers and sellers, how does that translate into a network-based
view? A graph was created where each node represented a buyer
or a seller, and an edge connected the nodes if any transaction
was done between the two. The network graph was comprised of
637,931 nodes, where each node represents a unique buyer or seller
Ethereum wallet address.
The graphwas then analyzed using the Louvain algorithm,which
extracts community-based structures from networks. This returns
a measure known as modularity, a value between -1 and 1 repre-
senting the density of links inside communities compared to those
between communities [6]. The Louvain algorithm is defined as:
Q = 1
2m
∑
i j [Ai j −
kikj
2m ]δ (ci , c j ), where Ai j is the weight of the
edge between i and j, ki =
∑
j Ai j is the sum of the weights of
edges between vertex i , ci is the community to which vertex i is
assigned, δ is 1 if u = v and 0 otherwise, andm = 1
2
∑
i j Ai j [6].
Once run, we had Q = 0.282, which suggests a middling level of
density of connections, but that is not entirely unexpected given
the sheer volume of transactions and the number of buyers who
own just a small number of NFTs. Contrast this to looking at the
Figure 10: Network graph of buyer and seller connections.
modularity of the music network, which was Q = 0.915. As we
had noted, essentially a single seller dominated the music category,
then this is evidence of just how strongly connected the music
community is in its current state.
Figure 10 shows a sample of the buyer and seller network that
was analyzed. Each edge represents a transaction between buyers
and sellers, which are the nodes. The colour of the edge repre-
sents the category to which the NFT belonged to. The purple edge
colouring are NFTs from the Collectibles category, which account
for 62.21% of all edge connections. The blue are Virtual Worlds -
5.49%, and green represent Art which make up 24.03% of all edges.
A heavy volume of nodes still persist centrally in the graph which
speak to the sheer number of smaller, localized transactions that
occur between less frequent buyers or sellers.
Furthermore, we found that our complete network graph con-
sisted of 6,959 communities but that the top-10 communities ac-
counted for 86.7% of all buyers or sellers. The largest community
in the network was composed of 164,586 nodes (25.8%), and the
majority of sales fell within the Art or Collectible categories. A New
York Times article noted that the network maps show "that the mar-
ket for NFT-based art is extremely insular and tightly connected,
even by the standards of the art world, especially among owners
who buy and sell several times. These network features may help
explain the enormous spikes in sales prices for NFT-based art" [2].
Regarding the most frequent degrees, we found that nodes of
degrees 1 through 5 comprised 69.9% of all nodes, and the average
degree was 13.1. The node with the most significant degree in the
network had 26,640 edges.
494
WWW ’22 Companion, April 25–29, 2022, Virtual Event, Lyon, France White et al.
Table 5: Degree and count of nodes
Degree % #
1 38.21% 243,753
2 14.59% 93,074
3 7.92% 50,524
4 5.28% 33,682
5 3.89% 24,815
The next logical step is to review interaction at a within-category
type view. Looking at all NFT sales gives us insight into general
market interaction, but from the previous analysis, we know that
buyers tend to gravitate towards just one or two categories. Some
may have obvious overlaps, such as the case with Trading Cards
and Sports, so the connection between those categories should be
explored. Similarly, future analysis on Virtual Worlds itself could
prove insightful as the gaming industry continues to evolve and
in-game purchases become the norm.
The network of buyers and sellers is primarily comprised of a
community structure as evidenced by ten communities accounting for
86.7% of buyers and sellers. A modularity value of 0.282 speaks to the
sparsity outside of these communities. Nearly 70% of user nodes had
between 1 and 5 degrees which speak to the level of interactivity of
the average user.
6 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
OpenSea - and NFT sales in general - have experienced tremendous
sales growth from 2019 to 2021. Despite this, the NFT sales market
is still in its infancy and has much more room to grow and mature.
The global adoption of cryptocurrency will bring in a new wave
of NFT enthusiasts, which - along with maturity in blockchain
technologies - will further drive market growth.
In this paper, we analyzed 5.25 million sales records over a three-
year period which involved ten different categories of NFTs. With
this, we looked at user behaviour and how a small subset of buyers,
sellers, and collections were driving an overwhelmingly high pro-
portion of the transactions. We also looked at how the sales mix
of NFTs based on the category they belong to has evolved quite
considerably in just a few years. We analyzed purchase and price
history over time, noting the high levels of volatility in sales and
both the mean and median pricing of the NFTs themselves. Pricing
ranges from as low as $1 to several million dollars, demonstrating
how speculative NFTs can be for buyers. Lastly, we looked to net-
work analysis to show that the collective NFT market comprises
closely connected communities of buyers and sellers who tend to
operate within a specific category of NFT.
These results raise further questions, which would be invalu-
able areas for us - or others - to continue with in terms of future
work. How would a comprehensive review of market trends from
within a single category of NFT look, and would it be comparable
to the broader market trends? Do other trade networks aside from
OpenSea adhere to the same observed sets of behaviours? We feel
there are still substantial gaps in the literature regarding NFTs, so
we aimed to fill some gaps while stimulating future efforts.
Despite current public sentiment about NFTs, we feel that this
is just the beginning of a period of maturity for NFTs and that the
prospects for the ability to digitize assets are very strong. Future
work should analyze other networks and blockchains as they con-
tinue to develop. A more in-depth study of price mechanics would
be invaluable, isolating instances of the same NFT being sold in
sequence to analyze price patterns and detect fraudulent trades or
price boosting.
