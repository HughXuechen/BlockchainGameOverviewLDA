Abstract. With the development of the information age, the efficiency of information resource
sharing has not been fully released, and the willingness of participants to share information
needs to be improved. It is of great significance to promote the willingness of participants to
share information and increase the value of information utilization. Aiming at the problem of
low information sharing rate of participants, this paper constructs an evolutionary game model
between information sharing and non-sharing participants under the blockchain technology
platform and introduces the critical value corresponding to the initial proportion of participants
under the condition of a stable strategy as a trigger Conditions, dynamic adjustment of
incentive coefficients to maintain a stable strategy of information sharing, simulation with
MATLAB. Research shows that the use of blockchain smart contract technology to
dynamically adjust the evolutionary stability strategy is shown as: When the initial proportion
of participants is lower than the critical value, the incentive parameters are transformed into
shared incentive benefits to motivate the participants to actively participate in information
sharing; when it is higher than the critical value, the incentive parameters are transformed into
sharing costs and dynamically adjusted to reach the initial participants. The proportion is
maximized, which provides a strategy for participants to choose information-sharing strategies.
1. Introduction
In the era of rapid development of information technology, the value of the development and
utilization of information resources has attracted more and more people’s attention, and they have
realized the value of information resources. Information resource sharing has evolved into modern
information life where people obtain more and more information. The important use of the way [1]. In
2020, my country's "China Blockchain Financial Application and Development Research Report"
pointed out that blockchain technology is evolving and mature and has a certain degree of adaptation
to the real world. Although there are little researches on information sharing combined with
blockchain technology at present, the research found that the features of blockchain technology, such
as tamper-proof, decentralized, and distributed, provide information on the use-value, economic utility,
and methods of information. New choices and ideas have laid the cornerstone for the reconstruction of
the trust model in the era of big information [5]. Information sharing can increase the value of
information utilization and reduce the cost of information utilization. The development of modern
information technology and the establishment of new information exchange systems provide certain
technical support for information sharing. However, under the development of the modern information
economy system, the lack of economic benefits, asymmetry of information, high cost of information
flow, lack of information security, low transmission efficiency, and insufficient incentives have caused
the phenomenon of information "stay" [2].

As an analysis method of modern mathematics, the evolutionary game has been widely used in
economics, management, and other fields. Researches on information sharing based on evolutionary
game theory include: Wang et al. studied the problem that the disclosure of supply chain demand
information reduces the willingness of retailers to share information, and have built a predictive
information-sharing model[7-9]. Because of the problems of asymmetry in information sharing, the
high cost of information sharing, and lack of economic benefits, in one case, the information sharing
system will introduce a third party for supervision. Li et al. established a game mechanism of
information sharing among mineral resource enterprises under government supervision [11]. Wei et al.
established an evolutionary model of data sharing between enterprises with government participation,
the government supervised and encouraged them, and analyzed that the willingness of enterprises to
share will change due to data, mutual trust, and liquidated damages [12-13]. Lee et al. found that the
integrated digital twin and blockchain framework make all data transactions traceable, and realize the
sharing of accountable project-related information among stakeholders [15]. Kumar et al. discussed
how blockchain technology guarantees the security of data transmitted by the Internet of Things [16].
At present, there is not much research on the evolutionary game of information sharing based on
blockchain technology at home and abroad. Therefore, this paper constructs a game model of
information sharing under the blockchain smart contract mechanism, introduces the critical value
corresponding to the initial proportion of participants under the condition of a stable strategy as the
trigger condition, analyzed the evolution mechanism of the information sharing of the participants, and
conducts Numerical simulation analysis.
2. Basic model
2.1. Basic assumptions and parameters of the evolutionary game model
Participants with limited rationality under shared information are more willing to share data through a
platform with trust and security. Therefore, establishing an incentive mechanism in the blockchain
platform can realize the effective sharing of information.
Hypothesis 1: Participating subjects can choose to share or not share information based on the
benefits obtained in participating in information sharing, so the selection set of participating subjects is
{information sharing, information not sharing};
Hypothesis 2: For information sharing, the shared benefits obtained by the two parties in the game
can be divided into direct benefits and value-added benefits. Direct benefit means that both parties
obtain the information shared by the other party so that they can profit from it and record it as direct
benefit D. Synergy benefit is the benefit created by the mutual fusion of the participants when sharing
information, which is recorded as value-added benefit T.
Hypothesis 3: Shared cost C. In the information-sharing platform, information sharing requires
investment in fixed information sharing costs.
Hypothesis 4: Excitation coefficient R. Under the blockchain smart contract incentive mechanism,
the incentive coefficient is expressed as reward income or participation cost.
Hypothesis 5: During the game, the probability that participant A chooses to "share" is x (0<x<1),
on the contrary, the probability of choosing "not to share" is 1-x; the other party to the game, the
participant B chooses to "share" The probability is y (0<y<1), otherwise, the probability of choosing
"not sharing" is 1-y;
Hypothesis 6: When there is no sharing among participating users, the benefits obtained by both are
0.
According to the above assumptions, the income matrix of participating entities' information sharing
can be obtained, as shown in Table 1:
ICMSOA 2021

Sharing(x) D+T-C-R，D+T-C-R -C-R，D
Non-sharing
(1-x)
D，-C-R 0，0
The following is an analysis of the income matrix:
Situation 1: In the case where participants A and B do not share information, there is no benefit or
cost, that is, the benefit is zero.
Situation 2: Participants A and B share information, not only can obtain the benefits of mutual
information sharing, but also collaborate to promote mutual reference and integration of information,
and can create new value that is obtained Value-added benefits, enabling participants to obtain more
benefits. But information sharing requires a certain investment cost. In the blockchain platform, to
share information between users, an incentive mechanism can be created to promote both parties in the
game. The parameters in the incentive mechanism include positive promotion and negative promotion.
When the excitation parameter C is getting closer and closer to the threshold, the positive promotion
will eventually reach the saturation state of the gain. When the excitation parameter exceeds the
threshold, the negative promotion will cause a negative gain. Therefore, when mutual information is
shared, the benefits of the participants are all D+T-C-R.
Situation 3: In the blockchain information sharing platform where one party chooses to participate,
the other party chooses not to participate in information sharing. However, the choice of the sharing
party does not benefit from information sharing. On the contrary, the sharing party bears the
investment cost by itself. However, because the other party does not share the information, it cannot
make additional profits and must compensate for certain incentive costs. Usually in this case, after a
game with the other party, the sharing party with bounded rationality will adopt a non-sharing strategy
to lose -C-R. For the non-sharing party, the benefit derived from the lack of sharing only comes from
the direct benefit D shared by the game party.
In the strategy of encouraging information sharing in the blockchain platform, participants with
limited rationality do not share two behavioral strategies. It is difficult to make the best decision in one
decision, but the participants will pass long-term imitations, Learn, constantly adjust their strategy and
make dynamic adjustments cyclically, and finally reach a state of balance and stability.
2.2. Copy dynamic equations and equilibrium solutions
According to the income matrix and the game process shown in the table, a copy dynamic equation
can be obtained, which describes the dynamic evolution process of participant's information sharing,
and the analysis shows that the participant A chooses "sharing" or "not sharing" strategy performance
The expected return and the average expected return.
Participant A's shared strategy has the expected benefits:
�i1
1 = �(� + � − � − �) + (1 − �)( − � − �) = �� + yT − � − � (1)
The expected benefits of Participant A's non-sharing strategy are: ���
� = ��
The average expected return of participant A is:��
�� �� =xyT+yD-xD-xR
The expected benefits of Participant B's sharing strategy are:�j1
�=x(D+T-C-R)+(1-x)(-C-R)
Participant B does not share the expected benefits of the strategy: �j2
�=xD
The average expected return of participant B is:���
�� ��� =xyT-yC-yD-yR
Synthesize the dynamic equation of the information-sharing behavior of participants A and B in the
above structure:

Bring the five equilibrium points into the Jacobian and the value of its trace. When det J1 >0, tr J1<0,
the conditions of the evolutionary stability strategy are met, and the local stability of the participants'
information sharing can be obtained by bringing the points into the equation, such as Table 2 shows:
When the condition � > � + � > 0 is met, the stability analysis of the system is shown in Table

2.3. Evolutionary game analysis of participants
Participants A and B with bounded rationality, in the blockchain platform incentive model, assume
that the probability of selecting information sharing and non-sharing is symmetrical, and the dynamic
equation for copying is simplified as ��(�, �) = ��(�, �) = �(�)，�(�) = �(� −�)(�� − � −
�).Assumption �(�) = �，It can be seen from the balance point，When the condition �� = �、
�� = �、�� =
�+�
�
is met. According to the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) condition, it can be
known that the stability condition in the differential equation must be satisfied, must satisfy �'(�) <
0.
Case 1-1: If T>R>0 and T>C+R, it can be seen that and are both the ESS of the participant's
information sharing evolutionary game, not the ESS of the participant's information-sharing
evolutionary game. The proof is as follows:
�(�) = �(1 − �)(�� − � − �) (6)
�'(�) = (1 − 2�)(�� − � − �) + ��(1 − �) (7)
Analyze the three stable states in the equilibrium point respectively, when A and B are:
ICMSOA 2021

�'(0) =− (� + �) < 0 (8)
�'(1) =− (� − � − �) < 0 (9)
�'( �+�
�
) = (� + �)(1 − �+�
�
) > 0 (10)
From (8) and (9), the slope of the tangent line is less than zero. Therefore, both are the ESSs of the
evolutionary game of information sharing among participants. From (10), the slope of the tangent line
at ω3=
�+�
�
is greater than 0, so it is not the ESS of the evolutionary game of information sharing
between participants.
From this further analysis, the evolution path is shown in Figure 1. The broken line BEC in the
figure divides the area of the figure into two parts, the size of which depends on the specific position
of the saddle point E. When �+�
�
>ω>0, the initial state of the game between the two parties is below
the broken line BEC, then ESS tends to (0,0), that is, not participating in sharing is the only strategy to
finally achieve the equilibrium of the evolutionary game; when 1> ω>�+�
�
, the initial state of the game
between the two parties is above the broken line BEC, and the ESS tends to (1,1), that is, participation
in sharing can achieve evolutionary game equilibrium. This shows that �+�
�
is the critical value
between the strategic choice of sharing and non-sharing of information. If the initial participant’s
participation ratio is greater than the critical value, the rest of the participants will not participate in the
information sharing as the number of games evolves. Will participate in information sharing. On the
contrary, if the initial participant’s participation ratio is less than its critical value, the remaining
information sharers of the participants will eventually not participate in information sharing as the
number of games increases.
Figure 1 Figure 2
Case 1-2: If T>R>0 and, only is the ESS for the information sharing of the participants. The proof is
as follows:
�'(0) =− (� + �) < 0 (11)
�'(1) =− (� − � − �) ≥ 0 (12)
�'( �+�
�
) = (� + �)(1 − �+�
�
) ≤ 0 (13)
When verification ω3= (C+R)/T, since and T+R>T, andω3 >1, formula (13) does not hold. From
this further analysis, ω1 =0 is the only ESS under this condition, which means that regardless of the
initial proportion of information sharing or non-sharing occupied by participants, they will not
participate in information sharing after repeated games, as shown in Figure 2. In this case, the party
will choose not to share information, and analyze the reasons: the cost of investment is higher than the
benefits of information sharing, resulting in a decrease in the willingness of the participants to share
information. Starting from the bounded rationality of the participants’ pursuit of maximizing their
interests, they will eventually tend to choose the information non-sharing strategy (0,0), that is (no
sharing, no sharing).
Case 1-3: If R>0 and ESS is the only ESS under these conditions, similar to the second), it means
that due to the high cost of sharing information, the participants will eventually tend not to participate
ICMSOA 2021

in the selection strategy.
Case 1-4: If R<0 and, it can be obtained as the only ESS, the proof is as follows:
�'(0) =− (� + �) > 0 (14)
�'(1) =− (� − � − �) < 0 (15)
�'( �+�
�
) = (� + �)(1 − �+�
�
) ≤ 0 (16)
But since 0 < � < 1 and � + � ≤ 0, we know that ω3=
�+�
�
>1, therefore, (16) does not hold under
this condition. From (15), we can get that the slope of the tangent line at �2 =0 is less than 0.
Therefore, �2 =1 is the only ESS in the evolutionary game of information sharing among participants,
and other � values are not valid.
Further analysis of this, only to meet the conditions of the evolutionary game stable strategy, which
means that the R cost value has become a positive benefit. This cost value becomes the shared
incentive cost, which incentivizes the participants to share information, that is, generates reward
benefits. Under the evolutionary game, the final ESS evolves into an active information sharing
strategy for all participants, as shown in Figure 3. When the benefit of information sharing exceeds the
cost of input, the greater the negative effect of non-information sharing, the greater the positive benefit
of revenue. At this time, the participants will tend to the information-sharing strategy (1,1), that is,
(share, share).
Figure 3. Phase diagram of the evolution path of
information sharing
Therefore, there are two evolutionary stable strategies, namely participation and non-participation in
information sharing, and the decision-making conditions of the participants need to be analyzed in
detail according to the situation. To further understand that the information sharing of the participants
is potentially dependent on the ESS in the two participation and non-participation strategies, the
evolution trend of the corresponding conditions is further explained, which can clearly analyze the
intuitiveness of the selection trend of the participants.
The stable change trend of the evolutionary game under the information sharing incentive
mechanism in the blockchain platform is affected by the initial information sharing and the
non-sharing ratio of the participants and the incentive parameters. Based on the evolutionary game
theory, it is concluded that there are three evolutionary stable strategies and the incentive mechanism
is modeled and analyzed. This paper builds a blockchain smart contract incentive system platform to
promote the willingness of participants to share information and increase the long-term stability of
information utilization value. The development provides strategy.
3. Information sharing model based on the evolutionary game of blockchain smart contracts
By setting different values of C, R, D, and T, it is verified that the ESS in the evolutionary game of the
information sharing participants and the role of the incentive mechanism in the case of different
setting incentive coefficients. The experiment is divided into three scenarios: For scenario 1,we
analyzed the two evolution strategies of the participants in scenario 1-1 and analyzed in detail the
changing laws of their evolution images; scenario 2 targets the incentive system and conducts

scenarios 1-2 and 1-3 Categorization analysis, select the values of the parameters that meet the
conditions, and verify the influence of the incentive mechanism on the evolutionary game; Case 3 also
analyzes Cases 1-4.
Scenario 1: Based on the blockchain evolutionary game incentive mechanism, adjust the value of
key factors according to the situation. The parameters are as follows: sharing cost C=9, direct benefit
D=20, and value-added benefit T=15. Under the conditions of Case 1-1, the excitation coefficient R
satisfies 0<R<9. When R takes 2, 4, and 5, the critical values corresponding to � = �+�
�
are �� ≈
�. ��、�� ≈ 0.87、 and 0.953  respectively. The probability that the participant chooses to
participate in information sharing depends on the critical value of the initial participant. When the
initial proportion of participation is less than the critical value �, the system eventually tends not to
participate in the stabilization strategy. Conversely, when the initial proportion of participants is
greater than the critical value � , the system eventually tends to participate in a stable strategy. Use
Matlab to simulate the game evolution process of the two parties involved. When C=4, Figure 4(a) and
(b) describe the evolution results of � = 0.6 and � = 0.9 , respectively. Figure 4(a) shows that the
initial proportion of participants is less than the critical value, the final stabilization strategy of the
participating subjects tends to not participate in information sharing, and Figure 4(b) shows that the
initial proportion of participation is greater than the critical value, and the final stabilizing strategy is
that all participating subjects choose to participate in information sharing.

participate in information sharing. Evolutionary stability strategy refers to information sharing or
non-sharing.

Scenario 2: Based on the blockchain evolutionary game incentive mechanism, adjust the key factors
and conditions according to the situation. The parameters are as follows: sharing cost C=9, direct
benefit D=20, and value-added benefit T=15. Under the conditions of Case 1-2, when the incentive
coefficient R satisfies � > � > 0 and � ≤ � + �, regardless of the value of the incentive coefficient
R and the sharing cost C under the conditions, the final evolutionary stability strategy of the
participants in the information sharing is not to participate in the information Sharing, as shown in
Figure 5(b). In the same way, in the case of cases 1-3, the participants will eventually stabilize at the
place where they do not participate in information sharing, and the evolution is shown in Figure 6(a).
In the above two situations, the entities participating in information sharing will not share information
regardless of the initial proportion of participation in the final stabilization strategy.
Scenario 3: Based on the blockchain evolutionary game incentive mechanism, adjust the key factors
and conditions according to the situation. The parameters are as follows: direct income D=20,
value-added income T=15. Under the conditions of Case 1-4, when the incentive coefficient R satisfies
� < 0 and � + � ≤ 0 , regardless of the value of the incentive coefficient R and the sharing cost C
under the conditions and the initial proportion of participants, the final evolutionary stability strategy
is the participation information Sharing, as shown in Figure 6(b), even when the proportion of
participating users is � = 0.1 , the part that does not participate in the information subject will
eventually stably participate in the information-sharing place after many dynamic game adjustments.
Analyzing the situation, when the incentive coefficient R becomes a negative benefit, the participant
will be rewarded. The limited participating users on the platform will choose to participate in
information sharing to maximize their interests.

Figure 6. Evolution process of evolutionary game strategy
The design of the incentive mechanism of the blockchain smart contract will affect the choices of
the participants, and the selection strategy of the shared participants is affected by the incentive
coefficient and the initial state. Through the automatic generation and execution of contracts triggered
by external events, its distributed ledger technology can achieve information sharing, information
transparency and credibility and authenticity [4][6]. Use blockchain smart contract technology to
dynamically adjust the evolutionary stability strategy. When the initial proportion of information
sharing participants is lower than the critical value, refer to cases 1-4. Under this incentive mechanism,
incentives are given according to the proportion, that is, the incentive parameters are transformed into
Positive benefits are rewards to motivate participants to actively participate in information sharing.
According to the maximization of their benefits, non-participants with bounded rationality will tend to
participate in the information sharing strategy, thereby promoting the evolution of the
non-participating direction to participate in the information sharing trend. When the participant’s
participation ratio exceeds its corresponding threshold, referring to the incentive mechanism of
Scenario 1-1, information sharing participants still tend to share- information strategies. At this time,
there is no need for incentives, that is, the conversion of incentive coefficients into negative benefits is
ensuring Satisfy the shared stability strategy to dynamically increase the cost of participation to

maximize the proportion of initial participants. When the participation strategy in the blockchain smart
contract incentive system platform cannot be maintained, the incentive mechanism in Scenario 3-4 is
cycled, and so on, until the participating information-sharing party reaches the maximum participation
in the blockchain smart contract incentive system platform The ideal state.
4. Conclusions and prospects
This paper addresses the problems of low information sharing rate and insufficient incentives of
participants in information sharing, and constructs an evolutionary game model between information
sharing and non-sharing participants based on the blockchain smart contract incentive mechanism. Get
the following conclusions:
1) The selection strategy of the shared participant is affected by the incentive coefficient and the
proportion of the initial state of the participant;
2) Under the conditions of meeting the stable strategy of participating in information sharing, the
threshold corresponding to the initial proportion of participants is introduced as the trigger
condition, and the automatic generation and execution of the contract are triggered by the
blockchain smart contract technology to achieve a state of dynamic adjustment of the incentive
coefficient.
3) When � ∈ （�， �+�
�
） , the overall stabilization strategy for participating in information
sharing tends to be non-sharing of information. It encourages participants to share information,
and the incentive coefficient is transformed into shared incentive benefits under trigger
conditions to encourage participants to actively participate in information sharing; When
� ∈ （

�
，�） , The overall stability strategy of participating in information sharing tends to
share information. To maximize the proportion of initial participants, the incentive parameters are
transformed into sharing costs, that is, to dynamically adjust the cost while ensuring that the
sharing stability strategy is met to maximize the proportion of initial participants.
Therefore, different from the traditional information sharing method, this paper uses the information
sharing in the blockchain platform to adjust the parameters of the incentive coefficient according to
the conditions under the incentive mechanism of the blockchain smart contract, so that the information
sharing participants can achieve Based on the state of maximum participation in the evolutionary game
mechanism, it promotes more participants to tend to information-sharing strategies and gain benefits,
maximize the interests of the entire participants, and help increase the information sharing rate of
participants and encourage more participants to conduct information Sharing long-term and stable
development.
