Abstract—This paper discusses an uncertain loaning decision 
problem for electric vehicles in the blockchain Internet of 
energy. Blockchain guarantees the security and privacy of 
transactions. In view of the uncertainty of electricity price, the 
scenario method is introduced. A new Stackelberg game model 
between multi plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and a loan bank 
is established. For each player, through the optimal solution of 
the loaning decision problem, the decision of each electric 
vehicle and the bank is obtained. Differing from the 
deterministic decision problem, a robust decision problem is 
proposed for the uncertainty of electricity price. In particular, 
in the loaning decision for each plug-in hybrid vehicle, a two 
scenario subset robust optimization method is used. A 
relaxation algorithm is proposed to solve the robust decision 
problem. The equilibrium of robust Stackelberg game model is 
achieved at the optimal loaning amount of all electric vehicles 
and the optimal loaning rate of the bank. Finally, an 
experiment was conducted to test the established game model 
in three different instances. The effectiveness and advantages 
of the established game model were verified by the 
computational results.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Conventional energy management is traditionally 
centralized. However, under the effect of decentralized 
management, our power grid can realize "global village", 
that is, become an energy sharing network [1]. This great 
transformation was first attributed to the concept of Internet 
of energy (IoE), which came into being during the third 
industrial revolution. In recent years, one belt, one road, has 
been attracting more and more attention from IoE. IoE 
provides an innovative concept for power distribution, 
energy storage, power grid monitoring and communication 
in the future green cities [2]. With the increasing number of 
nodes and performance requirements of IOE, how to meet 
the growing energy demand is a huge challenge. In order to 
solve this problem, IOE nodes can exchange residual energy 
with other nodes through P2P energy transactions, such as 
energy transactions in electric vehicles. As a distributed 
energy storage device, electric vehicle is one of the important 
components of IOE. With the increasing number of electric 
vehicles, large-scale electric vehicles connected to the smart 
grid will not only have a profound impact on the grid 
architecture, but also bring new challenges to the safe and 
stable operation of the power system [3]. 
Some nodes may not be willing to participate in the 
transaction as energy providers due to privacy concerns [4]. 
In this case, the energy supply and demand between nodes 
are unbalanced. In addition, the traditional centralized energy 
transaction based on trusted third party also has problems 
such as single point failure and privacy disclosure [5]. 
Therefore, it is very important to solve the security and 
privacy problems in energy trading.In recent years, a 
blockchain technology with the advantages of 
decentralization, security and trust has been introduced into 
power trading. Blockchain is a P2P distributed ledger 
technology, which can execute power transactions in a 
decentralized, transparent and secure market environment. 
Literature [6] analyzes the infrastructure of energy 
blockchain, which can be used in information security, 
power trading, multi energy cooperation and other fields [7] 
[8]. Jeong et al [9] proposed a billing system based on the 
blockchain. The billing information is stored in the 
blockchain to prevent modification and ensure the security of 
the billing information. Kang et al [10] proposed a new P2P 
energy transaction model, which uses the alliance blockchain 
method to solve the privacy protection and transaction 
security problems of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles 
(PHEVs). Therefore, the use of blockchain can solve the 
security problem of energy transaction in the IOE node. 
However, there are generally efficiency challenges in the 
transaction data market based on blockchain, the main reason 
is the delay of transaction confirmation [11]. The consensus 
process of blockchain increases the delay of transaction 
confirmation, which affects transaction efficiency and capital 
turnover. The buyer usually does not have enough funds to 
support their next transaction [12]. In order to overcome the 
above challenges, a flexible P2P loaning mechanism is 
needed to improve transaction efficiency. In [10], a digital 
cryptocoins named energy coins are proposed, which is used 
as a digital asset of energy nodes when energy transactions 
are conducted in the Internet of things. In order to solve the 
problem of insufficient energy coins, the IOT nodes in [13] 
can borrow energy coins from other IOT nodes, and propose 
an algorithm based on iterative double auction to solve the 
problem. In [14], a credit based payment scheme is designed 
to support fast and frequent energy transactions of electric

vehicles by borrowing energy coins. It can be seen that the 
transaction speed can be effectively accelerated by loaning.  
The study of the above-mentioned loaning problem is 
carried out under the assumption that the electricity price is 
deterministic, but in the actual loaning process, the electricity 
price is affected by uncertain market and human factors, and 
the electricity price information is uncertain. It is of great 
practical significance to study the decision-making of the 
loaning and charging of electric vehicles under the uncertain 
electricity price. However, as far as we know, there is no 
report on the decision-making of electric vehicle charging 
under uncertain electricity price.Scenario method is an 
important tool to build uncertain model in robust 
optimization [15], and it is widely used in uncertainty 
problems [16]. In [17], the optimal delay charge scheduling 
problem of electric vehicles is studied. Considering the 
change of grid price, the uncertain price is described as a set 
of random numbers to study the constrained stochastic 
optimization problem. Literature [18] studies the optimal 
charging strategy of the charging electric taxi, and solves the 
uncertain price problem by providing the price scenario of 
each charging time. Based on the above, we can consider 
using scenario to solve the problem of uncertain electricity 
price. 
Four main contributions are as follows. Firstly, 
considering the uncertainty of electricity price, discrete 
scenario is introduced to describe electricity price.  Secondly, 
for more than one worst-case scenario, a two scenario subset 
robust optimization criterion is defined and applied to the 
decision-making of electric vehicle loaning. At the same 
time, the relaxation algorithm is used to solve the problem. 
The robust decision-making of hybrid electric vehicle can 
effectively avoid the utility deterioration caused by the price 
fluctuation. Thirdly, a robust Stackelberg game model is 
established to describe the competitive decision-making of 
multiple PHEVs. The Stackelberg Equilibrium is realized 
under the optimal robust decision-making of all electric 
vehicles and loaning banks. Finally, simulation experiments 
are carried out, and the results show that the model is better 
than the deterministic model and the worst-case model. 
II. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF TRANSACTION PROCESS 
BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN
In blockchain, an important transaction audit stage, node 
consensus process, needs to be executed before transaction 
records are formed into blocks. Pre select trusted nodes as 
energy agents [19], who collect and manage their local 
transactions. Some energy buyers don't have enough energy 
coins for frequent energy transactions. In order to solve this 
problem, the frequent P2P energy transactions through 
energy coin loaning are considered. 
The following energy buyer refers to the electric vehicle 
that needs energy, the energy seller refers to the electric 
vehicle that can provide energy, the borrower refers to the 
energy buyer that does not have enough energy coin, and the 
loaning bank refers to the institution that can lend to the 
lender. 
First, each electric vehicle has a unique identity, private 
key and public key, and obtains the wallet address from the 
authority. Use this information as a mapping list for the EV 
and store it in the account pool. The storage pool stores all 
transaction records in the energy blockchain, while the credit 
bank records credit based payment [14]. In the energy 
transaction, after the energy buyer determines the energy 
demand, the energy agents in the blockchain collect and 
summarize the data and broadcast the demand. After the 
energy seller determines the sales amount, the energy buyer 
transfers the energy coins from its wallet to the wallet 
address provided by the energy seller. A buyer who does not
have enough energy coins can apply to the credit bank for 
token according to the credit grades to complete the payment. 
The main steps are: the borrower sends the loan request to 
the credit bank, the credit bank verifies the identity of the 
borrower, calculates the optimal loan amount and the 
corresponding interest rate and penalty rate, and sends the 
relevant loan information and the secret key and public key 
of the wallet to the borrower. When the borrower needs to 
conduct energy transaction, the energy coins in the wallet is 
used to complete the payment. After the credit bank checks 
the payment information, the corresponding energy coins in 
the wallet is transferred to the wallet address of the energy 
seller, and the balance in the wallet is updated, so the 
payment is completed. A new transaction is generated after 
payment, and then the transaction is broadcast to the energy 
agent for audit. Energy agents collect all transactions over a 
period of time and record them in blocks. Each block 
contains the encrypted hash value of the previous block, 
forming a chain. Finally, in the process of consensus, the 
energy agent who gives effective proof of workload will be 
selected as the blockchain leader.  Blockchain leaders 
broadcast block data to other energy agents for verification 
and audit. Other energy agents send their audit results to 
each other, compare them and reply. If all energy agents 
agree to the block data, the block will be stored in the 
blockchain. At the same time, blockchain leaders can get 
energy coins rewards. Therefore, the blockchain not only 
guarantees the security and privacy of energy transactions, 
but also solves the problem of transaction confirmation delay 
through the energy coins loans of electric vehicles and credit 
banks, and quickly pays transaction costs. 
III. THE STACKELBERG GAME MODEL FOR PHEVS
UNDER DETERMINISTIC ELECTRICITY PRICE
This section studies the problem of credit decision-
making in the process of frequent P2P energy transactions 
through energy coins loaning. Among them, the credit bank 
acts as the lender with enough energy coins, and the credit 
bank provides energy coins loans for electric vehicles. 
Credit bank manages and guides the charging credit 
behavior of electric vehicles by making and adjusting the 
credit policy of electric vehicles. The credit of credit bank is 
reflected in the borrowing price of energy coins (i.e. interest 
rate and penalty rate). The electric vehicle determines its 
borrowing behavior in the energy transaction under the

guidance of a certain borrowing price given by the credit 
bank. 
In order to solve the problem of loans between electric 
vehicles and the bank to get the optimal decision. It is 
assumed that the set of participants consisting of I  PHEVs 
in the electricity market is denoted by {1, , , }V i I� , , }, ,, , . The 
satisfaction  function of the i th ( i V� ) PHEV is given by
Li et al. [14] as follows:

where ,i id � are predefined factors. iR is the amount of 
energy coin given by the credit bank to the electric vehicle 
iEV . The minimum energy required by iEV is min

a determined price. 
The utility function  of iEV can be expressed as follows.

where ia is repayment ability of a loan. i�  is interest rate 
of the loan depended by the credit bank. i�  is penalty rate 
of the repayment delay. We consider that the relationship 
between the interest rate and the penalty rate is i i i it� 	 �� .
Here i	  is a predefined factor and it is the time when the
loan began. 
The income of the credit bank includes the interest of the 
loan from iEV and the penalty caused by its failure to repay 
the loan in time [20]. The cost of a credit bank is i i iR t c .
Here, ic  is the unit cost of the loan provided by the credit 
bank. Therefore, the economic benefit of the i th PHEV to
the credit bank is defined as follows.

where i� is predefined credit grade factor depended on
iEV ’scredit grade given by the credit bank. The credit
grades are classified into different levels according to credit
values. Higher credit grade brings higher i� .
This paper establishes the Stackelberg game, credit bank 
is the leader and PHEVs are the followers. The credit bank 
finally determines the penalty rate (i.e. i� ) for the i th
PHEV, and the i th PHEV determines the best loan amount 
(i.e. iR ) according to the penalty rate set by the credit bank.

that is, the penalty rate is not negative. Equation (7) is the 
constraint of electric vehicles. 
Because the price of electricity is affected by uncertain 
market and human factors, the price information is not 
completely determined. It is assumed that the price of 
electricity fluctuates within a certain range. As the price of 
electricity is an uncertain input parameter in the utility 
function of PHEVs, a new loaning decision problem is 
proposed, and a game model with uncertainty is established. 
IV. ROBUST STACKELBERG GAME MODEL FOR PHEVS
UNDER UNCERTAIN ELECTRICITY PRICE
Here we suppose that the electricity price of each time 
period fluctuates within a certain range. Considering the 
uncertainty of electricity price, we formulate a new robust 
loaning decision problem and establish a robust Stackelberg 
game (RSG) model for all PHEVs participated. 
A. The Descriptions of Uncertain Electricity Price under
Discrete Scenarios
In the real electricity market environment, the price of
electricity is actually an uncertain input parameter. In the 
case of price uncertainty, it is necessary to solve the loaning
decision problem of PHEVs again. 
Here, we consider the case where an uncertain price is 
represented by a discrete scenario. When market 
participants make decisions under uncertain price, the 
change of price will directly affect the utility of participants. 
Therefore, the uncertainty of electricity price should be 
considered in bidding decision.

fluctuation deviating from the predicted price. In the same 
� scenario, the price of each PHEVe is the same. �  is a set
of scenarios with �  price scenarios, where� �� . 
B. Robust Loaning Decision Problem for Single PHEV
Here, we use the definition of a bad scenario set. The bad
scenario set is defined based on the number of bad scenarios 
rather than the given threshold. For simplicity, bad scenario 
set containing only two scenarios is considered. In addition 
to the worst-case scenario, the optimization criterion also 
considers another bad scenario. Based on the minimum 
maximum criterion, a 2-scenario subset robust optimization 
criterion is proposed. Under the discrete scenario 
description of electricity price, the 2-scenario subset robust 
optimization criterion is applied to the loaning decision 
problem of a single PHEV, and the 2-scenario subset robust

used to obtain the optimal solution. 
The loaning decision of PHEVs and the bank will be 
affected by the price fluctuation, the utility function of the

optimal utility, game G reaches SE. When PHEVs choose 
their only loaning amount, once the bank finds *

Step 5)  If i I� , then 1i i� � ; otherwise, go to Step 2). 
V. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
An experiment was conducted to investigate the 
performance of the established RSG model under uncertain 
electricity price. All models are written in MATLAB 2017A.
All PHEVs and the bank parameters are from literature [14].
Within the price fluctuation range, the price scenarios are 
generated by the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) program 
[22]. Set the number of scenarios to 20. The price 
fluctuation range is divided into 20 equal intervals. Then, 
select a sampling point randomly from each interval to form 
a sampling point set, and each sampling point is a price 
scenario. 
We take five PHEVs to test RSG model. Fig. 2 shows the 
convergence evolution of the total economic benefits of the 
credit bank and the optimal lending volume of randomly 
selected PHEVs, respectively. After 15 iterations, the total 
economic benefit and the optimal loan amount of the bank 
converge to the optimal value rapidly.  
Figure 2.   The iterative evolution of economic benefit and loan amount.
Fig. 3 shows the impact of credit grade factor i� on the
bank's benefits. Compared with PHEV 3 and 4, the credit 
grade factors of PHEV 3 and 4 are 0.200 and 0.277 
respectively. The results show that when i� is increased, the
economic benefits of PHEV to the bank will be reduced, 
because PHEV with higher credit grade is more likely to 
repay the loan in time, resulting in less fines and reduced the 
bank benefit. 
Figure 3.  The influence of credit grade factors on bank efficiency. 
Fig. 4 shows the effect of loan repayment ability i�  on the 
benefit of PHRVs. Comparing PHEV 1 and 2, the loan 
repayment ability of PHEV 1 and 2 are respectively 0.187 
and 0.108 , the results show that the economic benefit of 
PHEV will increase when i�  is increased, because the fine 
amount of PHEV with higher loan repayment ability will be 
reduced to protect its own interests. 
We compare RSG model with two possible alternative 
models to show the advantages of RSG model. The two 
alternative models under uncertain price have the same 
game framework as RSG model. The first model is the game 
model (MNG) in the mean scenario, whose decision-making 
problem is actually the traditional certainty problem in the 
mean scenario. Under the scenario of average price, the 
price is the average price under all possible scenarios. The 
second model is the worst-case robust game model 
(WRNG), which uses the worst-case electricity price to 
describe the decision-making problem.

PHEVs.

In case 1, case 2 and case 3, three game models are tested, 
which are 5, 10 and 15 PHEVs participating in loaning 
decision. The average utility of PHEVs solution obtained 
under Stackelberg Equilibrium is recorded. The comparison 
of the three game models is shown in Table 1. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In the blockchain energy Internet, this paper discusses an
uncertain loaning decision between multiple electric vehicles 
and the bank, which ensures the transaction information 
security during the loan. In the case of price uncertainty, a 
new robust loaning decision problem for hybrid electric 
vehicles is proposed, which replaces the deterministic 
loaning decision problem. Accordingly, the robust game 
models of multiple PHEVs are established instead of the 
deterministic game models. In order to reduce the 
conservatism of the robust solution, the new robust loaning
decision problem considers more bad scenarios than the 
traditional minimum maximum robust optimization problem. 
The numerical results show that the new robust game model 
is effective and efficient.
