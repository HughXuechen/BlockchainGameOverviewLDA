ABSTRACT In recent years, the use of blockchain has gained attention in industrial interventions and
research. Blockchain technologies can be particularly utilized in the domain of Smart Governance, which
is a critical component of Smart Cities. Smart Governance aims to ensure smarter decision making,
openness and collaborative participation of all entities involved as well as help minimize resource usage,
reduce consumption and save cost. Smart Governance involves putting in place systems for monitoring
and evaluating the performance of government workers. However, government workers lack trust in these
systems because they are mostly centralized systems which are prone to single-point of failure problems
and also data fed into these systems can be tampered with by the higher-ups or employers to favour
individual workers. With these problems, there is a need for a decentralized system that can ensure trust,
tamper-resistance, accountability, reliability, transparency and security. In this paper, we propose a decen-
tralized employee evaluation system based on blockchain. We utilized a 3-chain model, namely; ID-Chain,
Behavior Chain and Credit Chain fused to make a single unified chain. Our system also makes use of an
automated game-based employee evaluation approach. Our system is based on Hyperledger Fabric as the
blockchain platform and operating mechanism. Our Proof of Concept (PoC) results shows that in utilizing
the Blockchain system, security concerns such as trust, privacy, accountability, among others, that are present
in current employee performance evaluation systems are tackled and also in the adoption of the game-based
automated system, our system can make an effective decision regarding employee performance. Our system
achieves trust, transparency, security and accountability among government workers under a Smart City
governing environment.

innovate to avoid disruptions. Governments now invest in an
aggressive and different innovation strategy that focuses on
change, revolution and results [1].
The concept of Smart City has been gaining attention
recently due to its potential of creating a city whose system is
sophisticated and able to sense and act independently [2]–[4].
A smart city should be able to embrace all the parties involved
in political participation, functioning of local administration
and services for its members (citizens). Authors in [2] define
Smart City as a city that functions well in a six-dimensional
domain: smart people, smart economy, smart living, smart
mobility, smart environment and smart governance. The ulti-
mate purpose of constructing a smart city is to enhance
the quality of living of the general citizens by seizing the
benefits from the existing modern technologies. Smart City
research is a strand of a local electronic government research
area. As a component of Smart City, smart governance aims
at applying adequate fair and transparent policies, geared
towards improving the lives of its citizens [3]. Its prime
focus is to ensure a creative, innovative, economic growth,
excellent quality of life and must be environmentally and
socially secure and safe [3].
Moreover, the performance of government officers
working in the Smart City environment needs to be evaluated
in order to reward excellent performance or improve on poor
performance. In a general view, the implementation of smart
city projects is a transformation process that requires policies,
accompanied by objectives, managed by active leadership
management which uses advanced technologies for improv-
ing its efficiency. With the same idea, we narrow it down
to an organizational scenario where the processes, as men-
tioned earlier, is implemented. As employees are the primary
backbone of every organization, and a proper performance
assessment can provide an accurate image of an employee
status at any given time. The purpose of employee evaluation
is not only to evaluate the lousy performance and enhance
it but also to promote staff to work better. An adequately
designed employee assessment system can contribute to orga-
nizational goals and improve the efficiency of employees.
It serves as a measure for current and future improvements
of an organization in other to meet their goals and objectives.
It has been proved by many research works that an effective
appraisal system is directly related to employee motivation
and productivity [5], [6].
Despite the enormous technological developments,
employee performance evaluation in most organizations
remains manual. The manual employee assessment systems
are incredibly prone to human prejudice since managers can
assess employee performance [7]. Biases can occur because
of human nature or if managers receive insufficient training
to produce impartial feedback. The managers generally con-
centrate exclusively on the latest worker results, while lousy
performance ignored in the early portion of the assessment
period. Besides, it is hard for the promoted managers to rate
thosewhowere his workers once.Moreover, the performance
FIGURE 1. Smart city components (Source: Web).
evaluations have very little priority from the managers,
as they are a time-consuming task [8].
All these variables lead to a biased performance
assessment which results in discontent among those employ-
ees who receive biased feedback. Consequently, the integrity
of the performance assessment scheme is wiped off intention-
ally or unintended. According to a study in [9], the present
performance assessment scheme discovered that only 36 per-
cent of staff were satisfied. Therefore, human biases must
be eliminated during performance assessments, and one of
the options is to move towards an automated performance
assessment scheme. However, automated employee assess-
ment schemes are still facing similar challenges of trust
and accountability. Therefore, a technology that ensures
confidence, transparency while at the end of performance
assessments, offering the staff with a rewarding experience
is needed. This is where blockchain comes in.
Blockchain, which originated from the cryptocurrency
Bitcoin [10], is one of the most ground-breaking technologies
of this era. It can store and share transparent, safe, control-
lable and unalterable information through distributed ledger
technology (DLT). It is capable of making organizations
decentralized, secure, accountable and transparent.
Thus, we propose a fully decentralized employee assess-
ment system that is base on blockchain in order to ensure
trust, transparency and accountability in a Smart City envi-
ronment. Our investigations show that this is the first of its
kind. In this paper, we denote Government Officers working
in a Smart City asEmployees and theGovernment Institution
tasked with evaluating their performance as Organization.
The contributions of this paper are enumerated below;
• Our proposed system makes use of a 3-chain model
namely; ID-Chain, Behavior Chain and Credit Chain
fused to make a single unified chain. ID-Chain is tasked
with the creation, storing and authentication of digital
IDs created for employees in the blockchain system. The
ID-chain is directly linked to the Behavior Chain and
the Credit chain which are responsible for assessment

• We present a security analysis of the digital ID
generation on the ID-chain.

evaluation approach using assessment or evaluation data
from employees to maximize organization profit.
This paper is structured into five sections. Section II
will present the background on blockchain and the need of
blockchain in employee assessment systems. In Section III,
we present our proposed system with its core protocols and
algorithms. In Section IV, we present the analysis and eval-
uation of our proposed system. Finally, the conclusion and
future works will come under section V.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Bitcoin [10] was previously the only dominant blockchain
technology application. However, this can now be applied
in other areas with further technical growth. Major sectors
include finance, insurance, health and medicine, the Internet
of Things (IoT), education, copyright, smart grid, automobile
and supply chainmanagement [11]–[14]. Blockchain is a new
and mostly open distributed block database ledger. It records
all transaction data known as blocks. Each record or block
has a timestamp and connected with the preceding block.
It does not allow data alteration of any kind and is therefore
trusted, verifiable and secure for transactions between any
two entities.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that
enables transactions to work in a decentralized manner,
i.e. enables transactions to be checked without the need of
any central organisation [15]. It makes use of cryptographic
proofs of work, digital signatures, and peer-to-peer (P2P)
networking to provide a distributed ledger containing transac-
tions [15]. Once a block is added into the blockchain, it cannot
be modified or removed for two reasons: first, a block change
would cause the hash chain values to result in wrong verifi-
cation, and secondly, a block change would require intense
efforts to change each blockchain replicate that is supposed
to be hosted at a wide variety of independent nodes. The
nodes in blockchain are organized in a P2P network [16].
There are two keys in each node in a network; a public key to
encrypt messages sent to a node, and a private key to decrypt
and to read messages by a node. The public key encoding
mechanism is therefore used to make a blockchain consistent
and irreversible and non-reputable [17].
The process of verifying and adding new blocks in the
blockchain depends on the mining process, which is based
on the proof of work method. A difficult cryptographic
puzzle has to be solved by miners and winners awarded.
The key concept behind the difficulty of the cryptographic
puzzle is to regulate the creation of fresh block proce-
dure [16]. The transactions that are not recognized in case
of a failure or invalidation are dropped. Eventually, every
node verifies and adds a copy of confirmed transactions to
their ledger. Conceptually blockchain operates by linking,
chaining and saving data blocks of transactions in a
chronological sequence.
Consequently, employee performance evaluation system
is a popular tool used by many organizations to measure
employee job performance, duties, employees and personnel
development which eventually influences the growth of any
organisation [18]. Every organization relies on the employee
assessment method. This method consists of self-evaluation,
employer evaluation and colleague evaluation. The precise
and unbiased assessment will lead to corporate policies that
evolve and fulfil the organization’s strategic objectives.
Authors in [5] suggested the use of a Decision Support
Systems with profile matching mechanisms to help identify
the most prospective employees. Their system defines the
weight value of individual attributes and proceeds with a
classification process which selects the best alternative for
the most potential employee. The outcome of an assessment
of employee performance using 200 staff assessment infor-
mation gained 93 percent precision levels whereby 193 infor-
mation corresponded to the value gained from an assessment
method.
Moreover, authors in [8] also proposed a game-theoretical
strategy for an industry IoT based assessment of employee
performance. The scheme provides helpful outcomes on
employee performance through the mining of sensory node
information from the MapReduce model. The data is then
used to make automated choices for staff by making use of
game theory. Their findings show that the suggested scheme
effectively evaluates employee performance and demon-
strates enhancement in employee efficiency compared to
other methods. It also demonstrates that the right employee
assessment system efficiently motivates staff to benefit the
entire organization. However, it fails to solve the trust and
transparency problems associated with employee assessment
systems.
Similarly, authors in [18] developed a free form online
evaluation system for organizations with a vast employee
base and intricate processes for controlling the quality of
tasks. Their scheme is versatile for the assessment of each
workforce. Their results can be correctly evaluated according
to the systematic database. Managers can improve productiv-
ity in the organization with the overall evaluation results com-
bined with standard organizational criteria. However, their
system does not solve the problem of managerial bias or the
case of tampering of the recorded data.
Authors in [19] also proposed an employee performance
assessment system based on a fuzzy logic approach which
considers different performance assessment requirements.
The principal objective of the suggested strategy is to deter-
mine the quality indicators in different qualitative and quan-
titative assessment requirements of staff taking into account
their efficiency and then choosing the most outstanding
employee with the lowest efficiency coefficient comparing
all other indicators. Fuzzy control is used to ascertain the
general index of performance by combining performance
outcomes with chosen criteria and supplied with numerical

values that will certainly provide a comfortable performance
rating calculation for the staff involved. The results of their
proposed method show that it effectively measures employee
performance. However, it fails to solve the trust and trans-
parency issues that most employees have about the entire
employee evaluation process.
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM
In this section of the paper, we give a detailed description
of the components and algorithms used in our proposed
blockchain-based employee assessment system, BEMPAS
in the smart city environment. Our system is made up of
three tiers, namely: the user tier, the blockchain tier, and the
application tier.
The figure 2 describes the architectural overview of our
proposed system. The various components are described
briefly below.
• User Layer: In this section of the paper, we give a
detailed description of the This layer is made up of
potential employees and existing employees who access
the services provided by BEMPAS system. This layer
links straight with the blockchain network and allows
potential employees to enrol in the system. A poten-
tial employee registers with the necessary attributes
of identification, and the data will be forwarded to
blockchain nodes (i.e. ID Controllers) for verification
and identification by ID providers. If the checking pro-
cess is successful, then the employee is registered on the
system.
• The Blockchain Layer: The blockchain network
consists of various participants and specialized nodes
that help to process, verify, create and manage employee
digital identities, store employee assessment informa-
tion and computes individual employee credit scores.
This layer calculates the information sent to the network
by identifying the characters with functionalities which
help to monitor all activities carried out on the network.
Blockchain technology is also known as distributed
accounting. One of its core ideas is how to keep the data
synchronized on each node, that is, to ensure that each
node can reach a consensus on the data on the chain,
which is the biggest difference between blockchain tech-
nology and other conventional database technologies.
We used two specialized nodes, namely; ID controller
nodes and Evaluation Processing nodes.
1) ID controller Nodes: These specialized group of
nodes are responsible for the creation and manage-
ment of digital IDs on the blockchain.Major digital
identity management operations include creating
and storing a new digital identity and deactivating
an existing identity.
2) Evaluation Processing Nodes: These specialized
set of nodes are also responsible for storing the
digital formats of employee assessment informa-
tion and computing the credit scores of employees
using a predefined Game theoretical approach.
We implemented a 3-Chain model; namely ID-chain,
Behavior chain and Credit chain (these are later dis-
cussed in the next section). Hyperledger Fabric, which
is a permissioned blockchain, is employed to provide
secure access to employee and organizational data.
However, permissionless blockchains can be utilized
dependent on the application environment. Due to the
inherent features of the blockchain, decentralization,
transparency and security can be achieved.
• Key Management Center: It is a fully trusted entity
on the blockchain network, and It realizes the essential
functions of key generation, hash operation, signature
verification, encryption and decryption. The key of user
data encryption and decryption is stored on the key man-
agement centre, and this entity also configures the data
encryption mode. Moreover, key management centres
use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate,
store and handle key pairs. HSM is a dedicated encryp-
tion processor explicitly designed to protect the encryp-
tion key (i.e. manages, processes, and saves encryption
keys safely in reliable and tamper-resistant devices).
Each module has one or more secure cryptoprocessor
chips to prevent tampering and bus probing. In order to
ensure the security of data encryption and decryption,
the key configuration is fully automated; no one has
access to the key and the key provider. At the same time,
the key management centre is entirely transparent for
all entities on the blockchain. Also, a limit is set to the
number of transactions the key management centre can
handle in a given period. Moreover, mechanisms are put
in place to choose another key management centre to
serve as a backup on failure or malicious instances.
• Cloud Platform: Actual data are forwarded to the cloud
for storage while all transactional logs are stored on
the blockchain system. When the data is stored on the
cloud platform, the corresponding tag attributes and cor-
responding pointers will be recorded on the blockchain.
VOLUME 8, 2020 99531
E. B. Sifah et al.: BEMPAS: A Decentralized Employee Performance Assessment System Based on Blockchain
In order to support the storage of massive and het-
erogeneous data, it is necessary to store the index,
hash value and secret key of data on the data link,
while the original data is stored on the cloud platform.
By using blockchain technology to store data solidified,
the data can be traceable, non-modifiable, and to ensure
non-repudiation.
In uploading data to the cloud, employees first upload
the original data to the system, then the system computes
the hashes of the data to get a hash value, and through the
secret key generation algorithm, get a unique data secret
key, then encrypt the original file, and finally calculate
an index. After completing these steps, the system stores
the corresponding information on the chain and uploads
the encrypted file embedded with the hash value to the
cloud platform. Once the cloud service provider receives
the transaction from the blockchain system, It checks its
validity and also confirms that cloud space is available.
If so, it computes the hash of data received and compares
it to the hash value received. If both hashesmatch, data is
stored in the cloud. This ensures that any data alterations
are noticeable by everyone in the network.
Moreover, when requesting for actual data from our
system, assuming that the requester has been authenti-
cated, our system first obtains the encrypted data from
the cloud platform through the index value stored on the
chain. The secret key on the chain decrypts the encrypted
data, verifies the hash value of the data, and finally
returns it to the requester.
• Application Layer: This tier consists of the various
applications that can be built on top of our proposed
system. Applications such as the Internet of Things
(IoT), financial services, healthcare, media, logistics,
manufacturing, among others.
A. 3-CHAIN MODEL
The 3-Chain model is the core foundation of our proposed
system. The data content and the development process of the
3-chain model is explained below. The figure 3 describes the
layered architecture of the 3-Chain model.
As stated earlier in this paper, we denote Government
Officers working in a Smart City as Employees and the
Government Institution tasked with evaluating their
performance as Organization.
1) ID-CHAIN
With the current issues regarding digital identity still
unsolved, blockchain has been chosen as one of the solu-
tions to solve this problem because of its decentralized
nature [28]–[30]. ID-chain primarily involves the collection
of government-issued IDs such as passport, national IDs,
driving license, degree certificate, work card, driving license,
real estate card information, as well as employee biometric
information.
To create a digital ID that is used in the BEMPAS system,
the users (i.e. employee) of the system needs to submit his/her
FIGURE 3. Simplified 3-Chain model.
details, government-issued ID or valid document as well
as his/her biometric information to the blockchain system.
Upon hiring, every employee’s biometric data are collected,
and a hashed copy is stored on the blockchain system using
SHA-256. This guarantees that nobody can calculate a pre-
image of the hash. We define that every employee after an
appointment belongs to a particular department based on
his skills and profession. The blockchain system verifies the
information (government ID plus biometric data) submitted
by the employees, and after successful verification, a digital
ID is then created. Users are not granted access to organiza-
tional transactions and opportunities until their identities are
activated after successful verification.
We suggest the use of key-value pairs encrypted with a
cryptographic key owned by the employee [31]. Encrypted
hashes of employee private data attributes are aggregated
and stored on the blockchain system. Digital identities can
be described as key-value binding-entries. For instance, two
entries such as key = passport number + hashed biometric
data and the value = D123246 + sqw3123814. Moreover,
JSON-LD3 is used to convey workings of the ‘‘keys’’ of
digital identity. As a result, each employee will have a unique
identifier in the blockchain system. Our scheme for digital
ID creation is mostly based on the work done in [20]. In this
work, we consider a process which incorporates four key
participants denoted as:
• Employee: An employee is the one whom a digital ID is
created to uniquely identify him/herself and to interact
with the blockchain system.
• Identity Provider: Identity provider is a centralized
entity which enables the user to build the blockchain
system’s digital identity. We suppose that the creator of
the identity is trusted, i.e. it does not cooperate in the
production of false digital IDs. As a government agency
generally acts as an identity-maker, this is a reasonable
hypothesis.
• Aggregated Biometrics: These are the biometric infor-
mation such as fingerprint, face and voice of employees
that are stored on the blockchain system. This sensitive
biometric information is encrypted and only applied
when the ID Controllers has to check if the fingerprint
of an employee matches the recorded one.

E. B. Sifah et al.: BEMPAS: A Decentralized Employee Performance Assessment System Based on Blockchain
FIGURE 4. Proposed ID-Chain component.
• Identity Controllers: Identity Controllers are a set of
specialized nodes that operate together to share identity-
related transactions on the blockchain scheme in con-
nection with identification operations. These specialized
group of nodes are responsible for the creation and
management of digital IDs on the blockchain. Major
digital identity management operations include adding a
new digital identity and deactivating an existing identity.
Both can also be combined to update an existing identity.
1) Storing New Digital ID: The digital identity Did
will only take effect once it is incorporated into
the blockchain system. However, after the Did has
been created, a consensus protocol will be initi-
ated, and Idcon nodes will establish whether theDid
should be accepted or not.
2) Deactivating an Existing ID: If an employee loses
his/her private key, a transaction can be sent to
the blockchain requesting that the correspond-
ing (Did ) be revoked. One or more (Idcon) nodes
have to endorse the deactivation transaction and
decide whether to include it in the blockchain.
Unless endorsed, an employee cannot send a deac-
tivation transaction; otherwise, a denial-of-service
(DOS) attack can be launched. Participants will
not accept the signatures generated using sk after
the cancellation transaction is included in the
blockchain.
If Algorithm 1 succeeds, Did = h(k, v) is the employee’s
digital identity which is recognizable for other users in the
blockchain system.
• Security Analysis of Digital IDGeneration: Our system
guarantees that only one unique digital ID belonging
to a real owner can be created for a user enrolled on
our system [20], [31]. It does this by ensuring these
features;
1) Binding: Binding means that the digital identity
used in this blockchain is linked with the user,
identity issued by his/her government and

biometric information. If the binding characteristic
is not maintained, the digitally identified person
who uses it may not reflect the correct information.
Only legitimate users may authenticate themselves
on the blockchain system using their biometric
information (e.g. fingerprint, voice or face) to
permit them to interact with the system
2) Integrity: Since blockchain uses one-way hash
functions to regulate data manipulation of any kind
on the system, it protects the integrity of all data
stored on; thus, a hashed identity cannot be altered
in any way.
3) Privacy: A pre-image of hashed digital iden-
tity cannot be revealed without the employee’s
consent.
4) Non-repudiation: An employee cannot alter his/her
digital identity or repudiate its ownership.
5) Timestamp: it is easy to prove the specific time an
identity was generated, modified or revoked (and
thus, invalid), using the blockchain system.

2) BEHAVIOR CHAIN
Behaviour in this system refers explicitly to the work
behaviour and activities of employees in an organization. Our
system captures employee behaviour data by getting output
data from Management Information Systems (MIS) from the
various departments of the government organization such as
their Office Automation (OA) systems, Financial systems,
Workflow Systems, among others. The system will link up
the data of performance assessment information, on-the-job
information and job change information of employees and
update their behaviour information according to these data.
The organization’s automatic data acquisition goal is
accomplished by utilizing IoT systems installed in the orga-
nizational infrastructure [32]. The quantity and type of infor-
mation that the IoT devices receive are dependent on the
organization. The organization embed GPS and IoT devices
in their infrastructure to collect data on employees, such
as their identification, location, among others [8]. The data
gathered by sensor nodes and other IoT systems are used to
show the behaviours of employees in the organization, i.e. IoT
sensors can be used to monitor employee activities depending
on the organization’s requirements.
IoT devices such as RFID sensors are used to track the
movement of employees. For instance, employee movement
will be recorded at the main-gate or at any sub-gates, which
will be considered as checking points, and these data inputs
are sent to the blockchain network to be analyzed and
stored on the chain. All sensor inputs are, therefore trans-
lated into different types of activity sets and then used to
assess employee performance by measuring their engage-
ment in different activities. Other types of data inputs,
such as employee log-ins and employee use of organiza-
tions resources, are also recorded. Consequently, all data
recorded from the monitoring of employee behaviours in the
organization are recorded on the behaviour chain. Evalua-
tion processing nodes are responsible for determining the
overall participation of employees towards organizational
objectives.
Behavior data acquired from the various departments
are analyzed using colocation mining [8], [25], where an
employee’s participation in positive or negative behaviours
is determined. An employee Ex is said to be engaged in a
behaviour By when Ex and By are colocated, where By can be
any event of daily behaviour set B.
Employee’s organizational behaviours are divided into two
types: positive and negative behaviours. Positive behaviours
are beneficial to the organization, while negative behaviours
lead to a loss to the organization. Some behaviours such as
high achievements of organizational goals constitute positive
behaviours whiles behaviours such as lateness, absenteeism,
insubordination are negative behaviours. The set of all posi-
tive behaviours is described as the positive behaviour set BP,
and the set of all negative behaviours is referred to as the
negative behaviour set BN . In addition, a set ‘‘B’’ compris-
ing all employee behaviours recorded during the day by an
FIGURE 5. A simplified block and transaction structure.
immediate supervisor is called a daily behaviour set such that
B = BP ∪ BN .
Our proposed system assesses employee performance
using a participation index (PI) [25] to calculate an
employee’s involvement in the positive and negative
behaviours. The participation of an employee Ex in behaviour
sets BP and BN is done by computing the PI for each
behaviour set type using
PI
(
Ex ,By
)
=
α
β
(1)
PI (Ex ,B) = PI (Ex ,BP)− PI (Ex ,BN ) (2)
where α is the number of participating behaviours in a
behaviour set, and β is the total number of behaviours in
the behaviour set, By denotes the behaviour sets BP and BN .
Higher PI (Ex , BP) value suggests higher employee partici-
pation in positive behaviours. The same thing applies to PI
(Ex , BN ). After computing the values of PI (Ex , BP) and PI
(Ex , BN ), the system calculates the overall employee par-
ticipation in all the behaviours [represented as PI (Ex , B)],
following equation 2.
Behavior chain is far more than simply recording data.
It can provide a time-axis-based record of the employee’s
behaviour. In addition to supporting auditor’s review more
effectively and quickly, it also provides a basis for the
construction of a credit chain.
Moreover, the figure 5 above is a simplified structure we
utilized in our blockchain set-up. The block structure includes
the block ID which specifies the block height (it uniquely
identifies the block); the block header (i.e. metadata about the
block) which includes several fields such as version which
is used to keep track of software upgrades; previous block
hash which is a reference to the hash of the previous (parent)
block; merkle root, which is a hash of the root of the merkle
tree of this block’s transactions; timestamp, which specifies
the creation time of the block. The transaction counter keeps
track of the number of transactions in the chain and the
99534 VOLUME 8, 2020

transaction field specifies the transactions recorded in the
chain.
Similarly, the transaction structure consists of several fields
such as; transaction ID which uniquely identifies a specific
transactions in the chain; employee ID, the entity initiating
the transaction; transaction type which determines the kind
of transaction being initiated; chain which specifies which
chain this transaction is to be stored on; transaction hash is
the hash value created for that particular transaction, transac-
tion time determines the time the transaction was made and
finally transaction details provides a brief description of the
transaction.
3) CREDIT CHAIN
The Credit Chain incorporates rewards and punishment
information. We utilized a game-based automated employee
evaluation approach [21]–[24]. Employees who participate
more positively must be compensated, while employees who
participate in behaviours that violate organizational poli-
cies should be punished. The game theory automates the
decision-making method. The choice is to reward or punish
an employee for beneficial or bad work. The game theory
is centred on matters involving the organization and the
employee.
• Game Parameters:
1) R denotes Reward
2) P denotes Punishment
3) L denotes Loss to the organization
4) F denotes Profit to the organization
5) SM denotes management strategy
6) SN denotes non-management strategy
• Game Players and Their Strategies: Two viable players
in the game are identified, organization and employee.
The aim of player 1 (organization) is not just to maxi-
mize its profit, but also to construct an intelligent, secure
and reliable organization. This objective is achieved
by motivating competent and honest staff to receive
rewards or by using punitive action against misbehav-
ing staff. The system thus determines the strategy set
Sg = (SR, SP) for player 1, where SR and SP are
respectively the reward and punishment policies.
Player 2 (employee) can contribute to the development
of the organization or his/her benefits. The workers
involved in organizational development tasks are said
to pursue a management strategy SM , and the employ-
ees who work against the organization or who partic-
ipate in operations that violate company policies are
said to pursue a non-management strategy SN . This
system, therefore, defines a strategy set for player 2 as
Sy = (SM , SN ).
• Game Payoff: In computing the payoff for each strat-
egy, the model calculates the cost-benefit matrix for
the game. If the organization decides to use strategy
Si and employee uses strategy Sj, then let Go (Si, Sj)
and Ge (Si, Sj) indicate organization and employee
FIGURE 6. Cost-benefit matrix.
payoff, respectively. Moreover, when the organization
utilizes a reward strategy, and the employee uses a
management strategy, the employee receives the reward
‘‘R’’. The organization, on the other hand, obtains profit
‘‘F’’ as a result of management strategy played by
employees but must bear reward ‘‘R’’ costs. Therefore,
Go (SR, SM = F - R) and Ge (SR, SM ) = R.
If the organization employs rewards strategy without
management of staff, then the organization spends on
reward ‘‘R’’ costs, but the workers don’t gain (i.e are
not rewarded) nor lose. Therefore, Go (SR, SN = 0) and
Ge (SR, SN ) = 0. However, the employees are denied a
reward if the organization selects SP while the worker
performs SM , and the organization does not bear any
costs. Thus, Go (SP, SM = 0) Ge (SP, SM ) = 0.
When the organization plays the punishment strategy
and employees select the non-management strategy,
employees get punished ‘‘P’’. Moreover, the organiza-
tion is subject to loss ‘‘L’’. Hence, Go (SP, SN = L) and
Ge (SP, SN ) = P.
• Nash Equilibrium: It is clear from the cost-benefit
matrix that the employee is given the greatest benefit
when it plays the management strategy and the organi-
zation rewards. Therefore, (SR, SM ) provides employees
with the best gain. The organization’s ultimate gain is
the same. Thus, the best strategy profile to adopt is
(SR, SM ), which then forms the pure Nash equilibrium
of the game.
Therefore, to select a particular employee or groups of
employees to award credits to, we total the number of rewards
against the total number of punishments taking it to account
their overall Participation Index (PI). If the total number of
rewards outweighs the total number of punishments for a
particular employee, he/she can be selected to obtain incen-
tives which can be in the form of job promotions, mone-
tary benefits, weekends vacations, among others. Also, this
information is stored in the credit chain.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION
In this section, we demonstrate our system execution and also
assess our system efficiency. We tested and evaluated some

system parameters. Employees wanting to be part of our sys-
tem will need to submit their government IDs together with
their biometric information to the blockchain system. After
successful verification of the government IDs and biometric
data, the ID controller nodes generate digital IDs for them,
and the transactions pertaining to that particular identity is
processed into a block.
We made use of the Hyperledger Fabric (v1.0.2) [26]. On a
desktop computer with 3.0 GHz, Intel i-7, 16 GB 1600 MHz
DDR3 simulating the global blockchain; we used a Ubuntu
16.04.1 operating system. The peer nodes were operated
with a virtualization technique based on Ubuntu containers.
We created two groups of specialized nodes, namely; ID
Controller nodes and Evaluation processing peer nodes for
the Global blockchain network. Moreover, we also indicate
the location of the Membership Service Provider (MSP) path
for eachmember. Orderer specifies the configuration or trans-
action structure such as the number of transactions per block,
maximum block size, and maximum transactions processing
time. In our set-up, we chose to fine-tune these values accord-
ing to experimental requirements. The underlying platform
onwhich our blockchain system relies adopts a mechanism of
pluggable consensus algorithm based on PBFT [27]. Through
this mechanism, the whole system can easily switch the con-
sensus algorithm, thus realizing the flexibility and scalability
of the system. Three distinct experiments are used to assess
the performance of our proposed system. The first test was
concerned with ID-chain, and it involves the time it takes
for the ID controller nodes to generate the digital IDs for
employees. The generation of IDs for an employee involves
the verification of the submitted government IDs with ID
providers and also verifying that the biometric information
submitted matches the one recorded on the system. The sec-
ond test was focused on the block generation time in our
system, and lastly, we made a comparison between a Game-
theoretical approach and Fuzzy logic approach to justify the
reason we chose to use the Game-theory.
FIGURE 7. ID-Chain processing time.
FIGURE 8. Block processing time.
Figure 7 shows the time it takes for several digital IDs to
be created on the system. It can, therefore, be seen that there
is a steady increase in the time it takes for the generation of
digital IDs as the number of employees increases. Similarly,
it is the same for ID verification; as the number of digital IDs
that need verification increase, so does the processing time.
Figure 8 shows the block processing time. The time it
takes for the blockchain nodes to validate and process the
transactions emanating from the chain into blocks and add
them to the chain. It can be seen that there is a linear rise
as the number of blocks increases, so does the time it takes
to process them and add them to the chain. Unlike execution
time, the space required for execution increases only linearly
with the increasing blocks since the data for each employee
are stored separately.
Consequently, to ascertain the benefits of using the game
theory for decision making, we experimented on using a
fuzzy logic system to automate the decision-making process
of employee performance evaluation and compared it to that
of the game theory. The following settings are created for
comparison purposes.
• Setting 1: The Game Theoretical Decision Making
• Setting 2: The Fuzzy Logic system is used rather than
the game theory
Figure 9 shows the comparison between the decision making
computation using game theory and that of using fuzzy logic.

FIGURE 9. Justification for choosing Game-Theory.
TABLE 1. Comparison between proposed system and other related
systems.
The processing time was recorded for the game-theory-based
system and the Fuzzy Logic system in a 60 minutes exper-
iment where data was sent to the system. It should be noted
that in the above experiment, only the decision-makingmodel
is changed whiles the rest of the system remains unchanged.
It can be observed from figure 9, that with the increase in
the number of employees, the game-theory based decision
making time is lower than that of the fuzzy logic. This is as
a result of the less complicated nature of the game theory
process. The fuzzy logic process involves the creation of
complex structures which sometimes prolongs the processing
time for decision making.

A. SYSTEM COMPARISON
To validate our proposed system, we compared them with
current employee evaluation systems in multiple aspects.
The table above shows the comparison between our pro-
posed system and other related systems. Our approach
which utilized the blockchain system was able to ensure
decentralized storage, data immutability, quality, high
returns, privacy and accountability which makes our system
trustworthy, transparent and robust as compared with other
related systems.
• Decentralized Storage: Our proposed system benefits
from the strengths of using a decentralized database,
while most current systems use the centralized database.
Any participant (employee and employer) has com-
plete control of their information (assets) due to the
differentiation of private and public key(s). Any particu-
lar company or employee can refuse no unique authenti-
cation and contract information. Our framework reduces
the risk of a single point failure (SPF) because it takes
advantage of reliable validation from multiple entry
points. However, most existing employee evaluation sys-
tems are centralized, thus face a single point of failure
problems.
• Immutability: With the use of hashing (i.e. SHA
256), data within our system is virtually impossible to
alter or tamper. Contrary, current evaluation systems
face many problems when it comes to data tampering.
• Returns: Our system requires a large amount of storage
space, a higher rate of power usage, and this requires
more effort during the initial set-up phase relative to the
current systems. However, in the long run, the return
is projected to be even higher than the cost. It shall
also save any extra costs incurred as a result of losing
employees due to biased evaluations and taking ineffec-
tive decisions as compared to existing systems, as stated
in the introduction of this article. Moreover, consulting
intermediate or third parties shall incur unreasonable
fees for handling training, testing, dispute resolution,
among others. However, blockchain removes the need
for intermediaries and thereby reduces the company’s
spending. Furthermore, businesses appreciate an open
and impartial employee evaluation system.
• Security: Our system guarantees high security.
Blockchain technology is implemented via the use
of cryptographic techniques for data encryption and
decryption. This technique requires strong data security
and the use of both private and public keys to read
transactions in each blockchain, as well as to perform
some transaction. The principle that all nodes in the
network must first validate the transaction before each
node executes the transaction increases the security of
this smart technology.
• Privacy: Data within our system is completely private.
Without the proper authorization keys or credentials,
access to particular employees, information is strictly
prohibited. Contrary, this is not always the case in
existing systems.
• Accountability: History and logs of network transac-
tions are kept, and thus it guarantees accountability of
system operations.
• Overall Quality: The use of blockchain technology
guarantees the quality of the system. Our system can
process, record, verify and order employee information
with full transparency and safety. Because our system
does not allow any wrong and biased assessments, there
is no room for system quality reduction as compared to
current systems.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we proposed BEMPAS, an employee
performance evaluation system based on blockchain for
VOLUME 8, 2020 99537

Smart city governance. The blockchain system is composed
of 3-chains referred to as ID-Chain, Behavior Chain and
Credit chain that works together to evaluate employee per-
formance. We utilized a game-theoretical approach where
a game is played between the Government Institution
denoted as Organization and Government Officers denoted
as Employees. The organization tries to get more benefits
by incentivizing its employees to work harder towards the
good of the company. Our Proof of Concept (PoC) result
shows that our system is effectively able to motivate the
employees in addition to effectively evaluating their per-
formance. The employees feel encouraged by the incen-
tives they receive for achieving organizational objectives.
Also, our system achieves trust, transparency, security and
accountability among government workers under a Smart
City governing environment. Future works might include the
use of blockchain in other Smart City areas.
