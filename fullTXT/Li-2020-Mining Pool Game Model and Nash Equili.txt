ABSTRACT Blockchain technology, has the characteristics of decentralization, openness and transparency,
so that everyone can participate in database recording. Therefore, blockchain technology has a good
application prospect in various industries. As the most successful application of blockchain technology,
the Bitcoin system applies the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Under the PoW consensus
mechanism, eachminer competes through his own power to solve a SHA256mathematical problem together,
so as to gain profits. Due to the difficulty of the cryptography puzzle, miners tend to join the mining pool to
obtain stable income. And the block withholding attacks will be carried out between the mining pools, so as
to maximize his own income by controlling the infiltration rate dispatched to other mining pools. In this
paper, we build a game model between mining pools based on the PoW consensus algorithm, and analyze its
Nash equilibrium from two perspectives. The influence of the mining pools’ power, the ratio of the power to
be infiltrated, and the betrayed rate of dispatched miners on the mining pool’s infiltration rate selection and
income were explored, and the results were obtained through numerical simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a kind of chained data structure which
combines data blocks in chronological order and ensures
the tamper proof and forgery proof distributed ledger by
cryptography. It uses a distributed consensus algorithm to
generate and update data, uses cryptography to ensure the
security of data transmission and access, uses the intelligent
contract composed of automatic script code to program and
operate data [1]. Because of its advantages in reducing costs,
improving security and decentralization, blockchain tech-
nology has a wide range of application prospects, such as
big data [2], smart grid [3], [4], Internet of Things [5],
medical use [6]. Blockchain also has potentially huge appli-
cation value in financial fields such as international exchange,
letters of credit, equity registration, and stock exchanges.
The application of blockchain technology in the financial
industry can eliminate the need for third-party intermedi-
ary links and achieve direct peer-to-peer docking, thereby

greatly reducing costs and quickly completing transaction
payments [7]. Blockchain can also be naturally combined in
the field of logistics. It facilitates to reduce logistics costs and
improve the efficiency of supply chain management [8], [9].
The consensus mechanism is an important part of
blockchain technology, which determines the degree of
decentralization in blockchain technology, as well as the
security and efficiency of blockchain technology. It allows
the nodes on the entire network to reach a consensus and
create a trust-free bookkeeping mechanism on the blockchain
to ensure the consistency and authenticity of each transaction
on all bookkeeping nodes. As the most successful applica-
tion of blockchain technology, the Bitcoin system applies a
Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The core idea
of the PoW consensus mechanism is to ensure the consis-
tency of data and the security of consensus by introducing
the computing power competition to the distributed nodes.
In the system, each node competes with its own computing
power to jointly solve a SHA256 mathematical problem,
that is, to find a nonce in the entire network to ensure that
the double SHA256 operation result of the block header

of the current block is less than or equal to a predefined
value. Once a node finds a random number that meets the
requirements, the node will get the bookkeeping right of the
current block as a reward, and the bookkeeper will also get
a certain income [10], [11]. The above-mentioned process
of obtaining rewards by implementing bookkeeping is also
called ‘‘mining’’, and the nodes participating in mining are
called ‘‘miners’’ [12]. Miners receive benefits based on their
own computing power. It is difficult for small miners to
succeed in mining alone.In order to obtain a more stable
income, the miners choose to join the mining pool and mine
together with other miners [13], and share rewards according
to their own computing power [14].
A mining pool consists of a pool administrator and several
miners. Miners use computing power to mine and send a par-
tial Proofs of Work (PPoW) or a full Proofs of Work (FPoW)
to obtain a gain proportional to the computing power. Sending
part of the workload proof is not valuable to the Bitcoin
system, and can only be used as a standard for measuring the
miner’s contribution to the computing power. In other words,
the miner did not contribute effective computing power but
obtained part of the profit of the mining pool. This behavior
is called block withholding attacks. In a mining pool, miners
can perform block withholding attacks on the mining pool
and share the benefits of the mining pool with other miners.
However, mining pools can also use miners to infiltrate into
other mining pools and conduct block withholding attacks on
other mining pools to obtain revenue in order to increase the
total revenue of their own mining pools. For example, mining
pool i sends a miner to infiltrate into mining pool j, and the
miner sends partial proofs of work in mining pool j. That
is, the miner did not mine effectively in mining pool j, but
received the proceeds from mining pool j. And bring the
income back to the original mining pool i, thereby increasing
the income of the original mining pool i. This is a block
withholding attack between mining pools. And, there will be
a situation where miners who infiltrate into mining pool j
will betray, that is, the miners faithfully mine in the mining
pool j and do not bring the revenue back to the original mining
pool i. In this case, for the original mining pool i, the revenue
is lost. That is, for the original mining pool i, the behavior
of the miners is betrayal. So, how to determine whether
the mining pool is attacking or not and how to identify the
betrayal miners? We plan to sign corresponding agreements
when miners join the mining pool. The agreement stipulates
that miners in the mining pool shall not enter other mining
pools. And from the beginning to the end of a round of
mining, no other miners are allowed to join the mining pool.
Then in each mining process, the number of miners in the
mining pool is fixed. Once theminers in themining pool enter
into other mining pools, it is regarded as an ‘‘attack’’, and the
system will automatically give the mining pool punishment
measures. If it appears at the beginning of mining, the miners
in one mining pool enter other mining pools. And until the
end of one round of mining, the miner did not return, that
is, the number of miners in the two mining pools no longer
changed, and this miner was regarded as a betrayal miner in
the original pool. In order to make the content of the paper
research more standardized and rigorous, the mining pools
studied in the paper are considered as the closedmining pools.
At present, there are also some research results on the
mining dilemma. Lewenberg Y et al. mapped the miner’s
choice of mining pool into a cooperative game model, and
the miner increased his own income by changing the mining
pool he chose to join [15]. Tang et al. start with the mining
dilemma of pow consensus algorithm, analyze the existence
conditions of Nash equilibrium of miner’s strategy selection
in the process of pow consensus, and optimize miner’s strat-
egy selection with zero determinant strategy [16]. Fan et al.
combined with time-series difference enhancement algo-
rithm and adaptive zero determinant strategy to deal with
the problem of mutual attacks between mining pools [17].
Wang Tiantian et al. used the deep gradient learning strategy
gradient algorithm to study the strategy choice of iterative
prisoner’s dilemma and deal with the Nash equilibrium prob-
lem of mining dilemma [18]. Eyal analyzes the existence of
the mining dilemma, that is, the Nash equilibrium chooses
the attack strategy for the mining pool, and the profit when
the mining pool chooses to attack is not higher than the profit
when it chooses not to attack [19]. Chang et al. analyzed
UBA(uncle-block attack)’s incentive compatibility and iden-
tified and modelled the critical systems- and environmental-
parameters which determine the attack’s impacts [20].
However, considering the blockchain system’s participation
in the reward and punishment system and the mining pool’s
betrayal rate, no relevant research results have appeared. The
main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• The mining pool game model from the perspective of
system rewards and punishments is established and its
Nash equilibrium is analyzed. We get the relationship
between the profit of the mining pool and the reward and
punishment in the Nash equilibrium.
• The mining pool game model from the perspective
of block withholding attacks between mining pools is
established. That is, the infiltrate rate and betrayal rate
of the mining pool are considered. And the Nash equi-
librium and the value of infiltrate rate under the Nash
equilibrium are analyzed.
• The influence of the mining pool’s computing power,
the ratio of the power to be infiltrated, and the betrayed
rate of dispatched miners on the mining pool’s infiltra-
tion rate selection and income are explored. The results
were verified through numerical simulation.
The organizational structure of this paper is as follows:
From the perspective of adding a reward and punishment
system to the blockchain system, a multi-pool mining game
model is established, and its pure strategy Nash equilib-
rium and mixed strategy Nash equilibrium are analyzed
in Section II. From the perspective of block withholding
attacks between mining pools, that is, considers the infiltrate
rate and betrayal rate of the mining pool, analyzes the Nash
equilibrium and the value of infiltrate rate under the Nash

equilibrium in Section III. Through numerical simulation,
section IV explores the influence of the mining pool’s com-
puting power, the ratio of the power to be infiltrated, and
the betrayed rate of dispatched miners on the mining pool’s
infiltration rate selection and income. We summarizes and
prospects our work in Section V.
II. GAME ANALYSIS OF MINING POOLS
A. MODEL DESCRIPTION
Assume that in a blockchain system based on the PoW
consensus, M mining pools are formed by miners to obtain
revenue through mining. Suppose the mining power vector
is p = (p1, . . . , pi, . . . , pM ), pi is the mining power of the
mining pool i, mining pool i will send the miners in its own
pool to infiltrate other pools for block withholding attacks.
Let the total power income in the system be R, and R = 1.
In the case of attacking the mining pool, the mining pool that
chooses not to attack will get an extra reward of a(0 ≤ a ≤ 1)
given by the system, and the mining pool that chooses to
attack will get the penalty of ka(k ≥ 1), where k is the
proportion of penalty to reward. di(di ≥ 0) is the average
profit of the pool that chooses to attack, d ′i is the final average
gain from other mining pools when the pool i chooses to
attack. Set the number of non attacking mining pools other
than mining pool i as m,m ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,M − 1}.
(1) When m = M − 1, pool i choose not to attack, and the
mining pool i gains pi · R = pi, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,M}.
(2) When 0 ≤ m < M − 1, mining pool i chooses not to
attack, set d ′i ≥ 0, then the profit of mining pool i is pi +
a− (M −m− 1)di, if mining pool i chooses to attack, and its
profit is pi − ka+ (M − 1)d ′i , that is:
ui =
{
pi + a− (M − m− 1)di, i chooses N strategy
pi − ka+ (M − 1)d ′i , i chooses A strategy
(1)
(3)When all mining pools choose to attack each other, their
returns meet 6M
i=1(M − 1)d ′i = 0.
Let’s take M = 2 as an example, because here we only
analyze the relationship between the system reward a and the
mining pool to reach the Nash equilibrium, so the profit of
the mining pool in the model obtained through the infiltrating
power is temporarily represented by d . The third part will
analyze d in detail. Their benefits are as follows:
1) NO MINING POOL ATTACK
When both mining pools choose N (Not to attack), that is,
neither miner is sent to infiltrate into the other mining pool,
and the profit obtained by mining pool 1 is p1 · 1 = p1, in the
same way, the profit of mining pool 2 is p2.
2) A MINING POOL ADOPTS THE A(ATTACK) STRATEGY
If mining pool 1 chooses not to attack, it will receive a reward
of a. Although mining pool 2 that chooses the attack strategy
will be punished by ka, it will share the profits in pool 1
by infiltrating miners, so pool 1 will lose the return of d ,
then the return expression of pool 1 is p1 + a − d , and the
TABLE 1. The meaning of the symbols that appear in the paper.
TABLE 2. Payoff of pool.
return expression of pool 2 is p2 − ka+ d . Similarly, mining
pool 1 chooses to attack, earns d by infiltrate miners into
mining pool 2, and gets punishment ka. The mining pool 2
that chooses not to attack gets a reward of a, but will lose the
profit of d , then the return expression of pool 1 is p1−ka+d ,
and the return expression of pool 2 is p2 + a− d .
3) TWO MINING POOL ATTACKS
When the mining pools choose to attack, the mining pools
infiltrate the miners into the other mining pool and are pun-
ished ka. Suppose that the final mining pool 2 receives more
revenue from mining pool 1 than mining pool 1, then mining
pool 1 loses d ′, mining pool 2 gets d ′, and mining pool 1’s
income expression is p1−ka−d ′, the mining pool 2’s income
expression is p2 − ka+ d ′.
B. NASH EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
1) PURE STRATEGY NASH EQUILIBRIUM
When a < d ′ < d < ka and a − d < d ′ − ka < d − ka.
When the mining pool 1 chooses not to attack, the mining
VOLUME 8, 2020 101051
W. Li et al.: Mining Pool Game Model and Nash Equilibrium Analysis for PoW-Based Blockchain Networks
pool 2 increases its own revenue by selecting the non-attack
strategy; when the mining pool 1 selects the attack strategy,
the mining pool 2 will not significantly reduce the revenue
by selecting the attack. It can be obtained that the Nash
equilibrium points of the mining pool 1 and the mining pool 2
are (N, N) and (A, A).
When d > d ′ > ka. When the mining pool 1 chooses
not to attack, the mining pool 2 increases its own revenue
by selecting the attack strategy; when the mining pool 1
selects the attack strategy, the mining pool 2 will increase its
own income by selecting the attack, so the Nash equilibrium
is (A, A).
When d ′ < d < a and a− d > 0, d ′ − ka < d − ka < 0.
When the mining pool 1 chooses not to attack, the mining
pool 2 will not reduce its own revenue by selecting the
non-attack strategy; when the mining pool 1 selects the attack
strategy, the mining pool 2 chooses not to attack the strategy
to increase its own revenue than the attack strategy. At this
time, the Nash equilibrium point is (N, N).
It is analyzed that in the case of a < d ′ < d < ka and
a−d < d ′−ka < d−ka, the Nash equilibrium is (N, N) and
(A, A). If both mining pools choose to attack each other, then
the income of the two mining pools will not be high when
the cooperation is selected, and the system revenue will also
decrease. In order to improve system revenue, we apply the
ZD strategy to the mining pool game.
2) MIXED STRATEGY NASH EQUILIBRIUM
The mining pool game has a unique mixed Nash equilibrium
point. Set the probability that mining pool 1 chooses not to
attack is x, (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), and the probability that mining
pool 2 chooses not to attack is y, (0 ≤ y ≤ 1), then the
expected return of mining pool 1 choosing not to attack is:
p1 + (1− y)(a− d), (2)
the expected return of mining pool 2 choosing not to attack
is:
yd + p1 − ka− (1− y)d ′. (3)
Under the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium point,
the expected return of the mining pool choosing different
strategies is the same, namely:
p1 + (1− y)(a− d) = yd + p1 − ka− (1− y)d ′, (4)
namely,
y =
(k + 1)a+ d ′ − d
a+ d ′
. (5)
Similarly, for mining pool 2, the expected return from
choosing not to attack is:
p2 + (1− x)(a− d), (6)
the expected return on the chosen attack is:
xd + p2 − ka+ (1− x)d ′. (7)
According to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium point,
the mining pool chooses different strategies with the same
expected return, which is:
p2 + (1− x)(a− d) = xd + p2 − ka+ (1− x)d ′, (8)
namely,
x =
(k + 1)a− d ′ − d
a− d ′
. (9)
According to the expressions of x, y, we can get the condi-
tions under which the mixed Nash equilibrium exists:
|a− d | > |ka− d ′|or|a− d ′| > |ka− d |. (10)
Theorem 1: In the mixed strategy, for the mining pool 1,
when d − kd ′ < 0, the probability of the mining pool 1
choosing not to attack x is inversely proportional to the value
of a. When d − kd ′ > 0, the probability that the mining
pool 1 chooses not to attack x is proportional to the value of a.
The probability that the mining pool 2 chooses not to attack
y is always proportional to the value of a, that is, the greater
the value of a, the greater the probability that mining pool 2
chooses not to attack, and the conditions under which the
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists are:
|a− d | > |ka− d ′|or|a− d ′| > |ka− d |. (11)
Remark 1: When both mining pools attack each other,
when the income of mining pool 1 is p1 − ka + d ′ and the
income of mining pool 2 is p2−ka−d ′, the above conclusions
about x, y are opposite.
Corollary 1: Under the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
point, when 0 < a < a1, the expected return of the mining
pool 1 e1 is proportional to a. When a1 < a < 1, the expected
return e1 of mining pool 1 is inversely proportional to a,
where a1 = d
k − d
′, d =
√
k2d ′2 + kdd ′ + k2dd ′ + kd2.
Proof: Substituting Eq.(5) into Eq.(2), the expected
return of the mining pool 1 is:
e1 = p1 + (1− y)(a− d)
= p1 + [1−
(k + 1)a+ d ′ − d
a+ d ′
](a− d)
=
−ka2 + (p1 + d + kd)a+ p1d ′ − d2
a+ d ′
. (12)
Derivating e1:
e′1 =
−ka2 − 2kd ′a+ dd ′ + kdd ′ + d2
(a+ d ′)2
. (13)
Because (a + d ′)2 > 0 holds, let −ka2 − 2kd ′a + dd ′ +
kdd ′ + d2 = 0. After calculation, the axis of symmetry is
a = −d ′ < 0, and there is a root greater than zero,
a1 =
kd ′ −

Therefore, when 0 < a < a1, e′1 > 0, the expected
return of the mining pool 1 e1 is proportional to a. When
a1 < a < 1, the expected return e1 of mining pool 1
is inversely proportional to a, where a1 = d
k − d ′, d =
√
k2d ′2 + kdd ′ + k2dd ′ + kd2.
Corollary 2: Under the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
point,
(i) when d
d ′ > 1 + k and 0 < a < a2, the expected
return of the mining pool 2 e2 is proportional to a. When
a2 < a < 1, the expected return of the mining pool 2 e2
is inversely proportional to a, where a2 = d̃
k + d ′, d̃ =
√
k2d ′2 − kdd ′ − k2dd ′ + kd2.
(ii) When d
d ′ < 1 + k , d ′ < 0.5 and a3 < a < a4, the
expected return of the mining pool 2 e2 is proportional to a.
When 0 < a < a3 or a4 < a < 1, the expected return of the
mining pool 2 e2 is inversely proportional to a, where a3 =
−d̃
k + d
′, a4 = d̃
k + d
′, d̃ =
√
k2d ′2 − kdd ′ − k2dd ′ + kd2.
Proof: Substituting Eq.(9) into Eq.(6), the expected
return of the mining pool 2 is:
e2 = p2 + (1− x)(a− d)
= p2 + [1−
(k + 1)a− d ′ − d
a− d ′
](a− d)
=
−ka2 + (p2 + d + kd)a− p2d ′ − d2
a− d ′
. (15)
Derivating e2:
e′2 =
−ka2 + 2kd ′a− dd ′ − kdd ′ + d2
(a− d ′)2
. (16)
Because (a − d ′)2 > 0 is constant, let −ka2 + 2kd ′a −
dd ′ − kdd ′ + d2 = 0, after calculation, the axis of symmetry
is a = d ′ > 0.
(1) When d
d ′ > 1+k ,−ka2+2kd ′a−dd ′−kdd ′+d2 = 0
has a positive root:
a2 =
kd ′ +
√
k2d ′2 − kdd ′ − k2dd ′ + kd2
k
<
kd ′ +
√
k2d ′2 − k2dd ′ − k2dd ′ + k2d2
k
= d ′ + (d − d ′)
= d < 1. (17)
Therefore, when 0 < a < a2, e′2 > 0, the expected
return of the mining pool 2 e2 is proportional to a. When
a2 < a < 1, e′2 < 0, the expected return of the mining
pool 2 e2 is inversely proportional to a, where a2 = d̃
k + d
′,
d̃ =
√
k2d ′2 − kdd ′ − k2dd ′ + kd2. That’s (i).
(2) When d
d ′ < 1 + k , for −ka2 + 2kd ′a − dd ′ − kdd ′ +
d2 = 0,
1 = (2kd ′)2 + 4k(d2 − dd ′ − kdd ′)
> 4(k2d ′2 + d2 − dd ′ − kdd ′)
= 4[(kd ′ − d)2 + kdd ′ − dd ′]
> 0. (18)
That is, the equation−ka2+ 2kd ′a− dd ′− kdd ′+ d2 = 0
always has two solutions a3, a4, (0 < a3 < a4), and,
a4=

Therefore, when d ′ < 0.5 and a3 < a < a4, e′2 > 0,
the expected return of the mining pool 2 e2 is proportional
to a. When 0 < a < a3 or a4 < a < 1, e′2 < 0,
the expected return of the mining pool 2 e2 is inversely
proportional to a, where a3 = −d̃k + d ′, a4 = d̃
k + d ′, d̃ =
√
k2d ′2 − kdd ′ − k2dd ′ + kd2. That is (ii).
III. ANALYSIS OF MINING POOL GAME MODEL ON
INFILTRATE RATE AND BETRAYAL RATE
A. MODEL INTRODUCTION
This section will analyze the ‘‘d’’ in the previous model in
detail. Suppose there are M mining pools in the system, and
the initial computing power of the mining pool i is pi. Assume
that there are also miners who dig alone without adding the
mining pool in the system, and consider all the separately
miners as a whole, with a computing power of pM+1, and
satisfying 6M+1
i=1 pi = 1, then the total system revenue is
also 1. aij(i, j = 1, 2, . . . ,M , 6M
j=1aij = 1, 0 ≤ aij < 1, 0 <
aii ≤ 1) is the infiltrate rate of mining pool i to mining
pool j, aij · pi represents the infiltration mining power of
mining pool i to mining pool j, and aii is the computing power
ratio reserved by the mining pool i itself. Among them, when
the mining pool infiltrates miners into other mining pools,
although some miners bring the profits obtained by infiltrat-
ing into the mining pool back to the original mining pool,
some of them will also provide FPoW in the submerged pool
to obtain the income but not bring back. That is to say, due to
the betrayal of the miners, the power of the original mining
pool decreases, while the effective power of the submerged
mining pool increases. Let δi(0 ≤ δi < 1) be the betrayal rate
of the submerged power of the mining pool i.
In the mining process, the computing power of the min-
ing pool i can be divided into two parts: effective mining
power and attack power. Then the income of the mining
pool i is the income obtained by effective mining power and
the income obtained by infiltrating into other mining pools
through attack. The average power income of the mining pool
is defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Average Power Income): Let the average
power income of the mining pool i be the ratio of the total
profit of themining pool to the total power of themining pool,
and record it as R.
Then the average power income of the mining pool i at step
t is R̄i(t):

the final return of the pool tends to be stable.
Proof: Set the average power income at the t step game
of the mining pool is:
R̄(t) = (R̄1(t), R̄2(t), . . . , R̄M (t))T . (23)
In each round, the profit obtained from the system by
the effective mining power in the mining pool i is equally
distributed to the actual total computing power of the mining
pool i that includes the computing power infiltrate from other
mining pools. Let P and C be as shown in formula (44)
and (45) as shown at the bottom of the next page.

When i = j, Hij = 0. Because the power of mining pool i
has infiltrated into the mining pool j in the t step, share the
profit at the end of the t − 1 step game in the mining pool j.
Then:
R̄(t) = P+H · R̄(t − 1)+ C. (27)
Because the sum of each row of matrix H is less than 1,
when t tends to infinity, there is:
¯R(t) = P+H · R̄(t − 1)+ C
=

Then when the number of iterations of the game is enough,
the final return of the mining pool is stable.
B. NASH EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
The following takes M = 2 as an example to discuss the
Nash equilibrium of the mining pool under various strategic
options.
1) NO MINING POOL ATTACK
When both mining pools choose N (Not to attack), that is,
aij = aji = 0(i, j = 1, 2), and the profit obtained by mining
pool 1 is p1 · 1 = p1, in the same way, the profit of mining
pool 2 is p2.
2) A MINING POOL ADOPTS THE A(ATTACK) STRATEGY
When mining pool 1 chooses not to attack and mining pool 2
chooses to attack. That is a12 = 0, a21 > 0, δ2 ≥ 0. a21p2δ2
is the betrayal power of mining pool 2. p3 is the total power
of the individual mining in the system. Obviously a33 = 1.
The effective mining power profit of mining pool 1 is:
r1 =
p1 + a21δ2p2
p1 + a22p2 + p3 + a21δ2p2
. (30)
The average power income of mining pool 1 is the effective
mining power income plus the reward obtained from the
system when mining pool 1 chooses not to attack is divided
equally by the mining computing power of mining pool 1 and
mining pool 2. The average power income of mining pool 1
is:
R1 =
r1 + a
p1 + a21p2
. (31)
The effective mining power profit of mining pool 2 is:
r2 =
a22p2
p1 + a22p2 + p3 + a21δ2p2
. (32)
101054 VOLUME 8, 2020
W. Li et al.: Mining Pool Game Model and Nash Equilibrium Analysis for PoW-Based Blockchain Networks
The average power income of mining pool 2 is the effective
mining power income plus the income from the potential
power without betrayal minus the punishment for choosing to
attack mining pool 1, which is equally divided in the power
without betrayal of mining pool 2. The average power income
of mining pool 2 is:
R2 =
r2 + a21p2(1− δ2)R1 − ka
(1− a21δ2)p2
. (33)
Mining pool 2will maximize its own income by controlling
the infiltration rate to mining pool 1, that is, the value of
a21(0 < a21 < 1). Because mining pool 1 does not respond to
the attack of mining pool 2, the value of a21 when the mining
pool 2 maximizes the return value is the stable state of the
system. Thereby:
argmaxa21R2(a21) = a′21. (34)
Substitute the stable value a′21 to get the profit value of
mining pool 1 and mining pool 2.
Similarly, when mining pool 2 chooses not to attack and
mining pool 1 chooses to attack. That is a12 > 0, δ1 ≥
0, a21 = 0, a12p1δ1 is the betrayal power of mining pool 1.
p3 is the total power of the individual mining in the system.
The effective mining power profit of mining pool 1 is:
r1 =
a11p1
a11p1 + p2 + p3 + a12δ1p1
. (35)
The average power income of mining pool 1 is the effective
mining power income plus the income from the potential
power without betrayal minus the punishment for choosing to
attack mining pool 2, which is equally divided in the power
without betrayal of mining pool 1. The average power income
of mining pool 1 is:
R1 =
r1 + a12p1(1− δ1)R2 − ka
(1− a12δ1)p1
. (36)
The effective mining power profit of mining pool 2 is:
r2 =
p2 + a12δ1p1
a11p1 + p2 + p3 + a12δ1p1
. (37)
The average power income of mining pool 2 is the effective
mining power income plus the reward obtained from the
system when mining pool 2 chooses not to attack is divided
equally by the mining computing power of mining pool 1 and
mining pool 2. The average power income of mining pool 2
is:
R2 =
r2 + a
p2 + a12p1
. (38)
Similarly, Mining pool 1 will maximize its own income
by controlling the infiltration rate to mining pool 2, that is,
the value of a12(0 < a12 < 1). Because mining pool 2 does
not respond to the attack of mining pool 1, the value of a12
when the mining pool 1 maximizes the return value is the
stable state of the system. Thereby:
argmaxa12R1(a12) = a′12. (39)
Substitute the stable value a′12 to get the profit value of
mining pool 1 and mining pool 2.
3) TWO MINING POOL ATTACKS
When both mining pool 1 and mining pool 2 choose to attack,
that is, a12 > 0, δ1 ≥ 0, a21 > 0, δ2 ≥ 0.
The effective mining power profit of mining pool 1 is:
r1 =
a11p1 + a21δ2p2
a11p1 + a22p2 + p3 + a12δ1p1 + a21δ2p2
. (40)
The average power income of mining pool 1 is the effective
mining power income plus the income from the potential
power without betrayal minus the punishment for choosing to
attack mining pool 2, which is equally divided in the actual
total power of mining pool 1 and the power infiltrated from
mining pool 2. In stable state, the average power income of
mining pool 1 is:
R1 =
r1 + a12p1(1− δ1)R2 − ka
(1− a12δ1)p1 + a21p2
. (41)
Similarly, the effective mining power profits of mining
pool 2 is:
r2 =
a22p2 + a12δ1p1
a11p1 + a22p2 + p3 + a12δ1p1 + a21δ2p2

W. Li et al.: Mining Pool Game Model and Nash Equilibrium Analysis for PoW-Based Blockchain Networks
The average power income of mining pool 2 is the effective
mining power income plus the income from the potential
power without betrayal minus the punishment for choosing to
attack mining pool 1, which is equally divided in the actual
total power of mining pool 2 and the power infiltrated from
mining pool 1. In stable state, the average power income of
mining pool 2 is:
R2 =
r2 + a21p2(1− δ2)R1 − ka
(1− a21δ2)p2 + a12p1
. (43)
In order to solve the values of R1 and R2 in the stable state,
the simultaneous expression of (41)(43) can be used to obtain
the expression of average power income related to a12 and
a21 (see formula (46) and (47) as shown at the bottom of the
previous page).
In each round of game, the mining pool will optimize its
own revenue by controlling its own infiltration rate. When
both mining pool 1 and mining pool 2 will not change their
infiltration rate to increase revenue, this stable state will reach
the Nash equilibrium. That is, for any pair of a′12 and a′21,
there are: {
argmaxa12R1(a12, a
′
21) = a′12;
argmaxa21R2(a
′
12, a21) = a′21.
(48)
For function Ri, there are
∂2Ri
∂2 ai
< 0. Therefore, in the Nash
equilibrium state, the values of a12 and a21 satisfy:
∂R1(a12, a21)
∂a12
= 0;
∂R2(a12, a21)
∂a21
= 0.
(49)
Corollary 3: When δ1 = δ2 = 0, that is, the miners sent
by the mining pool to infiltrate into the other mining pools
are loyal miners. The average power income of the two pools
are:
R1(a12, a21) =
r1p2 + (r1 + r2)a12p1
p1p2 + a12p21 + a21p
2
2
, (50)
R2(a12, a21) =
r2p1 + (r1 + r2)a21p2
p1p2 + a12p21 + a21p
2
2
. (51)
Similarly, in each round of game, the mining pool will
optimize its own revenue by controlling its own infiltration
rate. When both mining pool 1 and mining pool 2 will not
change their infiltration rate to increase revenue, this stable
state will reach the Nash equilibrium. That is, for any pair of
a′12 and a
′
21, there are:{
argmaxa12R1(a12, a
′
21) = a′12;
argmaxa21R2(a
′
12, a21) = a′21.
(52)
Therefore, in the Nash equilibrium state, the values of a12
and a21 satisfy: 
∂R1(a12, a21)
∂a12
= 0;
∂R2(a12, a21)
∂a21
= 0.

IV. SIMULATION
Through numerical simulation, this section explores the influ-
ence of the mining pool’s computing power, the ratio of the
power to be infiltrated, and the betrayed rate of dispatched
miners on the mining pool’s infiltration rate selection and
income.
FIGURE 2. When δ1 = 0.2, the average power incomes of pool 1 in the
case of the optimum infiltration.
We first consider the situation of one mining pool attack,
assuming that mining pool 1 chooses the attack strategy and
mining pool 2 chooses not to attack. In Fig.2-4, the betrayal
rate of the miners dispatched by mining pool 1 is set to δ1 =
0.2, while Fig.5-7 and Fig.8-10 are δ1 = 0.5 and δ1 = 0.8.
These figures show the value of the infiltrate rate a12 at the
Nash equilibrium in the case of different p1 and p2, and the
average power incomes of pool 1 and pool 2 in the case of the
optimum infiltration. The horizontal and vertical coordinates
in the figure represent the computing power of mining pool 1
p1 and the computing power ofmining pool 2 p2, and different
colors in the figure represent different target values.
By comparing the three sets of figures in Fig.2-10, we find
that all have similar changes. Fig.2, Fig.5 and Fig.8 are the
changes of the values of the infiltrate rate a12 at theNash equi-
librium in the case of different p1 and p2. It is found through
observation that when the computing power of mining pool 2
gradually decreases, the infiltrate rate a12 of mining pool 1
also gradually decreases. When the total mining power of

case of the optimum infiltration.
FIGURE 4. When δ1 = 0.5, the value of the infiltrate rate a12 at the Nash
equilibrium in the case of different p1 and p2.
FIGURE 5. When δ1 = 0.5, the average power incomes of pool 1 in the

pool 1 and pool 2 is close to 1, the infiltrate rate of pool 1
is larger. When the value of the miner betrayal rate δ1 of the
mining pool 1 increases, the value of the infiltrate rate a12 of
mining pool 1 also gradually increases. Fig.3, Fig.6 and Fig.9
are the average power incomes of pool 1 in the case of the
optimum infiltration. It has been observed that the profit
gained by mining pool 1 when choosing an attack strategy
is higher than that when it chooses not to attack, that is,
choosing an attack strategy can increase its own revenue.
FIGURE 6. When δ1 = 0.5, the average power incomes of pool 2 in the
case of the optimum infiltration.
FIGURE 7. When δ1 = 0.8, the value of the infiltrate rate a12 at the Nash
equilibrium in the case of different p1 and p2.
FIGURE 8. When δ1 = 0.8, the average power incomes of pool 1 in the
case of the optimum infiltration.
When the total mining power of pool 1 and pool 2 is close
to 1, the average power incomes R1 of pool 1 is larger. When
the value of the miner betrayal rate δ1 of mining pool 1
increases, the average power incomes of mining pool 1 R1
gradually decreases. It means that the more miners betrayed,
the more adverse the impact on the profit of mining pool 1.
Fig.4, Fig.7 and Fig.10 are the average power incomes of
pool 2 in the case of the optimum infiltration. It has been
observed that the average power incomes of mining pool 2

case of the optimum infiltration.
FIGURE 10. When the two mining pools attack each other and δ1 takes

is generally lower than that of mining pool 1. This shows
that when the opponent’s mining pool chooses not to attack
the strategy, the attack can increase its own revenue and
effectively reduce the revenue of the opposing mining pool.
When the total mining power of pool 1 and pool 2 is close to 1,
the average power incomes R2 of pool 2 is larger. When the
value of the miner betrayal rate δ1 of mining pool 1 increases,
although the change trend of the average power income of

mining pool 2 is not too obvious, but it also has a slight
increase. The results show that the more miners betrayed in
mining pool 1, the more effect it will have on the income of
mining pool 2. But on the whole, whenmining pool 1 chooses
to attack, its income is still higher than that of mining pool 2.
Next, we consider the situation where two mining pools
attack each other. Fig.11-13 are the values of a12 at the Nash
equilibrium under the different p1 and p2 when δ1 is taken as

0.2, 0.5, 0.8 respectively. It is found through observation that
when the total mining power of pool 1 and pool 2 is close to 1,
the average power incomes R1 of pool 1 is larger. And as δ1
increases, the value of a12 gradually increases. Fig.14-16 are
the changes of a12 in Nash equilibrium under different cases
of A1 when δ1 is taken as 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 respectively. Because
the computing power of the mining pool varies, the same
ratio of the power to be infiltrated A1 corresponds to multiple
optimal infiltrate rates a12. Through observation we found
that as the A1 increases, the infiltrate rates a12 of mining
pool 1 gradually decreases. On the whole, with the increase of
the betrayal rate δ1, the threshold of the ratio of the power to
be infiltrated A1 decreases gradually when the infiltrate rates
a12 decreases to 0. And the infiltrate rates a12 decreases with
the increase of the betrayal rate δ1 under the same ratio of the
power to be infiltrated A1.
V. CONCLUSION
For existing papers, a mining pool game model based on the
PoW consensus mechanism from the perspective of adding
rewards and punishments to the blockchain system is builded
firstly in this paper. And its pure strategy Nash equilibrium
and mixed strategy Nash equilibrium are analyzed. Then the
block withholding attacks between mining pools are consid-
ered. That is, the infiltrate rate and betrayal rate of the mining
pool are considered, related models are builded, the Nash
equilibrium and the value of infiltrate rate under the Nash
equilibrium are analyzed. This is also a new discussion that
has not appeared in other papers. Finally, the influence of
the mining pool’s computing power, the ratio of the power to
be infiltrated, and the betrayed rate of dispatched miners on
the mining pool’s infiltration rate selection and income are
explored by numerical simulation. Nowadays, the upsurge of
blockchain technology has swept across all walks of life and
has become one of the hottest and most noticed information
technologies of the moment. The PoW consensus mechanism
has always played a very important role in blockchain tech-
nology. The phenomenon of mutual attack of mining pools
in blockchain technology has brought a very adverse impact
on the application of blockchain technology. This article
analyzes the Nash equilibrium from the perspective of adding
reward and punishment mechanisms to the blockchain system
and block withholding attacks between mining pools, and
discusses the value of the infiltrate rate under the maximum
profit of themining pool. It has a certain effect on the research
of blockchain technology. However, blockchain technology
integrates a variety of complex computer technologies such
as encryption algorithms, P2P file transfers, and consensus
mechanisms. The research content of this article is relatively
single. In the future, game theory will continue to be more
deeply integrated with the problems existing in blockchain
technology. Based on the model studied in this paper, we will
continue to study the mining dilemma in depth, hoping to
provide more effective help in improving the promotion of
blockchain technology.
