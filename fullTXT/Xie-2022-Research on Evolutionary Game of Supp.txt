ABSTRACT
In view of the problems of unclear production status caused by
information asymmetry in supply chain manufacturing, this pa-
per uses the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and
non-tampering of information of blockchain technology to build a
supplier andmanufacturing system based on blockchain technology.
Manufacturers create an evolutionary game model of information
sharing, and analyze the influencing factors of each participant’s
adoption of information sharing strategies in the blockchain system.
The results show that the degree of information sharing, sharing
favorable information, collaboration index and incentive index have
a positive impact on information sharing strategies, while infor-
mation sharing risks, information sharing costs, and opportunity
benefits have a negative impact. Finally, it provides countermea-
sures to promote information sharing for supply chain participants
to improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain.

1 INTRODUCTION
At present, China has become the world’s largest manufacturing
country. However, compared with manufacturing powers such as
Germany, China’s manufacturing industry still has problems such
as low information sharing efficiency, information barriers, infor-
mation asymmetry, and data islands. Information is an important

decision-making for supply chain enterprises. It is also an impor-
tant factor affecting the efficiency of the supply chain. Modern
manufacturing urgently needs to achieve breakthroughs in man-
agement and operational efficiency, in order to achieve an efficient
and beneficial information sharing model. The rapid development
of digital technology has added strong vitality to more and more
traditional industries and provided opportunities for their further
advance. The emergence of digital technologies such as the Inter-
net of Things, cloud computing, and blockchain has helped supply
chain management enter the fast lane of development [1]. "The
14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development
of the People’s Republic of China and the Outline of Vision 2035"
emphasizes that blockchain technology is one of the seven key in-
dustries of the digital economy, which means that the government
attaches great importance to blockchain technology. The use of
blockchain technology information such as non-tampering, verifi-
able traceability and other characteristics [2] can increase the trust
between the participants in the supply chain, eliminate informa-
tion barriers, reduce information asymmetry and other problems
in supply chain management, and improve the overall performance
of the supply chain [3].
At present, scholars have carried out research on supply chain
information sharing. Guan Zili and Zhang Xumei (2019) studied
the influence of retailers’ information sharing level, manufacturer’s
service efficiency and consumer service sensitivity on service value
and information sharing value by constructing a dynamic game
model under incomplete information. The results show that demand
Information sharing can effectively enhance the service value of the
entire supply chain [4]. Zhou Xianxian and Zhao Hongxia (2019)
used the system dynamics method to build the logistics service
supply chain benchmark model and information sharing model,
and studied the coordination effect of information sharing on the
bullwhip effect of the logistics service supply chain. The results
showed that the logistics service under the information sharing
model The bullwhip effect in the supply chain has been effectively
alleviated [5].
With the development of digital technology, blockchain tech-
nology is gradually integrated with the field of supply chain man-
agement. Yang Huiqin and Sun Lei (2018) used the decentralized
high-trust distributed database ledger technology and traceabil-
ity, information can not be tampered and other characteristics of
blockchain technology to establish a supply chain information
platform with blockchain technology as the core, thus Realize the
supply chain ecosystem of mutual trust and win-win [6]. Cao Yang
and Su Zhenning (2019) tried to introduce blockchain technology
into the construction supply chain, and built a construction supply
chain information sharing management blockchain to promote the
information sharing of the participants of various projects in the

supply chain and improve the performance of the supply chain
[7]. Li Xiaoping and Wang Yayun (2019) used the consensus trust,
information traceability, smart contracts and other characteristics
of blockchain technology to build a logistics service supply chain
information platform based on blockchain technology to ensure the
timeliness and accuracy of information communication between
upstream and downstream enterprises Sex [8].
At present, there are relatively few researches on the integration
of blockchain technology and supply chain manufacturing informa-
tion sharing. On the existing research, most of them are qualitative
researches, and the application research of platform construction
with blockchain technology as the core is mainly used. From the
perspective of blockchain technology, the game relationship of in-
formation sharing among the participants in the supply chain is
studied. This paper builds a supply chain information sharing game
model driven by blockchain technology, discusses the impact of
information sharing on suppliers and manufacturers and the overall
efficiency of the supply chain when each main body of the supply
chain participates in the blockchain system, and then puts forward
corresponding improvement suggestions .
2 FEATURES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
Blockchain is a distributed public ledger whose information cannot
be tampered with, cannot be forged, can be stored safely and sim-
ply, has a sequential logic, and is verifiable within the system. The
ledger protects the data chain with a specific data structure using a
cryptographic encryption algorithm according to the time sequence.
Compared with traditional ledgers, this technology does not allow
a single node to complete accounting, and must be completed by
multiple nodes. Therefore, it can effectively prevent nodes from
being invaded and controlled or fake accounting, making it out-
standing in decentralization and trustworthiness. This advantage
allows all participants in the supply chain to share information
transparently, avoiding the data control behavior of any single en-
tity, and beneficial information is efficiently shared among supply
chain participants in a pre-defined, immutable, and synchronous
manner.
(1) Decentralization
Decentralization refers to the integration of data recording and
accounting on the blockchain. The entire supply chain does not rely
on a central node, and all nodes have equal rights and obligations.
Even if there are individual bad nodes, the strong robustness of the
blockchain can still be achieved. To maintain the smooth operation
of the supply chain, this technology can realize the trust between the
various participants in the decentralized center with mathematical
algorithms as the core, and effectively solve the problems of low
data and storage instability that are common in centralized systems
[9].
(2) Openness
Except for the specific secret information of each node of the
blockchain encrypted by the private key, any other node enterprise
can openly access the non-encrypted accounting information of the
blockchain through an open interface, and the entire blockchain
information is highly transparent.
(3) Information cannot be tampered with
The distributed technology of the blockchain ensures that all
node members participate in data recording and information stor-
age through consensus and signature authentication of the par-
ticipants. The nodes that tamper with the records can restore the
tampered data before half of them, and individual bad nodes cannot
control the entire blockchain. The data system is controlled, and
the system security is high. It can be seen that the establishment of
the blockchain can provide effective solutions to problems such as
information asymmetry, information barriers, and poor environ-
ment, effectively eliminate the occurrence of data tampering, and
enhance trust and consensus between nodes. At the same time, due
to the existence of the consensus mechanism, each node is required
to participate in the authentication, which effectively ensures the
security and stability of the entire blockchain system.
(4) Traceability
Data authentication and storage in time series ensures that the
information in the blockchain database cannot be forged and tam-
pered with. Because there is queryable execution logic between
blocks, all real-time records can be traced through the time stamp
bound to the blockchain.
(5) Safe and reliable
The encryption algorithm of blockchain guarantees the privacy
of system members to a certain extent. If participants apply for
access to information, they must obtain query permission. At the
same time, encryption and consensus mechanisms such as knowl-
edge proof and dynamic encryption have a protective effect against
malicious attacks from the outside world. This enhances the se-
curity and reliability of the blockchain system and protects the
privacy of participants [10].
3 EVOLUTIONARY GAME MODEL
For manufacturers, supplier information, enterprise production sta-
tus, etc. are the core information, and there is a tendency to not
share information. This paper simulates and constructs an evolu-
tionary game with suppliers and manufacturers as the main body,
and analyzes the state of the two participating subjects. Information
Sharing Policy. The research assumes that the players of the game
are not completely rational [13], and the decision-making choice
is affected by factors such as environment, information and intelli-
gence, and technical level. Therefore, both parties involved need to
go through a long game to reach an evolutionary stable state and
determine the final information sharing strategy. By referring to
the previous research results, this paper establishes an evolution-
ary game model of supply chain manufacturing information from
the aspects of information sharing degree [11], information shar-
ing cost [12], beneficial information sharing [13] and information
sharing risks [14].
3.1 Basic Assumptions
In order to study the degree of information sharing among supply
chain participants, this paper sets the following assumptions:
Hypothesis 1: Supplier A and Manufacturer B are both bounded
rational supply chain game subjects. In the game, there is infor-
mation asymmetry among the participants in the supply chain.
There are two decisions in the game, "information sharing" and
"information not sharing".
80

Hypothesis 2: The probability of supplier A adopting the informa-
tion sharing strategy is x (0≤x≤1), and the probability of adopting
a non-information sharing strategy is (1-x); the probability of man-
ufacturer B adopting an information sharing strategy is y (0≤y≤ 1),
the probability of adopting the information non-sharing strategy is
(1-y).
Hypothesis 3: In the case of information asymmetry, whether
the main body of the supply chain game adopts the information
sharing strategy depends on whether the information sharing strat-
egy achieves better benefits. Therefore, assuming that the normal
income of supplier A is R1, and the normal income of manufac-
turer B is R2, if supplier A adopts an information sharing strategy,
manufacturer B obtains additional income from the shared informa-
tion as W1; Information sharing strategy, then supplier A obtains
additional income from the shared information as W2.
Hypothesis 4: In the blockchain system, the more interactive
activities among the participating entities, the deeper the infor-
mation sharing, and the level of trust between the supply chain
game entities represents the amount of real information sharing.
The deeper the degree of trust between the participants, the greater
the amount of real information shared, and the more benefits the
participants who receive the information will receive. In this paper,
L1 represents the information sharing degree of supplier A, and L2
represents the information sharing degree of manufacturer B.
Hypothesis 5: The information shared among supply chain game
subjects is not necessarily true, reliable and beneficial initial in-
formation, including invalid information or harmful information.
Sharing real, reliable and beneficial information is the basis for
obtaining additional benefits of information. Therefore, this paper
uses Q1 and Q2 to represent that supplier A and manufacturer B
follow the rules of the blockchain system and share real, reliable
and beneficial information.
Hypothesis 6: Information sharing will generate a certain sharing
cost for each supply chain game subject. Therefore, this paper uses
C1 and C2 to represent the information sharing cost after supplier
A and manufacturer B participate in the blockchain system.
Hypothesis 7: In order to promote a virtuous cycle of information
sharing among supply chain game subjects, the blockchain system
will provide certain material rewards for participants who actively
share effective information. At the same time, the information
sharing of one party will bring additional benefits to the other
party and establish a good corporate image. Promote the deepening
of mutual trust, thereby promoting more information sharing. The
more information is shared, the greater the incentive index. In this
paper, m is used to represent the incentive index of information
sharing.
Hypothesis 8: Each supply chain game subject has a synergistic
effect in the interactive activities. If both sides of the game adopt
an information sharing strategy, the cooperation efficiency will be
improved on the basis of deepening the mutual trust, and more
benefits will be obtained. Therefore, this paper uses n (n > 1) to
represent the synergy index between game subjects.
Hypothesis 9: The game subject may face potential risk costs
such as information leakage and negotiation red line after adopting
the information sharing strategy. If the income continues to decline
below the potential risk opportunity cost, the participants tend to
adopt the information non-sharing strategy to avoid possible risks.
Therefore, this paper uses f to represent the risk cost of adopting
an information sharing strategy.
(1)When both supplier A and manufacturer B choose the infor-
mation sharing strategy,
Supplier A’s revenue is R1 + nL1Q1 + mL1 − C1 − fL1,
The gain for manufacturer B is R2 + nL2Q2 + mL2 − C2 − fL2.
(2) When supplier A adopts an information sharing strategy and
manufacturer B adopts an information non-sharing strategy,
Supplier A’s revenue is R1 + mL1 − C1 − fL1,
Manufacturer B’s payoff is R2 + W2Q1L1.
(3) When supplier A adopts a policy of not sharing information
and manufacturer B adopts a policy of sharing information,
Supplier A’s revenue is R1 + W1Q2L2,
The gain for manufacturer B is R2 + mL2 − C2 − fL2.
(4)Both supplier A and manufacturer B believe that the infor-
mation sharing strategy will have negative effects, so they both
have normal benefits when they adopt the information non-sharing
strategy.
At this time, the profits of supplier A and manufacturer B are R1
and R2.
Therefore, from the above assumptions, the game profit matrix of
the supply chain participants’ manufacturing information sharing
can be obtained, as shown in Table 1.
3.2 Model building and strategy analysis
3.2.1 Supplier A’s Information Sharing Model Construction and
Strategy Selection Analysis. The expected benefits of supplier A
adopting the information sharing strategy are:
𝑈1 = y (𝑅1 + n𝐿1𝑄1 +𝑚𝐿1 −𝐶1 − 𝑓 𝐿1)+(1 − y) (𝑅1 + m𝐿1 −𝐶1 − 𝑓 𝐿1)
The expected benefit of supplier A when adopting a non-sharing
strategy is:
𝑈2 = y (𝑅1 + W1𝑄2𝐿2) + (1 − y) 𝑅1
The average expected benefit of Supplier A is:
𝑈 = 𝑥𝑈1 + (1 − 𝑥)𝑈2
The replication dynamic equation of supplier A adopting the
information sharing strategy is
F (𝑥) = 𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡
= 𝑥
(
𝑈1 −𝑈
)
In summary:
F (𝑥) = 𝑥 (1 − 𝑥) {𝑦 [𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n − 1)] +𝑚𝐿1 −𝐶1 − 𝑓 𝐿1}
According to the equilibrium point analysis of the replication dy-
namic equation, when 𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡
= 0, 𝑥∗1 = 0, 𝑥∗2 = 1, 𝑦∗ = 𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) .
It can be known from the evolutionary stability strategy that when
𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡
= 0 and 𝐹 ′ (𝑥) < 0, it is in an evolutionary stable state.
Therefore, derivation can be obtained: 𝐹 ′ (𝑥) =
(1 − 2𝑥){𝑦 [𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n − 1)] +𝑚𝐿1 −𝐶1 − 𝑓 𝐿1}
When y = 𝑦∗ = 𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) ,
𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡
= 0, which is the final solution
with stable evolution.
When y ≠ 𝑦∗ =
𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) , this paper is divided into the
following three cases for discussion:
(1) When 𝐶1 + 𝑓 𝐿1 − 𝑚𝐿1 > 𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n − 1), there is any
𝑦 (0 ≤ 𝑦 ≤ 1), all 𝐹 ′ (𝑥∗ = 0) < 0, at this time, 𝑥∗1 = 0 is a stable

evolution state, and supplier A adopts a stable evolution strategy
of not sharing information.
(2) When 𝐶1 + 𝑓 𝐿1 − 𝑚𝐿1 < 𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n − 1), y < 𝑦∗ =
𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) , 𝐹
′ (𝑥∗ = 0) < 0, 𝐹 ′ (𝑥∗ = 0) > 0, at this time, 𝑥∗1 = 0
is a stable evolution state, and supplier A adopts a stable evolution
strategy of not sharing information.
(3) When 𝐶1 + 𝑓 𝐿1 − 𝑚𝐿1 < 𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n − 1), y > 𝑦∗ =
𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) , 𝐹
′ (𝑥∗ = 0) > 0, 𝐹 ′ (𝑥∗ = 0) < 0, at this time, 𝑥∗2 = 1,
Supplier A will adopt an information sharing strategy, The stable
state of the strategy evolution is affected by the size of 𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) ,
𝑦∗ =
𝐶1+𝑓 𝐿1−𝑚𝐿1
𝑊1𝑄2𝐿2 (n−1) The larger it is, the more Supplier A tends to
adopt a non-sharing strategy.
3.2.2 Manufacturer B’s Information Sharing Model Construction
and Strategy Selection Analysis. The expected benefit of manufac-
turer B when adopting the information sharing strategy is:
𝑉1 = 𝑥 (𝑅2 + n𝐿2𝑄2 +𝑚𝐿2 −𝐶2 − 𝑓 𝐿2)+(1 − 𝑥) (𝑅2 + m𝐿2 −𝐶2 − 𝑓 𝐿2)
Expected benefits when manufacturer B chooses a non-sharing
strategy:
𝑉2 = 𝑥 (𝑅2 + W2𝑄1𝐿1) + (1 − 𝑥) 𝑅2
The average expected return for manufacturer B is:
𝑉 = 𝑦𝑉1 + (1 − 𝑦)𝑉2
The replication dynamic equation for manufacturer B to adopt
the information sharing strategy is
F (𝑦) = 𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑡
= 𝑦
(
𝑉1 −𝑉
)
In summary:
F (𝑦) = 𝑦 (1 − 𝑦) {𝑥 [W2𝑄1𝐿1 (𝑛 − 1)] +𝑚𝐿2 −𝐶2 − 𝑓 𝐿2}
According to the equilibrium point analysis of the replication dy-
namic equation, when 𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑡
= 0, 𝑦∗1 = 0, 𝑦∗2 = 1, 𝑥∗ = 𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) .
It can be known from the evolutionary stability strategy that when
𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑡
= 0 and 𝐹 ′ (𝑥) < 0, it is in an evolutionary stable state.
Therefore, the derivative can be obtained:
𝐹 ′ (𝑦) = (1 − 2𝑦) {𝑥 [𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n − 1)] +𝑚𝐿2 −𝐶2 − 𝑓 𝐿2}
When 𝑥 = 𝑥∗ =
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) ,
𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑡
= 0, and the three solutions
are all evolutionary stable final solutions.
When 𝑥 ≠ 𝑥∗ =
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) , this paper is divided into the
following three cases for discussion:
(1)When 𝐶2 + 𝑓 𝐿2 − 𝑚𝐿2 > 𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n − 1), there is
any 𝑥 (0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1), and 𝐹 ′ (𝑦∗ = 0) < 0, at this time, 𝑦∗1 = 0 is a sta-
ble evolution state, and manufacturer B adopts a non-information
sharing strategy as a stable evolution strategy.
(2)When 𝐶2 + 𝑓 𝐿2 − 𝑚𝐿2 < 𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n − 1), 𝑥 < 𝑥∗ =
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) , 𝐹
′ (𝑦∗ = 0) < 0, 𝐹 ′ (𝑦∗ = 0) > 0, at this time, 𝑦∗1 = 0
is the stable evolution state, and the manufacturer B adopts the
non-information sharing as the stable evolution strategy.
(3)When 𝐶2 + 𝑓 𝐿2 − 𝑚𝐿2 < 𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n − 1), 𝑥 > 𝑥∗ =
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) , 𝐹
′ (𝑦∗ = 0) > 0, 𝐹 ′ (𝑦∗ = 0) < 0, at this time, 𝑦∗2 = 1,
manufacturer B will adopt an information sharing strategy, the
stable state of the strategy evolution is affected by the size of
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) , 𝑥
∗ =
𝐶2+𝑓 𝐿2−𝑚𝐿2
𝑊2𝑄1𝐿1 (n−1) The larger it is, the more man-
ufacturer B tends to adopt a non-sharing strategy.
3.3 Evolutionary Stability Analysis
(1) When C1 + fL1 − mL1 > W1Q2L2 (n − 1), C2 + fL2 − mL2 >
W2Q1L1 (n − 1), at this time, suppliers and manufacturers adopt
information sharing strategies to bring incentives The benefits are
far from enough to cover the costs and risks taken, so both the
manufacturer and the supplier’s evolutionary stabilization strategy
will take information-no-sharing decisions.
(2) When C1 + fL1 − mL1 > W1Q2L2 (n − 1), C2 + fL2 − mL2 <
W2Q1L1 (n − 1), the incentive income brought by the supplier’s
information sharing strategy is far from enough to make up for
it Costs and risks borne, manufacturers will gain benefits from
sharing some necessary information with suppliers more than the
costs and risks borne by information sharing. Therefore, stable
evolution strategy of suppliers is the strategy of non-sharing of
information, and the evolution of manufacturers is stable. The
policy is an information sharing policy.
(3) When C1 + fL1 − mL1 < W1Q2L2 (n − 1), C2 + fL2 − mL2 >
W2Q1L1 (n − 1), incentive benefits brought by manufacturers’ in-
formation sharing strategies are far from enough to cover costs
and risks borne , the benefits that suppliers get from providing
some of the necessary information to manufacturers outweigh the
costs and risks of information sharing. Therefore, the supplier’s
stable evolution strategy is an information sharing strategy, and
the manufacturer’s evolutionary stable strategy is an information
non-sharing strategy.
However, the continuous information sharing of one party will
increase the opportunistic behavior of the other party, and its own
risks will continue to increase. Both parties in the game unilater-
ally take trust decisions, and information sharing will eventually
stabilize when neither party adopts an information sharing strategy.

(4) When C1 + fL1 − mL1 < W1Q2L2 (n − 1), C2 + fL2 − mL2 <
W2Q1L1 (n − 1), at this time, the benefits obtained by suppliers and
manufacturers adopting an information sharing strategy outweigh
the costs and risks borne by information sharing. At the same time,
if both parties involved adopt the information non-sharing strategy,
the benefits obtained are not necessarily less than the benefits
obtained by adopting information sharing. Therefore, both parties
in the game tend to choose the information sharing strategy or
both choose the information non-sharing strategy.
4 CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION
Increasing the degree of information sharing, sharing favorable in-
formation, collaboration index and incentive index can all improve
the probability of participants adopting information sharing strate-
gies. It can be seen that in the long-term dynamic evolutionary
process, the above factors are beneficial to both sides of the game
to take information sharing decisions. The increase of information
sharing risk, information sharing cost and opportunity benefit will
have a negative impact on the choice of information sharing strat-
egy, so that both sides of the game tend to adopt the strategy of
not sharing information. Therefore, measures should be taken to
reduce the negative impact of the above factors.
Introduce the trust reward mechanism and the untrustworthy
punishment system into the blockchain system, encourage coopera-
tion and sharing among node enterprises, clarify the responsibilities
and consequences, and maintain the elimination mechanism for
enterprises that are unwilling to cooperate. In addition, special
incentives are set up to provide incentives to node companies that
choose a trust sharing strategy for a long time, so as to ensure that
more node companies adopt information sharing strategies.
Use the encryption algorithm technology of blockchain to ensure
the integrity and security of information and establish a safe and
transparent information system to reduce the risk of enterprise
information leakage. Corresponding punishment will be given for
malicious information leakage. Those with serious circumstances
can exclude the blockchain system, maintain the elimination mech-
anism, ensure the information security of the blockchain system
to the greatest extent, and reduce the risk factor. In addition, the
cost of information sharing is reduced, the procedures and links for
unnecessary information sharing are reduced, the communication
channels between participating entities are unblocked, and the cost
of information sharing is saved. In addition, a sound supervision
system should be established in the blockchain system to prevent
"free-rider" behavior and ensure the trust atmosphere of the entire
blockchain system.
