Abstract. In this paper, we examine cryptocurrencies as a potentially disrup-
tive sort of payment method. Due to its relative importance, we focus in par-
ticular on Bitcoin. Through an inductive, exploratory interview approach with
13 individuals in three distinct groups, the determinants usability, usefulness,
and subjective norm that could make Bitcoin a game-changer are explored. The
results reveal that most stakeholders consider perceived ease of use still rather
low, with perceived usefulness varying according to the user group. The notion
of Bitcoin as having much future potential as a payment method is confirmed
across all interviewees. Interestingly, the underlying concept of a blockchain is
also seen as a potential revolutionary way to create a more just society based on
open platforms and open data. However, the reasons of why Bitcoin is actually a
disruption to existing solutions varies widely.

1 Introduction
The Internet and the massive growth of e-commerce have bred various new online
payment and money transaction methods in the last several years. This is being spurred
by a new hype in ‘fin-tech’ startups in the global technology hubs. Even though famous
quotes like “banking is necessary, banks are not” made by former Wells Fargo CEO
Richard Kovacevich [1] are already quite dated, technology finally seems ready to
enable real innovations in this sector. A new generation of founders is motivated to
revolutionize how the financial industry works, what society thinks about the concept
of money, and how the future of monetary transactions will look.
As the number of alternative payment types has grown, traditional means of online
payment, like credit cards, are on the downgrade as they are fighting with competition
that offers higher user-friendliness, more security, and lower costs [2, 3]. As Koley [4]
reports, even though the virtual duopoly of Visa and MasterCard is still experiencing
healthy growth rates (9.5 % and 9.6 %, respectively) and remains the preferred method
for (offline) point-of-sale (POS) transactions, firms like JCB and UnionPay outperform

them by far (growing 20.7 % and 44.8 %, respectively). This provides hints of altered
consumer behavior including a perceived viable alternative to credit cards and a
gradual change in the payment market [5]. PayPal, which was originally meant for
facilitating eBay transactions, is now one of the major players in online payment [6].
Additionally, new firms that are home to completely different industries than banking,
like Google and Apple, offer solutions that have already gained a remarkable level of
user acceptance and dissemination among society and businesses alike [7, 8]. However,
all of these solutions remain tied in one way or another to the user’s regular bank
account and a traditional notion of the concept money.
Another, potentially far more disruptive innovation in this field applies to crypto-
currencies [9]. Advocates of these new means of payment claim various advantages,
like a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer transaction system, elimination of chargeback
risks, lower associated transaction costs, increased level of security, greater ease of use,
and full support for mobile devices [10, 11]. Of the several hundred different crypto-
currencies,1 Bitcoin is the most well-known, most discussed, and most widely traded
one with a market capitalization of more than three bn USD (see Fig. 1 for the top ten
cryptocurrencies as of May 15, 2015). Hence, in this paper we focus on Bitcoin and use
‘Bitcoin’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ somewhat interchangeably.
The body of scientific research in the field of cryptocurrencies is still very manageable
(see Related Work section below). One stream that especially lacks work is the
question of user adoption and the relevant drivers of it (e.g., [12, 13]). Academic
research has mostly neglected the user perspective, which connects the technological
infrastructure with the established economies [12]. In particular, the decisive impact on
society as a whole that users expect of these blockchain technologies has not been
gathered. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any empirical research
applying detailed interviews to gain ‘rich knowledge’ about these kinds of questions.
With this paper, we contribute to this under-researched turf by means of an exploratory,
qualitative approach using 13 semi-structured interviews.

In particular, the study aims to examine the following research questions:
1. What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin as compared to
other forms of (electronic) payment?
2. What are the drivers and barriers Bitcoin users, merchants, and experts see in the
adoption of Bitcoin?
3. How do users, merchants, and experts evaluate the future potential of Bitcoin as a
serious means of currency, unit of account, asset, and disruption for society?
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: After giving an overview of
the applicable literature on cryptocurrencies and present payment options, the applied
research methodology is presented. In the following part, the interview findings are
discussed. The paper closes with a conclusion section and also discusses contributions,
limitations, and future avenues to advance this research area.
The aim is to explore Bitcoin’s main advantages and disadvantages compared to
current payment types, to identify the drivers and barriers of Bitcoin’s adoption, and to
evaluate its future potential as seen by the three distinct groups of (pure) users, mer-
chants, and experts.
2 Related Work
In order to find empirical works on Bitcoin adoption and usage, we conducted a
thorough literature search following the frameworks of vom Brocke et al., Levy and
Ellis, and Webster and Watson [14–16]. Search terms were ‘Bitcoin’, ‘crypto AND
currency[ies]’, and ‘cryptocurrency[-ies]’. As suggested by Chen et al. [17], we sear-
ched the databases Web of Science, EBSCO Business Source Complete, IEEE Xplore,
ScienceDirect, and the ACM Digital Library. To be as exhaustive as possible, the
important IS conferences ICIS, ECIS, HICSS, PACIS, and AMCIS were also explored
with the identical keywords. As the ‘mother paper’ of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto
(most likely a group pseudonym) was just released in 2008 [18], we did not limit the
search timeframe. In fact, it was not until 2011 that research papers about cryptocur-
rencies were published in journals and from conferences. From 2013, larger
peer-reviewed journals have been picking up the topic and have started to accept papers
more frequently.
The results, combined with the work of Scott [19] and Böhme et al. [20], revealed
four main streams of research in regard to Bitcoin, addressing three different layers:
• Technical: This stream includes technical details about the ‘back-end’ of crypto-
currency, like cryptography, mathematical models, and system design. It consists of
two sub-streams: On the one hand, conceptual and prototyping work in regard to the
protocol layer (e.g., [21–23]), and on the other, research concerning the network
layer, i.e., mainly security-related works made up of experimental and quantitative
research designs (e.g., [24–26]).
Cryptocurrencies as a Disruption? 65
The other three streams address the ecosystem layer:
• Economic: This body of research looks at cryptocurrency from an economist’s
perspective, and mainly includes traditional economic models, portfolio theory,
incentive structures, and the like (e.g., [20, 27–31]).
• Regulatory: Here, researchers discuss legal, fiscal, tax, and regulatory issues of
Bitcoin as a new form of currency (e.g., [10, 32–34]).
• Social Science: Along this road, this research is about sociology, trust, anthropol-
ogy, ethics, and politics in regard to the new phenomenon of cryptocurrencies (e.g.,
[35–38]).
Surprisingly, the Social Science branch is the least developed, but probably the most
relevant for Information Systems (IS) research. Hence, this paper focuses on this
human-centered aspect of cryptocurrency.
2.1 Traditional Digital Payment Solutions
For a long time, credit cards have been the dominant means of payment on the Internet.
Credit cards like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover still denote the
highest volumes of all forms of payments. For instance, daily transaction volumes of
Visa amount to almost 18 bn USD (Fig. 2). Due to certain drawbacks of credit cards to
merchants and consumers—e.g., the possibility of chargebacks, high fees, and a sig-
nificant fraud risk—a wide array of alternative means of online payment has developed.
Important players include China Union Pay, PayPal, and increasingly Bitcoin, albeit
with a huge gap when compared to their old-school credit card competitors.
New players from the ‘fin-tech’ startup realm enter the market and push the
financial market to become more digital and more efficient, encouraging higher
transaction volumes and enhancing security. Payment service providers advertise better
security standards, a better ease of use, and lower fees. However, none of the current
alternatives could so far solve the three inherent major flaws completely.
• Payments through alternative providers still run through customers’ credit/debit
cards or bank accounts, so transaction fees cannot be cut entirely, and the savings
are sometimes even marginal. Furthermore, cross-border transactions still involve
significant fees, regardless of whether the money is transferred directly via credit
card or via a service like PayPal or Skrill.

• The risk of fraud is still present, as every time a customer purchases goods online,
his or her personal data like name, address, and financial information are transferred
over the Internet. This information therefore remains prone to identity theft, no
matter whether it is stored only at one single point (PayPal) or at several.
• Usability or ease of use is still a major weakness, especially concerning older people
who would like to purchase goods online.
These flaws and other ideas have led to a completely new approach to e-payment:
cryptocurrencies.
2.2 Overview of Cryptocurrency
From a technical perspective, cryptocurrency can be defined as a “type of digital
currency which relies on cryptography, usually alongside a proof-of-work scheme, in
order to create and manage the currency. A decentralized network of peer-to-peer
computer nodes working in sync creates and verifies transactions of transfer of said
currency within the network” [39]. A more practical definition is given by Ametrano
[40], stating that cryptocurrency “can be transferred instantly and securely between any
two parties, using the Internet infrastructure and cryptographic security with no need
for a trusted third party. Its value is not backed by any single government or organi-
zation.” Furthermore, Wiatr [41] gives the definition that “a cryptocurrency is a modern
digital medium of exchange. It is a new decentralized, limited and peer-to-peer pay-
ment system. Most cryptocurrencies are created to introduce new units of currency,
whose total amount is limited. All cryptocurrencies use cryptography to control the
creation and transfer of money.” Summarizing the above, we basically follow
Spenkelink [42] and find four main characteristics of cryptocurrencies. First, crypto-
currency works through a decentralized network, meaning that it is free of any external
regulations. Second, it has a strong P2P-approach. This guarantees the direct transac-
tion of money between two parties, regardless of whether it is B2B, B2C, or C2C.
Third, it uses the public Internet, which provides speed, efficiency, and resilience.
Finally, cryptocurrency uses public-key cryptography to make money transactions as
secure as possible.
After the introduction of Bitcoin as the first digital currency in 2009, the number of
cryptocurrencies began to rise, and it quickly became a global phenomenon [43, 44].
Besides Bitcoin, there are hundreds of alternatives, each with different strengths. For
example, Litecoin uses the scrypt encryption and claims to transact four times faster
than Bitcoin, making it a viable alternative for high-speed applications like financial
trading [20]. The so-called Altcoins can be regarded as ‘forks’ of either Bitcoin or
Litecoin, since they are based on the same type of algorithms. Examples include
Feathercoin, ChinaCoin, and Dogecoin [39].
Even though in theory Bitcoins can be mined, i.e., created by everyone, the system
behind Bitcoin ensures certain characteristics that are important conditions for valid
(fiat) currencies. First, scarcity: Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, keeping inflation low
[45]. Second, security: Bitcoin follows the highest security standards using public and
private keys [46]. After a person registers as a Bitcoin provider, he or she gets a digital
Cryptocurrencies as a Disruption? 67
wallet identification number (ID) that will be shown in public, once the person transfers
Bitcoin. All past transactions are recorded in the blockchain. Third, simplicity:
Transferring Bitcoins is easy, requiring a Bitcoin application or wallet on a mobile
device and the required amount of Bitcoins, normally received through a Bitcoin
exchange or an ATM.2 The transfer then only takes minutes, regardless of geographical
distance.
2.3 Value-Add and Risks of Cryptocurrencies
Most authors support the argument that Bitcoin has a significant future and will become
a larger threat for credit card companies [2, 47, 48], but for now the potential is
estimated to be limited to only specific fields [13, 49]. Grinberg [11] underlines the fact
that Bitcoin is likely to be the new, revolutionary payment method for micropayments,
because those are hardly profitable when credit card fees are applied to such small
notional amounts. Böhme et al. [20] argue that it is becoming less certain whether the
design of Bitcoin meets the requirements to replace credit card payments for the
everyday consumer, particularly with regard to security standards. Furthermore, they
illustrate the fact that there are numerous competing virtual currencies, for instance
Litecoin that accelerates payment confirmations, or ‘NXT’ that reduces computational
requirements. To become an essential part of the customer’s daily life, Bitcoin first
needs to achieve the overall reliance in value offer and user adoption.
Spenkelink [42] follows a broader perspective by concluding that the future of
cryptocurrencies is very unclear in general and one can only speculate about its
development. He further claims that many different usage scenarios and different
stakeholder needs prevail, which makes the estimation of Bitcoin’s mass adoption even
harder. Descôteaux [50] holds the opinion that for the future development of Bitcoin,
an appropriate legal and regulatory framework is extremely important in order to
overcome the existing risks and threats slowing down the adoption of cryptocurrency.
The literature also discusses the drawbacks and disadvantages of Bitcoin, such as the
possibility of money laundering [51–54], trade in various illegal goods [55, 56],
potential financing of terrorism [51, 57], Bitcoin loss or theft [21, 58], and tax evasion
or enormous volatility [27, 43, 59]. These aspects were also mentioned by our inter-
view partners.
3 Research Methodology
As described above, only limited research on Bitcoin’s advantages, disadvantages,
disruptive potentials, and adoption drivers exists. Therefore, we approached the
research by following an entirely open, inductive, exploratory research design [60, 61].
Accordingly, an interview guideline was designed based on the literature review, but
also including very open questions to motivate interviewees to come up with their own
ideas, thoughts, anecdotes, and reasoning. To get insights into how different groups see

and experience Bitcoin, the guideline was used to conduct semi-structured interviews in
November and December 2014. To gain maximum diversity and coverage, 13 inter-
views with individuals from three distinct groups were used as a sample [62, 63]. These
are end-consumers, e-commerce merchants, and employees of Bitcoin exchanges with
differing levels of experience with Bitcoin (see Table 1 for the sample description). The
selection of the interview partners was based on a purposive sampling strategy [64].
This ensured the inclusion of a wide array of aspects of the evidence gathered from
informants [65, 66]. The interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed [66].
They lasted between 34 and 56 min.
Interview transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding technique [67]. Relevant
passages were identified and axial coding was subsequently used to refine the cate-
gories. The analysis was diligently carried out to fulfill the common requirements for
qualitative research (e.g., [68–70]). The interpretation process was rule-driven and
documented (“procedural validity”; [70]) In addition, we triangulated the data [70] by
interviewing people with different perspectives on and knowledge about the phe-
nomenon (i.e., three distinct user groups). Therefore, the results can be assumed to be
reliable [71].
4 Analysis and Results
While analyzing the interview transcripts in order to find answers to the research
questions, we decided to apply the established constructs perceived ease of use and
perceived usefulness of the Technology Acceptance Model TAM [72, 73] and sub-
jective norm of its successor, TAM2 [74, 75], as they work well as ordering categories.

Another one, future potential, emerged out of the data. Table 2 summarizes the find-
ings, which are organized around the four research constructs and the case codes. We
have included original quotes, which is the ‘beauty of qualitative research’ [76] and
more often than not provide the deepest insight into the matter. In the following
paragraphs, we discuss the condensed quintessence of our findings.
4.1 Perceived Ease of Use
Consumers found mobile wallets and Bitcoin in general difficult to use, therefore
requiring some training, although one interviewee regarded Bitcoin as easy and
self-explanatory. As buying, selling, or sending Bitcoin is very similar to using a Google
Wallet, it is possible that more consumers will come across technical difficulties when
using Bitcoin for the first time. They agreed that especially the younger generation

should manage to handle Bitcoin and related software/apps, however. These findings are
similar to those of Spenkelink [42]. Risks were not mentioned, but instead consumers
focused on convenience, especially at offline stores (POS).
One merchant complained about the implementation process at POS and stressed
that it’s not a technical, but rather a societal challenge to switch to Bitcoin. Imple-
mentation in online shops was seen as fast and easy, and similar to other payment
options. Most saw volatility as the main threat and agreed that current mobile payment
solutions are convenient, but insecure; maybe Bitcoin can be a remedy here.
The representatives of Bitcoin exchanges saw Bitcoin as the best use case for
mobile wallets. Even though they judged usage and implementation as easy, they still
found it not easy enough. In fact, the whole cryptographic system behind Bitcoin was
deemed just too complex to be understood by users and merchants, and it discouraged
them from giving Bitcoin a try. However, their own companies and the majority of
other exchanges already focus on emphasizing the easy set-up, integration, and usage
of Bitcoin. This has been confirmed by a check on the landing pages of Bitpay, Cubits,
Coinbase, and Safello.3 Here, tutorials, videos, and other training and marketing
activities help users get started.

4.2 Perceived Usefulness
For consumers, anonymity and security rank very high. They feel threatened by credit
card fraud and the old technology used, and consumers hope Bitcoin can be a remedy
here. Due to high transaction fees of credit cards and especially money wiring (fees
here seen as exorbitant), the lower costs are seen as the major argument for using
Bitcoin. The instantaneous character of transactions was seen most relevant to mer-
chants. The fact of doing away with ATM searches abroad once Bitcoin is also widely
accepted at POS, and the possibility of doing remittances as well as using Bitcoin as an
investment vehicle were all seen as very positive. Finally, Bitcoin was found especially
suitable for emerging economies, as they face very different challenges (e.g., lack of
availability of traditional banking services).
Merchants had a quite different view on anonymity and fraud: Anonymity was only
crucial for special target groups, e.g., in online gambling or the sex business, not for
mainstream costumers, thus stating the opposite of Pagliery [57]. The security of
Bitcoin was also not necessarily seen as higher than that of credit cards, as Bitcoin
accounts can also be hacked, which has happened before. Low transaction fees were
the single most important argument for merchants, also in regard to micropayments.
Having the payout of orders immediately on their accounts was also seen as very
advantageous, as they are well aware that time is money.
Bitcoin exchange staff is more convinced about Bitcoin’s usefulness regarding the
elimination of fraud. All experts believe that security will become an increasing
problem in the near future, which is why more secure payment solutions are necessary,
and this is a big benefit of Bitcoin. In terms of anonymity, the necessity of finding ways
to get rid of skyrocketing transaction fees, and the beneficial effect of instant trans-
actions, the experts strongly agreed with the merchants. In terms of global and
cross-border reach, the managers quoted pure speed and simplicity as persuasive
arguments in favor of Bitcoin. Whereas one interviewee judged SEPA as failed,
another mentioned Western Union as working, but at very high costs. Bitcoin as
investment was regarded as ideal, as there is no government or corporate involvement.
This is in strong opposition to the findings of Baek and Elbeck [27] and Garcia et al.
[77], who see Bitcoin as far too speculative to be used by a non-professional investor.
Lastly, emerging economies were mentioned as a suitable target market, since online
shops often times can ship to remote locations, but cannot receive funds from there due
to capital market restraints.
4.3 Subjective Norm
In terms of innovation and technology, consumers rated Bitcoin to be very innovative,
and it helps making mobile wallets attractive. In terms of peer influence, the inter-
viewees so far unfamiliar with the (Bitcoin) process validated that they would give it a
try upon recommendation of a friend. Two consumers denied that they give any rel-
evance to current trends or lifestyle issues, i.e., Bitcoin plays no role here.
Merchants focused on the huge importance of innovation for their business, making
this category the most decisive factor to offer Bitcoin payments. However, competitive
74 A.W. Baur et al.
pressure itself is currently still manageable, with one merchant confirming that they
will look into it, but will probably not introduce it for another 1–2 years. One merchant
claims Bitcoin to be a competitive advantage. In terms of trends, one merchant men-
tioned that it is a cool thing, especially for early-adopters/techies, but has no effect on
revenue or profit, i.e., the bottom line. This statement basically confirms the research of
Kostakis and Giotitsas [78]. The merchant also claims it to be somewhat a marketing
tool, a thing to arouse interest and stand out from the crowd.
As the last group, Bitcoin exchange executives also stress fin-tech innovations as
the key driver for competitiveness,4 making Bitcoin an important part of it. From their
point of view, merchants should be preparing themselves, as competitive pressures to
offer it as a payment solution will rise soon, triggered through increased word-of-mouth
between users. Whether Bitcoin can be considered a ‘cool trend’, there are two different
opinions: One manager confirms this, insisting that Bitcoin could become a lifestyle
product, but another reminds us that when it comes to money issues, people are by far
more conservative when compared to other areas of life.
4.4 Future Potential
The customers’ overall opinion about Bitcoin is very positive; they perceive it as very
promising. Nevertheless, credit cards, PayPal, and some other payment services are still
and will for some time in the future be the most popular online payment method.
Customers are aware of the benefits offered by Bitcoin and alternative means of pay-
ments in general, but experience a certain level of effort, through a cumbersome reg-
istration and administration effort. Issues with credit cards, e.g., manually typing in the
card number and security code, seem to be tolerated until better solutions are developed
and more transparency is created as to which shops actually accept Bitcoin.
Merchants strongly support cryptocurrency. Regardless of all arguments and
restrictions discussed above, from a business perspective, Bitcoin seems to provoke
large interest, and is seen as the future (therefore in line with Van Alstyne [33]). Hence,
already two of the four interviewees accept Bitcoin. Nevertheless, the current customer
demand is very low, so Bitcoin is still a pure niche product and will take time to
develop.
As expected, the managers of Bitcoin exchanges have a very optimistic and positive
view of Bitcoin’s potential. However, the lack of secure storage and usage solutions
hinders market penetration. A widespread initiative to push Bitcoin would be wel-
comed, and the type and extent of regulation will be decisive for its market penetration.
The high importance of educating people and businesses about the actual purpose
and functioning of Bitcoin can be regarded as the unifying factor of all groups (in line
with Papilloud and Haesler [79]). All interviewees also agreed that the actual timing of
widespread adoption cannot be judged at all.
Interestingly, interviewees of all groups also mentioned the underlying blockchain
as an idea and technology that could have a far-reaching, disruptive potential outside of

the payment area. Applications as diverse as document version control, proof of
whether a person’s vote has been counted or clear identification for e-government and
open data solutions were addressed.
5 Conclusion
5.1 Contributions
With this paper, we have contributed to answering several research questions relating to
Bitcoin’s relative advantages and disadvantages, the drivers and barriers of adoption,
and the perceived future potentials from user and professional perspectives.
First, perceived ease of use among stakeholders is still considered rather low. Issues
of usability of mobile wallets, implementation, storage, and transfer as well as offering
user training are not solved satisfactorily yet. Risks like volatility, security, and
accessibility remain. However, people who are using it confirm its high level of con-
venience. In total, some homework needs to be done here.
Second, perceived usefulness is confirmed for the main part, albeit not yet for the
majority of online shoppers. Low transaction fees are central and pivotal to all inter-
viewed individuals. A smaller influence is given to a somewhat higher anonymity and
lower risk of fraud as well as faster claim of payments for merchants. Potential
international reach and acceptance were also convincing. Bitcoin as a new investment
class is controversial, but the high added value for less-developed countries is not.
Third, subjective norm is somewhat split. To use Bitcoin in innovation and in
creating competitive advantage is for all groups of high importance. Peer-influence, the
fact of being trendy or not, as well as lifestyle issues have less influence on the
subjective norm of using Bitcoin.
Fourth, future potential was questioned by comparing it with alternatives. All of
them are deemed important, but with a diminishing degree. Current market penetration
is judged as very low, recognizing Bitcoin as a niche phenomenon. Subjective future
potential is quite the opposite, with all groups assigning a boost in penetration and
eventually becoming ‘a big thing’. The actual timing of this boost was, however, not
answered by anyone.
Fifth, this piece of research has found some evidence that Bitcoin, due to its
completely new way of working without a central institution overseeing it, is about to
become a serious new player in the online payment market. However, society and
businesses are still far from embracing Bitcoin in their daily lives, making educating
people about Bitcoin’s advantages and use necessary. But Bitcoin’s conditions seem
good to become fully accepted and trusted by first addressing certain industries and
later convincing the masses. One step in that direction may be seen in the latest
tech-giant Microsoft accepting Bitcoin for Apps, Windows licenses, Windows Phone,
and Xbox in December 2014.5 Hence, policy-makers and merchants should be
prepared.

Finally, the interviews brought additional areas of use of the blockchain scheme to
the surface. The possibility to issue unique identifiers to things and people alike opens
up immense opportunities in the future.
From a theoretical point of view, we help to expand the body of knowledge about
users’ acceptance, views, opinions, and feelings about cryptocurrencies—a very new
social phenomenon. Additionally, online shops, policy-makers, and regulators should
be alarmed that Bitcoin is indeed not just a crazy idea from some IT nerds, but a
possible game changer for the future. They should take adequate measures to handle it.
5.2 Limitations and Future Research
Our paper suffers from some limitations. First, only 13 individuals were interviewed,
which makes generalizations difficult, as is the case with most inductive, qualitative
research. Based on these interview findings, as a follow-up, hypotheses could be for-
mulated that are then tested in a large-scale quantitative survey in a deductive research
setting. These survey results would then make generalizations possible. Second, there
may be a bias that almost one-third of the interviewees work for Bitcoin exchanges and
hence have an apparent interest in seeing cryptocurrencies as too positive. However,
very new and potentially disruptive innovations demand to include the voice of pro-
fessionals, who can judge the whole scope of the research object [65].
Overall, the paper lays a first foundation to spark future research avenues. Com-
paring developments in different parts of the world could debunk differences due to
risk-aversion (e.g., very high in Germany), methods of payment (e.g., widespread
credit card use in the US), or technical availability (e.g., lack of traditional banking
infrastructure in developing countries). Lastly, including the opinions of people from
regulatory and administrative authorities could help in getting the complete picture of
cryptocurrencies. And lastly, focusing more on the non-payment aspects of the
blockchain technology to revolutionize society in the future may yield great additions
to the body of knowledge in the social sciences.
These are just a few ideas contributing to the massive research effort that is still
needed to completely understand the emergent and possibly disruptive nature of
cryptocurrencies, and to see whether the blockchain can also contribute to a more just
society, based on open platforms and open data with access for everyone.
