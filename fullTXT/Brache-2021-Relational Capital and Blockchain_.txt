Relational Capital and Blockchain: Can
Smart Contracts Redefine the Nature
of Inter-organisational Cooperation?
José Brache and Anne Marie Zwerg-Villegas
Abstract The relational viewposits that the relational capital derived from the social
network process may facilitate the achievement of organisational strategic objectives
in inter-organisational cooperation (Liu et al. in Journal of World Business 45:237–
249, 2010). However, scholarly literature and business media are rife with exam-
ples of inter-organisational cooperation hindering the accomplishment of manage-
ment goals (Brache and Felzensztein in International Business Review 28:25–35,
2019), with over fifty percent of alliances failing to meet their initial objectives
(Kaplan et al. in Harvard Business Review 88:114–120, 2010). Blockchain tech-
nology introduces the opportunity to create, operate, and effectively regulate decen-
tralized autonomous organisations (DAOs) with functions that include ownership,
governance, decision-making, and profit distribution (Sims in New Zealand Univer-
sities Law Review 28:423–458, 2019). Smart contracts in the blockchain could serve
as an automaton to efficiently modify cooperation behaviours, thus improving the
potential for successful cooperation. Using a game theory approach to formulate
a series of propositions, this study explores how smart contracts and blockchain
technology help develop and manage relational capital. As a theoretical contribu-
tion, this chapter explains how smart contracts solve the natural frictions that arise in
collaborative projects and offers a set of recommendations for policymakers and prac-
titioners looking to engage in inter-organisational cooperation using smart contracts
as a mediating tool.

1 Introduction
The contemporary economy increasingly consists of global and inter-organizational
alliances to source both tangible and intangible resources and foment the achieve-
ment of organizational strategic objectives (Brache & Felzensztein, 2019). However,
despite the ubiquity of inter-organisational collaboration, only half of these arrange-
ments succeed in meeting their objectives (Kaplan et al., 2010). Cooperation implies
an investment on the part of each participating firm with the expectation of benefit.
Game theory modelling clearly demonstrates the risks involved with collaboration
and the rational tendency to defect.
Relational capital theory indicates that trust, communication, and commitment
between co-operators improve the potential for success. Relational capital is a firm
resource that results from the social network processes. In this regard, the relational
view affirms that competitive advantages can be accessed beyondfirm-level resources
and might be embedded in intertwined collaborative relationships (Liu et al., 2010).
Still, scarcitymindset and proprietary knowledge vulnerability in alliancesmoderates
the beneficial influence of relational capital (Lee et al., 2007; Wiedmer et al., 2020).
Blockchain technology introduces an opportunity to create, operate, and effec-
tively regulate decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) with functions that
include ownership, governance, decision-making, and profit distribution (Sims,
2019). This implies that, while over fifty percent of alliances fail to meet their initial
objectives (Kaplan et al., 2010), smart contracts in the blockchain could serve as
an automaton that may efficiently modify cooperation behaviours. Thus, blockchain
technology, including smart contracts, may resolve many of the negative cooperation
behaviours leading to the failures amply reported in the cooperation literature.
This chapter explores how blockchain technology and smart contracts could
develop and manage relational capital. A game theory approach formulates a series
of propositions to guide academic researchers and practitioners in understanding the
applications of blockchain technology in the development of intellectual capital. As
a theoretical contribution, this chapter explains how smart contracts solve the natural
frictions that arise in collaborative projects and offers a set of recommendations for
policymakers and practitioners looking to engage in inter-organisational cooperation
using smart contracts as a mediating tool.
1.1 Cooperation
The essential mathematical principles addressing the issue of cooperation can be
found widely in the evolutionary dynamics literature stream. These principles create
models for human populations as well as other species in regards to the evolution of
cooperation. Game theory is commonly used in this field as an appropriate research
tool (Xia et al., 2012).

Cooperation is a strategy that flourishes in nature and is present among many
organisms. Humans are the “super co-operators” because of the high degree of
complexity present in human–human cooperation. Mathematical models that simu-
late cooperation should include the fact that individuals who cooperate have a cost
“C” to facilitate the receipt of a benefit “B” on the other cooperating individual’s
behalf. Defectors do not assume a cost and facilitate no benefit (Nowak, 2006). This
scheme proposes a framework to understand the dynamics of cooperation and its
possible outcomes. The standard payoffs for participating individuals are shown in
Table 1.
Understanding the cooperation model portrayed in Table 1 enables the integration
of context effects into the model. The context will affect each individual’s cost and
benefits entering a cooperation dilemma; therefore, context can be crucial in deter-
mining the cooperation equilibria. Relational capital now acquires a relevant role in
cooperation dynamics.
1.2 Relational Capital
Contemporary inter-organisational cooperation is global in nature, which is inher-
ently complicated and risky. Thus, relational capital becomes gradually more impor-
tant as a predictor of cooperation success. Relational capital is a firm resource that
results from social network processes. In this regard, the relational view affirms
that competitive advantages can be accessed beyond firm-level resources and might
be embedded in intertwined collaborative relationships (Liu et al., 2010). Literature
suggests that relational capital plays a vital role in alliances dealingwith the exchange
of both tangible and intangible resources.
In the case of tangible resources, global competition increases the perception
of scarcity, and the threat of scarcity impacts firm sales and purchasing decisions.
Behavioural research demonstrates that the scarcity mindset foments competition
rather than collaboration. Relational capital—based on trust, communication, and
commitment (Lee et al., 2007)—may moderate scarcity-induced competitiveness.
However, scarcity-specific supply chain research finds evidence that competitive
behaviour continues,with less propensity for collaboration involving critical resource
supplies, regardless of the extent of relational capital (Wiedmer et al., 2020).
106 J. Brache and A. M. Zwerg-Villegas
As the global economy becomes dependent upon knowledge as a source of
competitive advantage, inter-organisational cooperation increasingly involves infor-
mation exchange and learning opportunities. Firms in “learning alliances,” specif-
ically, have the primary objective of internalizing critical information, knowledge,
or capabilities from their partners (Khanna et al., 1998). However, firms in these
alliances are in a delicate situation. If they contribute too little, the alliance will not
flourish. If they contribute too much, the partner will reap the extent of the benefits.
Relational capital helps balance these extremes by facilitating learning interactions
while reducing opportunistic behavior (Lee et al., 2007).
1.3 Blockchain and Smart Contracts
Blockchain technology has a wide range of industry applications, given its capa-
bility to foment decentralization, tamper-proofing, transparency, and traceability
(Wang et al., 2021). The smart contract is a specific blockchain technology providing
security and financial benefits in commercial settings. Standard features include
self-execution, self-enforcement, transparency, and flexibility (Wang et al., 2021).
As such, smart contracts are especially useful in high-value financial transac-
tions. We propose that the smart contract blockchain technology is useful in inter-
organizational cooperation above and beyond relational capital. In high stakes
alliances, whether due to high monetary investment, vulnerability of proprietary
knowledge, or lack of trust between new partners, smart contracts provide a mecha-
nism to ensure each partner’s commitment and collaboration to at least a minimally
agreed upon standard.
To demonstrate the usefulness of such blockchain smart contract technologies,
we first model a series of inter-organisational export ventures in their absence. The
scenarios evaluated using the following model highlight the logical and rational
tendency for each firm to defect.
2 The Model
The following models consider two firms (Firm 1 and Firm 2) that cooperate in an
export venture. Both firms have the choice to cooperate or defect and must make the
decision simultaneously. They may communicate before deciding. If they decide to
cooperate, they may cooperate at five different levels. Each level represents the cost
of the firm related to the specific export venture. C1 represents the cost to Firm 1;
C2 represents the cost to Firm 2. Table 2 depicts the matrix of choices.
The total income that each firmwill secure from the cooperative action (the export
venture) is the benefit. B1 is the benefit for Firm 1. B2 is the benefit for Firm 2.
Consistent with game theory, we propose that each firm’s benefit as a direct result of

the cooperative action will be a function of the cost matrix of choice combinations:
bi = Fi (Cost Matrix of Choice Combinations).
In this model, we present the following separate functions for Firm1 and Firm2.
B1 = C1 ∗ λ + C2 ∗ β (1)
B2 = C1 ∗ π + C2 ∗ α (2)
where
λ The return that Firm1 achieves from its own investment (cost).
β The return that Firm1 achieves from the investment (cost) of Firm2.
π The return that Firm2 achieves from its own investment (cost).
α The return that Firm2 achieves from the investment (cost) of Firm 1.
Table 3 represents the final payoffs corresponding to each firm.
2.1 Evaluating Multiple Scenarios
Initially, we evaluated the resulting payoff matrices of 17 different scenarios that
reflect different value combinations of λ, β, π, and α at all levels of the cost matrix
of choice combinations. Nash equilibriums are identified in each case. λ, β, π, and
α capture the internal and external factors affecting the firm’s performance.
The chosen scenarios are built as a matrix on the following logic, giving the Firm
1 example. The same would apply to Firm 2.

• Recover + Margin: The firm recovers its own investment (C1 in the case of Firm
1), has a profit on its own investment (C1), and also has a profit on the investment
of the other firm (C2).
• Does Not Recover + Margin: The firm does not recover its own investment (C1
in the case of Firm 1), does not have profit on its own investment (C1), but does
have a profit on the investment of the other firm (C2).
• Recovers + 0 Margin: The firm recovers its own investment (C1), has a profit on
its own investment (C1), but does not have a profit on the investment of the other
firm (C2).
• Does Not Recover + 0 Margin: The firm does not recover its own investment
(C1), does not have profit on its own investment (C1), and does not have profit on
the investment of the other firm (C2).
Table 4 provides the values for each variable in each of the evaluated scenarios.

From the results of the scenario evaluations, as summarized in Table 5, we report
these findings: (1) cooperation equilibria only appear as a choice when both firms
recover their investment (cost), i.e., C1 for Firm 1 andC2 for Firm 2; (2) in all cases in
which firms do not recover their investment (cost), there is a strictly dominant strategy
to defect for both firms; (3) in all cases in which firms do not recover their investment
(cost), and there is a strictly dominant strategy to defect, the payoffs for Firm 1 and
Firm 2 depend on the degree of cooperation chosen and not all combination of the
Cost Matrix Choice Combination provide a positive result for both players. Even
when both Firm 1 and Firm 2 decide to cooperate, their payoffs might be negative.
An additional scenario (Scenario 17), where λ = 1,π = 1, β = 0 and α = 0, shows
no requirement of a positive return greater than the investment (cost) of each firm
for cooperation to appear as a Nash equilibrium. All that is required is investment
(cost) recovery (Table 5).

Relational Capital and Blockchain: Can Smart Contracts Redefine … 127
3 Conclusions
This chapter explores the factors that determine the emergence of cooperation equi-
libria in an export cooperation venture by modelling and evaluating several possible
scenarios that account for firms’ internal and external factors in cooperation projects.
The evaluation of the proposed model demonstrates that when firms cooperate and
choose among different cooperation levels, their cooperation levels do not affect the
emergence of cooperation equilibria. The factors that condition the emergence of
cooperative equilibria are the returns of cost for each of the firms involved in the
cooperative endeavour. Thus, according to the proposed model, if λ ≥ 1 and π ≥ 1
simultaneously, cooperation equilibria emerge. This implies that firmswill cooperate
only with the assurance of recovering the costs invested in the cooperative venture.
Otherwise, the logical and rational outcome of the simulation game would be to
defect.
Given the tendency to defect, additional measures are required to foment inter-
organisational cooperation, including relational capital. We suggest that blockchain
technologies such as smart contracts are the contemporary mechanism to promote
trust between potential co-operators. The models indicate that firms remain
committed when they have the assurance of cost recovery. With their inherent char-
acteristics of self-execution, self-enforcement, transparency, and flexibility (Wang
et al., 2021), smart contracts can provide this assurance. Even in cases where the
cooperating firms have no prior experience on which to develop the trust, commu-
nication, and commitment of relational capital, smart contracts could supersede this
limitation.
4 Practical and Managerial Contributions
The most important practical implications for policymakers and managers point
to creating cooperative environments that allow for sustainable cooperation strate-
gies. For policymakers, this might include creating special programs that guarantee
the recovery of the costs from export cooperative ventures. Such programs should
increase cooperation and firm export performance. For managers, this chapter should
motivate cooperative alliances when there is the assurance of recovering the costs
involved in the cooperative export venture.
The markets are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain technolo-
gies to facilitate inter-organizational transactions. This chapter suggests that firms
and governments consider their potential, particularly those of smart contracts, as
a mechanism of promoting inter-organisational cooperation such as that between
export venture partners.
