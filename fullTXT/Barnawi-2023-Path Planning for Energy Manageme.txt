Abstract— Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is used in the mod-
ern eco-friendly environment for demand response management.
It helps in reducing the carbon footprints in the environment.
However, security and privacy of the information exchange
between different entities are significant concerns keeping in
view of the information exchange via an open channel, i.e.,
Internet among different entities such as plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles (PHEVs), charging stations (CSs), and controllers in V2G
environment. With an exponential rise in Electric vehicles (EVs)
usage across the globe, there is a requirement of developing
a seamless charging infrastructure for charging and billing.
Moreover, secure information flow needs to be maintained at
different levels in such an environment. Hence, this paper
proposes a blockchain-based demand response management for
efficient energy trading between EVs and CSs. In this proposal,
miner nodes and block verifiers are selected using their power
consumption and processing power. These nodes are responsible
for the authentication of various transactions in the proposal.
We also proposed a game theory-based solution to support energy
management and peak load control off-peak and peak condi-
tions. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using various
performance evaluation metrics where its performance is found
superior in comparison to the existing solutions in the literature.
Index Terms— Vehicle-to-grid, electric vehicles, scheduling,
blockchain, game theory.
I. INTRODUCTION
THE use of traditional energy technologies such as coal
power plants, fossil fuels etc., at a large scale can
lead to the mismanagement of demand response in mod-
ern smart eco-system. The burning of fossil fuels is the
largest source of pollution causing increase of carbon dioxide
(C O2) in the environment. With this, thermal power plants
(heat energy is converted into electricity) also produce C O2.
It is one of the most critical factors, which increases the

concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which
causes global warming. Nowadays, the demand for energy
generation from renewable energy resources such as solar
energy, wind energy, hydro energy, tidal energy, geothermal
energy, and biomass energy increases day-by-day [1]. However
these energy resources are green, but having limitations of
their uncertainty, volatile, and unpredicted nature. Even the
integration of renewable energies with the smart grid is a
challenging task [2], [3].
Though the energy generation from renewable energy
resources is viable solution but it is not possible to completely
utilize the ever-growing power demand. It may cause a mis-
match between demand and supply, which is the root cause
of grid instability. However, recently vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
technology has been introduced to solve the demand response
management problem in the smart grid. It is an emerging
technology that integrates renewable energy systems with
electric vehicles (EVs) [4], [5]. The overall power grid with
renewable energy resources and conventional energy resources
is as shown in Fig. 1.
EVs have been gaining popularity from the past few years
because of their reduced dependency on fossil fuels, thus,
contributing to a clean and green V2G environment in the
V2G network. They also provides ancillary services to the grid
by charging or discharging facilities with the power system.
On the other hand, EVs can act as energy consumers and

energy suppliers according to the requirements of the power
grid system and contribute carbon dioxide-free environment.
Hence, the battery of EVs may act as power storage to the elec-
tric motor. No extra generation capacity is required to charge
the battery of the EVs [6]. Motivated by these, most of the
countries across the globe have started the participation of EVs
for ancillary services for a future green V2G environment [7].
EVs can reshape the transportation sector, drastically cutting
carbon emissions and clearing the way for significant climate
progress. However, they are still facing challenges on life cycle
assessment, charger time and compatibility, availability of
charging infrastructure, renewable energy and climate mitiga-
tion, and driving range compared to conventional fossil-fueled
vehicles [8]. Moreover, there are several security and privacy
vulnerabilities such as privacy-preservation, data manipulation,
transparency, etc. in V2G environments. It may increase the
gap between energy demand and supply. Hence, there is
a requirement for demand response management scheme to
stabilize the energy demand and supply.
From the above facts, we have observed that optimal partic-
ipation of EVs in V2G requires not only for charging but also
exceptional discharging of the EVs battery. By increasing the
number of EVs, there is no control over power consumption,
which may be a power mismatch between demand and supply,
the primary cause of grid instability. It also causes uneco-
nomical operations such as overloading, efficiency reduc-
tion, power quality, the voltage at the distribution side [9].
Therefore, serious problems may arise under uncoordinated
charging/discharging scenarios of EVs. So, coordinated charg-
ing/discharging of EVs is a viable solution to mitigate all
these problems. Many proposals exist on EVs participation to
manage the charging/discharging operations for a green V2G
environment [10]–[12]. For example, Li et al. [13] gave a com-
prehensive overview of the data analytics landscape on the EVs
integration to green smart cities. They have discussed the solu-
tions and need for data analytics for EVs integration to grid in
smart cities. Similarly, Cai et al. [14] discussed the issues for
reliable and efficient data exchanges between EVs, charging
stations (CSs), and the power grid. They have provided the
network design for hybrid vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Abedinia et al. [15]
proposed a multiobjective-based optimization algorithm to
solve the problem of EVs scheduling in a smart network
because of sustainable energy sources based on the cost
and pollution minimization. Similarly, Lin et al. [16]worked
on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which
considers green energy generation, energy storage, and EVs as
a single-end user. They proposed an energy trading platform
based on Internet-of-Energy (IoE) to reduce energy waste and
maintain a green V2G environment. Hu et al. [17] proposed
software-defined networking (SDN) architecture in a green
V2G network for efficient and economical energy manage-
ment. Similarly, Sun et al. [18] used an SDN for efficient and
green EV charging management. The architecture includes
three planes i.e., application plane, control plane, and physical
plane, presenting the demand side management approach for
EV charging. Chen et al. [19] proposed an energy-efficient
framework using pre-caching techniques in a blockchain-based
IoT environment. Similarly, Raja et al. [20] proposed an intel-
ligent reward-based data offloading in vehicular networks.
They have used SDN controller to solve the dynamic opti-
mization problem by performing an efficient offloading, which
increases the overall system throughput.
From the facts mentioned above, we have observed that
most of the researchers assumed the trusted third-party system
in their design, which handles the EV’s private information.
So, security and privacy of EVs has been largely ignored. They
have shared EV’s private information to the central aggregator
in their frameworks, leading to serious privacy concerns.
Hence, there is a need for an efficient and secure energy trad-
ing framework for EVs charging in a green V2G environment.
So, in this paper, we have designed a blockchain-based system
model to provide efficient and secure energy trading between
EVs and the CSs in a green V2G environment.
A. Contributions of This Paper
The major contributions of this paper are summarized as
follows.
• A blockchain-based secure energy trading model for
demand response management is proposed for a green
V2G environment.
• A miner node selection scheme is presented using the
power capacity and processing power of the entities
present in the blockchain network.
• To efficiently manage the EVs in load management sce-
nario, EVs are supposed to act as players using game
theory and compete for acquiring energy from the CSs
based on their respective utilities.
• In a peak load control scenario, EVs act as energy
suppliers, i.e., dual-mode EVs where they provide energy
to other EVs as per their requirements. The batteries of
the dual-mode EVs have considerable energy levels that
choose either charging or discharging.

II. RELATED WORK
V2G technology has been gaining wide popularity in recent
years. Many research articles focused on improving the grid
performance. But, very few of these consider both the grid
and EVs’ preferences while developing charging/discharging
algorithms in a green V2G environment [21].
In [22], authors proposed the EVs charging/discharging
model to keep track of daily renewable generation. They
have used the serial quadratic programming to optimal
charging/discharging scheduling of EVs during 24 hours.
Similarly, Rong-Ceng Leou [23] proposed an optimal charg-
ing/discharging control for EVs by considering the system
constraints and operational costs. Jiang et al. [24] proposed

the optimization model to coordinate renewable energy
resources and the EVs to a minimum variance of equivalent
load. Hadian et al. [25] proposed the optimal planning of
EVs charging/discharging to peak shaving and valley filling.
They have used multi-objective particle swarm optimization
to control the rate and time of charging/discharging of EVs.
Similarly, He et al. [26] proposed an optimal scheduling
scheme for the charging/discharging of EVs. They have used
convex optimization to minimize the total cost of EVs. In the
same way, An et al. [27] focused on the charging/discharging
strategy of EVs. They have considered the energy stored in
EVs’ batteries to support the high penetration of renewable
EVs and enhance the power system’s operational flexibility.
Mehrabi et al. [28] proposed charging/discharging scheduling
mechanism for EVs at home and joint lots for households
prosumers. They have used the mixed optimization model
to maximize consumers’ profit and ensure the satisfaction of
consumers. Similarly, Said et al. [29] also proposed a novel
protocol based on queuing model for managing the charg-
ing/discharging of EVs in the smart grid. In the same way,
Liu et al. proposed an optimization solution to optimize
the route selection and charging/discharging scheduling of
EVs. They have applied the artificial intelligence-based A*
algorithm to find the shortest path for EVs. They have used the
k-shortest-paths-joint-routing-scheduling for EVs to minimize
the overall cost of the system in the V2G energy network.
From the literature, we have observed that no one has
considered the security and privacy of EVs with charg-
ing/discharging facilities, which is a significant concern in a
green V2G environment. There are several research articles
where researchers have used the blockchain technology to pro-
vide security and privacy with the EVs charging/discharging
facilities in a V2G environment [30], [31]. This technology
is not only used in transportation systems but also used in
various applications such as e-voting systems, smart grids,
healthcare, aerial networks etc. [32]–[35]. For example, the
authors in [36], [37] proposed an energy trading mechanism
for EVs charging based on a blockchain to provide security
and privacy in the system. Yang et al. [38] presented a
blockchain-based virtual power plant for energy management
to optimize system efficiency and preserve the users’ privacy.
Su et al. [39] proposed a contract theory for EVs charging in
an intelligent community secured by permission blockchain.
Similarly, Samuel et al. [40] proposed a blockchain approach
to resolve the privacy issue without restricting trading activities
in V2G networks. Gao et al. [41] proposed a blockchain-
based privacy-preserving payment mechanism that enables
data sharing while securing sensitive user information in
V2G networks. In a similar way, Radi et al. [42] proposed
a blockchain-based system where energy traders and EVs
owners work together to satisfy EVs’ energy demands with
the privacy-preservation of EVs. Li et al. [43] proposed
an optimal secure and privacy-preserving trading scheme
for charging/discharging scheduling of EVs. They have
implemented the proposed work on Hyperledger Fabric that
evaluates the scalability of the scheme. Similarly, Li et al. [44]
proposed a scheduling scheme for two-way energy trad-
ing between EVs and the smart grid. They have used the
improved krill herd algorithm to improve the power load
fluctuations and implemented it on Hyperledger to evaluate
the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. Liu et al. [45]
proposed a blockchain-based EV charging scheme based on
a genetic algorithm to minimize the load fluctuation level
and overall charging cost for EVs in the smart grid. They
have used the Iceberg order execution algorithm to improve
the EVs charging/discharging scheduling. Moreover, Abdullah
Yildizbasi presented the blockchain for the transformation in
the energy sector and ensured the sustainability of energy
grid management systems [46]. In addition, Xu et al. [47]
proposed a blockchain-based power dispatching framework
for high renewable energy penetrated power systems. They
used this model to protect the interests of low-carbon tech-
nology users that improve the grid’s stability and reduce
the abandoned renewable energy sources generation. Nev-
ertheless, no one has described the EVs scheduling con-
cerning charging/discharging facilities using blockchain in a
green V2G environment. Hence, in this paper, we propose a
blockchain-based energy trading model for demand response
management. Then, we have discussed the energy management
and peak load control scenarios to efficiently and effectively
manage the EVs charging/discharging facilities during peak
and off-peak conditions.
The comparison of the proposed energy trading scheme with
the existing schemes is shown in Table I.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
This section discusses a general scenario of a green V2G
environment in the smart grid for demand response manage-
ment. It comprises EVs and CSs entities, which are connected
in a blockchain network where EVs act as energy consumers
and energy suppliers and CSs act as energy suppliers. The
energy trading between the entities is so that one wants to
sell energy, and the other wants to buy it. The proposed
system model is as shown in Fig. 2, and its working is
described as follows. Initially, the nodes communicate the
charging/discharging energy requests on a blockchain. Then,
these requests are passed to all the nodes present on a
blockchain. Under peak and off-peak conditions, energy trad-
ing takes place between the entities for demand response man-
agement. There is a power line communication between EVs
and CSs. Most EVs are equipped with an onboard charging
system that converts grid-supplied alternate current (AC) to
the direct current (DC) required for EVs charging. These
onboard chargers enable a vehicle to be charged directly from
a standard home plug (slow AC) at home, workplace, or public
location. Some CSs provide direct current to the EVs and
bypass the onboard converter are referred to as DC chargers.
Due to the ability of fast charging, it provides higher charging
rates. The CSs have some intelligence that takes care of EVs
authentication and communication, data collection and moni-
toring, and payment. After the successful trading, the energy
coins are transferred from the buyer’s wallet address to the
seller’s wallet address on a mutually agreed value. The detailed
description of system model entities is explained as follows.
A. Electric Vehicles
EVs play a vital role in a V2G environment. It has the capa-
bility of bi-directional energy trading. It can act as an energy
producer and provide electricity by discharging its battery

during peak time. On the other side, it can also act as an energy
consumer by charging its battery with electricity during the
peak-off time. They can adjust their charging and discharging
nature and actively participate in a green V2G environment.
In this paper, as a decentralized blockchain-based system, EVs
communicate on a blockchain for charging/discharging the
battery. Those EVs who need electricity services can determine
their service demand to purchase the energy on a blockchain.
They take energy services from the CSs and the other EVs in
a particular time slot.
• EV’s as Energy Consumers: When EVs act as energy
consumers, the maximum amount of energy an EV ’EVi ’
can buy is depends upon the state of charge level.
If available state of charge of an EVi is ’SCavl
i ’ while
maximum state of charge is ’SCmax
i ’, then the state of
charge that can be charged (SCchr
i ) is:
SCchr
i = SCmax
i − SCavl
i (1)
The corresponding energy needed ’EV need
i ’ that can ge
given to EVi is:
EV need
i = SCchr
i .Erated
i (2)
where, Erated
i is the rated energy capacity of EVi . And
the amount EVi has to pay in return to take the charging
energy from the seller is defined as.
Amt (EVi → seller) = EV need
i .P �p (3)
where, P �p is the amount or price announced by the seller
to sell the energy to EVi [48].
• EV’s as Energy Suppliers: When EVs act as energy
suppliers, they can also give energy to the EVs during
peak timings. So, the excess energy at EVdual after giving
the energy to EVs is:
Eexc
dual = Eavl
dual − EV need
i (4)
Also, the following condition should satisfy to give
energy to EVs is:
Eavl
dual ≥ EV need
i (5)
Moreover, for the successful energy trade, the price
announced by the dual-mode EV must be accepted by
buyer EV before the trade may take place. If the dual-
mode EV charges price pdual , then the buyer EV has to
pay equals to the amount:
Amt (EVi → EVdual) = EV need
i .pdual (6)
B. Charging Stations
A charging station is a piece of equipment that connects an
EV to a source of electricity to recharge its batteries. Some
CSs have advanced smart metering, cellular capability, and
network connectivity, while others are essential features. They
are also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).

They are provided in municipal parking locations by electric
utility companies or at retail shopping centres by private com-
panies. These stations provide special connectors that conform
to the variety of electric charging connector standards. In this
paper, we have considered several CSs that provide energy to
EVs as per-kWh. They act as energy suppliers, which give
energy to EVs under peak and off-peak timings. During off-
peak timings, the rate of discharging energy by CSs is the
same, but in peak timings, it can vary from one CS to the other.
If the energy given to EVi by C Sj is EV need
i and C Sj has
available energy is Eavl
j , then excess energy at C Sj is given by,
Eexc
j = Eavl
j − EV need
i (7)
The condition should be satisfied that the required or needed
energy by EVi from the C Sj must be:
EV need
i ≤ Eavl
j (8)
C. Blockchain Network
The operation of a blockchain-based energy trading scheme
for demand response management between the entities is
described as follows. The blockchain mechanism provides
privacy to the associated entities by using cryptographic
primitives to authenticate the transactions amongst these enti-
ties [49], [50]. It is referred to as a continuous chain of data
blocks containing the nodes’ information. In this system, each
node has its ledger to maintain the history of transactions.
There are two types of nodes presented in the system model,
as shown in Fig. 2. The first is the miner node, and the
other is the normal node. The miner nodes are responsible
for authenticating and authorizing the transactions the users
want to perform securely. In contrast, normal nodes maintain
a ledger to keep the logs of their transactions.
The blockchain network designs a scheme, which specifies
the relationship between the entities, i.e., the amount of energy
needed by EVs and the reward, i.e., payment to the seller
in terms of energy coins [51]. In this scheme, each node
on the network sends a request for charging/discharging the
energy. The energy buyer nodes are requesting to charge
the batteries. On the other hand, energy selling nodes are
requesting discharging on the blockchain network. They com-
pete among themselves for making an energy transaction with

maximum utility. A reward or penalty process is done as per
their scheduling time-slots. So, this scenario is based on the
game formulation. Every action of the game on the network
stores it on the public ledgers of the nodes. After completing
the energy transaction, an energy seller will receive an energy
coin from the corresponding charged EVs. The authentication
of the payment can be verified by checking the last block of
the blockchain.
All the energy transactions between the entities have been
collected and recorded within a certain amount of time.
Then, these transactions are encrypted, digitally signed, and
structured into blocks. Further, these blocks are broadcasted on
the blockchain network for verification and validation, which
is done by Proof-of-Work (PoW) [52]. Fake and invalid trans-
actions will be discarded. Each node on the network competes
to create a block by solving the complex mathematical puzzle
and creating a hash value. The computed hash value from
the puzzle consists of a nonce ‘N’ (a random number), the
previous hash ‘h’ of the block, timestamp ‘T’, and other data.
A valid ‘N’ satisfies the (α + h) < β, in which β represents
the difficult level. The first node that finds the valid PoW
broadcasts it on the network for validation. All the other nodes
audit and validate the PoW. If the received PoW is valid by
all the nodes (consensus has been reached when 51% nodes
satisfy on PoW), the block is added to the chain; otherwise,
not. The node which created the block will be rewarded with
a certain amount of bitcoins. So, in a nutshell, the blockchain
mechanism in the system model works in the following steps.
1) The requesting entities float an energy transaction charg-
ing/discharging request in the blockchain network.
2) The requests are then passed onto the miner nodes for
authentication. These nodes add the transaction to a
blockchain when the calculated hash is similar to the
received hash.
3) If the requests are authentic, the miner node sends these
requests to all other entities to store the transaction
history.
4) Both charging/discharging requests are segregated for
energy management and peak load control scenarios.
Then, the actual energy trade happens between the
entities.
5) The energy coins are transferred from the buyer’s wal-
let address to the seller’s wallet address. The miner
node then authenticates the wallet address using a PoW
mechanism. It transfers the amount once its wallet is
successfully authenticated.
IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM
In this section, we present the working of the proposed
scheme by involving several EVs and CSs for real-time
management of load in a green V2G environment. Initially,
the miner node is selected to validate the blocks created
during the energy transactions between the blockchain entities.
After the block validation, the trading between them takes
place based on the energy requirements. The energy demands
by the entities may vary concerning time and hence may
cause energy fluctuations on the network. Therefore demand
response management is used to balance the energy demand
and supply between the entities. This method is utilized to
schedule EVs during off-peak and peak timings that supports
energy management and peak load control, respectively. How-
ever, EVs are reserved for both charging/ discharging and CSs
for discharging purposes during energy transactions.
Once the requests are received at the blockchain network,
these requests are segregated into charging requests and dis-
charging requests. Hence, charging requests are scheduled to
support energy management, whereas discharging requests of
EVs are scheduled to support peak shaving. In other words,
there is a need for time slots to schedule the EVs during
peak and off-peak timings. The algorithms for miner nodes
selection, energy management, and peak load control are
described below, which have been used to address the energy
trading scheme for demand response management.
A. Miner Node Selection
The miner nodes are selected so that all the EVs and the CSs
present on a blockchain may become the miner nodes. Initially,
the number of EVs and CSs are given as inputs that output
the miner nodes’ selection. For selecting the miner nodes from
all the entities, we use different criteria for different entities.
In the case of CSs, their power capacity is taken into account
for selecting miner nodes. The power capacity which has more
value than the threshold value ’T HC S’ is put in the list ’List’.
With this, we have considered the stake values SC S of C S and
its threshold value is ST h as mentioned in the Algorithm 1.
Similarly, in the case of EVs, their processing power and stake
values are taken into consideration used for validation purpose
in the mining process and those EVs have more processing
power and stake values than threshold value ’T HEV ’ and ST h ,
respectively are put in the list ’List’.
Finally, for the selection of miner nodes, the ratio of miner
nodes to the normal nodes (β) is considered based on how
many miner nodes are selected from the List . In the proposed
scheme, the value of beta is set as 20%. The advantage
of selecting miner nodes is that even if one entity tries to
maximize its power for becoming a miner node. Then, also
it is not sure that it will become miner nodes. So, every
node on a blockchain would stay true to its true nature.
In addition to it, the values of T HC S and T HEV are changed
after periodic intervals of time, so each node has an equal
chance to participate in the miner node selection process. The
algorithm is then executed again, and new miner nodes are
selected based on the changed threshold values. This makes the
energy management scheme for demand response management
more robust and helps avoid an adversary who tries to find out
the miner nodes and attempt to manipulate them.
B. Demand Response Management
Game theory involves the interactions among different play-
ers which are participated in the game [53]. Each player plays
a different game strategy while considering the game rules
and maximizing its payoff. This theory can be divided into
two main categories, i.e., cooperative and non-cooperative.
In the cooperative game theory, players coordinate with one
another to maximize their payoffs. In contrast, in the non-
cooperative game theory, players do not interact and play the

blockchain network act as players that plays a non-cooperative
game. Here, EVs on a blockchain calculate their payoff values
to complete for an energy resource CS and try to maximize
its payoff on its own. The auction game theory is applied in
energy management when two or more EVs have the same
payoff value. Then, according to the sealed-bid first-price
auction, EV pays higher to CS can schedule first at CS for
charging the battery. The players once announce their prices
can not change, and the other players are not aware of the
prices announced in encrypted or sealed form.
Hence, the proposed energy trading scheme for demand
response management has been optimized based on energy
coins and the state of charge. Accordingly, a payoff (μ) value
is calculated for EVi in the following equation 9 that supports
load management during off-peak timings.
μi = SC EV
i .a1 + ECi .b1 (9)
where ECi is the new energy coins; SC EV
i is the state of
charge; a1, b1, are the constant values.
The charging energy capacity (EV c
i ) of EVi battery changes
according to its quality of degree d as mentioned below.

i = (EV need
i )/d (10)
1) Energy Management in Demand Response Management:
Algorithm 2 describes the working of demand response man-
agement in V2G environment, as follows. Initially, the EVs
that require charging energy request for acquiring energy on
the blockchain network. All the requests have been stored
in the list ’L’ represents (line 2). Then, calculate the payoff
value (μp) (as calculated in equation 9) and corresponding
needed energy (EV need
i ) of the EVs and store this information
in structure K p (lines 3-6). Further, the structure of K p is
sorted in descending order from the highest payoff value to the
lowest (lines 7-15). After sorting, select Jp of highest payoff
from the K p that subjects CSs resource having same energy

arise a situation where two or more EVs may have the same

the following method. Firstly, such EVs are identified (lines

scheduled during the considered time slot are scheduled later
having energy requirement (lines 49-51). In the last, after the
completion of energy transactions, the energy coins EC are
transferred from EVs wallet address to CSs wallet address.
All the information is stored on the blockchain network for
transparency and immutability of the system model.
2) Peak Load Control in Demand Response Management:
Under peak conditions, dual-mode EVs provide the energy to
manage the high demand for charging the battery of EVs. The
energy is drawn from dual-mode EVs having an excess state
of charge (as described in equation 5). This excess state of
charge should be greater than or equal to the energy needed by
EVs (in equation 6). This subsection elaborates the allocation
of dual-mode EVs to the energy-required EVs under demand
response management.
The energy that dual-mode EVs EVdual can discharge is
Edis
dual , which has been used to charge the EVs is presented in
the following equation 11.
(Edual)
dis
j = (SCdual)
dis
j .Erated(EVdual) (11)
The actual energy according to the quality of degree (d)
that the EVdual can discharge is presented in the following
equation 12.
(Edual)
dis
j = d(SCdual)
dis
j .Erated(EVdual) (12)
where, (Edual)
dis
j is the energy discharge by EVdual;
(SCdual)
dis
j is the state of charge; Erated(EVdual) is the rated
capacity of the EVdual in kilowatt-hour (KWh).
The algorithm 3 defines the working of peak shaving
for demand response between the dual-mode EVs and the
charging energy requires EVs. All the dual-mode EVs sending
the discharging energy request with their submitted bid price
’pdual’ on the blockchain network. This information can never
be changed because of the immutability nature of blockchain
and the other dual-mode EVs are not aware of the prices
announced as it is in encrypted or sealed form. In this
algorithm, the list of the dual-mode EVs with respect to the
cost per unit of energy Cd
j and energy discharge (Edual)
dis
j by
the EV dual
j are maintained in the ascending order to the list
’P’ and ’Q’, respectively. In the same manner, the first (2-10)
lines of the algorithm represent the sorted list of the EV dual
j
according to the price pd
j ual announces by the EV dual
j on the
blockchain. Line (11) represents the energy needed (EV need
i )
by the EVs to fulfill the charging requirements. If m is less
than n, then variable k is updated with a value of m; otherwise
n (lines 12–16). After this, the dual-mode EVs are selected
from ’P’ one by one until all the EVs’ energy requirement is
fulfilled and they are scheduled (lines 17–22). The dual-mode
EVs in P, which was not scheduled during the considered time
slot is either scheduled at later time slots or are redirected to
other EVs having peak shaving requirements (lines 23–27).
Similarly, here, all the information is stored on the blockchain
network and the energy coins are transferred from EVs to the
dual-mode EVs’ wallet address after successful energy trading
between them.
C. Payment Process
Players are also given a payment based on the actions
performed by them during the game. This process has two
different scenarios; one for reward and another for a penalty.
The rewards are described for those EVs who have taken
energy from the CSs at their respective time slots and penalties
for those who have failed to arrive on their respective time
slots. The reward-penalty equation 13 between them in terms
of energy coins ECi is shown below.
ECi =
{
SCchr
i .Cd
i .α + ECold
i .β → reward
ECold
i .γ |γ �(0, 1)→ penalty
(13)
where α, β, γ are the constant parameters; SCchr
i is the state of
charge that the EVi draws from the C Sj ; Cd
i is the cost offered
by C Sj to charge the battery; ECold
i denotes the energy coins
of EVs until the previous iteration.
Some EVs have the capability to be involved in charging
or discharging since they have sufficient amount of state of
charge called the dual-mode EVs. Their state of charge SCdual
ranges between the minimum and maximum limits is as shown
in equation 14.
SCdual
min < SCdual < SCdual
max (14)
where, SCdual
min and SCdual
max are user-defined values of the state
of charge for EVs as per the requirements.
D. Complexity Analysis
The complexity analysis in terms of time complexity (TC)
and space complexity (SC) of the proposed algorithms is
described as follows.
1) Time Complexity: In Algorithm 1, power capacity is
computed for m CSs that takes O(m) time. After this, the
processing power is computed for n EVs that also takes O(n)
time. The assignment operators take linear time. Hence, TC of
this algorithm is given as follows:
T C = O(m)+ O(n) (15)

2290 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 24, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2023
In Algorithm 2, μp is computed for n EVs that takes O(n)
time. After this, a list of n EVs is sorted using insertion sort,
which consumes O(n2) time. Lines 16–18 take linear time
as these are assignment operations. From the ordered list of
EVs, the selection of confirmed time-slot EVs at CSs consume
O(n2) time (lines 22–31). The resource reservation of selected
EVs takes O(n) time. Hence, TC of this algorithm is given as
follows:
T C = O(n)+ O(n2)+ O(n2)+ O(n)
T C = O(n2) (16)
In Algorithm 3, the list P using insertion sort with the
worst-case complexity is O(n2). Assignment statements take
O(1) time. The computation, and scheduling of EVs takes O(n)
time. Thus, the TC of this algorithm is given as follows:
T C = O(n) + O(n2)+ O(1)
T C = O(n2) (17)
2) Space Complexity: In Algorithm 1, there is a total of two
lists and one structure. The size of these lists and structure
cannot exceed n, i.e., the number of EVs. Hence, SC of this
algorithm is given as follows:
SC = O(n)+ O(n)
SC = O(n) (18)
In Algorithm 2, there is a total of two lists and one structure.
The size of these lists and structure cannot exceed n, i.e.,
the number of EVs. Insertion sort used in the algorithm
takes minimum space complexity of O(n). The rest of the
algorithm uses assignment, calculation, and scheduling steps,
which takes O(1) space. Hence, SC of this algorithm is given
as follows:
SC = O(n) + O(n)+ O(n)+ O(n)+ O(1)
SC = O(n) (19)
In Algorithm 3, sorting takes space complexity of O(n).
A total of four lists have been used that take space of O(n).
All other calculations and assignments take O(1) space. Hence,
SC of this algorithm is given as follows:
SC = O(n)+ O(n)+ O(n)+ O(n) + O(n)+ O(1)
SC = O(n) (20)
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the simulation results and security
evaluation of the proposed energy trading model. The para-
meters used for simulation is described in Table II.
A. Numerical Results
This section presents the simulation-based numerical results
along with discussions about the results obtained. In the case
of energy management scenario, the considered EVs that
required charging energy compete with each other based on
their payoff values, which further depends on the state of
charging and energy coins (as mentioned in equation 9).

Similarly, in the peak shaving scenario, we have considered
the case study having four dual-mode EVs, i.e., EV1, EV2,
EV3, and EV4 from the dataset available at [55]. The cost
incurred by these EVs in the peak shaving process is shown
in Fig. 4, and the number of EVs utilized that required energy
from the dual-mode EVs is shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the
power exchanged between the dual-mode EVs and the energy

management and peak load control scenarios. The load tends
to get flattened with the increasing number of charging points.
Moreover, the power exchanged between the CSs and the
energy required EVs during energy transactions is shown in
Fig. 8. The tabular representation of CSs data is as shown in
Table IV.
With this, we have observed the price, energy, and cost
factors of an EV in both cases EV. For EV1 in first energy
management scenario, when EV acts as an energy consumer,
the seller’s price charged for an EV is shown in Fig. 9(a). The
energy sold to that EV is shown in Fig. 9(b), and the cost were
obtained from an EV in return to buy the energy is shown in
Fig. 9(c). Similarly, the results were obtained for EV1, when
EV acted as an energy supplier in a peak shaving scenario.
The price charged by an EV to sell the energy is dissipated
as shown in Fig. 10(a), and the observed sold energy is as
shown in Fig. 10(b). In return for energy trading, an EV gets
a profit, shown in Fig. 10(c). The tabular representation of
EV price, energy, and cost factors in both cases is shown in
Tables V and VI.
B. Security Evaluation
The security evaluation of the proposed blockchain-based
energy trading scheme in V2G networks has been presented
in this section. We have presented the security metrics such as
throughput, time, block preparation time, and PoW generation
time concerning the number of nodes and transactions.
For this, we have created blocks and added transactions

VI. CONCLUSION
EVs are an alternative to fuel cars and gaining popularity
because of reduced dependency on petrol and no harmful
emissions that pollute the environment. EVs, when connected
to the grid, act as either source or load according to the
requirement. This paper has presented a blockchain-based
energy trading scheme between the EVs and the CSs in a
green V2G environment. The proposed scheme selects the
miner nodes from the entities responsible for validating the
energy trading transaction between them. We employ a game
theory in energy trading that supports energy management
and peak load control scenarios during off-peak and peak
conditions, respectively, in a V2G environment. EVs have
charged and discharging capabilities that reduce carbon emis-
sions, a growing concern for a green V2G environment. The
proposed scheme has been tested for various parameters, and
its performance was found satisfactory. In future work, We will
consider edge computing, where computational resources are
distributed across network edges. As compared to centralized
cloud computing, edge computing is more suitable to handle
large-scale decentralized energy-trading transactions. Since the
computational tasks are processed near end-users, dispensable
network hops and transmission latency can be effectively
eliminated.
