Abstract—In this paper, we design, develop, and evaluate a
novel information sharing (iShare) framework for cybersecurity
with the goal of protecting confidential information and net-
worked infrastructures from future cyber-attacks. The proposed
iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in
Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate
for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to
secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for
financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is
a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications
accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-
based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution,
cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of
which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control
over any other organizations’ data or damage caused by cyber-
attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized
nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure
that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user
or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-
signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger
that has just hashed pointers. Moreover, we analyze the security
attacks by outsiders (not participating in the iShare) using a
Stackelberg game.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cyber-defense for prevention, detection, and response to
cyber-attacks is an ongoing challenge that needs efforts to
protect critical infrastructures and private information [1]–
[4]. Complexity and scale of cyberspace and heterogeneity of
networked systems make cybersecurity even more challeng-
ing. The cyber-threat information sharing across organizations
could help prevent future cyber-attacks [5], [6]. The goal
of low-cost, fair and privacy-aware information sharing for
cybersecurity is far from being met with today’s frameworks
[5], [6]. The best policy should be “if you see something,
say/report something” without revealing any private infor-
mation so that others can take informed decisions/actions.
Currently, different organizations/agencies hesitate to share
their cyber-threat information with other organizations because
of the following reasons: 1) absence of a common format
and framework for information exchange for cybersecurity [5],
[6]; 2) organizations are reluctant to share their information
because of reputation concerns in case of cyber-attacks caused
by negative publicity [7] and privacy concerns [8]; 3) rival
organizations/agencies may misuse the shared information for

their own rational/competitive advantages [6]; and 4) organi-
zations may not see any immediate benefits of sharing their
information for cybersecurity. The ITU-T Study Group 17
(SG17), consisting of cybersecurity experts, policy makers,
governments and industry, has announced its cybersecurity
information exchange framework [5] to enhance security in a
global scale, leaving information sharing mechanisms open to
researchers. There are few efforts in information sharing (e.g.,
[9], [10]) and in healthcare through the Fast Healthcare In-
teroperability Resources (FHIR) framework [11], [12], which
is not applicable to our problem. Other works include in the
area of Internet of Things (IoT) [13], privacy-risk control in
healthcare, [14] and security in decentralized file/data storage
[15], [16]. However, none of these works consider information
sharing among organizations for combating cyber-attacks.
In this paper, we design, develop and evaluate a novel cy-
bersecurity (i.e., cyber-threat and defense) information sharing
(iShare, in short) framework for different organizations to
protect their networked systems and infrastructures from future
cyber-attacks. We propose to use the concept of Blockchain
that is used in Bitcoin [17] system for privacy-aware infor-
mation sharing and analyze the malicious actions using game
theoretic approaches [18]–[20]. Note that the Bitcoin [17], [20]
for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is
a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications
accompanied by a public ledger. While sharing the informa-
tion in the iShare framework, any identifiable information is
anonymized, and only the summary (e.g., name and signature
of the malware/virus) and cyber-defense solutions are shared
with others through iShare. Note that, in all traditional data
sharing applications, either we need to transfer bulky data to
other organizations or we need a centralized unit to collect
data. Centralization requires a single trust authority and poses
a severe bottleneck problem. Transfer of bulky data could suf-
fer significantly from limited bandwidth, and the organizations
may loose their control over their own data and privacy. Be-
cause there is no universal authoritative standard, information
sharing for interoperability to cross the institutional boundaries
is a non-trivial task. Interoperability in the context of iShare
framework is considered for structure/definition, semantics,
and recommendations (such as cyber-defense solutions) nec-
essary for protecting networked systems and infrastructures
from future cyber-attacks. The iShare framework constantly
collects high resolution cyber-attack information of which the
organizations or users have no specific knowledge or control

over any other organizations’ data or damage caused by cyber-
attacks.
II. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF BITCOIN AND BLOCKCHAIN
Bitcoin (developed by a programmer known as Satoshi
Nakamoto − a name believed to be an alias) is based on
cryptographic techniques that allows the recipient to receive
money securely/genuinely without requiring a trusted third
party, such as a bank or a company like PayPal [17], [21].
The Bitcoin network relies on a Blockchain − a distributed
transaction public ledger − where a new block is generated
by executing a consensus algorithm such as Proof-of-Work
[17]. A Bitcoin client software helps users to connect to
a decentralized network of other Bitcoin users through the
Internet securely. It is reported in [17], [21] that the Bitcoin
system is unbreakable since the mathematics involved in the
Bitcoin ensures that the transactions can be easily verified, but
it is practically impossible to generate malicious transactions
to spend somebody else’s Bitcoins.
III. THE BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ISHARE FRAMEWORK
The proposed iShare framework (shown in Fig. 1) uses
Blockchain protocol over the public Internet as suggested/used
in [16], [17]. In the iShare framework, three entities are as fol-
lows: organizations participating in sharing cyber-attack infor-
mation to prevent future cyber-attacks; services, the providers
of such cyber-attack related information and applications
who process data; and manager nodes, trusted devices that
maintain the Blockchain and distributed cryptographic keys.
It is important to note that the organizations participating in
information sharing system use changeable public keys and
otherwise remain anonymous1, but the Blockchain managers
could store service profiles on the Blockchain and verify their
identities.
In the proposed framework, the Blockchain accepts two
types of transactions: 1) Taccs transaction for access control
management; and 2) Tinfo, for information storage and re-
trieval. These transactions could be provided to organization
1Hiding identity or private information of the participating organization,
particularity in case of cyberattack, could save them from any socioeco-
nomic/reputation damages caused by the cyber-attacks.

through application program interfaces (APIs) that can be used
during the software development process. A typical work-flow
illustration is as follows. Each participating organization uses
the proposed framework to share the information for preserv-
ing their privacy (possibly using web-based dashboard for an
access as in Bitcoin [17]). When the given organization signs
up, a new identity and associated permissions are generated
and sent to the Blockchain using Tacc transaction. Cyber-attack
information that is to be shared is encrypted using a shared
encryption key and sent to the Blockchain using Tinfo trans-
action. While retrieving the information by a service or a user
by querying the data using Tinfo transaction, only a pointer
to the data on the public ledger is used. The Blockchain, with
the help of the digital signature, verifies the organization and
services. This approach for sharing information using iShare
just tells whether the given organization detected any cyber-
attack and would like to share, but it does not tell whether
the cyber-attack was successful to damage the organization’s
networked systems/infrastructures or how much damage it
caused if the cyber-attack was successful.
IV. THE BLOCKCHAIN BASED PROPOSED APPROACH
A. Blockchain and Transaction Process in iShare Framework
A typical Blockchain in iShare framework is shown in Fig.
2, which is composed of blocks with transactions. Blocks
are practically impossible to manipulate without being caught
since they are chained together using a hash, or a numeric
digest of its content as shown in Fig. 2, that can be used to
verify the integrity of the transactions. Furthermore, the hash
of a block (say a block n) depends on its predecessor (say
block n − 1), as shown in Fig. 2, that makes the Blockchain
immutable by malicious actions because a change in one block
would require changes in the following blocks.

Fig. 2. A typical structure of the Blockchain [17] in iShare.
Organizations in the iShare framework, participate collabo-
ratively to create a Blockchain by verifying and storing new
transactions into it. Both the digital signature and an existence
of the previous transaction in the same ledger are used to
verify the legitimacy of the transactions in Blockchain . A
new block is generated by executing a consensus algorithm
such as Proof-of-Attack-Detection (PoAD) (see Section IV-B)
similar to the Proof-of-Work [17]. The BM or GBM2 then

(based on their business MoU) as a block manager and named as a group
block manager (GBM). The gateway of each organization (e.g., org. 2 and
org. 3) will be connected to a GBM as shown in Fig. 1, and GBM maintains
the public key.

creates a new block and forwards it to other BMs for block
verification, which allows all BMs to at least contribute
to a transaction to digitally sign the block to endorse its
correctness. Then, the block is returned to the original BM,
which then adds the block to its local Blockchain. Finally,
a new Blockchain is distributed to all nodes in the sys-
tem. The proposed Blockchain network comprises different
organizations including equipment manufacturers, computers,
operating system/software providers, security patch or anti-
virus providers, IDS/IPS service providers, and cloud storage
providers or devices such as laptops, cell phones, tablets,
cyber-physical system devices, and IoT devices.
In the iShare framework, software/anti-virus providers and
computers or IoT-devices of a given organization can share
the data in a distributed manner (as in Fig 1). In case of
many similar devices (e.g., computers) in a given organization,
a block manager BM is chosen, and it manages the public
Blockchain to store iShare transactions. Furthermore, each
organization with private networked systems (e.g., computer
network, smart building network, etc.) maintain a private,
centrally managed Blockchain, aka private ledger, containing
all transactions related to the given organization. Then, the
private ledger is linked to the block manager, BM, by using
a hash that contains the hash of the public Blockchain . Note
that each organization is centrally managed by a trusted device
known as a local manager, which is integrated in the Internet
gateway and maintains a local private ledger that connects the
organization to iShare network. All communications to and
from the organization are routed through the local manager
that is integrated in the Internet gateway. This assumption is
closely analogous to Port Address Translation (PAT) or Net-
work Address Translation (NAT) in traditional IPv4 networks.
B. Cyber-Attack Detection and Sharing the Information
Each organization is assumed to be responsible for deploy-
ing the recent updates, security patches, and updated operating
systems based on Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) standard
for all devices [22], firewalls and IDS/IPS (e.g., [3], [23],
[24]), and for sharing the detected cyber-attack information
or attack-signature (with possible countermeasures) through
iShare framework3. This sharing is done through Blockchain
after verifying the attack with the help of equipment manu-
facturer, operating systems and/or anti-virus developers that
are participating in iShare. For instance, attack detected by
an organization that had Microsoft Windows 8 with firewall
and Norton anti-virus on Dell computers should be verified
through Blockchain by Microsoft, Dell and Norton companies
to reach to the consensuses. This process is known as PoAD.
This process is initiated first by the organization who detects
an attack, and it is considered as a source of information.
To avoid duplicate reporting (in case of two or more or-
ganizations detecting the same attack at the same time and
reporting it through Blockchain ), cloud storage chooses the
one who has countermeasure, if any, and discards the rest.
Once the cyber-defense solution is available to the cloud

treated as a malicious agent/organization since it is indirectly helping attackers
or is not helping to secure the system from possible attacks.
storage, it is published like other software or updates so that
all organizations can download and deploy to protect their
networks/infrastructures as discussed in Section IV-C.
In this setup, malicious organizations are those who do
not participate in a timely and positive way in Share. For
instance, 1) anti-virus companies who do not develop security
patches to known vulnerabilities or create viruses in order to
sell their anti-virus product and 2) operating system developers
who leave known loopholes or back-doors open for a long
time without providing security patches, are also regarded as
malicious organizations.
C. Deploying Cyber-Defense Solutions and Updates
Deploying robust cyber-defense solutions to prevent cyber-
attacks is one of the most critical security challenges in any
networked systems. In iShare, when a given software provider
creates a new version or a patch, it initiates the process for
sharing/transferring using Blockchain by considering it as a
source to store the updates software/patches in the cloud that is
accessible to all participating organizations. Then, the software
provider creates a multi-signature transaction where its own
part 1 key and signature (generated using signed hash) are
stored. The software binary file is assumed to be stored in the
cloud for users to download. Thus, the hash can be verified
by the other participating devices to ensure the data integrity.
The key of the equipment manufacturer is written in the part
2 field of the transaction. To forward the received update to
all devices or networks within the organization, both keys
and signatures for part 1 and 2 of Blockchain should be
matched. Otherwise, it is forwarded to other organizations’
gateways. Upon receiving the transaction from the gateway
of a given organization, each networked device verifies it
by matching the key in the transaction with its equipment
manufacturer’s key. For a legitimate software update, network
or networked devices download the software updates directly
from the cloud using authentication parameters available in
metadata of the received multisignature transaction, as shown
in Fig. 2. The signed hash of both the software provider
and equipment manufacturer can be used to verify that it
was not altered. Similarly, when a cyber-attack is detected by
one of the participating organizations, which is then verified
using Blockchain with the help of an equipment manufacturer,
operating system and/or anti-virus developers participating in
iShare, the attack threat information as well as cyber-defense
solutions (if developed or available) are shared, which will
then be stored in the cloud-based information base of iShare.
V. ANALYSIS OF CYBER-ATTACK/DEFENSE GAMES
A. Cross-Group Attack Game in Blockchain-based iShare
Framework: One-Way Attack
In an iShare framework, similar organizations, such as
airlines (Delta, American, KLM, Thai, Virgin Airlines, etc.),
hospitals (public and private), hardware/software companies
(Microsoft, HP and Dell), banks (Bank of America, Citi Bank,
DB), etc., can form a Group and work together for the group’s
benefit that provides profit to them individually.
For the sake of simplicity, we consider two groups: Group
1 and Group 2, with N1 and N2 (total N = N1 + N2 + ...)
number of member organizations, respectively, sharing their

cyber-attack information through the iShare framework. The
benefit utility they achieve in a group is shared among group
members when they work in a group. Although motivated by
the Blockchain-based Bitcoin systems, there is no immediate
reward/payment for organizations individually, but they get
rewarded equally after completion of a task [17], [20].
Some group members (say from Group 2) could form a
sub-group (could be sub-group of just one organization) and
act as an organization to cross-participate in another group
(say Group 1) or not participate in legitimate block formation
in their own Group 2 by not releasing the detected cyber-
attack information or by not developing a security patch for
a known security breach. The aim of the one-way attack is to
reduce the utility/interest of Group 1 by using sub-group of
X2→1 (≤N2) members from Group 2, where X2→1 members
of Group 2 could try to hinder the Blockchain building process.
For Blockchain-based iShare, the direct utilities of group k can
be expressed as
Uk = log(σk + γk), k = 1, 2, (1)
where log(σk + γk) is a generic convex function of γk for
each group k and typical value of σk = 1. X2→1 members of
Group 2 participate in Group 1, who are considered malicious
members since they do not participate in their own group but
participate in another group. In this case, the total number of
organizations who legitimately participate in the Blockchain
process is N −X2→1. Then, γ1, i.e., the quality factor in (1)
of the Blockchain generation process for the Group 1 can be
expressed as
γ1 =
N1
N1 + (N2 −X2→1)
=
N1
N −X2→1
. (2)
For Group 2, X2→1 members do not participate in the process,
leaving N2 −X2→1 organizations in the group. Thus, γ2, i.e.,
the quality factor in (1) of the Blockchain-generation process
for the Group 2 can be expressed as
γ2 =
N2 −X2→1
N1 + (N2 −X2→1)
=
N2 −X2→1
N −X2→1
. (3)
As mentioned earlier, there is no mechanism to reward the
legitimate members only, all members of a given group
and cross-participating members get rewards equally. Thus,
the Group 1 members share their utility with its legitimate
members and the members from Group 2 that intruded it. Next,
the utility density for Group 1 can be expressed as
u1 =
U1
N1 +X2→1
=
log
(
1 + N1
N−X2→1
)
N1 +X2→1
(4)
Similarly, the utility density for Group 2 after considering the
contributions of X2→1 (ı.e., X2→1 × u1 as in [17], [20]) can
be expressed as
u2 =
U2 + X2→1 × u1

log(
N2−X2→1
N−X2→1
) + X2→1
log
(
1+

N−X2→1
)
N1+X2→1

(5)
For finite number of organizations participating in iShare, the
game always has a Nash equilibrium with X2→1 value, where
∂u1
∂X2→1
= 0, and
∂u2
∂X2→1

Fig. 3. Variation of expected utility vs the number of cross-group participants,
where N = 16 organizations/users are equally divided into two groups.
To evaluate the performance of the game, we simulated a
scenario with a different number of cross-group participants,
X2→1, where N = 16 organizations/users are equally divided
into two groups. Fig. 3 shows the variation of group utilities
of two groups for different number of organizations, X2→1,
participating in cross-group activities. When X2→1 increases,
the utility of Group 1 decreases until 50% of the organizations
cross-participate. However, the utility increases for group 2
because they get rewards from both cross-group participation
and their own group as shown in Fig. 3. When all group
members of group 2 cross-participate in group 1, that is,
X2→1 = N2, they get the contribution of the subgroup, which
is less than they get from legitimate participation. Thus, we
could conclude that the best response is not to participate in
cross-group activities, but a dominant strategy of the game
would be cross-group participation with all members of the
group.
B. Cross-Group Attack Game in Blockchain-Based iShare
Framework: Two-Way Attack
In this attack, a sub-group of Group 1 of size X1→2 < N1
acts maliciously or participates in Group 2, and a sub-group of
Group 2 of size X2→1 < N2 acts maliciously or participates
in Group 1. The direct utility of group k can be expressed as
U ′
k = log(1 + γ′
k), k = 1, 2, (7)
where γ′
k can be calculated as follows.
γ′
k =
Nk −
∑
∀j Xk→j
N −
∑
∀j Xk→j −
∑
∀j Xj→k
(8)
Here, Xk→j , and Xj→k represent the total number of cross-
participating organizations from group k to j and j to k
respectively. When we consider two groups k = 1, 2, we have
γ
′

N2 − X2→1
(N1 − X1→2) + (N2 − X2→1)

(10)
Total utility is divided among participating organizations, that
is, members of a given group and members of sub-groups
that are cross-participating from other groups. Then, the utility
density for the group k can be expressed as

k =

As players are allowed to play a mixed strategy and the number
of players N1 and N2 are finite, the game always has a Nash
equilibrium with X1→2 and X2→1 values, where

= 0 and
∂u′

= 0 (16)
This game with rational players looks like a zero-sum game,
where loss (or gain) in one group’s utility is proportional to the
gain (or loss) of the other group’s utility. For a two-way, cross-
group participation game, the strategy space of the players can
be defined as S = {Do not attack, Attack}. The outcome of
the game and (dominant) strategies for both groups/players
are summarized in Table I and are also summarized with an
example of values in Fig. 4, where utilities with ‘attack’ and
‘no attack’ are denoted as u
′′
k and u
′
k for k = 1, 2, respectively.
Utilities of both groups would be higher if they choose not to
attack, however, the dominant strategies for both groups are
to attack.

tions participate in iShare framework, but some of them
act maliciously to contribute negatively by not sharing the
known attack information with other participating organiza-
tions. However, in many cases, attackers do not participate
in the information sharing process at all but just launch the
cyber-attacks − these attackers are regarded as outsiders.
Without loss of generality, based on the past attacks and
success rate of the recovery from the attacks, the security
level of an organization k can be considered as 0 ≤ ℓk ≤ 1,
∀k (where security level is directly proportional to a system
hardening investment of the organization and the average
security level of the organization (among N organizations)
can be expressed as ℓk = 1
N
∑N
k=1
ℓk. Next, the probability
of cyber-attacks for a given organization k can be expressed
as pk = (1− ℓk)(1− ℓk), ∀k.
These cyber-attacks and defense actions can be modeled
as a game to study conflicting strategies. A typical multi-
agent game for cybersecurity can be formulated as follows.
Attackers take malicious actions to attack the organizations
based on defenders’/organizations’ strategies. Then, the de-
fending organizations to defend attacks take actions based
on attackers strategies and share the detected cyber-attack
information through the iShare. This game can be formulated
as a Stackelberg game with leader and follower sub-games
[18], [19]. Note that organizations are expected to follow the
government and industry standard practices for hardening their
networked systems based on the recent attacks and known
vulnerabilities. Thus, in the proposed Stackelberg game, le-
gitimate organizations are treated as followers since they act
on cyber-attacks or known vulnerabilities and the attackers are
treated as the leaders who attack the organizations’ networked
information systems.
Defenders/Follower Sub-Game: In this sub-game, followers
try to minimize the effect of any cyber-attack by hardening the
networked information system and sharing the known cyber-
attack information. Based on security level and investment of
a given organization, an attacker chooses a strategy ak, ∀k
with the expected level of security impact im,k to a victim
organization k. Then, the organization may suffer from the
attack or may not, which depends on both impact level im,k
and organization’s socioeconomic tolerance level. Thus, for a
given organization k, the goal is to minimize the attack impact
that can be achieved by solving the following optimization
problem:
minimize
Ψk,pk,∀k
OUk
= pkSkβk log(1 + Ψk)
subject to
∑
∀m
im,kΨk ≤ Bk;
im,k ≥ 0; ∀m, ∀k;
Ψk ≥ Ψk; ∀k;
Sk ∈ {1, 0}, sk > 0, and ck > 0; ∀k,
(17)
where Bk is the maximum tolerable socioeconomic (reputation
and budget) level for the organization k because of the cyber-
attacks, im,k is the targeted impact level of cyber-attack m to
a given organization k using an attack strategy ak, Ψk ≥ Ψk
is each organization’s investment level constraint for cyber-
defense that accommodates the cost of hardening the system
and sharing the cyber-attack information through iShare etc.,
Sk is the binary strategy set (i.e., share = 1 or not share = 0, but
we consider that legitimate organization share the information,
thus, Sk = 1), sk > 0 and ck > 0, respectively, represent the
cost of sharing the information and cost of participating in
the information sharing through iShare. When sk and ck are
incorporated in the investment Ψk, these constraints can be
relaxed. The βk is the utility scaling factor, and, without loss
of generality, we consider βk = 1 for simplicity. Then, the

problem (17) can be expressed as
minimize
Ψk,pk,∀k
OUk
= pk log(1 + Ψk)
subject to
∑
∀m
im,kΨk ≤ Bk;
im,k ≥ 0; ∀m, ∀k;
Ψk ≥ Ψk; ∀k;
(18)
The problem (18) is convex in Ψk, and thus the problem
has unique optimal solution. We can solve the problem (18)
using Lagrangian method. Let us consider λ1, λ2 and λ3 as
Lagrange’s multipliers for different constraints in (18). Then,
we can express the Lagrangian equivalent of (18) as
LOUk
= pk log(1 + Ψk)− λ1
(
∑
∀m
im,kΨk −Bk
)
+λ2 (im,k − 0) + λ3
(
Ψk −Ψk
)
(19)
and the complementary Slackness conditions for (19) are
λ1
(
∑
∀m
im,kΨk −Bk
)
= 0, (20)
λ2(im,k − 0) = 0, (21)
λ3
(
Ψk −Ψk
)
= 0, (22)
λ1 > 0, λ2 ≥ 0, λ3 ≥ 0, (23)
where λ2 = 0 since im,k of an attack should be greater than
zero, otherwise there is no point of attacking the organization,
and λ3 ≥ 0 since there should be minimum investment for
cyber-defense, Ψk ≥ Ψk, for protecting the organization. The
first-order optimality of (19) can be obtained by differentiating
LOUk
w.r.t. Ψk and equating it to zero; that is,
∂LOUk
∂Ψk
= 0, ∀k ⇒
pk
1 + Ψk
−λ1
∑
∀m
im,k+λ3 = 0.
(24)
When investment level is greater than the minimum investment
level, we have λ3 = 0. Then, (24) can be expressed as
Ψk =
pk
λ1
∑
∀m im,k
− 1 (25)
By substituting (25) into (20), after few steps, we get
λ1 =
pk
∑
∀m im,k +Bk
(26)
After substituting (26) into (25), we get
Ψk =
∑
∀m im,k +Bk
Kim,k
− 1, ∀k, (27)
which is the best response of the follower sub-game for the
given attack strategies.
Attacker/Leader Sub-Game: Next, attackers attack the orga-
nizations without cooperating with each other with an aim of
halting the service provided by the victim organization, gain-
ing unauthorized access to private information or gaining eco-
nomical benefits. The non-cooperative attacker game (AG) can
be represented as AG = 〈K, {Ak}k∈K,Uk(.)〉, where three
components of the game are as follows: K = {1, 2, . . . ,K} is
the set of active players/attackers where each attacker could
attack a single or multiple organizations; Ak is the set of at-
tacking strategies {a1, ak, ..., aK}; and Uk(.) : {A1×..×AK}
is the utility/payoff given in (28) that maps strategy spaces to
a positive real number. Then, the utility optimization problem
for an attacker with a strategy ak can be expressed as
maximize
ak,∀k
AUm
(ak,a−k) =
N
∑
k=1
pk(1− im,k(ak))(1−Ψk)
(28)
subject to {ak} 6= ∅, ∀k,
im,k ≥ im,k ≥ 0, ∀m, ∀k.
pk > 0, ∀k.
(29)
Here, {ak} 6= ∅ implies that there should be at least one
attack strategy to maximize attacker’s utility. The attack impact
maximization problem (28) can be solved by Lagrangian
method by expressing (28) with its constraints in (29) and
taking the first derivative and equating it to zero to get
the impact level value. Then, for an iterative approach, the
expected impact level of a attack can be updated as in (30).
As discussed earlier, in this paper, we consider that launching a
cyber-attack ak against a given organization is accompanied by
the following: 1) denial-of-service attack, i.e., halting regular
business operations rb = [0, 1] (attack in the computer system
of airline company could result in flight cancellations/delays,
etc.); 2) cause slow response to customers’/users’ requests
rd = [0, 1]; and 3) reduction in reputation of a given or-
ganization rr = [0, 1]. Thus, the expected impact level of a
cyber-attack m to a given organization k (i.e., attack ak) can
be expressed as
im,k(ak) = max{ηm,krb(m, k) + θm,krd(m, k) + µm,krr(m, k) − ℓk, im,k}
(30)
where 0 ≤ ηm,k ≤ 1, 0 ≤ θm,k ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ µm,k ≤ 1 are the
weighting factors for halting regular business operations, caus-
ing slowness in responding to customers’/users’ requests and
reduction in reputation levels, respectively, due to the cyber-
attack m by taking an attack action ak to victim organization
k. Note that when the expected impact level in (30) is 0 or
negative, there is no point of targeting an organization by a
cyber-attack. im,k = 1 is the maximum. level. We corroborate
the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point through
simulation results in the following section.
Performance Evaluation: In order to corroborate our analy-
sis, we set up 1) a simulation scenario with four organizations
with different security and investment levels, and 2) an attacker
with four different expected attack impact levels. To see the
variation in results, we consider an iterative approach where an
attacker, with different random attack levels, starts attacking
four organizations with Bk = 0.1, ∀k and random initial secu-
rity levels. Then, organizations start calculating their utilities
based on their security levels, cyber-defense and investment
levels, and attacker’s expected impact. The maximum effective
attack-impact levels could be one or 100%, but we consider
for simulation that im,k = {0.27, 0.26, 0.24, 0.25}.
We have plotted the utilities of four different organizations
vs iterations, security/investment levels vs iterations, attacker’s

expected impact levels vs iterations, and attacker’s utilities
for different expected attack-impact levels vs iterations, as
shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8, respectively. Fig.
5 shows that the organizations’ expected utilities decrease for
increasing iterations because of the increasing attack-impact
levels from the attacker for a given security and investment
level as shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, increase in attack-impact
levels from the attacker results in a decrease in security level of
the organizations for the given investment levels, as shown in
Fig. 6. Attackers take different actions ak with different attack-
impact levels for different victim organizations, as shown in
Fig. 7. Fig. 7 shows that organization 3 has the lowest expected
attack impact from the attacker that results in the highest
security level for a given investment of the organization, as
shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, Fig. 8 shows that the attacker
gets the highest (or lowest) utility with the highest (or lowest)
attack-impact level for organization 1 (or organization 3) that
had the lowest (or highest) security and investment level as
shown in Fig. 5. Simulation results show that the game has the
uniqueness equilibrium point where the game has converged.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied an information sharing
(iShare) framework for multiple organizations to protect them
from future cyber-attacks. The proposed framework leverages
the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin system (aka a trusted,
auditable public ledger) to enhance data integrity and pro-
tecting privacy. The Blockchain-based iShare ensures that the
participating organizations (i.e., agents/users) own and control
their data without requiring a trusted third party for security
and privacy. We have analyzed games where some of the par-
ticipating organizations act maliciously to mislead the cyber-
defense or get benefit from the system by cross-participation.
We have also presented a Stackelberg game-based cyber-attack
and defense analysis when outsiders attack the organizations.
We have formally analyzed the games and validated them
through numerical results obtained from extensive simulations.
