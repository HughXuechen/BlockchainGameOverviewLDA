Abstract—Since haptic communications have an extreme
requirement for the latency performance, the overdue content
delivery will decrease the application experience. In order to
reduce the transmission delay, we try to construct a cache-
enabled D2D-assisted content-sharing framework, where the
neighboring helpers preset contents and adjust their transmission
power to timely serve more requesters. In particular, we mod-
ify the existing definition of the “closest” friend and take the
social relationship into account to measure the overall influence
caused by available neighboring helpers. However, such cooper-
ation consumes the storage space and energy of the helpers, and
accordingly, we introduce blockchain technology to propose an
effective incentive mechanism where the helpers act as consensus
users of blockchain and obtain the reward, i.e., the allocated com-
puting power by the base station (BS), by contributing their local
resources. Guided by this, the benefit of each helper is defined
as a tradeoff of the reward and overheads. Meanwhile, we for-
mulate the multiuser content delivery problem with the goal of
maximizing the global benefits as the multiuser content delivery
game. Then, we prove that the proposed game is an exact poten-
tial game (EPG) with at least one pure-strategy Nash equilibrium
(NE). Meanwhile, the context-aware content delivery-based con-
current better reply (CCDCBR) algorithm is proposed to achieve
a desirable solution. Finally, simulation results verify the validity
of the proposed game model as well as the proposed algorithm.

of haptic feedback which consists of tactile perception and
kinesthetic perception [2]. Through haptic feedback, mobile
users can intuitively feel force caused by the external envi-
ronment and understand the texture of unknown objects [3].
Take remote surgery as an example, the doctor can sense and
analyze the state of an illness of the remote patient by the hap-
tic device. Thus, these advantages have given birth to haptic
communications.
However, haptic communications are still in the beginning
stage. The key problem in haptic communications is 1-ms
challenge [4]. That is, experiencers must accept the haptic
feedback within 1 ms, which is decided by the perception of
human. Due to the fact that transmission delay is dominant
in a round-trip latency, the quick content response by content
delivery can decrease the transmission delay. Hence, studying
the timely and reliable content delivery is of importance for
haptic communications.
The traditional centralized data storage structure is no longer
applicable. That is due to the following facts.
1) A huge massive IoT devices or sensors are deployed to
collect related audio, video, and even haptic information,
and they update the related information periodically by
delivering such information from the sensor layer to the
storage layer constantly. As such, the amount of data in
the storage layer will be enormous as time goes by.
2) The storage structure influences the content response
speed. Once the storage location of desired documents
is far away from the requester, the service delay will be
longer.
A promising solution to address the above challenge is
the distributed cache [5]–[7]. Through this technology, related
data is cached in nearby users, i.e., neighbors. When some
users want to obtain heat documents, they can get files
from their neighbors via Device-to-Device (D2D) communi-
cations [8]–[10], which enable to decrease the service delay
and improve the service quality.
Although distributed cache can improve the response speed,
the successful content delivery mainly depends on the local
content cache and suitable transmission power. An effective
content preset can be realized by the distributed cache so that
the desirable contents are in the proximity of requesters. The
transmission power not only influences the content delivery
performance of D2D links but also decides the selection of
requesters’ “closest” friend, a neighbor with strong transmis-
sion performance. Thus, it can be seen that both the distributed

cache and power control can improve the content delivery.
Unfortunately, most works only focus on the distributed cache
or power control, the joint optimization is ignored. When
studying the joint optimization, the great challenge is explor-
ing the mutual relationship between the distributed cache and
power control.
More significantly, most of the existing works,
e.g., [11]–[13], assume that neighbors/helpers are altruistic
and helpful to share their documents without remuneration.
Nevertheless, this assumption is against the fact, that is, since
these helpers in reality are selfish and rational, and they
have limited energy [14], [15], no neighbor wants to share
its local contents with the requesters at the cost of energy
consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective
incentive mechanism where the helpers are willing to help
others realize the content delivery by caching and adjusting
their power.
To make the proposed incentive mechanism suitable for the
distributed storage of haptic communications, we introduce
blockchain to design the incentive mechanism. Blockchain is
regarded as a distributed public ledger without a centralized
trust mechanism [18]–[20]. Instead, the trust mechanism of
blockchain is maintained by multiple consensus users who
conduct the consensus mechanism, i.e., Proof of Work (PoW)
protocol [21], to achieve the consensus state. Once data are
written into the blockchain, this behavior will be recorded
and the written data, e.g., transaction time and transaction
fee, cannot be tampered forever, which protects the security
of transaction information. However, the operation of PoW
involves the solution of a math puzzle, which needs a cer-
tain computing power. The computing power of consensus
users, i.e., relative power, is allocated by the base station
(BS) according to a certain principle. Therefore, there exists a
great difficulty in designing the incentive mechanism, which
is presented as follows.
1) How to Associate Blockchain With the Distributed
Cache: When the neighbors act as consensus users of
blockchain, they have computing demand while others
have content demand. The real goal is to realize the
cooperation of neighbors for local content sharing. The
focus of the incentive mechanism is that consensus users
can get a certain computing resource by contributing
their local resources.
2) How to Guarantee Fairness in the Incentive Mechanism:
The fairness among users should be strictly guaranteed,
which involves the construction of a reward function. In
a reasonable incentive mechanism, the rewards of users
are proportional to their efforts. This design is helpful to
the fair competition of users who aim to obtain a higher
reward by adjusting their decisions.
B. Related Work
In this section, we review the related existing works and
summarize them as the following categories.
1) Haptic Communications and Distributed Cache:
The research of haptic communications is still in the
beginning [22]. The definition of Tactile Internet and hap-
tic communications is given in [23] where Tactile Internet
is “a network of networks.” In [24], the wearable sensor as
a haptic device is used to collect the skin information of
patients to predict the hydration level by machine learning.
She et al. [25] studied the cross-layer transmission design and
proposed a proactive packet dropping mechanism, which aims
to guarantee the QoS requirements. Meanwhile, Wei et al. [26]
innovatively combined the haptic communications with smart
city and developed a Tactile Internet framework for a smart
city. The work in [27] and [28] introduced human-in-the-loop
mobile networks and studied the radio resource allocation in
haptic communications. Specifically, to analyze the mutual
relationships of cross-modal signals, Zhou et al. [29] proposed
the cross-modal collaborative communications and developed
a cross-modal data reconstruction architecture.
Aijaz et al. [30] investigated the significance of timely
demand response in haptic communications. When requesters
cannot get the service, the experiencers of haptic applications
will feel the obvious “cyber-sickness,” i.e., the bad game expe-
rience. Najeh and Bouallegue [31] proposed a mode selection
approach involving the cellular and D2D users, and investi-
gated the distributed power control from a game-theoretical
approach. However, this work ignores the influence of local
resources on power control which is not suitable in this arti-
cle. Sukhmani et al. [32] pointed out that the distributed
cache can improve the service performance of haptic appli-
cations, i.e., AR/VR. Some information, e.g., the background
information, may be requested repeatedly by the haptic appli-
cations. Thus, users share their local content resources between
neighbors to timely respond to the demand of requesters.
Finally, it will greatly shorten the service delay of haptic
applications. Nevertheless, the cooperation willingness is not
discussed in [32].
Meanwhile, the performance of service response is
related to the match of content responders and requesters.
Yang et al. [34], ElSawy et al. [35], and Jo et al. [36] explored
the establishment of the service relationships. In their proposed
system model, a closest friend of requesters with content
demands is defined to provide the timely content delivery ser-
vice. However, the above studies only characterize the friend
relationships from the perspective of the physical factor. The
social relationship between the requester and content respon-
der is ignored but important. Thus, the definition of the closest
friend should be redesigned.
2) Blockchain in the Incentive Mechanism: Although there
exist great advantages when introducing the distributed cache,
most of the existing works ignore the fact that users are ratio-
nal and selfish in practice. Thus, from a practical point of
view, we should take the selfishness of users into account and
redesign the cooperation mechanism.
Currently, a few works have been conducted where the
blockchain technology is introduced to motivate adjacent users
to share their local resources. Wang et al. [37] used the smart
contracts of blockchain to develop a content caching market
where the cache helpers are motivated to keep active in service.
Seng et al. [38] established a blockchain-based platform where
requesters with content demands are matched with responders

by the proposed matching algorithm. Liu et al. [39] proposed
a wireless blockchain framework where the computation task
of miners can be offloaded to nearby nodes and the block
data can be cached into the edge server. An innovative proac-
tive caching scheme was proposed based on the hierarchical
blockchain framework in [40], where the total system con-
sists of two layers and each layer keeps one unique ledger.
Cui et al. [41] investigated the relationships between the allo-
cated computing power and the size of shared contents, finally
proposed a blockchain-based caching placement scheme.
Thus, these existing works reflect the fact: the blockchain
technology is a promising way to solve the problem of the
incentive mechanism in content delivery networks. However,
when the blockchain is applied in haptic communications, the
new challenge emerges. For example, from the perspective of
consensus users, how to design the reasonable utility func-
tion to associate the decisions with the benefits or rewards of
blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, the combination
of haptic communications and blockchain has not been well
investigated in the existing works.
C. Main Contributions
In this article, we investigated the content delivery problem
in haptic communications to achieve a quick content response.
The contributions of this article can be summarized as follows.
1) We propose a cache-enabled D2D-assisted content-
sharing framework where transmission delay can be
decreased by timely content delivery in haptic commu-
nications. To overcome the selfishness of neighbors, we
design an effective blockchain-based incentive mecha-
nism as shown in Fig. 1. The focus is that helpers act
as consensus users and share their local resources to
receive the reward, i.e., the computing power allocated
by the system. Meanwhile, the definition of the closest
friend is modified by integrating with the social relation-
ship to measure the overall influence caused by available
neighboring helpers.
2) In the above context, we model the distributed cache
and power control as a multiuser content delivery game,
whose goal is to maximize the individual benefits, i.e., a
tradeoff of the received expected revenue and overheads
caused by energy and storage consumption, by making
the 2-D decisions. Different from the traditional local
altruistic game, we extend it to the potential cooperation
game. In the proposed game, the potential cooperation

neighbors are considered to analyze the resource com-
petition between multiple users. Meanwhile, we prove
the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) points in our
proposed game, which is an exact potential game (EPG).
The corresponding NE points are the solution to the
optimization problem.
3) We propose the context-aware content delivery-based
concurrent better reply (CCDCBR) algorithm to find the
desired solution. To make the proposed algorithm suit-
able for the 2-D decisions, we modify the better reply
algorithm and introduce the concept of concurrent exe-
cution into it to improve the performance of the proposed
algorithm, i.e., increase the convergence rate.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
We present the system model and problem formulation in
Section II. Next, we formulate the multiuser content deliv-
ery game in Section III. Then, the proposed algorithm is
given in Section IV. Finally, the related simulation results and
conclusion are presented in Sections V and VI, respectively.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
We consider an edge cache scenario in haptic communica-
tions. As shown in Fig. 2, there exists a BS equipped with
an edge cloud to provide communication service. Meanwhile,

TABLE I
KEY VARIABLES USED IN THIS ARTICLE
there are M mobile users, i.e., M = {1, 2, . . . , M}, are
running haptic applications, e.g., the remote surgery. These
application experiencers (called requesters for brevity) request
some special contents according to their unique application
demands, i.e., the background information of AR/VR. We
assume that all desirable documents are from system con-
tent library F = {1, 2, . . . , F}, where F denotes the number
of documents in library. Specifically, requesters request their
interested files according to a certain popularity distribution,
i.e., Zipf distribution. The probability of requesting document
f for requester m is presented as follows:
Pm,f = 1/f γm
∑F
i=1 1/iγm
(1)
where γm denotes the popularity parameter, and the value of
γm reflects the degree of skewness.
In addition, there are N helpers which act as consensus
users, i.e., N = {1, 2, . . . , N}. These helpers running the
blockchain application, e.g., DApp [33], are responsible for
maintaining the consensus mechanism. Specifically, they mine
the new block to store transaction information. Moreover, the
process of mining in essence is obtaining the solution of the
math puzzle. The consensus user who solves the math puzzle
first will receive the reward given by the system. However,
the mining speed is related to the computing power. In other
words, a consensus user wants to mine a block quickly in a
shorter time, then it needs more computing resources. The key
variables are given in Table I.
On the one hand, when requesters merely rely on the
response and service of BS, both the performance and experi-
ence may be affected due to nonnegligible delay. On the other
hand, taking the available local content of helpers into account,
helpers can share their corresponding cache when requesters
generate content demands. Meanwhile, BS will allocate part of
its computing resource as a reward to helpers who realize the
content delivery. In this framework of cooperation, the content
delivery delay of requesters is improved, and the probability
of obtaining rewards of helpers is also increased.
B. Problem Formulation
We denote an = (cn, pn) as the action of helper n, where
cn = (cn,1, cn,2, . . . , cn,MC) and pn denote the cache content
and transmission power of helper n, and MC = |cn| is the size
of cache space. When helper n responds to the content demand
of neighbors and shares its local cache via D2D communi-
cations, BS will allocate a certain computing power to help
helper n solve the math puzzle according to the joint deci-
sion profile of all helpers. Given the action an of helper n, the
allocated power, i.e., the relative power/hash power, is given
by
αn = |sn|
M
(2)
where M is the number of total requesters in networks, and sn
denotes the set of requests who select to access the service of
helper n.
According to the existing works, requesters prefer to turn
to their closest friend for service [34]–[36]. To measure the
influence of the physical and social relationships on content
delivery, we define the closest helper xm of requester m as
follows:
xm = arg max

⎩

(3)
where pi is the transmission power of helper i, h is the normal-
ized propagation parameter, di,m denotes the physical distance
between helper i and requester m, α is the path-loss exponent,
and Pm,f denotes the probability requesting content f . The
function H(f , ci) indicates whether consensus user i caches
content f , which is expressed as follows:
H(f , cn) =
{

0, if f /∈ cn.

Fig. 3. Illustration of service relationships between consensus users and

content service. In Fig. 3(b), there exist two neighbor helpers,
i.e., helpers 1 and 2, around requester 1. Requester 1 receives
the same level of physical factors from helpers 1 and 2 due
to equal distance and transmission power. However, helper 2
with a strong social relationship will give requester 1 quick
service response. Then, requester 1 will establish a service
relationship with helper 2. However, in Fig. 3(c), when facing
the same social relationship from neighbors, requester 1 will
select helper 1 to obtain service. The reason is that although
requester 1 has a closer distance, helper 1 can bring requester 1
a higher transmission experience due to a great physical
factor.
Thus, the set of requesters paired with helper n, i.e., Sn, is
defined in (5), shown at the bottom of the page. In (5), dth is the
communication threshold, which is related to the transmission
power of helpers. When a helper adjusts its power to a high
one, then the corresponding threshold will increase.
Given the action of helper n, i.e., the cache and transmission
power, then the expect reward of helper n is defined as follows:
En = (R + rtn) · αn · βn (6)
where r is a variable reward factor, R and rtn denote a fixed
reward and variable reward, respectively. tn is the number of
transactions, which is stored in a new block mined by helper n.
αn is the relative power that decides the speed of mining a
block. Note that αn only influences the probability of mining
a new block. In fact, when helper n mines out a new block, it
still needs to transmit its mined block to other helpers to verify
the correctness. Once the new block is verified, then helper n
receives the reward. Accordingly, βn indicates the probability
that the new block mined by helper n is verified successfully
by others, which is given by
βn = 1 − Porphaning (7)
where Porphaning denotes the probability of orphaning where
the new block will be discarded due to the long block
propagation delay [42]. The block propagation delay is propor-
tional to the block size. Meanwhile, according to the existing
works [43], [44], time for mining a block and the correspond-
ing block size follow the Poisson distribution and normal
distribution, respectively. Thus, the probability of orphaning
Porphaning is expressed as follows:
Porphaning = 1 − e−λztn (8)
where λ is the related Poisson parameter, and z is the delay
factor, which is a fixed constant. And tn denotes the number
of transactions of helper n, i.e., the block size of helper n.
In addition, taking the overhead of helper n caused by
energy and storage consumption, the benefit of helper n is
presented as follows:
un = (R + rtn) · |sn|
M
· e−λztn − C1pn − C2
∑
f ∈cn
Df (9)
where pn is the transmission power of helper n, and Df is the
corresponding data size of content f , thus,
∑
f ∈cn
Df indicates
the aggregate storage space due to cache contents. C1 and C2
indicate the overhead per power and per bit.
The first term of (9) denotes the expect reward, and the
second and last terms indicate the energy consumption and
storage consumption, respectively. Moreover, in order to obtain
the great benefits, helpers will adjust their actions, i.e., adjust
their transmission power and cache. As can be seen from Fig. 4
and (5), there exist three typical scenarios in this considered
model.
1) Scenario 1: In Fig. 4(a), there exists one requester
within the overlapping communication ranges of
helpers 1 and 2. Given the current action of helpers,
requester 1 chooses helper 2 to establish service relation-
ships. Meanwhile, helper 1 can adjust its power/cache
contents to attract request 1 to obtain the high benefit.
2) Scenario 2: In Fig. 4(b), some requesters merely located
in the communication range of helper 1, and these

(a) shows the requester is within the overlapping communication range of
helpers, (b) shows helper 1 will decrease the transmission power to save
energy consumption, and (c) shows helper 1 will increase the transmission
power to attract helper 1.
requesters establish the service relationships with helper
1. Helper 1 can decrease its transmission power to save
its energy consumption.
3) Scenario 3: Given the action of helper 1 as shown in
Fig. 4(c), there are some requesters without but near the
communication range of helper 1. Meanwhile, helper 1
can increase its power to attract the potential requesters
to improve its benefit.
Thus, the system benefits involving all helpers are presented
as follows:
U =
∑
n∈N
un. (10)
Helpers can obtain the high reward by responding to
the content demand of requesters, BS allocates computing
resources to helpers who realize the content delivery. Finally, a
potential cooperation mechanism is formed. From the perspec-
tive of the global system, the goal is to maximize the aggregate
benefits of all helpers, which is expressed as follows:
P1 : aopt ∈ arg max
a=(a1,a2,...,aN )
U (11)
where a = (a1, a2, . . . , aN) is the action profile of all consen-
sus users.
From (11), we can conclude that the optimization problem
P1 is a complicated and combinational problem, which
involves the decisions of all helpers. The traditional centralized
approach, e.g., a center controller, can solve the correspond-
ing problem. However, it will face the high complexity and
great calculation. Especially, when the number of helpers rises,
the complexity will increase explosively. Therefore, to deal
with the challenge, we introduce the game theory and solve it
innovatively in a distributed manner.
III. MULTIUSER CONTENT DELIVERY GAME
A. Game Model
Game theory as a branch of modern mathematics has been
widely used in wireless communication. Generally, researchers
use game theory to characterize and analyze the competition
between multiple game players. Each player can adjust its
action according to the current communication environment,
e.g., the response of other players to the competition of com-
munication resources. Through constant iteration and update,
finally, all game players will achieve a stable point where no
one wants to change their decision unilaterally.
Inspired by [45] and [46], jointly optimizing the distributed
cache and power control is the Pareto-optimal problem. In
this section, we combine game theory with the optimization
problem and obtain a desirable solution from a distributed
framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem P1 as a
multiuser content delivery game, i.e., G = {N , An, Un}, where
N denotes the set of game players, i.e., the consensus users.
An indicates the strategy space of consensus user n, i.e., An =
{an : an = cn ⊗ pn, cn ⊂ F , pn ∈ P}, where cn and pn are the
cache content of consensus user n and the transmission power
of consensus user n, respectively. Moreover, F is the system
document library, and P is the set of the available transmission
powers. Finally, Un is the utility function of player n, which is
the key point of our proposed game. The design of the utility
function determines whether there exists one stable solution,
i.e., NE points.
In our game model, the concept of local altruistic coopera-
tion in [47] is applied. The local altruistic cooperation means
that when every player takes its action and updates its deci-
sion, they should also consider the utility of neighbors besides
its utility. Meanwhile, in the existing works of local altruistic
cooperation, the neighbors of every game player are prede-
termined due to the equal transmission power of all game
players. However, the traditional local altruistic cooperation
is not suitable for our optimization problem. The reason is
that the transmission power of all game players is not fixed in
our game model, and every player can adjust its transmission
power to pursue the high benefits.
Thus, we extend the traditional local altruistic game to a
local potential game where our proposed game considers the
potential cooperation between multiple players. To character-
ize the potential cooperation of players, we define the set
of potential cooperation neighbors of player n, which can be
expressed as follows:
Jn = {
j ∈ N : dn,j < d
pn,max
th , n ∈ N }
(12)
where dn,j is the physical distance between consensus user
n and j, and pn,max and d
pn,max
th are the maximum transmis-
sion power of player n and the corresponding communication
threshold of player n, respectively.
We introduce the potential cooperation into the utility of
player n, which can be presented as follows:
Un(an, a−n) = un(an, a−n) +
∑
i∈Jn
ui(ai, a−i). (13)
Note that (13) consists of two parts: 1) its utility and
2) the utilities of potential cooperation neighbors. This design

can be explained that when any player changes its action,

system. However, the updating player only influences its
potential cooperation neighbors due to the constraint trans-
mission power. Thus, in other words, when one game player
updates its action, the utility of both this updating player
and its potential cooperation neighbors will be affected, i.e.,
increase or decrease. Finally, the fluctuations in utilities of
potential cooperation neighbors are delivered to the global
networks, and the global benefits of all game players are
influenced.
Besides, all game players are selfish and rational. They just
want to increase their utilities by updating the suitable deci-
sion. Then, the related optimization problem of the proposed
game is presented as follows:
P2 : max Un(an, a−n), n ∈ N . (14)
B. Analysis of NE
Next, we will explore how to achieve continuous growth in
the global system benefits when the utilities of local potential
neighbors fluctuate periodically. Before the related analysis,
we first give two important definitions, i.e., the definition of
NE and EPG.
Definition 1 (Nash Equilibrium [48]): The joint cache con-
tent and transmission power strategy profile a∗ =
(a∗
1, a∗
2, . . . , a∗
N) is a NE of the multiuser content delivery
game if and only if no game player, i.e., the consensus user,
can improve its utilities unilaterally when updating its cor-
responding decision in the situation where others keep their
decisions unchanged, i.e.,
Un
(
a∗
n, a∗−n
) ≥ Un
(
an, a∗−n
)
, ∀n ∈ N , ∀an ∈ An, an 
= an
∗
(15)
where a∗
n is the best decision of consensus user n in the current
situation, and a∗−n is the corresponding best decision profile
of others.
Definition 2 (Exact Potential Game [48]): Any proposed
game is an EPG if and only if a unique potential function �
exists corresponding to the utility function of the proposed
game, which can be presented as follows:
Un(ān, a−n) − Un(an, a−n) = �(ān, a−n) − �(an, a−n)
∀n ∈ N ∀an ∈ An, ∀ān ∈ An. (16)
Definition 1 explains the meaning of NE, and Definition 2
indicates the significance of the potential function. Meanwhile,
it means that if we can prove the existence and find the
corresponding potential function, our proposed game is an
EPG.
Theorem 1: The proposed multiuser content delivery game
is an EPG with at least one pure-strategy NE point.
Meanwhile, the corresponding NE points consist of the optimal
solution to the optimization problem P1.
Proof: In this section, we mainly discuss the existence of
the potential function. Generally, the related potential function
has a certain physical meaning, i.e., the aggregate throughput
or aggregate interference. Inspired by the design thought, we
define our potential function �, which is expressed as follows:
�(an, a−n) =
∑
n∈N
un(an, a−n). (17)
Equation (17) denotes the aggregate benefits of all con-
sensus users, which is equal to (10), i.e., the global benefits.
When any player n changes its decision unilaterally from an
to a′
n, then the change of the value in the potential function is
presented as follows:
�
(
a′
n, a−n
) − �(an, a−n) =
∑
n∈N
un
(
a′
n, a−n
)
−
∑
n∈N
un(an, a−n). (18)
To a better analysis and understanding, we divide all con-
sensus users into three categories: 1) the updating consensus
user n; 2) the potential cooperation neighbors, i.e., Jn; and
3) others, i.e., N \{Jn ∪ n}. Thus, (18) can be rewritten as
follows:
�
(
a′
n, a−n
) − �(an, a−n)
=
∑
n∈N
un(a
′
n, a−n) −
∑
n∈N
un(an, a−n)
= un(a
′
n, a−n) +
∑
i∈Jn
ui(ai, a′−i) +
∑
i∈N \{Jn∪n}
ui(ai, a′−i)
− un(an, a−n) −
∑
i∈Jn
ui(ai, a−i) −
∑
i∈N \{Jn∪n}
ui(ai, a−i).
(19)
Considering the limited transmission power, consensus user
n only influences the potential cooperation neighbors within
its maximum communication range corresponding to the max-
imum transmission power. In other words, except for the
potential cooperation neighbors, the benefits of other consen-
sus users are the same with the previous benefits whatever
whether player n updates its decision. Specifically, we can
have
∑
i∈N \{Jn∪n}
ui(ai, a−i) =
∑
i∈N \{Jn∪n}
ui
(
a′
i, a−i
)
. (20)
Combined (19) with (20), we can obtain the following
expression:
�
(
a′
n, a−n
) − �(an, a−n)
=
∑
n∈N
un
(
a′
n, a−n
) −
∑
n∈N
un(an, a−n)
= un
(
a′
n, a−n
) +
∑
i∈Jn
ui
(
ai, a′−i
)
− un(an, a−n) −
∑
i∈Jn
ui(ai, a−i). (21)
Next, when any consensus user n updates its decision from
an to a′
n, the change of the value in the corresponding utility
function is presented as follows:
Un
(
a′
n, a−n
) − Un(an, a−n)
= un
(
a′
n, a−n
) +
∑
i∈Jn
ui
(
ai, a′−i
)
− un(an, a−n) −
∑
i∈Jn
ui(ai, a−i)
= �
(
a′
n, a−n
) − �(an, a−n). (22)

Finally, we can find that the expression in Definition 2,
i.e., (17), holds in our proposed game model. It means that in
our game model, if there exists a player updates its decision,
then the fluctuation trend of value in the potential function
is equal to the change of value in the utility function. Thus,
according to Definition 2, our proposed game is an EPG.
Meanwhile, one of the important properties about the EPG
game is that: there exists at least one pure-strategy NE point
in any EPG game, and the corresponding NE points consist of
the maximum value in the potential function. Then, Theorem 1
is proven.
IV. CONTEXT-AWARE CONTENT DELIVERY-BASED
CONCURRENT BETTER REPLY ALGORITHM
In Section III, we design the corresponding game model to
find a desirable solution to the optimization problem. Note that
we merely prove the existence of NE points in our proposed
game model in Section III. However, the detailed NE solution
is not obtained. Note that it is difficult to solve the com-
binational problem for a center controller due to the high
complexity and great calculation. Thus, it is necessary to
design an effective distributed algorithm to find the solution
to the problem. Then, in this section, we mainly discuss how
to obtain the corresponding NE points of our game model.
A. Algorithm Design
In the game-theoretical framework, there exist many classi-
cal algorithms, e.g., better reply and best response, to obtain
the NE of the corresponding game model. In this article,
inspired by [49], we design the CCDCBR algorithm.
Compared with the traditional better reply, our proposed
algorithm has innovative advantages as follows.
1) Extend the Decision Variables of the Algorithm From
1-D Action to 2-D Action: Generally, in a traditional
better reply, the corresponding decision variable is 1-D
action, e.g., the transmission power or cache content.
However, in our proposed algorithm, we combine the
transmission power with cache content and regard the
combinational action as an individual decision.
2) Have a Higher Convergence Rate: In the distributed
algorithm, the convergence rate plays an important role
in performance. Specifically, when the number of play-
ers, i.e., consensus users, increases, it will bring a
negative influence to the convergence of the algorithm.
In order to solve this challenge, we improve the updating
process from one-player updating to multiplayer updat-
ing, which greatly speeds up the convergence of our
proposed algorithm theoretically.
As shown in Fig. 5, our proposed algorithm first initial-
izes the initial decisions of all consensus users and the related
simulation parameters. In other words, each consensus user
randomly selects an available decision from their strategy
space to provide service for requesters. Meanwhile, given the
decisions of all consensus users, they estimate and sense the
individual utility.
Next, to speed up the convergence of the proposed algo-
rithm, multiple nonneighboring consensus users are selected
Algorithm 1: CCDCBR Algorithm
Initialization:
1) Initialize the initial decision of all consensus users, i.e., the
random cache document and transmission power.
2) Set the related simulation parameters, e.g., the maximum
iterations of the proposed algorithm and noise.
Repeat Iterations:
Step 1: All consensus users sense their utilities, i.e., Un
in current decisions, i.e., an, when they provide service for
requesters.
Step 2: Multiple nonneighboring consensus users are selected
to obtain the updating opportunity. The selected consensus
users random select a new decision a′
n from their available
strategy space.
Step 3: These updating users sense their utilities, i.e., U′
n, over
their new decisions. Meanwhile, players update their decisions
by the following rule:
an(k + 1) =
{
a′
n, if Un(an, a−n) > Un(a′
n, a−n)
an(k), if Un(an, a−n) ≤ Un(a′
n, a−n)
(23)
where an(k + 1) denotes the decision of consensus user n in
the (k+1)th iteration. Meanwhile, the joint decisions of others
are unchanged.
End
The repeat iterations will stop and the algorithm will termi-
nates when the maximum iteration is achieved or the utility
remains stable during a period.

to conduct the decision updating process. In this process, the
corresponding users will randomly pick a new decision a′
n
and sense the corresponding utility U′
n. Finally, these updat-
ing users will update their decisions according to the related
utility, i.e., Un and U′
n. The detailed information is presented
in Algorithm 1.
In step 2 of the CCDCBR algorithm, multiple consen-
sus users are selected. In order to achieve the selection
of nonneighboring consensus users in reality, the contention

mechanism is proposed. We assume that there exists a com-
mon control channel (CCC) available and all consensus users
can work in CCC with corresponding 802.11 DCF-like con-
tention mechanism [47]. The detailed description is given as
follows.
1) A consensus user generates a backoff timer depend-
ing on uniform distribution in [0, τmax], where τmax
represents the predetermined maximum backoff time.
2) Upon expiry of backoff timer, the consensus user sends
a request to decision update (RTDU) packet in CCC to
announce its intention for updating the cache content
and transmission power.
3) All neighboring consensus users will freeze their back-
off timers immediately and keep silent until the next
iteration when hearing an RTDU before backoff timer
expires.
B. Analysis of the Convergence and Complexity
Not like other distributed algorithms, e.g., best response,
each player only conducts one comparison and avoids the
global search in our proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, this
updating mechanism can jump out of the trouble of local
optimum and achieve the global optimum point with a high
probability.
Theorem 2: The proposed CCDCBR algorithm can con-
verge the corresponding pure-strategy NE points of our
proposed multiuser content delivery game. The NE points can
realize the local or global maximum of the system benefits.
Proof: As shown in Fig. 6, we propose the multiuser con-
tent delivery game model in Section III. Based on Definitions
1 and 2, we realize the proof of Theorem 1 where our proposed
game model is an EPG and has at least one pure-strategy
NE point. Specifically, there exists the same fluctuation trend
between the utility function and the potential function, i.e.,
when the value in the utility function of any consensus user
increases, so is the value in the potential function. Through
this design, the utility function is associated with the potential
function. Note that the utility function and the potential func-
tion denote the individual utility and global system benefits,
respectively. In other words, when we optimize the utility of
each consensus user, the aggregate system benefits increase
simultaneously. Thus, through our proposed distributed algo-
rithm, when the individual utility of each updating user
increases step by step according to the finite improvement
TABLE II
COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
property (FIP) of game theory, then the global system ben-
efits improve and finally converges to a maximum value in
the potential function, which has the same physical meaning
of (10). Therefore, the global system benefits are optimized
locally or globally by our proposed CCDCBR algorithm.
Accordingly, Theorem 2 is proved.
Finally, we mainly discuss the computation complexity of
the proposed algorithm as shown in Table II. Inspired by [50],
for a better understanding, we denote Nit as the iteration times
when the proposed algorithm terminates. The detailed analysis
process is presented as follows.
1) In step 1, all consensus users need to sense their utilities.
The complexity can be denoted as O(C1), where C1 is
a small constant decided by (9) and (13).
2) In step 2, multiple nonneighboring consensus users will
be selected by the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the
complexity is O(C2), where C2 is a small constant due
to the contention mechanism.
3) In step 3, the updating process involves the basic mathe-
matical comparison between Un and U′
n, which is shown
in (23). Accordingly, the complexity is O(C3), where
C3 is a small constant related to the basic mathematical
operation.
Therefore, the computation complexity of our proposed
algorithm is Nit(O(C1) + O(C2) + O(C3)). Specifically, we
introduce the concurrent operation in our proposed algorithm.
The iteration times Nit are at a low level, which can be
reflected by the simulation results in Section V. Meanwhile,
the expression indicates that the computation complexity is
independent of the number of consensus users. Thus, we can
conclude that the computation complexity of our proposed
algorithm is relatively low.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Simulation Parameter Setting
In this section, related simulation results are presented to
analyze the performance of the proposed game model and
algorithm. Inspired by [41] and [51], simulation parameters
are set as follows. As shown in Fig. 7, where the black dotted
line denotes the potential cooperation neighbors, all helpers
and requesters are distributed randomly in the network with
200×200 m2. The number of helpers is N = 5 while the num-
ber of requesters with content demands is M = 20. Meanwhile,
the fixed reward and variable reward factor are set to R = 104
and r = 20, respectively. The detailed parameter setting is
presented in Table III.

B. Convergence Behavior
In this section, we investigate the convergence behavior of
the proposed algorithm. As shown in Fig. 8, we vary the num-
ber of helpers and the size of cache space to explore the
convergence behavior under two different groups of simulation
parameters, i.e., N = 3, MC = 3 and N = 5, MC = 4, in the
system while keeping other simulation parameters unchanged.
Meanwhile, the values in Fig. 8 are obtained through 500 inde-
pendent trials where each network topology is different. When
running in the condition of N = 5, MC = 4, the algorithm

converges at a small iteration time, i.e., k = 150, which reflects
a high convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.
Specifically, we compare the convergence speed of our
proposed algorithm with the traditional better reply algorithm
in Fig. 9. We vary the number of helpers from N = 3 to N = 7
and study the relationship between the expected convergence
times and the number of helpers. As shown in this figure, the
difference of the expected convergence times is small when
the number of helpers is N = 3 or N = 4. However, with the
increasing of the number of helpers, there exists a great gap
gradually in the convergence speed. In particular, when the
number of helpers is N = 7, the proposed algorithm not only
realizes the convergence within a relatively low expected con-
vergence times but also obtains a strong competitive advantage
compared with the traditional better reply algorithm, which
indicates the good scalability of the proposed algorithm.
C. Performance Evaluation
1) Cache Space: Fig. 10 presents the performance when
varying the cache space of helpers. To highlight the superi-
ority of the proposed algorithm, we introduce the following
approaches as the comparison benchmark: the best NE, the
worst NE, gene algorithm-based content delivery strategy
(GA-CDS), and random selection algorithm. The correspond-
ing approaches can be explained as follows.
1) Best/Worst NE: NE points are obtained from the best
response algorithm. Then, we pick the best and worst
solution of NE points from 500 independent trials as
the best and worst NE.
2) GA-CDS: The traditional gene algorithm is introduced.
To make it suitable for the multiuser 2-D decision, we
encode the decision, including the transmission power
and cache contents as gene segments, and then string
all genes into one chromosome. Through the constant
selection, crossover, and mutation, finally, a solution is
obtained.
3) Random Selection Algorithm: Each helper randomly
selects an available action from its strategy space. Given
all random decisions of helpers, global benefits are
achieved.

Fig. 10. Global benefits comparison when varying the cache space of helpers.
Fig. 11. Global benefits comparison when varying the data size of contents.
As shown in Fig. 10, the global benefits decrease with
the growing cache space. It is because when helpers can
cache more contents, the storage overhead rises significantly.
Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed algorithm is
between the best NE and the worst NE. The global bene-
fits achieved by the proposed algorithm are higher than the
random selection and GA-CDS.
2) Data Size: We investigate the performance of the
proposed algorithm when varying the data size of each docu-
ment in system library. Moreover, we set five different groups
of data size from Df ∈ [0 50] Mbits to Df ∈ [200 250] Mbits.
Similar to Fig. 10, the same decreasing trend is presented in
Fig. 11. Although the global benefits decrease when the data
size is growing as shown in Fig. 11, the proposed algorithm
can still realize a higher performance than other approaches. In
addition, the performance obtained by the proposed algorithm
is near the best NE.
3) Number of Requesters: We study the influence of the
number of requesters on the performance of the proposed algo-
rithm. In the related simulation trials, we change the number of
requesters from M = 16 to M = 24 while keeping other simu-
lation parameters unchanged. As shown in Fig. 12, the global
benefits achieved by all approaches are almost unchanged
with the increasing number of requesters. It can be explained
that when the number of requesters increases, helpers still

Fig. 13. Global benefits comparison when varying the number of helpers in

complete mutually to attract more requesters. By adjusting
their transmission power and cache contents in the proposed
incentive mechanism, the number of requests who select to
access the service of helper n, i.e., |sn|, increases simultane-
ously with the growing questers. Consequently, the first term
of (9), i.e., the reward of helpers allocated by the system,
hardly changes due to [|sn|/M]. Thus, the global benefits keep
unchanged while the number of requesters is growing.
4) Number of Helpers: In Fig. 13, we explore the relation-
ships between global benefits and the number of helpers. From
the fluctuation trend of Fig. 13, we can find that the global ben-
efits first increase when the number of helpers is from N = 3
to N = 4, then decrease when the number of helpers is from
N = 4 to N = 7. The interesting phenomenon can be explained
as follows: given the number of requesters, when there is a
small number of helpers, the total content demands cannot be
responded fully. Thus, when the number of responders, i.e.,
helpers, increases, the global benefits will rise due to the bet-
ter performance. However, when there are enough helpers to
provide service, the multiple players will compete with oth-
ers. They adjust their decisions to attract more requesters with
content demands to obtain higher benefits. Thus, when the
number of helpers exceeds to a certain degree, each helper only
serves limited requesters due to a fixed number of requesters.

Fig. 14. Global benefits comparison when varying the number of helpers in
a large edge cache network.
Taking the overheads of transmission power and storage, then
the global benefits will decrease.
Finally, to verify the applicability of the relevant conclu-
sions, we conduct the simulation with a larger number of
samples. Given the large number of requesters, i.e., M = 40,
we explore the performance when varying the number of
helpers, i.e., consensus users, from N = 5 to N = 20. As
shown in Fig. 14, it can be seen that the global benefits first
increase and then decrease with the growing helpers. Note that
the trend in Fig. 14 is the same as that in Fig. 13. Compared
with the proposed algorithm, the performance achieved by
the GA-CDS and random selection algorithm will decrease
sharply when the number of samples increases. However, the
proposed algorithms can still obtain a high global benefit. It
validates the effectiveness for a large number of samples.
In summary, the fast convergence rate and good scalability
of the proposed CCDCBR algorithm are presented by a series
of simulation results. Specifically, the global benefits achieved
by the proposed algorithm are higher than other approaches
and near to the best NE, which is regarded as the optimal solu-
tion. Simulation results verify the validity and effectiveness of
the proposed game model as well as the proposed CCDCBR
algorithm.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, we investigated the multiuser content delivery
problem in haptic communications. To overcome the selfish-
ness of users and motivate them to share their local resources,
we proposed a blockchain-based incentive mechanism. By
jointly optimizing the cache content and transmission power,
each helper can obtain the reward by responding the content
demands of requesters. Then, the problem was formulated as
the multiuser content delivery game with at least one pure-
strategy NE point. Next, we proposed the distributed CCDCBR
algorithm to achieve a desirable solution. Finally, the validity
and effectiveness of the multiuser content delivery game as
well as the CCDCBR algorithm were verified by the related
simulation results.
