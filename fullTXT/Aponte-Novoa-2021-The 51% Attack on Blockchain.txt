ABSTRACT The applications that use blockchain are cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance applications,
video games, and many others. Most of these applications trust that the blockchain will prevent issues like
fraud, thanks to the built-in cryptographic mechanisms provided by the data structure and the consensus
protocol. However, blockchains suffer from what is called a 51% attack or majority attack, which is
considered a high risk for the integrity of these blockchains, where if a miner, or a group of them, has more
than half the computing capability of the network, it can rewrite the blockchain. Even though this attack
is possible in theory, it is regarded as hard-achievable in practice, due to the assumption that, with enough
active members, it is very complicated to have that much computing power; however, this assumption has
not been studied with enough detail. In this work, a detailed characterization of the miners in the Bitcoin and
Crypto Ethereum blockchains is presented, with the aim of proving the computing distribution assumption
and creating profiles that may allow the detection of anomalous behaviors and prevent 51% attacks. The
results of the analysis show that, in the last years, there has been an increasing concentration of hash rate
power in a very small set of miners, which generates a real risk for current blockchains. Also, that there is a
pattern in mining among the main miners, which makes it possible to identify out-of-normal behavior.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain technology promises to become a great oppor-
tunity to provide different solutions for society’s prob-
lems, ‘‘. . .Like the internet reinvented communication,
blockchain may similarly disrupt transactions, contracts, and
trust – the underpinnings of business, government, and soci-
ety’’ [1]. It also has been defined as ‘‘a perpetually updated
record of transactions independently saved by users across
the internet’’; in other words, it is an immutable distributed
ledger [2]. The basic operation of a blockchain consists of the
secure administration of a shared ledger, where transactions
are verified and stored in a network of anonymous nodes
that does not have a central authority. A blockchain can be
public or private, where read or write permissions can be con-
figured. Some mathematical tools, like cryptographic hash

functions, as well as computational ones, like a p2p network
and consensus algorithms, allow the blockchain to work, not
only to execute transactions but also to protect the integrity
and anonymity of the users. However, blockchains, despite
their strong data structure and other benefits, has some short-
comings, like the computational cost to run the blockchain’s
consensus algorithms, which requires the solution of complex
mathematical problems in parallel by a large number of users,
all competing to finish first in a global race [1].
Despite the effort required to solve the problems is high,
there are users with enough computing power that could
not only solve them quickly and in a distributed manner,
but also try to take over the network by generating a new
version of the blockchain that would allow them to spend a
particular number of coins at least two times, violating one of
the design principles of digital currencies. This is called the
double-spending attack, and it poses a high risk for the
security of the blockchain. In particular, this attack can be

carried out by a miner if this miner has more than 51% of
all the mining power. This is also known as the 51% attack,
which can be defined as a hash-based attack that occurs in
a blockchain when one or more miners take control of at
least 51% of all the mining of hash or the computation in the
blockchain network. With this computational power, a miner
may alter transactions in a blockchain network and hence
hinder the process of storing a new block [3].
By executing a 51% attack, a miner can arbitrarily manip-
ulate and modify the information on the blockchain. Specif-
ically, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to carry out
the following attacks: a) reverse transactions and initiate
a double-spending attack; that is, spending the same coins
multiple times; b) exclude and modify the order of trans-
actions; c) hamper the normal mining operations of other
miners; and d) prevent the confirmation operation of normal
transactions [4].
If a few miners gather the mining power in a blockchain
that uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism,
then fear of an inadvertent situation may occur, such as one
group controlling more than 50% of the computing power
hash [5]. In January 2014, the mining group ghash.io reached
42% of the total hash power in bitcoin, which caused several
miners to voluntarily leave the group, while ghash.io in a
press release assured the Bitcoin community that would avoid
reaching the 51% hash power threshold [6]. In this case, there
was a self-control mechanism based on honor; however, this
kind of issue cannot be left to chance if the blockchain would
like to become a more widely accepted infrastructure for
transactions.
To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks a work
making a deep analysis of the behavior of the miners to
identify patterns that could help detect early signs of a 51%
attack taking place. This paper presents a characterization of
the principal miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum. In particular,
we focus on miners with a hash rate of more than 1% per
defined period to create profiles that may allow the detec-
tion of anomalous behaviors. In addition, a validation of the
theoretical work of [7] is performed, based on the actual
transactions dataset of these blockchains.
This article is organized as follows: Section II presents
some consensus algorithms. Section III presents some
works related to techniques for preventing 51% attacks.
In Section IV, the methodology used in its data selection, pre-
processing and mining characterization phases are detailed.
In Section V, we present the results obtained organized in the
number of miners, hash rate/share of the miner, percentage
of mined consecutively, the profile of miners, and analysis of
double-spending. Finally, the conclusions and future works
are presented in Section VI
II. CONSENSUS ALGORITHMS
This section presents the consensus algorithms Proof of
Work, Proof of Stake, and Hybrid form of these algorithms,
also other proof-based consensus algorithms.
A. ORIGINAL PROOF OF WORK
In a blockchain, when a new block is added, an agree-
ment between the nodes is required. For this, the Proof of
Work (PoW) algorithm requires that each node solves a puz-
zle to which the difficulty can be adjusted, so that the first
node that solves the puzzle, will get the right to add a new
block to the current chain. The effort made by the node for the
solution of the puzzle, is called PoW and is payed to the node
that calculated the hash right. This node is called a mining
node or miner, and the action of solving the puzzle is called
mining [8].
In the PoW, a search for the puzzle solution is made, such
that when the hash is created, usually using the SHA-256 hash
function, it must start with a number of zero bits. The average
work required is exponential in relation to the number of
required zero bits and can be verified by executing a simple
hash operation [9]. In PoW the difficulty of the puzzle is
adjusted every time that 2016 blocks are added, so that the
average speed to add one new block in the chain is one (1)
block every ten minutes [8].
When a new block is created, the header information is
combined and sent as an input parameter to the SHA-256 hash
function [10]. If the output of this function is below a thresh-
old T (which depends on the difficulty), then the value sought
is accepted. Otherwise, the node must continue calculating
the secret value until the output of the SHA-256 function is
accepted. The difficulty of the puzzle increases as the value
T becomes smaller [8].
B. PoS-BASED
The Proof of Work algorithm is not fair for all miners,
because not all have the same hardware. Some have modern
equipment and other very basic equipment to process data
and information which, given that solving the puzzle is very
computing-intensive, the first ones will have an advantage.
The algorithms based on Proof of Stake (PoS) seek to deal
with this inequality. The basic principle of the PoS algorithms
is to use the idea of a bet or participation magnitude, to define
which node will have the opportunity to mine the next block
in the chain. Using participation as evidence has an advan-
tage: any node that has had a lot of previous participation
is more reliable, and thus it is expected that this node will
not perform any fraudulent activity to attack the chain that
contains a large part of its profits. Also, the use of PoS implies
that there has to be at least 51% of all bets in the network,
to perform a double-cost attack, which is very difficult. There
are currently two popular types of consensus that use PoS:
those that use pure participation to obtain consensus and the
hybrids that combine PoS and PoW [8].
C. HYBRID FORM OF PoW AND PoS
Sunny and Scott [11] proposed a new concept called the coin
age of each miner, which is calculated by his bet multiplied
by the time theminer owns it. For a node to get the right to add
a new block to the chain, it creates a special block called coin
140550 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. A. Aponte-Novoa et al.: 51% Attack on Blockchains: Mining Behavior Study
stake, which contains many transactions, but also includes a
special one from that miner to itself. The amount of money
spent on the transaction gives the miner more possibilities to
mine a new block, then solve the puzzle, as in PoW. The more
money is spent on the transaction, the easier it is to solve the
puzzle. When the puzzle is solved, the mining node gets 1%
of the amount of the coins that they have spent in the transac-
tion, but the accumulated coin age by these coins is reset to
zero (0) [8].
Unlike the previous proposal, Vasin [12] does not use
the coin age in his blockchain, because it is assumed that,
by making use of the coin age, the attacker can be given
the possibility to accumulate enough value to deceive the
network. Another problem is the possible existence of some
miners who keep their bet until they have a large number
of coins, while they remain outside the verification system;
therefore, the proposal by Vasin [12], is to use pure participa-
tion in exchange for the age of the currency to offer miners the
possibility of mining a new block. This may encourage more
nodes to be online to obtain profits.When the existence of off-
line miners is untied, Ren [13] proposes to use an exponential
decay function with the coin age, in which, when the miner
waits for the increase in the coin age, less is the speed of
increase. References [14] propose a method that combines
PoW and PoS, which will be explained in the next section as
a way to also mitigate the 51% attacks.
D. OTHER KINDS OF PROOF-BASED CONSENSUS
ALGORITHM
One of the main problems of PoW is the excessive energy
demands required to find the nonce, besides the fact that this
calculation is disposable and does not provide any long-term
benefit to the users. This was presented by Blocki and Zhou
in [15] and by Sunny [16]. To address this issue, Blocki
and Zhou [15] proposed the use of some types of puzzles for
education and social activities, which were easy to solve for
computers but difficult for people to solve; thus, the effort
to solve the puzzle to undermine a new block corresponds to
people and not in using hardware. This is fairer for all because
not all miners can invest in modern hardware [8].
Different authors have proposed other evidence-based con-
sensus algorithms that do not use the idea of PoW and PoS.
Examples of these are: Proof of Burn in [17], Proof of Space
in [18], Proof-of-QoS (PoQ) in [19] and A fair selection
protocol [20]. In Proof of Burn, the miners send their coins
to a direction to be burned, in this way these coins cannot be
used by others, so the miner who burns most coins, earns the
right to mine a new block. On the other hand, the miners of
Proof of Space must invest in hard disks for their computers,
which in comparison with the hardware required in PoW is
much cheaper. The Proof of Space algorithm generates large
data sets called plots on the hard disk, so the more data a
node has, the more likely it is that it will mine a new block.
In PoQ the network is divided into small regions. Each of
these chooses a node based on its QoS. Then, a deterministic
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus is run between
all the chosen nodes. The goal of PoQ is to achieve very high
transaction throughput as a permissionless protocol and to
provide a fairer environment for participants. Fair selection
protocol is composed of two main phases: the mining process
and the confirmation of the new nodes list. More consensus
techniques can be found in [21], where a new classification
method was proposed.
III. TECHNIQUES FOR 51% ATTACK PREVENTION
In this section, we present some works focused on mitigating
the 51% attack on blockchain networks.
The double-spending attack considers a high risk for the
security of a blockchain, when the miners own more than
51% of the mining power, generating an alert. To mitigate
this problem, [14] proposed a method combining PoW and
PoS (2-hop Blockchain). The objective of this method is to
make sure that, even if a miner owns more than 51% of the
mining power, he will not have many possibilities to carry out
a fraudulent action. To achieve this, the authors propose using
a PoW first to choose a winning node, which is the first to
solve the puzzle. Next, this node, in addition to adding a block
called PoW Block to the chain, provides a basis for choosing
another miner who has a bet. If the return value of the hash
function that has input parameters of the newly added PoW
Block and the private key of the owner of the bet is below a
threshold, the chosen miner will have the possibility to add
the PoS Block to the chain.
This research paper [22] proposes an encoder-decoder deep
learning model to detect anomalies in the use of blockchain
systems. The contributions of this work are the following:
a) the identification of a relevant set of characteristics cal-
culated in blockchain registers that describe the state of the
network in certain time steps; and b) The use of a sequence-
by-sequence neural network model to recognize anomalous
changes in the blockchain network.
Due to the uniqueness of the attacks and how this makes
them hard to identify and detect, [22] adopt an unsupervised
approach to address this problem. Also, they propose as
future work to study the use of hybrid architectures based on
the combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with
convolutional neural networks [23] to perform the feature-
selection process and assess eventual improvements. In addi-
tion, they consider defining models capable of predicting
attacks before they occur, improving network security.
The paper by [24] proposes a method to mitigate 51%
attack on proof-of-work blockchains based on weighted his-
tory information. In this approach, the authors use the fre-
quency rate of miners in historical blocks and calculate the
total weighted historical difficulty to establish if a branch
change is required. The proposed protocol is called ‘‘Proof of
work based on historical weighted difficulty’’ (HWD-PoW),
and its analysis indicates that the cost of the attack increases
by two orders of magnitude when the new technique is
implemented.
In [25], Dey proposes a methodology in which intelligent
software agents can be used to monitor stakeholder activity in
VOLUME 9, 2021 140551
F. A. Aponte-Novoa et al.: 51% Attack on Blockchains: Mining Behavior Study
blockchain networks to detect anomalies, such as collusion,
by making use of a supervised machine learning algorithm
and algorithmic game theory, to mitigate the majority or the
51% attack.
Horizon proposes a delayed block sending penalty sys-
tem [26]. This proposal suggests modifying the Satoshi con-
sensus protocol (PoW) to secure a network against 51%
attack. The sanction applied is determined based on the time
the attacking node is hidden from the network. This technique
notifies the entire network about the fork, and during that
period, participants, miners, and exchanges cannot transact
until the delay period is removed. The penalty system is a
research prototype technique that has not yet been imple-
mented in a real network, and it also includes several lim-
itations. According to Rosenfeld in [7], when an attacker
owns 51% of the network’s hash, he will always succeed
regardless of the imposed delay. Consequently, the possibility
of carrying out the 51% attack when this security mechanism
is in place is very large. Also, the delay process slows down
the general transactions of the network and strongly impacts
the usual transactions because the delay blocks will not be
confirmed until the penalty is lifted. This fact makes this
technique not very appropriate to be implemented in a real
network, and it is not completely effective against a 51%
attack.
In [27], Chainzilla proposes a Kodomo security solu-
tion called ‘‘delayed proof of work’’ (dPoW). This solu-
tion is implemented for cryptocurrencies based on UTXO.
This security technique is already implemented in some
blockchains to safeguard against double-spend attacks. The
main attribute of dPow is that it does not recognize the rule
of the longest chain; consequently, attacks that are intended
to be carried out in private cannot gain an advantage to double
spend. For its operation, dPow chooses 64 special nodes each
year to acquire information from Komodo and store it on the
bitcoin blockchain. The strengthened security orientation of
this proposal intends for the attacker to rewrite the Komodo
chain and bitcoin checkpoints. Likewise, the attacker must
also be able to influence the majority of the notary network.
This makes the technique robust. However, the limited num-
ber of special nodes makes the security technique central-
ized, which leads to the known problem of a ‘‘single point
of failure’’, where attackers know exactly what to attack.
Another limitation that dPoW presents is that it is only Imple-
mentable in cryptocurrencies based on UTXO and it is not
profitable since it requires an implementation fee. In addition,
the participating nodes of the network must wait an explicit
amount of time for the notarization process to be completed,
which can discourage certain participants who intend to make
a faster transaction. The notarization process is carried out
every 10 minutes, which gives attackers a window of time to
carry out the 51% attack in cryptocurrencies given that the
block confirmation time only needs a few seconds [28].
PirlGuard is a security protocol developed to mitigate the
51% attack, this approach modifies the consensus algorithm
to protect itself from a 51% attack [29]. This protocol is based
on the attributes of the Horizen penalty protocol (system
delay block send penalty), but it is built primarily for Ethash.
When the network detects longer blocks extracted privately,
PirlGuard abandons the node instantly by penalizing the
extraction of x number of blocks, based on the total number
of blocks extracted secretly. The PirlGuard approach employs
notarial contracts that are controlled by master nodes; these
master nodes are in charge of notarizing the blockchain and
penalizingmalicious nodes by regaining legitimate consensus
on the Pirl blockchain. As in the Komodo solution, PirlGuard
also employs master nodes, a feature that makes the security
technique centralized, leading to the known problem of a
‘‘single point of failure’’. Another limitation of this solution
derives from the fact that the penalty is not a final solution to
protect against the 51% attack, as there is a probability that
attackers with a hash rate of 51% will be able to overcome
that penalty.
ChainLocks in [30] is another security technique devel-
oped to protect DASH, based on the implementation of
‘‘long-living master node quorums’’ (LLMQs) to mitigate the
51% attack. This technique includes a network-wide voting
process that comprises a ‘‘first-look’’ policy. For each of
the blocks, an LLMQ of a large number of master nodes is
approved. All participating nodes in the network are required
to sign the designated block to extend the active chain. While
at least 60% of the network participants verify a block,
they generate a P2P message (CLSIG) to notify all other
nodes about the event. This CLSIG message cannot be gen-
erated unless enough members of the network comply, so it
implies a valid signature of authenticity and verifiable by the
nodes within the network. Because only one confirmation
is required for the publication of a block, attackers with at
least 51% hashing power have a chance to double-spend,
making the Dash blockchain vulnerable. In addition, the main
disadvantage of ChainLocks is that it is designed only for the
Dash cryptocurrency, which has a low network hash. This
feature, in addition to the master node approach, makes it
a weak security approach allowing the possibility of a 51%
attack simply by renting the required hashing power [31].
Merged Mining or merged mining is not a security
technique, but a method that allows merging several cryp-
tocurrencies with mining at the same time. Low hashing
power cryptocurrencies that share the same consensus can
benefit from merged mining to improve their security [32].
The merged mining process makes it possible to increase the
hashing power by starting in the other coin that comprises a
higher hashing power. Although cryptocurrencies take advan-
tage of merged mining, transactions on both networks can run
in sequence. Blockchains are classified as main and auxiliary.
In addition to improving security, another benefit is the ability
for miners to mine more than one block simultaneously.
Although merged mining increases security on blockchains,
the process is not straightforward and is very often neglected
by miners. The main limitation of this method is that the
cryptocurrencies that take advantage of this approach must be
in the same consensus protocol and mining algorithms [33].
140552 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. A. Aponte-Novoa et al.: 51% Attack on Blockchains: Mining Behavior Study
Another limitation is that, if two low-hashed cryptocurrencies
are combined, it is possible to exploit them as long as the
attacker achieves the required hashing power. Consequently,
merged mining is only a process to increase the cost of the
attack by merging hashing power, and does not provide an
effective solution to the 51% attack.
In [34], Sayeed&Marco-Gisbert present a novel technique
called ‘‘Proof of Adjourn’’ (PoAj), whose objective is to
mitigate themain blockchain attacks and the problem of delay
in the processing of transactions with large transactions in
cryptocurrencies passed in UTXO. This proposal does not
recognize the longest chain to verify the authenticity of the
chain, instead, a deferral period is imposed to regulate the
verification of the block, although miners with high hash-
ing power could have an advantage in the mining process,
the transmission of more than one block will disqualify the
block from being included in the chain by abstaining from
mining activities for some time. The security of this proposal
lies in eliminating the possibility of block reversion. PoAj
confirms transactions with just one confirmation eliminating
the waiting time of six confirmations brought by PoW. This
leads to a much faster transaction confirmation rate compared
to many existing consensus protocols. Similarly, PoAj intro-
duces a unique approach that is activated when there is more
than one block transmitted within a predefined period of time.
This approach is unique and, so far, it is the first approach to
fully solve the problem. This proposal is not found in any
cryptocurrency; the authors implemented a proof of concept
of the PoAj consensus protocol in the Python programming
language.
The table 1 presents the advantages, risks, vulnerabilities,
implementation cost, and the working of the techniques for
51% attack prevention presented in the analyzed works.
All these techniques assume a wide decentralization of
the nodes, but the reality of this assumption has not been
evaluated in the literature and will be addressed in this
work.
IV. METHODOLOGY
In this section, each of the phases of the methodology is
detailed, at first, we explained how the data were obtained
and selected, then we explain the process of pre-processing
the data sets, and finally the process of characterization of
the miners.
A. DATA SELECTION
In this study, the complete historical data generated by the
nodes of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks were acquired
and processed.
On the one hand, the Bitcoin dataset is hosted at [35].
This data have been progressively collected through Web
Scraping from the website [36] using a script written in
Python, which is available hosted at [37]. The correspond-
ing file has a current size of 243 MB, and it contains
the data of each bitcoin block ranging from the Genesis
block to the block number 682676 mined on May 9, 2021.
The data stored in the file is organized into the fol-
lowing fields: Hash, Confirmations, Timestamp,
Height, Number of Transactions, Difficulty,
Merkle root, Version, Bits, Weight, Size,
Nonce, Transaction Volume, Block Reward, Fee
Reward, Miner Name, Date, URL Miner, Year,
Month and Day.
On the other hand, the Crypto Ethereum dataset is hosted
on the Google cloud platform. It was queried and downloaded
by using the Google BigQuery tool from the blocks table
of the crypto_ethereum dataset
(bigquery-public-data:crypto_ethereum.blocks) [38].
All data in this dataset was extracted, transformed and
loaded through a set of Python scripts available on [39]. The
dataset hosted on Google Cloud contains data on each Crypto
Ethereum block ranging from the Genesis block to current
date. This because it gets updated daily, and its size is of
more than 13 Gb. It is organized into the following fields
(columns): Timestamp, number, hash, parent_hash,
nonce, sha3_uncles, size, transactions_root,
state_root, receipts_root, miner, logs_bloom,
total_difficulty, difficulty, extra_data,
gas_limit, gas_used, transaction_count and
base_fee_per_gas.
For the analysis, a subset of data was taken from the
main dataset, which corresponds to the records from the
Genesis block until April 27, 2021, when the block with
identifier 12322990 was mined. This subset only contains the
fields timestamp, number, miner, difficulty and
gas_used fields. This subset of data was extracted using
the following BigQuery command
SELECT
timestamp,number,miner,difficulty,gas_used
FROM
bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.block
of which result was saved into a file with a size of 1.2 Gb.
Both Bitcoin and crypto Ethereum data sets are saved in
a flat comma-separated CSV file for later loading and pre-
processing with a Python script.
B. PREPROCESSING
The next stage after selecting data was preprocessing each
dataset. This task was carried out with Google Colabora-
tory [40], which is a cloud service offered by Google that
offers a virtual machine environment to run Jupyter-based
Notebooks. On one hand, on the preprocessing of the Bit-
coin data, the columns other than Height and Miner Name
were removed. Additionally, the columns Date, Year, and
Year_Month were created from the Timestamp field.
On the other hand, for the preprocessing of the crypto
Ethereum data, the column miner was renamed as Miner
Name and the column number by Height. As similar as in
the bitcoin file, the columns Date, Year and Year_Month
were created from the field Timestamp, and the remaining
columns were removed.

C. MINING CHARACTERIZATION
In this section, we provide an analysis of mining behavior on
two popular blockchains: Bitcoin and Crypto Ethereum. This
analysis is based on real collected data that has been examined
methodically and in detail using data sciences techniques.
V. RESULTS
In the information analysis process, different algorithms were
designed and coded in the Python programming language in
order to identify aspects such as the number of miners and
number of blocks in different periods of time, the hash rate
of miners, and the percentage of blocks mined consecutively.
In addition, own algorithms and clustering algorithms were
used to create profiles of the miners. On the other hand,
the model presented by [7] was also coded in the Python
programming language. All of the above was done for the
bitcoin and crypto Ethereum dataset.
A. NUMBER OF MINERS
1) BITCOIN
A first analysis of the Bitcoin data indicates that 682676
blocks were mined by 73 different miners in the analyzed
period. In particular, Fig. 1 shows the number ofmined blocks
per year, and Fig. 2 shows the number ofminers per year in the
analyzed period. In this first analysis, it can be seen how the
Unknown miners, those with Miner Name ’Unknown’, are
treated as a single miner, which differs from reality. So we
individualize the miners by creating a new field in the data
set from concatenating the fields ’Miner Name’ and ’URL
Miner’, this dataset is published in Mendeley Data, [41].
As a result of this individualization process on the miners,
198892 different miners were identified in the entire analyzed
period in contrast to the 73miners found first. Fig.3 shows the
number of known miners and the number of unknown miners
for each of the years in the analyzed period.
2) CRYPTO ETHEREUM
A similar analysis was carried out on the ’Crypto Ethereum’
dataset. In particular, this analysis shows that 12322991
blocks were mined by 5430 different miners in the analyzed
period. Fig. 4 shows the number of mined blocks, and Fig. 5
shows the number of miners per year in the same time
interval.

B. HASH RATE/SHARE OF MINERS
1) BITCOIN
For the 682676 bitcoin blocks mined in the analyzed period,
the hash rate distribution is made for that same period. Fig. 6
shows this distribution in which the unknown miners are
taken as one. Because the number of miners presented is very
large, only the miners that have a hash rate greater than or
equal to 0.1% in the entire period are shown, resulting in
FIGURE 5. Number of crypto ethereum miners by year.
29 miners that represent 99.49% of the total hash rate in the
observed period.
FIGURE 6. Bitcoin hash rate distribution throughout the period, miners
with hash rate of at least 0.1%.
In the process of individualization of the unknown Bitcoin
miners, it goes from having 73 miners to 198892 in the
entire time. To analyze the hash rate distribution with all the
miners already individualized in the period, this distribution
is verified with the miners that present a minimum hash rate
of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7% and 1% throughout the period.
Table 2 presents these results.

Based on the data in the table 2 and Fig. 7, it can be seen
that only 11 miners that represent 0.0053064% of their total
number of nodes have a hash rate of at least 1% and together
represent 45.22% of the hash rate in throughout the period.
It is also identified that, of 198824 miners that represent
99.965% of the total miners, present less than 0.1% of total
hash rate in the entire period; in other words, only 68 miners,
that represent 0.0341% of the total of miners have at least
0.1% hash rate in the entire period, and together represent
64.13% of the hash rate in the entire period analyzed. Fig. 7
presents the hash rate distribution for the entire period with
the miners that have at least 1% total hash rate in the analyzed
period.
FIGURE 7. Bitcoin hash rate distribution throughout the period with hash
rate of at least 1% after individualizing the unknown miners.
Fig. 7 shows that of the 11 miners that have at least 1%
of the total hash rate, two of those are unknown and the
remaining nine individually represent mining pools. Taking
as a starting point these 11 miners who individually possess
at least 1% of the total hash rate, the hash rate distribution of
the entire period is plotted year by year in Fig. 8.
FIGURE 8. Bitcoin hash rate distribution over time with hash rate of at
least 1%, after individualizing the unknown miners.
In Fig. 8 it can be seen that all the miners that have a
hash rate of at least 1% in the entire period are present in the
Bitcoin network since the year 2012, only one of them has
remained active since 2012 to the present (May 2021), and
7 of the 11 miners in question are active in May 2021.
To verify the current status of the Bitcoin network in terms
of the hash rate distribution, and taking into account the
number of active miners since 2017, the hash rate distribution
of the entire Bitcoin network is generated from January 1,
2017, until May 8, 2021 (Fig. 9).
FIGURE 9. Bitcoin hash rate distribution with hash rate of at least 1%
after individualizing the unknown miners from January 1, 2017 until
May 8, 2021.
Fig. 9 indicates that for the last four years (2017-2020) in
the bitcoin network only 16 miners that have a total hash rate
of at least 1% for that period, represent 82.47% of the hash
rate of the entire network. From these 16miners, 10 have been
identified and the remaining 6 correspond to unidentified
miners. The Fig. 9 indicates that only 7 of the 11 miners
exceed a hash rate of 5%, accumulating together 68.77% of
the total hash rate.
Fig. 10 shows the hash rate distribution for these 7 miners
in the period from January 1, 2017, to May 8, 2021, seen by
years. In this figure, it can be seen that, of the 7 miners in
question, 6 has been present on the network since 2017, and
one of them since 2018.
FIGURE 10. Bitcoin hash rate distribution over time with hash rate of at
least 5% after individualizing the unknown miners from January 1,
2017 until May 8, 2021.
The hash rate distribution is generated throughout the
period for the 7 miners that have presented the most hash
rate in the last four years, and it is shown in Fig.11. The
results show that, of the 7 miners, ‘‘SlushPool’’ is the only

one that has been present on the network since 2012, ‘F2Pool’
since 2013, ‘AntPool since 2014’ and miners the ‘BTC.com’,
‘BTC.TOP’, ‘ViaBTC’ since 2016 and for their part ‘Poolin’
since 2018.

2) CRYPTO ETHEREUM
For the 12322990 Crypto Ethereum blocks mined in the
analyzed period, the share distribution is made for that same
period. Fig. 12 shows this distribution. Because the number
of miners presented is very large, only the miners that have a
share greater than or equal to 1% in the entire period, resulting
in 13 miners that represent 78.18% of the total share in the
observed period, are analyzed.
FIGURE 12. Crypto ethereum share distribution throughout the period
with share of at least 1%.
To further analyze the share distribution of all the miners
of the Crypto Ethereum network in the study period, this dis-
tribution is verified with the miners that present a minimum
share of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1% over the entire
period, Table. 3 shows these results.
Based on the results in Table 3, it can be said that only 13
miners that represent 0.23% of their total number of nodes
and have a total share of at least 1% (Fig. 12) represent
78.18% of the share in the entire period. It is also identified
that 5366 miners, which represent 98.82% of the total miners,
TABLE 3. Share distributions of some crypto ethereum nodes throughout
the period.
present less than 0.1% of the total share in the entire period;
in other words, only 64 miners, that represent the 1.17% of
all miners that have at least 0.1% share in the entire period,
represent 93.90% of the share in the entire period analyzed.
To identify which miners are currently more important,
the share of the miners that represent at least 1% share is gen-
erated in the period between January 1, 2019, and April 27,
2001, as shown in Fig. 13. The figure indicates that only 11
miners comply with having at least 1% share in the analyzed
period and together present an 82.25% total share. Of these
11 miners, it is identified that 2 of these are not present
in 2020 or 2021. Of the nine miners that have participated
in 2021, 8 have been present since 2019, and one of them
since 2020. For the 8miners that are present in the years 2019,
2020, and 2021, their share is analyzed in the period between
January 1, 2019, and April 27, 2001, Fig. 14. Each of these
miners presents individually by at least 1% share and together
they add up to 77.59% share.

from January 1, 2019 until April 27, 2021.
C. PERCENTAGE OF BLOCKS MINED CONSECUTIVELY
For each of the data sets, an algorithm was applied to identify
the percentage of blocks mined consecutively in the entire
period of observed time, and for each of the years in the period
analyzed.
1) BITCOIN
In the Bitcoin data set, if the probability of mining at least
one block in a consecutive manner is 100%, the longest

FIGURE 14. Crypto ethereum share distribution from January 1, 2019,
to April 27, 2021.
mining chain was 11 blocks, and it had a calculated prob-
ability of 0.0001%, in the observed time. Fig. 15 shows
the percentage of blocks mined consecutively in the whole
period with chains of 2 blocks up to 11 consecutive blocks.
Fig. 15 shows how the probability of mining consecutive
blocks decreases as the number of blocks is greater; this trend
is presented for each of the years. In this analysis, it can
be seen that, for the first four years analyzed (2009-2012),
the longest chain occurs in 2012 with 5 blocks and a mining
probability of 0.0073%. From the year 2013 to the year 2021,
mining chains greater than 5 blocks have been presented,
with the year 2013 presenting chains of 11 blocks and the
year 2014 of 10 blocks with probabilities of 0.0016% and
0.0017%, respectively. The year 2016 presents mining chains
of up to 8 consecutive blocks with a probability of 0.0018%,
In the years 2015, 2018, and 2019, there were mining chains
of up to 7 blocks, and up to 6 blocks in the years 2017,
2020 and 2021, with average probabilities of 0.0030% and
0.0066% respectively.
FIGURE 15. Percentage of bitcoin blocks mined consecutively.
2) CRYPTO ETHEREUM
For the Crypto Ethereum data, it is identified that the longest
chain ofmined blocks corresponds to 17 blocks, which occurs
with a probability of 0.000008% throughout the period, and
0.000128% in 2015 that was when this event happened.
Fig.16 shows the percentage of blocksmined consecutively in
the whole period, with chains from 2 blocks to17 consecutive
blocks. It can be seen that the probability of mining consec-
utive blocks decreases as the number of blocks is greater,
behavior that is presented for the entire period analyzed as
well as in each of the years of that period. It is identified in this
analysis that, every years during the observed period, there
are mining chains of 10 blocks with an average probability of
0.00126%. Likewise, for the years 2019 and 2020, there are
mining chains of 11 blocks with a probability of 0.000044%,
and for the year 2016 and 2018 chains of 12 and 14 blocks
respectively which present 0.00018745% and 0.00004638%
probability of mining.
FIGURE 16. Percentage of crypto ethereum blocks mined consecutively.
D. PROFILE OF MINERS
1) BITCOIN
To create profiles of the current most representative miners
of the Bitcoin network, the 10 miners that make a presence
on the Bitcoin network in 2021 and have at least a 1% hash
rate in the period from 1%, are considered from January 1,
2019, to May 8, 2021. They have a combined hash rate of
76.27% for that period and 73.2% for the period of January 1,
2017, toMay 8, 2021, and of 36.13% in 2009-2021. In Fig. 17
the percentage of active days for each of the 10 miners in the
2019-2021 period is shown together with the hash rate of each
of the miners throughout the period, years 2017 to 2021 and
years 2019 to 2021. It is identified that the hash rate of each of
the miners is higher in recent periods compared to the entire
period of the presence of the Bitcoin network (2009-2021).
Likewise, it can be seen that 7 of the 10 miners have an
active presence ratio ofmore than 87% in the analyzed period.
Only one of those miners has less than 50% presence in the
analyzed period with 35.3%
The day-to-day hash rate of each of the miners is taken in
the period from January 1, 2019, to March 8, 2021 [42], and
it is represented in a vector of 859 positions corresponding
to the each days in that period. The value of each position of
the vector corresponds to the hash rate of the particular miner
on each day. The clustering algorithms K-Means, DBScan,
and Birch are applied to the set of hash rate vectors of the
miners in order to identify a patterns among them. After
applying these algorithms, 3 and 4 groups are generated. For

the case of 3 groups, the parameters for the algorithms are
K-Means (k = 3), DBScan (eps = 1.65; min_sample = 1.0;
metric = ‘‘euclidean’’) and Birch (branching_factor = 23,
threshold = 1.05). In this case, the results of the application
of the different algorithms generated the same 3 groups,
as shown in Table 4.
TABLE 4. Groups formed for the best bitcoin miners with the K-Means,
DBScan, and Birch algorithms to generate 3 groups.
To create 4 groups with the clustering algorithms,
the parameters for the algorithms are K-Means (k = 4),
DBScan (eps = 1.6; min_sample = 1.0; metric =
‘‘euclidean’’), and Birch (branching_factor = 23, thresh-
old = 1.25). In this case, the algorithms created different
groups, as it can be seen in Table 5. The names of the
unknown miners in tables 4 and 5 were truncated for better
visualization. For each of the different groups formed by the
clustering algorithms, it was verified that their elements (min-
ers) are in the range of a mean +/− 1 standard deviation.
2) CRYPTO ETHEREUM
To create profiles of the most representative miners currently
in the Crypto Ethereum network, the 8 miners that have an
active presence in the years 2019 - 2021 and that individ-
ually have at least 1% share in the period, are taken from
January 1, 2019, to April 27, 2021. They have a combined
share of 77.59% for that period and 69.63% for the period
of January 1, 2017, to April 27, 2021, and 57.45% between
2015-2021. Fig. 18 shows the percentage of days present
for each of the 8 miners, in the 2019-2021 period, together
with the share of each of the miners throughout the period,
years 2017 to 2021 and years 2019 to 2021. It is identified
that the share of each one of the miners is higher in recent
periods compared to the entire period of the presence of the
Crypto Ethereum network (2015-2021). Likewise, it can be
seen that 7 of the 8 miners have an active presence of the
100% during the analyzed period and the remaining 99.4%
presence in the analyzed period.
FIGURE 18. Best crypto ethereum miners in the period January 1, 2019 to

The day-to-day share of each of the miners is taken in the
period from January 1, 2019, to April 27, 2021 [42], and it
is represented by a vector of 859 positions corresponding to
the days in that period. The clustering algorithms K-Means,
DBScan, and Birch are applied to the set of hash rate vectors
of the miners. After applying these algorithms, 3 and 4 groups
were generated. The parameters used for the algorithms are

ric = ‘‘euclidean’’) and Birch (branching_factor = 2, thresh-
old = 1.05) and * (branching_factor = 2, threshold = 1.15).
The final grouping is shown in Table 6. For the case of
3 groups, Birch generated two different results options.
For the generation of 4 groups with the clustering algo-
rithms, the parameters for the algorithms are K-Means
(k = 4), DBScan (eps = 1; min_sample = 1), and Birch
(branching_factor= 2, threshold= 1). In this case, the results
of the 3 different algorithms presented the same results,
which are presented in Table 7. The names of the miners in
tables 6 and 7were truncated for better visualization. For each
of the different groups formed with the clustering algorithms,
it was verified that their elements (miners) are in the range of
mean +/− 1 standard deviation.
E. ANALYSIS OF DOUBLE-SPENDING
The research article by [7] presents an analytical solution
to model the probability of a double-spending attack via a
stochastic process. A double-spending attack happens when
an attacker persuades a seller that a transaction has been
confirmed and subsequently convinces the entire network
to accept other transactions that make the first transaction
invalid. If such an attack occurs, then the merchant is left
without the product and the payment, and thus the attacker
keeps the product and the value of the payment.
Recall that a transaction included in a blockwithin the valid
chain has n confirmations if there are n blocks that follow
the block containing the transaction. The model proposed
in [7] assumes that there is a block Br within a branch known
to the honest miners (normally the longest branch) and that
such block Br contains the transaction Tr that credits the
payment to the seller and has n confirmations. To perform the
attack, the attacker has to construct a branch with additional
m blocks starting from the block to which the block Br
points. Both the honest miners and the attacker are in the
task of extending their respective branches. This model for
the double-spending attack is inspired by a catching up game,
in which the attacker’s goal is to make its branch longer than
the valid chain.
This model also supposes that the hash rate of the honest
network and the attacker is constant. Specifically, if the com-
plete hash rate is H , then p ·H is the portion that corresponds
to the honest miners, and q · H is the remaining portion that
corresponds to the attacker, where p+q = 1. Also, it supposes
that the mining difficulty is unchanging for the hash rate H ,
and that the average time to mine a block is T0.
Let ar be the probability that the attacker will be able to
catch up when he is currently r blocks behind. Following
the analysis in [7], ar = min(q/p, 1)max(z+1,0). Additionally,
m is regarded as a negative binomial variable; it represents the
number of successes (blocks mined by the attacker) before n
failures (blocks mined by the honest network), where q is the
success probability. Therefore, the probability for a particular
value of m is given by:
P(m) =
(
m+ n− 1
m
)
pnqm (1)
Combining both probabilities, we can compute the proba-
bility of successfully carrying out a double spending attack,
r , as r :=
∑
∞
m=0 P(m)an−m−1. From this equation, it follows
that
r =
{
1−
∑n
m=0
(m+n−1
m
)
(pnqm − pmqn) if q < p
1 if q > p
(2)
Following these results, an analysis of the success proba-
bility of a double-spending attack for the historical data of
Bitcoin and Ethereum is presented in this work. For both
Bitcoin and Ethereum, the mining data for the year 2020 is
taken from the best miners presented in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18.
For each of the analyzed blockchain networks, 3 miners with
different hash rate/share values are selected. The results are
shown in Table 8.
For these miners, the success probability of a double-
spending attack, r , is calculated for each month of the
140560 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. A. Aponte-Novoa et al.: 51% Attack on Blockchains: Mining Behavior Study
FIGURE 19. Probability of success of a double spending attack on bitcoin
miners.
year 2020. For a miner, r is computed for each q ∈
{q1, q2, . . . , q12} and n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10}, where qi denotes the
hash/share ratio per month for the miner and n the number of
confirmations. Particularly, qi is calculated by computing the
number of blocks mined by the miner in the month i, divided
by the number of blocks mined in the month i. Fig. 19 and
Fig. 20 show the result of this calculation for the Bitcoin and
Crypto Ethereum networks, respectively.
In the case of the Bitcoin network, it can be seen that, as the
hash rate for a miner grows higher and n assumes the lowest
values, the success probability of carrying out a double-
spending attack also grows higher, as expected. In particular,
the highest success probability for carrying out a double-
spending attack was registered for the miner F2Pool, since it
FIGURE 20. Probability of success of a double spending attack on crypto
ethereum miners.
has the highest hash rate and n = 1, as shown by Fig. 19 (a).
This probability was 0.55 in November 2020.
For the other cases, for all miners, it is observed that the
probability of performing a double-spending attack is less
than 0.4. In fact, most of the computed probabilities are less
than 0.2. In Fig. 19 (c) it is observed that, in the specific case
of the BTC.TOP Miner, which presents a lower hash rate,
the probabilities to carry out the attack are very low, being
0.0886 for one confirmation, 0.0114 for two confirmations,
and less than 0.0017 for n ≥ 3.
For the Crypto Ethereum network, the general trend for the
success probability of carrying out the attack is similar to that
of the Bitcoin network. In particular, the success probability
is directly proportional to the share of the miner and inversely

proportional to the number of confirmations. It should be
noted that for the miner 0 × 5a0b Fig. 20 (a), which has
the greatest hash power, the probabilities of performing the
double-spending attack are above 0.65, sometimes reaching
values above 0.7.
For the miner 0 × 52bc Fig. 20 (b), it was found that it
had success probabilities of performing the attack greater
than 0.01 for n ≤ 2. However, for the other cases, these
probabilities are less than 0.01, reaching down to the order
of 0.1× 10−7. In the case of the miner with the lowest share
power, such as 0×005e Fig. 20 (c), the success probability of
a double-spending attack is greater than 0.01 only for n = 1.
For n ≥ 2, on the other hand, the probabilities are less than
0.002, reaching down to the order of 6.2× 10−16.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The decrease in the number of miners along with the cen-
tralization of the hash rate/share are threats to the security of
these blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum), therefore under-
standing the behavior of the miners becomes a relevant
research topic. In this paper, we further analyze the behav-
ior of the miners by following a different approach and
present a miner behavior characterization for both the bitcoin
blockchain and crypto Ethereum blockchain.
We conclude that according to the conducted analysis,
the centralization of the hash rate seems to be a real threat.
On the one hand, for bitcoin, only 18 miners representing
0.00905014% of the total number of miners have 51.01% of
the hash rate in the entire period. In other words, 99.9658%
of the total miners only reach 35.88% of the total hash rate.
On the other hand, for the crypto Ethereum network, only
13 miners representing 0.23% of the total number of miners
collectively achieve 78.18% of the share, i.e. 98.82% of
miners collectively achieve 6.10% of the total share.
In both scenarios, there is a real possibility that a 51%
attack could take place if the most powerful miners get
together, which violates the main general assumption of the
blockchains. Now, there is a real negative incentive to per-
form such an attack because the credibility of the blockchain
network will go to zero, as well as the value of the crypto
assets; thus, a self-protection policy takes place in these
public networks by its members. However, there are plenty
of other blockchains, public and private, in which the value
loss maybe not be too critical to discourage such attacks to
obtain a specific asset. This centralization of hash rate/share
and its risks imply that all new prevention mechanisms to
address this kind of vulnerability must take this new situation
seriously in their considerations.

F. A. Aponte-Novoa et al.: 51% Attack on Blockchains: Mining Behavior Study
As future work, based on the conclusion of this work,
a tool to identify anomalous behavior can be implemented,
to detect a possible attack being performed by a miner,
or group of miners, and generate a general alert to protect
the integrity of the blockchain. Another way to address this
issue may be to design a new consensus protocol that will
prevent the possibility of overpowering the blockchain by
the miners with the highest hash rate while distributing the
hash rate and preventing its centralization in a small set of
members.
