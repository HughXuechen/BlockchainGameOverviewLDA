Abstract—The peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading creates a 
platform for all microgrid users to exchange their energy 
surplus and demand without the presence of a centralized 
authority. With P2P, the dynamic electricity market between 
nodes will be developed, thus increasing the overall throughput 
of the microgrid. To ensure the energy transactions in local 
energy trading meet the highest level of integrity, the 
blockchain system is implemented. Appropriate classification 
and structuring the literature on viable designs for local energy 
trading can assist researchers in effectively developing their 
subsequent planning for the local energy market. This study 
reviews the current research related to market clearing 
methods for blockchain-based P2P energy trading for 
microgrid system. The focus is on the auction theory, 
constrained optimization, game theory and agent methods.  
Keywords—energy market clearance, energy market design,

I. INTRODUCTION
The traditional electrical power system is designed to 
supply massive energy to consumers. Since the transmission 
and distribution of power are centralized and owned by the 
grid operator, originally it was never meant to incorporate 
the consumer-owned generators. However, with the 
proliferation of distributed energy resources (DER), 
particularly the renewables, the sense of developing a 
decentralized generation and consumption is growing. The 
transformation from the centralized to the distributed 
structure is realized in the form of microgrids; this concept 
is envisaged to be the future of electric power. The expected 
mass penetrations of PV, wind biomass and other renewable 
sources will be the key factors for the development of the 
microgrid systems. These development open-up numerous 
possibilities and opportunities, but at the same time present 
challenges that were not anticipated with the conventional 
system.   
Microgrid is independent energy distribution system and 
a fundamental building block of the smart grid system. It 
enables the continuously consumption of the energy from 
the DER and decreases the dependency on the main grid 
supply. The microgrid system can be connected to the main 
grid system or operated in a standalone (islanding) mode. 
The decentralized manner of the microgrid offers several 
potential inventions. One of the exciting new ideas is the 
peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, i.e., an energy purchasing 
and selling transaction between the participating parties 
(nodes). The P2P energy trading creates a platform for all 
users with DERs to exchange their energy within the 
microgrid system without the presence of a centralized 
authority [1].  The participants, known as the prosumer 
(producer and consumer) balances its own local generation 
and consumption, as well as looking for opportunities to sell 
its surplus energy at the optimum cost. In the case of power 
shortage, the prosumer will seek to purchase the lowest 
price of energy from its neighboring peers [2], [3]. To 
encourage participation in the energy market, P2P energy 
trading system will take place in a local energy market 
(LEM), where energy transactions are available for public 
view.  
The P2P energy trading exhibits a range of advantages: 
1) it is allows energy sharing model to cope with the
increasing penetration of renewables, 2) supports
autonomous microgrid system and 3) complement the
decreasing feed-in-tariff (FIT) rates [4]. On the opposite
side, there are several inherent drawbacks of P2P. The main
concern is the system exposure to security and privacy
issues that affect the integrity of the system [5]. This
contrasts with the conventional power system, in which the
records managed and protected by the utility company. Now
that such authority is absent, the P2P must provide a
mechanism to ensure safe and secure passage for all
transactions. This is important so that the entire microgrid
ecosystem can be kept transparent and reliable. One solution
to this problem is to introduce the distributed ledger that
incorporates blockchain technology [6]. The blockchain
system facilitates energy exchange by storing the collection
of transaction information in blocks, while validating all
transactions through the network nodes. Furthermore, the
tamper-proof chain of data is ensured through encrypting,
the protection and confidentiality of each transaction.
With the incorporation of blockchain into the P2P 
energy trading platform, the issue of trust deficit among the 
nodes is minimized. In addition, the smart contract is 
executed to regulate the transactions based on set of rules 
that are mutually agreed by all participants. In the context of 
a decentralized P2P trading, smart contracts are used to take 
over the role of centralized agents. All data associates with 
the market clearing and trading transactions will be written 
in the smart contract, which is transparent to all participants. 
Once the smart contract has been established in the P2P 
energy trading network, it will be coded and remain 
unchanged. Modification of the content in the smart contract 
are impossible without the consensus of all participants. All 
data of the successful transactions will be kept and generate 
as a new block and will be chain together with the previous 
block to form a block-chaining. 
The rise of prosumers highlights one of the most 
exciting trends in the power system especially in renewable 
energy. It is expected that the incentives that prosumers 
would obtain from the participating in P2P trading will be

significant, since prosumers are in charge of setting the 
terms and conditions of the smart contract [7]. Since the P2P 
is not regulated by a third party, there is a need to determine 
the market clearing method. The market clearing in energy 
trading or sometimes known as the market settlement, 
involves the algorithm for buying or selling the energy, 
auctions or bidding announcements and certain actions upon 
the energy transactions. Efficient and reliable market 
clearing technique is crucial for a sustainable and resilient 
P2P trading system. This paper includes a review of 
previous studies on the market design approach for P2P 
energy trading, including the implementation of the 
blockchain. The designed market clearing mechanism has 
been analyzed for its decentralization manner and security 
aspects in blockchain-based P2P energy trading system. 
This paper is organized into six main sections. Section II 
covers fundamental overview on the P2P energy market 
trading while in Section III, a brief introduction regarding 
blockchain systems including the concepts been discussed. 
Section IV presents the information regarding market 
clearing method in P2P trading. In Section V, detail 
discussion on the different market clearing approaches in 
energy trading is provided in terms of distributed manner 
and the privacy in local energy exchange. Finally in Section 
VI, we conclude the paper and briefly summarize the 
contributions of having the blockchain system along with 
the P2P energy trading in the microgrid system. 
II. OVERVIEW OF P2P ENERGY TRADING MARKET 
The P2P for microgrid involves not only electrical 
connection between prosumers, but also the information 
sharing among them [3]. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 1. In 
principle, every node is expected to control and manage its 
own energy generation, energy storage and their energy 
consumption. In the P2P energy trading, the node that is 
capable of generating surplus energy (that beyond its local 
consumption) is considered as seller. At the same time, it 
can be considered as the potential buyer too. It is expected 
that the incentives that prosumers would obtain from 
participating in energy trading between peers will be 
significant, since prosumers are in charge of setting the 
terms and conditions of the smart contract [7]. The goal of 
P2P energy trading is to optimize the electricity price by 
breaking away from the centralized grid infrastructure.  
main requirement is by enabling the direct communication 
among various prosumers with DER [8]. The P2P energy 
 
Fig. 1. Structure of P2P energy trading in local energy market in 
microgrid system 
trading is a digital technology which enables the information 
to be exchange among peers and assist the system operators 
to monitor and control the distribution networks. 
A. Market Design in P2P Energy Trading 
Energy policies adopted by different countries currently 
seek to encourage prosumers to consume its self-generated 
energy. The LEM provides a local balance between power 
generation and load as well as to eliminates the need for 
expensive grid expansion [9]. This includes the 
establishment of new market channels that enable an active 
involvement and direct contact with consumers. Via 
exchanging and using renewable and local electricity, the 
customer can gain economic benefits, while providing local 
power balance for supply and demand side. Since the 
microgrid system works well under autonomous mode, it 
can create a new energy market within local community. 
These features lead to significant benefit in P2P trading 
system where generation and consumption can be executes 
locally. 
To evaluate the efficiency of any marketplace design in 
the energy trading, one must identify and defined the market 
players. The three types of market players are seller, buyer, 
and mediator. The seller, or also known as an energy 
supplier is anyone who can produce or store the energy in 
the community. On the other hand, a player is an entity that 
require energy from other nodes. The mediator is an 
intermediary that gather buyers into an energy exchange unit 
to negotiate the purchase of power from electricity suppliers 
or sellers. There are three market structures that are widely 
been implemented in P2P energy trading network [10]: 
1) Distributed P2P: The seller and buyer involved in 
this type of market structures interact directly on their 
energy trading without central control or intermediaries.  
2) Centralized P2P: Participant of the energy trading in 
this case controlled by a mediator or a community 
supervisor to sell or buy surplus energy between the same 
community or participants from other community. 
3) Hybrid P2P: This type of market is a combination of 
fully decentralized and centralized P2P market, where the 
interaction or energy exchange between the seller or buyer 
may be executed directly or through a mediator. 
III. THE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM 
The P2P transactions process requires a mechanism to 
ensure the integrity and visibility of each is maintained. 
Furthermore, it allows for secure implementation of the 
pricing system for the energy exchange market. The 
technology that are able to facilitate transparent and 
decentralized transactions is the blockchain [11]. The 
blockchain can be categorized as a type of distributed 
ledger, where it can store and verify the data or transactions 
without involving any third party to validate and manage the 
ledger. While the original application of blockchain was to 
facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies, blockchain could 
also be used to facilitate the trading of electricity. 
Blockchain system is a future trend of P2P system for 
energy exchange technology. Blockchain technology 
effectively keep track on the energy transactions in the P2P 
energy trading architecture.

The rationale behind applying blockchain idea in the 
energy market is to remove the trust deficit between 
stakeholder of the P2P network; thus allowing the 
prosumers to purchase and sell energy in a trusted 
environment [12]. By using blockchain system, each 
participant will hold a copy of the transaction records and 
engage in a consensus protocol for verification process by 
other members. Fig. 2 demonstrate the architecture for P2P 
energy trading with blockchain network. This architecture 
will enable the node owner (prosumer) to sell their surplus 
energy directly to another node that having energy deficit. 
All successful transactions will be chain in the distributed 
ledger in the blockchain network after been verify by the 
smart contact. Hence, this provides a platform of LEM for 
buying and selling of the solar PV generation. As shown in 
Table I, the blockchain architecture is capable to provide 
solutions to the security and integrity of the transaction 
issues in the energy market [13].  
The security and integrity of the transaction data is 
enhanced by the blockchain platform [14]. It instills trust 
among peers and eliminates reliance on a centralized 
electricity management. Since blockchain is an immutable 
ledger structure, it provides reliability and unalterable 
transaction data. Hence, it could prevent any malicious 
activities in P2P energy trading network [1]. 
IV. THE P2P CLEARING METHOD 
To expand the DER usage and to benefit the 
stakeholders,  the market settlement or clearing method has 
been a subject that of interest in P2P energy trading 
implementation [15]. The development of market clearing 
mechanism is a crucial phase in the process of designing an 
effective energy trading system, so that the amount paid for 
the electricity price will generate a profitable incentive for 
the prosumers. Market clearing aims to make sure the 
energy vends effectively at price called market-clearing 
price (MCP). The MCP is the price at which the

energy supplied is equivalent to the energy demand. It also 
known as the equilibrium price of products, where in this 
case known as the energy trading price. Energy demand will 
be increased when the energy price been set appropriately, 
perhaps with the suitable clearing approaches. 
The purpose of market clearing is to allow the 
participants to place their offers (bids) from their generated 
energy during certain time in a day; the clearing mechanism 
process automatically decides the successful or winning 
bids. In microgrid system, the engagement of peers in the 
electricity market will lower down the energy cost as the 
prosumers can is not subjected to the profit made by the grid 
operator. The technique used for the market clearing 
depends on the probabilities, market design structure, 
players behavior and particular regulations of the market. 
Based on the system design, several approaches can be used 
for the market clearing technique in local energy trading. 
These approaches can be combined to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency. There is a common market clearing methods 
by recent studies that can be regarded as significant in the 
design of current P2P energy trading systems, with or 
without the blockchain implementation. Most widely used 
market clearing techniques are auction theory, constrained 
optimization, game theory and agent- based methods. These 
methods extensively been used for a different application in 
the literature related to the power system. Table II 
summarizes the features of these techniques. 
V. DISCUSSION 
The literatures regarding the market clearing in P2P 
energy trading system are summarized in Table III. As can 
be seen, not all designs incorporate blockchain technology 
[16], [17].  The role of participants is important in local 
energy trading [18]. The local energy market should be 
capable in providing a trust less environment. As in 
conventional transactions, one need to deal with central 
authority or third-party organizations to perform a trading. 
The development of a comprehensive and appropriate P2P 
energy market also poses additional problems in terms of 
security. A secure and reliable database system need to be 
addressed in every market design to records all the details 
such as transactions data, that are transparent and tamper-
proof. In this section, the energy trading market design in 
the blockchain-based research works are discussed for the 
decentralization (distributed) of P2P energy trading and 
security features.

using a blockchain technology in order to create a 
decentralized platforms for energy trading system. In a 
decentralized blockchain system, no participant has to 
identify other participant or to trust them since each of them 
hold the same database in forms of distributed ledger. A 
fully decentralized blockchain-based P2P trading is 
provided in [19]–[21] which establishes an analytical 
framework for blockchain-based microgrids by adopting 
double auction methods for market clearing purposes. 
Enabling P2P energy trading in microgrids in long term is 
considered to be one of the most significant aspects of 
blockchain technology [22]. The application of non-
cooperative game between the consumers that aim for 
decentralized demand side management via P2P trading can  
be found in [23] and for decentralized energy supply as  
implemented in [24]. 
The decentralization feature of blockchain is considered 
to be well matched with the decentralization characteristic 
of P2P energy trading. Electricity supply is no longer 
provided by centralized large generators from the generating 
stations, but rather by small customers with DERs [25] 
including electric vehicles [26] and [27] with double auction 
market clearing strategy to obtained a balance MCP. 
Meanwhile, author in  [28] developed a decentralized 
platform for energy trading with Ant-Colony Optimization 
method, includes an addition of blockchain layer to support 
the security of the system as well. Author [29] established 
an agent method framework at the residential area in Perth, 
Australia to developed a decentralized P2P trading with 
blockchain. In the era of energy decentralization and 
digitalization, having a central point for data may not be the 
most efficient approach, which makes blockchain 
technology become interesting. 
B. Privacy 
In the implementation of any market design for 
decentralized P2P energy trading, smart grid system with a 
large number of components and complex connections may 
be a security, privacy, and trust concern which requires new 
and innovative technologies to address [30]. Blockchain 
provide an advantage in energy systems in terms of privacy 
and security through its cryptographic and digital signatures 
features. Its tamper-proof nature can digitally secure all the 
relevant information with high resiliency to cyber-harm and 
forger. This in turn, generates trust among all traders and 
facilitates the verification of shared information. A double-
layer framework of energy transactions based on blockchain 
in multi-microgrids is proposed in [13] to provide 
decentralized trading, information transparency and mutual 
trust system of each node in the trading market. 
Brooklyn Microgrid project case study in [31] and [32] 
is local community project that generates energy from solar 
to powered neighborhood. It aims at increasing the security 
of power supply for the local community, integrating local 
generation into the energy system, and empowering the 
community with double auction market clearing approach. 
Another application for double auction theory method in 
promoting secure trading environment between home 
prosumer can be found in [33]. With the aim of enabling the 
distributed optimization by using ADMM technique for 
market settlement, the market trading system in this paper 
[34] is developed with consortium blockchain platform. 
Smart contract will act as a virtual aggregator to ensure the 
safety of every transaction along the process. Author [35] 
propose a secure energy blockchain in industrial Internet of 
Things (IoT) and propose optimal pricing strategy by 
Stackelberg game theory approach. Research works in [36] 
and [37] have been conducted to address the security issue 
for the energy information between peers with blockchain 
using strategic game theory method for energy market. 
Author [38] propose a blockchain based system, which is 
based on a parallel double-chain that combined with a high 
frequency verification mechanism to enable a trusted and 
secure settlement of electricity trading transactions.

VI. CONCLUSION 
Energy trading in the local energy market is a recent and 
emerging topic of research that draws growing interests. 
Although this paper deals mainly with the market clearing 
approaches for P2P energy trading, there are many areas of 
research that can be expanded in the blockchain 
implementations. The integration with blockchain system is 
another concentrate area, where this paper reviewed the 
electricity market design for P2P energy trading with 
blockchain implementations. The literature in this paper is 
organized firstly with brief introduction on P2P market 
design trading comprises of market structures, market 
players and market clearing strategy as well as the 
blockchain system. 
Blockchain technology may provide a useful solution. 
Nevertheless, it may pose challenges but it offers a great 
opportunity in the interfaces of energy market design and 
implementation. From the review papers on a different 
clearing market that enable P2P energy trading, blockchain 
technology allow the energy to be trade among peers in 
decentralized and secure environment. Furthermore, 
blockchain-enabled energy trading mechanism can 
efficiently encourage electricity sharing among the 
prosumers and in overall improve the energy efficiency of 
the distribution system.
