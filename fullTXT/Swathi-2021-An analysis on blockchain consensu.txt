Abstract— The revolution with technologies happens very 
often, here is one such technology called "Blockchain" which 
will be a game-changer in many functional sectors of the 
society. Initially, this technology was developed to support 
cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin 
etc).Now a days it is gaining the attention of the researchers in 
almost the entire field. The consensus protocol in the 
cryptography and peer to peer architecture is one of the 
essential parts of the blockchain technology. The best 
consensus protocol in a blockchain system provides the fault 
tolerance. These censuses in blockchain are broadly classified 
in to two types. The absolute-finality consensus protocol and 
probabilistic-finality consensus protocols. In this paper, the 
different types of censuses protocols are discussed along with 
their working, strength and weakness. It also gives the 
overview on the different types of blockchain technology with 
their advantages and disadvantages. At the last we also 
presented a comparison of these consensus protocols by 
considering different qualitative parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Blockchain technology is a system of storing the data in 
such a way that makes it hard to   modify or hack the system. 
Basically it is a digital ledger of transactions that is replicated 
and scattered over the network of computer systems on the 
blockchain. Initially, Satoshi Nakamoto described a new 
decentralized cryptocurrency in the Bitcoin white paper. 
Later Bitcoins occupies the blockchain technology and 
spread over the world [1]. Many cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain-based ventures start appearing immediately. 
Hence blockchain becomes one of the emerging technology. 
Blockchain technology combines many technological 
inventions like cryptography, peer to peer networking, 
distributed systems and many more. Along with this 
blockchain provides high security framework for 
cryptocurrencies in such a way that anyone can’t hack the 
transactions in the network. For this justification, in different 
fields, blockchain technology can be widely adopted.
Many applications of Internet of Things, Supply chain 
management, financial systems and medicals fields are using 
blockchain. But the use of blockchain in these fields facing 
many challenges, where designing of the best consensus 
protocols is one of the major challenge. The consensus of 
blockchain is that every node uses the identical distributed 
ledger.   As the traditional software architecture maintains a 
central server, the maintenance of the consensus is very hard. 
Hence the other nodes should be within the alignment of the 
centralized server.  But in case of distributed network like 
blockchain every node in the network acts as both server and 
client. These nodes exchange their information to reach the 
consensus. The nodes which are malicious or offline will 
affect the entire consensus method. Hence it is important to 
design a best consensus fault tolerance protocol to minimize 
this phenomenon. The system's chosen consensus protocol 
should also support the different types of blockchain. There 
are three basic types of blockchain namely, public 
blockchain, private bolckchain and consortium blockchain. 
All these are explained in the following section along with 
their Advantages and disadvantages.
Each of this type of blockchain is adopted in various 
applications. So the selected consensus protocol should 
relevant to the application. In this paper, popular consensus 
protocols of blockchian along with their performance are 
presented.    
For the distributed systems, there seems to be no 
appropriate consensus protocol, the consensus protocol has 
to compromise with the availability and consistency. Also it 
has to address Byzantine Generals Problem. In this paper the 
most common blockchain consensus protocols that can 
successfully manage the Byzantine Generals problem are 
discussed [4].
It is possible for a potential hacker to overtake one block 
in a chain, but the computation is also compounded as the 
valid blocks in the emerges, and so overthrowing a long
chain takes a large number of computational power. [15] 
[16]. 
The paper is structured as follows. In the First section the 
introduction about the blockchain and consensus protocol is 
given. The second section describes the different types of 
blockchains with their pros and cons. The third section 
illustrates the different types of consensus protocol for 
blockchain with their working principles. In the final section, 
the comparison of the different protocols is  done by 
considering various qualitative parameters. 
II. CATEGORIES OF BLOCKCHAIN
The three main categories of blockchains are public 
blockchain, private blockchaion, permissioned blockchain 
,consortium blockchains. 
A. Public blockchain 
In this type of blockchain anyone can join and leave as 
they wish. . The disadvantages of public blockchain are less 
security and no privacy for transactions. It requires more 
computational power. Bitcoin is the best example for this 
type for blockchain. In bitcoin the miners validates the 
transaction and receives transaction fees in the form of

bitcoin. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the suitable examples for 
public blockchain [5]. 
B. Private blockchain: 
The private blockchain restrict the access to transactions. 
It is a permissioned blockchain where only the authorized 
entity can access the network .This also gives some grants to 
the participants to access the network.  It is a more 
centralized network, because only a certain number of users 
can control the network. Hyperledger and Ripple(XRP) are 
the best example for private Blockchain [3]. 
C. Consortium blockchain: 
Consortium blockchain is also called as federated 
blockchain. Here multiple organization uses the platform. 
This type of blockchain is similar to private blockchain but 
they are different. This type of blockchain is suitable where 
many organizations work on the single industry and when 
they require more secured transactions.

III. CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS FOR FAULT TOLERANCE  
A. Proof of Work(PoW) 
In each round of consensus, it chooses a node to generate 
a new block by computational power competition.   Here, the 
node which is in the competition has to find the solution for 
cryptographic puzzle. The node which finds the solution first 
can get the chance to create a new block.  Fig.1 shows the 
block creation flow in PoW. It is very tricky to solve the 
puzzle. The node needs more computational power to adjust 
the nonce value to get the exact answer. It is possible for a 
malicious actor to overthrow single  block within  a chain, 
however as the correct blocks within the chain emerges, the 
load is compounded, so a huge proportion of computational 
power is needed to overthrow a long chain. It is normally 
used in Bitcoin and Ethereum[5][6]. 
Fig. 1. Proof of Work Flow 
B. Proof of Stake (PoS) 
 In Proof of Stake, choosing the rounds for a node to 
create a new block is completely depends on the held stake. 
It is not going to consider the computational power. The PoS 
does not adjust nonce for every time[10]. It uses less 
computational power to reach the consensus[11]. Many 
cryptocurrencies like Nxt, PPcoin, ouroboros and so on, use 
this PoS Consensus protocol[7][8][9]. The working of the 
PoS is shown in the fig. 2.
C. Delegated Proof of Stack (DPoS):  
The principle of Delegated Proof of Stack is to allow the 
node which holds the stake vote to choose block creators. 
This can avoid the stakeholder to create the nodes by 
themselves. They can grant the rights of building the blocks 
to the members whom they assist. This method decreases 
computing power consumption to 0.The fig. 3 shows the 
flow of DPoS.  If the delegate fails to create the block during 
turns, they will be removed and stakeholders take the lead to 
identify the new nodes to replace these delegates. The 
stakeholder’s vote will be used by the outstretch a consensus 
in a best way. DPoS is less expensive as well as more 
efficient when compare to PoW and PoS.

D. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) 
 Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is one of the 
consensus protocols for Fault Tolerance Protocol. It is one of 
the more practical protocols with minimal algorithm 
complexity. It has five important phases as follows. Request, 
pre-pare, prepare, commit and reply [12]. The same process 
is explain the figure 4. The client forwards the message to 
the primary node. Then it will forward to the other three 
nodes. If these three nodes crashed, then the message passes 
through the said five phases. Then to complete the round the 
nodes will give reply to the client.  PBFT is a consistent 
protocol and each node maintains same state in each round of 
consensus. The Stellar protocol is the extension of the PBFT 
and it uses Federated Byzantine agreement [13]. 
Fig. 4. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [2] 
E. Ripple: 
It is one of the open source protocol for payments. It 
starts the transactions by clients and broadcasts to all over 
the network through the nodes. In Ripple the consensus 
process is carried out by validating the nodes. All the nodes
in the Ripple maintains a table of genuine node called as 
Unique Node List (UNL). These nodes which are in the list 
can vote the transactions that they support [14]. In Ripple 
every validating node sends transaction set as a proposal to 
other validating nodes. Once receiving this proposal, the 
validating node checks all the transaction in the proposal. If 
the transaction of the local transaction set is same as the 
transaction which is in the proposal, then the proposal gets 
one vote. When to reaches to the 50% of the vote, then it 
moves to the next round. If it reaches to 80%. Then it will be 
recorded in the ledger. The process of the ripple is shown in 
the fig5.

Pow, PoS and DPoS protocols belongs to probabilistic-
finality protocols. These protocols allow only the 50% of 
stakeholders to hold the stake. But PBFS and Ripple 
provides the fault tolerance up to 33% and 22% respectively. 
The fault tolerance of these protocols is illustrated in the fig 
6.
V. CONCLUSION
The stability of the blockchain system is given by 
consensus protocol. Through this consensus protocol a node 
can approve on certain value or through some transactions. 
In this paper, the different types of blockchain are introduced 
along with their advantages and disadvantages. Then the 
most popular blockchain consensus protocols are introduced 
along with their applications scenario. The working 
procedure of the consensus protocols are also summarized 
with their strengths, weakness and comparisons. It is 
observed that, only the designing part of a consensus 
protocol with fault tolerance is not sufficient. But usage of 
the protocol also plays a major role.
