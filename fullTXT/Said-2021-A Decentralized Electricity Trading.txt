Abstract—Connected electric vehicles (CEVs) can help
cities to reduce road congestion and increase road safety.
With the technical improvement made to the battery sys-
tem in terms of capacity and flexibility, CEVs, as mobile
power plants can be an important actor for the electricity
markets. Especially, they can trade electricity between each
other when supply stations are full or temporarily not avail-
able. In this article, we propose an advanced decentralized
electricity trading framework between CEVs in parking lots
based on consortium blockchain, machine learning, and
Game theoretic model. We design a distributed smart con-
tract solution based on a stochastic bidding process, which
helps CEVs to sell and buy electricity with their maximum
profitability. Finally, numerical simulations with MATLAB
and Solidity are conducted to prove the effectiveness of
our proposed solution. Also, a comparison with another
method in terms of CEVs’ profitability improvement and
energy trading management is provided.

I. INTRODUCTION
CONNECTED electric vehicles (CEVs) [1]–[3] are ex-
pected to help cities to manage several problems related
to public safety, public services, transportation, and energy.
They can be in near future the norm in automobile industry
by their expected substantial technological and socioeconomic
development in the city, especially for their impact on power
management. Added to its benefit in term of oil dependence
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction, the CEV, as
part of smart city concept will be one of the most important
challenging issues for demand response (DR) systems in smart
grid. Indeed, as it is a new division in the automobile industry
by the zero emission and low noise [4]–[7], CEV can help in the

grid stability by its charging or discharging operations. The CEV
can reduce the overloading situation of reginal transformers as
well as offering ancillary services such as frequency and voltage
fluctuations regulation [6]–[8].
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the
number of hybrid and battery-electric vehicles grew to a stock
of two million EVs worldwide by the end of 2016. This number
is expected to reach 60 million by 2030 [9]. As a result, a
high CEV penetration can make the data and electricity man-
agement more challenging. To deal with this idea, facilities for
CEV integration to smart city have to be designed in the way
promote economic and social welfare issues around the data
exchanging and electricity routing. The CEV can be a great
candidate for easy electricity trading deployment [10], [11] and
for efficient new business models around the charging needs. It
can be considered as an enabler for the decentralization of the
electricity and or data by replacing central services in microgrid
system such as load balancing, DR management, frequency, and
voltage regulation, etc. The CEV can accelerate the transition
to smarter electricity system by allowing new business model
based on social welfare and profitability maximization, auctions
(i.e., the ascending-bid auction, the descending-bid auction, the
first-price sealed-bid, and the second-price sealed-bid auction),
economic incentive mechanisms and peer-to-peer (P2P) electric-
ity markets. However, the current electricity system is a major
handicap to establish an efficient trading energy process between
neighbors. First, because it uses a centralized architecture which
obligated neighbors to sell electricity back to the grid before
getting payed at a regulated low price with delay time. Second, it
forced sellers and buyers to expose their real profile information
during the trading process, which is crucial for CEV users’
privacy and parking lot safety as a part of the global security
in the city. The blockchain technology which recently attracted
investors and governments is expected to resolve these issues
and transform the way to make business. Blockchain which
is known by its first application in finance: the Bitcoin [12],
[13], is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of database
where all participants can perform P2P transactions without
any central authority. The last is replaced by the techniques
of sharing responsibility and distributing trust to verify the
transaction legibility. The blockchain can be public, private, or
consortium network [13]. It presents a huge potential in enhanc-
ing current value chains and making new ones that eliminate
intermediation cost with trust and transparency improvement

[14], [15]. With its specific application called smart contract
used for example by Hyperledger and Ethereum blochchain
platforms, blockchain technology can be used in several sectors
such as healthcare, financial industries, insurance, storage of
medical records, security, education, Internet-of-Things (IoT),
and electricity management. For example, blockchain can be
simply used to promote the electricity trading [16]–[21] for
microgrid and between CEVs as mobile power plants in the
city. Indeed, the CEV sellers of electricity can get paid imme-
diately and the electricity transaction will be more efficient and
trustworthy and more secure as it is P2P market without any
trusted third part (intermediaries). Kang et al. [22] proposed
the PETCON which is a consortium blockchain scheme for
a local P2P electricity trading model between plug-in hybrid
EVs (PHEVs) based on double auction mechanism for the price
negotiation between players. It is proven that double auction
mechanism [23] is suitable for a large number of market par-
ticipants with fast demand and supply fluctuation; this case is
far from the real trading electricity market where the number
of sellers and buyers can be limited. However, game theoretic
(GT) models deal deeply with the competitive situation of the
market based on bidding strategies and individual preferences.
Moreover, double auction models present hard nonlinearities,
which grow complexity in the analysis phase compared to the
empirical approaches.
In other hand, as a part of Artificial Intelligence, the machine
learning (ML) techniques are used to improve the data man-
agement for smart cities issues using vehicles [24]. The ML
mechanisms are expected to improve the efficiency of schemes
or iterative algorithms by analyzing the execution process and
suggesting new features to identify or to update variables and in-
corporate them in the future iterations. Adding ML to blockchain
capabilities in electricity trading can provide deeper analysis of
market data and can bring more effectiveness to smart contract
to increase the profitability of participants.
In this article, we propose an advanced trading electricity
framework for CEVs in parking lots. This system is based on
blockchain, ML and GT system to overcome the need to the
mandatory trust third part in traditional market and to improve
the smart contract efficiency and to optimize the profit margin
for CEVs.
Our contributions are as follows.
1) We are the first to consider the combination of
Blockchain, ML, and GT in electricity trading system and
we propose a decentralized electricity trading framework
(DETF) in parking lots between CEVs.
2) We develop the HLProfitX algorithm as an adaptive bid-
ding system based on ML and GT approach for CEVs
to sell and buy electricity with their maximum profitabil-
ity using the new cryptocurrency HAPPY LIGHT Coin
(HLCoin).
3) Finally, numerical simulations are presented to prove the
effectiveness of our proposed solution.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present some related works. Section III presents
the system overview considered in this article. In Section IV, we
formulate our proposed smart contract model. The performance
evaluations are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes this article.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Electricity Trading
Recently, the literature review of the trading energy in context
of smart grid is being vast and covers various aspects of energy
management in centralized and distributed ways. For example,
a trading energy schemes are proposed by [25] and [26] based
on centralized technique where all participants are aggregated.
These mechanisms show their limits especially when individual
participant wants to trade a few amount of electricity with a
real-time constraint in an open market according to a bidding
process between sellers and buyers. Indeed, added to the non-
competitiveness business process when the central unit forced
all participants to use the regulated electricity price, a real
issue exists on the users’ personal data protection because the
aggregation process is a one failure point.
Kou et al. [27] proposed an energy trading model based on
game-theoretic approach between utility and microgrids during
the restoration period. Added to the aggregation mechanism
used between all players, the economic strategy of this scheme
considers a reduced voltage stability effects on each player. The
model does not consider EVs participation in such market. To
cope with the problem of the centralized architecture, several
studies focus on peer-to-peer (P2P) trading energy [28], [29].
Indeed, to reduce the impact of the EVs penetration on the smart
grid and their total daily energy cost, Alvaro-Hermana et al.
[28] proposed a P2P energy trading system between EVs. This
scheme does not take onto account the maximization of service
provider benefits in context of applicable business models.
B. Blockchain-Based Energy Trading
The blockchain as a new distributing trust network is high-
lighted by four main features such as the data integrity, the
security, the trustiness, and the decentralization approach. The
blockchain is expected to modernize the grid and to be part of
energy industry by developing the electricity trading especially
the P2P energy transaction. Many industrial approaches address-
ing decentralized electricity management using blockchain are
started. For example, in 2016 the first known project in this
topic is the Brooklyn microgrid in New York [17]. Indeed, the
electricity provided by solar panel can be traded between home
neighbors and a smart contract based on Ethereum blockchain is
used for the energy and payment transaction. Another project is
the German RWE, which uses blockchain to develop the interac-
tion between public supply stations and electric vehicles (EVs)
[16]. There are some research efforts, which match the energy
management with the blockchain technics. For example, Horta
et al. [19] proposed virtual distributed grid based on blockchain
to allow homes to transact energy with neighbors. Also Zhang
et al. [20] presented blockchain applications in context of
Internet of Energy (IoE). We mention that for all these industrial
or scientific works, there is no transaction between electric cars
directly. Sharma et al. [30] presented a system of Internet of

Vehicle (IoV) able to exchange energy by a blockchain energy-
efficiency transaction. The authors do not show any effective
results to prove their proposed system. A recent paper [31]
proposed a blockchain-based energy trading scheme to supervise
and manage the energy trading process. The work presented in
[32] proposes a contract-based energy blockchain for secure EV
charging in Smart Community. However, for all these three last
papers, the proposed schemes are concentrating on the security
and fairness issue during the P2P energy trading while not
considering the profitability maximization for the participants
in this energy market.
In this article, we propose a new DETF between CEVs in
parking lots based on consortium blockchain, ML, and GT
model with stochastic approach.
III. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In this section, we consider a system such as illustrated in
Fig. 1, where a number of CEV sellers and CEV bidders of
electricity are sharing a parking infrastructure area equipped by
an activated blockchain server. Furthermore, we suppose that
CEVs can communicate wirelessly between each other’s. We
assume that each CEV is equipped by its own smart meter that
determines the quantity of electricity sold or purchased during
a period of time. Also, CEV sellers and bidders can sent/receive
messages to/from blockchain server. We suppose a consortium
blockchain based on Hyperledger platform, which provides a
cryptocurrency such as HLCoin as a new decentralized digital
currency used to manage energy credits and to monetize or trade
any services, goods, and commodities between CEVs.
We suppose that each CEV (electricity seller or buyer) has
a unique identity number (IdN), which is communicated to
the blockchain server at the beginning. Also, all participants
(CEV buyers, sellers) receive from the blockchain server their
public and private encryption keys (public_K, private_K) used
for addressing and sending signed transaction. We assume that
the blockchain server can verify and certify the identity of CEVs
and their wallets Wacc (cryptocurrency account). Also, it verifies
the authenticity and privacy [33], [34] of any transaction.
In this article, we focus on the auction mechanism as a part of
the smart contract which is used for our decentralized electricity
trading system.
Our model is based on three elements: CEV seller, CEV bid-
der, and smart contract. Fig. 1 shows our proposed architecture
for electricity trading between CEVs.
Indeed, there are eight events used to explain the data and
electricity exchange between CEVs, blockchain, and smart
contract:
1) a smart contract is made between all stakeholders and
deployed to the blockchain;
2) New auction is made: a CEV seller which wants to sell
electricity stored in its battery, informs the blockchain by
its available quantity of electricity for selling;
3) CEV bidders will submit their bids;
4) smart contract runs an auction model (based on electricity
requested information or game theory) to determine the
winner and price;
5) the selected CEV bidder is awarded the electricity;
6) the seller is awarded by HLCoin;
7) the electricity transaction is initiated; and
8) the transaction is finalized.
Fig. 2 shows the conceptual data blocks used in our DETF.
The block number identifies the current block, the hash, and the
previous block fields are the hash values describing the current
block content and the previous one, respectively. The transaction
field designates the exchange process between CVE buyer and
seller. The creation timing and the size of the current block are
stored respectively in timestamp and size field. The merkle root
field is the hash value of all previous hashed pair in the tree.
For the block building mechanism, after the creation of the
genesis block (the first one), a participant (CEV seller or buyer)
which is interested on the electricity trading in a parking lot
and after ensuring its identity, it can create a new block, linked
it to the chain and broadcast it on the network. Receiving this
block by the other participants, they proceed on its validation
by verifying the signature, checking the hash, and checking the
validity of the payload. The last action is used to ensure that data
are protected from unauthorized modification. The valid block
will be added to the chain and it cannot be tampered. The invalid
block will be discarded from the chain.
In our proposed energy trading system, we suppose that an
efficient communication network system with secure privacy
preservation mechanism is used to link all participants in the
trading system. As a result, we consider that there is no problem
with CEV’s privacy in this article.

We acknowledge that in terms of reliability, performance, and
smart management, the DETF needs an increased connectivity
that could result in security and privacy issues such as the risk
of cyber-attacks which can be a challenging problem for the
electricity trading system in parking lot. The CEVs ‘ Privacy is
the practice of protecting confidential data and information about
CEV’s behaviors, location, interests, etc., to others who have
no authorization to see such data or information. Technically,
privacy is a mechanism to protect personal data and it is typically
realized by anonymization, obfuscation, differential privacy, and
cryptography [35], [36]. The CEV’s privacy issues could slow
down our DETF deployment in realistic scenario. The DETF’s
communication system needs to be trusted by providing a secure
environment to allow for privacy data to be used to perform
trading process between CEVs correctly.
IV. SMART CONTRACT MODEL
The smart contract is a digital protocol that simplifies the
agreement process between different participants by imposing
predefined clauses such as the auction and payment functions.
This contract has to be accepted by all remaining parties (CEV
sellers and buyers) by signing an acceptance in the beginning of
the connection to the blockchain server at the parking lots. As
presented in Fig. 3, the data bidder is composed of Bidder profile
(a cryptographic key representing the ownership of the CEV),
the quantity of electricity requested, the transaction timing and
the price. The data seller is composed of seller profile (a crypto-
graphic key represents the ownership of the CEV), the surplus
quantity of electricity to be sold, and the transaction timing.
Every CEV buyer submits multiple bids to the blockchain. The
Fig. 3. CEV smart contract.
CEV buyer needs at most one seller, and we assume that no
duplicate bids can exist on the same CEV seller.
In the following, we present the details of our auction technics
used in this article. We suppose that a set of CEV buyers
with their corresponding quantity of energy requested and CEV
sellers with their corresponding energy to sell can be written as
follows:
NCb = {1, 2, . . . , Nb} (1)
Pb =
{
Pb1 , Pb2 , . . . , PbNb
}
(2)
NCs = {1, 2, . . . , Ns} (3)
Ps =
{
Ps1 , Ps2 , . . . , PsNs
}
. (4)
Each CEV calculates the quantity of the power needed to
buy or ready to be sold by taking into account its current
battery lifetime, the degradation coefficient, and its depth-of-
discharging (DoD). To simplify our model, we suppose that
the factors influencing the CEV battery life such as extreme
temperatures, overcharging, the charging, and discharging rates
are not considered in this article.
A. Auction Model Based on Energy
Requested Information
The energy transaction in the open local electricity market
such as the parking will happen after receiving the information
of: 1) the energy dedicated for selling from CEV sellers and, 2)
the electricity requested for CEV buyers.
The energy transactions for the CEV sellers highly depend on
behavior of all participants (the battery CEV capacity, SoCs) and
their individual preferences in terms of the tariff structure and
timing. Each CEV seller usually calculates their own benefits
before energy transaction in the open market. The CEV sellers
need to conduct the cost-benefit analysis considering different
price policy.
A CEV buyer will participate in the local energy transaction if
the rate is lower than the utility grid (rg). Also, car seller will sell
it surplus electricity to CEV buyers if the price is greater than

quested Information.
Input: NCb, NCs, Pb, Ps, rfg , rlet, rg , ρCEVb
Output: CEV sellers selected
1. CEV sellers declare their surplus electricity quantity
and their range of tariff.
2. According to its priority level defined by 6 and its
preference (the quantity of electricity requested, the
transaction timing and the price.), each CEV buyer
selects the adequate car sellers. /∗ CEV buyer can buy
from one or several CEV seller∗/
3. Start payment process
4. Start energy transaction
the feed-in tariff (rfg). Therefore, the rate of the local energy
transaction (rlet) can be written as follows:
rfg ≤ rlet ≤ rg. (5)
The priority for the energy transactions in the open local
electricity market in the parking lot is based on the energy
shortage of different cars. Indeed, the CEV with the lowest
energy requested has the highest priority for purchasing energy
from car sellers in the same parking lot. Thus, each car with
energy requested is sorted and ranked in the ascending order of
energy shortages. Thus, the priority vector of energy requested
of different cars can be written as follows:
ρCEVb
= [ρ1 ρ2.. ρM ]T (6)
where ρ1 is the priority assigned to the car with the lowest energy
shortage and ρM is the priority assigned to the CEV with the
highest energy requested.
The overall benefit of this local energy trading in the same
parking is analyzed based on (5). A biding and competitions
process is running before the electricity transaction.
B. Adaptive Bidding Based on ML and Game
Theoretic Approach
In this section, first we consider a predictive bidding approach
(PBA) based on stochastic bids, which are able to learn from the
current electricity market environment by including iterations
of the profit margin (PM ). Each CEV trader (seller or buyer)
tries always to maximize its PM (see Fig. 4) and announces the
adequate bidding price [35].
Second, we present our game theory approach to match the
CEV sellers (j ∈ NCs) with the CEV buyers (i ∈ NCb).
Each CEV trader determines its next price (rCEV ) based
on the price limit (rl) and the profit margin according to the
TABLE I
PROFIT MARGIN VARIATION
TABLE II
PARAMETER rtarg, R AND L VARIATION
following equation:
rCEV (n) = rl [1 + PM(n)] (7)
wheren is the iteration index. Equation (7) shows that the margin
and profit for the CEV seller follows directly the PM variation:
it increases /decreases when the PM increases /decreases. The
case is opposite for the CEV buyer and its margin and profit
follows inversely PMvariation (see Table I).
The PM for the next period is given by
PM(n+ 1) =
rCEV (n) + σ(n)
rl
− 1. (8)
The parameter σ(n) describes the variation between the cur-
rent price and the next one. This parameter is modeled as
σ(n) = γσ(n− 1) + (1 − γ)Δ(n) (9)
where γ is the weighting coefficient which describes how the
profit is altered. The parameter Δ(n)is the Widrow–Hoff delta
[30], which designs the variation between the current price and
the target one. This parameter is given by the following equation:
Δ(n) = β [rtarg(n)− rCEV (n)] (10)
where β is a learning rate coefficient. The price rCEV (n)
converges to the target price rtarg(n) at speed of β.
The target price is modeled as
rtarg(n) = R(n)rq(n) + L(n) (11)
where rq is the last announced price (last iteration), R and L
variation is given by
R(n) = R(n− 1) + Rmax
step
L(n) = L(n− 1) + Lmax
step .
(12)
Rmax, Lmaxand step are a setting parameters (see Table II
and Algorithm HLProfitX).
Now, as a result of the iterations described by (7) to (12), each
CEV sets a selling//buying price (rCEV ) based on information
from the current electricity market environment. The energy
dedicated for selling Psj j ∈ NCs can be distributed between
different CEV buyers i ∈ NCb, through a portion λi. It can be
written as
Psj = Psj
∑
i∈NCb
λi. (13)

SAID: DECENTRALIZED ELECTRICITY TRADING FRAMEWORK (DETF) FOR CONNECTED EVS 6599
The utility of the CEV sellerj can be given by the following
equation:
ψj(Psj , Ps−j
) = PsjrCEV sj
∑
i∈NCb
λi (14)
where Ps−j
is the vector of energy dedicated for selling for all
sellers other than j.
The main objective of the CEV sellers is to maximize the sum
of utilities for individual CEV sellers and the objective function
can be written as follows:
max
rCEV sj
,j∈NCs
⎛
⎝ ∑
j∈NCs
ψj(Psj , Ps−j
)
⎞
⎠
= max

⎠
Subject to : Ps ≤ Pb, rCEV smin
≤ rCEV sj ≤ rCEV smax
and
Psj = Psj
∑
i∈NCb
λi (15)
where rCEV smin
and rCEV smax
are the minimum and the max-
imum rate of selling electricity respectively fixed by the CEV
sellers.
In the same time, the CEV buyer i ∈ NCb can purchase
energy from different sellers j ∈ NCs, through a portion δi.
It can be written as
Pbi = Pbi
∑
j∈NCs
δj . (16)
The utility of the CEV buyer i can be written as follows:
ϕi(Pbi , Pb−i
) = PbirCEV bi
∑
j∈NCs
δj (17)
where Pbi is the energy requested by car buyer i and Pb−i
is the
vector of energy need for all buyers other than i.
The main objective of the CEV buyers is to minimize the sum
of utilities for individual CEV buyers and the objective function
can be written as follows:
min
rCEV bi
,i∈NCb
⎛
⎝ ∑
i∈NCb

and
Pbi = Pbi
∑
j∈NCs
δj (18)
where rCEV bmin
and rCEV bmax
are the minimum and the maxi-
mum buying rate fixed by the car buyers in the beginning.
As the selling/buying actions of one CEV influence all the
others (CEV buyers and sellers) and as the bidding and auctions
process depend on the strategy of all participants, we adopt a
game theory to resolve (1)–(12).

3. Each CEV buyer :
1) calculate their rCEV b according to (7)–(11),
2) Calculate their utility ϕ according to (17),
3) Determine optimized rCEV b minimizing the
electricity cost according to 18,
4) Send (rCEV b, Pb) to CEV sellers.
4. Each CEV seller:
1) Calculate their utility ψ according to (14),
2) Select the best CEV buyers according to eq. (15).
5. If no best buyer

9. End
The game equation related to the problem described by
(13)–(18) can be written as follows:
Φ = {(NCs ∪NCb), Ps, ψj , Pb, ϕi} (19)
where the vector Ps represents the strategy of all CEV sellers
and the vectorPb represents the strategy of all buyers during the
bidding process.
The solution to this problem is a Stackelberg Equilibrium [12].
We propose the algorithm HLProfitX for our auction model
based on ML and game theory.
From the description of our proposed HLProfitX, we can see
that the complexity is in the order of O(NCb ∗NCS), where
NCb and NCs are respectively the number of CEV buyers and
CEV sellers in our system.

sions of the proposed scheme performance.

4) We suppose that an efficient communication network
system with secure privacy preservation mechanism is
used to link all participants in the trading system. As a
result, we consider that there is no problem with CEV’s
privacy in this article.
We conduct 1000 runs of simulation and we use Monte Carlo
technique to extract the average values for each setting. We
use MATLAB and Solidity [39] to perform the simulations.
To prove the performance of our proposed scheme, we study:
1) the average CEV utility comparison between our proposed
HLProfitX with our proposed AMERI and PETCON [22] for
Fig. 6. Average CEV utility variation using our AMERI and
HLPROFITX.
Fig. 7. Average CEV utility variation using our HLProfitX and PETCON
[22].
the same electricity quantity provided by CEV sellers and 2) the
average buying and selling price using our proposed HLProfitX
and PETCON [22] when the regulated electricity price (Smart
Grid) is varying.
Fig. 6 compares our HLProfitX (represented by blue color)
and the AMERI (highlighted by yellow color). From Fig. 6 it is
clear that, in terms of maximizing the trading of the electricity
provided by CEV sellers, the HLProfitX algorithm outperforms
the AMERI one and it makes trading electricity smartly more ef-
fective. This result can be explained by the fact that in HLProfitX
algorithm all CEVs (sellers and buyers) participate in the trading
electricity procedure which is based on the game theory. Also,
they have the same chance to be selected as the winner without
any privilege granted to anyone regarding its profile (power
needed or sold and its proposed price) compared to AMERI
one where CEV buyers are ranked and selected according to
their electricity needs.
To prove the performance of our proposed scheme, we study
the behavior of our HLProfitX algorithm compared to the PET-
CON [22] in terms of maximizing the trading of the electricity
provided by CEV sellers. For this issue, Fig. 7 compares our

HLProfitX (represented by blue color) and PETCON (high-
lighted by red color). It is clear that our HLProfitX outperforms
the PETCON one. This result proves the effectiveness of our
proposed HLProfitX algorithm. It can be explained by the fact
that our HLProfitX is based on ML model, which allows CEVs to
learn from the current electricity market environment before an-
nouncing their bidding price. Also, our HLProfitX scheme uses
game theory technique for the bidding process between CEVs
while PETCON uses double auction mechanism to maximize the
selling price without any consideration of the market situation.
Our HLProfitX maximizes the trading quantity of electricity
between CEV sellers and CEV buyers in the same time. It gives
better management of the quantity of the electricity sold by CEV
sellers.
Table IV presents the observation results obtained from Fig. 7,
which illustrates the performance of our HLProfitX in term of the
CEV utility. As shown in Table II, it is clear that our HLProfitX
improves the trading of the electricity provided by CEV sellers
and buyers with a saving rate of 21%.
We simulate now the average buying and selling price varia-
tion. Fig. 8 compares our proposed HLProfitX (represented by
blue color) and PETCON (highlighted by red color). It is clear
that our HLProfitX outperforms the PETCON one.
Our HLProfitX maximizes the profitability for the CEV sellers
and CEV buyer in a better way compared to PETCON one
(selling price is high; the buying price is low). PETCON gives
lower revenue for CEV sellers and high cost for the charging
process to the CEV buyers compared to our HLProfitX. From
Table V, we can see that these results prove that our HLProfitX
increases CEV seller revenues with 5.5% and helps them to set
an optimal selling price and gives more satisfaction level to CEV

buyers by lowering the electricity price by 3%. To conclude, our
HLProfitX outperforms the PETCON in terms of improving the
profitability for CEVs (buyers and sellers).
VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, an advanced DETF between CEVs in parking
lots based on consortium blockchain, ML, and GT model was
proposed. We design a distributed smart contract solution based
on stochastic bidding process, which helps CEVs to sell and buy
electricity with their maximum of profitability. We conducted
numerical simulations with MATLAB and Solidity, and com-
pared our proposed HLProfitX algorithm to PETCON [22] and
the effectiveness of our proposed solution was proved.
As a future works, we plan to extend this article and we
propose to study our scheme in large scale with realistic testbed
considering renewable electricity integration with microgrid ar-
chitecture. Also, the open electricity market with multicharging
service constraints could be included with possible incentives
for EV buyer and seller to participate in grid stability process.
