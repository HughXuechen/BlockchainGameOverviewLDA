Abstract. Monetization is a way to earn money from products, soft-
wares or services. Many video game companies use monetization to
sell items, bonus or even money to customize the user experience or
achieve quests easily in their games. Even though the cryptocurrencies
are becoming more and more popular, few games use cryptocurrencies as
a real form of monetization, which means that there is a potential for its
application. The purpose of this paper is to compare the most used cryp-
tocurrencies for games, based on some important characteristics, discuss
which is the most suitable cryptocurrency for gaming platforms and pro-
pose an architecture for gaming companies use inside the games using
cryptocurrencies.

monetization
1 Introduction
According to Mishkin, 2015, monetization is the name given to the process of
exchanging anything: a product, service or software, for a specific value that can
be used to legally buy and sell goods. In the universe of video games, moneti-
zation is used to sell games and additional content to increase the custom user
experience [5]. Every gamer has a different experience, making it necessary to
adapt the game to the most suitable monetization, according to the user profile.
More and more games are using custom monetizations to generate revenue and
increase the way the player interacts with the game [3].
Since the beginning of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMO), the
ideia of virtual coins was discussed, for example, in the game Everquest from
Verant Interactive. Inside Everquest, the users populated a world named Norrath,
where they could create an avatar and live their virtual lifes, using the game’s
currency; (Castronova, 2001) studied in details the social game mechanics and
the macroeconomy of buying and selling items inside and outside the game
(which was illegal from the company perspective). He concluded that inside the
game, there was a supply and demand law on rare items: when a rare item was
in high demand, its price rises in avatar-to-avatar market [4].

Based on the context, the cryptocurrencies can co-exist with electronic games
due to using them will make the transactions faster and trackable. The idea of
this paper is to present in details how the games monetize their activities nowa-
days and to propose an architecture to explain how cryptocurrencies could be
implemented in well-known games to increase security, tracking and monetiza-
tion of anything inside the game. Besides, discuss some cryptocurrencies that are
being used on games based on their technology and market cap, comparing sim-
ilarities and differences between them. In Sect. 2, concepts and related studies
about monetization in games are presented; in Subsect. 3 some concepts about
crypto-games and applications are raised; in Subsect. 4, the authors present a
comparative study between all gathered cryptocurrencies in the raised crypto-
games and in the last section, the proposed architecture for cryptocurrencies and
games is proposed.
2 Monetization
At the beginning of game’s history, the games were created by laboratories or
computer scientists at universities. Then, the arcades games came to life where
players could exchange money for coins to play on machines. They were formerly
sold on floppy disks at small hardware specific stores, then the evolution came
after some years and soon the video games were created, in which games were
sold by physical copies [7], the most used method to monetize games until today.
Monetization in games is one of the most important phases of designing a
video game. It is becoming more and more important for publishers to earn
revenue from their games, most of them have been using a “free-to-play” app-
roach where the users can download the game without paying anything, expect
if they want to customize their gaming experience by buying custom items,
energy, weapons, etc. [6]: Plants vs Zombies 2 allows the users to buy plant
types to improve the gameplay and hence the score; in Kingdom Rush Frontiers,
to level up easily, the user can buy power-ups to increase the character health
and explode enemies [6]. Usually, the player does not buy these goods using
cash or some kind of currency directly, the game has a proxy that connects to a
third party financial company where the user can buy them using credit cards
or another form of exchange [6] and that is where the cryptocurrencies could
help the publishers. Despite mostly being a electronic game, some games sell
physical goods to customize characters and improve gameplay mechanics, like
the game Disney Infinity that sells physical toys representing new characters
and environments [6].
Besides the “free-to-play” approach and the retail method to monetize games,
there are many other forms of classifying monetization in this industry: David
Perry, former CEO of a cloud gaming platform and Chief Creative Officer from
Acclaim Games, in 2008 at the Social Gaming Summit mentioned 29 business
models for game monetization based on the book “E-commerce: Business, Tech-
nology and Society” from Kenneth Laudon and Carol Traver [1,2]; Tim Fields
and Brandon Cotton in their book “Social Game Design” explain many ways
Real and Virtual Token Economy 871
to generate revenue from games using three basic models: the Classic Download
Model, the Signature Model and the Freemium Model [7]. Scott Rogers presented
eight models of monetization: Trial; Freemium; Free-to-play (F2P); Download-
able Content (DLC); Season Pass DLC; Membership; Premium and Subscription
[6]. Basically, all forms presented by different authors aim to earn money from
different types of games and can be summarized into major types: Retail Pur-
chase, In-game Microtransactions, Digital Download, Subscription Model and
Indirect Monetization [8]. In this paper five types of models are presented: Trial
Model; Retail Purchase; Digital Download; Subscription Model and Freemium
Model.
In the Trial Model, the publisher launches a version of the game that is not
complete, it is a sneak peek of how the entire game will be, including how the
mechanics will work, the visual of the characters and the game’s world. Players
download it and can try the game without paying anything and the publisher
hope they will pay for the full version [6]. This is a common way to attract
players on consoles like Playstation [11] and Xbox [12]. For example, the games
Final Fantasy VII Remake and Far Cry 4 allow the players to play a limited
time on the game (demo play).
The Retail Purchase Monetization is the most conventional way of monetizing
games, the users pay for the physical copy of the game they want, like a CD and
are ready to play the game [8]. It is a model that attracts few people each year
due to the digital version of the games that sometimes is more affordable. That
change of mind can be seen on the release of the new Playstation 5, where the
player can choose between buying a more expensive version of the console with
CD input or a low-priced version only for digital downloads.
In the Digital Download Model or Classic Download Model, the publisher
makes an advertising campaign about the game that is being created, captivating
and engaging the players to download the game and play it. Some examples
are the mobile stores for phones and tablets [10,14]; the Steam website [15]
containing a plenty of games with different characteristics, that diversify the
target audience and the digital stores from consoles like Sony Playstation [11],
Microsoft Xbox [12] and Nintendo Switch [13].
In the Subscription Model, there is a concept about game time. Instead of
buying the entire game and additional packages as soon as the publisher launches
some additional content, the users pay a monthly, quarterly, annual subscription
to pay or only pay the time they will play [7]. The majority of games that use
this kind of model are MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
Game), like World of Warcraft from Blizzard, launched in November 2004, which
can use the Freemium Model (to download only the base game) and Subscription
Model for buying a specific period of time. Besides, the players can also buy
mounts and mascots to customize the gaming experience and help them inside
the game. Figure 1 and 2 show these two cases. Despite being an interesting
way of monetizing a game, the real challenge of using it is to keep the player
interested on the content of the game as the time goes by.

Real and Virtual Token Economy 873
In the Freemium Model or Free-to-Play, the users do not pay for downloading
the game [6,7]. One of the greatest example of this kind of model is the game
FarmVille from the Zynga company. The players could play for free, but could
speed up some boring tasks that need friends to complete or time to wait. The
publisher encourages the players to pay for time, virtual goods, locked contents
and DLCs (Downloadable Content). It is becoming more and more popular,
specially on mobile games.
Despite being completely distinct models, some games can benefit from more
than one monetization model to specific parts [6,7]. The Word of Warcraft game
is a fine example: beyond the subscription monetization, the player can also buy
mounts and pets.
In 2009, Facebook created a system called Facebook Credit so all the games
inside his platform could use a common currency, with the idea to earn a per-
centage on the revenue of the games and also increase security on user’s trans-
actions. A few developers were against the idea due to the Facebook ’s fee to do
that: almost 30% of the transaction [7], on the other hand, the community as a
whole accepted the idea well. One of the benefits of Facebook ’s system is to give
friends a gift with credits to spend in any game they want [7].
After the creation of Blockchain and the cryptocurrencies, some games using
the Blockchain’s technology appeared and attracted attention to how this type
of technology can impact the industry of games. The next section will discuss
more about it.
3 Crypto Games
From the very beginning of the history of cryptocurrencies, there are ideas on
how to use them for games. Some examples are: Dragon’s Tale; MinecraftCC ;
Gambit. In 2010, the most famous indie game to use Bitcoin was called Dragon’s
Tale: a mix of MMO with casino, which had several activities based on four cat-
egories: Luck; Skill; PvP and Tournament [17]. For example, the Luck category
has an activity called Palace Garden, in which players dig eight holes in the
Chinese imperial garden. Each hole may or may not contain Bitcoins and when
it finds two or three holes that have Bitcoins, the number increases.
In 2012 the first server to run Bitcoin was created along with Minecraft, the
so-called MinecraftCC, in which players earned fractions of Bitcoins in exchange
for building blocks and killing monsters. Despite community support and adver-
tisements to maintain the project, in 2016 it was discontinued. After a while, in
2013, Gambit appeared, in which players could bet against each other in classic
board games or cards using Bitcoin, it functioned as a form of virtual casino. As
can be seen, in the early history of cryptocurrencies, almost all applications for
games were some kind of virtual casinos or gambling applications.
Following this trend, a cryptocurrency appeared with this goal in 2014:
DigiByte, which runs on top of the Blockchain technology [16]. The idea was
to establish a connection between digital games and the tokens generated by
the cryptocurrency. Even with all the effort to create this environment, projects
using DigiByte were paused in 2017.
874 I. R. R. da Silva and N. Omar
A year after the creation of the DigiByte cryptocurrency, Blizzard created an
internal World of Warcraft game token for players to exchange their real coins
for virtual gold so they could spend or sell at auction houses. Security has been
improved, because if a player bought tokens at the auction house, he could use
it only after thirty days, which helped prevent fraudulent accounts [18].
Looking at the potential of game monetization and all the applications above
using crytocurrencies, some companies developed researches allying cryptocur-
rencies/Blockchain with games, as it can be seen on Table 1. The Blockchain
Game Alliance was founded in 2018 with the main aim of spreading crypto games
and exploring the creation of games with distributed ledger technologies.

Analyzing all the history of gaming application with cryptocurrency, that is
how the Crypto Games were born. Crypto Games is the name given to every
game that uses distributed ledgers to operate the game and a cryptocurrency
for exchanging items or characters for money.
There are many benefits of using blockchain in games, some researchers have
already raised them [19,20]: the rules of blockchain games are transparent, every-
one can see what the game is about and what the player can do or not; it guar-
antees the ownership of items, characters or whatever element that the player
owns inside the game [19]; with this guarantee, the owner of them can reuse
these elements in other games inside the same Blockchain, like CryptoKitties
and KittyRace [19]. KittyRace reuses some elements of the CryptoKitties game,
so you can play both games with the same account [19].
https://patents.google.com/
Real and Virtual Token Economy 875
Although it is a good strategy to use blockchain for designing games, [19]
raised some restrictions about the visual design of the game due to technical
limitations. It is a promising application but huge companies are still at an
advantage on this aspect.
4 Cryptocurrencies in Games
Nowadays there are a large variety of crypto games on the internet for everybody
who wants to play: they goes from gambling games to RPG games (Role-Play
Games) [20]. Exploring deeper the cryptocurrencies atop of the most popular
games to date, the authors present a table (Table 2) with some of these games
and the cryptocurrencies they use as a base for transactions.
Table 2. Popular crypto games and their respective cryptocurrency.
Name of the game Cryptocurrency
CryptoKitties Ethereum
KittyRace Ethereum
Satoshi dice Bitcoin
TronBet TRON
EOS knights EOS
0xUniverse Ethereum
As seen in the table above, there are four main cryptocurrencies used in
games: Ethereum, Bitcoin, TRON and EOS. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency
created and yet is used in various gambling games [17]. Although the market
capitalization of the bitcoin is the biggest one with $ 96 billion dollars, according
to Coinbase platform, Ethereum has a lot of potential since the majority of
games operates atop of it. One of the reasons why Ethereum (second-largest
cryptocurrency by market capitalization) is the most used in games is because
of its functionality of smart contracts and the DApp infrastructure to build a
game or a application on it easily. DApps are becoming popular on the blockchain
world since anyone can make an app with an interface to interact with the user
in any programming language and contact the server in which the blockchain
is running [9]. Another advantage of using Ethereum instead of Bitcoin is the
transactions time: Ethereum can handle more transactions per time than Bitcoin,
it also can support any type of computation and the creator of the DApp can
make his own rules [24,25].
Other cryptocurrencies like TRON and EOS also use the concept of DApp
application. An annual report made by Dapp.com informed that TRON is the
second most used DApp, losing only to Ethereum, which represents the majority
of gaming platforms [26]. In Table 3 the authors bring a brief summary of the
876 I. R. R. da Silva and N. Omar
Table 3. Dapp market summary in 2019 with Ethereum, EOS, Steem and TRON [26].
All ETH EOS Steem TRON
Total number of dapps 2,989 1,822 493 92 520
Active dapps 2,217 1,129 479 80 482

Transactions 3.26B 24.52M 2.81B 85.72M 290.28M
DApp market in 2019 by Blockchain, emphasizing the number of DApps on
Ethereum.
Analysing this data and the proposal of each cryptocurrency whitepaper [27–
30], the authors come up with four main important characteristics for a gaming
cryptocurrency: Transaction Fees (if the cryptocurrency has fees to transact);
Smart Contracts (whether it has the possibility of implementing a smart contract
to make the game smarter); Scalable (it refers to the ability of the cryptocur-
rency to scale in terms of numbers of transactions) and Performance (if the
decentralized network bears many transactions per time). The results of rising
these characteristics are on the Table 4.
Table 4. Comparative between the main important characteristics raised by the
authors and the cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency Transaction Fees Smart Contract Scalable Performance
Bitcoin X
Ethereum X X
TRON X X X X
EOS X X X
From the scenario raised above, the cryptocurrency that is most suitable for
games is EOS. It does not have any fees to play, so the player does not need
to transfer funds to the account to make any small transaction, it scales and
performs better than the others, since uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm,
differing from the others that uses Proof-of-Work (Bitcoin [27] and Ethereum
[29]), Delegated Proof-of-Stake (TRON) [28].
Besides EOS, TRON can also be another candidate for gaming as it is growing
in Dapp applications in 2019. The number of active Dapps in EOS are almost the
same as TRON Dapps, this comes from the fact that these two cryptocurrencies
are mostly used for casinos platforms that involves gambling, Table 5 illustrates
the market dominance by category on a daily basis.
Even though Ethereum is not fully scalable, it represents the majority of
dominance in gaming category (28%), followed by EOS (15%), TRON (12%)

and Steem (12%). Since Ethereum came before the others, this may be the
reason why developers prefer using it, for security concerns.
5 Proposed Architecture
This section provides some problems that cryptocurrencies could solve in games,
along with a explanation about the proposed architecture and strengths of using
it.
The video game industry is one of the biggest industries in the world. Accord-
ing to New Zoo, a research company about game market insights, the global
games market has a market cap about $159.3 Bi only on 2020, which is a growth
of 9.3% compared to last year [21].
As a well-known fact, the descentralized applications, the blockchain tech-
nology and its cryptocurrencies represents a world where third-party companies
will not have much influence on markets. Instead of using the services from this
companies, like credit card, the video game companies could benefit from ser-
vices from blockchain and cryptocurrencies to ensure the security of the player’s
money and its personal data [19,20], which means it will reduce the third party’s
partnership.
There are many problems on the actual finance structure of the games: first,
the players need to trust their credit card data or bank account to a third-party
company, which could lead to vulnerabilities and information leak if a hacker
attacks the company, what has happened recently with some games [22,23]. On
2020, hackers modified some game’s database to generate items or virtual cash
for their own account, so they could sell on a market [22]. During the coronavirus
pandemic, these attacks are becoming more frequent, due to the fact that the
players are often online and unsuspecting any attack. The attacks range from
pishing to theft of sensitive information such as credit card data [23].
878 I. R. R. da Silva and N. Omar
The proposed architecture of this paper could solve the theft of credit card
information, since the player does not need to enter any credit card information,
only the cryptocurrency address. Figure 3 presents our proposal of solution.
Fig. 3. Proposed architecture.
In the solution, the publisher of the game only needs the blockchain to guar-
antee the ownership of the items between players and secure the player’s game
cash. The player can buy the game cash using the address of his cryptocurrency
wallet: he transfers funds between his wallet and the game’s wallet. As appointed
in the previous section, some cryptocurrencies that could be used on the game
is EOS and TRON, due to their beneficial features and network hashrate. When
the transaction is approved by the blockchain, the player has two options: buy
or sell items, armor, etc. using his new balance from other players or just play
the game. He could also receive his game cash back in form of cryptocurrency
for his wallet.
This type of architecture can ensure the security by using blockchain for val-
idating transactions: the hackers will not be able to attack the monetary system
or the trading system, because of the immutable feature of blockchain. And also,
they will not be able to steal the player’s credit card information or his balance
from the wallet, since the cryptocurrencies use Asymmetric Encryption Cryp-
tography, Hashing and Consensus Algorithms to secure the wallet, the network
and personal data of the users.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
Since the beginning of the game’s industry, monetization is a way of earning
money from the players. Each game use a different type of monetization or
combine different types to achieve a better game experience.
In this paper the authors discussed about the importance of the crypto games
and their benefits, as well as the different types of cryptocurrencies that could
Real and Virtual Token Economy 879
be used in games based on some important features. The proposed architecture
demonstrated what could be done in the financial structure of the game to
prevent hacker attacks and information theft, which guarantees the integrity of
the whole system and could be used in any games, even the ones that already
exist.
For future work, the most suitable type of games for blockchain will be anal-
ysed, other crytocurrencies not raised on this article will be compared and a
further research DApp platforms for games will be done.
