1 Introduction
The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) have revolutionised the concept of
conventional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) into Internet-of-Vehicles
(IoV), ensuring an overall connectivity of a vehicle with not only other vehicles on
road but also with every other object including passengers’ smart phones, external
management platform, navigation systems and other road users, thereby forming
an Intelligent transportation system (ITS). The potential benefits of IoV include
increased passengers’ safety, smooth traffic flow and availability of infotainment.
Also, with an increase in vehicle density on road over the past few decades, high
risk of accidents and traffic jams appear very common in daily transport and
thus seriously threat road safety [1]. Safe driving conditions can be achieved by
implementing IoV in which a vehicle or other connected device can initiate timely
and efficient message dissemination in emergency situations, such as accidents
[2]. The oncoming vehicles may re-route themselves to avoid traffic congestion by
receiving an alert prior to entering into an affected area. However, IoV encounters
many challenges in implementation of an efficient message dissemination solution
because the vehicles behave differently than other wireless nodes. Due to the

dynamic characteristics and complexity of vehicular networks, IoV possesses
some specific characteristics and demands to look after some particular challenges
discussed below.
1.1 Characteristics and Challenges of IoV
The communication environment in IoV is variable. For example, a motorway
is open and allows one direction movement of vehicles with high mobility. A
lane change or a brake event must be communicated timely to the concerned
vehicles in order to avoid collision. Therefore, a lightweight networking protocol is
required. Multiple vehicles sending the same message may result in packet collision
and broadcast storm. The connected vehicles must be able to select appropriate
relay nodes among themselves, which can effectively forward a message to a
large number of vehicles [3]. A central node like a Road Side Unit (RSU) can
be used for message dissemination. However, it requires a large investment for
installation [4] and its volume and placement positions are crucial for system
performance [5]. Moreover, RSU assisted routing protocol may result in higher
latency because of increased route discovery time and hops per route [6]. Since low
latency is an important criteria when propagating messages to fast moving vehicles,
a decentralised network in which vehicles can select relay nodes among themselves
independently without any central authority (CA) is desired as a more scalable and
cost-effective approach than the networks dependent upon RSU [7].
On the other hand, a residential area contains random movements and obstacles
like tall buildings with the presence of relatively larger number of connected
devices. An incident occurring in a street cannot be directly witnessed by passengers
travelling on an adjacent road. In such situations, it is also essential for vehicles in
IoV to authenticate a message before dissemination to maintain trust and security
in the network. A malicious vehicle may generate a false message about an incident
which did not actually occur on road or deliberately mark an authentic message
as fake [8]. Moreover, due to increasing privacy concerns, the identity of a vehicle
must not be revealed if it sends a message. However, anonymous announcements
can affect the credibility of a message [9]. Public key management by CA is one
of the solutions to privacy but large scale networks in dense areas would result in
running of several cryptographic operation requests at the same time which is not a
feasible solution [10].
Although message dissemination, trust management, privacy and security in
connected vehicles are widely discussed in literature [11–13], there is a need to
develop an integrated approach in which efficient and trusted communications
of IoV can be managed in a decentralised fashion. Furthermore, to maintain the
sustainability of message dissemination in IoV, economic modelling is needed
which results in an efficient incentive distribution strategy to encourage positive
cooperation and punish negative behaviour of vehicles. There are two common
types of incentive strategies: price based and reputation based. In price based
strategy, messages are treated as commodities which are exchanged for virtual
Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy for Internet-of-Vehicles 125
credits [14, 15]. On the contrary, reputation based strategies use measurement
of trustworthiness to enforce cooperation. A threshold of reputation is set to
distinguish a node behaviour as malicious or non-malicious. A punishment scheme
is usually applied for malicious behaviour [16, 17]. Game theoretical analysis [18]
suggests that an integrated strategy including the advantages of both price based and
reputation based schemes is more effective in promoting cooperation and detecting
malicious behaviour in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) [19].
1.2 Blockchain as a Potential Solution
In this chapter, we briefly explain the concept of a blockchain-enabled IoV
to overcome the discussed challenges. A blockchain is basically a peer-to-peer
electronic cash system in which transaction data is maintained in a ledger as
immutable timestamped blocks and each block is linked to the previous block with
the help of a cryptographic hash [20]. To complete a transaction in a blockchain, a
client needs to first submit a proposal which is then verified by a network of peers
using an algorithm known as consensus. If a proposal is verified, it is stored in
the blockchain as a unique record. A blockchain is encrypted, decentralised, secure
and immutable. Therefore, it is able to solve issues related to security and privacy,
and has the potential to contribute towards IoT applications [21, 22]. Our chapter
shows how blockchain can be used to implement distributed, secure and privacy-
preserving communications in IoV. The goal is to introduce a secure, lightweight
and decentralised peer-to-peer vehicular network in which untrusted vehicles can
interact with each other in a verifiable manner. The key challenge in IoV is ensuring
the authenticity of message in a decentralised manner. It is interesting to point out
that the feature of consensus in blockchain can be applied to resolve this challenge.
Blockchain provides robustness against dissemination of false messages as long
as the honest vehicles collectively possess more controlling power than malicious
vehicles. The basic idea of blockchain implementation for security and privacy in
IoV is shown in Fig. 1. A blockchain-enabled IoV would be able to record messages

into an ongoing chain along the broadcast route, forming a ledger that cannot be
changed. All vehicles can collectively act as peers to authenticate messages and
select a relay node to forward message and manage the history of publicly available
previous record of messages. To discourage accidents, ensure smooth traffic and
promote positive cooperation, the vehicles causing accident can compensate by
paying reward to the vehicles participating in message dissemination.
2 Fundamentals of Blockchain
This section briefly describes the fundamentals of blockchain, including its struc-
ture, types, basic consensus algorithms and their suitability with respect to IoV.
2.1 Structure of Blockchain
As shown in Fig. 2, a blockchain is used to store transactions in a sequence of blocks
chained together by including a cryptographic link to the previous block known as
hash [23]. In a conventional blockchain, whenever a new transaction is made, it is
announced across the network. Nodes are able to verify a transaction and record
the verified transaction into a block containing an encrypted hash of previous block,
thereby making it cryptographically secure. Nodes which append a block to the
blockchain after verification and broadcast it in the network are known as miners.
Miners have to go through a mutual agreement called consensus algorithm to create
a block which makes it fraud-proof [24]. All nodes in a network update their copy of
blockchain regularly in order to ensure consistency in the entire distributed ledger
[25].
A typical blockchain is permissionless and open to public where anyone in a
network can make entry into the ledger. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the examples
of permissionless blockchain [23]. On the other hand, Hyperledger family offers
various versions of permissioned blockchain, where specific roles and access

limitation can be associated to certain nodes. Considering different roles in ITS,
such as automotive manufacturers, government and transportation authorities, a
permissioned blockchain is considered to be appropriate for vehicular applications
[26].
2.2 Consensus Algorithm
The core of a blockchain mechanism is consensus algorithm. It is an agreement
to validate a transaction and unanimously take a decision. The Bitcoin uses an
incentive based Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus for block-mining. In PoW, the
nodes have to solve an extremely difficult puzzle to become a miner, which requires
high computational power and results in large propagation delay. However, a
difficult cryptographic puzzle which cannot be solved and tampered easily makes
the blockchain highly secure. An alternative of PoW is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [27].
New versions of Ethereum are PoS-based [28]. PoS replaces the mining operation
of PoW with a miner selection on the basis of highest amount of stakes or virtual
currency owned, which makes it unfair for members possessing smaller stakes [29].
A permissioned blockchain usually adopts voting based Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerant (PBFT) algorithm for achieving consensus among a group of nodes in a
permissioned environment [30]. PBFT consists of three stages as shown in Fig. 3.
In first stage, a client sends a transaction proposal to validating peers. In second
stage, a transaction proposal is validated by receiving votes from at least a certain
minimum number of peers. In third stage, the block is committed to the blockchain.
The minimum number of votes required to validate a transaction proposal is usually
specified in a smart contract of a blockchain. A novel PBFT based voting algorithm
known as Yet Another Consensus (YAC) is implemented in Hyperledger Iroha
blockchain platform. It tolerates f faulty nodes out of 2f +1 participants taking part
in consensus [31]. A comparison of basic blockchain technologies is summarised in
Table 1, which indicates that consensus algorithm of Hyperledger; PBFT is the most
promising algorithm for vehicular applications, as it overcomes the limitations of
PoW and PoS. However, PBFT does not scale well with large number of nodes, as
the number of messages broadcasted to validate a transaction proposal increases
with raising number of nodes. Nevertheless, with moving vehicles, the number
of nodes within a limited transmission range of a vehicle initiating a transaction

3 Related Work
In this section, the related work which utilises blockchain technology as a potential
solution to existing challenges in IoT and IoV applications is discussed with
referenced literature. The discussion is focussed on how blockchain can the existing
challenges of privacy and trust in IoT and IoV.
3.1 Privacy
The transactions in a blockchain are recorded with the use of cryptographic
public and private keypairs. The public key can also be changed for different
transactions. The anonymity in network is maintained by keeping the identity of
participants private. This features makes blockchain useful in many applications
which include confidentiality, for example, storing patients’ record and history
[32]. A permissioned blockchain solution to keep the privacy of identity and
location of electric vehicles during payment at charging stations was proposed in
[33]. Due to lack of scalability in permissioned blockchain’s consensus, public
blockchain for urban areas with large number of vehicles was also suggested in
[33]. It can be deduced that greater privacy can be achieved through permissioned
blockchain by trading off scalability. Apart from payment transactions, the privacy-
preserving feature of blockchain can also be used to ensure anonymous message
exchange. In [34], a blockchain-based incentive anonymous announcement network
was proposed, which used virtual credits, known as, CreditCoin as a reward for for-
warding the message. The transactions of CreditCoins were managed by blockchain,
whereas vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications were implemented separately.
Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy for Internet-of-Vehicles 129
The privacy of vehicles was maintained because their identities were encrypted
during communications. The message dissemination system was not completely
decentralised because it relied on RSUs or official public vehicles as servers which
undertake the work of consensus. In [35], the concept of blockchain managed by a
Certificate Authority was proposed, which assigned or revoked encrypted keys. It
provided a privacy-preserving solution because vehicles communicated with each
other using public key instead of revealing their original identities. For reputation
management, the vehicles needed to report to a centralised law enforcement agency
whenever they observed a malicious behaviour.
3.2 Trust and Reputation
In a blockchain network, nodes have to go through a consensus algorithm to verify
a transaction in a block. A consensus algorithm ensures trust in a network because
fake transactions cannot be verified by all nodes [36]. By use of blockchain in
IoV, a malicious vehicle cannot easily initiate a false message, because it has to
be propagated after validation. One way to judge the validity of a message is on
the basis of reputation of sender. This is why reputation management is one of the
subjects where blockchain research is rapidly progressing. Many researches have
employed reputation to reach consensus because PoW is not feasible to be used with
moving vehicles. A blockchain-based reputation management with the consensus
algorithm of PoS, where reputation was the stake of vehicles was proposed in [37].
The vehicles reported their reputation opinions of other vehicles to a nearby RSU. To
carry out consensus algorithms, the reputation values were downloaded from RSU
and a mining vehicle was elected on the basis of highest reputation. The vehicle
was considered malicious if its reputation value was below a certain threshold. A
similar approach was presented by Yang et al. [38] where RSUs stored reputation
of vehicles and maintained blockchain. To carry out consensus algorithm, mining
RSUs underwent a joint PoW and PoS algorithm where reputation was regarded
as a stake. It also considered Bayesian Inference for authentication of incidents
occurring on road. Both mechanisms relied upon RSUs for blockchain management.
Consensus processing by RSUs to store trust ratings of vehicles in a blockchain
was also proposed in [39]. Blockchain managed by RSUs was recommended in
[40] because of their higher storage capacity and processing power than vehicles.
However, the issues of short connection time between a RSU and a vehicle as well
as security attacks on RSUs which control blockchain are still not addressed in
existing literature. In [41], permissioned blockchain of reputation, not dependent
upon RSUs, was proposed and messages were authenticated on the basis of sender’s
reputation. It followed conventional PoW algorithm for miner election.

3.3 Decentralisation
The blockchain methodology is independent of third party to finalise transactions.
This feature makes it suitable for distributed networks, for example, supply chain
[42] and IoV [43]. In [44], authors discussed the strategies to design decentralised
applications using blockchain and pointed out that the challenges in developing
blockchain-based processes including selection of blockchain network type (per-
missioned or permissionless) and consensus model. Decentralisation in IoV by the
use of Ethereum blockchain was proposed by Leiding et al. [45]. It was suggested
to automatically punish negative behaviour of vehicles, for example, over-speeding
and ignoring traffic lights, by imposing fine or recalculate tax or insurance by the
use of smart contract without requiring a central authority. In [46], an incentive
mechanism which was used to motivate vehicles to forward messages was proposed.
Only the transactions of incentives were managed by blockchain in a decentralised
manner, whereas the relay node selection mechanism was employed separately.
To summarise, it can be stated that the existing literature contains proposed
incentive mechanisms for vehicles to participate in message dissemination using
blockchain or blockchain-enabled reputation management systems, usually depend-
ing upon a central authority or RSUs. However, a consolidated solution can
potentially be formulated by involving blockchain not only for transaction of
virtual currency but also for transaction of messages to implement completely
decentralised, private and trusted IoV communications.
4 Blockchain-Enabled IoV
In this section, the blockchain-enabled solution for message dissemination among
connected vehicles, along with reputation management and incentive distribution
mechanism [47] is explained. The key notations used in this chapter are defined in
Table 2. The proposed solution consists of the following components:
1. Central Authority (CA) Before joining the blockchain network, a vehicle needs
to be registered with the CA. It assigns a wallet address and a pair of public
and private keys to the vehicle for communications and records its original
identity. The key pair is used for anonymous transmissions. The role of CA is to
grant vehicles an access to a permissioned blockchain system. CA monitors the
network and is also in-charge of setting the rules in the system, for example, the
minimum amount of balance in a credit wallet and a vehicle’s initial reputation
value.
2. Originator (ORG) An ORG is the vehicle which is involved in an incident and
originates a transaction proposal.
3. Transaction Proposal A transaction proposal contains an unendorsed mes-
sage sent by ORG including details about the incident, for example, its location

and time. The voting based blockchain system confirms the authenticity of a
transaction proposal through endorsements.
4. Endorsement An endorsement is a vote confirming that a transaction
proposal is authentic. A minimum number of endorsements, Nmin
END , is
required to consider a transaction proposal as an endorsed message.
5. Endorsers at hop i, (END(i)) At each hop i, END(i) is a set of vehicle j
which vote for a suitable relay node. When i = 0, END(i) are vehicles adjacent
to ORG and they also endorse a transaction proposal, if they have witnessed
the incident itself or made confirmation through camera equipped device or any
other service as described in [26].
132 F. Ayaz et al.
6. Relay node at hop i, (RLY(i)) It is the vehicle which further disseminates an
endorsed message. It is mutually selected by the voting of END(i). It is also one
of the END(i) and may vote for itself. It also acts as a miner by committing the
block to record transfer of virtual credits and reputation updates in the blockchain
and finalising the consensus algorithm at each hop i.
7. Credit Wallet Each vehicle possesses a credit wallet in which virtual credit is
stored.
8. Transmission Charge (T C) It is a fee deducted from a vehicle’s credit wallet
when it originates or endorses a transaction proposal or further disseminates
an endorsed message. This fee is deposited to CA. CA regulates T C according
to the incident recovery cost estimated at the location of incident and time of
the day. The purpose of introducing T C is to demotivate vehicles to make a fake
transaction proposal or endorsement , as it is generated at the expense of their
virtual credit.
9. Call compensation (CC) As a compensation of causing an incident, CC is the
amount deducted from the credit wallet of ORG. It is inversely proportional to
its reputation. ORG with higher reputation can pay less CC. This is the reason
why vehicles are motivated to increase their reputation.
10. Reputation (Rj ) It is a reputation value of vehicle j . A vehicle is only eligible
to endorse a transaction proposal if its reputation value exceeds a certain
reputation threshold, RT , that is, jεEND(0) if Rj > RT .
4.1 Voting Based Consensus Algorithm
The consensus algorithm of proposed blockchain-enabled IoV follows the voting
mechanism of YAC [28] where ORG acts as a client and END(i) perform the
role of a peer and is illustrated in Fig. 4. When an incident occurs, ORG originates
a transaction proposal. Upon receiving a transaction proposal, a vehicle j
that can confirm the incident becomes an endorser, i.e. jεEND(0), broadcasts
its cryptographically encrypted signature as a part of endorsement phase and
votes for a suitable RLY(0). The selection criteria of RLY(i) are described later
in this section. If Nmin
END endorsements are obtained within the time limit, tmax
END ,
the transaction proposal is considered to be an endorsed message. In order to
simplify our assumption, we only consider a static case in which Nmin
END is fixed.
An adaptive Nmin
END corresponding to real traffic conditions is out of the scope of
this paper, but can be partially solved by using the traffic density estimation method
[48]. When a transaction proposal is classified as an endorsed message, RLY(0)
will further disseminate it in its transmission range and generate a block. The
block generation details are described later in this section. Voting based selection
of RLY(i) for i > 0 is continued until reaching a maximum number of hops,
that is, i > Nmax
HOP or the endorsed message has been disseminated until a time
limit, dmax . It is noted that END(i) need to send endorsements for a transaction
Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy for Internet-of-Vehicles 133
Fig. 4 Proposed voting based consensus algorithm
proposal only when i = 0. At i > 0, END(i) only take part in consensus of
RLY(i) selection, because they already receive an endorsed message instead of a
transaction proposal.
4.2 Relay Selection Mechanism
In our proposed solution, END(i) vote for the most appropriate RLY(i) which can
further disseminate an endorsed message to a wider area. In this work, we assume
that each vehicle j is sharing its location coordinates, channel quality parameter
CQj , collision probability CPj , receiving antenna gain Gr
j , transmitting antenna
gain Gt
j , maximum transmitting power T Pj and transmission range T Rj during
their regular beacon message exchange. The parameters of RLY(i) are stored in the
blockchain and are regularly audited by CA to detect and investigate potential fraud
if a vehicle cheats by sending fake parameters to achieve highest Qj . jεEND(i)
134 F. Ayaz et al.
computes the quality factor Qj and determines its own choice of RLY(i) with the
highest Qj , that is,
RLY(i) = index(max(QEND(i))), (1)
and,1
Qj = α1dfj + α2CQj(1 − CPj ) + RSSMj , (2)
where jεEND(i), dfj is the distance factor of vehicle j , RSSMj is the received

, (5)
where tocc
j is the accumulated time at which the channel was occupied or busy
when vehicle j was trying to transmit and tW is a fixed time window. The Received

locations of vehicle j and j ′, where j ′εEND(i), as

The range of the antennas is assumed as the circular area of radius T Rj . From [52],
it shows that the average distance between two random mobile nodes in a circular
region of radius T Rj is 0.9054T Rj . The purpose of using RSST as a threshold
parameter is to estimate the reliability of connection with vehicle j . If RSSj ≥
RSST , the connection can successfully be maintained for a certain time period.
Otherwise, the connectivity may be lost before completing a voting consensus [53].

4.3 Incentive Distribution Mechanism
The incentive distribution of proposed solution is managed by the blockchain. The
proposed voting based blockchain is used to store parameters related to Q(RLY(i)),
transactions related to distribution of CC and updated reputation of vehicles. As
shown in Fig. 5, the blocks are committed by RLY(i) at each hop. Every vehicle
in permissioned network possesses the blockchain. Addition of block is announced
by RLY(i) to vehicles in its transmission range. Each vehicle is responsible for
updating its blockchain and coordinating it with CA regularly.
CC is used as a monetary incentive in the proposed approach. It is divided into
two parts with ratio w1 : w2, where w1 and w2 are corresponding weights to
divide the share of CC among END(0) and RLY(i), RLY(i+1),. . . ,RLY(Nmax
HOP )
respectively and w1 + w2 = 1. The profit, Pj of a vehicle j is given as

The transactions into credit wallets of END(i) are committed as a block by RLY(i)
only when i = 0 and transactions into credit wallets of RLY(i), RLY(i + 1),. . . ,
RLY(Nmax
HOP ) are committed as a block at last hop by RLY(Nmax
HOP + 1). If Nmin
END
endorsements are not obtained for a transaction proposal until tmax
END , it is
considered as fake and CC is transferred to CA as a penalty to ORG. The penalty
136 F. Ayaz et al.
Fig. 5 Flowchart of blockchain-enabled message dissemination in IoV
is recorded as a transaction in the blockchain by RLY(i) which is selected by
ORG itself while originating a transaction proposal. No share of CC is paid
to END(0) which endorsed a fake transaction proposal.
Reputation is affected by the behaviour of vehicle. Honest behaviour of END(i)
and RLY(i) is recognised as the successful action performed during message
dissemination. Malicious behaviour refers to a fake transaction proposal initiated
by ORG or endorsed by END(i) and selfish RLY(i) without disseminating
an endorsed message. Reputation updates are committed as transactions in the
blockchain by RLY(i) at each hop i. REND(i) are updated at ith hop and RRLY(i)
is updated at (i + 1)th hop. If RLY(i) itself behaves maliciously, its reputation
deduction is processed in the blockchain by CA after being reported by END(i). If
a vehicle j behaves honestly, its reputation is updated with
Rj = Rj + β, (10)
where β is the reputation reward. If it behaves maliciously, its reputation is updated
with
Rj = Rj − γ, (11)
where γ is the reputation penalty. The credit and reputation management follows an
economic model defined in Table 3.

Game Theory Analysis
We apply game theory to analyse the performance of our incentive distribution
mechanism against collusion of RLY(i), RLY(i + 1),. . . ,RLY(n), where n is
equivalent to the number of colluding relay nodes. We find the best action for
players and associated conditions so as to provide positive utility to honest players.
By setting up a suitable condition, we can guarantee the security of our solution
against colluding behaviour of relay nodes. The model of our blockchain-enabled
message dissemination game is described as follows
• Players This game has Nmin
END number of END(0) and one RLY(i) at each hop
i. The number of hops is NHOP .
• Actions At hop i = 0, jεEND(0) has three possible actions, honest (H),
malicious (M) and selfish (S). If it votes for a true message, it is honest. If it
votes for a false message, it is malicious. If it does not cooperate, it is selfish. At
each hop i, RLY(i) has two possible actions: honest (H) and selfish (S). If it
forwards the message and commits block, it is honest. If it does not cooperate, it

We present the following definitions for the security analysis of our incentive
distribution mechanism.
Definition 1 The best response action for a player is such that it brings the
maximum expected utility to itself, regardless of the actions of all other players.
Definition 2 The incentive distribution mechanism is RLY(i) collusion resistant
if RLY(i) and any group of its colluding neighbours cannot increase the expected
sum of their utilities by using any action other than the one in which everybody
plays honestly.
The following proposition and theorem are also presented here.
138 F. Ayaz et al.
Proposition 1 In blockchain-enabled message dissemination game, playing honest
is the best response action of all players if 0 ≤ T C ≤ Pj .
Proof According to (12), if T C < 0, the utility of player j , for jεEND(i) would
be positive if it plays maliciously. On the other hand, if T C ≥ Pj , the utility of
player j would be negative if it plays honestly. In either of these cases, the best
response action of players would be to play maliciously or selfishly. Therefore T C
must be set such that the action results in positive Uj or profit gain in credit wallets
of all players only if they play honestly. ��
Theorem 1 The incentive distribution mechanism is resistant against collusion of
RLY(i), RLY(i + 1),. . . ,RLY(n) if T C ≥ 0.
Proof Lets consider the case with one conspired RLY(i). Suppose CG =
{RLY(i), RLY(i + 1)} is a collusion group. CG conspires to form a bogus path
with an additional hop, i.e., ORG → RLY(i) → RLY(i + 1) instead of the most
appropriate path, i.e. ORG → RLY ′(i + 1). Let p be the probability with which
RLY(i) encounters, where p ε [0, 1]. Therefore, p2 is the probability with which it
encounters both ORG and RLY(i + 1). The expected utility sum of CG, E(UCG)
is
E(UCG) = p2(URLY(i) + URLY(i+1)) + (1 − p2)(URLY ′(i+1)), (13)
or,
E(UCG) = p2(PRLY(i) − T C + PRLY(i+1) − T C)
+ (1 − p2)(PRLY ′(i+1) − T C). (14)
Since NHOP = 2 for collusion case and NHOP ′ = 1 for non-collusion, E(UCG
becomes
E(UCG) = p2
(w2CC
2
+ w2CC
2
− 2T C
)
+ (1 − p2)(w2CC − T C), (15)
or,
E(UCG) = w2CC − T C − p2T C. (16)
To avoid collusion of relay nodes, we want E(UCG) ≤ URLY ′(i+1), that is,
w2CC − T C − p2T C ≤ w2CC − T C. (17)
It follows that
− p2T C ≤ 0, (18)
Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy for Internet-of-Vehicles 139
or,
p2T C ≥ 0. (19)
Similarly, by generalising cases when n > 2, we can derive the collusion resistant
condition, that is, pnT C ≥ 0. Hence, for any pε[0, 1], we can prove that the
incentive distribution mechanism is relay node collusion resistant if T C ≥ 0. ��
4.4 Annual Road Tax
The blockchain-enabled IoV can also be used to calculate road tax. It can be
annually calculated on the basis of remaining balance of each vehicle’s credit
wallet at the end of the year. The motivation behind this approach is due to the
amount in a credit wallet reflecting a vehicle’s behaviour. A vehicle which is
involved in less number of incidents would have spent less credit in originating
transactionproposals, leaving higher balance remaining in its credit wallet which
can be redeemed into road tax. Furthermore, the vehicles which are near to the
incident’s location would be motivated to take part in message dissemination and
earn the credit as a compensation of being affected by the incident.
5 Simulation Results and Discussion
In this section, the performance of our blockchain-enabled solution is discussed
on the basis of results obtained through extensive simulations using OMNeT++
integrated with SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) which can be seen in Fig. 6.

5.1 Simulation Setup
The simulation parameters in Table 4 are set so that Proposition 1 holds true
regardless of the value of CC which is inversely proportional to RORG. In our
simulations, we have arbitrarily set CC = 10/RORG. Higher RORG leads to
lower amount of CC, thereby resulting in less profit for END(0) and RLY(i),
RLY(i + 1),. . . ,RLY(Nmax
HOP ). However, it must be ensured that the message
dissemination solution results in profit gain in credit wallets of all, despite of
deduction of T C. As shown in Fig. 7, w1 > 0.3 and w2 > 0.6 would always result
in positive profit, Pj , irrespective of the value RORG. Therefore, in order to ensure
profit gain, we have set w1 = 0.35 and w2 = 0.65 in simulation. For efficient
RLY(i) selection, α1 and α2 have to be optimised. Figure 8 shows the percentage
of vehicles which received the message within a specified period of time, tmax , with
respect to α1 and α2 under different traffic densities. It shows that the selection of α1
and α2 depends upon the number of vehicles and affects RLY(i) selection defined
in (2). Thus in our simulation, we choose α1 and α2 such that they achieve the
maximum reception rate.
5.2 Latency
Figure 9 shows average time consumption per hop over 100 simulation runs. As a
comparison, reputation based blockchain [37, 41], only allowed vehicles with repu-
tation above a certain threshold to disseminate messages. CreditCoin was witnesses
based blockchain, in which ORG required a threshold number of witnesses to vote
for authentication of a transaction proposal [34] and then allowed only authentic
transaction proposals to be forwarded as messages. The latency was increased in
Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy for Internet-of-Vehicles 141
Fig. 7 Pj with respect to RORG, w1 and w2. (a) Pj for jεEND(i). (b) Pj for j = RLY(i)
this approach because it relied on ORG to wait for the witnesses before generating
the actual announcement packet. On the contrary, in our approach, the integrated
authentication and relaying is implemented in a distributed manner and therefore,
waiting time of ORG to rebroadcast after authentication is eliminated, which saves
an average of 56 ms (or 11%) of time consumed in each consensus. Moreover, in
CreditCoin, transactions in blockchain were processed by RSU, whereas in our
solution, this task is performed by RLY(i). Figure 9 also shows that reputation
based method takes the least time to complete one hop as it does not involve
waiting time for endorsements. The only time it consumes is to access blockchain
to find reputation of ORG. However, average time increases with raising number of
vehicles. This is because when there is a large number of vehicles registered in a
blockchain network, it takes more time to access and find reputation of a vehicle.
In proposed approach and CreditCoin, average time decreases with raising number
of vehicles. This is because Nmin
END endorsements are gathered in less time in heavy

traffic conditions. Therefore, time difference between reputation and voting based
approaches becomes negligible with large number of vehicles in a network. With
50 vehicles, our solution consumes 522 ms for completing one consensus process.
Given the average speed of vehicle is 40 km/h, it only incurs a moving distance
of approximately 5 m, which can be easily mitigated within 300 m coverage of
typical IEEE 802.11p radio [54]. Therefore, the proposed solution can be practically
applied and vehicles are not likely to lose connectivity during a consensus process.
The worst case scenario is presented in Fig. 10, where low density of vehicles, i.e.
50 and 100, at speeds beyond 100 and 110 km/h, respectively, cannot successfully
complete a consensus algorithm within the time limit of 600 ms, which is practically
suitable for threshold based authentication methods in VANETs [55]. However, such
high speeds are not likely to be attained in an area affected by an incident or traffic
jam. Overall, it shows that the proposed approach is suitable for vehicular networks,
particularly for high density traffic with lower speed.

5.3 Success Rate
Figure 11 shows number of messages disseminated successfully in presence of low-
reputed vehicles. In our simulation, we have considered low-reputed vehicles as
those vehicles whose reputation fall below RT due to their malicious behaviour.
The reputation based blockchain approaches [37, 41] authenticated a message on
the basis of reputation of ORG. They did not allow a low-reputed vehicle to
originate a transaction proposal in order to prevent dissemination of potentially
false messages. This is how they discouraged vehicles with low reputation to
contribute actively in blockchain extension and ultimately preventing some valid
transaction proposals to be disseminated. Our approach authenticates transaction
proposals through voting based consensus algorithm. Therefore, a low-reputed
vehicle can also originate a transaction proposal. The trust among vehicles is
144 F. Ayaz et al.
still maintained because a message cannot be further disseminated without getting
Nmin
END endorsements for a transaction proposal. The proposed consensus algorithm
results in dissemination of greater number of messages despite the presence of
higher percentage of low-reputed vehicles in a network, by equally promoting all
vehicles to contribute in blockchain extension even if they have low reputation
values. Our proposed approach disseminates on an average 17% more authenticated
messages as compared to reputation based blockchain approach in presence of low-
reputed vehicles.
5.4 Complexity
To support a completely decentralised message dissemination solution, each vehicle
in the reputation based blockchain has the whole copy of blockchain in order to find
reputation of any vehicle whenever needed. Therefore, the storage complexity of
reputation based blockchain is O(B), where B is the total number of blocks in a
blockchain [56]. On the other hand, our proposed solution does not require each
vehicle to store the whole copy of blockchain for RLY(i) selection and message
dissemination. To add a block in blockchain, the vehicle needs only the address of
previous block and therefore its storage complexity is O(1). However, all vehicles
are required to update and synchronise their last block responsibly in order to avoid
forks and discrepancies.
In terms of communication, the conventional PBFT requires at least Nmin
END
signatures both during endorsement and committing a block, as shown in Fig. 12a.
Therefore, PBFT results in an overall communication complexity of O((Nmin
END)2)
[57], whereas our proposed solution, shown in Fig. 12b, requires Nmin
END signatures
only during endorsement and hence results in communication complexity of
O(Nmin
END).
6 Conclusion
This chapter presents the concept of implementing blockchain technology for secure
and private communications in IoV. Various blockchain types and their consensus
algorithms are compared on the basis of their suitability in vehicular applications.
The advantages of using blockchain for enhancing security and privacy of IoT and
IoV are also discussed.
This chapter further proposes a voting based consensus algorithm incentivising
vehicles through credit and reputation rewards for message dissemination in emer-
gency situations. For efficient message dissemination, relay selection is made a part
of consensus. The proposed solution is analysed by game theory and is proved to
be secure against collusion of relay nodes. Further evaluation is conducted through
simulations and results show that it saves on an average of 11% time consumption

validation method. Moreover, it improves successful dissemination of authenticated
messages by 17% as compared to reputation based blockchain. As a trade-off, it
requires more time to generate block. However, the latency difference is negligible
with increasing number of vehicles. The complexity of proposed solution is also less
than reputation based consensus and conventional PBFT based consensus algorithm
in terms of storage and communication respectively. However, PBFT is less secure
as compared to PoW. The design of future blockchain models for IoV should
include improved security, reduced latency and complete independence from central
authorities.
