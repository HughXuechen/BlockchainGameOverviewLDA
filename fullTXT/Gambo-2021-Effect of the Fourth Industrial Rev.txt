Abstract: Poor management practices of road transport assets posed a challenge to the 
sustainable development of the transport system in developing countries like Nigeria. Studies 
in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, 
few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth Industrial Revolution (4.0IR) on the road 
transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing 
the effect of the 4.0IR towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. 
Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road 
construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. 
Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 
7.0 partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) software algorithm. The 
software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling 
or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The 
study concluded that the 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management 
practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management 
of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to the 4.0IR technologies resulting in 
transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The 
study identified the 4.0IR drivers to include robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, 
Internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 
three-dimensional (3D) printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer (the drone 
hangs a 3D printing nozzle that has fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube 
connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a 
promised printing accuracy of 0.1 mm) and digital engineering. This study emanated from 
the government reports and past studies in the area of road transport asset management 
practice which the study investigated the major causes of poor practices and assessed the 
effect of the 4.0IR on the practice.

INTRODUCTION
Road transportation infrastructure assets are not only expensive to construct but 
also costly to manage, to satisfactorily meet public anticipation. Management of 
road asset infrastructure facilities is challenging particularly in developing countries 
because of the low level of industrialisation. An industrial revolution provides 
reasonable ways of managing existing assets in a way that provides maximum

benefit to the public taking into consideration limited financial resources (Estache 
and De Rus, 2000). This study reviewed the road transport asset management 
system from the perspective of the industrial revolution. Fourth Industrial Revolution 
(4.0IR) is positioned on the Internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence  
(Li, Hou and Wu, 2017). The industrial revolution was built upon the previous 
industrial revolutions and uses digital revolution that has been occurring since the 
middle of the last century which is characterised by a fusion of technologies that is 
clouding the lines between the physical and digital spheres, this enables industrial 
organisations to rapidly automate and digitalise traditional business processes of 
road transport management; this enables the creation and maintenance of more 
intelligent products and services and ultimately transforms the global economy 
(Caruso, 2018). 4.0IR drivers like the Internet of things technologies are at the core of 
the 4.0IR transition, enabling the connected solutions that make the 4.0IR possible 
and reap the full benefit, road transport organisations deployed single-point 
Internet of things solutions and also take a comprehensive, strategic approach to 
reap the benefits of managing road facilities through the 4.0IR (Park, 2016).
Internet of things enables the extraction of big data from the road transport 
data build-up and eases road transport managers to collect a large volume of data 
with regards to the management of road networks (Park, 2016). It is quite important 
to be tactical with the data for decision making. Generally, road transport asset 
management is a systematic process of maintaining, upgrading and operating 
assets, combining engineering principles with sound business practice and 
economic rationale and providing tools to facilitate a more organised and flexible 
approach to making the decisions necessary to achieve the public's expectations 
(Stăncioiu, 2017). Unfortunately, poor management practice of road transport assets 
is one of the major factors influencing the efficient and effective road transport 
management in developing countries like Nigeria and hence affect the economic 
development of the country, leaving the country with a high rate of poor road 
networks which results into high traffic accidents. NBS (Nigeria Bureau of Statistics) 
(2018) reported that in every four hours, no fewer than two lives are lost on Nigerian 
roads and annually about 20,000 of the 11.654 million are involved in accidents. This 
is as a result of poor management practice culture for road transport asset in the 
country which reflects poor road networks, with a large number of potholes, over 
speeding, etc. The road management practice culture comprises of predictive 
and preventive cultures. Predictive management is a technique designed to 
determine the condition of a road network and estimate when maintenance 
should be carry-out. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-
based preventive and corrective management maintenance because tasks are 
performed only when warranted (Stăncioiu, 2017). Predictive management relies 
on data to determine road networks' likelihood of failure before it occurs. This allows 
asset managers to move from a road repair and replace model to a predict and 
fix management model using predictive analysis which relies on data, statistics, 
Internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence and modelling are used 
to make predictions about future outcomes (Liao et al., 2018). 
Studies in the past like that of Piryonesi and El-Diraby (2020) focused on 
the understanding of the causes of deterioration of roads which is an important 
part of road asset management and uses the long-term pavement performance 
(LTPP) data and machine learning algorithms to predict the deterioration in the 
pavement condition index (PCI). The results of the study indicated that dividing 
data into different climatic zones can change the relative importance of attributes

and the overall accuracy of the models. Increasing the prediction span reduces 
accuracy while reducing the number of prediction classes (levels of deterioration) 
increases accuracy. Similarly, Gunarathna and Hassan (2016) developed the road 
asset management sustainability assessment tool (RAMSAT) which expands the 
classification of transport asset beyond physical (tangible) to intangible (digital) 
assets. The study harmonised sustainability dimensions such as environmental, 
social, economic, corporate, financial and technological.
In a different study, Meyer, Amekudzi and O'Har (2010) described that the 
impacts of climate change on transportation infrastructure are becoming concerns 
to many transportation agencies. The article developed an asset management 
system that can be used as a decision-making framework for incorporating such 
concerns into a transportation agency's management approach. So also, Switzer 
and McNeil (2004) stated that the interest in road transport asset management 
among public sector organisations has grown over the past decade, the article 
synthesises the research initiatives in transport asset management into policy 
goals and objectives and performance measures, planning and programming, 
programme delivery, and systems monitoring and performance results. However, 
these studies attempted to improve road transport asset management through 
sustainability or relating the practice with the effect of climate change and or 
providing a road map for transport asset management. The articles failed to look 
into the core causes of the poor practice of road transport asset management 
and relate the practice with the opportunities provided by the 4.0IR digitalisation 
process. This would enhance good road transport asset management practices 
in developing countries and consequently improves on the management of 
transport assets that would ease transport and communication, safety, efficiency 
and effectiveness of management process and also enhances the delivery of the 
assets and boost the economy of the nation. 
The 4.0IR could be viewed from two angles: physical and digitalisation of 
assets management practice through the use of digitalisation allows managers to 
build a new virtual world from which we can steer the physical world (Liao et al., 
2018). The 4.0IR is characterised by the merger of digitalisation and automation 
to make the machines intelligent, interactive and easy to use (Xu, David and Kim, 
2018). These new technologies provide a huge impact on road transport asset 
management practice (Syam and Sharma, 2018). Digital technologies are already 
making the industry's operations more efficient. Advanced digital technologies, 
such as the Internet of things, automation, analytics and artificial intelligence, 
would take core operational functions of asset management, to the next level and 
will augment workforce capabilities (Petrillo et al., 2018). 
Therefore, this study would evaluate the effect of the 4.0IR on road transport 
asset management practice in Nigeria through assessing the effect of the 4.0IR 
on the road transport asset management practice and modelling the relationship 
between the 4.0IR drivers and asset management practice in Nigeria. The study set 
out the following research objectives:
1. To assess the effect of the 4.0IR drivers on road transport asset management 
practice in Nigeria.
2. To model the relationship between the 4.0IR drivers and road transport 
asset management practice in Nigeria.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Road Transport Asset Management Practices
There is no single method for implementing road transportation asset management 
practice. Transportation agencies differ in terms of their needs and resources 
and the complexity of their systems (Switzer and McNeil, 2004). Typically, the first 
step toward implementation involves some realisation that a need for innovation 
change exists. However, innovation does not happen until people within the asset 
management practice agency, particularly managers, see the reason for the 
change (Piyatrapoomi, Kumar and Setunge, 2004). Taking the first step is typically 
difficult because it involves figuring out what needs to be done. The road transport 
asset management agencies presently have no common process of implementing 
the management practice, rather use a traditional process that outfit the unique 
circumstances (Schraven, Hartmann and Dewulf, 2011). Examples are documented 
in the reports of recent domestic and international scanning programmes that 
reviewed transportation asset management practices in agencies in Canada, 
England, Australia and New Zealand. For the United States, more detailed 
experiences of states and local highway agencies with the implementation 
of asset management programmes appear in a series of case studies reported 
Federal Highways Authorities (FHWA's Offices) of Asset Management (Beauvais 
et al., 2003). The following are some real-life examples from local governments, 
State Department of Transports (DOTs) and international organisations of their 
experiences in developing and implementing transportation asset management 
programmes.
Beauvais et al. (2003) stated that in developed countries like the United 
States, local governments and municipalities owned more than 75% of the nation's 
nearly 4 billion miles of roadways and over half of its nearly 600,000 bridges. Also, 
local governments typically have fewer independent systems for managing assets 
than state DOTs, they often have a much broader view of infrastructure assets and 
the goals that can be achieved through effective management of those assets 
(Gunarathna and Hassan, 2016). As a result, these smaller agencies may also 
have a greater variety of criteria and standards for judging the performance of 
their assets. Besides, local government agencies depend on a variety of funding 
sources to support the development and management of transportation assets 
and typically have few resources to invest in asset management programmes 
(Gunarathna and Hassan, 2016). Because of the large number of local government 
agencies in the country and the variation in the responsibilities and resources of 
each agency, the approaches they take to infrastructure asset management 
vary greatly. Gunarathna and Hassan (2016) described that asset management 
practice systems generally include inventory information for the asset and condition 
measures and values of the condition of the asset, but Lim, Porras-Alvarado and 
Zhang (2019) viewed performance prediction capability as the most important 
management practice for road transport. Martin, Davey and Clarke (2019) argued 
that data integrity enhances data accessibility and provide data compatibility 
improves management practice for road transport assets and also components in 
life-cycle cost analyses enable the removal of out-dated systems and unproductive 
assets. This considers both system and project optimisation report useful information 
periodically, ideally in real-time, facilitate iterative analysis processes that can be 
performed regularly (Burns, Hope and Roorda, 1999).

Jraiw (2003) assessed the urban road transport management practice in 
Asia's developing countries with a focus on road safety and efficiency strategy. 
The article described that most of the world's population and economic growth 
is occurring in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The developing 
countries experienced most of the world's urban growth. Motor vehicles are growing 
at two to three times the population rate and the road management practice 
and safety are major concerns. As a consequence, countries face alarming 
urban road transport management challenges. The major issue is that the supply 
of road transport services has not matched the increased demand, because of 
insufficient infrastructure development. Similarly, the issue of road management 
practice approaches in China, Brazil and the Slovak Republic have been slightly 
efficient in creating expressway road networks. However, therefore there is the 
need by the China, Brazil and the Slovak governments to support the adoption 
of the 4.0IR drivers for the management of road transport to reach the optimum 
expressway densities for road networks Marcelino, Antunes and Fortunato (2019). In 
Nigeria, road transport is the most common mode of transportation and accounts 
for about 90% of the movement of goods and services. Most of the federal roads 
in Nigeria were procured decades ago by the traditional contracting system.  
A good number of the road-networks in many Nigerian cities are unpaved, poorly 
maintained, overused and impassable, thereby cutting off many rural areas from 
larger settlements during the rainy season, which has a corresponding negative 
impact on the economy due to poor management practice (Adetola and 
Goulding, 2016). 
Industrial Revolution and Road Transport Asset Management Practices
The brink of a technological revolution which fundamentally alters the way managers 
practice asset management and also improve on the transformations between 
virtual to physical realities (Bloem et al., 2014). With this scale, scope and complexity, 
the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. This 
development integrated and comprehensively involving all stakeholders of the 
global polity, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society 
(Bloem et al., 2014). Studies contrast that the 4.0IR to the first industrial revolution 
that used water and steam to mechanise production, the second that used 
electric power to create mass production and the third that that used electronics 
and information technology to automate production (Labor, 1990). Then the 4.0IR 
which is the building on the third and characterised by a fusion of technologies and 
rapid change in technology evolution, has the potential to raise global income 
levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world (Naudé, 
2017). Naudé (2017) stated that to date, those who have gained the most from it 
have been consumers able to afford and access the digital world.
These changes are evident in transportation asset management practices. 
Nangoy et al. (2020) noted that the fast-moving trends are influencing urban mobility 
systems around the world and the shared mobility, in the form of ride-sharing services, 
has grown rapidly over the past few years and now competes with traditional car-
sharing and car-pooling providers, public transit and private vehicle ownership. 
Autonomous driving technology promises to improve or resolve road safety 
concerns, reduce the transportation facility maintenance cost, turn a percentage 
of all of the driving time into free time and expand access to mobility (Kalitanyi 
and Goldman, 2020; Gambo, Said and Ismail, 2016a). Vehicle connectedness and

the spread of Internet of things applications into vehicles and infrastructure would 
generate data with various uses including real-time trip planning and guidance for 
private vehicle and transit users (Manesh et al., 2020). Electric vehicles continue to 
gain in cost competitiveness with conventional vehicles, and if the cost of renewable 
power generation continues to fall, intermittent distributed generation produces an 
increasing share of the world's electricity, possibly make energy cheaper, cleaner 
and more reliable. Public transit is being fitted with autonomous features that may 
reduce operating costs and the presence of shared vehicle fleets can make transit 
more convenient and accessible (Manesh et al., 2020).
Road transport asset infrastructure maintenance practice upgrades the 
choices that influence a modal split across private vehicles, shared transit, public 
transit and cycling. Sutherland (2020) indicated that in 50 metropolitan areas 
around the world, home to 500 million people, integrated mobility systems could 
produce benefits, such as improved safety and reduced pollution, worth up to 
USD600 billion. They also note that the transition to integrated mobility play out 
differently and produce different results from one city to the next because each city 
is unique. The pace and extent of change depending on various factors including 
local governance capabilities, population density, household income, public 
investment, the state of the road and public-transit infrastructure, and pollution 
and congestion levels (Sutherland, 2020). One can anticipate increasing levels 
of automation and connectedness as a future mobility option. Thus, while road 
transportation asset valuation has been based largely on the physical condition 
to date, it is easy to understand the importance of expanding this paradigm to 
include other performance factors, such as safety, mobility and resilience, to 
develop a superior understanding of the trade-offs among plausible alternatives 
and scenarios (Mazzi, 2020). Thus, the valuation of smart assets, including information 
and communication technologies, enabled infrastructure and connected 
and automated vehicles should witness an expansion of the factors used in the  
valuation approach.
A parallel on-going trend in the 4.0IR is growth in investment shares in 
intangible assets, particularly in developed economies (Mazzi, 2020). Intangible 
investment has become increasingly important, with new measurement methods 
showing how it exceeds tangible investment in some developed countries and 
has been growing for several decades, whereas tangible investment has steadily 
declined (Momotova et al., 2020). The investment share in intangibles continues 
to rise because of the changing balance of services and manufacturing in the 
economy, globalisation, increased liberalisation of markets, developments in 
information technology and management technologies, and the changing costs 
of services, which play a greater role in intangible investment (Momotova et al., 
2020). With the rise of the intangible economy, one can expect to derive more 
worth from road transport asset infrastructure valuation approaches that aim to 
include intangible value defensibly. Thus, transportation asset valuation should 
not only expand to include factors other than condition, but it should also aim to 
capture intangibles such as resilience, liveability and sustainability (Ng, 2020). 
Technological Drivers of the 4.0IR
The development of digital innovation technology is one of the fundamental 
technological drivers of the 4.0IR; the 4.0IR is driven by enduring breakthroughs 
in this area within the respective area as well as a great fusion with each

technological driver. Digital innovation is a process of making rapid change by 
using technology to enhance services, traditional models, products and processes 
through understanding end-user needs (Simmons, Palmer and Truong, 2013). 
The technological drivers for the 4.0IR mainly originate from the software field.  
Digital innovation technology is the fundamental driving force for the 4.0IR and 
nearly all the innovations and advances coming with the 4.0IR flow are made 
possible and enhanced through digital power (Peters, 2017). This technology 
cluster is making the whole world a digitally connected one. The digital innovations 
technology includes; the Internet of things, artificial intelligence and machine 
learning, big data and cloud computing, blockchain and other digital platforms 
(Peters, 2017). 
The evolution of the Internet of things has gone beyond Internet-connected 
appliances but it is seen as the integration of technologies like machine learning, 
embedded systems and wireless (Li, Hou and Wu, 2017). The Internet of things is 
pivotal to the inception and evolution of the 4.0IR. The sensors in networked 
physical connected devices collect data in real-time (Peters, 2017). This is very 
valuable to road transport management practice businesses and can help 
optimise the management practice through automation and management of vast 
road networks with ease and accuracy. Using advanced analytics, the use of big 
data in the management practice of road networks is transformed into meaningful 
information to meet business objectives (Li, Hou and Wu, 2017). Transport managers 
could have better means to organise, analyse and seek the real value of their 
big data for better business achievement. Cloud computing offers a flexible and 
affordable way to support road transport management business operations.  
This is achieved from remote working and backing up information to storing large 
data sets. Smart machines like expert systems, digital assistants and autonomous 
devices are changing transportation industry processes (Li, Hou and Wu, 2017). 
Advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence are changing 
transportation industry; the emerging technologies have an impact on employees 
and there is need to focus on how workers and machines can work together for 
better results (Li, Hou and Wu, 2017). Blockchain is a powerful methodology for 
tracking and transactions that will impact the industry commercial activities in a 
wide variety of ways. Three-dimensional (3D) printing drones are already impacting 
on the other sectors of the global economy such as buildings, agriculture,  
making dangerous jobs safer, providing a lifeline for remote populations, meeting 
refugee emergencies, and revolutionising how people and goods are transported 
(Morrar, Arman and Mousa, 2017). 
Physical Drivers of the 4.0IR
Physical innovation in the road transport management practice has visible 
achievements, rapid applications and broad prospects are physical known 
technology drivers of the 4.0IR since it has the most direct impacts on daily lives. 
Physical innovation refers to a new method or change made to an existing physical 
process for the management practice of road transport system (Jazdi, 2014). 
The physical innovation drivers for the management practice of road transport  
includes innovation process, creation of support team, psychological climate 
for new ideas and leverage diversity (Emmanouilidis and Komonen, 2013), but 
Gaetani et al. (2017) viewed that the building of a culture of innovation coupled 
with organisational culture enhance physical innovation process. Li, Hou and Wu 
Nuru Gambo and Innocent Musonda
26/PENERBIT UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA
(2017) argued that the physical environment and favourable economic climate 
coupled with good leadership strategy enhances physical innovation process. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This study explores literature to gain insights and ideas about the effects of the 
4.0IR on the road transport asset management practice in Nigeria as well as 
understand the variables and issues surrounding them. Subsequently, literature 
findings were used to adapt a structured questionnaire that was used to elicit 
information on the three study constructs: 4.0IR drivers, physical drivers and asset 
management practice. Thus, the study design is quantitative (McNabb, 2015). 
The study area is the road transport asset in the northern geopolitical zone of 
Nigeria. The zone comprised of 19 states and the administrative headquarters of 
Nigeria, Abuja. The zones occupy almost 70% of the total landmass of the country  
(744,249.08 sq. km) and home to slightly more than half (74.2 m) of Nigeria's 
population (170 million) (Gambo, Said and Ismail, 2016b; Gambo, Said and Inuwa, 
2017). 
The NBD (Nigerian Business Directory) (2019) was used to arrive at a 
population of 1,777 comprising of the public and private project and facility 
managers that are presently involved in the execution of road transport asset 
management in the northern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Afterwards, a sample 
size of 317 respondents was determined using Krejcie and Morgan (1970) rule 
of thumb. Subsequently, questionnaires were administered to the respondents 
through a proportionate random sampling technique. This technique was 
adopted because of the uneven distribution of the study population (unequal 
proportionate number of respondents in the 19 states of the study area). This had  
not influenced the outcome of the study because the proportionate random 
sampling method was used in the data collection, hence biases in the study were 
also avoided (Sekaran and Bougie, 2011). A total of 276 valid questionnaires were 
returned while 26 were rejected. Thus, not included in the analysis because of 
discrepancies in the responses and/or majority of the items in the questionnaire 
were left unattended or unanswered. The survey records approximately 67% of 
valid response rates. 
The primary research tool for this study was a self-administered questionnaire. 
The questionnaires were administered to the study respondents. Questions asked 
were closed and ended (Guthrie, 2010). Questions on the study objectives were 
captured by three constructs (i.e., latent variables) (as shown in Table 1): road 
transport asset management practice (ASSMGT) as the dependent variable 
while physical innovation factors (PHYINN) and digital innovation (DIGINN) are 
independent variables, respectively. The measurement items for construct ASSMGT 
were adapted from Burns, Hope and Roorda (1999), Switzer and McNeil (2004), 
Schraven, Hartmann and Dewulf (2011), Gunarathna and Hassan (2016), Lim, 
Porras-Alvarado and Zhang (2019) and Martin, Davey and Clarke (2019) while the 
construct PHYINN was adapted from the studies of Jazdi (2014), Emmanouilidis and 
Komonen (2013), Gaetani et al. (2017) and Li, Hou and Wu (2017). The construct 
DIGINN was adapted from the studies of Simmons, Palmer and Truong (2013), 
Peters (2017), Li, Hou and Wu (2017) and that of Morrar, Arman and Mousa (2017). 
All the variables were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Partial least squares-
structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), using WarpPLS 7.0 (Kock, 2016), was 
Road Transport Asset Management in Nigeria
PENERBIT UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA/27
used to analyse the data obtained and to examine the effect of the relationship 
among the constructs through the development of conceptual framework into 
a model. Warp PLS-SEM facilitates theory building in studies that seek to explore  
causal relationships between latent variables over covariance-based squares-
structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) that is generally used to confirm theory 
(Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). Moreover, PLS-SEM was employed for the analysis 
because of its high predictive ability and for examining the validity of reflectively 
measured constructs (Hair et al., 2014; Hazen et al., 2014). The conceptual 
framework is as shown in Figure 1.

The research constructs cover road transport asset management 
practice, physical innovation drivers and digital innovation drivers of the 4.0IR 
all measured using the 5-point Likert scale. The Likert scale is concerned with 
unidimensionality and is also the most popular scaling procedure that is commonly

used in the social sciences (Guidici, 2003; Oppenheim, 2000). The construct asset 
management practice was the dependent construct and was operationalised 
from very low management practice to very high management practice. 
The independent constructs, i.e. the physical and digital innovations, were 
operationalised using very low impact to very high impact. The operationalisation 
process was adapted from the studies of Team Leadership (2010) and that of 
Sumner and Slattery (2010). The data for this study was collected through a 
self-administered questionnaire that was returned and analysed using partial  
least square structural equation modelling PLS-SEM algorithms.
RESULTS 
Respondents Demographic Information
Table 2 depicts the respondents' demographic profiles. 50.72% of the respondents 
are project/facility managers working in the public sector of the economy while 
49.28% of the respondents are working in the private sector. This result shows that 
both the public and private sector of the economy is involved in the management 
of road transport asset facilities in Nigeria. However, the public sector is more 
involved than in the private sector. Thus, there is an expectation of transparency 
and accountability in their dealings. All the respondents hold at least a bachelors' 
degree in construction-related disciplines. Only about 13.77% of the respondents 
are Doctors of Philosophy (PhD) holders and about 39.86% have Masters of Science 
(Msc) degrees while almost 46.37% of the respondents hold Bachelors of Science 
(Bsc) degrees as their highest educational qualification. This shows that all the 
respondents are educationally qualified to respond to the research of this nature 
and as such, enhanced the validity of the research data. Also, Table 2 reveals 
that the study respondents have an average of 12.5 years' working experience in 
the road asset management practice; this implied that the professionals are very 
experienced in the area of this research. Overall, the mean of years of experience, 
Σfx/Σf = 3,450/276 = 12.5 years' mean experience.

Model Fit Indices
Past studies provided basic sets of guidelines and recommendations for 
information that should be included in any manuscript that has confirmatory 
factor analysis as the primary statistical analysis techniques, such indices includes 
chi-square (x2), alike information criteria (AIC), comparative fit, Parsimonious fit, 
goodness-of-fit index, standardised root mean square residual (SRMR), Bentler-
Bonett or normed fit index (NFI) and root mean square error (RMSE) (Schreiber 
et al., 2006; Davcik, 2014; Hair et al., 2014; Hazen, Overstreet and Boone, 2015; 
Xiong, Skitmore and Xia, 2015). However, Kock (2012) stated that there is a 
philosophical straight forward distinction between CB-SEM and PLS-SEM, if the 
research objective is theory testing and confirmation, then the appropriate 
method is CB-SEM. In contrast, if the research objective is prediction and theory  
development, then the appropriate method is PLS-SEM. Conceptually and 
practically, PLS-SEM is similar to using multiple regression analysis. On the interpretation 
of the model fit, if the goal is to only test hypotheses, where each arrow represents 
a hypothesis and then the model fit indices are of little importance. However,  
if the goal is to find out whether one model has a better fit with the original data 
than another, then the model fit indices are a useful set of measures related to 
model quality (Kock, 2012). 
However, PLS-SEM software algorithms reported the following indices: The 
fit indices are used to compare the indicator correlation matrices such as the 
standardised root mean squared residual (SRMR), standardised mean absolute 
residual (SMAR), standardised chi-squared (SChS), standardised threshold 
difference count ratio (STDCR) and standardised threshold difference sum ratio 
(STDSR). As with the classic model fit and quality indices, the interpretation of 
these indices depends on the goal of the SEM analysis. Since these indices refer 
to the fit between the model-implied and empirical indicator correlation matrices, 
they become more meaningful when the goal is to find out whether one model 
has a better fit with the original data than another, particularly when used in 
conjunction with the classic indices (Kock, 2012). When assessing the model fit with 
the data, several criteria are recommended as follows. Average path coefficient  
(APC) = 0.454, p < 0.001, average R-squared (ARS) = 0.619, p < 0.001, then average 
adjusted R-squared (AARS) was 0.616, p < 0.001, the average block variance 
inflation factor (AVIF) = 1.333, acceptable if ≤ 5, ideally ≤ 3.3, the average full 
collinearity VIF (AFVIF) = 2.071, acceptable if ≤ 5, ideally ≤ 3.3, VIF are used when 
indicators are formative. Tenenhaus goodness of fit (GoF) = 0.555, small ≥ 0.1, 
medium ≥ 0.25, large ≥ 0.36 then GoF is regarded as large, GoF is the geometric

mean of the average communality (outer measurement model) and the average 
R2 of endogenous latent variables, represents an index for validating the PLS 
model globally, as looking for a compromise between the performance of the 
measurement and the structural model, respectively. The Sympson's paradox 
ratio (SPR) = 1.000, acceptable if ≥ 0.7, ideally = 1. Therefore, it is acceptable in 
this study. The R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR) = 1.000, acceptable if ≥ 0.9, 
ideally = 1, it is regarded as ideal in this study. The statistical suppression ratio 
(SSR) = 1.000, acceptable if ≥ 0.7, so it is acceptable in this study. Nonlinear 
bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR) = 1.000, acceptable if ≥ 0.7, which 
is regarded as acceptable in this study. The standardised root means square  
residual (SRMR) value for this model was 0.07 which indicated a good fit (Hu and 
Bentler, 1999). Bentler-Bonett or NFI was 0.98 which was considered good (Bentler 
and Bonett, 1980). The RMSE for this model was 0.05 and regarded as good 
according to (Maccallum, Browne and Sugawara, 1996). Therefore, this model  
has a good fit index. 
MODEL ASSESSMENT USING WARP 7.0 PLS-SEM
Table 3 is resulted from the assessment of the model by Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM analysis 
which typically follows two steps, namely: the assessment of the structural model 
(Chin, 2010; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011) and reflective measurement model.  
The assessment of the measurement model examines the validity and reliability 
of the measurement instrument and relationship among the constructs. The 
model for this study has three reflective constructs namely: road transport asset 
management practice, physical innovation and digital innovations of an asset. The 
reflective measurement model evaluates the reliability and validity of the model. 
The two criteria are composite reliability (CR) and the average variance extracted 
(AVE) (Chin, 2010; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). This study used the internal 
consistency test to assess the reliability of the research instrument. According to 
Field (2016), Cronbach's alpha (α) tests the questionnaire's construct consistency 
and level of random error. The use of Cronbach's α allows the negative construct 
to be detected and positive to be accepted ranging from a scale of 0 to 1.0 
(Pallant, 2011). The minimum acceptable value for Cronbach's alpha is from 0.6 
(Field, 2016; Pallant, 2011). Once an item is to be used together as a scale in this 
study, the item must be within the benchmark value of reliability indicators. Ho 
(2006) stated that the reliability of a measuring instrument is defined as its ability 
to consistently measure the phenomenon it is designed to measure. Reliability, 
therefore, refers to test consistency. The importance of reliability lies in the fact that 
it is a prerequisite for the validity of a test. The internal consistency tests comprise 
of split-half technique, item analysis and Cronbach's alpha method. One of the 
shortcomings of Cronbach's alpha is that it usually under-estimates the reliability 
of a construct with small sample size (< 100), but construct with large sample 
size (> 100) Cronbach alpha is used to estimates the internal consistency of the  
construct (Chin and Newsted, 1999). However, Ho (2006) recommended Cronbach's 
alpha test as the most reliable among others. Cronbach's alpha test provides a 
unique estimate of the internal consistency or reliability of a scale, rather than there 
being a range of possible reliabilities.

Therefore, the indicator and construct reliability were assessed to 
evaluate the reliability of the reflective measurement model for structural 
equation modelling. The indicator reliability was evaluated by cross-checking 
the loading of each indicator variable on its associated latent construct and 
the loading should be higher or more than 0.70 before accepting the reliability 
of the indicator variable (Hulland, 1999; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). For the 
assessment of construct reliability, two coefficients are considered, i.e. CR and 
the Cronbach's alpha (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Cohen, 1988; Chin, 2010). Hair et al. 
(2014) recommended CR for PLS-SEM. Table 3 shows the results of the measurement 
model of this study which indicated high internal consistency and reliability.  
The indicators loadings were all well > 0.70 and both the CR and Cronbach's 
alpha are ranged from 0.929 to 0.971 and 0.917 to 0.966, respectively. This shows 
that all the indicators and constructs' reliability are acceptable. The convergent 
and discriminant validity are also considered in the validation of the reflective 
measurement model (Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). The AVE values of the 
constructs must be greater than 0.5 for an accepted convergent validity (Bagozzi 
and Yi, 1988; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). The AVE is only applicable for 
Road Transport Asset Management in Nigeria
PENERBIT UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA/33
models with reflective indicators. AVE measures the total variance of a construct 
through its indicators (Chin, 2010). The AVE values for this study are higher than  
0.70 as well as the loadings of the indicators. Therefore, the convergent validity of 
the measurement model is highly acceptable (Davcik, 2014).
DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY TEST
Table 4 indicates the discriminant validity of the measurement model. The 
discriminant validity is the extent to which construct is distinguished from other 
constructs in the model (Chin, 2010; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). This is achieved 
through checking of the AVE of each construct and must be higher than the 
highest squared correlation of the construct of any other construct in the model 
or the loading of an indicator with its associated construct must be higher than 
that with other constructs (Chin, 2010; Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011; Fornell and 
Lacker, 1981). The results indicated that the square root of AVE for each construct 
with its correlation to another construct is acceptable discriminant validity of 
the measurement model. Based on the results of the measurement model the 
questionnaires were acknowledged to be reliable and valid for the assessment of 
the three study constructs.

MEASURES AND PATH COEFFICIENTS OF THE MODEL
Figure 2 indicates the R2 measure of endogenous latent variables (constructs) 
and the path coefficients of the model. The model is evaluated as a part of a 
preliminary assessment of structural relationship, i.e. inner model and hypothetical 
framework (Chin, 2010, Hair et al., 2014). Therefore, Chin (1998) suggested 0.67, 
0.33 and 0.19 as substantial, moderate and weak measures for R2, respectively. 
The R2 for this study was 0.62 which indicated a moderate relationship between 
criterion and predictor variable. The influence of PHYINN on ASSMGT was also 
having βvalue –0.48 with a p < 0.00 significant at p ≤ 0.05 level. This means that a 
moderate negative influence exists between the construct (Cohen, 1988). 
Thus, implies an increase in PHYINN led to a non-linear decrease in ASSMGT.  
Similarly, the path coefficient between DIGINN and ASSMGT was having a 
βvalue of 0.43, respectively. Thus, indicating moderate influence (Cohen, 1988) 
with a p < 0.00 significant at p ≤ 0.05 level of significance. This implies that an 
increase in DIGINN would lead to an increase in the level of road transport asset  
management practice in Nigeria.

Table 5 indicates the effect size (f2) which is a measure that verifies whether 
the effects indicated by the path coefficient are low, moderate or high for the 
values of f2 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35, respectively (Cohen, 1988). Effect size (f2) indicates 
the effect of a certain construct on the dependent latent variable is substantial  
(Chin, 2010). The f2 between PHYINN and ASSMGT is 0.331 which indicated a 
moderate effect. The f2 between DIGINN and ASSMGT was 0.288 also indicates 
moderate effect sizes, respectively. The predictive competency of each 
endogenous construct in the model was determined by Stone-Geisser's (cross-
validated redundancy) (Q2) (Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011). The predictive skill of 
this model was 0.621 and Warp PLS-SEM automatically generates Q2 (Kock, 2012). 
Hazen et al. (2014) reported that Q2 values indicate the predictive relevance as 
either weak (0.02), moderate (0.15), or strong (0.35). Therefore, this model exhibit 
strong predictive relevance because of the Q2 > 0, i.e. about 0.621 (Chin, 2010). 
Thus, indicates the path model's predictive relevance on the endogenous construct 
is strong (Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011; Hazen et al., 2014). This implies that the 
two predictors (digital and physical innovators) predict 62% of the variance of the 
dependent variable (road transport asset management practice).

DISCUSSIONS
This study assessed the effect of 4.0IRs on the asset management practice in 
Nigeria. Two constructs were considered as a predictor or independent variables 
that predict the outcomes of the dependent variable, i.e. the road transport 
asset management practice. The constructs namely, physical innovation of road 
transport asset indicators were identified from studies of Jazdi (2014), Emmanouilidis 
and Komonen (2013), Gaetani et al. (2017) and Li, Hou and Wu (2017). The  
indicators of digital innovation were identified and adapted from the studies of 
Simmons, Palmer and Truong (2013), Peters (2017), Li, Hou and Wu (2017) and Morrar, 
Arman and Mousa (2017). The constructs were chosen based on the classification 
by Caruso (2018) that categorised drivers of the 4.0IR the 4.0IR as being physical 
and digital drivers. 
The 4.0IR builds on the previous revolutions and uses digital revolution that 
commenced in the middle of the 20th century. It is characterised by a fusion of 
technologies that is clouding the lines between the physical and digital spheres, 
enables industrial organisations to rapidly automate and digitalise traditional 
business processes of road transport management practice for example. The 
technologies enable the creation and maintenance of more intelligent products 
and services and ultimately transforms the global economy. 
Using the road transport asset management practice as the dependent 
construct and using variables identified from Burns, Hope and Roorda (1999), 
Switzer and McNeil (2004), Schraven, Hartmann and Dewulf (2011), Gunarathna 
and Hassan (2016), Lim, Porras-Alvarado and Zhang (2019) and Martin, Davey 
Road Transport Asset Management in Nigeria
PENERBIT UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA/37
and Clarke (2019), the effect of the 4.0IR was assessed. Specifically, the empirical 
study focused on the effects of 4.0IR on the asset management practices in 
Nigeria. The measurement model exhibited a consistent, reliable and valid 
questionnaire. Equally, the results of the analysis indicated a moderate effect 
between the independent constructs (PHYINN and DIGINN) and the dependent 
construct (ASSMGT). The path coefficients for the model were all significant. 
This supported the findings of (Switzer and McNeil, 2004). However, the findings 
seemed to contradict the findings of (Schraven, Hartmann and Dewulf, 2011) 
on the physical factors influencing asset management practice possibly for 
the reasons that the study considered building infrastructure projects only.  
Moreover, as suggested by Li, Hou and Wu (2017), government support and 
capacity is critical to realising greater benefits. This was the view of Benassi et al. 
(2020) that benefits from technology take time to realise.
Nonetheless, all the hypotheses developed for this study were supported. 
The graphs indicated non-linear relationships exist between the independent 
and the dependent constructs. The relationship between PHYINN and ASSMGT 
shows a negative relationship which implies that an increase in PHYINN leads to 
a decrease in ASSMGT. While for the relationship between DIGINN indicated a  
positive non-linear relation that implies that an increase in DIGINN leads to an 
increase in ASSMGT, respectively.
CONCLUSION 
The study aimed at assessing the effect of 4.0IRs on the road transport asset 
management practice in Nigeria with the view of improving road transport asset 
management practice in the country. The assessment of the effect is valuable 
for future improvement in the successful management of transport asset and 
maintenance delivery, as well as the enhancement of the infrastructure lifetime. 
The results identified areas of digitalisation for improvement of road transport asset 
management practice such as robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, 
Internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, 
blockchain and 3D printing drones, and the digital engineering. These are 
the drivers of 4.0IRs and are vital and as well as effective for the management 
of transport asset management practice particularly in developing countries 
like Nigeria. The results indicated a moderate effect change as regards to the 
digitalisation of road asset transport management practice. This means that 
increase use of digitalisation would enhance about 43% better management 
practice of assets in Nigeria which implies that moderate improvement in 
road asset management could be achieved with the optimum application of 
digitalisation innovation drivers. The study is limited to the application of the 4.0IR 
drivers (digital and physical drivers) to road transport asset management practice 
in Nigeria and consequently, the study recommends the adoption of 4.0IR drivers 
for road transport asset management for the transformation of the Nigerian 
road networks. It must also be fully realised that benefits may not be immediate 
but as the study has established, they are evident. Consequently, the study, 
recommends further and continuous studies on the potentials of the 4.0IR drivers for  
management of road transport asset practice in order to fully realise the potential 
that the technologies offer.
