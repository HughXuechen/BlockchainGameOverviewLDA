Nowadays, using Blockchain Technology (BCT) is growing faster in each country. It is essential to apply BCT in Supply Chain
Network Design (SCND) and is considered by the designer and manager of SC. 'is research indicates Viable Supply Chain
Network Design (VSCND) by applying BCT. A new form of two-stage robust optimization is suggested. Facility locations and
activation BCTfor VSCND is the first stage of decisions; finally, we determine flow transshipment between components in the next
stage.'eGAMS-CPLEX is used for solving themodel.'e results show that running BCTwill decrease 0.99% in costs.'ere is an
economic justification for using BCTwhen demand is high. A fix-and-optimize and Lagrange relaxation (LR) generate lower and
upper bound to estimate large scale inminimum time.'e gap between the mainmodel and fix-and-optimize is better than the LR
algorithm. Finally, this research suggests equipping VSCND by BCT that becomes more resilient against demand fluctuation,
sustainable, and agile.
1. Introduction
One of the new discussions in the present age is the Viability
of Supply Chain (VSC) in postpandemic adaptation. Ivanov
and Dolgui [1] proposed the viability of SC that includes
resiliency, sustainability, and agility. 'ey suggested that
organizational, informational, technological, financial, and
process-functional structure should improve and change as
follows:
(1) Organizational (subcontractor and backup supplier,
workplace resilience, facility fortification)
(2) Informational (data analytics, visibility, digital twins,
supplier portals, blockchain)
(3) Technological (robotics, additive manufacturing,
smart manufacturing and warehousing, industry 4.0)
(4) Financial (business-government, revenue manage-
ment, liquidity reserves)
(5) Process-functional (flexible capacity and sourcing,
inventory and capacity buffers, Omnichannel,
product diversification, and substitution) [2]
'erefore, using BCT is clearly toward VSC. 'e BCT
can help in the clarity and agility of SC [3]. Smart contract
executes contract automatically between layers of SC. After
every event happens, such as transactions by customers in
retailers, instant settlement and checkout processes are done
in all SC layers. 'is technology runs information sharing,

and all components of SC are aware of demands until the
end of chain.
Smart contract in BCT runs contracts well between
nodes, and financial transaction runs without human in-
tervention. However, establishing BCT in SC needs pro-
gramming and receiving correct input until giving the
correct output. 'erefore, it can mitigate risks and trans-
action costs [4]. Smart contract reduces costs compared to
traditional contract and when it runs, tractable and irre-
versible transactions are established [5]. In the blockchain
industry, Ethereum environments can implement smart
contracts for SC as well. When a smart contract starts, there
is no way to stop it. 'us, this procedure decreases demand
fluctuation, raises awareness of demand variation in all SC
layers, and decreases bullwhip effects [3]. 'is subject in-
creases SC’s resiliency and sustainability through SC’s
flexibility by sharing information on transactions and de-
mands, decreasing flow quantity in SC and CO2 emission,
and increasing satisfaction and welfare. Walmart for food
supply ecosystem, Ford for supplying cobalt, De Beers for
tracking diamond, UPS for tracking logistics, FedEx for
tracking shipments are companies that used BCT to add
transparency in SC. We should use this technology to
manage SC clearly, be resilient against demand, and be
sustainable for the future [6, 7]. In Figure 1, we can see the
trend of using BCTand the market size of BCT in USA from
2016 to 2028 and the market share of Europe in 2020; it can
show that the growth rate is 82.4% from 2021 to 2028.
'erefore, we should consider this trend, and every SC that
uses this technology can be successful in the future.
'e main contribution and motivation of this study are
as follows:
(1) Applying BCT to increase viability and agility of
SCND
(2) Using a new mathematical model for showing the
effects of BCT on SCND
(3) Adding resiliency, sustainability, and robustness to
VSCND by considering BCT
We organized this paper as follows. In Section 2, we
study on related work and show gap research in scope
SCND. In Section 3, we determine VSCND mathematical
model. In Section 4, the findings and results of the proposed
model with sensitivity analysis are explained. In Sections 5
and 6, the managerial insights and conclusion and outlook
are determined.
2. Related Work about SCND
Increasing the presence of investors in the cryptocurrency
industry has caused other people in the community to be
attracted to this industry. 'is subject has led many re-
searchers to focus on this area, which is described below.
Nayak and Dhaigude [9] reviewed and evaluated 178 articles
that employed BCT in SCs. 'ey presented that the benefits
of BCT include data management, improving transparency,
improving response time smart contract management, op-
erational efficiency, disintermediation, immutability, and
intellectual property management. Moreover, one of the
most important advantages of BCT is increasing SC resil-
iency, reducing disruptions, helping risk management, and
establishing multilayer protection [10].
We surveyed SC by applying BCT with considering the
mathematical model and other tools presented below.
Choi [11] proposed global SC operations with air lo-
gistics with a mean-variance (MV) approach for risk analysis
by applying the BCT era. 'ey utilized their model by
helping with the newsvendor problem. Choi and Luo [12]
surveyed data quality problems for emerging markets in
sustainable fashion SC. 'eir model includes decentralized
SC and implementing BCT to enhance the profit and
transparency of SC and increase welfare. 'ey used news-
vendor to the model problem and compared the decen-
tralized SCM model with BCT and centralized model. In
other works of Choi [11], he proposed BCTfor diamond SC.
He used BCT for exploring diamonds and compared the
traditional model with the BCT platform. He found that
using BCT platform can reduce cost and is beneficial to all
parties in the luxury SC.
Nayak and Dhaigude [9] suggested a conceptual model
for sustainable SC management (SCM) using BCT. 'ey
used Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Matrice
d’Impacts Croise’s Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classe-
ment (MICMAC) to draw a conceptual model, identify
factors, and show effects of BCT on SCM. Rahmanzadeh
et al. [13] designed a tactical SC planning model with open
innovation consideration within a BCT. 'ey proposed
using BCT for registering, collecting, and refining ideas in
open innovation. 'ey used a fuzzy mathematical model to
tackle uncertainty in the home appliances domain. 'ey
found that, by spending 1% of the total cost of SC, they can
receive good ideas and decrease 41% of the total cost. Dolgui
et al. [3] developed multiple logistics service providers by
considering a smart contract for flexible flow shop sched-
uling. 'ey used dynamic control theory for a running
model.
Manupati et al. [14] proposed a multiechelon green
SC for the production allocation problem by imple-
menting a blockchain approach. 'ey suggested a Mixed
Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) for a carbon
taxation policy for the greenness of the model. 'ey
showed that the distributed ledger-based blockchain
approach enables minimizing total cost and carbon
emissions. Liu et al. [15] surveyed a green agrifood SC by
applying information service based on blockchain and big
data (ISBD). 'ey applied Stackelberg’s game theory to
draw the model and solve investment decision problems.
'ey compared four models, surveyed the freshness of
agrifood by BCT, and used BCT for information sharing
between producer and retailer. De Giovanni [4] explained
that BCT could manage risks and transaction costs. He
drew a situation that suppliers and retailers can activate
by a traditional online platform or BCT. 'ey removed
transaction costs by BCT. Finally, they determined a
smart wholesale price and revenue sharing contract to
increase coordination between layers. 'ey utilized game
theory to solve the model.
2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
Alkahtani et al. [16] considered an e-agricultural SCM
with BCTequipment in a cooperative situation.'ey applied
the BCT into the agricultural SCM. Further, a Fuzzy In-
ference System (FIS) and Analytical Hierarchy Process
(AHP) are embedded to show uncertainties in the model.
'ey wanted to maximize profit with advertisement costs
constraints and space constraints. As this model was NLP,
they employed Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) to solve the
model.'ey found that the effect of BCTcan reduce the costs
of SCM. Zhong et al. [17] implemented a Stackelberg game
for container shipping lines and surveyed it using block-
chain. 'eir model uses two stages to define the freight rate.
'ey found that entering BCT can regulate the freight rate
and improve the price in the container shipping market. 'e
first stage is entering the blockchain or not, and the next step
is assigning container shipping lines. 'ey used the Stack-
elberg game and Cournot game for the second stage to show
BCT effects.
We classified the literature review in Table 1 and the
application of BCT in SCND. It can be seen that we want to
design VSCND by BCTplatform, which are not studied yet.
We present VSCND through (flexible capacity (resilience
strategy), sustainability constraints, and agility (by consid-
ering BCT)) for SCND. Finally, we add uncertainty through
the robust scenario by defining a new form of the objective
function.
3. Problem Description
In this research, we try to design VSCND with considering
BCT. 'e previous section shows a lack of research in
resilience and sustainable SC considering BCT. In the
present study, we have customers, retailers, manufacturers,
suppliers that transact in the BCTenvironment. 'e current
SC uses BCT and smart contracts and executes contracts
automatically between layers of SC. After customers transact
in retailers, all payments automatically expand in SC layers,
each component withdraws its share at once, and no charge
remains in the retailers’ accounts. Eventually, we present
VSCND through the flexible capacity facility (resilience
strategy), sustainability constraints, and agility (by consid-
ering BCT) for SCND.

Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3
In Figure 2, we used Ethereum smart contract
technology that pays at once after payment of customers.
We want to consider BCT instead of a traditional
transaction. 'erefore, using BCT enables reducing
variable costs. We draw a model that can select
applying traditional transactions with higher variable
costs or select BCT with lower variable costs. Still,
there are fix and maintenance costs for establishing BCT.
Hence, we need this assumption is as follows.
Assumption 1
(i) All demands should be prepared, and the shortage is
not permitted (agility)
(ii) Flow and capacity constraints are active in for-
warding SC (agility)
(iii) A BCT is used for payment in layers of SC de-
creasing variable cost (agility)

'e objective function (1) minimizes the weighted ex-
pected and maximum cost function in each scenario. We
proposed this form to increase robustness against demand
disruption and consider the worst case. Constraint (2) in-
cludes the summation of fix and variable costs. Constraints
(3) to (5) include the fix cost of establishing facilities and
BCT network in a central server and BCT maintenance.
Constraints (6) to (8) indicate the variable cost after
establishing facilities without running BCT and considering
BCT. Constraints (9) show satisfaction of demand. Con-
straints (10) to (12) show flow quantity between facilities.
Constraints (13) to (16) show resiliency strategy and facility
and capacity constraints dependent of scenario. Constraints
(17) and (18) show sustainability strategy and total emissions
and energy are less than maximum emission and energy.
Constraints (19) and (20) are decision variables, and con-
straints (19) are locations and binary variables and activating
BCT. Constraints (20) are positive flow variables.
3.2. Linearization ofMax andAbsolute Function. We need to
change objective function (1) and equation (6) from Mix
Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP (to Mixed Integer
Programming (MIP))) by operational research method. 'is
process decreases the time solution [22, 23].
Linearization of max function and absolute function is as
follows.
If k � max(Ωs), then we can replace these constraints
with the model k≥Ωs,∀s.
If k � |Ωs|, then we can replace these constraints with the
model k � αs + βs,Ωs � αs − βs, αs, βs ≥ 0,∀s.
We can change and linearize a binary and a nonnegative
variable that is produced.
Suppose z � Ax, if A is a nonnegative and positive
variable and x is a binary variable. 'erefore, we can replace
these constraints with the model [24]
z≥ 0, (21)
z≤Mx, (22)
z≤A, (23)
z≥A − (1 − x)M. (24)
6 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
It means that if xis zero, z is zero based on equations (21)
and (22). If x is 1, then z is A based on equations (23) and
(24).

of VSCNDBCT as follows.

ηs ≤M(xbt), ∀s, (33)
constraints (2)–(5) and (7)–(20).
We linearize model (1) by changing MINLP to MIP.
When we linearize it, speed solving and the complexity of the
model are more straightforward than MINLP in all solvers.
We show the complexity of VSCND; the numbers of binary,
free, and nonnegative variables and constraints are calcu-
lated as follows:

􏼌􏼌􏼌􏼌
􏼌􏼌􏼌􏼌􏼐 􏼑. (37)
It can be seen that scenario sets positively affect the
number of constraints and positive and free variables and
make the model scale grow. 'erefore, applying methods
that reduce scenarios such as Lagrangian relaxation (LR) and
fix-and-optimize helps solve fast in minimum time.
3.4. Lagrangian Relaxation (Lower Bound for Large Scale).
Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is an exact method that relaxes
complex constraints in a difficult problem, and because of re-
moving constraints, solution time decreases. 'is method
removes complex constraints and adds a penalty to the objective
with the Lagrange multiplier. In practice, this relaxed problem
can give us a lower bound for minimization and can often be
solved more quickly than the main problem [25–27].
Formulation of a MIP and changing to LR form are as
follows:
ZIP ≔ min c
T
x, (38)
subject to
Ax≥ b, (39)
Dx≥d, (40)
x integer. (41)
In this step, we remove constraint (39) and add it to
objective function (38) with the form of penalty cost and
used the Lagrange coefficient for this situation:
Z(λ) ≔ min c
T
x + λ(b − Ax), (42)
subject to constraints (40) and (41).
We need to find the maximum of λ that minimizes Z(λ):

'erefore, based on these steps, the objective function
(45) is LR of cost based on objective (25) that relax constraint

Subject to constraints (1)–(8), (10)–(20) and (26)–(33).
As can be seen, the complexity of the LR algorithm is as
follows: binary, positive, and free variables are the same as
equations (34)–(36). But constraints change into equation
(46). 'is subject decreases the time solution:

3.5. Fix-and-Optimize (Upper Bound for Large Scale).
Because this problem is Np-hard, we need an algorithm to
decrease the scale of this problem, produce an appropriate upper
bound, and solve the model in minimum time. We suggest a
new fix-and-optimize algorithm that creates an upper bound
based onFigure 4. Relaxation of each constraintmakes the upper
bound for the objective function and equal to or greater than the
amount of the primary objective function [21]. Fixing the binary
variables by this method produce an appropriate upper bound.
Finally, the objective function of the proposed method is always
equal to or bigger than the main model.
'is technique produces a close upper bound for the
primary model explained in Helber and Sahling [28].
'ese steps of the new fix-and-optimize are as follows:
(1) Relax binary variables by changing them between
zero and one and solve the model (relax constraint
(19)).
(2) After solving step 1, we receive a lower bound, and
our model is LP form.
(3) Loop:
(a) Summarize binary variables for each set and
round them up
(b) Solve the model with a new fix binary variable
(c) If the model obtains optimum value, it is an
upper bound, and we save it in a list
(d) Loop until the difference between two steps is
less than 0.001
(4) Sort ascending objective function and report less
upper bound objective function.
'e complexity of the fix-and-optimize algorithm is as
follows: binary variables are removed, and free, nonnegative
variables and constraints are the same as equations
(35)–(37). 'is subject decreases the time solution.
4. Results and Discussion
'is section had a case study and estimated parameters
defined in the notation list by the manager’s information
from the computer supply chain. We tried to show the
performance of the proposed model. 'e number of sets is
presented in Table 2, and amount of parameters are assigned
in Table 3. 'e probability of occurrence is the same, and
optimistic, pessimistic, and possible scenarios happen.
We applied a computer with this configuration: CPU
3.2GHz, Processor Core i3-3210, 6.00GB RAM, 64-bit
operating system. Finally, we solve the mathematical models
by GAMS-CPLEX solver.
We drew the potential location for assigning compo-
nents of VSCND in Iran (c.f. Table 4 and Figure 5). After
solving the model, it suggests that we activate BCT and
determine the location and flow of SC components. 'e
objective function is 2839008.413, shown in Table 2, and the
final location-allocation is drawn in Figure 6. Eventually, we
compare the model with BCT and without BCT in Table 5.
We can see that without BCT, costs are almost 0.99% greater
than with BCT.
4.1. Variation on the Scale of theMainModel. We determine
several large-scale problems in Table 6. When the scale of
problems increases, the time and cost increase as shown in
Figures 7 and 8. As shown in Figure 8, the time solution is
exponential and NP-hard on a large scale. 'erefore, we
need to solve the model by heuristic, metaheuristic [29], and
new exact solution in minimum time on a large scale.
4.2. Variation on the Conservative Coefficient. 'e conser-
vative coefficient (λ) is the number of conservative decision-
makers. We change it by varying between 0 and 1 that the
conservation of decision-maker has been changed. If the
conservative coefficient increases to 1, the cost function
8 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
grows in Table 7 and Figures 9 and 10. If λ increases by 25%,
the cost will increase by 0.3%, but the time solution does not
change significantly.
4.3. Variation on Demand. As shown in Table 8, the ap-
plication of BCT decreases and is not economical when
decreasing demand happens definitely. When demand
changes and increases, the cost will grow, and establishing
BCT is required to decrease cost (c.f. Figure 11). By reducing
40% for demand, the cost function decreases by 22%, and
BCT is not applicable.
4.4. Producing Bounds for the Main Model. We generate
lower and upper bounds and compare the main model with
the LR algorithm and a new fix-and-optimize strategy (c.f.
Table 9). In addition, by relaxing constraint (19) that is LP
form, we generate a lower bound for validating the LR al-
gorithm. 'e comparison of the three methods is deter-
mined in Figures 12 and 13.We see that the fix-and-optimize
strategy produces a suitable solution with a gap minimum of
10% and the LR algorithm produces a lower bound with a
gap of less than 32% for the main model. Also, it can be seen
that the cost function of P5 shows a difference between
methods for three methods (c.f. Figure 14). We suggest using
both approaches, but the fix-and-optimize strategy is better
than the LR algorithm for large-scale problems.
5. Managerial Insights and
Practical Implications
As managers of the SC, we should move forward to using
novel technology in SC to decrease cost and increase
resiliency and agility. BCT and cryptocurrency, renewable
energy, and Internet of 'ings are new technologies that
all of us need to use to improve the performance of SC.
BCTand cryptocurrency are some of the best technologies
that can facilitate financial transactions between cus-
tomers and suppliers. As a result, operational and extra
costs have been removed and make SC lean and agile. 'is
research designed a SCND by considering and estab-
lishing BCT and cryptocurrency. We apply SC run tra-
ditional or consider BCT. 'erefore, using BCT enables
reducing variable costs. We draw a model that can select
BCT with higher variable costs or select BCT with lower
variable costs, fix cost, and maintenance costs for estab-
lishing BCT. We found that applying cryptocurrency can
help SC to attain sustainability by decreasing cost and
being agile. When demand is high, using BCT and
cryptocurrency is an economic justification. Finally, we
design a model for all risk-neutral decision-makers until

risk-averse and cover all spectrum types. We surveyed this
model on a large scale and contributed fix-and-optimize
and Lagrange relaxation to generate upper and lower
bound when the solver cannot solve in logical time.
6. Conclusions and Outlook
Using a novel technology by SC is grown every day.
Technologies, such as cryptocurrency and blockchain, make
SC agile and lean and decrease operational costs. VSCND
applied resiliency, sustainability, and agility by embedding
cryptocurrency and BCT. We used a new robust two-stage
stochastic MIP for modeling this problem. We utilized
GAMS-CPLEX to solve the problem. We found that
establishing BCTand cryptocurrency for transaction reduce
costs for SC with high demand.
'e findings are as follows:
(1) 'e cost and time increase when the scale of
problems increases in Figures 7 and 8.
(2) If the conservative coefficient increases to 1, the cost
function grows in Table 7 and Figures 9 and 10.
When the conservative coefficient increases by 25%,
the cost increases by 0.3%, but the time solution does
not change significantly.
(3) 'e application of BCT decreases and is not eco-
nomical when decreasing demand happens. When
demand increases, it increases the cost function, and
establishing BCT is needed for reducing cost (c.f.
Figure 11). By reducing 40% of demand, the cost
function decreases by 22%, and BCT is not
applicable.
(4) We utilize fix-and-optimize and LR to generate lower
and upper bound to estimate large scale in minimum
time.'e results show that the gap between the main
model and fix-and-optimize is better than the LR
algorithm.
One of the important research limitations is solving the
large-scale main model. We propose applying exact algorithms
such as benders decomposition, branch and price, branch-and-
cut, and metaheuristic algorithms [30, 31]. We can add other
resilience, sustainable strategy, and multiobjectives [18, 19] to
the model and increase resiliency and sustainability such as
backup suppliers and improve node complexity.
Further, we suggest considering robust risk criteria such
as Robust Conditional and Entropic Value at Risk (RCVaR
and EVaR) [32, 33]. Researchers intend to investigate un-
certainty methods such as robust convex and stochastic
programming to close to the real world [34]. Using fuzzy and
novel robust optimization as a data-driven approach is
advantageous for a risk-averse decision-maker in the recent
decade. Eventually, we suggest equipping all SC with novel
technology such as Internet of'ings (IoT) and RFID [35] to
increase SC’s viability.
