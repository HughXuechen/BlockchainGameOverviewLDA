Abstract: Education is the foundation of basic human rights and the peace of mankind as well as
the pursuit of sustainable development. In this article, we have developed a blockchain-centered
educational program contributing to Goal 4, Quality Education, among the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and Education for SD (ESD). The education program featured herein consisted of three
lessons in total and has been developed to accommodate gamification techniques. We implemented
the education program on 704 elementary school students in Korea for three years from 2019 to 2021.
The effectiveness of the education program was primarily analyzed by paired t-test and technical
statistics analysis. In a pre-and post-education survey, digital literary, literacy, and numeracy were
all significantly improved, with satisfaction level rated at 3.91 out of 5 points. We hope that the
blockchain-themed education program proposed herein will provide implications for the promotion
of inclusive and equitable quality education.

1. Introduction
The 2015 United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted the ‘2030 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs)’ to be achieved by individual countries and the international
community in 17 categories by 2030. Education is a critical element of the sustainable
development agenda, and it has been reflected in SDG4-Education 2030 [1]. These goals
are building upon the outcomes and limitations of various past education agendas, for
example, ‘EFA, Education For All’ and ‘Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)’, the
‘Incheon Declaration’ from World Education Forum (WEF) hosted by Korea in 2015, and the
‘SDG4-Education 2030 Framework for Action’ suggested education goals to be achieved
by the whole world by 2030 [2]. The goal of SDG4-Education is to ensure inclusive and
equitable quality education and empower lifelong learning opportunities for all. To that
end, the UN put forward the following seven targets in connection with Goal 4 [3].
• Goal 4.1: Free Primary and Secondary Education
• Goal 4.2: Equal Access to Quality Pre-Primary Education
• Goal 4.3: Equal Access to Technical/Vocational and Higher Education
• Goal 4.4: Increase the Number of People with Relevant Skills for Financial Success
• Goal 4.5: Eliminate All Discrimination in Education
• Goal 4.6: Universal Literacy and Numeracy
• Goal 4.7: Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship
Given the suggested targets and implementation tools, SDG4-Education 2030 is a
universal agenda for all nations, extensively pursuing lifelong learning opportunities

for all, featuring a new focus on inclusiveness, equitability, and gender equality, and
emphasizing the effectiveness, appropriateness, etc. of learning [2,3].
The education program proposed herein has adopted gamification techniques to
converge education with game elements and to contribute to achieving the SDGs; this
research has come up with the following three questions in consideration of the educational
landscape and context in Korea:
• Does the blockchain-centered education proposed herein contribute to ‘Goal 4.1 Free
Primary and Secondary Education’?
• Does the blockchain-centered education proposed herein contribute to ‘Goal 4.4 In-
crease the Number of People with Relevant Skills for Financial Success’?
• Does the blockchain-centered education proposed herein contribute to ‘Goal 4.6 Uni-
versal Literacy and Numeracy’?
This article proposes an education program that can teach elementary students the
blockchain that can be a foundation to fostering innovative industries of the future. We
expected the education program to contribute to achieving particularly 4.1, 4.4, and 4.6
targets in support of Goal 4. To be more specific, we are confident that blockchain education
will enable quality elementary education and ensure gender equality in education by
allowing all to readily understand regardless of their gender. Furthermore, we believe that
the program will improve literacy and numeracy, enhance digital literacy, and foster talents
that understand blockchain technology in a bid to contribute to the ESD and the shared
development of the entire world.

2.1. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Korea
The UN adopted the SDGs in 2015 and has proposed and implemented a wide range
of implementation initiatives and actionable strategies in support of such goals ever since,
emphasizing exchange and cooperation. Against this backdrop, Korea hosted the ‘Incheon
Declaration’ in 2015 with awareness of potential marriage between sustainability and
education, proactively engaging in international partnership endeavors in prospect for and
carrying out educational initiatives with bearing on the SDGs [4]. In particular, the ESD
emphasizes that the agendas of SDG4-Education 2030 must contribute to learning contents
for the survival and prosperity of mankind as critical elements of SDG4 and key drivers of
other goals.
The SDG4 governance framework of Korea is built on two pillars: one is the activ-
ities of the SDG4-Education 2030 Council and the other is the private–public–academic
collaboration activities launched by the Ministry of Environment and the Presidential
Commission on Sustainable Development (PCSD) in support of the Korean SDGs (K-SDGs).
Represented in the SDG4-Education 2030 Council are 10 government agencies including
the Korean National Commission for UNESCO (UNESCO Korea), the Korea Educational
Development Institute (KEDI), the National Institute for Lifelong Education (NILE), the
Asia-Pacific Centre of Education for International Understanding (APCEIU), the Korea
Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation (KICE), the Korea Education and Research Infor-
mation Service (KERIS), the Korea Institute of Care and Education (KICCE), the Korean
Center for University Education (KCUE), the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Edu-
cation and Training (KRIVET), and the Korean Women’s Development Institute (KWDI),
whereas the SDG4-Education 2030 Council is joined by the aforementioned agencies and
the Ministry of Education (International Education Liaison Officer, Educational Statistics
Division) and the Statistics Korea (KOSTAT) (Statistics Research Institute, Statistics Training
Institute) in addition. Figure 1 shows the competent government agencies represented in
the SDG4-Education 2030 Council of Korea and put in charge of the targets of SDG4.

While Korea has been endeavoring to fulfill the SDGs, promoting the EDS as de-
scribed above, some challenges remain outstanding in the way forward. Speaking of Goal 
4.1 to begin with, although Korea features a relatively higher level of academic perfor-
mance [5], on the other side, a minority of young learners out of formal education reveal 
that they have undergone problems such as living in seclusion, NEET (Not in Education, 
Employment, or Training), running away from home, or offense; in addition, they rarely 
make career decisions [6]. Secondly, in terms of Goal 4.2, admission rates of young chil-
dren aged 3 to 5 to kindergartens or daycare centers have not dipped below 90% since 
2013 [7,8]. In terms of Goal 4.3, as Korea highly depends on private universities for tertiary 
education, tertiary education is deemed structurally accessible to most students [9]. In 
terms of Goal 4.4, ever since it became an ICT powerhouse, Korea has been rated low in 
terms of utilization of or attitude toward digital technologies. Furthermore, self-efficacy 
for digital technology utilization capability was found to be low, which calls for improve-
ment of digital literacy [10]. With regard to Goal 4.5, Korea has endeavored significantly 
to promote gender equality in education, achieving improvements in many areas. Cur-
rently, the school enrollment rate of female students in Korea is found to be higher or 
similar to that of male students. However, the problem is that the ratios of students taking 
science/engineering majors in universities are very unequal among different genders, 
with 80.9% of male students taking such majors and the ratio of female students standing 
a meager 19.1%. As science/engineering disciplines teach smart ICT and artificial intelli-
gence, which are the keywords defining the 4th Industrial Revolution, it is critical to en-
courage female students to take science/engineering majors in undergraduate studies [8]. 
Speaking of Goal 4.6, a literacy survey targeting Korean adults found that the demo-
graphic segment associated with significantly low linguistic proficiency and numeracy 
accounted for approximately 7.2% of the entire population. The survey findings may im-
ply that the overall literacy of the national population of Korea is high, but the problem is 
that the illiteracy ratio tends to be high among the female population, old-aged group, or 
rural residents. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide literacy education programs to the 
illiterate groups [11]. In terms of Goal 4.7, Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and ESD-
related activities have been incorporated into the 2015 educational curricula of Korea, with 
public education addressing learning topics related to global culture and international 
citizenship [12]. However, as metrics related to ESD and GCED are not defined in the 
international arena, it is still challenging to gather strictly relevant data. Fostering sustain-
able development and enabling global citizenship education requires benchmarking met-
rics to be developed and the current status analyzed.

2.2. Blockchain Education and Gamification
Blockchain technology was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it has been
touted as an innovation enabler for a variety of industries including logistics, distribution,
finance, healthcare, and so on. Blockchain is a type of distributed database managed over
peer-to-peer networks, with transaction data ledgers not stored in a centralized server but
across multiple nodes all connected by blockchain networks [13]. In particular, as many
transactions and services delivered offline have been migrated to the online environment
in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now critical to ensure the reliability and
security of data in the so-called ‘contactless’ era. Given the requirement, blockchain can be
a key enabler of data reliability [14]. This is the reason why elementary students need to
understand and learn blockchain technology. As children, potential leaders of the future,
are exposed to the promising technology and motivated to learn about it early on, they are
more likely to select blockchain-related jobs when they have to make a choice. Furthermore,
the UN has named blockchain as an accelerator of SDG fulfillment, suggesting it as a
solution to the global trust deficit disorder [15].
Convergence between blockchain and education is focused in most cases on the in-
corporation of blockchain technology in the Learning Management System (LMS) or other
systems to store and manage evaluation data and/or personal data. Turkanovic, M. et al.
implemented a blockchain-based higher education trust platform that could facilitate the
scoring and grading system of tertiary education worldwide to provide integrated per-
spectives to various stakeholders affiliated with higher education institutions, business
enterprises, and other organizations [16]. Sun, H. et al. conducted research that incor-
porated blockchain technology with online education. They argued that the blockchain
could solve issues associated with the reliability of online courseware, authentication
of school grades and certificates, privacy of individual students, sharing of courseware,
etc. They suggested that the blockchain be used to solve the issues by providing trusted
digital certificates, sharing learning resources on smart contract platforms, encrypting
data, etc. [17].
Meanwhile, blockchain education is in its embryonic stage in Korea and across other
parts of the world. In Korea, some universities started blockchain departments and training
courses as early as 2018. Kukmin University, Dongguk University, Sogang University,
and Hanyang University have launched blockchain departments to foster young talents
well-versed in blockchain technology. These courses deal with the blockchain platforms,
blockchain decentralized applications (dapps), public blockchain, distributed ledger, fin-
tech, software, etc. [18]. Overseas educational institutions, including MIT, EU Business
school, Fordham University, and Hochschule Mittweida University, are also conducting
blockchain-related courses. Most schools have recently been running these blockchain
education courses. While some schools conduct programs centered on blockchain technol-
ogy itself, some schools divide programs by subdividing blockchain technology, and some
departments are grafted with other fields.
There are far fewer blockchain education programs targeting children than those
designed for adults. However, some have attempted to bring the topic to children in a more
interesting way by utilizing board games or cartoons. Kim, J. et al. proposed a strategy to
educate the founding principles of blockchain to elementary students by utilizing gamifica-
tion, which includes educational games designed to teach the basic principles of blockchain
and the governing mechanisms of public and private blockchains [19]. Gamification is
intended to immerse players in the problem solving process and utilize game-playing
strategies and mechanisms in non-game situations, implementing gamification applica-
tions based on knowledge about game mechanics, game users, human behaviors, mobile
computing, etc., all consisting of games [20]. Gamification processing can be completed
in a series of problem recognition, target setting, game rule making, game element deter-
mination, simulation, and feedback [20]. Furthermore, as gamification functions with a
purpose other than simply playing, it can motivate learners to voluntarily engage in the
learning process at school [21]. Immersion in learning inspired by gamification is reported
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3761 5 of 18
to have a positive impact on learning attitude and class engagement [22,23]. In the case of
application of gamification for programming study, the learning consistency of the subject
showing a passionate demeanor was improved [24]. Being motivated by gaming rules,
the learners had a high satisfaction on a leaderboard that allowed them to follow up on
the progress, ranks, or points. Since game-based learning helps students comprehend
complex knowledge in specific disciplines, it might lead to immersion in learning for long
periods and accordingly obtain better learning outcomes [25]. Several studies also support
that gamification has merits in terms of learner motivation, career decision, and affective
domain [26,27]. Despite concerns that gamification would negatively influence learners,
games in lessons have demonstrated latent strengths that act as a versatile tool to ameliorate
existing problems in domestic, social, and psychological scopes [22]. As explained above,
when cutting-edge technologies are taught to elementary students, the addition of fun
elements such as games or cartoons helps young learners focus more intently on complex
technological principles and understand them with more ease.
2.3. Literacies for SDG4
It is important to foster talents having various skills and literacies in fulfilling SDG4,
which focuses on quality education. Firstly, digital literacy can be named as a global
indicator for Goal 4.4 [28]. Digital literacy has a close bearing on one’s life, as everything is
subject to digital transformation these days. Digital literacy is a competence required for
accessing, managing, understanding, communicating, and securely creating information
on digital devices [28,29]. Digital literacy encompasses a wide range of competencies
including ICT literacy, computational thinking, information literacy, media literacy, and
so on. Table 1 shows a global framework to measure digital literacy that can be used as
an indicator supportive of the fulfillment of Goal 4.4 designed by UNESCO. This digital
literacy domain covers basic knowledge of hardware and software, information and data
literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, problem solving,
and career-related competencies [29].
Secondly, to fulfill Goal 4.6, a considerable ratio of the global population should be
equipped with universal literacy and numeracy. First of all, literacy means a competence
with which an individual can understand, evaluate, utilize and engage texts to belong to a
society, fulfill his/her personal objectives, and develop his/her knowledge and potential,
whereas numeracy is required for accessing, utilizing, interpreting, and communicating
mathematical information and ideas to control and engage mathematical requirements
in various situations unfolding in one’s life [30,31]. To numerically evaluate literacy and
numeracy in Goal 4.6, the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
(PIAAC), the International Survey of Reading Skills (ISRS), the Literacy-Assessment-and-
Monitoring-Programme (LAMP), the Strategic Teaching and Evaluation of Progress (STEP),
etc. are utilized [26]. The PIAAC is a test designed to evaluate the literacy and numeracy of
adults, while the ISRS is a tool measuring primarily reading comprehension. The LAMP is
a system evaluating and monitoring the literacy of adults and the STEP is an evaluation
system tool to evaluate the competency of teachers for literacy education. The PIAAC
managed by the OECD and designed to evaluate both literacy and numeracy is broken
down to basic skill assessment and cognitive skill assessment. In the basic skill assessment,
basic reading skills and basic numeracy are measured [32]. In the cognitive skill assessment,
linguistic skills, numeracy, and adaptive problem solving skills are measured. Table 2
shows the areas and descriptions of the PIAAC assessment tool.

3.1. Research Procedure
The purpose of this article is to provide a momentum that can facilitate the fulfillment
of the sustainable development goals with the blockchain-themed education program
proposed herein. To that end, a research topic is defined to begin with. The research topic is
focused on Goals 4.1, 4.4, and 4.6 among the seven topics of SDG4 that Korea needs to fulfill
with relative urgency. Therefore, the research topic is documented as, ‘Does the blockchain
education proposed in this article contribute to SDG Goals ‘4.1 Free Primary and Secondary
Education’, ‘4.4 Increase the Number of People with Relevant Skills for Financial Success’,
and ‘4.6 Universal Literacy and Numeracy’?’.
Secondly, related research was conducted, with a study on the sustainability education
status in Korea to begin with. Secondly, the significance of blockchain technology for the
future and its potential for future jobs were studied and the current status of blockchain
education ongoing in Korea and other countries was examined. Thirdly, research data
were gathered on the digital literacy, literacy, and numeracy described in SDG Goal 4
and competencies required to be fostered for sustainable development. Data gathered
and examined as above provided inputs for the design of the blockchain education pro-
gram targeting elementary students in connection with the fulfillment of the sustainable
development goals.
Fourthly, an education program based on learning games was designed in a blockchain-
education-related study. Three learning games were developed for blockchain learning,
and an education program consisting of three lessons was developed around the games.
Next, a pilot test was conducted to validate the feasibility and field applicability of the
developed education program. Blockchain education was conducted on Korean elementary
students once a year for three years.
Lastly, to analyze the educational outcomes, the satisfaction level of the participants in
the blockchain-focused education program proposed herein was surveyed. Furthermore,
the degree of improvement in the digital literacy, literacy, and numeracy of the research
participants was identified before and after the education.
These analyses were intended to provide quantitative implications for whether the
education program herein can be utilized as an instrument for the fulfillment of sustainable
development goals. Figure 2 is the flowchart of the research procedure herein.

provinces and Seoul city in 2020. Excluding insincere responses from the 704 research
participants, we quantitatively analyzed the survey responses from 684 students. In 2018,
one year after the development of the education program, the geographical scope of the
program was limited to Jeju Island and Gyeongsangbukdo province, covering a relatively
small number of students. However, in 2019, the scope was expanded nationwide to cover
students in several regions. All the research participants were selected from students who
had not received any blockchain education before.
3.3. Developed Blockchain-Centered Educational Program
The blockchain-centered educational program proposed herein has been adapted from
the blockchain learning game of Kim, J. et al. and expanded as an education program
targeting elementary students [19]. We developed an education program designed to enable
students to understand the consensus mechanism underpinning blockchain and two types
of blockchain: public and private blockchains. The education program consists of three
lessons in total, with Lesson 1 for consensus mechanism, Lesson 2 for public blockchain,
and Lesson 3 for private blockchain. In all lessons, the students listen to the lectures of
teachers first and play games as learning activities. Figure 3 shows the development process
and contents of the education program.
In the blockchain education program, teachers explain the technological principles
and concepts of blockchain to students for each topic in a conventional one-way lecture.
Learning games are added to help elementary students understand relatively challenging
concepts with ease and fun. All learning games were developed in accordance with the
game development procedure suggested by Livingston, et al.: setting goals, selecting game
types, designing game structure, preparing game materials, making game rules, and testing
and modifying [33].
Firstly, the purpose of the game designed to help with the understanding of the
consensus mechanism is to get all the cards of the opponent. The game materials to be
prepared are cards. Cards required for the game are 18 total: 6 white cards, 6 blue cards, and
6 red cards. The same currency symbol is printed on the cards of all colors. The currency
symbol is set to six different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin,
Dogecoin, and Bitcoin cash. The game can be started when the cards are ready. Firstly, a
game party of two people is organized. A total of 36 cards are needed, 18 for each player.
The party members put six white cards turned upside down to show only the color in front
of them Then, each player turns over the opponent’s card, saying the currency symbol of
the card in turn. If the currency symbol disclosed matches that of the card turned around,
the card can be captured. When the white cards are all used up, the blue cards are used then.
The cards are turned around as the currency symbol is shouted. This time, two cards must
be turned around, with the currency symbol shouted two times. The cards can be captured
only when both currency symbols are correct. Lastly, the red cards can be captured when
three currency symbols are matched. As the game is played in three rounds, a student
who wins two rounds wins the game. As the game is played, students spontaneously learn
that it is more difficult to guess correctly three times than once, which indicates that the
consensus mechanism of the blockchain shows that the more nodes, the more difficult it is
to record them in a ledger.
Secondly, the purpose of the public blockchain learning game is to acquire as many
coins as possible within a specified time period. To play this game, four transaction ledgers,
200 coins, and one die are needed. The transaction ledgers are used as the reader board
of the game where the names of game players and coins acquired or lost per game round.
This game requires four party members. Each party member chooses a color out of four
different colors. When the color is chosen, all party members put their markers on the
marker board of their selected color. Then, all students are given 50 coins each. Then, the
game is all set to be started. Then, the die is thrown in turn by all students. Each student
can move their marker across the number of cells that match the number shown by the
die when thrown. When the die shows three, a marker is moved three cells ahead. If the
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3761 9 of 18
color of the destination cell matches the color selected by a player, he/she can throw the
die once more, trading coins by the double. If the die shows an odd number when thrown,
coins as many as the odd number must be paid to the owner of the color of the destination
cell. If the die shows five, a marker is moved five cells forward, and if the destination cell
is of green color (and the color of the student who threw the die is not green), five coins
are paid to the party member who chose green. If the trading volume has increased by
the double, 10 coins must be paid. If the number of the die is even, coins as many as the
number of the die are taken from the party member that chose the color of the applicable
cell. If the number of the die is four, a marker is moved four cells forward, and if the color
of the destination cell is yellow (and the color of the student who threw the die is not
yellow), four coins are taken from the party member who chose yellow. When the trading
volume has increased by the double, eight coins are taken in the same manner as above.
Whenever a transaction is made, all party members record them in their own transaction
ledgers. The player who has won the most coins in a given time period wins the game. As
the game is played, students will realize that the game is longer and more inconvenient
to play since they have to update their ledgers each time. However, they will also realize
that it is difficult to forge transactions, as they are required to document transaction details
each time. This mechanism is connected with the concept that a public blockchain is open
to everyone and its advantage is that it can ensure security and emphasize transparency.
Furthermore, it relates to the weakness of public blockchain that it is slow, as consensus
must be reached by many players and the ledgers synchronized continuously.

students participated in the research, with 69 from Jeju Island and Gyeongsangbukdo 
province in 2018, 232 from Gyeongsangbukdo, Gyeongsangnamdo, and Jeju provinces, 
and Seoul and Ulsan cities in 2019, and 403 from Gyeongsangbukdo and Gyeongsang-
namdo provinces and Seoul city in 2020. Excluding insincere responses from the 704 re-
search participants, we quantitatively analyzed the survey responses from 684 students. 
In 2018, one year after the development of the education program, the geographical scope 
of the program was limited to Jeju Island and Gyeongsangbukdo province, covering a 
relatively small number of students. However, in 2019, the scope was expanded nation-
wide to cover students in several regions. All the research participants were selected from 
students who had not received any blockchain education before. 
3.3. Developed Blockchain-Centered Educational Program 
The blockchain-centered educational program proposed herein has been adapted 
from the blockchain learning game of Kim, J. et al. and expanded as an education program 
targeting elementary students [19]. We developed an education program designed to en-
able students to understand the consensus mechanism underpinning blockchain and two 
types of blockchain: public and private blockchains. The education program consists of 
three lessons in total, with Lesson 1 for consensus mechanism, Lesson 2 for public block-
chain, and Lesson 3 for private blockchain. In all lessons, the students listen to the lectures 
of teachers first and play games as learning activities. Figure 3 shows the development 
process and contents of the education program. 
 
Figure 3. Blockchain education program. 
In the blockchain education program, teachers explain the technological principles 
and concepts of blockchain to students for each topic in a conventional one-way lecture. 
Learning games are added to help elementary students understand relatively challenging 
concepts with ease and fun. All learning games were developed in accordance with the 
game development procedure suggested by Livingston, et al.: setting goals, selecting 
game types, designing game structure, preparing game materials, making game rules, and 
testing and modifying [33]. 
Firstly, the purpose of the game designed to help with the understanding of the con-
sensus mechanism is to get all the cards of the opponent. The game materials to be pre-
pared are cards. Cards required for the game are 18 total: 6 white cards, 6 blue cards, and 
6 red cards. The same currency symbol is printed on the cards of all colors. The currency 
symbol is set to six different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Lite-
coin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin cash. The game can be started when the cards are ready. 
Figure 3. Blockchain education program.
Lastly, the private blockchain learning game is basically similar to the public blockchain
learning game, with slightly different rules adopted. Game materials to be prepared are
the same as those required for the public blockchain learning game. In this game, only one
student per game party is designated to document transactions. The student designated
so selects his own party members. Once the game parties are all set, the game is started.
When the die is thrown and a transaction occurs, the student documenting transactions
records all transaction details in the transaction ledger. All the other players document
their own transaction details in the ledger. Lastly, the student responsible for updating the
transaction ledger checks the ledger and announces the winner. The private blockchain
permits only authorized persons to join the blockchain network. This feature of the pri-
vate blockchain is implemented by the student designed to document transactions and
authorized to select party members. This game is expected to be finished earlier than the
public blockchain learning game, as one person is designated per party to document the
transaction ledger. The player authorized so is to play the role of central authority by
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3761 10 of 18
metaphor. In addition, teachers may intervene to make sure that students can learn that
they can forge transaction details with relative ease, as only a few authorities are allowed
us to administer transactions.
3.4. Instruments Used
For research instruments, a total of three tools were adopted, including an education
satisfaction assessment tool, a digital literacy measuring tool, and a tool that can measure
both literacy and numeracy. First of all, as the education satisfaction assessment tool, the
elementary student’s software education satisfaction assessment tool developed by Lee, Y.
et al. was adopted to the needs of the blockchain education herein [34]. The tool covers
four different categories: purpose and contents of education, learning game, education
environment, and career planning assistance. The Likert scale was set to 5-point. The KMO
value of the tool was found to be 0.899, with Bartlett’s test result p = 0.000 and Cronbach’s
α = 0.898. Thus, the validity and reliability of the tool were verified.
Secondly, the digital literacy measuring tool was developed in reference to the frame-
work of the digital literacy measuring tool designated by UNESCO, with questionnaires
designed to be comprehensible by elementary students [29]. It is a 5-point Likert scale and
the tool covers seven different areas, including the fundamentals of hardware and software,
information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital contents creation,
safety, problem solving, and career-related competencies. The area of career-related compe-
tencies covers capabilities and competencies for operating hardware or software, allowing
for flexible modification, depending on the competencies of jobs using digital technologies.
Thus, that area was changed to include questions on the understanding of blockchain
technology in this research. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value of the tool was 0.874,
with Bartlett’s test result p = 0.000, which vouches for strong validity. Furthermore, its
reliability was verified with Cronbach’s α = 0.816.
Thirdly, the tool that could measure both literacy and numeracy was developed in
reference to the PIAAC Assessment. As the PIAAC Assessment was designed to target
adults, its complexity was lowered to better suit the needs of elementary students. The tool
covers two areas: literacy and numeracy, with a total score of 100 points, with 50 points for
each area. In terms of literacy, the tool can measure basic reading skills and linguistic skills,
whereas in the numeracy area, basic numeracy and numeracy are measured. The KMO
value of the tool was 0.798, with Bartlett’s test result p = 0.001 and Cronbach’s α = 0.914,
which proves the validity and reliability of the tool.
3.5. Analysis Method
For the research methods, instruments were first developed to analyze the effects of
the blockchain-themed program developed herein. The research findings were gathered
and analyzed by IBM SPSS 24.0 program. The research tools were tested on validity and
reliability. For the validity test, KMO of technical statistics and Bartlett’s test were conducted
as a part of exploratory element analysis. In this research, the validity determination
criteria were set to KMO values of 0.6 or higher as generally used in social science studies
and Bartlett’s test outcome p of the significance level of less than 0.05 [35]. In addition,
Cronbach’s α was obtained to determine the reliability of the tool. Cronbach’s α value of
0.6 generally used as a reliability benchmark in social science studies was selected as the
reliability criterion for the questionnaire [36].
To determine whether the blockchain modules proposed herein can contribute to
the fulfillment of Goal 4.1, a satisfaction level survey was conducted after education, and
correlations of satisfaction level with participation in education were identified through
technical statistics analysis and Pearson correlations analysis with sub-areas. Furthermore,
in connection with the fulfillment of Goals 4.4 and 4.6, in the annual education programs,
pre-and post-digital literacy, literacy, and numeracy scores of the participating students
were analyzed via paired samples t-test.

4.2. Digital Literacy Improvement by Blockchain Education 
The blockchain-themed program developed herein was used on 704 elementary stu-
dents in Korea from 2019 to 2021. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to identify cor-
responding improvements in digital literacy, literacy, and numeracy. The education pro-
gram was used on different research subjects each year, so all participants were first ex-
posed to the program regardless of the year. Therefore, variation in competencies across 
different years was meaningless. Hence, the study findings of all research subjects of the 
three years were aggregated and analyzed. 
Firstly, in terms of digital literacy, statistically significant findings were gathered in 
five areas out of seven, including communication and collaboration, digital content crea-
tion, safety, problem solving, and career-related competences. In other areas including 
basics of hardware and software and information and data literacy, average test scores 
were somewhat improved but not significantly after the education. Digital literacy was 
improved from the pre-education average of 2.81 to 3.20 points after the education. Table 
5 shows the paired samples t-test outcomes of digital literacy before and after the educa-
tion program. Figure 6 visualizes in box plots the differences between the pre-test average 
and the post-test average per area.

5. Discussion 
Embarking on this research, we attempted to quantitatively analyze whether the 
blockchain education program designed by us could be an ESD enabler for SDG Goal 4. 
Accordingly, we defined three specific search topics in a bid to identify the contribution 
of the blockchain education proposed herein to Goals 4.1, 4.4, and 4.6. 
Firstly, Goal 4.1 is about ensuring equitable-quality, free elementary and middle 
school education for all male and female children so that they can demonstrate appropri-
ate and effective learning performance. The blockchain education program proposed and 
designed herein was launched in public schools so that the students could access the ed-
ucation program free of charge. Furthermore, given the high satisfaction level among the 
students with the education program (M = 3.91 points), it was noted that the students were 
satisfied despite the program introducing an unfamiliar concept. Hence, the education 
program is deemed to have contributed to the fulfillment of Goal 4.1 In addition, the con-
tents of the blockchain education program had static correlations with the satisfaction of 
learners with the education game and career planning, and it was indicated that they 
could be satisfied with participation in the program even if they were still in need of dig-
ital literacy. This program will be further refined and adapted before being released free 
of charge to all schools and institutions for free use. Furthermore, training programs for 
schoolteachers will be launched to refine their technological competence for blockchain 
technology. 
Secondly, Goal 4.4 is about increasing the number of people equipped with appro-
priate skills including professional job skills required for job placement, decent jobs, and

with the education program (M = 3.91 points), it was noted that the students were satisfied
despite the program introducing an unfamiliar concept. Hence, the education program is
deemed to have contributed to the fulfillment of Goal 4.1 In addition, the contents of the
blockchain education program had static correlations with the satisfaction of learners with
the education game and career planning, and it was indicated that they could be satisfied
with participation in the program even if they were still in need of digital literacy. This
program will be further refined and adapted before being released free of charge to all
schools and institutions for free use. Furthermore, training programs for schoolteachers
will be launched to refine their technological competence for blockchain technology.
Secondly, Goal 4.4 is about increasing the number of people equipped with appro-
priate skills including professional job skills required for job placement, decent jobs, and
entrepreneurship. Global indicators for the fulfillment of Goal 4.4 include digital literacy.
As digital technologies are connected with all industries at the onset of the fourth Indus-
trial Revolution, understanding digital technologies and devices is getting increasingly
significant for one’s life [37]. In particular, for elementary students, digital literacy is ex-
pected to be named as one of the essential competencies for remaining competitive in the
future [38]. After being exposed to the blockchain-centered educational program proposed
herein, the digital literacy of the students was improved by 0.39 points on average from
the pre-education level of 2.81 points on average to 3.20 points. Furthermore, five out of
seven sub-areas featured statistically significant findings. The two areas where statistical
significance was not found were the basic knowledge of hardware and software and the
data literacy required for assessing data and sharing content with digital technologies. They
are deemed to be attributable to the fact that the blockchain education herein is a far cry
from basic computer knowledge and data management required for simply turning on/off
computers. Meanwhile, what is noteworthy in the digital literacy analysis findings is that
the difference in the pre-and post-education averages for the career-related competencies
was most drastically improved. This implies that the students who had little knowledge
about blockchain became aware of the importance and future potential of blockchain tech-
nology, which indicates that the education program is effective for future career planning.
Blockchain technology is one of the promising technologies that can guarantee placements
in decent jobs. Through gaming activities that implied concepts of informatics derived
from professional fields, young learners can experience career-related works in information
technology [27]. Accordingly, it is indicated that the education program herein had a
significant impact on the fulfillment of Goal 4.4.
Goal 4.6, which is the last research topic, is about the accomplishment of literacy
and numeracy. To fulfill Goal 4.6, it is important to ensure that students are better skilled
in linguistic and numeric competencies. When the education program was conducted
on students, their linguistic skill, a sub-area of literacy, was improved with statistical
significance. However, basic literacy did not show a statistically significant difference, as
the blockchain education program did not have a significant bearing on the improvement
of reading skills involving a selection of appropriate words for a given sentence or correct
sentences. Meanwhile, in terms of numeracy, the education program improved both basic
numeracy and numeracy skills with statistical significance. Such activities as trading
cryptocurrencies or documenting transaction ledgers in learning games are deemed to have
been conducive to improving the understanding of and prowess with numbers. These
findings demonstrate that the education program herein could contribute to improving the
linguistic and numeracy skills of students. Therefore, the education program is deemed to
have been conducive to the fulfillment of Goal 4.6.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted that gamification receives the spotlight due
to its value in increasing prompt learner responses, learning immersion, participation,
motivations, and immediate interactions in an online learning environment [23]. Though
this study adds that the gamification approach is helpful to teach and learn core principles
of blockchain technology, it has not demonstrated how the gamification approach affects
elementary school students in the online context. Thus, it is imperative to develop a further
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3761 16 of 18
refined program on blockchain for the online version to widely spread for vulnerable
learners.
6. Conclusions
Blockchain is touted as underpinning the fourth Industrial Revolution characterized
by hyper-connectivity and super-intelligence [39]. The World Economic Forum forecasted
that 10% or more of the global GDP would be associated with blockchain technologies by
2025 [40]. In particular, given its features that can decentralize data controlled by a central-
ized system in the pact and allow individuals to transact among themselves, blockchain
technology is being welcomed as an innovative enabler for finance, manufacturing, public
service, culture, and distribution sectors. Hence, blockchain technology, to be ever signifi-
cant in the future, is regarded as an essential technology with which children, our future
leaders, must be familiar.
This article focused on Goal 4 out of the SDGs and proposed an education program uti-
lizing blockchain as game content and enabling students to readily access and understand
blockchain technology by playing games. In so doing, the students were encouraged to im-
prove their digital literacy, literacy, and numeracy to contribute to quantitative fulfillment
of Goal 4 and enable ESD, facilitating the fulfillment of the SDGs in the end.
Yet, the education program herein, which specifies elementary students as a primary
target, is not suitable for middle or high school students or adults. Furthermore, as the
education program is not sub-divided per skill level of learners, it may not be applicable
to learners who already understand what blockchain is. In addition, although SDG4 has
a total of seven targets, we focused on potential contributions to the fulfillment of Goals
4.1, 4.4, and 4.6. Concerning the limitation of the research, we will continue to refine and
develop the education program to meet the varying needs of different skill levels of learners.
In addition, we will conduct studies and analyses subsequently to provide quantitative
implications for the other four targets.
