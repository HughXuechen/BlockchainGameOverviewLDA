Counterfeiting is common in many industries. For the authenticity of online channel products and to combat counterfeiting,
many companies have begun to use blockchain technology to trace product information. )is paper investigates a dual-channel
supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, in which the manufacturer sells its standard products through the
retailer and adopts blockchain technology to launch the online channel to sell the traceable products. A Stackelberg game is
developed to depict the pricing decision and channel strategy choice for the manufacturer. It shows that both the manufacturer
and the retailer can benefit from blockchain adoption. And the longer it takes for product traceability, the lower the price of online
traceable products. It is beneficial for the manufacturer when consumers in the market are less concerned about information
transparency. For consumer sensitivity, as consumers’ acceptance of direct sales channels increases, the selling prices of online
traceable products have risen. Furthermore, as the traceability time-sensitivity coefficient increases, the sales price of the traceable
products decreases, and the retail price of offline standard products rises.)e conclusion of this paper has a certain guiding role for
the dominant manufacturers in choosing whether to apply blockchain technology to improve the demand for traceable products.
1. Introduction
According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the
national online retail sales in 2020 were 11.76 trillion RMB,
while the online retail sales of physical goods were 9.76
trillion RMB Yuan, accounting for 24.9% of the total retail
sales of consumer goods [1]. Although the online consumer
market has continued to grow and develop in recent years,
online consumers cannot access products and cannot ef-
fectively distinguish between the authenticity and reliability
of product-related information. Products in the categories of
fresh agriculture, mother and baby, alcohol, beauty and
makeup, second-hand goods, luxury goods, cross-border
goods, and medicine are often replaced by imposters on the
Internet. For the manufacturer, to meet consumers’ per-
sonalized preferences and pursue consumers’ demand for
product traceability, the manufacturer needs to deal with the
problem of enhancing their profits while relieving channel
conflicts, as well as the issue of consumers’ demand for
product traceability by considering product information
transparency. At present, there are shortcomings in the
product sales chain, such as opaque product information,
difficulty tracing the origin of products, and difficulty
proving the authenticity of products, etc. By adopting
blockchain technology, we can make use of its decentralized,
nontemperable, traceable, collective maintenance, and open
and transparent features [2].)erefore, after setting a unique
label for the product, the logistics information of each
product can be tracked and recorded, and consumers who
purchase products supported by blockchain technology can
trace the source of the product. For example, Wyeth
products, by adopting the anticounterfeiting traceability
service of JD blockchain, enable consumers to purchase with
confidence [3]. In 2016, Walmart tested the traceability of
mangoes in a store, and it took 6 days, 18 : 26, to trace the
mangoes back to their farm of origin. But after adopting
blockchain technology, the traceability is completed, and all
relevant information is obtained in only 2.2 seconds [4]. )e

above are the results of the application of blockchain
technology in enterprise practice, and the following is the
theoretical research on the application of blockchain tech-
nology in practice by scholars.
In terms of research on the impact of blockchain
technology on supply chain decision-making, scholars at
home and abroad mainly focus on the impact of blockchain
technology on traditional supply chain goals, customer
viscosity, traceability, transaction costs, and social welfare.
Kshetr [5] and Tian [6] propose that the application of
blockchain to the supply chain will improve transparency
and responsibility and increase customers’ trust in product
features. Kamblea et al. [7] believe that traceability is the
most important reason for the realization of blockchain
technology in the agricultural supply chain. Zhang et al. [8]
combine blockchain technology with the Internet of )ings
and big data to solve the difficult problem of collecting
reliable data in life cycle assessment. Tönnissen and Frank
[9] use a case analysis method to explain how to use
blockchain technology in supply chain operations and
management. Christoph and Stephan [10] propose that
blockchain can limit the impact of opportunism, environ-
mental and behavioral uncertainty in the supply chain,
thereby reducing transaction costs. Yan and Zhang [11]
discuss the influence of risk aversion coefficient and
blockchain technology application degree on supply chain
decision-making. Liang and Xiao [12] analyze the impact of
the introduction of specific parameters such as blockchain
technology on the channel selection of a dual-channel supply
chain. Furthermore, many scholars have focused on in-
vestigating the dual-channel supply chain when the man-
ufacturer provides homogeneous products. Chen et al. [13],
Tang et al. [14], and Zhou and Ye [15] examine the influence
of nonprice factors such as product quality on the sales of a
single product in different channels. Wan et al. [16], Li et al.
[17] reflect the negative impact of retailer services on the
online channel and find that implementing product dif-
ferentiation is beneficial to both online and offline channels.
Dan et al. [18] investigate the impact of retail services in
retail channels and customer loyalty on pricing decisions in
dual-channel supply chains. In terms of supply chain
pricing, Huang et al. [19] investigated the impact of supply
chain members’ altruistic preference behavior on the pricing
decisions of supply chain members when consumers’ green
preferences were considered. Xu et al. [20] consider optimal
pricing decisions and profit issues in centralized and
decentralized systems of dual-channel supply chains under
mandatory carbon emission regulation. Hosseini-Motlagh
et al. [21]conduct a study on energy-saving efforts in
remanufacturing and forward logistics in closed-loop supply
chains and analyze how remanufacturing and energy-saving
efforts affect competitive selling prices and recycling rates.
Motlagha et al. [22] point out the impact of demand in-
terruption on RSC in a reverse supply chain (RSC) system
and obtain the optimal pricing under demand interruption
and a harmonized scheme using a combined two-part tariff
contract.
Our paper contributes to the literature on whether direct
sales channels adopt blockchain technology and channel
pricing strategies. In the existing dual-channel supply chain
research, considering the few factors of blockchain tech-
nology, the research on the traceability time of online
traceable product information transparency is also rarely
involved. Christoph and Stephan [10] also focus on con-
sidering whether different dual-channel structures under
homogeneous products need to introduce blockchain
technology. )is paper starts from the perspective of
manufacturers opening online direct sales channels and
introducing traceable products through channel invasion
based on a single channel. Focus on consumer channel
preferences, the level of transparency of blockchain product
information, the differentiation of online and offline
products and services in direct dual-channel pricing, and the
decision on whether to bring traceable products online.
To sum up, this paper introduces blockchain technology
into the dual-channel and provides some guidance for
whether the online channel adopts blockchain technology.
Furthermore, the impact on manufacturers and consumers
is explained from the perspective of manufacturer infor-
mation transparency. We will study how to help manu-
facturers adopt blockchain technology in direct sales
channels to solve the problem of product inauthenticity and
traceability. How manufacturers’ costs change and how
consumer sensitivities affect manufacturers when adopting
blockchain technology. Specifically, we will solve the fol-
lowing research issues:
(1) Under what conditions will the manufacturer adopt
blockchain technology to offer traceable products?
(2) How should the manufacturer introduce traceable
products to alleviate channel conflicts? What are the
effects of adopting blockchain technology on the
prices and profits of both the manufacturer and
retailer?
2. Problem Description
)e manufacturer sells standard products through offline
traditional retail channels and sells traceable products
through online direct sales channels, as shown in Figure 1. In
this study, the manufacturer, as the leader of the Stackelberg
game, decides the selling price in the direct channel and the
wholesale price for the retailer. )en, the retailer, as the
follower, determines the retail price of standard products.
)ird, both the manufacturer and the retailer are completely
rational decision-makers, which means that both make
optimal decisions based on the principle of maximizing their
profits.
)e retailer wholesales the standard product from the
manufacturer at the wholesale price w and sells it to con-
sumers at the retail price pr. )e manufacturer sells the
traceable products directly to consumers at the price pd. We
denote consumers’ acceptance level of the online channel as
θ, where (0≤ θ≤ 1), and the consumers’ valuation of the
products as v , which is uniformly distributed on. )en, the
consumers’ valuation of the online products is θv.
Consumer utility of the online direct sales channel is
related to the level of transparency of traceable products’
2 Complexity
information (product information includes transaction in-
formation, origin information, product information, and
logistics information) and the time of traceable products’
traceability. )erefore, the consumer utility of the online
retail channel can be expressed as Ud � θv − pd + e − βt.
We denote the level of traceable products’ information
transparency as e (0≤ e≤ 1), which the larger the value,
the more realistic the product. )e consumers’ sensitivity
to the traceable products’ traceability sensitivity to time is
β and the time spent waiting for product traceability from
the consumer is t. )en, the consumer utility of the offline
retail channel can be expressed as Ur � v − pr.
When the manufacturer and the retailer sell these two
products at the same time, which product consumers choose
depends on the size of the consumer’s surplus value. So,
when Ud >Ur and Ud > 0, we have pd − e + βt/θ< ]<pr−
pd + e − βt/1 − θ, and consumers choose to buy online
traceable products. When Ur >Ud and Ur > 0, we have
]>max(pr − pd + e − β/1 − θ, pd − e + βt/θ), and con-
sumers choose to buy standard products offline. When
Ud � Ur, we have ] � pr − pd + e − βt/1 − θ, under which
there is no difference in the utility of consumers buying two
products.
)rough the residual value function, we get the online
direct sales channel demand Qd and the offline retail channel
demand Qr respectively as

We denote the cost of each traceability of the manu-
facturer as l/t, and the cost of single traceability is related to
time t. Furthermore, the shorter the traceability time, the
higher the cost. We refer to Aspremont [23]and other
documents for the explanation and the form of innovation
input cost. We denote one-time fixed cost to be paid by the
manufacturer for introducing blockchain technology as e2/2,
which implies that the higher the level of transparency of
traceable products information, the higher the cost, where
pd > l/t.
When pr ≤ (pd－e + βt)/θ, the online direct sales
channel has zero sales, that is, consumers will only buy
standard offline products, so this situation is outside the
scope of the study. When pr > (pd − e + βt)/θ, both sales
channels have their own demand. )erefore, using the in-
verse solution method, the retailer’s optimal response is
obtained as
pr �

From the first stage of the game, the manufacturer de-
termines the sales price of online traceable products pd and
the wholesale price of offline standard products w, and the

Proposition 1. As the level of information transparency of
online traceable products increases, the selling price of online
traceable products also increases, while the retail price of
standard offline products and the profitability of the retailer
decrease.
Proof. Solving for the first-order condition of the optimal
selling price pd of the online traceable products, the optimal
selling price pr of the offline standard product, and the
maximum profit πr of the retailer for the level of information

Proposition 2. shows that the manufacturer improves the
level of information transparency of online direct marketing
channels. 1us, consumers’ pursuit of information trans-
parency makes them more inclined to purchase traceability
products online. 1us, the manufacturer raises the sales price
of online traceability products. 1e retailer is at a competitive
disadvantage due to the impact of online direct marketing
channels. 1erefore, the only choice is to lower the sales price
to maintain sales volume.
Proposition 3. As the time-sensitivity factor β for the
traceability of the traceable products increases, the selling
price of the traceable products decreases, while the retail price
of standard offline products increases.
Proof. Solving for the first-order necessary condition of the
optimal selling price pd of the traceable products and the
optimal selling price pr of the offline standard product for
the time-sensitivity coefficient β of the traceability of the
traceable products, respectively, we can get

Proposition 4. shows that as the time-sensitive factor of
traceability of traceable products increases, the price of
traceable products decreases. As a result, the manufacturer
lowers the price of traceable products to offset the long wait
time for consumers. In contrast, consumers’ increased trust in
standard offline products have led retailers to raise prices.
3.2. Comparison of theDual-Channel Supply Chains of Online
Traceable Products and Standard Product. When direct sales
channels do not adopt blockchain technology to sell
traceability products, the supply chain becomes a dual-
channel supply chain of standard products (indicated by the
superscript “S”). )erefore, the consumer utility of online

Proposition 6. shows that after adding an online traceability
service based on a standard product dual channel, the cost of
the online direct sales channel increases. As a result, the
manufacturer takes advantage of consumers’ preference for
online traceable products to increase prices in online direct
sales channels. For the retailer, the emergence of traceable
products has eased the channel competition brought about by
selling homogeneous products online and offline. 1e retailer
no longer needs to cut prices to retain consumers, and profits
have also improved to a certain extent compared to standard
product dual-channel supply chains.
4. Numerical Analysis
4.1. Effect of Consumer Online Channel Acceptance on
Price. Numerical tests are conducted by taking β � 0.02, t �
2, l � 0.3 and θ variations in the range [0, 1], respectively, to
obtain the effect of changes in consumer online channel
acceptance level θ on price. Figure 2 shows that as θ
gradually increases from 0 to 1, the sales price of online
traceable products tends to increase, while the sales price of
offline standard products tends to decrease. As consumer
acceptance of online direct sales channels increases, con-
sumers will be more likely to buy products online.)erefore,
the manufacturer increases the selling price of online
traceable products. For the retailer, due to the impact of
direct sales channels, the retailer is at a disadvantage and can
only choose to lower sales prices to maintain sales.
4.2. Comparison of the Manufacturer’ Profits in the Dual-
Channel Supply Chain of the Traceable Products and Standard
Products. Numerical experiments are conducted by taking
β� 0.02, t� 2, l� 0.3, and θ within the range of [0, 1] re-
spectively. It can obtain a comparison of the profits of the
two types of dual-channel supply chains used by the
manufacturer. Figure 3 shows that when consumers’ ac-
ceptance of the direct sales channel is not big. )erefore, the
blockchain input cost of the direct sales channel cannot be
offset, which makes the manufacturer’s profit decline. In
addition, when the acceptance of direct selling channels is
higher than a certain value, the profit of the dual-channel
supply chain adopting blockchain is always higher than that
of the standard product dual-channel supply chain. When θ
is constant, and as β increases, the manufacturer’s profit in
the dual-channel traceability product decreases. Only when
θ is too large and β is small enough, the profit of the
manufacturer adopting the blockchain be greater than the
profit of the manufacturer not adopting the blockchain.
4.3. Effect of Traceability Time on Price. Numerical exper-
iments are conducted by taking θ� 0.8, β� 0.02, l � 0.3,
and twithin the range of [0, 10] respectively. It can be used
to obtain the effect of traceability time on price. Figure 4
shows that when the traceability time of the traceable
products continues to increase for direct sales channels,
the sales price of traceable products continues to drop. For
the retailer, the retail prices of offline standard products
show a trend of rising first and then falling. When t in-
creases to a critical value, it is always higher than the direct
selling price.
5. Extension
)is section extends our basic model by introducing con-
sumers’ sensitivity parameters to the level of information
transparency of traceable products to check the robustness
of the conclusions. Specifically, after introducing parame-
ters, a new dual-channel model is constructed. )en, we
solve the corresponding optimal solution. Finally, we
graphically explore the impact of the changes in the sum on
manufacturers and retailers.
5.1. 1e Model by Introducing Consumers’ Sensitivity
Parameters. )e new model introduces consumers’ sensi-
tivity to the transparency level of blockchain product in-
formation c, and other parameters are the same as the basic
model. )erefore, the consumer utility of the online direct
sales channel can be expressed as Ud � θv − pd + ce − βt.
And the consumer utility of the offline retail channel can be
expressed as Ur � v − pr.
)rough the residual value function, we get the online
direct sales channel demand Qd and the offline retail channel
demand Qr, respectively, as

5.2. Consumers’ Sensitivity to the Level of Information
Transparency of Traceable Products. Numerical tests are
conducted by taking θ � 0.8, t � 2, l � 0.3, η � 1 and c
variations in the range [0, 1), respectively. )erefore, we can
get the impact of changes in consumers’ sensitivity to the
transparency level of traceable product information on
manufacturers and retailers.
Figure 5 shows that when consumers’ sensitivity to in-
formation transparency is lower than a certain value, the
increase in consumers’ sensitivity to traceability time will
increase the manufacturer’s profit. However, when it is
higher than a certain value, consumers’ increased sensitivity
to time will reduce the manufacturer’s profit. )erefore, the
sensitivity of consumers to information transparency should
not be too high, which will be more conducive to the increase
of the manufacturers’ profits.
Figure 6 shows that the profit of retailers with dual
channels of traceability products is always higher than
that of retailers with dual channels of common products.
In addition, when consumers’ sensitivity to information
transparency is lower than a certain value, the increase in
consumers’ sensitivity to traceability time will increase
the retailer’s profit. However, when it is higher than a
certain value, consumers’ increased sensitivity to time
will reduce the retailer’s profit. )erefore, the sensitivity
of consumers to information transparency should not be
too high, which will be more conducive to the increase of
retailer’s profits.

6. Conclusion
)is paper investigates the dual-channel supply chain for
online traceable products and uses the Stackelberg game to
find the optimal decisions for the manufacturer and the
retailer and compares the results with the product prices and
profits of the dual-channel supply chain for standard
products. In addition, we also extend the model by con-
sidering consumers’ sensitivity to the transparency of
traceable product information. We can draw the following
conclusions:
(1) )e inclusion of traceable products in the dual-
channel supply chain of standard products can in-
crease the profits of both the manufacturer and the
retailer and can mitigate channel competition.
(2) When consumers’ acceptance of online channels
exceeds a certain threshold, the manufacturer’s
profits will increase. But when consumers’ accep-
tance of online channels is below a certain threshold,
the manufacturer’s profits will decrease. )e man-
ufacturer can obtain higher profits by controlling the
transparency level of blockchain product informa-
tion while also improving brand awareness.
(3) When the manufacturer adds online traceable
products to their standard product dual-channel
supply chains, they can mitigate the impact of online
direct sales channels on offline retail channels, thus
allowing the retailer to realize a degree of increased
product sales prices and profits.
)e conclusions of this article have a certain guiding
effect on whether the dominant manufacturer chooses to
apply the dual-channel supply chain model that considers
the adoption of blockchain online.
)is paper analyzes the impact of blockchain technology
on dual-channel supply chain pricing from a manufacturer-
dominated perspective. If we consider the complete infor-
mation setting in this paper, However, in the presence of
customer loyalty, the coordination problem of the supply
chain with asymmetric information is an interesting and
challenging issue. It can be further expanded in future re-
search, such as further analyzing the role of blockchain in
combination with social welfare and considering the impact
of blockchain technology on sustainable development.
