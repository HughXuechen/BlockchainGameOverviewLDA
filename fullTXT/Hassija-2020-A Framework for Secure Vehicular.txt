Abstract— Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET)
poses to be a promising technology for the future since
it increases the comfort level of the drivers while also
enhancing the safety measures for them. The main aim
of VANETs is to enable communication among vehi-
cles and roadside units (RSUs) using vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) and vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) networks. VANET
applications have a vast potential for growth owing
to the increasing number of smart cities around the
globe and advancement taking place in the technology
sector. However, with all their benefits, VANETs also
face several security challenges. The sensitive nature
of data being transferred turns VANETs prone to ma-
licious attacks. To overcome the security challenges,
this paper proposes a distributed Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) enabled vehicular network comprising
several requesting vehicles and RSUs. The proposed
model is based on advanced blockchain and therefore
provides a strong level of security and data im-
mutability. Furthermore, the interactions between the
requesting vehicles and the RSUs have been modeled
using an auction-based game-theoretic smart contract
deployed on the blockchain.

I. INTRODUCTION
The VANET application has become a topic of
enormous interest in the past few years and is
being researched extensively. VANET works on the
vehicle domain of the ad-hoc network and con-
sists of RSUs, sensor-enabled vehicles and wireless
interconnection to enable communication between
them. As one of the major components of Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS), VANET - 1) helps
in integrating technology to increase safety, 2) en-
ables inter-vehicle communication, and 3) provides
mechanisms for effective traffic management. In
addition to this, VANET enables drivers to make
the right decisions by making them aware of the
traffic conditions in advance. Figure 1 illustrates the
basic architecture of VANETs [1]. VANET consists
of two different types of networks: 1) infrastructure
oriented networks that deal with the RSUs and 2)
infrastructure-less networks that deal with the ad-
hoc vehicles. Sensors called On-Board Units (OBU)
are embedded in the vehicles and are tasked with
the responsibility of storing and processing the in-
formation [2], [3]. Furthermore, OBUs forward the
messages to vehicles or RSUs in the V2V and V2R
networks. Vehicles also carry a multiple application
unit (MAU) or a single application unit (SAU) that
makes use of the communication capabilities of
the OBU to use the applications provided by the
provider.
Communication between VANETs can be rep-
resented using three different domains: Roadside
domain (RSD), ad hoc domain (AHD), and in-
vehicle domain (IVD). RSD consists of RSUs, in-
ternet, and other gateway components. Some of the
major attacks that RSD is prone to include routing
and DDoS attacks. In routing attacks, the attackers
send several messages to the RSUs in order to
exhaust the resources in the VANET network. AHD
is the domain that facilitates V2V and V2R com-
munication. Major attacks faced by AHD include
routing and authentication attacks. In authentication
attacks, the attackers generate fake IDs from the
original ones and transfer false information. IVD
enables the interaction of an SAU or an MAU with
OBUs. In IVD, the attackers try to gain information
from the OBUs by generating fake IDs or cause
malfunctioning of the application units by sending
some harmful viruses into the VANET network.
Besides these, VANETs are prone to several other
attacks, as discussed in [4] and [5].
Communication and information sharing is an
essential aspect of VANETs; therefore, efficient and
precise data sharing using trustworthy resources is
very important. Furthermore, to prevent a major
crisis in the VANETs, security and privacy issues
need to be considered [6]. Every domain of VANET
is equally important and needs to be secured from
all kinds of malicious attacks. The need for security
in VANETs arises due to the following reasons [7]:
1. Attackers are attracted towards VANETs owing
to the sensitive nature of the data being shared.

2. The presence of several wireless links in the
infrastructure of VANETs makes them very
susceptible to malicious attacks.
3. Security and privacy of a user is at threat.
4. Spoofing of valid IDs and intrusion in VANET
communication is easy for malicious attackers.
To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we
propose a DAG-enabled vehicular network consist-
ing of several vehicles and RSUs. Since our model
leverages a distributed ledger technology (DLT), it
is privacy-preserving by design.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Existing work done in the direction of securing
VANET applications has been described in Section
II. Section III presents the proposed distributed
model for secure vehicular communication. In sec-
tion IV, the proposed game-theoretic smart contract
is established for optimal price formulation for data
sharing among vehicles and RSUs. The numerical
analysis is presented in Section V, and the paper is
eventually concluded in section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
This section summarizes the various works done
in the direction of securing VANETs and the various
domains in which they are applied.
Lei Zhang et al. [8] have proposed a tamper-
proof privacy-preserving mechanism for VANETs,
which reduces the required vehicular storage space
by compressing signatures and verifying several
messages together. Instead of using ideal TPDs
(tamper-proof devices), their model uses realistic
TPDs. They have used the NS-2 simulator for the
purposes of simulation and evaluation.
The authors of [9] have discussed safety applica-
tions for the VANETs, such as cooperative aware-
ness messages (CAM). Vehicle tracking is possible
through the spatiotemporal and periodic information
given by CAM. Various schemes concerned with
privacy in the VANETs have been evaluated in their
research, and the impact of those schemes on safety
applications has also been analyzed. Furthermore,
a privacy metric based on distortion has also been
proposed in the paper. The accuracy of the proposed
privacy metric is analyzed by comparing it to many
famous privacy metrics.
In [10], Bhakti Pawar et al. have established an
attack-resistant trust (ART) scheme for secure and
high-quality VANET communication. The authors
have also presented a comparison between their
1261

proposed model and the baseline method in regards
to QoS metrics like throughput and communication
overhead.
The authors of [11] have presented a compre-
hensive survey of the several security and privacy
challenges that hinder the performance of VANETs.
Their work also evaluates the efficiency of a number
of cryptographic solutions that have been suggested
in existing literature for securing VANETs.
Mohammad Wazid et al. [12] have proposed
a mechanism demonstrating three different mutual
authentications between vehicles, cluster heads, and
roadside units (RSUs). For maintaining a secure
communication, a secret key is also maintained
between RSUs as per their scheme. In the pro-
posed model, in-depth details about the registration
phase, authentication, and key agreement phase,
RSU2RSU key establishment phase, password up-
date phase, and dynamic RSU addition phase have
been provided. The authors have demonstrated the
feasibility of their proposed mechanism in the
VANET environment with the help of the NS-2
simulator.
In [13], the authors have proposed a new cipher-
text policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE)
scheme, which overcomes the challenges faced by
the traditional CP-ABE. In the proposed scheme,
RSUs perform nearly all the computation to im-
prove the vehicles’ efficiency of decryption. To
enhance the factors like computational cost, com-
munication, and distance from RSUs, deep learning
techniques such as decision trees have been used.
In addition, the authors have thoroughly discussed
the security issues and the access control scheme in
VANETs.
Rawat et al., in [14], have proposed a scheme
to detect data falsification attacks made by ma-
licious users in VANETs. In this scheme, hashes
are used to detect the attacks and further enhance
the security level of the vehicles. The performance
is improved by enabling on-time forwarding of
correct and precise information to the vehicles in
the neighborhood. The simulation results presented
demonstrate that their proposed approach reduces
delay and increases the throughput in the VANETs.
The authors of [15] have introduced an end-
to-end authentication mechanism for protecting
VANETs from malicious attacks that also helps
in confirming confidentiality-integrity-availability
(CIA) services. In their approach, CIA security
has been achieved by transferring the data in an
encrypted form.
Although there are various works in the direc-
tion of securing vehicular communication, all these
works are based on centralized architectures. Such
architectures are highly prone to a single point of
failure and other malicious attacks such as DDoS.
Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed network
based on advanced blockchain to secure commu-
nication in vehicular networks. A sample smart
contract based on game theory is also proposed to
model the interaction between vehicles and RSUs.
III. PROPOSED MODEL FOR DECENTRALIZED
V2V COMMUNICATION
IOTA enables the creation of a secure distributed
network with support for a large number of nodes.
IOTA uses a DAG, more specifically, a tangle, to
store the transactions occurring between the nodes
in the network [16]. Even though blockchain is a
tamper-proof, and open data structure, IOTA has
been preferred over conventional blockchain in our
model to avoid forking and pruning issues. Besides,
IOTA provides several unique features that set it
apart from the traditional blockchain, including high
scalability, zero-fee transactions, and secure data
transfer [17]. Since nodes in an IOTA network,
in this case, the vehicles and the RSUs, operate
directly with one another without involving any
central authority, the security of the data being
transferred is ensured.
In any DLT, a consensus algorithm is required to
achieve reliability in the network and establish trust
between the unknown nodes. IOTA has recently
adopted a new consensus mechanism named coordi-
cide that is extremely scalable and truly decentral-
ized. Using the coordicide mechanism, consensus
finality can be achieved in seconds without having
to wait for confirmation by external entities. Coordi-
cide mechanism further increases the reliability of
transactions by reducing the need for reattachments
[18].
IV. OPTIMAL PRICE FORMULATION
In a V2R model, any vehicle inside the range
of an RSU can request it for information like the
location details of other vehicles. The requesting
vehicle can get the location data of other vehicles
through two routes: 1) location data is transferred
directly from the nearby vehicle to the requesting
vehicle 2) location data is first transferred from the
queried vehicles to the nearby RSU, and then from
the RSU to the vehicle requesting for the data. Fig.
2 shows the transfer of data via the two routes, as
mentioned above.
In the following section, an auction-based game-
theoretic approach to minimize the cost incurred by

Fig. 2: Bandwidth sharing among vehicles and RSUs.
the requesting vehicle to request data from the RSU
is presented.
A. Auction based game theory for bandwidth allo-
cation
Consider a model consisting of several vehicles
and a single internet-connected RSU. Whenever
a vehicle comes within the range of the RSU, it
can query the RSU for information such as traffic
details, weather data, GPS data of other vehicles,
etc. If there are a total of v vehicles within the range
of a single RSU, then V =
{
V1,V2, ...,Vi...,Vv
}
represents the set of vehicles where i ∈ (1, v)
denotes the index of the vehicle Vi.
Each vehicle Vi queries the RSU for certain
information that is measured quantitatively in terms
of the bandwidth requested by that vehicle. Since
the total bandwidth, χ that the RSU can allocate
is limited, χ needs to be divided among the v
vehicles. The bandwidth requested by each vehicle
is represented by γi where,
γi < χ (1)
Λ =
v∑
i=1
γi (2)
Along with the bandwidth request, the requesting
vehicles also submit the prices that they are willing
to pay in order to acquire the requested bandwidth.
If Pi denotes the price offered by the vehicle Vi,
then:
Φ =
v∑
i=1
Pi (3)
Consider two cases pertaining to the total band-
width requested:
Case 1: If Λ 6 χ, then there is no need for
an auction since the bandwidth requirement
of each vehicle can be satisfied at the offered
price itself.
Case 2: If Λ > χ, then a conflict will arise
since each vehicle will try to maximize the
bandwidth that it can acquire and minimize the
price at which it can acquire that bandwidth.
To solve the problem, as mentioned in the second
case, there is a need for an auction-based game-
theoretic model. Let π = (γ,P) be a vector repre-
senting the bid of each vehicle in the game theory
model such that πi = (γi,Pi) represents the bid
of the vehicle Vi. Allocation of bandwidth to each
vehicle Vi takes place when all the vehicles have
submitted their bid and depends on the bids of all
the requesting vehicles. The allocated bandwidth,
αi can be calculated using:
αi = min
(
γi,
Pi
Φ
χ
)
, ∀ γi < χ (4)
The cost, Ci, of the bandwidth allocated to the
vehicle Vi can be mathematically modeled as:
Ci = αiPi (5)
Since all vehicles are not within the range of the
RSU at all instances, a valuation function δi for
each vehicle Vi is introduced. If Ti,in and Ti,out
denote the time spent by the vehicle Vi inside and
outside the range of the RSU respectively, then the
valuation function can be calculated as:
δi = Ti,in + Ti,out (6)
1263

where,
Ti,in = τin ∗ c log (1 + %αi) (7)
Ti,out = µ(τout) (8)
Here c and % are logarithmic constants and µ is
a satisfaction function which is further discussed
in the section below. τin and τout represent the
summation of time-in and time-out of the vehicle
Vi respectively.
To simultaneously maximize the bandwidth ac-
quired and minimize the price paid to acquire it, a
QoE function θ has been defined. θ is calculated as
the difference between the cost, Ci and the valua-
tion, δi as formulated in eqns. 5 and 6 respectively.
If P−i denotes the prices offered by all vehicles
other than Vi then θ is formulated as:
θi(Pi,P−i) = δi − Ci (9)
B. User Satisfaction and Nash Equilibrium
Let τo denote the time duration for which the
vehicle is unable to fetch the data from RSU. The
user satisfaction function, µ, used in eqn. 8 is de-
fined as a function of τo and can be mathematically
modeled as follows:
µ (τo) = 1− 1
1 + exp (−ρ (τout − υ))
(10)
where ρ and υ are constants. The suitable cost that
can maximize the QoE delivered to each vehicle is
given by Nash Equilibrium and can be calculated
as follows:
P∗i = σi
(
P∗−i
)
(11)
where σi denotes the best response made by the
vehicle Vi and can be mathematically formulated
as:
σi(Pi) = arg max

V. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
For the evaluation of our V2R model, we have
considered four vehicles having different time-in
and time-out in the DAG-enabled network. The
time-out of a vehicle is calculated as the difference
in total time and time-in of that vehicle. The time-in
of vehicles is assumed to be in the range of [10, 50]
minutes in the frame window of 60 minutes. The
required bandwidth of four vehicles while entering
in the network is assumed to be γi = {6, 12, 18, 24}
bits per second and the corresponding price offered
by each vehicle is taken as Pi = {30, 40, 50, 60}
cents. For every iteration, we increase the number
of vehicles in the network and consider the change
in QoE of the four vehicles under consideration.
Finally, each vehicle is allocated its required band-
width at a minimum possible price and maximum
possible QoE.
Fig. 3 demonstrates that the bandwidth allocated
by the RSU to any vehicle V1 varies with the price
offered by that vehicle and the total number of
vehicles in the network. It can be observed that
the bandwidth allocated to the vehicle V1 decreases
with an increase in the number of vehicles in the
network and vice versa.
The variation in QoE with the change in the
bid prices at a fixed bandwidth requirement (γ) is
shown in Fig. 4. Since the QoE of the vehicles de-
pends on the bids of all the vehicles in the network,
there is no guarantee that the QoE will increase with
an increase in the offered price. It can be seen in the
figure that, initially, the QoE of vehicles increases
with an increase in the bid price. However, at a
certain price point, the bandwidth allocation by the
RSU to a particular vehicle saturates. For example,
the saturation point of the first vehicle (with γ = 6)
occurs during the first bid itself. Therefore, the
subsequent increase in bid prices causes the QoE
of that vehicle to decline.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a secure and dis-
tributed framework for vehicular communication.
In addition to providing all the security features
present in blockchain, this DAG-enabled framework
also resolves the scalability issues of the traditional
blockchain. A sample auction-based smart contract
is also proposed to model the V2R cost bargaining
for data offloading. The simulation results show
that the proposed model enhances the QoE of the
vehicles in the network while minimizing the costs
incurred by them. Furthermore, complicated smart
contracts can be deployed in the same network
to model different interactions between different
parties involved in the network.
