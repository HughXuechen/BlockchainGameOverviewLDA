Abstract
In e-commerce, sellers can disclose product information (such as quality, size information,
function, and so on) to make consumers understand the products. However, in the process
of information disclosure, consumers often fall into information distortion or information
loss. Because of its immutability and traceability, blockchain can help e-commerce sellers
improve information disclosure and ensure the efficiency of information transmission. We
study a duopoly competitive e-commerce market in which two e-commerce sellers compete
in information disclosure. According to whether to apply blockchain, we divide the sellers’
decision-making into four research scenarios (NN, BN, NB, BB). Based on the above four
scenarios, we get the market demand of different products depending on the consumer utility,
and further establish the game model in the competitive environment. This paper explores
the impact of blockchain on information disclosure and consumer surplus, and achieves the
Nash equilibrium of blockchain application for both sides. In the expansion model, we study
e-commerce sellers’ risk aversion and capital constraints, and further explore their impact on
blockchain in practice. Finally, combining with blockchain’s characteristics, we also analyze
the impact of the application of blockchain at other aspects on the supply chain. We find that
when consumers’ trust in information is low or the cost of blockchain applications is low, all
e-commerce sellers in competition will adopt blockchain. In addition, when consumers have
low trust in information, it will be difficult to achieve complete equilibrium in the application
of blockchain as their risk aversion increases. For capital constrained sellers, when the cost
of blockchain application is low, it will be difficult to achieve full equilibrium for blockchain
applicants as the bank financing rate increases.

1 Introduction
1.1 Research background andmotivation
1.1.1 Problems in information disclosure
In e-commerce transactions, sellers and consumers in different time and space cannot physi-
cally contact and perceive the goods that need to be purchased under offline consumption, and
can only judge the goods’ quality by the information from the text, pictures and videos pro-
vided by the merchants. Online sellers can increase the information disclosure (for example,
product specifications, dimensions, use experience, etc.), which helps to reduce consumers’
perception of risk (Montecchi et al., 2019) to improve consumers’ understanding on the prod-
uct, and accordingly, consolidate consumers’ preference for the product to increase the sales
to certain extent. Consumers consider that it is always good for online sellers to increase
information disclosure, while online sellers believe that increasing information disclosure
will add more burden in different ways. For example, online sellers can introduce the details
in the product description to consumers through beautiful pictures, where each additional
picture requires professional personnel to design and upload, thereby the cost cannot be
ignored. Moreover, if the online seller acts as a middleman, he/she will review the resale
products when he/she sells the products, and increasing the information disclosed means
increasing the review content, which will also increase the labor and management costs. As
a result, there is a tradeoff between the potential benefits of disclosing more information in
increasing demand and the costs associated with it.
However, consumers are always in a passive position when receiving the information,
which causes many of them to shout "fooled" after trying on the goods, and find that there
is a wide gap between the real appearance of the goods and the "seller show". It should
be emphasized that the false propaganda is one of the main manifestations of information
asymmetry, which is more obvious in such industries as food, health products, clothing and so
on. In particular, the health products industry is the hardest hit by false propaganda, especially
during the COVID-19 epidemic. The relevant complaints exist from January 1, 2020 toMarch
6, 2020, of which 76% are from the accused enterprises concentrated on the e-commerce
platform, while 24% from other purchase channels. The statistics show that water purifiers
are the major health products with the most complaints at this period. The proportion of
consumers’ complaints against false propaganda is as high as 37.5%. In the promotion of
health food, some enterprises deliberately blur the difference between functions and curative
effect, and deliberately exaggerate the efficacy. The reason is related not only to the online
sellers’ adverse selection, but also to the lack of middlemen’s strict scrutiny.
1.1.2 The role of blockchain
Fortunately, blockchain can solve information asymmetry to some extent. Information disclo-
sure can be realized through blockchain. This means that all previously disclosed information
will be permanent, and current and future users will be able to view the history of all public
information. Because everything is more transparent, the product authenticity can be traced
back. It is worth mentioning that if blockchain supports information disclosure, the platform
must pay special attention to avoiding errors, because the information is always there. Table
1 shows the characteristics of blockchain related to product information disclosure.

As for the application of blockchain, e-commerce sellers can establish alliance chain
based on the whole life cycle of the supply chain. The upstream primary suppliers, secondary
suppliers and downstream e-commerce platforms and consumers can constitute different
nodes of the blockchain network. As shown in Fig. 1, blockchain facilitate three steps for
product information from generation to disclosure: information broadcasting, information
verification and block generation. Information broadcasting is convenient to broadcast the
generated product information to all nodes. Information verification is to verify the accuracy
and credibility of all node information. Only qualified information will be packaged and
further released. When the disclosed information is written, the e-commerce seller’s identity
and release time are also written into the blockchain ledger and notify all the nodes in the
network. Viewing the blockchain ledger can promote the verification of the seller’s identity
and release time.Viewing the blockchain data of the information source, consumers can judge
the credit of the information disclosed by e-commerce sellers, so as to judge the credibility of
the information to certain extent. Based on the traceability of blockchain, the source of false
information will be easier for people to obtain. Even if speculators publish false information,

people can trace back to the source through blockchain. Therefore, blockchain can guarantee
the authenticity and integrity of the disclosed information.
1.1.3 Information disclosure competition
In the aspect of e-commerce operation, in addition to the importance of product disclosure,
we should also be aware of the competition among industries, the uncertainty of consumers’
willingness to buy and financial constraints. Among them, the high uncertainty of industry
competition and consumers’ willingness to buy is more obvious in the mobile phone indus-
try, luxury industry and other high-consumption industries. This has led to online sellers’
rational sales judgment. Traditional competition is mainly reflected in two aspects: price
competition and quantity competition. However, with the development of the Internet, the
importance of information is self-evident, which makes e-commerce sellers have to consider
the competitors’ information decisions when disclosing information. Take the mobile phone
market as an example, for two mobile phones with similar performance, one seller will show
consumers its powerful photo function and reasonable price, while the other seller will show
its beautiful appearance and powerful function on this basis. Such examples are common in
e-commerce. After the application of blockchain, we need to pay attention to the impact on
such information disclosure competition.
1.2 Research questions andmain conclusions
Based on the industry practice of e-commerce sellers in the real world and the importance
of product information disclosure in blockchain era, according to consumers’ product pref-
erence, two competitive e-commerce sellers are divided into two types, e-commerce sellers
with competitive advantages and e-commerce sellers with competitive disadvantages. We
consider four clear situations, namely: neither of the two competitive sellers use blockchain,
only the seller with competitive advantages uses blockchain, only the seller with competitive
disadvantages applies blockchain, and the two competitive sellers both apply blockchain.
We analyze and construct a duopoly game model of game theory separately, and discuss the
product information disclosure game and blockchain application game between e-commerce
sellers. We have also expanded the model and analysis in terms of risk aversion and financial
constraints, and generated additional insights.
To be clear, this paper is to study the following research questions.
1. In the basic model of two competitive e-commerce sellers, what is the optimal level of
product information disclosure of two competitive e-commerce sellers in four cases? And
what are their characteristics? What are the consumer surplus and its characteristics after
reaching the optimal level?
2. In the basic model of two competitive e-commerce sellers, what is the nature of the
optimal profits of all parties in different situations? And which situation can achieve the
Nash equilibrium of blockchain applications?
3. If the e-commerce seller has an aversion to risk, how do the degree of risk aversion and
demand fluctuation affect the optimal product information disclosure level and consumer
surplus in the four cases?Will the application of blockchain cause a change in this effect?
4. If the funds of e-commerce sellers are constrained, how does the bank’s loan interest rate
affect the optimal product information disclosure level and consumer surplus in the four
cases? Will the application of blockchain cause a change in this effect?
123
Annals of Operations Research
With the study on the above mentioned research questions, we have the following main
conclusions.
1. If only one seller uses blockchain, when the cost of blockchain application is very small,
consumers’ high trust will drive the high level of the seller’s information disclosure. For
consumer surplus, under different costs of blockchain application, the number of main
bodies of applied blockchain will also have impact on the size of consumer surplus. For
the applied blockchain equilibrium, we give the equilibrium region about the blockchain
cost and the degree of consumer trust.
2. Risk aversion will increase the level of information disclosure and consumer surplus, but
after blockchain application, information disclosure will be in lower level, while it does
not increase consumer surplus.We also find that after blockchain application, its cost will
increase the sensitivity of e-commerce sellers to market demand fluctuations. Both risk
aversion and market volatility will change the equilibrium of the application blockchain.
3. Under the capital constraint, increasing the lending rate of banks will reduce the level of
information disclosure and consumer surplus. If the cost of applying blockchain is very
high, the blockchain application will reduce this impact. If the blockchain is applied, the
cost of the blockchain will change the seller’s sensitivity to the loan interest rate. The
change of bank loan interest rate will change the equilibrium of applied blockchain.
1.3 Contribution and organizational structure
As far as we know, this paper is the first to study the impact of blockchain on the information
disclosure of competitive e-commerce platforms. Combining with the characteristics of the
existing e-commerce sellers, we clarify the sellers’ attitude to the risk aversion and the impact
of blockchain technology under financial constraints. The results are novel and reveal some
crucial insights. This paper builds a foundation for the future research on the game of e-
commerce operation information disclosure by using blockchain, and also provides valuable
management insights for e-commerce operation practice.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews literature related to prod-
uct information disclosure, supply chain competition and blockchain. Section 3 builds four
basic models for two competitive e-commerce sellers, and analyzes the role of blockchain
and the equilibrium conditions of the application blockchain. Section 4 checks the robustness
of the main insights generated by the basic model and analyzes various extended models.
Section 5 discusses other functions and research directions of blockchain in information dis-
closure. Section 6 concludes the paper and indicates its implications for product information
management in e-commerce.
2 Literature review
2.1 Information disclosure
In recent years, information disclosure has been widely concerned, and different types have
been studied. For example, Cao et al. (2020) took quality information as the object, and exam-
ine the impact of voluntary andmandatory information disclosure on the equilibrium strategy,
payment and consumer surplus of manufacturers and retailers. Jeon (2019) and Chondrakis
et al. (2019) have studied technological information disclosure. The former found that in
the case of technological information disclosure, innovators invest in R&D earlier, while the
123
Annals of Operations Research
latter found that increasing technological information disclosure increases M & An activi-
ties. Zhou et al. (2018) studied the impact of information disclosure on lenders’ behavior in
the financial market of crowdfunding supply chain. The results show that additional informa-
tion disclosure can help lenders to make reasonable investment decisions. Cho et al. (2019)
established a game theory model based on two-tier supply chain to study how information
disclosure affects the motivation of enterprises to use different strategies to combat child
labor. With the development of e-commerce, information disclosure often brings some prob-
lems in online sales. Many scholars explore its role in e-commerce through the method of
game. Zhang et al. () established an analytical model to study how intermediaries and sellers
manage consumers’ uncertainty and returns by disclosing product information. Markopoulos
and Hosanagar (2018) introduced a game theory model of the competitive market and found
that the information availability of the third parties makes companies free-rider, especially
low-quality enterprises, who can reduce investment more than high-quality enterprises in
information disclosure. Hu et al. (2020) studied a two-phase model, where the sales volume
of the first phase is disclosed, based on which the customers of the second phase will make
a purchasing decision. The above studies are all focused on disclosing information by the
seller to the consumer, while, there are, of course, also studies by the consumer to the seller
(Feri et al., 2016; Ichihashi, 2020). Our research object is still that the seller to disclose
information to consumers, because generally speaking, sellers are more likely to conceal
information from consumers, so it is more meaningful to explore the role of blockchain
in it. What is closest to our research is the study by Choi et al. (2019a), who established
a duopoly model and analyzed the Nash game of product information disclosure between
product leasing alternative service platforms. Finally, they discussed the role of blockchain,
but they did not bring blockchain into themodel. Our researchmakes up for this shortcoming.
We consider that blockchain will increase consumers’ trust in information, so as to establish
a model based on blockchain and analyze the role of blockchain. Similarly, we mainly focus
on the competitive market, and it is common to explore the issues related to information
disclosure in the competitive market (Clark & Kundu, 2020; Sheth, 2019).
2.2 Competition in supply chains
Nowadays, supply chain management under competition is an attractive topic, and there are
many types of competition in the supply chain, but the most classic is price competition and
output competition. In terms of price competition, Xiao et al. (2014) developed a retailer-
Stackelberg pricing model to study the product types and channel structure strategies of
manufacturers in the annular market. Shavandi et al. () studied the problem of price compe-
tition in multinational supply chains. They focused on manufacturers’ pricing strategies and
unauthorized dealers’ impact on prices, market share and profits. Matsui (2017) considered
the price competition between manufacturers and retailers when studying the dual-channel
supply chain. His biggest innovation is that manufacturers and retailers can choose not only
the price level, but also the pricing timing. In the aspect of output competition, Shao et al.
(2020) considered a purchasing game with opaque cost, described the equilibrium of pur-
chasing game, and studied the influence of different parameters on purchasing strategies and
profit performance. Han & Liu (2020) established an optimization model of high-quality
product supply chain, in which many competing companies adopt the strategy of vertical
integration and must determine the quality level of production and the quantity of production
at each level. In addition, some studies also consider service competition. For example, Pi
et al. (2019) studied pricing and service strategies under retailer competition and cooperation
123
Annals of Operations Research
after considering channel interruption.With the further increasing practical problems and the
further deepening research, the research on supply chain competition also considers capacity
competition (Yang & Hsieh 2021), social responsibility competition (Wang et al., 2020) and
advertising competition (Zhang et al., 2020) and so on. Similar to the above research, our
study also considers the competition between different supply chains, but unlike existing
studies, our research does not consider price competition or output competition. What we are
considering is the competition of the information disclosure level. In contrast, we consider
the competition of information disclosure, which is easier to reflect the role and change of
blockchain in the supply chain (thanks to the insurable modification of blockchain).
2.3 Blockchain application in operations management
Blockchain was originally proposed by Nakamoto (2009). It was born with Bitcoin. This
peer-to-peer distributed ledger has attracted more and more attention. As a kind of informa-
tion and communication technology, blockchain has been largely researched in the computer
field (Ikeda, 2018; Lin & Tang, 2018; Sharma et al., 2018). However, related studies (Babich
& Hilary, 2020; Gomber et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2018; Queiroz et al., 2020) have proved
that blockchain plays an irreplaceable role in improving operation management, especially
in supply chain management (Chang et al., 2020; Helo & Hao, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). In
recent years, blockchain has been paidmore andmore attention in researching operationman-
agement. DeGiovanni (2020) discusses the optimal strategy of the traditional online platform
and blockchain platform through the supply chain gamemodel. Lohmer et al. (2020) used the
simulation method to explore the impact of blockchain on supply chain risk management and
supply chain elasticity. Choi (2019) explored different consumer utility-driven operational
models and emphasizes the value of blockchain technical support platforms in diamond certi-
fication and certification. Choi et al. (2019b) discussed how to apply the mean variance (MV)
method to explore the operational risk of global supply chain and air transportation logistics
in the blockchain era. After that, Choi (2020) thought that blockchain can reduce the financing
cost of enterprises, studies the introduction of revenue-sharing contract again, and explores
the supply chain coordination before and after the use of blockchain through Nash bargaining
model. Yoon et al. (2020) introduced an analytical model considering the implementation of
blockchain in international trade. The results show that under the condition of blockchain, the
delivery time is shortened, and the shipping cost is reduced. Choi et al. (2020) believed that
blockchain helps the platform to accurately assess the proportion of risk-seeking customers,
risk-neutral customers and risk-averse customers. Under the general pricing strategy and the
customized pricing strategy, the significance of customized service pricing strategy mediated
by blockchain technology is obtained through the optimal service price. Considering con-
sumers’ pursuit of traceability, Fan et al. (2020) also introduced a revenue-sharing contract
to achieve the equilibrium of the application blockchain. Similar to the above research, our
research also belongs to the application category of blockchain in operation andmanagement.
However, the difference is that in our consideration blockchain can ensure that information
and data cannot be tampered with. In the traditional information disclosure, the phenomenon
of information fraud is also very common, but because blockchain cannot be tampered with,
we think that the information can be disclosed through blockchain system so that it can be
guaranteed to be true. Obviously, there is no similar research at present. Even Choi et al.
(2019a), which is most similar to our research, did not take into account that blockchain can
guarantee that the information cannot be tampered with.

3 Themodel
3.1 Model description
We consider two e-commerce sellers who sell the same products in the same market. We
define the two sellers as m, and the products they sell as m(m = 1, 2). The products sold by
the two sellers has the same nature. Because the products are sold online, consumers cannot
know the true value of the products, but the consumers’ valuation of the two sellers’ products
is the same but uncertain. With reference to Chen & Chen (2016) and Yang et al. (2017),
we assume that v is uniformly distributed between o and 1. We also consider consumers’
preferences for products. For example, even if they sell the same products, consumers tend
to think that the quality of the products on JD1 is higher than that on Taobao.2 Based on this
point, the sellers on JD have more competitive advantages than the sellers on Taobao. Taking
this into account, we introduce the consumer preference coefficient θm , i.e., the valuation of
the product m purchased by the consumer is θmv. And we assume that seller 1’s product is
more likely to gain consumers’ trust, i.e., θ1 > θ2. This assumption is reflected in competitive
marketing study (Chen & Bell, 2011) and competitive financing study (Yang et al., 2019).
In order to increase the product sales, seller m needs to disclose the product information
to consumers through the e-commerce platform, including product quality, product spec-
ifications, user experience, etc. When consumers receive these kinds of information, they
will know more about the product. For example, in the actual e-commerce market, the seller
will describe the product through gorgeous pictures and personalized words on the plat-
form. Through these methods, consumers know more about the product information, which
undoubtedly leads consumers to arouse their willingness to buy. In reality, it is a pity that
many sellers exaggerate their products toomuch and often post some false information, which
may temporarily increase consumers’ willingness to buy in the short term, but in the long
run, this will often deal a great blow to consumers’ confidence in their products. Therefore,
consumers’ trust in product information has become an issue that sellers need to focus on
in traditional e-commerce, where we assume that consumers’ trust in product information
is λ, and λ ∈ (0, 1). Because blockchain cannot be tampered with, it can be used to ensure
the authenticity of the product information. Under this condition, the information released
by the seller on the platform is so real that the consumer’s recognition of the product can
be guaranteed. We assume that after the blockchain application, consumers’ recognition of
product information is 1. For the e-commerce platform, the increasing information of the
seller will also be a burden, because the e-commerce platform will have to increase the stor-
age space for the relevant data. Although increasing sales through information disclosure will
indirectly enhance the revenue of the platform (because the platform will charge the seller),
considering the cost, the platform will charge for the information disclosed by the seller.
We only consider the unit cost of information disclosure, which is recorded as k. Similarly,
the cost of applying blockchain cannot be ignored. For each information unit disclosed by
the seller, a new block is formed and connected to the previous block. During this period,
power and storage consumption is obvious cost. In addition, the related labor and communi-
cation increase with information disclosure increasing. In this paper, the cost of blockchain
application is defined as unit cost, which is recorded as t .
In addition, we also define the unit sales price of product m as pm , which is exogenous,
and related to the product nature. And we define the unit selling price of the product as cm ,

123

which includes the production cost, transportation cost and so on. To be simple, we make
rm = pm − cm Seller m needs to decide the degree of product disclosure αm and whether
to apply blockchain. If seller 1 applies blockchain, we set i = B; otherwise i = N . If seller
2 applies blockchain, we define j = B; otherwise j = N . We use ϕm to indicate whether
seller m applies blockchain, and define the following formula:
ϕ1 =
{
1 i f i = B
0 i f i = N
, ϕ2 =
{
1 i f j = B
0 i f j = N
The utility gained by consumers in purchasing products is Um . For comparison, we also
assume the situationwhere the seller has no information disclosure. In order to distinguish the
consumer utility with or without information disclosure, we assume that the consumer utility
without information disclosure is Um−N I D , while the consumer utility with information
disclosure is Um−P I D .
3.2 Consumer’s choice
First of all, we analyze the consumer utility when there is no information disclosure. Under
the premise that the consumer’s product valuation is v, the product utility m is Um−N I D =
θmv − pm . If we consider that there is only a single seller in the market, then only when
Um−N I D > 0, i.e., v >
pm
θm
, the consumer will buy the product. We can get the product
demand m at this time is dm = ∫ 1
pm
θm
dv = 1 − pm
θm
.
In order to make our research more rigorous, we assume that seller 1 has an advantage
over seller 2 in the e-commerce market, so we add the following assumptions.
(1) When the product information is not disclosed by the e-commerce seller, and the con-
sumer values product 1 and product 2, v = 1, U1−N I D > U2−N I D , i.e., θ1 − p1 >
θ2 − p2.
(2) In a single market without information disclosure, d1 = 1 − p1
θ1
> d2 = 1 − p2
θ2
.
(3) In the absence of information disclosure, the unit sales profit of e-commerce 1 is larger
than that of e-commerce 2, i.e., p1 − c1 > p2 − c2.
The hypothesis (1) shows that when the consumer has the information about the product,
the consumer is more inclined to product 1, and the consumer only buys product 1 but not
product 2. In hypothesis (2), the basic market capacity of product 1 is larger than that of
product 2. In hypothesis (3), seller 1 is easier to get higher profits than seller 2.
In the market with information disclosure, under the condition that the consumer’s prod-
uct valuation is v, the seller’s information disclosure level will increase the consumer utility
after purchasing goods. What needs to know is that when there is no blockchain applica-
tion, the consumers’ trust degree in the information disclosure is not high enough, and for
each additional information disclosure unit, consumers only get an increase in the utility of
λ(λ ∈ (0, 1)), while after the application of blockchain, a unit of utility will be increased for
consumers. Therefore, the utility that consumers get after purchasing productm is as follows:
Um−P I D = θmv + (ϕm + (1 − ϕm)λ)αm − pm + εm,
where εm is a random variable with symmetrical distribution, and E(εm) = μm ,
V ar(εm) = σ 2
m . The correlation coefficient between ε1 and ε2 is ρ. εm is used to reflect
the uncertainty of the utility of consumers after buying products. If εm is very large, con-
sumers will be more willing to buy enough products; otherwise, consumers will have little
willingness. This reflects the uncertainty of the market faced by sellers indirectly.
123
Annals of Operations Research
In order to explore consumers’ willingness to buy, we make it possible for Um = 0 to get
vm = pm − (ϕm + (1 − ϕm)λ)λαm − εm
θm
Only when Um > 0 (i.e., when the consumer’s valuation of the product m, v > vm), the
consumer will buy product m.
In order to explore consumers’ choice between two products, we further makeU1−P I D =
U2−P I D , the boundary of consumer valuation worthwhile:
v21 = p1 − p2 + (ϕ1 + (1 − ϕ1)λ)α1 − (ϕ2 + (1 − ϕ2)λ)α2 − ε1 + ε2
θ1 − θ2
It is obvious that v21 > vm . The above formula shows that when U1−P I D > U2−P I D ,
i.e., v > v21, consumers will buy product 1 instead of product 2, as shown in Fig. 2. But
when U1−P I D < U2−P I D and U2−P I D > 0, i.e., v < v21 and v > v2, consumers will buy
product 2 instead of product 1. As shown in Fig. 2, v2 < v1 < v21 < 1, so when v > v21,
v > v1 is bound to be established, there is no conflict between the market of product 1 and
the market of product 2.
Therefore, when we do the integral, we get D1 = ∫ 1
v21
dv = 1− v21 and D2 = ∫ v21
v2
dv =
v21 − v2, and when we expand, we get:
D1 = 1 − p1 − p2 + (ϕ1 + (1 − ϕ1)λ)α1 − (ϕ2 + (1 − ϕ2)λ)α2
θ1 − θ2
+ ξ1
D2 = p1 − p2 + (ϕ1 + (1 − ϕ1)λ)α1 − (ϕ2 + (1 − ϕ2)λ)α2

where ξ1 = ε1−ε2

3.3 Analysis
In the basic model, if seller m applies blockchain, i.e., ϕm = 1, then each unit of information
disclosure will have to pay more t cost; otherwise, each unit of information disclosure will
only have to pay k cost. Therefore, we can get that the cost of information disclosure of seller
m is lm = (k + ϕmt)αm − PC M . In addition to the cost of information disclosure, we need
to take into account the cost of selling products, so the analysis shows that the expected profit
function of seller m is:
m−P I D = (pm − cm − lm)E(Dm − PC M)
We define Z1 = −θ1(2θ1−θ2)d1+θ1θ2d2
(4θ1−θ2)
and Z2 = −θ2(2θ1−θ2)d2+θ1θ2d1

, which are the disclo-
sure level of seller 1 and seller 2 in the basicmarket, respectively.According to our hypothesis,
we can find Zm < 0. And, obviously, Zm is the decreasing function of dm and the increasing
function of dm− , i.e., if the basic market demand of seller m is very large, his information
disclosure level in the basic market will be even smaller. On the contrary, if the basic market
demand of the other party is very large, seller m will increase the amount of information
disclosure, which reflects that the basic market demand will increase the competitiveness of
information disclosure between the two sides. Since dm is the decreasing function of pm , we
can get that Zm is the increasing function of pm and the decreasing function of pm− . Based
on the above analysis, we further solve the optimal level of information disclosure, and we
can get four cases according to whether seller 1 and seller 2 apply blockchain. In the four
cases, their optimal information disclosure level is shown in Table 2.

(1) In the competitive product information disclosure market, there is a unique Nash equi-
librium under different blockchain application scenarios. The level of balanced product
information disclosure for product 1 and product 2 is shown in Table 1.

From proposition 1 (1), we can get the optimal returns of both parties in different
blockchain application scenarios, as shown in “Appendix A.1”. It can be seen from propo-
sition 1 (2) that as long as one party does not apply blockchain, the optimal information
disclosure level of seller m is correlated with the consumer trust degree λ. When competitors
do not apply blockchain, the greater the trust of consumers in the information, the greater the
level of information disclosure of seller m. This is because when consumers have more trust
in information, consumers are more willing to buy products, which leads to a larger poten-
tial market for any seller. What needs to be distinguished is that if seller m does not apply
blockchain, the consumer’s trust in information λ only affects the sensitivity of the optimal
level of information disclosure to the underlying market. But if seller m applies blockchain
alone at this time, λ only affects the sensitivity of the optimal level of information disclosure
to the unit income of competitors.
Proposition 1 (3) shows that when k and t are large, the information disclosed by seller m
will decrease accordingly, because the larger k and t , the higher the marginal cost of prod-
uct information disclosure. Proposition (2c) shows that only when the competitor applies
blockchain, and t is small, the information disclosed by seller m will increase with the
increase of λ. Combining with the conclusion of (3), we can think that when t is relatively
small and λ is relatively large, competitors will increase the level of information disclosure.
Therefore, in order to balance their own income, seller m will increase the level of infor-
mation disclosure. In addition, it also explores the nature of consumer surplus from product
information disclosure. Proposition 1 (4) shows that for either party, as long as blockchain
is used, the volume of information disclosure will be reduced. With the previous analysis, it
also shows that the seller is more sensitive to the cost of blockchain.
In addition, we also want to explore the impact of product information disclosure game
on consumer surplus. We use C Sm to represent the consumer surplus after the product infor-
mation disclosure of seller m to the consumer (i.e., the user). We use C S∗
m to represent the
consumer surplus at equilibrium. When there is no information disclosure, the consumer
surplus is:
C Sm−N =
∫ ∞
pm
θm
(θmv − pm) f (v)dv
When the information is disclosed, the consumer surplus is as follows:
C Sm−P I D =
∫ ∞
pm−(ϕm+(1−ϕm )λ)αm
θm
−
(θmv + (ϕm + (1 − ϕm )λ)αm − pm ) f (v)dv
=
∫ pm
θm
pm−(ϕm+(1−ϕm )λ)αm
θm
(θmv − pm ) f (v)dv +
∫ ∞
pm−(ϕm+(1−ϕm )λ)αm
θm
(ϕm + (1 − ϕm )λ)αm f (v)dv + C Sm−N
It can be seen that the consumer surplus obtained by seller m through information disclo-
sure is:
δC Sm = C Sm−P I D − C Sm−N = �m[�m + dm]
where �m = (ϕm + (1 − ϕm)λ)αm .
In order to explore the properties of C Si j∗
m , we get Lemma 1.
Lemma 1 For any iand j , C Si j∗
m is an increasing function of �∗
mi j and dm.
Lemma 1 states that whether blockchain is applied or not, seller m will increase consumer
surplus through information disclosure, and the greater the basic market demand, the more it
will increase. In addition, consumer surplus is also related to the blockchain application, and
123
Annals of Operations Research
at the same level of information disclosure, after the application of blockchain, consumer
surplus will become smaller.
Observing Lemma 1, we can find that the consumer surplus of seller m is only related to
�m , so we get the optimal �
i j
m−PC M
∗ according to Proposition 1, as shown in “Appendix
A.1”. Comparing their relationship, we can get Proposition 2.
Proposition 2

m−PC M

information disclosure of product m has the following relationship: When

(4) Proposition 2 (1) states that as long as one party in the competitive market does not use
blockchain, the consumer surplus of seller m is related to λ. When λ is relatively large,
consumers can obtain higher consumer surplus from information disclosure. With the
conclusion of Lemma 1, it is also easy to obtain the expression with the most consumer
surplus, so we can also explore whether λ has an effect on consumer surplus after the
blockchain application. By further derivation, it is found that
dC Si j
m−PC M
∗
dλ
has nothing
to do with t , but the sensitivity of the consumer surplus of seller m to λ is positively
correlated with the unit sales income of competitors. Proposition 2(2) states that with
the high cost of information disclosure, the consumer surplus will be lower, because the
seller will reduce the volume of information disclosure.
Proposition 2 (3) compares consumer surplus in four cases, and also illustrates two prob-
lems: (1) when t is very high, the consumer surplus with applying blockchain will be very
low, and as long as one party applies blockchain, it will reduce consumer surplus; (2) with the
increase of sellerswho apply blockchain, the consumer surplus of either sidewill decrease. Of
course, if the cost of quoting blockchain is relatively low, the conclusion is just the oppo-
site. Proposition 2 (3) just shows that the consumer surplus is still very sensitive to the
blockchain application cost.
FromProposition 1 (1),we can get the optimal returns of both parties in different situations,
compare their benefits, and we can get the scenario of the seller applying blockchain. The
specific results are represented by Proposition 3.

Proposition 3 (1) shows that when seller m applies blockchain, his competitors apply
blockchain to his optimal return. When seller m applies blockchain, if t is relatively large
or λ is relatively small, his competitors’ blockchain application will increase their revenue;
otherwise, his competitors will reduce their income if they apply blockchain, which also
reflects that competitors’ blockchain application alone will promote the transfer of competi-
tors’ income to their own side.
Proposition 3(2) shows thatwhen sellerm does not apply blockchain, his competitors apply
blockchain to his income; when seller m does not use blockchain, regardless of the size of t
and λ, the competitors’ use of blockchain will reduce their revenue, because if seller m does
not apply blockchain, while the competitor applies blockchain, consumers will rely more on
the competitors’ products, and the market demand will shift to the competitors. However, we
must also pay attention to the influence of t . Theoretically, although seller m loses consumer
information when he/she does not apply blockchain, it also avoids the cost of applying
blockchain. Proposition 3 (2) fully shows that in this case, competitors using blockchain will
make themselves at a disadvantage.
We regard the situation in which neither of the two perfectly competitive sellers should
use blockchain or both apply blockchain as the complete equilibrium of blockchain appli-
cation. Proposition 3(3) gives the condition of complete equilibrium for the blockchain
application. We can find that only when their own unit return is very large, and the com-
petitor’s profit is very small, the two sellers will apply blockchain. But it should be noted
that the competitor’s unit return also determines the complete equilibrium. If for seller m
the competitor’s income is very small, then

fore, whether complete equilibrium exists depends on the relationship between the relative
unit income of seller m and his competitors, and λ and t . Specifically, we have carried out
the following analyses.
In order to further analyze the results of the equilibrium, we make θ1 = 0.9, p1 = 0.6,
c1 = 0.2, θ2 = 0.6, p2 = 0.4, c2 = 0.1, k = 0.3, and then we can get the relationship
between λ and t as shown in Fig. 3.

No matter what λ is, when t is very small, i.e., in region VI in Fig. 3, the two sellers in the
perfectly competitive market achieve a complete equilibrium of the game, i.e., (ϕ1, ϕ2) =
(1, 1), which is easy to understand, because when t is very small, the advantages of applying
blockchain outweigh the disadvantages. However, the value of t in area I in Fig. 3 is relatively

large, and the application blockchain will increase the burden on the seller. At the moment,
we need to pay attention to λ, λ in region I is relatively small, and consumers’ trust in product
information is relatively low. From this point of view, both sides need blockchain to increase
consumer confidence, so it is reasonable to achieve complete equilibrium, i.e., (ϕ1, ϕ2) =
(1, 1), in region I. When t is small, and λ is large, i.e., in region V of Fig. 3, the two sellers in
the perfectly competitive market achieve a complete equilibrium of the game, i.e., (ϕ1, ϕ2) =
(0, 0), which shows that when L is relatively large, consumers have a certain degree of trust
in product information, and thus it is no longer necessary to apply blockchain. However, for
region II in Fig. 3, λ is very small, and this region has little relationship with t . Both sides
in this region show that the competition between the two sides is more likely to achieve
complete equilibrium. In addition, the value of t and λ in region III in Fig. 3 are larger than
those of region IV, but in both regions, t
λ
is relatively small. Therefore, we can find that the
equilibrium of these two regions is the result of the game between the two sellers.
4 Extendedmodels
4.1 Considering the risk aversion behavior of E-commerce sellers
In the actual operation of the e-commerce supply chain, the risk sources are extensive, but the
uncertainty of the utility obtained by consumers after purchasing products is the main source
of the market risk. For example, in the electronic products industry, due to the instability
of the product itself (not caused by quality), the feeling of using the product is different;
thus, the utility of consumers after buying this kind of products is full of great uncertainty.
In the clothing industry and the jewelry industry, consumers’ feeling of using them depends
not only on the nature of the products themselves, but also on the comparison with others,
which will further lead to the uncertainty of the utility of the products after purchasing.
Therefore, for many products, the market risk caused by the consumers’ utility uncertainty is
123
Annals of Operations Research
also an issue that e-commerce supply chain decision-makers should pay attention to. In the
competitive environment, when considering the application of blockchain, what impact the
e-commerce sellers’ risk aversion attitude will have on the optimal decision will be a problem
worth discussing. Under the premise of considering the blockchain decision-making, we will
explore its changes in the four situations when the e-commerce seller evades the risk, and
whether the blockchain will affect the risk aversion seller’s response. We also analyze the
conditions for the application of blockchain equilibrium in e-commerce sellers. In this part,
we choose to use the mean–variance model to describe the seller’s risk.
From our basic model, we can find that the risk of seller m only comes from the market
demand, so we can easily get the variance of seller m’s income as follows:
V ar(
m−P I D) = (pm − cm − (k + ϕmt)αm−P I D)2V ar(ξm)
When seller m is risk-averse, the utility function of seller m is:
Um−R A = E(
m−P I D) − δm
√
V ar(
m−P I D),
where δm is the risk aversion coefficient of seller m. δm=0 shows that seller m is risk-
neutral, and δm > 0 shows that seller m is strictly risk-averse. It is easy to see that Um−R A is
a strictly concave function of αm−R A, from which we can get Proposition 4.

Proposition 4 For the case of risk aversion, the game is super modular and has a unique
Nash equilibrium. The level of balanced product information disclosure of products 1 and 2
is as follows.

andU Am are the residual information disclosure of risk aversion before and after the
blockchain application by seller m respectively. From (1) of Proposition 4, we first observe
that the optimal product information disclosure level in the case of risk aversion is higher
than that in the case of risk neutral, because U Am is always positive. If sellers are not willing
to take risk, they will improve the level of product information disclosure, which is also
confirmed in (2) of Proposition 4. The higher the degree of risk aversion of sellers, the higher
the level of product information disclosure, not only for their own products, but also for the
products of competitive platforms. From (1) and (2) of Proposition 4, it can be further found
that under the condition of risk aversion of e-commerce sellers, the increased information
disclosure level of e-commerce sellers has nothing to do with t application blockchain. This
also shows that the cost of applying blockchain cannot affect e-commerce sellers’ response to
market uncertainty. Further analysis can find that when e-commerce sellers have awareness of
risk aversion, the increased level of information disclosure with blockchain application will
be smaller than that without blockchain application. Similarly, Proposition 4 (3) emphasizes
123
Annals of Operations Research
the impact of demand fluctuations, similar to the degree of risk aversion, because they are
both risk-related.
As proved in (3) and (4) of Proposition 4, the higher the level of product information
disclosure, not only for their own products, but also for the products of competitive platforms.
But it should be noted that C Si j

added value of the seller’s risk aversion has nothing to do with whether to apply blockchain.
From the conclusion of (1) of Proposition 4, we can conclude the optimal utility of each
party in the seller’s risk aversion, as shown in “Appendix A.4”. Obviously, the utility of
sellers is related to the degree of risk aversion and the demand fluctuation. According to the
previous analysis, as long as one party applies blockchain, the utility of both parties will be
related to t . Next, we want to explore whether t will affect the sensitivity of the optimal utility
to the degree of risk aversion and the demand fluctuation. Proposition 5 can be obtained by
analyzing this.
Proposition 5 There is threshold U A
i j
m and threshold U Ai j
m respectively, as shown in Table
3, which makes the following conclusion true.
(1) For any i, junequal to Nat the same time, when 0 < U Am ≤ U A

BecauseU Am is an increasing function of the degree of risk aversion and demand fluctua-
tion of seller m and its competitors, we analyze the impact ofU Am onUi j∗
m to further explore
the impact of risk aversion and demand fluctuation on the optimal utility. It should be noted
that the reason why we order 0 < U Am < U A
i j
m is to ensure that even under the condition of
risk aversion, the market demand of seller m is non-negative, because if the market demand
of seller m is negative, for a completely rational seller, he/she will definitely withdraw from
the market. Proposition 5 (1) shows that if the seller is not willing to bear too many risks,
then the utility he/she obtains through information disclosure is not high. Similarly, if there
is a large uncertainty of utility (i.e., the demand fluctuation) after the consumer purchases
his product, his utility will be reduced, and the impact on his competitors will be the same.
We use
∣∣∣∣ dUi j∗
m
dU Am
∣∣∣∣ to express to what extent U Am affects Ui j∗
m . Proposition 5 (2) shows the
influence change of U Am on Ui j∗
m with the change of t . We find that if U Am is very small,
and t is large, U Am will have a greater influence on Ui j∗
m , and if U Am is particularly large,
and t is larger, U Am will have smaller influence on Ui j∗
m . This shows that if any party, seller
m or his competitors, applies blockchain, the seller’s ability to withstand risk is in a larger
range, and the high cost of blockchain application will make the seller more sensitive to the
market demand fluctuation. However, when seller m’s ability to bear the risk is in a relatively
small range, a higher blockchain application cost means a less sensitivity for the seller m to
the market demand fluctuation.

The conclusions of Proposition 6 (1) and (2) are the same as those of Proposition 3 (1)
and (2), which shows that even under the condition of the seller’s risk aversion, when their
own blockchain decision is determined, there is no change for the competitor’s decision to
apply blockchain. However, when the seller is risk-averse, the complete equilibrium of the
applied blockchain has changed, as illustrated in Proposition 6 (3). As mentioned in (3) of
Proposition 3, when t is relatively large, the unit sales income of seller m and his competitors
need to meet

6 (3) expresses that when t is relatively large, the unit income of both sides needs to satisfy

, and because U Am is always greater than 0, it can be
found that when seller m is risk-averse, seller m needs a high unit income in order to achieve
the complete equilibrium of blockchain applied by both sides. And if any seller is unwilling
to take risks, or anyone’s demand is too volatile, the great unit return is required to achieve
such an equilibrium. Because the unit income we analyzed is relative, based on the above
analysis, we can think that the risk tolerance of any seller is too low or the demand fluctuation
is too large, it is not easy to achieve the complete equilibrium of the application blockchain.
When seller m is risk-averse, the game equilibrium of blockchain application is the same
as that mentioned in Proposition 1. In order to explore the impact of risk aversion on this
equilibrium, we further assign values to get the results shown in Fig. 4. Obviously, we can
see Fig. 4 that with the increase of risk aversion coefficient, the area of region I and region
II decrease obviously, while the area of other regions increases obviously.
As described in the analysis of proposition 1, precisely because of consumers’ low trust
in information, both parties apply blockchain in region I. However, we can see in Fig. 4
that with the increase of risk aversion coefficient, region I gradually decreases to the upper
left corner, i.e., the complete equilibrium of using blockchain will be achieved only when
consumers have lower trust in information. Similarly, region II gradually decreases to the
left, but with the analysis of proposition 1, the equilibrium result of region II comes from
the competition between the two sides. Therefore we can think that with the increase of risk
aversion coefficient, the competition between the two sides of region II becomes greater.

4.2 Capital constraints of E-commerce sellers
E-commerce platform provides convenience for a large number of small- and medium-sized
enterprises so that more individuals can run a store without physical facade. Therefore, the
development of e-commerce platform has created more and more enterprises. However, due
to the low threshold of e-commerce, more and more e-commerce sellers are small- and
medium-sized enterprises, which are characterized by the insufficient funds. The scale of
small- and medium-sized e-commerce enterprises is small, the financial system is irregular,
and the branch does not make its capital flow even more optimistic at night, which is often
the main reason that hinders the further development of these enterprises. In the case of
bank financing, these small- and medium-sized e-commerce enterprises can get funds to
support their operations in the short term, but the cost of capital brought about by loans
brings operating pressure. In the application of blockchain, these enterprises will further
increase their cost, but considering that blockchain can indirectly increase product sales, so
comprehensively considering the shortage of funds, the application of blockchain is an issue
of concern. In this part, we pay attention to the e-commerce sellers with capital constraints.
On the basis of considering bank loans, we explore the changes of optimal decision-making in
four scenarios, and we can also study the influence of blockchain on the e-commerce sellers’
response to bank loan interest rates. Finally, the decision equilibrium of applied blockchain
is analyzed.
We use N SC to denote the scenario of financial constraints. We use Bm to represent the
initial capital of seller m. Usually, financial constraint refers to that the seller’s initial capital
is insufficient to support the sales cost, i.e., Bm < (cm + (k + ϕmt)αm−N SC , but in order to
simplify our model, we order Bm=0. In order to obtain funds, e-commerce sellers need to
borrow money from the bank. We use E to represent the interest rate of the bank loan, and
we do not consider the capital cost of the bank. To sum up, we can get the return function of
both parties when the financial constraints of e-commerce sellers are as follows:
m−N SC = (pm − (cm + (k + ϕmt)αm−N SC )(1 + η))E(Dm−N SC )
According to the above formula, we can get Table 4 by solving the optimal level of
information disclosure under financial constraints.
Proposition 7
(1) When e-commerce sellers lack start-up funds, there is a unique Nash equilibrium in
different blockchain application scenarios. The balanced product information disclosure
level of product 1 and product 2 is shown in Table 2.

From (1) of Proposition 7, we first observe that the optimal product information disclosure
level under capital constraint is lower than that under risk neutral condition. If the loan
interest rate of banks is very high, our results prove that sellers will reduce the product
information disclosure level. Correspondingly, consumer surplus will also decrease. This is
also confirmed in (2) of Proposition 7. The higher the loan interest rate of a bank, the lower the
product information disclosure level, not only for its own products, but also for the products
of competitive platforms.
Proposition 7 (3) shows that under the condition of capital constraint, the optimal prod-
uct information disclosure level will be lower than that without capital constraint, and the
consumer surplus will also be lower. Proposition 7(3) compares the optimal level of prod-
uct information disclosure and consumer surplus under insufficient funds and that under
sufficient funds in the blockchain application. In this way we can also see the impact of
blockchain on the level of product information disclosure and consumer surplus under cap-
ital constraints. First of all, we can see that when it is relatively large, we can get that for
any party, the decreased amount of product information disclosure when blockchain is not
applied is more than when blockchain is applied, and the more the sellers who do not apply
blockchain, the more the information disclosure reduced. This shows that if the cost of apply-
ing blockchain is relatively high, blockchain will reduce the impact of capital constraints on
product information disclosure. By analogy, when it is relatively small, the corresponding
conclusion should be opposite. However, what is more interesting is that if it is relatively
small, for any seller, the information disclosure is in the largest reduction when he/she does
not apply blockchain and his competitors apply blockchain, while information disclosure is
in the smallest reduction when he/she applies blockchain and his competitors do not apply
blockchain.
(b) in (3) of Proposition 7 gives the comparison of the reduction of consumer surplus under
capital constraints. We find that when t is relatively large, for any party, the consumer surplus
reduction without blockchain application is more than that with blockchain application, and
123
Annals of Operations Research
themore the sellers without blockchain application, themore the consumer surplus reduction.
This shows that if the cost of applying blockchain is relatively high, blockchain will reduce
the impact of capital constraints on consumer surplus. Of course, when t is small, we get
the opposite conclusion. This shows that the impact of blockchain on consumer surplus is
mainly related to t .
Now, although information disclosure will increase the market demand, the situation will
be more complicated in the case of capital constraints. From the conclusion of Proposition 7,
we can easily find that when α
i j∗
m−N SC is large enough,αi j∗
m−N SC will continue to decrease until
it becomes 0. Therefore, in the case of financial constraints on sellers, should the platform
not disclose any product information? According to the conclusion of Proposition 7, we can
get Corollary 2, providing answers to the question. We define threshold η
i j
m as shown in
“Appendix”. In particular, when only one seller applies blockchain, in order to distinguish
which seller applies blockchain, we need to make the following explanation: if m=1, η
i j
m
means ηN B
1 ; if m= 2, ηi j
m means ηB N
2 .
Corollary 2 For m = 1, 2and i = N , B, j = N , B, if η ≥ η
i j
m , then α
i j∗
m−N SC=0, and if
η < η
i j
m then α
i j∗
m−N SC > 0.
Corollary 2 shows that when the bank’s loan interest rate exceeds a certain critical value,
seller m’s optimal decision is not to disclose any information. Through our model, we can
easily understand, because if the bank’s loan interest rate is too high, the cost of information
disclosure will be very large. If it exceeds the seller’s affordability, the seller’s further infor-
mation disclosure will increase the market demand. But from the perspective of income, it
is not worth the loss.
In order to get more insight, we analyzed the sensitivity of the critical threshold. The
results are summarized in Table 5.
When the basic market demand of seller m is relatively large, the bank loan interest rate
that seller a can bear will be lower, and if the basic market demand of his competitors is
relatively large, the bank loan interest rate that seller m can bear will be higher. In other
words, if their own basic market demand is greater, there is no need to make efforts to expand
the market through information disclosure. Of course, if the competitor’s basic market is
large, seller m needs to seize the competitor’s market through information disclosure. If the
price of their own products is relatively high, the loan interest rate of affordable banks will be
higher, because the income of products can offset the increase of costs. From the point of view
of consumers’ trust in information, it is natural that the greater the degree of trust, the higher
interest rates seller m can bear, which is the same for himself and his competitor. In general,
any cost (including sales cost, information disclosure cost and blockchain application cost) is
not conducive to any seller, and any cost is too large to make two sellers be in less information
disclosure level.

From the conclusion of Proposition 7 (1), we can conclude that the optimal returns of
both parties under the seller’s financial constraints are shown in “Appendix A.4”. Obviously,
the seller’s best return is related to the bank’s lending rate. Similarly, in the case of financial
constraints, as long as one party applies blockchain, the income of both parties will be related
to t . Next, we want to explore whether t will affect the sensitivity of the optimal return to the
bank loan interest rate. Proposition 8 can be obtained.
Proposition 8 When the e-commerce seller does not have the start-up capital, and if he/she
borrows money from the bank:

Proposition 8 (1) states that under financial constraints, the higher the bank’s loan interest
rate, the smaller the seller’s income, because if the bank’s loan interest rate is very high, all
the seller’s cost will become higher, which will reduce the seller’s income.
We use
∣∣∣d
i j∗

/
dη
∣∣∣ to express the influence of η on 
i j∗
m−N SC . Proposition 8 (2)
illustrates the influence of η on 
i j∗
m−N SC changes with t . We found that if any seller uses
blockchain, t affects the influence of η on 
i j∗
m−N SC . If t is larger, the influence of η on
i j∗
m−N SC will be smaller. Combining with (1) we can see that if t is larger, then 
i j∗
m−N SC
will decrease more slowly with the increase of η. This phenomenon means that if a seller
applies blockchain, the two sellers’ ability to bear the bank loan interest rate increases.
FromProposition 7 (1),we can get the optimal returns of both parties in different situations,
we compare the benefits of all parties, and we can get the scenario of seller an applying
blockchain. The specific results are represented by Proposition 9.

The conclusions of (1) and (2) of Proposition 9 are the same as those of Proposition
3, that is, even under the financial constraints of sellers, when they make blockchain deci-
sions, competitors’ decisions on the application of blockchain have no change in their own
income. However, in the case of financial constraints, the complete equilibrium of the seller’s
application blockchain has changed, as illustrated in Proposition 9 (3). There are still many
similarities between Proposition 9 (3) and Proposition 6 (3), because 1 + η > 1. Under the
financial constraints of seller m, the unit income of seller m needs to reach a larger value in
order to achieve the complete equilibrium of blockchain applied by both sides. Moreover, if
the bank’s lending rate is too high, a great unit income needed to achieve such equilibrium.

Fig. 5 Region of equilibrium for the application of blockchain under different interest rates
Therefore, we can think that the higher the loan interest rate of the bank, the more difficult
it is to achieve the complete equilibrium of the application blockchain.
When the seller is risk-averse, the game equilibrium of blockchain application is the same
as that mentioned in Proposition 1. In order to explore the impact of bank lending rates on the
overall equilibrium, we further assign values to get the results shown in Fig. 5. Obviously,
when the loan interest rate of the bank increases gradually, the area of region VI and region
V decrease obviously, while the area other regions increase obviously.
5 Further analysis
The research and analyses in Sects. 3 and 4 are based on the fact that blockchain can ensure the
information authenticity. But in practical application, the role of blockchain in information
disclosure is far more beyond. In this part, according to the characteristics of blockchain,
we focus on the significance that blockchain can contribute to e-commerce information
disclosure.
5.1 Reducing�1 and�2
For a new market, e-commerce sellers will investigate and predict consumers’ willingness
to buy in advance, generally based on historical data or market data, no matter whether the
data are distorted or unreliable. These distorted or unreliable data will lead to inaccurate
predictions. The two blocks cannot be tampered with, and the traceability can increase the
reliability. Transferring the required data through blockchain can ensure that the data will
not be distorted in the process of transmission, and can also ensure that the data will not
be tampered with. On the other hand, the traceability of blockchain can trace the source of
the data, and further investigation of the historical data on the upper chain can further test
its authenticity and reliability. Based on more accurate data, e-commerce sellers can predict
market demand more accurately, so the application of blockchain can reduce σ1 and σ2.
Theorem 2 If blockchain is applied to predict consumers’ willingness to buy, when e-
commerce sellers avoid risk, compared with those not applying blockchain,
(1) E-commerce sellers will reduce their information disclosure level after applying
blockchain. At the same time, it will also reduce the competitors’ information disclosure
level.
(2) It will also reduce the expected consumer surplus when consumers buy any product.
123
Annals of Operations Research
(3) E-commerce sellers always make a profit for their competitors after using blockchain.
Theorem2 shows that if e-commerce sellers use blockchain to predict consumers’ purchas-
ing intention, the market demand risk will be greatly reduced. For this reason, e-commerce
sellers will not respond to the uncertain market to some extent. Meanwhile, the blockchain
application by e-commerce sellers will not only have an impact on themselves, but also
have an impact on their competitors. Even when competitors do not use blockchain to make
predictions (the competitor’s market risk is still high), competitors’ response tomarket uncer-
tainty will be reduced accordingly. For consumers, e-commerce sellers applying blockchain
are disadvantageous to consumers, because the lower information disclosure level after the
blockchain application will reduce the utility of consumers in purchasing products. If e-
commerce sellers adopt blockchain, whether they can make a profit depends on the cost.
But their competitors can reduce the market uncertainty without paying any price, so for any
e-commerce seller, they want their competitors to adopt blockchain.
5.2 Reducing�
In fact, after receiving the loan request from the e-commerce seller, the bank will make
relevant investigation. In order to get more loans, e-commerce sellers (especially some small
e-commerce sellers) will package and fake their own information, resulting in that banks will
spend more on fertilizer to check the authenticity of the information. If banks do not consider
the amount of lending, banks will increase interest rates accordingly. However, blockchain
can reduce information fraud to certain extent. If e-commerce sellers use blockchain, they
will not continue to package their own information, because (1) the cost of counterfeiting is
very high under the condition that blockchain is not allowed to be tampered with; (2) banks
can also track the real information. For example, the loss of e-commerce sellers will outweigh
the gain if they continue to counterfeit after using blockchain. In this way, the bank will not
have to spend more to check the information authenticity, and the corresponding η will be
reduced.
We assume that after the e-commerce seller applies the blockchain, the loan interest rate
given by the bank is η
′
, and η
′
< η. Further analysis can get Theorem 3.
Theorem 3 When e-commerce sellers lack start-up capital, if e-commerce sellers use
blockchain to reduce bank loan interest rates, compared with those not using blockchain,
when
(
pm(
1+η
′) − cm
)/(
pm
(1+η)
− cm
)
> k+t
k , e-commerce sellers will increase the infor-
mation disclosure, and consumer surplus will also increase. Its competitors will certainly
increase the information disclosure, and the consumer surplus of competitors’ products will
also increase. E-commerce sellers always make a profit for their competitors after using
blockchain.
As can be seen in Theorem 3, although the blockchain application can reduce e-commerce
sellers’ pressure on loans, this will indirectly lead e-commerce sellers to increase the infor-
mation disclosure. However, considering that e-commerce sellers have to bear the cost after
applying blockchain, if e-commerce sellers use blockchain to reduce bank loan interest rates,
whether e-commerce sellers will increase the information disclosure depends on the cost of
the application blockchain and the loan interest rate offered by the bank. If the loan inter-
est rate given by banks after the applying blockchain is small enough, e-commerce sellers
will naturally increase the information disclosure. At the same time, we should also note
123
Annals of Operations Research
that the key factors that determine whether the information disclosure of e-commerce sell-
ers increases or not are the sales price and the production cost. In addition, similar to the
conclusion drawn from Theorem 2, after e-commerce sellers apply blockchain, their com-
petitors can also indirectly reduce loan costs, and the benefits gained by their competitors
are cost-free. Therefore, its competitors can also make a great profit.
5.3 Increasing�1 and�2
As seen in Sects. 5.1 and 5.2, blockchain can avoid information fraud to a certain extent,which
can indirectly reduce consumers’ worries. As consumers gradually understand blockchain,
consumers will think that the product that uses blockchain is a "high-quality product".
Blockchain is gradually favored by people because of its high reliability. If blockchain is
used in the process of product information disclosure, it will also increase consumers’ sense
of product identity. Accordingly, θ1 and θ2 will increase.
Theorem 4 If e-commerce sellers use blockchain to increase consumers’ preference for
products, after e-commerce sellers use blockchain, their competitors will disclose more infor-
mation, and the consumer surplus of buying competitors’ products will also increase. At the
same time, if only the e-commerce seller 1 applies blockchain, then the e-commerce seller 1
will have a greater advantage. But only the e-commerce seller 2 applies blockchain, the gap
between the two sides will narrow, and the competition between the two sellers to disclose
information will be fiercer.
Theorem 4 shows that if e-commerce sellers apply blockchain, they will make themselves
more competitive (from consumers’ preferences), which blows their competitors. So, their
competitors will increase the information disclosure to obtain the consumers’ favor, so as
to obtain more market demand. What we study is a market composed of e-commerce sell-
ers with competitive advantages and e-commerce sellers with competitive disadvantages, so
sellers with competitive advantages will naturally continue to increase their advantages after
applying blockchain. Sellers with competitive disadvantages will continue to increase their
information disclosure, whichmay lead to high cost, so it is quite disadvantageous to competi-
tive inferior sellers. However, if the party with competitive disadvantages applies blockchain,
it will narrow the competitive gap. If the two sides want to expand demand, they can only
continuously increase the information disclosure, which leads to further competition.
6 Conclusions
Blockchain can ensure the validity and authenticity of information transmission in e-
commerce supply chain. On the basis of fully considering the competitive relationship in
e-commercemarket (such as the competition between JD andTaobao),we regard the informa-
tion disclosure as the competitive decision of two e-commerce sellers, and divide e-commerce
sellers’ decision-making into four research scenarios (neither of the two e-commerce sellers
should use the blockchain, and the e-commerce seller applies the blockchain, e-commerce
seller 2 applies blockchain, and both e-commerce sellers use blockchain). After solving the
equilibrium results, the influence of blockchain is analyzed from the e-commerce sellers’ and
consumers’ viewpoint. After that, we analyze the Nash equilibrium region of the blockchain
applied by the e-commerce sellers. Considering the uncertainty of the utility of consumers
buying products and the inadequate funds of e-commerce sellers, we expand these two cases

in the expansion model. Our research is only carried out on the basis of ensuring the authen-
ticity of information in the blockchain, but the role of the blockchain is much more than that.
We make a further analysis in Sect. 5 in view of the many functions of the blockchain in the
information disclosure supply chain, and some conclusions are drawn.
To sum up, the main conclusions of this paper are as follows:
(1) If only one seller uses blockchain, when the cost of blockchain application is very small,
the high trust of consumers will drive the seller’s, information disclosure. For consumer
surplus, if the cost of blockchain application is relatively high, the results show that
the blockchain application will reduce consumer surplus, and more consumer surplus
will be reduced by self-application than by competitors, and the more the application
subjects, the more the consumer surplus will be reduced. For the applied blockchain
equilibrium, we give the equilibrium region about the blockchain cost and consumer
trust.
(2) Risk aversion will make the two competitive platforms set a high level of product infor-
mation disclosure and obtain high consumer surplus. However, after the blockchain
application, the level of information disclosure will be lower, but it has no effect on
the increase of consumer surplus. In addition, the high cost of using blockchain will
increase sellers’ sensitivity to demand fluctuations. Based on the analysis of the equi-
librium results, it is found that if the information is not transmitted relatively effectively
before the blockchain application (the degree of trust of consumers to the product), with
the increase of risk aversion, it is more difficult to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the
blockchain application.
(3) Under financial constraints, increasing lending rates will reduce the information dis-
closure and consumer surplus. Interestingly, if the cost of applying blockchain is high,
applying blockchain will reduce this impact. If the blockchain is applied, the high cost
reduces the seller’s sensitivity to the loan interest rate. Based on the analysis of the equi-
librium results, it is found that if the information is transmitted relatively high effectively
before the blockchain application (the degree of trust of consumers to the product) is
relatively high, with the increase of the bank loan interest rate, it will be more difficult
to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the blockchain application.
We further analyze the other functions of blockchain: blockchain can accurately predict the
utility of consumers to buy products, blockchain reduces bank lending rates, and blockchain
increases consumer preference. We find that what we have in common under these three
effects is that e-commerce sellers will increase the information disclosure after applying
blockchain. But for themselves, whether to increase the information disclosure depends on
the cost of applying blockchain.
Our study assumes that the information disclosure ability for two sellers is homogeneous.
In the future, we can extend the study to the fact that it (unit information disclosure cost) is
heterogeneous. Andwe can also consider exploring the impact of the two e-commerce sellers’
information transmission efficiency and blockchain costs on their optimal decision-making.

The similar methods for solving other optimal decision values in Proposition 1 are present.
Proof of Lemma 1
Because (ϕm + (1 − ϕm)λ) is always greater than 0 and αm is always greater than or equal
to 0, �m is always greater than or equal to 0, and C Sm = �m[�m + dm] is an increasing
function about �m , and in this paper, dm is a constant, so C Sm is only positively related to
�m . So, the size and nature of C Si j∗
m is the same as that of �
i j
m
∗.
Proof of Proposition 2
(1) From Lemma 1, we can directly prove the properties of �∗
mi j and λ. Take �∗
mi j as an
example,
d�∗
m N N
dλ
= 2θ1R1+θ1R2
k > 0. Therefore, �∗
m N N is the λ increasing function, C S∗
m N N
is the λ increasing function, and the properties of another consumer surplus are similar. (2)
The proving process of part 2 (2) of Proposition 2 is similar to that of part (1). (3) Through the
observation, it can be found that the size of �∗
mi j is related to the size of
λ
k and 1
k+t . Through
the solution, it is found that when t
k > 1
λ
− 1, �∗
m B B < �∗
m B N < �∗
m N B < �∗
m N N , then
C S∗
m B B < C S∗
m B N < C S∗
m N B < C S∗
m N N . On the contrary, C S∗
m B B > C S∗
m B N > C S∗
m N B >
C S∗
m N N .
Proof of Proposition 3

(ϕ1, ϕ2) = (1, 1) for the application of blockchain. When the values of λ and t are in
region II and region V, 
N N

Proof of Proposition 4
(1). The proving process of Proposition 4 (1) is similar to that of Proposition 1 (1).
(2). The conclusion in part 4 (2) of Proposition is obviously valid.

Proof of Proposition 5
(1) Take the relationship between Ui j∗

are obtained respectively:
dU N N∗

dδm
= −2(−k(Z1 + U A1) + λ((2θ1 − θ2)R1 − θ1R2)(dU A1

dδm
= −2(−(k + t)(Z1 + U A1) + (2θ1 − θ2)R1 − θ1R2)(dU A1
/
dδm)
θ1 − θ2
Obviously, under the premise that the sales volume is positive, the above formula
molecules should be negative, so we can get 0 < U Am < U A
i j
m .
(2) The absolute value of the formula in (1) and the derivation of t can be obtained.

. If the above three expressions are greater than
0 respectively, 0 < U Am < U Ai j
m can be obtained. If the above three expressions
are less than 0 respectively, U Ai j
m < U Am < U A
i j
m can be obtained. The methods of
proving other conclusions are similar.
Proof of Proposition 6
The proving process of Proposition 6 is similar to Proposition 3.
Proof of Proposition 7
(1) The proving process of Proposition 6 (1) is similar to that of Proposition 1 (1).
(2) The size relationship between α
i j∗
m−N SC and α
i j∗
m−P I D can be easily compared, and
accordingly, the relationship between C Si j∗
m−N SC and C Si j∗
m−P I D can also be compared. After
combing �α

1−N SC > �αB N∗
1−N SC , �αN N∗
1−N SC > �αB B∗
1−N SC ,
�αN B∗
1−N SC > �αB B∗
1−N SC . We further compare the relationship between �αB N∗
1−N SC and
�αN B∗
1−N SC : if we assume �αB N∗
1−N SC > �αN B∗
1−N SC , we can get t
k <
(λ2−1)p1
λ(2p1−λp2)

This condition is obviously not true, so we can get �αB N∗

�αN N∗

between �αB N∗

2−N SC : if we assume that �αB N∗

2−N SC , then we
can solve t

λ(p2/θ2−λp1/θ1)

(b) Quotes the conclusion of Lemma 1.
We only compare the size relationship of ��N N∗

λ

��N N∗

2 . Further compare
the relationship between ��B N∗
m and ��N B∗
m : suppose ��B N∗
1 > ��N B∗
1 , we can get
p2 > 2p1. This conclusion is contradictory to our basic hypothesis, so ��B N∗

hypothesis��B N∗

so ��B N∗

Proof of Proposition 8

If 1 + η <

−k Z1−λ(2θ1−θ2)c1+λθ1c2

d

dη
< 0. Similarly, we can prove
that the other three cases are true in the same way. However, due to the limitation of η, we
must ask 0 ≤ η < η
