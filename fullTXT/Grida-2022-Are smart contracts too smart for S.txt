Abstract
Purpose – Smart contracts are self-executing computer programmes that have the potential to be used in
several applications instead of traditional written contracts. With the recent rise of smart systems (e.g.
Internet of things) and digital platforms (e.g. blockchain), smart contracts are gaining high interest in both
business and academia. In this work, a framework for smart contracts was proposed with using reputation
as the system currency, and conducts currency mining through fulfilling the physical commitments that
are agreed upon.
Design/methodology/approach –Agame theorymodel is developed to represent the proposed system, and
then a system dynamics simulator is used to check the response of the blockchain with different sizes.
Findings – The numerical results showed that the proposed system could identify the takeover attacks and
protect the blockchain from being controlled by an outsider. Another important finding is that careful setting of
themaximum currency amount can improve the scalability of the blockchain and prevent the currency inflation.
Research limitations/implications – This work is proposed as a conceptual framework for supply chain
4.0. Future work will be dedicated to implement and experiment the proposed framework for other
characteristics that may be encountered in the context of supply chain 4.0, such as different suppliers’ tiers,
different customer typologies and smart logistics applications, which may reveal other challenges and provide
additional interesting insights.
Practical implications – By using the proposed framework, smart contracts and blockchains can be
implemented to handle many issues in the context of operations and supply chain 4.0, especially in times of
turbulence such as the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis.
Originality/value –This work emphasizes that smart contracts are not too smart to be applied in the context
of supply chain 4.0. The proposed framework of smart contracts is expected to serve supply chain 4.0 by
automating the knowledge work and enabling scenario planning through the game theory model. It will also
improve online transparency and order processing in real-time through securedmultitier connectivity. This can
be applied in global supply chain functions backed with digitization, notably during the time of the pandemic,
in which e-commerce and online shopping have changed the rules of the game.

1. Introduction
For the past three decades, supply chains have been facing several challenges due to the
increasing international competition and the complex business requirements. However, even
with these challenges, traditional economic and business models were capable of doing the
job and achieving the organizational objectives for most of the cases. Nevertheless, the
situation has been drastically changed during the past decade, with the major technological
advances that have added both opportunities and challenges for modern organizations

(Haddud et al., 2017). A recent major challenge took place with the spread of the COVID-19
global pandemic which shook the world in 2020 and imposed major challenges on global
supply chains, especially medical and food supply chains, due to the lockdown and the panic
buying in several countries (Sharma et al., 2020).
With the massive shift towards online shopping and e-commerce during the COVID-19
situation, trust and reputation issues are being critical to ensure safe and seamless processes.
The e-commerce revenue in the United States has increased by 44% in 2020, and the share of
e-commerce in global retail trade has increased from 14% in 2019 to about 17% in 2020
(unctad.org, 2021). Figure 1 shows the US retail landscape in 2020. This occurred due to the
lockdown in several countries and the fear of contracting the virus when shopping or having
business meetings physically (digitalcommerce360, 2021).
“COVID-19 Is a Crisis of Trust” Khurshid (2020) – therefore, the authors believe that a
framework is needed to address trust as an asset that has the potential for mitigating
challenges in global supply chains during turbulent times, including pandemics or other crises.
According to Hofmann and R€usch (2017), to cope with the fourth industrial revolution,
also known as “Industry 4.0”, organizations have to develop and implement autonomous and
self-regulating systems. The advances in information and communication technology (ICT)
have a significant impact on information exchange across supply chains; managing such
complex networks in real-time requires a sound digital environment that enables value
creation in supply chain transactions. In the past few years, blockchain technology and
applications have been receiving increased interest in the supply chain world (Kshetri, 2018).
Blockchain is the foundation for secure cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
(Ghobakhloo, 2018; Koutmos, 2019). In the context of Industry 4.0, partners in the supply
chain, which can be accordingly called “Supply Chain 4.0”, can integrate services in a remote
location into their own processes (Xu et al., 2018). Nonetheless, those partners usually have
competing interests but, in the same time, need to collaborate seamlessly and require trust,
transparency, autonomy and speed in their decentralized transactions. According to a report
by DHL (2020), about 10% of the legal disputes on lading bills are due to incorrect data and
misunderstanding of traditional contracts; thus, here comes the need for blockchain and
smart contracts. Yao et al. (2020) suggested using blockchain to coordinate the payment
structure in multi-echelons supply chains. Hofmann and R€usch (2017) identified smart
contracts as key blockchain technology that can be used for order processing that is a basic
function of operations and supply chainmanagement (OSCM). In that regard, smart contracts

can ensure that sufficient funds are available for the transaction under consideration and that
all the parties are paid in a timely manner (Sikorski et al., 2017).
The core competence of blockchain technology is its ability to protect its own generated
records, such as cryptocurrency transactions, and to maintain the authenticity and integrity
of these records (Nakamoto, 2008). However, assuring records’ liability is amajor limitation of
blockchain systems as they do not address the reliability of records created outside their
borders “exogenous records” (Lemieux, 2016). Supply chain transactions, which are related
usually to physical products and services, are exogenous to the consensus mechanism of
blockchains. Even with the integration of the Internet of things (IoT) or radio frequency
identification (RFID) with blockchain (Boudguiga et al., 2017; Haddud et al., 2017; Rizzi et al.,
2016), human behaviour can manipulate the IoT input, for example, by attaching the RFID
tags on empty, wrong or inferior-quality products. Therefore, the majority of supply chain
transactions are considered exogenous to the blockchain, because they are not generated by
the blockchain and cannot be verified by IoT, for example, conducting a perfect order
fulfilment or returning a misused product. Failure to have a consensus about the validity of
such simple but vital activities limits the applicability of blockchain and smart contracts to
address the supply chain issues within the context of Industry 4.0 (Mercuri et al., 2021).
This paper addresses the above challenges by introducing trust as a digital asset that is
encapsulated inside the blockchain to provide a good level of integrity for the exogenous
records originated outside the boundaries of automation. This strategy is applicable only to
permissioned blockchain ledgers and not to enhance the system stability as explained later
on. The concept of distributed ledgers is a radical innovation that enables organizations to
perform transactions in a decentralized way and comply with the digitalization adopted by
supply chain 4.0. Hence, comes the title and the main research question of this work: Are
smart contracts too smart for supply chain 4.0?
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a literature review on smart contracts
and their applications in OSCM. Section 3 gives a conceptual framework for realistic
implementation of smart contracts and its corresponding functions. Section 4 gives a
numerical study based on the proposed framework. Finally, Section 5 draws the conclusions
and the potential future work.
2. Literature review
2.1 What are smart contacts?
In a qualitative research performed by Korpela et al. (2017), a focus group composed from 30
companies was interviewed to discuss how blockchain technology can support Industry 4.0
and the related digital supply chain. Smart contracts were selected by 44%of the participants
as key functionality that can support this digital transformation.
Smart contracts are “self-executing scripts that reside on the blockchain and allow for
proper, distributed, heavily automatedworkflows” (Christidis andDevetsikiotis, 2017). Smart
contracts can be used for exchanging money, property or any value through some
transactions over the blockchain with a set of predefined rules and penalties (Biggs et al.,
2018). The concept of smart contracts was first introduced by Szabo (1994); he defined the
smart contract as “a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract”.
However, due to the technological status by then, it was difficult to adopt such concept in an
applicable way. With the rise of information technology and the cryptocurrency platforms, it
becomes possible to interact with virtual currency in a shared global ledger.
A smart contract is triggered by addressing a transaction to it, and after validating and
verifying this transaction, the smart contract executes autonomously on every node in the
chain. For the digital assets in the blockchain (e.g. Bitcoin), the accounts are automatically
settled, while for the digital representation of assets off the blockchain (e.g. stocks), accounts

are only settled after the accounts off-chain are matched with the agreed-upon settlement
instructions (Hofmann et al., 2018). All the interactions for smart contract operations along
the blockchain are verified via signed messages, and all the participants get a
cryptographically verifiable trace of these operations. However, some researchers criticize
the application of smart contracts and their implementation in blockchains. For example,
O’hara (2017) argued that the strictness of self-enforcement of a smart contract can be easily
misused and utilized against the contracting parties as it lacks the real-world form of
enforcement. The goal of this work is to try to narrow the gap between the virtual world and
the real world.
2.2 Smart contracts applications in OSCM
Many works targeted the general architecture and applications of blockchain technology
(T€onnissen and Teuteberg, 2019). Some works have addressed smart contracts
characteristics and applications in OSCM. Regarding the concepts and characteristics,
recent works addressed integrating blockchain technology with business process
management (BPM). Viriyasitavat and Hoonsopon (2019) defined two main problems with
such integration: time inconsistency and consensus bias that are both resulting from trust
issues. They argued that the executions of the contracts should reach its consensus by a set of
nodes that are agreed upon by the concerned business partners in order to provide more
reliable and flexible consensus. Viriyasitavat et al. (2018) have identified some critical issues
that face themodern BPM systems, such as verification, evaluation and transformation of the
trustworthiness and digitized assets.
Since the blockchain is a decentralized system for interacting with virtual money, a
shared global ledger is used to store the balance for every pseudonym and execute user-
defined programs. The ledger is a public database that supports information sharing in
supply chain demand planning in enterprises (Toyoda et al., 2017), and that can provide
proof of origin and traceability (Kshetri, 2017). Nakasumi (2017) proposed a different
perspective of the ledger by seeing it as a private database that supports business-to-
business trading and facilitates direct transactions and payment services in inventory and
demand-levels sharing.
Tracking marine shipments is an important application that combines blockchain and
IoT. Traditionally, a single container shipped fromEast Africa to Europe requires asmany as
30 employees and 200 or more transactions to handle the required paperwork. That is why
“Maersk”, the large shipping company, started working with IBM to use blockchain
technology to track their marine shipments (Dobrovnik et al., 2018). IBM is currently working
with about 400 organizations to apply blockchain technology; one of these organizations is
Walmart, which announced in 2016 that they are using blockchain to record and track the
origins of the products in order to improve health and safety standards (Condliffe, 2017).
Gallay et al. (2017) elaborated on using blockchain technology to confirm and store
contracts and transactions involved in selecting transport carriers and operators. Gao et al.
(2018) proposed a supply chain management system based on a hybrid decentralized
ledger with a block construction mechanism, a storage scheme and information protection
method.
Recently, several mechanisms have been developed to the fulfilment of blockchains
transactions. Cosmos, based on Tendermint, can be used to connect transactions among
different blockchains “Internet of blockchain” (Kwon and Buchman, 2018). Due to its
Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm, it can provide a secure and instant finality of
the created blocks. Despite its effectiveness to improve the scalability of blockchain, it may
create some type of centralization through having a limited number of transaction validators.
On the other hand, lighting network addresses the scalability vs decentralization paradigm of
JMTM
micro payments through channel payments networks. It is effective to handle multiple micro
transactions among a limited number of parties (Poon and Dryja, 2016). However, it may not
be a preferred solution to capture large values within the payment channel away from the
main blockchain, especially with the limited number of participants in the channel compared
to the main blockchain. Sidechains provide another approach to communications among
different chains or different cryptocurrencies through creating twoways pegged between the
sidechain and the blockchain, where the currency of one side of the peg can be blocked into it
until it is processed at the other side of the peg (Back et al., 2014).
Other applications of smart contracts include the enforcement of regulations for
pharmaceutical supply chains (Bocek et al., 2017) and food supply chains (Tian, 2016). For a
recent review on integrating blockchain with supply chain, the reader is referred to the works
by Hackius and Petersen (2017) and Sternberg and Baruffaldi (2018), and for a recent review
on blockchain research directions, see Hughes et al. (2019). Some important insights were
perceived from those works; the survey carried out by Hackius and Petersen (2017) has
shown that 60% of the middle managers raise concerns about data security in using
blockchain in supply chain context, while the main concern for consultants was the
technological maturity of the blockchain. Sternberg and Baruffaldi (2018) concluded that
the trustless paradigm that was introduced by blockchain has an unfavourable impact on the
transaction climate among supply chain actors; they recommended the use of smart contracts
to add value to the supply chain finance. Hughes highlighted the potential of using smart
contracts in applications beyond business to serve broader goals – United Nations (UN)
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Alicke et al. (2016) have identified six main drivers for supply chain; planning, physical
flow, performancemanagement, ordermanagement, collaboration and supply chain strategy.
Each driver has several levers for supply chain 4.0. For example, regarding physical flow, the
levers of supply chain 4.0 include warehouse automation, smart vehicles, in situ 3D printing,
human-machine interfaces and smart logistics. The McKinsey digital supply chain 4.0
compass is adapted in Figure 2 to highlight the areas that can be boosted by using blockchain
and smart. The selected levers were chosen as they address the external relationships in a
smart factory, which alignwith the scope of this work, that is the “exogenous” transactions in
the supply chain.
Among these levers, blockchain and smart contracts can play a role in facilitating smart
logistics (Liao and Wang, 2018). Accordingly, for the other drivers, the levers that can make
use of blockchain technology and smart contracts are online transparency (Queiroz and
Wamba, 2019), online order monitoring (Treiblmaier, 2018), real-time replanning (Saberi et al.,
2019), order processing (Casado-Vara et al., 2019), end-to-end connectivity (Abeyratne and
Monfared, 2016), supply chain innovation and reconfiguration (Queiroz et al., 2019) and
automation and scenario planning (Dolgui et al., 2019). According to Abd-alrazaq et al. (2021),
smart contracts are among the blockchain technologies that can be used in the context of
COVID-19. Marbouh et al. (2020) have presented seven use cases in which blockchain
technology can be used in the context of COVID-19; they proposed a system that uses smart
contracts in outbreak tracking. However, the research in these areas is still limited, and
further research is needed to address these issues.
2.3 Research gap and the focus of this work
From the literature, it was found that smart contracts can play a significant role in improving
the underlying business digital processes. Almada-Lobo (2015) has argued that supply chain
4.0 should be highly transparent and integrated; it also requires a continuous mapping of the
physical flow on digital platforms. Besides becoming digital, supply chain 4.0 should become
faster, more flexible, more individual, more accurate and hence more efficient.
A blockchain
framework to
mitigate
challenges
The proposed framework sought to serve the above levers and to address the aforementioned
obstacles of validating the non-electronic smart contract inputs that hinder the
implementation of the blockchain technology by utilizing two concepts:
(1) Reputation is coined as the digital currency. A participant’s wealth of the currency
reflects his credit worth in reality, because participants earn currency for executing
their transactions honestly. Reputation currency is used as a security deposit for
future system transactions. In that sense, as a currency of the ecosystem, participants
should be able to exchange it for other currencies.
(2) Currency mining is conducted through fulfilling the physical commitment of a smart
contract. The mining reward is calculated based on not only the participant’s
investment value in the contract, but also the whole status of the blockchain.
After an exhaustive study, it was concluded that the previous mechanisms are effective in
facilitating the exchange of cryptocurrencies and digitally verified services; however, they
may not be able to validate the non-digitally verified transactions. Some previous works
addressed the problem of the lack of trust between partners. For example, Weber et al. (2016)
argued that instead ofmaking an agreement on one trusted party, participants can share their
transactions across a large network of untrusted nodes. But the real challenge is how to trust
such untrusted nodes.
Hence, the main research purpose of this work is to provide a mechanism to validate the
non-digitally verified “exogenous” transactions through rewarding the different parties of a
smart contract for honestly reporting the status of fulfilling these transactions.
Game theory was used to model the proposed blockchain. Bigi et al. (2015) used game
theory to analyse a platform that addresses the problem of trust by holding a deposit from

both parties; this framework is effective for blockchains with low value transactions.
However, it is impractical for higher ones since it will add a considerable cost to both parties
and will make the decentralized system a poor choice compared to the centralized one.
Therefore, a less costly mechanism is needed to address this problem.
3. Conceptual framework
The proposed framework attempts to provide a blueprint that will be instanced into a
blockchain system dedicated to control an ecosystem in the context of OSCM and supply
chain 4.0. For example, let us assume that the proposed framework is instanced to control a
shared economy distribution ecosystem in which customers want to send some items from
one point to another, while suppliers are individuals who can transport these goods. To
decentralize the system away from a governmental agency or intermediate company
(middlemen), the blockchain should guarantee the payment to the supplier and the value of
the transmitted goods to the customer. Another example is the ecosystem of online retailers.
Suppliers are advertising online to sell an item and a distal customer wants it to be shipped to
his location. The blockchain should guarantee the investment of the first mover. Should the
supplier send the goods and wait for the money or should he ask for the money first and
transmit the risk to the customer side? Traditionally, a central agency (e.g. e-Bay) should be
involved in such ecosystem to secure both parties’ investments. In the context of e-commerce,
the reputation gained by sellers and buyers is based on the feedback they provide about each
other after the conclusion of the transaction. The tricky part is tomanage the integrity of such
feedback to ensure that it is provided by genuine users (Ryan, 2017).
To accommodate the proposed framework, the following assumptions are made:
(1) Permissioned blockchain is crucial to enforce some level of entering barriers to
maintain the value of earned reputation of the ecosystem and to limit players with
multi-identities.
(2) Only proof of stake, practical Byzantine fault-tolerant or any other permissioned
blockchain consensus algorithm can be utilized.
(3) Nodes are incentivized using the reputation currency, which can be exchanged to
other currencies through the framework.
3.1 Trustless transactions and the reputation currency
The proposed blockchain contains four types of contracts into its shared ledger. Two of them
are used to execute the blockchain-controlled trustless transactions, and the other two are
used to exchange the reputation currency with other types of digital or physical currencies.
3.1.1 The offer contract.An offer contract is initiated by a blockchainmember, who acts as
a customer/supplier publishing his own request/offer that he privately values at (Vc/Vs). The
contract is executed when any other member of the blockchain accepts it. The contract
includes three sets of parameters:
(1) Public parameters describe the main features of the request/offer (e.g. the area of pick-
up and drop-off for the shipment or the features of the product offered for sale). An
example is the price (C) expected to pay/get for the deal. If the contract is published or
accepted by a supplier ,the price should be higher than supplier’s private value
(C ≥ Vs), and if the price is published or accepted by a customer, the price should be
lower than his private value (C ≤ Vc).
(2) Private parameters describe the details of this request (e.g. the detailed addresses,
pick-up time, shipment weight and volume, etc.).

challenges
(3) The security deposit (S) required to be held from the supplier until the fulfillment of
the request, and the expiry time of this request/offer.
To initiate an offer contract, a customer/supplier announces the service or product he iswilling
to buy/sell; the time frame of the validity of this announcement should pass his commitment
amount to the contract fromhis reputation. Therefore, if the initiator is the customer, he should
allocate the price value (C) he is willing to pay for the service. If the supplier is the initiator, he
should allocate to the contract the value of the security deposit (S) that guarantees the
customer investment; for example, a value higher than the two-way shipping cost of the goods
to the customer location. If any of the blockchain members accepts to act as the other party by
passing the value of (S) or (C) from his reputation to the contract, then the contract is executed
by initiating a new conclude contract and passes both (C) and (S) to the initiated contract. If no
supplier/customer accepts the contract before the expiration of the validity time, the offer
contract expires itself and returns the investment back to the initiator.
3.1.2 The conclude contract. As described above, the conclude contract is initiated
automatically by the blockchain upon the execution of the offer contract. The conclude
contract represents the cornerstone of the proposed framework. The contract is designed as a
mechanism that ensures the honest contract fulfilment, which is the desired social outcome.
The conclude contract is designed as an extensive form game. The game has a set of
equilibriums if and only if the truth is told by both players. Therefore, there is no rational
motivation for either party to consider any cheating strategy that ends up with an outcome
less than the honest fulfilment of the contract.
Figure 3 depicts the extensive form game that represents the conclude contract and
indicates that the supplier has three possible moves: truly fulfilling the contract (T), falsely
claiming that he fulfilled the contract (F) and denying fulfilling the contract (D). On the other
side, the customer has three possiblemoves: admitting receiving the requirement (A), denying
receiving the requirement (D) and falsely claiming that he has not received the requirement
(F). An effective mechanism should enforce the equilibrium only at either (T, A) or (D, D) and
should exclude any rational choice of the (F) strategy for both parties. It should be noted that
it is not possible for the blockchain nodes to distinguish between the supplier’s strategies (T)
and (F) or between the customer’s strategies (D) and the (F). Therefore, the nodes’ consensus
algorithms will not be able to address this tool, even with nodes honestly enforcing protocols
such as the one introduced by Chen et al. (2017). The contract parties’ reputation reward is the
tool used to enforce this desired outcome.
The mechanism shown in Figure 3 allows each party to announce his choice twice. The
utility of customer at each terminal node is indicated at the top, while the supplier utility is
indicated at the bottom. The supplier acts as the first mover (node 0). If the supplier
announces (D), the contract shall be executed instantly by passing the hold amounts of S and
C to the customer and reward both parties by the rewarding functionR (node 3). The reason a
suppliermay choose not to fulfil the contract is his belief that the fulfilment cost is higher than
the summation of S and C. The customer responds with either (A) or (D/F) (nodes 1, 2). If the
customer responds with (A), the contract is instantly executed by passing the values of S and
C to the supplier and rewarding both parties byR (nodes 11 and 21). It is noteworthy that node
11 is the most socially desired outcome, while node 21 is undesired because the supplier
managed to cheat the customer and to charge him without fulfilling the contract.
If the customer response is (D) or (F), the supplier shall be asked to reconfirm his fulfilment
of the contract (nodes 12 and 22). If he responded with D, then the contract shall be executed
by sending its hold amount S and D to the customer and reward the customer but not the
supplier because it is assumed that he has cheated in his earlier response (nodes 13 and 23).
On the other hand, if he insists that he has already fulfilled the order (T/F), then the customer
shall be asked to reconfirm his earlier response (nodes 14 and 24). If he respondswith (A), then
JMTM
the contract is executed by passing the hold amount of S and C to the supplier without
rewarding any of them as both are assumed to cheat earlier (nodes 15 and 25). Otherwise, if he
responds with (D/F), the contract executes itself by voiding its hold amount without passing
any value or rewards to either of its parties (nodes 16 and 26).
As shown in Figure 3, the intensive form game can be defined through the set of the
actions available to each player Ai where i∈ fsup; cusÞ:
Asup ¼ fD;TT;TD;FF;FDg
Acus ¼ fA;FF;FA;DD;DAg
A set of non-terminal choice node H and a set of terminal nodes Z :
H ¼ f0; 1; 2; 12; 14; 22; 24g
Z ¼ f3; 11; 13; 15; 16; 21; 23; 25; 26g
In order to find the equilibrium of the above game, backward induction is used to predict the
game equilibrium. The customer is indifferent between the two options in node 14 because his
utility is equal to (Vs – C) in both cases (nodes 15 and 16). Therefore, it can be assumed that
ð∝ Þ percent of customers may respond with (A) and the remaining ð1− ∝ Þ may respond
with (F). Therefore, the supplier shall expect to get a utility value of ð1− ∝ ÞðC −VsÞ þ ∝
ð−S −VsÞ. Therefore, the supplier at node 12 shall respond with (T) if he believes that:

Solving inequality (1) for the value of ∝ results in inequality (2):
∝ > R=ðS þ CÞ (2)
It will be illustrated in Section 3.2 that R should be much smaller compared to both S and C.
Then, the supplier should conclude that it is highly probable to get a higher utility if he
responds by (T) in node 12. Continuing backward to node 1, the customer expects that the
supplier may respond by (T); hence, he should respond by (A) if his certain utility obtained at
node 11 is higher than the weighted utility obtained from the supplier response at node 12:
Vc � C þ R >

1� R=ðS þ CÞ

Therefore, it can be concluded that inequality (3) will be always correct for any positive values
of both of S and R.
Theorem 1. A super-rational customer should not falsely claim the supplier’s failure to
fulfil a contract if the contract includes both positive deposit and reward.
The customer is indifferent between the two options in node 24, and it can be assumed that the
ð∝ Þ percent of customers may respond with (A) and the remaining ð1− ∝ Þ may respond
with (F). Consequently, the supplier at node 22 shall respond with (T) if he believes that:
∝C þ ð1� ∝ Þð−SÞ > 0 (4)
Solving inequality (1) for the value of ∝ results in:
∝ > S=ðS þ CÞ (5)
By comparing inequalities (2) and (5), it can be seen that the supplier needs higher
percentages of customers to accept his fake fulfilment than those who accept his real
fulfilment to respond with (F), which is not a rational argument. Hence, the supplier may
believe that it is highly probable to get a higher utility if he responds by (D) in node 22.
Moving backward to node 2, the customer expects that the suppliermay respond by (T) based
on the value shown in inequality (2). Then, he should respond by (F) if his certain utility
obtained at node 21 is lower than the weighted utility obtained from the supplier response at
node 22, which is shown by inequality (6):

High values ofRmay compensate the customer for fake fulfilment andwill result in undesired
outcomes. Therefore, keeping the low values of R ensures that customers will reject any false
claimed fulfilment.
Theorem 2. Any super-rational customer should not admit the false fulfilment of a
contract if the reward is less than the multiplication of the deposit and the
cost divided by the summation of the deposit and the cost.
Moving to node 0, if the value of R is high enough to violate inequality (6), a super-rational
supplier shall not expect to end at node 21, if he responds with (F), and to get higher utility
JMTM
than node 11, which he shall end at, if he responds with (T). On the other hand, an appropriate
value of R shall enforce the supplier to respond with (T) if:
C * S=ðS þ CÞ þ
�
1� S=ðS þ CÞ
�
ð−SÞ < C � Vs þ R (7)
Simplifying inequality (7) results in:
C=S � Vs=S þ R=S > 0 (8)
Considering that C > Vs > 0, and R > 0, then inequality (8) will be always valid. Therefore, it
can be concluded that suppliers shall respondwith (T) at node 0 to end at node 11, which is the
game equilibrium.
Theorem 3. A super-rational supplier should truly fulfil a contract if it includes positive
reward, positive deposit and the contract cost is higher than his private value
of the fulfilment.
3.1.3 The invite contract. The invite contract is initiated and immediately executed when a
current member of the blockchain adds a new member and transfers some of his reputation to
him. To avoid a hostile takeover of the blockchain, the initial reputation value of the new
participants is hardcoded in the blockchain in order to maintain the system secure. Therefore, a
new member can be added only if an existing member invites him and transfers part of his
reputation to him. Such reputation transfer serves twomain purposes: liquidating the reputation
coin with a physical currency and enabling the system to scale up by adding new players.
3.1.4 The exchange contract.The exchange contract is used to allow themembers, who are
mainly customers of the ecosystem, to acquire additional amount of the blockchain
reputation token to be able to pay for their orders by exchanging physical or digital
currencies into the blockchain tokens. On the other hand, it allows the members to liquidate
the currency earned inside the blockchain into physical money. The reason to use exchange
contract is to maintain the reputation tokens within the borders of the system as it can not be
used as a general-use digital-currency (unlike Bitcoin). Therefore, the exchange contract is
used as a method to encapsulate the token into the blockchain.
3.2 The rewarding function
Being the miner for the currency of the blockchain, the reward function represents a
cornerstone of the efficient operation of the proposed system since its scalability is directly
related to the reward functions’ output. On the other hand, if the function rewards too much,
then it can cause the currency value to be severely inflated. Three reward functions forms
were investigated for the proposed framework.
The first one R1ðxÞ is calculated based on the interest ðεÞ for the amount of money ðxÞ
invested by the participants of the contract, as shown in equation (9).
R1ðxÞ ¼ x*ε (9)
The value of ðxÞ represents the transaction cost (C) for the customer and of the security
deposit (S) for the supplier. The value of R1ðxÞ should be higher than the accepted market
return on investment (ROI) for length of investment equal to the percentile of the ecosystem
transactions in order to reward the ecosystem member for the time value of his investment
into the blockchain. For example, if 90% of transactions takes less than 5 days, the ecosystem
considers that 10% per year is a good ROI, and that the blockchain utilizes 300% as a
premium over themoneymarket price; then,R1ðxÞ is estimated as 3*0.10*5/365 * ðxÞ. εshould
have a fixed value and not calculated as a function of the time of each contract to encourage

the blockchain participants to conduct frequent and fast transactions as much as possible
and not to use it as a money value storage tool. Moreover, having a fixed reward, that is not
time-dependent, pushes both parties to announce their decisions as soon as they are ready to
release their investment and rewards.
The second reward function is based on a logistic scaling of the first one. Considering that
peer-to-peer distributed systems are ideally proposed for small transactions, the proposed
function is designated to encourage the less-than-average transaction size. It passes double
the value to the ones around the average deal size in order to limit the very high rewards on
the high-value transactions compared to the system’s average transaction value. The
function adjusts the reward of a transaction with a value as per equation (10).
R2ðxÞ ¼ x*ε*2*
�
1� 1
1þ e−gðx−xÞ

(10)
The term x is the average value of transactions in the blockchain. Such extra rewards for
small-value transactions compensate participants with smaller transactions for the time and
effort they spend for data entry. The g term is the Gini index of the system and is used to
represent the steepness of the function. Therefore, there will be less discrimination against
the high-value transaction if the reputation value of all members is almost equal; in contrast, if
there are few members who are controlling high percentage of the blockchain wealth, the
reward function aggressively limits the rewards on high value transactions.
The third reward function is designated to control the total amount of currency in the
blockchain in order to avoid the inflation of the reputation reward as a currency. Equation (11)
shows how this function is used to reward a participant on his honesty in fulfilling a contract
in which he invested some value.

R3will bemore rewarding at the launch of the blockchainwhere the total reputation of all players
is much less than the half of its intended maximum. When the summation of the reputations of
all the members approaches the maximum, the function reduces the rewards’ values.
4. Numerical study
To validate the proposed framework, a system dynamics simulation model was constructed to
simulate the behaviour of the proposed rewarding functions. Three sizes of the blockchain are
simulated; small (S), medium (M) and large (L), with 10, 100 and 1,000 participants, respectively.
To initiate the model, each of the blockchain founders is given 10 reputation units. The conduct,
conclude and the exchange contracts are randomly executed between two randomly selected
members of the blockchain, who have enough reputation balance required by the contract. The
invite contract is executed onlywhen amember has a balance ofmore than 20 reputation points.
The values of the invite and the exchange contracts are fixed at 10 units as well. Equation (12) is
arbitrary used to generate C, where τ represents the customer’s available balance.
C ¼ maxðroundððrand½0; 1� * ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
τcustomer
p ÞÞ; 1Þ (12)
To complywith the logic that customers will not be involved in a transaction that exceed their
balance, the values of the transactions were generated bymultiplying a uniformly distributed
random number in the range between zero and one with the square root of the customer’s
available balance.
JMTM
The security deposit value (S) is randomly set based on equation (13) to be higher than the
cost. Based on the presented game model, it is enough to have any positive S to ensure that
cheating the other party is a dominated strategy.
S ¼ min

(13)
The cost of the transaction is scaled up by dividing it by a uniformly distributed random
number between zero and one. Then, it is rounded and compared to the half of the balance of
the richest supplier in the blockchain to ensure that there are suppliers that are capable to
afford the requested S (Li et al., 2019).
Each of the three sizes of blockchain is simulated for 10,000 transactions and the
simulation is repeated for 30 times; the results are presented in Sections 4.1–4.4.
4.1 The total reward amount
As shown in Figure 4, both R1 and R2 increase the total amount of the digital currency, and
this may result in a depreciation of the blockchain currency. Therefore, having a transparent
reward value is more important to the successful implementation of the blockchain than its
currency exchange rate.
Despite the overall linear-like performance of the R2, its aggressive limitation of the high
number of transactions dynamically changes the reward based on the transaction value.
Therefore, R2 is only recommended when there is a high risk of taking over the blockchain. In
most of the cases,R3 is recommended because of its predictability at each stage and its control
of the currency inflation. Figure 5 shows how R3 scales down the reward calculated by R1 for
the different instances. It shows thatwhen the total amount of reward approaches the half of its
planned value, the function reduces the rewards to control the currency inflation. Therefore,
careful setting of the maximum currency amount in the blockchain is important to make a
compromise between the scalability of the blockchain and the prevention of the currency
inflation. It is clear also that there is no significant effect of the initial size of the blockchain.
4.2 The number of newly added members
The size of a business/social network is critical to its continuity; therefore, the number of the
newly added members is considered one of the most critical success factors of the proposed
framework. In this section, the effect of different initial blockchain sizes and reward function
on the number of the newly added members is investigated. Figure 6 reveals that new
participants are invited to join the blockchain regardless of the number of the current
participants. As illustrated in Figure 4, the R2 reward function mines the smallest amount of
reputation currency; therefore, the resulting number of addedmembers is the least among the
other reward functions. The big variance of the large-sized blockchain indicates that the
Figure 4.

function per each

simulation time of 10,000 transactions is not enough for such instance size to reach its steady-
state compared to the small and medium-sized instances.
4.3 The Gini tracking of the blockchain
At the start of the simulation, all the participants have the same reputation balance; this
perfect uniformity results in zero Gini index. After a while, the transactions distribute the
reward randomly across the participants. The Gini index of the blockchain matures at about
0.3, which is almost the Gini index of a uniform distribution. As shown in Figure 7, the Gini
index increases sharply in small-sized instances, while it takes much longer to reachmaturity
with larger-sized instances. The Gini index of large-sized instances is more stable than the
small-sized ones, because a single transaction resulting in transmitting a sound portion of a
customer balance to his supplier cannot affect the overall index if there are other 1,000
members in the blockchain.
4.4 Resilience to hostile takeover
Like any Internet-based technology, cybersecurity is of critical importance; hence, it is
fundamental to check the system’s resilience in face of any possible takeover attacks
(Nagurney et al., 2017; Ben Yaghlane and Azaiez, 2019). To test the system’s resilience,

two attacks are planned at iterations 4,000 and 8,000. The attacks occur when a number of
participants hold their balance and try to take over the blockchain by inviting as much as
they can of newmembers to be able to control the blockchain. A resilient system should be
able to identify such suspicious behaviour. The premature blockchain contains a
considerable number of participants with their initial reputation. Therefore, the R3
confuses those original members with the attackers. However, for matured blockchains,
the function moves its scaling ratio towards a neutral level to prevent the attacker from
taking over the blockchain.
Figure 8 shows the Gini index that is used to signal out the attacks at different iterations,
where X-axis represents the iterations and Y-axis represents the Gini index value. Figure 9
shows the scaling ratio used by the R3 function to adjust the reward calculated by R1. It was
observed that the attack at iteration 4,000 could be identified by the blockchain for the
medium and the large-sized blockchains (shown at middle and the left of the figures) due to
prematurity of those blockchains at that stage. Therefore, for the 4,000th transaction of the
small blockchain, theR3 adjusts its scaling ratio to reverse the effect of the attack. The attacks
for the 8,000th transaction are identified by the function for all the sizes of the blockchain, and
the scaling ratio was adjusted accordingly to stop the attackers.
5. Conclusions
This paper addresses smart contracts and blockchain as key applications of supply chain 4.0.
A conceptual framework was proposed and a perfect information game theory model was
developed to represent the trust issue of the proposed smart contract model. After that, a
system dynamics simulator was used to check the response of the blockchain with different
sizes and different reward functions.
Based on the theoretical work and the simulation conducted in this research, some insights
can be gained:
(1) Validating the integrity of the blockchain exogenous transactions can be achieved
through rewarding the honest reporting of the fulfilment status of these transactions,

(2) Honest reporting of the conducted transactions outside the blockchain into the
blockchain can be used as the mining activity for the blockchain digital currency,
(3) The reward amount and mechanism are critical cornerstones for the trustless-based
smart contracts,
(4) As the time passes, the blockchain becomes more matured and more resilient to
takeover attacks, if and only if a proper rewarding mechanism is utilized to prevent
the attacker from benefiting from his attack,
(5) The proposed framework is expected to serve supply chain 4.0 levers by automating
the knowledge work and enabling scenario planning through the game theory model.
It will also improve online transparency and order monitoring and processing in real-
time through secured multitier connectivity,
(6) The proposed framework can be applied across several supply chain functions,
notably smart logistics and during the times of turbulence,
(7) The trust and transparency offered by the proposed framework should be backed by
a broader strategy for digitizing the supply chains and making them more resilient.
Thereby, the results and the discussion of this work support that smart contracts are not too
smart to be applied in the context of supply chain 4.0. Rather, this research has shown the
relevance and potential of using smart contracts for this area through the mutual advantage
achieved for all parties – customers and supplierswho can access data and perform transactions
in a secured and trusted environment governed by the proposed framework of smart contracts.
This work is proposed as a conceptual framework, and future work will be dedicated to
implement and experiment the proposed framework for different supply chain 4.0 systems
which may reveal other challenges and provide additional interesting insights. This paper
opens the doors for further research areas such as:
(1) Investigating the effect of different consensus algorithms on the stability and the
scalability of the blockchain.
(2) Developing other types of reward function that can match specific applications and
prevent certain type of attacks.
(3) Determining the optimal currency ceiling.
(4) Analysing the effect of the available blockchain liquidity on the scalability of the
ecosystem.
(5) Simulating systems with different suppliers’ tiers and/or different customer typologies.
(6) Considering environmental aspects of the supply chain.
