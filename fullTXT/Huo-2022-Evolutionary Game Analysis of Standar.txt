By embedding blockchain technology into the process of standardized production of agricultural products, we use the char-
acteristics of blockchain such as tamper-proof, decentralization, and consensus mechanism to solve the trust problem, re-
sponsibility problem, and quality problem in the process of standardized production of agricultural products.Tese three subjects
in the process of standardized production of agricultural products are analysed, and the three-party game model among ag-
ricultural producers, government, and consumers is constructed with the help of the evolutionary gamemethod, and the infuence
of each subject in diferent strategies is analysed, and the inference results are simulated and experimented with MATLAB 2016
software. Te results show that the standardized production of agricultural products embedded in blockchain needs to meet three
basic conditions: agricultural producers need to ensure that the sum of production costs and penalties for noncompliance
following technological innovation using blockchain is less than the sum of production costs and penalties for noncompliance for
traditional agricultural products; the diference value between strict and loose government regulation needs to be smaller than the
amount of penalty for violation of standardized production of agricultural products embedded in blockchain; the cost of
whistleblowing for consumers needs to be less than the number of penalties incurred for production violations when agricultural
producers choose standardized production of agricultural products embedded in blockchain. It is also found that the violation
ratio of agricultural producers, the social welfare of strict government regulation, and the whistleblowing beneft of consumers are
the key factors afecting the standardized production of agricultural products, and the analysis of the infuence of the key factors
points to the direction for promoting the standardized production of agricultural products.
1. Introduction
As a large producer of agricultural products in China, the
production of agricultural products needs to meet the basic
quantity demand, but also to ensure quality and safety, the
standardized production of agricultural products has be-
come one of the important means. In 2021, the Central
Committee of the Party issued the Central Document No. 1
proposed to further promote agricultural restructuring,
promote the cultivation of varieties, quality improvement,
brand building, and standardized production. In 2021, the
Central Agricultural Work Conference General Secretary, Xi
Jinping, also pointed out that the key core technologies of
agriculture should be promoted and standardized produc-
tion of agricultural products should be promoted. In order to
thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Conference
on Agricultural Work and the No. 1 Central Document of
2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Afairs of China
implemented the action of “Tree Products and One
Standard” in agricultural production to promote the stan-
dardized production of agricultural products and issued the
Implementation Plan of the Action of “Tree Products and
One Standard” in Agricultural production.
Te standardization of agricultural products is the basis
for the development of modern agriculture, and the stan-
dardization of advantageous agricultural products is an
important symbol of modern agriculture, and the combi-
nation of the promotion of applicable technologies for ag-
ricultural production and the implementation of
standardization is an important way to improve the quality

and efciency of agricultural production. Based on the
analysis of traditional agricultural production problems, this
paper embeds blockchain technology to reconstruct the
production process of agricultural products, making the
production process of agricultural products more open and
transparent, reducing the proportion of irregularities in
agricultural production, and promoting the advancement of
the standardization process of agricultural products. At the
same time, the three main bodies of the standardized pro-
duction of agricultural products are analysed, and reason-
able suggestions are put forward.
2. Literature Review
A review of the relevant literature reveals that many scholars
at home and abroad have researched standardized pro-
duction of agricultural products and blockchain technology
as follows.
Te research on standardized production of agricultural
products is mainly carried out in terms of relationship with
modernized agricultural production, the infuence of ex-
ternal factors, and the improvement of the quality of agri-
cultural products. Standardized production and modernized
agricultural production are closely related, and Cheng et al.
proposed to accelerate the construction of agricultural
products standardization system adapted to the Internet era,
use information technology, and establish a traceability
system for the whole process of production, processing, and
marketing of agricultural products [1]. Yin et al. proposed
that standardized production of agricultural products
should be based on agricultural practices, scientifc research
results, advanced technologies, and sound standardized
processes and measurement standards for the production of
agricultural products [2]. Trough further research, it was
found that standardized production can be infuenced by
various external factors, and Wang et al. pointed out that
farmers’ participation attitudes, subjective norms, and
perceived behavioural control can signifcantly increase their
willingness to participate in the construction of standardized
farms, and the total and direct efects of participation at-
titudes on farmers’ willingness to participate are the largest
[3]. Ma and Huo suggested that the government should
focus on cultivating the market for standardized products,
strengthening the regulation of market behaviour, empha-
sizing the propagation of standardized cognition, and
promoting moderate-scale operation [4], and Li suggested
that government departments need to guide agricultural
enterprises to standardize production so that they can see the
benefts of standardized production and the losses of non-
compliant production [5]. Scholars also found that stan-
dardized production of agricultural products can efectively
promote the quality of agricultural products. Li and Zhong
proposed that the way out for the quality improvement of
agricultural products is to implement standardized pro-
duction and build regional brands of agricultural products
[6]. Geng and Li proposed that to fundamentally implement
the standardization of agricultural products, the quality of
agricultural products should be guaranteed, productivity
should be improved, and the standardized productionmodel
should be selected according to local conditions [7]. Fan and
Pan proposed that standardized production of large-scale
agricultural products can promote the implementation of
technical standards for agricultural production, farm op-
eration specifcations, and production management stan-
dards in the production of agricultural products and can
ensure the quality and safety of the whole process of pre-
production, production, and postproduction of agricultural
products [8].
Scholars have made many useful studies on standardized
production of agricultural products, but they mostly focus
on the macroscopic analysis of standardized production and
are less involved in the process of standardized production
of agricultural products and the reduction of violation ratio
of agricultural producers, while new technologies such as
blockchain are less used in the process of standardized
production of agricultural products.
Te research on blockchain technology is mainly carried
out from three aspects: the relationship with the production
process of agricultural products, the advantages of the
blockchain traceability system, and the blockchain and trust
mechanism. Scholars found that blockchain has strong
applicability in the production of agricultural products, and
Liu et al. argued that blockchain technology has features
such as information sharing, data authenticity, security,
information, credential traceability, and smart contracts,
which have multiple coupling with the demand of agri-
cultural products circulation and help to solve the pain
points in the circulation of agricultural products [9], and
Kamilaris et al. proposed that blockchain is a promising
supply chain of agricultural products information trans-
parency technology that can be well applied in various food
and agriculture-related issues [10]. Scholars have found that
the traceability system established by blockchain has many
advantages. Wang et al. proposed that the workfow of the
agricultural supply chain can be tracked by blockchain
technology to achieve traceability and sharing of the supply
chain [11]. Cui et al. proposed blockchain technology to
build a traceability-trust system for organic agriculture,
which helps to break information asymmetry, rebuild the
trust relationship between production and consumers, and
thus efectively solve food quality and safety problems [12].
Shahbazi and Byun proposed a blockchain machine learn-
ing-based food traceability system, which combines new
extensions of blockchain, machine learning technology, and
a shelf-life-based management system based on a fuzzy logic
traceability system for perishable foods [13]. Behnke and
Janssen found through their study that blockchain tech-
nology can be used in supply chains for traceability of goods
and also for creating transparency in the supply of goods.
Scholars also found that blockchain can efectively address
trust issues [14]. Saberi et al. showed through their study that
there is a strong relationship between trust and blockchain
technology [15]. Peck identifed trust as the main driver for
the application of blockchain technology [16]. Dubey et al.
proposed that blockchain technology afects rapid trust in
the context of humanitarian logistics [17]. Wang found that
through the joint participation and real-timemaintenance of
blockchain nodes, the timely sharing of emergency material
2 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
donation information and the openness and transparency of
material destination can be achieved, which can solve the
social trust problem caused by information asymmetry and
lay the foundation for the formation of a new governance
pattern of “common construction, common governance,
and sharing” [18]. Scholars have made many valuable types
of research on blockchain technology, but they are mostly
focused on solving the quality problems of agricultural
products and less involved in applying it to the standardized
production of agricultural products.
Moreover, in terms of research methodology, the
problem of standardized agricultural production involves an
iterative game between the enterprises, government, and
consumers, which is diferent from the traditional social
dilemma game, such as the prisoner’s dilemma game (PD),
where natural selection favours defection and the average
population gain which is lower than during when everyone
cooperates, resulting in a social dilemma which is charac-
terized by a Nash equilibrium in which all participants are
defectors although the number of cooperates is Pareto which
is the most efcient one. Also, additional scenarios are
identifed to avoid the inevitability of social collapse em-
bodied in well-mixed PD. One such scenario is the chicken
game (CH) (also the snowdrift game (SD) or the hawk-dove
game (HD)), in which mutually betraying individuals is
inferior to cooperating-betraying pairs. Tus, CH allows for
a stable coexistence of cooperators and defectors in a well-
mixed population. Te stage hunt game (SH), together with
PD and CH, constitutes the standard trio of the most studied
social dilemmas, providing more support for cooperative
individuals in the sense that the benefts of cooperation
outweigh the benefts of exploitation or deception [19–22].
Tese aforementioned social dilemma problems are analysed
in the classical game theory framework, where cooperation is
impossible to achieve. In particular, even if the game is
repeated a fnite number of times (in reality, repeated games
cannot be played an infnite number of times), cooperation is
unlikely to emerge using the reverse recursive approach.
However, cooperation in fnite and many repetitive games is
prevalent in the real world and in various behavioural ex-
periments [23]. Tis suggests that real individuals do not
behave according to the assumptions made in classical game
theory. When the outcome of an individual’s choice of a
particular strategy depends not only on his own strategic
choice but also on the strategic choice of others, the fnal
situation is much more complex than the behaviour pre-
dicted by the game under perfect rationality. Terefore, to
explain the phenomenon of spontaneous cooperation in
selfsh groups in real society, we need to break the as-
sumption of perfect rationality, and the traditional game
analysis method is based on the analysis of rational rea-
soning, which cannot refect the learning process of par-
ticipants.Terefore, the traditional static analysis framework
is powerless to analyse the game problems of fnite rational
participants. Te evolutionary game theory takes the group
as the object and fnite rationality as the basis, and the game
analysis under fnite rationality is a new dynamic analysis
framework that includes participants’ learning and strategy
adjustment process. Let the game players form a group, and
through the iterative game of random pairing among
members, the results of the game are mapped into individual
adaptations. Tis analytical framework is very similar to that
of biological evolutionary theory, which is based on the
Darwinian idea of natural selection. Moreover, there are
similarities between human behaviour and the behaviour of
other organisms; for example, human beings will generally
be triggered by intuition when encountering complex
problems and will imitate the behaviour of successful in-
dividuals; human competitive and cooperative behaviour is
also very similar to that of the animal world. Terefore,
analysing human behaviour by drawing on the methods
used to study the mechanisms of trait evolution and stability
in biological populations is an efective way to draw on
analogical research ideas and methods. More importantly,
the analysis method of drawing on biological evolutionary
theory and biological behaviour laws can also simulate the
dynamic realization process of game equilibrium solutions.
Te standardized production of agricultural products in-
volves an iterative game between enterprises, government,
and consumers, which applies to the analysis of evolutionary
game theory [24, 25]. It is also an asymmetric game, i.e., a
type of game in which the players do not share the benefts
equally in the game process [26], while according to Ma
et al., asymmetric games are favourable for the development
of cooperation, and the higher the degree of asymmetry, the
higher the level of cooperation [27].
In summary, to solve the problem of standardization of
agricultural products, this paper tries to embed blockchain
in the production process of agricultural products, use the
characteristics of blockchain such as nontampering, de-
centralization, and consensus mechanism to solve the trust
problem, responsibility problem, and quality problem in the
process of standardized production of agricultural products;
meanwhile, use the evolutionary game model to build a
three-party game model among agricultural product pro-
ducers, government, and consumers, to analyse the infuence
between each subject in diferent strategies, and to provide
suggestions for the technological innovation of enterprises,
the implementation of government policies, and the par-
ticipation of consumers in regulation.
3. The Application Value of Blockchain in the
Standardized Production of
Agricultural Products
By summarizing the views of relevant scholars, we found
that there are many problems in traditional agricultural
production, and blockchain can efectively regulate the
production process of agricultural products and promote
standardized production of agricultural products.
3.1. Applicability of Blockchain to Solve the Problem of
Standardized Production of Agricultural Products. Tere are
many problems with traditional agricultural production.
Among them, the most important problems include trust,
responsibility, and quality. First of all, in the trust problem,
during the process of traditional agricultural production, the
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 3
information of production upstream and production
downstream is not open and transparent, which leads to
information asymmetry between the two sides, thus making
the two sides have a crisis of trust. Secondly, in the problem
of responsibility, in the process of traditional agricultural
production, there are often unclear responsibilities, and each
subject can shirk their responsibilities to each other,
resulting in inefciency in the process of agricultural pro-
duction. Finally, the quality problem is that the traditional
agricultural production process often does not need to re-
port the relevant data, and the information is not public,
which leads to people have doubts about the quality of
products, and producers often breed the psychology of illegal
production, which also makes the quality of products greatly
reduced.
Blockchain can efectively solve these problems arising
from traditional agricultural production. Firstly, blockchain
is decentralized and is a distributed ledger, so the data are no
longer concentrated in a central database, which guarantees
the openness and transparency of data and information
symmetry, and secondly, if blockchain is introduced, the
person in charge of each part will pack the data of the
relevant part into blocks and then upload them to the chain,
which makes the person in charge of each part traceable, and
it does not create a situation of shifting responsibilities.
Finally, the introduction of blockchain can collect and
upload data on the production environment andmaterials of
agricultural products, which can ensure the quality of ag-
ricultural products. Terefore, the introduction of block-
chain can be a good solution to the pain-point problem of
traditional agricultural production.
3.2. Blockchain Reconfgures the Standardized Production
Process of Agricultural Products. Blockchain is a distributed
ledger system in the form of a decentralized database in a
peer-to-peer network, which consists of one block with a
timestamp.Te block header mainly contains the Hash value
of the previous block, the Hash value of the block body, the
current time, and other important information, while the
“Hash” value means that the computer can calculate a set of
characteristic values of the same length for any content. Te
Hash value of blockchain is 256 bits, which means that no
matter what the original content is, the fnal binary number
of 256 bits can be derived, which ensures that the Hash value
must be diferent if the original content is diferent. By
concatenating the Hash, each block can be concatenated into
a chain, and the blockchain connection schematic is shown
in Figure 1.
At the same time, blockchain also features decentral-
ization, consensus mechanism, anonymity, and non-
tampering. Te introduction of blockchain technology into
the production process of agricultural products can efec-
tively track product information and guarantee product
quality, thus ensuring consumer safety. Te production
process of agricultural products mainly contains planting,
storage, processing, logistics, sales, and consumers’ pur-
chase. Te information on planting, storage, processing, and
logistics can be packaged into blocks and then uploaded to
the blockchain, and then the supermarkets can put the
traceability code on the package for sale, and fnally, when
consumers buy, they can scan the traceability codes to view
the information of the whole production process to ensure
that the information is open and transparent, which can also
ensures product quality. See Figure 2 for the schematic
diagram of standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in blockchain.
3.3.TeImplementationProcess of StandardizedProductionof
Agricultural Products Embedded in Blockchain. In the pro-
cess of standardized production, three main subjects are
involved: agricultural producers, government, and con-
sumers, and the three are inextricably linked to each other.
Agricultural producers need to be tested by the government,
the government can regulate agricultural producers, agri-
cultural producers will sell agricultural products to con-
sumers, and consumers can report the illegal products of
agricultural producers to the government; the government’s
regulation is to protect the interests of consumers, and
consumers can also report the current loose regulation of the
government to the higher-level governments; the relation-
ship between the standardized production entities of agri-
cultural products is shown in Figure 3.
At the same time, to achieve standardized production,
each subject needs to complete their respective tasks. Te
frst is the agricultural producers. Trough the blockchain
embedding technology proposed above, the quality of ag-
ricultural production can be efectively improved and the
proportion of production of ofending products can be
reduced. Te second is the government. Te government
also needs to strengthen supervision in this production
process, strengthen supervision of agricultural producers,
and do a good job in macroeconomic regulation, control
measures and public service mechanisms to ensure the
reasonable and efective operation of various departments.
As a third-party supervision mechanism, consumers should
actively prosecute the corresponding violations, strengthen
the awareness of standardization, consciously resist bad
production, and actively promote the standardization of
agricultural products to the market.

Construction for Standardized Production of
Agricultural Products
4.1. Model Assumptions. In this paper, we assume three-
game subjects: agricultural producers, government, and
consumers, who are all fnite rational. At the beginning of
the game, the three players are not optimal and need to reach
a stable state through continuous adjustment. Agricultural
producers have two strategic choices: one is to dare to carry
out technological innovation and introduce blockchain
technology for standardized production of agricultural
products; that is, to introduce blockchain technology into
the production process of agricultural products and carry
out all-round traceability of the production process of ag-
ricultural products; the other is not to carry out

technological innovation and adopt the traditional pro-
duction method, with data recording and uploading handed
over to the person in charge for manual processing. Te
government has two choices: one is strict regulation, such as
actively investigating the market condition of agricultural
products and actively carrying out a quality inspection of the
production process of agricultural products, and the other is
loose regulation; that is, the government is indiferent to the
market and rarely carries out research and quality inspec-
tion. Consumers also have two choices: one is to be treated
with the high requirement, i.e., to actively report on shoddy
products by agricultural producers and to expose govern-
ment inaction.Te second is a low requirement of treatment;
that is, they tolerate the purchase of substandard products
and do not choose to speak out, condoning corporate vi-
olations and loose government regulation.
Hypothesis 1. Agricultural producers as participant 1,
government as participant 2, and consumers as participant 3,
and assume that all three participants are fnitely rational.
Hypothesis 2. Te strategy choice space of agricultural
producers is α� (α1, α2) � (traditional agricultural pro-
duction, standardized production of agricultural prod-
ucts embedded in blockchain), and the strategy choice
space of government is β� (β1, β2) � (strict regulation,
loose regulation), and the strategy choice space of
consumers is c � (c1, c2) � (high requirement, low re-
quirement). Agricultural producers choose traditional
agricultural production with probability x, the govern-
ment chooses strict regulation with probability y, con-
sumers choose high requirement for product quality, and
government regulation with probability z.
Hypothesis 3. Te normal revenue of agricultural producers
is W. Te cost required when choosing traditional agri-
cultural production is C1, and the cost required when
choosing standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in blockchain is C2 (C2>C1); the cost required
when the government strictly regulates is C3, and the cost
required when government loosely regulates is C4; the fxed
cost required for consumers to purchase traditional
agricultural products is C5, and the fxed cost for consumers
to purchase standardized agricultural products embedded in
blockchain is C6.
Hypothesis 4. Te percentage of violations of traditional
agricultural production found by government sampling or
consumers isK1, the percentage of violations of standardized
production of agricultural products embedded in blockchain
found by government sampling or consumers is K2
(K2>K1), the government will penalize producers of agri-
cultural products found to be produced in violation of the
law with a penalty of R, and the severity of punishment
imposed by the government on agricultural products pro-
ducers for violations of production is P.
Hypothesis 5. Te fxed beneft obtained from govern-
ment regulation is S. When the government strictly
regulates, the quality of production of agricultural
producers will improve and therefore will be rewarded by
higher-level governments is F1, and when the govern-
ment opts for loose regulation, if consumers report, the
government will be punished by the higher-level gov-
ernments, and the amount of punishment is F2.
Hypothesis 6. Consumers can report to the government that
the product of the agricultural producers is substandard, and
at this time, the consumer will receive compensation from
the agricultural producers, and the amount of compensation
is Q1; the consumer can also report to the higher-level
governments that the government’s regulation is too loose,
and then at this time the consumer will receive the beneft
provided by the higher-level governments which is Q2, and
the cost required by the consumer to report the agricultural
producers and the government is C7.
Te model parameters are set in Table 1.
4.2. Model Building. Based on the above assumptions, this
paper constructed a mixed strategy model, as shown in
Table 2.

When z � (C2 − C1 )/[PR(K1 − K2)(1 − y)] − y/
(1 − y), F(x) � dx/dt � 0, x takes any value which is the
steady state, and both strategies of the agricultural producers
are game stable strategies.
When z> (C2 − C1 )/[PR(K1 − K2)(1 − y)] − y/
(1 − y), let F(x)> (dx/dt)= 0, then x=0 and x= 1 is the
steady state, and at this time, (dF(x)/dx)|x�0 < 0, then x=0 is
the equilibrium solution, and agricultural producers choose
standardized production of agricultural products embedded
in blockchain as the game stable strategy; conversely, x= 1 is
the equilibrium solution, and agricultural producers choose
traditional agricultural production as the game stable strategy.
Tus, the evolutionary process of agricultural producers
is shown in Figure 4.
Proposition 1. Te probability of agricultural producers
choosing “traditional agricultural production” will decrease
with the increase of the government’s choice of “strict regu-
lation” and consumers’ choice of “high requirement” strategies.
Proof. Te replication dynamic equation of the agricultural
producer choosing “traditional agricultural production”
is F(x) � x(Ua1 − U) � x(1 − x)(Ua1 − Ua2) � x(1 − x)

be reduced. Conversely, when the probability of the gov-
ernment choosing “strict regulation” is lower than a certain
level, agricultural producers will choose “traditional agri-
cultural production” to save costs and thus obtain higher
profts.
Similarly, it can be shown that the probability x of ag-
riculture producers choosing “traditional agricultural

When z>PR /PR − F2 − C3 − C4 − F1/[(K1 − K2)x

y=1 is the equilibrium solution, and the government chooses
strict regulation as the game stabilization strategy; conversely,
y=0 is the equilibrium solution, and the government chooses
loose regulation as the game stabilization strategy.
Tus, the government evolution process is shown in
Figure 5.
Proposition  . Te probability of the government choosing
“strict regulation” will increase with the increase of agriculture
producers’ choice of “traditional agricultural production” and
consumers’ choice of “high requirement” strategies.
Proof. Te replicated dynamic equation for the govern-
ment’s choice of “strict regulation” is
F(y) � y(1 − y)(Ub1 − Ub2) � y(1 − y)[C4 − C3 + F1 +
[(K1 − K2)x + K2][PR − z(PR − F2)]], and the partial de-
rivative of y is dF(y)/dy � (1 − 2y)[C4 − C3 + F1 + [(K1 −
K2)x + K2][PR − z(PR − F2)]], which gives the probability
of the government’s choice of strict regulation y, as a
function of the probability of the agricultural producer’s

When x> (C3 − C4 − F1)/[PR − (PR − F2)z]

bility of agricultural producers choosing “traditional
agricultural production” is higher than a certain level, the
corresponding violation ratio of agricultural producers will
also increase, and then the government will choose “strict
regulation” to reduce the percentage of violations. Con-
versely, when the probability of producers choosing “tra-
ditional agricultural production” is below a certain level, the
government will choose “loose regulation” because the
market is relatively stable and thus will choose loose reg-
ulation to save the cost of regulation and thus gain higher
profts.
Similarly, the probability y of the government choosing
“strict regulation” increases as the probability z of consumers
choosing “high requirement” increases, as shown above. □

for the equilibrium solution, then consumers will choose
high requirement for the game stable strategy; conversely,
z= 0 for the equilibrium solution, then consumers will
choose low requirement for the game stable strategy.
Tus, the consumer evolutionary process is shown in
Figure 6.
Proposition 3. Te probability of consumers choosing “high
requirement” will increase with the increase of the govern-
ment’s choice of “loose regulation” and agriculture producers’
choice of “traditional agricultural production” strategies.
Proof. Te replication dynamic equation for the consumer’s
choice of “high requirement” is F(z) � z(1 − z) [[(K1 −
K2)Q1]xy + [K2Q1 − K1(Q1 + Q2)]y + K1(Q1 + Q2) − C7],

K2)Q1]xy + [K2Q1 − K1(Q1 + Q2)]y + K1(Q1 + Q2) − C7],
and we can obtain the response function of the probability x

production with the probability z of consumers choosing

When x> [C7 − K1(Q1 + Q2) − [K2Q1 − K1 (Q1 + Q2)]

strategy (ESS), which means that when the probability of
agricultural producers choosing “traditional agricultural
production” is greater than a certain level, consumers will
choose “high requirement” to reduce the percentage of vi-
olations; conversely, when the probability of choosing
“traditional agricultural production” is lower than a certain
level, consumers will choose “low requirement” to save the
cost of prosecution.
Similarly, it can be shown that the probability z of
consumers choosing “high requirement” decreases as the
probability y of the government choosing “strict regulation”
increases. □
4.3. System Stability Point Equilibrium Analysis. Te stan-
dard assumption in traditional game theory is that eco-
nomic agents always make optimal decisions and the
economy’s norm is equilibrium, which is not in line with
reality. Evolutionary game theory assumes that the equi-
librium of the economic system is multiple and temporary,
and the specifc realistic results are path-dependent, and
the optimal decision is difcult to achieve, and its emphasis
is more on the dynamic process of economic variation.
Terefore, we make F(x) � 0, F(y) � 0, and F(z) � 0. In the
asymmetric game, if the equilibrium of the game evolution
is an evolutionarily stable strategy, it must be a strict Nash
equilibrium, and the strict Nash equilibrium is a pure
strategy equilibrium. In other words, the mixed strategy
equilibrium in asymmetric game dynamics must not be an
evolutionary stable equilibrium [28, 29]. Terefore, to
discuss the evolutionarily stable strategy for the tripartite
role of agricultural producers, government, and con-
sumers, it is only necessary to discuss the stability of these
eight points E1 (0, 0, 0), E2 (0, 0, 1), E3 (0, 1, 0), E4 (0, 1, 1),
E5 (1, 0, 0), E6 (1, 0, 1), E7 (1, 1, 0), and E8 (1, 1, 1) (E9
(x∗, y∗, z∗) as a mixed strategy is not eligible); according to
the method proposed by Friedman, the stability can be
analysed by Jacobi matrix. Te Jacobi matrix is obtained
from the three-way replication dynamic equation as

K1 (Q1 + Q2) − C7], and the individual equilibrium solu-
tions are brought into the Jacobi matrix to fnd the corre-
sponding eigenvalues as shown in Table 3 below (C2>C1;
K1>K2).
According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, the sign of
the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix can be used to determine
the stability of the equilibrium point, and when the sign of
the eigenvalues is all negative, the equilibrium point is the
stable point of the evolutionary game. We summarize the
following three general cases by further organizing the above
stability conditions.
(1) When C2 +PRK2<C1 +PRK1, agricultural producers
prefer standardized production of agricultural
products embedded in blockchain. PRK1 and PRK2
represent the number of fnes for agricultural pro-
ducers to choose traditional agricultural production
10 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
and standardized production of agricultural prod-
ucts embedded in blockchain, respectively, so
C1 +PRK1 and C2 +PRK2 represent the potential
costs of both inputs, respectively; if
C2 +PRK2<C1 +PRK1 means the input cost of
standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in blockchain is lower, it indirectly in-
dicates that the use of new technology leads to a
signifcant decrease in the percentage of violations
and therefore prefers standardized production of
agricultural products embedded in the blockchain.
(2) When C3 − C4<K2PR, the government tends to
impose strict regulation. From the above parameter
setting, we can get K2<K1< (K1 +K2); thus, we can
deduce C3 − C4<K2PR<K1PR< (K1 +K2) PR, from
which is easy to fnd that the above stability con-
dition is satisfed. C3 − C4 represents the diference
value between strict regulation and loose regulation,
and if this diference value can be smaller than the
number of fnes for blockchain embedded stan-
dardized production of agricultural products, then
the government tends to impose strict regulation.
(3) When C7<K2Q1, the consumer tends to have high
requirement. Similarly, we can use the known
condition of K2<K1< (K1 +K2), so that we can de-
duce C7<K2Q1<K1Q1< (K1 +K2)Q1, which is easily
found to satisfy the above stability condition. When
agricultural producers choose the standardized
production of agricultural products embedded in
blockchain, there may be a small number of

violations, and if the benefts of reporting still out-
weigh the costs of reporting, consumers will tend to
be high requirements.
5. Numerical Analysis of the Three-Party
Evolutionary Game
To further verify the correlation between the subjects,
MATLAB 2016 was used to simulate and analyse the game
results, and the data related to the standardized production
of agricultural products embedded in the blockchain were
obtained based on the research on the production process of
agricultural products in Central Red Group in Harbin,
Heilongjiang Province, in August 2021, while the data re-
lated to the production of traditional agricultural products in
the market were collected from Harbin farmers’ market,
Querying Harbin government website and questionnaire
research consumers to get the range of parameters related to
the game subject.Te ultimate goal of this paper is to achieve
the ideal state that agricultural producers tend to achieve
which is standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in the blockchain, the government with strict
regulation, and having consumers with high requirement,
that is, to fnd the game strategy that tends to be close to the
stable point E4 (0, 1, 1), so this paper sets the following
parameters in the reasonable parameter range in Table 4.
5.1. Numerical Analysis of the Stabilization Strategy of the
Tree-Party Game. Trough numerical simulation analysis
of the above situation, it can be verifed that the three-party
game subject can evolve to a stable strategy with t when the
constraints are satisfed by agricultural producers, govern-
ment, and consumers. As shown in Figure 7, the initial
values of x� 0.5, y� 0.5, and z� 0.5 are set, and through
numerical simulation analysis, under the above conditions,
the three-party game subjects fnally evolve to the stable state
of x� 0, y� 1, and z� 1. At this time, the three-party strategy
involves the ideal state of standardized production of ag-
ricultural products embedded in blockchain by agricultural
producers, strict regulation by the government, and high
requirement by consumers.
5.2. Numerical Analysis of Evolutionary Stabilization
Strategies for Changing Parameters
5.2.1. Numerical Simulation of Changing K1 and K2 on
Agricultural Producers’ Strategies. Under the condition that
other parameters are not changed, the values of the violation
ratio K1 of traditional agricultural production by govern-
ment sampling or by consumers are taken as 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and
0.8 respectively for four simulations, and the evolutionary
path of agricultural producer’s strategy choice is shown in
Figure 8. Standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in blockchain by the government sampling or by
consumers found that the proportion of violations K2 takes
the value of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 simulations four times,
respectively, and the evolutionary path of agricultural
producer’s strategy choice is shown in Figure 9.
As shown in Figure 8, we can fnd that as K1 increases, the
faster the agricultural producers tend to 0; that is, the agri-
cultural producers are more willing to adopt the standardized
production of agricultural products embedded in blockchain
when the violation ratio of traditional production is very high.
Similarly, as shown by Figure 9, as K2 decreases, the faster the
agricultural producers tend to 0.Tismeans that if blockchain
technology is introduced, the more obvious the efect of
reducing the proportion of agricultural production violations
is, the more willing agricultural products producers are to
carry out technological innovation.
5.2.2. Numerical Simulation of Changing R and F1 of the
Government Strategy. Te evolutionary path of the gov-
ernment strategy choice is shown in Figure 10 by taking the
values of the government penalty R for production violations
as 8, 10, 12, and 14 simulations four times without changing
other parameters. Te values of social welfare F1 when the
government is strictly regulated are taken as 3, 5, 7, and 9
simulations for four times, and the evolutionary path of the
government strategy choice is shown in Figure 11.
As shown in Figure 10, we can fnd that the penalty fnes
of the government for production violations do not afect the
government regulatory choice and do not play a role in
infuencing the government to actively regulate; however, as
shown in Figure 11, the government tends to 1 signifcantly
faster as F1 increases, which means that the greater the social
welfare generated by strict government regulation, the more
it can promote strict government regulation. Tis also in-
dicates that if the efect of strict regulation is more pro-
nounced, i.e., the more stable the market is under
government regulation, the more positively the government
is evaluated as well as the better its reputation, and the more
the government tends to impose strict regulation.
5.2.3. Numerical Simulation of Consumer Strategy by
Changing Q1 and Q2. Te evolutionary path of the consumer
strategy choice is shown in Figure 12, where the benefts of the
consumer’s reporting to the government about the violation
of agricultural productsQ1 are simulated 4 times, 6, 8, 10, and
12 times, respectively. Te evolutionary path of consumers’
strategy choice is shown in Figure 13 when the benefts gained
by consumers who report to higher-level governments for the
current loose government regulationQ2 are taken as 8, 10, 12,
and 14 simulations, respectively.
As shown in Figure 12, we can fnd that the higher the
gain obtained by the consumer from reporting the illegal
agricultural products to the government, the faster the
consumer tends to 1, and the more the consumer tends to
ask the producer of the agricultural product with a high
requirement standard. Similarly, as shown in Figure 13, the
higher the gain from consumers reporting loose government
regulation to higher-level governments, the faster the con-
sumers tend to 1. More consumers tend to treat the gov-
ernment with high requirement standards and urge it to
impose strict regulation.

6. Numerical Analysis of the Three-Party
Evolutionary Game
6.1. Conclusion. In this paper, we introduce blockchain
technology to optimize the production standard of agri-
cultural products and to build a three-party game model
among agricultural producers, government, and consumers
from the perspective of enterprise self-efort, government
supervision and support, consumer participation and su-
pervision, and to study the behavior of the three subjects
with the help of evolutionary game method.Te results were
simulated using MATLAB, and the following conclusions
were drawn:
(1) Encourage agricultural producers to innovate and
promote standardized production of agricultural
products. Terefore, the agricultural producer
should advocate technological innovation in the
process of standardized production and boldly in-
troduce blockchain technology to reduce the pro-
portion of irregularities, so that the whole
production process of agricultural products can be
traced and the information is open and transparent,
and at the same time, the proportion of irregularities
in production can be reduced, so that agricultural

producers can be less punished by the supervisory
authorities and can feel more secure about the ag-
ricultural products they buy. It can also make con-
sumers feel more secure about the agricultural
products they buy. At the same time, the game results
show that for agricultural producers to carry out
standardized production of agricultural products
embedded in the blockchain, they need to meet the
stable condition of C2 +PRK2<C1 + PRK1; that is,
agricultural producers need to ensure that the sum of
production costs and penalties for noncompliance
following technological innovation using blockchain
is less than the sum of production costs and penalties
for noncompliance for traditional agricultural
products, and the percentage of violation of tradi-
tional production is very high, and the blockchain
embedded in the standardized production of agri-
cultural products can efectively promote the tech-
nical innovation of agricultural producers by
signifcantly reducing the percentage of violations.
(2) Te government fulfls its regulatory responsibilities
and promotes the process of standardized produc-
tion. At the same time, it should focus on cultivating
consumers’ awareness of rights, popularize the
concept of standardized production to the public,
and let more consumers participate in the process of
standardized production to accelerate the stan-
dardized production of agricultural products. At the
same time, the game results show that to make the
government carry out strict regulation needs to meet
the stable condition of C3 − C4<K2PR; that is, the
diference value between the cost of strict regulation
and the cost of lenient regulation should be smaller
than the amount of penalty for violation of stan-
dardized production of agricultural products em-
bedded in the blockchain, and the penalty fne of the
government for violation of production does not
afect the government’s choice of regulation, but the
increase of social welfare generated by strict gov-
ernment regulation can efectively promote strict
government regulation, so a better social reputation
is more likely to promote government regulatory
incentives.
(3) Consumers also have an important role in the
standardized production process. On the one hand,
consumers can efectively supervise the products of
agricultural producers, and if they fnd illegal
products, they are willing to report them. On the
other hand, consumers also play a supervisory role in
the government, which can efectively urge the
government to regulate and better maintain market
stability. At the same time, the game results show

that the stability condition of C7<K2Q1 needs to be
satisfed to make consumers demanding; that is, the
cost of consumers’ prosecution needs to be smaller
than the penalty amount of reporting agricultural
producers’ production violations under blockchain
embedding, and the increased revenue generated by
consumers reporting produced violations by pro-
ducers and loose government regulation can efec-
tively promote high consumer requirement on
agricultural producers and government.
6.2. Policy Recommendations
(1) Te government should vigorously advocate the
industrial transformation of producers, encourage
them to carry out technological innovation, stan-
dardize the production process by introducing
blockchain and other technologies, and accelerate
the promotion of the standardized production
process of agricultural products.
(2) Te government should strengthen supervision and
improve the supervision system. Local governments
can establish a reasonable standardized supervision
system by combining the regional characteristics and
actual situation with the instructions and strategic
arrangements of the central government and regu-
larly conducting special inspections of standardized
production to agricultural producers.
(3) Te government should do a good job of propa-
ganda, strengthen consumers’ awareness of stan-
dardization, advocate for consumers to actively
report producers’ irregularities, resist unscrupulous
businessmen together, and play the role of consumer
supervision.
