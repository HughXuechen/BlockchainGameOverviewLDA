Abstract — Blockchain has been evolving and gaining new 
heights over the years. The shift in the perspective is allowing 
new user cases beyond the cryptocurrency space. 
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets supported by the 
complexities of cryptography, game theory and peer-to-peer 
networks. Blockchain became a popular platform for 
decentralized applications, as well as a valuable tool for start-
ups seeking fundraising. The aim of this research paper is to 
review and assess the status quo for each branch of use cases, 
and then analyze the enabling and inhibiting factors influencing 
the adoption of blockchain. These findings permit a broader 
comprehension over the concepts backing blockchain. It will 
help new users to establish strategies, develop solutions and 
encourage the employment of blockchain technology.  
Keywords—blockchain, cryptocurrencies, Dapps, blockchain 
business models. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Several projects took place aiming to deliver electronic 
payments overall the past 30 years. Ecash (DigiCash) in 
1992, e-Gold in 1996, e-Bullion in 2001, just to mention a 
few [1], [2] [3]. Most projects failed due to legal compliance 
or mismanagement matters [4]. The concept of block 
chaining, or chained blocks have been used for decades in 
cryptology. Initially in the context of network security, 
message verification, authentication and data integrity. Block 
chaining was a cryptographic construct aimed to improve 
efficiency, reliability of time stamping and content delivery 
by linking hash values of a digital document [5] [6].  
The concept of decentralized digital currency was 
explored in 1998 by Nick Szabo on the development of 
security, costs, ownership, etc. Authority is proven by digital 
signatures which is a combination of public and private keys. 
Tokens represent the assets owned by the identities (users) 
that own these digital keys. Transactions are signed and 
registered forming a block which is cryptographically 
protected. Every node participant agrees on the state and 
history of the token transactions. In section II, it will be 
examined blockchain use cases and section III the key 
enablers and inhibitors that affects its deployment.

BitGold [7]. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency use case to 
make use of block chain technology. Under the fictious name 
of Satoshi Nakamoto, it was released the first implementation 
of peer-to-peer (P2P) trustless electronic cash [8]. 
Nakamoto’s goal was to eliminate the middleman, and 
traditional financial institutions such as banks, credit cards or 
money transfer companies. Key differences between bitcoin 
and its predecessors are the (a) deployment of the P2P 
network, (b) absence of a central server to prevent double 
spending and timestamping functionalities, (c) tokenization 
and rewarding mechanisms to enable nodes to execute vital 
activities to the system, (d) ledger that records the state and 
history of all transactions, (e) cryptographic resources that 
builds up the trust environment via the chain of blocks and (f) 
the consensus protocol that links all the building blocks 
together allowing peers to safely perform transactions in an 
untrusted environment. 
Consensus protocol is the engine that sanctions all the 
pieces together in blockchain. The key underlying building 
blocks, such as cryptography, hashing function, peer to peer 
communication, game theory, decentralization, are all 
reflected in the consensus protocol. It defines the speed,

II. BLOCKCHAIN USE CASES
This research identified three business segments under the 
blockchain domain: (a) cryptocurrency, (b) utility platform 
for decentralized applications and (c) business model for 
capital raising. Although there is some overlap and 
interdependency, these segments are distinct and 
quantifiable. These opportunities are explored in more details 
in this section. 
A. Blockchain as a cryptocurrency
Money has been evolving since pre-history. From shells, 
beads, bones, colored feathers and pebbles, to the bartering 
system. Shekel is mentioned in cuneiform texts in Mesopotamia 
3,000 B.C. First as a unit of measurement, and then, in 600 BC 
shekel coins were introduced [9] [10]. Later, silver besides being 
a commodity, also functioned as money. In the late 17th century 
paper money was introduced in Europe. Credit cards came up 
in the mid of 20th century and soon became the number 1 
choice of payments. More recently, cryptocurrency has been 
introduced. The motivational aspects of crypto-coins can be 
linked to groups with  technological-political orientation and 
also to socio-economic factors [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], 
[16]. 
The cryptocurrency market can be segmented in several 
ways. The first wave of cryptocurrencies, until 2013, mainly 
focused in the storage and transfer of values. When the 
numbers of users grew exponentially, the technology 
presented several limitations such as throughput, scalability, 
transactions costs, environment sustainability, security, etc. 
In Q3_2018, there are over a thousand cryptocurrencies being 
listed in the main digital exchanges [17] [18]. Most coins 
have differences in their business proposition, focusing in 
specific attributes such as privacy, security, transaction speed 
and so on. Many coin projects have been abandoned, due to 
scams and lack of development support [19] [20]. As depicted 
in Table 1, the current trend is still high with a market cap of 
302 Billion USD. 
Bitcoin accounts for 47% of the total volume market cap 
(142 Billion USD Q3_2018). There are other 19 coins with 
market cap between 1 and 99 Billion USD. Ethereum is the 
leader on this category with market cap of 48 Billion USD 
[18]. The potential to growth of the cryptocurrency business 
is still high, but not necessarily as an alternative to fiat money 
as originally conceived. The currency fluctuation is still very 
high, making it impractical for financial planning purposes. 
Nevertheless, new use cases making use of the tokenized 
economy have been emerging daily. It is opening new 
opportunities and creating a more sustainable environment as 
the technology grows stronger when associated to business 
trends outside the blockchain space. 
B. Blockchain as a Software Utility Platform for
Deliverying Decentralised Applications (Dapps)
Decentralized applications (Dapps) is a by-product out of 
blockchain technology. The underlying concept is the 
utilisation of the blockchain network as a platform to the 
deployment of self-governing applications. Dapps can be 
categorised by use cases, industries, or type of services 
[21][22]. Earlier Dapps only stored cryptocurrencies for 
direct P2P payments. Some Dapps mix money with external 
information (outside the blockchain network) through an 
interface referred to as ‘oracles’. There are Dapps that only 
explore the trusting attribute of blockchain and are unrelated 
to money. E.g. as a voting or a governance system. Many use 
cases can benefit from blockchain or similar technologies 
such as the Distributed Ledger Technologies - DLT. The key 
difference between blockchain and DLT is in the accessibility 
and authentication. Blockchain operates in a permissionless 
and open environment while DLT, in most cases, operates in 
a permitted (closed) environment. Regardless if blockchain 
or DLT, rules and policies are created by design, on a case by 
case basis. Most Dapps use cases are associated to the 
issuance of new tokens or smart contracts. 
The tokenization property of blockchain enables Dapps to 
become a utility platform, a tool set that can be scaled and 
applied to any phenomena involving transactions. This 
concept transcends the space of mobile and desktop 
applications. Dapps have been tried out in many fields, from 
P2P energy transaction to food certification, from data 
provenance to government, just to mention a few. 
Developers can create private cryptocurrencies and contract-
based applications using a Turing-complete (or equivalent) 
language, which allows businesses to set their own rules and 
policies. It allows cost savings during the building and 
implementation stage and to maintain a business and 
operational infrastructure at lower fees. While traditional 
methods require payment processing (e.g. PayPal, Visa, etc.), 
registration, complex database, server, Dapps allow 
transaction processing automatically on a decentralized 
architecture, faster and less costly. Ethereum is largely the 
most used platform for Dapps deployment. Game is the 
leading market niche for Dapps (Fig. 2).

Smart Contracts are a piece of software enabled by 
blockchain (or DLT) that is embedded in the application. It is 
intended to automate and enforce contract arrangements or 
tasks between network participants without a third-party 
intervention. It can be contractual clauses triggered by any 
event which are coded and linked to the blockchain network. 
They can be self-executable, self-enforceable, generating 
automatic payments, billing, invoices, sending messages, 
keeping track of a chain of events as a way for reducing costs. 
C. Blockchain as Business Model for Capital Raising
Traditionally when a startup or a stablished business
wanted to raise funds, they would have to undergo the tough 
mission of pitching to venture capitalist, banks, angel 
investors, etc. It could easily involve hundred of pitches, 
substantial amount of time and money and the creation a 
formal business plan. When finally approved, contract terms 
allowed little room to negotiation, slight flexibility, and 
usually highly onerous terms.  
Crowdfunding is a method of raising finance by 
reaching many people or organizations to acquire equities (or 
rewards) for a small amount of money. It uses Internet to find 
thousands, if not millions of potential funders [23]. The 
concept of crowdfunding has been growing enormously since 
2010 and shaping innovation in services, products, projects, 
investments, causes and experiences causing a shift in the role 
of financial institutions. As crowdfunding became a popular 
investment form, over a thousand crowdfunding platforms 
have emerged worldwide [24]. Blockchain allowed the 
introduction of tokens in substitution of equity shares in 
crowdfunding. That increased the access to a larger audience 
since anyone with access to Internet, an online bank account 
and a crypto wallet account could participate of the 
crowdfunding.  
Depending on the business strategies, the solution may 
adopt an existing cryptocurrency platform to launch the 
business. That would facilitate and speed up the funding 
event and development of the product/service faster.  In some 
cases, the solution may involve the creation of a new 
cryptocurrency. The Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are the 
most common choice for financing startup business in the 
blockchain space. An amount of cryptocurrency tokens can 
be negotiated with the investor in advance, instead of shares. 
The basic assumption is that the business will grow, and the 
coins will be traded in the future with an expected profit to 
the investor. Any services or goods produced by an 
organization can, in theory, be traded in cryptocurrency for 
future payments. It is estimated that over 6 billion USD was 
raised from ICOs in 2017 [25]. According to the report from 
PwC Strategy and Analyses, ICOs have grown dramatically 
during the first 5 months of 2018, raising U$13.7 billion. This 
amount accounts for more than all the ICOs combined since 
2013. Table 3 depicts the countries with most traction for 
ICOs. The USA, Switzerland and Singapore are the hot spots 
for ICOs, followed by the UK and Hong Kong [26]. 
Legislation varies in each country so risks and 
compliance. The speed at which ICOs have grown brought 
challenges to regulators. In some countries ICOs are not even 
permitted. While equity crowdfunding is regulated, ICOs are 
unregulated and consequently risks are greater.  There are 
other frameworks being adopted by startups in different 
jurisdictions. The Simple Agreement for Future Tokens 
(SAFT) is a form of investment contract that may be suitable 
in those countries (or states) where a crypto venture 
investment is considered a security. The SAFT agreement 
refers to the funds received by the entrepreneur in exchange 
of documentation establishing that should a product or 
service be created and available in the future, the investor will 
be given preference. So, in principal SAFT is not a debt 
financial instrument as there is a pre-condition involved in 
case the venture fails.  
Initial Loan Procurement (ILP) is another option where 
the entrepreneur receives funds from the creditor (investor) 
in the form of a loan. A document is prepared indicating both 
creditor and borrower details on a smart contract referring to 
the amount of crypto money tied up to the loan will be paid 
in the future. ICOs, SAFT and ILP are blockchain business 
models to be considered by a company seeking to raise funds. 
Business strategies and due diligence to comply with all 
relevant laws and regulations are determinant factors to the 
success or failure of the venture.

III. ENABLERS AND INHIBITORS 
In this section, most relevant enablers and inhibitors for the 
blockchain technology are listed. This information has been 
obtained based on the current market trends, news, Internet 
articles, white papers and a diversified range of collected 
opinions.  
ENABLERS 
There is a myriad of possibilities corroborating to the 
implement blockchain. Here are the most relevant aspects: 
 CRYPTOCOINS ARE A NATURAL EVOLUTION OF MONEY
Money has always been evolving since ancient time.
From the bartering system to tally sticks, then shekels of
barleys and then metallic coins. Money was introduced as
a solution to facilitate trades among the first civilizations.
It took hundreds of years for paper money to be accepted.
Another 50 years for merchants to accept credit cards
worldwide. Until 1971 the US dollar was backed by gold,
not anymore. All other countries followed suit. Since then
the trust in commodity was replaced by some form of
virtual trust in the government. Money became a piece of
paper that is only backed by the government who issued
it. If the US government fails, the whole international
monetary system automatically collapses. No backups.
The US dollar was not designed to become a cross state
currency. That is why cryptocurrency is an evolution out
of the fiat money, as it does not rely in governments.
 BLOCKCHAIN FACILITATES THE SHARING ECONOMY
Consumers are gradually becoming more sensitive to
environment and sustainability aspects. The possibility of
sharing and trading on peer to peer basis without a third
party empowers local economy. It can be a game change.
From sharing a car, a bike, or trading energy – any product
or service that can be traded, as long as there’s a demand,
blockchain can facilitate matters. There are a number of
platforms making use of this niche, such as Lyft Driver,
ShareRing, etc.
 BLOCKCHAIN HELPS STARTUPS TO ENTER THE
MARKET FASTER
Blockchain offers a new framework for startups seeking
to enter the market faster. ICO, SAFT and ILP are much
faster option when comes to raise funds via equity
investors and venture capitalists. It saves time, escapes
formalities such as the expensive and time-consuming
business plans and road shows pitching. Timing is
paramount for tech start-ups and business ideas can be
wasted due to bureaucracy and paperwork. Competition
is fierce. Blockchain enables both a business model and a
utility platform to launch Dapps faster and less costly.
 BLOCKCHAIN CAN STIMULATE BUSINESS IN THE
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
The Internet brought many benefits to the developed
world but brought no contribution to the underdeveloped
world. Technological giants are all concentrated in a very
few countries and the digital divide has not contracted.
The decentralized nature of blockchain can help to
reconfigure business and help society in many ways. It
enables more transparency in voting system, public
capital expenditure, helping the society to build trust 
faster. The World Economic Forum (WEF) considers 
blockchain to be among six computing ‘mega-trends’ that 
are likely to shape the world in the next decade [27].  
Blockchain will allow individuals in different continents 
to conduct business without traditional banking and 
government bureaucracy. It will facilitate interactions, 
creating a strong bond between individuals and investors. 
 MINING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT DRIVER TO THE
NANOTECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY 
The cryptocurrency miners play a key role in blockchain
networks that operates under the Prove-of-Work (PoW)
protocol. Building and chaining the blocks
cryptographically is very computer intensive. Over the
last five years, digital mining hardware changed at least
three times. From computer processing unit (CPU) to
graphical computing unit (GPU), then to field
programmable gate array (FPGA) and more recently to
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology.
Several companies are all trying to create 7nm chips in
mass production. It will most likely be an important game
changer to the mining industry as well to the entire
computer industry [28]. The 7nm chip will bring more
efficiency to energy savings and allow over 20 billion
transistors per square centimetre.
 DAPPS HELPS TO LOWER INITIAL COSTS AND
MAINTENANCE EXPENSES
Open source software leads to cost savings during the
building, implementation, and operational stages.
Traditional methods require payment processing, need of
registration, credentials verification, database, server,
Dapps allow transaction processing automatically on a
decentralized architecture, faster and less costly.
 ABSENCE OF REGULATION FAVORS BLOCKCHAIN 
DEVELOPMENT
Blockchain is not mature, and history shows that
predictions for technologies do no help. The Internet went
through the same learning curve in the 80’s. In the 90s, the
Internet was no comprehended by most of the population.
Adult industry and gambling were a threat by many. No
specific legislation, and intellectual property concerns [29].
E-mail was slowly introduced. Today bills can be paid,
documents can be signed and sent electronically along with
pictures and sound. No one could predict the success or
failure of Internet - until it gradually became a reality. Any
attempts of regulation before the technology is understood
can be detrimental to its development.
 BLOCKCHAIN HELPS & CUSTOMER DATA PROTECTION
Large corporations have not been capable to keep private
information secure. The mistrust is spreading and reaching
new heights. In Dec 2017, the Identity Theft Resource
Centre - ITRC reported that there were 1,293 total data
breaches, compromising more than 174 million records
included business, government, military, health and
banking [30] across the world. That’s 45% increase in
breaches compared to 2016. The society deserves to reap
the benefits of blockchain.

INHIBITORS 
In this section is listed some of most relevant factors delaying 
the deployment of blockchain: 
 LACK OF GOVERNANCE AS A LIABILITY
Historically, governments have been unique in mass trust
production. Through the people representatives who
create the laws and the regulations. These are the legal
consensus for the society, and may change for each
jurisdiction. It does not sound rational that
Cryptocurrencies remain unregulated. Banks and every
financial institution are enforced to follow strict anti-
money laundering and know-your-customer regulations
(AML and KYC). Corporations must pay taxes on their
profits and ensure consistency across a range of
disciplines. On the other hand, some cryptocurrency
advocates seem to broadcast the idea that because
blockchain is decentralized it qualifies itself to be free of
complying with any regulation. Or because blockchain
relies on codes and cryptography, and being stateless, it
implies in no obligation to any government. There are
several flaws in this line of thinking: (a) government
represents the society, (b) the society deserves protection
against digital scammers, (c) protection against black
market payments for unlawful products. Besides
blockchain relies on Internet which can be discretely
controlled by government. By undermining government
regulation, blockchain is creating a false expectation to
society. Blockchain cannot and should not be free from
regulation. Governments will soon interfere and re-
stablish its position to create mass trust.
 SUSTAINABILITY & SCALABILITY LIMITATIONS
Electricity is a key environmental concern in every major
country. High usage of energy resources for no direct
good to the community can be seen as a wastage.
According to recent indicators, Q2_2018, Bitcoin alone is
consuming 70 TW/h [31] which is equivalent to what
countries such as Austria or Chile consumed in 2016 [32].
Considering that Bitcoin processing capabilities averages
3 transactions per second [33], and that Visa averages
1736 transactions per second [34], it is possible to make
an educated estimation that should Bitcoin scale to the
same level of Visa in terms of processing capabilities, it
would be consuming 40,509 TW/H. This is equivalent of
1,127 nuclear plants of the size of Palo Verde, Arizona,
the largest power plant in the USA. It makes no sense that
government continues to subsidy electricity costs for
business that brings no direct good to society.
 ICO PERCEIVED AS A PURE GAME
The fact that cryptocurrencies and ICOs are unregulated,
creates an ideal environment for money laundering and
high-risk gamblers. The volatility of the tokens is easily
fabricated. Bad actors create the ideal condition for selling
and buying tokens and manipulate their values. As tokens
are unregulated, it just becomes a pure game and that’s
the image perceived so far.
 BLOCKCHAIN PERCEIVED AS A BUBBLE 
The volatility, high gains and vulnerabilities are daily
covered in the media. It makes difficult for the public to
differentiate the hype from real. All technicalities, such as 
immutability, decentralization, global consensus, etc. have 
no meaning to most of the public. History shows that the high 
profitability of token is not sustainable. Eventually the hype 
will achieve its plateau, and on the downturn, some players 
will be unhappy. Blockchain is perceived as bubble build out 
of an unregulated game. The bubble effect will have to be 
stopped at same time. 
 USABILITY & MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE LIMITATIONS 
Blockchain conveys some similarity with the Internet in
the early 90’s when a regular user had to undergo 5 to 10
steps until gets the modem connected to an ISP and send
a message. Every cryptocurrency is linked to its own
native blockchain. Each network carries their own rules,
welfares, risks and vulnerabilities. First the new user must
learn about the type of wallets, if a cold, hot or hard
wallet, etc. Next, one needs to sign up with a wallet
service provider and a money exchange service provider.
Then, one needs to learn how to connect and make
transactions. Management of passwords, tokens can be
challenging. It can take a week (or more) until someone
is ready to start using the system. A simple mistake,
passwords can be lost, and funds are gone. In the end, the
new user learns that only a very few merchants accept
cryptocurrencies. The overwhelming information makes
no easy for a new user (or the merchant) to enter the
cryptocurrency’s world.
 DEPENDENCY ON THIRD -PARTIES
It is impracticable to use cryptocurrencies without signing
up with a third party for wallet services or currency
exchange. It involves sending private information, such as
passport numbers, drive license, credit cards, to third
parties which will be then passed to many other parties in
chain. It becomes risky as most of these intermediaries are
small companies, that relies in outsourced databases,
development team, network security, and IT operations to
outsiders. Scandals involving cryptocurrencies are very
common. Most of them related to money exchange and
wallet service providers. Mt. Gox, then the largest
exchange in the world at the time, based in Japan, was
hacked and shut down [35]. Many people lost their money
and many other cases surfaced over the past years. It is
difficult to set up an account, finding a merchant that
accepts crypto payments, difficult to exchange without
facing risks and complexities.
IV. CONCLUSION
     Blockchain is an enabling technology that brings 
insights to new business opportunities in many fronts. It can 
be deployed in business, government, and communities. It 
suits any demand that requires a trusted ledger or P2P 
transaction mechanism. The biggest enabler for blockchain is 
the increased public demand for more effective methods to 
establish trust, increase transparency in the system and 
protect sensitive data. Government and institutions have not 
always been able to protect citizens against misuse of private 
data. Blockchain technology brings a glimpse of hope to end 
users. On the downside, the most inhibitor factors are (i) the 
difficulty in the usability and (ii) the dependency on third 
parties (wallet and money exchange) and (iii) scalability. 
When an exchange service provider (or wallets) is attacked,

it affects the entire community. It causes the snow ball or 
heard effect every time, bringing volatility, bad reputation, 
etc.  
This research focused in three major segments of 
blockchain: (a) cryptocurrencies, (b) utility platform for the 
deployment of decentralized applications and (c) alternative 
business model for start-ups seeking fund raising. 
Nevertheless, in the (a) cryptocurrency space, market growth 
expectation is high; for the moment, as a form of investment 
rather than an alternative for fiat money. New 
cryptocurrencies have been frequently introduced, each one 
offering improvement. Gradually all current limitations will 
be solved and new ones will emerge. Acceptability will 
increase in the same proportion that the technology becomes 
easier to use and less vulnerable. As for the (b) blockchain as 
a utility platform of Dapps, the potential for growth is very 
high. Open sources software helps to lower the initial 
investment and reduce time to market of the product. 
Eventually Dapps will become the preferred option for 
developers. For last, (c) blockchain serving as a business 
model for start-ups, is a very new concept, one that did not 
exist a few years ago. Despite all the hype, risks and benefits 
associated, it is an evolving tool on a very dynamic space. 
One that continuously demands for innovative and bold 
solutions. ICOs, SAFT, ILP provide much faster alternative 
for start-ups seeking to raise funds. Overall, blockchain has 
plenty of room for growth and exploit a range of untapped 
possibilities.
