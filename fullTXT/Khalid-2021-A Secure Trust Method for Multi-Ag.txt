ABSTRACT This paper proposes a blockchain based trust management method for agents in a multi-agent
system (MAS). In this work, three objectives are achieved: trust, cooperation and privacy. The trust of agents
depends on the credibility of trust evaluators, which is verified using the proposedmethods of trust distortion,
consistency and reliability. To enhance the cooperation between agents, a tit-3-for-tat (T3FT) repeated game
strategy is developed. The strategy is more forgiving than the existing tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy. It encourages
cheating agents to re-establish their trust by cooperating for three consecutive rounds of play. Also, a proof-
of-cooperation consensus protocol is proposed to improve agents’ cooperation while creating and validating
blocks. The privacy of agents is preserved in this work using the publicly verifiable secret sharingmechanism.
The proposed methods are implemented using MATLAB R2018a while the MAS is simulated using Java
Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed work.
From the simulation results, the proposed trust method outperforms an existing fuzzy logic trust method in
terms of detecting the cheating behavior of agents in the system. Besides, the proposed T3FT strategy is
effective as compared to the existing tit-for-2-tat and TFT strategies in the literature. Moreover, the security
analysis of the proposed method is performed. The analysis shows that the proposed work is safe from
bad-mouthing and on-off trust related attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. MOTIVATION
In multi-agent system (MAS), agents are concerned about
their privacy and security, which means that revealing their
services to other agents is not appropriate for them. Besides,
data is exchanged on a wide scale. Each agent should avoid
exchanging information with dishonest agents in order to
meet the privacy preservation goals of other agents. The
exchange of information takes place in a high-risk environ-
ment where agents in the system are not indispensable allies.
Also, over time, the relationship of trust between agents may
not be the same as they change their roles in the cooperation
process while limiting access to data. Thus, it is impor-
tant to design a secure system that will encourage agents’
cooperation while ensuring their privacy and trust. The exist-
ing works [1]–[4] propose different mechanisms for the dis-
tributed energy trading (DET), such as price negotiation,
deep participation, bidding and transactive energy manage-
ment in MAS. However, greater attention is needed to ensure
agents’ security, cooperation and trust.
B. LITERATURE REVIEW
Today, DET networks are becoming complex due to the rapid
increase in the number of energy users [5]. MAS offers a
potential solution for a complex network of energy users in
residential sectors, commercial offices, hospital buildings,
etc. It is made up of autonomous agents communicating
with the environment and other agents [6]. MAS has cer-
tain features, such as flexibility, scalability, autonomy, etc.,
which are efficient for optimum energy management in the
smart grids [7]. However, there are problems of security,
privacy and trust between agents in MAS. The authors in [1]
propose a distributed energy trading system with blockchain
that facilitates peer to peer energy trading between agents in
active distribution networks. The proposed system provides
a secure environment for the negotiation of energy trading
contracts between agents in the MAS. However, the nego-
tiation approach becomes time-consuming and cumbersome
as the number of agents increases. Also, agents’ privacy and
trust problems are not resolved. In [2], an agent based coordi-
nation strategy is proposed, which integrates price response
from DET in the coordination process. The proposed strategy
minimizes the energy imbalance and maximizes the profit of
each agent. However, problems of trust, privacy and security
of agents are not addressed. The authors in [3] propose a
transactive energy trading system for agents in the MAS.
In the system, a reinforcement learning method is used to
design the bidding market strategies for the agents. However,
the problems of privacy and trust of agents are not resolved.
The authors in [4] propose a transactive energy management
system for agents in the main grid. The system resolves the
problems of energy cost optimization and overloading of the
grid. However, the problems of trust, privacy and security of
agents are not addressed.
Nowadays, blockchain can provide a secure and decentral-
ized framework for autonomous agents. It is also used to pro-
tect agents and enhance their trust in MAS [1]. However, it is
vulnerable to malicious peers that degrade the effectiveness
of the systems. Contrarily, agents can exchange information
about their interactions with other agents in order to decrease
the activities of malicious agents [8]. Moreover, trust factors
can reduce the cost effect and uncertainty during decision
making. Trust values tvs can be calculated directly by an agent
or obtained from a third party. Without the trust manage-
ment system (TMS), tvs may be manipulated by an evalu-
ator, i.e., an agent that estimates the worth of another agent
(known as evaluatee). Thus, making trust decision inaccurate.
Several traditional methods like cryptographic mechanisms
have been deployed to protect the tvs of users. However,
these mechanisms alone cannot solve the internal credibility

problems of agents in heterogeneous systems. Access control
methods have been adopted to restrict unauthorized agents
from accessing tvs. However, these methods are centralized,
which make them unsuitable for a distributed environment.
Also, they are inefficient to handle the dynamic behavior
of agents. The authors in [9] present a research study on
trust mechanisms based on blockchain web technology for
big data. In the study, different trust calculation methods are
discussed, such as the weighted average method, Bayesian,
fuzzy reasoning method, etc. Table 1 provides a comparative
analysis of the proposed scheme with other existing schemes
in terms of energy trading, objectives, methods, privacy, trust,
cooperation and security.
C. CONTRIBUTIONS
This work is an extension of [8]. In [8], a consortium
blockchain based trust management system (BTMS) is pro-
posed, which consists of two layers: upper and lower. The for-
mer is used for verifying the credibility of agents. Whereas,
the latter allows an agent to perform direct trust (DT) and
recommended trust (RT) evaluation of other agents during
interactions using the weighted trust average method. How-
ever, the problems of agent to agent cooperation, privacy and
trust management are not addressed. This paper provides a
service to the DET network with each energy user participat-
ing as an agent in MAS. The service provided is a BTMS,
which enhances trust, cooperation, privacy and security of
the involved agents. The main contributions of this paper are
presented as follows.
1) This study proposes three trust credibility methods:
distortion, consistency and reliability. The methods
are used to verify the trust evaluation from different
evaluators.
2) A repeated game is introduced to model the interac-
tions of agents in order to achieve an efficient agent
to agent cooperation. A tit-3-for-tat (T3FT) strategy is
proposed, which allows cheating agents to effectively
regain the trust if they cooperate thrice in a row as
compared to the existing tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy [10].
3) A publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS)mechanism
is employed to ensure privacy and security of the trust
evaluation.
4) A proof-of-cooperation (PoC) consensus protocol is
proposed in the consortium blockchain network. The
protocol is used for the selection of miners and valida-
tion of blocks. It also enhances agents’ cooperation.
5) This study analyzes two trust related attacks:
bad-mouthing and on-off. In the analysis, it is shown
that the proposed system is protected from the attacks.
The remaining paper is organized as follows. Section II pro-
vides the proposed system model, and the problem is formu-
lated in Section III. Section IV presents a security analysis of
the proposed system, and Section V provides simulation and
discussion of results while Section VI concludes the paper.
II. PROPOSED SYSTEM MODEL
In Fig. 1, agents are household energy prosumers that locally
produce and consume energy, and also exchange trust evalu-
ation values with the aggregators. They can efficiently utilize
the harvested solar energy and control the operational status.
Based on the energy information from the smart meters,
the energy deficient agents fulfill the energy requirements
from other agents having surplus energy. In this way, a DET
environment is established. Moreover, if the demand for
energy deficient agents cannot be fulfilled by DET, the exact
amount of energy is purchased from the grid. Once the
energy trading agreement is established, the involved agents
securely send the agreement information to the corresponding
aggregators through the blockchain. According to the traded
amount of energy, the aggregators control the required energy
output to satisfy the energy demand of agents. Note that this
paper considers the trust state of each agent. However, data
loss, line interruption, noise and delay of the proposed system
are not considered. They will be considered in the future.
The BTMS proposed in Fig. 1 addresses the problem of
feedback sparseness in an existing system [11]. Initially,
an agent’s DT and RT for trust evaluation are considered.
Then, the trust is evaluated using the overall adaptive weight
of the combined trust evaluation from different evaluators.

FIGURE 1. The Proposed system model consists of household prosumers
that trade energy with each other via DET. Moreover, the identified
limitations are denoted by L1-L3, which are directly mapped to the
proposed solutions, denoted by S1-S3.
This depends on the frequency of interactions between the
evaluators and evaluatees, the number of interactions and
the credibility of the evaluators [11]. Next, the credibility
of the evaluator is evaluated after each interaction with the
evaluatee based on the methods of consistency, distortion and
reliability. Besides, all of the agents have a token, known as a
balanced trust incentive (BTI) unit, which is used to interact
with other agents. BTI is increased if the credibility evalu-
ation of agents is positive, which shows that the evaluators
are honest and vice versa. Moreover, credibility evaluation is
used to detect both the honest and dishonest behavior of the
evaluators in the proposed system.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In conventional trust evaluation methods, DT plays a major
role in evaluating users. In DT evaluation, the evaluator has a
direct encounter with the evaluatee and gives the DT value
between 0 and 1. Where 0 represents dishonest behavior
and 1 represents honest behavior. Note that DT boundary
is based on the generalized trust evaluation methods that
are commonly used in the research community [11]. How-
ever, DT is prone to feedback sparseness and malicious
attacks [12]. Also, DT evaluation methods that consider the
average of direct evaluation value are prone to misjudgement
as time relevance is not considered. Nonetheless, DT evalua-
tion methods that combine different weights to determine the
dynamic change of evaluatees’ behavior are not sufficient to
handle the evaluators’ credibility [11]. This paper resolves the
aforementioned problems by proposing credibility evaluation
methods and blockchain. The subsections below discuss the
proposed credibility evaluation methods.
1) TRUST DISTORTION
Trust distortion is a change that alters the actual tv. The
degree of trust distortion TDi of an evaluator i is calculated
as the actual tv that is distorted by a random distribution rate.
If the evaluator i makes a dishonest evaluation, TDi is used
to determine the evaluator’s degree of dishonesty. Therefore,
TDi is formulated based on our scenario as
TDi = βtvd{i}, (1)
where tvd{i} is the distorted tv of i and β ∈ [0, 1] is the
randomly chosen sensitivity parameter of TDi that regulates
the rate of distortion.
2) TRUST CONSISTENCY
If an evaluator i finishes interaction with an evaluatee j,
it sends a feedback to the aggregator. Afterwards, aggregator
calculates the trust consistency TC{i,j} value of i. TC{i,j} is
used to measure the degree of similarity between the present
feedback fp1 and the past feedback fp2 about jwithin the range
of [−1, 1]. Where 1 represents that fp1 is similar to fp2 and
−1 denotes that the fp1 is dissimilar to fp2.
s(i) = 2
( fp1 − fp2
max(fp1, fp2)
)2
− 4|
fp1 − fp2
max(fp1, fp2)
| + 1, (2)
Eq. (2) is the similarity value, which is a modification of [13].
Unlike the range approach used in [13] that does not calculate
the spread of majority values in feedback data, a maximum
value between fp1 and fp2 is considered in this paper. Thus,
the trust consistency is calculated as
TC{i,j} = α
( 1
s(i)
exp−
1
s(i)
)
, (3)
where α ∈ [0, 1] is the sensitivity parameter that determines
the weight of TC{i,j}.
3) TRUST RELIABILITY
Trust reliability is achieved when the trust evaluation is suf-
ficient and error-free to meet the trust evidence. Given these
two factors, TDi and TC{i,j}, the trust reliability formulation
TR{i,j} is derived as [13]
TR{i,j} = γ (1− TDi)+ TC{i,j}. (4)
γ ∈ [0, 1] is the sensitivity parameter that determines the
weight of TR{i,j} where α+ β + γ = 1. TDi and TR{i,j} range
between 0 and 1, whereas TC{i,j} ranges between 1 and −1.
It implies that the system can sustain the trust evaluation from
both honest and dishonest agents.
4) TRUST UPDATE
In the trust update process, unauthorized modification of
the trust evaluation is prevented. It implies that the final
trust decisions are authenticated and validated by miners,
i.e., nodes with high credibility. After validation is com-
pleted, the accepted trust evaluation is encapsulated into the
blockchain by aggregators.

A. REPEATED GAME THEORY FOR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM
IN THE SMART GRIDS
BTMS is based on game theory that enhances the cooperative
behavior of agents. It is observed that in a MAS environ-
ment, the assumptions, such as rationality and maximiza-
tion required to achieve convergence are ignored. Also, new
complexities may arise if the agents share and learn new
strategies in a non-dynamic environment. Even if the objec-
tives of agents are aligned and all agents hope to maximize
their utilities, cooperation is needed to attain global optimum.
We consider the dynamic environment in which agents can
cooperate to achieve their goals. However, complexities exist
when multiple decisions are needed by the agents. These
complexities may involve insufficient information about the
system. Two rationalities of the agents are considered in
this paper: agents who cooperate and agents who refuse to
cooperate. The sole aim of BTMS is to ensure that all agents
must cooperate. The game theory provides the interactions
between self-interested agents and also examines the strategy
that maximizes their utilities. Some basic definitions of game
theory are provided as follows [14]. Note that the proofs given
in this paper are the deductive reasoning about the defined
assumptions.
Definition 1 (Game Theory): A normal form of a game is
a triad, denoted by G = {n, ϒ,ψn}∀n ∈ N where N is the
set of agents, ϒ is the set of possible strategies that the agent
selects and ψn is the expected utility function for agent n. For
each agent, the choice of the utility function is determined by
the strategy set of agent n and other agents [14].
Definition 2 (Best Response): For each agent, an optimal
strategy υ∗n is chosen according to the best responses of
all other agents, expressed as ψ∗n ≥ ψn. Where ψ∗n is the
maximum utility function of the agent n.
Definition 3 (Nash Equilibrium): ϒ is said to be in Nash
equilibrium (NE) if for each agent, υ∗n is the best response to
the agents’ strategy.
In NE, no agent in the game can improve its utility
one-sidedly by diverging from the set of equilibrium strate-
gies. Thus, no agent has an incentive to change its strategy
unless all of the agents have to change their strategies con-
currently in order to overcome NE.
In MAS, due to the problems of limited resources and
privacy requirement of each agent, most of the agents have
selfish behavior orientations. The game becomes a prisoner’s
dilemma if the agents refuse to cooperate [14]. In this paper,
the trust evaluation of agents is considered as a repeated
game. The design requirements of the game consist of ratio-
nal agents that perform DT evaluation of other agents or
request RT evaluation of other agents from their aggregators.
A dynamic time is considered to set up the system and
for each time slot t , a T3FT strategy is established, which
instantly punishes the agents that engage in cheating. The
agents that cheat can re-establish the trust if they cooperate
for three consecutive plays.We consider the case when agents
establish a single-shot game to achieve their cooperation.
In the cooperative game G = {n, ϒ,ψn}, the strategies that
each agent selects are defined asϒ = {cooperate, refuse} and
the utility function of the agent n in a game at t is defined as
ψn(t) =
(
0θ − ξrw
)
ν, (5)
where 0 is the absolute worth of the trust evaluation and
θ is the impact factor of the trust evaluation such that
θ ∈ [0, 1]. ξ is the payment for each evaluation message and
ν = RCV +ACrw is the number of trust evaluation messages
required by the aggregators. RC is the number of rejected
cooperation of agent n, whereas AC denotes the number of
accepted cooperation of agent n. V is the cost of a privacy
breach when agent n refuses to cooperate and rw is the reward
given to agent n for cooperating.
In the repeated game, when the agents refuse to cooperate
at t , then in the subsequent time slots, other agents do not
cooperate with them. Here, a T3FT strategy is used, which
provides instant punishment and the length of the punishment
depends on the agents’ cooperation. The defaulter agents
may regain their trust after cooperating for three consecutive
periods. Afterwards, their cheating behavior is pardoned [14].
Definition 4: Let the expected time an agent will coop-
erate be k . If the expected payoff or benefit is linear in the
agent’s strategy, the overall expected benefit of the agent in
the game at t is expressed as [14]
Un(t) =
k∑
t=1
σψn(t), (6)
where σ is the discount factor such that 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1.
The value of σ is larger if each agent stays longer in
the cooperation. Otherwise, the value of σ will be smaller.
Thus, σ = 1
k −
1
k+y where y is the expected time the
cheating agent will re-establish the trust by cooperating. The
agents in our proposed system exhibit different strategies:
always cooperating, always cheating and T3FT. In T3FT, it is
assumed that the agents always start the game by accepting
the cooperation strategy. For each time slot, an agent not
only plays the game with other agents, but also learns their
strategies. If an agent earns more BTIs in the last play, other
agents can copy the strategy in order to enhance their utilities.
A certain probability may be considered to learn the behavior
of other agents.
B. EQUILIBRIUM OF GAME
After getting the strategies of all of the agents, the equilibrium
of the game is important to determine the optimal rw of each
agent. The stability of NE is defined as follows.
Definition 5 (Stability of NE): A NE is said to be stable if
a small change δ in the probabilities of an agent raises two
conditions.
1) In a new situation, any agent that cooperates has no
better strategy.
2) Any agent that does not cooperate is playing with a
much worse strategy.
If conditions (1) and (2) hold, the agent will move
towards NE, which means that NE is stable. Conversely, if (1)
59852 VOLUME 9, 2021
R. Khalid et al.: Secure Trust Method for MAS in Smart Grids Using Blockchain
does not hold, NE is unstable. However, if only (1) holds,
there will be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the
agents that do not cooperate. In this study, we consider the
derivation of ψn with respect to rw and equating it to zero in
order to get the optimum reward rw∗.

rw∗ =
0θAC − ξRCV
2ξAC
, (9)
δ2ψn
δrw2 = −2ξAC . (10)
The second derivative of Eq. (8) given in Eq. (10) means that
the rw∗ is the local maximum.Here, the constraint is rw∗ ≥ 0.
If rw∗ < 0, the maximizing rw is zero. Two cases are defined
from the lower bound on rw as follows.
1) If 0θAC > ξRCV , the amount of reward that max-
imizes the utility ψn is rw∗. By substituting rw∗ in
Eq. (7), the maximum utility ψ∗n of the agents is
obtained. The agent will accept the utility if ψ∗n ≥ 0.
2) If 0θAC < ξRCV , rw∗ = 0, which gives the agent the
maximum utility ψn. The agent will accept the utility
if ψn ≥ 0.
C. BLOCKCHAIN BASED TRUST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In BTMS, a smart contract is proposed to implement the
trust evaluation module (TEM). TEM ensures consistency in
the operations of the agents. It includes three phases: trust
evaluation collection, trust uploading, and miner selection
and block creation. The important part of TEM is the account
and memory creation. All of the agents have accounts that
store BTI transaction data in the account pool while BTIs’
addresses are stored in the memory pool. Besides, the mem-
ory pool is mapped to the account pool for achieving an
efficient data audit. Before performing the trust evaluation of
an agent, the aggregator must verify that it has enough BTIs.
1) TRUST EVALUATION COLLECTION
In this phase, tvs are initially generated either via DT or RT.
Afterwards, the generated tvs are checked for trust credibility
using the methods of TDi, TC{i,j} and TR{i,j}. If the credibility
checking process is passed, the tv cannot be locally stored and
managed. Instead, it is uploaded to the blockchain. Before
uploading trust evaluation values to the blockchain, PVSS is
used. Secret sharing is established to protect sensitive infor-
mation from unauthorized users in the field of information
security [15]. Sensitive information includes cryptographic
keys and shares. In secret sharing, three actors, such as deal-
ers, participants and combiner are considered. In this study,
dealers, also known as blockchain miners, are authorized to
distribute shares to the participants. In this study, shares refer
to the tvs, whereas the secret refers to the cryptographic keys.
However, the dealers are not authorized to store shares and
secrets. Participants represent the agents that store shares and
secrets given to them by the dealers. Combiner is known as
the aggregator and is authorized to define a threshold, collect
and reconstruct shares of the participants. Also, the combiner
can be any participant in the system. Moreover, in an existing
scheme [15], Shamir secret sharing is adopted so that the
collected shares from fewer agents cannot reveal information
about the secret. In this paper, PVSS [16] is employed to
detect cheaters who are either dealers, combiner or partici-
pants. In verifiable secret sharing (VSS), the tvs for the agents
represent the secret shared between them. Moreover, a secret
sharing is PVSS if it is a VSS scheme that allows any entity,
not necessarily the participants to verify the validity of the
shares delivered by the dealer. Besides, VSS allows a dealer
to distribute the secret Sz between the agents. To distribute the
secret Sz into z shares, a z − 1 ordered polynomial function
Pp is required. The shares are calculated as rz = Pp(x) for
x 6= 0. The pair (x, rz) is sent to the agents. Here, Sz = Pp(0).
Moreover, z shares (x, rz) is required to recover Pp and also
find the secret Sz = Pp(0). The ordered polynomial Pp is
defined as [15]
Pp(x) = az−1xz−1 + az−1xz−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 (mod p),
(11)
where x is an indeterminate variable of Pp, p is any large
prime number that is selected and for each ai ∈ Pp; 0 ≤
i ≤ z − 1, az−1 6= 0. The secret is Pp(0) = a0. In order
to perform secret sharing as (z, n) threshold sharing, n shares
are calculated for each randomly chosen n points (x; 1 ≤
i ≤ n and x 6= 0 ∈ Pp), which is distributed to the
agent n. A verifiable hash function, denoted as Hash(x, rz),
is encrypted and the result is broadcast across the blockchain
network. Moreover, the share is recovered using the method
of Lagrange interpolation [15].
2) TRUST UPLOADING
The agents’ credibility values of the trust evaluation are
verified based on the methods of TDi, TC{i,j} and TR{i,j}.
Each agent is authorized to upload the encrypted DT eval-
uation values to the blockchain. The credibility of each agent
depends on its cooperation. Once an agent does not cooperate,
the T3FT strategy is enforced.
3) BLOCK CREATION AND MINER SELECTION
In BTMS, all miners are periodically elected from the agents
to generate a new block. Here, the PoC consensus protocol
is proposed for the validation and mining of the block. The
cooperation of agents is supported by a set of cooperation
credit (CoC) also known as the benefit factor in the repeated
game. CoC is added to the BTI of an agent that cooperates and
is dynamically determined by the cooperative factor defined
as
CFn =
k∗
k + k∗
, (12)
where k∗ is the average expected time in which an agent
stays longer in the network by cooperating. The election of

miners is based on the number of commitments to cooperate
and the number of BTIs in their wallet accounts. A round-
robin mechanism is used to select the leader, known as an
aggregator, between agents with the equal worth of BTIs and
the number of commitments. Algorithm 1 is the proposed
smart contract. The algorithm is deployed on the blockchain.
A unique identifier (IDn) is assigned to all agents. Also,
they are given token accounts and wallet addresses, and all
transactions are stored in the blockchain using the commit
method. In the algorithm, the agents send the hash string of
their strategies and a random number to the blockchain. The
hash function provides a one-way property, which is only
known to the agents. With PVSS, the strategy of an agent
cannot be revealed to unauthorized agents in the blockchain.
IV. SECURITY ANALYSIS
The proposed system aims to achieve a secure trust evaluation
information of each agent. Besides, the proposed system is
safe from external attacks due to the underlying security
benefits of the blockchain technology, such as confidentiality,
integrity and privacy of agents’ data. However, the system
is not safe from internal attacks, which is the focus of this
study. Considering the internal attacks of the proposed sys-
tem, the agent can behave either as honest or cheater during
the interaction process. Moreover, the security objectives to
be achieved in this study are described as follows.
1) Transparency: The trust evaluation mechanism is
known to all of the agents in the system. Besides,
the repeated game and the PVSSmechanism are known
to the agents. This prevents an adversary from manip-
ulating the tvs.
2) Verifiability: PVSS mechanism exposes cheaters.
It also permits the combiner to reconstruct the shares
and secrets.
3) Fairness: Based on the PoC consensus protocol, all
agents trust each other and have an equal chance of
being selected as the combiner.
4) Privacy: If the three objectives given above are fulfilled,
privacy preservation for all of the agents is ensured
using PVSS.
Theorem 1: If an adversary intercepts less than z−1 shares
constructed by Pp, the entire message cannot be correctly
reconstructed by it.
Proof 1: Suppose that there is an adversary who initially
intercepts and decrypts the shares of z − 1 generated by Pp.
Then, the adversary is required to solve Pp that constructs
the shares in order to reconstruct a message. If the adversary
cannot reconstruct the message from the shares of z − 1,
the set of shares less than z − 1 cannot be reconstructed by
the adversary.
Definition 6: Let F(i, j) be a tuple that represents the ith
evaluator and jth evaluatee such that F(i, j) = {tv,TC{i,j}}.
An interaction between i and j holds if:
TC{i,j} =

1, if the interaction happens honestly,
0, if the interaction does not happen,
−1, if the interaction involves a cheater.
Theorem 2: Suppose that ith evaluator provides a dishon-
est trust evaluation of jth evaluatee, then the proposed system
is vulnerable to bad-mouthing attack.
Proof 2: It is assumed that jth evaluatee may have a
past encounter with other evaluators that provide their trust
evaluation’s feedback to the blockchain. Since j has multiple
evaluators and using DT and RT evaluation methods, the

bad-mouthing attack is prevented. Moreover, this attack
occurs when an agent provides a dishonest
recommendation [17].
Theorem 3: At any time t , an evaluator i acts honestly, and
at t + 1, it acts maliciously by concealing its activities. Thus,
the system is vulnerable to an on-off attack.
Proof 3: At the time t , an evaluator provides an honest
trust evaluation of an evaluatee. Whereas at t + 1, it behaves
maliciously by providing a dishonest trust evaluation of that
evaluatee with the hope that it will not be detected [18].
To address this type of attack, once the malicious node is
detected, its BTI is completely reduced to 0. It implies that
such evaluator can no longer participate in the interaction
process with other evaluatees.
V. SIMULATION AND RESULTS
In this section, the proposed MAS is simulated using the
Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) [19] while
simulation of the proposed methods are performed using
MATLAB R018a. The proposed system is implemented on a
personal computer furnished with Intel i5 quad-core proces-
sor having 1.60 GHz speed and 8 GB RAM. The parameters
used for the simulations are given in Table 2, which are
taken from [8], [20] and [21]. The following limitations are
addressed in this section: L1: lack of trust, L2: cooperation
problem and L3: privacy problem.
TABLE 2. Parameters used for simulation.
A. SCENARIO OF THE EXPERIMENT
Motivated by the work of [20], the proposed T3FT strategy
is designed. The iterated prisoner’s dilemma strategy where
the agents are either always cooperating or always cheating is
also considered. Tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy allows an agent to
choose the exact action as other agents did in the last round.
Moreover, tit-for-2-tat (TF2T) strategy is derived from the
TFT strategy and it allows an agent to always cheat if the other
agents cheat twice in a row [20]. In the prisoner’s dilemma
strategy, two possibilities are considered: cooperate (C) and
cheat, i.e., defect (D). To encourage the cooperative behavior
of agents, certain benefits are awarded to them. If the agents
decide to cooperate, they earn rewards rw; otherwise, they
are punished (P). If an agent decides to cheat another agent
that cooperates, the agent that cooperates gets the ‘‘sucker’’
payoff (S), whereas the agent that cheats gets the maximum
temptation (T). The parameters used for the repeated game
are given in Table 2. From the table, the maximum number
of iterations is denoted by Tmax, the probability of migrating
from one coalition to another is denoted by q. We consider
the migration radius as rad and the probability of an agent to
imitate another agent is denoted by p.
B. TRUST EVALUATION
The validations of the proposed solutions to L1 are presented
in this subsection. The performance evaluation of agents
concerning DT and RT is compared with an existing scheme
of [21].
In Fig. 2, it is observed that both DT and RT have different
values for each agent. In this paper, we consider 7 agents
for the performance evaluation. It is also observed that the
proposed DT has the least scores for agent-2 and agent-6 as
compared to the work done in [21]. The least scores occur
as a result of the weighted average method, whereas the
work of [21] uses a fuzzy logic trust model. Moreover, our
proposed method has also achieved the least scores for the RT
as compared to the fuzzy logic model for all of the agents.
FIGURE 2. Evaluation of RT and DT by different schemes.
Fig. 3 shows the effect of sensitive parameter β on TDi as
the number of interactions increases. β is a weighted value
that adjusts the convergence rate of TDi. For the analysis,
three values of β, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, are considered. If the TDi
scores converge to 0, it implies that there is a higher degree
of distortion in tvs. Contrarily, if the TDi scores converge
to 1, it means that there is no distortion in tvs. To analyze
the degree of TDi, different β values show distinct behavior
of the evaluators. It is observed that for a larger value of β,
convergence is fast and stable, whereas for a smaller value
of β, convergence is slow and unstable. For simplicity, if the
degree of distortion is high, it means that the evaluators make
a dishonest evaluation. On the other hand, if the degree of
distortion is low, it indicates that the evaluators are honest
with their evaluation.
Fig. 4 shows the effect of α on TC{i,j} as the number of
interactions increases. The sensitive parameter α is used to
measure the degree of how consistent two trust feedback
values from the same evaluator are. If the consistency score
is 1, it implies that the two feedback values are similar.
Otherwise, if the consistency score is −1, it means that the
two feedback values are dissimilar. Two cases are considered

FIGURE 4. Effect of α on consistency.
in this study. The first case considers TC{i,j} from the honest
agents and the second case considers TC{i,j} from dishonest
agents, which are known as cheaters. The cheaters are agents
who behave dishonestly by manipulating their trust evalu-
ation values and also refuse to cooperate. Three values of
α, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, are considered for both cases. For the
honest agents, the TC{i,j} values start from 0 and converge
to 1. It implies that the honest agents provide two similar
feedback values. Moreover, a larger value of α attains fast
convergence to 1, whereas a smaller value of α shows slow
convergence to 1. For the cheaters, the TC{i,j} values start
from 0.1 and converge to −1. It means that the system can
detect cheaters based on their feedback values that are not
similar.
Fig. 5 shows two feedback values, which are denoted by
fp1 and fp2 obtained from the same evaluator. A Wilcoxon
signed-rank test is employed to analyze the similarity
between the two feedback values [22]. It is also used to
determine whether the two feedback values are selected from
the same distribution or not. It is obvious from the figure that
the two feedback values are not evenly distributed. It implies
that there is trust inconsistency between the two feedback
values.
In Fig. 6, the effect of γ on TR{i,j} as the number of
interactions increases is shown. The sensitive parameter γ

FIGURE 6. Effect of γ on reliability.
is the weighted value that adjusts the rate of convergence
for TR{i,j}. Considering the condition α + β + γ = 1, we set
some sensitivity parameters equal to one another. Moreover,
a larger parameter value is considered for γ . It is observed
that a larger value of γ gives higher TR{i,j}. On the other hand,
a smaller value of γ provides lower TR{i,j}. The TR{i,j} score
tells us about the usability of the trust evaluation. Fig. 6 shows
that TR{i,j} depends on both TDi and TC{i,j}. If TDi is low
and TC{i,j} is high, it ensures higher TR{i,j}. However, if both
TDi and consistency are low, TR{i,j} is moderate. On the other
hand, if TDi is high and TC{i,j} is low, TR{i,j} is weak.
C. EVALUATION OF THE REPEATED GAME STRATEGY
In this subsection, the validations of the proposed solutions to
L2 are discussed. The proposed T3FT strategy is compared
with existing strategies: TF2T, TFT [23], always cooperating
and always cheating [20]. We analyze the utility of each agent
that chooses to cooperate as shown in Fig. 7. From the figure,
it is seen that the agents that implement our proposed T3FT
strategy get the highest utility than those that consider other
strategies: TF2T, TFT, always cooperating and always cheat-
ing. It is also observed that the agents who do not cooperate,
get the least utility. It implies that the BTIs of such agents are
reduced in the blockchain and they cannot participate with
other agents in the future.Moreover, the agents may adopt our

FIGURE 7. Comparison of the proposed strategy with other existing
strategies based on utility.
proposed strategy in order to renew the trust by cooperating
for three consecutive plays.
In Fig. 8, it is observed that our proposed T3FT strategy
outperforms the other strategies with the highest number of
agents. Moreover, for each time slot, agents that adopt the
proposed T3FT strategy are 23.22% as compared to 18.70%
for TF2T and 19.48% for TFT strategy. Contrarily, the num-
ber of agents that always cheat is more than those that always
cooperate. It implies that the existing TF2T, TFT, always
cooperating and always cheating strategies are not suitable for
our proposed scenario. Hence, our proposed T3FT strategy
provides remedies for the limitations of TF2T, TFT, always
cooperating and always cheating strategies. Fig. 9 shows the
strategy of the agents for 100 iterations. According to Fig. 8
and Fig. 9, the agents who implement the proposed T3FT
strategy are represented by magenta color and those which
implement TFT and TF2T strategies are represented by red
and blue color, respectively. From the figures, it is observed
that the agents with magenta color are more than the agents
with red or blue color. It implies that more agents implement
our proposed T3FT strategy.
We validate the solutions to L3 using the PVSS mecha-
nism and consortium blockchain. PVSS is used to protect the
shares of agents from unauthorized agents, whereas consor-
tium blockchain limits the number of agents in the network.
It implies that the proposed system prevents an adversary
from direct access to the agents’ shares.
D. MAPPING OF PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSED
SOLUTIONS
In this subsection, we show that the identified limitations are
mapped to the proposed solutions and then validated by the

simulation results. Table 3 provides detailed information on
how the solutions are mapped to the identified limitations and
how they are validated.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, three problems are addressed for agents inMAS.
Firstly, the lack of trust between agents is addressed by the
proposed method of trust credibility. The trust credibility
values of the evaluators are validated based on the methods
of TDi, TC{i,j} and TR{i,j}. Secondly, the problem of agents’
cooperation is resolved using the proposed T3FT strategy.
The strategy enables the agents to renew their trust if they
cooperate for three continuous periods of the game. Thirdly,
the problem of privacy of the agents is solved through the
blockchain and PVSS mechanism. Besides, a PoC consensus

protocol is proposed to enable the efficient selection ofminers
for block creation and validation. Simulations are performed
to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. From
the results, it is observed that TR{i,j} depends on TDi and
TC{i,j}. Also, the proposed trust method outperforms the
fuzzy logic method in terms of efficient detection of mali-
cious agents’ behavior. Moreover, the number of agents that
adopt the proposed T3FT strategy is 23.22% as compared
to 18.70% for the TF2T strategy and 19.48% for the TFT
strategy. It implies that more agents are willing to cooperate
in order to maintain their trust after behaving selfishly. Also,
the agents that implement the T3FT strategy get more utility
from the cooperation. Furthermore, security analysis shows
that the proposed system is able to circumvent bad-mouthing
and on-off trust related attacks.
The robustness of the proposed PoC consensus protocol
will be thoroughly investigated in the future to increase net-
work throughput. We intend to propose a blockchain based
coalition formulation protocol in the MAS, which is not
exhaustively addressed in the literature.
