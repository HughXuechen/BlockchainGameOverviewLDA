Abstract
This research shows a Viable Supply Chain with Vendor Managed Inventory approach by
consideringBlockchain, Risk, andRobustness.We embeddedBlockchain Technology (BCT)
to improve SC agility. To tackle risk and robustness, we suggest a new objective function
with the weighted expected value, worst case, and Entropic Value at Risk for considering risk
and robustness under different scenarios. This model is Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,
and GAMS-Bonmin is utilized to solve it. The case study of this research is on the Pharmacy
industry.We compare problems in the situation with BCT andwithout BCT. The results show
that the cost function of the main problemwithout BCT is greater than the same problemwith
BCT, and its gaps are 0.61%. Finally, the cost function increase by increasing the conservative
coefficient and decreasing the resiliency coefficient. The cost function reduces by increasing
the confidence level. We change the scale of the problem and define problems. By increasing
the scale of the problem, the solution time increased.

1 Introduction
The Viable Supply Chain (VSC) is a new concept in the SC area that considers sustainability,
agility and resiliency (cf. Fig. 1) (Ivanov, 2020; Lotfi, Nazarpour, Gharehbaghi, Sarkhosh,
& Khanbaba, 2022c). Managers pay more attention to the resiliency and flexibility of SC
regarding COVID-19. Resilience SC means the capacity to recover quickly after disruption
(Lotfi, Kargar, Hoseini, et al., 2021b). In addition, the requirements of governments and

people that apply sustainability and green concept make better performance and improve the
environmental behavior of the SC. The vital point of agility is to deliver products and ser-
vices as soon as possible with minimum delay and satisfy demand. The best agility inventory
method is VendorManaged Inventory (VMI) approach. The VMI approach is where theman-
ufacturer, vendor (or supplier) takes control of the seller’s or retailer’s inventory management
decisions (Fakhrzad & Lotfi, 2018). It means that suppliers are responsible for optimizing the
inventory. Therefore, defining VSC with the VMI approach by considering risk and robust-
ness is the best way to consider resiliency, sustainability and agility. Although, using novel
technology like Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Internet of Things (IoT) increases agility
and sustainability (Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; Ruel, El Baz, Ivanov, & Das, 2021).
BCT help to clear transaction between the pillar of SC and decrease variable cost. There-
fore, applying VMI and BCT in VSC improves performance and increases SC resiliency for
disruption and demand fluctuation (Lotfi, Safavi, et al., 2021b).
The main contribution and motivation of this study are as follows:
1. VSC with VMI approach,
2. Considering risk and robustness,
3. Applying BCT in VSC as an agility approach.
We try to design a novel VSC that applies the VMI approach and BCT together. Further,
we paymore attention to the VMI approach as the best way tomanage the inventory system to
improve costs. Also, applying BCT is an excellent way to provide agility for this SC to create
transparency in the transaction. In addition, we want to embed environmental and social
impact in this research. As a result, VSC is the best method for sustainability, resiliency, and
agility. Finally, the importance and necessity of proposing this research and gap research are
understood. As a result, we suggest a systematic and mathematical model for designing the
best SC for managing inventory, assets, and transparency in the transaction by considering

risks and robustness. Regarding disruptions, we should evaluate risk and robustness for
decreasing fluctuation and robustify the model against a complex situation.
We organized this paper as follows. Section 2 reviews relatedwork SC andVMI and shows
gap research in this scope. In Sect. 3, we determine a VSCVMI approach. In Sect. 4, the
findings and results of the proposed model with sensitivity analysis are explained. In Sect. 5,
the managerial insights are presented. In Sect. 6, the conclusion and outlook are drawn.
2 Related work
In this section, we survey related work about VMI in SC. The researchers develop many
contributions to this issue. However, there are many research gaps in this issue; we suggested
a VSC with VMI approach by considering BCT, Risk, and Robustness (VSCVMIBRR).
2.1 Application of VMI in SC
PRAMUDYO and Luong (2017) proposed a VMI problem in one vendor-one retailer
with stochastic demand. They embedded Simulation–Optimization using Genetic Algorithm
(SOGA) to solve the model. They analyzed the effects of holding costs on vendors, retailers,
and lost sales. Fakhrzad and Lotfi (2018) developed a green SC with VMI and backorder
policy and compared it with the traditional inventory. Because the model is nonlinear pro-
gramming, they used ε-constraint for small scale and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (NSGA-II) approach for large scale. Weraikat et al. (2019) improved the perfor-
mance of a pharmaceutical SC through a VMI system. They suggested the VMI approach to
enhance the inventory of medications in hospitals.
Gharaei et al. (2019) presented a SC under penalty, green, and quality control policies and
a VMIwith a consignment stock agreement. They proposed an optimal batch-sizing policy in
an integrated multiproduct-constrained supply chain. They utilized the outer approximation
with equality relaxation and the Augmented Penalty Algorithm (APA) for optimal batch
sizing. Wettasinghe and Luong (2020) presented a VMI policy with emergency orders. They
studied two approaches; approach one used the concept of demand rate, while approach two
was based on total demand received during the cycle. Jamshidpour Poshtahani andPasandideh
(2020) designed a SCwith a green VMI problem. They suggested a bi-objective multiproduct
with a single-vendor single-buyer based on the economic production quantity (EPQ) model.
They added Green House Gas Emissions (GHGs) as a second objective function. They
implemented Lp-metric, Goal attainment and multi-choice goal programming with utility
function (MCGP-U).
De Giovanni (2021) proposed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a dynamic brick-and-
mortar SC to improve the efficiency of VMI. They used a SC game with Stackelberg format
to obtain optimal cost between players. Gharaei, Karimi, and Hoseini Shekarabi (2021)
proposed a VMI with joint replenishment planning for SC. They used generalized Ben-
ders Decomposition (BD) under the separability approach to solve the model. They used a
penalty approach to penalize the supplier if the inventory products exceeded the certain upper
bound by the VMI contract. Weißhuhn and Hoberg (2021) developed a VMI approach with
smart replenishment systems and Internet-of-Things technology. They model with a single
manufacturer and multi-customers. Maximum inventory, capacity and acceptable levels are
constraints of this model.
123
Annals of Operations Research
Najafnejhad et al. (2021) explained VMI policy in a single vendor and multiple retailers.
They generated an upper bound for inventory based on a penalty. They used Imperialist
Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to solve the model. Ashraf and Shahid (2021) suggested a
multiobjective VMI system with interval type-2 fuzzy demand and order quantities. They
appliedNSGA-IIwithEKM(EnhancedKarnink-Mendel) algorithm. In otherworks ofAshraf
et al. (2021), they developed amodel and solved it with Particle SwarmOptimization. Turken,
Geda, and Takasi (2021) studied a situation in which a single vendor and multiple buyers
with multiple products under various environmental impacts and considered a cap-and-trade
regulation.
Lotfi, Kargar, Rajabzadeh, Hesabi, andÖzceylan(2022a, b, c) proposed a hybrid fuzzy and
Data-Driven Robust Optimization (DRO) for resilience and sustainable healthcare SC with
the VMI approach. They applied the VMI approach in health care and showed the model’s
performance in a situation without the VMI method. Wang et al. (2022) utilized a VMI in SC
coordination based on commitment-penalty contracts with bilateral asymmetric information.
In other research, Benrqya (2022) suggested combining cross-docking and VMI in a retail
supply chain. Mahdavisharif, Kazemi, Jahani, and Bagheri (2022) developed a pricing and
inventory policy for non-instantaneous deteriorating items in VMI systems. They applied a
Stackelberg game theory approach to solving the problem.
2.2 Application of VMI in CLSC
POURSOLTAN et al. (2021) studied a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) under VMI with
learning. They utilized a novel metaheuristic algorithm to solve the model.
Keshavarz-Ghorbani and Pasandideh (2021) optimized a CLSC under the VMI contract
and learning. They applied Fibonacci, GA, IWO, and MFO algorithms to solve the model.
3 Research gap
We surveyed the literature review and found that there is no research VSC with VMI con-
sidering risk and robustness approach by applying BCT as an agility approach. Based on the
research gap that we show in Table 1, the innovation and aims of this research are:
1. VSC with VMI approach,
2. Considering risk and robustness,
3. Applying BCT in VSC as an agility approach.
4 Problem statement
In this model, we survey viable SC with a VMI approach by considering BCT, risk and
robustness, including vendors and buyers. Running a BCT network decreases variable costs
(Lotfi, Safavi, et al., 2021b). BCT improves information sharing and run smart contract.
As a result, BCT changes sustainable parameters, including economic, environmental, and
sociality. Therefore, we should utilize this novel technology in our inventory management to
raise the productivity of SC. Eventually; we suggested VSCVMIBRR based on this scope:
1. Resilience strategy: we present a resilience strategy through order resiliency
2. Sustainable strategy: we present emission, energy, and employment constraints,
3. Agile strategy: we add BCT as an agile strategy.

The objective function (1) shows the cost function that contains the weighted expected
value, worst case and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) for considering risk and robustness.
Constraints (2) indicate the summation of inventory costs and establishing a BCT network.
Constraints (3) include vendors’ ordering, holding, and shortage costs in the VMI approach.
Constraints (4) explain BCT’s fix and maintenance cost summation. Constraints (5–9) order-
ing, holding, and shortage costs in running BCT andwithout BCT. Constraints (10) guarantee
that the flowquantity is less than thewarehouse capacity.Constraints (11) guarantee resiliency
in orders by a coefficient of maximum orders. Constraints (12) show amount of shortage is
less than the maximum shortage. Constraints (13) describe demand assignment between

employment) constraints. Constraints (17–18) present flow, shortage decision variables, and
BCT establishment. The binary variable aims to select BCT by the model based on parame-
ters. We permit the model to select and establish BCT regarding the volume of demand. The
volume of demand helps the model of whether running BCT is economically feasible or not.
Therefore, we need to add this binary variable to allow the model to use BCT or not based
on the value of parameters in the model.
4.3 Linearizing of max and absolute function
Linearizing the max function and absolute function is as follows:
If k � max(	s), therefore, we can replace these constraints with the model k ≥ 	s, ∀s.
If k � |	s |, consequently, we can replace the absolute function with these constraints to the
model:k � αs + βs, 	s � αs − βs, αs, βs ≥ 0, ∀s.
4.4 Linearizing of VSCVMIBRR
To decrease the solution time, it is better to change objective function (1) from Nonlinear to
Linear Programming (LP) by operational research method in two steps (Lotfi, Kargar, Ghare-
hbaghi, &Weber, 2021a;Mohtashami, Bozorgi-Amiri, & Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, 2021).We
can add covariate variable for max function and use formulation EVaR:

When linearization is done, the main problem changes from MINLP to LP, and the com-
plexity and solution time (speed of solving) decrease for the commercial solver.

4.5 The complexity of proposedmodel
The complexity of proposed model is calculated in Eqs. (25) to (28) and includes the number
of binary, free, positive variables and numbers of constraints:
Binary variables � 1, (25)
Positive variables � |S|(3|I ||J ||P| + |J ||P| + 2), (26)
Free variables � 7 + 2|S| + |P|(|I | + 2|J |), (27)
Constraints � 6 + |S|(5 + 4|I ||J ||P| + 3|I |) + |P|(|I | + 2|J |). (28)
We can see the number of constraints, positive and free variables dependent on the sce-
nario and suggest scenario reduction algorithms like Fix-and-Optimize and LR to solve and
generate the best upper in minimal time.
5 Results and discussion
Based on the case study information, we assigned the parameters described in the notation
list. The case study of this research is the pharmaceutical industry. We mine data by meeting
with managers (cf. Tables 2, 3).
We applied a computer with this configuration: CPU 3.2 GHz, Processor Core i3-3210,
6.00 GB RAM, and 64-bit operating system. Finally, we solve the mathematical models
with the GAMS-Bonmin solver. After solving the model, we received the cost function and
determined them in Table 3. We can see that the cost function is 239487.458, and the solution
time is 1.521 s (Fig. 2).
5.1 Comparingmodels
We compare the proposed model in the situation with BCT and without BCT. As can be seen,
the cost function of P1-without BCT is greater than P1-with BCT, and its gaps are 0.61% (cf.
Table 4 and Fig. 3).
5.2 Variation on the conservative coefficient
This section changes the conservative coefficient (β) between 0 and 100%. The cost function
increases by increasing the conservative coefficient (cf. Table 5 and Fig. 4). It means that
if decision-makers are conservative and risk-averse or risk-aware, they plan to pay more
inventory costs.
5.3 Variation on the resiliency coefficient
This section changes the resiliency coefficient (λ) between 94 and 100%. The cost func-
tion increases by decreasing the resiliency coefficient (cf. Table 6 and Fig. 5). As a result,
diminishing the resiliency coefficient for orders increases cost.

5.6 Discussion
This section analyzes VSC with VMI by considering blockchain, risk, and robustness in the
pharmacy industry. We compare our model with the situation because we do not have BCT.
As can be seen, we decrease costs and improve agility and sustainability with the presence
of BCT. We did sensitivity analysis on the conservative coefficient, the resiliency coefficient,
the confidence level and the scale of problem. The cost function increases by growing the
conservative coefficient, decreasing the resiliency coefficient, and increasing the confidence
level, and vice versa. This research is developed by Lotfi, Kargar, Rajabzadeh and et al.,
(2022a, b, c). However, we add the BCT can be utilized in the system and compare this
model with Lotfi, Kargar, Rajabzadeh and et al., (2022a, b, c). Previous research has no

research on VSC with VMI approach by considering blockchain, risk, and robustness. As a
result, this research tries to cover the research gap and show that using BCT decreases cost
and improves SC’s performance and agility.
6 Managerial insights and practical implications
This research suggests that the VSC considers sustainability, agility and resiliency together.
In line with this concept, we offer sustainability as environmental and social impact, agility
and resiliency as the VMI method for inventory and BCT technology for increasing lean
production. The VMI approach manages and controls retailers’ inventory by vendors or
suppliers and is responsible for SC inventory. In addition, BCT clears transaction between
SC components and reduce variable costs. Therefore, applying new concepts, including VMI
and BCT upgrades agility and resilience for disruption and demand fluctuation in VSC.
SC Managers should do everything to improve the performance of SC. One of them is
applying VMI, which decreases the cost of inventory. Running VMI controls inventory by
vendors and reduces sustainable pillar-like environmental pollution and energy consumption.
We suggest an application of BCT in SC as an agility policy. Utilizing BCT decreases costs,
increases agility, and clarifies transactions between SC components. We present a resilience
strategy through order resiliency, proposed emission, energy, and employment constraints
for sustainability, and adding BCT as an agile strategy. We, as SC managers, should embed

7 Conclusions and outlook
The best strategy that needed to apply by companies in the recent decade for managing
and reducing the cost of inventory can be VMI policy. Therefore, we show VSC that used
the VMI strategy by considering blockchain, risk, and robustness in healthcare SC. The
123
Annals of Operations Research
researcher has not surveyed this subject and can be innovative in this research. We add BCT
constraint to show agility in the mathematical model. We propose ordering resiliency as a
resilience strategy and offering sustainability pillars of emission, energy, and employment
constraints. We generated an objective function that includes weighted expected value, worst
case, and EVaR for considering risk and robustness under different scenarios.
The results of this research and managerial insights are as follows:
1. After solving the model, we received cost functions and determined them in Table 3.
2. We compare the proposed model (P1) in the situation with BCT and without BCT. As
can be seen, the cost function of P1-without BCT is greater than P1-with BCT, and its
gap is 0.61% (cf. Table 4 and Fig. 3).
3. We change the conservative coefficient (β) between 0 and 100%. The cost function
increase by increasing the conservative coefficient (cf. Table 5 and Fig. 4).
4. We change the resiliency coefficient (λ) between 94 and 100%. The cost function increase
by decreasing the resiliency coefficient (cf. Table 6 and Fig. 5).
5. We change the confidence level (α) between 1 and 10%. The cost function decreases by
increasing the confidence level (cf. Table 7 and Fig. 6).
6. We change the scale of the problem and define problems. By increasing the scale of the
problem, the solution time increased (cf. Table 8, Figs. 7 and 8).
One of the limitations of this research is solving the model on a large scale. We propose to
apply the heuristic and metaheuristic approaches (Khalilpourazari et al., 2021). Adding other
objectives can help to satisfy another requirement of researchers and managers. Embedding
other tools of coherent risk measure like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) or Wang risk
measure can tackle risks and uncertainty. Using novel uncertainty like data-driven robust
optimization (Khalilpourazari & Hashemi Doulabi, 2021; Khalilpourazari & Pasandideh,
2021;Khalilpourazari et al., 2019; Lotfi,Kargar,Gharehbaghi, et al., 2022a) and neutrosophic
optimization technique and learning approach (Mohammadi & Khalilpourazari, 2017) are
very interesting for researchers (Ahmad, 2021).
