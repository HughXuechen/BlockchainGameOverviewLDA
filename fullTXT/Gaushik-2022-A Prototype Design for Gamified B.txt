ABSTRACT
Donating blood is a common practice that has a positive effect on the
lives of several individuals. Daily, the number of people in urgent
need of blood continues to rise substantially. It is often challenging
to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse
if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based
decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood
donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name,
location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in
the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors’ lack
of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people
not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify
the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward
for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for
storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to
donors. The article also briefly discusses the process of designing
the DApp.

1 INTRODUCTION
As perWorldHealth Organisation (WHO) data, around 118.5million
people donate blood globally. There are 13,300 blood donation
centers in 169 countries. However, low-income countries report ten
donations per 1000 people, whereas, in high-income countries, the
blood donation ratio is around 32 per 1000 people [1]. The ratios
are much less than 1% for rare blood groups such as AB negative.
Three blood donors are voluntary-unpaid, familymembers, and paid
donors. Voluntary unpaid donors donate blood regularly. Family
members donate when an emergency needs, such as surgery or an
accident. The third category is often the rare blood group donors
who donate blood and earn an income.
Haemovigilance is a protocol described by WHO for tracking
the entire blood donation to transfusion process [2]. Currently,
the haemovigilance protocol is centralised and involves a central
vigilance office to process and approve the data of donors and recip-
ients. The centralised process is time-consuming and brings risks
during an emergency. Decentralising this process by eliminating
the central vigilance office and automating the validation will help
accelerate the blood donation and delivery experience. Gamifica-
tion is a process of improving the user experience by encouraging
and motivating users by providing them with interactive tasks
and rewards. We also envision that the poor donor-to-recipient
ratios can be improved by gamifying the blood donation process.
Blockchain technology has great potential in healthcare and supply
chain management [3]. Users can store patients’ sensitive data, med-
ical history, and materials tracking in the tamperproof blockchain
ledger [4]. In this paper, we propose a decentralised haemovigilance
protocol, as mentioned by WHO [2], using blockchain technology.
In the proposed system, the data of the donors and recipients are
anonymised and stored securely in the blockchain ledger. We also
introduce Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), such as badges and reward

tokens for donors who meet specific targets or achievements. In-
terPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol for distributed file
sharing. We propose to use IPFS to store medical data and NFTs.
Gamification could boost the number of blood donors by encourag-
ing younger individuals to contribute. By introducing gamification,
the system could facilitate awareness about blood donation and
increase donor participation, thus encouraging more individuals
to donate. A blockchain-based system for blood donation might
significantly reduce the risk of disease transmission as the donor’s
medical history is also linked when they donate and enhance blood
supply quality, reducing long-term medical risks [5].
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces
various new solutions presented by several researchers. Section
3 explains the proposed system architecture for the blood dona-
tion application. In Section 4, we discuss the prototype and imple-
mentation of an application. Section 4.1 covers how we integrated
gamification into our application’s user experience. The paper is
concluded in Section 5.
2 RELATEDWORK
Subrata Talapatra et al. developed a cross-platform web interface
that allows users to view the exact contact details of potential blood
donors nearby [6]. They hosted a local XAMMP server to provide
this service. Hai Trieu Le et al. proposed BloodChain, a blockchain-
based system to enable blood donor information management [7].
BloodChain uses Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain proto-
col for transactions, as the prototype user base is very small. They
performed a comprehensive evaluation inmany scenarios to demon-
strate the viability of their proposed model. Diana Hawashin et al.
proposed a method that stores non-critical and massive data off-
chain via the decentralized storage system using InterPlanetary File
System (IPFS) [8]. They discuss their proposed blood donation man-
agement solution’s system architecture, algorithms, and working
principles. They also evaluated the performance of their proposed
solution in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by conducting a
security analysis. Aderonke Anthonia Kayode et al. presented web,
and Android-based applications for improved and efficient blood
bank information administration [9]. This paper aims to design
an application with all the necessary characteristics to facilitate
communication between blood recipients, donors, and blood banks.
Sivakamy Lakshminarayanan et al. proposed a system for track-
ing blood donation. They implemented the system using the Hy-
perledger Fabric framework and aim to increase the transparency
of the blood donation process by tracing the blood’s path and re-
ducing unnecessary blood loss by providing a unified platform for
the exchange of blood and its derivatives between blood banks [10].
They developed a web application for blood donation to access the
system for ease of use. Mehmet Alyangil et al. propose an Ethereum
blockchain-based framework called KanCoin to manage and adjust
the processes for efficient distribution planning in the blood de-
livery system from donors to distribution centres and patients at
medical centres in a more effective way than the conventional pro-
cedures [11]. Altahir Ahmed Saad et al. designed a system for blood
transfusion services [12]. This system consists of two components:
an android mobile app for donors’ tasks and a web application for
all blood banks’ or their workers’ functions or tasks, such as doc-
tors and various laboratory divisions. The existing blood donation
methods have fundamental concerns with security and efficiency.
It depends on the system’s ability to reduce costs and time while
preserving efficiency. The centralized blood management system in-
troduces a delay in blood transportation during emergencies. There
were difficulties in securing and anonymizing the blood donation
data. This paper presents a blockchain-based DApp to decentralize
the blood donation process and improve the user experience by
providing NFT-based rewards to donors.
3 PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE DESIGN FOR
BLOOD DONATION APP
We developed a web and mobile application to manage the details
of donors, hospitals, and recipients securely. This section describes
the proposed system architecture, mobile and web app design. An
overall architecture of the proposed system is represented in figure
1. The system consists of four active participants: the administration,
Hospitals/Physician, Donors, and Recipients.
• Administrator - The Administrator is responsible for register-
ing and supervising clinics, hospitals, and donation centers.
They organise fundamental data, facilitate searches, and con-
nect the donor and recipient.
• Hospital/Physician - The Blood Donation System contains a
directory of hospitals, donation centers, and physicians who
can register a donor.
• Donor - A donor is a person who gives blood for use in
transfusion.
• Recipients - Recipients receive blood from donors in an emer-
gency.
Figure 1: Proposed SystemWorkflow
The web and mobile applications manage the interaction be-
tween these users. If a person wishes to donate blood, they must fill
out the registration form with their full name, email address, mail-
ing address, contact information, and blood group. Once a person
has registered, the administration validates their details and pro-
vides a credential to access the application. This data is then stored
to IPFS. The donor can log in to the app using the credentials to look
1203

for blood requirements in their locality. The website also provides
information on blood donors for recipients. They are provided with
the contact information for hospitals and other organizations if no
donors in their city belong to the same group. The information is
decentralised using IPFS, which overcomes the constraints of the
conventional system. The IPFS distributed ledger also ensures there
is data tampering. The proposed system significantly decreases an
individual’s time and effort during emergency situations.
3.1 Web and Mobile App Design
Before beginning development, we developed the web and mobile
applications’ wireframe designs. Figure 2 depicts the wireframe
model for the web application, and Figure 3 shows the wireframe
design for the mobile application.
Figure 2: Wireframe Design of Web application
The web application wireframe consists of three sections. The
first section is the main screen, where the user may find and learn
more about blood donation and its benefits. Then the second section
is "Find Blood", where they can select their blood type and request
blood. The third section is a "Donate Blood" section where users
can choose their blood type and start donating.
Figure 3: Wireframe Design of Web application
The mobile application wireframe has four screens as shown in
figure 3. The first is the login screen, where the user can sign up if
he is a first-time visitor or log in if he already has an account. The
second screen is for user registration. The third screen is the main
screen, where the user can choose whether they need to donate
or receive for themselves or their friends. The last screen is the
user profile screen, where the users can see their profile, current
statistics, and earned NFT rewards.

oping our web and mobile applications.

We set up a local test network to simulate transactions.
4 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION USING
TRUFFLE SUITE, IPFS, PYTHON
As discussed earlier, we designed mobile and web applications for
blood donation and user management. This section explains how
we enabled blockchain to the applications using truffle suite, IPFS,
and python libraries. Truffle suite is a local Ethereum test network.
We set up the truffle suite on a personal computer (PC) running
Ubuntu 21.04 Operation System. The PC has an Intel i7 Processor
with 16GB of RAM, 1TB of hard disk storage, and an NVIDIA
P1000 4GB Graphics Card [13]. We followed the truffle installation
instructions available in Truffle Documentations [14]. Truffle also
supports Smart Contract deploying and testing. While we set up the
truffle test network,We get ten Ethereum accounts and 100 ETH test
tokens in each of these ten accounts. We assigned these accounts
to the donors, recipients, administrators, and hospital/physicians.
Remix IDE is a web-based Ethereum test network to develop
and test smart contracts [15]. We used Remix IDE connected to
Ethereum Rinkeby Test Network to develop smart contracts for
NFT minting, NFT distribution, and user management. We initially
deployed the smart contracts in Remix IDE to test NFT minting,
NFT distribution, and user management. Figure 4 shows the smart
contract deployed in Remix IDE. The red highlight shows the func-
tion for mining an NFT stored in IPFS and the green highlight shows
the NFT transfer function.

Figure 4: Minting and transferring NFTs using Smart Con-
tracts in Remix IDE
We used IPFS to store NFTs and user data. IPFS is a distributed
storage platform that is very similar to the blockchain distributed
ledger.We can store photos, videos, and text.We created NFTs in jpg
format (photo) and uploaded them to IPFS using the desktop client
available for Ubuntu OS. Figure 5 shows the NFTs we uploaded to
IPFS. IPFS provides an URL for each of these NFTs.
Figure 5: NFTs stored in IPFS
We designed the mobile applications using flutter and web ap-
plications using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. Figures 6 and 7 shows
the screenshots of web and mobile apps. Figure 8 shows the user
registration web page.

Figure 7: Screenshot showing the Mobile Application
4.1 Gamified User Experience using NFTs in
Mobile Application
NFT minting is a process of adding an NFT to the blockchain. NFTs,
we must mint the uploaded to IPFS before distributing it to the
users. Once we mint the NFTs, they get associated with a user
account, and here it is the administrator’s account. The smart con-
tract has a mint function that takes the user address, random ID
for NFT and IPFS URL, and mints the NFT of the test network.
We used Metamask Wallet to create test accounts and store the
minted NFTs. Figure 9 shows the newly minted NFT collections.
Similarly, a transfer NFT function lets administrators transfer NFT

from their account to a donor account. Figure 4 shows the transfer
NFT function highlighted in green box.
Figure 9: Metamask Wallet Showing the NFT Collections
The transfer NFT function requires the from address; to address;
and the token id of the NFT that the user wishes to transfer. The
app distributes NFTs to donors based on specific activities and tasks
that the donor must complete. We have programmed basic tasks
like welcome credits, introducing friends to the app, first donation
and frequent donations. We plan to introduce other tasks in future.
4.2 Integration of all sub components
We used the Python Flask framework for the backend services to
integrate all the subcomponents developed for this project. The
HTTP Post method collects the users’ data and passes it to IPFS
using the native IPFS Python library. Figure 10 shows the user data
from the registration page in the Linux terminal, and Figure 11
shows the user data stored on the IPFS desktop client. Similarly,
the python app uses the web3 API to interact with smart contracts,
fetch information about the NFTs and display it appropriately to
the user account [16].

terminal

5 CONCLUSION
Our solution uses blockchain technology to build a decentralized
platform to simplify blood donation and gamify the experience to
engage more donors. This paper uses the Ethereum test network to
deploy the proposed application.We designed this DApp using tools
such as truffle suite, Remix IDE and IPFS. We used Flutter, HTML,
CSS and Bootstrap to develop mobile and web apps. We integrated
the apps and the blockchain component using python open source
libraries. We envision that the proposed app provides traceability
of blood donations, motivates more people to come forward and
donate blood and helps recipients to find suitable donors during
an emergency. Although the overall cost of operation is higher,
we propose to use NFTs because the NFTs benefit creators and
the collectors. The creators can generate an income when they
mint NFTs on our platform. Similarly, the collector can also trade
this NFT on our platform or any NFT platforms and generate and
income. In the future, we plan to focus on introducing more tasks
for the donors and monitor the complete blood transfusion process
using blockchain technology. We also plan to improve the app by
addressing the privacy issues in IPFS, optimise the performance
such as reduce latency, reduce gas costs and introduce it in the
market.
