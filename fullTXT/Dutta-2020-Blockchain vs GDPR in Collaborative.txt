Abstract. Data Governance is the trending topic in today’s security-
privacy-concerned digital ecosystem. Blockchain technology is probably
one of the most acclaimed evolutions in recent times. Blockchain tech-
nologies can be a game-changer for data governance in the areas of
transparency and data provenance. As a distributed ledger technology
(DLT), blockchain is being touted as a potentially transformational force
in collaborative data governance. The General Data Protection Regula-
tion (GDPR) entered into force on May 25, 2018. It is the latest in a
series of European Union (EU) legislative measures designed to give EU
citizens more control over their data. GDPR, which directs a central-
ized ‘data controller’ (GDPR Article 4) to manage user data, clashes
with the blockchain’s decentralized data storage and management pro-
cess. The GDPR and the blockchain both have a common ideological
ground, emphasizing the need for a change in managing personal data.
While GDPR takes care of the policy side by setting up a standard, the
blockchain helps enable the implementation side by providing a unique
framework. In this paper, the authors analyze the clashes between the
two and the potential solutions to those clashes for blockchain to comply
with GDPR.

1 Introduction
Collaborative data governance is the future of data management practices in an
organization to keep pace with the dynamic nature of today’s business world. On
the broad spectrum, it answers the following questions related to the data: the
data owner, the data quality, how to manage the data, and the possible use cases
for the data. The world became aware of blockchain technology in 2009 with the
release of Bitcoin [1] by Satoshi Nakamoto, a digital currency that is independent
of a central authority. Blockchain technology is versatile enough to handle any
information that can be digitized beyond the cryptocurrency. Blockchain holds

built-in security and privacy. It offers trust, transparency, autonomy, and con-
sensus. The collaborative data governance allots with the issues of availability,
usability, security, data integrity, and analytics. Blockchain has suddenly sur-
faced as an elixir for these issues with a throng of facilities and benefits that
enhance data governance and increase trust. Blockchain simplifies the manage-
ment of trusted information over communication networks by enabling trans-
parent interactions among different parties in a faster, safer, and more reliable
way. Given that the blockchain is trustworthy, secure, and cannot be tampered
with, it is seeping into corporate awareness. From what data governance needs
and what blockchain provides, it’s easy to see they are an excellent fit for each
other.
In parallel, the General Data Protection Regulation, better known by its
acronym, GDPR is a new framework for consumer data protection that came
into effect in Europe from 25th May 2018. The implementation of the GDPR is
fundamentally linked to a company’s data governance program. It significantly
empowers several rights where ‘data subjects’1 can demand companies to pro-
vide them with the whereabouts of their personal data and what processing is
being done on them. The regulation addresses data protection rules for personal
data export outside of the EU and enforces EU data protection laws to guide for-
eign organizations that process personal data about residents of the EU (GDPR
Chapter 5)2.
In some critical ways, blockchain shares many goals with the GDPR. How-
ever, there exist some real conflicts between GDPR and blockchain as well. In
this paper, we discuss these issues from the collaborative data governance per-
spective. The rest of the paper is divided into three Sections - GDPR against
the Blockchain (Sect. 3), GDPR for the Blockchain (Sect. 4) and Con-
clusion (Sect. 5).
2 Background
In this Section General Data Protection Regulation3 and blockchain [1] is
explained in brief.
2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Ensuring the confidentiality of personal data of data subjects and giving them
the option to impose access, erasure and rectification of the data are the pri-
mary goals of GDPR. The GDPR realizes four different roles : (a) Data Subject,
the provider of the data to the controller (GDPR Article 4(1)), (b) Data Con-
troller, the legal body who determines the purposes of data and the means of
their processing (GDPR Article 4(7)), (c) Data Processor, the legal body that
processes the data as determined by the data controller (GDPR Article 4(8))

and (d) Third Parties, who are not the above three, but have the authority of
data processing under the authority of the controller (GDPR Article 4(10)).
GDPR gives “privacy by design” significant importance. It calls for inclusion
of data protection from the onset of designing systems, implementing appropriate
technical and infrastructure measures (GDPR Article 25)4. Failing to adhere to
the regulation will result in a fine of upto 20 million Euros or 4% (or 2%) of
global turnover, whichever is higher5.
2.2 Blockchain
A blockchain is a network that uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) where
the data stored is decentralized, transparent and immutable. Data is stored in
a list of blocks where each block, added in an append-only manner contains a
hash of previous block, a time stamp, and a set of data as shown in Fig. 1.

3 GDPR Against Blockchain
In this section, we investigate the significant conflicts in the GDPR-blockchain
relationship and the legal challenges for blockchain to comply with the regula-
tion. The conflicts and challenges are discussed by answering the following five
questions.
Q3.1: How does GDPR’s right to be forgotten (Article 17) and right to
rectification (Article 16) clashes with blockchain’s immutable ledger?
� GDPR right to be forgotten, also called right to erasure directs that the data
subjects (personal data subjects) shall have the “right to obtain from the con-
troller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay”
as stated in GDPR Article 17 (1). The right is not absolute and applies only
in certain circumstances such as if the personal data is no longer in use “for
the purposes for which they were collected” (GDPR Article 17(1(a))) or the
data subject withdraws consent to processing of the data (GDPR Article 6 and
Article 9)6 7 and their is “no other legal ground for the processing” (GDPR
Article 17(1(b))) or in circumstances where their is ‘unlawful’ processing of the
personal data (GDPR Article 17(1(d))). If the controller has made the per-
sonal data public, “reasonable measures, including technical measures” must
be taken taking into account available technology and the cost of implement-
ing such measures (GDPR Article 17(2)). However, blockchain is fundamentally
immutable. A typical transaction in a blockchain, consists of the sender, recip-
ient and amount of asset transfered which are personal data and are stored
permanently on the ledger. It is designed to retain its information indefinitely
as a mechanism to eliminate any fraud and assures ownership of data in the
ledger. Moreover, GDPR addresses data adjustability in right to rectification by
mandating that the data subject can exercise their “right to obtain from the
controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data con-
cerning him or her” (GDPR Article 16). Any modification of the data on the
blockchain breaks the links between the blocks and therefore, the chain is broken
and the entire blockchain is rendered useless. GDPR’s demand for data mini-
mization is also another blow to the blockchain’s immutable nature. According
to the regulation, the personal data must be “adequate, relevant and limited” to
protect privacy so that only absolutely necessary facts about the data is shared
(GDPR Article 5(1(c)))8.

Blockchain vs GDPR in Collaborative Data Governance 85
Q3.2: How GDPR’s right to restriction of processing (Article 18)
clashes with blockchain’s distributed ledger?
� GDPR defines data processing as “any operation or set of operations which is
performed on personal data or on a set of personal data, whether or not by auto-
mated means” (GDPR Article 4(1)). GDPR incurs greater data control power
to data subjects by giving them the right to restriction of processing, that is,
“The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction
of processing” (GDPR Article 18) if the data subject feels the data may be inac-
curate or there is “unlawful” processing of the personal data. However, the data
as a part of the ledger in a blockchain network is distributed amongst the nodes
participating in the network. Besides the data controller, every participant in
the network can process the data which averts data privacy desired by the reg-
ulation. In simple terms, every participant maintains a local copy of the ledger.
Anyone can store and process the data, because of this local copy held in his
or her computer, while maintaining their anonymity. This directly contradicts
GDPR’s privacy policies where a centralized data controller and processor has
the power to store, collect and process the data. (GDPR Article 24)9.
Q3.3: Can encrypted personal data be stored on a blockchain? Are
encrypted personal data on a blockchain anonymous enough to fall
outside the scope of GDPR?
� GDPR does not apply to anonymous data as stated in GDPR Recital 2610. The
threshold for anonymization under the regulation is high and only results “from
processing personal data in order to prevent identification” irreversibly [2]. A
typical blockchain network aims to achieve anonymity using cryptography, pre-
cisely, public-key cryptography and hashing. However, the identity and data in
a blockchain is in fact, ‘pseudonymous’. According to Andreas M. Antonopou-
los11, Bitcoin is mistakenly characterized as ‘anonymous’ currency [3]. Identity
is tied to a pseudonym, that is, the public key. Pseudonymous data, however,
falls under the scope of the law. Data is pseudonymous if it can be tied to other
available information to identify the data subject, else the data is considered
anonymous (GDPR recital 26).
Q3.4: In a blockchain who is identified as data controller and data
processor?
� According to GDPR Article 13, data subjects have the right to know “the
identity and the contact details of the controller”12. GDPR Article 4 (7) and
Article 4 (8) define that in order to process data, data controllers are required

to determine “the purposes and means of the processing of personal data” and
data processors are required to process “personal data on behalf of the con-
troller”. GDPR’s accountability directs a controller to be responsible for legal
and lawful processing of personal data (GDPR Article 5). A public permission-
less blockchain is perfectly decentralized as there is no inherent power inequality
between the nodes. Thus, permissionless blockchain networks require no obvi-
ous identifiable data controller to direct and co-ordinate the working of the
blockchain network and it falls directly under the scope of GDPR. In a per-
missioned blockchain network, identity of the data controller is less of an issue.
GDPR Article 26(1)13 also defines joint controllers “where two or more con-
trollers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be
joint controllers”. In a permissioned blockchain, a plurality of controllers can
govern the network with pre-defined rules of consensus, which is exactly how a
federated blockchain network works.
Q3.5: How does GDPR’s territorial scope clashes with blockchain?
� According to GDPR Article 3 territorial scope, the regulation applies to per-
sonal data processing of the citizens who are a part of EU. In GDPR Chap. 5,
“Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organization”, the
law defines that personal data transfer to countries and controllers outside EU
are allowed only if the controller conforms to GDPR or provides an identical
level of data protection (GDPR Article 45(1))14 and where “enforceable data
subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available”. The
regulation applies to controllers who are not established in the EU but process
personal data of the citizens in EU. Public blockchains do not provide adherence
to these principles and data movement in them are cross-bordered. In a pub-
lic blockchain, anyone can join the network as a node and create transactions.
Public blockchain provides no geographical border to its network, which com-
prises a number of uncontrolled nodes, free to trade data and thus the allows
cross-border data processing. Compliance with GDPR’s territorial scope is more
feasible in a private permissioned blockchain.
4 Towards GDPR Compliant Blockchain
This Section states the potential solutions to the conflicts addressed in Sect. 3
between GDRP and blockchain in data driven cooperation.
Q4.1: How to enable GDPR’s right to erasure and rectification in a
blockchain?
� We look at the potential solutions to enable data modification in blockchain.

Blockchain vs GDPR in Collaborative Data Governance 87
Storing Data Off-Chain. A potential solution to allow data adjustability in
blockchain is storing the personal data off-chain with restricted access control.
The reference to this data is kept along with its hash and other metadata includ-
ing the claims and permissions regarding this data on the blockchain [4]. The
blockchain is a medium of enabling trust between parties and delivering proof
for transactions. The proof will be done off-chain through conventional methods
where the data controller decides if the party requesting the data has autho-
rized access to it [5]. After GDPR came into play, off-chain data storage in the
blockchain is now seen as a possible workaround.
A number of off-chain data storage solutions for blockchain have emerged
recently. My Health My Data (MHMD), a private permissioned blockchain15,
is a project funded by the EU, stores personal data off-chain. Other such
blockchain networks include the Bitcoin Lightning Network [6] that uses off-chain
exchange of bitcoins between nodes through micropayment channels16. Æternity
blockchain [7] uses state channel technology17 for transactions and smart con-
tracts to be executed off-chain. Liquidity exchange built on top of Liquidity
network [8] allows off-chain exchanges, which although being a decentralized
network is scalable to a centralized exchange.
State Tree Pruning and Smart Contract Self-destruct in Ethereum.
State tree pruning18, similar to automatic memory management in volatile
resources, is a method of removing data in the Ethereum blockchain. However,
the drawback is that it is intended for minimizing states in the block by remov-
ing unused records and removal does not depend on participant’s demand. The
only way to remove code from the blockchain is when a contract at that address
performs the “selfdestruct” operation19. The storage and code is removed from
the state. Even if a contract is removed by “selfdestruct”, it is still part of the
history of the blockchain and probably retained by most Ethereum nodes. So
using “selfdestruct” is not the same as deleting data from a hard disk.
Chameleon Hashes. Using “chameleon” hash functions [9] to frame an
editable blockchain (or redactable blockchain) has been explored [10]. The hash
of the data stored in the blockchain retains the integrity of the data. Any changes
to the data changes the hash of the data in the block which implies data tem-
pering. This changes the block header hash and eventually breaks the chain
(link) between the subsequent blocks. Also referred to as trapdoor hash func-
tions, “chameleon” hash function has an additional secured private key, known
as trapdoor key using which the original data can be updated and written back

into the blockchain. However, the updated data has the same hash value as the
original data. This enables imposing GDPR’s right to erasure and right to recti-
fication by allowing users to rewrite or delete past blocks of information without
breaking the blockchain.
µchain. Recently, authors have introduced a new mutable blockchain, called
µchain [11]. The main features of µchain include maintaining alternative ver-
sions of data records, using consensus to approve a valid history and its inherent
capability to conceal alternative versions of history. In a given set of transac-
tions, only a single transaction is marked as “active”, while all the remaining
ones represent alternative inactive transactions. A set of transactions can be
extended to add new versions of transactions. Thus, transactions can be updated
by the sender if it requires any rectification which is the “active” transaction.
Decryption keys are available only for the “active” transactions, and the inactive
transactions are all kept hidden by encryption. This allows data subjects with
the option to exercise their right to rectification.
Q4.2: How to identify data controller and data processor in a
blockchain?
� GDPR is established on the notion of an identifiable data controller to deter-
mine “the purposes and means of the processing” (GDPR Recital 79)20. Here,
we address how can such a controller and processor be established in the decen-
tralized world of blockchain.
Network Administrator and Miners in Permissioned Blockchain. In a
permissioned blockchain, the entity responsible for handling of personal data
can be the data controller and data processor depending on the implementation
specifics. The entity who determines the participation rights (authentication)
and the access rights (authorization) of every participants in the blockchain
network can be considered as the controller of the network. This entity can be
the governing body, that is, “the natural or legal person” which “determines the
purposes and means of the processing of personal data” (GDPR Article 4(7)).
In a federated blockchain, a plurality of controllers can govern the network with
predefined and transparent rules of consensus, that is, in case of joint controllers.
The miners make a paramount contribution to the operation of the blockchain
as they bear the responsibility of confirming and adding transactions into the
blockchain. The transactions initiated by the participants in a blockchain are
stored in a temporary ‘pool of unconfirmed transactions’ which is a collection of
transactions waiting for their confirmation [3], that is, waiting to be processed
by the miners. Therefore, we can consider miners as the data processors. Hence,
in accordance with GDPR data controller definition (GDPR Article 4(7)), they
cannot be reckoned as data controllers.
20 GDPR Recital 79, https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-79/.
https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-79/
Blockchain vs GDPR in Collaborative Data Governance 89
Smart Contract. A blockchain network employing smart contracts protocol
can operate it as a data processor. CNIL21 explained in their report22 that smart
contract developers could be considered either data controllers or data processors
accordingly. For a specific purpose and means for processing of personal data for
that purpose identified by a participant or set of participants in the blockchain,
a developer designs a smart contract solution for that purpose.
Here, the smart contract developer is processing the personal data on behalf
of that participant through that smart contract. Here, that participant can be
considered as the data controller (or joint controllers in case of plurality of con-
trollers) whereas the smart contract developer as well as the smart contract itself
can be determined as the data processor.
Q4.3: How to make personal data anonymous in a blockchain?
� Recalling GDPR Recital 26, anonymous data are not in the scope of the
regulation. If the data on the blockchain is anonymous, it falls directly outside
the scope of GDPR. In this Section, potential solutions to achieve anonymity
are discussed.
Zero-Knowledge Proof. A solution to achieve anonymity in blockchain is
Zero-knowledge proof [12]. It allows a verifier to validate the truth of a statement
of a party (prover) without having any knowledge about the statement except
that the statement is true. Zero-knowledge protocols supplements privacy in
transactions in a blockchain where the transaction is validated without revealing
the internal details of the transactions, that is, the sender, recipient and the
content of the transaction (personal data). The entire blockchain network can
agree on the validity of a transaction without learning about the content of the
transaction.
Zero-knowledge protocols in blockchain use zk-snarks (Zero knowledge Suc-
cinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Kn-owledge) [13] to overcome multiple chal-
lenge interactions between verifier and prover to validate a transaction. Zk-snarks
only requires a common string of characters known by the prover and verifier
to validate a statement. Using the digital signature of the prover in blockchain
as the common string, a transaction can be proved easily with low computa-
tional effort. The personal data in the transactions are decentralized and no
personal data is stored on the blockchain, Due to the absence of actual data
in the blockchain, participants cannot process the data which in turn, provides
data privacy and restricts any unintended and “unlawful” processing of the data
as desired in GDPR’s right to restriction of processing as explained in Sect. 3.

Zcash23 is a high profile cryptocurrency using zk-snarks. Ethereum’s
metropolis24 protocol upgrade allowed users to use zk-snarks in their smart con-
tracts. PIVX is another cryptocurrency using zk-snarks25.
Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses. Another solution to anonymiza-
tion in blockchain is the use of ring signatures [14] and stealth addresses. Ring
signatures hides the identity of the creator/sender of a transaction. A ring signa-
ture is a type of digital signature in which a group of possible signers are fused
together to obscure the actual signature of the sender of the transaction. All the
signers are equal and valid and hence, to a third party all the signers seem to
be the sender but is unable to determine the identity of the actual sender of the
transaction. Stealth addresses, enhances privacy by shielding the identity of the
recipient in a transaction. A transaction in blockchain is essentially transforma-
tion of old outputs belonging to one wallet to new outputs in another wallet.
Stealth address is recorded in every transaction to indicate the recipient of asset
involved. However, any other party cannot determine the identity of the recipient
by looking at the stealth address because a stealth address is not associated with
the recipient’s public address. Stealth addresses and ring signatures are used in
Bytecoin26 and Monero27. Monero also uses the technique of ring confidential
signatures [15], which is a combination of ring signatures, to hide transaction
amounts.

5 Conclusion
This paper analyzed and discussed the significant privacy concerns and chal-
lenges to blockchain from the lens of collaborative data governance; precisely
the rights of data subject, data controller and processor, pseudonymous personal
data and the territorial scope of GDPR. The paper also highlights opportunities
for the various types of blockchain to comply with GDPR or at least achieve
partial compliance which itself is a step forward. As a result, we get a clear
vision of the relationship between GDPR and public and private blockchain net-
works respectively. We illustrate their relationship through venn diagrams. Fig. 2
shows the relationship between GDPR and public permissionless blockchain. Fig.
3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the relationship between GDPR and public permissioned
92 R. Dutta et al.
blockchain and private permissioned blockchain respectively. From the above
comparison, we get a clear understanding of the potentials of GDPR compliance
of the three different types of blockchain networks as shown in Fig. 5. We can
observe from Fig. 5 that the increase in GDPR compliance is when the decen-
tralization nature of the blockchain decreases. To demonstrate the compatibility
of blockchain and GDPR, the possible solution discussed in this paper should
be leveraged to the most significant extent possible in blockchain solution archi-
tectures.
