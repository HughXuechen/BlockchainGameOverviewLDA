ABSTRACT
As an emerging blockchain technique, the blockchain-based loot
box has received significant attention recently due to its promis-
ing characters in transparency and decentralization. Because all
virtual assets are bound to the players’ own address, which allows
the players to control and manage everything, players can trade
virtual items via the 2nd exChange Market (2CM) directly. To un-
derstand the players’ optimal strategies and the game provider’s
optimal pricing, we conduct an economic analysis of both the game
provider’s and players’ behaviors. In addition, gas fee, a unique
factor in blockchain, is taken into consideration. Specifically, we
model the interactions between the game provider and players
as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, we model the game
provider’s optimal pricing problem to maximize his utility using
prospect theory (PT) due to the intrinsic demand uncertainty. In
Stage II, the players choose the market which can maximize their
utility to derive their preferred items. Moreover, our analysis and
numerical results show that a game provider who considers the
PT modeling should adopt a conservative pricing mechanism to
increase his utility. Besides, the primary market is more susceptible
to gas fees than the 2CM.

1 INTRODUCTION
Along with the rise and prosperity of online and mobile games
over the past decades, loot box, as a probabilistic good involving
a probability of obtaining one or more multiple distinct in-game
virtual items [22], has been a solid and robust source of revenue for
the game industry. For example, in the case of Activision Blizzard,
a US-based gaming company, approximately 51% of its revenue,
US $6.5 billion, came from in-game net bookings in 2019, which
covered loot boxes and other in-app purchases [2]. However, the
loot box has caused controversy and criticism [19]. There are two
limitations to the traditional loot box: 1) Probability opacity: Loot
box items can be common or rare, and the probabilities of obtaining
different items can be unknown to the player before opening a loot
box. Chen et al. [4] showed that the seller could obtain additional
revenue by purposelymisrepresenting the allocation probabilities in
the absence of regulation. 2) Meaningless Ownership: All the virtual
properties in the loot boxes, including credits, items, and avatars,
are stored in the game providers’ server rather than owned by the
players [16, 18]. Also, players sell unwanted or redundant virtual
items in the loot box through centralized third-party platforms like
Steam market
1
, which sometimes can not be converted into fiat.
Hence, the players call for more freedom and want true ownership,
which allows them to buy, sell, trade, and use their items with no
restrictions from third parties. According to a survey by Worldwide
Asset Exchange (WAX), a blockchain platform focused on virtual
items [1], 75% of game players would be more likely to invest in
digital assets if they could use them in multiple games, which is
made possible by true ownership.Moreover, 69% of game developers
believe when items are freely tradeable, it increases the value of
those items, and 84% would create cross-compatible in-game items
if the technology allowed them to do so.
Fortunately, Ethereum, known as the Blockchain 2.0 platform,
provides a promising solution to the problems mentioned above. In
addition to the classic application of distributed public ledger, the
smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source programs that can
be automatically executed without any centralized control [6, 28].
Following are the major benefits that blockchain has brought to the
loot box. 1) Probability transparency: Due to the transparent char-
acteristic of blockchain data, players or third-party organizations
can audit the smart contract-based probability, which will enhance
the trustworthiness of the loot box. 2) Asset Ownership: The players
own the loot box and corresponding virtual assets in the blockchain
games because virtual assets are bound to their addresses. Hence,
the ownership enables the virtual assets to be independent of game

providers, allowing players to retain their digital properties even
after the game stops running. Besides, game players can trade the
virtual assets in the loot box with others simply by listing their
respective prices via the on-chain 2nd exChange Market (2CM). So,
when a buyer is willing to buy the item with the corresponding
price, he will transfer the corresponding price and receive the item.
In this case, the loot box for blockchain games has attracted much
interest from industry and academia in recent years. Besides, many
blockchain games which are significant to Metaverse[5, 17], such as
Gods Unchained2, Total War: Three Kingdoms3, and NBA Top Shot4,
set a loot box mechanism.
However, the blockchain-based loot box also poses new problems
for buyers and sellers. Unlike off-chain loot boxes, purchasing a
loot box in blockchain games requires a significant commission,
known as the gas fee. Due to the rapid development of blockchain,
games and on-chain applications are booming, which caused the
evolution of gas prices during the second half of 2020. For example,
in September 2019, the average price was 0.0225ETH ($4.8 at the
time), and one year later, it was 0.193ETH ($74.9 at the time), that
is, an 8500% increase [8]. Moreover, gas fees fluctuate continuously,
which will be much higher than usual during network congestion.
Besides, a freer blockchain-based 2CM will bring uncertainty to
loot box sales in the primary market, which the game providers
should consider. We aim to solve three critical questions in such
a market: 1) How should the game provider set every loot box’s
price to maximize his revenue under the uncertainty of the 2CM? 2)
Given a fixed price of each loot box, how should the players choose
their strategies to maximize their utility? 3) How does a gas fee
affect players’ behavior?
To answer the above questions, we model the interactions be-
tween the game provider and players as a two-stage Stackelberg
game. In Stage I, the game provider decides the selling price of each
loot box in the primary market. In Stage II, we model the players’
preferences based on the Hotelling line. Each player needs to decide
among the primary market, 2CM, and non-participation to maxi-
mize utility. On account of the price and demand uncertainty from
the 2CM, it is significantly challenging for the game provider to
solve problems in Stage I. For the above problem, Expected Utility
Theory (EUT) [24] is always applied to solve uncertain decision
problems. However, EUT can not reflect the complex psychology in
humans’ decision-making mechanisms, which leads to significant
inconsistencies with observations from reality. Luckily, Prospect
Theory (PT) was proposed by researchers in behavioral econom-
ics, which can more accurately describe decision-making under
uncertainty. Moreover, quite a few human behaviors that seem to
be illogical under EUT have been explained legitimately [13]. We
summarize our key results and contributions as follows.
• Blockchain-based Virtual Assets Trading Market Modeling: To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider
the blockchain-based virtual assets trading market, including
the primary market and 2CM at the same time. Besides, we
take the transparency of blockchain and the cost of the gas

fee into account and use the Stackelberg game to model the
interactions between the game provider.
• PT-based Game Provider’s Behavior Analysis: Since the game
provider decides the price of every loot box involving un-
certain demand in the future due to the appearance of 2CM,
we adopt the PT mechanism, which is a more accurate de-
scription of the decision-making uncertainty than EUT. We
consider the particularity of blockchain to show the effects
of the 2CM on players and compare the optimal decision of
the game provider under the PT model and traditional EUT
model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we
present related works and analyze their limitations. We put for-
ward the blockchain-based virtual assets trading market model and
formulate the two-stage Stackelberg game in Section 3. We analyze
the Nash equilibrium (NE) of Stage I and present the players’ best
response in Section 4. In Section 5, we solve the loot box pricing
optimization problem. We show the numerical results to analyze
players’ strategy and the impact of the PT model on the game
provider in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.
2 RELATEDWORK
2.1 Blockchain-based New Business Model
Many studies focused on building new business models on the
blockchain. Cai et al. [3] revealed the direction of blockchain devel-
opment by surveying the state-of-the-art decentralized applications
(dApps). The work in [26] considered a blockchain-based ranking
system to incentivize using renewable energy for electric vehicles.
Similarly, the study in [27] used cryptocurrency as a trustful and
privacy-preserving incentive method to reward the contribution
of users in the crowdsourcing platform. The authors in [20] imple-
mented the cryptocurrency for the store-carry-forwarding security
in vehicular networks. A study in [21] applied cryptocurrency to
create a secure service providing and data sharing between the
Internet of things devices. The paper [25] focused on using cryp-
tocurrency to guide and influence the big data industry. Fan et al.
[7] designed and implemented a smart contract to facilitate an au-
tomatic, autonomous, and auditable auction that was transparent
and decentralized. Specifically, anyone participating in the auction
can check the code and results of the auction in the smart contract.
2.2 Loot Box
A loot box is a kind of opaque selling, which is the practice of
selling items where some features of the item are hidden from the
customer until after purchase. A series of works on opaque selling
has emerged recently. Most of these studies have focused on opaque
selling as a tool to manage imbalanced customer demand or induce
opportunities for price discrimination[10, 11]. However, the loot
boxes have zero marginal cost compared with the traditional indus-
tries. Chen et al. [4] provided the first formal economics analysis of
the loot boxes. Specifically, they considered how to optimally price
the two kinds of loot boxes, including traditional loot boxes and
unique loot boxes, from the perspective of a revenue-maximizing
video game company. However, they did not consider the impact of
the 2CM on pricing and designing loot boxes from the perspective
of the game provider and players.

3 SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, wemodel the game provider’s and the players’ strate-
gies in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively. And we formulate
the two-stage Stackelberg game in Section 3.3.
3.1 Game Provider
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture for the virtual assets trading
market for blockchain games. The game provider deploys smart
contracts, which can be audited by the players, regarding the loot
box’s price and probability. Before playing the blockchain games,
the player should register an address on the blockchain.
We consider a revenue-maximizing game provider sells a catalog
of M = {1, 2, · · · , 𝑀} specific virtual items with different classes
or rarities. To simplify the presentation and better illustrate the
insights, we assume two different items (𝑀 = 2), item 𝐴 and item
𝐵, in a set of loot boxes for the rest of the paper. The probability
that the loot box is actually item 𝐴 is 𝜙𝐴 = 𝜙 ∈ [0.5, 1], while the
probability that the loot box is actually item 𝐵 is 𝜙𝐵 = 1−𝜙 . Besides,
we scale the market size to 1
5
, which is divided into three parts:
the primary market, 2CM, and non-participant market
6
. The game
provider’s revenue comes from selling loot boxes, and the virtual
items have zero marginal cost compared with the other industrial
products. Hence, the game provider’s utility can be calculated as
the product of the single loot box price and the number of loot
boxes.
5
To simplify the presentation and derive the insights, we scale the market size to 1,
which has been widely used in literature [14].
6
The non-participant market refers to players who choose to give up obtaining virtual
items because of the price.
𝑈𝑝 = 𝑃 · 𝐷𝑝 (1)
where 𝑃 refers to the price of single loot box and 𝐷𝑝 ∈ [0, 1]7 refers
to the demand of the loot boxes in the primary market.
3.2 Players
We consider a continuum of players in the virtual assets trading
market and let I = {1, 2, · · · , 𝐼 } denote the set of players and 𝑖 be
the index of the player set.
We use 𝑥 to denote the player’s type, which parameterizes its
preference for virtual items. We assume that 𝑥 is continues vari-
able and distributed uniformly over [0, 1] (i.e., 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 1]). We
consider using the Hotelling model to represent players’ preference
[9]. Over the Hotelling line [0, 1], item 𝐴 and item 𝐵 are located at
the endpoints 0 and 1, respectively. The maximum values of virtual
item 𝐴 and virtual item 𝐵 are 𝑉𝐴 and 𝑉𝐵 , respectively, such that
𝑉𝐵 > 𝑉𝐴
8
. Besides, there exists a fit-cost-coefficient 𝑡 for modeling
each player’s item preference. So, the valuation of item𝑚 for the
player 𝑖 can be represented as follows.
𝑢 𝑗 (𝑥𝑖 ) =
{
𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡𝑥𝑖 if 𝑗 = 𝐴, 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 .
𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 (1 − 𝑥𝑖 ) if 𝑗 = 𝐵, 𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 . (2)
where 𝑉𝐴 , 𝑉𝐵 , 𝑡 satisfy three basic assumptions [14]:
• 𝑉𝐴 ≥ 𝑡 and 𝑉𝐵 ≥ 𝑡 so that the buyer’s valuation 𝑢 𝑗 (𝑥𝑖 ) of
item 𝑗 is positive for any 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 1]
7
The total demand is the same as the market size, which is scaled to 1. Hence, the
demand of the primary market 𝐷𝑝 satisfies 𝐷𝑝 ∈ [0, 1].
8
This assumption is based on the fact that, for example, a Rare item is more difficult to
acquire and more expensive to buy in the 2CM than a Common one.
BSCI Session 1 BSCI '22, May 30, 2022, Nagasaki, Japan

• 𝑉𝐴 > 𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 so that the buyer located at 𝑥𝑖 = 0 would prefer
item 𝐴 over item 𝐵.
• 𝑉𝐵 > 𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡 so that the buyer located at 𝑥𝑖 = 1 would prefer
item 𝐵 over item 𝐴.
As shown in Figure 1, players can obtain the target items from
both the primary market and 2CM. Besides, players can also choose
non-participation if they think their preferred items’ prices are
higher than their expectations in the above two markets. So, we use
𝛼𝑖 to denote the strategy of the player 𝑖 . The strategy of player 𝑖 ∈ I
is to decide to choose the primary market with 𝛼𝑖 = 1, the 2CM
with 𝛼𝑖 = 2 and the non-participation with 𝛼𝑖 = 0, respectively.
A type-𝑥𝑖 players’ payoff is
• When player 𝑖 chooses to participate the primary market to
buy one loot box (i.e., 𝛼𝑖 = 1), the expected valuation of the
loot box for player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 1] can be represented
as follows.
𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 ) = 𝜙𝐴 · 𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) + 𝜙𝐵 · 𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) (3)
Hence, the utility of the player 𝑖 who chooses the primary
market is given by 𝑈𝑖 (1), where
𝑈𝑖 (1) = 𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑃 −𝐺 (4)
where 𝑃 refer to the price of each loot box which is deter-
mined by the game provider. In order to buy loot boxes,
players must pay a fee to call the smart contract, known as
"gas fee" denoted by 𝐺9
.
• When the player 𝑖 decides to take part in the 2CM to buy
the prefered virtual item from the other players directly (i.e.,
𝛼𝑖 = 2), we use 𝜋𝐴 and 𝜋𝐵 to denote the price of item 𝐴 and
item 𝐵 in the 2CM, respectively. Similarly, to buy the virtual
item from the 2CM in blockchain games, players also need to
pay gas fee 𝐺 ′
to call the smart contract, which assumed to
be equal to the gas fee to buy the loot box, such that𝐺 ′ = 𝐺 .
As a rational seller, the price of the virtual item is larger than
the price of a loot box (i.e., 𝜋𝐴 ≥ 𝑃 and 𝜋𝐵 ≥ 𝑃 ) and smaller
than the maximal value of the corresponding virtual item
(i.e., 𝜋𝐴 ∈ [𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡,𝑉𝐴] 10
and 𝜋𝐵 ∈ [𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡,𝑉𝐵] 11
). Hence,
the player 𝑖’s utility can be represented as follows.
𝑈𝑖 (2) =
{
𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐴 −𝐺, if player 𝑖 buy item 𝐴,
𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐵 −𝐺, if player 𝑖 buy item 𝐵.
(5)
• If the player 𝑖 chooses non-participation (i.e., 𝛼𝑖 = 0) and the
corresponding utility is
𝑈𝑖 (0) = 0. (6)
3.3 Two-Stage Stackelberg Problem Formulation
In this subsection, we formulate the overall problem as a two-stage
Stackelberg game.
• In Stage I, the game provider decides the selling price of each
loot box in the primary market to maximize his utility.
9
Gas fee varies with time and is uncertain. To simplify the presentation and better
illustrate the insights, we use𝐺 to represent the average gas in a period.
10𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡 represents the valuation valued by the player located at 𝑥𝑖 = 1 who prefer
item𝐴 least. There is no reason for the seller to set a price below𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡 to sell item𝐴.
11𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 represents the valuation valued by the player located at 𝑥𝑖 = 0 to prefer item
𝐵 least. There is no reason for the seller who sets a price below𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 to sell item 𝐵.
• In Stage II, each player chooses among the primary market,
2CM and non-participation.
We will use backward induction to solve this two-stage opti-
mization problem. In Section 4, We first derive the solution to the
player’s strategy problem in Stage II based on the selling price in the
primary market and 2CM. Then we deal with the game provider’s
utility maximization problem in Stage I based on the solution to
the player’s strategy problem in Section 5.
4 STAGE II: MARKET SELECTION GAME
In this section, we first formulate the players’ market selection game
in Section 4.1 and analyze the strategy of the players in Section 4.2.
4.1 Player Market Selection Game Formulation
The players12 of the market selection game is the set I.
The strategies and payoff functions of players have been defined
in Section 3.2.
Hence, the market selection game is defined as follows.
Definition 1.(Market Selection Game)
• Players: the set I.
• Stategies: 𝛼𝑖 ∈ {0, 1, 2} ,∀𝑖 ∈ I.
• Payoff:𝑈𝑖 (𝛼𝑖 ),∀𝑖 ∈ I, 𝛼𝑖 ∈ 0, 1, 2.
Definition 2.(Nash Equilibrium) A NE of market selection game is
a profile 𝜶 ∗ = {𝛼𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ I} such that for each player 𝑖 ∈ I,
𝑈𝑖 (𝛼∗𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (𝛼𝑖 )
Player 𝑖 makes a decision in the market selection game to max-
imize their payoff. The objective function can be represented as
follows.

𝑈𝑖 (𝛼𝑖 )
𝑠 .𝑡 . 𝛼𝑖 ∈ {0, 1, 2}
(7)
4.2 Analysis of Player’s Strategy
Now we study the Nash equilibrium of the above market selection
game in stage II. First, we consider the players’ preference under
Hotelling model in 3.2.
Theorem 1. The player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 𝑥∗] in the Hotelling line
will prefer item 𝐴 rather than item 𝐵, and the player located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
(𝑥∗, 1] will prefer item 𝐵 rather than item 𝐴, where 𝑥∗ = 𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡
2𝑡 .
Proof. We assume that there are only two virtual items and use
the Hotelling model to represent the players’ preferences. We use
𝑥∗ to denote the player whose valuation of the two products is the
same. Hence, 𝑥∗ can be calculated as follows.
𝑢𝐴 (𝑥∗) = 𝑢𝐵 (𝑥∗) (8)
where 𝑢𝐴 (𝑥∗) and 𝑢𝐵 (𝑥∗) means the valuation of item 𝐴 and 𝐵
valued by player located at 𝑥𝑖 , respectively. And, we can obtain that
𝑥∗ ≡ 𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡
2𝑡 .
According to the Eq. (2), 𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) is decreasing with 𝑥𝑖 , while
𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) is increasing with 𝑥𝑖 . Hence, the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
[0, 𝑥∗] buys item 𝐴, while the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥∗, 1] buys
item 𝐵. □
12
The game theory participants are the same as the participants in the game, which is
the player. To differentiate, we use player to denote the participants in game theory.

We now consider the players’ optimal strategies in the market
selection game.
4.2.1 Player’s Decision of Participating in the 2CM (𝛼𝑖 = 2).
In this scenario, the players can directly buy the in-game virtual
items from other players through the 2CM, in which players can
pay a higher fee to remove the loot box’s uncertainty. Hence, we
consider which player’s best decision is to choose the 2CM. Specifi-
cally, we consider two preferences as discussed in Theorem 1: (a)
which player prefers item 𝐴 and considers buying it from the 2CM;
and (b) which player prefers item 𝐵 and considers buying it from
the 2CM.
4.2.1.1 Case I- Consideration about Buying Item A.
In this part, we consider that the player 𝑖 prefers item 𝐴 and will
buy it from the 2CM.
Theorem 2. The player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0,min{𝑥𝐴, 𝑥 ′𝐴}] will
purchase item 𝐴 from other players in the 2CM, where
𝑥𝐴 =
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) − (𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃)
2𝑡 (1 − 𝜙) , 𝑥 ′𝐴 =
𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴 −𝐺
𝑡
.
The details are summarized in the Table 1.
Proof. According to Theorem 1, the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
[0, 𝑥∗] will prefer item 𝐴, and he can obtain item 𝐴 for sure if he
choose the 2CM. When𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (1) and𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 0, the player 𝑖’
s best strategy is to choose the 2CM to buy item 𝐴.
When𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (1), we have
𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐴 −𝐺 ≥ 𝜙𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) + (1 − 𝜙)𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑃 −𝐺
𝑥𝑖 ≤
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) − (𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃)
2𝑡 (1 − 𝜙)
(9)
We define 𝑥𝐴 ≡ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡 )−(𝜋𝐴−𝑃 )
2𝑡 (1−𝜙) , and consider three differ-
ent conditions:
• If 𝑥𝐴 < 0, we have 𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃 > (1 − 𝜙) (𝑣𝐴 − 𝑣𝐵 + 𝑡). Because
𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 1], none of the players choose the 2CM under this
condition.
• If 𝑥𝐴 ∈ [0, 𝑥∗], we have 0 ≤ 𝜋𝐴−𝑃 ≤ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡). Un-
der this condition, the player 𝑖 is located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 𝑥𝐴] will
consider to participate in the 2CM rather than the primary
market.
• If 𝑥𝐴 > 𝑥∗, we have 𝜋𝐴 < 𝑃 , which conflicts with the condi-
tion that 𝜋𝐴 ≥ 𝑃 . This condition does not exist.
Then, when 𝑥𝐴 ∈ [0, 𝑥∗], we consider another condition that
𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 0. Combined with Eq.(5), we have
𝑈𝑖 (2) = 𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐴 −𝐺 ≥ 0
𝑥𝑖 ≤
𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴 −𝐺
𝑡
(10)
We define 𝑥 ′
𝐴
≡ 𝑉𝐴−𝜋𝐴−𝐺
𝑡 , and consider the following conditions:
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐴
< 0, we have 𝐺 > 𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴 . Under this condition, the
players who consider to buy item𝐴will have negative utility.
A high gas fee will cause players to give up.
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐴
≥ 0, we have 0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐴−𝜋𝐴 . Besides,𝑈𝑖 (2) decreases
with 𝑥𝑖 . Hence, the utility of the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
[0, 𝑥 ′
𝐴
] choosing the 2CM is greater than zero.
Then, we consider 𝑥 ′
𝐴
≥ 0, so that the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
[0,min{𝑥𝐴, 𝑥 ′𝐴}] will purchase item 𝐴 from other players in the
2CM. Next, we discuss the relationship between 𝑥𝐴 and 𝑥 ′
𝐴
. We can
obtain that
𝑥𝐴 − 𝑥 ′𝐴
=
−(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 + 𝑃
2𝑡 (1 − 𝜙) .
(11)
To define the relationship, we need to discuss the gas fee:
• If 𝑥𝐴 < 𝑥 ′
𝐴
, we have 0 < 𝐺 <
(1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴−𝑃
2(1−𝜙) .
• Otherwise, we have 𝐺 ≥ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴−𝑃
2(1−𝜙) .
In conclusion, when
0 ≤ 𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃 ≤ (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡), and
0 < 𝐺 <
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃
2(1 − 𝜙) ,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 𝑥𝐴] will purchase the item 𝐴 in the

0 < 𝐺 < 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵
The details are summarized in the Table 2.
Proof. According to the Theorem 1, the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
(𝑥∗, 1] prefers item 𝐵, and he will buy item 𝐵 for sure if he choose
the 2CM. When 𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (1) and 𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 0, the player 𝑖’s best
strategy is to choose the 2CM to buy item 𝐵.
When𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (1), 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥∗, 1], we have
𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐵 −𝐺 ≥ 𝜙𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) + (1 − 𝜙)𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑃 −𝐺
𝑥𝑖 ≥
𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) + (𝜋𝐵 − 𝑃)
2𝑡𝜙
(12)
We define 𝑥𝐵 ≡ 𝜙 (𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡 )+(𝜋𝐵−𝑃 )
2𝑡𝜙
and consider two different
conditions:
• If 𝑥𝐵 < 𝑥∗, we have 𝜋𝐵 < 𝑃 , which conflicts with the condi-
tion that 𝜋𝐵 ≥ 𝑃 . This condition doesn’t exist.
• If 𝑥𝐵 ∈ [𝑥∗, 1], we have 0 ≤ 𝜋𝐵 − 𝑃 ≤ −𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 − 𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡).
Under this condition, the player 𝑖 is located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [𝑥𝐵, 1]
will consider to participate in the 2CMother than the primary
market.
• If 𝑥𝐵 > 1, we have 𝜋𝐵 − 𝑃 > −𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 − 𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡). Because
𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, 1], none of the players choose the 2CM under this
condition.
Then, when 𝑥𝐵 ∈ [𝑥∗, 1], we consider that𝑈𝑖 (2) ≥ 0, 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥∗, 1].
When 𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝜋𝐵 −𝐺 ≥ 0, we have
𝑥𝑖 ≥
𝜋𝐵 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡 +𝐺
𝑡
(13)
We define 𝑥 ′
𝐵
≡ 𝜋𝐵−𝑉𝐵+𝑡+𝐺
𝑡 , and consider the following conditions:
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐵
> 1, we have 𝐺 > 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵 so that all the players who
consider to buy item 𝐵 in the 2CM will have the negative
utility due to the high gas fee.
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐵
≤ 1, we have 0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐵 −𝜋𝐵 . The utility of the player
𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [𝑥 ′
𝐵
, 1] choosing the item 𝐵 in the 2CM is
greater than zero.
Then, when𝑥 ′
𝐵
≤ 1, the player 𝑖 is located at𝑥𝑖 ∈ [max{𝑥𝐵, 𝑥 ′𝐵}, 1],
he will purchase item 𝐵 from other players in the 2CM. Next, we
discuss the relationship between 𝑥𝐵 and 𝑥 ′
𝐵
:
𝑥𝐵 − 𝑥 ′𝐵 =
𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 − 𝑃
2𝑡𝜙
. (14)
To define the relationship, we need to discuss the selling price 𝑃
in the primary market, the selling price 𝜋𝐵 of item 𝐵 in the 2CM
and gas fee.
Firstly, let’s talk a little bit more about the range of 𝑃 :
From Eq. (3), the expected valuation of the loot box to the player
𝑖 who chooses the primary market is
𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 ) = −(2𝜙−1)𝑡𝑥𝑖 +𝑉𝐴−(1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵 +𝑡), 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵) (15)
We can see that𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 ) is a linear function and decreases in 𝑥𝑖 .𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 )
is bounded below by 𝜔 (𝑥𝐵). Hence, there is no reason for the game
provider to set a price below 𝜔 (𝑥𝐵) = 𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 .
The price of the loot box must satisfy:
𝑃 ≥ 𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 (16)
Next, we combine the discussion of the gas fee:
Due to 0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵 and 𝑃 ≥ 𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 ,
we always have 𝑥𝐵 − 𝑥 ′
𝐵
< 0 such that 𝑥𝐵 < 𝑥 ′
𝐵
.
In summary, when
𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 𝜋𝐵, and
0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [𝑥 ′
𝐵
, 1] will purchase the item 𝐵 in the
2CM.
□
4.2.2 Player’s Decision of Entering the Primary Market (𝛼𝑖 = 1).
According to the Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, when 𝑥𝐴 < 0 and
𝑥𝐵 > 1, no player will participate the 2CM. To analysis the players’
strategies under two markets at the same time, we only consider
the condition that 𝑥𝐴 ∈ [0, 𝑥∗] and 𝑥𝐵 ∈ [𝑥∗, 1] in the following
theorem.
Theorem 4. The player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐿) will purchase one
loot box in the primary market, where
𝑥𝐿 =
−(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) +𝑉𝐴 − 𝑃 −𝐺
(2𝜙 − 1)𝑡 .
The details are summarized in the Table 3.
Proof. When 𝑈𝑖 (1) > 𝑈𝑖 (2) and 𝑈𝑖 (1) ≥ 0, the player 𝑖’s best
strategy is to buy one loot box in the primary market. We first
consider the condition 𝑈𝑖 (1) > 𝑈𝑖 (2). Based on Theorem 2 and
Theorem 3, we have 0 < 𝑥𝑖 < 𝑥𝐴 and 𝑥𝐵 < 𝑥𝑖 < 1 when 𝑈𝑖 (2) >
𝑈𝑖 (1). According to Eq. (4), we have
𝑈𝑖 (1) = 𝜔 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑃 −𝐺
= −(2𝜙 − 1)𝑡𝑥𝑖 +𝑉𝐴 − (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) − 𝑃 −𝐺 (17)
where 0 ≤ 𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃 ≤ (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 − 𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) and 0 ≤ 𝜋𝐵 − 𝑃 ≤
−𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡). Hence, 𝑈𝑖 (1) is a linear function and decreases
with 𝑥𝑖 . Hence, we have 𝑥𝐴 < 𝑥𝑖 < 𝑥𝐵 when𝑈𝑖 (2) < 𝑈𝑖 (1).
Then, we consider that 𝑈𝑖 (1) ≥ 0. When
𝜙𝑢𝐴 (𝑥𝑖 ) + (1 − 𝜙)𝑢𝐵 (𝑥𝑖 ) − 𝑃 −𝐺 ≥ 0,
we have
𝑥𝑖 ≤
−(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) +𝑉𝐴 − 𝑃 −𝐺
(2𝜙 − 1)𝑡 (18)
We define 𝑥𝐿 ≡ −(1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡 )+𝑉𝐴−𝑃−𝐺
(2𝜙−1)𝑡 < 1, and consider the
following conditions:

that all the players who consider to buy the loot box in the
primary market will have the negative utility due to the high
gas fee.

The player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐿] choosing the primary
market.
Then, when𝑥𝐿 > 𝑥𝐴 , the player 𝑖 located at𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴,min{𝑥𝐵, 𝑥𝐿}]
will purchase the loot box from the primary market when 𝑥𝐿 > 𝑥𝐴 .
Next, we discuss the relationship between 𝑥𝐵 and 𝑥𝐿 :
𝑥𝐵 − 𝑥𝐿 =
−𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 + 𝑃
2𝑡𝜙 (2𝜙 − 1) (19)
where
𝜙 (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) − (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐵 ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 𝜋𝐵, and
0 < 𝐺 <
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃
2(1 − 𝜙) .
Hence, we can always get 𝑥𝐵 − 𝑥𝐿 > 0 such that 𝑥𝐵 > 𝑥𝐿 .
In conclusion, when
𝜋𝐴 − (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 𝜋𝐴, and
0 < 𝐺 <
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃
2(1 − 𝜙) .
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐿] will choose the primary market
to buy a loot box.
□
4.2.3 Player’s Decision of Non-participation (𝛼𝑖 = 0).
If the loot box prices in the primary market and the target item in
the 2CM exceed the player 𝑖’s expectation, the player 𝑖 may give
up purchasing.
Theorem5. When the player 𝑖 is located at𝑥𝑖 ∈ (max{𝑥𝐿, 𝑥 ′𝐴, 0}, 𝑥𝐵)
∪(𝑥𝐵,min{𝑥 ′
𝐵
, 1}), he will choose non-participation. The details are
summarized in Table 4.
Proof. When𝑈𝑖 (1) < 0 and𝑈𝑖 (2) < 0, a rational player 𝑖 choose
non-participation. Besides, in this part, we discuss the condition
based on 0 < 𝑥𝐴 < 𝑥∗ and 𝑥∗ < 𝑥𝐵 < 1.
According to Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, we can obtain that
the player located at [0,min{𝑥𝐴, 𝑥 ′𝐴}] and [𝑥 ′
𝐵
, 1] choose the 2CM.
Based on Theorem 4, we can get that the players located at (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐿]
choose the primary market. Hence, the rest of players choose the
non-participation.
Firstly, we need to compare the values of 𝑥𝐴 and 𝑥 ′
𝐴
. Through
proving the Theorem 2, we can notice that
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐴
< 0 such that 𝐺 > 𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴 , all the players who con-
sider to buy item 𝐴 will have negative utility. Under this
condition, the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (0, 𝑥𝐴) will choose
non-participation.
• If 0 ≤ 𝑥 ′
𝐴
< 𝑥∗, the player 𝑖 located at𝑥𝑖 ∈ (min{𝑥𝐴, 𝑥 ′𝐴}, 𝑥𝐴)
will abandon purchase.When
(1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴−𝑃
2(1−𝜙) ≤
𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴 , the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥 ′
𝐴
, 𝑥𝐴) will aban-
don purchase.
Next, we talk about the value of 𝑥𝐵 and 𝑥 ′
𝐵
. Through proving
the Theorem 3, we can notice that
• If 𝑥 ′
𝐵
> 1 such that 𝐺 > 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵 , no player will choose to
buy item 𝐵 on the 2CM. Under this condition, the player 𝑖
located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐵, 1) will choose non-participation.
• If 𝑥∗ < 𝑥 ′
𝐵
≤ 1, the player located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐵,max{𝑥𝐵, 𝑥 ′𝐵}).
Specifically, when 0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵 , the player 𝑖 located at
𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐵, 𝑥 ′𝐵) will choose non-participation.
Then, we should talk about the primarymarket. Through proving
Theorem 4, we can find that
• If 𝑥𝐿 ≤ 𝑥𝐴 such that 𝐺 ≥ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴−𝑃
2(1−𝜙) , no
players will enter into the primary market. Specifically, the
player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵) will give up the primary
market.
• If 𝑥𝐿 > 𝑥𝐴 such that 0 < 𝐺 <
(1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴−𝑃
2(1−𝜙) ,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐿, 𝑥𝐵) will abandon the pur-
chase.
In summary, gas fee has a huge impact on players’ decisions
about the participation. When
0 < 𝐺 <
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃

the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐿, 𝑥𝐵) will choose non-participation.
When
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴 − 𝑃
2(1 − 𝜙) ≤ 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥 ′

When
𝐺 > 𝑉𝐴 − 𝜋𝐴,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (0, 𝑥𝐵) will choose non-participation.
When
0 < 𝐺 ≤ 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐵, 𝑥 ′𝐵) will choose non-participation.
When
𝐺 > 𝑉𝐵 − 𝜋𝐵,
the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈ (𝑥𝐵, 1) will choose non-participation.

5 STAGE I: LOOT BOX PRICING GAME
In this section, we aim to study the game provider’s best pricing
mechanism in stage I. The game provider’s payoff comes from the
selling of loot boxes which depends on the player’s strategies in
stage II. Specifically, the players who participate in the primary
market provide the game provider revenue. However, the number
of players choosing the primary market is related to the price of
virtual items in the 2CM. Hence, The game provider designs the
loot box pricing mechanism based on his anticipation of the price
of virtual items in the 2CM.
5.1 Loot Box Pricing Game Formulation
The player of loot box pricing game is the game provider.
The strategies and the payoff function are defined in Section 3.1.
Hence, the loot box pricing game is defined as follows.
Definition 3.(Loot Box Pricing Game)
• Player : The game provider.
• Strategies: The price of every loot box 𝑃 ∈ [0, 𝜋𝐴].
• Payoff:𝑈𝑝 (𝑃), 𝑃 ∈ [0, 𝜋𝐴].
Definition 4.(Nash Equilibrium) A NE of loot box pricing game is
a profile 𝑝∗ such that for the game provider,
𝑈𝑝 (𝑃∗) ≥ 𝑈𝑝 (𝑃)
Hence, the game provider needs to deal with the following opti-
mization problem:
max 𝑈𝑝 = 𝑃 · 𝐷𝑝
𝑠 .𝑡 . 𝑃 ∈ [0, 𝜋𝐴], 𝐷𝑝 ∈ [0, 1]
(20)
where 𝐷𝑝 is estimated by the game provider because the game
provider can not know the exact prices of items in the 2CM before
he sets the price of the loot box.
5.2 Analysis of the Game Provider’s Strategy
In this part, we will solve the NE of the above pricing problem in
stage I. Specifically, we derive the game provider’s expected utility
under both EUT and PT.
5.2.1 Utility Under Expected Utility Theory (EUT).
When the game provider sets the price, he does not know the price
of the secondary market. So he needs to estimate the price of goods
in the 2CM.
In our setup, the price of item 𝑗 ( 𝑗 ∈ {𝐴, 𝐵}) is continuous. In
other words, 𝜋𝐴 ∈ [𝑉𝐴 − 𝑡,𝑉𝐴] as the price of item 𝐴 and 𝜋𝐵 ∈
[𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡,𝑉𝐵] as the price of item 𝐵 are continuous. We adopt the
result from [23] to approximate infinite continuous price of item 𝑗
with finite discrete price of item 𝑗 . We take item 𝐴 as an example.
Specifically, we divide the set of all possible continuous prices
[𝑉𝐴−𝑡,𝑉𝐴] of item𝐴 into𝐾 (𝐾 ≥ 2) discrete prices𝑉𝐴 +𝑡 ( 𝑘
𝐾−1 −1),
with the corresponding probabilities 𝑝𝐴
𝑘
, 𝑘 = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 𝐾 − 1. Then
the price of item 𝐴 on the 2CM is the summation of weighted
valuation of all discrete outcomes:
𝜋𝐴𝐸𝑈𝑇 =
𝐾−1∑︁
𝑘=0
𝑝𝐴
𝑘
[𝑉𝐴 + 𝑡 ( 𝑘
𝐾 − 1
− 1)] (21)
According to the Theorem 4, when the player 𝑖 located at 𝑥𝑖 ∈
(𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐿] will buy the loot box in the primary market, the demand
of the loot box in the primary market is:
𝐷𝐸𝑈𝑇 = 𝑥𝐿 − 𝑥𝐴
=
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
− 𝑃
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙)
(22)
where 𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
− (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
.
Next we derive the utility of the game provider under EUT. The
game provider’s expected utility is
𝑈𝐸𝑈𝑇 = 𝑃 · 𝐷𝐸𝑈𝑇
=
[(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
]𝑃 − 𝑃2
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙)
(23)
The second order partial derivative of 𝑈𝐸𝑈𝑇 with respect to 𝑃 is
𝜕2𝑈𝐸𝑈𝑇
𝜕𝑃2
=
−2
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙) < 0 (24)
which implies that 𝑈𝐸𝑈𝑇 is a concave function in 𝑃 . Hence, the
optimal solution 𝑃∗ satisfies the first order condition or lies at the
boundary point. Then, we calculate
𝜕𝑈𝐸𝑈𝑇
𝜕𝑃
=
[(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
] − 2𝑃
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙)
= 0.
(25)
so that
𝑃 =
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
2
(26)
We define 𝑃𝐸𝑈𝑇 ≡ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡−2𝐺)+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
2
.
To solve the optimal pricing problem, we should consider the
gad fee 𝐺 as follows. Let 𝐺

𝐸𝑈𝑇
≡ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡 )+(2𝜙−3)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
2(1−𝜙) and
𝐺

≡ (1−𝜙) (3𝑉𝐴−𝑉𝐵+𝑡 )+(2𝜙−3)𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
2(1−𝜙) .
• If 𝑃𝐸𝑈𝑇 ≥ 𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
, we have 𝐺 ≤ 𝐺

𝐸𝑈𝑇
. The game provider
should set the optimal price 𝑃∗ = 𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
to earn themaximum
utility.

.The
game provider should set the optimal price 𝑃∗ = 𝜋𝐴
𝐸𝑈𝑇
−
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) to win the optimal utility.
5.2.2 Utility Under Prospect Theory (PT).
The uncertainty of the prices of item𝐴 and item 𝐵 in the 2CM plays
a significant role to address the game provider’s utility maximiza-
tion problem. This motivates us to use PT as the modeling tool.
According to PT, the game provider’s cognitive has three following
characteristic:
• Loss Aversion: The game provider is more sensitive to losses
than to gains. In other words, he prefers avoiding losses to
achieving gains.
• Decision Asymmetry: The game provider is risk-averse in
gains and risk-seeking in losses.
• Weighting Distortion: The game provider psychologically
overestimates low probability events and underestimates
high probability events.
Figure 2: S-shape Asymmetric Value Function
Under PT, the S-shape asymmetric value function [12] which
maps an outcome 𝑥 to the user’s subjective valuation 𝑣 (𝑥), is given
by 𝑣 (𝑥), where:
𝑣 (𝑥) =
{
𝑥𝛽 , 𝑥 ≥ 0,
−_(−𝑥)𝛽 , 𝑥 < 0.
(27)
where 0 < 𝛽 ≤ 1, _ ≥ 1. Figure 2 shows the function under different
parameters. As the risk aversion parameter, 𝛽 is the coefficient of
diminishing marginal utility, and it suggests that as more gains
(losses) are added to the current wealth, the subjective utility of an
additional gain (loss) becomes more insignificant. The parameter _
describes the game provider’s psychology of loss aversion, which
indicates that the impact of loss is larger than that of the same
absolute value [15]. A larger _ means that the game provider is
more loss averse.
Figure 3: Probability Weighting Function
Besides, a probability weighting function captures the game
provider’s distorted perception of probability, which is:
𝐹 (𝑝) = exp (−(− ln 𝑝)𝛾 ), 0 < 𝛾 ≤ 1. (28)
where 𝛾 reveals how the game provider distorts the objective prob-
ability. Figure 3 shows the function under different 𝛾 . A smaller 𝛾
leads to a larger distortion.
From the above, we set
𝜋𝐴𝑃𝑇 =
𝐾−1∑︁
𝑘=0
𝐹 (𝑝𝐴
𝑘
) · 𝑣 [𝑉𝐴 + 𝑡 ( 𝑘
𝐾 − 1
− 1)] (29)
Next, we derive the utility of the game provider under PT. The game
provider’s prospected utility is
𝑈𝑃𝑇 = 𝑃 · 𝐷𝑃𝑇
=
[(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝑃𝑇

2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙)
(30)
where 𝜋𝐴
𝑃𝑇
− (1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 −𝑉𝐵 + 𝑡) ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 𝜋𝐴
𝑃𝑇
. The second order
partial derivative of 𝑈𝑃𝑇 with respect to 𝑃 is
𝜕2𝑈𝑃𝑇
𝜕𝑃2
=
−2
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙) < 0 (31)
which implies that 𝑈𝑃𝑇 is a concave function in 𝑃 . Hence, the
optimal solution 𝑃∗ satisfies the first order condition or lies at the
boundary point. Then, we calculate
𝜕𝑈𝑃𝑇
𝜕𝑃
=
[(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴
𝑃𝑇
] − 2𝑃
2𝑡 (2𝜙 − 1) (1 − 𝜙)

(32)
so that
𝑃 =
(1 − 𝜙) (𝑉𝐴 +𝑉𝐵 − 𝑡 − 2𝐺) + (2𝜙 − 1)𝜋𝐴

(33)
We define 𝑃𝑃𝑇 ≡ (1−𝜙) (𝑉𝐴+𝑉𝐵−𝑡−2𝐺)+(2𝜙−1)𝜋𝐴

6 SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we provide numerical results to illustrate players’
behavior and analyze the impact of the PTmodel on game provider’s
pricing strategy. For a better presentation, we set𝑉𝐴 = 2.2,𝑉𝐵 = 2.5
and 𝑡 = 0.9, and scale the loot box trading market to size 1.
6.1 How Should Players Decide on the Market
Selection?
In this part, we illustrate the impact of item 𝐴’s price 𝜋𝐴 and item
𝐵’s price 𝜋𝐵 in the 2CM, and the loot box’s price 𝑃 in the primary
market on the players’ optimal decision, shown in Figure 4. Besides,
we set 𝐺 = 0.01.
Impact of the item 𝐴’s price 𝜋𝐴 in the 2CM and loot box
probability parameter 𝜙 on the players’ strategies. We set
𝜋𝐵 = 2.2 and 𝑃 = 1.88. We considers three selling prices 𝜋𝐴 (i.e.,
𝜋𝐴 = 1.9, 𝜋𝐴 = 2.0 and 𝜋𝐴 = 2.1) and the probabilities to win
item 𝐴 in the primary market (i.e., 𝜙 = 0.6, 𝜙 = 0.7 and 𝜙 = 0.8),
respectively. From Figure 4(a), we can observe that with the fixed
probability 𝜙 , the number of people choosing to buy loot boxes
grows along with the increase in 𝜋𝐴 . The reason is that when the
price in 2CM is large enough, players tend to obtain target items via
buying loot boxes. We can also see that with the fixed price 𝜋𝐴 and
increasing probability 𝜙 , the number of players who choose to buy
item𝐴 from 2CM decreases, while the number of non-participation
players increases. The reason is that with the increasing 𝜙 , players
can obtain item𝐴 easily, but item 𝐵 hardly from the loot box. In this
case, some players who prefer item 𝐵 will choose non-participation.
It’s worth mentioning that the player’s choice to buy an item 𝐵 in
the 2CM will not be affected by the price of item 𝐴.
Impact of the item 𝐵’s price 𝜋𝐵 in the 2CM and loot box
probability parameter 𝜙 on the players’ strategies. We set
𝜋𝐴 = 1.9 and 𝑃 = 1.88. We considers three selling prices 𝜋𝐵 (i.e.,
𝜋𝐵 = 2.0, 𝜋𝐵 = 2.2 and 𝜋𝐵 = 2.4) and the probabilities to win
item 𝐴 in the primary market (i.e., 𝜙 = 0.6, 𝜙 = 0.7 and 𝜙 = 0.8),
respectively. From Figure 4(b), we can observe that the number of
players who choose to buy item 𝐵 from 2CM decreases with the
fixed probability 𝜙 and increasing price 𝜋𝐵 , while the number of
players who decide non-participation increases. The reason is that
with the increasing 𝜋𝐵 , some players who prefer item 𝐵 will choose
non-participation. Besides, with the fixed price 𝜋𝐵 , the number
of players who choose non-participation increases along with the
increasing probability 𝜙 . In this case, players can hardly win item
𝐵 in the loot box, which leads to an increase in non-participation.
Besides, the players who choose item𝐴 are not affected by the price
of item 𝐵 in the 2CM.
Impact of the loot box’s price 𝑃 in the primary market and
loot box probability parameter𝜙 on the players’ strategies.We
set 𝜋𝐴 = 1.9 and 𝜋𝐵 = 2.2. We considers three 𝑃 (i.e., 𝑃 = 1.84,
𝑃 = 1.87 and 𝑃 = 1.90) and the probabilities to win item 𝐴 in the
primary market (i.e., 𝜙 = 0.6, 𝜙 = 0.7 and 𝜙 = 0.8), respectively.
From Figure 4(c), we can see that more players will give up the
primary market with the increasing price 𝑃 and fixed probability 𝜙 ,
while the number of players who choose to buy item 𝐴 from 2CM
increased. Recall that the trading market is mature, which means
that item 𝐴 and item 𝐵 have already been listed on the secondary
market, while loot boxes are still being sold on the primary market.
Hence, the primary market will be abandoned by players as the
price of loot boxes in the primary market increases to a certain level.
Besides, the player who prefer item 𝐴 will buy it in the 2CM when

the price of the loot box increases. We can also see that the number
of players who buy item𝐴 from 2CM decreases with the fixed price
𝑃 and increasing probability 𝜙 , while the number of players who
choose non-participation increases. The reason is that when the
probability of getting item 𝐴 increases, players who prefer item 𝐴
will choose the loot box rather than the 2CM, while some of the
players who prefer item 𝐵 will choose non-participation.
6.2 How Should the Game Provider Set the
Optimal Price?
In this part, we will show the impact of the 2CM (𝜋𝐴), PT model
parameter (𝛾 and 𝛽), and loot box probability parameter (𝜙) on the
game provider’s pricing strategy and utility, shown in Figure 5.
For a better presentation, we assume 𝐾 = 2 for the rest discussion.
Specifically, the item 𝐴 has two possible values: 𝜋𝐴
𝑙
and 𝜋𝐴
ℎ
. The
probability of a low price 𝜋𝐴
𝑙
is [, while the probability of a high
price 𝜋𝐴
ℎ
is 1 − [.
Impact of the probability [ of 𝜋𝐴
𝑙
and weighting distor-
tion parameter 𝛾 on the game provider’s pricing strategy.
We set 𝛽 = 0.6 and 𝜙 = 0.6. Figure 5(a) considers three different
weighting distortion parameters: 𝛾 = 0.5, 𝛾 = 0.7 and 𝛾 = 0.9. [
is large, so the probability of a low price 𝜋𝐴
𝑙
is high. Relatively,
the probability of a high price 𝜋𝐴
ℎ
is low. Hence, the price of item
𝐴 is relatively low, which causes a lower optimal price. Besides,
the game provider psychologically overestimates low probability
events and underestimates high probability events. The smaller 𝛾
is, the greater distortion is. When the 𝛾 is higher, the optimal price
is higher. According to the Figure 3, the difference in optimal price
between 𝛾 = 0.5 and 𝛾 = 0.7 is larger than that between 𝛾 = 0.7 and
𝛾 = 0.9.
Impact of the weighting distortion parameter 𝛾 and risk
aversion parameter 𝛽 on the game provider’s pricing strategy.
We set [ = 0.6 and 𝜙 = 0.6. Figure 5(b) considers three different
risk aversion parameters: 𝛽 = 0.6, 𝛽 = 0.8, and 𝛽 = 1.0. We can
observe that optimal price 𝑃∗ rises with increasing 𝛾 . According to
the Figure 3, when [ = 0.6 , the game provider will underestimate
the probability. Besides, when 𝛾 is smaller, the distortion is greater,
which leads to a smaller optimal price. Then, we can observe the
impact of 𝛽 on the optimal price: the 𝛽 is smaller, while the optimal
price is smaller. EUT is a special case of PT where 𝛽 = 1 and 𝛾 = 1.
So, the game provider’s optimal price under PT is lower than that
under EUT. Under PT, the game provider will decide on a more
conservative pricing mechanismwhen considering his loss aversion
and risk aversion. Appropriate consideration of the game provider’s
psychological factors will improve his utility.
Impact of the selling price 𝜋𝐴 of item𝐴 in the 2CM and loot
box probability parameter 𝜙 on the game provider’s utility.
We set 𝛾 = 1.0 and 𝛽 = 1.0. Figure 5(c) considers three different loot
box probability parameters: 𝜙 = 0.6, 𝜙 = 0.7, and 𝜙 = 0.8. We can
observe that when the 𝜋𝐴 increase, the optimal utility decreases.
Specifically, when the game provider estimates that the price of
item 𝐴 will be higher, he will always set a higher selling price of
the loot box, which will cause fewer players to participate in the
primary market to buy the loot box. In this case, the game provider
will have lower utility. Besides, a higher 𝜙 will decrease the utility.
Recall that 𝜙 is the probability to win item 𝐴 after revealing the
loot box, which is less valuable than item 𝐵. When the players are
more likely to get low-value item 𝐴, some of them may give up the
purchase. Hence, if the game provider sets a high probability to get
item 𝐴, he will reduce the utility.
6.3 How Do Gas Fees Affect Players’ Behavior?
In this part, we will show the extent to which gas fee (𝐺) affects
the players’ market selections.
Impact of gas fees (𝐺) on players’ market selections. We
set 𝑃 = 1.88, 𝜋𝐴 = 1.93 and 𝜋𝐵 = 2.2. We considers four different
gas fees 𝐺 (i.e., 𝐺 = 0.01, 𝐺 = 0.10, 𝐺 = 0.27 and 𝐺 = 1.0) and
the probabilities to win item 𝐴 in the primary market (i.e., 𝜙 = 0.6,
𝜙 = 0.7 and 𝜙 = 0.8), respectively. From Figure 6, we can observe
that both the number of players choosing the primary market and
those choosing the secondary market decline when the gas fee
increases. Specifically, when 𝐺 = 0.1 and 𝜙 = 0.6, we can see that
no players will choose the primary market. Next, players give up
buying item𝐴 in the 2CMwhen𝐺 = 0.27. When G reaches a certain
value, all players will drop out of the market, neither the primary

Figure 6: The Impact of Gas Fees on Players’ Behavior
market nor the 2CM. When 𝐺 = 1.0, no one will buy the item or
loot box. Hence, gas gee has the most significant impact on the
primary market. When the gas fee is too high, players will abandon
the primary market first. The reason is that the players will bear
the uncertainty when purchasing the loot boxes. Then, the players
who choose to buy item 𝐴 in the 2CM will give up the purchase
when the gas fee increases. Due to the high value of item 𝐵, players
who choose item 𝐵 in the 2CM can afford a relatively high gas fee.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the first blockchain-based loot box
market model considering the primary market and 2CM. We show
that the players who strongly prefer one item will prioritize the
2CM. Besides, when the prices in the primary market and 2CM
and the probability of acquiring high-value items increase, some
players will abandon purchases. In addition, compared with EUT,
the game provider in PT, considering his aversion to loss and risk,
should adopt a conservative pricing mechanism to boost his utility.
Properly considering the game provider’s behavioral characteristics
can increase the utility. It is worth mentioning that the gas fee is
a significant factor in the loot box trading market for blockchain
games. When gas fee increases, the primary market will be the first
to be affected due to more significant uncertainty. Then, when the
gas fee increases, players who buy item 𝐴 in the 2CM will choose
to give up. Because item 𝐵 is relatively valuable, players who prefer
item 𝐵 can afford a higher gas fee. We conclude that the gas fee has
a more substantial effect on the primary market than the 2CM, and
players who prefer high-value items can tolerate high gas fees.
