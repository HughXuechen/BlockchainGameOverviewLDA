Abstract—The core security of proof-of-work (PoW)-based
blockchain networks, relies on PoW consensus algorithm and
requires miners solving a crypto-puzzles of hash computation.
However, the mining process in the blockchain is resource-
intensive where only the first miner who completes full PoW
will be rewarded. Therefore, miners exhibit malicious behaviors
which cause a waste of distributed computation resource, even
posing a threat on the efficiency of blockchain networks. In this
brief, we propose a new reputation-based mechanism for the
PoW computation in the blockchain, in which miners are incen-
tivized to conduct honest mining. Based on the game theory, we
design a reputation-based algorithm to encourage honest mining
of miners, and thereby increase the overall revenue of the pool.
In addition, numerical illustrations are also presented to support
the performance of our proposed mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION
BLOCKCHAIN was first proposed in the white paper of
Bitcoin by Nakamoto [1], which is used to verify and
store data with the blockchain data structure, to ensure the
security of data transmission and access with the cryptography,
and to program and manipulate data with the intelligent con-
tracts [2], [3]. As an integrated application of distributed data
storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism,
and encryption algorithm, blockchain has recently generated
explosive interest from both academia and industry [4]–[7]. A
survey of this topic can be referred to [8].
As one of the most successful applications of the blockchain
technology, the security of bitcoin system relies on blockchain

technology [9], in which the transactions are written into the
open ledger in the form of blocks. To prevent alterations of
previous transactions and maintain the integrity of the ledger,
the participants (also called miners) contribute their computa-
tional power to generate PoW by solving a hash computation
crypto-puzzles [10]. The miner solving the problem with the
fastest speed will get right to account the block and acquire
the bitcoin reward from the system [11]. After the solution is
solved by some miner and propagated to the Bitcoin network,
the block is generated. Later, a new round starts and all miners
begin to solve a new cryptographic puzzle.
However, the mining process of the blockchain is very
resource-intensive, which results in intense competitions and
malicious behaviors among miners, such as interception
attacks, selfish mining, eclipse attacks and stubborn min-
ing [12]–[15]. Take the block withholding (BWH) attack as
an example, where the infiltrating miners from other pools
only submit partial proof of work (PPoW) to the attacked
pool [16], [17]. At last, the revenue of the attacked pool is
shared among more miners, which results in the fact that each
miner earns less compared to solo mining or honest mining.
Such attack makes the pool reward system unfair for mali-
cious miners receiving unearned rewards, which threatens the
efficiency of the bitcoin system greatly. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to design an effective and fair mechanism to make miners
accountable for any malicious behaviors, and thereby promote
the efficient of blockchain networks.
To address the challenge, several literatures have been
focused on the study of the malicious behaviors for pool min-
ing. Goodrich [18] investigated a solution to prevent unfair
supervisors and lazy miners from cheating, in which the tech-
nique can be applied for preventing misbehaving miners in
the pool of blockchain networks. Moreover, Kroll et al. [19]
provided a game theoretic analysis of bitcoin, and argued
that the honest strategy constitutes an NE, implying incentive-
compatibility. Eyal and Sirer [20] introduced selfish mining,
in which the miners of a coalition keep their discovered
blocks private and continue to verify more blocks privately
until they get a sub-chain. Furthermore, Johnson et al. [21]
explored the trade-off among DDoS attacks with a series of
game-theoretical models of competition between two pools of
varying sizes, and found that pools have a greater incentive to
attack large pools than small ones.
On the other hand, reputation mechanism and some related
distributed mechanisms can provide an incentive to prevent
the malicious behaviors [22]–[26]. In addition, Sharples and
Domingue [27] proposed a blockchain-based permanent dis-
tributed record of intellectual effort which instantiates and
democratises educational reputation beyond the academic
community. Zhao et al. [7] proposed a new blockchain-based

fair payment to study the cyber physical system (CPS), in
which reputation system is applied such that a subscriber eval-
uate the published event and mark the publisher based on the
reputation.
In this brief, we propose a new reputation-based mecha-
nism to incentivize miners to conduct honest mining, thereby
promote the efficient of bitcoin system. Specifically, we first
describe the system model in term of PoW-based blockchain
network, where miners present some malicious behaviors
during the mining process. We then design a reputation mech-
anism based on the interval estimation and the fluctuation of
reputation to incentive the honest mining for miners, in which
the reputation depends on the historical evaluation. We find
that the pool manager strictly selects high-quality miners based
on the reputation mechanism we proposed, which contributes
understanding for PoW consensus algorithm and provides a
new method to explore the bitcoin system.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND REPUTATION MECHANISM
A. System Model
Consider a PoW-based blockchain network with J individual
miners, which organize themselves into I mining pools in solv-
ing a crypto-puzzle competition to win the reward. According
to the Nakamoto Consensus protocol [1], only the pool which
accomplishes the PoW firstly will be rewarded. Therefore, we
pay our attention to the payoff of miners in the target pool.
Define the strategy set of miners as S = {H, D}, where H
stands for honest mining and D stands for dishonest mining.
During the mining process, rational miners will take actions to
maximize their own benefits. However, the resource of PoW
computation is consumable, which gives rise to the fact that
miners present some malicious behaviors during the compe-
tition mining process. These malicious behaviors may cause
a waste of distributed computation resource, even posing a
threat on the efficiency of blockchain networks.
To encourage miners presenting honest mining, we design a
reputation approach to constrain the miners’ malicious behav-
iors, in which the history of miners’ behavior is evolved.
Consider a randomly selected miner in the pool as a pool man-
ager, who will evaluate the satisfaction of each miner involved
in mining. Denote the pool manager as Mi, where 1 ≤ i ≤ I is
the identity of the pool manager. Denote the general miner as
mj, where 1 ≤ j ≤ J is the identity of the miners. The evalua-
tion of the satisfaction for the manager Mi towards the miner
j is recorded as Pi[j], where −1 ≤ Pi[j] ≤ 1. Here, Pi[j] = 1
means that the manager is very satisfied with the miner; while
Pi[j] = −1 means the manager is very dissatisfied with the
miner.
After the n-th transaction, the satisfaction of the miner is
recorded as Xjn (Xjn ∈ Pi[j]). We record this history satisfac-
tion of each miner as a reputation set hj = {Xj1, Xj2, . . . , Xjn}.
Since the reputation level of a miner is constantly changing
within a certain range, we use the probability interval to define
the level of reputation. Before starting to mine, the manager
sets the reputation access threshold of the open pool, which is
denoted as v0. If the reputation of miner is below the value of
v0, he is not eligible to join the pool. In addition, we use the
reputation fluctuation to judge whether a miner is reliable or
not based on the probability interval. Denote the fluctuation
value of the reputation as σj. Similarly, the manager sets the
reputation fluctuation threshold of the open pool as σ0. If the
miner’s σj < σ0, he will be kicked out of the mining pool.
B. Interval Estimation of Reputation
According to the data hj = {Xj1, Xj2, . . . , Xjn}, we give
the calculation method of reputation interval. Denote the
expectation and variance of the miners’ reputation history as
μj = E(Xj) and σj = D(Xj), respectively. According to central-
limit theorem for independent identically, the arithmetic mean
of the random variable {Xj1, Xj2, . . . , Xjn} is expressed as
X̄j = (1/n)
∑n
i=1 Xji. When n → ∞, i.e., the number of
historical transactions of the miners is sufficiently large, the
approximate distribution is expected to obey normal distribu-
tion with a variance of μj of σ 2
j /n. Through using the interval
estimation theory, we get
X̄j − μj
σj√

where X̄j = 1

n−1
∑
Pi[j]∈hj
(Pi[j] − X̄j)
2, and t
represents the t-distribution with a degree of freedom n − 1.
By simply calculation, we can get the confidence level interval
(1 − a) as
Rj[a] = (X̄j − σj√
n
t a
2
(n − 1), X̄j + σj√
n
t a
2
(n − 1)). (2)
Here, Rj[a] is the fluctuation range of the reputation we
requested. The reputation of miner j is within the interval
(X̄j − (σj/
√
n)t a
2
(n − 1), X̄j + (σj/
√
n)t a
2
(n − 1)) with a
probability of (1 − a).
C. Measuring the Fluctuation of Reputation
The pool manager judges a miner’s reputation fluctuations
based on corresponding reputation interval. The higher the
fluctuation value is, the more likely to be dishonest the miner
is. Thus, the pool manager takes a miner’s reputation fluctu-
ation as a measurement to decide whether to allow the miner
to join the pool.
Based on the miner’s historical behavior record hj =
{Xj1, Xj2, . . . , Xjn}, we make the following assumptions:
{
H0 : σ 2
j ≤ σ 2
0 ,
H1 : σ 2
j > σ 2
0 .
(3)
Here, σ0 is the threshold of the reputation, which is an
adjustable parameter. If the actual value is greater than σ 2
0 ,
the historical reputation value of miner j is excessively fluc-
tuating. Thus, it is important to set a suitable threshold. If
the threshold is set too high, a large number of miners will
not be able to join the pool, which results in the fact that the
overall revenue of the system decreases. If the threshold is set
too low, it will allow too much attackers to take advantage
of the honest mining and share the final reward. Furthermore,
we propose a hypothesis test with a significant level of α. The
calculated test statistic is
(n − 1)σ 2
j
σ 2
0
∼ χ2
α(n − 1). (4)
And the rejection interval is

j ≥ σ 2

In terms of the above assumptions and the hypothesis test,
we can judge whether a miner is reliable or not. That is, once
σ 2
j fall into the rejection interval, we refuse to believe that the
historical reputation value of miner j is reliable.
III. HONEST MINING WITH REPUTATION MECHANISM
In this section, we consider the accumulated benefits of
miners, in which miners adjust their strategies according to
the reward they received. To restrict dishonest miners in the
pool, we introduce a concept of life time Lj which represents a
miner’s mining age in the pool. Further, we define the miner’s
attack probability Q as follows:
Q =
{
0, if X̄j + σj√
n
t a
2
(n − 1) ≤ v0
μj−(|Xjn−X̄j|+v0)
μj
, if X̄j + σj√
n
t a
2
(n − 1) > v0.
(6)
Denote the payoff of miner j with the strategy S as sj(S), where
sj(H) = Q and sj(D) = 0. Accordingly, we get the long-term
benefits Uj(S) as follows:
Uj(S) = (X̄j − μj) + sj(S) + Lj/σ
2
j . (7)
According to the Eq. (9), we design a reputation-based algo-
rithm to incentive miners mining honestly. The detailed steps
of Algorithm 1 are listed as follows.
S1) Initialization: Before pool i’s n-th transaction, the
system initialize every miner mj’s latest record Lj, X̄j, Rj[a], σj
automatically. At the same time, the pool manager Mi of the
target pool i is selected randomly.
S2) Standard Setting: The pool manager Mi sets the rep-
utation access threshold v0 and the reputation fluctuation
threshold σ0.
S3) Access Conditions: Every miner mj sends application to
their target pool i. The pool manager decides whether to allow
them to join the pool based on pre-set criteria v0 and σ0. If
X̄j + (σj/
√
n)t a
2
(n−1) ≤ v0 and σ 2
j ≤ (σ 2
0 χ2
α(n − 1))/(n − 1),
then Lj = Lj+1. This means miner enter the pool successfully.
Otherwise Lj = Lj−1, which means the miner is failed to enter
the pool and the miner have to mine independently. Specially,
if a miner’s Lj = 0, then the identity of the miner will be
automatically destroyed after leaving the pool, which means
that his accumulated benefits are empty. Consequently, he has
to apply a new account with initialized data. It is pointed out
that the miner is eligible to enter the pool until the reputation
value and reputation fluctuation value come up to the threshold
together.
S4) Strategy Updating: Rational miners have two strate-
gies to choose, which accounts for different payoffs. One is
Uj(H) = (X̄j − μj) + [μj − (|Xjn − X̄j| + v0)]/μj + Lj/σ
2
j , the
other is Uj(D) = (X̄j − μj) + 0 + Lj/σ
2
j . The miners decide to
choose the strategies according to their accumulated benefits.
S5) Reputation Updating: After this mining competition, the
pool manager will evaluate the satisfaction Pi[j] to each miner
according to their contribution. And every miner’s satisfaction
record is updated as hj = {Xj1, Xj2, . . . , Xjn}. Then we can get
reputation fluctuation σj = (1/(n − 1))
∑
Pi[j]∈hj
(Pi[j] − X̄j)
2.
Finally, miner mj’s newest reputation interval is updated as
Rj[a] = (X̄j − (σj/
√
n)t a
2
(n − 1), X̄j + (σj/
√
n)t a

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
In the experimental environment, we set J = 100 and the
confidence level of each round as 0.95. Each mining pool
selects the miner with the highest reputation as the pool man-
ager. The satisfaction rating of pool manager towards each
miner is calculated according to the contribution of the min-
ers. Repeat the operation 30 times without adding reputation
rule to form an initial database. After a period of time, the
incentive functions of our reputation mechanism are activated.
The fluctuations for the credibility of miners with differ-
ent number of mining rounds are shown in Fig. 1. Compared

with Fig. 1(a), we see that the level of reputation fluctuations
in Fig. 1(b) is relatively stable, which reflects that miners con-
tribute relatively stable computing power. This provides a clue
for the manager to evaluate the reputation of miners, which
shows that only miners with a stable reputation and high cred-
ibility (exceeds the threshold) are eligible to participate in the
mining pool. As the satisfaction evaluations of miner for each
mining changing, their reputation intervals also change accord-
ingly. In Fig. 2, we plot the variation of honest miners and
dishonest miners in the width of the reputation interval. We
find that the reputation interval of miners with more fluctu-
ations is greater than that of miners with less fluctuations.
Therefore, the width of the reputation interval can also be
used as an indicator for the manager to judge the reputation
of miners.
Set the threshold of the miners’ reputation fluctuations be
v0 = {0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35} and σ0 = {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}. It is
shown in Fig. 3 that the number of miners who choose the
honest mining strategy in different pools presents an increasing
trend. When the entry threshold v0 is too low, it is impossible
to judge the probability of miner taking the attack strategy in
early stage, which means that the detection function of repu-
tation mechanism does not work well. As the entry threshold
v0 is increased, it is better to distinguish the dishonest min-
ers. With the decision of miners during each round of mining,
the rational mining union tends to choose honest mining. The
similar result is found with parameter σ0, which is shown
in Fig. 4. When the threshold σ0 is small, the abnormality
of node detecting with the fluctuation is too sensitive, which

leads to misjudgment of the normal behavior of some honest
miners. When the threshold σ0 is too large, it is not easy to
detect some miners with abnormal behavior. Thus, it is impor-
tant to choose appropriate reputation access threshold v0 and
fluctuation threshold σ0.
To describe the performance of the reputation mechanism,
we plot the proportion of honest miner with no-reputation and
reputation in Fig. 5. It is shown that the proportion of honest
miners with reputation mechanism has a notable improvement
compared the situation with no-reputation. Furthermore, we
explore the accumulated benefits for miners. It is show in
Fig. 6 that when miners tend to mine more honestly, the accu-
mulated benefits becomes higher. For the pool manager, setting

the threshold of the access reputation in the pool is benefi-
cial to protect his mining pool from any malicious attacks,
thus maximizing the income of the mine pool. Under our
reputation-based mechanism, as the number of miners who
have been mining honestly increased, the overall income of
pools begins to show an upward trend (See Fig. 6). It is
also shown that the rationality of the reputation admission
parameters set by the pool manager affects the overall revenue
of mining pools. The more reasonable the reputation access
criterion is, the higher the revenue receives.
V. CONCLUSION
The reputation interval designed in this brief is a preven-
tive mechanism, which can discriminate potential attackers
at the source and prevent attackers from joining the mining
pool. The reputation fluctuation is a detection mechanism to
determine whether the miners in the mining pool have dis-
honest aggressive behavior. By applying the reputation-based
mechanism we designed, miners tend to mine honestly for
higher accumulated benefits and ultimately achieve a consen-
sus on stable state. In this brief, we propose a reputation-based
mechanism that encourages rational miners to mine honestly.
Through two evaluation of reputation with interval estima-
tion and fluctuation measuring, the judgment of the identity
of dishonest miners is basically realized. According to the
reputation-based mechanism we proposed, the pool manager
strictly selects high-quality miners, which is very beneficial to
the development of the bitcoin system.
