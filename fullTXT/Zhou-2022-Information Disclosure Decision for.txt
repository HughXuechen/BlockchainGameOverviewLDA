Abstract: (1) Background: With the development of blockchain technology and fierce competition
between tourism platforms, tourism platforms can adopt blockchain technology to disclose product
information to enhance their core competitiveness. As for a tourism O2O, i.e., online to offline, supply
chain, the tourism platform sells the product online, and the tour operator provides services offline.
(2) Methods: We establish a game theory model and study the optimal strategies of supply chain
members in two scenarios (decentralized and centralized) when the online platform does not adopt
or adopts blockchain technology. Then, we introduce a two-part tariff contract for coordination. Fur-
thermore, we discuss the impact of the cost of adopting blockchain technology, disclosing information
and the proportion of information-sensitive consumers on the optimal strategies. (3) Conclusions:
When the costs of adopting blockchain technology and information disclosure are low, if the pro-
portion of information-sensitive consumers is large, adopting blockchain technology is beneficial
to supply chain members. Compared with a wholesale price contract, a two-part tariff contract can
encourage the platform to improve information disclosure quality, so the tour operator can adjust
their cooperation contract to achieve Pareto improvements. Under a two-part tariff contract, the
tourism platforms are more likely to disclose information and can effectively regulate the operational
performance of the tourism O2O supply chain.

1. Introduction
In recent years, O2O, i.e., online to offline, has emerged as a new e-commerce model
that is different from traditional models of e-commerce. In this model, consumers can
obtain information, subscribe to products from an online channel, and then consume them
at offline stores. The rapid development of the O2O model has promoted the rise of online
tourism platforms. Some tour operators choose to cooperate with online tourism platforms
to sell tourism products aimed at expanding market demand. As for a tourism O2O
supply chain, tourism platform sells their product online, and the tour operator provides
services offline. Through the division of labor and cooperation, both of them can focus
on exerting their respective advantages to achieve a win-win situation. Under the O2O
tourism model, consumers can book tourism products through an online platform anytime
and anywhere. Before making their final decision, consumers often browse the information
displayed on the web page of online tourism platforms, especially the existing reviews.
However, the trustworthiness of the information is sometimes questioned because fake
reviews are very common on online platforms [1]. Because the online platform is under
the control of the data, so that information is asymmetric, there will be problems such as

fake reviews, rating fraud, false propaganda, etc. This phenomenon puts consumers at an
information disadvantage. According to the “Online Tourism Consumption Trends and
Consumer Rights Protection Trend Report (2019)”, the issues of online tourism platforms
are mainly concentrated in ten aspects, including information leakage, false propaganda,
tourism products by big data analysis to harm the revenue of existing consumers and
review data fraud. Among them, Fliggy and Ctrip accounted for 8 complaints, and Qunar
accounted for 6. Mafengwo was exposed to data fraud in 2018, including brushing to
increase sales, submit false reviews, and falsify relevant data through online crawling (http:
//tradeinservices.mofcom.gov.cn/article/yanjiu/hangyezk/201904/81733.html, accessed
on 23 April 2019). These problems not only affect the tourism experience of consumers
and reduce consumer satisfaction but also damage the reputation of the tourism platform
and weaken consumers’ trust in the platform. The purchase behavior of consumers on
the online tourism platform is affected by product evaluation and transaction security, but
the current product review data lacks authenticity because it is controlled by the platform
in the background [2]. Therefore, it is urgent to take measures to improve information
asymmetry. As an emerging technology, blockchain is a distributed ledger based on a
consensus mechanism [3], which is composed of interconnected blocks. Through these
blocks, transaction data can be easily traced. Therefore, this technology can maintain
the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of transaction data and has the functions of
preventing risks and enhancing trust [4]. It will have great potential implications for the
tourism industry [5]. According to information asymmetry, the online tourism platform
can build a common review and rating system based on blockchain technology, which
can avoid the above problems from the technical level. Therefore, the platform can adopt
this mechanism, which can increase the trustworthiness of the information disclosure and
consumers’ trust in them.
In the traditional model, the reviews are manipulated by the online tourism platform.
For example, on the website of Qunar, it is common for real reviews to be hidden or
deleted. Some platforms fabricate user reviews to conduct false or misleading commercial
propaganda in order to deceive and mislead consumers. Generally, a centralized data
storage model is adopted, and the data is managed centrally. When the information is
unfavorable to the relevant stakeholders, there is the possibility of artificially tampering
with the product information. While building a system based on blockchain technology,
the data will be stored on a peer-to-peer network. The task of adding and verifying
new review data is taken over by nodes among the blockchain, which need to consume
computing power. Therefore, the platform should reward the nodes who have added the
data to the blockchain. Furthermore, the cost of adopting blockchain technology is high.
Therefore, online tourism platforms need to balance the benefits and costs of adopting
blockchain technology.
Based on the above background, considering the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers and the cost of adopting blockchain technology, should the online tourism
platform adopt blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure?
This is the focus of this paper. This paper mainly studies the following questions:
(1) Whether the online platform adopts blockchain technology or not, what are the
optimal strategies of the tourism O2O supply chain members?
(2) Under what conditions should the online platform adopt blockchain technology to
improve the quality of information disclosure?
(3) When a two-part tariff contract is used for supply chain coordination, how will the
optimal strategies and profits of the supply chain members change?
(4) Under the two types of contracts, which parameter affects the optimal strategies?
The structure of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related
literature. In Section 3, we describe the problems and build the benchmark model. In
Section 4, an analysis of the optimal strategies and profits of the supply chain member
without blockchain technology in two scenarios (decentralized scenario and centralized
scenario) is presented. In Section 5, an analysis of the optimal strategies and profit of

the supply chain member with blockchain technology in two scenarios is presented. In
Section 6, we introduce the two-part tariff for supply chain coordination in two scenarios. In
Section 7, some conclusions are verified by the numerical analysis. In Section 8, conclusions,
management implications, and future research directions are given.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Tourism O2O
In recent years, the O2O model has become very common in the tourism industry [6].
Consumers can obtain information, book tourism products from an online channel, and
then consume in an offline channel. It is difficult for some tourism firms to open an online
channel due to technology and funding, so online platforms are usually developed by an
online tourism agency [7]. More and more people search for ticket and hotel information
before booking online and traveling. In O2O e-commerce, the perceived effectiveness of
online reviews has an indirect effect on the consumer’s purchase intention [8]. Filieri [9]
pointed out that an increasing number of consumers make decisions about tourism products
based on online reviews. Trust plays a crucial role in that process; an online platform, such
as Airbnb, is responsible for building trust among the users [10]. However, it is common for
managers to offer a discount to consumers in exchange for positive reviews and are prone to
tampering with the reviews and ratings, so the trustworthiness of online information is low.
The contents of consumer feedback are prone to being influenced by the sellers [11]. Online
fake reviews and rating fraud often cause consumers to have wrong expectations and
judgments towards tourism products, which affects the travel experience and even yields
travel disputes. With the increase in tourism product reviews, the consumers can obtain
information from the online tourism platform conveniently, although the trustworthiness
of the information is unknown, which will increase the cognitive cost [12]. Sometimes,
negative reviews are more reliable and crucial than positive reviews in the decision-making
process [13]. At present, deceptive reviews can be identified through text analysis. However,
this still does not solve the root problem of deceptive reviews as long as the reviews are
manipulated by the online tourism platform. The existence of review manipulation can
decrease the informativeness and quality of online reviews [14]. Zulfiqar [15] believes
that a centralized underlying architecture is the fundamental reason for fake reviews and
proposes a product review system based on blockchain technology, which is composed of a
P2P network, to verify the truthfulness of consumer reviews. Cai and Zhu [16] presented
how blockchain technology can be used to redesign the user feedback system to prevent
information fraud.
2.2. Blockchain Technology
In the field of supply chain management, blockchain technology has been applied
to many industries. For example, in luxury goods, the Everledger platform based on
blockchain technology is used for diamond quality identification and source recording
of each diamond, including source, screen, certification, storage, and sale. Choi [17] es-
tablished a model to compare the difference between traditional diamond retail channels
and blockchain-based platform sales channels and then analyzed the value of blockchain
technology to the diamond supply chain. Min [18] said that the distributed accounting
characteristics of blockchain could help the supply chain reduce potential risks such as
fraud, hacker attacks, and contract disputes. In the manufacturing industry, the adoption
of blockchain technology in the supply chain can reduce the impact of supply interruption,
which is beneficial to downstream enterprises to take preventive and proactive risk man-
agement measures to respond and achieve the stability of the supply chain [19]. Lin [20]
analyzed the role of blockchain technology in food quality and safety management. An in-
formation traceability system can be established to prevent and detect food safety problems
so that when problems occur, it is easy to find the root cause of the problem and pursue
related responsibilities. Shen [21] pointed out that although traditional RFID technology
can also track product information, the product information is subject to modification
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 4 of 21
due to centralized management, so consumers do not trust it highly, but the blockchain
technology uses a decentralized distributed ledger to display product information, which
can avoid the phenomenon of data being arbitrarily modified and enhance consumer trust.
With the increasing application of blockchain technology and the prominent problem
of information asymmetry in the tourism market, some scholars and practitioners have
proposed applying blockchain technology to the tourism industry. At present, some tourism
companies have also begun to adopt blockchain technology to enhance their competitive
advantages [22], such as the Winding Tree in Switzerland, Tourism Chain in Russia, Cool
Cousin in the United Kingdom, etc. These tourism companies support consumers to use
Bitcoin as the payment option without third-party assistance and extra costs, which is easy,
secure and traceable [23]. Blockchain technology has unique advantages in information
protection. Willie [24] pointed out that blockchain technology can create a reliable and
safe digital environment for the tourism industry, which can be used for the transmission
and sharing of passenger information to provide better services to consumers. The shared
database based on blockchain technology can be developed among the tourism companies,
which can simplify the validation procedure and protect the tourist information from
leakage [25]. Blockchain technology can also be used to monitor the movement of luggage
during the trip so that a tourist can track their baggage and know where it is. In the
traditional way, membership point activities are a common way for companies to create
customer loyalty on the online tourism platform. Blockchain technology can make it
more attractive and exchange consumers for token rewards. Using blockchain can also
create a trusted scoring system to help consumers make correct decisions about tourism
destinations [2].
From reviewing the related literature, we can know the characteristic of blockchain
technology and its potential applications in the tourism industry. However, there are some
limitations in the existing literature. The existing literature is mainly concentrated on the
empirical analysis of blockchain technology applications in the tourism industry. Whether
to adopt blockchain technology or not and under what conditions should blockchain
technology be adopted have not been considered. Therefore, this paper is aimed at making
up for these limitations of the existing literature.
3. Problem Description
We consider a tourism O2O supply chain composed of an online tourism platform
and a tour operator; the structure is shown in Figure 1. The tour operator is responsible
for providing the product or services offline, and the tourism platform is responsible
for sales online. The two parties cooperate through the wholesale price contract; that is,
the tour operator sells a tourism product with a fixed unit cost cT to the online tourism
platform at a wholesale price w, and the platform sells the products to consumers at a
sales price p. Additionally, the unit sales cost of each tourism product is cO. Due to a large
number of online tourism platforms, the phenomenon of homogeneity is more serious,
and the competition in the online tourism platforms is relatively high; thus, the tour
operator is in a leadership position and can choose a platform to cooperate with. The online
tourism platform determines the sales price under the given wholesale price to ensure profit
maximization. At present, online tourism platforms have problems such as fake reviews
and rating fraud, which leads consumers to distrust these platforms. Blockchain technology
has the characteristics of being non-tamperable, demonstrating traceability, requiring multi-
agent verification, and exhibiting high transparency. Therefore, the online tourism platform
can adopt blockchain technology to upload product information, transaction records,
and consumer reviews to ensure that the information is reliable and traceable, which
can strengthen consumers’ trust in the platform and enhance the platform’s competitive
advantage. Suppose that the tourism platform builds a public alliance blockchain, which
consists of the platform and miners as the nodes. When the platform wants to upload
consumer reviews or product information, it needs to broadcast and send authentication
requests to nodes on the blockchain. Then, the node needs to verify the consumer reviews
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 5 of 21
and product information; only the verified data will be recorded on the blockchain in
chronological order. Users authorized by the platform can send product information query
requests to the blockchain and receive related product information. In the information
validation process, nodes consume manpower and material resources. Therefore, the
online tourism platform should reward nodes that participate in the validation so that the
nodes will have the motivation to contribute their resources to participate in verifying the
trustfulness of information. The reward can be regarded as the cost of the online tourism
platform to improve the quality of information disclosure. If the online tourism platform
chooses to disclose information through blockchain technology, it needs to invest a certain
amount of funds to update the hardware and software facilities to implement blockchain
technology. Suppose that the initial investment of blockchain technology is F, the quality of
information before introducing blockchain technology is αO, and after the introduction of
blockchain, the quality is α + αO. For the convenience of subsequent comparison, we assume
that αO = 0; then, the information disclosure quality after the introduction of blockchain
technology is α. The information disclosed through blockchain technology needs to be
verified by other nodes. The greater improvement in information disclosure quality means
that the nodes need to spend a lot of computing power to verify the information, and
the online tourism platform also needs to pay more rewards. Therefore, it is assumed
that the cost of improving information quality is kα2/2, where k is the cost coefficient of
information disclosure. On this basis, this research constructs a tourism O2O model: a
tourism operator only provides a kind of tourism product, and an online tourism platform
buys tourism products from the tourism operator at wholesale prices and then sells to
consumers. Consumers who buy tourism products online need to go offline to enjoy the
services provided by the tour operator. As the leader, the tourism operator determines the
wholesale price, and the online tourism platform as the follower determines whether to
introduce the blockchain to disclose information, the quality of information disclosure, and
sales price.

ism platform to improve the quality of information disclosure. If the online tourism plat‐
form chooses to disclose information through blockchain technology, it needs to invest a 
certain  amount of  funds  to update  the hardware  and  software  facilities  to  implement 
blockchain technology. Suppose that the initial investment of blockchain technology is F, 
the quality of information before introducing blockchain technology is O, and after the 
introduction of blockchain, the quality is  + O. For the convenience of subsequent com‐
parison, we assume that O = 0; then, the information disclosure quality after the introduc‐
tion of blockchain technology is . The information disclosed through blockchain technol‐
ogy needs to be verified by other nodes. The greater improvement in information disclo‐

termines the wholesale price, and the online tourism platform as the follower determines 
whether to introduce the blockchain to disclose information, the quality of information 
disclosure, and sales price.

The higher the quality of  information disclosure,  the more quickly consumers can 
understand the product and make purchase decisions, which can increase their utilities 
[26]. Now suppose that the utility of the consumer will be affected by perceived value [27], 
product price [28], and information disclosed quality [26]. Consumers’ perceived value v 
is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], and information‐sensitive consumers have a sensitivity 
coefficient of 1 to the information quality. The online platform’s decision to improve the 
quality of information disclosure can be marked as  𝛼, where 𝛼 ∈ 0,𝛼 . Then, the utility 
functions  of  information‐sensitive  and  information‐insensitive  consumers  can  be  ex‐
pressed as  𝑣 𝑝 𝛼  and  𝑣 𝑝, respectively. Without loss of generality, the number of 
Figure 1. The structure of the tourism O2O supply chain.
The higher the quality of information disclosure, the more quickly consumers can
understand the product and make purchase decisions, which can increase their utilities [26].
Now suppose that the utility of the consumer will be affected by perceived value [27],
product price [28], and information disclosed quality [26]. Consumers’ perceived value v
is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], and information-sensitive consumers have a sensitivity
coefficient of 1 to the information quality. The online platform’s decision to improve the
quality of information disclosure can be marked as α̂, where α̂ ∈ (0, α). Then, the utility
functions of information-sensitive and information-insensitive consumers can be expressed
as v− p + α̂ and v− p, respectively. Without loss of generality, the number of potential
consumers in the market is normalized to 1, in which the proportion of information-
sensitive consumers is λ, and the proportion of information-insensitive consumers is 1 − λ.
Then. the market demand function D can be expressed as:
D = λ

p−α̂
f (v)dv + (1− λ)
∫ 1
p
f (v)dv = 1− p + λα̂ (1)
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 6 of 21
4. The Scenario without Adopting Blockchain Technology
When the tour operator does not adopt blockchain technology, that is α̂ = 0. Then, the
demand can be expressed as:
D = 1 − p (2)
4.1. Decentralized Scenario (WN)
In the decentralized scenario, the tour operator and the online tourism platform only
focus on their own profits. The sequence of events is as follows: the tour operator charges
wholesale prices from the online tourism platform. After that, the online tourism platform
determines the sale price p. In this case, there is a Stackelberg game between the tour
operator and the online tourism platform. The profit functions of the tour operator and
online tourism platform are, respectively, expressed as:
ΠT(w) = (1− p)(w− cT) (3)
ΠO(p) = (1− p)(p− w− cO) (4)
Proposition 1. In the decentralized scenario, if the online tourism platform does not adopt
blockchain technology to disclose information, the equilibrium results, including the sales
price pWN, wholesale price wWN, market demand DWN, online tourism platform profit
ΠO
WN, tour operator profit ΠT
WN and supply chain total profit ΠWN, are shown as follows:
pWN =

(10)
Proof of Proposition 1. In the decentralized scenario, when the online platform does not
adopt blockchain technology, the tour operator is the leader and determines the wholesale
price; the online platform is the follower and determines the sales price. By using backward
induction, we can first determine the second-order derivative of the platform’s profit with
respect to to p: ∂2 ∏O
∂2 p = −2 < 0, then we can find ∏O is concave in p. Then, the optimal
sales price p(w) can be obtained according to ∂ ∏O
∂p = 0. Substituting p(w) into the provider’s
profit function ∏T and determining the second derivative with respect to w, then we
can obtain ∂2 ∏T
∂2w = −1 < 0 and find that ∏T is also concave in w. Then we can get the
optimal wholesale price w of the provider through solving ∂ ∏T
∂w = 0. By substituting w into
Formulas (3) and (4), we can obtain the optimal equilibrium results. �
From Proposition 1, we can know that the price strategy and profits of the tour operator
and online tourism platform are related to the unit cost of both parties. Among them, the
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 7 of 21
wholesale price and sales price are positively correlated with unit production cost and
unit sales cost, while the profits of both parties are negatively correlated with these unit
costs. This is because as the unit costs of the tour operator and online tourism platform
increase, the product sales price will increase, which can reduce product demand and lead
to a decline in the profits of the tour operator and the online platform.
4.2. Centralized Scenario (WC)
In the centralized scenario, if the online tourism platform does not adopt blockchain
technology to disclose more information, the tour operator and the online tourism platform
make decisions jointly. The total profit function of the tourism O2O supply chain can be
expressed as
∏(p) = (p− cO − cT)(1− p) (11)
Proposition 2. In the centralized scenario, if the online tourism platform does not adopt
blockchain technology, the equilibrium results, including sales price pWC, market demand
DWC, and supply chain total profit ΠWC are:
pWC =
1 + cO + cT

(12)
DWC =
1− cO − cT
2
(13)
∏WC
=
(1− cO − cT)

4
(14)
Proof of Proposition 2. In the centralized scenario, when the online platform does not
adopt blockchain technology, the tour operator and online platform determine the sales
price jointly. We can first calculate the second-order derivative of the supply chain total
profit with respect to p: ∂2 ∏
∂2 p = −2 < 0, then, we can know that ∏ is concave in p.
Therefore, the optimal sales price p can be obtained according to ∂ ∏
∂p = 0. Substituting p
into Formula (11), we can obtain the optimal equilibrium results. �
Corollary 1. If the online tourism platform does not adopt blockchain technology to
improve the information disclosure quality, then we have: pWC < pWN ,DWC > DWN ,
∏WC > ∏WN .
Proof of Corollary 1. By comparing Equations (5) and (12), (7) and (13), and (10) and
(14), we can obtain pWN − pWC = 1−cO−cT
4 > 0, DWC − DWN = 1−cO−cT
4 > 0, and
∏WC −∏WN = (1−cO−cT)
2
16 > 0. �
Corollary 1 indicates that without blockchain technology, the sales price of the tourism
product in the centralized scenario is lower than in the decentralized scenario, whereas
the market demand and total revenue of the supply chain in the centralized scenario are
greater than that in the decentralized scenario. It notes that when the node enterprises in
the supply chain make decisions aimed at the overall profit maximization, the supply chain
performance in that scenario is greater than that in the decentralized scenario.

5. The Scenario with Adopting Blockchain Technology
When the online platform adopts blockchain technology to improve the quality of
information disclosure, that is α̂ = α, then the market demand can be expressed as:

5.1. Decentralized Scenario (BN)
In the decentralized scenario, if the online tourism platform adopts blockchain tech-
nology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the profits of the online tourism
platform and tour operator can be expressed as:
∏T(w) = (w− cT)(1− p + λα) (16)
∏O(p, α) = (p− w− cO)(1− p + λα)− k

α2 − F (17)

technology to disclose information, the equilibrium results, including the information disclosure
quality αBN, sales price pBN, wholesale sales price wBN, market demand DBN, online tourism

Proof of Proposition 3. In the decentralized scenario, when the online platform adopts
blockchain technology, the tour operator is the leader and determines the wholesale price;
the online platform is the follower and determines the sales price and the quality of infor-
mation disclosure. By using backward induction, we can first determine the second-order
partial derivatives of the platform’s profit with respect to p and α, and the corresponding
Hessian matrix is as follows: H =
 ∂2 ∏O

∂p∂α

. Because the Hessian
matrix is a negative definite matrix, ∏O is a strictly concave function of α and p. By solving
∂ ∏O
∂p = 0, ∂ ∏O
∂α = 0, we can obtain the optimal strategies p(w) and α(w). Substituting p(w) and
α(w) into the provider’s profit function and determining the second derivative with respect to
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 9 of 21
w, then we can obtain ∂2 ∏T
∂2w = −2k
2k−λ2 < 0 and find that ∏T is concave in w. Then, we can get
the optimal wholesale price w of the provider through solving ∂ ∏T
∂w = 0. By substituting w
into Formulas (16) and (17), we can obtain the optimal equilibrium results. �
From Proposition 3, in the decentralized scenario, if the online tourism platform adopts
blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the optimal decision of
the online tourism platform is related to the cost of information disclosure and the proportion
of information-sensitive consumers. However, the tour operator does not consider these
factors when making decisions and only considers the unit costs of both parties.

Corollary 2 indicates that the quality of tourism product information disclosure,
product sales prices, market demand, tourism operator profit, and online tourism platform
profit are all positively correlated with the proportion of information-sensitive consumers
and negatively correlated with the cost coefficient of information disclosure. It shows
that as the proportion of information-sensitive consumers increases, the introduction of
blockchain technology to improve information disclosure quality on online platforms will
increase product demand, tourism operators will increase sales prices, and ultimately, the
profits of supply chain members will increase. On the contrary, when the information
disclosure cost coefficient increases, the online tourism platform will reduce the quality of
information disclosure, the market demand will decrease, and the profits of supply chain
members will also decrease.

From (1) in Corollary 3, we know that when the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers in the market is lower than a certain threshold, the online travel platform will
not adopt blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure. Only
when the proportion of information-sensitive consumers is large enough is it beneficial for
the online platform to adopt blockchain technology. This is because when the proportion
of consumers who are sensitive to the quality of the information in the market is large,
the improvement of the quality of information disclosure will stimulate consumers to
generate more consumer demand, making the profit increase greater than the cost of
information disclosure. It can be seen from (2) that regardless of whether the online tourism
platform adopts blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the
wholesale price remains unchanged because the wholesale price is only related to the unit
cost of the tour operator and online travel platform. The adoption of blockchain technology
to improve the quality of information disclosure has increased the market demand for
travel products, and online travel platforms will increase the sales prices of the product.
The decision of the online travel platform to adopt blockchain technology to improve
the quality of information disclosure is always beneficial to tour operators because it will
increase the market demand and thus increase the profit of tour operators. Here, (3) notes
that only when the proportion of consumers who are sensitive to information quality is
higher than the threshold will the decision to adopt blockchain technology to improve the
quality of information disclosure increase the overall revenue of the supply chain.
5.2. Centralized Scenario (BC)
In the centralized scenario, if the online platform adopts blockchain technology to
improve the quality of information disclosure, the total profit of the supply chain can be
expressed as:
∏ = (p− cT − cO)(1− p + λα)− k
2
α2 − F (25)
In this case, the tour operator and online travel platform as a whole, with the goal of
maximizing overall profit, jointly determine the quality of product information disclosure
and sales price p.
Proposition 4. In the centralized scenario, if the online tourism platform adopts blockchain
technology to disclose information, the equilibrium results, including sales price pBC,
market demand DBC and supply chain total profit ΠBC , are:
pBC =

k− λ2)(cT + cO)

k(1− cT − cO)
2
4k− 2λ2 − F (29)
Proof of Proposition 4. In the centralized scenario, if the online platform adopts blockchain
technology, the tour operator and the online platform jointly determine the sales price
and the quality of information disclosure. We can first calculate the second-order partial
derivatives of the supply chain total profit with respect to p and α, and the corresponding
Hessian matrix is as follows: H =
 ∂2 ∏
∂p2
∂2 ∏
∂p∂α
∂2 ∏
∂α∂p
∂2 ∏

 =

. Because the Hessian matrix
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 11 of 21
is a negative definite matrix, ∏ is a strictly concave function of α and p. By solving ∂ ∏
∂p = 0,
∂ ∏
∂α = 0, we can obtain the optimal strategies p and α. By substituting p and α into the
supply chain total profit function, then we can obtain the optimal equilibrium results. �
Note that in Proposition 4, in the centralized scenario, when the tour operator and online
platform as a whole adopt blockchain technology, the optimal decisions are also related to the
cost of information disclosure and the proportion of information-sensitive consumers.
Corollary 4. If the online platform adopts blockchain technology to improve the quality of
information disclosure, we have
(1) αBC > αBN , DBC > DBN , ∏BC > ∏BN ;
(2) When λ2 > k, then pBC > pBN , else pBC ≤ pBN .
Proof of Corollary 4. By comparing Equations (18) and (27), (19) and (26), (21) and
(28), and (24) and (29), respectively, then we can obtain: αBC − αBN = λ(1−cT−cO)
4k−2λ2 > 0,
pBC − pBN =
(λ2−k)(1−cO−cT)
4k−2λ2 , DBC − DBN = k(1−cT−cO)
4k−2λ2 > 0, and
∏BC −∏BN = k(1−cT−cO)2
16k−8λ2 > 0. When λ2 > k, we have pBC > pBN , or else pBC ≤ pBN . �
From Corollary 4, it can be seen that the quality of information disclosure, market
demand, and the total profit of supply chain members in the centralized scenario are greater
than those under the decentralized scenario. When the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers is large enough, the sales price in the centralized scenario is higher than in
the decentralized scenario. The increase in revenue shows that through cooperation, both
parties can achieve Pareto improvement. This is because in the decentralized scenario,
both parties only consider their own profits when making decisions, and there is a double
marginal effect, which results in the overall revenue of the tourism O2O supply chain being
less than in the centralized scenario. Therefore, to avoid the double marginal effect between
upstream and downstream members of the tourism O2O supply chain, both parties can
cooperate to increase their own profits.

(1) in Corollary 5 indicates that in the centralized scenario, when the proportion of
information-sensitive consumers is larger than a certain threshold, adopting blockchain
technology is beneficial to the supply chain. From (2) in Corollary 5, we know that in
the centralized scenario, the possibility of the online travel platform adopting blockchain
technology to disclose tourism product information is greater than in the decentralized
scenario. This is because, in the centralized scenario, the online travel platform decides
whether to disclose information to maximize the overall performance of the supply chain
rather than just from the perspective of its own benefits.

6. Two-Part Tariff Contract for the Tourism O2O Supply Chain Coordination
According to the above analysis, we can find that when the tourism O2O supply
chain members adopt wholesale price contracts and the decentralized decision-making
condition, the two parties only consider their revenues, which will create a double marginal
effect, resulting in a decrease in the overall efficiency of the supply chain. According to
existing research, the two-part tariff contract is intended to distribute profits based on
maximizing overall profits, which can increase the benefits of all parties and achieve a win-
win situation [29]. Next, we adopt a two-part tariff contract to coordinate the supply chain.
The specific form of the contract is shown as (w, M). The tour operator first determines the
wholesale price w and the fixed payment M charged to the online tourism platform. On
this basis, the online tourism platform determines the product sales price p and the quality
of information disclosure aimed at maximizing its profit.
6.1. Without Adopting Blockchain Technology (WT)
Under the two-part tariff contract, if the online tourism platform does not adopt
blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the profits of the
online tourism platform, tour operator, and supply chain can be expressed as follows:
∏O = (p− w− cO)(1− p)−M (30)
∏T = (w− cT)(1− p) + M (31)
∏ = (p− cT − cO)(1− p) (32)
Proposition 5. Under the two-part tariff contract, if the online tourism platform does not
adopt blockchain technology to disclose information, the equilibrium results, including
wholesale price wWT, sales price pWT, market demand DWT, online tourism platform profit

Proof of Proposition 5. Under the two-part tariff contract, if the online platform does not
adopt blockchain technology, the tour operator as the leader determines the wholesale
price, then the online platform determines the sales price, and finally, the online platform
pays the fixed fee to the operator. By using backward induction, we can first determine
the second-order derivative of the platform’s profit with respect to p: ∂2 ∏O
∂2 p = −2 < 0.
Then, we can find ∏O is concave in p. Then the optimal sales price p(w, M) can be obtained
according to ∂ ∏O
∂p = 0. By substituting p(w, M) into the supply chain total profit function
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 13 of 21
∏ and determining the second-order derivative with respect to w, then we can obtain
∂2 ∏
∂2w = − 1
2 < 0 and find that ∏ is also concave in w. Then we can get the optimal wholesale
price w of the provider through solving ∂ ∏
∂w = 0. By substituting w into Formulas (30)–(32),
then we can obtain the optimal equilibrium results. �
Note that for Proposition 5, under the coordination of the two-part tariff contract, the
wholesale price of tourism products is equal to its unit production cost. That is to say,
the tour operator aims to maximize the total profit of the supply chain when making the
decision, and the income is the fixed payment collected from the online tourism platform,
equivalent to a certain percentage of the supply chain’s total profit.

From (1) Corollary 6, we can observe that when the online tourism platform does not
adopt blockchain technology, the wholesale price and sales price of the product under the
two-part tariff contract are less than under the wholesale price contract, but the market
demand and the total profit of the supply chain are higher than those under the wholesale
price contract. Because the two-part tariff contracts can effectively avoid the double
marginal effect, the product sales price and wholesale price under the two-part tariff
contract are lower than under the wholesale price contract. The price drop brings about a
substantial increase in demand, which in turn improves the efficiency of the supply chain.
(2) Corollary 6 shows that only when the fixed payment M in the two-part tariff contract
meets a certain condition, in which the online tourism platform and tourism operator under
the two-part tariff contract are higher than those under the wholesale price contract, will
both parties have an incentive to use a two-part tariff contract for coordination.
6.2. With Adopting Blockchain Technology (BT)
Under the two-part tariff contract, if the online tourism platform adopts blockchain
technology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the profits of the online
tourism platform, tour operator, and supply chain can be expressed as:
∏O = (p− w− cO)(1− p + λα)− k
2
α2 − F−M (39)
∏T = (w− cT)(1− p + λα) + M (40)
∏ = (p− cT − cO)(1− p + λα)− k
2
α2 − F (41)
In this case, there is a two-stage dynamic game between the tour operator and online
tourism platform. In the first stage, the tour operator first determines w and M; In the
second stage, the online tourism platform determines the sales price p and the quality of
information disclosure from the perspective of maximizing the overall profit
Proposition 6. Under the two-part tariff contract, if the online tourism platform adopts
blockchain technology to disclose information, the equilibrium results, including wholesale

Proof of Proposition 6. Similar to the proof of Proposition 3. �
Note that in Proposition 6, under the two-part tariff contract, if the online tourism
platform adopts blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure,
the wholesale price of the product will still be equal to the unit production cost of the
tourism product, but the sales price, information disclosure quality, market demand and
the total profit of the supply chain are related to the unit cost of information disclosure
and the proportion of information-sensitive consumers. The respective profits of the online
tourism platform and tour operator still depend on the total profit of the supply chain.
Corollary 7. (1) αBT = αBC > αBN , DBT = DBC > DBN , and ∏BT = ∏BC > ∏BN ;
(2) If λ2 > k, then pBT = pBC > pBN , else pBC = pBT ≤ pBN .
Proof of Corollary 7. (1) By comparing Equations (18), (27) and (44), we can obtain αBT =
αBC > αBN . By comparing Equations (21), (28) and (45), we can obtain DBT = DBC > DBN .
By comparing Equations (24), (29) and (48), we can obtain that ∏BT = ∏BC > ∏BN .
(2) By comparing Equations (19), (26) and (43), we can know that if if λ2 > k, then we
have pBT = pBC > pBN ; else pBC = pBT ≤ pBN . �
From Corollary 7, it follows that when the online tourism platform improves the
quality of information disclosure, the market demand and total profit of supply chain
members under the two-part tariff g contract are greater than under the wholesale price
contract. When the proportion of information-insensitive consumers in the market is
sufficiently large, the sales price under the two-part tariff contract is higher than under
the wholesale price contract. Compared with the ordinary wholesale price contract, the
total profit of the supply chain has increased, indicating that through cooperation, both
parties can achieve Pareto improvement. This is because under the wholesale price contract,
both parties only consider their own profits when making decisions, and there is a double
marginal effect, which leads to the overall revenue of the tourism O2O supply chain being
less than in the centralized decision-making condition. When the two parties use the
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 15 of 21
two-part tariff contract for cooperation, it can effectively avoid double marginal effects
and achieve Pareto improvement. Therefore, to avoid the double marginal effect between
upstream and downstream members of the tourism O2O supply chain, both parties can
adopt the two-part tariff contract for cooperation.

From (1) in Corollary 8, we can observe that when the fixed payment under the two-
part tariff contract is within a certain range, that is, the fixed payment from the online
tourism platform to the tourism operator meets certain conditions, which can make the
profits of the online tourism platform and tour operator not lower than the profits under
the wholesale price contract, then both parties will have the incentive to accept the two-part
tariff for coordination. Subsequently, the online tourism platform and tour operator can
achieve Pareto improvement.
From (2) in Corollary 8, it can be seen that under the two-part tariff contract, when the
proportion of information-sensitive consumers in the market is large enough, the adoption
of blockchain technology is the best choice for the online tourism platform, which can
increase its profit and the overall profit of the supply chain. This is because when the
proportion of information-sensitive consumers is large, it means that more consumers are
sensitive to information quality. The adoption of blockchain technology to improve the
quality of information disclosure by the online tourism platform can improve the utility
of these consumers, thereby encouraging information-sensitive consumers to purchase
tourism products, which can expand the market demand. When the above conditions
are met, the marginal benefit of improving the quality of information disclosure is larger
than the cost, so the profits of the online tourism platform and the whole supply chain can
be improved. Note that (3) in Corollary 8 shows that the online tourism platform under
the two-part tariff contract is more likely to adopt blockchain technology to improve the
quality of information disclosure than under the wholesale price contract. This is because
the online tourism platform and tour operator share different proportions of the total
supply chain revenue through fixed payment M under the two-part tariff contract. This
mechanism can ensure that both parties aim to maximize the overall profit of the supply
chain. Therefore, under a two-part tariff contract, the online tourism platform decides
whether to improve the quality of information disclosure from an overall perspective rather
than just considering its own benefits.

7. Numerical Analysis
In this section, we verify the above results through mathematical simulation and
compare the equilibrium results under different scenarios and the effect of the proportion of
information-sensitive consumers on the results more intuitively. Without loss of generality,
we consider that the values of the parameters are F = 0.05, k = 0.8, cO= 0.01, and cT = 0.01.
Additionally, the proportion of consumers who are sensitive to information changes from
0 to 1. Figure 2 shows the effect of the proportion of information-sensitive consumers on
the sales price in different scenarios. When the online tourism platform adopts blockchain
technology to improve the quality of information disclosure, the sales price of tourism
products under the two-part tariff contract, which is equivalent to that in the centralized
scenario, shows an increasing trend as the proportion of information-sensitive consumers
increases; when the proportion of information-sensitive consumers is small, the sales price
under the two-part tariff contract is lower than under the wholesale price contract. Only
when the proportion of information-sensitive consumers is sufficiently large will the sales
price under the two-part tariff contract be higher than the sales price under the wholesale
price contract. When the online tourism platform does not adopt blockchain technology to
improve the quality of information disclosure, the sales price of tourism products under
the wholesale price contract is always higher than the sales price under the two-part tariff
contract. Besides, we can observe that no matter what kind of contract is implemented,
the sales price after improving the quality of information disclosure is always higher than
without improving the quality of information disclosure. This is because there is always a
certain percentage of consumers in the market who are sensitive to information; as long as
the quality of information disclosure is improved, this part of consumers will be stimulated
to purchase, and market demand will increase. Therefore, online tourism platforms will
increase their product sales prices.

Figure 3. The quality of information disclosure in two types of contracts.
Figure 4 shows the effect of the proportion of information-sensitive consumers on the
market demand in different scenarios. As long as there are information-sensitive consumers
in the market, the market demand with blockchain technology is greater than without
blockchain technology under both contracts. When the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers increases and when the online tourism platform adopts blockchain technology
to improve the quality of information disclosure under the two types of contracts, market
demand will also increase. Additionally, it can be seen that regardless of whether the
online tourism platform introduces blockchain technology, the market demand under the
two-part tariff contract is also always higher than under the wholesale price contract. This
is because the two-part tariff contract can effectively avoid double marginal effects, making
the product sales price lower than under the wholesale price contract, which in turn will
stimulate consumers to purchase; therefore, the market demand in the two-part tariff
is greater.

technology under the two types of contracts will cause the total profit of the supply chain
to be lower than without blockchain technology. This is because when the proportion of
information-sensitive consumers is small, the marginal benefit of improving the quality
of information disclosure is less than the fixed cost of introducing blockchain technology
and the marginal cost of improving the quality of information disclosure. Therefore, only
when the proportion of information-sensitive consumers in the market is large enough will
the adoption of blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure
benefit the whole supply chain. It also can be seen that the intersection of the total profit of
the supply chain while improving the quality of information disclosure and not improving
the quality of information disclosure under the two-part tariff contract is on the left side
of that under the wholesale price contract. This means that the two-part tariff contract is
less dependent on the proportion of information-sensitive consumers than the wholesale

technology to improve the quality of information disclosure under the two-part tariff
contract than the wholesale price contract.

Figures 6 and 7 show the range of the fixed payment M under the two-part tariff
contract. When the online tourism platform does not adopt blockchain technology to
improve the quality of information disclosure, the fixed payment in the two-part tariff
contract should ensure the profit of the online tourism platform and tour operator are not
lower than those under the wholesale price contract. The value range of M is the area
shown by the vertical stripes in Figure 6. As can be seen from the figure, the range of M is
fixed. Figure 7 shows that when the online tourism platform adopts blockchain technology
to improve the quality of information disclosure, the profits of the online tourism platform
and tour operator under the wholesale price contract and the total profits of the supply
chain under the two pricing contracts all increase as the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers increases. The area shown by the vertical stripes in Figure 7 represents the range
of M under the two-part tariff contract. It can be seen that the value and range of M both
increase as the proportion of information-sensitive consumers increases, which means that
as the proportion of information-sensitive consumers increases, the fixed payment that the
tour operator charges online tourism platform will also be dynamically adjusted. This is
because when the proportion of information-sensitive consumers increases, the profit of the
online tourism platform will increase after improving the quality of information disclosure.

The development of blockchain technology provides an opportunity for online tour‐
ism platforms to improve the quality of information disclosure in the tourism O2O supply 
chain. Whether the technology should be used to improve the quality of information dis‐
closure to enhance its competitiveness is a question that online tourism platforms need to 
balance. This paper constructs a tourism O2O supply chain consisting of a tour operator 
and an online tourism platform. We study the optimal pricing strategy and the quality of 
information disclosure of the supply chain under different cooperation situations. After 
that, we obtain the following research conclusions and management implications: 
(1) The initial investment cost of adopting blockchain technology, the cost of infor‐
mation disclosure, and  the proportion of  information‐sensitive consumers have an  im‐
portant influence on the information disclosure decision of the online tourism platform. 
When the information disclosure cost coefficient is large, or the proportion of information‐
sensitive consumers in the market is small, the incremental income generated by the im‐
provement of the information disclosure quality is  less than the  initial investment cost, 
which will cause the net profit of the online tourism platform to decrease. Therefore, the 
online tourism platform should not adopt blockchain technology to improve the quality 
of information disclosure. Only when the cost of information disclosure is small, or the 
proportion of information‐sensitive consumers is large, making the profit when disclosing 
the information greater than when not disclosing, is the introduction of blockchain tech‐
nology to improve the quality of information disclosure beneficial to the online tourism 
platform; 
(2) Improving the quality of information disclosure under the wholesale price con‐
tract  always benefits  the  tour operator. While under  the  two‐part  tariff  contract, only 
when the initial cost of introducing blockchain technology is small can the tour operator 
benefit from improving the quality of information disclosure. Under the wholesale price 
contract, the online tourism platform only considers its own benefit when making deci‐
sions. Only when the marginal benefits of improving the quality of information disclosure 
are higher than the cost of information disclosure will the online tourism platforms choose 
to adopt blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure. In the

8. Conclusions
The development of blockchain technology provides an opportunity for online tourism
platforms to improve the quality of information disclosure in the tourism O2O supply
chain. Whether the technology should be used to improve the quality of information
disclosure to enhance its competitiveness is a question that online tourism platforms need
to balance. This paper constructs a tourism O2O supply chain consisting of a tour operator
and an online tourism platform. We study the optimal pricing strategy and the quality of
information disclosure of the supply chain under different cooperation situations. After
that, we obtain the following research conclusions and management implications:
(1) The initial investment cost of adopting blockchain technology, the cost of informa-
tion disclosure, and the proportion of information-sensitive consumers have an important
influence on the information disclosure decision of the online tourism platform. When the
information disclosure cost coefficient is large, or the proportion of information-sensitive
consumers in the market is small, the incremental income generated by the improvement of
the information disclosure quality is less than the initial investment cost, which will cause
the net profit of the online tourism platform to decrease. Therefore, the online tourism
platform should not adopt blockchain technology to improve the quality of information
disclosure. Only when the cost of information disclosure is small, or the proportion of
information-sensitive consumers is large, making the profit when disclosing the infor-
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2119 20 of 21
mation greater than when not disclosing, is the introduction of blockchain technology to
improve the quality of information disclosure beneficial to the online tourism platform;
(2) Improving the quality of information disclosure under the wholesale price contract
always benefits the tour operator. While under the two-part tariff contract, only when the
initial cost of introducing blockchain technology is small can the tour operator benefit from
improving the quality of information disclosure. Under the wholesale price contract, the
online tourism platform only considers its own benefit when making decisions. Only when
the marginal benefits of improving the quality of information disclosure are higher than the
cost of information disclosure will the online tourism platforms choose to adopt blockchain
technology to improve the quality of information disclosure. In the two-part tariff contract,
when the overall profit of the supply chain from improving the quality of information
disclosure is higher than the cost of information disclosure, the online tourism platform will
choose to introduce blockchain technology to improve the quality of information disclosure.
Therefore, to encourage the online tourism platform to improve the quality of information
disclosure, the tour operator can adjust the method of cooperation with the online tourism
platform, changing from the traditional wholesale price contract to the two-part tariff
contract. Under the two-part tariff contract, the online tourism platform is more likely to
improve the quality of information disclosure compared with wholesale price contracts,
and both parties can achieve Pareto improvement and achieve a win-win situation;
(3) The fixed payment in the two-part tariff contract has an important influence on
the decisions of the online tourism platform and the tour operator. Only when the profits
of the online tourism platform and the tour operator under the two-part tariff contract
are higher than the wholesale price contract will the two parties accept this coordination
contract. Regardless of whether the online tourism platform chooses to improve the quality
of information disclosure, there is an interval value for the fixed payment, which improves
the profits of both parties in the supply chain. When the online tourism platform chooses to
improve the quality of information disclosure, the fixed payment is related to the proportion
of information-sensitive consumers. If there are more information-sensitive consumers in
the market, the fixed payment in the two-part tariff is also larger. This is because when the
proportion of information-sensitive consumers increases, product sales price and market
demand will increase, so improving the quality of information disclosure can increase
the overall profit of the supply chain. Therefore, the fixed payment in the two-part tariff
contract will also increase.
This paper mainly studies the information disclosure and pricing strategy in a tourism
O2O supply chain. Future research can consider the impact of competition between supply
chains on information disclosure and pricing decisions. Furthermore, for a platform,
multiple tour operators that provide tourism products with the same quality can replace
each other. The distribution problem of product information disclosure level under the
limited resources from the perspective of online tourism platforms needs to be explored.
