Abstract—Crowd intelligence tries to gather, process,
infer, and ascertain massive useful information by utilizing
the intelligence of crowds or distributed computers, which
has great potential in Industrial Internet of Things. A
crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders,
namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors,
or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have
no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad
cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw
data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and
workers requires the remote platform center to serve as
a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we
use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stake-
holders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using
blockchain smart contract on many edge servers (ES) of the
mobile edge computing network, which together function
as a trustless hybrid human–machine crowd-intelligence
platform. As ES are near to workers and publisher, network
congestion can be effectively improved. Further, we proved
the existence of the only one strong Nash equilibrium,
which can maximize the interests of involved ES and
make the ecosystem bigger. Theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the proposed method, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
CROWD-INTELLIGENCE is to gather, process, infer, and
ascertain massive useful information by utilizing the intel-
ligence of crowds or computers, whereby a publisher broadcasts
massive tasks to lots of semi skilled workers to obtain reliable
answers [1]. It is widely used in knowledge collecting (e.g.,

mobile crowdsensing [2]), decision making (e.g., tagging of
machine learning training dataset [3]), etc. Industrial Internet
of Things (IIoT) has the properties of high distribution, high-
frequency activity, and is near to massive mobile users, which
makes itself a great potential for crowd intelligence [4], [5]. The
number of tasks to be completed is too large to complete on time
for limited number of professionals, or the tasks are too difficult
to be autoprocessed well just by computer programs [3], [6],
[7]. A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakehold-
ers, namely platform, workers, and publisher that can publish
tasks to workers.
These three stakeholders may have no mutual trust and their
interests conflict with each other [6], [8], [9]. For example,
workers try to get more payment from the publisher with low-
quality works. It is not easy to align incentives of stakeholders
so that they may collaborate smoothly. This harms the long-term
development of the whole crowd-intelligence ecosystem, e.g.,
answers of low quality, unnecessary high cost paid by publisher
to workers, delayed completion of the tasks (i.e., exceeding the
time constraint set by the publisher), and weakening platform
(i.e., loss of professional workers and poorly prespared workers
flooding into it). Due to the lack of mutual trust among stake-
holders, the raw data for a task (e.g., pictures or video clips
that are published by the publisher or submitted by workers
[2], [3], [10]) cannot be transferred directly between publisher
and workers. The remote cloud center (RC) of the centralized
crowd-intelligence platform must serve as the third-party guar-
antee and the intermediary node of the data transferring net-
work path. As raw data transferring plays a great role in a
normal crowd-intelligence ecosystem, trust problem may re-
sult in excess bandwidth and delayed response [11]–[13]. This
needs to be avoided in time critical use cases, e.g., automobile
navigation [10], [14], [15] or disaster recovery [16]. Finally, a
crowd-intelligence ecosystem is short of the available workers
to complete growing number and variety of tasks and this leads
to low quality of final answers and delayed completion of the
complete tasks.
We solve the above-mentioned problems from the following
three aspects, and build them into an integrated method named
blockchain-enabled trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem op-
erated on mobile edge computing network (Fig. 1, note that
RC is not obligatory in general. But without RC, the proposed
decentralized crowd-intelligence network still works.).

Fig. 1. Proposed blockchain-enabled trustless crowd-intelligence
ecosystem. It is decentralized and implements a blockchain smart con-
tract and operates on edge servers/blockchain masternodes (ES/MNs)
of a mobile edge computing network. Both human beings and machines
can serve as workers or publishers, and and it can be called a hybrid
human–machine crowd-intelligence ecosystem.
1) Incentive problem: An incentive-compatible and efficient
incentive model is particularly important for a decentralized sys-
tem. We build a reward-penalty model to align incentives of the
three stakeholders. We reward or punish workers according to
the quality of their committed answers instead of only positive
payment [10], [17]. We develop a family of appropriate reward-
penalty function couples, by which the amounts of reward and
penalty can be computed based on the workers’ committing be-
liefs without destroying the incentive compatibility property of
the ecosystem. Different from a single reward-penalty function
couple or rewarding only, this model provides a more flexible
solution to manage the interests of three stakeholders, and help
to reduce latency, improve quality, and do good to platform
evolution of the crowd-intelligence ecosystem [10], [17].
2) Trust problem: A worker’s performance history determines
the amounts of her reward/penalty in completing tasks. And
the predefined management rules/cooperation standards define
how the platform works. It is of important to avoid malicious
activity or tampering from the bad minorities, and win the trust
of stakeholders. We propose to treat it with blockchain smart
contract. The smart contract is copied to multiple edge servers
(ES) of mobile edge computing and executed. The proposed
crowd-intelligence platform is decentralized using blockchain
technology and is not hosted on a centralized RC. The ESs are
owned by many individuals and behave as blockchain mastern-
odes (MNs) [18]. Without the agreement of more than a half
MNs, the smart contract cannot be changed arbitrarily [19]. The
stakeholders can collaborate without trusting each other. Specif-
ically, the raw data transferring between publisher and workers
can proceed with the nearest ES/MNs serving as intermediary
nodes, which can avoid excess bandwidth and delayed response.
The ES/MNs charge a small fees from the publisher and work-
ers to keep the security state of the blockchain, and earn money
from it [18], [19]. With the help of blockchain smart contract,
the involved ESs can maximize profits with strong Nash equi-
librium [20] and the proposed ecosystem can attract more ESs
to serve as blockchain MNs.
3) Worker shortage problem: When the trust problem is
solved, a trustless hybrid human–machine crowd-intelligence
platform can be built, where both of human beings and machines
(including sensors or processors) are able to serve as workers
or publishers without mutual trust. Specifically, human workers
perform well in highly complex tasks (i.e., crowdsourcing [21]),
while machine workers can do better in realtime high-frequency
tasks (i.e., crowdsensing [10]). This platform can also help to
solve the worker shortage problem.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We introduce
how to align the interests of three involved stakeholders using the
reward and penalty model in Section II. Section III shows how to
build a trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem using blockchain
smart contract on a mobile edge computing network. In
Section IV, we introduce the hybrid human–machine concept to
relieve the worker shortage problem. In Section V, experiments
on two synthetic datasets are conducted to validate the proposed
crowd-intelligence ecosystem, and the results are supplements
to the proof and analysis in the previous sections. Section VI
presents the existing related works. And Section VII draws con-
clusions and discusses our future work.
II. REWARD-PENALTY MODEL
An incentive-compatible and efficient incentive model is par-
ticularly important for a decentralized system. Not like the tra-
ditional centralized crowd-intelligence system, the proposed de-
centralized version has no an arbitral authority to settle the dis-
putes among different stakeholders. If the system is incentive-
compatible, every stakeholder can achieve the best outcome
to themselves just by behaving according to predefined rules,
which helps to avoid disputes. If the proposed decentralized
crowd-intelligence system is efficient, it will have more advan-
tages over the existing centralized competitors. As a result, a
good incentive model that can achieving the above targets is
needed.
The proposed reward-penalty model does not estimate a
worker’s proficiency or her reliability on each commit. Instead,
it assumes that each worker knows her reliability on a specific
task, and its target is to incentive workers to commit the truth.
If a worker is assigned a task, she is asked to commit both of
task’s type information (i.e., the answer she selected from the
candidates) and belief value (i.e., her confidence that measures
the probability that her selection will be judged right). Only
binary-type task is taken into account here, such that the num-
ber of the task’s candidate answers is uniformly two, like Yes
or No [8], [17], [22]. Belief value is reasonable because that a
worker always intentionally or unintentionally estimates in her
own mind the probability of giving the right answer when she
is encountered with a decision-making task due to tasks’ inher-
ent difficulty, different individual experience, and professional
knowledge [23], [24].
Some symbols and denotations are as follows. The number
of tasks is denoted by T , and there are a total of N workers to
complete these tasks. The index of a task is denoted by an integer
1 ≤ t ≤ T , and a worker is indexed using an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ N .
The binary-type space of tasks is denoted as {−1,+1}. We use
st to denote the worker set that completed task t. When worker
n completes task t, we use an,t to represent her committing type

for this task. The belief value is in range [0.5, 1], which means
that the committed type is more suitable than the other one. x
denotes the committed belief value x, and the real probability
that her committed type is judged right is denoted by c. When a
worker’s committing type is finally judged correct, her reward
amount is denoted by the reward function of variable x, i.e.,
reward(x) > 0, and penalty(x) > 0 is the penalty function if
her committing type is judged as wrong.
The workflow of reward-penalty model is shown in Fig. 2, and
it contains three modules, namely judgment, final generation,
and reward-penalty.
A. Judgment Module
Judgment module uses benchmark answer to judge whether a
work for a task deserves reward or penalty for a task completion.
The benchmark answer for task t is defined by the following:
ât = sgn
(
∑
n∈st
an,t
)
(1)
where sgn(x) = −1 if x < 0, and 1 otherwise.
Note that benchmark answer ât will not be sent to the pub-
lisher as the final answer of a task. It is just used to judge
whether or not worker n is due for a reward or penalty for her
an,t . Specifically, if an,t equals to ât , the worker will receive a
reward from the publisher, otherwise she will need to pay to the
publisher as a penalty.
B. Reward-Penalty Module
This module computes the how much reward (reward(x))
or penalty (penalty(x)) should be given. In statistical terms,
the type committed by a worker will be judged correct with
probability of c, and occurrence probability of a wrong judgment
is the rest 1 − c. Therefore, the expected gain payment is defined
as
expected(x) = c · reward(x) − (1 − c) · penalty(x). (2)
Due to different individual experiences and professional knowl-
edge, value c given by different workers may be different. More-
over, a specific worker’s c for different tasks changes according
to their respective inherent difficulty.
Then the model is formulated by the following:
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩
argmaxx expected(x) = c
〈reward, penalty〉 ≥ 0, 〈 ∂ reward
∂x , ∂penalty
∂x 〉 > 0
reward(0.5) = penalty(0.5) = 0, reward(1) = 1
0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1
(3)
of which the first means that a worker must commit c to maxi-
mize her expected gain, i.e., a worker can get the largest expected
gain payment just only if she chooses to commit the truth [25],
[26]; the second means that the reward and penalty have a posi-
tive correlation with x, a larger belief value of its corresponding
committing type has a larger influence on the benchmark and
final answer of the task, and it may be beneficial or harmful
[23], [24]; the third means the boundary values; and the fourth
means the definitional domain. A fixed boundary value is to
ensure easy solvability of reward-penalty functions [27]. As a
commit with x = 0.5 cannot offer any useful information, no
stakeholder will gain or lose for it.
By solving this model, we successfully find a family of
reward-penalty functions by the following:
⎧
⎨
⎩
rewardk (x) = −(k−1)2k xk +2k kxk −1−(k+1)
2k −k−1
penaltyk (x) = (k−1)2k xk −(k−1)
2k −k−1
(4)
where k ≥ 2 can be considered as the order of a reward-penalty
function couple and personal order value of the corresponding
worker. Then, we can obtain the expected gain function with
kth order by plugging (4) into (2):
expectedk (c) =
2k ck − 2 ck + k − 1
2k − k − 1
. (5)
C. Final Generation Module
This module generates the final answer as the final result of
the corresponding task, which is what the publisher wants. The
final answer a∗
t for task t can be generated by the following:
a∗
t = sgn
(
∑
n∈st
expectedn,tan,t
)
. (6)
Compared to benchmark answer in (1), final answer in (6) is
more like the weighted majority rule or weighting aggregation
rule that are widely used in crowdsourcing [28]. It can generate
the true answer even if majority workers’ committing types are
not right. As a larger belief value means its corresponding type
is more reliable than a smaller one, it is reasonable to consider
workers’ belief value into computing the final answer.
The expected payment expectedn,t is suitable for the weight
coefficient of committing type as follows:
1) It has monotonicity property in 0.5 ≤ c ≤ 1 for any k ≥
2, which guarantees a larger influence of a committing
type if it has a higher belief value.
2) It is a better fit than either one of them in measuring the
reliability of a committing type.
3) It has more distinguishing ability in comparison to belief
value c.

4) The more the publisher pays, the better quality she gains,
which helps to make the most of publisher’s money.
The reward-penalty model is incentive compatible and effi-
cient, which helps to align stakeholders’ interests, latency, and
quality control as follows:
1) The publisher needs to pay only for good committing
answers, and can get some compensation from the penalty
for bad commits.
2) It is easy to design personal order value into a nega-
tive function of a worker’s performance history. Then, a
professional worker can gain more than a badly behaved
worker if they commit the same for a task. This way
model can attract more good workers to the platform.
3) When a worker feels that the assigned task is very hard,
she can commit with a tiny belief value (i.e., approximat-
ing to 0.5) for a tiny gain, by which difficult tasks will
not be left behind and undue latency would not occur.
The reward-penalty model needs blockchain technology as
follows.
1) Workers and publishers are the comparatively weak side
against the centralized platform. The proposed reward-
penalty model entitles workers and publishers to exert
influence on all of the three involved stakeholders. This
is consistent with the decentralization idea of blockchain
and mobile edge computing.
2) As the reward-penalty model requires workers to deposit
in advance a certain amount of fund to the platform as the
possible the source of penalty, the platform may misuse
workers’ money without proper supervision, which is not
workers do not want.
Blockchain technology can help to avoid diversion of
fund by decentralizing fund management.
In the following, we will introduce how a crowd-intelligence
ecosystem can benefit from blockchain and mobile edge
computing.
III. TRUSTLESS CROWD-INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM ON
MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING
A. Trustless Platform Enabled by Blockchain Smart
Contract and Mobile Edge Computing
The trust problem of a crowd-intelligence ecosystem results
from the following two ways:
1) High centralization: The reward-penalty model in
Section II relies too heavily on the crowd-intelligence plat-
form in aligning incentives of stakeholders. A worker’s
reward/penalty amounts for task completion is closely related
to her performance history (i.e., order k in (4)). In addition, the
predefined management rules of the platform and the collabora-
tion standards of stakeholders define how the ecosystem works.
All of these information and rules are controlled by and stored
in a highly centralized crowd-intelligence platform (a RC) [2],
[10], which poses the following risks: the platform itself has
the right to tamper them, and natural disaster may damage them
easily [16]. Without solving the risks brought by the centralized
platform, the crowd-intelligence ecosystem cannot win the trust
of other stakeholders.
2) Competing interest: Interest conflict of stakeholders leads
to lack of mutual trust [6], [8], [9]. So data for a crowd-
intelligence task cannot be transferred directly between pub-
lisher and workers. A less-than-ideal alternative is to invite RC
of the centralized crowd-intelligence platform to serve as the
third-party guarantee and the intermediary node of the data
transferring network path. This increases the bandwidth over-
burden and response time [11]–[13], as raw data transferring
plays a great role in a normal IIoT or crowd-intelligence ecosys-
tem, where pictures or video clips are published by the publisher
or submitted by workers [2], [3], [10], [16].
We propose to use blockchain smart contract to implement
the reward-penalty model, workers’ performance history data,
and the predefined management rules of the platform and the
collaboration standards, which can reduce the risks due to a
centralized platform; we propose to use many ES of mobile edge
computing as blockchain MNs to host and run the smart contract,
which can relieve network congestion. We present details in two
steps as follows:
1) New activities among stakeholders will be recorded and
packed into a newly created data block at set intervals.
A new block has a pointer to the unique hash code of
its previous block, and all blocks form a chain, which
is called blockchain. It is scarcely possible to tamper
or damage a blockchain. As a result, if some informa-
tion has been stored on blockchain, everyone can trust it
[29]. Blockchain smart contract is a piece of computer
program that is owned by all blockchain nodes, and it
cannot be changed arbitrarily without the consensus of
majority of nodes [19]. What we should implement using
blockchain smart contract includes the reward-penalty
model, workers’ performance history data, the predefined
management rules of the platform, and the collaboration
standards of stakeholders. When the presupposed condi-
tion is met, the agreed steps will proceed automatically.
In this way, a centralized crowd-intelligence ecosystem
is transformed into a decentralized one that is operated
on a blockchain network, and it can have the trust of all
stakeholders.
2) The blockchain’s consensus algorithm is designed to rely
on a certain range of memory and bandwidth, which limits
the corresponding mining hardware on ES or some other
computing devices at edge network like that [19], [30].
This design can make the ecosystem distribute wider, and
fit into mobile edge computing. These hardwares store an
exact replica of the blockchain, and we can call them
MNs. To relieve bandwidth overburden and response de-
lay, the nearest ES/MN is able to replace a RC to serve
as an intermediary node and third-party guarantee dur-
ing a raw data transfer between a worker and publisher.
As most of workers and publishers have limited hard-
ware resources (e.g., mobile phones and sensors), they
need only be a node of simplified payment verification
(SPV node),1 and do not have to host a full replica of the
blockchain like ES/MNs. In addition, as an ES/MN can

tem on mobile edge computing network.
be in close proximity to workers/publishers than the RC,
it can help them preprocess the task data at edge network
(e.g., videos clips or images). This can further relieve
network congestion, and increase the system’s ability to
respond to massive tasks [16], [31]. The relationship of
ES/MN node and SPV node is shown in Fig. 3.
The reasons that the proposed blockchain is deployed on ES
are as follows:
1) An ES/MN should have enough storage resource to host
the block data of the blockchain. In addition, it should
have enough computation resource (e.g., CPU, GPU)
to provide services to workers and publishers. What is
more, as ES/MNs need to communicate with each other,
network bandwidth is also needed. The demand of stor-
age/computation/network resources decides that ES/MN
should be at least a small datacenter.
2) For an ES/MN, to save cost and enhance its competitive-
ness against other ES/MNs, it should be near to workers
or potential worker. That is to say, ES/MNs should be
deployed near to people. As a result, the ideal place for
the proposed system is ES.
B. Incentives for Collaboration Between ES/MNs
The set of ES/MNs play a key role in the proposed trustless
ecosystem. Many ES/MNs together function as a decentralized
crowd-intelligence platform, and regulate and guide the behav-
iors of involved stakeholders. Beyond that, with the help of
blockchain smart contract, the other stakeholders can trust the
platform and collaborate with each other, and the network con-
gestion resulted by transferring data among stakeholders can be
relieved. What is more, if the number of ES/MNs increases, all
stakeholders in the ecosystem can benefit more. Specifically the
following confditions hold:
1) As ES/MN network covers more and more geographical
areas, more workers/publishers will be able to access the
crowd-intelligence services through the ES/MNs around
them, especially the people in remote rural areas with
poor and expensive network service.
2) As the deployment density of ES/MNs in one region
grows, workers/publishers will have more choices for
data preprocessing and intermediary nodes for transfer-
ring data.

PAYOFF MATRIX FOR TWO ESS IN A TRADITIONAL CROWD-INTELLIGENCE
ECOSYSTEM WITHOUT BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACT
3) A large ES/MN network can generate a fully competitive
market environment, which can reduce the maintenance
cost of the crowd-intelligence ecosystem.
We now show why the proposed trustless crowd-intelligence
ecosystem can attract more ES to serve as MN in it, and how
the involved ES/MNs can maximize their profits with the help
of blockchain smart contract [20]. As is shown in Fig. 1, an ES
at edge network can be considered as a very small cloud with
limited resources (e.g., CPU, memory, bandwidth), while the
RC at the core network will not encounter resource shortage
problem [31]. If too many mobile workers gather around an
ES/MN at some point, the resources of the ES will not meet the
demands of these workers and the corresponding ES must buy
resources from nearby ESs or the RC [32], [33]. In this process,
two kinds of trust problems arise: 1) no mutual trust between
two ESs can ensure a resource trading, unless they find a RC
as the third-party guarantee [31], [34]; 2) ESs are not willing to
trust the RC as the RC can provide its own resources to ESs. If
the RC has dominated the resource market, it will leverage its
status of the intermediary to squeeze ESs out.
The following section expresses our views: First, we intro-
duce the prisoner’s dilemma without blockchain smart contract
on a traditional crowd-intelligence platform, which is why it can
not attract more ESs and make the ecosystem grow bigger [31],
[34]. We suppose all ESs are rational economic man, and the
game is played as follows: if both of two ESs #A and #B choose
to leave the ecosystem and trade resources with the RC, they
will gain a and b, respectively; if they choose to join and trade
with each other, the transferring distance of the traded resources
between two neighboring ESs is much less than that between
ESs and the RC. As a result, both of ESs #A and #B can gain
more than before; if one choose to join while the other choose
to leave, the former must give more profit to the latter to keep it
inside the ecosystem. The payoff matrix of this game is shown in
Table I. The dominant strategy for both involved ESs is to leave
the ecosystem, which is the only strong Nash equilibrium. How-
ever, both of them gain the least (i.e., a and b). So a traditional
crowd-intelligence platform is absolutely a prisoner’s dilemma
for ESs. ESs of mobile edge computing have no incentives to
join the ecosystem.
We show how we break through the prisoner’s dilemma us-
ing blockchain smart contract, and incentive ESs to join the
ecosystem as MNs. The emphasis is to help ESs in this ecosys-
tem to get rid of the RC, and form an autonomous community.
In the proposed trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem, first all
trading-related information and rules are stored with blockchain

smart contract. During a resource trading, both of the corre-
sponding two ESs must follow these already recognized rules.
So ESs can buy or sell resources with others without mutual
trust or third-party guarantee. Table II shows the payoff ma-
trix for two ESs of the proposed trustless crowd-intelligence
ecosystem. The difference of payoff matrix in Table II from that
in Table I are the payoff values for two ESs’ different choices.
Specifically, the two ESs can trust the blockchain smart con-
tract as a third-party guarantee, and trade resources under the
guidance of the blockchain smart contract without trusting each
other. In this case, the blockchain smart contract helps to match
the most suitable seller/buyer. In return, the blockchain smart
contract platform will charge small fees from two ES/MNs to
keep the blockchain running (i.e., ε1, ε2 in the payoff matrix).
We can see that joining is the dominant strategy for both of the
two involved ESs, which is the only strong Nash equilibrium of
the game. That means the ESs can maximize their profits and
have enough incentives to join the proposed trustless crowd-
intelligence ecosystem to serve as MNs.
The root cause of trading resources between ES/MNs is to re-
duce cost. When two MN/ES cannot match each other, it means
that they cannot reach consensus over the price of resources.
When two ES/MN cannot reach consensus over the price, it
means that the buyer cannot reduce cost by buy resources from
others. Then, it will process the work by itself, and cannot pro-
vide more services before this ES/MN can free more resources.
C. Brokerage From the Publisher to ES/MNs
ES/MNs will not offer services (including collaboration be-
tween ES/MNs) to workers and publishers for free. Someone
should pay for it. In this paper, the publisher should pay broker-
age to its directly connected ES/MNs. The brokerage model is
as follows:
1) The publisher give the brokerage ratio η when she publish
the tasks. If a ES/MN accepts the ratio, it will join in to
provide crowd-intelligence services.
2) When the publisher pays reward r to a worker for
completing as task, it also pays ηr brokerage to all of
ES/MNs that have provide services for completing this
task, and the brokerage is equally distributed between
these ES/MNs.
3) If the worker should pay penalty p back to the publisher
for this task, the ES/MNs associated with this task have
to share ηp penalty.

workers.
For an ES/MN, the money it has received minus the money
it has paid out is its net remuneration. Every ES/MN has full
responsibility for its own profit and loss. The brokerage model
has no impact on the incentive compatibility of the reward-
penalty model. So as long as the workers have positive overall
expected gain, the ES/MN will have positive net remuneration.
There is need to build a completely new blockchain for this
paper. A complete new blockchain that can fit crowd intelli-
gence is the best. With the tailor-made transaction structure and
smartcontract, the system would be simple and easy to use.
However, a complete new blockchain is not needed. The core
use of Blockchain in this paper is to provide trust by store
some information into blockchain. As a result, we can build
an application layer on one of the existing blockchain plat-
form (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethernum), which stores information into
the third-party blockchain, and uses this information to provide
crowd-intelligence service.
IV. HYBRID HUMAN–MACHINE WORKERS
A crowd-intelligence platform needs to attract machines like
sensors and processors in addition to human beings as its work-
ers, and develop itself into a hybrid human–machine ecosystem
as follows:
1) Integrating advantages both of human beings and ma-
chines. Specifically, the crowd-intelligence platform can
assign human workers more highly complex crowdsourc-
ing tasks, e.g., labeling of training dataset in machine
learning [3], [21]; and assign machine workers more re-
altime frequent crowdsensing tasks, e.g., mobile crowd-
sensing in IIoT [4] and automobile navigation [10]). The
proposed platform is able to cover both crowdsourcing
and crowdsensing.
2) Relieving the worker shortage problem and reducing ex-
cessive latency of the whole tasks. As more workers can
complete more tasks within the same time period, exces-
sive latency of the whole tasks is hard to occur if only
human workers are used.
The hybrid human–machine crowd intelligence is shown in
Fig. 4.
The enabling technology of the proposed hybrid human–
machine crowd-intelligence platform is blockchain smart con-
tract. The blockchain smart contract is responsible to guide and
monitor the behaviors of workers, and prevent frauds among

them. So from a management perspective of the decentralized
crowd-intelligence platform, human beings and machines are
just indiscriminate workers represented by SPV nodes. All kinds
of computing devices, especially AI devices like inhome routers,
monitoring camera, and mobile phones at edge network can
work as machine workers. With the blockchain smart contract,
these machine workers can use the earnings to pay for their
continued existence, e.g., hardware resources, access to more
useful information, and software improvements in their whole
life cycle without human intervention.
V. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental Settings
We use BeTrustMEC to represent the proposed blockchain-
enabled trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem. There are two
baselines, namely Major-CI and ReNalty-CI as follows:
1) Major-CI: It is widely used in current crowdsourcing
platforms like MTurk2 and FigureEight,3 where the type
selected by the largest number of workers is determined
as the final answer. Major-CI is totally centralized in that
data transferring between a publisher and workers must
go through the remote platform center on an RC.
2) ReNalty-CI: The only difference of ReNalty-CI from
Major-CI is that it uses the reward-penalty model to align
incentives of stakeholders and obtain the final answer.
ReNalty-CI gives publishers and workers more rights to
influence the ecosystem. Like Major-CI, publishers and
workers of ReNalty-CI have no mutual trust.
As no specific off-the-shelf dataset exists, we choose to gen-
erate two pieces of synthesized datasets to validate the proposed
ecosystem. Fig. 5(a) shows the spatial distribution of 3234 cel-
lular base stations in Shanghai, China. The cellular distribution
is unbalanced and is consistent with the distribution of crowd-
intelligence tasks. In experiments of two baselines, the RC is
located at the same location, where the cellular base station dis-
tribution has the highest density in Fig. 5(a). Another dataset
is as shown in Fig. 5(b), which shows the distribution of 967
cellular base stations in Beijing, China.
Based on the base station distribution data, the three stake-
holders (i.e., publisher, worker, and ES/MN) and crowdsourcing
tasks for the proposed BeTrustMEC are generated according to
the following ways:
1) We normalize the distances between two base stations
to range (0, 1], and consider the normalized distances
as the corresponding network latency between the two
locations.
2) Five base stations are randomly selected as publishers,
and each has 2000 tasks to publish.
3) Hundred workers are selected from remaining base sta-
tions to complete these tasks.
4) Twenty ES/MNs are randomly selected from the rest base
stations.

Fig. 5. Spatial distribution heatmap of cellular base stations. (a) Shang-
hai city of China. (b) Beijing city of China.
In the simulation of BeTrustMEC, when a worker receives
data from or submits data to a publisher, they will choose the
ES/MN with least sum of distances to them to transfer the data
without trust. In this way, a decentralized crowd-intelligence
ecosystem that covers the whole city is constructed.
Different from the proposed BeTrustMEC, baselines Major-
CI and ReNalty-CI are essentially traditional centralized crowd-
sourcing systems, which have only one remote crowdsourcing
platform on an RC instead of decentralized ES/MNs. The loca-
tion of the remote platform is determined each time according
to the following ways:
1) We compute the sum distance of each base station to the
rest base stations, and select the least 20 of them as the
set of candidate platform locations. This is quite different
from site selection in practical cloud computing industry,
where a data center is always located far from downtown
due to operating costs [35]. We make this change here
to make the baselines to generate the best performance,
especially in latency time of completing the whole tasks,
which in turn validates the effectiveness of the proposed
BeTrustMEC in the subsequent experimental results.
2) We select one from the set of candidate platform locations
as the location of the platform each time. This step adds
uncertainty to the location selection, which is just like the
selection of the set of ES/MNs for BeTrustMEC.
Now we introduce the way to generate crowd-intelligence
tasks and commits of workers. A task is generated as follows:
1) the real type value y0 of a task takes +1/−1 at the same
probability; 2) the real belief value c0 of the tasks is uniformly
distributed in range (0.5, 1]. A worker is supposed to have a bias
value b ∈ [−0.5, 0.5] toward c0, and her commit for a task with
c0 is generated as follows:

Performance on latency time of the whole tasks. (b) Performance on
accuracy of the final answers.
1) If c0 + b < 0.5, she commits the wrong type with belief
value 1 − c0 − b.
2) If c0 + b > 1, she commits the right type with belief value
1.
3) Else, she commits the right type with belief value c0 + b.
In addition, a worker cannot process two tasks at a time and a
task cannot be processed more than once by one worker. When
a task obtains three commits, its benchmark and final answers
are generated and this task is considered complete.
B. Experimental Results
Fig. 6 shows curves of the expected gain payment that workers
gain with different belief values of commits. As both of ReNalty
and the proposed BeTrustMEC use the reward-penalty model,
they are represented by the same curves. The parameter k means
workers’ personal order value. Belief value is not needed in
Major-CI. However, it still affects the accuracy of a worker’s
committing answer and her expected gain. A larger committing
belief value can gain more in BeTrustMEC or ReNalty-CI than
Major-CI, while a less committing belief results in the opposite.
As personal order increases, this trend becomes more evident.
So the ReNalty and the proposed BeTrustMEC can attract more
professional workers.
Experimental results on data of Shanghai base stations is
shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) shows that BeTrustMEC performs
much better than Major-CI and ReNalty-CI on latency control,
which means that tasks published by BeTrustMEC can be com-
pleted in much less time. The reason is that BeTrustMEC is
a decentralized ecosystem where workers and publishers can
transfer data using the nearby ES/MNs instead of RC center.
Fig. 8. Experimental results on data of Beijing base stations. (a) Perfor-
mance on latency time of the whole tasks. (b) Performance on accuracy
of the final answers.
What is more, BeTrustMEC has lower variance value than base-
lines, which means its decentralization helps to suppress latency
fluctuation. Fig. 7(b) shows that BeTrustMEC performs better
than Major-CI in accuracy of final answers. ReNalty-CI has
similar accuracy to BeTrustMEC, which is because of the same
reward-penalty model is used. But ReNalty-CI has much worse
variance, which may result from the location uncertainty of the
remote platform.
Experimental results on data of Beijing base stations are
shown in Fig. 8. The results are very similar to that in Fig. 7.
Fig. 8(a) shows that the proposed BeTrust-MEC performs much
better than both of Major-CI and ReNalty-CI on latency control.
While in respect to accuracy of final answers, Fig. 8(b) shows
that BeTrustMEC performs better than Major-CI, and similar to
ReNalty-CI.
As we can see from the experimental results, BeTrustMEC
performs better than the two baselines in general, which to-
gether with the previous theoretical analysis helps to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed BeTrustMEC.
VI. RELATED WORKS
Past works cannot fit the decentralization features of mo-
bile edge computing, and meet the differentiated demands of a
crowd-intelligence ecosystem [1], [3], [8], [10], [17]. For exam-
ple, workers’ reliability must be inferred from workers’ history
records [1], [3], and at the same time much money is wasted for
bad workers and no penalty for their bad affects as compensa-
tion is paid to the task publisher [10], [17]. The reward-penalty
model gives a much more flexible way to manage the interests of
three stakeholders. The incentive system in crowd-intelligence
platform, like the reward-penalty model, is complex enough,
and easy to be tampered by bad minorities, which results in
trust problem.
In this paper, the trust problem among crowd-intelligence
stakeholders is solved by integrating mobile edge computing
and blockchain smart contract together. The past works mainly
focus on how to identify the trustworthiness of workers or their
commits [1], [3], [10], [17], but ignore how to ensure the trust-
worthness of publishers and the crowd-intelligence platform,
which is unfair to the workers. We are the first to discussed the
trust problem among the ES/MNs of the decentralized crowd-
intelligence platform based on blockchain smart contract. Satya-
narayanan et al. [31] mentioned the relationship between ES and

RC, but not studied how ES compete with RC in providing edge
services, and how they can collaborate with each other without
mutual trust.
The past crowdsourcing [21] mainly focuses on dealing with
highly complex tasks (e.g., labeling of training dataset in ma-
chine learning [3]) using human beings workers, while crowd-
sensing mainly deals with real-time frequent tasks using sensors
or other computing devices. As crowdsourcing and crowdsens-
ing use quite different workers, it is not easy to integrate the
two in order to obtain the advantages of both. While by using
blockchain smart contract, the proposed hybrid human–machine
platform can consider human beings and machines as indiscrim-
inate workers, which can expand the applications of crowd intel-
ligence to crowdsourcing and crowdsensing. As human beings
and machine workers can complement each other, the hybrid
human–machine platform can help to reduce excessive latency
of the whole tasks.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a trustless crowd-intelligence ecosystem
based on the common decentralization feature of mobile edge
computing and blockchain technology. Its reward-penalty model
provides a flexible way to align the interests of three stakehold-
ers. It expands the applications of crowd intelligence to crowd-
sourcing and crowdsensing domains. What is more, it can make
use both of human beings and machines as workers to solve
the worker shortage problem. It can offer many data-related so-
lutions to IIoT, and benefit from the IIoT’s infrastructures at
the same time. For future work, we plan to 1) implement the
proposed ecosystem using blockchain technology and deploy
it in a real mobile edge computing network for more test and
promotion; and 2) further make it work within limited total
budget.
