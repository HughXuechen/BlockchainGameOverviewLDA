Abstract
We analyze firms' supply chain transparency and ethical production practices using a
game-theoretic approach. If the rival's supply chain is more likely to be ethical and
the technology used to ensure supply chain transparency is efficient, ethical suppliers
prefer to disclose their supply chain information, whereas unethical suppliers do not.
The supply chain transparency level can be a signal of the supplier's ethical quality
level, as both consumers' demand for ethical production and R&D efficiency for
supply chain transparency increase. Consumers can distinguish ethical suppliers
through their level of supply chain transparency because blockchain technology
improves R&D efficiency.

1 | INTRODUCTION
As contact-free transactions increase with the COVID-19 pandemic
era, supply chain management is becoming more important than
before. Accordingly, interest in efficient and safe supply chain
management has also increased. Supply chain transparency, which
is crucial for the efficient and safe management of the supply
chain, is generally defined as disclosing supply chain information
such as resources, manufacturing processes, and logistics to
other supply chain participants or consumers. Supply chain
transparency is known by different terms, including visibility and
traceability, each with differing explanations. Nonetheless, the key
concept is to gain trust by disclosing information (Montecchi
et al., 2021).
Sharing supply chain information among participants
(i.e., ensuring a transparent supply chain) not only mitigates informa-
tion asymmetry across the supply chain (Cohen & Klepper, 1996;
Fiala, 2005; Lin & Saggi, 2002) but also prevents the risk of working
with fraudulent business partners. In addition, a transparent supply
chain improves the efficiency of responses to problems. Transpar-
ently disclosing process information makes it easy to find the
liability; hence, the spread of damage can be quickly identified and
addressed (Hobbs, 2004). For these reasons, research on supply
chain transparency has mainly been from the perspective of
efficient management, with the aim of finding technologies and
systems that can efficiently implement supply chain transparency
(Kim et al., 2011; Kulkarni, 2000).
Supply chain transparency can also increase consumers' trust in
suppliers. Consumers search for product information before purchas-
ing and make purchase decisions by examining the utility of an item.
Supply chain transparency has traditionally been unrelated to con-
sumers because of the high cost they have paid to find product infor-
mation. However, the development of information technology has
reduced consumers' search costs, meaning that they can now easily
access supply chain information. Hence, supply chain transparency
has a greater impact on consumers than before. The emergence of
ethical consumerism is further reinforcing the tendency of consumers
to be sensitive to supply chain transparency. Ethical consumers
choose against unethical suppliers that unfairly exploit workers or
harm the environment through their manufacturing and logistics
processes (Ahmed & Machold, 2004). Thus, disclosing supply chain
information can raise profits. However, increasing supply chain trans-
parency can also lower a company's sales and damage its reputation,
especially given the recent increase in consumers' ethical standards.
Thus, suppliers may be reluctant to disclose information on their
supply chains (Mishra et al., 1998; Vinning & Weimer, 1988;
Zhang et al., 2014).
Duan and Aloysius (2019) claimed that consumers tend to place
more weight on ethical production processes than on such tradi-
tional product selection criteria as product price and quality. In

other words, no matter how high the product quality is, if it was
produced through an unethical process (e.g., the exploitation of
labor or environmental destruction in the manufacturing and logis-
tics processes), consumer demand may decrease. Thus, we assume
the following two propositions. First, product quality is a broad con-
cept that encompasses consumers' ethical standards. We denote
this quality concept as “ethical quality.” Second, product quality
disclosed according to the supply chain transparency level affects
demand. Under these assumptions, we adopt a simple economic
model to show that supply chain transparency can be a signal of
product quality.
We analyze whether and to what degree companies choose to
improve their supply chain transparency. We describe the situation
in which companies adopt a technology to improve supply chain
transparency using a game-theoretic model. Since a new system
must be introduced to improve supply chain transparency, this
decision problem is similar to analyzing research and development
(R&D) decisions. We therefore analyze firms' supply chain transpar-
ency decisions by referencing an R&D decision model. Our model
extends the R&D game-theoretic model developed by Brander and
Spencer (1983). We combine the concepts of R&D studies and
supply chain transparency studies. We assume that two distinct
firms compete on R&D for supply chain transparency and that
consumers prefer ethical production methods. Modifying the
consumer utility function of Park and Ryu (2022), we derive
stochastic demand based on consumers' preference for an ethical
supply chain. Our model confirms that peach firms raise their
transparency level and lemon firms lower their transparency level,
as the probability that the rival is a peach firm and the efficiency
of technology for supply chain transparency is higher.1 This
implies that as both consumers' demand for ethical production and
R&D efficiency for supply chain transparency increase, the supply
chain transparency level can be a signal of the supplier's ethical
quality level.
Our results show that adopting an efficient technology to disclose
information provides a clearer signal of ethical production. Using two
case studies, we suggest blockchain as information technology for
improving supply chain transparency, as it is tamper-proof and can
provide reliable records to consumers. In addition, blockchain technol-
ogy enables efficient supply chain management by incorporating other
technologies such as smart contracts, radio-frequency identification
(RFID), and the Internet of Things (IoT). We introduce cases of firms in
the food industry and automobile industry adopting blockchain
technology to disclose their supply chain information. These case
studies show that disclosing supply chain information raises their
ethical quality.
This study makes three main contributions to the existing
literature. First, we show that firms can use supply chain transparency
as a sustainable business strategy. Second, we analyze firms' decisions
on supply chain transparency according to their quality type. Third,
our result suggests that blockchain technology can provide supply
chain transparency, thereby demonstrating the unbiased feasibility of
industry-wide applications of such technology.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
develops the game-theoretic model of supply chain transparency and
shows the results. Section 3 suggests blockchain technology as a good
candidate for disclosing supply chain information using two case
studies. Finally, Section 4 concludes by providing a summary and the
strategic implications of our findings.
2 | SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY AS A
SIGNAL OF ETHICAL PRODUCTION
2.1 | Model design
Using a game theory approach, we describe firms' strategies for
setting their supply chain transparency levels. Two suppliers (X and
Y) exist in the market, and they produce homogeneous products.
Their products have the same quality, and the market price of
the products is 1. However, the final products differ in
whether the suppliers produce their products through an ethical
supply chain. A supply chain is ethical with a probability p and
unethical with a probability 1�p. Suppliers choose their supply
chain transparency levels simultaneously based on their ethical quality
levels.
Consumers (i¼1,…,NÞ buy the product that provides them with
higher utility. The utility function of a consumer on product X is
Ui,X ¼ qiþ qX �qið ÞtX: ð1Þ
Here, qi denotes consumer i's expectation of ethical quality. qX is
the true value of supplier X's ethical quality. Suppliers disclose their
supply chain information with a certain transparency level (tX ). The
more information a supplier discloses, the closer to the true value the
estimate becomes. Consumer i chooses product X (Y) when Ui,X >Ui,Y
(Ui,X <Ui,Y ). We also assume that when Ui,X ¼Ui,Y , consumers choose a
product randomly. Table 1 shows the market demand for each
product (DX ,DY ) under the assumption that qi is uniformly distributed
between 0 and 1.
Based on the market demand in Table 1, the profit function of a
supplier is defined as

where cq and ct denote the cost parameters of ethical production and
supply chain transparency, respectively. These cost parameters are

defined between 0 and 1 (cq, ct � 0, 1ð Þ). Since we normalize the mar-
ket price to 1, 1�cqqXð Þ represents the marginal profit. The second
term is the R&D costs incurred owing to firm i's supply chain transpar-
ency decision. The quadratic form of R&D costs is widely used and
specified in various studies, including those of Aghion et al. (2001),
Baik and Kim (2020), Bourreau and Dogan (2010), d'Aspremont and
Jacquemin (1988), Haaland and Kind (2008), Ishida et al. (2011), Lin
and Zhou (2013), Milliou and Pavlou (2013), and Tishler and Milstein
(2009). In this study, this term more specifically implies that the cost
of supply chain transparency for each good should not exceed the
marginal cost. Otherwise, firms would not disclose their supply chain
information.
2.2 | Results
The ethical quality and supply chain transparency levels have two
values (high and low). We assume that the high value is 0.9 and the
low value is 0.1. Table 2 presents the payoff depending on the ethical
quality and supply chain transparency levels of the two suppliers. The
table indicates that if the two suppliers are different types, the more
ethical supplier monopolizes the market regardless of its actions.
However, when they are the same type, higher supply chain transpar-
ency increases a supplier's market share.
Both the suppliers know their own ethical quality levels but
not the other's ethical quality level. They believe that the rival's
ethical quality has a high value with probability p. A supplier
chooses the supply chain transparency level based on the ethical
quality level. Thus, a supplier has four strategies: hh, hl, lh, llf g. hh
denotes that a supplier chooses the high supply chain transparency
level regardless of the ethical quality level. hl denotes that a supplier
chooses the high supply chain transparency level when the ethical
quality level is high and the low supply chain transparency level
when the ethical quality level is low. The other strategies are
interpreted in the same way. The suppliers choose a strategy to
maximize their expected profit. Table 3 shows the pure strategy Nash
equilibria depending on the parameters. The cost parameter of ethical
quality cq ¼0:1.
A pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists when p≤ ct. In the equilib-
rium, both the suppliers choose lh or ll depending on the parameter
conditions. Hence, when the pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists,
the suppliers disclose less supply chain information when they are
lemon firms. The degree to which peach firms disclose supply chain
information varies according to the parameter conditions. As shown in
Table 3, a lemon firm selects a high supply chain transparency level
when pþct <1, but a low supply chain transparency level when
pþct ≥ 1. Therefore, lemon firms tend to choose a low supply chain
transparency level when p and ct are higher. A similar trend is
expected for peach firms, but it is difficult to confirm this using pure
strategy Nash equilibria. Therefore, we calculate the mixed strategy
Nash equilibria for the parameter conditions for which no pure
strategy Nash equilibria exist. Table 4 shows the mixed strategy Nash
equilibria when ct or p is fixed.
In the mixed strategy Nash equilibria, ll is generally not selected.
As shown in Panel A of Table 4, when ct is fixed, as p increases, the
probability that a supplier selects hh or lh decreases, while the
probability of selecting hl increases. As shown in Panel B of Table 4,
when p is fixed, as ct increases, the probability that a supplier selects
hh or lh increases, while the probability of selecting lh decreases. This
pattern is more clearly shown when the optimal strategy is organized
by the type of supplier. Table 5 reorganizes Table 4 according to the
supplier's type.
The results in Tables 3 to 5 can be summarized as follows.
First, as the probability that the rival is a peach firm increases, the
peach firm raises its supply chain transparency level, whereas the
lemon firm lowers its supply chain transparency level. As con-
sumers' demand for ethical production increases, the likelihood of
ethical production companies existing also increases. Thus, the sup-
ply chain transparency level can be a signal of the ethical quality of
a supplier. If the supply chain transparency level becomes a clear

unethical. Under the ll strategy, a supplier chooses a low supply chain
transparency level regardless of the ethical quality level. Since the two
suppliers are symmetric, the table shows only one supplier's strategies.

signal of ethical production, demand for lemon firms' products
decreases, turning lemon firms into peach firms. This can increase
the overall utility of society.
Second, efficient technology for disclosing supply chain informa-
tion makes peach firms more transparent but lemon firms less trans-
parent. This result implies that efficient information technology makes
the supply chain transparency level a clearer signal of ethical produc-
tion. Therefore, information technology that can efficiently build a
transparent supply chain can help increase the use of ethical produc-
tion processes. Recent studies argue that blockchain technology is
considered theoretically and practically efficient for supply chain
transparency (Bai & Sarkis, 2020; Chod et al., 2020; Unnevehr, 2022).
Therefore, we examine whether blockchain technology is an alterna-
tive technology to foster supply chain transparency in Section 3. We
summarize real-time transparency, a feature of blockchain technology,
and review cases of fostering supply chain transparency using block-
chain technology.

the ledger. In a centralized ledger system, a single entity with the
appropriate authority manages the supply chain. This entity may be a
firm within the supply chain or an external agency. Centralized ledgers
such as banking systems are widely used without issue. Trust
makes such systems possible, and users pay trust fees to these
organizations, which then provide services and store, secure, and
utilize data. However, third-party centralized ledger systems may
charge excessive management and brokerage fees, and some incur
substantial security maintenance costs. A process for delivering the
data to a centralized manager is also necessary to operate a
centralized system. Including a large number of intermediate pro-
cesses can increase the time and costs incurred, thereby reducing effi-
ciency. Moreover, if a supply chain uses a centralized database,
hackers need only target that one database. Thus, even when serious
efforts are made to maintain security, the risk remains because
hackers' targets are not distributed. If hackers attack the central
database, all the center's data will be breached. Additionally, the
ledger's managers may commit fraud.
Real-time transparency, which makes the distributed ledger
transparent to users in real-time, is one of the main features of block-
chain technology (Ko et al., 2018). Blockchain's distributed ledger is
transparent because data are uploaded to a ledger shared among
participants. Furthermore, these data are impracticable based on the
time-stamping feature of blockchain technology. The most famous
example is Bitcoin, which renders the concept of a bank's central
ledger as a distributed ledger, allowing participants in the distributed
ledger to verify each other's virtual accounts. The term “real-time
transparency” describes the real-time availability of the information
uploaded to the blockchain. Most studies use the term “transparency”
rather than “real-time transparency,” although Yermack (2017)
defined the real-time disclosure of managers' equity trades as
real-time transparency.
In a broad sense, blockchain technologies can be grouped into
four types according to the combination of writing and reading
authorizations on the digital distributed ledger (Drescher, 2017;
Mougayar, 2016). A “permissionless” blockchain allows all users
(nodes) to write new information on a digital distributed ledger.
Conversely, a “permissioned” blockchain allows only selected users
(nodes) to write on the digital distributed ledger. A “disclosed”
blockchain allows all users to access information on a digital distrib-
uted ledger, whereas a “closed” blockchain allows only selected users
to access that information.
Lai and Chuen (2018) developed instructions for commercial uses
depending on the type of blockchain technology. Zheng et al. (2018)
compared blockchain technology types across consensus algorithms
such as the proof of work, proof of stake, and practical Byzantine fault
tolerance algorithms. They suggested that general blockchain technol-
ogy can be applied in various industries such as finance, the IoT, and
public and social services. However, while they contributed to the
literature by providing a basic identification of blockchain types, they
did not explain which types can be applied to which industries. Dinh
et al. (2017) attempted to evaluate the usefulness of permissioned
blockchain technology according to a new standard. They examined
the consensus, data model, execution, and applications of one
blockchain technology, namely, BLOCKBENCH.
Studies of the applications of blockchain types are crucial for
practitioners. For example, Morkunas et al. (2019) discussed the vari-
ous applications of types of blockchain technologies to support gen-
eral managers and executives. Practitioners often require functions
that are not provided by a single technology. For example, Walmart
tackles food safety in the supply chain using blockchain technology
(Kamath, 2018). Hence, the company may want to disclose informa-
tion about its goods to consumers worldwide to demonstrate and
advertise the safety of its vegetables. Disclosing such product infor-
mation to consumers may also encourage suppliers to improve their
product quality. However, the Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain
platform selected by Walmart, does not proffer these advantages
because it is a closed, permissioned blockchain platform (i.e., it is not
disclosed publicly). Such challenges make it possible for a hybrid
blockchain platform to pioneer a niche market. A hybrid blockchain
platform combines an open, permissionless blockchain with a closed,
permissioned blockchain in a single frame; in other words, the ledger
is distributed publicly, whereas the data are restricted to a firm. Thus,
a firm can disclose the quality and origin of its goods to consumers
while limiting their access to sensitive data such as financial transac-
tions with suppliers.
Lin, Haldenby, et al. (2019) developed a firm-level hybrid
blockchain architecture to simplify businesses with multiple lines and
business units along the chain from suppliers to consumers. They even
incorporate the concept of smart contracts into the architecture
(although they do not explicitly use that term) to extend the architec-
ture's usage to e-commerce. Using this architecture, the cost of
proving that suppliers, goods, and payments are appropriate should
decrease for suppliers, firms, and consumers. In addition, blockchain
technology enables automated management through the digitalized
ledger, which is expected to improve efficiency when RFID and IoT
are used as recording devices. Smart contract technology, which
automatically executes contracts based on the records in a blockchain,
can also increase efficiency. Although using these technologies to
reduce costs may still be controversial from a technical standpoint,
blockchain has great potential.
As blockchain technology's potential to create a reliable and
transparent supply chain attracts research attention, many studies are
proposing supply chain management using such technology. For
example, the Chinese agricultural market, which faces issues with
fraud, could combine blockchain and RFID technology to supply
high-quality agricultural products (Tian, 2016). Tse et al. (2017)
suggested a method for improving food quality using the transparency
provided by blockchain technology. In addition, studies argue that the
quality of composite materials can be improved by increasing supply
chain transparency using blockchain technology (Mondragon
et al., 2018). Tian (2017) designed a food supply chain using
BigchainDB, which is proposed by McConaghy et al. (2016). Tian
(2017) re-emphasized the real-time access to information afforded to
warehouse management, cold chain distribution, and the retailer.

parent and traceable consent for clinical trials in real time. Montecchi
et al. (2019) described a blockchain platform-based supply chain that
can be applied to various industries. The principal function of this
architecture is to provide trustable origins of goods in real time using
the blockchain's transparent distributed ledger.
3.2 | Case Study 1: Food safety and fair-trade
coffee
In the food industry, supply chain transparency is a traditional agri-
food supply chain issue that is particularly important for mitigating
safety problems (Ahumada & Villalobos, 2009). Unlike other types of
products, food quality is directly related to public health. Consumers
also place high expectations on safe food supply chains. Therefore,
studies of the food industry examine how to share information on
food quality, including soil quality, storage conditions, and weather
patterns (Bhat et al., 2021; Tirado et al., 2010). Many studies aim to
implement a safe and efficient food supply chain by applying a
blockchain-based traceability system (Tharatipyakul & Pongnumkul,
2021). Blockchain is a promising technology for the traceability of
food safety because of its irreversible time stamp, smart contracts,
and consensus algorithms (Lin, Wang, et al., 2019). Blockchain and
smart contracts are run as automated systems to ensure food supply
chain transparency (Casino et al., 2021). In the food supply chain,
blockchain technology is combined with IoT technology to form an
effective food traceability system that can make it easy for consumers
to acquire transaction information (Feng et al., 2020; Tsang et al.,
2021).
However, consumers are beginning to demand that supply chain
information be disclosed from a viewpoint other than safety. Some
are emphasizing ethical production in the food supply chain, for
instance (Schouteten et al., 2021). Fair-trade coffee is a representa-
tive case of ethical production in the food industry. As demand for
coffee has increased in recent times, the coffee market has begun
to grow rapidly. However, as coffee supplies increase in response,
coffee growers are paying less than coffee retailers. The fair-trade
coffee movement has thus emerged since the 1960s to reduce the
price gap between coffee retailers and coffee growers. As such,
consumers' interest in fair-trade coffee has risen (Omidvar &
Giannakas, 2015).
Although coffee is one of the most widely consumed and traded
commodities globally, the value chain of coffee is considered to be
opaque (Miatton & Amado, 2020). In particular, since coffee is pro-
duced in developing countries and consumed mainly in developed
countries, unfair trade is highly likely to take place. To solve the
opaqueness of the coffee value chain, some coffee firms, including
Starbucks, have adopted a blockchain technology-based transparent
supply chain to show their fairness to consumers (Thiruchelvam
et al., 2018). Using fair-trade labels can increase consumption. Bürgin
and Wilken (2021) argued that the high-cost problem of fair trade can
be solved by raising consumers' awareness of the benefits of fair
trade. Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance the effec-
tiveness of eco-labeling. Because consumers can track the flow of cof-
fee production using the blockchain-based traceability system, they
can monitor coffee firms' deviation from ethical practices (Garaus &
Treiblmaier, 2021).
3.3 | Case Study 2: Battery supply chain of the
Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN)
The Ford Motor Company, Huayou Cobalt, LG Chem, RCS Global, and
IBM, members of the RSBN, are devising ways to extend the supply
chain transparency of lithium-ion batteries to automobile manufactur-
ing.2 This involves transparent battery production by LG Chem on an
IBM blockchain platform. The production process starts with cobalt
production, which is the main component of lithium-ion batteries, by
Huayou Cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and ends
at the Ford Motor Company. Using the immutable and real-time data
uploading provided by a blockchain platform, the firms in this supply
chain are expected to not only improve product quality (e.g., address
issues of ethics and sustainability during production) but also reduce
costs. The RSBN plans to extend the supervision of the battery com-
ponent supply chain to tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold for original
equipment manufacturers across the electronics, aerospace, and
defense industries.
The quality of RSBN members' production can improve by using
real-time transparency, as unethical cobalt production can be super-
vised and fixed on the blockchain platform. Cobalt is becoming one of
the most widely used metals worldwide because of the increase in
demand for products (e.g., electric cars) that use it as the main compo-
nent (batteries in this case). More than half of the world's cobalt pro-
duction occurs in the DRC. Exposure to excess cobalt in the natural
environment can cause cardiomyopathy, vision/hearing impairments,
and many other diseases and is highly fatal (Paustenbach et al., 2013).
However, child labor is intensively used in the cobalt industry. This
kind of unethical approach leads to the production of low-quality bat-
teries and cars. First, unethical production itself lowers the quality of
goods because it is closely related to decreases in consumer demand
(Helms & Hutchins, 1992). Second, ethical production improves prod-
uct quality and helps create sustainable businesses in the long run
(Maguad & Krone, 2009). Indeed, Nkulu et al. (2018) argued that the
cobalt industry is unsustainable owing to its adverse effects on worker
health and the environment.
The RSBN was established to apply blockchain technology to
improve the origin of the battery components used in automobile pro-
duction and, ultimately, product quality across the supply chain. Fur-
thermore, it is expected to lower costs by skipping third-party
auditing because immutable and real-time transparent blockchain data
can be used to provide compliance information. Cobalt production is
expected to be easily subordinated to internationally ratified responsi-
bility compliance through this process.

The RSBN is aiming to expand this blockchain platform through-
out the industry, supported by the quality improvements and cost sav-
ings provided by real-time transparency. However, firms and
industries must have the incentive to deploy blockchain technology.
For instance, although most studies consider real-time transparency
to be a benefit of blockchain technology, companies are not always
willing to provide real-time transparency. In practice, companies will
only adopt blockchain technology if they have the incentive to do
so. Importantly, firms must identify the incentives associated with
adopting technology for it to be widely implemented. Adoption may
be deterred by the possibility of firms' unfair use of information asym-
metry to earn improper profits and the low cost of production for
low-quality goods. For instance, consumers are likely to incorrectly
judge the quality of goods if the product supply chain is insufficiently
transparent. They may overestimate or underestimate such quality.
Additionally, firms have the incentive to produce low-quality goods at
low cost to benefit from information asymmetry. Conversely, even if a
firm produces high-quality goods, it will not implement a blockchain
platform unless the benefits from doing so are greater than the imple-
mentation costs. Thus, the benefits of real-time transparency must be
greater than the losses from correcting information asymmetry for a
firm to implement blockchain technology.
Specifically, a lemon supplier (i.e., a supplier of low-quality goods)
may be reluctant to adopt blockchain technology if the market overes-
timates the quality of its goods in an opaque supply chain. In that
case, mitigating information asymmetry through real-time transpar-
ency would reduce that firm's profits. However, it could benefit from
implementing blockchain technology if the cost savings and improved
competition caused by the increased product quality exceeded the
benefits of maintaining information asymmetry. Conversely, peach
suppliers may improve their competitiveness by publishing informa-
tion about their goods if the supply chain is opaque. However, they
may lack the incentive to implement blockchain technology if the
original supply chain is sufficiently transparent because the additional
benefits from the technology may be below its implementation costs.
Thus, firms' preferences for enhancing and adjusting the degree of
supply chain transparency depend on the situation.
4 | CONCLUSION
In this study, we examine firms' supply chain transparency decisions.
Supply chain transparency can raise a firm's profits by increasing
consumers' preferences for its products. However, when a firm
releases its supply chain information, it may also be criticized by
consumers. In particular, as ethical consumerism is increasing
consumers' ethical standards, supply chain transparency can be risky
for firms. We analyzed how the degree of supply chain transparency
varies by firm type. We confirmed that peach firms raise their supply
chain transparency level and lemon firms lower their supply chain
transparency level, as the probability that the rival is a peach firm and
the efficiency of technology for supply chain transparency is higher.
This implies that as both consumers' demand for ethical production
and R&D efficiency for supply chain transparency are increasing, the
supply chain transparency level can be a signal of the supplier's ethical
quality level. Because blockchain technology can improve the
efficiency of R&D, we can expect consumers to distinguish ethical
suppliers through their level of supply chain transparency.
We suggest using blockchain technology to foster supply chain
transparency. Many studies and companies propose using blockchain
to manage the supply chain. We describe several cases in the food
and automobile battery supply chains as representative examples of
blockchain applications. This study analyzes companies' decision
making on supply chain transparency according to company type. It
has practical implications in that it proposes using blockchain technol-
ogy to foster supply chain transparency and describes case studies. In
future work, empirical analyses of supply chain transparency could
provide useful implications.

1 We use the term “lemon” to describe low-quality goods and “peach” to
describe high-quality goods, following the fundamental study of Akerlof
(1970). However, as we explain in the Introduction, the terms “low qual-
ity” and “high quality” describe not only the true quality of the goods
but also all the components that affect consumer sentiment, including
unethical and unsustainable manufacturing processes.
