Abstract
The emergence of wagering sites taking bets in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could lead to significant change in the way
match-fixers operate. Internet gambling has already put fixing into overdrive. Now, with cryptocurrencies, fixers have a
payment mechanism which offers them significantly more anonymity. This poses a new set of challenges not just for law
enforcement authorities but also for lawmakers. This essay analyses the appropriateness of Australia’s legislation on
match-fixing in an environment of ‘crypto-wagering’, and identifies several loopholes which could be exploited by fixers at
the cutting edge of gambling and financial technology.

1 Introduction
In March 2017, in the Austrian capital of Vienna, two
teams from the country’s sixth- and seventh-tier soccer
competitions participated in a practice match. It was
attended by a solitary spectator. Yet despite the incredibly
low profile of the match, it was available for betting on
international bookmaking websites. One of these sites,
called Cloudbet, was of particular interest, and not just
because it seemed to specialise in low-level competitions:
betting on Cloudbet can only be carried out using bitcoins.
Bitcoin is an online payment instrument (known as a
cryptocurrency) that is regarded as the perfect tool for
carrying out business on the digital black market, as it
provides the anonymity of cash with the ease of electronic
transfers. The notorious Silk Road site, nicknamed ‘the
eBay of drugs’, only accepted payments in bitcoin.1
The features that make cryptocurrencies ideal for those
nefarious activities would also seem to make it the ideal means
withwhich to place bets associatedwithmatch-fixing, a criminal
activity which has increased in frequency in the Internet age.
While there is no evidence of anything untoward
occurring in Vienna, the incident sparked the curiosity of
Austria’s Federal Police and highlights the need for legis-
lators and law enforcers to be prepared for match-fixers
looking to defraud this new type of betting market.
This essay will examine the applicability of current laws
around match-fixing and online gambling with regard to
bets placed on cryptocurrency betting sites and suggest
changes that would protect the integrity of sports from this
newly emerging threat.
It begins with an exploration of what cryptocurrencies
are and their use as a tool for black market activity, before
moving on to look at the way legislators have adapted to
this new technology in areas such as taxation and money
laundering.
The following chapter looks at the online gambling
industry and the reasons it has fostered an explosion in
match-fixing cases. The relevant laws around both fields
are then examined in detail.
An analysis of the crypto-wagering industry then pre-
cedes an assessment of how existing laws around match-
fixing and online gambling are applicable when the betting
in question is carried out with a cryptocurrency. Suggested
legislative amendments are included.
To ensure a thorough examination of the interaction
between ‘traditional’ match-fixing laws and cryptocurren-
cies, this essay focuses on the laws of Australia and its& Jack Kerr

states and territories. It is appropriate to focus on one
country’s legislation in detail as such an analysis can
provide lessons for all jurisdictions. However, in the
Internet age, no country is island, and consideration is
given to USA and European law throughout. Indeed, in the
Internet age, the laws of other nations can have consider-
able impact on the situation in Australia, and protecting the
integrity of Australian sports may be aided by some
changes to these laws.
2 Cryptocurrencies
2.1 Cryptocurrencies: an overview
Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin in the nadir of the
Global Financial Crisis as a ‘purely peer-to-peer version of
electronic cash’ which required neither government nor the
banks to operate.2 It was designed purely for transactions
made online, and while it was not the first ‘e-money’
created, it was financially revolutionary because it removed
the need for trusted third parties, such as a bank or credit
card provider, in the payment process. This is achieved
through blockchain technology, which creates a decen-
tralised ledger stored rhizomatically across bitcoin’s global
network of users. As a result, every transaction ever made
with bitcoin is publicly available to be seen.
By removing the need for an intermediary, transactions
costs are reduced to a minimum.3 By operating outside of
government, it is borderless, making international trans-
actions simpler and free of exchange fees.4 There is no
possibility of double spending, a problem with previous
Internet payment methods,5 and it is ‘almost impossible to
defraud’.6 Such technology even has the potential ‘to
transform political institutions that are central to contem-
porary human societies’.7 It has been called censorship
resistant, because there is no central authority that controls
bitcoin, and therefore no way for authorities to stop pay-
ments being made around the network.8
While bitcoin’s record of transactions is transparent,
cryptographic technology gives buyers and sellers a high
degree of—or near total—anonymity, hiding their identity
behind a non-identifying alphanumeric string of characters
known as a public key. This use of encryption has led to
bitcoin being dubbed a cryptocurrency.
Close to a thousand new cryptocurrencies have emerged in
bitcoin’s wake, encouraged in part by the explosive growth of
bitcoin’s value against the US dollar. These altcoins (alter-
natives to bitcoin) are bountiful in number and include
Litecoin, GeistGeld, SolidCoin, BBQCoin, PPCoin, through
the only serious challenger to bitcoin’s position as the gold
standard of cryptocurrencies is Ethereum. The reserve banks
of Estonia and Latvia have created their own national cryp-
tocurrencies, while a ‘kosher coin’ has been designed for the
Jewish diaspora. The fast-foodmultinational BurgerKing has
even released the Whoppercoin in Russia (though it has been
called a ‘glorified loyalty points program’).
By offering the anonymity of cash with the ease of
digital transactions, a cryptocurrency is ideal for criminal
activity—everything from laundering money for terrorism
financing to buying drugs on black market websites.9
However, the veil can be lifted, so to speak. Should
someone uncover a person’s public key, all their transac-
tions can be discovered. Links to a public key (such as an
IP address) may be left at the time of purchasing cryp-
tocurrency from an exchange. In a sense, this is like a
criminal leaving fingerprints on a dollar bill. Statistical
analysis of the blockchain has also proved effective of de-
identifying bitcoin users.10
Brito and Castillo write:
So, while Bitcoin is very similar to cash in that par-
ties can transact without disclosing their identities to
a third party or to each other, it is unlike cash in that
all the transactions to and from a particular Bitcoin
address can be traced.11
Nevertheless,
Bitcoin users do enjoy amuchhigher level of privacy than
do users of traditional digital-transfer services, who must
provide detailed personal information to the third-party
financial intermediaries that facilitate the exchange.12
This mixture of transparency and anonymity has been
called pseudo-anonymity.13
It should be noted that while cryptocurrencies seem
resistant to fraud, the exchanges that most people use to
buy and store their cryptocurrencies are not. The most
famous example of this is Mt Gox, the world’s largest
bitcoin exchange from which hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of bitcoin was stolen by hackers.
How lawmakers deal with the challenges posed by this
rapidly emerging technology will be explored in the2 Huang (2015).

following section. These challenges begin with how to
even define a cryptocurrency.
However, before doing so, it is important to note that
bitcoin is still very much a fringe player in the financial
world. While its value has skyrocketed (and then crashed),
there are still very few places it can be used, and it may be
incapable of being ‘scaled up’ to a level necessary to become
a mainstream payment option. Therefore, at this stage, it has
only limited scope to aid nefarious activities, nearly all of
which are still carried out using fiat (state-issued) currency.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies present a unique set of
challenges to lawmakers and these cannot be ignored,
especially if they do gain mainstream acceptance.
2.2 Legislative response and challenges
2.2.1 What are cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the law?
Australian notes and coins are granted status of legal tender
by the Reserve Bank Act and the Currency Act, respec-
tively.14 While this makes them the default currency of
business carried out inAustralia,15 their position is not one of
exclusivity. As per section 9 of the Currency Act, transac-
tionsmay be ‘made, executed, entered into or done according
to the currency of some country other than Australia’.16
Nevertheless, as found in Watson v Lee, the Commonwealth
does hold the constitutional right ‘to control and regulate the
receipt and use’ of such currencies within its borders.17
In any case, bitcoin is not ‘the currency of some country
other than Australia’, as a 2014 determination by the
Australian Tax Office (ATO) clarified.18 Firstly, it is
stateless. As such, under Australian law, it cannot be
considered currency, which is defined, in part, by the
recognition it receives from a state as that jurisdiction’s
default monetary unit.19
Another defining aspect of a currency is its position as ‘a
species of the broader category’ of money.20 Yet bitcoin
cannot be classed as that either.21 In coming to this deci-
sion, the ATO turned to Moss v Hancock,22 a nineteenth-
century case involving a stolen coin, which was considered
a collectable (a unique item) rather than a store of value.
The case considered the definition of money in some detail,
and this concept was developed further in Travelex,23
where Emmett J stated that bank notes are considered
money, despite not being legal tender, since it ‘is common
consent and conduct that gives a thing the character of
money’.24 Subsequently, in Messenger Press, promissory
notes were found not have this universal acceptance and
could therefore not be classed as money.25 Thus, while a
digital currency shares many ‘essential elements’ of what
money is, it cannot be considered that way until its usage
gains mainstream acceptance.26
In a separate determination, delivered simultaneously,
the ATO declared bitcoin to be property, for at least the
purposes of capital gains tax. Drawing on Yanner v Eaton,
where property was defined not as ‘a thing’ but to ‘a legal
relationship with a thing’,27 the ATO found that bitcoin
was to be considered property because, amongst other
reasons, it is ‘treated as valuable, transferable’ by those
who use it; this is evidenced by the ‘active market for trade
in bitcoin’ where ‘substantial amounts of money can
change hands between transferors and transferees’.28
However, with regard to the goods and services tax
(GST), it was announced in the 2017 Australian federal
budget that purchases made with ‘digital currencies’ would
be treated in line with purchases made with fiat currency
when it comes to this tax.29 Previously, the ATO had ruled
that the purchasing of goods with bitcoin was akin to
bartering.30
Australia’s approach to cryptocurrencies is in line with
that of many other developed nations, such as Germany and
Singapore, where cryptocurrencies are treated as financial
items subject to taxation rules.31 In the USA, cryptocur-
rencies are treated as property for federal tax purposes,32
and case law would suggest that cryptocurrencies cannot be
considered a competing currency of the US dollar under the

Stamp Payments Act,33 since they have been ‘designed for
internet transactions only and as such, at least on a theo-
retical level, cannot compete with official fiat currencies’.34
However, in regard to securities regulation, a District Court
ruled in Shavers that bitcoin is like money and therefore
subject to banking laws, at least in regard to the specifics of
that particular case.35
Borroni describes the legislative reaction to cryptocur-
rencies as ‘fragmented’, ‘heterogeneous’ and ‘dominated
by the uncertainty’ of the ‘measures to be taken’.36 This is
exemplified by the reaction in BRICS countries. On the one
extreme, the Brazilian government has classified bitcoin as
a currency, subjecting it and other digital monies to con-
ventional regulations regarding currency. Meanwhile,
Russia and China have gone in the other direction.37
2.2.2 Illicit activities
2.2.2.1 Drugs While authorities have created some
degree of control over cryptocurrencies for taxation and
financial purposes, the same cannot be said regarding the
use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. The biggest
success story in this field is also a picture of how futile
policing efforts are in the long term.
The Silk Road was a notorious black market website, or
‘clandestine eBay’, specialising in the sale of drugs. Pay-
ments were made exclusively in bitcoin, and users of the
site enjoyed high levels of anonymity. Nevertheless, US
authorities were eventually able to discover the identity of
the site’s owner (who had left his email address in an
Internet forum while developing the site). As a result, US
authorities were able to arrest him and shut down his site.
However, Silk Road’s closure has simply cleared space
on the ‘dark web’ for new sites selling drugs, stolen credit
cards and possibly even sex slaves. Huang argues the
strategy of using prosecutorial tactics against black market
Internet operators ‘seems to have been completely unsuc-
cessful’ and says authorities will have difficulty expanding
their investigatory powers for similar cases because of First
Amendment protections over Web anonymity and financial
transactions data.38
It is also worth noting that while the identity of the Silk
Road’s operator was uncovered, US authorities have been
unable to identify any of those who made illicit
transactions using bitcoin on the site.39 And unlike Silk
Road, bitcoin itself cannot be raided, nor can it be shut
down, since it is a decentralised system that ‘exists only on
a network of computers’.40 Shutting down hundreds of
computers will not be enough to disable a peer-to-peer
system.
2.2.2.2 Money laundering The head of investment firm
BlackRock says the popularity of cryptocurrencies ‘iden-
tifies how much money laundering there is being done in
the world’.41 However, Europol noted in 2015 that bitcoin
was not widely used for such activity.42 Whatever the case,
the architecture that has sprung up around cryptocurrencies
does offer some possibilities to prevent this practice.
Bitcoins are created through ‘mining’, a process that
involves the programming of computers to solve complex
mathematical problems. Each bitcoin is harder to mine than
the one before it, and such large amounts of computational
muscle are now needed to solve these riddles that mining is
beyond the capabilities of most users.
Hence, most users purchase bitcoins through an
exchange, similar to how they would purchase a foreign
currency. Thus, even despite bitcoin’s raison d’etre being
that removal of financial middleman in transactions, these
traditional financial structures have emerged to a small
degree.
Exchanges are the entry and exit points between the
cryptocurrency universe and the fiat system, and the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) says money laun-
dering regulation should focus on these.43 Stokes says these
exchanges act as ‘regulatory choke points’ that can ‘easily
be incorporated into the existing anti-money laundering
framework’.44 Some go as far as to argue that by moni-
toring these exchanges, cryptocurrencies could become less
of a money laundering threat than fiat currencies are.45

can exist in the cryptocurrency system. It’s all a
matter of adjusting perspective.46
While Kaiser notes the ‘grave problem’ that ‘service
providers suitable for money laundering operations will
establish themselves in jurisdictions with little or no
oversight’,47 in large part, exchanges are set up in juris-
dictions with traditionally strong money laundering
frameworks in place. Hileman and Rauchs’ Global Cryp-
tocurrency Benchmarking Study of 2017 found that more
than a third of exchanges were based in the UK and Eur-
ope, while close to a fifth were located in the USA and
Canada. Half of all European exchanges and most North
American ones were found to be licensed.48 Licensing was
generally absent in Asia-Pacific, a region with more
exchanges than North America, although it was noted that
‘not having a formal license does not necessarily mean that
the exchanges are not regulated, as appears to be the case
now with many of the China-based exchanges’.49
Given the borderless nature of the Internet, the FATF
says international cooperation is essential if the cryp-
tocurrencies’ use in money laundering is to be controlled.50
Australia is one country that has followed FATF’s advice,
as evidenced by recently proposed amendments to the Anti-
Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act
(AML/CTF Act).51 The changes would ‘close a regulatory
gap by regulating digital currency exchange providers’.52
This includes requirements to ‘conduct customer due dili-
gence, keep transaction records and make suspicious matter
reports’; to be registered/licensed; and to provide ‘adequate
supervision and regulation’.53
The amendments also ‘expand the definition of e-cur-
rency to include convertible digital currencies not backed
by a physical ‘‘thing’’’.54 Having the appropriate defini-
tions in place is important.
In the USA, money laundering is dealt with through
laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act,55 the Money Laun-
dering Control Act56 and the USA PATRIOT Act.57 These
acts were written in the period of 1970–2001 and were
described in 2014 as being ‘inadequate in preventing cyber
laundering because [they do] not directly acknowledge the
existence of virtual currencies’.58 However, changes to the
Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of ‘money transmission
services’ mean it now includes not just those which accept
or transmit currency or funds, but also ‘other value that
substitutes for currency’.
The European Union’s money laundering legislation
does not recognise cryptocurrencies explicitly.59 However,
it is written broadly enough to make money laundering
involving cryptocurrencies a criminal act, as its focus is not
on ‘money’ but ‘property’,60 which it defines as ‘assets of
any kind, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or
immovable, tangible or intangible’.61
3 Online betting and match-fixing
This preceding section explored the challenges and
achievements of lawmakers and regulators in dealing with
a financial instrument unforeseeable even a handful of
years ago. Clearly, cryptocurrencies also present a chal-
lenge in the area of online gambling and match-fixing.
Before assessing how lawmakers should proceed in that
area, it is necessary to look at the issues posed to sporting
integrity by fiat currency online gambling, the emergence
of which has presented authorities with a range of issues in
recent years.
This chapter begins with an overview of the interna-
tional online gambling industry and how its growth has
facilitated an explosion in match-fixing. It then examines in
detail how match-fixing is dealt with by Australian laws.
This occurs primarily through state and territory criminal
codes. As will be seen, these laws also interact with the
federal Interactive Gambling Act (IGA), and other laws and
regulations.
3.1 The online gambling industry:
an international overview
Online gambling is almost as old as the World Wide Web
itself. Three years after the public was first given access to
the web, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda
(Antigua) had legislated to allow the practice.62 In August

1995, virtually 4 years to the day since the Web went
public, what may have been the world’s first gambling
website, casino.org, was launched.63
The gambling industry, like many others, has found the
Web to be extremely fertile ground. By 1997, global gross
revenue for online gambling was already estimated to be
around US$600 million; by the end of the decade, there
may have been as many as 700 online gambling websites,64
accounting for over 4 per cent of e-commerce at the time.65
In 2015, the international sports betting market—which is
driven in large part by online betting—was, by one esti-
mation, possibly as high as $3 trillion.66 Other studies put
international expenditure at $38.5 billion in 2014, a jump
from $34 billion the year before.67 This is reflective of the
Australian experience, where online gambling expenditure
tripled to $2.4 billion from 2004 to 2014, thanks to a
booming sports betting market.68 Others say that, interna-
tionally, the legal sports betting market alone is equivalent
to almost 2 per cent of global GDP.69
While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact size of different
gambling markets (and figures may be subject to exag-
geration), it is clear that numbers involved are extraordi-
nary and the Web is a driving force in the phenomenon.
One contributing factor to the explosion of Internet
gambling is the low set-up costs involved: setting up an
online casino was found to be equivalent to the purchase of
a small number of slot machines.70 Furthermore, offshore
sites enjoy near-immunity to regulation compared to their
bricks-and-mortar counterparts,71 and even where a gov-
ernment blocks access to such a site, VPN technology
allows its citizens to go around these digital walls.72
This is not to say that online gambling sites operate
completely outside of the law. Wilson’s 2003 study on the
economic geography of the Internet gambling industry
found that ‘far from being divorced from place’, sites will
cluster in locations with favourable regulatory and tax
arrangements.73 While online gambling sites could easily
set up operations without state sanction, having a license is
‘an indicator to gamblers of their legitimacy’.74 This is
important in an environment where customers may be wary
of handing over credit card and other financial details and
where ‘high levels of competition mean that reputational
risk is important to providers’, who will generally ‘have
strong incentives to ensure customer satisfaction’ (even if
they don’t ‘plac[e] a premium on harm minimisation’).75
Thus, online gambling sites frequently engage in ‘reg-
ulatory arbitrage’,76 a phrase borrowed from discussion of
tax havens. They will set up in locations quite remote from
that of their target market, where online gambling may be
tightly policed, if not banned altogether.77 For example,
Australia has approximately two dozen licensed online
sportsbooks, and these are typically licensed in the
Northern Territory, the jurisdiction with the country’s most
favourable regulatory and tax regimes.78
A state that has lowered the bar in order to attract such
businesses is said to have engaged in the commercialisation
of sovereignty. Typically, this is done because it has little
other means by which to attract business to its shores.79
Antigua is a primary example of this, and the twin-island
microstate was estimated to control 60 per cent of online
gambling worldwide at the turn of the century.80
However, Antigua’s online gambling industry has col-
lapsed in the past decade. This is because the USA—which
frowns upon online gambling—used its extraterritorial and
financial muscle to bring the online gambling industry that
had sprung up on its doorstep to heel. Its primary weapons
have been the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement
Act (UIGEA),81 written in 2006 specifically to target
financial transactions linked to online gambling, and the
Wire Act, legislation from the 1960s designed to stop
organised criminals using telephonic technologies to con-
duct gambling across state lines.82 Through this and other
legislation, US authorities have been able to arrest key
players in the online gambling industry and enforce credit
card payment restrictions to gambling sites.83
In contrast to the prohibitionist USA, the UK has
encouraged and facilitated a domestic online gambling
industry. A 2014 Sorbonne-ICSS audit of the online gam-
bling industry found the UK, along with its crown

dependencies of Alderney (Guernsey) and the Isle of Man
and its overseas territory of Gibraltar, had licensed hun-
dreds of gambling operators between them.84
Other ‘sports betting havens’ included Costa Rica,
Malta, the Philippines’ semi-autonomous Cagayan pro-
vince, Curacao and the Canadian Indian reservation of
Kahnawake. Many of these jurisdictions are far more
relaxed about regulation than the UK.
The attitude of Costa Rica, far and away the biggest hub
in the Sorbonne-ICSS list, is described as laissez-faire,85
while many of the companies based there have been
labelled as ‘dubious’.86 Cagayan, which is home to some of
the biggest betting sites in the world, is considered a grey
market, as it sits at the apex of Asia’s vast gambling black
market, with bets flowing up from smaller agents (via super
agents) looking to pool the risk of their bets.87 One off-
shore betting site recently discovered offering odds on
Australian community sports was linked to organised
criminals and match-fixing.88 Offshore gambling sites have
also been linked to money laundering.89
3.2 Match-fixing
Match-fixing is not a new issue, but it is one that has been
fundamentally accelerated by the growth of the online
gambling industry. Chris Eaton, the former head of security
with FIFA, says the ‘vulnerability of sport to [this type of]
corruption has increased exponentially over the internet-
age’.90 Interpol’s Secretary General Ronald K Noble
(paraphrased by Carpenter) notes that
with increased internet access, remote betting has
revolutionised the gambling market in terms of reach
and speed, providing opportunities for cybercrime to
overlap illegal betting, creating more potential targets
and more challenges for law enforcement.91
Hill describes the threat accordingly:
In the pre-internet days, it was sometimes difficult for a
fixer to get enough money into the gambling market to
make the fix worthwhile. They had to hire ‘‘beards’’
and ‘‘runners’’— people who could put their money on
without seeming to be connected with the fixers. Now
with a click of the mouse the fixer can place bets with a
half-dozen bookmakers around the world, and with a
few elementary precautions, no one is the wiser.92
This is also true of in-play betting (which takes place as
a game is in action). This type of betting is popular with
fixers as it allows them to manipulate the odds, for
example, by having the favourite team concede a goal early
in a match, before then playing to win. Suspicious bets
placed during a match are also less likely to attract
unwanted attention from those monitoring the markets for
suspicious movements in the odds.93
The anomalies created by corrupt betting are also more
difficult to detect in more liquid betting markets, and the
growing popularity of Internet gambling has resulted in
increasingly greater liquidity for smaller matches. This is of
particular concern because players in lower leagues get little (if
any) pay and are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as their
professional counterparts. This makes them easier to
manipulate.94
Moreover, this increased liquidity encourages gambling
operators to accept large bets on games that previously
would have attracted insignificant betting interest, thus
making it more worthwhile for gamblers to fix such mat-
ches as they can get higher returns.95 Forrest calls liquidity
the ‘friend of the fixer’ and says it is ‘key to how prof-
itable buying a fix is and therefore how much it will be
worthwhile to pay a player to execute the fix’.96
Low liquidity in the market for event contingencies—
such as the outcome of the next serve in tennis—is the
reason ‘spot fixing’ is not considered a major threat.97
In addition to betting on the result of a match, fixers
commonly bet on the total number of goals that will be
scored, and on the Asian Handicap market. The Asian
Handicap is a form of handicap betting ‘settled by adding
the handicap to the outcome of the match’.98 An analysis of
suspicious betting patterns found:
[T]he traditionalfixofhaving a particular team losingby
a predefined margin still appears to be a frequently used
method (which enables a maximisation of profit on the
Asian Handicap and Total Goals betting markets).99

Furthermore:
[T]he prevalence of suspicious betting in the Handi-
cap markets, and in particular Asian Handicap mar-
kets, clearly reflects the fact that the Asian betting
markets (where these types of bets are immensely
popular) account for the majority of illicit funds
being bet on football. According to estimates, over
70% of the betting turnover for football is recorded
with Asian bookmakers.
European regulated bookmakers restrict stakes and
disclose client details to law enforcement authorities.
The Asian system of bookmaking (i.e. bets are col-
lected from the street, betting shops, online and
telephone betting and are passed up through a hier-
archical agent system), on the contrary, allows bets to
be placed anonymously and without betting limits.
Hence, it is clear as to why professional fixers pre-
dominantly choose the Asian bookmakers to directly
place their bets with.100
3.3 Australia’s legislative response
and challenges
3.3.1 Online sports betting
Sports betting was legal in all Australian states and terri-
tories in the nineteenth century. However, a series of sports
bribery cases involving cricketers, footballers and cyclists
led to the activity being outlawed, and although it existed
on the black market, it remained illegal until the 1980s,
when states began to wind back restrictions. (Throughout
this period of prohibition, wagering on racing continued to
be legal.)101
Betting on major events such as the Sydney–Hobart
Yacht Race was followed by ‘mildly successful’ Footy-
TABs. But it was only with the emergence of the Internet
that the ‘true potential of sportsbetting began to be
revealed’. In 1996, the Northern Territory became the first
jurisdiction to allow online betting, and other jurisdictions
followed suit shortly thereafter.102
The real game changer for Australia’s online sports
betting industry was 2008’s High Court’s ruling in Betfair
v Western Australia,103 which paved the way for online
sportsbooks to not only operate across borders but also to
be able to advertise in jurisdictions other than that where
they held their licence. Thus, being licensed in a remote
part of the country was no longer commercially
disadvantageous.104
3.3.1.1 The Interactive Gambling Act Gambling law and
regulation in Australia has historically been a matter for the
states and territories.105 However, the Commonwealth
government is empowered under section 51(v) of the
Constitution to legislate activity involving ‘postal, tele-
graphic, telephonic, and other like services’.106 The defi-
nition of ‘other like services’ has been shown to include
radio services (in R v Brislan)107 and television services (in
Jones v Commonwealth),108 and the federal parliament has
also taken this to include Internet services. Thus, in 2001,
the Interactive Gambling Act, Australia’s primary legisla-
tion regarding online betting, was introduced.109
Regarding sports betting, the Interactive Gambling Act
prohibits online in-play betting, though it allows it by
telephone110 and allows it to be done pre-match by com-
puter.111 Notably, it does not prevent a person from making
such a bet, but targets sites with ‘an Australian-customer
link’ that ‘intentionally provides a prohibited interactive
gambling service’.112 Services which are not licensed by
any Australian state or territory are prohibited from doing
business in Australia.113 The act has explicit extra-territo-
rial application,114 as well as extending to Australia’s
external territories.115
Nevertheless, hundreds of offshore betting sites allow
Australian customers to access their services, and despite
dozens of complaints being referred by the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to the
Australian Federal Police (AFP) for further investigation,
not one charge has yet been laid over a breach of the In-
teractive Gambling Act. This has been said to represent a
lack of will (or resources) by the AFP to follow up such
matters, and to demonstrate the difficulty in pursuing those
located overseas, even when armed with extraterritorial

power. Nor have any charges have been laid over breaches
of the act by domestic operators.116
3.3.1.2 The Unlawful Gambling Act The Interactive
Gambling Act allows for state laws, many of which came
into existence first, to coexist with it where they are not in
conflict.117 In contrast to the Interactive Gambling Act (but
not in conflict with it), New South Wales’ Unlawful
Gambling Act does criminalise an individual’s placing of a
bet with an unlicensed Internet (or telephone) gambling
service, in addition to penalising the bookmaker.118
Written prior to Betfair v Western Australia and the
Interactive Gambling Act, the legislation focuses heavily
on race wagering. For example, section 8 (3) prohibits
Internet and telephone betting on Australian horse, harness
or greyhound races with a bookmaker operating illegally
(that is, without a New South Wales license)119 or without
the authorisation of another state or territory.120 An
amendment from 2000 clarifies that this subsection relates
to bookmakers located overseas (and, if unlicensed there,
interstate),121 with parliamentary debate raising particular
concerns that bookmakers were simply moving their
operations to countries like Vanuatu from where they could
continue to serve their New South Wales clientele.
While online sports betting was still a niche activity
when it passed,122 the New South Wales legislation would
nevertheless seem to still apply to this activity, even if it
does not mention it within its pages. For example, sec-
tion 8(1)(a) prohibits ‘betting on any event or contingency
if the person is not present at a licensed racecourse and the
bet is made with a bookmaker’,123 and section 10 prohibits
‘making a bet with another person if the person knows, or
would reasonably be expected to know, that the other
person is carrying on bookmaking in contravention of this
Act’.124
This act does not define event,125 although a definition
contained within the state’s match-fixing laws (discussed
later) does include sporting events.126 The findings in IG
Index v State of New South Wales also lend weight to the
argument that the sports betting is covered by the state’s
act.127 While giving consideration to the plaintiff’s argu-
ment that it may be limited to racing events,128 Bongiorno J
defined a bookmaker as ‘one who quotes odds and accepts
bets on (usually) sporting or similar contingencies’.
Indeed, he ruled that evenbetting on themovement of stock
indices (financial spread betting)may be prohibited under this
legislation.129 However, in this case, the state act was found to
be inconsistentwith the Part 7 of the federalCorporations Act,
since their activity ‘involves dealing in derivatives’, and thus
the ASIC-licensed company was at fault.130 This may be
worthy of further reflection, given bitcoin’s legal status as
something other than money or currency.
3.3.2 Match-fixing laws
Australian legislators have begun to take the issue of
match-fixing seriously in recent years. In 2011, in response
to this ‘emerging and critical issue’, the relevant state and
territory ministers (and their federal counterpart) signed the
National Policy on Match Fixing in Sport.131 It committed
all parties to introduce nationally consistent legislation
which would see those involved in fixing matches liable for
maximum penalties of 7–10 years in jail.132
New South Wales was the first state to act on this
agreement, passing amendments to the Crimes Act the
following year.133 Near-identical legislation was passed in
South Australia a short time later.134 Victoria followed suit
in 2013,135 followed by the two mainland territories.136
Queensland introduced slightly amended legislation in the
coming months.137 Neither Western Australia, Tasmania
nor Norfolk Island is yet to fulfil this commitment.

Under New South Wales and analogous legislation,
match-fixing by itself is not prohibited, as this could have
led to the criminalisation—or ‘overcriminalisation’ —of
genuine poor performance.138 Rather, the laws’ focus is
conduct which ‘corrupts a betting outcome of an event’,139
and it is only when a match is fixed for the purposes of
defrauding the betting market that an offence has occur-
red.140 Specifically, for an offence to occur, there must be
an intention to obtain financial advantage (or cause finan-
cial disadvantage) through betting on a fixed match. (While
fixing is largely done for profit, there can be sporting rea-
sons to ‘tank’: for example, in the AFL, the team which
finishes last gets the first pick in the national player draft.)
Queensland’s legislation is slightly different, with a person
committing an offence when they engage in match-fixing
conduct for any pecuniary benefit.141 It is the only legis-
lation to use the term match-fixing.142
It is worth noting that for an offence to occur, it must be
lawful to bet on the (fixed) event ‘under a law of this State,
another State, another Territory or the Commonwealth’.143
(Queensland does not include a reference to territory law in
its legislation144 and does not provide a definition of state
which may have included the territories.145) The fixing of
event contingencies—such as the outcome of the next ball
in cricket—for financial advantage is also an offence.146
Victoria’s laws were used to prosecute those involved in
fixing matches of the Southern Stars state league soccer
team and tennis player Oliver Anderson. In both instances,
fixing took place for the purposes of financial advantage.
However, attempts to prosecute a ‘courtsider’ transmit-
ting data from the Australian Open to a betting syndicate in
the UK failed. Even though the courtsider and his syndicate
may have been having an influence on the betting markets,
whether corruptly or not, they were in no way involved in
influencing or attempting to influence the sporting
performance.
Prior to the introduction of sports-specific legislation
being introduced, match-fixers could be charged with
fraud, or attempted fraud as NRL player Ryan Tandy was
in 2010.
3.3.3 Betting and integrity agreements
The National Policy on Match Fixing in Sport also saw
states and territories commit to granting national sporting
bodies (Sports Controlling Bodies, or SCBs) veto rights over
what bets could be offered on their competitions, if the sport
chose to permit betting on some or any of its competitions at
all.147 The relevant authority would also be granted this
power.148 Sports were also able to create integrity agree-
ments with bookmakers which would give them (and police)
information regarding suspicious bets, as well as an agreed
amount of moneys bet on their competitions.149 Sports
organisations were also required to meet integrity bench-
marks in order to continue receiving government funding.150
This section of the policy was modelled on legislation pas-
sed in 2007 in Victoria, where SBCs could apply to the Vic-
torian Commission for Gambling Regulation for betting to be
offered on their competitions.151 New SouthWales’ version of
the legislation came into effect in 2015.152 The ACT has been
approving events for betting since 2001,153 while South Aus-
tralia has approved betting on event contingencies (though not
events as a whole) since 2000.154 The Northern Territory’s
Administrator may, under the Racing and Betting Act, make
regulations relating to ‘betting at approved sporting events’.155
Using soccer as an example, it is easy to see different
approaches between different jurisdictions.
New South Wales lists a number of specific competi-
tions that can be bet on. As far as Australian competitions
go, betting is allowed on the A-League and the ‘NSW State
League’.156 Victoria allows betting on ‘[m]atches con-
trolled and regulated by national or international authori-
ties’,157 as well as all games organised by state leagues.158

The Northern Territory allows betting from district level up
to international competitions in a wide number of sports,
including soccer.159
New South Wales and South Australia allow betting on
a wide number of event contingencies, although neither
permits Asian handicap betting. Nonetheless, this betting
type is still available in Australia.
Western Australia’s Betting Control Act grants the
state’s the Gaming and Wagering Commission power to
decide which sporting events may be bet on.160 Approved
events are to be announced in the government’s Gazette.161
While a vast number of betting types have been approved,
including several handicap betting types, Asian Handicap
betting is not included in that list.162 A search of the
Gazette’s database turned up no list of approved betting
events. In any case, the Racing and Wagering Act, which
classes itself as a superior act,163 allows the RWWA to
conduct betting on any sporting event,164 unless it would
not be in the public interest to do so.165 The act gives a
broad definition of a sporting event that includes any event
‘prescribed in the rules of wagering or by the regulations as
a sporting event’.166 (The rules of wagering simply outline
who the RWWA has authority over.)167 Thus, it would
appear that Western Australia offers a virtually limitless
number of sporting events which can be bet on, as well as a
long list of betting types.
3.3.4 Identification
All users of an Australian online gambling site must pro-
vide appropriate identification within at least 90 days of
opening an account, and this must be verified by the site
operator.168 As per ‘know your customer’ (KYC) princi-
ples, a user must provide their name, date of birth and
residential address, at a minimum, via ‘reliable and inde-
pendent documentation’ or ‘reliable and independent
electronic data’.169 Until their identification has been ver-
ified, customers are not permitted to withdraw funds.170
This requirement is prescribed by the CEO of the Aus-
tralian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUS-
TRAC), the country’s financial intelligence agency, who is
empowered to make such a demand through the AML/CTF
Act.171
The Northern Territory is an example of a jurisdiction
with stricter rules: its Code of Practice for Responsible
Online Gambling 2016 declares identification must be
provided within 45 days.172
4 Crypto-wagering
Using the above analysis of cryptocurrencies, online
gambling and match-fixing, it is now possible to look at the
interplay between the relevant laws in these areas.
4.1 Industry overview
Given the rapid evolution of Internet gambling, it should
come as no surprise that the online gambling industry has
also been quick to embrace cryptocurrencies. From April
2012, when the first such site, SatoshiDice, was launched,
gambling with cryptocurrency (herein shortened to crypto-
betting, or, where it relates to betting on sports, crypto-
wagering) has grown into a multi-billion dollar business.
Within months of the Silk Road being shut down in 2013, it
was estimated that roughly half of all bitcoin transactions
involved online gambling173—perhaps because there are
few other means with which to use bitcoin.174 By 2015,

Over that same 2-year window, turnover reportedly dou-
bled to US $2 billion.177
Of the thousands of crypto-betting sites available online,
only a handful offer crypto-wagering, a ratio which mirrors
that found in the broader Internet betting industry. Thirty-
six wagering sites are listed by Sportsbook Review (SBR)
as specialising in or accepting bets in cryptocurrencies.178
Figures compiled from SBR show that over 60 per cent of
these sites are located in Costa Rica. Three are located in
Panama and Antigua, while another three are Caribbean
based (Curacao; Jamaica). In total, sites in the Americas
account for 86 per cent of those on the SBR list. Of the
remainder, one is listed by SBR as being UK based,179
although its website makes no reference to a location or
licensing country.180 Three other sites have no location
listed. The remaining site, Cloudbet, is the only operation
licensed by Montenegro.181 (See Table 1.)
By comparison, the 2014 Sorbonne-ICSS survey of the
world’s ‘sports betting havens’ showed an approximate
50-50 split between sites in the Americas and those in the
rest of the world.182 The UK, along with Alderney,
Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, granted more than a quarter
of licences on the Sorbonne-ICSS list. Sites recently found
by ACMA to be in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act,
as revealed through a freedom of information request
posted on their website, were all located in Europe (Malta
and three UK-linked islands).183
Thus, the crypto-wagering industry may be considered
highly US-focussed and possibly uninterested in the
European market. This is reinforced when one considers
the branding of the SBR-listed sites, nearly all of which

feature gridiron (American football) as their primary sport
(at least for design purposes). Soccer—as it is called on
these sites—is rarely incorporated as a design feature. It
should also be noted that more than a third of sites were
found to be using servers in the USA. (See Appendix 1).
This US focus makes sense given that the Unlawful
Internet Gambling Enforcement Act means financial
transactions to gambling sites are heavily restricted in that
country.184
Thus, the geographic complexion of the crypto-gam-
bling industry is reminiscent of the Internet gambling
industry in its early days, which existed primarily on the
USA’s doorstep (until authorities stepped up their efforts
against such operations). This intense focus on the US
market may suggest that prohibition is driving people
further out of the reach of authorities, making improprieties
such as match-fixing harder to police.
Other advantages crypto-betting sites may have over
regular betting sites include reduced transaction fees and
better odds from the bookmaker, as a result of the book-
maker not having to deal with traditional financial gate-
keepers.185 Another advantage for ‘the house’ is that
cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, protecting
them from fraud and non-payment.186
For consumers, the transparency provided by blockchain
technology offers greater protection against untrustworthy
operators.187 However, pseudo-anonymity is less important
because it is the bookmaker, not the gambler, who is tar-
geted by US laws.
4.2 Match-fixing
The Internet has fuelled an explosion in match-fixing.
Crypto-wagering has enabled bets to be almost untraceable.
It would seem, therefore, that cryptocurrencies could make
the fixing of matches even more attractive to criminals and
easier for athletes to organise autonomously. According to
the Bitedge blog: ‘Bitcoin and match fixing are a match
made in heaven … as someone who understands sports
betting and bitcoin I can see no way to stop it’.188
While no such cases have yet emerged, Austria’s federal
police have investigated the appearance of a low-level
practice match involving football teams in the sixth- and
seventh-tier leagues on a number of betting sites. One of
those sites was the Montenegro-based Cloudbet, a site
which deals exclusively in cryptocurrency payments. A
spokesperson for the site said that betting on such low-level
games is quite popular, and an analysis of their site found
that they frequently set books on low-level games.189
In Australia, Cloudbet appears to have offered live
betting opportunities on games from the Victorian State
League 1 and 2, which are fourth- and fifth-tier leagues in
the Australian football pyramid. For example, the Cloudbet
site contains deactivated pages for betting on matches such
as Essendon Royals v Altona City, Essendon Royals v
Keilor Park, Banyule City v Keilor Park, Keilor Park v
Altona Magic, Altona Magic v Westgate FC, Westgate FC
v Preston Lions, Westgate FC v Cairnlea, Westgate FC v
Keilor Park and FC Clifton Hill v Mornington.190 (For
sample screenshots, see Appendix 2).
While there is nothing to suggest that games listed on
Cloudbet have been fixed, the fact that such small games
are appearing on any site, let alone a crypto-wagering site,
has raised concerns.
That said, there may currently be insufficient liquidity in
the crypto-wagering markets to make fixing viable. Gam-
bling may account for half of bitcoin transactions, but these
equal just 5 per cent of bitcoin’s total transaction values.191
Of the sites listed by SBR, some received as few as 15
unique visitors per day.192 Only one of these global sites,
Bovada, had more visitors than the popular Australian fiat
currency site Sportsbet.193 On lower-tier games, liquidity
may be especially low.
Regardless, sports and authorities must be prepared for
the risk that crypto-fixing poses.
4.3 Match-fixing and online gambling laws
As already discussed, most Australian states have specific
and near-identical legislation to deal with match-fixing.
These laws focus on the corruption of a betting outcome
rather than the fixing of the result itself (although that
constitutes part of the crime). In this section, the adequacy
of these laws to deal with a match-fixing case on the
(offshore) crypto-wagering market will be explored.

4.3.1 What is an ‘event’?
The first thing to consider is the insistence of the relevant
states’ laws that, for a match-fixing offence to have
occurred, it must have been lawful to bet on the event in
question ‘under a law’ of an Australian jurisdiction.194
Let us consider two sets of games, both of which have
attracted the (seemingly exclusive) interest of offshore
bookmakers. The first is the suburban soccer matches being
offered on the Cloudbet site. The second is midweek
community basketball matches such as those recently being
offered on international betting sites without the permis-
sion of competition organisers.195
A state like Victoria gives a sport’s approved controlling
body the power to veto betting types. This is consistent
with its commitments to the National Policy on Match-
Fixing in Sport. As such, betting on almost any soccer
match is permitted, thanks to the permission granted by
Football Federation Australia.
However, Basketball Australia has chosen not to permit
betting on matches below the country’s second-tier com-
petitions. They have also signed integrity agreements with
Australian bookmakers which stipulate this, and as such,
these games are not available for betting with Australia
bookmakers.196
Regardless, placing a bet on such a competition may still
be lawful, even if it cannot be done locally. This is because
a state like Western Australia has not followed through
with its commitments to the National Policy on Match-
Fixing in Sport and has maintained its relaxed regulations
which allow betting on such a competition.
Ironically, had it and other jurisdictions all implemented
their commitments to this national policy, this competi-
tion’s legal protection against match-fixing may have been
weakened.197 Prosecutors would be left to argue that such
betting was permitted under the Interactive Gambling Act,
which seems ridiculous at first glance: one of the intents of
that legislation is to prohibit unlicensed bookmakers from
accepting bets from Australian customers.
However, the Interactive Gambling Act does not pro-
hibit the placing of bets; at the same time, match-fixing
laws are concerned with events ‘on which it is lawful to
bet’.198 Therefore, if one can bet on an event without
punishment, that action could be considered lawful, even if
accepting that bet is a crime. Prosecutors would certainly
hope this is the case.
The lawfulness of such betting with cryptocurrencies, as
is possible on the Cloudbet site, will be examined in detail
in the next section. However, it should be noted that while
the Northern Territory has said it will ban the practice,199
no such legislation has so far been passed either there or
elsewhere. Therefore, on the surface at least, it would seem
bets placed with cryptocurrencies are covered by the law-
ful-to-bet element of the relevant states’ acts in the same
manner as fiat currency bets are.
4.3.2 What is a ‘bet’?
Having established that a vast number of sporting events
are covered by match-fixing laws, the next step is exam-
ining the interplay between cryptocurrencies and other
parts of these laws. After all, if a cryptocurrency is neither
money, currency nor a tangible asset, can one still place a
‘bet’ with it?
In Nevada, a wager is defined as ‘a sum of money or
representative of value that is risked on an occurrence for
which the outcome is uncertain’,200 and a representative of
value as ‘any instrumentality used by a patron in a game
whether or not the instrumentality may be redeemed for
cash’.201 Under the USA’s Unlawful Internet Gambling
Enforcement Act, a bet or wager may involve ‘the staking
or risking’ of ‘something of value’ with the agreement
‘something of value’ will be returned ‘in the event of a
certain outcome’.202
Australian law is not as explicit.203 For example, New
South Wales’ Crimes Act merely states the definition of a
bet includes the placing, acceptance and withdrawal of a
194 See, e.g. Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 193 J; Crimes Act 1958 (Vic)
s 195B.

wagering-and-sports-betting/about-wagering-and-sports-betting/app
roved-betting-events.
197 Taken to their logical conclusion, Australia’s match-fixing laws
have produced the curious situation where the protection of low-level
competitions from the integrity threats presented by offshore betting
sites would require these same competitions to make themselves
available to domestic bookmakers. Lawmakers should give serious
thought to removing the lawful-to-bet requirement from match-fixing
laws. Ergo, if the Australian betting market is of little concern to
international match-fixers, then it should not be relevant to match-
fixing laws either.

bet, and the causing of these actions to take place.204 That
state’s Unlawful Gambling Act does not define betting,
only gambling, which is ‘gaming, betting or wagering’.205
According to the Interactive Gambling Act, a bet ‘includes
wager’, but a wager is not defined.206
Of somewhat more use is the Interactive Gambling Act’s
definition of a gambling service, which is, inter alia, ‘a
service for the conduct of a game’ where ‘the game is
played for money or anything else of value’ (and involves
an element of chance).207 The Unlawful Gambling Act
defines money as including ‘any valuable thing or any
security for money’.
Additionally, the Macquarie Dictionary’s definitions of
a bet include ‘the pledge as a forfeit to another who makes
a similar pledge in return’ and ‘a pledge of something to be
forfeited, in case one is wrong, to another who has the
opposite opinion’.208 A wager is defined, in part, as
‘something staked or hazarded on an uncertain event’.209
These beg the question: is a cryptocurrency, which
‘survives purely in an intangible electronic medium’,210 a
‘something’? (Or, more simply, a ‘thing’?) This question
needs to be considered in the light of Yanner v Eaton, in
which it was found that property is not ‘a thing’, but is ‘a
degree of power…exercised over the thing’. Therefore, if
cryptocurrency is property, it follows that it is the power
that could be exercised over ‘the thing’, which is the
cryptocurrency itself.211
While cryptocurrencies’ place within the law is very
much in its infancy, there is certainly good reason to
assume that a bet placed with a cryptocurrency would be
considered a bet, at the very least insofar as match-fixing is
concerned. However, these laws should be amended to
make this clear.
4.3.3 What is a ‘financial advantage’?
Proceeding on the assumption that crypto-wagering is
betting, attention can now turn to another element of the
match-fixing laws: the necessity that a financial advantage
be obtained, or that a financial disadvantage be caused to
another.212
The Macquarie Dictionary defines financial as: ‘of or
relating to monetary receipts and expenditure; having to do
with money matters; pecuniary’ and ‘commonly engaged
in dealing with money and credit’.213 Similarly, the defi-
nitions of pecuniary all relate to money.214 A defendant
could quite rightly argue that since cryptocurrencies are not
considered money in Australia, their activity cannot be said
to have allowed them to obtain a financial advantage.
However, quite cleverly, these laws also make it an
offence to cause financial disadvantage to others. Consider
a case where match-fixers have manipulated the AFL
Grand Final. Everyone who bet on this game would be
impacted by the fixers’ actions, and many will have suf-
fered a financial disadvantage when they lose their money
on the scripted result. Similarly, the fact that many other
innocent third parties obtained a financial advantage
through these actions, when the result went their way, is
also cause for an offence.
But what if a smaller game, such as those on the
Cloudbet site, were only being offered on crypto-wagering
sites? Since bitcoin is not money, under definitions pro-
vided above, no person has been monetarily (and therefore
financially) advantaged or disadvantaged. What they have
lost is property. That said, if a single person has placed a
bet from Brazil, where bitcoin is considered money, an
offence would seemingly have taken place. (But good
luck trying to find that Brazilian gambler).
To ensure this part of the legislation is relevant to bet-
ting that is undertaken with cryptocurrencies, the meaning
of financial advantage and disadvantage could be broad-
ened to include wins and losses of property and/or
cryptocurrency.
4.4 International approach
This analysis has demonstrated a number of problems with
the interaction between crypto-wagering and current laws
against match-fixing. This can be amplified when low-tier
matches are involved. Such issues could be addressed with
amendments clarifying that (a) crypto-wagering is a form
of betting and (b) that wins on such sites constitute a
financial advantage. Amendments should also ensure that
match-fixing laws cover all games, irrespective of the
legality of betting on these games.
But would such changes stop an international organised
crime syndicate from fixing matches for the purpose of
defrauding the crypto-wagering market? Probably not,
given the regularity with which these syndicates disregard
laws around fiat currency match-fixing.

Legislators should, therefore, also consider more lateral
approaches to the issue. For example, bringing the crypto-
wagering market onshore, where it can be regulated, could
transform these sites from the regulatory black holes they
are at present into regulatory choke points. In this way,
they would mirror the position that cryptocurrency
exchanges hold in the fight against money laundering.
While authorities may never be able to establish the owner
of a bitcoin per se, if betting sites are required to run
appropriate KYC identity checks, as per anti-money laun-
dering legislation, it can be seen who used the site to place
the suspicious bet. In Australia, these sites would also be
required to sign integrity agreements that facilitate infor-
mation sharing around suspicious betting.
This approach would help catch small-time local fixers
using local betting sites. However, international syndicates
would continue to use unregulated offshore sites. As the
research in this essay has demonstrated, these sites seem
focussed on the USA, where the Unlawful Internet Gam-
bling Enforcement Act and other laws limit opportunities to
bet online.
The recent US Supreme Court decision allowing states
to permit sports betting will have some impact here. But
this impact will be muted, since the federal Wire Act still
prevents betting across borders, and only a handful of states
may actually allow a move to online sports betting.
It would be interesting to see whether a further easing of
US online gambling laws would reduce the liquidity of the
offshore crypto-wagering markets, as the Australian expe-
rience suggests most gamblers much prefer to bet with
locally licensed operations.215 A reduction in the size of
this market would make fixing through these channels less
lucrative and more difficult to disguise.
Therefore, it may be the case that the best way to protect
the integrity of Australian sport from the dangers posed by
the crypto-wagering market is to lobby for changes to the
laws of another country. This situation would highlight
how problems of Internet governance require a global
approach.
5 Conclusion
The law struggles to stay relevant in the face of techno-
logical advances. This essay has demonstrated a number of
flaws in Australia’s current legislative position on cryp-
tocurrencies, match-fixing and online gambling, and the
interplay between them. For the protection of the integrity
of sport, the Commonwealth’s Interactive Gambling Act
and various state criminal codes should be amended to
ensure they are pertinent to betting conducted via crypto-
wagering sites.
Australia could also consider bringing the crypto-wa-
gering industry onshore, a move that would encourage
crypto-wagering to occur on sites licensed in a country
with appropriate ‘know your customer’ oversight. In this
way, crypto-wagering sites could be the regulatory choke
points that cryptocurrency exchanges are in relation to
money laundering.
In the Internet age, no country is an island, not even
Australia, and legislators cannot take an insular approach to
such issues. Given the US focus of crypto-wagering sites, it
can be argued that the integrity of Australian sport may be
best served by the relaxation of US prohibitions against
online sports betting. This move could undercut the
demand for these sites. It remains to be seen whether the
changes currently underway in the USA will be enough to
do this.
