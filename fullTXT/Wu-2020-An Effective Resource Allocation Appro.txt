Abstract. As a promising technology, mobile edge computing (MEC)
can provide an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities
at the edge of the mobile network, and also can reduce latency, improve
user experience. In this paper, we have proposed a MEC system con-
sisting of one privately service provider (SP) and multiple mobile users
(MU). A game theory approach for resource allocation optimization is
proposed to analyze the interaction between the leader SP and the fol-
lowers MUs. We have introduced the congestion factor between different
MUs. In addition, we prove the existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE)
by game theory method and design an efficient the best response (BR)
algorithm to solve this problem. An optimal equilibrium strategy can
be obtained by the BR algorithm, and experiment results have demon-
strated the efficiency and feasibility of the algorithm.

1 Introduction
With the continuous improvement and development of mobile multimedia appli-
cations, the demand for computation service resources are also growing. More-
over, mobile user (MU) has become an indispensable part of modern life in recent
years. Especially short video applications have suddenly become popular, and
the number of video has increased dramatically. Therefore, MUs are required to
process large amounts of data. This is a great challenge for mobile users with
limited computation ability [1]. To tackle the challenge, computing tasks can be
offloaded from mobile terminals to edge cloud computing, which has powerful
processing and computing capabilities. Hence, as a promising technology, mobile
edge computing (MEC) is considered as a potential solution [2]. MEC can pro-
vide an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of
the mobile network, and can also reduce latency, improve user’s experience.
The resource allocation issues of mobile device were analyzed in [3–5], but
they only concerned the computation offloading problem. [6] only considered

the security defense problem and stable operation of the MEC network system.
Although, there also had some works focused on the joint problem of network
economics and resource allocation. A double auction mechanism with dynamic
pricing was proposed by [7,8] and [15] focused on solving the problem of cost
minimization to obtain the optimal dynamic pricing strategy effectively.
Instead, in our paper, we consider the joint problem of network economics
and resource allocation with the form of pricing. A new effective resource allo-
cation approach is formulated aiming at maximizing each user’s utility in MEC
scenario. We focus on the resource allocation in one service provider (SP) and
multiple MUs as a non-cooperative game. The SP is a monopolist who sells a
divisible limited resource with a fixed price to multiple MUs. We assume that
each MU is independent of the others and makes its best strategy only based on
its local information. Next, based on the price announced by the SP, all MUs
make their strategy of purchasing computing service resources to maximizes their
utilities. Furthermore, considering the existence of multiple MUs, different MUs
will compete for the limited computing resource of SP. In addition, we introduce
the congestion factor, which is related to the amount of resources purchased by
other MUs. The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
– We consider the joint problem of network economics and resource allocation.
Then, we propose a non-cooperative competition game model for one SP and
multiple MUs in MEC scenario. The competing model in this paper can be
extended to multi-SP scenarios.
– We take into channel gain and congestion cost. The aim of the game is to max-
imize the number of allocated computation resources users and their utilities
with capacity constraints.
– We analyze the game model and prove that there exist a NE. A BR algo-
rithm for finding the NE solution is proposed in the game. We analyze the
performance of the algorithm theoretically and experimentally.
This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the problem formulation
and puts forward the scenario about system model and game model. Equilibrium
analysis and game solution will be given in detail in Sect. 3. Numerical experi-
ment is proposed in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyzes related work in great detail and
Sect. 6 gives a brief conclusion.
2 Problem Formulation
In this section, we will introduce a scenario in the mobile edge computing. We
model the provider-user interaction as a leader-follower game. The leader, MEC
service provider, gives a fixed price for per unit of resources. According to the
price, followers, mobile users, purchase resources to maximize their profit, those
resources which are provided by MEC SP. Then, the system model and the MUs
competition model will be formulated as follows.

2.1 System Model
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a wireless network which consists of a SP and
multi-users. The MEC SP is a monopolist who sells a divisible limited resource
with a fixed price to multiple MUs. It can be regarded as a small data center
for telecom operators deployed near network access nodes, and also can provide
the services of expanding computing power and parallel processing tasks for the
surrounding MUs.
Assume there is one MEC SP, denoted by M, and Q is the number of units of
divisible limited resources. The set of all MUs is defined by I = {1, 2, ..., n}. The
SP maximizes its payoff by selling the largest amount of resources to users. And
user i maximizes its utility by purchasing resources from the supplier M. The
price announced by the provider (per unit resource) is denoted by p. We assume
that each MU is independent of the others and makes its best strategy only based
on its local information. Next, based on the price announced by the SP, all MUs
make their strategy of purchasing computing service resources qi to maximize
their own profits. In the real network environment, every MU i has resource
sharing or crowding relationship with other MUs. The congestion cost coefficient
determined by the resource constrains of the wireless networks is denoted by κi,
and κi ≥ 0. Moreover, the congestion cost coefficient approximately follows a
power law distribution, which is related to the amount of resources purchased by
other MUs. And Ri will be a concave function. Therefore, the revenue function
of every MU i can be computed as,
Ri = riqi − κiqi
2, (1)
where ri is the channel quality offset for the channel between user i and the
MEC SP. The bandwidth of each sub-channel is w. Each user has a transmission
power constraint Pi. We can define ri = w log2(1 + αiPi), where αi = h2
i /σ2
i w,
hi is the channel gain and σ2
i is the Gaussian noise variance for the channel in
[9]. Every MU has to pay for the computing service resource what they want to
388 B. Wu et al.
buy. For each MU i, the cost function Ci is defined as,
Ci = μqi
∑
j∈{1,...,n}
gijqj + pqi, (2)
here qi is a function of the provided charge price p, and j denotes all MUs except
MU i. The first term represents the network effect of its social group or the impact
of other users’ resources on it. The influence of user j (other users except i) on user
i is denoted by gij , and μ is the influence coefficient. What’s more μ ≥ 0. Thus, the
Ci is an increasing function of the amount of resources qi.
According to (1) and (2), we obtain the utility function of each MU i as
follows,
Ui = Ri − Ci. (3)
Thus, it is obvious that Ui is a differentiable, increasing, and strictly concave
utility function. When given the charging price of the SP, all MUs make a strat-
egy to maximize their own utilities. Due to resource constraints Q, each MU
can be considered as a competitor to compete for the limited resources. In the
above competitive environment, and we regard the resource purchasing strategy
as a non-cooperative game. The symbols used in this article are summarized in
Table 1.

2.2 Game Model
In this part, we formulate the purchasing resources game model G between MUs.
The game model is denoted as G = {I, Qi, Ui}. Ui is defined as the payoff
function of MU i. The formulation of game model G is described as follows,
Players. Each MU is one participant and there are Q participants competing
for computation service resources to maximize respective revenue.

Strategies. In order to maximize their revenues, each user makes a decision
about the amount of computing service resources to be purchased based on the
price announced by SP. The selection for MU i is qi ∈ Qi.
Payoffs. We denote Ui(qi, q−i) as the utility function for MU i, where q−i ∈∐
j �=i Qj is the selection matrix consisting of all MUs except MU i.
Because of the limited computing services resources, the resources request
quantities q−i is a decreasing function. q−i is defined as purchasing resources
request quantities of all the other MUs except MU i, i.e.,
q−i = [q1, q2, ..., qi−1, qi+1, ..., qn], qn ∈ [0,∞). (4)
In a competitive environment, each MU intends to maximize their own util-
ities, as shown in (5),

i=1
qi ≤ Q, ∀i ∈ I, (6)
qi ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ I. (7)
Every participant is selfish, since no player has any incentive to deviate from
it in this game model unilaterally, the proposed game model is solved by Nash
equilibrium (NE). From [10], the NE can be defined as indicated in below.
Definition 1. A quantity profile q∗ = (q∗
1 , q
∗
2 , ..., q
∗
m) is a NE of the purchasing
computing service resources requests game model G. If at the equilibrium q∗, no
player can further increase its profit by unilaterally altering its strategy, i.e.,
Ui(q∗
i , q∗
−i) ≥ Ui(qi, q
∗
−i), ∀i ∈ I. (8)
The NE has an obvious self-stabilizing property, enabling MUs at the equi-
librium to achieve mutually satisfactory and comparatively optimal solutions
without a biased incentive of users. This property is very important for non-
cooperative computing resource allocation issues, because the MUs are selfish to
act in their own interests and it can ensure our users’ status be stable. Then we
will prove that there is a unique NE in this game model G in the next section.
3 Equilibrium Analysis and Game Solution
In this section, we next study the existence of NE for the multi-user to purchase
computing service resources. What’more, we give the solution method of the
game model G. Game theory is especially useful in finding out how these users
interact and designing the best solution that no one wants to change their choice.
390 B. Wu et al.
Each user makes a strategy about computing service resources based on the
charge fixed price p announced by the SP to maximize their own incoming. By
solving the following problems, the optimal q∗
i can be obtained as,
q∗
i = arg max
qi∈[0,∞)
Ui(qi, q−i, p). (9)
Given the charge fixed price p announced by the SP, the MUs compete for
the number of resources requests, which is a non-cooperative game. We will find
the solution for this non-cooperative game in the following.
Proposition 1. (Best Response). Given the charge fixed price p announced by
the SP, the best response (BR) of each MU is the amount of purchase computing
service resources requests, which is,
qBR
i (q−i, p) = (
ri − p
2κi
− μ
∑
j∈I gijqj
2κi
)+. (10)
Proof. The best response of resources requests qBR
i (q−i, p) can be obtained when
the first derivative of Ui with respect to qi is 0.
∂Ui
∂qi
= ri − 2κiqi − μ
∑
j∈I
gijqj − p = 0. (11)
The second derivative of Ui with respect to qi is,
∂2Ui
∂q2i
= −2κi − μ
∑
j∈I
gij < 0. (12)
According to (12), we can know that every user’s utility function is concave,
since it can be guaranteed a global optimal of Ui. The optimal solution in this
game as mentioned in (10). �
From the proposition above, it is observe that we can get the solution about
resource allocation by the best response in (10). Next, we will prove that the
strategy is in equilibrium state. In the meantime, the equilibrium strategy is
unique and optimal.
Theorem 1. Given the charge fixed price p announced by the SP, there is a NE
of each MU in this competition game model G.
Proof. Let q∗ = {q∗
1 , q
∗
2 , ..., q
∗
n} be the equilibrium strategy of game G, according
to the (6), (7) and (10), there is,
∑n
i=1 q∗
i ≤ Q,
q∗
i = ri−p
2κi
− μ
∑
j∈I gijqj
2κi
≤ ri−P
2κi
< qmax.
Hence, through the above analysis, the strategy space is nonempty compact and
convex. Besides, the players I = {1, 2, ..., n} also are a limited set in this game
G = {I, Qi, Ui}, so the game G has a NE in [11]. In summary, the computing
service resources of purchasing game model has a NE for all MUs. �
An Effective Resource Allocation Approach Based on Game Theory 391
Through the equilibrium analysis about the NE existence above, we prove that
there is a NE in this game. It can be seen that given the charge fixed price
p, there exists a NE of each MU in the proposed non-cooperative game. Then,
how do we find this equilibrium solution? Primarily, we need to set the initial
values, and represent the number of iterations by t. According to (10), we can
get the best response strategy about utility of user. Finally, when ξ is small
enough, the BR algorithm can achieve convergence of the state and get the game
equilibrium solution. The details of equilibrium strategy q∗ can be determined
through Algorithm 1.

4 Numerical Experiment
To illustrate the results of the proposed game theory pricing problem, we sim-
ulate a scenario of one SP and multiple MUs with different parameters without
losing generality. The simulation scenario is described in Fig. 1. We set the band-
width of the provider to be w = 10 MHz. The channel power gain of the MUs
follows the Gaussian distribution in CN(μ1, σ
2
1), where μ1 = 10, σ2
1 = 1. And
then, the thermal noise power of the MUs follows the Gaussian distribution
CN(μ2, σ
2
2), where μ1 = 5, σ2
1 = 1.
In Fig. 2, we present a user-provider correlation with channel gain equaliza-
tion, where the link thickness indicates the number of resources purchased, and
shows the best response dynamic of the non-cooperative game for the three MUs
case and the relationship between number of iteration and utility of users. From
the figure, we can see that user’s utility increases first, then slowly flattens and
eventually would converge, and the convergence can be achieved quickly in non-
cooperative game. What’s more, the convergence rate has nothing to do with
the initial value.

Fig. 2. Convergence of the best response for 3 MUs.
Fig. 3. The average utility with respect to the charge price.
Figure 3 shows the average utility between MUs with respect to the charge
price. The value of μ can be set as 0, 0.4, 0.8, respectively. As we can see,
for different parameter sets, the average utility of MUs always have an optimal
charging price. We can find that with the price going up and the average utility
increasing firstly but then decreasing affected by the influences coefficient μ. In
addition, it can be observed that the value of the influence coefficient μ will
affect the solution of the optimal price, and by adjusting the price p, the average
utility can attain a state of optimal equilibrium. Besides, the higher the influence
coefficient is, the lower the optimal price is. The reason is that the smaller μ is,
the less cost each MU will pay. Then, they will obtain more utilities.

Fig. 4. The utility of MU i with respect to the number of MUs.
Figure 4 shows that when the strategy of purchasing computing service
resources change, the utility of a single MU with respect to the total number of
MUs. As the number of MUs increases, the utility of each user will be decreasing.
But the utility curve of the strategy q∗ is always higher than that of the double
quantity 2q∗ and half quantity q∗
2 . This phenomena conforms Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2. It can be observed that there exist only one NE in this game model.
This is attributed to the influence of limited service resources. It can be seen
that the q∗ is the optimal equilibrium strategy which could make users maximize
their utilities.
Fig. 5. The average utility of MUs with respect to the number of MUs.
394 B. Wu et al.
In Fig. 5, we plot effects of the average utility of users with different algo-
rithm, and we can see that the relation between the number of MUs and the
average utility of the BR algorithm and the average distribution algorithm. With
the increase of the number of users, the average utility of users obtained by these
two algorithms decreases gradually. But the average utility obtained by the BR
algorithm is always higher than the average distribution algorithm. This demon-
strates that the BR algorithm is better than the average allocation algorithm in
the scenario of this article. It illustrates that this conforms Proposition 1, and
Fig. 5 shows the superiority of the BR algorithm in resource allocation.
5 Related Work
Many previous works have researched about the recourse allocation problem.
And then, there are some studies on resource allocation by the computation
offloading in MEC. [3] aimed at the energy-saving problem in cloud wireless
access network, a non-convex energy minimization optimization problem was
proposed. Next, they designed an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. [4]
proposed the D2D-MEC technique to improve the computation capacity and
integrated both techniques to focus joint computation offloading and resource
allocation. [5] thought an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing Access
(OFDMA) based multi-users and multi-servers system. An energy efficient joint
offloading and wireless resource allocation strategy were proposed.
A new resource allocation mechanism based on deterministic differential
equation model was studied by [6,18]. They also considered the security defense
problem and stable operation of the MEC network system. There is challenge
that how to find the global optimal solution of recourse allocation. Therefore, [12]
investigated a low-complex resource allocation algorithm based on game theory,
which can achieve the global optimal solution. They also took the routing into
considerations. The stochastic optimization technique was applied to transform
the original stochastic problem into a deterministic optimization problem, and
an energy-saving dynamic offloading algorithm was proposed by [2] and [17].
There also have some works focused on the joint problem of network eco-
nomics and resource allocation. The seller provided limited computing service
resources, and the buyer makes an offer for offloading as required. A double auc-
tion mechanism with dynamic pricing was proposed by [7,8,16]. They solved the
problem of cost minimization to obtain the optimal dynamic pricing strategy
effectively. Simultaneously, they found the Optimal Solution to Maximize Social
Welfare which every participant could maximize its profit.
The others works used in the form of stackelberg game to model interactions
between edge clouds and users. [13] investigated a distributed method based
on price to manage user’s offloading computing tasks with computation capac-
ity constraints. [14] studied a pricing based cost-aware dynamic resource man-
agement for cooperative cloudlets in edge computing. Then, stackelberg game
theory was used to describe the interaction between user and edge computing.
Respectively, two algorithms were proposed for wait-time sensitive scenarios and
computation-intensive scenarios.
An Effective Resource Allocation Approach Based on Game Theory 395
[11] studied the cache incentive mechanism by using a stackelberg game app-
roach with the consideration of congestion factors, and the interaction between
two stages of stackelberg was analyzed. In addition, they also obtained the opti-
mal pricing strategy and the cache strategy and designed of an optimal pricing
algorithm. [10] focused on an incentive active caching mechanism in small cell
networks. Particularly, they provided a closed-form expressions of the storage at
the NE, and the optimal charging price was derived in a closed form.
Nevertheless, these works gave a few insights about resources allocation prob-
lem by the form of pricing in the MEC scenario. To deal with this issue, we focus
on the resource allocation based on game theory for one service provider and mul-
tiple users in MEC system. Besides, an efficient resource allocation algorithm is
proposed to achieve the maximum benefit of MUs.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we consider the joint problem of network economics and resource
allocation. We have proposed a MEC system consisting of one privately SP
and multiple MUs. Next, a new effective resource allocation approach based on
game theory in MEC scenario is proposed. In addition, we prove the existence
of Nash equilibrium by game theory method and design an efficient the best
response algorithm to solve this problem. The numerical experiment shows that
our algorithm is effective.
