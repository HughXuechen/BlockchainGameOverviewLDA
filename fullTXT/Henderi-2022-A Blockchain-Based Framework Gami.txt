Abstract—In the life of Education 4.0, information is very 
vulnerable to security. Assessment is an integral part of 
learning. In addition to attendance, assignments are the main 
point in determining the graduation of a course. However, 
there are some safeguards for student activity assessment input 
platforms, which are dangerous, and data leaks can occur. 
Taking advantage of its open-source, transparent, and 
immutable or immutable nature can help secure the various 
platforms used. The University's need for various information 
makes the application of Blockchain technology a very 
appropriate thing to use. With the use of Blockchain, the 
security of student activities is more guaranteed, and it is easier 
to control by the Lecturer Board. This study aims to secure 
student activities from forgery and fraud when inputting 
activities using blockchain technology. The framework created 
also uses gamification as something that motivates learning 
activities. The author has analyzed the security needed for 
activity verification in the form of levels on several 
applications, one of which is a platform-based application used 
for the Merdeka Learning-Independence Campus platform. 
The method used in this research is descriptive research in the 
form of a literature study that prioritizes gamification in a 
platform framework. The urgency of this research is to secure 
the Merdeka Learning-Independence Campus platform for 
students who need more security in their data storage. If 
security is increased, student confidence and learning 
motivation towards the activities carried out will increase so 
that learning motivation will be better so that the quality of 
learning will be better. 
Keywords—Blockchain, Gamification, Kampus Merdeka 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
In this section, we aim to improve learning innovation in 
the Era of Society 5.0 to become a call for educators to 
understand learning strategies by using and adopting, as 
well as developing various learning strategies for students 
[1]. The current generation that is focused on cyberspace is 
growing very fast in multiple fields. Especially the 
information used by various students also requires tight 
security. The Blockchain integrated into the learning area is 
a slick and applicable collaboration with multiple things that 
can work today; this is also known as a feature of 
Blockchain that also appears in various fields [2]. 
Implementation of Blockchain in this study refers to the 
learning platform and activities initiated by the Ministry of 
Education and Culture of Indonesia, Nadiem Anwar 
Makarim, especially Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka [3]. 
This is related to the Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka 
Policy; The Independent Learning Policy-Independent 
Campus is by Permendikbud Number 3 of 2020 concerning 
National Higher Education Standards. which will be 
discussed in the image below.

In Fig. 1 above the Independent Campus there are 4 new 
policies, namely:  
1) Autonomy for opening new study programs where 
both State Universities (PTN) and Private (PTS) 
have the autonomy to open new study programs 
2) The re-accreditation process is carried out 
automatically and voluntarily to the study program. 
3) The requirements for becoming a PTN-BH are 
made more accessible, the Ministry of Education 
and Culture will simplify the requirements for PTN

BLU and Satker to become PTN-BH without being 
tied to accreditation status. 
4) The right to study for three semesters outside the 
study program and changes in the definition of 
credits, students are given the freedom to take or 
not take credits (Semester Credit Units) outside 
their campus for two semesters or equivalent to 40 
credits. 
 
 Merdeka Campus, which was Nadiem’s initial idea, 
identified and analyzed student interests and design 
activities to be carried out. The display of the software 
platform used by students must create the latest learning 
methods to motivate students. One of them is adopting 
Blockchain technology in a forum. Blockchain is one of the 
most in-demand subjects in today’s many social, 
technological, and educational gatherings [4]. Blockchain 
was initially the inspiration for virtual currencies like 
Bitcoin [5]. In its development, Blockchain can be used in 
several fields, including gym maintenance, various 
document reports, and platforms [6]. Multiple approaches 
and efforts with the assistance of the authorities to increase 
the degree of enjoyable education in Indonesia are helpful in 
building the Indonesian nation. 
However, increasing student motivation towards lectures 
remains the main subject of this study [7] [8]. The lack of 
gamification on the platform and its boring user interface 
reduce student motivation in courses; this is a problem in 
research. At Society 5.0, the Ministry of Education, Culture, 
Research and Technology (Mendikbud Ristek), namely 
Nadiem Makarim, made new coverage in education, 
especially the Independent Learning Campus. The Merdeka 
BelajarKampus Merdeka has four rules: the addition of new 
study programs, a higher education accreditation platform, 
changing the name of PTN to PTN-BH, and what is 
discussed is the right to study for three semesters for 
international students. Study program that has been 
implemented. The four rules are regulated in Permendikbud 
No.3, four, 5, 6, and 7. In this study, when conducting 
education, a platform will be designed that educates and 
motivates students. 
There is three research questions for this research:  
• RQ1. What is a promising Blockchain technology 
framework for higher education in Indonesia?  
• RQ2. How can Blockchain be applied to improve the 
quality of education in Indonesia?  
• RQ3. How does Blockchain ensure the security of 
information entering and leaving education in 
Indonesia? 
II. RELATED WORKS 
In this section, the Blockchain has attracted attention 
because it relates to bitcoin [9], [10], [11]. Blockchain 
properties are decentralized, transparent, and 
irreversible[12] [13]. With a decentralized platform, 
Blockchain allows all participants in the network to 
demonstrate the power of computing to correct and secure 
transactions [14]. This is the reason Blockchain security is 
widely used, one of which is in education. Blockchain will 
authenticate transactions and be recorded in the public 
ledger, and every node on the network will have a copy, so 
it is easy to verify [15] [16]. Blockchain finally approved 
this ledger accountability by looking for the previous block. 
Block security and privacy are protected using consensus 
algorithms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) [17]. This study 
used two approaches, namely case study, and literature 
study to produce research evidence. With the recent 
emergence of Blockchain technologies such as Blockchain, 
qualitative methods present a pragmatic approach to 
engaging with current technology at an early stage. Case 
studies involving Blockchain in education take the form of 
pilot exploration and initiatives. The first step in our 
research is to review the literature published in the field of 
Blockchain technology applications for education. 
Educational-based application review of Blockchain 
technology used in digital asset methods to store, share, 
secure, and verify educational credentials. Desk Research is 
conducted on significant sources covering critical technical 
aspects of Blockchain implementation. In particular, Bitcoin 
and Ethereum offer specialized products built on Blockchain 
technology for their structure, arrangement, operation, and 
intellectual property. The survey will be conducted with a 
sample of researchers, educators, and students from relevant 
stakeholders in Blockchain education. 
Blockchain has four main features that support the 
development of Blockchain in the world of education today: 
1) Transparent: Blockchain has an evident nature; that 
is, all activities entered or carried out by a user will 
be recorded so that there is a transaction history 
that can be seen by other users [18]. 
2) Immutable: One of the features possessed by a 
robust Blockchain is Immutable or cannot be 
changed or modified. If a record or history has 
been Blockchain, the form will always be recorded 
in the system and cannot be limited to minimize 
fraud [19]. 
3) Open Source: Most Blockchain systems are open 
source. So the user can use the Blockchain 
technology and modify it according to the user’s 
wishes or needs. But users will not be able to 
change an existing Blockchain system [20].  
4) Immutability: Various transaction histories will be 
recorded, such as the use of credit scores. 
Blockchain immutability means security, 
maintaining integrity, and confidentiality. 
Blockchain immutability has immutable 
characteristics and is very strong. Cryptography 
and public keys using hash codes that are part of 
the Blockchain protocol are basic security. Once 
established, Blockchain immutability is unlikely to 
change. This feature dramatically increases trust in 
virtual transactions and eliminates the possibility of 
fraud [21] [22]. 
From the 4 main features of Blockchain that have been 
mentioned above, it can be concluded that Blockchain is 
very supportive of the security of the system used during 
education. Safe features and easily accessible sources can 
facilitate system management and make it easier for users 
such as lecturers and students concerned. 
III. METHODS 
 The qualitative research method used in this study uses 
two approaches, namely literature studies and case studies. 
With the recent advent of Blockchain technology, 
qualitative methods make for a pragmatic approach in the 
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 08:47:34 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
early stages of building a platform. Case studies involving 
Blockchain in education as examples and exploratory 
applications. The first step in our research is to review the 
published literature in the field of applying Blockchain 
technology to education and the application of gamification. 
 Various reviews on using Blockchain to store, share, 
secure, and verify educational credentials have been carried 
out by researchers worldwide. This includes user security, 
one of which is a student when conducting lecture activities. 
The safety of using the platform at the university can be 
overcome by Blockchain. Blockchain can provide security 
in various ways, but the aspect that will be carried out is the 
student view board, which will be seen every day during 
lectures. View board contains a lot of essential student data, 
including grades. So Blockchain is needed for data and 
platform security. Desk Research is conducted on critical 
sources covering critical technical aspects of Blockchain 
implementation. The survey will be conducted with a 
sample of researchers, educators, and students from relevant 
stakeholders in Blockchain education. 
IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
The results of the implementation of Blockchain 
technology are then recorded into the application history. 
The following discussion describes the implementation of 
Blockchain technology and the application of gamification. 
A. Blockchain Structure   
Each block in the Blockchain contains three elements: 1) 
Main data; 2) the hash of the translucent block; 3) the hash 
of the current block [23]. Main Data. The data depends on 
the type of transaction; this is generally a transfer between 
nodes A and B but can be of any kind, such as a money 
transfer or a record transfer [24]. Hash from Previous Block. 
When a transaction can be executed, the hash is generated 
and propagated across the network. There are several 
hashing algorithms used, but the most dominant one is the 
Merkle Tree. This algorithm allows easy hash options, 
which is why the Merkle Trees is a common choice [25]. 
Hash of Current Block. The last hash value is recorded in 
the header block (the current block’s hash), while the 
content itself is stored in the block body. Blocks are 
generally bound to a size to allow several transactions per 
block [26]. 
 
B. Gamification in the Student Viewboard of Merdeka 
Belajar-Kampus Merdeka 
Various activities that the Students have input will be 
recorded on the informative view board. The process of 
inputting activities carried out by students through the 
platform does not require a long time. This platform 
framework has used the gamification method where students 
who successfully input many activities during learning will 
get rewards in the form of ECP and an increase in Activity 
Level. Gamification is valued vital because it can affect 
student learning motivation [27] [28]. With the gamification 
method on the platform, the lecture process becomes more 
interactive. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Informative Viewboard based on Gamification 
 Fig. 2 Explain the Informative Viewboard based on 
Blockchain Gamification. In this informative view board, 
there are 4 (four) collections of information, including: 
1) Student profiles such as name, faculty, department, 
study program, concentration, and GPA are the 
main focus when viewed by the user. This makes it 
easier for lecturers and students to find information 
about other users. 
2) There is a Total ECP (Enrichment Cumulative 
Point), this is the main point in student assessment. 
3) The Total Quest contains the total assignments and 
lecture activities that have been done by students. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Application of Blockchain in Platform Framework 
 In Fig. 3 It is explained that the implementation of 
Blockchain is in the security of the student viewboard which 
contains: student profiles, student assignments, and student 
points or student assignment assessments. Total ECP and 
Total Quest affect the Level on this view board. This is 
supported by the increasing number of activities carried out 
by students, the more ECP they get, and the level will also 
increase.

Fig. 4 There is a line of gamification code using the 
Laravel PHP framework so that students who have input 
their activities in lectures will get a ranking based on the 
points earned and are named as Activity Level. There are 21 
Activity Levels in the framework created.

Fig. 6. Blockchain features in the Gamification Viewboard 
In this section, the gamification display board will be 
backed by its security using Blockchain technology. Total 
ECP and Total Quests that affect Level will be secured 
using a cryptographic code in the form of a Blockchain hash 
where there is a unique code that cannot be changed and 
imitated. This will eliminate the possibility of fraud in every 
activity carried out by independent campus students during 
the system. 
C. Evaluation Process 
In the evaluation process, conclude the answers to 
the three Research Questions as follows: 
RQ 1. What is a promising Blockchain technology 
framework for higher education in Indonesia? 
 
Fig. 7. Algorithm progress for student viewboards 
This research produces data that Blockchain can secure 
learning activities for students [29], including the security of 
personal data such as profiles, grades, and assignments that 
are very vulnerable to being hacked as shown above. With 
the application of Blockchain on the platform (in this study, 
it is still a framework), Blockchain can secure student data, 
which supports user privacy security so that the Blockchain 
can be implemented properly on the platform for higher 
education [30] [31]. 
RQ 2. How can Blockchain be applied to improve the 
quality of education in Indonesia? 
 
Fig. 8. Student Quest using blockchain 
By implementing Blockchain in higher education in this 
study, students use security on the platform that will be 
used. We can see in the explanation in Fig. 8. where 
Blockchain Features and gamification are unified. The use 
of Blockchain has data protection where user privacy will be 
guaranteed so that no one can change it. A sense of security 
will be felt by students so that learning motivation increases 
along with the use of gamification in learning. By increasing

student motivation, it can also improve the quality of higher 
education in Indonesia. 
RQ 3. How does Blockchain ensure the security of 
information entering and leaving education in 
Indonesia? 
 Blockchain ensures the security of information entering 
and leaving education in Indonesia in several ways. One 
example is user data, such as an assessment certificate that 
is not easily forgotten. Using a unique code on the 
Blockchain in the form of a hash with a block-to-block 
security system can also increase security. The nature of 
Blockchain has been described in related works on the use 
of Blockchain, such as in assessment certifications and other 
certificates [32]. 
 These three research questions have been answered in 
the results and discussion of Blockchain in universities in 
Indonesia. After the system is released and is no longer a 
framework, evaluation is to determine user satisfaction with 
the student task verification system using the System 
Usability Scale (SUS); SUS can find out the benefits and 
effectiveness of the system that has been designed through 
questionnaires distributed to students using the system. 
 In this study, we use ”Simple Random Sampling” to 
determine the implementation of the Blockchain framework 
to secure student activity. The solution formula makes it 
easier to choose the correct number of samples. We use 
Slovin’s formula as follows: 
n = 
�
(�� �.�� )
   (1) 
n = 
��
(� � (
��).(�.�) �)
     
n = 
��
(
.��)
    
n = 99.6    
  
 If you follow the Slovin formula, the sample results, the 
number of students (N = 320 samples) will produce a model 
of 100 students who will find it a more accessible and 
secure platform for students. 
V. CONCLUSION 
 This study discusses how Blockchain plays a role in the 
security of student learning activities, one of which is the 
total points or ECP (Enrichment Cumulative Point) for the 
activities of Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka students 
and implement them using the gamification method. In the 
Merdeka BelajarKampus Merdeka platform framework, 
encryption on the Hash Blockchain will be applied as 
security and gamification as a supporting platform to 
increase student motivation. Issues regarding the use of 
Blockchain technology-based educational platforms are 
discussed in research through a literature review. In this 
study, we support the development of Blockchain on 
academic factors. For example, the application of 
Blockchain cryptography proves that the information 
received by the student or lecturer concerned and or issued 
by the platform can be trusted for security. Blockchain 
authorization proves that students have permission to gain 
their rights through gated information. For future research 
suggestions, the proposed framework will be applied and 
adopted in selected educational institutions. 
 The results of the accumulation of ECP in the history of 
student activities are discussed in this study. The ECP 
accumulation for each student will be safeguarded so that no 
student is cheating. Various activities in the ECP will be 
verified, then recorded on the platform, and total points; this 
can be seen again as a reference for lecturer assessment. 
With the framework on this platform, both students and 
lecturers will trust each other to increase scientific 
knowledge or during lectures. 
 Gamification contained in the ECP based on total points 
will be applied to make students compete in doing activities 
and assignments and get the best results. A positive impact 
will be achieved for students, lecturers, and universities. 
Further development will be undertaken so that this research 
will have more value and be more helpful. Researchers hope 
that this research can develop globally for the success of an 
Independent-Learning Campus not only in Indonesia.
