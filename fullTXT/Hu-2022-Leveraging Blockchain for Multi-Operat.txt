Abstract—Wireless service providers (WSPs) are seeking coop-
eration to share both resources (spectrum, infrastructures) and
costs. In particular, cooperation is critical for vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) applications that value quality-of-service foremost. How-
ever, cooperation is inefficient without strong trust bases. Recently,
blockchain arises as a promising solution to decentralized trust,
owing to its transparency and immutability. Therefore, we propose
a WSP cooperation framework based on blockchain, which keeps
a shared ledger on resource utilization. In this paper, we first study
the WSP selection problem of vehicles by evolutionary game. Then,
we make the blockchain public to vehicles to maintain its decentral-
ization and enhance its security by crowdsourcing idle computing
resources from vehicles. To deal with the mobility of vehicles, as
well as to improve the consensus efficiency, we propose delegated
proof-of-work (DPoW) scheme, which introduces delegate nodes
for participating in the blockchain consensus on behalf of the
vehicles. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
optimization framework is further used to derive optimal consensus
parameters including block size, computing resource demand of
delegate nodes, and prices paid for vehicles. We conduct extensive
simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

I. INTRODUCTION
CURRENTLY, there is a tendency that multi-operators, i.e.,
different wireless service providers (WSPs), are starting
to seek cooperation instead of competition. Basically, resource
pooling, sharing, and exchanging can lead to both expenditure
savings and quality-of-service (QoS) improvement, under the
condition that the total amount of resources is fixed. Further-
more, scarce resources such as bandwidth, power, and base

station sites can be utilized more efficiently. As an important
component of the future smart city vision, Internet of vehicles
(IoV) is revolutionizing the transportation system by enabling
Big Data sharing among vehicle users, road facilities, pedestri-
ans, and transport management centers [1]. To satisfy various
data-rich automotive applications, e.g., autonomous driving and
in-vehicle infotainment, it is helpful for a quickly-moving ve-
hicle to be eligible to utilize the wireless access resources from
all possible WSPs, whose base stations might be unevenly dis-
tributed across different regions [2], [3]. In [4], it is demonstrated
how WSPs can cooperate by providing vehicles with multiple
WSP association choices. Sonkoly et al. implement a prototype
showing large-scale service provision via multi-provider cross-
domain orchestration [5]. Qian et al. propose a spectrum sharing
method among multiple WSPs to maximize the total payoff [6].
In order to realize the benefits of WSP cooperation, different
stakeholders need to manage common business agreements on
the cooperation process [7], [8]. For example, if a subscriber of
WSP A accesses the Internet with the resources of WSP B, WSP
B must be confident that WSP A will approve the subscriber’s
access record so as to let it happen. However, there lacks mutual
trust among WSPs. In recent years, blockchain has become
an attractive solution to enhance credibility among peers and
reach consensus on sharing resources [9], [10]. Basically, it is
an immutable digital ledger implemented in a decentralized way
(i.e., without a central repository or authority) [11], [12]. There-
fore, trust is actually established on the common ledger jointly
held by the originally untrusted parties, and cooperation can be
effectively realized. Okon et al. propose to use smart contracts
between multiple network WSPs and show the blockchain-based
agreement can provide high availability and seamless handoff
for mobile users [13].
In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled WSP coop-
eration framework for vehicular access. Based on the planned
driving path, each vehicle selects the WSP that can provide the
best network services through its base stations deployed across
different regions. An evolutionary game approach is adopted to
model the above WSP selection process and derive the optimal
results. The final selection decisions are immutably recorded by
the blockchain. In order to accommodate the dynamic nature of
vehicles, we design a dynamic blockchain architecture, in which
vehicles’ idle computing resources are utilized to enhance the
security of the proof-of-work (PoW) based blockchain network.
Since vehicles can freely join or leave the network, we introduce
a delegate node for each region. Only the delegate nodes are

allowed to directly participate in the PoW consensus process,
such that the performance of the blockchain can be guaranteed.
Meanwhile, each delegate node is in charge of collecting and
rewarding computing resources from vehicles in its region, so
as to increase the overall computing power of the blockchain
network. The key parameters regarding consensus, including
block size and prices paid for vehicles by delegate nodes, are
also set in an adaptive manner via the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. The
main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows.
� We propose a blockchain-enabled WSP cooperation frame-
work for flexible vehicular access. Specifically, a vehicle
can select the most suitable WSP and associate with the
WSP’s base stations based on its planned routes. The
association records are securely stored on the blockchain
and shared by all the cooperating WSPs.
� We adopt an evolutionary game model to find the optimal
WSP selection decision of each vehicle, which is clear for
displaying the trend of the strategies of the vehicles in a
distributed way under a satisfying convergence time.
� We propose delegated Proof-of-Work (DPoW) scheme,
which exploits delegate nodes to run the consensus process.
Participation of vehicles is delegated by these nodes, who
pay for the computing resources vehicles provide. The
ADMM optimization framework is further utilized to adap-
tively decide key parameters involved in the consensus.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the related work. Section III introduces the system
model of the proposed WSP cooperation framework. Section IV
presents the evolutionary game-based WSP selection algorithm.
Optimization of DPoW consensus is given in Section V. In
Section VI, we show the numerical results. At last, Section VII
concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Multi-Operator Cooperation Scheme
There have been many kinds of researches and work in multi-
operator cooperation for many services. As resources become
scarce, multi-operator cooperation in the Internet of Things has
gradually become an effective solution.
In the aspect of communication network, P. Luoto et al.,
in [14] focus on the system throughput when these operators have
similar traffic patterns. In [15], a non-orthogonal spectrum as-
signment scheme among operators is proposed using a matching
game framework and stochastic geometry by Sanguanpuak et al.
In [16], P. Luoto et al. propose a distributed spectrum allocation
algorithm using deep learning based on Gibbs sampling. Hossain
et al., in [17] propose a multi-operator cooperation framework
in RANs in a heuristic way.
Besides, there is also some research of multi-operator coop-
eration for IoT service in energy and power efficient optimiza-
tion. In [18], Oikonomakou et al. solve a problem of energy
trading among cooperative MNOs by adopting a bankruptcy
game and Shapley value method. Gambn et al., in [19] present
a multi-operator network scenario and discuss new approaches
towards their energy consumption and sharing patterns over time
armed with deep learning. And in [20], a spectrum allocation
and sharing scheme to minimize the power consumption among
multiple operators is proposed by Opadere et al.
In our work, we use the evolutionary game to complete
the bandwidth access process, which can share the bandwidth
resources from multiple WSPs. The dynamics of interaction
among the roles can be exactly captured by an evolutionary
game. In an evolutionary game, a player can observe the behavior
of other players, learn from the observations, and make the best
choice based on his knowledge, which is useful for investigating
the trend of the strategies of the players while adapting their
behaviors to reach the solution in a distributed way. Besides, for
the aim of describing the features of vehicle users in a more
accurate way, we also propose a unique scheme to take the
vehicles’ mobility into account. Through this scheme, we can
make bandwidth access method more efficient.
B. Blockchain Technology Application
Blockchain has become a very popular topic in recent years.
The concept of blockchain first appeared in Satoshi Nakamoto’s
work, and now the distributed technology is applied in numerous
fields including Internet of Things and Internet of Vehicles
because of its trustworthiness, traceable and immutability.
For instance, Kang et al., in [11] combine the blockchain and
the convex optimization to provide a charging scheme for elec-
tronic vehicles. In [21], Jiang et al. present a blockchain-based
internet of vehicles, which is used to transmit vehicle data, the
work classifies the data blocks of IoV based on blockchain for
IoV system. In addition, they also present how the nodes in IoV
could participate in blockchains network. Cheng et al. in [22]
propose a traffic control system based on blockchain. Li et al.,
in [23] show a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles advertising
communication scheme structure based on cryptographic princi-
ples. An energy-efficient transaction model for the blockchain-
enabled IoV is proposed in the work of [24] by Sharma et al.,
Pustiek et al. in [25] put forward a blockchain-based autonomous
selection of electric vehicle charging station, and Zhang
et al. in [26] propose a blockchain-enabled framework of IoV.
Besides, blockchain is also used in flying ad-hoc networks such
as the work by Tan et al. [27].
As for [28], [29], [30], Zhang et al., Liu et al. and Fu et al. solve
the corresponding problem by using reinforcement learning
or deep learning framework respectively. Zhang et al. in [28]
propose a blockchain-based dueling reinforcement learning ap-
proach used in IoV. The work jointly considers the trust feature
of vehicles in the blockchain circumstance, consensus nodes’
number, and the computing capabilities of the edge computing
as a comprehensive optimization problem.
Besides, for the security framework in blockchain, Aman et al.
in [31], [32] demonstrate the blockchain framework in internet
of vehicles. In [31], a mutual authentication protocol that needs
fewer authentication requests and significantly low overhead for
IoVs is designed to ensure privacy preservation and efficiency.
And in [32], they illustrate a decentralized and scalable protocol
and A reliable framework for via the blockchain public-key
infrastructure features and smart contracts in IoV. A dynamic
consensus algorithm that is suitable for IoV is also proposed.
The traditional blockchain framework usually has a fixed
block size and block generation time, which is not flexible

enough. Therefore, in our scheme, we propose a blockchain-
enabled structure and an adaptive block size scheme. As for the
consensus mechanism, we design a DPoW consensus protocol to
create a more robust network. In the DPoW process, we motivate
vehicle users to provide some extra computing resources with
the delegate nodes in their own region to help strengthen the
robustness of the network, which is a multi-leader game. Then
the winner delegate node will complete the block generation
work.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Scenario
We consider a multi-WSP scenario, where each WSP has
several base stations (BSs) deployed in different regions, as
shown in Fig. 1. The major roles in the system are described
as below.
Vehicle user: On the one hand, vehicle users in each region
require bandwidth resources. A vehicle user is a subscriber to
a specific WSP, but it can access the Internet via other WSPs
owing to the WSP cooperation. In this work, we assume that a
vehicle user always associates with the nearest base station of
the WSP it currently selects. On the other hand, vehicles are
equipped with powerful computing devices, so they can also
provide their idle computing resources to enhance the security
of the blockchain network. We use M to represent the set of
vehicle users, i.e. M ={u1, u2, . . . , u‖M‖}.
Wireless service provider: There are ‖W‖ WSPs (i.e. opera-
tors) in our scenario. The base stations of WSPs are unevenly
distributed in each region. Besides, we assume that the each
WSP has fixed bandwidth resources, which are exploited by all
its BSs. We use W ={wsp1, wsp2, . . . , wsp‖W ‖} to represent
the WSP set.
Base station: Base stations (BS) are operated by their WSPs
and provide vehicular access services. The bandwidth resources
of each base station are shared by all its associated vehicles.
We suppose that interference mainly comes from the other base
stations owned by the same WSP in this region. We use blk to
stand for the l-th base station of the k-th WSP.
Delegate node: The delegate node is basically a powerful
server deployed at the edge cloud in each region. On the one
hand, it serves as the information hub to facilitate WSP selection
in the region, and the delegate node is used to interact with all the
Fig. 2. The relationship of each role in our framework.
vehicles and base stations in the corresponding region. On the
other hand, it delegates the vehicles in the region to participate
in the blockchain consensus process. Besides, the vehicles can
support the delegate node by offering idle spectrum computing
resources for better security of the system. Delegate nodes work
in a decentralized way and ADMM is run on each node to get the
optimal consensus parameter values. Data stored on the nodes
are shared by all the cooperating WSPs. Delegate nodes are
denoted by a set AN ={an1, an2, . . . , an‖AN‖}.
Blockchain: We maintain the public nature of blockchain. In
other words, it essentially allows all vehicles to participate in
the consensus. The total computing power is thereby increased
by crowdsourcing from vehicles’ idle resources. Prices are also
paid for solving the PoW quiz. Actually, it is more like a dynamic
mining farm organized by the delegate node, which is introduced
to deal with the mobility of vehicles. And the relationships
among all the roles are shown in Fig. 2
B. Process of WSP Cooperation
In each region, at a certain time, the delegate node first
gathers necessary status information of vehicles and determines
the vehicle-WSP association by an evolutionary game. Each
association pair is regarded as a “transaction” of the blockchain
and is disseminated to all the delegate nodes. A fee is included in
each transaction as an economic incentive to WSP cooperation
and the corresponding blockchain. A valid block is formed by
solving the PoW puzzle after collecting a certain number of
transactions. The generated block is then propagated in the
blockchain network and will be finalized after it is validated
by other nodes. The winning node, i.e., the block proposer, will

HU et al.: LEVERAGING BLOCKCHAIN FOR MULTI-OPERATOR ACCESS SHARING MANAGEMENT IN INTERNET OF VEHICLES 2777
be rewarded by the total fees included in each transaction of the
block. All the delegate nodes jointly determine the block size
and prices paid for vehicles’ computing resources through the
ADMM. Clearing between the cooperating WSPs is based on
the immutable transaction data stored on the blockchain.
IV. EVOLUTIONARY GAME ENABLED WSP SELECTION
A. Bandwidth Access Model Based on Evolutionary Game
Method
In this section, we propose the bandwidth access scheme. We
divide the scheme into the following parts:
Population: The set of all users that subscribe to a certain
WSP is denoted as a population. Since there are ‖W‖ WSPs,
there will be ‖W‖ populations in our system.
Strategy space: Every vehicle user can decide which
WSP to access, the strategy space can be written as
S = {s1, s2, . . . , s‖W ‖}
Population state: In an evolutionary game, we assume that
the ratio of users choosing each strategy is expressed as
y={ys1 , ys2 . . . , ys‖W ‖}. Obviously, we have
∑‖W ‖
n=1 ysn=1.
Payoff function: The payoff function πsn is used to quantify
the satisfaction profit or benefit that users can obtain from a
certain strategy, namely a mapping from y to the payoff function.
We denote λwk
as the density of the base station of the k-th
WSP in each region in our scheme, and use λu to stand for the
vehicle users’ density. When each vehicle user has determined
to select and subscribe a specific WSP, it associate to a nearest
base station operated by this WSP. Then we define the expected
signal to noise ratio (SINR) γ̄j of these vehicle users at time t as
γ̄j= E

⎥⎥⎦ , (1)
In Eq. (1), P l
Wn
is the power transmitted by the l-th base
station from n-th WSP, σ2 is the power density of Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), we denote α as the path-loss
exponent.Dj
bln
(t) is the distance of the accessed l-th base station
of wspn (i.e. bln) and the vehicle user j at time t, and hl stands
for the Rayleigh fading effect.
The inteference in our model can be divided into two parts.
The first part is from the same operators’ other base stations, and
the second part of the interference is the white Gaussian noise.
Then we use the signal-to-noise ratio to get the expected rate of
the vehicle users R̄(t) by making use of the Shannon formula
as follows:
R̄(t) = E {Bj log2[1 + γj(t)]} , (2)
where Bj is the bandwidth allocated to the j-th vehicle user.
B. Payoff Function of Vehicle Users
Vehicle users are highly mobile when communicating with
cellular base stations. To better reflect the network service level
and estimate the link rate, we propose the concept of payoff
function of vehicles, which is based on the expected driving
path for these vehicle users.
Fig. 3. Illustration of vehicle expected driving path.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, in the evolutionary game, the vehicle
user j has his expected driving path Lj with his own speed vj .
For the aim of reflecting the mobility feature of vehicle users
more accurately, we adopt an expected driving path for a certain
duration instead of just a fixed position.
We assume that each vehicle user is firstly located at the
starting point of his expecting driving path, and we define the
time t = 0 currently. These vehicle users are driving along their
planned driving path. Firstly, they arrive at the first record point at
t = τ , and then at t = 2τ , they arrive at the second record point,
etc. We totally consider and set A record points into the model.
At the starting points of these vehicles, each vehicle estimates
his locations in the future time for the calculation of his payoff
function. The amount of record points is defined as A. Then
combined with Eq. (1) and (2), the average payoff function for
each strategy will be written as follows:
πsn = E

Then the mean user rate while each vehicle user j crosses
through these A record points can be depicted by the payoff
function πsn . For vehicle user j, the payoff function can be
shown as:

Eq. (3) and (4) illustrate the payoff function of vehicle users,
i.e. the vehicle users’ mean rate which is combined with the
information of present locations and future locations (there are
totally A+1 points). The payoff function described the commu-
nication condition of vehicle users more accurately, because of
the consideration of both vehicle’s current location and expected
driving path.
C. Replicator Dynamics and the Formulation of ESS
For the aim of describing the dynamical behavior of vehicle
users, the replicator dynamics is proposed in this section as
follows:

Fig. 5. The dynamics before and after the mutation of the population share

ẏsk = δysk(πsk − π̄(y))
= δysk(ysk −
′∑
sk
∈ Sysk ′πsk ′(y)), ∀k ∈W. (5)
In Eq. (5), δ > 0 denotes the update rate of strategy, π̄(y)
stands for the all populations’ mean payoff. From the replicator
dynamics, we can obtain that the percentage growth rate of
the population share of each strategy is proportional to the
difference between the strategy’s payoff and the population’s
average payoff. It can be illustrated as a natural selection model
in biology, and also as an imitation model in economics. [4].
Armed with replicator dynamics, we will be able to obtain N
first-order equations. With the assistance of the above equations,
each vehicle user could find the fixed point, and it is also the
evolutionary equilibrium (EE) point. If the state of EE is ac-
complished, each of the vehicle users won’t change his strategy.
And in what follows, we depict the definition of evolutionary
stable strategy (ESS).
Definition 1 (ESS) : The strategy ȳ is an evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS) for any arbitrary different population state y �= ȳ
if we have the condition in Eq. (6)
π̄(ȳ, (1 − ε)ȳ + εy) > π̄(y, (1 − ε)ȳ + εy), (6)
where π̄(ȳ, (1 − ε)ȳ + εy) and π̄(y, (1 − ε)ȳ + εy) is the av-
erage payoff in state of ȳ and y under the population state
(1 − ε)ȳ + εy with ε as a mutation constant respectively.
Actually, due to the complexity involved in calculating the
channel rates in Eq. (4), it is very hard to solve the proof of
the ESS. To this end, we seek to use simulation results (Fig. 5
and Fig. 6) to demonstrate the stability and convergence of our
Fig. 6. The dynamics before and after the mutation of the population share
with (λw1 , λw2 , λw3 ) = (4, 3, 6) and λu = 300.

evolutionary game. It is shown that for the proposed evolutionary
game, no one will change his strategy under fairness and stable
circumstances.
The operation of WSP selection algorithm is explained below.
The delegate node works as the information interaction hub in
the region. Due to the features of the evolutionary game method,
the algorithm has a satisfying convergence speed. Besides, the
delegate node in our model only needs to calculate the mean
rate of all vehicle users in his region. as for the individual user
rate of vehicles, it will be accomplished by each vehicle user
distributedly and respectively. Our algorithm can avoid large
complexity on the delegate node. In other words, the calculating
task is shared by all the vehicle users.

V. OPTIMIZATION OF DPOW
A. ADMM Introduction and Basics
ADMM is known as a parallel tool for solving large-scale
optimization problems, and it is also very excelled at solving
algorithms in a distributed manner compared with other convex
algorithm. The ADMM method also has the advantages of
fast convergence. So it is widely used to solve an extremely
large scale optimization problem [33]. In addition, the ADMM
method is proved that it is able to converge to the stationary
solutions if the objective function is convex and separable [34].
Even if for the non-convex function, the convergence of ADMM
can still be assured under certain conditions. In the consensus
optimization problem, we consider the case with only one global
variable, and the objective and constraint terms are divided into
N parts:
min
∑N
i=1 fi(xi)
s.t. xi − z = 0, i = 1, . . . , N.
(7)
In this model, every processor collaborates to develop a global
utility, and the constraint is the local variables should agree to
be equal, i.e. the local variable xi should all reach the global
variable z. And by deriving the augmented Lagrangian function,
we can obtain the resulting equation, which is shown as⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨

In Eq. (8), Lρ(x, z, λ) is the Lagrangian function, and the xi,

respectively. In the following section, we explain the solution
based on the ADMM method respectively. Based on the ADMM
algorithm, we solve our problem in the following sections in a
distributed way.
B. Delegated PoW Consensus Mechanism
We consider a PoW-based consensus mechanism [35]
[36] [37] [38]. PoW protocol is widely used in public
blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Etherum, due to the high-
security level it can provide. The protocol is a puzzle race, it
requires participating nodes to solve a hard problem called hash
puzzle, which will consume a lot of computing resources. The
probability that a node i finds the answer to a question, i.e.
pi_PoW , is proportional to the ratio of computing resources it
owns, as shown in Eq. (9):
pi−PoW (fi−PoW , F−i−PoW ) =
fi−PoW∑
j
fj−PoW
,∑
j
pj−PoW = 1.
(9)
Based on PoW, we further propose the delegated PoW consen-
sus mechanism tailored for the vehicular scenario. Similar to the
delegated proof-of-stake mechanism, the delegate node attends
PoW race on behalf of the vehicles in its region, as shown in
Fig. 4. The delegate nodes solicit extra idle computing resources
from the vehicles, who will be rewarded based on the computing
resource it provides.
After successfully writing a block onto the blockchain, the
delegate node will obtain an amount of transaction fee as a
reward for its work. However, the block may become invalid
(i.e., orphaned) due to the PoW mechanism. We can quantify
the block generation reward of delegate node i as
RG
i = ηG (1 − Porphan)R
B . (10)
In Eq. (10), ηG andRB
i shows that if an delegate node completes
the task, it will receive a ηG percentage of block rewardRB
i . And
Porphan is the orphaning probability. The orphaning probability
is influenced by the amount of transactions (block size) SB and
block generation time TG, We assume the block times follow a
Poisson distribution, then the orphaning probability can be given
as
Porphan = 1 − e
− ξSB
TG . (11)
The block rewardRB
i is divided into 2 parts, i.e. a fixed reward
Rbasic and a variable reward, which is determined by the amount
of the transactions, i.e. the block size. Therefore, we can model
the block reward as
RB
i = Rbasic + εi
SB
σ
. (12)
εi is a given parameter which is depended on the communication
condition of the node and the network, andσ denotes the average
size of a transaction. So the block reward for delegate node i can
be rewritten as
RG
i (SB) = ηGe
− ξSB
TG
(
Rbasic + εi
SB
σ
)
. (13)
In Eq.(13), we can see that the expression is comprised of two
parts, ηGe−
ξSB
TG and (Rbasic + εi
SB
σ ). When the block size SB
becomes larger, the first part will become smaller because the
orphaning probability of an extremely large block are usually
high, which decreases the utility. However, the later part will get
larger as the block size becomes larger since there are more profit
of transactions in one block, and vice versa. Then the problem
becomes a trade off optimization problem and thus the block
size become a variable that need to be optimized.
Let xik denote the computing resource demand of delegate
node i from vehicle k, and each delegate node will decide on
computing resource from vehicles in its own region, denoted by
xi = {xi1, xi2, . . . , xin}. And for convenience, we define X−i
as the computing resource demand of all other delegate nodes
except node i. Then we define the total computing power of
delegate node i as
xtotali = Ci

∑
j∈M

We assume that each delegate node i has an initial computing
resources which is denoted as Ci
init. Then, each delegate node
will have a percentage of computing power

since αi(xi, X−i) is the percentage of computing power, such
that
∑
i∈N αi(xi, X−i) = 1. ωij in Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) is
the probability of delegate node i to choose vehicle user j for
the computing resource purchase, and
∑
j∈M ωij = 1. For each
delegate node, according to incentive mechanism method [39],
we have
ωij =
bij∑
m∈M
bim
, (16)
where bij is the difference of the highest price pmax and the
marginal price pij . In other words, bij is also the motivation of
unit price decrease on computing service demand, i.e.
bij = pmax − pij . (17)
Combined with Eq. (16) and (17), once the value ofωij becomes
larger, the delegate node i will obtain the computing resource at
a lower price from vehicle user j. And it is reasonable that the
delegate nodes are more likely to purchase computing resources
from vehicle j when ωij increases. Therefore, this results in
price competition among vehicle users.
Given the pricing profiles of all vehicle users
P = {p1,p2 · · · ,p‖M‖} in a region, computing service
demand from all other delegate nodes X−i and Eq. (12), we
have the concept of the utility of delegate nodes, i.e.

Then the delegate node i will decide on its computing resource
need by finding a solution of a optimization problem, and we
write the optimization problem of each delegate node as follows:

(19)
Dmax in C2 denotes the maximum service demand of one
delegate node due to some budget and resource limitation. Smax
in C3 is the maximum block size limitation, which makes sure
that the block size does not exceed the block limit. Considering
the pricing of other vehicle users and the computing resource
demand of delegate nodes, each vehicle user j determines its
pricing profile pj while maximizing its profit. So we define the
profit for each vehicle user as follows:
ψj (pj ,P−j ,X) =

9: End
Accordingly, the optimization problem of each vehicle user is
defined as follows:
maximize
pj
ψj (pj ,P−j ,X)
s.t.C4 : 0 ≤ pij ≤ pmax. (21)
Combined with Eq. (19) and (21), it is a multi-leader (vehicle
users as providers in computing resources) problem, which
should be solved in a large-scale network. Therefore, we resort
to the ADMM algorithm to obtain the solution in a decentralized
way. For Eq. (11), since block size SB is relatively independent
compared to other variables, so we decompose the problem
into two parts for convenience, namely 1) adaptive block size
optimization and 2) demand and price optimization.
The overall DPoW optimization process is given in Algorithm
2. And the specific method of optimization will be illustrated in
the following sections. When the block is generated, it will be
added to the blockchain at each delegated node distributedly,
and it is traceable and convenient to search the corresponding
information for each vehicle.
C. Adaptive Block Size Optimization
In this section, we only focus on the optimization of block
reward RG
i (SB) in Eq. (13). Block size is a global consensus
variable which is optimized in each delegate node at a distributed
manner. So intuitively, we can introduce a local copy of SB , i.e.
ŜB = {ŜB(an)}, and then we try to make these copies reach
consensus. For the objective function, we use the sum of block
reward RG
i (SB) of N delegate nodes as the optimization goal.
In conclude, we can rewrite the adaptive block size optimization

The superscript tB is the number of iterations, and we can
find that (13) is a non-convex problem because of Ui, so we try
to find a sub-optimal solution by Newton’s method. Then we
obtain the updating of global variables and Lagrange multiplier

(25)
We update the global block size in Eq. (24), and update the

we give the stopping criterion of the iteration as follows:∥∥∥ŜB(an)

Specifically, the residuals for both primal and dual conditions
for delegate node n in iteration tB + 1 should be small enough.
εprimal and εdual are respectively the pre-defined tolerances of
the primal and dual conditions.
D. Demand and Price Optimization
In the following, we explain the demand and price optimiza-
tion based on ADMM. Since RG
i (SB) is discussed in Section
V.B, in this section, we will give a scheme on the demand of
delegate nodes and the price of vehicle users’ optimization.
Based on Eq. (19) and section V.B, we regard RG
i (SB) as a
constant in this section. Then the demand and price optimization

We regard the optimization problem as a two-stage optimiza-
tion problem, stage 1 is an inner loop for delegate nodes of
the ADMM based algorithm (the iteration process is denoted as
t), and stage 2 is the outer loop of the algorithm (the iteration
process is denoted as q). The specific illustration is shown as
follows:
Stage 1) demand optimization for delegate nodes: In this
stage, each delegate node i ∈ AN first observes the price pqij
provided by vehicles firstly at each iteration q, decides on the
computing service obtained from each vehicle to maximize its
utility ui(xi), and the inner loop is formed by delegate nodes,
they aim to maximize their own individual utilities to obtain
more profit, and each delegate node update its demand xi as
follows:

(29)
In the Eq. (29), t̂C = tC + 1 if i > k, and t̂ = tC if i < k. And
ρ > 0 is the penalty factor. Besides, the lagrange multiplier λ
has the updating rule as follows:

(30)
By Eq. (29) and (30), the delegate node will obtain the values
of service demand that can maximize their utilities in each inner
loop.
Stage 2) price optimization for vehicle providers: In this stage,
each WSP will adjust the values of pj by maximizing its profit
function by adopting ADMM in the outer loop as

Then the priceing profile will be transmitted to all delegate
nodes, which is a preparation for the next iteration (tC + 2 and

Theorem 1: The utility function of the delegate node i ∈ AN
in Eq. (18) is a concave function.

derivative of (18) with respect to xij , which can be written as

Then we take the second-order derivative ofαi, the Equation can
be expressed as Eq. (37), shown at the bottom of the next page.

In our model, the idle computing resources of vehicles are
used for the improvement of security. And to deal with the dy-
namic of vehicles, we propose delegated proof-of-work (DPoW)
scheme, which is an adaption of PoW (Proof of Work) and DPoS
(delegated Proof of Stake), and it introduces delegate nodes for
participating in the blockchain consensus. Each delegate node
is responsible for gathering computing resources from vehicles
in the region it delegates.
Sybil attack: A Sybil attack is a kind of attack that a small
number of entities counterfeit multiple peer identities to com-
promise a disproportionate share of the system. In our model,
as the same as PoW, for every individual who takes part in the
mining and block generation, essential computation ability is
TABLE II
VALUES AND ARGUMENTS
necessary for our model. Thus it is difficult for one individual to
manipulate several accounts simultaneously, which guarantees
the security in the Sybil attack.
Double-spending attack and selfish mining: Both double-
spending attacks and selfish mining make use of huge computing
ability to obtain some profit they do not deserve or disturb other
honest miners in the normal mining process. In traditional PoW
protocol, it is possible when some individuals take charge of
multitudinous computing ability. Nevertheless, The computing
ability is comprised of many vehicles in that region at that time,
which is extremely dynamic and variable. Thus it seems more
difficult for one node to have stable and numerous computing
abilities all the time. Besides, we add a protocol that is used
in conventional PoW to avoid the attack, which is called the
unpredictable deterministic tie-breaking method. It rewards a
random delegate node from the nodes who complete the mining
process if there is more than one node accomplish the assign-
ment simultaneously, which will destroy the motivation of these
attacks. Since the block generated by the node will not definitely
be admitted.
VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We evaluate the evolutionary game method for WSP selection
firstly in this section. Then, we analyze the DPoW optimization
scheme and analyze the security. Some main values and argu-
ments are displayed in Table II.

Fig. 7. The average rate dynamic of the proposed scheme and the fixed scheme.
A. Evaluation of Multi-WSP Selection Scheme for Vehicle
Users
The vehicles’ dynamic behaviors can be clearly depicted by
using the evolutionary game method. Firstly, without loss of
generality, we take a 200 m × 200 m square area as an example
to simulate. And we assume that there are totally 3 operators,
many base stations, and a lot of vehicle users. As for these base
stations, we assume that they are distributed in this region in
a random manner at the density of λw1 , λw2 and λw3 for the
BSs possessed by WSP1, WSP2 and WSP3 respectively. The
vehicles are distributed also in a random manner an intersection
with the density of λu. All vehicle users will subscribe to a
random WSP, choose the nearest base station of the WSP to
access firstly, and drive along their planned driving path. And
then the evolutionary game will be launched, vehicle users will
choose a better strategy that will provide the most benefit at
present.
The population state trend are displayed in Fig. 5 and 6. In
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, and the parameters are (λwsp1 , λwsp2 , λwsp3) =
(3, 3, 6) and λu = 60, (λwsp1 , λwsp2 , λwsp3) = (4, 3, 6) and
λu = 300 respectively. From Fig. 5 and 6, we obtain that the
EES (evolutionary equilibrium state) will be completed whitin
7 iterations. Satisfying convergence time gurantees that these
vehicle users will be able to access bandwidth with low latency.
Besides, we artificially added some system mutations around
the 15th iteration by changing the selection of WSP of some
vehicle users, as given in Fig. 5. The results show the robustness
of the system in that all the vehicles’ selection will return to the
original ESS.
Then, we show the average user rate between flexible multi-
WSP selection under the proposed WSP cooperation framework
and fixed WSP selection. Fig. 7 shows the dynamics of the mean
user rate, and we still can know that the convergence speed of the
evolutionary game is fast. Fig. 8 compares the mean rate with
different amounts of vehicle users. We can obtain that our multi-
WSP selection scheme always has a higher average rate. The
reason is obvious since vehicle users can choose the WSP with
better services considering the planned driving path. The band-
width resources are used more efficiently through cooperation.
B. Evaluation of DPoW Optimization
We demonstrate the influence of block size on the utility of
delegate nodes in Fig. 9. It illustrates that a larger or smaller block

different amounts of vehicle users.

different Tg.
size will lead to lower utility. Although larger block size means
more transactions and rewards, it also causes high orphaning
probability. Thus, the block reward for delegate nodes can be
optimized by choosing the appropriate block size. Besides, we
find out that the block reward of delegate nodes will become
larger with longer block generation time. It is because that the
longer block generation time will lead to a lower orphaning
probability for each block.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a WSP cooperation frame-
work where vehicle users can freely select WSPs for better QoS.
The evolutionary game approach finds the optimal user-WSP
pairs with fast convergence speed. The records are immutably
stored on the blockchain, laying the foundation of WSP coop-
eration. The proposed delegated PoW enhances the security of
blockchain without degrading consensus performance, by allow-
ing delegate nodes to participate in the consensus on behalf of
vehicles with the vehicles’ idle computing resources. Adaptive
block size and ADMM schemes are adopted to increase delegate
nodes’ utilities. In our future work, we will consider a more
flexible WSP cooperation framework by allowing vehicles to
freely select base stations in a cell-free and fully-decoupled
manner. Also, the computing power may be highly variable with
the number of serving vehicles. A potential mitigation approach
is to reserve computing resources at the delegate node so as
to maintain a minimal computing power of the system, which
needs to be considered in the future.

Fig. 12. The trend of the profit function of the delegate nodes.
Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the convergence of the adaptive block
size scheme. Fig. 10 shows that the block size will converge
to an optimal value within 4 iterations with different initial
block sizes (Sb0), demonstrating the effectiveness of ADMM.
A similar trend is shown in Fig. 11 concerning block reward.
Fig. 11 also shows the converged block reward is larger than
the initial block rewards.Soliciting computing resources from
vehicles is indispensable for DPoW. Since the profit functions
of the delegate node and vehicles are both concave, the ADMM
method is suitable. The leaders (vehicles) provide computing
resources at a flexible price and the followers (delegate nodes)
demand extra computing resources. Fig. 12 shows the trend of
the profit function of the delegate nodes, demonstrating a fast
convergence speed. The profit trends of the 5 recorded vehicles

are shown in Fig. 13, and we can also find the convergence
speed is fast. Fig. 14 shows the profits of delegate nodes with
different fixed rewardRbasic and under different schemes. First,
our adaptive block size scheme makes delegate nodes obtain
more profits. It is because optimal choices on block size can
be made according to transaction amounts and block generation
time Tg . Second, the delegate node prefers longer Tg , which
brings them better profits. However, transaction delays will also
be larger, which is not acceptable.
A. The Convergence and Complexity of the Consensus
Optimization
The performance of our ADMM consensus model is shown in
Figs. 10 and 11. We can obtain that the block size will converge
to a global consensus value within 6 steps. Firstly, the curve
varies very violently, and the trend after iteration 4 is extremely
slight, which verifies the quick convergence in our model. In
our simulation, we take the stopping criterion threshold in
Eq. (26) and (27) as 10−2. We obtain satisfying results from
the threshold which is suitable for this algorithm.
Next we analyze the complexity of our block size consensus
algorithm. Armed with ADMM, the distributed way in solving
the problem, we can obtain that each delegate node has the
complexity of O(Ipoly), I denotes the number of iteration, and
poly > 1 is a parameter which shows the polynomial complexity
of solving the optimization problem. Compared with a central-
ized manner, which has the complexity of O(‖AN‖poly), the
distributed method of our model has a simpler complexity since
the number of delegate nodes (about 20-100) is usually large
than the iteration (about 10-30).
