Abstract—With the increasing popularity of smart services and
applications, massive amounts of data generated in the cyber-
physical-social smart system (CPS3) have become a valuable
commodity. To make data tradable in CPS3 and guarantee the
data security, this paper proposes a blockchain-based data market
model to enable data trading between the CPS3 operator and
CPS3 users. The data trading mechanisms are formulated as two
kinds of non-cooperative games, namely, independent optimization
problem and competition-enhanced optimization problem. We
analyze the game equilibrium of the two problems and validate
the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Numerical
results demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed
scheme.
I. INTRODUCTION
Driven by the popularity of smart services and applications,
the concept of cyber-physical-social smart systems (CPS3) has
emerged [1]. Compared with cyber-physical systems (CPS) [2],
CPS3 further integrates human resources with computing and
physics spaces, thus enabling the coordination among cyber,
physical, and social world [3]. CPS3 focuses on enhancing
the intelligence of surroundings with user awareness by putting
humans in the loop of system operation and management. To
this end, massive amounts of data sets generated by CPS3
users become a valuable commodity for optimizing the system
decision making [4]. The data collected unintentionally or
intentionally by CPS3 users can be analyzed and learned to
generate valuable information or knowledge. In this context,
building big data markets is necessary for CPS3, where data
can be viewed as a resource to be traded [5], [6].
Even though there exist some studies exploiting data markets
in CPS or CPS3, most of them ignore the economic benefits [7].
In addition, the frequently used Internet-oriented data market
model in most of the existing work may not be suitable for
CPS3, due to the following reasons: i) CPS3 users want to
trade more data for higher returns, but meanwhile they also
face privacy protection and transaction security issues in the
process of big data transactions. ii) The data market in CPS3
needs to simultaneously achieve economic benefits to stimulate
more users to trade data and guarantee the effectiveness of the

traded data received by the CPS3 operator. That is to say, the
data delivery between the CPS3 operator and users through the
data market should be real-time, and the delivered data should
meet certain quality standards. Both above two aspects have
yet been taken into account in the existing CPS3 work [3].
To fill the research gap, this paper develops a novel data
market with data trading mechanisms for CPS3. CPS3 users
compete to make a profit by providing useful data to the
CPS3 operator, and the CPS3 operator refines these data and
optimizes decision-making. To guarantee the security of the
data transactions between the CPS3 operator and CPS3 users,
the presented data market is based on the blockchain technique
[8], which can be viewed as a fully transparent and distributed
ledger to support the data transactions in a verifiable and
permanent manner. To guarantee the real-time capability and
data quality, the average spectrum efficiency and data evaluation
function are introduced and analyzed as two key performance
indicators, thus ensuring the effectiveness of the data finally
received by the CPS3 operator.
This paper proposes two kinds of data trading mechanisms
for the presented blockchain-based data market. One is formu-
lated as a non-cooperative game-based independent optimiza-
tion problem to maximize profits for each CPS3 user. To pro-
mote the competition consciousness of CPS3 users and generate
more valuable data, we further formulate a non-cooperative
game-based competition-enhanced optimization problem. We
analyze the game equilibrium of the two formulated problems
and validate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equi-
librium. The trading process can be implemented efficiently
according to the analytical results. Simulation results are p-
resented to verify the effectiveness and the advantages of the
proposed scheme in terms of the total traded data amount, the
data quality improvement, and the total utility.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model including the market model, data model, and communi-
cation model is described in Sections II. Section III illustrates
the two data trading mechanisms for the presented data market,
which are formulated as two non-cooperative game-based opti-
mization problems. Simulation results are presented in Section
IV. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Market Model
As shown in Fig. 1, CPS3 users can be viewed as the service
providers to enable data support for the CPS3 operator through
the CPS3 data market. The data market here can be viewed as
some social platforms, such as crowdsourcing and crowdsens-
ing [9], [10]. Afterward, the CPS3 operator reprocesses these
data and provides corresponding services to customers. This
reflects the nature of CPS3: Humans as customers can enjoy
services through the modern high technology, and meanwhile
they as data owners/providers dedicate to serving the system
[3]. In other words, CPS3 acquires information from humans
and serves people with user awareness, thus enabling smart
services to become smarter [3].
To achieve this, the trading mechanism presented in Fig. 1 is
necessary. The core point of the whole trading process is: First,
the CPS3 operator receives service requests from customers and
then make requests to the CPS3 data market to collect relevant
data for optimizing service quality. Afterward, the CPS3 data
market asks the data owners for data support and gives the
optimal pricing strategy for data trading. Now, each data owner
can participate in data supply and determines the amount of
provided data according to the optimal pricing strategy given
by the CPS3 data market. Finally, the CPS3 operators acquire
the data from the data owners through the data market and then
provide corresponding services to customers. According to the
trading mechanism, the data provided by CPS3 owners need
to be evaluated in two aspects: data quality and transmission
quality.
To guarantee the transaction security, the blockchain tech-
nique acts as a distributed ledger to establish an autonomous de-
centralized trading platform for CPS3 users and the operator as
shown in Fig. 1. In order to ensure the integrity and authenticity
of transaction data, the blockchain-based CPS3 data market
can be initialized by the cryptography technique. Each data
owner is assumed with an identity ID to register on a trusted
authority agent and join in the system, and the public/privacy
key can be obtained by elliptic asymmetric cryptography with
an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm [11]. Transaction
recording is the core of the data trading process, and it can
be actually defined as a transfer of cryptocurrency value. All
transactions during a period of time need to be linked together
and stored into a new block by the miner. The recorded data
needs to be broadcast to the miner network, and once the block
is confirmed, these transactions cannot be changed anymore.
B. Data Model
In order to enable data trading in Fig. 1, it is necessary to
evaluate the quality of data generated by each data owner. Two
principles are introduced to define the data evaluation function:
i) A larger data size provided by data owners can bring the
1559

higher quality of services (QoS) to customers; ii) The marginal
utility should decrease as the amount of supplied data increases
[5]. Therefore, the data evaluation function needs to be defined
as a strictly increasing and concave function.
According to [5], the data evaluation function Fu(su) for
each data owner u ∈ U generating the data with the size su is
Fu(su) = 1− ηe−µ·su , (1)
where η and µ are the curve approximating parameters to
real-world data, and U represents the set of data owners.
Fu(su) ∈ (1 − η, 1) and can be considered as the normalized
value of the generated data.
The trading mechanism can be further strengthened by
considering a competition-enhanced optimization mechanism.
The income of each data owner not only depends on the data
quality it provides but also depends on the advantage of its
data quality over the data quality provided by all data owners.
We define the advantage as the competitiveness Xu(su) of each
data owner u ∈ U , which can be calculated as
Xu(su) =
Fu(su)∑
u′∈U
Fu′(su′)
=
1− ηe−µ·su∑
u′∈U
1− ηe−µ·su′
. (2)
C. Communication Model
To achieve data trading as shown in Fig. 1, it is also necessary
to evaluate the communication quality of each data owner. Here,
we assume that each data owner connects to its nearest trusted
access point by orthogonal frequency division multiple access,
and we evaluate their average spectrum efficiency to specify
the transmission quality.
Assume the path loss between the data owner u and its
serving access point is d−α
u , where du represents the distance,
and α is the path loss exponent [12]. Meanwhile, the Rayleigh
fading is denoted as hu following the exponential distribution
with the mean 1
τ . The achievable uplink spectrum efficiency of
the data owner u can be calculated as
SEu = ln(1 +
puhud
−α
u
σ2
). (3)
Here, pu is the transmission power of the data owner u; σ2 is
the power spectrum density of additive white Gaussian noise
where the interference is regarded as part of the noise [13].
Proposition 1: According to the stochastic geometry method,
the average spectrum efficiency can be calculated as
S̄Eu = E

ln(1 +

(4)
where λ is the density of the access points, the location of
which is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process.
Proof: The average spectrum efficiency is taken over the
fading distribution including the path loss and Rayleigh fading.
Obviously, the probability density function of the distance du
can be derived as
fdu(d) = 2λbπde

Thus, we have

(6)
Since E[Y ] =

P(Y > y)dy for a positive variable Y , we
finally have
E

ln(1 + puhux

]
=

(7)
According to Proposition 1, the transmission quality of the
data owner u depends on its transmission power, and the higher
transmission power leads to the higher transmission quality.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND OPTIMIZATION
According to the core principle of the trading mechanism in
Fig. 1, each data owner competes to make a profit by providing
data to the CPS3 operator. Therefore, the optimization problem
is a non-cooperative game to maximize the potential profits of
data owners such that more CPS3 users can be stimulated to
join in the system and become data providers.
A. Independent Optimization Mechanism (IOM)
We first consider the independent optimization mechanism,
where each data owner decides their provided data amount
without the consideration of others’ strategies. The potential
profit of each data owner contains two parts: income and
expenditure. The income is based on the budget and can be
measured by both the data quality and transmission quality, and
the expenditure is measured by the consumption to provide the
corresponding data. The problem is formulated as
max
su
Uo
u = BuS̄Eu · Fu(su)− (cusu + cppu)
s.t. : smin
u ≤ su ≤ smax
u ,∀u ∈ U
where Bu is introduced as the budget distributed to each
data owner. Since each data owner independently decides
their provided data amount, we assume Bu = B/|U|, which
indicates that the total budget B is evenly distributed to each
data owner during data trading. cu shows the unit data cost of
the data owner u to generate the data with the size su, and cp
indicates the unit transmission power cost for each data owner.
The constraint restricts the upper and lower limits (i.e., smax
u
and smin
u ) of the generated data volume for each data owner.
Proposition A-1 (Nash Equilibrium Existence and Unique-
ness): The Nash equilibrium of the formulated optimization
problem exists and is unique.
Proof: The first-order derivative and secondary-order
derivative of Uo
u are derived as
∂Uo
u
∂su
= BuS̄Eu · µηe−µsu − cu, (8)
1560

and
∂2Uo
u
∂2su
= −BuS̄Eu · µ2ηe−µsu < 0. (9)
Therefore, the formulated optimization problem is a convex
optimization problem, and there obviously exists a unique Nash
equilibrium strategy among the data owners.
Proposition A-2 (Best Response): The best response of the
formulated optimization problem can be derived as
s∗u =

smin
u , if ŝ∗u < smin
u .
ŝ∗u, if smin
u ≤ ŝ∗u ≤ smax
u .
smax
u , if ŝ∗u > smax
u .
(10)
where ŝ∗u = 1
µ ln(µη·BuS̄Eu
cu
).
Finally, for the independent optimization mechanism, we
obtain the optimal pricing strategy of the CPS3 data market
for each data owner as
P o
u = BuS̄Eu · Fu(s
∗
u),∀u ∈ U . (11)
B. Competition-Enhanced Optimization Mechanism (COM)
According to (2), the competition-enhanced optimization
problem is formulated as
max
su
Uu = BS̄Eu · Xu(su)− (cusu + cppu)
s.t. : smin
u ≤ su ≤ smax
u , ∀u ∈ U
where each data owner decides their generated data amounts
with the consideration of others’ strategies. Here, B is intro-
duced instead of Bu since the competitiveness of each data
owner can also be viewed as the data quality contribution ratio.
That is to say, multiplying by the competitiveness Xu(su) is
equivalent to dividing the budget B into different data owners
based on the data quality contribution ratio.
Proposition B-1 (Nash Equilibrium Existence): The Nash
equilibrium of the formulated competition-enhanced optimiza-
tion problem exists.
Proof: The first-order derivative and secondary-order
derivative of Uu are derived as
∂Uu
∂su
=
BS̄Eu·µηe−µsu ·
∑
u′ ̸=u
1−ηe−µs

(

Fu(su))2

and
∂2Uu
∂2su
= −
BS̄Eu·µ2ηe−µsu ·
∑
u′ ̸=u
1−ηe−µs
u′ ·(
∑

u′ ̸=u
Fu′ (su′ )·(
∑
u∈U
Fu(su)+2ηe−µsu )
(
∑
u∈U
Fu(su))3
< 0.
(13)
Therefore, the formulated optimization problem is a convex
optimization problem, and there exists at least one Nash equi-
librium strategy among the data owners.
Proposition B-2 (Nash Equilibrium Uniqueness): The Nash
equilibrium of the formulated optimization problem is unique.
Proof: Since ∂2Uu
∂2su
< 0, the objective function Uu is a
strictly concave function. Thereout, ∂Uu
∂su
is a strictly decreasing
function of su. If ∂Uu
∂su
< 0, the optimal solution of su to the
data owner u is the lower limit smin
u . If ∂Uu
∂su
> 0, the optimal
solution of su to the data owner u is the upper limit smax
u .
Otherwise, we can derive its closed expression from ∂Uu
∂su
= 0.
From Proposition B-3, we will find that the solution is unique
when ∂Uu
∂su
= 0. In other words, the uniqueness of the Nash
equilibrium can be achieved.
Proposition B-3 (Best Response): The best response of the
formulated optimization problem can be derived as
s∗u =

smin
u , if ŝ∗u < smin
u .
ŝ∗u, if smin
u ≤ ŝ∗u ≤ smax
u .
smax
u , if ŝ∗u > smax
u .
(14)
where
ŝ∗u = F−1
u (su) = − 1
µ
ln(
1− F̂u(s−u)
η
). (15)
Here, F̂u(s−u) can be obtained from (16). For clarity, we define
Γu =
µBuS̄Eu
cu
·
∑
u′ ̸=u
Fu′(su′). (17)
Proof: The best response can be derived from ∂Uu
∂su
= 0.
From ∂Uu
∂su
= 0, we have (18). After substituting (1) into (18),
the equation can be further transformed as (19). Therefore, the
optimal solution of Fu(su) can be derived as (16).
According to the definition of Fu(su) in (1), the value of the
generated data is at least 1− η. Accordingly, the best response
of su can be derived by the inverse function as shown in (15).
Since ∂Uu
∂su
is a strictly decreasing function of su, if ŝ∗u < smin
u
and we set su = smin
u , we will have ∂Uu
∂su
< 0. In this case,
the optimal solution to su is s∗u = smin
u , which is consistent
with Proposition B-2. If ŝ∗u > smax
u and we set su = smax
u , we
will have ∂Uu
∂su
> 0. In this case, the optimal solution to su is
s∗u = smax
u , which is also consistent with Proposition B-2.
Finally, for the competition-enhanced optimization mecha-
nism, we obtain the optimal pricing strategy of the CPS3 data
market for each data owner as
Pu = BS̄Eu · F∗
u(su)
F∗
u(su) +
∑
u′ ̸=u
Fu′(s∗u′)

IV. ILLUSTRATIVE RESULTS
In this section, we conduct extensive numerical simulations
to evaluate the performance advantages of the proposed data
trading mechanisms for the blockchain-based data market.
Unless otherwise specified, the values of key parameters are
shown in Table I. We compare the proposal with the scheme of
uniform pricing, where the CPS3 data market gives a uniform
price p instead of P o
u or Pu for data acquisition [14], [15].
In this case, the data evaluation value and data size can

According to the definition of Fu(su) in (1), the value of p
needs to make sure that 1 − η < Fu(su) < 1. For clarity,
we use the terms ’IOM’, ’COM’, and ’UP’ to respectively
represent the proposed independent optimization mechanism,
the proposed competition-enhanced optimization mechanism,
and the compared scheme of uniform pricing.
Fig. 2 illustrates the total traded amount of user data in differ-
ent schemes. The proposed COM can bring great advantages in
the total traded data amount when compared with IOM and UP.
As for IOM, the total traded data amount first goes up and then
deteriorates as the data owner number increases. Since each of
them will get a smaller budget when the data owner number
is larger, the willingness of each data owner to generate more
data has shrunk dramatically until reaching the lower limit smin

Fig. 3 illustrates the comparison of data quality obtained
by different schemes. In Fig. 3, the legend indicates the
performance difference between two schemes. The quality
improvement index indicates the improvement of data quality.
From Figs. 2 and 3, one can observe that the proposed scheme
COM has significant advantages in both traded data amounts
and traded data quality. In addition, the performance advantage
of it over other schemes is more significant when the total
budget B is smaller. The proposed scheme IOM also has a
certain performance advantage over the compared scheme UP.
Furthermore, as the number of data owners increases to a
certain number, the quality improvement index will decrease,
especially when the total budget B is small. Here, the reason
is actually the same as the reason for data amount attenuation.
Fig. 4 illustrates the influence of the transmission power on
the system performance. The total utility is defined as the total
profit of all the data owners, i.e., the objective functions in the
proposed scheme of IOM and COM. With the increment of the
total budget B and the transmission power, the total utility of
all the proposed schemes is increased. However, compared with
IOM, COM can bring a higher total utility, since it can adjust
the user budget according to the quality of data provided by
the data owners, rather than evenly distributing the total budget
B to each data owner.
Fig. 5 illustrates the convergence time of the proposed
schemes under the various numbers of data owners. The left
subgraph shows the convergence performance of IOM, while
the right subgraph shows the convergence performance of
COM. The advantage of IOM is that it can achieve fast
and robust computing speed under any total number of data
owners when compared with COM. The convergence time will
inevitably increase with the increment of the total number
of data owners. Besides, as for COM, the convergence time
decreases as the value of B increases; however, for the IOM,
the value of B has little impact on its convergence time.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper focuses on proposing a novel data market with
data trading mechanisms for CPS3, where we present two
non-cooperative game-based data optimization strategies. We
analyze the game equilibrium of the two formulated problems
and validate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilib-
rium. Illustrative results are presented and discussed to verify
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposal. Based on
the proposed blockchain-based CPS3 data market, some future
works could be pursued. The work in this article measures
data quality only in terms of data volume. In practice, there
is a certain possibility of data correlations between the data
sellers. To consider the data correlations, some relaxation and
approximation of data correlations are necessary.
