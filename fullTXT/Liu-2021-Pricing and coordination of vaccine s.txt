Abstract
Purpose – Vaccine safety is a major issue in the world. Blockchain technology is the right solution to this
worldwide problem. The impact of introducing blockchain technology on the operational efficiency of the
vaccine supply chain is unclear. Therefore, from the perspective of game theory, this paper aims to construct a
vaccine supply chainmodel consisting of a vaccinemanufacturer, a vaccine traceability service platform based
on blockchain technology and a vaccination unit to discuss its pricing and coordination.
Design/methodology/approach – This study analyzes the pricing and coordination of the vaccine supply
chain based on blockchain technology, compares the decision-making of fixed charge scenario and
proportional charge scenario and reveals the impact of blockchain on the vaccine supply chain.
Findings – Results demonstrate that the revenue-sharing contract can coordinate the vaccine supply chain
when the proportion of revenue sharing meets certain conditions. The fixed charge scenario is more beneficial
to the vaccine supply chain than the proportional charge scenario. The introduction of blockchain technology
increases the total profit, consumer surplus and social welfare of the vaccine supply chain. Therefore, the
operational efficiency of the vaccine supply chain is improved.
Originality/value – This study not only provides important support for enterprises to adopt blockchain
technology but also provides some guidance for decision-makers to implement scientific and feasible vaccine
supply chain management schemes.

1. Introduction
Vaccination is the most economical and effective means for humans to prevent and control
infectious diseases (Duijzer et al., 2018; Adida et al., 2013). Governments all over the world
regard vaccination as the top priority of public health prevention services. In recent years,
vaccine incidents have been erupting continuously, especially in China where many serious
vaccine incidents have occurred, such as the illegal operation of vaccines in Shandong in
March 2016, the illegal production of freeze-dried rabies vaccine for human use by
Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. in July 2018 and the illegal vaccination of 9-
valent cervical cancer vaccine in Boao, Hainan in April 2019, which had a great impact on the
society and attracted great attention from the state. How to strengthen vaccine management,
ensure the safety of vaccination and provide efficient services for the masses is a hot topic

concerned by the people and governments of all countries. With the continuous development
of blockchain technology, its application in the vaccine supply chain has become a reality.
In the vaccine supply chain, vaccines are faced with various security risks such as
changing the real source of reagents, certificates or processes (Apte and Petrovsky, 2016);
changing quality documents, testing protocols and/or contracts; making false invoices; and
not sharing information among systems (Haq and Esuka, 2018). Since every link in the drug
supply chain plays a vital role in drug safety (Tseng et al., 2018), improving the drug supply
chain management is the most direct and comprehensive way to solve drug safety problems.
The same is true for vaccines.
Nowadays, with the continuous development and practice of blockchain technology, its
application scope is getting wider and wider. Blockchain technology has become an effective
solution to the drugs (including vaccines) supply chain management and security problems
(Haq and Esuka, 2018). For example, the US Food and Drug Administration started to use
blockchain to track prescription drugs in March 2017. In May 2017, a group of companies led
by pharmaceutical giants Genentech and Pfizer announced the MediLedger project, which
aims to create a blockchain tool for managing the drug supply chain, so that pharmaceutical
manufacturers, wholesalers, hospitals and other relevant institutions can use the blockchain
to register all drug-related information and ensure its traceability to the maximum extent. On
July 30, 2018, Henan Ziyun Cloud Computing Co., Ltd. officially released the vaccine
traceability and anti-counterfeiting platform based on blockchain technology. Through this
platform, we can ensure that the information of vaccine production, quality inspection,
storage, delivery, circulation, vaccination and other aspects is true and effective and cannot
be tampered with. At the same time, we can also make the data traceable, increase the cost of
data fraud and make the use of vaccines safer.
All indications show that blockchain, as an emerging technologywith strong development
potential, has been applied in the vaccine supply chain, trying to escort the safe circulation of
vaccines. However, the impact of the introduction of blockchain technology on the
operational efficiency of the vaccine supply chain remains unknown. It is very important and
necessary to study this problem. This paper attempts to explore this issue by constructing a
game model of the vaccine supply chain based on blockchain technology.
Although blockchain technology has been introduced into the vaccine supply chain by
enterprises or institutions to ensure the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, the existing
research is very limited, and there are still many problems to be paid attention to and solved.
Therefore, based on the current situation of the combination of the vaccine supply chain and
blockchain technology platform/system, we build a game model to discuss the pricing and
coordination of the vaccine supply chain supported by blockchain technology, analyze the
impact of different charging strategies on the supply chain and provide some management
enlightenment.
Specifically, we mainly discussed the following questions:
(1) How to achieve equilibrium in the vaccine supply chain in the basic model? What is
the relationship between the equilibrium solution and the main parameters? What is
the relationship between the total profit of the vaccine supply chain, the total
consumer surplus and the social welfare under different decision-making situations
(centralized and decentralized)?
(2) Can the widely used cost-sharing contract and revenue-sharing contract achieve the
vaccine supply chain coordination based on blockchain technology? If yes, what are
the conditions for achieving coordination?
(3) Compared with the fixed charge scenario of vaccine traceability service platform,
what are the vaccine price, total profit of supply chain and total consumer surplus
Pricing and
coordination of

2097
under the proportional charge scenario? Which scenario is better for the vaccine
supply chain?
Using game theory to analyze these problems, the main results are as follows. In the basic
model, there are equilibrium solutions in both centralized and decentralized decision-making.
Moreover, the total profit of the supply chain under the centralized decision-making is always
no less than that under the decentralized decision-making, and the total consumer surplus
and the social welfare under the centralized decision-making is always greater than that
under the decentralized decision-making. In both cases, the optimal selling price of the
vaccine is related to the service cost of the vaccine traceability service platform to unit
vaccine. The cost-sharing contract cannot realize the coordination of the vaccine supply chain
based on the blockchain technology. When the proportion of revenue sharing meets certain
conditions, the revenue-sharing contract can coordinate the vaccine supply chain. Compared
with the fixed charge scenario, the total profit of the supply chain obtained by adopting the
proportional charge strategy in the vaccine traceability service platform is less, and the total
consumer surplus and the social welfare is also lower. Therefore, the fixed charge scenario is
more beneficial to the vaccine supply chain than the proportional charge scenario. But which
scenario to choose depends on the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain.
This paper is the first one to analyze the pricing and coordination strategy of the vaccine
supply chain based on blockchain technology and to deeply explore the value and impact of
blockchain technology in the vaccine supply chain through the model. This study not only
provides important support for enterprises to adopt blockchain technology from an economic
perspective but also provides some guidance for decision-makers to implement a scientific
and feasible vaccine supply chain management scheme. Simultaneously, the research results
have some contribution to the future literature research.
2. Related literature
2.1 Safety management of vaccine supply chain
Vaccine safety concerns public health and national security. Vaccine safety management is
the primary task in vaccine supply chain management. In the traditional vaccine
management, vaccines are supervised by the government regulatory authorities (Chen
et al., 2015). In this case, the regulatory authorities test vaccines by random sampling to
ensure their safety. However, the management of vaccine information is centralized. When
companies find that vaccine information is harmful to themselves, they will tamper with it
(Abeyratne and Monfared, 2016). Therefore, this method is not very effective in solving the
vaccine safety problem. In addition, falsified vaccine information greatly increases the
difficulty of traceability and accountability of fake vaccines by regulatory authorities. To
reduce the risk of vaccine deterioration and failure, Dhandapani and Uthayakumar (2019)
proposed an economic order quantity model based on mathematical principles to find the
optimal vaccine replenishment time. However, this model has no effect on the vaccine
deterioration caused by humans. With the development of information technology, some
advanced technologies have been applied to the vaccine supply chain management. For
example, in order to realize drug tracking, barcode scanning systems or radio frequency
identification technology has been applied to the drug supply chain in a relatively mature
way (Sarac et al., 2010). However, drug counterfeiting still occurs. Some vaccine management
problems, such as false records in production and closed information in circulation, still
plague enterprises and public sectors. Once the problem vaccine enters the market, it will
result in a serious threat to public health and cause great harm to society. Blockchain
technology can solve these safety problems in the vaccine supply chain management. In this
paper, the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain technology is introduced
INTR
31,6
2098
into the vaccine supply chain to discuss, which is completely different from the previous
studies.
2.2 Pricing and coordination of vaccine supply chain
At present, some scholars have researched the vaccine supply chain model. Chick et al. (2008)
first proposed a coordination model of influenza vaccine supply chain from the perspective of
operation management and found that the designed cost-sharing contract could realize a
global optimization of the supply chain. Arifo�glu et al. (2012) discussed the influence of
consumption externality and yield uncertainty on the influenza vaccine supply chain. They
found that the government could improve the effectiveness of the supply chain by
intervening on the supply side or the demand side. Adida et al. (2013) studied the decision-
making problem of the vaccine supply chain with uncertain supplier output and negative
consumer network effect and pointed out that the government subsidy mechanism could
improve vaccine coverage. Huang et al. (2015) explored the pricing and coordination of the
vaccine supply chain under uncertain output and believed that the shortage penalty and cost-
sharing contract could realize the perfect coordination of the influenza vaccine supply chain.
Sun et al. (2019) discussed the risk problems in the vaccine supply chain and found that using
Shapley value method, analytic network process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
method can realize reasonable profit distribution between the vaccine manufacturer and the
retailer. The above literature studied the vaccine supply chain from the perspective of model
construction but did not involve the application of blockchain technology in the vaccine
supply chain. This paper proposes to establish a model to study the pricing and coordination
strategy of the vaccine supply chain under blockchain technology.
2.3 Blockchain technology
In 2008, Nakamoto introduced bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008). Since then, “blockchain” has
gradually entered people’s field of vision and developed rapidly in recent years. Blockchain is
a publicly accessible distributed database that never be changed or tampered with (Hofmann
et al., 2018; Saberi et al., 2018). It can ensure the high integrity of all transactions on the block.
By deploying a transparent consensus mechanism, blockchain can ensure the validity of the
transactions executed (Bocek and Stiller, 2018) and eliminate the control role of third parties
or intermediaries on the system. Since the information of all participants in the blockchain
network is transparent, the malicious activities of participants are prevented.
At present, blockchain technology has been applied in many fields such as finance (Guo
and Liang, 2016), logistics (Li et al., 2019), agriculture (Kamilaris et al., 2019) and food (Galvez
et al., 2018) and is expanding to other fields. Supply chain management is a promising
application field of blockchain (Kamble et al., 2019). Some scholars have analyzed the
application and value of blockchain in supply chain management. Longo et al. (2019) showed
through an experimental study that blockchain technology could not only overcome the
problems of cooperation and trust in the supply chain, improve the overall performance of the
supply chain, minimize the negative impact of information asymmetry on supply chain
members but also prevent any improper behavior of enterprises, such as data fraud or low
data accuracy. Liu and Li (2020) constructed a cross-border e-commerce supply chain
framework based on blockchain to solve the traceability of products and transactions.
Andoni et al. (2017) proposed to use decentralization and traceability of blockchain
technology for controlling the energy supply. Min (2019) discussed how to use blockchain
technology to enhance the flexibility of supply chain when risk and uncertainty increase.
Wang et al. (2018) built a supply chain management system based on the blockchain to
discuss the feasibility of applying blockchain technology in the vendor-managed inventory
mode supply chain. Leng et al. (2018) studied the application of blockchain in the agricultural
Pricing and
coordination of

supply chain and proposed a dual chain structure of agricultural commercial resource
blockchain. Choi (2019) analyzed the application of blockchain technology in the diamond
supply chain. Choi et al. (2020) discussed the impact of introducing blockchain technology
into the rental service platform on product information disclosure. The above research shows
that blockchain has been applied in supply chain management. Different from the above
studies, this paper focuses on the vaccine supply chain.
2.4 Blockchain technology and vaccine supply chain
With the expansion of blockchain applications and the increasingly prominent vaccine
problems, some researchers are considering establishing transparent data transactions in the
human medical industry to prevent counterfeit vaccines from entering the supply chain
(Taylor et al., 2019). Haq and Esuka (2018) proposed to build a vaccine supply chain system
based on blockchain technology to improve vaccines safety. Thomason (2017) pointed out
that when fake vaccines are prevalent, vaccinators can use blockchain to confirmwhether the
vaccines are true or not. At present, there have been literature studies on the blockchain-
based vaccine supply chain system. Tseng et al. (2018) built a drug supply chain monitoring
network through the G-coin blockchain system, which allowed all participants in the drug
supply chain to participate in the supervision for preventing counterfeit drugs. Yong et al.
(2020) developed a vaccine blockchain system based on blockchain and machine learning
technology to solve the problems of expired vaccines and fraudulent vaccine record in the
vaccine supply chain. Wu and Lin (2019) proposed a drug recall service system based on
blockchain to improve system transparency and protect data integrity in drug recall.
It can be seen from the above research that most of the existing literature focus on the
theoretical significance of blockchain in the vaccine supply chain and the construction of
the vaccine supply chain system based on blockchain technology. In fact, in order to solve the
vaccine problem, some enterprises have started to implement it. For example, JD Digits
Intelligent VaccineManagement System has been put into operation sinceMarch 2019. In this
paper, we discuss the application of blockchain in the vaccine supply chain. The pricing and
coordination mechanism of the vaccine supply chain are investigated in detail after the
introduction of the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain technology. The
specific research content is different from the existing literature.
3. Basic model: fixed charge (FC) scenario
3.1 Problem description and model building
Consider a vaccine supply chain consisting of a vaccine manufacturer (M), a vaccination unit
(U) (e.g., centers for disease control and prevention, epidemic prevention stations, hospitals
setting up vaccination spots, etc.) and a vaccine traceability service platform based on
blockchain technology (BVP). The M is responsible for vaccine production and sale. The U
buys vaccines from the M and sells them to vaccinators at a certain price. The BVP is a
service provider of blockchain technology. It uses blockchain technology to link the vaccine
manufacturer, the vaccination unit, consumers and regulatory authorities to realize
traceability data sharing, which is safe, reliable and win-win. Relying on the system, the
vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit can trace the whole process information from
vaccine production to vaccination, which effectively solve the problems of unreliable tracing
and difficult channel control. It is simple and convenient for vaccinators to check the
authenticity and production source of the vaccine for free through mobile devices.
In the blockchain-based vaccine supply chain, the M can assign a unique identification
number to each vaccine, including its identification, storage temperature, shelf life and other
parameter information. At each stage of the supply chain, participants can write vaccine
INTR
31,6

circulation information into the blockchain by using identification codes.When an authorized
node conducts a “transaction” with another node, the two nodes will reach a unified protocol
and digital signature. Before vaccination, consumers can check the accurate information of
vaccine flow through the blockchain platform.
Different from the traditional vaccine supply chain, smart contracts are signed between
members in the blockchain-based vaccine supply chain. Smart contract is a new technology,
which can automatically negotiate, fulfill and enforce the terms of the agreement in the
blockchain environment. It is digital, stored in the blockchain and uses encrypted code to
execute the protocol. From the signing of the contract to the end of the performance, there are
blocks, which are connected in time stamp order to form a complete blockchain. In this paper,
the manufacturer and the vaccination unit complete all transaction processes such as smart
contract signing, execution and fund payment on theBVP, which ensures that all information
and transactions in the supply chain are transparent, traceable and unchangeable and
improves the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
Assume that the unit production cost of the vaccine manufacturer is cM, the wholesale
price of the vaccine is w, the selling price of the vaccination unit is p, and the unit cost of
vaccination service provided by the vaccination unit for consumers is cU, where
p > w > cM > 0, p � w > cU > 0. There are two common ways of making profit for the
BVP. One is fixed charge (FC), that is, in a certain time interval, fixed fees are charged toM
and U, which are FM and FU, respectively. The other is proportional charge (PC), that is,
according to the income of the manufacturer and the vaccination unit at a certain time or
period, the expenses are drawn by proportion w1 (0 < w1 < 1) andw2 (0 <w2 < 1), respectively.
In this paper, the pricing and coordination strategies of the vaccine supply chain are analyzed
by using the first charging method in the basic model. In the extended model, the pricing
choice of supply chain members when charging by proportion is discussed and compared
with the FC.
Suppose that in a given time period, the number of potential vaccinators from the U is n,
and the perceived value of vaccinators to the vaccine is v, which follows the distribution of
f(v). According to the existing literature, in order to improve the operability of the analysis, in
this paper, we assume that f (v) obeys the uniform distribution on (0,1). The time and effort
taken by vaccinators to find and test the vaccine before vaccination is t (t > 0), and the unit
negative effect was γ (γ > 0). The vaccinators may have side effects by vaccination itself,
which is indicated by θ (θ > 0). The positive effect of vaccine on the vaccinator is s (s> 0). For
example, through vaccination, the possibility of infection or illness of the vaccinator is
reduced or avoided. Therefore, the consumer utility u of the vaccinator can be expressed as:
u 5 v � p � tγ � θþs. When u > 0, vaccinators will choose to vaccinate. Therefore, the
number of people who finally choose to vaccinate, that is, the vaccine demand function d is
shown as follows:
d ¼ n
Z 1
pþtγþθ−s
f ðvÞdv ¼ nð1� p� tγ � θ þ sÞ: (1)
It is noteworthy that vaccinators can log in to the vaccine traceability service platform based
on blockchain technology to view all the information of the vaccine for free before
vaccination, so as to ensure the safety and effectiveness of vaccination. It can be considered
that the vaccines vaccinated by consumers under such circumstances are safe. Therefore, d is
the number of effective vaccines of the vaccination unit. When the vaccinator finds that the
vaccine to be vaccinated has expired, is ineffective or has other safety problems, he or she will
not choose to vaccinate and will continue to search for and verify other vaccines until an
effective vaccine is found. Assume that the proportion of vaccines identified as having
problems is λ (λ > 0), the number of vaccines with problems in the vaccination unit can be
Pricing and
coordination of

expressed as λd. Therefore, the total amount of vaccines purchased by the vaccination unit
from the vaccine manufacturer is d þ λd.
According to the above description and assumptions, the profits of theM, the U and the
BVP are as follows:
ΠFC
M ¼ ðw� cM Þð1þ λÞd � FM ; (2)
ΠFC
U ¼ ðp� cU Þd � wð1þ λÞd � FU ; (3)
ΠFC
BVP ¼ FM þ FU � csð1þ λÞd; (4)
where cs is the service cost of the vaccine traceability service platform to unit vaccine, cs > 0.
Besides, we also discuss the total consumer surplus CS and social welfare SW in the
market, which are expressed as follows, respectively:
CSFC ¼ n

BVP þ CSFS : (6)
3.2 Centralized decision-making (C)
In centralized decision-making, each member of the supply chain makes decisions with the
goal of maximizing the overall profit of the supply chain. According to equations (2)–(4), the
total profit of the vaccine supply chain is
ΠFC ¼ ΠFC
M þ ΠFC
U þ ΠFC
BVP ¼ ðp� cU Þd � ðcM þ csÞð1þ λÞd: (7)
Proposition 1. In the case of centralized decision-making, there are:
(a) The optimal selling price of the vaccination unit is
pðFC−CÞ* ¼ 1� tγ � θ þ sþ cU þ ð1þ λÞðcM þ csÞ

(b) The optimal profit of the vaccine supply chain is

(c) The consumer surplus is

(d) The social welfare is

ð1� tγ � θ þ s� cU � ð1þ λÞðcM þ csÞÞ2: (11)
INTR

See Appendix A1 for the process of Proposition 1. Then, we discuss the influence of each
parameter on the optimal solution.
Proposition 2. In the case of centralized decision-making, we have
(a) vpðFC−CÞ*
vt

vλ > 0; vpðFC−CÞ*
vcs

(d) vSW ðFC−CÞ*
vt
< 0; vSW ðFC−CÞ*
vλ < 0; vSW ðFC−CÞ*
vcs
< 0:
Proposition 2(a) shows that the optimal selling price of the vaccine is inversely proportional to
t under centralized decision-making. This is because the larger t is, the more time and effort it
takes for vaccinators to find and test the vaccine, and the greater the cost for consumers to
vaccinate. To meet consumers’ vaccination expectations, the optimal selling price of the
vaccine will be reduced. pðFC−CÞ* is in direct proportion to λ and cs. This is because the larger
the λ (cs) is, the greater the marginal cost of the vaccine supply chain is. To maximize the
overall profit, the selling price will be increased. From Propositions 2(b) to (d), it can be seen
that the optimal profit, total consumer surplus and social welfare of the vaccine supply chain
under centralized decision-making are inversely proportional to t, λ and cs. This shows that
with the increase of t, λ and cs, the optimal profit, total consumer surplus and social welfare of
the vaccine supply chain decrease. In order to improve the total profit of the supply chain,
increase the consumer surplus and social welfare, it can reduce the time and effort spent by
the vaccinators in finding and testing vaccines, control the proportion of problem vaccines or
reduce the unit service cost of the vaccine traceability service platform. Blockchain
technology can meet these measures. The proof of Proposition 2 is shown in Appendix A2.
3.3 Decentralized decision-making (D)
In decentralized decision-making, each member of the supply chain chooses the pricing
strategy with the ultimate goal of maximizing their own interests. In this paper, because the
BVP is profitable according to its own charging standards (fixed charge or proportional
charge) and does not participate in the pricing decisions of the vaccine manufacturer and the
vaccination unit, the decentralized decision-making can be regarded as a Stackelberg game
between the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit. As the leader, the vaccine
manufacturer first determines the wholesale price, then the vaccination unit as the follower
determines the selling price according to the manufacturer’s decision.
Proposition 3. In the case of decentralized decision-making, there are

Proposition 4(a) shows that wðFC−DÞ* and pðFC−DÞ* also decrease with the increase of t. This
reason is that as t increases, the cost for consumers to buy the vaccine will increase, resulting
in a decrease in the number of vaccinations. To stimulate the purchase, the vaccine
manufacturer and the vaccination unit will adopt a price reduction strategy. With the
increase of λ, wðFC−DÞ* decreases, while pðFC−DÞ* increases. The larger the λ is, the more
problem vaccines are, and the greater the loss (wλd) or cost (((1 þ λ)w þ cU) d) of the
vaccination unit is. On the one hand, in order to improve profit, the vaccination unit will set a
higher selling price. On the other hand, the vaccination unit will reduce the number of vaccine
doses ordered to reduce losses. To obtain higher profits, the vaccine manufacturer will reduce
the wholesale price to attract the vaccination unit to order more vaccines. Proposition 4(b)

U are only related
to t and λ. With the increase of t and λ,ΠðFC−DÞ*
M andΠðFC−DÞ*
U will decrease. The optimal profit
of the vaccine supply chain is related to t, λ and cs. With the increase of t, λ and cs, the optimal
profit of the vaccine supply chain will decrease. Proposition 4(c) shows that ΠðFC−DÞ*
BVP at the
optimal selling price is the increasing function of t and the decreasing function of cs. Besides,
the profit of the BVP is also related to λ. When 0 < λ < 1− tγ − θþs− cU − 2cM

BVP is the increasing function of λ.
When λ ¼ 1− tγ − θþs− cU − 2cM

BVP is the lowest.
Propositions 4(d) and (e) show that in the decentralized decision-making, the total consumer
surplus decreases with the increase of t and λ, while the social welfare decreases with the
increase of t, λ and cs. The proof of Proposition 4 is shown in Appendix A4.

(c) CSðFC−CÞ* > CSðFC−DÞ*.
(d) SW ðFC−CÞ* > SW ðFC−DÞ*.
Proposition 5(a) shows that when cs is high enough (cs >
1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ ), the optimal
selling price of the vaccination unit in the centralized decision-making is higher than that
in decentralized decision-making. This reason is that the cost of the whole supply chain
increases when cs is high. To improve the profit of the supply chain, the optimal selling
price under the centralized decision-making may exceed that under the decentralized
decision-making.When cs is low enough (0 < cs <
1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ ), the optimal selling
price of the vaccination unit in the centralized decision-making is less than that in the
decentralized decision-making. This reason is shown as follows. On the one hand, when cs
is low, the cost of the whole supply chain is low. In order to increase the vaccine ordering
quantity, the selling price will be lower (in the case of centralized decision-making). On the
other hand, in the case of decentralized decision-making, the vaccination unit aims at
maximizing their own interests. In order to increase profits, it will choose a higher vaccine
selling price. When cs ¼ 1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ , in these two situations, the optimal selling
price is equal. From Proposition 5(b), it can be seen that the total profit of the vaccine
supply chain is the same in the centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-
making when cs ¼ 1− tγ − θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ . When cs ≠
1− tγ − θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ , the optimal profit
of the supply chain in the centralized decision-making is greater than that in the
decentralized decision-making. It can be seen from Propositions 5(c) and (d) that the total
consumer surplus and social welfare under centralized decision-making are greater than
ones under decentralized decision-making. As a third party, the vaccine traceability
service platform does not participate in the supply chain decision-making, and can
increase its own profit by increasing the fixed cost FM or (and) FU, which has no influence
on the profits of the supply chain, the total consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore,
in order to improve the overall profit of the supply chain, increase the consumer surplus
and social welfare, the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit can improve their
profit distribution by seeking some cooperation. See Appendix A5 for the process of
Proposition 5.
4. Benefit coordination mechanism of the vaccine supply chain
In order to improve the profit of the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit,
make the overall profit of the vaccine supply chain under the decentralized decision-
making reach the level of the centralized decision-making, and increase the consumer
surplus and the social welfare, it is necessary to coordinate the vaccine supply chain
through certain contracts. Among all the contracts, cost-sharing contract and revenue-
sharing contract are most commonly used in the supply chain. Therefore, in this section,
we try to discuss the interest coordination of the proposed model through the two
contracts.
INTR

2106
4.1 Cost-sharing contract (S)
Under the blockchain technology, the problem vaccine ((1 þ λ)d) cannot be vaccinated by
consumers, which causes the cost of the vaccination unit to increase. In the vaccine supply
chain, the cost-sharing contract means that the vaccine manufacturer (the leader) will bear
part of the cost of the problem vaccine for the vaccination unit (the follower) besides
bearing his or her own production cost. Assuming that the cost-sharing ratio is η
(0 5 η ≤ 1), the profits of the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit can be
expressed as follows:
ΠðFC−SÞ
M ¼ ðw� cM Þð1þ λÞd � ηwλd � FM ; (20)
ΠðFC−SÞ
U ¼ ðp� cU � wÞd � ð1� ηÞwλd � FU : (21)
We solve the problem by backward induction. Combining equations (1) and (21), the optimal
selling price of the vaccination unit is obtained as follows:
pðFC−SÞ* ¼ 1� tγ � θ þ sþ cU þ ð1þ ð1� η1ÞλÞw
2
: (22)
Substituting equation (22) into equation (20), the optimal wholesale price of the vaccine
manufacturer under the cost-sharing contract is obtained as follows:
wðFC−SÞ* ¼ 1� tγ � θ þ s� cU þ ð1þ λÞcM
2ð1þ ð1� η1ÞλÞ
: (23)
Substituting equation (23) into equation (22), we have
pðFC−SÞ* ¼ 3ð1� tγ � θ þ sÞ þ cU þ ð1þ λÞcM
4
: (24)
Proposition 6. Under the cost-sharing contract, we have
(a) wðFC−SÞ* > wðFC−DÞ*, pðFC−SÞ* ¼ pðFC−DÞ*.
(b) ΠðFC−SÞ*
M ¼ ΠðFC−DÞ*
M ,ΠðFC−SÞ*
U ¼ ΠðFC−DÞ*
U ,ΠðFC−SÞ*
BVP ¼ΠðFC−DÞ*
BVP ,ΠðFC−SÞ* ¼ ΠðFC−DÞ*,
CSðFC−SÞ* ¼ CSðFC−DÞ*, SW ðFC−SÞ* ¼ SW ðFC−DÞ*.
Proposition 6(a) shows that compared with the decentralized decision-making, the optimal
wholesale price of the vaccine manufacturer increases under the cost-sharing contract.
The result is obvious, because the cost of the vaccine manufacturer increases. However,
the optimal selling price of the vaccination unit under the cost-sharing contract is the same
as the decentralized decision-making. From Proposition 6(b), we can see that under the
cost-sharing contract, the profit of the vaccine manufacturer, the profit of the vaccination
unit, the profit of the vaccine traceability service platform, the total profit of the vaccine
supply chain, the total consumer surplus and the social welfare are the same as those in the
decentralized decision situation. Therefore, the cost-sharing contract cannot improve the
profit of the vaccine supply chain and total consumer surplus. The proof of Proposition 6 is
shown in Appendix A6.

4.2 Revenue-sharing contract (R)
Under the revenue-sharing contract, the vaccine manufacturer sells vaccines to the
vaccination unit at a wholesale price below the cost (w < cM). In order to make up for the
loss of the vaccine manufacturer, the vaccination unit shares part of its selling revenue
with the vaccine manufacturer, so as to ensure that the income level of both parties is
higher than that of the decentralized decision-making and achieve the best performance of
the supply chain. Assuming that the revenue-sharing ratio of the vaccination unit is f
(0 5 f ≤ 1). The profits of the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit can be
expressed as follows:
ΠðFC−RÞ
M ¼ ðw� cM Þð1þ λÞd þ fpd � FM ; (25)
ΠðFC−RÞ
U ¼ ðð1� fÞp� cU � ð1þ λÞwÞd � FU : (26)
Since
v2ΠðFC−RÞ
U
vp2
¼ −2ð1−fÞn < 0, ΠðFC−RÞ
U reveals that it is a concave function in p.
When
vΠðFC−RÞ
U
vp
¼ 0, the vaccination unit obtains the optimal selling price, which is
pðFC−RÞ* ¼ ð1� fÞð1� tγ � θ þ sÞ þ cU þ ð1þ λÞw
2ð1� fÞ : (27)
Let pðFC−RÞ* ¼ pðFC−CÞ*. Therefore, the wholesale price of the vaccine manufacturer under the
revenue-sharing contract is
wðFC−RÞ ¼ ð1� fÞð1þ λÞðcM þ csÞ � fcU
1þ λ
: (28)
Proposition 7. Under the revenue-sharing contract, if and only if 0 < cs ≤
1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM
2ð1þλÞ and ð1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM − 2ð1þλÞcsÞ2
2ð1− tγ − θþs− cU − ð1þλÞðcMþcsÞÞ2 ≤f≤
ð3ð1− tγ − θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM Þ− 2ð1þλÞcsÞð1− tγ− θþs− cU − ð1þλÞcM − 2ð1þλÞcsÞ
4ð1− tγ − θþs− cU − ð1þλÞðcMþcsÞÞ2
,
there are: ΠðFC−RÞ*
M ≥ΠðFC−DÞ*
M , ΠðFC−RÞ*
U ≥ΠðFC−DÞ*
U , ΠðFC−RÞ* ¼
ΠðFC−CÞ*, CSðFC−RÞ* ¼ CSðFC−CÞ*, SW ðFC−RÞ* ¼ SW ðFC−CÞ*.
It can be seen from Proposition 7 that when cs and w meet certain conditions, the optimal
profits of the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit under revenue-sharing
contract are greater than that under decentralized decision-making, and the total profit,
total consumer surplus and social welfare of the vaccine supply chain reach the centralized
decision-making level. The profit of the BVP can be improved by increasing fixed fee FM or
(and) FU. The proof of Proposition 7 is shown in Appendix A7.
5. Extended model: proportional charge (PC) scenario
In this section, we will discuss the pricing and profit of the vaccine supply chain when the
blockchain technology based on the vaccine traceability service platform, adopts the
proportional charge method and compares it with the fixed charge scenario. That is to say, at
a certain time or a certain time period, the vaccine traceability service platform based on
blockchain technology extracts fees in proportion of w1 (0 < w1 < 1) and w2 (0 < w2 < 1)
according to the income of the manufacturer and the vaccination unit. To facilitate the
calculation, we assume that w15 w25 w. Therefore, in the extended model, the profits of the
INTR
31,6
2108
vaccine manufacturer, the vaccination unit and the vaccine traceability service platform
based on blockchain technology are as follows:
ΠPC
M ¼ ð1� wÞwð1þ λÞd � cM ð1þ λÞd; (29)
ΠPC
U ¼ ð1� wÞpd � wð1þ λÞd � cUd; (30)
ΠPC
BVP ¼ wwð1þ λÞd þ wpd � csð1þ λÞd: (31)
Proposition 8. In the extended model, there are
(a) The optimal wholesale price for the vaccine manufacturers is:
wPC* ¼ ð1� tγ � θ þ sÞð1� wÞ2 � cU ð1� wÞ þ cM ð1þ λÞ
2ð1þ λÞð1� wÞ : (32)
(b) The optimal selling price of the vaccination unit is:
pPC* ¼ 3ð1� tγ � θ þ sÞð1� wÞ2 þ cU ð1� wÞ þ cM ð1þ λÞ
4ð1� wÞ2 : (33)
Proposition 8 gives the optimal solution of the supply chain’s selling price, total profit and
total consumer surplus when the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain
technology implements the profit model of charging by proportion. See Appendix A8 for the
specific certification process. Next, we discuss the influence of each parameter on the optimal
solution.
Proposition 9. In the extended model, there are
(a) vwPC*
vt
< 0, vw
PC*
vλ < 0, vw
PC*
vw < 0.
(b) vpPC*
vt
< 0, vp
PC*
vλ > 0, vw
PC*
vw > 0.
Proposition 9 shows that wPC* is inversely proportional to t and λ. pPC* is inversely
proportional to t and directly proportional to λ. See Proposition 4 for specific reasons.
However, with the increase of w, the optimal wholesale price for the vaccine manufacturer
wPC* decreases and the optimal selling price for the vaccination unit pPC* increases. This is
because the larger the w is, the higher the cost that the vaccine manufacturer and the
vaccination unit pay to the vaccine traceability service platform, and the greater their profits
loss. In order to increase profits, the vaccine manufacturer will choose to lower the wholesale
price to attract the vaccination unit to order more vaccines, and the vaccination unit will set a
higher selling price. The proof of Proposition 9 is shown in Appendix A9.

Proposition 10. Comparing the fixed charge (FC) scenario with the proportional charge
(PC) scenario, we get
(a) wðFC−DÞ* > wPC*.
(b) pðFC−DÞ* < pPC*.
(c) ΠðFC−DÞ* > ΠPC*.
(d) CSðFC−DÞ* > CSPC*.
(e) SW ðFC−DÞ* > SWPC*.
Proposition 10(a) shows that the optimal wholesale price of the vaccine manufacturer in the
fixed charge scenario is greater than that in the proportional charge scenario. This is because,
under the proportional charge scenario, the higher the income of the vaccine manufacturer is,
the higher the cost paid to the vaccine traceability platform based on blockchain technology.
In order to reduce the cost, the vaccine manufacturer will lower the wholesale price. In
addition, under the fixed charge scenario, the fee charged by the vaccine traceability service
platform to the vaccine manufacturer is fixed. In order to improve its income, the vaccine
manufacturer will raise the wholesale price at this time. Proposition 10(b) shows that the
optimal selling price of the vaccination unit in the fixed charge scenario is lower than that in
the proportional charge scenario. This may be because, while other conditions remain
unchanged, the vaccination unit pays higher fees to the vaccine traceability service platform
in the case of fixed charge. In order to ensure its interests, the vaccination unit will raise the
selling price in the case of proportional charge. Propositions 10(c)–(e) show that the optimal
total profit, total consumer surplus and social welfare of the vaccine supply chain under the
fixed charge scenario are greater than those under the proportional charge scenario,
respectively. Therefore, from the perspective of the vaccine supply chain as a whole, the fixed
charge scenario hasmore advantages than the proportional charge scenario. But whichmode
to use depends on the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain technology.
In addition, the extended model can realize profit coordination through a model similar to the
contract signed in Section 3. We will not go into details here. The proof of Proposition 10 is
shown in Appendix A10.
6. The roles of blockchain technology
In the previous sections, we analyzed the pricing and coordination of the vaccine supply chain
based on blockchain technology by building a model. Next, we try to discuss the role of
blockchain technology in the vaccine supply chain through the above analysis.
Proposition 11. In the blockchain technology based on the vaccine supply chain, it not
only saves the time and effort taken by the vaccinator to find and test the
vaccine before vaccination (t) but also reduces the proportion of the
problematic vaccines in the supply chain (λ). Thus, the profit, total
consumer surplus and social welfare of the vaccine supply chain
INTR
31,6
2110
increase. The operational efficiency of the vaccine supply chain is
improved.
Proposition 11 illustrates the role of blockchain technology in the vaccine supply chain. First,
it is obvious that using blockchain technology in the vaccine supply chain can save t. Before
using blockchain technology, the vaccine information inquired by the vaccinators through
the vaccine tracing platform is basically one-sided, incomplete and lack of timeliness. To
ensure the safety of the vaccine, the vaccinators sometimes need to verify and evaluate the
vaccine through various channels (e.g. browsing a large number of historical websites,
telephone consultation with merchants), which requires more t. Moreover, due to the
existence of false information, it is not completely certain whether the vaccines can be
vaccinated. The introduction of blockchain technology ensures the accuracy and validity of
the vaccine information. The vaccinators can log on to the vaccine traceability service
platform directly and inquire all information about vaccines without using other channels.
Therefore, t decreases.
Second, using blockchain technology in the vaccine supply chain can reduce λ. Since the
information on the blockchain cannot be tamperedwith, if any link is found to have problems,
the relevant institutions will punish the directly responsible businessmen to avoid the
possibility of speculation at each stage. Facing this transparent supply chain environment,
the supply chain members must ensure that the information on the platform is true and
effective, so that they can exist in the supply chain for a long time. Therefore, λ decreases. In
addition, it eliminates the distrust among the supply chain members and increases the
possibility of their cooperation. It is worth noting that in the vaccine supply chain based on
blockchain technology, λ will not drop to 0. This is caused by some external force majeure
factors. Even if the information in each link is correct, it is not absolutely certain that the
vaccine can be inoculated at last. When the vaccinator finds that the vaccine to be vaccinated
has expired, is invalid or has other safety problems, he or she will not choose to vaccinate.
Finally, using blockchain technology can increase the profit, total consumer surplus and
social welfare of the vaccine supply chain. From Propositions 2 and 4, we can find that when t
or λ decreases, the profit, total consumer surplus and social welfare of the supply chain will
increase.
To sum up, we come to the conclusion that the application of blockchain technology in the
vaccine supply chain can improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain.
7. Conclusion
In recent years, with the outbreak of vaccine incidents, vaccine safety has become a hot topic
in the world. Research shows that improving the vaccine supply chain management is the
most direct and effective way to solve vaccine safety problems. However, the existing
research on the vaccine supply chain does not solve the problem of vaccine safety. At present,
the application of blockchain technology in the field of supply chain management is
deepening gradually. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization,
traceability and nontampering and has become an effective solution to solve the vaccine
safety problems in the vaccine supply chain. In the vaccine supply chain, blockchain
technology plays an important role based on a platform and provides services formembers of
the supply chain. However, after the introduction of the vaccine traceability service platform
based on blockchain technology, the operational efficiency of the vaccine supply chain
remains to be discussed. Based on this, we built a vaccine supply chain economic gamemodel
consisting of a vaccine manufacturer, a vaccine traceability service platform based on
blockchain technology and a vaccination unit.
Pricing and
coordination of
vaccine supply
2111
In the basic model (fixed charge scenario), we analyze the optimal pricing strategy, the
optimal total profit, the total consumer surplus and the social welfare of the vaccine supply
chain under centralized and decentralized decision-making. Sensitivity analysis is conducted
to understand the influence of main parameters, especially these related to blockchain
technology, on the vaccine supply chain optimization strategy. Then, we discuss whether two
common contracts, cost-sharing contract and revenue-sharing contract, can achieve the
coordination of the vaccine supply chain. In the extended model, we discuss the optimal
solution of the vaccine supply chain under the proportional charge scenario and compare it
with the fixed charge scenario.
By solving the problems raised in Section 1, we mainly get the following important
insights and management implications:
(1) In the basic model, there are equilibrium strategies under the centralized and
decentralized decision-making. Moreover, the total profit of the supply chain under
the centralized decision-making is always no less than that under the decentralized
decision-making, and the total consumer surplus and the social welfare under the
centralized decision-making are always greater than ones under the decentralized
decision-making. In both cases, the optimal selling price of the vaccine is related to the
service cost of the vaccine traceability service platform to unit vaccine.
(2) The cost-sharing contract cannot realize the coordination of the vaccine supply chain
based on the blockchain technology. When the proportion of revenue-sharing meets
certain conditions, the revenue-sharing contract can coordinate the vaccine supply
chain based on blockchain technology. Therefore, in the vaccine supply chain, the
vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination unit can sign appropriate revenue-sharing
contracts to improve the profits of each member and the vaccine supply chain.
(3) Compared with the fixed charge scenario, the total profit of the supply chain obtained
by adopting the proportional charge strategy in the vaccine traceability service
platform is less, and the total consumer surplus and the social welfare are also lower.
Therefore, on the whole, the fixed charge scenario is more beneficial to the vaccine
supply chain than the proportional charge scenario. However, the specific scenario
model depends on the vaccine traceability service platform based on blockchain
technology.
(4) After the introduction of blockchain technology, vaccinators can decide whether to
vaccinate directly through the platform without using other channels. Therefore, the
time and effort spent by vaccinators in finding and testing vaccines decreases. In
addition, facing this transparent supply chain environment, the supply chain
members must ensure that the information on the platform is true and effective, so
that they can exist in the supply chain for a long time. Therefore, the proportion of
problem vaccines decreases. At the same time, the profit of the vaccine supply chain,
the total consumer surplus and the social welfare increased, which shows that the
operation efficiency of the vaccine supply chain has been improved.

By equations (1) and (7), we can see that the second derivative of p is v2ΠFC

ΠFC is a strictly concave function of p. We get vΠFC

ð1� tγ � θ þ s� cU � ð1þ λÞðcM þ csÞÞ:

The inverse order method is used to solve the optimal solution. Firstly, combining equation (1)
with equation (3), we obtain the second derivative of p is

Firstly, combining equation (1) with equation (30), we obtain the second derivative of p is

vΠPC

Then, putting it into equation (29), we obtain that:

So, the optimal selling price of the vaccination unit is:

Since ð1− tγ − θ þ sÞð1−fÞ2 − ð1þ λÞcM > 0, 1�w > 0, so ð1− tγ − θ þ sÞð1−fÞ− ð1þ λÞcM > 0.
We get wðFC−DÞ* > wPC* when 0 < cM < ð1− tr − θþsÞð1−fÞ
