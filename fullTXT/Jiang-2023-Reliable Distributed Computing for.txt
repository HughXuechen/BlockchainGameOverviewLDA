Abstract— The metaverse is regarded as a new wave of techno-
logical transformation that provides a virtual space for people to
interact through digital avatars. To achieve immersive user expe-
riences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the key technology.
However, computing intensive tasks of real-time rendering from
metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a
single resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile
devices can offload the metaverse rendering tasks to other mo-
bile devices by adopting the collaborative computing paradigm
based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC). Therefore, this
paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework
for the metaverse services, especially for vehicular metaverse. In the
framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers,
are aggregated to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehic-
ular metaverse. Specifically, in the upper layer, a miner coalition
formation game is formulated based on a reputation metric to

reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the
subjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database.
In the lower layer, a Stackelberg game based incentive mechanism

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background and Motivations
THE blossom of emerging technologies, such as real-time
rendering technologies, digital twin, artificial intelligence,
6 G communications and blockchain, has promoted the prolifer-
ation of the metaverse [1], [2]. The metaverse was first created
in the science fiction named Snow Crash [3], which is a stereo-
scopic virtual space parallel to the physical world. Then, the
successful broadcast of the famous film Ready Player One raises
the public’s attention in the metaverse again [4]. To provide im-
mersive experiences for people in the metaverse, real-time ren-
dering technologies (e.g., extended reality and spatial sounding
rendering) are considered to be the main interaction interfaces,
which might cause a large quantity of computing [5]. Edge
computing extends cloud computing to the edge of networks
and supports resource-limited mobile devices to offload their
tasks to edge servers for processing [6]. However, the number
of mobile devices connected to communication networks will
increase sharply with the advent of the metaverse, which can
cause congestion due to edge servers’ limited resources [7]. Be-
sides, the providers may not have dedicated computing resources
for the graphic and audio rendering services in the metaverse.
Considering that the intensive computation from metaverse ser-
vices may be unbearable for resource-limited mobile devices [1],
distributed collaborative computing has been adopted to solve
computing-intensive tasks in the metaverse [8].
For the distributed computing of metaverse services, multiple
mobile devices work collaboratively to complete a large-scale
rendering task. One of the main challenges of the distributed
computing system for metaverse services is the straggler effects.
The stragglers refer to the mobile devices whose computing
speed is observably slower than average due to their limited

computing resources or poor communication link, thus causing
long latency and bad immersive experience for the metaverse,
especially the metaverse interactive services (e.g., online games
Minecraft and Roblox). Coded Distributed Computing (CDC)
is a promising distributed computing solution to alleviate the
straggler effects and guarantee fault-tolerance by aggregating
the extra computing resources from mobile devices [9]. CDC
introduces computing redundancy to the metaverse by code
techniques, and metaverse service providers (MSPs) only need
to collect the computing results of rendering tasks from a subset
of workers. Thus CDC can significantly reduce the computation
latency and improve the data processing reliability, equivalently
alleviate the straggler effects. However, there are two critical
problems that need to be addressed: i) The mobile devices may
be unwilling to participate in metaverse services without a rea-
sonable incentive; ii) Some mobile devices may even misbehave
to damage MSPs’ benefits, thus resulting in bad user experience.
How to select reliable mobile devices and incentivize them to
participate in metaverse services are still challenging.
B. CDC use Case in Vehicular Metaverse
The vehicular metaverse integrates extended reality tech-
nologies and real-time motion data seamlessly to blend virtual
and real sapce for drivers and passengers in vehicles, which
is an emerging in-vehicle entertainment segment for the au-
tomotive market. WayRay’s Holograktor is striving to create
the metaverse vehicle, where passengers and drivers are able
to interact with a different reality during the vehicle ride. Fig. 1
shows an example of CDC in the vehicular metaverse. Vehicular
metaverse services present the seamless fusion of virtual and real
worlds for passengers with Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented
Reality (AR) technologies, which allow passengers to entertain
themselves in vehicles. Passengers can see virtual scenes or
objects through front windshields and side windows with the
help of metaverse Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A large
amount of graphic and audio rendering in vehicular metaverse
services may cause intensive computation for resource-limited
vehicles. Under such conditions, those vehicles can act as MSPs
to cooperate with nearby vehicles that act as workers. How-
ever, this vehicular metaverse is vulnerable to stragglers due to
misbehavior and highly mobile environments, which can make
some workers unable to complete computation tasks and return
the results successfully. Based on the CDC technique, MSPs can
decompose and assign the rendering tasks to workers, and MSPs
only need to collect a subset of workers’ computing results,
which is beneficial for the immersive experience of users in
vehicles.
C. Contributions
In this paper, we mainly investigate the use case of CDC in
vehicular metaverse, but the proposed scheme is not limited to
the vehicular sector. We first adopt reputation metric to assess
the reliability of workers in CDC to support vehicular metaverse
services, and a stable coalition of reliable workers is formed
based on reputation values. Moreover, we apply a hierarchical
decision making structure composed of coalition formation and
Stackelberg game to design an efficient incentive mechanism for
reliable CDC in the vehicular metaverse. Blockchain is used to
achieve distributed secure reputation management and to main-
tain worker participation records in the vehicular metaverse.
As blockchain can manage the interactions among entities in
the metaverse by a decentralized, tamper-proof and transparent
manner [10]. We summarize the contributions of this paper as
follows.
1) We propose a novel reliable distributed collaborative com-
puting framework for the metaverse based on CDC and
blockchain technologies, which can support the immersive
user experiences in the metaverse. Especially, we consider
the use case in the vehicular metaverse.
2) We adopt the reputation values to evaluate the reliability of
workers. The miners who form coalitions are responsible
for the calculation of workers’ reputation values, and the
reputation metric is the abstraction and aggregation of
multiple factors that affect the quality of coalitions.
3) We propose a hierarchical game-theoretic approach to
investigate the reliable and sustainable CDC scheme in
the vehicular metaverse. In the upper layer, the coalition
game is innovatively combined with the reputation metric
to choose reliable CDC workers for MSPs. In the lower
layer, the Stackelberg game is formulated to motivate the
reliable CDC workers to participate in metaverse services.
4) Numerical results indicate that the proposed hierarchical
game-theoretic scheme is resistant to malicious workers.

II. RELATED WORKS
A. Coded Distributed Computing
The research on CDC mainly focuses on mitigating the strag-
gler effects and minimizing the communication cost. Coding
theories are the popular methods to solve above issues. In [11],
the authors explore the usage of coding theory to alleviate the
straggler effect in matrix multiplication and reduce communi-
cation bottlenecks in data shuffling. The theoretical analysis
proves that the coded schemes can obtain significant gains
compared with uncoded schemes. In [12], the authors study
the distributed matrix multiplication problem in heterogeneous
environments, where a coding framework is designed to accel-
erate distributed matrix multiplication with straggling devices.
In [13], the authors consider that the straggler phenomenon
of wireless distributed computing networks is caused by local
computation and wireless transmission. In [14], a coded com-
puting framework for federated learning is proposed, which uses
structured coding redundancy to alleviate the straggler effects
and speed up the training procedure. In [15], the authors design
the incentive mechanism for the CDC tasks by formulating a
game-theoretic approach. In [16], the authors design platforms’
incentive mechanisms to encourage workers’ participation in the
coded machine learning. However, the existing works ignore the
reliability of CDC workers when study CDC, which might neg-
atively impact the performance of CDC. Besides, reliable CDC
incentive mechanism for the metaverse has not been studied.
B. Metaverse Services
Metaverse-related research is still in its infancy. There are
some works studying the metaverse services in graphic or audio
rendering, extended reality technologies etc. In [17], the authors
propose a vision of the metaverse native communications that
includes encrypted address-based access model and blockchain.
In order to realize the audio/visual and virtual/reality congruence
in metaverse services, the authors in [18] design the 6-degree-
of-freedom interactive audio engines based on objects. In [19],
the authors give a comprehensive survey on computational arts
that blend virtual and physical environment in the metaverse.
The authors in [20] design a brain-to-speech scheme for smart
communication in the real world, which is also presented as a po-
tential application in the metaverse. The authors in [21] propose
an operating system for the metaverse based on extended reality,
which integrates hardware, computer vision and extended reality
specific network. In [22], the authors propose a blockchain-
based framework for the metaverse. The sharding scheme is used
to improve the scalability of blockchain networks. The above
works have not considered the metaverse services in vehicular
networks. As metaverse might have a profound impact in the
automotive field, a great deal of research needs to be done on the
vehicular metaverse, including the distributed computing that is
meaningful for the user immersive experience in the vehicular
metaverse.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATIONS
A. System Model
The vehicular metaverse mainly includes the virtual world,
physical world and interaction layer. Passengers can immerse
themselves in the fusion of virtual and real scenarios through the
interaction layer. The immersive user experience is a significant
part of the interaction layer [4]. To achieve immersive user
experiences in the metaverse services (e.g., projecting avatars
into passengers’ seats or enjoying the virtual attractions through
interactive holographic windscreens), high fidelity rendering
technologies (e.g., graphic and spatial sound rendering) are
adopted to create 3D or holographic digital media, which require
intensive matrix computation tasks to be processed by onboard
units or devices in vehicles. Those vehicles can choose to execute
rendering tasks by collaborating with other vehicles within a
limited communication distance. In the metaverse, vehicles that
distribute large-scale matrix computation tasks (e.g., projection
and shadow mapping in graphic rendering [23]) are called MSPs.
The vehicles that execute the computing tasks of metaverse ser-
vices are called workers. RodeSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient
computation and storage resources in vehicular networks act
as miners to execute the blockchain consensus algorithm. In
addition, miners are motivated to join the reputation calculation,
and miners that have contributed to the reliable worker selection
will be rewarded by the blockchain (e.g., receiving tokens or
obtaining resource rewards).
Fig. 2 shows the whole CDC process in the vehicular meta-
verse, including the worker selection phase and CDC rendering
task execution phase. In the worker selection phase, miners
calculate workers’ reputation values and form coalitions to
select reliable workers for the MSP. Then, the MSP can ob-
tain reliable worker information from the distributed ledger of
the blockchain. In the CDC task execution phase, the MSP
distributes the rendering tasks to the selected workers. The
workers process the computation tasks and transmit the final
results to MSPs via OFDMA-based wireless transmission links.
Then the MSPs update workers’ reputation values and record
the updated values on the blockchain. Besides, the miners col-
lect the transaction information for the blockchain and all the
resource interaction information (e.g., workers contribute their
computing resources to MSPs) between the MSPs and workers
JIANG et al.: RELIABLE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING FOR METAVERSE: A HIERARCHICAL GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH 1087

are recorded on the blockchain. The detailed CDC process are
given as follows.
Step 1: The MSP sends a transaction to blockchain to recruit
workers that are willing to serve for rendering tasks in the
vehicular metaverse. The transaction contains the requirements
of the MSP, such as the reputation threshold T com
th of workers.
Step 2: The workers that are willing to help the MSP with
metaverse services send transactions to respond to the MSP.
The worker set is denoted as W = {1, 2, . . . , w, . . . ,W}. In
the metaverse, users have many perception dimensions in im-
mersive experience due to computations of graphic rendering
and sound generation. Such perception can be qualitative and
the subjective logical model is suitable. To select trustable
workers, the blockchain needs to obtain the compositive rep-
utation opinions of workers based on the subjective logical
model [24]. Miners are stimulated to compute workers’ com-
positive reputation opinions. The set of miners is denoted as
M = {1, 2, . . . ,m, . . . ,M}. Miners have no idea about the re-
liability of workers before they compute reputation values of
workers. Each miner randomly selects several workers and com-
putes workers’ compositive reputation opinions. The number of
workers selected by miner m is denoted as |Wm|. The workers
whose compositive reputation opinions are lower than T com
th are
discarded by miners, and T com
th is set based on MSPs’ service
requirements [24]. We assume that the number of discarded
workers is much smaller than those of workers that are not
abandoned by miners. The set of workers selected by miner m
is denoted as Wm = {Wm,1,Wm,2, . . . ,Wm,w, . . .Wm,|Wm|},
where Wm,w is the identity number of the w-th worker selected
by miner m.
Step 3: In order to increase a likelihood to be rewarded by
blockchain, miners that obtain workers’ compositive reputation
opinions form coalitions. The coalition members in each coali-
tion contain miners and their corresponding worker sets. When
the coalition is selected by blockchain, the compositive reputa-
tion values of workers in the selected coalition will be recorded
on blockchain. Another benefit for the coalition formation is that
multiple reliable workers evaluated by their reputation can offer
larger computational resources to the MSP.
Step 4: The blockchain returns selected workers’ information,
including the location information and reputation opinions, to
the MSP.
Step 5: The MSP distributes the rendering tasks to the selected
workers based on Stackelberg game. In the game, the MSP acts
as the leader to determine the reward strategy, and workers act
as followers to adjust computing speed strategy. Specifically, we
consider that MSP Pi needs to render 2D images in RGB color
into the needed Field of Views (FoV). The number of pixels is
denoted asnp, and the resolution of the required FoV isnp × np.
With the CDC technology, the MSP allocates the rendering task
to workers. The Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code
is adopted to alleviate the straggler effects in the distributed
computing [9]. The rendering task of MSP Pi is expressed as
yi = Aixi, and Ai ∈ R
(3×2×np)×np , where “3” is the number
of colors in RGB model, which contains red, green and blue
colors, “2” is the number of viewpoints [25]. MSP Pi first
divides the rendering matrix Ai into K equal-sized submatrices
in R
(3×2×np)
K ×np . Then, based on (N,K) MDS code, the MSP
gets N encoded submatrices with the same size (3×2×np)
K × np.
1088 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 72, NO. 1, JANUARY 2023
Each submatrix is allocated to a worker. MSP Pi can reconstruct
the final rendering result when receiving the results from any K
(K < N ) workers, which can mitigate straggler effects.
Step 6: The resource interactions between the MSP and work-
ers are recorded on blockchain. Then, the workers can receive
the deserved reward from the MSP.
Step 7: After finishing CDC rendering tasks, the MSP updates
the local reputation opinions of workers on blockchain.
In the process of reliable worker selection, the interactions
among MSPs, miners and blockchain database might cause un-
bearable delays for metaverse services. To realize efficient CDC
rendering task execution and to enhance immersive vehicular
metaverse experience, MSPs can select workers with the help of
blockchain before the generation of rendering tasks. Then once
MSPs have CDC computing tasks, MSPs can interact with the
selected workers directly.
B. Transmission Model
We consider that the CDC rendering task execution mainly
contains computing the tasks and transmitting the computing
results to the MSP. Here we establish the transmission model
that vehicle workers transmit the rendering task computation
results to the MSP, where we adopt the orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme. MSP Pi uses a set
of resource blocks for the wireless transmission, and there is
no interference between workers, this assumption is typically to
simply the analysis, but the model can still be straightforwardly
extended with interference [26]. We also consider the effects
of mobility on channel gain between the MSP Pi and workers.
To estimate an accurate mobile channel gain, the channel state
information of mobile link is broadcast to workers with a period
of Tc. The channel states of the wireless mobile links in the
previous and current time interval are denoted as g and ĝ,
respectively. The relationship between g and ĝ is g = �ĝ + κ,
where � = J0(2πfDTc)(0 < � < 1) is the channel correla-
tion coefficient. J0(•) is the zero-order Bessel function. fD
is the maximum Doppler frequency and is expressed as fD =
|Δv|fc/3 × 108. |Δv| is the relative vehicle speed between the
MSP and workers. fc is the carrier frequency at 5.9 GHz. κ is
the channel discrepancy coefficient that follows CN (0, 1 −�2)
[27], [28]. Then the channel gain model between MSP Pi and
worker w is expressed as
Hiw = Giw
(
(�iwĝiw)
2 + |κiw|2
)
, (1)
where Giw is the large-scale fading effect between MSP Pi and
worker w. The signal-to-noise between MSP Pi and worker w
is expressed as
ηiw =
pwHiw
σ̃2
, (2)
where pw is the transmitting power of worker w, σ̃2 is the
variance of the Gaussian noise. The data rate between worker w
and MSP Pi is expressed as
ciw = Blog2 (1 + ηiw) . (3)
Fig. 3. Hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework for blockchain assisted
vehicular metaverse.
The communication delay of worker w is expressed as
T com−u
w =
sw
ciw
, (4)
where sw is the packet size of computation results transmitted
by worker w.
C. Computation Model
The computation time of each worker follows a 2-parameter
shifted exponential distribution [11], [12]. Then, the cumulative
distribution function of the time T cmp
w that worker w finishes
the rendering task is expressed as
Pr (T cmp
w ≤ t) = 1 − e−μw( t
l−aw), ∀t ≥ awl, (5)
where μw is the average computation speed of worker w, aw
is the start-up time to begin the rendering task computation,
l is the amount of rendering task allocated to each worker,
and l = 3 × 2 × np/K. The probability density function of the
above distribution is
f(t) =
μw
l
e−μw( t
l−aw). (6)
The average computation time for worker w is expressed as
E (T cmp
w ) =

e−μw( t

The average rendering task execution time of worker w is

+ E (T cmp

D. Hierarchical Game-Theoretic CDC Framework for
Vehicular Metaverse
The outline of the proposed hierarchical game is shown
in Fig. 3. Blockchain is utilized to achieve the decentralized
management for CDC in the vehicular metaverse. In order to
realize reliable and sustainable CDC in the vehicular metaverse,
we adopt a hierarchical game-theoretic approach based on coali-
tion formation and Stackelberg game. The coalition-Stackelberg
JIANG et al.: RELIABLE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING FOR METAVERSE: A HIERARCHICAL GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH 1089
game makes the proposed framework suitable for reliable CDC
in the vehicular metaverse. The description of the hierarchical
game-theoretic approach is shown as follows:
1) Upper layer: In the upper layer, the coalition formation
game is adopted to investigate the cooperative interac-
tions among miners that contribute to the computation
of workers’ compositive reputation values. The miners
compute workers’ compositive reputation values based
on reputation opinions stored on blockchain. Then the
miners form coalitions by maximizing the coalition utility
that includes workers’ compositive reputation values and
cost. In order to be selected by blockchain, each miner
prefers to form coalitions with other miners to obtain
higher coalition utility. Besides, considering the coalition
formation cost, the grand coalition may not be stable.
This is due to the fact that a high communication over-
head discourages all miners to participate and act as a
coalition. The coalition with the highest coalition utility
will be selected by blockchain, and the workers in the
selected coalition will have the chance to join the CDC
task execution.
2) Lower layer: In the lower layer, the Stackelberg game is
used to incentivize workers selected in the upper layer
to allocate more computing resource to the MSP’s CDC
rendering tasks. In the Stackelberg game, the MSP acts
as a leader to adjust the reward to workers who finish
the computing tasks in time, the workers act as followers
to adjust the average computing speed. The strategies of
workers also affect their local reputation values updated
by the MSP.
3) Interactions between upper and lower layers: In the up-
per layer, the miners that compute workers’ compositive
reputation values form coalitions. The coalition with the
highest coalition utility will be selected by the blockchain,
and the workers in the selected coalition will join the
Stackelberg game in the lower layer. For the Stackelberg
game, the MSP decides reward strategy, and the selected
coalitions of workers, which are formed in the upper
layer, contribute their computing resources to maximize
their utilities. Besides, to increase the probability of be-
ing selected in the next round of the coalition formation
game, the workers should consider their local reputation
values when adjusting the computing resource strategy.
The hierarchical game approach ensures that the CDC
rendering tasks can be executed by reliable workers and
maximize the MSP’s utility. Without forming coalitions,
the MSP may not be able to identify reliable workers,
which may degrade the utility of the MSP. Meanwhile,
the selected reliable workers are incentivized to contribute
their computing resources to the CDC rendering tasks
from vehicular metaverse services.
IV. RELIABLE WORKER SELECTION FOR VEHICULAR
METAVERSE
In the worker selection phase, we mainly focus on two
problems. The first one is how to obtain the overall reputation
opinions from the interaction histories between MSPs and work-
ers. Subjective logic is a popular tool to model the reliability
of entities in the vehicular metaverse, as it quantifies belief,
disbelief and uncertainty [29]. Based on the subjective logic
model, both direct and indirect reputations from other MSPs are
combined to derive reputation opinions of workers. The second
problem is how to select reliable workers based on reputation
opinions of workers in a distributed way. With the subjective
logic model, the reputation calculation of workers may not be
efficient for MSPs. On the one hand, MSPs need to process the
rendering tasks in time with limited capabilities. On the other
hand, if MSPs select reliable workers, MSPs need to search all
the local and recommended reputation opinions of workers on
the blockchain and compute the workers’ compositive reputation
opinions, which might be a burden for the MSPs. As miners are
trustable entities in blockchain-enabled metaverse systems, the
miners are motivated to select reliable workers for the MSPs, and
the miners that contribute to the reliable worker selection will be
rewarded by blockchain. For the formulated hierarchical game
design, the subjective logic model based reputation calculation
is used in the upper layer. Each miner in M selects several
workers from W to compute workers’ compositive reputation
opinions based on the stored direct reputation opinions and
subjective logic model. Then, the miners form coalitions and
the miner coalition with the highest coalition utility will be
selected by blockchain. In this section, the subjective logic
model is introduced, then the miner coalition formation game is
formulated.
A. Subjective Logic Model-Based Reputation Calculation
1) Local Opinions for Subjective Logic: The MSPs’ direct
reputation opinions to all workers are recorded on blockchain.
MSP Pi sends a transaction to blockchain to recruit workers.
Then, the workers that are willing to help MSP Pi send trans-
actions to respond to MSP Pi. Miners compute the workers’
compositive reputation opinions by combining the direct repu-
tation opinions updated by MSP Pi, and those updated by other
MSPs on blockchain. MSP Pi’s direct reputation opinions are
considered to be local reputation opinions, and other MSPs’
direct reputation opinions are considered to be recommended
reputation opinions.
The local opinion of MSP Pi to worker w in the
subjective logic model is expressed as a vector Rlocal
i→w =
{blocali→w , dlocali→w , ulocal
i→w }, where blocali→w represents belief, dlocali→w rep-
resents disbelief and ulocal
i→w represents uncertainty. Here blocali→w ,
dlocali→w , ulocal
i→w ∈ [0, 1], and blocali→w + dlocali→w + ulocal
i→w = 1. Based
on the subjective logic model in [30], belief, disbelief and
uncertainty expression for reputation opinions can be mapped
from the representation of the uncertain probability of events,
which can be represented by the beta distribution, and is decided
by the number of positive events and negative events. So blocali→w ,
dlocali→w and ulocal
i→w are represented as follows:
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
blocali→w = σ1pi→w
σ1pi→w+σ2qi→w+2 ,
dlocali→w = σ2qi→w

where pi→w and qi→w are the numbers of positive and negative
interactions between MSP Pi and worker w, respectively. The
MSP regards the resource interaction between itself and a worker
as a positive event if the worker is not a straggler in the CDC,
and returns the effective computation results that is important
for enhancing immersive experience of the vehicular metaverse
services (e.g., graph resolution or audio playback resolution).
The weights of positive and negative interaction are denoted
as σ1 and σ2, respectively, and 0 < σ2 < σ1 < 1. The local
reputation value T local
i→w is expressed as
T local
i→w = blocali→w + γulocal
i→w , (10)
where γ ∈ [0, 1] is the effective coefficient of uncertainty on the
reputation of worker w.
2) Recommended Opinions: Apart from MSP Pi’s local
reputation opinions, miners also need to search for selected
workers’ direct reputation opinions updated by other MSPs
on blockchain to obtain the recommended reputation opinions.
Suppose that miner m receives a number of � recommended
opinions of w on blockchain. � is also the number of recom-
menders. For recommender r ∈ �, the weight factor ωr is given
as [31]
ωr =
bi→r ×
(
blocalr→w + dlocalr→w
)
∑
r∈�
bi→r × (blocalr→w + dlocalr→w)
, (11)
where blocalr→w + dlocalr→w represents the familiarity value between
recommender r and worker w. The higher familiarity value
means that the recommended opinions of recommender r on
worker w is more convincing. bi→r is the social tie strength
between MSP Pi and the recommender. When MSP Pi and the
recommender have the same worker set, we consider that the
strength of social ties between MSP Pi and the recommender is
strong [32]. The sets of workers that have provided computing
services for MSP Pi and recommender r are denoted as Γ(Pi)
and Γ(r), respectively. Then, bi→r is expressed as [32]
bi→r =
|Γ (Pi) ∩ Γ(r)|
|Γ (Pi) ∪ Γ(r)| . (12)
The overall recommended reputation opinion of w is denoted
as Rrec
i→w = {breci→w, d
rec
i→w, u
rec
i→w}. The recommended reputation
opinion of workerw is the combination of all the recommenders’
local opinions with their weight ωr, r ∈ �. breci→w, dreci→w and

3) Combining Local Opinions With Recommend Opinions:
Based on the local opinion and recommended opinions from
other MSPs. Minerm can obtain the final compositive reputation
opinion of MSP Pi to worker w. The compositive reputation
opinion of MSP Pi to worker w is represented as Rcom

(14)
The compositive reputation value of MSP Pi to worker w is
expressed as
T com
i→w = bcomi→w + γucom
i→w. (15)
For the initialization of workers’ reputation values, the numbers
of positive and negative interactions between MSPs and workers
are set as 0. Then the initial reputation values of workers can
be obtained based on the above model. Based on compositive
reputation opinions, MSPs can recruit more workers with high
reputation values, promoting the finish of CDC rendering tasks.
After finishing a computing task, the MSP updates the selected
workers’ direct reputation opinions on blockchain.
B. Coalition Formation Game Formulations
In the proposed model, miners cooperate to select reliable
workers for vehicular metaverse services. To achieve suitable
cooperative strategies for miners, the coalition game theory is
used. The combination of coalition game and reputation metric
makes the coalition more multi-dimensional from the decision
making perspective. The formulated model could be suitable
than classical coalition formation game that relies only on a
single value of utility, which may not be known precisely in
reality. The cooperative worker selection problem among miners
is modeled as a coalition formation game with non-transferable
utility (NTU), which means that the value or the utility of a
coalition cannot randomly be divided between coalition mem-
bers [33] [34]. Next, we give the definition of coalition partition
for the coalition formation game.
Definition 1: A group of mutually disjoint coalitions in M
is represented as Π = {G1,G2, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}, where Go ∩
Go′ = φ for o �= o′, O is the number of coalitions. If the group
covers all the players inM, i.e.,∪O
o=1Go = M, the group is called
a coalition partition of M [35].
The proposed NTU coalition game is modeled as G =
{M,Π, u}, where M is the player set made up of miners, Π
is a coalition partition of M, and u is the utility function.
The blockchain returns the compositive reputation opinions of
the workers in the coalition with the highest utility. We denote the
coalition of miners as Go ∈ M, and o is the index of the coalition.
The worker set for the coalition Go is denoted as∪m∈Go
Wm, and
the number of workers in ∪m∈Go
Wm is denoted as |∪m∈Go
Wm|.
For the calculation of workers’ reputation opinions, the contri-
bution value of the coalition Go is expressed as
Q (Go) = ρc
|∪m∈Go
Wm|
W
+ ρr
∑
m∈Go
∑|Wm|
w=1 T com
i→w
|∪m∈Go

where |∪m∈Go
Wm|/W is the percent of workers that
the coalition Go has computed, and the second term∑
m∈Go
∑|Wm|
w=1 T com
i→w/|∪m∈Go
Wm| is the average reputation

values of workers in the coalition Go. ρc and ρr are the coef-
ficients that maintain the importance of the above two parts on
the contribution value.
The communication cost among miners increases with the
growth of the number of miners in the coalition, because forming
a miner coalition requires negotiation and information exchange
that may bring the cost and reduce the gains from forming the
coalition [36]. For the coalition Go, the communication cost
C(Go) should reflect the negotiation and information exchange
overhead, which are determined by the number of miners in the
coalition Go. The communication cost C(Go) should satisfy the
following requirements. Firstly, the communication cost C(Go)
increases monotonically with respect to |Mo| that is the number
of miners in the coalition Go. Secondly, the slope of C(Go)
becomes steeper with the increase of |Mo|. To satisfy above
requirements, the logarithmic barrier penalty function is adopted
to model the coalition cost [37]. The communication cost C(Go)
is expressed as
C (Go) =
⎧⎨
⎩
− log
(
1 −
(
|Mo|−õ
M
)2
)
, if |Mo| ≥ 2,
0, otherwise ,
(17)
where õ is used to avoid an infinite value of C(Go) when |Mo| =
M , and õ = 0.1 [37]. Then, the coalition utility of the coalition
Go is expressed as
u (Go) = Q (Go)− δC (Go) , (18)
where δ is the communication cost coefficient.
For the coalitionGo, whether the miners inGo can be rewarded
by blockchain depends on the coalition utility u(Go). We notice
that, in the proposed coalition game, the coalition utility u(Go)
is not divisible among the miners, and the utility of each miner
in the coalition Go is equal to u(Go), instead of a fraction of
u(Go). Hence, the proposed coalition formation game has non-
transferable utility. Each miner can choose the suitable coalition
based on the received utility. The definition of preference order
is given as follows.
Definition 2: A preference operator � is adopted to compare
Π1 = {G1
1 , . . . ,G1
O} and Π2 = {G2
1 , . . . ,G2
O′ } that are partitions
of the same subset A ⊆ M (i.e., the players in Π1 and Π2 are
the same). Then, Π1�Π2 implies that partition Π1 is better than
partition Π2 for subset A [38].
Different orders can be adopted to compare relationships be-
tween partitions. We adopt Pareto order in this paper to compare
the preference relation between two partitions.
Definition 3: For the two partitions Π1 = {G1
1 , . . . ,G1
O} and
Π2 = {G2
1 , . . . ,G2
O′ }, the utility of minerm in the partitionΠ1 =
{G1
1 , . . . ,G1
O} and Π2 = {G2
1 , . . . ,G2
O′ } are denoted as um(Π1)
and um(Π2), respectively. The partition Π1 is better than Π2 by
the Pareto order, which is denoted as Π1�Π2, if and only if
um (Π1) ≥ um (Π2) ∀m ⊆ Π1,Π2, (19)
with at least one strict inequality (>) for a miner m.
A coalition formation algorithm based on the simple rules of
merge and split is proposed by using the Pareto order. The coali-
tion formation process usually needs to execute many rounds,
and all the coalitions are involved in each round to make sure
Algorithm 1: Coalition formation algorithm for miners in
the proposed model:
Input: Player set M = {1, 2, . . . ,m, . . . ,M}. Workers
selected by miners Wm = {Wm,1,Wm,2, . . . ,Wm,|Wm|},
1 � m � M ;
Output: The coalition with the highest coalition utility;
1: Initialization: The initial partition of miners Π0, where
all the miners are disjoint. Each miner selects several
workers and computes selected workers’ compositive
reputation value;
2: Each coalition computes coalition utility according to
utility function (18);
3: Merge mechanism: The Coalition Go tries to merge
with Go′ based on the merge rule;
4: Split mechanism: The Coalition Go tries to split with
Go′ based on the split rule;
5: Until: Merge and split iteration terminates, and the
final coalition partition is obtained;
6: Return: The coalition with the highest coalition utility.
that the utilities of coalitions increase or remain stable. The rules
of merge and split are given as follows [39]:
1) Merge Rule: For any set of coali-
tions {G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}, where
{∪O
o=1Go}�{G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}, merge
{G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO} into {∪L
o=1Go}, which is denoted
as {G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO} → {∪O
o=1Go}.
2) Split Rule: For any coalitions ∪O
o=1Go, where
{G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}�{∪O
o=1Go}, split {∪O
o=1Go}
into {G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}, which is denoted as
{∪O
o=1Go} → {G1, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}.
The coalitions will merge or split if these actions yield a
preferred collection according to the pareto order. By using the
Pareto order, a coalition will split only if the split operation
makes at least one miner’s utility improved without decreasing
other miners’ utilities. Similarly, the coalitions will merge only if
at least one miner’s utility can be increased without hurting other
miners’ utilities. With merge-and-split rules, a stable coalition
partition can be obtained, as any coalition formation algorithm
designed with the merge-and-split rules always converges [35].
Algorithm 1 is the coalition formation algorithm for miners. In
Algorithm 1, the complexity mainly depends on the merge-and-
split process. In the worst case, the total number of merge opera-
tions is O(M 3). In practical systems, a large coalition is formed
after the first merge, so the merge operation requires a lower
number of operations. For the worst case of the split process, the
total number of split operations is given by the Bellman number,
which increases exponentially with the number of miners in
the coalition. The split operation is only performed over each
miner coalition, reducing the complexity of split operations.
In summary, the complexity of the merge-and-split process is
affordable for the practical miner coalition systems.
For the designed coalition formation gameG, the grand coali-
tion of all the miners seldom forms due to the communication
cost. Besides, the participation of miners that obtain the low
1092 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 72, NO. 1, JANUARY 2023
reputation values of workers may degrade the coalition utility,
which also prevents the grand coalition formation. Next, we use
the defection function Dhp to analyze the stability of the final
coalition partition.
Definition 4: A partition Π = {G1,G2, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO} is
stable if no coalition Go is incentivized to change the current
partitionΠ by joining another coalitionGo′ , whereGo ∩ Go′ = φ,
for o �= o′, or trying to split into smaller disjoint coalitions [35].
Definition 5: A partition of coalitions Π =
{G1,G2, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO} is Dhp-stable if it meets the following
two conditions:
1) For o ∈ {1, . . . , O} and each partition {R1, . . . , Rp} of
coalition Go, we have {R1, . . . , Rp} � �Go;
2) For S ∈ {1, . . . , O}, we have
⋃
o∈S Go � �{Go | o ∈ S}.
where � � is the opposite rule of �.
Theorem 1: The coalition partition under the proposed
scheme is Dhp-stable.
Proof: We first consider Condition 1. Π =
{G1,G2, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO} is the final partition obtained from
the coalition formation algorithm. If for o ∈ {1, . . . , O} and
any partition {R1, . . . , Rp} of Go, there is {R1, . . . , Rp}�Go,
then the partition Go will split, which is in contradiction
with the fact that Π is the stable partition resulting from the
merge-and-split iteration. For Condition 2, we still consider the
same final coalition set Π = {G1,G2, . . . ,Go, . . . ,GO}. If for
each S ∈ {1, . . . , O}, there has
⋃
o∈S Go � �{Go | o ∈ S}, then
the partition Π can be modified through the merge rule, which is
also in contradiction with the fact that Π is the stable partition.
Thus, the coalition partition under the proposed scheme is
Dhp-stable.
V. STACKELBERG GAME-BASED INCENTIVE MECHANISM FOR
VEHICULAR METAVERSE
After the worker selection phase, MSP Pi obtains the in-
formation of workers in the selected coalition Go. MSP Pi
selects N workers from the coalition Go based on workers’
reputation opinions. The set of selected workers is denoted
as Wsel = {1, 2, . . . , w, . . . , N}, and Wsel ⊆ Go. In the CDC
rendering task execution phase shown in Fig. 2, MSP Pi divides
the matrix Ai into K equal-sized submatrices R
(3×2×np)
K ×np , and
then MSP Pi has N encoded submatrices with the same size
(3×2×np)
K × np based on the (N,K) MDS code. Each submatrix
is allocated to a worker. The distributed computing resource in-
teractions between Pi and workers is modeled as a single-leader
multi-followers Stackelberg game. In the leader game, the MSP
selects an optimal computation reward to motivate workers to
execute CDC rendering tasks in the vehicular metaverse. In the
follower game, workers try to obtain higher profit by adjusting
their computing speed. The Stackelberg game model can be
extended to multiple MSPs with two approaches. The first one is
that MSPs make decisions on incentive indenpendently and they
do not affect each other as MSPs may use different applications.
The second one is that MSPs can compete with each other and
this forms a Nash game which can be investigated in the future
work.
A. Profit Function of Workers
We consider that the CDC rendering task execution mainly
contains computing the task and transmitting the computation
result to MSPPi. In the following, the profit function of workers
is studied.
In order to incentivize workers to join the CDC rendering task
actively, the MSP Pi gives the reward to workers that contribute
to vehicular metaverse services. The reward contains two kinds,
i.e., base reward Rbase and competition reward Rcom. The
workers who participate in the CDC rendering task can receive
the reward Rbase. The workers whose average task execution
time is no more than the average task execution time of the K-th
worker can receive the reward Rcom. Similar to the analysis
in [40], we assume that the task execution time of workers
follows a uniform distribution, where Tw
Tmax
∈ (0, 1), andTmax is
the maximum value of the task execution time. The normalized
task execution time of workers are ranked and represented by its
order statistics, which are expressed as T1,N , T2,N , . . . , TN,N .
TK,N is the K-th highest execution time among N workers.
The cumulative distribution function of the normalized task
execution time is F (T ) = T . The probability density function
of the normalized task execution time is f(T ) = 1. Based on the
order statistics, the probability density function of Tk,N is given
as
f(k)(T ) = Nf(T )
(
N − 1
k − 1
)
F (T )k−1(1 − F (T ))N−k,
(20)
which is also a beta distribution Beta(k,N − k + 1). Hence,
the expectation of TK,N is given as
E (TK,N ) =
K
N + 1
. (21)
The workers adopt the dynamic voltage scaling technology that
allows workers to adaptively adjust and control the computing
speed. Each selected worker tries to obtain a higher profit. The
profit function of the worker w is expressed as
uw = Rbase + PwRcom − εμwE (T cmp
w )− ζE
(
T com−u
)
,
(22)
where ε is the computing cost of the worker per CPU circle,
and ζ is the communication cost of the worker per unit of
communication time. Pw is the probability of worker w getting
the reward from MSP Pi. Pw is expressed as
Pw = 1 − e
−μw
(
E(TK,N)×Tmax−E(Tcom−u
K,N )
l −aw
)
,
= 1 − e−μwAw , (23)
where E (T com−u
K,N ) is the average communication delay of the
K-th worker, and Aw =
E(Tk,N )×Tmax−E(T com−u
k,N )
l − aw. Here,
worker w selects the optimal computing speed μw that maxi-
mizes uw.
B. Utility Function of Metaverse Service Provider
To motivate workers to contribute more to the CDC rendering
tasks, MSP Pi should adjust the reward Rcom to maximize
JIANG et al.: RELIABLE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING FOR METAVERSE: A HIERARCHICAL GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH 1093
its utility. The selected workers contribute their computing re-
sources to MSP Pi. The utility that MSP Pi can gain depends on
the computing resource that workers contribute, the reputation
values of workers, and the reward paid to the workers. The utility
function of MSP Pi is expressed as
uPi
= ν
∑N
w=1
f (μw)h (T
com
i→w)
−NRbase −
∑N
w=1
PwRcom, (24)
where ν is a weight parameter, and f(μw) = log(1 + μw),
which is the utility of MSP Pi gained from the workers’
computation contribution. The log of f(·) reflects MSP Pi’s
diminishing return on the computation speed of each selected
worker [41]. h(·) is the reputation utility of workers and is
expressed as [42]
h (T com
i→w) = α+ (1 − α) log
(
1 +
(e− 1) (T com
i→w − T com
th )
T com
max − T com

)
,
(25)
where α is the default reputation utility for the worker with
T com
i→w = T com
th , T com
th is the reputation threshold required by the
MSP. T com
max is the maximum reputation value.
C. Stackelberg Game-Based Incentive Mechanism
The interactions between the MSP and workers is formulated
as a single-leader multi-followers Stackelberg game. In the
leader game, the MSP sets the optimal computation reward
to motivate workers to execute CDC rendering tasks. In the
follower game, the coalition of workers adjust the computation
speed to maximize their profits. The strategy optimization prob-
lems for the MSP and workers are formulated as follows.
1) Workers’ computing speed strategies in Stage II: In Stage
II, based on the reward strategy of the MSP, worker w
(w ∈ Wsel) determines its computation speed μw to max-
imize the profit that is given as
uw (μw;Rcom) = Rbase + Pw (μw)Rcom
− εμwE (T cmp
w )− ζE (T com_u)
.
(26)
The set of workers’ computing speed is µ =
{μ1, . . . , μw, . . . μN}, which are used to derive the
computation delay of workers based on (7). The worker
subgame problem is expressed as follows.
Problem 1 (Worker w Subgame):
maximize
μw
uw,w∈Wsel (μw;Rcom)
subject to μ ≤ μw ≤ μ̄, (27)
where μ is the minimum computation speed, and μ̄ is the
maximum computation speed.
2) MSP’s reward strategy in Stage I: In Stage I, according
to workers’ computation speed strategies µ, the MSP
determines the reward strategy to maximize its utility that
is expressed as
uPi
(Rcom;µ) = ν
∑N
w=1
f (μw)h (T
com
i→w)−NRbase
−
∑N
w=1
PwRcom. (28)
The MSP subgame problem is expressed as follows.
Problem 2 (MSP Pi Subgame):
maximize
Rcom
uPi
(Rcom ;µ)
subject to Rcom ≤ Rcom ≤ Rcom , (29)
where Rcom is the minimum computation reward, Rcom is the
maximum computation reward.
The Stackelberg game is formulated by combining Problem
1 and Problem 2, and the goal of the Stackelberg game is to find
the Nash equilibrium solution.
D. Game Equilibrium Analysis
The Stackelberg equilibrium makes sure that the utility of the
MSP is maximized considering that the workers make comput-
ing strategies based on the best response. This means that the
computing speed strategy of each worker maximize its profit
given the strategies of the other workers and the computing
reward given by the MSP. The Stackelberg equilibrium is ex-
pressed as follows.
Definition 6: We denote µ∗ and R∗
com as the optimal com-
putation speed of all the selected workers and optimal compu-
tation reward given by the MSP, respectively. Then, the strategy
(µ∗,R∗
com) is the Stackelberg equilibrium if we have
uPi
(R∗

, ∀w ∈ Wsel.
(31)
The backward induction is adopted to analyze the Stackelberg
game.
1) Workers’ Optimal Strategies as Equilibrium in Stage II:
Based on the reward strategy Rcom given by the MSP, the
workers determine the optimal computation speed strategy for
profit maximization in Stage II.
Theorem 2: The sub-game perfect equilibrium in the workers’
subgame is unique.
Proof: We give the first-order and second-order derivatives
of the profit function of workers uw(·) with respect to worker’s
strategy μw. The first-order derivative of uw(·) is shown as
∂uw
∂μw
= RcomAwe

∂2uw
∂μw

As the second-order derivative of uw(·) is negative, so the
profit function uw(·) is strictly concave with respect to worker’s
computing speed strategy μw. Besides, based on the first-order
derivative condition, there is
∂uw
∂μw

the MSP’s utility function always satisfies
∂2uPi
∂R2
com
< 0, which
indicates that uPi
is a concave function. Thus, the MSP has
a unique optimal solution that can be efficiently obtained by
bisection method [44]. Based on the optimal strategy of the
MSP, the workers’ optimal strategies can be obtained. Then, the
Stackelberg equilibrium can be obtained in the proposed model.
The MSP can achieve optimal utility and workers can obtain
optimal profit, and neither of them would alter their strategies
to gain higher benefits.
We design Algorithm 2 to obtain the unique Stackelberg
equilibrium for the proposed game. In algorithm 2, the MSP
first searches the optimal reward strategy, and the complexity is
O(log2(Rcom −Rcom)). Then, each worker needs to decide its
optimal computing speed strategy, the complexity is O(N). So
the algorithm complexity is O(N) +O(log2(Rcom −Rcom)).
Stackelberg equilibrium is utilized to prove the stability of the
Stackelberg game. The definition of Stackelberg equilibrium is
given in Definition 6. For the follower subgame, the optimal
computing strategy of CDC workers is calculated by closed-form
expressions, so the computing strategy µ∗ is always optimal
and the condition uw(μ

always holds. For the leader subgame, the bisection algorithm
is employed to obtain the reward solution of the MSP, which is
optimal and always satisfies uPi
(R∗

(Rcom;µ∗).
Hence, the proposed Stackelberg game is stable [45].
VI. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we give the numerical results of the coalition
game-based worker selection and stackelberg game-based in-
centive mechanism for reliable CDC in the vehicular metaverse.
The parameter values are given in Table I [14] [27].
A. Numerical Results for Reliable Worker Selection
For the reputation calculation scheme, we consider an unreli-
able worker that performs well to all MSPs to increase its reputa-
tion value to 0.8 at first, and keeps such reputation value for a cer-
tain period of time. Then, the unreliable worker keeps perform-
ing well to several specific MSPs, but misbehaves to other MSPs

with the probability of 90%. The proposed blockchain-enabled
reputation scheme is compared with the reputation scheme with-
out blockchain, and the reputation scheme without blockchain
and recommended opinions. For the reputation scheme without
blockchain, such as the reputation scheme in [46], workers’
reputation values are all stored in centralized platforms in which
unreliable workers’ negative interaction behaviors are manip-
ulated into positive interaction behaviors with the probability
of 25%. For the reputation scheme without blockchain and
recommended opinions, workers’ reputation values only depend
on MSPs’ local reputation opinions.Fig. 4 shows the reputation
values variation of an unreliable worker over time, and the unit of
time is minute. From Fig. 4, when the unreliable worker begins to
misbehave, the reputation value significantly decreases with the
proposed blockchain-enabled reputation scheme. For the reputa-
tion scheme without blockchain, the reputation value decreases
more slowly than that of the reputation scheme with blockchain.
As the centralized platform manipulate the unreliable workers’
negative interactions into positive interactions, which increases
the unreliable worker’s reputation value. For the reputation
scheme without the blockchain and recommended opinions, the
reputation value of unreliable worker still increases. Because
the unreliable worker may only act honestly for a specific MSP
and act maliciously for other MSPs, and the specific MSP
computes the unreliable worker’s reputation value based on the
local observation that does not contain the misbehavior of the
unreliable worker.
Next, we analyze the coalition formation game. We set the
number of positive and negative interaction events as [0, 120],
and [0, 40], respectively. Then compositive reputation values of
workers are calculated by miners based on the subjective logical
model. Fig. 5 shows the average reputation value of the selected
workers as a function of the misbehavior ratio. Misbehavior ratio
is the percentage of workers with negative interactions toward
MSPs to the total number of workers. From Fig. 5, compared
Fig. 5. Average reputation values as function of misbehavior ratio.
Fig. 6. Number of selected workers as function of misbehavior ratio.
with the scheme without coalition game, the selected workers’
average reputation value of the proposed scheme decreases
slightly with the growth of misbehavior ratio. The misbehavior
ratio has little effect on the average reputation value of workers
in the selected worker coalition, as the coalition game-based
method helps to exclude the workers with low reputation values.
When the weight of positive event σ1 is fixed, the number
of miners joining in the reputation calculation does not affect
the average reputation values of selected workers. When the
misbehavior ratio is fixed, the selected workers’ average repu-
tation value increases with the increase of σ1. Fig. 6 shows the
number of selected workers as a function of misbehavior ratio.
From Fig. 6, the number of selected workers decreases with
the rise of misbehavior ratio. When the misbehavior ratio is
fixed, the number of selected workers increases with the growth

of the number of miners. As more miners can calculate more
workers’ reputation values, which is benefical to the reliable
worker selection.
B. Numerical Analysis for CDC Incentive Scheme
In this section, according to the reliable worker selection
results obtained from coalition formation game, we analyze the
numerical results of Stackelberg game-based CDC incentive
mechanism in the vehicular metaverse. We assume that the
strat-up time of workers follows the normal distribution. Fig. 7
and Fig. 8 show the effects of the size of rendering matrix on the
reward given by the MSP and utility of the MSP, respectively.
From Fig. 7, the reward given by the MSP increases with the
size of rendering matrix. When the number of returned results
K is fixed, a higher value of N results in higher reward given
by the MSP. When N is fixed, the reward decreases with the

matrix.

growth of K. As the increase of K means that the MSP needs to
reward more workers, which makes the reward reduced. From
Fig. 8, the utility of the MSP increases slightly with the size of
rendering matrix. A higher value of N results in higher utility
for the MSP, which means that more workers’ participation is
beneficial to the MSP. However, a higher value of K makes the
utility of the MSP reduced. This indicates that the MSP can
achieve higher utility with the CDC scheme, as the MSP obtains
the final computing result when receiving the computing results
from K workers, and K < N .
Figs. 9 and 10 show the effects of the size of rendering matrix
on the selected workers’ average computation speed and average
profit, respectively. From Fig. 9, the average computation speed
of workers increases with the size of rendering matrix. When
K is fixed, a higher value of N results in higher average
computation speed, as the workers need to increase their speed to

obtain the competition reward. When N is fixed, a higher value
ofK results in lower average computation speed. This is because
the increase of K reduces the competitiveness among workers.
From Fig. 10, with the growth of the size of rendering matrix,
the average profit of selected workers first increases to a peak
point and then decreases. This indicates that when workers face
many rendering tasks with different sizes, workers can choose to
execute tasks that can maximize their profits. When K is fixed,
the increase of N makes the workers’ average utility increased.
This is mainly because the MSP gives more reward when N
increases. When the size of rendering matrix is less than 3300
for N = 45 and 3500 for N = 40, a lower value of K results in
higher average profit of workers. Otherwise, a higher value of
K results in higher average profit of workers.
Fig. 11 shows the utility of the MSP as a function of the
workers’ average start-up time considering different values of
computing cost ε and relative vehicle speed |Δv| between
workers and the MSP. As shown in Fig. 11, the utility of the
MSP decreases linearly with the increase of the workers’ average
start-up time. Besides, when the average start-up time is fixed,
the utility of the MSP decreases with the increase of ε and |Δv|.
Fig. 12 shows the average profit of workers as a function of
the workers’ average start-up time considering different values
of ε and |Δv|. From Fig. 12, with the increase of the average
start-up time, the average profit of workers first increases to a
peak point and then decreases. The workers can select a suitable
start-up time to execute the computing tasks from the MSP.
When the average start-up time is fixed, the average profit of
workers decreases with the growth of ε, and increases with the
growth of |Δv|. From the above analysis, we obtain that the
relative vehicle speed between workers and the MSP degrades
the utility of MSP.
Then, we compare the proposed scheme with the baseline
schemes, i.e., the pre-defined worker selection scheme and
best-effort worker selection scheme. In the pre-defined worker
selection scheme, we pre-select a fixed number of workers based
on certain criteria, such as their similarity [47]. In the best-effort

worker selection scheme that is similar to [48], any workers
available will be allowed to join the CDC process. The difference
of computation complexity between the proposed scheme and
baseline schemes mainly depends on the coalition formation
game. From the complexity analysis of the miner coalition for-
mation game in Section IV, the complexity of the coalition for-
mation process is affordable. As the number of miners is not very
large for the blockchain system, the complexity of the proposed
scheme is further reduced. When the reputation values of work-
ers is lower than the reputation threshold T com

utility of the worker is expressed as h(T com

[42]. Fig. 13 shows the utility of the MSP as a function of
the number of selected workers N under different schemes.
From Fig. 13, the utility of the MSP increases with N under
all schemes. The utility of the MSP under the proposed reliable
CDC scheme is higher than those under the pre-defined worker
selection scheme and best-effort worker selection scheme. The
utility of the MSP has been increased by 17% compared with the
best-effort worker selection scheme. Fig. 14 shows the average

profit of the selected workers as a function of N under different
schemes. From Fig. 14, the average profit of workers increases
with the increase of N under all schemes. The average profit of
workers under the proposed reliable CDC scheme is higher than
those under the pre-defined worker selection scheme and best-
effort worker selection scheme. The average profit of workers
has been increased by 14% compared with the best-effort worker
selection scheme. From Figs. 13 and 14, we conclude that the
proposed reliable CDC scheme enables both MSP and workers
to obtain higher benefits than the pre-defined worker selection
scheme and best-effort worker selection scheme. The reason
is that blockchain helps the MSP select reliable CDC work-
ers, including the decentralized management and computing of
workers’ reputation values. Then, the MSP can motivate reliable
CDC workers to contribute to CDC rendering tasks based on
the Stackelberg game. Although the complexity of the proposed
scheme is slightly higher than that of baseline schemes, the
positive interactions between the MSP and CDC workers can
maximize both players’ payoffs.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a distributed computing framework is proposed
for the vehicular metaverse based on CDC and blockchain. The
subjective logical model is used to compute the reputation values
of vehicles. A hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework is
proposed for the vehicular metaverse, the coalition formation
game is combined with the reputation metric in the upper layer
to select reliable workers, and the Stackelberg game is designed
in the lower layer to incentivize workers to join the CDC ren-
dering tasks. Finally, the proposed CDC reliable worker incen-
tive mechanism is simulated and analyzed. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed reliable CDC scheme is resistant to
malicious workers and is suitable for the decentralized CDC
in the vehicular metaverse. The utility of the MSP has been
increased by 17%, and the average profit of workers has been
increased by 14% compared with the best-effort worker selection
scheme. In future works, the performance of wireless metaverse
services might be studied.
