,e study proposes a supply chain contractual coordination model based on the product lifecycle information sharing effort and
consumers’ price sensitivity to a product with the Blockchain system. ,is paper examined the following five scenarios: (1)
centralized supply chain with Blockchain system-based product lifecycle information sharing investment; (2) Stackelberg leader
retailer processed and invested Blockchain system scenario; (3) retailer processed the Blockchain system cost-sharing scenario; (4)
retailer processed Blockchain system investment through bargaining the revenue-sharing model; (5) Blockchain system in-
vestment under the cost and revenue-sharing contract. ,e study used the game theory reverse induction method to compare the
Nash equilibrium solutions under different decision-making scenarios and discussed the chain member’s constraint condition of
Blockchain system investment. We simulated and analysed the products’ lifecycle information sharing effort cost factor, the
influence of price sensitivity coefficient, and expected profits of the supplier and retailer. ,e study results show that the product
lifecycle information sharing effort under the Blockchain system increases the profit of the whole chain and decreases with the
increase of customer’s price sensitivity coefficient.
1. Introduction
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is concerned with efficient
management of the financial, material, and information flows
among supply chain (SC) members [1]. ,e researchers are
developing SC coordination, integration, and collaboration
subjectmodeswith forward or reverse stream strategies between
different economic institutions to improve the overall perfor-
mance of SC. In a decentralized SC, upstream supplier and
downstream chain member, as independent decision maker,
make each decision focusing on its own profit. At the same time,
as a member in the value chain, their decisions and behaviors
are mutually influenced. ,e behavioral preferences are af-
fecting the decision-making of each chain member. ,e be-
havioral preferences will lead to unperformed decision-making
which will cause the traditional win-lose strategy and deviates
from total SC profit maximization [2]. It is imperative that the
decentralized SC members make decisions together in an effort
to minimize overall total cost and maximize total profit by
customer satisfaction [3]. To improve overall performance, the
SC members may behave as a part of the unified system and
coordinate with each other under joint strategical decisions.
,us “coordination” comes into focus [4].,emost commonly
accepted definition of the coordination in the SCM literature is
“the act ofmanaging dependencies between chainmembers and
the joint effort of members working together towards mutually
defined goals” [5]. ,e coordination of a strategic SC can be
achieved by the independent segment of coordination such as
“information systems’ coordination,” “logistics processes’ co-
ordination,” and “contractual coordination” (financial trade-
off’s) [6]. Information sharing system coordination is necessary
to support critical business decisions that may impact to price,
quality, cost, availability, lead time, and profit share. Infor-
mation flow is on both directions from the upstream chain
members to the downstream chain consumers or conversely
from downstream to the upstream. Information is available

from a single source, often from the carrier, and information
sharingmostly depends on contractual responsibility with other
chain members [7]. Additionally, different products flow
consists of different information priority such as quality con-
ditions, product availability, service level, market price, and even
actual market potential (for more details, see [8]). As an ex-
ample, the eggs are classified by theUnited StatesDepartment of
Agriculture based on their external appearance and quality
condition information, mostly priority of information sharing
under the retailer’s advantage. In the European Union, eggs are
not based on their external appearance but on their used
farming methods (conventional or organic, barn range, free-
range) [9].
,is study focuses on SC contractual coordination with
Blockchain system-based proper lifecycle information
sharing effort. Our model is based on the influence of
product lifecycle information sharing effort and consumers’
price sensitivity. ,e Nash equilibrium solution of the SCs is
obtained by reverse induction method. ,e decisions of
Blockchain system investment between the different con-
tracts are analysed and compared with the centralized SC
optimal decision. Finally, the constraints of the member’s
choice of blockchain investment are given, and the influence
of the Blockchain system cost coefficient and the price
sensitivity coefficient on the decision-making behaviors and
expected profits of the suppliers and retailers are simulated.
,is paper further enriches the theoretical achievements on
the SC contractual coordination and Blockchain system
investigation. ,e paper is organized as follows. Section 2
provides the model establishment, assumptions, and no-
menclature. Section 3 presents the various models’ analysis
under the BS investment and we also propose the fifth case as
a BS cost sharing with revenue-sharing model. Section 4 and
5 provides the numerical study, comparison, and simulation
analysis of the five cases. In Section 6, conclusion and di-
rection of future research are given.
2. Literature Review
Only very recently were there some other new approaches
introduced to the SCM practice. ,e available studies in-
troduced and developed the Blockchain-based systems in a
SC where the Blockchain system (BS) is a new solution for
data management among SC members. Blockchain tech-
nology has been initially applied to the SC information
system coordination segments such as international pay-
ment [10], healthcare [11], electric energy supply [12], and
education [13] and even in logistics process traceability
systems coordination [14]. ,e new decentralized trace-
ability system based on Internet of ,ings (IoT) and the
Blockchain technology will support SC products visibility in
the physical distribution phase via proper real-time infor-
mation sharing under the safety status of products. Addi-
tionally, Blockchain technologies reduce the risk of
information sharing and data systems and bring more se-
curity to the information flow among all SC members. ,e
applications of IoT and Blockchain technologies are mainly
focused on the consumer, industrial, and public sectors.
Most of the recent interest has mainly focused on the
consumer appliances. ,e industrial applications are
promising to improve operational management outcomes in
different fields of industries [15]. Utilization and develop-
ment of Blockchain technology with IoT in back and forward
information flows of a SC would effectively guarantee the
trusted coordination, by gathering, transferring, and sharing
the authentic data in planning, processing, distributing, and
selling links [16]. As information sharing technology de-
velops, the other coordination mechanisms such as con-
tractual coordination of SC will be adopted accordantly. ,e
activities transformed by the Blockchain system will lead to
the costly efforts; total profit of SC will rise in the stochastic
markets due to both higher sales volume and higher retail
prices. At the same time, the benefits from these systematic
examinations under contractual coordination remain un-
clear, as does sharing of its cost and profit among the SC
members. None of the literature on SCM has discussed these
interesting and trusted Blockchain technology benefits
under contractual coordination theories until now.
3. Model Description, Assumptions,
and Parameters
,is section derives the model establishment and nomen-
clature. In this study, the terms of Blockchain system,
blockchain technology, blockchain (BS), and information
system have been used interchangeably to mean the proper
lifecycle information sharing effort.
3.1. Model Description and Establishment. ,e study focuses
on sharing contractual coordination with Blockchain sys-
tem-based product proper lifecycle information sharing
effort. ,e paper investigates a two-stage SC consisting of a
supplier who sells the products to a retailer and the retailer
who sells the supplier’s products to consumers. Consumers
are sensitive to the product price and product “Lifecycle
Information Trustworthy” (LIT) and need to consider both
the product price and the LIT level when buying products.
To satisfy the consumers’ demand with product LIT level,
the retailer puts efforts by the adoption of new BT. In order
to obtain the model demand function, we adopt the
framework established by Ghosh and Shah’s [17] and Song
and Gao [18]. To further expand the study, we make a
distinct category of study, investigating them according to
their LIT level under BS investment. We need to define the
meaning of “Product Lifecycle,” “Lifecycle Information,”
“Trustworthy,” and “Blockchain system” in this model.
(i) “Product Lifecycle” demonstrates “the series of
stages and functional activities through which a
product passes from the point of origin to the point
of consumption” and it is mainly based on time and
the proper value-added chain members.
(ii) “Lifecycle Information” describes the jointly col-
lected data of product’s specific information which
interchanges between the series of stages and
functional activities from the point of origin to the
point of consumption.
2 Journal of Advanced Transportation
(iii) “Trustworthy” is used to indicate “the value of
customer’s perspective in order to optimize cus-
tomer utility.” From customers’ perspective, they
are much worried about having product lifecycle
information as proper as possible with products that
may have an impact on health.
(iv) In our study, the definition of “Blockchain system”
defines as a new decentralized information sharing
technology, which can store the product Lifecycle
Information in the chain of blocks. Specific infor-
mation of a product can be stored in a shared system
for the all SC participants including customers.
3.2. Assumptions and Nomenclature. We assume that the SC
members can influence the market demand by exerting the
Blockchain system-based product proper lifecycle information
sharing effort. To address this issue, we consider a SC model
consisting of an upstream supplier and a downstream retailer.
,emodel in this paper is based on the following assumptions.
Hypothesis 1. ,e supplier provides a product to the retailer
at wholesale price and the retailer sells product to consumer
at retail price. We assume that consumers are different in the
valuation of the product’s proper lifecycle information
trustworthy. We denote the “Lifecycle Information Trust-
worthy” level (alternatively called “LIT”), and for analytic
simplicity we assume in the range of [0, 1], with β � 0 and a
density of β � 1 representing the consumer satisfaction,
where the range of [0, 1] represents a “partial availability”
and “full online availability” of product’s lifecycle infor-
mation, respectively.
Hypothesis 2. ,e cost of the BS invested takes the form of
Ιβ2, where Ι is the BS investment parameter and Ι > 0.
Hypothesis 3. Total demand during the season is stochastic
and sensitive to the product price and product LIT. Con-
sumer’s sensitivity forces to consider both the product price
and the product LIT level. Consumers preference is to get
informed about product proper lifecycle, and when the LIT
level of a product is higher, and the product price is lower,
the product sales are greater. ,e actual market place de-
mand q is a linear function of the product price and product
LIT level; at this point the demand function is expressed as
qp,β � a − bp + θβ. (1)
Hypothesis 4. Consumer products can replace each other in
the market with and without Blockchain system-based
lifecycle information.
Hypothesis 5. ,e retailer is the leader and the supplier is the
follower.
We make the following parameters and meanings
(Table 1):
4. The Models
In this section, the following scenarios are presented under
the Stackelberg leader (SL) and Stackelberg follower (SF)
power structures. For the comparison, we first examined a
benchmark centralized SC model, which is known as the
vertical integration model. ,e second is a decentralized SC
scenario, where the retailer is a SL with passive SF supplier
structural observation. ,e third scenario is the decentral-
ized decision mode with Blockchain system cost sharing
when the retailer is a SL and the supplier is a SF, similar to
[17]. ,rough the fourth scenario, we examined RS via
bargaining model, similar to [18]. ,e fifth scenario presents
the Blockchain system-based strategical approach via cost
sharing as well as with revenue sharing among the SC
members under the SL retailer structure.
4.1. Case 1: Centralized SC Mode with Blockchain System
(A Benchmark). In the centralized SC scenario, where the
sales margin m takes form of m � p − c, the game model
interdependence is no longer treated with contractual co-
ordination but rather treated as one entity to get an optimal
profit. ,e single decision-maker exerts the Blockchain
system-based product proper lifecycle information sharing
effort and sets the optimal price to maximize the whole
centralized SC profit. ,e profit function in the centralized
SC with BS investment is expressed as
πsc
1 � [(p − w) +(w − c)]q − Iβ2 � (p − c)(a − bp + θβ) − Iβ2.

Taking the first and second partial derivatives of equa-
tion (2)with respect to m and β, and by setting the first
derivatives of m1 and β1 equal to zero, we find that optimal
β∗1 , p∗1 , and m∗1 are

4.2. Case 2: BS Based Information Sharing Effort under the
Retailer Stackelberg Leadership. In the decentralized SC
scenario, the supplier and retailer are making their decisions
interdependently. In this decentralized decision-making
structure, the retailer as a SL and the supplier as a passive SF
mode is examined. Because of asymmetry information, the
market demand trustworthy (satisfaction) level is available
for the downstream retailer and it is simply based on cus-
tomers’ experience of retention. ,e retailer as a SL exerts
the Blockchain system-based product proper lifecycle in-
formation sharing effort and sets the selling price to max-
imize own profit. Accordingly, the supplier as a SF sets
wholesale price. At this point, the profit functions of the SF
supplier and SL retailer in the decentralized SC scenario with
BS investment are given by
πs
2 � (w − c)q � (w − c)(a − b(m + w) + θβ), (7)
πr
2 � (p − w)q − Iβ2 � (p − w)(a − b(m + w) + θβ) − Iβ2.
(8)
,e total profit function of the whole decentralized SC
with BS investment in any case is
πsc
n � πr
n + πs
n � pn − c( 􏼁 a − bpn + θβn( 􏼁 − Iβ2n. (9)
First, we solve the profit function for the SF supplier. In this
case, the SL retailer’s sales margin is m � p − w; using the
inverse induction method, we obtain first and second deriv-
atives of equation (7) and set the first derivative equal to zero:
w2 �
(a + bc − bm + θβ)
2b
. (10)
Next, we solve the profit function for the supplier from
equation (8) by obtaining the first and second partial de-
rivatives with respect to m2 and β2; then, we set the first
derivatives equal to zero and get optimal values of m∗2 and β

β∗2 �
θ(a − bc)

m

(11)
We are putting the optimal values of m∗2 and β∗2 into
equations (1) and (10); therefore, our optimal retailor price is

(12)
Finally, we are substituting all the optimal values into
equations (7)–(9) and getting the maximum profits for the
supplier πs
2, retailer π

2 . Specific values
are listed in Table 2.
4.3. Case 3: BS Based Effort Cost Sharing under the Retailer
Stackelberg LeaderMode. In the decentralized SC scenarios,
the supplier’s and retailer’s total profit are less than the
centralized SC and the BS based product lifecycle infor-
mation sharing effort is lower. ,erefore, to achieve the
optimal product proper lifecycle information sharing in a
decentralized SC, the SL must invest a higher BS investment.
However, the game follower may not be motivated to invest
for the BS based information sharing. To address this case
issue, the cost sharing contractual coordination is presented
to the decentralized SC with BS, similar to [17]. ,e retailer
as a SL invests a higher BS investment with two main pa-
rameters: retailer’s paid wholesale price w3 and the retailer’s
cost sharing coefficient ϑ3. In this case, the profit functions of
the SF supplier and SL retailer with BS cost-sharing contract
are as follows:
πs
3 � w3 − c( 􏼁q − 1 − ϑ3( 􏼁Iβ2 � w3 − c( 􏼁(a − bp + θβ) − 1 − ϑ3( 􏼁Iβ2,
(13)
πr
3 � p − w3( 􏼁q − ϑ3Iβ
2
� p − w3( 􏼁(a − b(p + m) + θβ) − ϑ3Iβ
2
.
(14)
First, we solve the profit function for the retailer where
the retailer’s sales margin is m � p − w; using the inverse
induction method, we obtain first and second derivatives
from equation (14) and set the first derivatives equal to zero:
w3 �
a + bc − bm + θβ
2b
,
q3 �
a − bc − bm + θβ
2
.
(15)
Next, we solve the profit function for the supplier from
equation (13) by obtaining the first and second partial de-
rivatives with respect to w3 and β3; then, we set the first
derivatives equal to zero and get optimal values of w∗3 and β
∗
3 :

. (16)
In this case, the supplier has significant motivation to
participate in LIT sharing effort investment because portion
of cost will be shared by the retailer. Let the optimal LIT level
be the same as in the centralized SC:

4.4. Case 4: Retailer’s BS Investment under the Revenue-
Sharing Contract via Bargaining. In the decentralized SC
scenarios, the supplier’s and retailer’s total profit are less
than the centralized SC and the BS based lifecycle infor-
mation sharing effort is lower. ,erefore, to achieve the
optimal product lifecycle information sharing in a decen-
tralized SC, the SL must invest a higher BS investment.
However, the game follower may not be motivated to invest
for the BS-based information sharing. To address this case
issue, the cost-sharing contractual coordination is presented
to the decentralized SC with BS, similar to [18].
When the retailer as a SL invests a higher BS investment,
the bargaining RS contract includes two parameters: re-
tailer’s paid wholesale price w4 and the retailer’s cost-sharing
coefficient φ4. In this case, the profit functions of the SF
supplier and SL retailer with BS cost sharing are as follows:
πs
4 � (w − c)(a − bp + θβ) + 1 − φ4( 􏼁(p − w)(a − bp + θβ),
(18)
πr
4 � φ4(p − w)q − Iβ2 � φ4(p − w)(a − b(p + m) + θβ) − Iβ2.
(19)
First, we solve the profit function for the retailer where
the retailer’s sales margin is m � p − w; using the inverse
induction method, we obtain first and second derivatives
from equation (19) and set the first derivatives equal to zero:
p4 �
a + bw + θβ
2b
. (20)
Next, we solve the profit function for the supplier from
equation (18) by obtaining the first and second partial de-
rivatives with respect to w4 and β4; then, we set the first
derivatives equal to zero and get optimal values of w∗4 and β

(21)
We are putting the optimal values into equation (20);
therefore, our optimal retailor price is

2Ia + 4φ2Ia + 2Ibc − cθ2

To get the value of φ∗4 through cost-sharing contract, we
used the approach proposed by [17, 19]:

4.5.Case5:BSCost andRevenue-SharingModelunderRetailer
Stackelberg Leadership. In this case, a decentralized SC
scenario under the retailer SL structure presents the
Blockchain system investment via cost sharing as well as
with revenue-sharing model.
We assume that the leader maximizes the profit of the
whole SC as an effort added coordinator, and we use rev-
enue-sharing contract to coordinate the retailer’s and sup-
plier’s decision-making. In other words, the supplier is
committed to providing the retailer a lower wholesale price
w, while the retailer is committed to returning a certain
percentage (1 − ϕ5) of sales revenue to the supplier for
making up for the supplier’s profit loss due to the lower
wholesale price. ,e position w5 < c guarantees channel
coordination whereas ϕ5 determines the distribution of total
profits between the supplier and retailer. ϕ5 is the SC profit
quota gained by the retailer [20]. ,e profit functions of the
supplier and the retailer in this decentralized SC with BS
investment cost and revenue-sharing model scenario are
given by
πs

First, we solve the profit function for the retailer where
the retailer’s sales margin is m � p − w; using the inverse
induction method, we obtain first and second derivatives
from equation (8) and set the first derivatives equal to zero:
m5 �
a − wb + θβ

. (27)
Next, we solve the profit function for the supplier from
equation (24) by obtaining the first and second partial de-
rivatives with respect to w5 and β5; then, we set the first
derivatives equal to zero and get optimal values of w∗5 and β

Finally, we are substituting all the optimal values into
equations (9), (24), and (25) and getting the maximum
profits for the supplier, retailer, and the whole SC under case
5. Specific values are listed in Table 2.
5. Comparison and Simulation Analysis
In order to obtain valuable conclusions and efficiency of the
models, we use MATLAB software in this section. We ex-
plore the effects of different parameters on the decision-
making behaviors and profits of SC members with the
numerical values. We assume that the consumers sensitivity
to price b is uniformly distributed within the consumer
sensitivity from 0 to 1, with a density of 1, similar to [21]. In
order to present the simulation within the feasibility region,
we assign the values to parameters with changes to the
similar researches of Ghosh and Shah’s [17] and Song and
Gao [18]. In the numerical example, the market potential a is
known and forecasted for the single period. We set the
parameters from Table 3 into previously analysed scenarios:
5.1. Comparison. We compare the cost coefficient of life-
cycle information sharing effort, the consumer’s price
sensitivity coefficient, and expected profits of the suppliers
and the retailers.,e values of the parameters and the results
under the five cases are summarized in Table 2.
Based on the above five models’ optimal decision vari-
ables and total profits comparison, we can derive the fol-
lowing propositions.
Proposition 1. Ae LIT level of a product is on the highest
level under the centralized SC’s effort added case and on the
lowest level under the bargaining RS model and the decen-
tralized SC SL effort added case model. Ae LIT level of the
product under the cost and revenue-sharing contract is higher
than that under the decentralized SC case, SL retailer cost-
sharing case, and the bargaining revenue-sharing case.
Under the cost and revenue-sharing contract if consumers’
sensitivity to the price is greater, the coordinate of SC will be
difficult. However, if consumers’ sensitivity to the LIT is
greater, the SC with BS investment will be easy to coordinate

Proposition 2. When the cost-sharing coefficient ϑ3 is equal
to the revenue-sharing coefficient ϕ5, the SC with BS in-
vestment can be coordinated and win-win situation among
the chain members can be achieved via the BS cost and
revenue-sharing contract. If the BS investment cost and
revenue-sharing contract is satisfying ϑ3 � ϕ5, then the SC
with BS investment can be coordinated. Ae total profit of the
SC with BS investment is largest under centralized control
conditions and smallest under decentralized SL retailer SC
decision-making conditions. Profitability under the cost and
revenue-sharing contract is higher and conducive to con-
sumers satisfaction with LIT preference.

vestment cost and revenue-sharing contract is

,en, we compare the SC profit under cost and revenue-
sharing contract with other cases in the decentralized SC and
benchmark SC; we got πsc2 < πsc3 < πsc4 < πsc
5 < πsc
1 ; thus, we can
see SC with the BS investment cost and revenue-sharing
contract is more efficient with higher profit compared to the
other cases. □
5.2. Simulation Analysis. We simulate the consumer’s price
sensitivity coefficient b, the lifecycle information sharing
effort level under BS β, and the influence of sensitivity
coefficients on the decision-making behaviors and expected
profits of the suppliers and the retailers. To see the sensitivity
of our results, we plot the optimal values of the parameters
and the results shown in Figures 1–4. Figure 1 indicates the
impacts of price sensitivity and BS-based LIT level on the
expected profits of the retailers under four cases. Figure 3
shows the impact of the price sensitivity coefficient and BS-
based LIT level on the expected profits of the suppliers.
Figure 4 shows the impact of price sensitivity and BS-based
LIT level on the expected profits of SCs under the various
scenarios. As can be seen from Figure 4, the suppliers and
retailers profit is comparatively higher than the other
models.
To see both sensitivity performances in our model, we
illustrate the model under the effects of consumers’ sensi-
tivity b and β on SC profit and the results are shown in
Figure 2. It can be seen that, in case of SC’s BS investment,
the profit of whole chain increases with the increase of the
LIT level and the SC profit decreases with the increase of
customer’s price sensitivity.
6. Conclusions and Future Research
,is paper examined two-stage SC consisting of a supplier
and a retailer where the retailer is the leader. ,e following
five scenarios were examined: a benchmark model where
there is a single decision-maker; a decentralized model via
retailer invested lifecycle information sharing effort; a

cost-sharing model under retailer SL; a bargaining RSmodel
under retailer SL; the cost and revenue-sharing model under
retailer SL. ,e paper constructs a SC model based on
product proper lifecycle information sharing effort cost
coefficient, consumer’s price sensitivity coefficient with the
decision-making behaviors, and expected profits of SC
members. With the help of game theory, the Nash equi-
librium solution of the SC under different circumstances is
obtained. Total SC profit of the five models is solved by
reverse induction method, and the results are compared and
analysed. Our study is providing incentives to the upstream
SC by proper sharing of its cost and revenue simultaneously.
In addition, cost and revenue-sharing coordination mech-
anism will give sustainability to building long-term rela-
tionships between the members of decentralized SC. Our
future research will focus on investigation of the models in
different industries with uncertain demand to understand
the impact of the product and process information sharing
via BS. Future research could focus on the global distribution
of demand to minimize the risk among multiple competing
members.
