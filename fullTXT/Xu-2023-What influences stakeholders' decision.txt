Abstract
Purpose –The quality liability of prefabricated components (PCs) is amajor issue among key stakeholders. The
blockchain-based quality tracking systems are supposed to support a more transparent and trusting quality
control process. However, many factors affect the stakeholders’ willingness toward the adoption of such quality
tracking systems. The purpose of this research is to investigate the key factors that influence the stakeholders’
adoption decisions toward the application of the quality tracking system in PCs and develop coping strategies.
Design/methodology/approach – An evolutionary game model is established that includes the
manufacturer, constructor and developer. Four scenarios of equilibriums and the game’s evolutionary stable
strategies are analyzed, and the corresponding stability conditions are then obtained. Based on the tripartite
game model, two representative projects are used as case studies to simulate how different factors affect the
stakeholders’ decisions.
Findings –First, trade-offs between cost and benefits were themost prominent factor in the adoption decision-
making. Second, the advancement of technologies would compensate for their immaturity. Third, subsidy and
penalty provision of the developer and high-level trust both incentivize the stakeholders to adopt the quality
tracking systems.
Originality/value – This research investigates the influence of technology, environment and participant
related factors on the adoption decisions of the quality tracking system for PCs and discovered that technology
maturity and advancement played an essential role. It is expected that the research findings would be of value
to policy makers and project management personnel for better quality control of prefabricated construction.

and quality, including precast technologies and prefabrication construction (Wang and
Sinha, 2021). Compared to traditional construction, prefabrication construction may shorten
project duration, increases safety performance and reduces material waste by changing the
workflow (Li et al., 2014; Killingsworth et al., 2020). Prefabrication construction was also
supposed to help improve construction quality. However, due to new members (such as
component manufacturers) are induced in the supply chain, product quality accountability
become more complex than the traditional construction. The prefabricated component (PC)
splits the processes into three parts, namely off-site manufacture, transportation and on-site
assembly (Amin et al., 2012), as well as four activities, namely, design, production,
transportation and assembly (Zhang et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020c). Therefore, more interfaces
lead to more complex interactions between the stakeholders (Luo et al., 2020a) and caused
more liability issues and claims when quality failure happens.
Advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) have made the quality of
PCsmore recordable and controllable (Ji et al., 2020). Laser scanning and building information
modeling (BIM) in quality inspections reveal errors for precast concrete components and
structures (Kim et al., 2016); amultidimensional Internet of Things-enabled BIMplatformwas
developed for real-time visibility and tracking in prefabrication construction (Zhong et al.,
2017). Recently, blockchain technology was also applied in the quality tracking system
(Sheng et al., 2020) and could tackle the shortage of trustworthy information resources in the
precast supply chain (Shou et al., 2017). As a technological system of distributed registers,
blockchains have the advantage of efficiency increase of investment and construction
stakeholders’ interaction (Ablyazov and Petrov, 2019).
Although the tracking system is seen to be effective to ensure quality and clarify the
responsibilities among stakeholders (Zhang et al., 2020), the stakeholders’ decision to adopt
the quality tracking system is influenced by many factors such as cost (Choe et al., 2008),
benefit (Heyder et al., 2012), information quality (Yuan et al., 2020), client’s requirements,
government supervision (Qian et al., 2020), technologymaturity (Nie and Luo, 2019) and so on
(Gumusburun Ayalp and Ay, 2020). Participating stakeholders tend to apply the quality
tracking system when the benefits outweigh costs, and when the technology develops with
lower costs and higher maturity levels the technology is mature to maximize their benefits
(Wang et al., 2021), but their decision might be subject to the developer’s requirements on
using such systems (Wang et al., 2021; Lv et al., 2021). Few studies have explored the
dynamics and interactions of the factors on the stakeholders’ adopting decisions.
Therefore, this research aims to investigate key factors that influence the stakeholders’
willingness and decisions toward the application of the quality tracking system in PCs. We
developed an evolutionary game model and investigated two representative project cases
that use different types of quality tracking techniques. Empirical data were collected for the
established model to address the following questions: How do PCs’ manufacturers,
constructors and developers influence each other in the adoption of the quality tracking
system?What are the conditions for each of them to adopt the quality tracking system? How
will the advancement of quality tracking technologies and other factors sway the decision of
different stakeholders?
By addressing the above questions, this study contributes to the existing body of
knowledge by (1) revealing the dynamic mechanism between manufacturers and
constructors under developers’ requirement and (2) providing practical suggestions to
improve the willingness of adopting quality tracking system in relation to the influence of
initial choices, degree of trust, developers’ requirement and technology advancement.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviewed the current understanding of PC
quality issues and the ICT technologies in construction quality management. Then, the
evolutionary gamemodel was established in Section 3. In Section 4, the probable scenarios of
equilibrium state were summarized based on the location of the saddle point in the
ECAM
evolutionary game model. Section 5 discussed how the changes of different factors influence
the decision of different stakeholders and provided theoretical and practical implications for
the key stakeholders according to the simulation results, followed by the conclusions in
Section 6.
2. Literature review
2.1 PCs’ quality issues
Various quality issues have been reported in PCs’ design, production, transportation and
assembly processes; for example, the size of components could be inaccurate and lead to
deviations in the position of a reserved hole (Li, 2020). In the construction of prefabricated
joints, quality problems such as insufficient grouting and misalignment of the sleeves often
occur (Duan and Li, 2019). Furthermore, the quality of PC involves more stakeholders than
the conventional construction because of the dual production environments (the factory and
site), more design work and prefabrication lead time, a longer error correction cycle and
stricter requirements on dimensional accuracy (Luo et al., 2020a; Zhang and Yu, 2020).
Therefore, it can be more challenging to determine the reliable stakeholders in quality issues,
and stakeholders may even delay or avoid solving the quality problems (Gan et al., 2017). For
example, manufacturers may select substandard raw materials that may result in cracks,
fractures and other quality problems that are difficult to locate the liability upon completion
(Li, 2020). Furthermore, the multistage and multi-stakeholder involvement makes it difficult
to identify the responsible party for the problem.
In addition, the stakeholders’ adoption decision to establish the quality tracking system
directly affects whether it can be implemented successfully (Jin et al., 2017). Different stakeholders
may have different willingness to adopt quality tracking systems; for example, constructors are
often in a dominant position over manufacturers, and they sometimes reject unsatisfactory
components delivered to the assembly site that seriously affects the manufacturer’s production
schedule and costs (Kent and Becerik-Gerber, 2010). Therefore, the manufacturers may prefer to
adopt the quality tracking system to prove the quality of their manufactured components. As
bounded rational individuals and decision makers, the stakeholders choose the best action to
maximize their utility, taking account of the potential costs and benefits, degree of trust between
the stakeholders and information sharing (Luo et al., 2020b). Therefore, there is a gameof adopting
the quality tracking system among the stakeholders.
2.2 Application of blockchains in construction quality management
Many advanced ICTs have been applied in the construction industry; for the quality control
of PCs, radio frequency identification (RFID), BIM, sleeve grouting technology, imaging
technology, etc., are widely used (Zhang et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2018). For example, by
embedding the passive RFID-based sensors in different concrete mixtures, the hydration of
the cement matrix was monitored for 170 days (Strangfeld et al., 2019). However, the
application of these techniques and technologies has focused on single-stage quality
management, with little consideration of the entire construction life cycle.
Blockchain technology has been explored in many industrial sectors worldwide
(Teisserenc and Sepasgozar, 2021). Blockchain technology makes business processes more
efficient, traceable, transparent and accountable across all stages of the project life cycle
(Yang et al., 2020). Preliminary effort has been made to apply blockchain-enabled supply
chain management in quality control and potentially digitize future construction business
processes (Qian and Papadonikolaki, 2020) and construction information management
(Sheng et al., 2020). In particular, the application in the tracking system has attracted
attention to ensure quality (Lin et al., 2019) and promote high-quality development of

tracking
prefabrication (Zhang et al., 2020). For example, Wang et al. (2020) built a novel blockchain-
based information management framework for a precast supply chain to solve issues in
automated information sharing, information tracking and transparency in a precast supply
chain. Zhang et al. (2020) constructed a blockchain-based PC quality tracking system that
supports open, transparent and efficient PC quality information storage, management and
tracking. However, the adoption of advanced ICT is not widely spread. Many factors affect
the decision-making choices of the stakeholders, such as cost, trust, tacit knowledge sharing
(Zhang et al., 2013), subsidy and penalty (Xing et al., 2020). Therefore, stakeholders trade off
cost and benefits in the decision of adopting quality tracking systems.
2.3 Evolutionary game in construction quality management
Evolutionary games take bounded rationality as the analytical framework (Smith and Price,
1973) and highlight strategy changes throughout the game, allowing imperfect players to
learn by observation (Eissa et al., 2021; Song et al., 2020). It holds the view that individuals’
decision-making behaviors in the real world achieve dynamic equilibrium through constant
trial and error, imitation and learning. As a popular quantitative analysis method, the
evolutionary game theory has broad applicability (Friedman, 1998) to study the dynamic
relationships between various stakeholders.
As bounded rational individuals, the stakeholders of PC supply chain seek the optimal
choice to maximize their utility through trial and error, learning and imitation, taking into
account the potential costs, benefits, information, probability and risks (Luo et al., 2020b;
Wang et al., 2022). Wang et al. (2018) applied the evolutionary game theory to discuss
collaborative innovation between the contractor and numerous subcontractors, and the
impacts of government incentive strategies on constructors (Cheng et al., 2020).
This research considers the PC manufacturers, the constructors and the developer
(owner), since they are the most critical stakeholders regarding the quality of PC products
(Eissa et al., 2021; Orlowski et al., 2018). The designer was not included in this study since the
manufacturers usually perform the detail design of PCs. The upstream and the downstream
processes frequently interact to influence supply chain performance (Luo et al., 2020a; Guo
et al., 2018), and the quality tracking system is effective only if both upstream and
downstream stakeholders are on board.
The upstream manufacturer’s decision will affect the constructor’s construction quality and
schedule, and eventually the developer’s benefit. Similarly, downstream assembly determines the
demand for PCs, the manufacturer’s inventory, production schedule, etc. (Luo et al., 2020a) and
thus the developer’s benefits. In this way, the developer usually lays requirements to record and
track components’ quality and may impose subsidy and penalty provision to promote quality
tracking (Xu, 2020). Since stakeholders are rational individuals, they will trade off the costs and
benefits in the adoption decision. Therefore, in the evolutionary game model, the decisions of
manufacturers and constructors can be described as tracking quality or not-tracking quality, and
the developer’s decision can describe as requiring or not requiring the system. The tripartite
evolutionary game model, including the manufacturer, the constructor and the developer,
examines the types of strategies of the three stakeholders that evolve dynamically under limited
rational conditions. The systematic framework of this study is shown in Figure 1.
3. The evolutionary game model
3.1 Model assumptions
The following assumptions were made in order to explore the process and decision-making
factors of manufacturers (m), constructors (c) and developers (d) in the quality tracking
processes.
ECAM
Assumption 1. The application of quality tracking is decided by developers,
manufacturers and constructors. Other Tier-2 or external stakeholders
are not considered in this research.
Assumption 2. Costs of quality tracking can be classified into tangible costs
C1
k ðk ¼ m; cÞ and intangible costs C2
k ðk ¼ m; cÞ. Tangible costs refer
to the quantifiable inputs such as establishing a quality tracking system
and the employment of technical personnel. Intangible costs refer to the
efforts made by enterprises to reduce the error rate. The baseline
operating cost without quality tracking is CN
k ðk ¼ m; cÞ.
Assumption 3. Manufacturers and constructors obtain Benefits Bm and Bc, respectively
from quality tracking systems to quickly identify the key problems,
improve the efficiency, transparency and security of information
interactions. Without the system, they obtain the baseline benefit BN
m
and BN
c .
Assumption 4. Information sharing in quality tracking generates synergy values (Xu
et al., 2019). The synergistic gain of both players is Sδβ, where S stands for
the total amount of information shared by the other party, β stands for the
degree of trust between stakeholders in sharing information and
δI ði ¼ 1; 2Þ stands for the synergy utility coefficient (δ ¼ δ1 ¼ δ2). On
the other hand, the maturity of the technology is assumed to be
f ð0 � f � 1Þ. As the technology matures, it will impact the cost,
benefit and information sharing effect (Polzin et al., 2015).
Assumption 5. The developer gives appropriate subsidy (T) to the manufacturer and
constructor for adopting quality tracking and penalty (T) for not
adopting, with the requiring cost Cd (e.g. hiring personnel) for the
developer and requiring benefits Bd. Without requirements, developers
can still obtain the baseline revenue I and the remediation cost G for
quality jeopardies in the long termwithout quality tracking records (Jiang
et al., 2019); at the same time, nonrequirement also leads to Expected
Losses L in the reputations and project efficiency.
Assumption 6. Suppose the probability that manufacturers choose quality tracking is
xðx∈ ½0; 1�Þ, and the probability that manufacturers do not choose
quality tracking is 1− x. Similarly, yðy∈ ½0; 1�Þ represents the probability
that constructors choose quality tracking, and the probability that

probability that developers adopt requiring strategy is zðz∈ ½0; 1�Þ, and
the probability that developers do not adopt requiring strategy is 1− z.

model of the manufacturer, the constructors, and the developer. Table 2 is the payoff matrix
under the corresponding strategies.

3.3 Equilibrium points and scenario analysis
According to the principles of the evolutionary game theory, the equilibrium points obtained from
replicated dynamic equations are not necessarily evolutionarily stable strategies (Friedman, 1998).
Applying the Jacobian matrix of the replicated dynamic equations can examine whether these
equilibrium points are evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Therefore, the Jacobi matrix is obtained
by calculating the three replicated dynamic Equations (1)–(3), as shown in Equation (4).

According to the Jacobian matrix theory which was proposed by Friedman, there are eight
local equilibrium points in the system, namely E1(0,0,0), E2(1,0,0), E3(0,1,0), E4(0,0,1), E5(1,1,0),
E6(1,0,1), E7(0,1,1) and E8(1,1,1). The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are obtained by
substituting eight equilibrium points into the Jacobianmatrix. The asymptotic stability of the
equilibrium point can be determined according to the indirect discriminant method of
Lyapunov. The equilibrium is only an asymptotically stable strategy when all the
eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix are less than 0 (λi < 0, i5 1, 2, 3). Therefore, four scenarios
can be identified as equilibrium solutions, as shown in Table 3.
Scenario 1 emphasizes on the benefits of adopting a blockchain-based quality tracking
system and recognizes the benefits of “free-riding”. Free-riding means that stakeholders in
the supply chain receive information from other stakeholders without sharing theirs. In this
scenario, more benefits are gained when both parties track quality than when only one party
tracks it or no party tracks it; the developer gains more benefit when make a requirement.
E8 (1, 1, 1) in Table 3 is a stable point, and the corresponding evolutionary strategy is (quality

tracking, quality tracking and requiring). In this case, the developer actively places
requirements, and both the manufacturer and the constructor adopt track quality. This is the
ideal state of the system to maximize project values.
Scenario 2 argues that the requirements will do more harm to the developer. The developer
gainsmore benefit when not requiring; more benefits are gainedwhen both parties track quality
than only one party tracks it or no party tracks it; E5 (1, 1, 0) is a stable point of the system; the
evolutionary strategy is (quality tracking, quality tracking and not requiring). In this case,
despite the lack of requirement by the developer, the manufacturer and the constructor still
choose to use the quality tracking system. However, in this case, the developers take the
advantages of application of the blockchain-based quality tracking system as a free riding, but
the quality tracking is inefficient, and the value of the project cannot be maximized.
Scenario 3 emphasizes on the benefits of the requirement to the developer. The developer
gains more benefit when requiring the use of the tracking system; more benefits are gained
when both parties track quality than no party tracks it than only one party tracks it.E4 (0, 0, 1)
and E8 (1, 1, 1) are the stable points of the system, and the evolutionary strategies are (quality
nontracking, quality nontracking and requiring) and (quality tracking, quality tracking and
requiring). However, E4 (0, 0, 1) in Table 3 shows a waste of the developer’s investment with
no required benefit such as quality improvement and reputation enhancement. The system
sustains at the equilibrium point E8 (1, 1, 1).
Scenario 4 emphasizes on the benefits of adopting the blockchain-based quality tracking
system without “free-riding.” In this scenario, more benefits are gained when both parties
track quality than no party tracks it or only one party tracks it; the developer gains more

benefit when not requiring the manufacturer and constructor. E5 (1, 1, 0) is a stable point of
the system. The evolutionary strategy is (quality tracking, quality tracking and not
requiring). This scenario is not the optimal state of the system.
To sum up, the steady state of the evolutionary system differs in four scenarios. Based on
the stability analysis of the equilibrium point of manufacturer, constructor and developer, the
benefits are greatest when both themanufacturer and the constructor adopt quality tracking,
next greatest when only one participates in quality tracking and smallest when neither
chooses to track quality. When these conditions are met, they prefer “quality tracking.” If
requiring quality tracking brings more revenue, the developer prefers “requiring.” The
evolutionary system under such conditions will converge to the ideal state (1, 1, 1).
Furthermore, the developer’s strategy has a significant influence on themanufacturer and the
constructor.
4. Case studies
A growing number of companies in China have recognized the importance of prefabricated
construction. Among them, Sichuan Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural
Development (2022) in southwest China aims to start 58 million square meters of new
assembled buildings in 2022, and emphasizes strengthening the information management.
This research used two representative projects in Sichuan Province as examples to examine
the adopting decisions of stakeholders in prefabricated construction. The case studies serve
to illustrate how different factors affect the evolutionarily stable strategy and convergent
trends for key stakeholders.
Project 1 was a typical precast beam project reinforced concrete using traditional tracking
technologies (e.g. QR code and RFID). Project 2 used more advanced technologies such as
fully automated smart factories and blockchains. We collected the empirical data from field
visits and semi-structured interviews in the two projects (called Case 1 and Case 2 hereafter),
with help from the developers. Five interviewees were invited from each case project,
including one chief engineer, one laboratory director and one R&D director, and two client
representatives, from Case Project 1, and two chief engineers, two project managers and one
client representative, from Case Project 2. Each interview lasted around two h. The
developers also accompanied the researchers during the entire interviews to encourage
sharing information on their quality tracking approaches. Photographs of the field visits are
shown in Figure 2.

Based on the above study, we substituted the parameters of the two projects and found that
Case 1 was consisted with Scenario 1 and Case 2 was consisted with Scenario 3. Cases
consistent with Scenarios 2 and 4 were not considered because the evolutionary steady state

for these two scenarios is (1, 1, 0) that is not the ideal state where all stakeholders participate.
In order to explore the evolutionary regularity of the system and to make practical and
reasonable suggestions for reaching the steady state, we discussed the influence of initial
choices, degree of trust, technology maturity, cost and benefits, and developer’s requirement
on the decision of the three key stakeholders, i.e. the developer, manufacturer and constructor.
4.1 Influence of initial choice
We examined if the manufacturer’s choice converged from 0.5 to 0 or to 1 under constructors’
and developers’ different choices of y and z. Similarly, we analyzed the changes of
constructors’ decisions of y under different choices of x and z, and developers’ decisions of z
under different choices of x and y, as illustrated in Figure 3. The result of Case 1 is represented
by the “-” line, and the result of Case 2 is represented by the “.” line.
In Case 1, as shown in Figure 3a, when the initial value of x was 0.5, the changes in
constructor and developer have almost no effect on the manufacturer’s decision. Similarly,
when the initial value of y was fixed, changes in the manufacturer and developer had almost
no effect on the constructor’s decision.
In Case 2, the manufacturer’s choice converged to non-quality tracking when y was small
enough and to 1 when ywas big enough, regardless of the change in the developer’s choice. On
the other hand, the constructor’s choice converged to non-quality tracking when x and z were
small enough, and to quality tracking when x5 0.1 and zwas big enough. It indicated that the
manufacturer’s choice ismainly influencedby the initial choice of the constructor. In contrast, the
choice of the constructor is influenced by both the manufacturer and the developer.

As shown in Figure 3c, in Case 1, the rate of z convergence to 1 slowed down as the initial
values of x and y increased. The same is true for Case 2. It means that when manufacturers
and constructors were willing to adopt RFID technology for quality tracking, the possibility
of developer requirement gradually decreased.
4.2 Influence of the degree of trust (changes of β)
Figure 4 showed the adoption decisions under different degrees of trust. Since advanced
technology significantly increases the degree of trust of the stakeholders, we set theminimum
value of 0.5 for the degree of trust in Case 2 while in Case 1 it was 0.3. The rate of convergence
of stakeholders to 1 increased as the degree of trust increased. Moreover, the change is more
evident in Case 2 than in Case 1. In Case 2, the tripartite game system converged to ð0; 0; 1Þ
when β ¼ 0:5 and to ð1; 1; 1Þwhen β ¼ 0:7 or higher. In Figure 5, the convergence rate and

tracking
direction of z did not change as the change of trust level; it indicates that the increase in the
degree of trust did not affect z.
4.3 Influence of technology maturity level (change of f)
The influence of technology maturity levels is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a showed that as the
maturity f of the technology changed from 0.2 to 0.4, the rate at which x and y converge to
0 slowed down as the maturity of the technology increased. However, x and y still converged to
0 eventually. As the technology maturity level increased from 0.5 to 0.7, x and y eventually
converged to 1. This indicates that in Case 1, there is a technologymaturity threshold at (0.4, 0.5).
When the technology maturity exceeds this threshold, the stakeholders are inclined to
participate in quality tracking. Similarly, as shown in Figure 6b, technology maturity threshold
was at (0.1, 0.2) in Case 2. Moreover, technology maturity level is positively correlated with the
manufacturer and constructor and negatively correlated with the developer.
4.4 Influence of technology cost and associated benefit
Our field visits and interviews with the stakeholders revealed that the majority cost for
quality tracking was on technology deployment, and the variations of technology cost and
benefit also affected the stakeholders’ choices. Denoting the technology benefit by E and the
technology cost byA themeaning of E±ais the increase or decrease of technical benefit by “a”
due to the effort of scientific and technical personnel.
As can be seen from Figure 7, changes in the benefit and cost of technology had a
significant impact on the strategies of the game players (i.e. the stakeholders). In Case 1, the
rates of x and y converging to 1 accelerated when the technology cost decreased with gain
unchanged. They accelerated faster when the tech gain increased with cost unchanged. For
Case 2, it is worth noting that the impacts of decreased technology costs are more profound
than the impacts of increased technology benefits. Figure 8 showed that the developer’s
willingness to require is stronger when the benefit of the technology increases and the cost
decreases, as the changes in technology cost and benefit affect the rate of evolution of z and
the direction of its evolution.

4.5 Influence of developers’ subsidy and penalty provision
Results of variations in the developers’ subsidy and penalty were shown in Figure 9. Please
note that the subsidy for adopting quality tracking and the penalty for not adopting shared
the same value of T for the purpose of model simplicity. T was set at 0, 20, 100, and 200,
respectively. Figure 9a showed the simulation results when conventional quality tracking
technologies were used. As T increased from 0 to 200, x and y converged to 1 at a faster rate,
while z converged to 1 at a slower rate. As the amounts of subsidy and penalty provision are
increased, manufacturers and constructors are more inclined to participate in quality
tracking, and the possibility of developer requirement diminished.
When advanced technologies such as blockchains were used for quality tracking, the
simulation results were shown in Figure 9b. At this time, the subsidy and penalty provisionT
given by the developer was set at 0, 20, 100 and 200. When T reduced from 200 to 0, the
Figure 6.

choices of the two stakeholders changed from “quality tracking” to “quality non-tracking.”
The simulation results showed that the increase of subsidy and penalty provision positively
affected stakeholders’ willingness to track quality.
5. Discussions
Various intertwining factors influence the adoption decisions of manufacturers, constructors
anddevelopers for thequality trackingsystem inPC construction.This researchbuilt a tripartite
evolutionary game model to examine how the key factors may affect the key stakeholders’
decisions with bounded rationality change. The evolutionary game analysis and simulation
results illustrated the impacts of initial willingness, degree of trust, technology maturity level
and subsidy and penalty provision, on the dynamic gaming process.
The simulation results successfully reflected the real-world circumstance in which the
quality tracking system was implemented in both cases and the developer made effort to

supervise the implementation. The results also showed that the developed evolutionary game
model and the selected parameters and variables were reasonable and feasible in simulating the
decision dynamics of key stakeholders in PCs’ quality tracking. Trade-offs of cost and benefits
were the most prominent factor in the decision-making. Furthermore, the degree of trust,
technology advancement and maturity level, and developer’s subsidy and penalty provision
were critical factors influencing the key stakeholders in applying the quality tracking system
of PCs.
In further explaining the adoption decision, this research identified the threshold of technology
maturity thatmeant that key stakeholderswould onlywillingly adopt the quality tracking system
with adequate maturity. The simulation results in this research found that the threshold of
mainstream technologies (QR codes) was between 0.4 and 0.5, while the threshold of automated
advanced technologieswasbetween 0.1 and0.2. It suggested that the advancement of technologies
would compensate for their immaturity, and key stakeholders would be more willing to adopt
advanced technologies even if they were less matured. The reason might be the improvement of
information transparency brought by advanced technologies such as blockchains; for example, in
Case 2, the trust level of the stakeholders’ increased due to the use of more advanced technologies,
producing more transparent and trustworthy sharing of information.
Despite the results and discussion presented above, the two limitations in this study are as
follows: (1) the data were obtained through interviews and on-site observation with a limited
number of companies and (2) for the simplicity of modeling, the subsidy and penalty
provision were denoted with one single parameter (T). Further research could cover more
empirical data from a wider range of stakeholders and improve the game model.
6. Conclusion, implication and future research
6.1 Conclusion
In many countries, prefabricated construction is applied in the hope of enhanced productivity,
quality, safety and environmental performance. However, the quality of PCs confronts new
issues, especially the liability issues, in the life cycle that include more stakeholders and more
interfaces. The quality tracking system covers the life cycle of PCs and is supposed to improve
quality control, but many factors influence the willingness of the key stakeholders to adopt the
quality tracking system. This research showed an insightful explanation of the decision-making
process of stakeholders in the adoption and how different factors influence their decisions.

In conclusion, this research built a tripartite evolutionary game model to investigate the
willingness of manufacturers, constructors and developers to track quality. Model solutions
identified evolutionarily stable strategies in various scenarios. Empirical results showed that the
model was feasible to simulate the dynamic interactive decision-making process. Besides the
technology cost and benefit, the subsidy and penalty provision provided by the developer plays
an essential role in promoting the application of the quality tracking system. Furthermore, this
research identified the threshold of technology maturity level and discovered that technology
advancement could compensate for the immaturity. Therefore, this research provided evidence
of challenges in adopting new technologies with high cost and lowmaturity and implications to
promote new technologies with adequate incentives and elevated trust degree.
This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a new explanation
to the willingness of the key stakeholders to adopt the quality tracking system from the
perspective of tripartite game modeling that considered the interactive dynamic decision-
making process of bounded rational stakeholders. Theoretically, this research established the
Figure 9.

influence of five factors in the directions and the rapidity of convergence in the game.
Empirically, this research enlightens key stakeholders with feasible approaches to promote
the application of a blockchain-based quality tracking system.
6.2 Theoretical implications
This study mainly contributes to the body of knowledge in three aspects.
First, based on the theory of bounded rationality, the study has revealed five influential
factors that determine the adoption behavior of quality tracking systems by key stakeholders,
including technology advancement and maturity level, trade-offs of cost and benefits,
developer’s subsidy and penalty and the degree of trust. These findings provide a new
perspective for understanding the blockchain-based quality tracking system adoption decisions
of PC supply chain stakeholders.
Second, this study established the rationale of technology maturity on stakeholders’
adoption of quality tracking systems. It is confirmed that only when the technology becomes
mature, would the key stakeholders willingly adopt the quality tracking system.
Nevertheless, the more advanced technologies have a lower maturity threshold that means
the key stakeholders wouldwillingly adopt a systemwith lessmatured advanced technology.
Third, the findings proved that the developer’s requirements will effectively promote quality
tracking system adoption behavior, and this study highlighted the developer’s important role in
driving the adoption and implementation of blockchain-based quality tracking systems.
6.3 Practical implications
This studyprovided significant implications for developers and key stakeholders toward boosting
the adoption of blockchain-based quality tracking systems. Taking the profit and loss of each
participating stakeholder as the startingpoint, studying the evolutionary lawof quality tracking of
stakeholders can provide a new perspective for improving the quality of components and provide
support for developing an effective incentive mechanism for PCs’ quality tracking management.
First, subsidies will promote the use of advanced technologies. There is no doubt that
advanced technology can control the quality of components effectively, but the initial promotion
is often difficult due to high cost and high risk. Therefore, developers and governments should
consider and provide appropriate technology subsidies to promote the application of advanced
tracking technologies.
Second, a supervision mechanism for the manufacturers’ behavior and constructors’
behavior should be established in the quality tracking process to reduce the occurrence of
quality problems. In addition to economic penalties for the stakeholders violating the
regulations, measures such as information disclosure and disqualification to regulate the
stakeholders’ behavior are needed.
Third, developers should facilitate communication among stakeholders for shaping an
information sharing climate. Stakeholders in the component supply chain should establish a
proper communicationmethod and set up a smooth channel for adequate information exchange
to convey solutions to problems in a timely manner. Meanwhile, the shared information is
protected, such as signing information confidentiality agreements between stakeholders.
6.4 Future research
Future work may include more stakeholders in the evolutionary game model for a more
comprehensive and complex analysis of the decision-making process in the entire PC supply
chain. In addition, since blockchain technology in the construction industry is still developing,
the relationship between technologymaturity level and cost as well as benefit is not sufficiently
clear and should be explored in the future.
