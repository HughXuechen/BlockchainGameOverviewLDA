Abstract. The market growth and popularity of Blockchain technology in
various fields has been astonishing. The gaming industry is one of the prominent
industries that applies Blockchain technology. However, there is some concern
about the speculative aspect of Blockchain-based games. Therefore, this paper
examines the effects of speculative and enjoyable aspects on users’ playing
behavior in Blockchain-based games. For this, we developed a web crawler and
collected data from Cryptokitties, one of very first successful Blockchain-based
games. To analyze our dataset, we conducted fixed panel regression. The results
indicate that the external aspects of the game are negatively related to item
selling, whereas the internal aspects of the game are positively related to item
selling in the Blockchain-based game. This result suggests that playing
Blockchain-based games is a mix of behavior with enjoyable and speculative
aspects. As such, it remains unclear whether users play Blockchain-based games
just for fun or as a form of speculation.

1 Introduction
Cryptocurrency has become more than a digital asset. In the early stages of cryp-
tocurrency, people handled it as a kind of digital currency that could only be use via the
Internet. However, as people have come to understand its unique characteristics, which
allows for a decentralized payment system, it started to attract massive public attention.
There are now more than 1,600 types of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin, Ethereum,
EOS, etc. [6]. Cryptocurrency is also garnering academic interests and scholars have
examined its viability as currency [8], its speculative characteristics [1, 4], determinants
or trend of cryptocurrency price [2, 11, 15].
Blockchain technology is one of the key cryptocurrency technologies that allows
the decentralized payment system [14]. The market size of Blockchain technology is
estimated to be about 1 trillion in valuation and growing [3]. Blockchain technology is
not used just for cryptocurrency, but for diverse applications such as trading, ecosys-
tem, security, social service [19]. In various fields, the gaming industry is prominent.
There are now more than 300 Blockchain-based games and more continue to be

launched [7]. Users of Blockchain-based games can spend and earn cryptocurrency
during their gameplay.
As the Blockchain-based game industry continues to grow, people are becoming
concerned with the speculative or addictive features of Blockchain-based games [9].
These kinds of worries existed at the beginning of cryptocurrency and many
researchers have investigated different aspects of cryptocurrency. However, there is a
lack of academic research on the enjoyable or speculative aspects of Blockchain-based
games. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of enjoyable and speculative aspects
on users’ playing behavior in Blockchain-based games. To do this, we developed a web
crawler to gather users’ transactions in their open ledger related to Cryptokitties (www.
cryptokitties.co), an early Blockchain-based game that was released in March 2017 and
was one of the very first Blockchain-based games to experience success [10].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, a research model
and relevant hypotheses are suggested. Section 3 explains the data gathered from
Cryptokitties and the analyzing method used to consider the features of our data.
Section 4 shares and discusses preliminary results. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the con-
clusions of this research and directions for future research.
2 Research Hypothesis
Blockchain-based games are different from traditional games in several aspects. The
main difference is the interoperability across games. Traditional games allow their
assets to be used only in their own game, but the assets of Blockchain-based games are
interoperable across Blockchain-based games. Unlike traditional games, Blockchain
technology allows high asset security and open trading among users even across
games. It is possible for users to profit because users can earn additional cryptocurrency
by getting or receiving game items in Blockchain-based games.
In addition, the price of game items can go up in price regardless of cryptocurrency
price, so users can earn extra cryptocurrency in the game. Therefore, users who have
speculative purpose are likely to play games to gain extra profit by converting game
items into cryptocurrency. These users pay attention to the price and the total volume of
cryptocurrency for buying or selling game items. Speculative users try to achieve the
maximum benefits from market fluctuations, so when the price is high and the trade
volume is huge, they are willing to wait for potential bigger benefits. Therefore, the
hypotheses are as follows.
Hypothesis 1: The price of cryptocurrency is negatively related to the number of items
selling in Blockchain-based games.
Hypothesis 2: The total volume of cryptocurrency is negatively related to the number
of items selling in Blockchain-based games.
In addition, to distinguish speculative and enjoyable behaviors in the blockchain-
based game, we assume the behaviors related to the game itself are related to enjoyable
behaviors such as in-game purchases, special functions in the game, interactions
between users, etc. These in-game behaviors make the game enjoyable for users and
keeps them playing. Selling in-game items also relates to in-game aspects, so the
internal aspect of games will be related to item selling. The frequency or amount of

item purchase presents the degree of immersion [12, 13, 17]. Highly immersed users
will spontaneously play the game more using in-game functions. Accordingly, our
hypothesis is as follows.
Hypothesis 3: Item purchase is positively related to item selling in Blockchain-based
games.
Furthermore, users who use unique functions of the game will be more likely to feel
satisfaction [16]. Users who are satisfied with unique features of the game will be more
likely to use in-game functions. Thus, the hypothesis is formulated as follows:
Hypothesis 4: Unique game functions are positively related to item selling in Block-
chain-based games.
As people enjoy the game for its social-interaction activities, many games set
several items to encourage interaction with other players [18]. Accordingly, social-
interaction playing behaviors can be described as playing behaviors in which users
enjoy the game through interactions with others. Therefore, the relationship between
social-interaction playing behaviors and item-selling behavior is investigated as
follows.
Hypothesis 5: Social interactions are positively related to item selling in Blockchain-
based games.
3 Research Method
3.1 Blockchain-Based Game
The dataset used in this paper is user-level transaction log data collected from the
Cryptokitties website (www.cryptokitties.co). Cryptokitties is one of the very first
blockchain-based games; it was released in March 2017. Using Ethereum blockchain,
users are able to buy, collect, breed, present, and sell digital cats with unique char-
acteristics made by a combination of certain attributes, or “cattributes.” Figure 1 shows
the main page of Cryptokitties.
Fig. 1. Main page of Cryptokitties
Is a Blockchain-Based Game a Game for Fun, or Is It a Tool for Speculation? 143
http://www.cryptokitties.co
There are 4 billion possible variations of Cryptokitties, and a new Cryptokitty was
released every 15 min until November 2018. Because all Cryptokitties are linked to the
Ethereum, each new cat is assigned a generation. A limited number of highly desirable
early - generation kitties had the highest sales prices. The total trading amount for
Cryptokitty purchases was about 6.7 billion dollars until December 2017. Due to the
rocketing number of Cryptokitties users, the Ethereum network experienced delays in
2018 [5]. Figure 2 presents screenshots of an individual user’s web page and a kitty in
Cryptokitties. Users can see their own kitties and their cattributes in the individual kitty
page.
3.2 Variables
We developed a web crawler using Python to collect all transactional records from 1
December 2017 till 31 July 2018. The raw dataset contains all Ethereum transaction
behaviors of 60,000 users. Among these datasets, we selected the data related to
Cryptokitties transactions and analyzed these data, which numbered more than 100,000
rows. The key variables are as follows (Table 1).

To investigate the effects of enjoyable and speculative aspects on users’ playing
behavior in Cryptokitties, we considered the effect of external and internal factors. We
assumed that users who consider speculative features of Cryptokitties as important are
likely to pay attention to the price or the total volume of Ethereum. The price and total
volume of Ethereum are considered external aspects. Figure 3 depicts the price trend of
Ethereum within our data time window. The Ethereum price fluctuated dramatically.

To investigate the effect of enjoyable aspects of Cryptokitties, we assumed that
users who consider the game enjoyable are likely to use game functions often to play.
Therefore, the game functions are considered internal aspects—the numbers of Cryp-
tokitties a player buys, sires, and presents. Figure 4 illustrates the number of users and
Cryptokitties that users sold. The numbers soared around the end of December 2017
and plummeted soon after.
4 Empirical Analysis
4.1 Research Model
To estimate the suggested factors, panel data models were conducted. We formally
tested using techniques of the fixed effect model and the random effect model. To check
whether the random effect model or the fixed effect model was suitable for our dataset,
the Hausman test was carried out and its result indicated that the regressors are not
correlated with the error terms. Therefore, our estimation incorporates fixed effects for
users to consider unobserved characteristics of individual users. The following equation
captures our econometric model. In this equation, users are indexed by i, and time is
indexed by t. bi is coefficients’ estimates for the number of Cryptokitties selling at time
t. li is for the individual cross-sectional effect, and the error term ei;t controls for the
idiosyncratic effects.

4.2 Preliminary Result
The result of our main model is demonstrated in Table 2. Our finding suggests that the
external aspects (the price and the total volume of Ethereum) are negatively related to
item selling (Hypotheses 1 and 2 are supported). In addition, the internal aspects (the
number of item purchase, siring, and gifting) are positively related to item selling
(Hypotheses 3, 4, and 5 are supported). The results indicate that users play Blockchain-
based games for fun as well as speculation. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether a
Blockchain-based game is just a game for fun or a tool for speculation.

5 Conclusion and Future Plan
This study investigated the effects of enjoyable and speculative aspects on users’
playing behavior in blockchain-based games. We crawled playing behaviors of
Cryptokitties and analyzed these behaviors by conducting a fixed-effect panel regres-
sion model. We found that the external aspects (i.e., the price and the total volume of
Cryptocurrency) are negatively related to item-selling behavior in Blockchain-based
games. In addition, the internal aspects (i.e., item purchasing, siring, gifting) are
positively related to item selling. Thus, it is hard to say whether a Blockchain-based
game is just a game for fun or a tool for speculation. Playing behaviors in Blockchain-
based games mix enjoyable and speculative aspects. We anticipate that these findings
will not only contribute to the extant literature on the speculative aspects of
Blockchain-based games, but also aid game developers by suggesting how to make
users continue to use the game for long-term success.
This research has some limitations. First, the characteristics of players could differ
according to the time when they joined the game. For example, players who joined the
game in the early stages may be more likely to be risk-takers. Unlike early adopters,
players who join the game in the latter stages could be followers. Additionally, this
paper does not consider the lag variables of each suggested variable. For example, the
price of cryptocurrency last week could affect item selling in a Blockchain-based game
this week. A later version of this paper will address these issues.
