Abstract
Many small farmers and workers on plantations in poorer countries constantly live on the poverty threshold. 
Those people suffer from rising commodity prices and trade structures that pass price pressure to the weakest  
link. Farmers are at the mercy of these structures and must comply as they have no other choice.  
On the consumers' side of the supply chain, it is often hard to recognize agricultural products' fairness  
and originality, especially in processed food. Many organizations – through food labelling - partially inform 
consumers about products' provenance and fairness. Whereas several studies confirm that food labels 
positively influence the consumers' intention to buy food, the vast number of organizations and labels are 
hard to evaluate and distinguish. A technology that could be a gamechanger in sustainable and fair global 
agriculture could be Blockchain Technology (BCT). With the help of BCT, the need for a central authority 
like a "fair label" agency may become obsolete, with the same or even better results. This conceptual article 
surveys subject matter literature and concludes that there is a noticeable research gap in the possibility  
of BCT replacing or enhancing fair food labels. Thus, the paper shows the potential of BCT to improve 
fairer agricultural supply chains and make them transparent for customers. By doing so, some research areas  
and research questions will be derived. Furthermore, specific directions for future research will be shown.

Introduction
There are many unsolved economic and ethical 
issues within the supply chain of agricultural 
products and food. Many small farmers and workers 
on plantations in poorer countries constantly live 
on the poverty threshold. Those people suffer  
from rising commodity prices and trade structures 
that pass price pressure to the weakest link. 
Farmers are at the mercy of these structures  
and must comply to make a living. Therefore, many 
organizations evolved to eliminate inequalities 
amongst global agricultural supply chains  
and diminish sustainability issues. For example,  
the Fairtrade Label guarantees smallholder farmers 
a minimum price for their product, intended  
to cover the average costs of sustainable production 
and improve their living conditions (Jefford, 2021).
Consequently, fair label organizations certify 
the fairness of products with labels visible  
on agricultural products and food. Further, also 
food consumers want the assurance that their food 
is safe and that the accompanying information is 
accurate (Rupprecht et al., 2020). It seems that those 
fair food label organizations excel in alleviating 
inequalities and are sustainable; however, the variety  
of organizations is hard to comprehend  
and distinguish for consumers. Consequently, 
consumers are faced with an increasing number  
of sustainable food labels, deprived of the possibility 
to prove which is the right one. According  
to Sirieix et al. (2013), these different labels 
add to the competition of product information  
in consumers' minds, even though it is not 
transparent for consumers if the whole product is 
traded fair or just parts of it.
Studies (Wang et al., 2020) found that the perceived 
quality of food labels positively influences  
the consumers' intention to buy food. That 
means food producers strive to put trusted labels  
on their products to increase sales. Also, "Made-in" 
labels are used by customers to judge a product's 
[112]
quality ex-ante (Haucap et al., 1997). However, 
customers hold different levels of trust in different 
labels, which depend on the food certifying 
body. Consequently, consumers need to trust  
organizations or labels on products to know  
the provenance of agricultural products (Wang  
et al., 2020). For example, there is no real 
transparency between farmers' and government 
administrations' exchanged data, especially  
in poorer regions. Consequently, governments 
could alter information for their advantage,  
and the development of the agricultural industry 
will be hindered (Sowmya et al., 2020).
This issue imposes some room for improvement 
through new technologies. One technology that 
could be a gamechanger in sustainable and fair global 
agriculture is Blockchain Technology (BCT). With 
the help of BCT, the need for a central authority 
like a "fair label" agency may become obsolete,  
with the same or even better results. This technology 
is not just a significant improvement for customers, 
but it is also a gamechanger for farmers in poorer 
regions – as BCT can democratize the information 
in supply chains. In addition, the technology could 
inform farmers more about their products' journey 
and better manage customer relationships and risks 
(Fairtrade Foundation, 2019).
The agricultural supply chain
The recent supply chain issues, which span over 
many worldwide industries and products, do 
not stop at the agricultural industry. Ironically,  
the issue with agricultural supply chains is that there is  
a shortage of food on the one hand, and on the other, 
there is rotten food in containers around the world. 
The reasons for that are various: labour shortages 
due to COVID-19, shortages of raw materials  
to repair equipment and the lack of herbicides which 
make crops growing more expensive (Sönmez, 
2021). 
Generally, modern supply chains are a complex 
endeavour across different industries with multiple 
functions, potentially conflicting objectives,  
and numerous dependencies between material 
and information flows. The agricultural supply 
chain (ASC) is more complex, with many inbound 
and outbound networks (Denis et al., 2020).  
The complexity in the ASC is enhanced  
by the fact that most agricultural products 
are perishable. Therefore the opportunity  
to use inventory as a buffer against demand  
and transportation variability is limited (Ahumada 
and Villalobos, 2009). Moreover, ASC are more 
complex to manage than other supply chains, mainly 
due to the importance of factors like food safety 
and quality, limited shelf life, demand, and price 
variability. An efficient and fair agricultural supply 
chain results from stable networks and common 
relations between input suppliers, producers, 
processors, traders and retailers (Bhagat and Dhar, 
2011). In addition, recent studies (Eluubek kyzy 
et al., 2021) found that current agricultural supply 
chains have a hard time helping impoverished 
farmers because agricultural supply chains 
focus mainly on the processes between farmers  
and consumers and omit smallholder farmers. 
That is because the agricultural industry prefers 
to work with large scale farmers that use modern 
technology, and small farmers do not have any 
possibility to negotiate from the same level. Hence 
agencies can bargain prices down. Summarized,  
the main issues of ASC are food loss, safety, 
insecurity, accessibility, increased demand, 
diminishing resources, and the global food crisis 
(Despoudi et al., 2021).
Blockchain technology 
Since the ground-breaking invention of the peer 
to peer electronic cash system (Bitcoin) in 2008 
(Nakamoto, 2008), Blockchain Technology (BCT) 
has seen an enormous rise in academic and practical 
significance for various applications. This interest 
might be fuelled by vast and valuable applications 
paired with the fairytale-like rise of Bitcoin  
and other cryptocurrencies (Coinmarketcap.com, 
2021). 
Initially, the BCT was used as a decentralized 
platform to validate transactions in financial 
applications without the need for any third party. 
Gradually, applications in non-financial industries 
are on the rise and impose many opportunities 
(Nofer et al., 2017). BCT is applicable for every 
business which relies on an intermediary between 
two parties. Therefore the BCT can challenge 
existing business models in almost every industry 
(Morkunas et al., 2019). 
Without technical detail, a blockchain can be 
described as a distributed data database in encrypted 
so-called "blocks" (Rymarczik, 2020). These 
data blocks are cryptographically linked together  
and can be verified by all parties at any time 
(Antonucci et al., 2019; Nakamoto, 2008). To be 
able to do so, the data is stored with reference  
to the previous data block, forming an indefinite 
ever-growing chain of blocks. The blocks are 
created by parties who maintain the whole network 
and are called miners and get rewarded for their 
contribution (Chitchyan and Murkin, 2018).

Research Agenda 
[113]

Research Agenda 
By doing so, the data on the Blockchain is  
for everybody viewable and due to the connection 
of the blocks not amendable. This opens many 
possibilities for applications where trust is a crucial 
issue. 
Blockchain technology in the agricultural supply 
chain
The agricultural sector is still one of the most 
minuscule digitalized industries, with many unused 
possibilities and inefficiencies (Gandhi et al.,  
2016).  It brakes the development of modern 
business models based on IT tools implementation 
despite their steep spread in business activity 
(Hu et al., 2019; Roshchyk et al., 2022). 
Furthermore, the food supply chain has become 
a worldwide, multi-actor, distributed supply 
chain, where many stakeholders, like farmers, 
shipping companies, wholesalers, retailers,  
and end customers, are included (Kamilaris et al., 
2019). Through BCT, there is a reliable approach 
for tracing all transactions and managing all 
stakeholders. This reduces the space for fraud  
and malfunctions along the supply chain  
and quicker detection of inefficiencies. Hence, BCT 
technology can provide solutions to food-quality 
and food-safety issues, which are concerns of both 
customers and governments (Xiong et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, considering the current backlogs  
and issues along global supply chains, a transparent 
supply chain optimizes operations, guarantees  
the quality of outputs and ensures the sustainability 
of processes (Montecchi et al., 2021; Křenková  
et al., 2021). These consequences are valuable due  
to increasing challenges for agriculture development 
in an international environment (Przekota et al., 
2020).
Although the Blockchain had its primary usage  
in the financial industry and is also known mainly 
because of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ether 
and many other financial usages, the Blockchain 
in agriculture has its justification. The fields  
of applications are vast but can be categorized 
mainly around the supply chain of food (Kamilaris 
et al., 2019). Like many other industries, supply 
chains in the agricultural industry have never 
undergone a digital transformation.
The main challenges that need to be tackled  
in the future are the rising food demand, changing 
consumer preferences, environmental issues and 
sustainability, costs, food safety, and fair trade 
(Schmidhuber, 2018). Lately, the BCT in agriculture 
has become a growing trend, and Blockchain 
led innovations in the agricultural market have 
been rapidly gaining traction (Jefford, 2021).  
As an example, BCT could improve food labelling: 
Studies show that BCT could be far superior  
to a food label organization, as customers must 
trust the organization in guaranteeing the quality  
of the product. However, BCT is not based  
on trust but on knowledge that cannot be 
manipulated (Uhlich and Lux, 2021).
Furthermore, consumers are increasingly 
demanding high quality as well as safe food, paired 
with a wish for a smaller environmental footprint 
of agricultural products, which is also fostering  
the need for new innovative technology to trace food 
along the supply chain in an effective manner (Rana 
et al., 2021). In fact, farm-to-shelf traceability can 
be an essential factor in establishing a benchmark 
for food quality and safety ([x]cube LABS, 2020). 
Therefore, more and more companies are starting 
to use BCT along the supply chain: Coca Cola 
has been exploring multiple blockchain projects  
for years to tackle different issues. One latest project 
was created to find a secure registry for sugar cane 
workers to tackle forced labour worldwide (Chavez-
Dreyfuss, 2018). Also, a Norwegian salmon 
producer made it possible to monitor every aspect 
of the salmon supply chain with the use of digital 
twins of the salmons on the Blockchain and make 
it, therefore, completely comprehensible (Ultsch, 
2021). Nestle has been trying to ensure that its  
used palm oil is not linked to any deforestation  
of the rainforest. Therefore, with the help of BCT, 
Nestle can track the provenance and the correct 
shipment of palm fruits (Chandrasekhar, 2020). 
Most of the companies, both mentioned above 
and in general, are using BCT based on the IBM 
Food trust – a modular solution based on BCT that 
enables a more sustainable food ecosystem (IBM-
Foodtrust, 2021). The IBM Food Trust Blockchain 
benefits are based on increased efficiency, fresher, 
safer food and sustainable food, less fraud,  
and reduced waste. Moreover, companies can build 
up a better reputation and can therefore increase  
the customer's confidence in the company's product. 
For example, IBM is working with start-ups  
on fairer conditions for coffee farmers. Customers 
can track the coffee beans back to the farmers  
and directly donate money to them (Stede, 2020). 
Materials and methods
This article's main objective is to find research 
opportunities and define a research agenda  
for the possibility of BCT improving or replacing 
fair food labels. The research gap was identified  
[114]
Fair Label versus Blockchain Technology from the Consumer Perspective: Towards a Comprehensive 
Research Agenda 
by literature research. A combination  
of the keywords "Fair Label" and "Blockchain" was 
chosen to evaluate the available research on this 
matter. For this article searches were performed 
over Emerald, Web of Sciences and Google 
Scholar. No restrictions concerning the date were 
selected.  Although the vast amount of literature  
on BCT and ASC, there is an apparent lack of papers 
investigating the consumer perception of BCT 
and the possibility of the technology to improve 
or replace fair trade food labels or, in general, 
food labels. In fact, the author could not find any 
literature which is dedicating itself to the topic.  
Therefore, adequate research questions based  
on well-grounded theory must be formulated 
to create a comprehensive research agenda. 
Nevertheless, given the novelty of blockchain 
technology in the agricultural sector, there are many 
promising research possibilities for the future. 
Results and discussion
BCT could transform the food industry in many 
ways: more food safety, less fraud and faster 
and fairer payments (Charlebois et al., 2017). 
According to Katsikouli et al. (2021), food fraud 
causes problems from several perspectives.  
Not only causes it the loss of trust from consumers 
in food products, but also can it lead to unfair 
competition and is a threat to brand reputation. 
This could have massive long term economic 
consequences for the affected company or even  
the country. Information of the foods supply chain 
as a whole and the environmental responsibility  
of each food producer are essential components  
of the consumer's trust (Sengupta and Kim, 2021). 
BCT could make supply chains more transparent  
and enables the agricultural industry to produce 
high-quality food with low social and environmental 
impacts (Rana et al., 2021).
Further, BCT could enable consumers to make 
more informed decisions about the products they 
are buying. According to Asioli et al. (2020), there 
is no denying that the agricultural production 
systems are facing unprecedented challenges  
and that due to sustainability concerns, there has 
been a proliferation of sustainable related food 
labels. However, the question remains: how could 
those sustainable related food labels be more 
informative so that consumers can distinguish those 
and grasp the value. Many of the advantages which 
a food label brings a consumer, like transparency, 
fairness, and information, could also be delivered 
by a transparent supply chain on a blockchain. 
Moreover, while using food labels, consumers need 
to trust companies or organizations responsible  
for the labels; there is no need by the use of BCT  
to trust any intermediating party. Due to the possible 
advantages of a BCT approach, the following 
research question can be derived:
RQ1: Blockchain technology improves the trust  
of consumers in fair agricultural products
It is almost impossible for consumers to understand 
the difference between various fair trade labels, 
and apart from some serious initiatives, it can be 
seen that the implementation of fair trade strategies 
is still very immature (Katsikouli et al., 2021). 
Consumers are bombarded with many claims  
on products on how the food is processed, produced 
and regulated, although consumers mainly cannot 
distinguish products just because of labelling  
and therefore are left confused (Abrams et al., 
2010). 
Almost all traditional food labels are intended  
to provide consumers with additional information. 
Studies like Banterle et al. (2013) state that  
with the use of sustainable food labels,  
the vertical coordination of supply chains increases 
and the product uncertainty is reduced. However, 
several studies indicate that consumers lack  
an understanding of their meaning (Hamilton  
and Raison, 2019). What is more, consumers could 
also struggle with trust in the source of the food 
label. Hence, Rupprecht et al. (2020) investigated 
the consumer's perception of five sources of label 
information: Producers, Governments, Producer 
Associations, Experts and Consumers. They found 
that, whereas labels of experts were the least 
legible, they were found to be the most trustworthy 
across all the examined countries and food 
types. So, the emergence of a widely used expert 
label, where scientific testing of food product is  
in the foreground as a trustworthy source  
of information, is proposed. They argue that this 
development aligns with the trend of greater supply 
chain transparency. However, what they are not 
even considering is a solution based on BCT.
On the contrary, Garaus and Treiblmaier (2021) 
found that blockchain traceability systems 
positively impact the retailer choices of customers. 
They argue that with the use of product labels, it can 
be shown that a traceable and immutable database 
has been used, which is increasing consumers' 
trust. Also, others like Behnke and Janssen (2020) 
describe BCT as a possible technological solution 
for a food traceability framework – amongst 
some boundaries which needed to be solved first.  
In addition,  Uhlich and Lux (2021) state that 
consumers should demand documentation of supply 
chains via Blockchain, as they argue that BCT is 
[115]
Fair Label versus Blockchain Technology from the Consumer Perspective: Towards a Comprehensive 
Research Agenda 
far superior to any sustainable food label. By doing  
so, companies would be forced to implement  
the technology and give it a preference  
over classical food labels (Upadhyay et al., 2021).
Hence, future studies could test whether BCT excels 
in using food labels. Based on that, a survey design 
similar to the survey conducted by Rupprecht  
et al. (2020) is proposed; however, extended  
with the sources of label information for each food 
type with a solution using BCT (Table 1). 
Researchers could investigate and let BCT compete 
with the other label information sources. This leads 
to RQ2: 
RQ2: Blockchain Technology is superior to fair 
labels in the perception of consumers
The issue with fair and sustainable food is linked 
to many sustainable development goals of the UN. 
Based on the arguments stated in the previous 
chapters, the author reckons that a BCT based 
fair label could improve many issues which are 
currently not or just partially solved. A way to show 
that foods provenance could be tracked in a tamper- 
proof manner would be a gamechanger  
for the customers and the industry. This can be 
achieved by a transparent blockchain delivered  
by BCT. By doing so, small farmers could see 
amongst others for how much their products will be 
sold, and big food companies could organize better 
business calculations by having more accurate 
and unalerted information on the provenance  
of its raw materials. BCT could also help 
companies to reach their Environmental Social 
Governance (ESG) goals, as BCT could allow  
for a credible sustainability assessment (Joseph, 
2022). Finally, also consumers could profit, as they 
would undeniably see from where the product is 
from and whether farmers were treated fair.  
This article aimed to show a research possibility 
about improving fair food labels using blockchain 
technology. Although most of the investigated 
articles were about classic food labels, describing 
the contents of the food, the author assumes that 
fair food labels can be seen analogously to food 
labels, as both are basically requiring the same trust  
for the issuing institution. It is immanent that 
ASCs are complex for many reasons (Ahumada 
and Villalobos, 2009; Denis et al., 2020; Kamilaris 
et al., 2019). So, it is not easy for the customer  
to understand and track food contents.  Using  
a BCT fair food label, the customer could easily track 
food components back to the farmer and confirm  
theproduct'ss sustainability and fairness.  
The author suggests that the research questions 
could be answered by a survey similarly  
to Rupprecht et al. (2020) but extended with a BCT 
based information source. Research should pay 
attention to the fact that customers might not be able 
to grasp the technology initially and therefore might 
not see the advantages it could bring. Therefore, 
the survey authors may need to distinguish between 
people who are aware of the technology and people 
who are not. Another possibility would be to inform 
the respondents about the technology before taking 
the survey; however, this could result in a biased 
result. Furthermore, with BCT, some issues may 
remain; for instance, who assures that the data 
entered on the Blockchain is accurate (Jiang, 2019)? 
Consequently, someone could argue that BCT 
does not bring any value to supply chain tracking. 
However, some companies like Circularise evolved 
to develop solutions for these issues. 
One limitation of this research agenda is that solely 
the customers' perspective is reviewed. However, 
the producers' and suppliers' perspective also 
bear interesting research possibilities that future 
research could also investigate. Another promising 
possibility would be to look at the perspective  
of fair food label organizations. For example, BCT 
might be a competitive product of fair food labels: 
A potential customer could make sure whether 
the product was traded fairly or not by having  
a completely transparent supply chain. Hence, there 
is no need for a fair label organization anymore. 
Contrary to that, someone could argue that a BCT

fair food label could also be a complimentary 
product to food labels organizations where  
the fair food label organization certifies that all data 
on the Blockchain is valid. Nonetheless, it needs 
to be researched if such an approach improves  
the current business-standard.
Conclusion
In this article, the possibility of BCT to improve 
and or replace classic fair food labelling is 
discussed. After a description of the ASC and 
BCT itself, research questions for further research  
on this topic are derived based on current literature. 
The question remains:  Who is responsible  
for making the ASC more transparent and, therefore, 
fairer. What are current barriers to the adoption, 
and who, with which means, can implement  
the technology? According to the literature, 
industry leaders should embrace the technology  
and make it business-standard. By doing so,  
the entire food industry could be enhanced 
(Charlebois et al., 2017). Also, currently, 
governments are playing an essential role  
in ensuring that information provided on food is 
accurately and understood by consumers (Sengupta 
and Kim, 2021). Studies are also reasoning 
that the customers should start to demand more 
transparent ASC (Uhlich and Lux, 2021), which 
would ultimately lead to a fairer and probably 
more sustainable ASC. Future studies could also 
look at companies dedicated to changing current 
systems by implementing BCT and investigating 
the adoption. Future research can work on those 
thoughts, extend or refine them and adapt the stated 
research questions or answer them.
