ABSTRACT
The blockchain technology provides a data authentication and per-
manent storage solution to the data volatility issue in peer-to-peer
games. In this work, we present the Infinity Battle, a serverless turn-
based strategy game supported by a novel Proof-of-Play consensus
model. Comprising three major phases: matchmaking, gaming ses-
sion and global synchronization, the proposed demo game generates
a blockchain through distributed storage and processing.

game servers [2]. Moreover, recent data loss cases alert us to the
fact that a single dedicated server/cluster is vulnerable due to single
points of failure, which possibly harming players’ virtual assets and
affecting their gaming experience [11]. To overcome these shortfalls,
researchers are seeking decentralized solutions for video games.
For instance, Dota 21, a well-known multiplayer online battle arena
(MOBA), provides a serverless gaming system. However, such ar-
chitecture only enables game players under the same peer-to-peer
(P2P) network to share volatile gaming sessions, as its gaming data
can not be authenticated and permanently stored outside the P2P
network.
To overcome this issue, blockchain [3] becomes a potential solu-
tion. Proof-of-Play (PoP) [12] provides a consensus mechanism for
blockchain with the aim of guaranteeing data genuineness [5, 13].
The objective of this consensus model is to combine the advantages
of both Proof-of-Work [8] and Proof-of-Stake [6] in which a new
transaction is created based on the game result in a P2P game (i.e.,
computational power for playing a game) without consuming ad-
ditional or wasteful computational power. Basically, there are two
phases – Shared Turns and Block Writing, ensuring the integrity
of the game data and gaming quality, respectively. Block Writing
also manages the number of valid blocks. Compared to blockchain
games [4, 7, 10], a subgenre of P2P games whose entire gaming
procedures interact with the blockchain itself, a P2P game coupled
with PoP provides a generic solution. An apparent reason is because
PoP supports real-time P2P games while blockchain games do not.
Additionally, players in PoP do not need to pay high transaction
fees because they are miners, while current public platforms of
blockchain games disallow a player to be a miner.
Much like traditional multiplayer online games, the components
of a P2P gaming system include matchmaking, gaming session and
gaming data storage. Note that PoP focuses on solving the data
storage issue only. In this paper, we describe our development of a
game called Infinity Battle to demonstrate the operation of PoP. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first blockchain-related game

2 INFINITY BATTLE
Infinity Battle is a turn-based strategy game with four players sep-
arated into two teams. Unlike a traditional gaming system, every
player joins in the game with an equal role, which is an important
characteristics of a P2P game. In general, a complete cycle consists
of three phases:Matchmaking assists in arbitrarily grouping four
players to form a P2P gaming network; Gaming Session offers a
battlefield where all players follow a series of rules and fight for vic-
tory; Global Synchronization stores both non-gaming data and
a gaming record with the help of the blockchain techniques. Figure
1 shows the general procedure of Infinity Battle. The following
three subsections elaborate the figure part by part and introduce
the technique behind each phase.
2.1 Matchmaking
As the first stage in all multiplayer online games, matchmaking
considers numerous factors such as network latency and skill level,
and it is the most complex part of a game [1]. To simplify our work
on the P2P matchmaking task and preserve the feature of decen-
tralization feature, we assume that there are a large number of
matchmaking nodes all around the world, but there is no connec-
tion between any two of them. Consequently, each matchmaking
node forms a group only with those players who are connecting
to it. In the first section of Figure 1, there are four players simulta-
neously connecting to a matchmaking node, and a new match is
successfully created. In general, while the matching node should
evaluate players’ skills in this demo paper we assume that the
players’ capabilities are comparable in this demo paper.
2.2 Gaming Session
Coordinating with the matchmaking node, a group of players form
a pure P2P network [9]. They are divided into two teams and all of
them enter the battlefield, as illustrated in the second section of Fig-
ure 1. During the gameplay, each player independently broadcasts
the actions to all other nodes using the User Datagram Protocol.
Before the battle starts, each player chooses a unique character.
Then, in each round, a player can play the game using one of the
three predefined attack methods. Although some skills/methods are
more powerful, players cannot use all skills and methods in every
round. If a character dies, it will be reborn after a certain number of
rounds. Furthermore, that character’s teammates become stronger
before the character is reborn. The game ends when all characters
on one team die.
2.3 Global Synchronization
After the gameplay, relevant data will be saved to a distributed
storage system based on PoP. The entire process is shown in the
third section of Figure 1. As in the first period of PoP, Shared Turns
is maintained by all players in a match, whose collection pool
stores the game records. Players in this period tend to be honest on
account of the incentives [12], and therefore, an overall game record
can be determined based on a majority vote. The most valuable
player (MVP) of the match, a winner with superior performance,
broadcasts it throughout the network and prepares a candidate
block containing both gaming and non-gaming records for the
blockchain system. A block becomes valid if and only if it satisfies
the following two conditions: (1) The MVP makes a sufficient effort
in the lastmatch, and (2) The block satisfies a specifiedmathematical
formula. The first condition aims to encourage players to have a
positive attitude toward every match, while the second is to avoid
a large number of orphan forks. These two conditions correspond
to Effort Evaluator and Block Selector, both of which make up the
Block Writing phase. In case of the appearance of natural forks,
PoP adopts probabilistic finality to determine which chain should
eventually be added to the blockchain system.
3 CONCLUSION
This paper presents Infinity Battle, a P2P turn-based strategy game
to demonstrate PoP. The proposed system can be fully operated in
a distributed manner. Equipped with an anti-cheating mechanism
and other functions, there are three main phases: matchmaking,
gaming session and global synchronization. Our demo shows how
a P2P game with an innovative PoP consensus model can be used
to support a blockchain system.
