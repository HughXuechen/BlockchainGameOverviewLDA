To address the challenges of financing SMEs, breaking the limitations of traditional financing models, a blockchain-based financial
risk prevention and early warning system for businesses has been proposed and an in-depth study of the system has been
undertaken. As a scientific and technological means to strengthen the disclosure and sharing of information such as credit
records and risk early warning, The key to getting financial institutions to lend to SMEs is to avoid financial credit risk in the
value chain. Considering SMEs located in supply chains as an object of study, using the logical relationships between block
chains and financial credit risk management chains, three principles of supply chain management are proposed by analyzing
the logical relationships between supply chains and financial credit control chains. Chain using blockchain technology, namely:
the principle of recognizing the trust of major enterprises, the principle of sharing information about the financing process and
the principle of general cooperation for successful financing. Based on this principle, an evolutionary game model is used to
analyze the evolutionary path of endorsement fiduciary relationships between major enterprises and SMEs, the influencers of
evolutionary equilibrium, the evolutionary path of cooperation between commercial banks and SMEs in financing, the
evolutionary path under the control of third-party institutions, and influencers. The research shows that the financing activities
of commercial banks and small and medium-sized enterprises are based on the trust endorsement of core enterprises in the
supply chain, and the intervention of third-party regulators will help to promote the consistent cooperation and information
sharing of all participants in the supply chain, so as to promote the smooth completion of supply chain financing.
1. Introduction
In traditional financial business, banks often need to
comprehensively consider the borrower’s financial status,
mortgage and pledge assets, so as to determine whether its
repayment source is sufficient and evaluate its overall risk.
Because upstream SMEs are usually separate economic enti-
ties, risk tolerance, low credibility and inadequacy are weak,
unreliable and inadequate. Therefore, banks are less willing
to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same
time, banks create cumbersome approval processes to hedge
against risks, and financial services are ineffective and do not
match the economic contribution of SMEs. Worse, the
financing channels of small and medium-sized enterprises
are much less than those of large group companies. When
formal financial institutions are bound by higher financial
obligations, only private loans with a high cost of capital
can be shifted, resulting in the loss of a large number of cli-
ents and the high cost of financing SMEs. The emergence of
supply chain finance has improved the above problems to a
certain extent. It takes the core enterprises with high credit
level in the industrial chain as the node, carries out financing
business through credit transmission, and realizes multi-
party win-win [1]. Different from the simple one-time
creditor’s right and debt relationship between traditional
banks and enterprises, the borrower and the borrower have
built a long-term cooperative relationship. Value chain
finance business processes focus on the quality of informa-
tion flow, logistics and capital flows, are efficient and
inexpensive, and improve the efficiency of value chains.
But, as a way of history is also shortly financed, finance is
established to deploy the supply chain during the financial
services process, risk, credit risk, operation, liquidity risk,
rights, many risks await in a technologically advanced

retic and practical meaning. Blockchain application scenes
currently exist: retail, financial industry, supply chain man-
agement, smart manufacturing, impartiality, record keeping,
archive management such as retail consumer goods trace-
ability, security, segregated logistics knowledge, real-time
logistics tracking, registration digital assets of the civil ser-
vice, identity card, etc [2]. Figures 1 show the financial risk
warning system of enterprises in the field of block chain.
2. Literature Review
Gupta, Y. B. and others said that value chain finance as a
service of financial innovation to address the challenges of
SME finance, breaking through the constraints of tradi-
tional SME finance models, attempts to spur SME devel-
opment under the influence of national policies and
emerging technologies [3]. Avgouleas, E. and others
believe that as the models of SME finance change, the
concepts and models of value chain finance must also
change. How to mitigate the credit risk of value chain
finance is fundamental not only to address urgently
needed challenges in the development of value chain
finance, but also to facilitate the smooth implementation
of SME finance [4].. Wang, K. and others said that as a
scientific and technological means to strengthen the disclo-
sure and sharing of information such as credit records and
risk early warning, The key to getting financial institutions
to lend to SMEs is avoiding financial credit risk in the
value chain [5]. Liu, G. F. and others took small and
medium-sized enterprises with financing needs in the sup-
ply chain as the research object. By analyzing the logical
relationship between blockchains and the financial credit
risk control of the supply chain, three principles for con-
trolling the financial credit risk of the supply chain using
blockchain technology are proposed, namely the principle
of sharing information about the financing process, the
basic principle of recognizing enterprise trust and the
principle of general cooperation for successful financing
[6]. Yan and others said that supply chain finance pro-
vides new financing channels for core enterprises and
upstream and downstream enterprises in supply chain
members. At the same time, it makes the management
of supply chain financial credit risk face new challenges
[7]. F Ying and others said that due to historical reasons
such as the industrial revolution, the research on supply
chain finance is earlier than that in China, has formed a
relatively perfect theoretical system, and the research is
relatively mature and in-depth, with a variety of perspec-
tives. In contrast, China’s research in this field started late,
but its practical development should be ahead of academic
research [8]. Qu, M. and others said that the research on
China’s supply chain finance is still in its infancy both
in practice and theory. In addition, China’s supply chain
finance has its own characteristics. Chinese scholars
should carry out localized supply chain finance research
based on this situation to improve the local applicability
of the research results [9]. Secondly, Ding, Q. and others
said that the credit risk evaluation model applied by tradi-
tional credit is difficult to be fully applicable to supply
chain finance. Supply chain finance takes transaction as
the background, requires that loan funds and goods oper-
ate in closed loop, and the repayment funds must be self-
owned funds, and introduce the information reference of
core enterprise credit in the supply chain system. There-
fore, for the credit risk control of supply chain finance,
it is necessary to build a new risk evaluation system to sci-
entifically predict the probability of credit risk [10].
Finally, Zeng, H. and others said that the conjecture and
research of blockchain technology breaking through the
bottleneck of supply chain financial development are
emerging one after another. How to apply it to supply
chain financial credit risk control is also the research
trend. Therefore, based on this technical perspective, it is
necessary to explore the mechanism of supply chain finan-
cial credit risk control and improve supply chain financial
credit risk control [11]. Wang, Z. and others said that the
research on financial credit risk control of the whole sup-
ply chain from the perspective of blockchain, from the
perspective of commercial banks, can help commercial
banks comprehensively evaluate the credit status of other
upstream and downstream enterprises with the help of
other participants in the supply chain, such as the credit
status of core enterprises and the supervision of logistics
enterprises [12]. Li, J. and others believe that from the
perspective of core enterprises, it can reduce the impair-
ment risk of collateral in the financing process and dis-
perse the default risk of losses caused by the default of
small and medium-sized enterprises. From the perspective
of logistics enterprises, it can effectively improve the trace-
ability of products and their ability to respond to emer-
gencies [13]. From the perspective of the whole supply
chain, it can make data interaction more convenient and
reduce the rise of transaction costs caused by information
asymmetry. Therefore, Kurt and others believe that the
key to the success of supply chain finance is how to com-
bine risk sources to strengthen risk management and effec-
tively control risks in the whole financing process [14].
3. Method
Value chain actors such as major businesses and SMEs are
important elements of the value chain financial system,
and SME finance can be smooth and depend on different
actors throughout the value chain in addition to that
financial institutions fulfill the important role of lending.
In fact, the trust endorsement of core enterprises is the
beginning of whether supply chain finance can implement
financing services. Because core enterprises grasp the core
value of the whole supply chain and play a key role in
integrating supply chain logistics, information flow and
capital flow, the operation status of core enterprises also
determines the transaction quality of upstream and down-
stream enterprises. Thus, the main enterprise’s own busi-
ness and the possibility of real financial credit collateral
for SMEs are the key points of control of the financial
credit risk of the value chain based on a cooperative
endorsement relationship between the main enterprise
2 Mobile Information Systems
and the SME, the principle of trust endorsement of the
main enterprise in the blockchain from a technical point
of view vision promotes fiduciary endorsement in the
value chain [15–16]. So, a good start to the financing pro-
cess is that the main enterprises act as loan guarantees for
SMEs, and at the same time the asymmetry of information
between the main enterprises and SMEs does not allow
them to determine which solution can provide the maxi-
mum benefits. Thus, using the accounts receivable finance
model as an example, major businesses as buyers in the
value chain, SMEs as sellers, both parties are upstream
and downstream of the value chain to establish fiduciary
endorsements. Open up access to value chain finance for
commercial banks, major enterprises provide SMEs, SMEs
receive finance from value chain financial services,
businesses have no incentive to provide SMEs, and SMEs
face difficulties in obtaining finance from value chain
financial services. Businesses are reluctant to provide guar-
antees to SMEs that face difficulties in obtaining finance
from value chain financial services. This article analyzes
the factors that influence the trust recognition of SMEs
by major businesses through the following evolutionary
games [17–18].
(1) Game subject
The financial financing of the value chain requires many
multiple fiduciary games with multiple actors involved.
(2) Strategy selection
The strategy set of both parties is divided into core enter-
prise C (guaranteed, non-guaranteed) and small and
medium-sized enterprise S (financing, non-financing)
(3) Income matrix
As shown in Table 1, when the core enterprises and
small and medium-sized enterprises do not establish a trust
endorsement relationship, the two sides maintain the status
quo, which is difficult to promote the implementation of
supply chain financial financing services. When both major
businesses and SMEs adopt the Guarantee Funding strategy,
both parties benefit from, for example, long-term partner-
ships with banks. In the accounts receivable financing mode,
Sc is the income from the stable supply of raw materials for
core enterprises, and Ss is the income from the financing of
small and medium-sized enterprises through supply chain
finance, so as to alleviate the capital pressure caused by
credit sales and quickly recover the payment for goods for
the next production. C1 is the cost of adopting guarantee
strategy for core enterprises, provide guarantees for small
and medium enterprises on behalf of the parent enterprise
at the same time as the costs of third-party Unicom logistics
enterprises to supervise and manage small and medium
enterprises. C2 is the cost when SMEs adopt financing
strategies, which represents the cost when SMEs cooperate
with core enterprises to ensure the smooth information flow
of logistics, information flow and capital flow, and the coop-
eration income obtained by core enterprises, Sc > C1, Ss > C2.

That is, the benefits of both parties actively seeking cooper-
ation are greater than the costs of this process. When the
main business guarantees SMEs, but SMEs refuse to finance,
the core enterprise bears the loss Cc, Representatives acting
as the main guarantor enterprises need to take on the lack
of trust in banks. When major enterprises do not guarantee
SMEs, but they are still actively involved in financing, SMEs
suffer losses Cs, Representing SMEs are unable to alleviate
working capital shortages while having narrower funding
channels [19]. It is assumed that in the early stage of the
game, the probability of core enterprises adopting guarantee
and non-guarantee is x and 1 − x, respectively, The probabil-
ity of SMEs choosing financing and not financing isy and 1
− y.
3.1. Evolutionary Game Benefits of Core Enterprises and
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
3.1.1. Earnings Analysis of Core Enterprises. It is known from
the model hypothesis and the payoffmatrix that when major
businesses are willing to provide collateral to finance SMEs,
the expected benefits of major businesses are:
Uc1 = y Sc − C1ð Þ + 1 − yð Þ −C1 − Ccð Þ ð1Þ
When the main enterprise is unwilling to provide SMEs,
the expected income of the main enterprise is:
Uc2 = 0 ð2Þ
Then the expected return of hybrid strategy of core
enterprise choosing the mixed strategy of guarantee and
non-guarantee is:
Uc = xUc1 + 1 − xð ÞUc2 = xUc1 ð3Þ
Analyze the dynamic replication equation from which
funding is derived for the selection of the main enterprise

F xð Þ = dx

= x Uc1 −Ucð Þ = x 1 − xð Þ ySc + yCc − C1 − Ccð Þ

3.1.2. Analysis of Income of Small and Medium Enterprises.
Similarly, the expected return functions of SMEs seeking
financing Us1 and non-financing Us2 and the expected
return functions of mixed strategies of SMEs Us are, respec-
tively:
Us1 = x Ss − C2ð Þ + 1 − xð Þ −C2 − Csð Þ
Us2 = 0
Us = yUd1 + 1 − yð ÞUs2 = yUs1
ð5Þ
Dynamic copying equation to analyze the thus obtained
financing choice S for SMEs:
F yð Þ = dy

3.1.3. Analysis of the Stability of the Equilibrium Point of

equations of SMEs with major enterprises form equations

The solution is as follows:

ð8Þ
Thus, we get 5 local points of equilibrium of game
behavior between SMEs and main enterprises, respectively
0ð0, 0Þ, Að0, 1Þ, Bð1, 0Þ, Cð1, 1Þ,DððC2 + Cs/Ss + CsÞ, ðC1 +

rium points are the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) of
the whole system, it can be obtained according to the stabil-
ity judgment method of Jacobian matrix. The partial deriva-
tives of x and y of dx/dt and dy/dt are obtained, respectively,
and the Jacobian matrix J of the system is:

The equilibrium point 0ð0, 0Þ, Að0, 1Þ, Bð1, 0Þ, Cð1, 1Þ,
DððC2 + Cs/Ss + CsÞ, ðC1 + Cc/Sc + CcÞÞ is substituted into
the Jacobian matrix J obtained in the above formula, the
trace of the matrix trðJÞ and the value of the determinant
det ðJÞ are obtained, and then the analysis results of five
local equilibrium points are obtained. Through the stability
analysis of Jacobian matrix, it is obtained that two of the five
local equilibrium points are stable, that is, both parties adopt
(guarantee, financing) or (non-guarantee, non-financing)
strategies, and there are another two unstable points and
one saddle point in the evolutionary system [22]. The system
finally tends to point (1, 1), that is, the enterprises of both
sides adopt the cooperative mode of guaranteed financing.
Or it finally tends to point (0, 0), that is, the enterprises of
both parties adopt the way of no guarantee and no financing.
3.2. Evolutionary Gaming Benefits of Commercial Banks and
SMEs in Supply Chain Finance
3.2.1. Income Analysis of Commercial Banks. When com-
mercial banks choose loans, their income is:
UA1 = β SA + πA − C0Að Þ + 1 − βð Þ πA − COA − CAð Þ ð10Þ
When a commercial bank chooses not to lend, its
income is:
UA2 = βπA + 1 − βð ÞπA ð11Þ
Thus, commercial banks choose between borrowing and
non-borrowing a mixed strategy that expects to make a
profit:
UA = αUA1 + 1 − αð ÞUA2 ð12Þ
Thus, it is possible to obtain a dynamic copying equation
chosen by a commercial bank A:
F Xð Þ = dx
dt
= α UA1 −UAð Þ = α 1 − αð Þ βSA + βCA − COA − CAð Þ
ð13Þ
3.2.2. Income Analysis of Commercial Banks. Similarly, the
expected return function UB1 and UB2 of small and
medium-sized enterprises’ trustworthiness and default and
the expected return function UB of their hybrid strategy
are as follows:
UB1 = α SB + πB − COBð Þ + 1 − αð Þ πB − COBð Þ
UB2 = α πB − COB − CBð Þ + 1 − αð ÞπB
UB = βUB1 + 1 − βð ÞUB2
ð14Þ
So SMBs choose a robust dynamic replication equation:
F yð Þ = dy
dt
= β UB1 −UBð Þ = β 1 − βð Þ α SB + CB + COBð Þ − COB½ �
ð15Þ
3.2.3. Analysis of the Stability of the Equilibrium Point of
the Model. Combine the dynamic replication equations of
commercial banks with SMEs into equations to match:
F αð Þ = dα
dt
= 0
F βð Þ = dβ
dt
= 0

ð16Þ
The solution is as follows:
α1 = 0, α2 = 1, α∗ = COB
SB + CB + COB
β1 = 0, β2 = 1, β∗ = COA + CA
SA + CA
ð17Þ
Thus, obtain 5 points of local equilibrium of the gaming
behavior of commercial banks with SMEs, which are 0 (0,0),
A (0,1), B (1,0), C (1,1), DððCOB/SB + CB + COBÞ, ðCOA + CA
/SA + CAÞÞ. To verify whether these five local equilibrium
points are the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) of the
whole system, it can be obtained according to the stability
judgment method of Jacobian matrix. The partial derivatives
of x and y of dα/dt and dy/dt are obtained, respectively, and
the Jacobian matrix J of the system is:
J =
1 − 2αð Þ βSA + βCA − COA − CAð Þ α 1 − αð Þ SA + CAð Þ
β −βð Þ SB + CB + COBð Þ 1 − 2βð Þ α SB + CB + COBð Þ − COB½ �
" #
ð18Þ
The equilibrium points 0 (0,0), A (0,1), B (1,0), C (1,1),
DððCOB/SB + CB + COBÞ, ðCOA + CA/SA + CAÞÞ are
substituted into the Jacobian matrix obtained in the above
formula, the trace of the matrix trðJÞ and the value of the
determinant det ðJÞ are obtained, and then the analysis
results of five local equilibrium points are obtained. It can
be seen that there are two possible trends in the evolution
process of the system. One is to evolve to 0 (0, 0), It does
not cooperate with each other on behalf of commercial
banks and SMEs, that is, commercial banks do not take loans
and SMEs violate their obligations; The second is to evolve
to C (1, 1), It represents a win-win financing on behalf of
commercial banks and small and medium enterprises, i.e.
loans from commercial banks, small and medium enter-
prises. As for which direction the saddle point evolves, it is
jointly affected by the initial state of the system, the initial
cost investment in the financing process, the benefits
brought by smooth financing, and the losses to be borne
by financing failure.
4. Results and Analysis
4.1. Numerical Modeling and Analysis of Factors Affecting
the Stability of the Evolution of Major Enterprises and Small
and Medium Enterprises
4.1.1. Influence of the Initial State of the System on the
Evolution of the System. For major enterprises and SMEs,
5Mobile Information Systems
the evolutionary path of the trajectory of their selection
strategy (provision, financing) can be modeled using the
following values. Given that C1 = C2 = 2, Sc = Ss = 5, Cc =
Cs = 3, Likelihood of establishing major businesses and
SMEs for the selection of provisioning and financing strat-
egies ðx, yÞ is (0.1, 0.9), (0.2, 0.9), (0.3, 0.9), (0.5, 0, 9),
(0.7, 0.9), and the time period is [0,2], that is, when
y=0.9. The readiness of the SME to finance is extremely
high, and the impact of the likelihood of adoption of the
provisioning strategy by the main enterprises on the evo-
lutionary results is shown in Figure 2.This shows that with
a greater likelihood of actively seeking funding for SMEs,
the system will eventually evolve to an optimal state of
collateral and financing, when the probability of accep-
tance of collateral by the main enterprise is greater than
a certain threshold level, and the faster it tends to be sta-
ble as the probability increases [23]..
The probability of the creation of the main enterprises
and the choice of the provision and financing strategy by
SMEs (x, y) is taken separately (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.2), (0.1,
0.3), (0.1, 0.7), (0.1, 0.9), respectively, and the time period
is [0, 2]. That is, when x=0.1, the financing willingness of
core enterprises is very low, the impact of the likelihood
of SMEs adopting a financing strategy on evolutionary out-
comes is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that when the
probability of accepting guarantees by major enterprises is
lower, systems continue to evolve to a state of insecurity
and underfunding, despite the increasing likelihood of
SME financing choices.
It can be concluded that the initial state of the coopera-
tive system between core enterprises and small and
medium-sized enterprises will affect the direction and speed
of system evolution. In reality, SMEs are overwhelmingly
proactive about financing, and when SMEs choose a financ-
ing strategy, the key to opening up value chain financial
financing services is whether major businesses are ready
for fiduciary endorsements. When the probability of the
guarantee of the main enterprise is greater than a certain
value, the system as a whole will tend to a stable state of
guarantee and financing of both parties. And when major
businesses are reluctant to provide collateral, even if this
makes the willingness of SMEs to seek funding extremely
high, the system as a whole is still difficult to open up collat-
eral and funding opportunities. Thus, collaboration between
major enterprises and SMEs in value chain financial financ-
ing is based on the fact that both parties are in the same
value chain, that SMEs have a demand for financing and that
value chain financial services chains will only be released
when the main businesses are ready for a fiduciary endorse-
ment to SMEs [24].
4.1.2. The Benefits Sc and Ss of Bilateral Cooperation and Its
Impact on System Evolution. Sc and Ss the income
distribution obtained by core enterprises and small and
medium-sized enterprises in supply chain financial financ-
ing. Given the initial value of the system (0.5, 0.5), that is,
the probability of core enterprises and small and medium-
sized enterprises choosing guarantee and financing strategies
is 0.5. Set C1 = C2 = 2, Cc = Cs = 3, time period as [0,2].
When Ss = 5, taking into account the impact of the change
of Sc on the system evolution. When Sc = 6, Sc = 11, Ss = 18,
respectively, the evolution trend of the system over time is
shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that when the income value
obtained by the core enterprise from the guarantee increases,
the core enterprise will be more inclined to adopt the guar-
antee strategy. Similarly, when Ss = 5, taking into account
the impact of the change of Ss on the system evolution.
When Ss = 6, Ss = 11, Ss = 18, respectively, considering the
impact of the change on the system evolution at that time,
the evolution trend of the system over time is shown in
Figure 5. From this it can be concluded that, for mainstream
enterprises and SMEs, if they benefit more from guarantees
and financing, then mainstream enterprises actively provide
guarantees to SMEs in the financial services value chain,
reducing the difficulty of financing SMEs and thereby stim-
ulating development. of enterprises throughout the value
chain, creating a beneficial cycle of value chain financing,
creating a win-win situation between major enterprises
and SMEs.

4.1.3. The Cost C1 and C2of Cooperation between the Two
Sides and Its Impact on System Evolution. C1 and C2 is costs
required in accepting guarantees and financing by major
businesses and SMEs, such as sorting out bill information,
transaction information sharing, etc. Given the initial value
of the system (0.5, 0.5), set Sc = Ss = 5, Cc = Cs = 3, time
period as [0, 2]. When C2 = 2, taking into account the impact
of the change of C1 on the system evolution. When C2 = 2,
C2 = 4, C2 = 6, respectively, the evolution trend of the system
over time is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that when the
cooperation cost of the core enterprise increases in the guar-
antee process, the core enterprise will be more inclined to
adopt the strategy of non-guarantee. Similarly, when C1 = 2
, considering the impact of the change of C2 on the system
evolution, when C2 = 2, C2 = 4, C2 = 6, respectively, the evo-
lution trend of the system over time is shown in Figure 7. It
follows that when SMEs increase the cost of cooperation in
the financing process, this makes SMEs more inclined to
pursue a non-financing strategy. From this it can be con-
cluded that, for both mainstream enterprises and SMEs,
the higher the costs required for this provisioning process,
and the more SMEs engage in seeking financial services
along the value chain, the more they do not have. Incentives
to seek guarantees and cooperation in financing.
4.1.4. The Impact of Loss of Cc and Cs on System Evolution.
Cc is the losses suffered by small and medium-sized enter-
prises when they choose not to finance, and Cs is the losses
suffered by small and medium-sized enterprises when they
seek banks to provide supply chain financial financing ser-
vices, while the core enterprises do not provide credit guar-
antee for small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the
initial value of the system (0.5, 0.5), set Sc = Ss = 5, C1 = C2
= 2, time period as [0, 2]. When Cs = 3, considering the
impact of the change of Cc on the system evolution, take
Cc = 2, Cc = 4, Cc = 6, respectively, the evolution trend of
the system over time is shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that
the higher the loss Cs suffered by the core enterprise, the
lower the probability of the core enterprise choosing guaran-
tee, so that the system is in an unsecured state. Similarly,
when Cc = 3, considering the impact of the change of Cs on
the system evolution and taking Cs = 2, Cs = 4, Cs = 6,
respectively, the evolution trend of the system over time is
shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the higher the loss
Cssuffered by small and medium-sized enterprises, the lower
the probability of small and medium-sized enterprises
choosing financing, so that the system is in a non-
financing state. It can be concluded that for core enterprises

and small and medium-sized enterprises, if they seek guar-
antee and financing cooperation in order to carry out supply
chain financial services, because the higher the loss suffered
by the other party to give up cooperation, the more difficult
it is for both parties to form cooperation, which will directly
lead them to choose to give up guarantee and financing
cooperation.
4.2. Numerical Modeling and Analysis of Factors Affecting
the Sustainability of Financing Development between
Commercial Banks and SMEs
4.2.1. Influence of the Initial State of the System on the
Evolution of the System. For commercial banks and small
and medium-sized enterprises, the evolution path of their
selection (loan, trustworthiness) strategy can be simulated
and analyzed through the following numerical values. Given
SA = SB = 5, COA = COB = 2, CA = CB = 3, let the initial values
be (0.1, 0.5), (0.3, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.7, 0.5), (0.9, 0.5), that is,
when y=0.5, the likelihood that small and medium-sized
enterprises will commit themselves remains unchanged.
The impact of the probability of commercial banks taking
loans on the evolution results is shown in Figure 10. It can
be seen that when the probability of commercial banks tak-
ing loans is greater than a certain threshold, the system will
eventually evolve to the optimal state of loans and compli-
ance, both parties can smoothly carry out supply chain
financial financing. And with the increase of this probability,
the faster the system tends to a stable state.
Let the initial values be (0.5, 0.1), (0.5, 0.3), (0.5, 0.5),
(0.5, 0.7), (0.5, 0.9), respectively, that is, when x=0.5, the
probability of acceptance of loans by commercial banks does

not change, the influence of the probability of acceptance by
small and medium-sized enterprises of Non-Violations on
evolutionary results is shown in Figure 11, from which it
can be seen that with the probability of acceptance by small
and medium-sized enterprises, Non-violations are greater
than a certain threshold. The system will eventually evolve
to the optimal state of loan and compliance, and both parties
will smoothly carry out supply chain financial financing.
With the increase of this probability, the faster the system
tends to a stable state [25].
From this it can be concluded that the initial state in
which commercial banks and systems of cooperation
between SMEs are located will affect the direction and pace
of evolution of the system.
4.2.2. The Impact of Income SA and SB on System Evolution
when Financing Is Smooth. SA and SB are the income distri-
bution obtained by commercial banks and small and
medium-sized enterprises after successful completion of
supply chain financial financing. Given the initial value
of the system (0.5, 0.5), that is, the probability of commercial
banks and small and medium-sized enterprises choosing
cooperation strategy is 0.5. Set COA = COB = 2, CA = CB = 3,
when SB = 5, taking into account the impact of the change
of SA on the system evolution. Take SA = 5, SA = 10, SA =
20, respectively, results are shown in Figure 12 below. It

can be seen that when the excess return obtained by com-
mercial banks from financing increases, commercial banks
tend to adopt the loan strategy. Similarly, when SA = 5, con-
sidering the impact of the change of SB on the system evolu-
tion. Take SB = 5, SB = 10, SB = 20, respectively, results are
shown in Figure 13 below. It can be seen from this that with
an increase in the excess profits received by small and
medium enterprises from financing, this makes small and
medium enterprises prone to non-disruptive tactics. This
suggests a conclusion: the greater the surplus of funding rev-
enues, the more they prefer a cooperation strategy, that is,
the more commercial banks prefer loans, the more SMEs
prefer Non-Breaker. Therefore, in the process of coopera-
tion, we should try our best to keep the information of both
parties unobstructed, and the greater the amount of infor-
mation obtained, so as to ensure that both parties can obtain
as much income as possible from supply chain financial
financing.
4.2.3. The Impact of Loss Factors CA and CB on System
Evolution. CA and CB are the losses suffered by commercial
banks and small and medium-sized enterprises in financing
cooperation due to the default of the other party. Given the
initial value of the system (0.5, 0.5), that is, the probability of
commercial banks and small and medium-sized enterprises
choosing cooperation strategy is 0.5. Given SA = SB = 5,
COA = COB = 2, when CB = 3, considering the impact of CA
on the system evolution. Take CA = 3, CA = 6, CA = 9,
respectively, and get the results as shown in Figure 14. It
can be seen that when the losses suffered by commercial
banks due to the default of small and medium-sized enter-
prises increase, commercial banks tend to adopt the strategy
of no loan, making the system stable in the state of no loan.
When CA = 3, considering the impact of CBon system
evolution. Take CB = 3, CB = 6, CB = 9, respectively, and get
the results as shown in Figure 15. It can be seen from this
that with an increase in losses incurred by small and
medium-sized enterprises due to the fact that commercial
banks did not take loans, this, rather, will make them more
active in applying the Non-Disruption strategy, and the
greater the losses, the faster SMEs will be inclined to Non-
violation. From this it can be concluded that in the process
of financing the value chain, the greater the losses incurred
by commercial banks due to the default of SMEs, the more
difficult it is for commercial banks to lend to SMEs, and,
conversely, SMEs themselves finance commercial banks
through the financial services of the supply chain. Chains,
and SMEs will actively push to reduce the risk losses of com-
mercial banks and, therefore, receive financing.
5. Conclusion
On the basis of supply chain financial services, this paper
mainly takes small and medium-sized enterprises in supply
chain financial services as the study object to clarify the log-
ical relationship between supply chain finance, supply chain
financial credit risk control and block chain theory. Start
with a painful solution to the problem of financial develop-
ment of the supply chain within the framework of
blockchain technology, i.e. from the three principles that
the trust of the main enterprises, the exchange of informa-
tion on the financing process, and the successful co-
financing in general, is possible with the analysis of the
control of blockchain technology over financial credit risks
in the supply chain. Therefore, thinking that the credit risk
during the finance process of financed supply chain control
will not only consider small and medium enterprises this
single financed object, but participating in supply chain
