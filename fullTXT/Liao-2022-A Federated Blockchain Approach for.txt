Abstract: Modern life is making people infertile. Giving birth later in life is wreaking havoc on our
fertility and threatening human survival. Smart cities intend to optimize the quality of life of their
citizens by utilizing technology for smarter living. This research first identifies the requirements
and business opportunities of using advanced technology for smarter fertility preservation and
assisted reproduction in smart cities. A federated blockchain approach is proposed for the alliance of
integrated commercial egg banks (ICEBs). In particular, we designed a membership fee rebate (MFR)
mechanism that offers incentives for blockchain creations in the egg banking alliance. We formulated
the MFR problem into a leader–followers Stackelberg game whose objectives are (1) to maximize
the benefits of forming the alliance (the leader) and (2) to maximize the benefits in each ICEB (the
follower). We developed an iterative scheme that utilizes mathematical programming techniques to
solve the two-level, Stackelberg game problem. With a given set of parameters of the alliance and
membership fee function, and the average number of blocks generated for an oocyte, the iterative
scheme achieves the optimal solution for the MFR rate per block created . A numerical example
demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the proposed iterative scheme. Numerical results
show that it achieves good solutions in adding a small to medium-sized new ICEB to the existing
alliance. The proposed federated approach lays the foundation for developing a blockchain-based
egg banking platform.

1. Introduction
“I want to be a mom!”—a strong but helpless voice frequently heard in clinical in-
fertility practice. Most people in the world have the strong desire to conceive children
during their lifetimes. However, with a trend toward late childbearing, more and more
people are suffering from infertility in modern life. The global fertility rate continues to
declinin and has hit an all-time low during the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. About half of
the world’s population lives in low-fertility countries whose fertility rates are less than
replacement level—the average number of children born per woman needed to replace a
population from one generation to next generation [2]. In the United States, about 15% of
couples have infertility problems [3]. The contributing factors, including giving birth later
in life, air pollution, human-made chemicals, tobacco or alcohol use, overweight or under-
weight, diabetes and more, are wreaking havoc on our fertility and threatening human
survival [4]. Women are deferring child birth until their thirties and forties. This has led to
female age-related infertility, the most common cause of infertility today [5].
While many countries and municipalities have embraced the concept of smart
cities [6,7] for years, a precise definition of “smart cities” has remained elusive. Tech
giants have imagined the way that technology could be used to make cities smart. City
majors and people running for election want smart cities to attract more businesses and
talent to make their cities more prosperous, more livable and more job-rich. Their dream
for smart cities is to fulfill the needs of their citizens while optimizing the quality of life

of their citizens by utilizing technology for smarter living [8–12]. Among modern citizens’
needs, fertility preservation and assisted reproduction [13,14] are crucial considerations for
smart cities.
Fertility preservation and assisted reproduction help reproductive-aged young women
retain their fertility to have biological children in the future. Thanks to the advance
of vitrification technology [15], efficient and safe oocyte cryopreservation [16] (or egg
freezing [17]) is considered the most applicable option for fertility preservation. The
situations in which women demand egg freezing are various. The female may expect future
reproduction prior to cancer treatment or be at risk for a medical condition that may impact
fertility in future. Alternatively, there may be extra embryos left during an in vitro fertility
(IVF) cycle. Oocyte donation to donor egg banks for IVF is another one. Finally, the female
may extend childbearing years in order to counter future infertility [18]. Egg freezing
empowers women to preserve their eggs either for use when they are ready to have babies;
or for donation or sale of unused eggs to infertile women. Analysis of the U.S. National
Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) data during period of Years 2013 through 2015
indicates that utilization of traditional fresh oocyte donation rapidly declined by 32.9%,
whereas frozen oocyte donation increased by 44.4% [19]. The egg banking system was thus
developed and is a kind of insurance against the female biological clock.
An egg bank [20], also called “donor egg bank” or “commercial egg bank” (CEB), is a
commercial repository that saves cryopreserved human eggs with the purpose of female
fertility preservation for future use. An egg bank is an entity which provides cryopreserved
oocytes to intended recipients of egg donation. In addition to oocyte cryostorage for fertility
preservation, it offers strong benefits in terms of scheduling flexibility, improved clinical
efficiencies and a wider immediate inventory choice. As shown in Figure 1, the CEB is
a part of the landscape in integrated commercial egg banking (ICEB) whose functions
cover cryopreservation, ART services portal, extensive medical assessment, rigorous donor
screening, networking of affiliated IVF centers, medical training and surrogate agency.
There are several parties involved in an ICEB, including intended parents, donors of
eggs, IVF laboratories, partnered CEBs, courier services providers and transportation,
lodging and foods providers. Effective fertility preservation and assisted reproduction
demand high quality environment control of temperature, pH and osmolality; low oxygen,
volatile organic compounds and particulate matter; and low aspiration pressure [21,22]. IoT
(Internet of Things) or AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) sensors are used to monitor
and measure many sources of data for environment control in IVF clinics, laboratories and
egg banks. Sensors are crucial to the operations of the IVF clinical instruments, laboratory,
egg banking facilities and devices for cryopreservation.
Figure 1. The landscape of an ICEB.
Smart Cities 2022, 5 585
Daily activities in an ICEB use and generate a huge amount of data. In additional to
traditional relational databases, an ICEB utilizes NoSQL databases for managing big data
analytics. Management of the data in an ICEB involves the integration of various entities
with heterogeneous data stored in different relational and NoSQL databases. Storing,
updating and replicating these data are restricted to one or a few authorized entities that
have to be trusted not to mess up the data or get hacked. Effective integration of these
relational and NoSQL databases is quite challenging and can create a big headache for the
IT team in an ICEB.
Differently from existing biobanks that collect biological samples of tissue of human
beings, an ICEB is novel and focuses on the choice of the depositor, who must invest money
and body to obtain the banked entity [23]. In addition to the safety, efficacy and cost of
IVF treatments, egg banking also faces many other challenges, such as medical, ethical,
moral and social concerns [24,25]. Among these, issues of integrity, consistency, privacy
and physical protection of eggs and their associated data are mostly addressed along the
entire egg banking process—from the retrieval of an egg to its successful placement in the
uterus, or the eventual death by discard or removal from its egg banking.
Blockchain technology [26] uses a distributed data structure in creating the digital
ledger of data and sharing it among a network of participating nodes. It uses cryptography
and allows each participant in the network to maintain the digital ledger in a secure way.
Blockchain technology is useful for applications that need redundant copies in multiple
distributed computers, trust among all the participants and lack a trusted third party [27].
Compared to the traditional databases, blockchain technology is good at the integration of
systems in supply chain management system or in a federated consortium of independent
parties where there is more than one authorized entity and there is a trust deficit between
the parties [28]. The advantages of using blockchain technology for egg banking are to
ensure transparency and security of the operations of eggs and their data in the egg banking
process. The decentralized structure of blockchain allows all parties to participate in supply
chain management of the eggs. Blockchain can establish an organization-encompassing
platform to exchange information to meet the requirements of managing physical eggs and
their data in the egg banking process. This paper deals with the coalition of federated ICEBs
and presents the preliminary design of an on-going project: a Blockchain-based, Automated,
Biomedical Implementation for Egg Saving (BABIES) platform for management of the egg
banking operations in the federated ICEBs.
Blockchain technology maintains a distributed ledger of immutable, auditable and
single-version-of-truth data. Blockchain technology holds many important advantages
in decentralization, data integrity, security, transparency, audibility and automation. It
enables simple, traceable and trustworthy data sharing in a data ecosystem. A blockchain
is a decentralized tamper-proof ledger which keeps an append-only, sequenced set of
transactions. Before adding a transaction to a blockchain, a new block is created for the
transaction and the block for the transaction has to be verified through a decentralized
consensus process among the nodes in the blockchain network. Blockchain technology has
a wide range of applications in smart cities [29–31]. In this paper, a node that participates
in the consensus process is called a block creator or a creator. Such operations are called
block creation or creation. A prime creator is a creator that receives a request for creating a
new block and creates the new block. In this paper, only the prime creator can receive an
incentive for each block creation.
While public blockchain networks suffer from high costs and long delays in creation
and synchronization of new blocks, private blockchain networks allow only invited (or
permissioned) participants to join, with access being controlled by a single organization.
Compared to public and private blockchain networks, federated blockchain (also knows as
consortium blockchain) [32] networks are managed by consortia of pre-selected participants
or organizations. A federated blockchain has the advantages of modest cost and computing
requirements, good scalability and short delay. However, allying a blockchain consortium
demands cooperation among a number of participants or organizations. A participant or
Smart Cities 2022, 5 586
organization that considers teaming up with its partners or even its competitors, must
weigh the potential benefits of cooperation and the possible conflicts of interest. Each
participant or organization requires sufficient motivation and incentive to join the alliance
and remain faithful to the alliance.
This research deals with the smart application that utilizes blockchain technology
for egg banking of fertility preservation and assisted reproduction in smart cities. We
first identify the requirements and business opportunities involved in using advanced
technology for smarter egg banking. Then, we propose a federated blockchain approach
for the alliance of ICEBs. In particular, we focuse on the optimal design of an incentive
mechanism for blockchain operations of egg banking, from which a decision-making
problem to find the best membership fee rebate (MFR) rate per block creation is modeled.
We formulate the MFR optimization problem into a leader–followers Stackelberg game
whose objectives are to maximize the benefits of forming the alliance (the leader) and to
maximize the benefits in each ICEB (the followers). We developed an iterative scheme that
utilizes mathematical programming techniques to solve the two-level cooperative game
problem. With a given set of parameters of the alliance and membership fee function, and
the average number of blocks generated for an oocyte, the iterative scheme achieves the
optimal solution for the MFR rate per block creation.
The main contributions of this paper are fivefold:
(1) We propose a novel federated business model for ICEBs and utilize blockchain tech-
nology to ensure safe and secure egg banking operations for fertility preservation
and assisted reproduction in smart cities. To the best of found knowledge, there are
no research results or clinical applications using blockchain technology for safe and
secure data exchange in egg banking.
(2) We developed an MFR mechanism for the incentives for blockchain operations of egg
banking.
(3) We formulated the MFR problem as a two-level Stackelberg game between the egg
banking alliance and the ICEBs. We utilized mathematical programming techniques to
find the optimal MFR rate for the incentives of blockchain operations in egg banking.
(4) We developed a federated egg banking incentive solution (FEBIS) algorithm to deter-
mine the optimal MFR rate per block creation and the optimal number of oocytes in
each ICEB to participate the egg banking alliance.
(5) This paper presents the preliminary design, components and functionalities of the
developing Blockchain-based, Automated, Biomedical Implementation for Egg Saving
(BABIES) platform.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related
works of fertility preservation, applications of blockchain in the healthcare domain and
game-theoretic incentive mechanisms for blockchains. Section 3 identifies the requirements
and business opportunities of egg banking, presents the alliance business model of ICEBs
and proposes the federated blockchain approach for egg banking. In Section 4 we develop
the optimal design of an MFR mechanism for blockchain operations. Section 5 reports the
numerical tests and analysis of the results. Section 6 presents the system architecture and
software stack of the Blockchain-based, Automated, Biomedical Implementation for Egg
Saving (BABIES) platform. Section 7 concludes this paper.
2. Related Works
Since the birth of the first “test tube baby” in 1978, medical research and clinical efforts
have devoted in ART and helped millions of desperate-for-babies people to conceive [33]. In
the United States, ART accounted for 2.1% of all infants born in 2019 [34]. As the most effective
form of ART, IVF deals with complicated procedures to help people with fertilization, embryo
development and implantation for the conception of babies. IVF can be done either with
fresh donor oocytes or through cryopreservation and thaw cycles of donor oocytes [35]. As
cryopreservation techniques have evolved, vitrification has played a vital part in contemporary
ART. The success rates with donor oocyte vitrification show similar clinical efficiency to that of
Smart Cities 2022, 5 587
IVF with fresh donor oocytes [36]. Oocyte vitrification and saving provides an efficient option
for fertility preservation for young women under 38 years old [37]. Egg saving empowers
women to continue their careers and find their right partners with no fear of jeopardizing
fertility. Like egg donation, egg saving has faced ethical, legal and religious concerns [38]. A
growing and diverse transformation on technical, regulatory and commercial aspects has
reshaped the assisted reproduction landscape [39].
The establishment of an egg banking facility requires an expert team of fertility special-
ists, embryologists and skilled laboratory operators in oocyte vitrification; and a complex
support team dealing with legal, recruiting, compliance and marketing tasks [40]. Effective
egg banking demands a set of optimized ART protocols that are implemented in a smart,
automated and integrated biomedical platform both for safe, reliable and secure oocyte
storage and transport during cryopreservation, and for data security, privacy and analytics
of bioinformatics.
Over the last decade, CEBs have emerged and been evolving into several operational
models—affiliated, networked and central [41,42]. In the affiliated model, the CEB only
works with its affiliated IVF clinic. In the networked model, the CEB works with the
network of affiliated IVF clinics. In the central model, the CEB works with any interested
IVF clinic if it is technically, legally and commercially feasible. All these operational models
are centered on only a single CEB. While egg banking is now gaining more professional and
public acceptance, CEBs are grasping the great opportunity. However, existing CEBs are
facing severe challenges of operational inefficiency, high costs and low customer satisfaction.
The emergence of ICEB demands a paradigm shift for more collaboration and coalition
among egg banking facilities to create high economic efficiency, lower operating costs and
provide high customer satisfaction.
Applications of blockchain technology in the healthcare sector have been emerging for
years [43–45]. Hickman et al. [46] provided a systematic review of the use of blockchain
technology in the healthcare industry and found no solutions proposed for IVF or fertility.
Benchoufi and Ravaud [47] explored the core functionalities of blockchain applied to clini-
cal trials. The use of artificial intelligence and big data in reproductive medicine has just
begun [48]. Blockchain-based data sharing in ART is promising to promote collaborative
research and innovation while reducing the costs of validation and implementation of
artificial intelligence [49]. Yaqoob et al. [50] considered the application of blockchain for
healthcare data management systems to stimulate innovations and bring major improve-
ments. A thorough search of this relevant topic shows that there are no research results
or clinical applications using blockchain technology for safe and secure data exchange
throughout the egg banking process.
Numerous research efforts have adopted game theory as the analytic tool to elucidate
various facets in blockchain-related issues, such as security challenges, computational
power allocation, incentive consensus and energy trading [51]. Researchers have devel-
oped Stackelberg game [52] models to formulate the interactions in distributed blockchain
networks. Bai et al. [53] proposed a hybrid consortium blockchain architecture for public
participation in smart city governance. To deal with the risks of malicious attacks, they de-
veloped a Stackelberg-game-based incentive mechanism to encourage public participation
in the transaction verification process. Xiong et al. [54] used a two-stage Stackelberg game
model to deal with the interactions between the cloud/fog computing providers and the
block creators in the blockchain consensus process. By applying the pricing policy of the
same price to all creators, they validated the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium and
identified the best response strategies of the creators. Ding et al. [55] dealt with the pricing
and budget allocation problem between edge servers and IoT devices, whose interactions
were modeled as a multi-leader, multi-follower Stackelberg game. Hu et al. [56] designed
a novel autonomous client participation scheme to incentivize a federation of clients to
train a machine learning model. Their minority-game-based client participation scheme
can boost utility by 39% to 48% and reduce volatility by 51% to 100%. We aimed to design
Smart Cities 2022, 5 588
an optimal incentive mechanism for blockchain operations in the alliance of ICEBs, where
the optimal incentive problem is modeled as a two-level Stackelberg game problem.
3. Federated Blockchain Approach for Egg Banking
3.1. Needs of Advanced Technology and Integration for Egg Banking
Successful egg banking services encompass a wide variety of activities, operations
and functions covering many domains, including environmental control, technology inno-
vation, service optimization, compassionate care, partnership management and continuous
improvements. Figure 2 illustrates the activities, operations and functions for egg banking
services.
Figure 2. Activities, operations and functions for successful egg banking services.
People spending their time and money on egg banking are looking for fertility preser-
vation and expect someday to have healthy babies—the ultimate value of egg banking. To
let people have healthy babies, egg banking must provide careful, legal, safe, predictable,
quality and friendly operations and services. In ART practice, egg banking uses many
applications and systems to support its activities, operations and functions, including
hospitality services, protocol management, a picture archiving and communication sys-
tem (PACS), access control, digital identity, analytics, intelligent medicine, automation,
laboratory integration, a laboratory information management system (LIMS), a hospital
information system (HIS), a portal and case management. However, most of these systems
are poorly integrated and composed of silos of raw health data.
To achieve seamless integration of the systems, egg banking is embracing advanced
technology for its system integration and operations automation [57,58]. This research
envisions the opportunities for the amalgamation of different cutting-edge technologies
with smarter operations for better egg banking services. Promising technologies for effective
egg banking include blockchain technology, X-as-a-Service, Artificial Intelligence of Things
(AIoT), edge computing, security, radio frequency identification (RFID), statistical learning,
machine learning, knowledge inferencing, end-to-end tracking, automated loading and
unloading, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA), small cells,
microservices and so on.
3.2. Federated Egg Banking Business Model
We propose a federated operational business model for egg banking. As shown
in Figure 3, two or more ICEBs form a federated egg banking ecosystem. Each ICEB
Smart Cities 2022, 5 589
established on its own protocols, defines its own performance indicators and provides egg
banking services to its affiliated IVF clinics or fertility centers. An IVF clinic or fertility
center may belong to one or more ICEB, depending on its operational efficiency and
effectiveness. In the federated ecosystem, each ICEB can exchange secured medical data
and provide frozen oocytes to other ICEBs for commercial purposes.
Figure 3. The federated egg banking business model.
Differently from the existing affiliated, networked and central CEB operational
models [20,41,42], the proposed federated business model extends the boundaries and
flexibility of the egg banking business. It allows each ICEB to make use of the ecosystem
for its own benefit while collaborating with other ICEBs in the ecosystem. However, many
challenges arise with the federated business model. There are concerns of data integrity, se-
curity, visibility and ownership for data exchange among the ICEBs in the ecosystem. There
are also issues of oocyte safety, identification and consistency in storage and transportation
along the whole egg banking process. This paper adopts blockchain technology to tackle
the challenges of data integrity, security, visibility and ownership for data exchange among
the ICEBs. Additionally, blockchain technology facilitates the safety, identification and
consistency of oocytes along the entire egg banking process.
The key to the proposed federated egg banking business model is to form the egg
banking alliance (EBA). An EBA is a strategic alliance of a number of ICEBs that cooperate in
terms of sharing resources (i.e., oocytes and their data in each ICEB) to achieve some specific
goals. The main purpose of the EBA is to increase the market demands for the alliance
members, i.e., the ICEBs. For a participating ICEB, the EBA offers a great opportunity to
expand its economies of scope through diversification of available oocytes. The member
ICEB can extend its existing capabilities by providing a wider variety of oocytes available
for patients to choose. A primitive motivation for an ICEB to join the EBA is the benefits
from increasing its profits through resource sharing. Managing interactions among the
ICEBs from the EBA is challenging. Fair allocation of benefits and obligations is the key to
establishing and sustaining the EBA. In order for a participating ICEB to remain faithful to
the alliance, the EBA should share the benefits from cooperation fairly among its member
ICEBs and apply fair membership rules to its member ICEBs.
Smart Cities 2022, 5 590
We developed a two-level Stackelberg game to formulate the interactions between the
EBA and the ICEBs in the proposed federated egg banking business model. In the upper
level, the goal of the EBA is to maximize the joint economies of scope of the alliance, while
allocating a portion of benefits from cooperation to its member ICEBs as incentives. On the
other hand, in the lower level, the goal of each ICEB is to maximize its benefits to join and
remain in the alliance, while keeping its expenses lower than its budget. For an ICEB, its
benefits from cooperation include the gain of its extra economies of scope and the sharing
of benefits of cooperation. In the model, knowledge about other participants is available to
all the participants, making it a game with complete information.
3.3. Federated Blockchain Approach
Blockchain enables distributed trust over the Internet and simplifies complex transac-
tions. Based on the proposed federated egg banking business model, this section presents
a federated blockchain approach for egg banking of fertility preservation and assisted
reproduction in smart cities. The federated blockchain approach adopts the federated
blockchain (or consortium blockchain) technology [32]. A federated blockchain is a permis-
sioned blockchain that can offer the advantages of faster speed, higher throughput, privacy
and low power consumption, compared to permissionless public blockchain technology
(e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum). The federated blockchain approach defines two types of
participants: (1) blockchain users and (2) block creators. Only verified blockchain users are
allowed to have their own individual copies of the blockchain; and only preselected block
creators can participate in the consensus mechanism in the blockchain, i.e., maintaining
and determining the true state of the blockchain. Federated blockchain technology is
useful for the egg banking ecosystem where the identity of each participant—the ICEB,
intended parent, donor, IVF lab, surrogate agent, courier service provider or transporta-
tion/lodging/foods provider—can be pre-determined and easily verified. In the feder-
ated blockchain approach, all the verified participants in the egg banking ecosystem are
blockchain users, but only the preselected ICEBs from the alliance EBA are block creators.
Figure 4 shows the block creators (the ICEBs) and blockchain users (all the participants in
egg banking activities) in the federated egg banking blockchain system.
Figure 4. Block creators and blockchain users in the federated egg banking blockchain system.
3.4. Federated Egg Banking Blockchain
The federated egg banking blockchain is a blockchain of oocytes which are created,
stored and maintained in the federated, blockchain-based egg banking system. The fed-
erated egg banking blockchain records all the transaction data of every oocyte, starting
Smart Cities 2022, 5 591
from oocyte retrieval to fertilization, if the oocyte is lucky enough to survive to the end.
In the egg banking system, a transaction is an activity or information update of an oocyte.
Each transaction creates and appends a new block to the blockchain. In practice, dozens of
transaction records are generated along the egg banking lifecycle of an oocyte. Figure 5
illustrates a typical egg banking workflow for an oocyte.
Figure 5. A typical egg banking workflow from oocyte retrieval to fertilization.
The federated egg banking blockchain stores a cascade of blocks of oocytes’ transac-
tions in the egg banking system. Each block contains a block header and a body. A block
header is composed of the hash of its previous block, the Merkle root, a timestamp of the
block and nonce (number only used once) used by creators. The body in a block stores a
Merkle tree of transaction data. In the body, transaction data are hashed first, paired with
one another and structured into a Merkle tree. The root of the Merkle tree is called the
Merkle root, which has all the information of the transaction data in the block. Due to its
tree structure, verification with a Merkle tree is very efficient.
The federated egg banking blockchain system adopts the Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (PBFT) [59] consensus protocol in appending a new block. In the consensus
process, only block creators can participate. The creation of a new block is successful only
after the majority of the block creators (more than two-third of the creators) agree upon the
new block. For each block creation, the federated egg banking blockchain system provides
an incentive to the prime creator that receives the request of a transaction and creates the
new block.
The blockchain operations in the federated egg banking blockchain system can be
summarized as follows:
(1) A blockchain user initiates a request to a prime creator for a new transaction for
an oocyte.
(2) The prime creator disseminates the transaction into a block.
(3) The prime creator multicasts the new block to the federated blockchain system.
(4) All blockchain creators verify the block and multicast to the other creators.
(5) The majority of block creators reach a consensus and agree upon the new block.
(6) The new block is appended to the blockchain. Every blockchain user updates its local
replica of the blockchain.
Smart Cities 2022, 5 592
(7) Only the prime creator of the new block receives an incentive.
Figure 6 depicts the blockchain operations in the federated egg banking blockchain
system with I blockchain creators.
Figure 6. The blockchain operations in the federated egg banking blockchain system.
In the federated egg banking blockchain system, the success of a consensus process
requires all the distributed block creators (the ICEBs in the EBA) to participate and reach
an agreement on whether to accept a new transaction of an oocyte or not. Completing
a consensus process demands computing power from the block creators. In the EBA,
every ICEB has to spend capital on information technology (IT) to support the blockchain
operations. We designed a membership fee rebate (MFR) mechanism as the incentive to
financially motivate the ICEBs for their contributions to blockchain operations in the EBA.
4. Optimal Incentive Design for Egg Banking Blockchain Operations
We propose an incentive mechanism that offers a membership fee rebate (MFR) to the
prime creator of a new block in egg banking blockchain operations. The rebate is paid to
each creator (the ICEB) annually and on a pro rata basis according to the total number of
new blocks created by the creator during the past year. The effectiveness of the proposed
incentive mechanism depends on the selection of a good MFR rate to encourage the ICEBs
to contribute to egg banking blockchain operations. The higher the MFR rate is, the more
the ICEBs will be willing to participate in the alliance. However, on the other hand, the
alliance has to pay more for MFRs with a higher rebate rate. Selection of a good rate for
MFR must leverage between the cooperation benefits vs. costs. This section presents the
optimal design for the MFR rate as the incentive for blockchain operations in the federated
egg banking blockchain system.
4.1. Problem Formulation
Consider a federated egg banking blockchain system with a number of block creators
(the ICEBs) that are interested to form the alliance (the EBA). Define customer satisfaction
as a function of number of candidate oocytes for patients to choose. Additionally, define
member participation as a function of MRF rate (i.e., the average MFR per block creation).
The goal to form the alliance is to maximize the overall customer satisfaction and member
participation from cooperation of the member ICEBs. The objective of each ICEB is to
maximize its profit from joining the alliance and its received MFRs as the incentive for
its blockchain operations. Each ICEB decides on the number of its oocytes participating
in the alliance. Membership fees are collected from every member ICEB to establish the
alliance and support the alliance service. Some of the membership fees are rebated as the
incentives to member ICEBs for their support to the blockchain operations. The amount of
Smart Cities 2022, 5 593
the membership fee paid by an ICEB depends on its number of oocytes participating in
the alliance.
To continue the development of the optimal incentive design, assumptions and nota-
tion are listed as follows:
Assumptions:
(1) All the decisions of the ICEBs are economically rational.
(2) All the ICEBs have perfect information.
(3) All the ICEBs have freedom of choice to join or not to join the alliance.
(4) The decision for an ICEB to join the alliance only depends on the MFR rate and its
number of oocytes participating in the alliance.
(5) Each oocyte is unique and distinct.

ui : number of oocytes in Bi to participate in A, 0 ≤ ui ≤ Oi
v : MFR rate per block creation, v > 0
Without loss of generality, assume that all the ICEBs in the alliance A are sequenced in
an ascending order according to their numbers of oocytes in the ICEBs, that is,
{Bi|O1 ≤ O2 ≤ · · · ≤ OI}.
Let W−1(xex) = x ≤ −1,− 1
e ≤ xex < 0 denote the second branch of the Lambert
W function.
This paper adopts the following four functions to model the objectives of the optimal
incentive problem:
(i) The satisfaction function φ(x) for customer satisfaction from the egg banking service
with x participating oocytes:
φ(x) = ln(1 + ax), where x ≥ 0; (1)
(ii) The participation function for an MFR rate of x per block creation:
η(x) = bx, where x ≥ 0; (2)
(iii) The membership fee function ξ(x) for participating x oocytes in A:
ξ(x) = m ln(1 + nx), where x ≥ 0; (3)
(iv) The utility function for profit ψ(x) of participating x oocytes in A:
ψ(x) =
1
1 + e−rx , where x ≥ 0. (4)
Smart Cities 2022, 5 594
Note that all the above four functions, Equations (1)–(4) are strictly increasing on x ≥ 0.
The second derivatives of φ(x), ξ(x) and ψ(x) are negative and the second derivative of
η(x) is 0. The above four functions are strictly concave on x ≥ 0.
For ICEB Bi, the total amount of its MFR for blockchain operations can be calculated
by vNui. This amount is capped by a predefined ratio ρ of its membership fee paid to A.
That is, vNui ≤ ρξ(ui).
The objective of the federated egg banking alliance, A, is to maximize the benefits by
forming the alliance, i.e., the total customer satisfaction and member participation, while
offering MFRs for federated blockchain operations. Mathematically, it is formulated as the
following program:
maximize
{ui},v
αφ
( I
∑
i=1
ui
)
+ η(v) (5)
subject to:
vNui ≤ ρξ(ui), ∀i = 1, · · · , I, (6)
0 ≤ ui ≤ Oi, ∀i = 1, · · · , I, (7)
v > 0. (8)
For ICEB Bi, its motivation to join A and remain faithful to the alliance is to maximize
its profit after joining the alliance and the collective MFRs for its contributions to blockchain
operations, while satisfying its budget limit for membership expenditure. The following
program describes the mathematical model:
maximize
ui ,v
βψ(ui) + vNui (9)
subject to:
ξ(ui)− vNui ≤ Ci, (10)
0 ≤ ui ≤ Oi, ∀i = 1, · · · , I, (11)
v > 0. (12)
We adopted the Stackelberg game approach [52] to formulate the interactions between
the alliance A and the ICEBs {Bi, i = 1, · · · , I}. The interactions follow a leader–followers
decision making mechanism. At the leader level, the alliance A offers to the ICEBS an
MFR rate per block creation. At the follower level, the ICEBs determine their strategies to
maximize their profits according to the offered MFR rate. In the Stackelberg game model,
the alliance A is the leader that determines the MFR rate per block creation, v. Additionally,
each ICEB, Bi, is the follower that determines its optimal number of participating oocytes
for the coalition, ui, to respond to the given MFR rate per block creation. Mathematically,
the optimization problem is formulated as follows:
Leader(PA) :
maximize
v
Φ({ui}, v) ≡ αφ
( I
∑
i=1
ui
)
+ η(v)
subject to:
vNui ≤ ρξ(ui), ∀i = 1, · · · , I, (13)
v > 0. (14)
Followers(PB− i, i = 1, · · · , I) :
maximize
ui
Ψ(ui) ≡ βψ(ui) + vNui
Smart Cities 2022, 5 595
subject to:
ξ(ui)− vNui ≤ Ci, (15)
0 ≤ ui ≤ Oi. (16)
The above leader–followers problem forms a Stackelberg game whose objective is to
find the Stackelberg equilibrium point of the game. For {ui, i = 1, · · · , I} and v satisfying
Equations (13)–(16), the point ({u∗i }, v∗) is the Stackelberg equilibrium point if the following
two conditions are satisfied:
Φ({u∗i }, v∗) ≥ Φ({u∗i }, v), (17)
Ψ(u∗i ) ≥ Ψ(ui), ∀i = 1, · · · , I. (18)
4.2. Solution Methodology
4.2.1. Solution to the Leader Optimization Problem (PA)
As ∂2Φ(v)
∂v2 < 0, Φ(v) is strictly concave. The leader optimization problem (PA) is a
convex optimization problem. The optimal solution to (PA) must satisfy the Karush–Kuhn–
Tucker (KKT) conditions [60], the first-order necessary conditions for an optimal solution
to a convex optimization problem.
Define the Lagrangian function LA as:
LA({λi}) = −αφ
( I
∑
i=1
ui
)
− η(v) +
I
∑
i=1
λi[vNui − ρξ(ui)], (19)
where {λi|λi ≥ 0, i = 1, · · · , I} are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the conditions
in Equation (13).
The KKT conditions, in addition to the constraint Equation (14), are:
∂LA({λi})
∂v
= −b +
I
∑
i=1
λi Nui = 0, (20)
and: λi[vNui − ρξ(ui)] = 0, ∀i = 1, · · · , I. (21)
As b > 0, according to Equation (20), ∃uj > 0 and ∃λj =
b
Nuj
> 0. In Equation (21),
vNuj − ρξ(uj) = 0 or v =
ρξ(uj)
Nuj
> 0. For i = 1, · · · , I, if ui 6= uj, λi = 0. Hence,
Equations (20) and (21) of the KKT conditions and Equation (14) are satisfied. To satisfy
Equation (13), for i = 1, · · · , I, i 6= j, vNui ≤ ρξ(ui). Therefore,
v ≤ min
{
ρξ(ui)
Nui
, ∀ui > 0, i 6= j
}
. Combining with v =
ρξ(uj)
Nuj
, uj > 0, the following lemma
holds:
Lemma 1. For a given set of {ui|ui > 0, i = 1, · · · I}, v∗ = min
{
ρξ(ui)
Nui
, i = 1, · · · , I
}
is the
optimal solution to the leader optimization problem (PA).
Note that v ≤ min
{
ρξ(ui)
Nui
, ∀ui > 0
}
= min
{
ρξ(ui)
Nui
, ∀ui ≥ 1
}
≤ ρξ(1)
N = ρm ln(1+n)
N .
That is, this value of ρm ln(1+n)
N provides an upper bound to v. Consider the set of
{ui = Oi, ∀i = 1, · · · , I}. Since 0 < O1 ≤ O2 ≤ · · · ≤ OI and the function of ρξ(ui)
Nui
monotonically decreases, for Oi ≤ Oj,
ρξ(Oj)
NOj
≤ ρξ(Oi)
NOi
. From Lemma 1, v∗ = ρξ(OI)
NOI
is the
optimal solution to the leader optimization problem (PA). As the leader of the Stackelberg
game model, the alliance A, therefore, offers v∗ = ρξ(OI)
NOI
as the MFR rate per block creation
to the ICEBs.

4.2.2. Solution to the Follower Optimization Program (PB− i)
As ∂2Ψ(ui)
∂u2
i
< 0, Ψ(ui) is strictly concave, the follower optimization problem (PB− i)
is a convex optimization problem. The optimal solution to (PB − i) must satisfy the
KKT conditions.
Define the Lagrangian function LB(π) as:
LB(π) = −βψ(ui)− vNui + π[ξ(ui)− vNui − Ci], (22)
where π ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the condition in Equation (15).
The KKT conditions, in addition to the constraint Equation (16), are:
∂LB(π)
∂ui

(1 + e−rui )2 − vN + π

That is, Equation (15) is an active constraint for ui = − 1

Note that for WPBi

For ui > − 1

that Equation (23) of the KKT conditions is satisfied for ui > − 1

For 0 ≤ ui < − 1
n + m
vN and WPBi

Therefore, Equation (15) is an inactive constraint for 0 ≤ ui < − 1

vN is the optimal

Proof. Since u∗i satisfies Equations (15) and (16) and is a relative maximum point for the
problem (PB− i). As the objective function of (PB− i) is strictly concave, u∗i is also the
optimal solution to (PB− i).

(31)
That is, Equation (15) is an inactive constraint when 0 ≤ ui = Oi < − 1
n + m
vN .
Therefore, for Oi < − 1
n + m
vN , ui = Oi satisfies Eqsuations (15) and (16).
Since Ψ(ui) is monotonically increasing for 0 ≤ ui ≤ Oi, u∗i = Oi is the maximum
point, and thus the optimal solution to (PB− i).
Hence, Lemmas 3 and 4 provide the optimal solutions to the follower optimization
problem (PB− i) for 0 < − 1

4.2.3. Optimal Incentive Solution for Federated Egg Banking Blockchain Operations
Based on the optimal solutions from Lemmas 2–4, we developed an iterative scheme
to find the optimal incentive solution for the alliance of federated ICEBs. The iterative
scheme begins with an initial setting of v(0) ← ρξ(OI)
NOI
, where v(0) is the initial MFR rate per
block creation that the alliance A (the leader) offers to the ICEBs (the followers).
After receiving the offer, each ICEB (Bi) determines its optimal number of oocytes
to participate the alliance A. Its decision-making process first checks the feasibility of the
offered MFR rate. For v(k) in the kth iteration, if − v(k)N
mn e
(
− v(k)N
mn +
Ci
m
)
< − 1
e , there is no
solution in iteration k. The iterative process stops.
On the other hand, if the offered MFR rate is feasible, i.e., − v(k)N
mn e
(
− v(k)N
mn +
Ci
m
)
≥ − 1
e ,
the optimal number of oocytes is calculated as follows.
u(k+1)
i =
{
Oi, Oi < − 1
n + m
v(k)N
,
− 1
n + m
v(k)N
, otherwise.
(32)
The ICEB Bi then responds with its optimal number of oocytes, u(k+1)
i , to the alliance
A. After collecting the optimal numbers of oocytes, {u(k+1)
i }, from all the ICEBs, the alliance
A updates the MFR rate per block creation, v(k+1), and offers to each ICEB for the next
iteration, k + 1.
The iterative process ends when there is no further improvement on v. Pseudo-code
in Algorithm 1 describes the iterative scheme for optimal design to find the federated egg
banking incentive solution (FEBIS).
The FEBIS algorithm starts from iteration k = 0 with v(0) = min{ ρξ(Oi)
NOi
,
∀i = 1, · · · , I} = ρξ(OI)
NOI
. It updates v(k+1) in each iteration, k + 1, after all the values
of u(k)
i , ∀i = 1, · · · , I, are determined in the kth iteration.
Since ∂

]
< 0,− 1
n −

, Oi
}

{

n + m
v(k−1)N
, Oi
}
= u(k−1)
i .
Hence, u(k)
i is non-increasing in the iterative process. That is, u(k)
i < u(k−1)
i ≤ Oi or
u(k)
i = u(k−1)
i = Oi.
In iteration k, for u(k)
i = u(k−1)
i = Oi, ∀Oj ≤ Oi < − 1
n + m
v(k−1)N
. Hence, ∀Oj ≤
Oi, u(k)
j = Oj. That is, Equation (15) is active in (PB− j), ∀Oj ≤ Oi and u(k)
j = Oj.
For u(k)
i < u(k−1)
i ≤ Oi, Equation (15) becomes inactive in (PB − i) and the KKT
conditions of Equations (23) and (24) are not satisfied in (PB− i). That is, for u(k)
i < Oi, u(k)
i
is not an optimal solution to (PB− i).
In the first iteration k = 0, the algorithm uses the initial setting of v(0) ← ρξ(OI)
NOI
.
From Equation (32), for i = 1, · · · , I, u(0)
i = Oi and the corresponding constraint of
Equation (15) is active in (PB − i), ∀i = 1, · · · , I. In the next iteration k = 1, v(1) ←
Leader(u(0)) = min

}

{
ρξ(Oi)
NOi
}
= ρξ(OI)
NOI
= v(0). As v(1) = v0), there is no
further improvement in v, and the iterative process ends in iteration k = 1.
Note that as ∀i = 1, · · · , I, u(0)
i = Oi are the optimal solutions to (PB− i), i = 1, · · · , I,,
respectively, and v(1) = v(0) = ρξ(OI)
NOI
is the optimal solution to (PA), both the leader and
followers problems achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium point where both Equations (17)
and (18) are satisfied.
Based on the above analysis, the proposed FEBIS algorithm is correct and complete.
Its computational complexity is O(I2).

5. Numerical Results
5.1. A Numerical Example
This section presents a numerical example to demonstrate the optimal design for the
federated egg banking blockchain system. In it, there are five ICEBs, {B1,B2,B3,B4,B5},
intending to form an egg banking alliance in order to increase their economies of scope and
make their customers happier. Data of the five ICEBs and the parameters of coalition for
egg banking are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Algorithm 1 achieved the optimal
solution of v∗ = 0.00326137 after one iteration. The optimal numbers of participating
oocytes from the five ICEBs were u∗1 = 480, u∗2 = 1440, u∗3 = 1440, u∗4 = 2400, u∗5 = 2400,,
respectively. The result of (PA) was Φ({u∗i }, v∗) = 67.05704322 and the results of (PB−
i), i = 1, · · · , 5, were Ψ(u∗1) = 101.92745259, Ψ(u∗2) = 289.78235776, Ψ(u∗3) = 289.78235776,
Ψ(u∗4) = 477.63726293 and Ψ(u∗5) = 477.63726293. All these five ICEBs are to form the egg
banking alliance A, and each ICEB participates in the alliance A with the full number of
available oocytes included in the ICEB.

5.2. Adding a New ICEB
Following the numerical results in Section 5.1, consider a new ICEB B† that intends to
participate in the existing egg banking alliance A. There are two approaches (I and II) to
adding a new ICEB. Approach I resumes and uses the existing result of v∗ = 67.05704322
calculated in Section 5.1. Additionally, approach II re-executes the FEBIS algorithm to
achieve a new v∗. Table 3 describes the test data of the new ICEB to A, where three scenarios
(S1, S2, S3) are presented to test approach I and the other three (S4, S5, S6) approach II.
S1 and S4 represent the cases in which the new B† has the least number of oocytes to
participate among the incumbent ICEBs of A. S2 and S5 consider the cases in which B† has
neither the least nor the largest of number of oocytes to participate. Additionally, S3 and
S6 illustrate the cases in which the new ICEB B† has the most oocytes of any incumbent
ICEB in the alliance A.
Table 4 shows the test results of S1–S6. For approach II, S6 was the only scenario
whose new v∗ changed and decreased to 0.00175102. The results of v∗ from the other two
scenarios, S4 and S5, are the same as the first 0.00326137, calculated in Section 5.1. For both
approaches, the results of {u∗i } are all the same.
Tables 5–7 illustrate the performance analysis of S1 vs. S4, S2 vs. S5 and S3 vs. S6,
respectively. Note that, in Table 7, due to the decrease in v∗ from re-executing the FEBIS
algorithm, all the test results in S6 are less than those in S3. Additionally, note that the
differences in Ψ(u∗i ) between S6 vs. S3 enlarge as the resulting u∗i s increase. In Tables 5
and 6, as the new v∗s in S4 and S5 remain the same as the existing v, their results of Φ(v∗)
Smart Cities 2022, 5 601
and Ψ(u∗i ), ∀i = 1, · · · , I are almost all the same as their counterparts in scenarios S1 and
S2, respectively, except for the negligible increase in Φ(v∗) in S4.
In summary, the results in Tables 5–7 indicate that both approaches perform well in
adding a new ICEB with small- or medium-sized numbers of oocytes, among the incumbent
ICEBs. However, when a new, big ICEB with more oocytes than other incumbent ICEBs
intends to join alliance A, re-executing the FEBIS algorithm is better than using the existing
rate.

6. Blockchain-Based, Automated, Biomedical Implementation for Egg Saving
(BABIES) Platform
Based on the proposed federated blockchain approach, we continued on to develop a
Blockchain-based, Automated, Biomedical Implementation for Egg Saving (BABIES) plat-
form to seamlessly adopt blockchain technology in egg banking business. Figure 7 depicts
its system architecture. BABIES utilizes distributed ledgers and smart contracts which are
a collection of self-executing code and states, together with automatic identification and
data capture (AIDC) technology for the integration and automation of data exchange of
the eggs and their data. BABIES provides middleware for data exchange between BABIES
and various data sources from hospital information systems (HIS) of the federated ICEBs,
autoID (RFID or barcode) devices or automated instruments, IVF Laboratory Information
Management Systems (LIMS) and public health data repositories. Critical data are all
encrypted with symmetric encryption/decryption. Transaction data are structured into
distributed ledgers and stored in the local storage.
Figure 7. BABIES system architecture.
Smart Cities 2022, 5 603
Infertility treatments with ART involve complex clinical operations and laboratory
procedures. During an ART cycle, a large number of data can be gathered to reflect the
competence for clinical practice and laboratory work in ART. The complexity of the ART
process demands handling myriad data streams, monitoring a large number of parameters
and acquiring sufficient information to demonstrate, analyze and improve ART outcomes.
Monitoring ART performance is crucial for evaluating current activities and also for pre-
dicting further development. BABIES exploits massive, timed sensory data from IoT
and AIoT devices/instruments during the egg banking process. While there are no gold
standards to test the success of the birth of a healthy singleton child, recently, some perfor-
mance indicators (PIs) have been identified for evaluating critical healthcare domains of
patient safety, effectiveness, equity, patient-centeredness, timeliness and efficiency for ART
laboratory [21] and clinical practice [22]. Based on their recommendations, BABIES has
selected and designed a set of ART PIs for evaluation of the ART performance. The ART
PIs are made based on the consolidated data that were gathered from federated ICEB HIS,
AutoID and AIoT instruments, IVF LIMS and a public health data repository.
BABIES adopts many machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms to
support smart IVF services for embryo selection, embryo implantation, pregnancy rate
forecasting, personalized prediction, case service, egg bank logistics service, quality assur-
ance and operations optimization. Some encrypted data and the federated egg banking
blockchains are duplicated and stored in cloud storage, from which cloud data lakes are
generated and organized by cloud computing. Systems such as Patient Portal, application
programs, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Case Management, utilize such
data and the federated egg banking blockchain in the cloud data lakes to provide secure
and private information to platform users, such as intended parents, donors, surrogate
agents and so on.
BABIES also provides useful software packages to professional platform users, such
fertility specialists, embryologists and laboratory operators. These software packages
include a portal for ART services, extensive medical assessment, medical training and
rigorous donor screening functionalities.
Figure 8 depicts the software stack of the BABIES platform. At the bottom of the
software stack, data from the AIoT devices, ICT infrastructure and automated instruments
in the public and proprietary domains are collected and modeled by analytics and empirical
approaches. On top of that, distributed ledgers of the transactions of the data are stored
and managed with blockchain and cloud/edge computing technology. On top of that, ML
and DL algorithms, libraries and frameworks are used to provide smart IVF operations
and decisions. On top of that, user experience (UX) functionalities are provided for end-
user’s interaction with the egg banking services. The highest level of the software stack
encompasses all the BABIES egg banking services, including embryo selection, embryo
implantation, pregnancy rate forecast, personalized prediction, case service, egg bank
logistics service, quality assurance, operations optimization and so on.

7. Conclusions
We presented a novel federated approach that utilizes blockchain technology for
smarter egg banking of fertility preservation and assisted reproduction in smart cities. This
paper first identified the requirements and business opportunities that exploit hi-tech sys-
tems for smarter egg banking. We then proposed a federated egg banking business model
for fertility preservation and assisted reproduction in smart cities. The federated blockchain
approach intends to form coalition for integrated commercial egg banks (ICEBs) to create
more customer satisfaction and encourage more member participation. We designed a
membership-fee-rebate (MFR) mechanism to offer incentives to the ICEBs for blockchain
operations. We formulated the MFR problem into a leader–followers Stackelberg game
problem. At the leader (the alliance) level, the objective is to maximize the benefits of
forming the alliance; at in the follower (the ICEB) level, the objective of each ICEB is to
maximize the benefits of the ICEB. With a given set of parameters for the membership fee
functions and the average number of blocks generated for operations of an oocyte, the
optimal MFR is designed, based on the optimal numbers of participating oocytes of the
ICEBs. We developed an iterative algorithm, FEBIS, that uses mathematical programming
techniques to find the optimal incentive solution for the federated, integrated egg banking
alliance. A numerical example demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the devel-
oped methodology for the optimal design of the MFR mechanism. Numerical results also
indicated that the FEBIS algorithm performs well in adding a small- or medium-sized new
ICEB to the existing alliance with an existing MFR rate. On the other hand, to add a new
ICEB with a larger number participating oocytes, re-execution of the algorithm is better.
However, a lower MFR rate thus incurs after the joining of a new big one.
Following this research, we continued on to develop the Blockchain-based, Auto-
mated, Biomedical Implementation for Egg Saving (BABIES) platform to effectively adopt
blockchain technology for egg banking operations and services. The development of BA-
BIES is in progress. This paper outlines the components and functionalities in its system
architecture and software stacks. The detailed design of the BABIES platform will be
presented in the future. Furthermore, BABIES is implementing a set of the performance
indicators (PIs) which are identified in [21,22] for ART laboratory and clinical practice. The
performance evaluations of these PIs and the benchmarks will be presented in the future.
Unlike other smart cities projects that may receive government subsidies or money
from taxpayers to adopt new technologies, the formation of a coalition of ICEBs urges
sufficient incentives to motivate the ICEBS to participate and cooperate to improve citizen
Smart Cities 2022, 5 605
welfare in a smart city. This research initiates the design of a membership-fee–rebate mech-
anism and adopts four functions, Equations (1)–(4), as the objective functions for modeling
the optimal incentive problem. Future research directions include the development of
more creative incentive mechanisms for the coalition of ICEBs; the customization of more
comprehensive objective functions in incentive problem formulation; and the use of more
advanced data and system modeling technologies to integrate the sophisticated fertility
preservation and assisted reproduction operations and provide more services and citizen
welfare in smart cities applications.
