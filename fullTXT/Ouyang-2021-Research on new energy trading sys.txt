ABSTRACT
With the rapid development of new energy industry, the new energy
structure is gradually shifting from centralized system to distributed
system. The problems of trust and fair trade have become increas-
ingly prominent in traditional centralized energy trading systems.
The decentralized blockchain technology can provide a trusted, safe
and transparent technical solution for energy transactions. This
paper proposes a blockchain-based new energy trading platform in
multi-seller-multi-buyer distributed new energy power platform. It
establishes multi-party trust relationship through blockchain tech-
nology and optimizes transaction strategy by multi-party game al-
gorithm to improves multi-party revenue. Simulation results prove
that the proposed solution can reduce energy consumption and
optimize energy structure, which provides a reference for theory
and technology of new energy trading platform.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the vigorous development of new energy sources, green en-
ergy technologies such as solar and wind power have ushered in
a technological boom and are being used in a wide range of ap-
plications. For example, the use of photovoltaic industry in the
community: the community or households use photovoltaic panels
to generate electricity, and as producers of electricity, they can
exchange their excess electricity with other groups to maximize
energy use, thus changing the market from consumer-oriented to
producer-consumer-oriented [1-[2] [3] 4]. This kind of large-scale,

multi-user distributed capacity approach has launched a huge chal-
lenge to the traditional power management [5], various high-tech
such as big data, Internet of Things, AI technology and blockchain
technology have been fully penetrated into all aspects of the energy
system, using various high-tech solutions to grid architecture and
energy trading is the fundamental way to promote the development
of electricity [6, 7].
Blockchain technology provides a secure platform for storing
transaction records between distributed peer-to-peer networks,
and it ensures that the data on the chain is authentic, traceable
and tamper-proof. In recent years, blockchain technology has been
widely used in the financial sector and has produced good effects.
Meanwhile, the application of blockchain in energy trading has
also been extensively researched, and the literature [8] provides an
in-depth analysis of the application value of blockchain in energy
trading. Literature [9] used blockchain technology to optimize the
existing electricity spot market transactions.
On the other hand, how to maximize the benefits to multiple
parties and save energy in a distributed generation-consumption
framework is another focus of research. The literature [10] uses
the transaction price as an entry point to build the microgrid into
an ordinal potential game model maximizing the revenue through
optimization and improving the energy utilization. However, in
the game process, literature [10] considers only the power sales
strategy to maximize the revenue while it may lead to high cost
of power purchase, in addition to the sale price to the main grid is
constant in a certain time and should not be used as a game element.
Therefore, in this paper, the number of new energy power transac-
tions within the community grid and between the community grid
and the main grid is used as the game point instead of the selling
price when conducting the game. This way the maximum benefit
is obtained without increasing the cost of electricity purchase for
the households.
In this paper, we combine the application value of blockchain
technology in new energy trading and establish a new energy trad-
ing model based on blockchain and game theory. In the scenario of
new energy power network, the model is used to conduct a multi-
party non-cooperative game with the main purpose of promoting
regional power balance, increasing community grid transactions
and reducing transactions with the main network, defining a set
of reward mechanisms, and finally finding the optimal strategy to
reach the Nash equilibrium point, and guaranteeing the strategy
execution with smart contracts. Finally, the effectiveness of the
blockchain-based new energy trading model proposed in this paper
is demonstrated by simulation.

2 BLOCKCHAIN-BASED NEW ENERGY
TRADING MODE
2.1 Blockchain
Blockchain [11] technology is an open, transparent and decentral-
ized database. Transparency is reflected in the fact that the database
is shared by all network nodes, updated by the database operator,
and supervised by all nodes; decentralization is reflected in the fact
that the database can be regarded as a huge interactive database,
which can be accessed and updated by all participants, and the data
in it can be confirmed to be true and reliable. Blockchain is a data
structure formed by blocks linked together in an orderly manner,
where blocks are collections of data, and relevant information and
records are included in them, which are the basic units forming
the blockchain. The blockchain network is a P2P network with no
centralized hardware or governing body for the entire network. In
the blockchain system, each node keeps all the data information in
the whole blockchain, therefore, there are multiple backups of data
in the whole network. The more nodes involved in the network,
the more backups of data there are.
Figure 1 represents the architecture of the blockchain. The data
layer is the physical form of the blockchain technology and de-
scribes the data structure of the blockchain. The data layer stores
all the transaction data and information records in the form of
blockchain in full volume. The network layer is mainly to realize
information exchange between nodes in the blockchain network
and decentralization of bookkeeping nodes. The network layer is
typically a P2P network with communication and verification mech-
anisms. The consensus layer is responsible for orchestrating the
task load of bookkeeping nodes and enables highly decentralized
nodes to reach consensus on the validity of block data efficiently
in a decentralized system. Commonly used consensus mechanisms
include PoW and PoS. The incentive layer proposes issuance mecha-
nisms and incentives, such as in the PoW consensus protocol, which
Figure 2: Blockchain-based new energy trading platform
rewards miners who calculate the hash value first. The contract
layer and the application layer work together to complete the ap-
plication function. Smart contracts [12] are programs that run on
the blockchain and have the characteristics of being tamper-proof
and automatically executed. Developers write smart contracts to
form distributed applications (Dapp) [13] based on business require-
ments, thus fulfilling various functional requirements.
2.2 Trading model
New energy sources include light and wind energy, etc. This paper
examines new energy tradingmodels using light energy and devices
that can harness it as the main entry point. Within a community
grid, households may have installed photovoltaic power generation
equipment that can produce electricity. The households consume
electricity by using the electricity-using equipment. Excess electric-
ity or lack of electricity can be traded among each other through
the community grid, and also with the main grid, which is mainly
an electricity network consisting of thermal power generation. If
users can trade new energy power with each other and as little as
possible with the main grid, this will make full use of new energy
power. However, unlike the main thermal network, PV power is a
distributed power structure and the power status cannot be guaran-
teed. In addition, the self-interest of households makes it difficult to
establish trust and ensure that new energy transactions are carried
out. If centralized transactions are used, there are security issues
such as privacy leakage. Therefore, blockchain technology needs to
be used to establish a trust channel for households without a third
party to guarantee smooth transactions [14].
In view of the distributed nature of PV power generation and
the trust problem among users, this paper proposes a new energy
trading platform based on blockchain as shown in Figure 2. At the
physical level both households and occupants can interact with
160

Figure 3: Blockchain-based energy trading model
electricity through the community grid, while the community grid
has to be connected to the main grid. The households installing
PV are both producers and consumers called producers and con-
sumers. The blockchain interacts with the community grid to trade
electricity. When the households generate electricity consumption
information, it is broadcasted across the blockchain, recorded on
the blockchain, and then traded in the physical grid for electricity
[4]. The security of the data is ensured because the blockchain
data is tamper-proof and each node has a backup of the data. And
based on the consensus protocol to ensure that the information on
the blockchain is authentic and valid, a transaction channel can
be established for trustless users. The occupants do not need to
know the specific information of the transaction object when they
conduct electricity transactions through the blockchain platform,
which guarantees privacy, and in addition, because the transaction
data is always kept on the blockchain, it has traceability for the
regulators.
Compared with the centralized system, the distributed deploy-
ment based on blockchain can make the community, community
and other units as the nodes of the blockchain, which can perceive
the change of electricity faster and trade electricity through the
open mechanism, so that the new energy electricity can be used
more rationally and consume less computing resources than the
centralization. In the blockchain-based new energy trading system,
a distributed architecture is used to actively maintain the stable
state of the blockchain through consensus protocols, and the more
nodes there are, the higher the failure resistance of the whole sys-
tem, which is the opposite of the centralized system, which is often
prone to single point of failure [6]. For the centralized power trading
system, once the center fails, all the power dispatching and trading
in the whole region will fail, while the blockchain system as a decen-
tralized deployment can guarantee the operation of power trading
and dispatching with high reliability even if some blockchain nodes
fail, which is especially important in the power trading system.
The energy trading model proposed in this paper is shown in
Figure 3. The blockchain ensures that the data is tamper-proof,
and smart contracts are used to guarantee smooth transactions be-
tween individual households. Smart contracts are tamper-evident
programs built on the blockchain that can be executed automati-
cally and need to be executed on the blockchain nodes [15]. Each
user can send a transaction to the blockchain’s and the system
automatically executes the smart contract. All occupant users it-
eratively calculate the optimal strategy based on the game model,
and to guarantee that the strategy can be executed, the optimal
strategy is formed into a smart contract and broadcasted across
the network. Each blockchain node executes the smart contract
and performs the power dispatching of the community grid. The
process of creating smart contracts and executing smart contracts
are packaged as transaction data and stored as new blocks on the
blockchain according to the consensus protocol [16].
The variation in the power of the PV-produced electricity for
each household is small and the curves do not vary much. However,
the consumption of power by households is complex and varies
greatly, and the respective load curves differ greatly. When the peak
load is reached, the community grid is heavily loaded and needs to
trade power with the main network, which does not maximize the
use of PV power and causes waste of resources.
To address this situation, this paper proposes a non-cooperative
game model to encourage households to trade within the com-
munity grid. It allows households to trade reasonably without a
coordinated plan to maximize the use of PV energy and promote
the power balance of the community grid. The game model pro-
vides support for the entire trading system, so that trading is no
longer unstructured, but that both the overall and the individual
are moving toward a good trend.
In practice, the trading period is first divided into half-hour
intervals. In this interval, all the households get the optimal strategy
through gaming, and create smart contracts on the blockchain
according to the optimal strategy and broadcast them across the
network. Then each household acts as a blockchain node to execute
the smart contract automatically to ensure the smooth execution
of the strategy. The transaction data is recorded on the blockchain
using the PoW consensus mechanism. Then the next transaction
block is carried out and the cycle repeats.
3 GAME MODEL
In a blockchain-based transaction system, the transaction data is
visible to users because it is stored on the blockchain. Each user
can be informed about the payments of other users. Users can be
considered to have complete information. However, in a transaction
period, the user cannot get access to the actions of other users,
cannot be informed whether other users are inputting or acquiring
power to the community grid, and cannot be informed about the
actions of other participants as a static game. In such a case, the
blockchain-based community grid system can be considered as a
static game with complete information [17].
Households can produce power through PV or consume
it, and are players in the game theory model. Define N =
{1, 2, 3, . . . , i, . . . , n}, where n denotes the number of participants
and i denotes the i-th participant. The set of strategies for par-
ticipant i is S = {Si1, S
i
2, . . . , S
i
mi }, and mi denotes the num-
ber of strategies that can be adopted by the i-th participant.
161
ACM TURC, July 30–August 01, 2021, Hefei, China LongYing Ouyang et al.
There are n participants in this game model, and if each par-
ticipant chooses a strategy, it will form an n-dimensional vec-
tor named s, s = {s1, s2 , s3, . . . , sn}. For all participants, partic-
ipant i can choose any strategy from among them. Therefore,
s ∥ ti = {s1, s2 , . . . , si−1, ti, si+1, . . . , sn} is introduced to indicate
that participant i chooses strategy ti and others’ strategies are not
specified, where ti ∈ Si. There are five main strategies for partici-
pants as follows. i participant sells electricity to other participants
in the community grid; ii participant buys electricity from other
participants in the community grid; iii participant neither buys nor
sells electricity; iv participant buys electricity from the main grid
through the community grid; and v participant sells electricity from
the main grid through the community grid.
Each participant, i.e., household, has its own payoff function [18],
which represents the reward received when the participant chooses
a strategy, which will motivate the participant to adopt certain
strategies to maximize their gains. Thus the payment function is
the key to this game system. The payoff function of participant i
is represented by µi(s), and s denotes the set of strategies when
participant igains. That is, when all participants choose a set of
strategies s, the payoff obtained by participant i is µi(s). The formula
is shown below.
µi (s) =
{
λEin(s)
|Emain(s) |Ci(s),Emain (s) , 0
ωλEin(s),Emain (s) = 0
s.t. λ > 1 (1)
Emain(s) denotes the electricity traded by participant i with the
main grid through the community grid under policy set s. ω is a
constant taken as the reciprocal of the minimum accuracy of the
meter count, which ensures that the payment function µi(s) yields
the maximum benefit when Emain(s) equals 0. Ein(s) denotes the
electricity traded by participant i under policy set s, and with other
participants through community grid to interact with the electric-
ity energy. Ein(s) takes a positive value if energy is sold to other
participants through the community grid, and a negative value if
energy is obtained from other participants. λ is related to the actual
grid situation, and λEin(s) is a monotonically increasing function
and is always greater than 0. This ensures that participants who
sell electricity have higher returns than those who buy electricity.
This ensures that participants who sell power have higher returns
than those who buy power, and that those who buy less power have
higher returns than those who buy more power from the grid. In
order to avoid the situation where the participant obtains a greater
gain in order to obtain a gain while affecting his or her standard of
living. For example, in very high temperatures, participants do not
use air conditioning in order to sell electricity, etc. The system is
designed for better dispatch of power resources rather than degrad-
ing the living experience of residents. Based on this situation, the
concept of comfort Ci(s) is introduced to ensure that the residents
can satisfy the comfort level while gaining revenue.
The comfort formula is shown in equation (2). Tmax is the maxi-
mum temperature that humans find appropriate, and t_min is the
minimum temperature that can be tolerated by users. This varies
from person to person, so the range of this definition has to be com-
bined with statistics and has to be relaxed a bit. If the participant’s
strategy during the trading session makes the temperature inside
the household greater than the maximum temperature or lower
than the minimum temperature, causing great discomfort to the
human body. In this case Ci(s) = 0 and the participant does not
receive any benefit. If the strategy used by the participant makes the
temperature inside the household between Tmin and Tmax, which is
comfortable, thenCi(s) = −a(T − Tmin)(T − Tmax). And the closer
the indoor temperature is to the upper bound or the lower bound of
comfort, the smaller Ci(s) is. When participant i chooses a strategy
that results in the occupant’s temperature being greater than the
maximum temperature or less than the minimum temperature, par-
ticipant i’s payment function µi(s) will be equal to 0 and no benefit
will be gained. The scenario of comfort eliminates participants who
gain higher benefits by reducing the quality of life.
Ci (s) =

0,T ≤ Tmin
−a (T − Tmin)
0,T ≥ Tmax
(T − Tmax) ,Tmin < T < Tmax
s.t. − a (T − Tmin) (T − Tmax) ≤ 1 (2)
In equation (1), participants who want to gain more revenue in the
case of guaranteed comfort can be divided into three directions.
One is the need to increase the volume of transactions within
the community grid to make the value of λEin(s) larger. λEin(s) is in
the denominator, and the larger λEin(s) is, the larger the gain µi(s)
of participant i under the set s of strategies. Therefore, participants
are encouraged to trade with other participants in the community
grid, which will lead to higher gains for participants.
The second is to reduce the transaction with the main grid,
Emain(s) in the denominator, the smaller Emain(s), the larger the
result of µi(s), the greater the gain for the participants. If the par-
ticipants do not trade with each other within the community grid
but trade electricity with the main network Emain(s) will become
larger, and at this time the participants’ gain µi(s) will be smaller.
Third, to reduce its own power consumption, the smaller the
value of λEin(s) of the participant with more power consumption,
the smaller the gain µi(s) when trading with other participants in
the community grid. The gain µi(s) is meaningful only if it satisfies
the comfort level of the participants. If the chosen strategy does
not satisfy the participant’s comfort level, the participant will not
receive any gain.
Driven by the goal of maximum gain, all participants after the
game will try to trade with other participants in the community
grid as much as possible, reduce trading with the main grid, and at
the same time reduce their own energy consumption as much as
possible without affecting their comfort, so that they can promote
the local new energy balance.
In the game model, it is assumed that all participants will not
cooperate with each other to achieve higher returns, forming a
non-cooperative game with n (n is the total number of participants)
people. According to the game theory the following equation is
obtained [19].

, i ∈ N (3)
The strategy s∗ = {s∗1, s

then for any participant i,for any strategy ti ∈ Si, there is a combi-
nation of strategies s∗ such that each participant approaches the
maximum payoff, i.e., such that the payoff function of each partici-
pant converges to the maximum.

4 SIMULATION EXPERIMENT
In a community grid consisting of four households that install PV
generation equipment. Households can trade electricity between
them and the community grid, and households can also trade elec-
tricity between them and the main grid through the community
grid. After a period of statistical observation and combined with
the actual situation, ω = 100, λ = 4, Tmin = 15°C, Tmax = 27°C,
and a = 1/36 in Equation (1) and Equation (2). participants select
strategies in a half-hour interval, and the strategies selected by
each participant when Nash equilibrium is reached are calculated
in this time interval, and blockchain smart contracts are used to
guarantee strategy execution. Photovoltaic power generation only
plays a role from 7:00 to 19:00, so the simulation experiment is set
in the interval of 7:00 to 19:00 during the daytime [11].
The electricity generation of the households is shown in Table
1. Figure 4 shows the generation curves of the households. All
households have similar generation curves. The power generation
tends to increase gradually from 7:00 onwards to a maximum at
noon, and then the power generation decreases.
The energy consumed by the households is shown in Figure
5. The consumption curve of grid power varies from household
to household and is not evenly distributed. And the maximum
consumption of each household also varies, resulting in uneven
load on the community grid, and households need to purchase
power from the main grid at peak times to avoid oversupply of the
community grid. And most of the participants are self-interested
and will buy power far beyond their own maximum losses, which
will further increase the peak grid load and make greater power
transactions with the main grid.
In the case of household 1, for example, the energy consumption
is significantly lower after the power trading after gaming. As
shown in Figure 6, the peak consumption of the household is 7
kW·h, and the peak consumption after gaming through the new
energy trading system is 6 kW·h reducing the consumption by 14%.
Table 1 lists the electricity consumption of household 1. It is clear
that after gaming, the peak consumption is advanced and reduced.
The households’ electricity consumption strategies are gamed to
reach the Nash equilibrium point to obtain a near-optimal strategy,
which is created as a smart contract and guaranteed to be executed
by the smart contract. Each household is rewarded with a near-
maximum value [20]. Reducing electricity consumption increases
the reward without affecting comfort, so the final blockchain-based

Figure 7: Grid load
Figure 7 represents the grid load, and a positive power level
indicates that the power generated by PV in the community is
being consumed, and a negative power level indicates that the
households in the community are trading power with the main grid.
From Figure 4, it can be seen that the peak is reduced by 10% after
adopting blockchain-based energy trading, which has a significant
peak shaving effect. Before the game from 10:00 to 15:00 the house-
holds traded a lot of electricity with the main grid through the
community grid. After the new energy trading system, the trading
between households and the main grid is greatly reduced, which
contributes to the regional balance. Although the individual house-
holds reduce their energy consumption, the total PV generation is
slightly less than the total consumption. Therefore, transactions
with the main grid are inevitable. If the energy consumption of
households is further reduced, the comfort level will be reduced,
and although it can further promote the balance of supply and
demand of the new energy grid but at the expense of the happiness
index of the residents.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we construct a blockchain-basedmodel for new energy
trading, with the main participants being a community grid com-
posed of households. The blockchain ensures the security of data,
guarantees the execution of strategies, and is the basis for house-
holds in the community to trade electricity with each other. The
rules of new energy trading are developed by combining blockchain
and practical situations through game theory. Simulation results
show that blockchain-based new energy trading will reduce re-
source consumption, lower transactions with the main grid, cut
peaks, and promote the power balance of the community grid. It
provides a reference for further exploration of new energy trad-
ing model based on blockchain. Subsequent research will build on
the current foundation and propose a new energy trading model
among complex power networks that include more participants
and multiple community grids.
