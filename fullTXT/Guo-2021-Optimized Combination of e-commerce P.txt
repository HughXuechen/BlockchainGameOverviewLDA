ABSTRACT In the e-commerce market, many e-commerce platforms act as resellers when selling products,
and act as agents when selling other products. In the sales process, e-commerce platforms can either build
their own blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability platforms or cooperate with third-party blockchain anti-
counterfeit traceability platforms. This will generate four scenarios: 1) reseller, building its own platform
(RE); 2) reseller, cooperating with a third-party platform (RO); 3) agent, building its own platform (ME);
4) agent, cooperating with a third-party platform (MO). Therefore, this paper constructs a differential game
model under four modes to explore the interaction between the choice of sales mode and the choice of
anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy. The results show that suppliers’ profits are influenced by various
aspects. On the one hand, in small-scale markets, the situation in which suppliers can realize higher profits
evolves from ME to RO as the wholesale price increases, and in large-scale markets, suppliers are more
profitable in the ME mode. On the other hand, with the increase of market scale and the decrease of unit
price of anti-counterfeit traceability service of third-party platform, the situation that suppliers can achieve
higher profit evolves from RE to RO and then to RE. For e-commerce platform, self-built platform is a better
choice. In the small-scale market, as the market size increases, the cost performance of anti-counterfeit
traceability service decreases, and the best choice for e-commerce platform evolves from resale to agency
sales, and in the large-scale market, the best choice for e-commerce platform is resale.

I. INTRODUCTION
Along with the accelerated pace of consumer upgrading,
the e-commerce market is expanding rapidly at an alarm-
ing rate [1]–[4]. The 2021 Global Payments Report, pub-
lished by Worldpay, shows that China has become the largest
e-commerce market in the world, with the e-commerce
market expected to be worth $3.17 trillion by 2024.
In previous e-commerce markets, e-commerce platforms
operated primarily as resellers, reselling products purchased
from upstream suppliers (e.g., Amazon resells music under
iTunes), and in this model, the e-commerce platform owns
the product [2], [3]. With the development of the e-commerce
market, some retail giants such as Amazon and Walmart
have broken with traditional sales methods and turned to
agency sales (e.g., AmazonMarketplace, iBook Store), where

e-commerce platforms act as agents, allowing suppliers to
make decisions on key factors such as retail prices and sell
products directly to consumers, but with a percentage fee
paid to the e-commerce platform [5]–[8]. Due to more open
and transparent retail prices, many e-commerce platforms are
keen to adopt the agency sales format (e.g. Chinese smart-
phonemanufacturer Xiaomi, well-known brand Sephora sells
its products through Jingdong Mall, etc.) Despite the grow-
ing momentum of agency sales, some industries still use
the resale sales model [9], [10]. The second annual ‘‘SME
Impact Report’’ released byAmazon 2021 shows that revenue
from reselling products amounted to $114.8 billion and total
sales from agency selling exceeded $160 billion. As a result,
the issue of choosing a sales model for e-commerce platforms
has become a hot topic in recent years [2], [10]–[13].
In recent years, a wide range of products on the mall,
the enterprise brand marketing efforts to increase the entire
e-commerce field has brought a huge impact, some industry

pain points have also emerged. Fierce competition among
brands, the market is flooded with counterfeit goods, coun-
terfeiting, and the sale of counterfeit problems are repeatedly
prohibited [1], [14]–[17]. In Asia, counterfeit medicines are
up to 60%, the fashion luxury industry is no exception [18].
According to the Harvard Business Review [19], the total
trade in counterfeit goods is estimated to be as high as
$4.5 trillion in 2019, with counterfeit luxury goods total-
ing more than $270 million and 40% of luxury counterfeit
sales taking place online. How to solve these pain points
becomes a difficult issue for companies, on the one hand,
suppliers need to take action and be responsible for the quality
improvement of their products (product innovation), con-
tinuous improvement of quality can positively contribute to
goodwill [20]. On the other hand, e-commerce platforms use
their own advantages, based on a large number of consumer
transactions and behavior data, based on data-driven analy-
sis of marketing activities, consumer demographic insights,
advertising precision targeting and other data marketing ser-
vices across the chain, that is, data-driven marketing (DDM),
can also stimulate demand [21], [22]. In addition, coun-
terfeit products seriously harm the interests of brands and
consumers [23]–[25], damage the reputation of the entire
consumer market, and are not conducive to the sustainable
development of the market, product anti-counterfeiting has
been pushed to the forefront of the times [14], [26], and
the blockchain anti-counterfeiting traceability system was
born [1], [27]. The product anti-counterfeiting traceability
based on blockchain technology can realize the full trace-
ability of products through the combination of its unique
distributed ledger record characteristics and technologies
such as Internet of Things [28], [29], including the infor-
mation collection records of product sources, raw material
source traceability, production and processing links, logis-
tics information, anti-counterfeiting authentication, etc., real-
izing one code for one thing [15]. On the other hand,
the chain of anti-counterfeit codes plays a supervisory role
in tracing and discovering the illegal circulation and use of
anti-counterfeit codes, and meets the actual demand of con-
sumers for commodity traceability, which not only enhances
the trust of the brand, but also improves the image of
the brand, and the rights and interests of both enterprises
and consumers can be protected, causing the resonance
between enterprises and consumers [1], [30]. According to
the 2020 Blockchain Traceability Service Innovation and
Application Report, the sales of nutrition and health care
and maternal and infant milk powder products have rela-
tively increased by 29.4% and 10.0%, respectively, and the
sales of other products have also increased after brands have
launched blockchain anti-counterfeiting traceability services.
Therefore, anti-counterfeit traceability service, as one of the
most expensive operations of e-commerce platforms, is a key
factor in promoting consumer demand and improving brand
goodwill. In order to fully guarantee the quality of goods
and enhance user experience, some platforms take advantage
of their own blockchain technology to build ‘‘Blockchain
Anti-counterfeit Traceability Platform’’ (BATP), such as
Jingdong Zhizhen Chain, while some platforms provide
anti-counterfeit traceability services for consumers by coop-
erating with third-party blockchain anti-counterfeit traceabil-
ity platforms, such as the strategic cooperation between the
famous brand ‘‘Baby Lattice’’ and the CQC code on the world
anti-counterfeiting traceability platform.
It is well known that different servicemodels (self-built and
outsourced) have their own advantages and disadvantages,
and can have different impacts on the company itself and
on consumers due to different service efficiencies and costs.
Some studies have also indicated that platforms implement
different sales models for products with different service
efficiencies/costs [10]. Therefore, in practice, the interaction
of sales model selection and anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vice strategy results in four scenarios: (a) the e-commerce
platform acts as a reseller and builds its own BATP to provide
anti-counterfeit traceability service, namely, the RE scenario;
(b) the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller and cooper-
ates with a third-party BATP, which provides anti-counterfeit
traceability service, namely, the RO scenario; (c) the platform
acts as an agent and builds its own BATP to provide anti-
counterfeit traceability service, namely, the ME scenario;
and (d) the platform acts as an agent and cooperates with a
third-party BATP,which provides anti-counterfeit traceability
service, namely, the MO scenario.
On this basis, this paper aims to explore how the sales
model selection of e-commerce platforms interacts with
anti-counterfeit traceability service strategies. Specifically,
we address the following questions.
(1) Under different models, how should suppliers,
e-commerce platforms and third-party BATPs develop opti-
mal strategies? What factors will be influenced by?
(2) Which scenario yields the highest retail price or the
highest level of anti-counterfeit traceability service?
(3) What is the profitability of companies under different
models? What factors will be affected?
(4) If we consider the interaction between the sales model
of the e-commerce platform and the anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service strategy, which case is optimal?
By solving problem (1) and analyzing four different mod-
els (i.e., RE/RO/ME/MO), we are able to obtain each opti-
mal strategy for suppliers and e-commerce platforms under
different scenarios and determine the optimal combination
of sales model and blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability
service strategy under different conditions.
By solving problem (2), we analyze which situation pro-
duces the highest retail price or the highest level of anti-
counterfeit traceability service. The problem is considered
not only from the perspective of the e-commerce platform, but
also from the perspective of the consumer (because the higher
the level of anti-counterfeit traceability service, the more it
can protect the interests of the consumer).
By solving problem (3), we study in which case the
e-commerce platform generates higher profits. It provides
a reference for the managers of e-commerce platform

companies in the selection of sales model and blockchain
anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy.
Regarding question (4), we are interested in the optimal
combination between e-commerce platform sales model and
anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy, which has not
been portrayed by mathematical theoretical models in pre-
vious literature. We investigate the key role played by the
cost effectiveness of anti-counterfeit traceability services and
further analyze how the different costs of anti-counterfeit
traceability services on e-commerce platforms and third-
party BATP anti-counterfeit traceability services affect the
results in a more realistic way.
To solve the above problems, this paper considers a distri-
bution channel consisting of an upstream supplier supplying
products, a downstream e-commerce platform coordinating
sales and anti-counterfeit traceability services, and contin-
uous consumers. Then, we constructed differential game
models under four modes of RE/RO/ME/MO, described the
product innovation degree and brand goodwill with state
equations, and examined how the sales mode choice of
e-commerce platforms interacted with the anti-counterfeit
traceability service strategy. The innovations of this paper
are: (1) from a dynamic perspective, the evolution of product
innovation degree and brand goodwill is portrayed under
the addition of technology investment by suppliers and
blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy pro-
vided by e-commerce platforms. (2) The differential game
model is constructed by considering the choice of sales model
of e-commerce platform and the choice of blockchain anti-
counterfeiting and traceability service strategy. This problem
has not been portrayed by mathematical theoretical models
in previous literature. Some important findings are mainly
presented below.
First, we solve for the degree of product innovation, brand
goodwill, each optimal strategy and corporate profit under
the four models, and conduct sensitivity analysis on the key
parameters, and find that each strategy of the company is
affected by different factors under different models. Under
the RE model, the market size plays a positive influence
on the supplier’s technology investment level, but whether
the market size and wholesale price have a positive stu-
dio or negative influence on the anti-counterfeit traceabil-
ity service strategy and DDM strategy of the e-commerce
platform depends on their interactions. Under the RO
model, the impact of market size on the DDM strategy of
e-commerce platforms, the impact of wholesale price on
the level of technology investment and DDM strategy, and
the impact of the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability
services charged by third-party BATPs on the strategy of
anti-counterfeit traceability services all depend on the pricing
criteria of the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vices of third-party BATPs. Under the ME model, the market
size has a positive effect on the channel, and the commis-
sion rate will weaken the incentive of suppliers to invest in
technology, but will enhance the anti-counterfeit traceability
service strategy and DDM strategy of e-commerce platforms.
Under the MO model, the impact of market size on the DDM
strategy of e-commerce platforms depends on the unit price
of anti-counterfeit traceability services charged by third-party
BATPs.
Second, we compared the retail prices of the products
under the four models. The analysis shows that the ROmodel
yields higher retail prices on a resale basis, and the same
retail prices under the ME and MO models on an agency
sales basis. Further, under the four models, the ROmodel will
yield the highest retail price, the theoretical basis of which
depends on the double marginalization effect. In addition,
by comparing the anti-counterfeit traceability service strate-
gies under the four models, it is found that the results depend
on the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services of the
third-party BATP.
Third, suppliers’ profits will be affected by several factors,
on the one hand, the interaction of market size and wholesale
prices. In small or medium-sized markets, the scenario in
which suppliers can realize higher profits will change from
ME to RO as wholesale prices increase. In large scale mar-
kets, the MEmodel will achieve higher margins. On the other
hand, the interaction of market size and the unit price of anti-
counterfeit traceability services of third-party BATPs, as the
market size increases and the unit price of services decreases,
the situation in which suppliers can achieve higher profits
changes from RE to RO and then to RE.
Finally, by considering the strategic interaction of sales
model and strategy choice of e-commerce platforms, we find
that self-built BATP is a better choice for e-commerce plat-
forms. The result of the choice of sales model depends on the
interaction betweenmarket size and cost effectiveness of anti-
counterfeit traceability services. As the market size increases
and the cost effectiveness of anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vices decreases, the best choice for e-commerce platforms
shifts from resale to agency sales, when the market size is at
the medium level and above, the best choice for e-commerce
platforms is resale.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
briefly reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 pro-
vides the problem description and related assumptions.
Section 4 develops differential game models for the four
models and performs the solution and sensitivity analysis.
Section 5 presents a comparative analysis. Section 6 pro-
vides numerical examples. Finally, conclusions are drawn in
Section 7.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section, we review the relevant literature from the fol-
lowing three streams: (1) sales model selection (2) blockchain
anti-counterfeit traceability (3) platform strategy selection
(self-built or cooperation with third-party platforms).
A. SALES MODEL SELECTION
Sales model selection has been a popular research topic
in recent years, and much of the existing literature has
focused on the trade-offs between resale and agency models
138084 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
for supply chain members under different conditions [2],
[5]–[7], [12], [31], and many scholars have also revealed the
key drivers that influence sales model selection [32]–[35].
Abhishe et al. [9] studied the impact of online on brick-
and-mortar demand spillover effects, among others, on the
choice of platform sales model and found that the preference
of platforms for resale or agency sales depends on whether
electronic channel sales have a positive or negative impact
on the demand for traditional channels. Wei et al. [4] inves-
tigated the effect of information sharing on suppliers’ sales
model choice in a supply chain consisting of one supplier and
one e-tailer and found that for a given information sharing
strategy, suppliers used resale and agency sales models when
production costs were relatively low and resale only when
production costs were relatively large. Liu et al. [22] studied
the impact of market size and data-driven marketing on plat-
form sales model choice and found that as data-driven mar-
keting becomes more efficient, platforms are more willing to
adopt resale models. Some scholars, however, have consid-
ered the choice of sales model under the influence of market
competition. Tian et al. [36] examined the impact of channel
operating costs and the degree of competition from upstream
suppliers on e-commerce sales models. Liu et al. [13] study
the sales model choice of a monopoly manufacturer facing
two competing downstream platform firms and find that for
a given level of order fulfillment costs, the manufacturer’s
choice evolves from selling as an agent for both platforms,
to a hybrid model, and then to reselling for both platforms due
to the increase in order fulfillment costs. Chen et al. [8] stud-
ied how platforms should use both resale and agency sales
business models in promotions in the presence of competition
and found that a hybrid sales model (one resale, one agency
sales model) yields Pareto improvements. However, in prac-
tice, the interaction between the choice of platform sales
model and the operational decisions of supply chain members
is an inevitable issue to be considered [11]. Geng et al. [37]
examined the interaction between upstream firms’ pricing
strategies for add-on products and downstream online plat-
form sales model choices and found that firms tend to bundle
add-on and core products together in the resale model and
retail add-on products separately in the marketplace model.
Zhang and Zhang [3] examine the interaction between sales
model choices and information sharing strategies between
e-retailers and suppliers who establish brick-and-mortar
stores. Wei et al. [38] constructed a model of competi-
tion between platforms to study the choice of platform
sales model by considering the channel roles, and market
share differences of e-retailers. Qin et al. [10] studied the
interaction between sales model choice and logistics ser-
vice strategy in e-commerce marketplace and found that
for platforms, as the cost effectiveness of logistics service
improves, the preferred scenario for platforms evolves from
‘‘marketplace model-platform provides logistics service’’ to
‘‘marketplace model-supplier provides logistics service’’,
and then evolves to ‘‘reseller model-platform provides logis-
tics service’’. This paper investigates the interaction between
sales model selection and anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vice strategy of e-commerce platforms in the context of
blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability, which is a further
addition to the above literature.
B. BLOCKCHAIN ANTI-COUNTERFEITING TRACEABILITY
Due to the prevalence of counterfeit products in various
industries, product security and anti-counterfeiting have
become a major concern for companies and have received
increasing academic attention in recent years [23], [24], [39].
In response to the proliferation of counterfeit products in
e-commerce markets, Meraviglia [18] considers an innova-
tive product monitoring approach to combat counterfeiting
by controlling the entire production and distribution chain.
Chin et al. [25] studied the decision problem of counterfeit
goods in e-commerce transactions based on machine learn-
ing and IoT, and proposed anti-counterfeiting system ideas
and methods from the perspectives of machine learning, IoT
anti-counterfeiting sharing and anti-counterfeiting penalties.
However, the traditional product anti-counterfeiting technol-
ogy is difficult to realize the open and transparent infor-
mation of production and sales chain, which leads to the
product anti-counterfeiting cannot be truly realized [14], [40].
However, product anti-counterfeiting traceability based on
blockchain technology can ensure product data security,
tamper-proof and traceability, and effectively solve the
problem of product counterfeiting [29], [30], [41]–[44].
Dutta et al. [28] collected 178 studies on the use of
blockchain in supply chain operations, exploring industries
where blockchain traceability technology can be successfully
implemented, including agriculture, food, e-commerce, and
more. Choi [45] shows that blockchain is widely recognized
as an innovative, decentralized, distributed, ‘‘state-of-the-
art’’ technology as a shared, open and distributed ledger that
helps businesses store and record data and guarantees the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of all transactions
and data. Fan et al. [46] showed that blockchain technol-
ogy has a powerful information traceability function and
plays an important role in quality control and responding
to product safety issues. Liu et al. [1] constructed an eval-
uation model based on customer needs in the project man-
agement of a blockchain traceability and anti-counterfeiting
platform, showing that to use blockchain technology for
anti-counterfeiting requires the synergy of consumer aware-
ness, legal regulation, and other aspects. Alzahrani and
Bulusu [15] constructed a decentralized anti-counterfeiting
supply chain using NFC and blockchain technologies and
proposed a new decentralized consensus protocol based on
this. Liu and Li [27] constructed a blockchain-based frame-
work for cross-border e-commerce supply chains and pro-
posed corresponding techniques and methods to achieve
product and transaction traceability in supply chain man-
agement. The difference between our paper and this series
of literature is that we consider the rights of consumers.
That is, our model sets the e-commerce platform to provide
blockchain anti-counterfeiting traceability service strategy
VOLUME 9, 2021 138085
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
for consumers, so that consumers can get more specific
product information, inspection and quarantine information
and distribution and storage information, etc. through the
traceability code of goods and the corresponding blockchain
code, so that illegal transactions and fraudulent counterfeit-
ing are nowhere to be found and consumers’ rights and
interests can be effectively ensured. For example, Jingdong’s
intelligent supply chain ecosystem is open to the ‘‘Jingdong
Blockchain Anti-counterfeit Traceability Platform’’, which
protects goods through information security sharing, tamper-
proof and traceable blockchain technology, so that consumers
can buy authentic products. At the same time, we also
take into account the interests of e-commerce platforms, i.e.
we build a model to analyze which option would be more
profitable for e-commerce platforms to build their own BATP
or cooperate with third-party BATPs. This is also the innova-
tion of this paper.
C. PLATFORM STRATEGY SELECTION (SELF-BUILT OR
COOPERATION WITH THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS)
Due to the rise of blockchain anti-counterfeit traceabil-
ity technology, many companies seize the opportunity to
introduce blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability technology
in the marketing process to provide consumers with anti-
counterfeit traceability services. Consumers can scan the
code to verify and obtain information about the whole process
of the product in production, sales, etc., which improves con-
sumers’ trust [47]. Therefore the third research area closely
related to the study of this paper is the question of strategy
choice of the platform, i.e., for some services, whether to
build its own system to provide or to cooperate with third
parties. Liu and Liu [48] summarize the current development
of self-built logistics and analyze the impact of self-built
platforms on product price, sales volume, price and sales vari-
ance from the consumer’s perspective. Niu et al. [49] con-
structed an analytical game model to investigate whether an
e-commerce platform B without logistic advantage cooper-
ates with a competitor A with logistic advantage and found
that B benefits from cooperating with A when the product
competition intensity is in the medium range. Qin et al. [50]
constructed a supply chain consisting of an e-commerce
platform and a seller, where the platform chooses whether
to share the logistics service system with the seller, and
the seller chooses whether to outsource the logistics service
to a third-party platform. They found that as the level of
logistics services and market potential increased, the plat-
form and sellers cooperated as a balanced model. Previ-
ous related studies have mostly focused on the selection of
logistics service strategies, while some scholars have also
conducted research in other areas. Du et al. [51] studied
merchants’ optimal selection strategies for online-to-offline
(O2O) food delivery models, showing that merchants should
choose self-built platforms and self-production models when
the advertising effect generated by self-delivery is larger and
the consumer benefits from third-party platform promotion
are smaller. Zhang et al. [52] developed a model consisting
of manufacturers and third-party sharing platforms, showing
that manufacturers will build their own sharing platforms
when the cost of consumer inconvenience is relatively low
but the marginal cost is relatively high, while manufacturers
will partner with third-party sharing platforms when the cost
of consumer inconvenience is relatively high but the marginal
cost is relatively low.
As mentioned above, the choice of sales model in the
e-commerce market has been the focus of attention of the
business and academic circles. Blockchain anti-counterfeit
traceability can directly hit the pain point of the industry of
the proliferation of counterfeit and shoddy products in the
e-commerce market, and gradually attracts the attention of
academia. Considering the impact of strategies such as sales
model selection and anti-counterfeit traceability services on
the future profitability and sustainable development of enter-
prises, the differential game model can better portray the con-
tinuous timeliness and dynamic changes of strategies, which
is more in line with the actual operation process. Therefore,
this paper discusses the interaction between the choice of
sales model and anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy
of e-commerce platform from a dynamic perspective with the
help of differential game theory.
III. MODEL DESCRIPTION AND ASSUMPTION
A. MODEL DESCRIPTION
We consider a distribution channel consisting of a supplier,
an e-commerce platforms and a continuum of consumers.
The supplier sells a particular brand of product to consumers
through the e-commerce platform, and according to indus-
try practice, the e-commerce platform can choose to sell
the product as a reseller (resale model, e.g., Jingdong and
Huawei) or an agent (agency sales model, e.g., Jingdong
and Sephora). Under the resale model (denoted by R), the
e-commerce platform buys the product from the upstream
supplier at a fixed wholesale price w and determines the retail
price p to the consumer [2], [3]. In contrast, under the agency
sales model (denoted byM), the supplier determines the retail
price p and sells its product directly to the consumer while
paying a percentage of the fee to the platform, which we
call the commission rate ε.1 This structure is used in many
marketplaces, such as Amazon Marketplace, iBook Store.
Without loss of generality, we normalize the marginal cost
of the product to zero, an assumption that has been adopted
in much of the literature [10], [50].
In this process, suppliers invest in technology to improve
the quality of their products by continuously developing inno-
vations and improving production processes, thus increasing
the innovation of their products [20]. e-commerce plat-
forms, on the other hand, conduct marketing campaigns
1Depending on the situation, there are several interchangeable terms for
commission rate, agency fee rate, revenue share ratio, etc. [37]. Note that
in this paper, we set the commission rate as a fixed exogenous parameter,
because in real life, e-commerce platforms usually charge the same commis-
sion rate to suppliers of the same product category. This assumption has also
been adopted in many literatures [6], [37], [50], [53].
138086 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
based on data-driven analysis, i.e., data-driven marketing
(DDM), to stimulate demand while increasing consumer
utility [22]. At the same time, in order to achieve product
anti-counterfeiting and improve the brand goodwill of prod-
ucts, e-commerce platforms can build their own Blockchain
Anti-counterfeiting Traceability Platform (BATP) to pro-
vide consumers with anti-counterfeiting traceability services,
or they can choose to cooperate with a third-party anti-
counterfeiting traceability platform and pay the unit price of
anti-counterfeiting traceability services τ 2 to the third-party
BATP to better protect consumers’ rights and interests.
Table 1 summarizes the parameters and decision variables
of our model.
In practice, anti-counterfeit traceability of goods based
on blockchain technology can effectively solve the trust
problem in traditional traceability and avoid counterfeit and
shoddy products in the process of circulation. Therefore,
blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability has become one of
the key businesses of e-commerce platforms as an effective
tool to combat counterfeit and shoddy products. e-commerce
platforms commonly provide anti-counterfeiting traceability
service strategy in the form of self-built and cooperation
with third parties. Therefore, considering the choice of sales
model of e-commerce platform and the strategy choice of
e-commerce platform between self-built BATP model and
cooperation model with third-party BATP, there are four pos-
sible scenarios, as shown in Fig. 1, and the game order in each
scenario is conducted as follows.
(1) Reseller - e-commerce platform self-built model (RE):
the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller and builds its own
blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability platform
(2) Reseller - e-commerce platform and third-party plat-
form cooperation model (RO): the e-commerce platform acts
as a reseller and cooperates with a third-party blockchain anti-
counterfeit traceability platform.
(3) Agent - e-commerce platform self-built model (ME):
the e-commerce platform acts as an agent and builds its own
blockchain anti-counterfeit traceability platform to provide
anti-counterfeit traceability services to consumers.
(4) Agent - e-commerce platform and third-party platform
cooperation model (MO): The e-commerce platform acts
as an agent and cooperates with the third-party blockchain
anti-counterfeit traceability platform.
B. MODEL ASSUMPTION
The current consumer market environment is becoming
increasingly rational and consumers’ choices are gradually
expanding, and a single common product is no longer com-
petitive. The degree of product innovation is a key factor
influencing consumers’ purchasing behavior, and suppliers
have to continuously develop and innovate their products to
2In this paper, we set the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services
charged by third-party BATPs as a fixed exogenous parameter. Because
in practice, third-party BATPs charge the same unit price of service for
e-commerce platforms of the same product category, a similar assumption
appears in the literature [10].
TABLE 1. Parameters and variables.
improve the degree of product innovation and meet individ-
ualized market needs [20]. In a sense, product innovation is
referred to as an operational tool, so it is a dynamic change
process, and following the literature [20], the dynamics equa-
tion of product innovativeness can be described as
Q̇(t) = σT (t)− γQ(t), Q(0) = Q0 (1)
As an effective tool to combat counterfeit products, anti-
counterfeit traceability services based on blockchain technol-
ogy can meet the practical needs of consumers for product

traceability and improve consumer trust, effectively increas-
ing brand goodwill [1], [30]. And e-commerce platforms
take advantage of their natural data acquisition, and mar-
keting campaigns implemented based on data-driven ana-
lytics can improve consumer utility and promote higher
goodwill [21], [22]. Moreover, the goal of supplier product
innovation is to satisfy consumer needs, and the degree of
product innovation always plays a positive contribution in
accumulating product goodwill [20]. If anti-counterfeit trace-
ability services, data-driven marketing, and product innova-
tiveness are absent, goodwill decays exponentially over time
at a rate of δ. According to the model of Liu et al. [20],
the kinetic equation of goodwill can be described as
Ġ(t) = λT (t)+ ηU (t)− δG(t), G(0) = G0 (2)
The technology investment cost is assumed to be related
to the level of technology investment as CT (t) = kTT 2/2,
with a quadratic representation of the diminishing returns of
such expenditures. Similarly, the anti-counterfeit traceability
service and DDM costs are CI (t) = kI I2/2 and CA(t) =
kAA2/2, respectively, and similar cost construction methods
have been widely adopted in the literature [10], [20], [50].
Market demand depends on the pricing decisions of prod-
uct owners, the degree of innovation of the product, and
the brand goodwill of the product. This is manifested in
the following aspects: (1) demand decreases as product
price increases; (2) suppliers’ technology investment indi-
rectly affects market demand through innovation degree;
and (3) e-commerce platforms indirectly affect market
demand through product anti-counterfeit traceability services
and DDM through brand goodwill. Specifically, the price
function is assumed to be linearly decreasing, and, the inno-
vation degree goodwill function is assumed to be a linearly
separable additive function. Drawing on Liu et al. [20],
the demand function is constructed using separable multi-
plication of price and non-price factors, so that the market
demand function can be described as
D(t) = [D0 − λp(t)] [µQ(t)+ θG(t)] (3)
In the RE model, the supplier sells the product to the
e-commerce platform at wholesale price w. At the same time,
to better encourage the e-commerce platform to conduct data-
driven marketing, it will share φ proportion of the DDM cost
for the e-commerce platform, which builds its own BATP
to provide anti-counterfeit traceability service. Therefore,
the revenue function of the supplier is πRES = w(t)D(t) −
φCA(t)−CT (t), and the revenue function of the e-commerce
platform is πREE = [p(t)− w(t)]D(t) − (1 − φ)CA(t) −
CI (t). In the RO model, the supplier sells the product to the
e-commerce platform at the wholesale price w and shares φ
proportion of the DDM cost for the e-commerce platform,
and the e-commerce platform cooperates with the third-party
BATP and pays the unit price τ to the third-party BATP,
which provides anti-counterfeit traceability service. There-
fore, the revenue function of the supplier isπROS = w(t)D(t)−
φCA(t)−CT (t), the revenue function of the e-commerce plat-
form is πROE = [p(t)− w(t)]D(t)−τD(t)−(1−φ)CA(t), and
to ensure the normal operation of the e-commerce platform,
p(t)−w(t)−τ > 0 needs to be assumed, and the revenue func-
tion of the third-party blockchain anti-counterfeiting trace-
ability platform is πROO = τD(t) − CI (t). In particular,
it should be noted that the wholesale price of the product
will not fluctuate significantly within a certain period of
time, unless there are irresistible factors, and it is assumed
that the wholesale price of the product is a fixed constant
to better focus on the choice of the sales model of the
e-commerce platform, namely w(t) = w (Basak et al., 2017;
Qin et al., 2021). In the ME model, the supplier decides the
retail price p of the product, sells it directly to the consumer,
pays a certain percentage of the cost to the e-commerce
platform, and shares φ percentage of the DDM cost for
the e-commerce platform, which provides anti-counterfeit
traceability service by building its own BATP. Therefore,
the revenue function of the supplier is πMES = (1 − ε)p(t)
D(t) − φCA(t) − CT (t), and the revenue function of the
e-commerce platform is πMEE = εp(t)D(t) − (1 − φ)
CA(t) − CI (t). In the MO model, the supplier sets the price
and pays a certain percentage of the fee to the e-commerce
platform, while sharing φ proportion of the DDM cost for the
e-commerce platform, and the e-commerce platform coop-
erates with the third-party BATP and pays a unit price τ to
the third-party BATP. Therefore, the revenue function of the
138088 VOLUME 9, 2021
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
supplier is πMOS = (1 − ε)p(t)D(t) − φCA(t) − CT (t), and
the revenue function of the e-commerce platform is πMOE =
εp(t)D(t)− τD(t)− (1− φ)CA(t), and the revenue function
of the third-party BATP is πMOO = τD(t)− CI (t).
Suppliers, e-commerce platforms and third-party anti-
counterfeit traceability platforms all operate over an infinite
plan period, seeking to maximize profits and having the same
positive discount rate r .
IV. MODEL ANALYSIS
Based on the previous model description and assump-
tions, this section discusses the optimal pricing of products,
the optimal strategies of suppliers, e-commerce platforms,
and third-party BATPs, the degree of product innovation,
brand goodwill, and firm profits under the four models. It also
further analyzes the impact of key exogenous parameters on
strategy and profit. For the clarity of the model, superscripts
RE, RO, ME, and MO denote different decision models, and
subscripts S, E, and O denote key channel members. All
relevant proofs are shown in the Appendix.

In the RE model, the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller
and builds its own BATP to provide anti-counterfeit traceabil-

and the technology investment level T RE (t) of the product,
and then the e-commerce platform decides the retail price
pRE (t), the anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy IRE (t)
and the DDM strategy ARE (t). Therefore, the decision prob-

Corollary 1: Table 2 shows the relationship between the
optimal technology investment level, anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service strategy, DDM strategy, product innovation
degree, brand goodwill and each key parameter under the RE
model.
TABLE 2. Sensitivity analysis in the RE model.
Corollary 1 shows that, first, the pricing strategy of the
product and the technology investment strategy of the sup-
plier are positively related to the market size. A larger market
size implies a higher probability of profitability for the firm
and a greater incentive for suppliers to invest more in technol-
ogy and increase product innovation. At this point, suppliers
will get a higher return on investment by increasing wholesale
prices, and thus product prices will be higher. Suppliers’ tech-
nology investment initiatives are more than enough to give
consumers access to higher quality products and mitigate the
negative impact of higher product prices on demand. Second,
when the market size and wholesale price meet certain con-
ditions (D0 − 2λw > 0), the supplier technology investment
strategywill be positively correlated with the wholesale price,
the higher the wholesale price will incentivize suppliers to
improve the level of technology investment, otherwise it is
negatively correlated. This indicates that setting a reasonable
wholesale price is crucial for suppliers. Furthermore, there is
a correlation between the anti-counterfeit traceability service
strategy and DDM strategy of e-commerce platforms and
market size and wholesale price. When D0 − λw > 0 is
satisfied, the anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy is
positively influenced by market size, and e-commerce plat-
forms are more interested in investing in blockchain tech-
nology to better realize one-thing quality protection product
traceability and make the sales market stable and sustainable.
At the same time, e-commerce platforms are more motivated
to use their own advantages to fully collect customer informa-
tion, accurately place advertisements and increase marketing
efforts. Under the same conditions, anti-counterfeit traceabil-
ity service and DDM strategy are negatively correlated with
wholesale price. It can be seen that higher wholesale prices
will weaken the enthusiasm of e-commerce platforms for
anti-counterfeit traceability services and DDM, which is not
conducive to the sustainable development of the sales market,
while lower wholesale prices tend to make the suppliers’
revenue insufficient to meet the technical costs, reduce their
enthusiasm for technological innovation, and are not con-
ducive to product innovation. Therefore, enterprises should
pay more attention to the changes in market scale, the impact
of product prices on market demand and other factors, and
seek a reasonable wholesale price, which is the way to long-
term profitability. Finally, the relationship between good-
will and wholesale price is shown in the numerical analysis
section.
B. MODEL-RO
In the RO model, the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller
and cooperates with a third-party BATP to provide anti-
counterfeit traceability services. First, the supplier decides
the wholesale price w and the technology investment level
T RO(t), then the e-commerce platform decides the retail price
pRO(t) and the DDM strategy ARO(t), and the third-party
BATP decides the unit price τ and the anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service strategy IRO(t). Therefore, the decision prob-
lem faced by the supply chain members can be summarized
in (17)–(20), as shown at the bottom of the next page.
Proposition 2: The optimal level of technology investment
for the supplier is
T RO =
σw (D0 − λ(w+ τ )) [µ(r + δ)+ ξθ ]
2kT (r + δ)(r + γ )
(21)
The retail price of the product is

(22)
The optimal anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy is
IRO =

(23)
The optimal DDM strategy for e-commerce platforms is
ARO =

Corollary 2: Table 3 shows the relationship between the
optimal technology investment level, anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service strategy, DDM strategy, product innovation
degree, brand goodwill and each key parameter under the RO
model.
TABLE 3. Sensitivity analysis in the RO model.
Corollary 2 shows that, firstly, market size, wholesale
price and unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services
charged by third-party BATPs create positive incentives for
the pricing strategy of products. Second, subject to certain
conditions, the relationship between market size, wholesale
price and unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services
charged by third-party BATP satisfies D0 − 2λw − λτ > 0,
with higher wholesale price, suppliers have more working
capital and higher technology investment level; when it sat-
isfies D0 − 2λw − λτ < 0, higher wholesale price will
discourage suppliers’ technology investment. This is because,
the higher the wholesale price, the e-commerce platform will
compensate for the negative impact of high wholesale price
by increasing the retail price of the product to maintain its

economic efficiency, which will discourage consumers from
buying the product, so the supplier will also reduce the techni-
cal investment in the product accordingly. Furthermore, third-
party BATPs charge a certain unit price for anti-counterfeit
traceability services can motivate third-party BATPs to pro-
vide anti-counterfeit traceability services, but if the service
price exceeds a certain range, it is easy to make the retail
price of products soar, which reduces consumers’ desire to
purchase and discourages third-party BATPs from provid-
ing anti-counterfeit traceability services. Similarly, when the
unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services is within
a reasonable range, e-commerce platforms will focus their
strategies on cooperation with third-party BATPs. When the
service price exceeds a certain range, leading to a lower anti-
counterfeit traceability service strategy, then e-commerce
platforms can only shift their strategies to reduce the negative
impact of a lower anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy
by increasing their DDM strategies. In the rest of this paper,
we will discuss the important parameter range where the unit
price of anti-counterfeit traceability services is not too high,
namely 0 < τ <

goodwill and wholesale price is shown in the numerical

supplier decides the retail price pME (t) of the product and
the level of technology investment TME (t). Therefore, the

degree, brand goodwill and each key parameter under theME
model.
Corollary 3 suggests that, first, as market size increases,
suppliers have an incentive to raise the retail price of their
products, as well as an incentive to increase the level of tech-
nological investment and further improve product innovation
as a way to boost profits. The anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vice strategy of e-commerce platforms is positively correlated
with market size; the larger the market size, the higher the
likelihood of profitability of the firm and the more incen-
tive the e-commerce platform has to improve anti-counterfeit
traceability services. Similarly, the larger the market size,
the higher the DDM strategy of the e-commerce platform
to promote higher brand goodwill. Second, commission
rates do not affect suppliers’ pricing strategies, but nega-
tively affect technology investment strategies, meaning that
excessive commission rates discourage suppliers’ technol-
ogy investment activities and discourage product innovation.
The commission rate, on the other hand, positively affects
the anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy and DDM
strategy of e-commerce platforms. A higher commission rate
means that a higher revenue goes to the platform, and the
platform has more incentive to improve its anti-counterfeit
traceability strategy when it has financial assurance. Finally,
the impact of commission rate on brand goodwill is shown in
the numerical analysis section.
D. MODEL-MO
In the MO model, the e-commerce platform acts as an
agent and cooperates with the third-party BATP to provide
anti-counterfeit traceability services. First, the e-commerce
platform decides the commission rate ε and DDM strategy
AMO(t), and the third-party BATP decides the unit price τ
and the anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy IMO(t).
Then the supplier decides the retail price pMO(t) and the tech-
nology investment level TMO(t) of the product. Therefore,
the decision problem faced by the supply chain members can
be summarized in (45)–(48), as shown at the bottom of the
next page.

Corollary 4: Table 5 shows the relationship between the
optimal technology investment level, anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service strategy, DDM strategy, product innovation
degree, brand goodwill and each key parameter under theMO
model.
TABLE 5. Sensitivity analysis in the MO model.
Corollary 4 shows that market size positively affects the
pricing strategy of suppliers, technology investment strategy,
and anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy of third-party
BATPs. The influence of market size on the DDM strategy
of e-commerce platforms is determined by the unit price of
anti-counterfeit traceability services charged by third-party
BATPs, and in a reasonable range, (i.e., 0 < τ < )
the market size will have a positive influence on the DDM
strategy of e-commerce platforms. If the unit price of anti-
counterfeit traceability services charged by the third-party
BATP exceeds a certain range, it will make the e-commerce
platform have no extra funds for DDM, and in such an unfa-
vorable environment, the e-commerce platformwill reduce its
DDM strategy as the market scale expands. In theMOmodel,
the commission rate will not affect the third-party BATP anti-
counterfeit traceability strategy.
V. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Based on the above model analysis, we compare the retail
price, technology investment level, anti-counterfeit traceabil-
ity service strategy, and DDM strategy of the products under
the four different models.
Proposition 5: By comparing the optimal product retail
prices in the four scenarios, we have
(1) When the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller, the
relationship between the optimal retail price of the product is
pRO > pRE .
(2) When the e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the
relationship of the optimal retail price of the product is pMO =
pME .
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the relationship of the optimal retail price of the product is
pRE > pME .
(4) When an e-commerce platform cooperates with a third-
party BATP, the relationship between the optimal retail price
of the product is pRO > pMO.
Proposition 5 shows that: (1) when an e-commerce plat-
form acts as a reseller, the retail price depends on whether the
e-commerce platform builds its own BATP or cooperates with
a third-party BATP. Since the investment cost of self-built
BATP is high and the cycle time is relatively long, the e-
commerce platform can only choose to raise the retail price
to make up for the capital gap, so the retail price of products
when self-built BATP is higher than the retail price of prod-
ucts when cooperating with third-party BATP. (2) When the
e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the supplier decides
the retail price of the product and supplies it directly to the
consumer, avoiding the double marginal effect, and the retail
price will not be affected whether the e-commerce platform
builds its own BATP or cooperates with a third-party BATP.
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the retail price in resale mode is higher than the retail price
in agency mode. The reason is that the e-commerce platform
has the power to control the price of the product when acting
as a reseller, and will raise the retail price due to the existence

of the double marginal effect and in order to ensure that
more funds are available to support the BATP operation. (4)
When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the third-
party BATP, on the one hand, due to the existence of the
double marginal effect, on the other hand, the e-commerce
platform has to pay the unit price of anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service to the third-party BATP, which costs money.
Therefore, when the e-commerce platform has the pricing
power, it will increase the product price accordingly.
Proposition 6: By comparing the optimal
anti-counterfeiting traceability strategies in four scenarios,
we have
(1) When the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller, the
relationship of the optimal anti-counterfeit traceability strat-
egy is IRE > IRO if D0 − 2λw − 2λτ > 0, otherwise
IRE < IRO.
(2) When the e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the
relationship of the optimal anti-counterfeiting traceability
strategy is IME > IMO if 0 < τ <
D0ε
2λ , otherwise,
IME < IMO.
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the relationship of the optimal anti-counterfeiting traceability
strategy is IME > IRE if 2D0 − λw > 0, otherwise,
IME < IRE .
(4) When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the
third-party BATP, the relationship of the optimal anti-
counterfeit traceability strategy is IMO > IRO.
Proposition 6 shows that: (1) when the e-commerce
platform acts as a reseller, the relationship between the
optimal anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy under
different scenarios depends on the interaction betweenwhole-
sale price, unit price of service and market size, and when
the three satisfy certain conditions (D0 − 2λw − 2λτ > 0),
the e-commerce platform’s self-built BATP will produce a
higher level of anti-counterfeit traceability. (2) When the
e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the relationship
between the optimal anti-counterfeit traceability service strat-
egy under different scenarios is highly correlated with the
unit price of the service. When the unit price of the service
is within a certain range, the e-commerce platform’s self-
built BATP will produce a higher level of anti-counterfeit
traceability service.When the unit price of service is too high,
the third-party BATP makes more profit and will produce a
higher level of anti-counterfeit traceability service. (3) When
the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP, the agency
model will generate higher anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vice level when the wholesale price and market scale meet
certain conditions. The reason is that the e-commerce plat-
form charges a certain commission from suppliers under the
agency model, which can have more sufficient capital flow
to the operation of BATP. Otherwise, the resale sale gen-
erates a higher level of anti-counterfeit traceability service.
(4)When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the third-
party BATP, the anti-counterfeit traceability strategy under
the MO model is higher than that under the RO model.
Proposition 7: By comparing the optimal DDM strategies
for the four scenarios, we have
(1) When the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller, the
relationship of the optimal DDM strategy is ARE > ARO if
2D0 − λτ − 2λ2 > 0, otherwise ARE < ARO.
(2) When the e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the
relationship of the optimal DDM strategy is
AME > AMO.
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the relationship of the optimal DDM strategy is ARE > AME
if λw− 2D0 > 0, otherwise ARE < AME .
(4) When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the
third-party BATP, the relationship of the optimal DDM
strategy is ARO > AMO if λw − 2D0 > 0, otherwise
ARO < AMO.
Proposition 7 shows that: (1) when the e-commerce plat-
form acts as a reseller, the relationship of the optimal DDM
strategy under different scenarios depends on the market size
and the unit price of the third-party BATP anti-counterfeiting
traceability service charge. (2) When the e-commerce plat-
form acts as a reseller, the relationship of the size of the opti-
mal DDM strategy under different scenarios is not affected
by external factors, and the DDM strategy in the ME mode
is higher than that in the MO mode, which is because when
the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP, it does not
need to pay external fees and has sufficient funds to run itself,
and the DDM strategy is higher. (3) When the e-commerce
platform builds its own BATP, the relationship between the
size of the optimal DDM strategy under different scenarios
depends on the influence of wholesale price and market size.
(4)When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the third-
party BATP, the relationship between the size of the optimal
DDM strategy under different scenarios also depends on the
influence of wholesale price and market size. Thus, it can be
seen that the choice of sales model of e-commerce platform
affects the operation strategy of enterprises, and external fac-
tors such as market scale, wholesale price and the unit price
of anti-counterfeit traceability service of third-party BATP
also affect the strategy. Therefore, from the supplier’s point of
view, it is important to set reasonable wholesale prices. From
the perspective of a company’s investment, it is vital for the
company to keep an eye on the changes in market size and set
reasonable rates.
Proposition 8: By comparing the optimal level of technol-
ogy investment in the four scenarios, we have
(1) When the e-commerce platform acts as a reseller, the
relationship of the optimal technology investment level is
T RE > T RO.
(2) When the e-commerce platform acts as an agent, the
relationship of the optimal technology investment level is
TME = TMO.
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the relationship of the optimal technology investment level is
TME > T RE if (1 − ε)D2
0 − 2w(D0 − λw) > 0, otherwise
TME > T RE .
VOLUME 9, 2021 138095
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
(4) When the e-commerce platform cooperates with the
third-party BATP, the relationship of the optimal DDM strat-
egy is TMO > T RO if (1−ε)D2
0−2λw (D0 − λ(w+ τ )) > 0,
otherwise TMO > T RO.
Proposition 8 shows that: (1) the level of technology invest-
ment of suppliers under the RE model is higher when the
e-commerce platform acts as a reseller, because the pricing
power and anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy are
jointly controlled by the e-commerce platform under the RE
model compared to the RO model, leading to less double
marginalization effect. (2) When the e-commerce platform
acts as an agent, the technology investment level of suppli-
ers under ME model is the same as that under MO model.
(3) When the e-commerce platform builds its own BATP,
the relationship between the optimal technology investment
level of suppliers is influenced by external factors such as
commission rate, market size and wholesale price. (4) When
the e-commerce platform cooperates with the third-party
BATP, the relationship of the optimal technical investment
level of suppliers is influenced by multiple factors such as
commission rate, market scale, wholesale price, and the unit
price of anti-counterfeit traceability service charged by the
third-party BATP.
VI. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
Considering the complexity of the model, some comparative
results are difficult to obtain. This section validates the previ-
ous findings through numerical analysis and further analyzes
the impact of market size, wholesale price, and unit price of
anti-counterfeit traceability services charged by third-party
BATPs on the strategy. Then, we also explore the impact of
key parameters on channel members’ profits. According to
the assumptions of the literature [54], [55] and the actual
situation, the parameters are set as follows:
r = 0.1, σ = 1, α = 1, β = 1, γ = 0.5, δ = 0.6, λ=1,
µ = 1, θ = 1, ξ = 1, D0 = 10, kT = 2, kI = 2, kA = 2,
φ = 0.3
A. TYPES OF GRAPHICS EFFECT ANALYSIS OF THE
DECISION MODE AND TIME
The initial innovation degreesQ0 = 0 < Qi∞ andQ0 = 80 >
Qi∞, G0 = 0 < Gi∞ and G0 = 200 > Gi∞, respectively,
where, i ∈ {RE,RO,ME,MO}, the sales channel operation
time is set to t ∈ [0, 15], and the wholesale price, commission
rate, and unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service
charged by the third-party BATP are set within a reasonable
range, w = 2, ε = 0.5, τ = 0.5. The time evolution
trajectories of innovation degree and brand goodwill under
the four models are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.3.
It can be observed from Fig. 2 that the initial value of
innovation does not affect the final steady-state results, and
the system has a steady-state equilibrium in all four modes;
moreover, when the initial innovation degree is the same,
the time trajectory of innovation degree in all three modes
is always QME∞ = QMO∞ > QRE∞ > QRO∞ . This indicates that
FIGURE 2. Time trajectories of innovation degree.
FIGURE 3. Time trajectories of brand goodwill.
the sales mode of the e-commerce platform affects the degree
of product innovation, and the choice of agency mode is more
favorable to product innovation. As can be observed from
Fig. 3, initial brand goodwill does not affect the final steady-
state results, and this scale relationship is equally robust,
and the time trajectory of brand goodwill is always GME∞ >
GMO∞ > GRE∞ > GRO∞ for all four modes when the initial brand
goodwill is the same. This indicates that the sales model and
strategy choice of the e-commerce platform also affects brand
goodwill, with the highest value of brand goodwill under the
ME model. Since the size of the initial innovation value does
not affect the relationship between the size of the innovation
degree under the four modes, the initial innovation degree is
set toQ0 = 0 in the later paper, and similarly the initial brand
goodwill is set to G0 = 0.
B. IMPACT ANALYSIS OF KEY PARAMETERS ON PRODUCT
INNOVATION, BRAND GOODWILL AND CORPORATE
PROFIT
1) WHOLESALE PRICE
Fig. 4 shows that product innovation and brand goodwill
show a trend of increasing and then decreasing in both RE
and RO models. This indicates that reasonable wholesale
prices play a positive role in improving product innovation
and brand goodwill, while if the wholesale prices are too
high, they can be detrimental to product innovation. Similarly,
when the wholesale price is too high, the cost of ordering
products on e-commerce platforms becomes higher, and their
anti-counterfeit traceability service and DDM will be less

FIGURE 4. The impact of wholesale price on product innovation and
brand goodwill.
active at this time as the wholesale price increases, thus
damaging brand goodwill as well.
Fig. 5(a) shows that when e-commerce platforms choose
the resale model, charging wholesale prices becomes the
main way for suppliers to benefit, and the increase in whole-
sale prices can improve suppliers’ profits. However, if the
wholesale price exceeds a certain range, resulting in low
product innovation and brand goodwill, it can lead to a large
number of consumers lost, which leads to a decrease in sup-
plier profits. It is worth noting that when the wholesale price
is very high, the supplier’s profit appears to recover because
the higher wholesale price can compensate for the loss caused
by lower product innovation and lower brand goodwill, so the
profit appears to rebound.
Fig. 5(b) shows that with this numerical arithmetic, the
e-commerce platform chooses to act as a distributor and
builds its own BATP, which is a better choice for itself. And
when the e-commerce platform acts as a distributor, if the
wholesale price is within a certain reasonable range, it can
help the e-commerce platform achieve high profitability, but
if the wholesale price keeps increasing, it will put a lot of cost
pressure on the e-commerce platform, leading to a significant
drop in its profit, or even difficult to maintain a break-even.
Fig. 5(c) shows that when the e-commerce platform acts as
a reseller, for the third-party BATP, although it does not need
to pay the supplier, the wholesale price set by the supplier
still has an indirect impact on the third-party BATP. When
the wholesale price is within a reasonable range, the profit of
the third-party BATP gets increased, and the wholesale price
is too high, which will cause damage to the third-party BATP
getting profit.
FIGURE 5. The impact of wholesale price on profit.
2) COMMISSION RATE
Fig. 6 shows that in the resale model, product innovation
and brand goodwill are independent of the commission rate.
In contrast, in the agency sales model, the supplier pays a cer-
tain percentage of commission to the e-commerce platform.
The higher the commission rate, the smaller the share of profit
the supplier receives and the less motivated he is to invest
in product technology, leading to lower product innovation,
which indirectly damages brand goodwill.
Fig. 7(a) shows that as the commission rate increases, the
supplier’s profit gradually decreases and is even lower than
the profit level under the resale model. The reason for this
is that, on the one hand, the commission rate increases and
the supplier’s cost expenses increase. On the other hand, with
the increase in commission rate, suppliers lose their incentive
to invest in product technology, which leads to a decrease in
product innovation and brand goodwill, a decrease in con-
sumer demand, and thus a decrease in profits.
VOLUME 9, 2021 138097
F. Guo et al.: Optimized Combination of e-commerce Platform Sales Model
FIGURE 6. The impact of commission rate on product innovation and
brand goodwill.
Fig. 7(b) shows that: the fee rate of e-commerce platform
directly determines the size of its own profit.With the increas-
ing commission rate, the profit of e-commerce platform in
agencymodewill increase significantly, andmay even exceed
the profit level in resale mode. However, the e-commerce
platform should not blindly increase the commission rate
in order to obtain high profits. Excessive commission rate
will not only lead to the loss of suppliers, but also cause
the decrease of product innovation and brand goodwill, and
the decrease of market sales, resulting in the decrease of
profits of the e-commerce platform, which is not conducive
to the market environment and the sustainable development
of the e-commerce platform. In a market environment with
unstable commission rates, e-commerce platforms pursuing
stable revenue will tend to choose the resale model, while
e-commerce platforms pursuing high risk, but high revenue
will prefer the agency sales model.
Fig. 7(c) shows that the commission rate not only changes
the revenue distribution of the parties involved, but also has an
indirect effect on the third-party BATP. The profit of the third-
party BATP decreases with the increase of commission rate
in MO model, which is due to the decrease of sales volume
caused by high commission rate and also indirectly affects the
profit of the third-party BATP.
3) UNIT PRICE OF ANTI-COUNTERFEIT TRACEABILITY
SERVICES CHARGED BY THIRD-PARTY BATP
Fig. 8(a) shows that the unit price of anti-counterfeit trace-
ability services charged by the third-party BATP under the RO
model has a negative impact on the degree of product innova-
tion. The higher the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability
FIGURE 7. Impact of commission rate on profit.
services charged by the third-party BATP, the greater the cost
pressure on the e-commerce platform, which will increase
the retail price of the product and damage the product sales,
which also leads to a lower motivation of suppliers to invest
in technology and is not conducive to product innovation.
Fig. 8(b) shows that when an e-commerce platform
chooses to cooperate with a third-party BATP, the unit price of
anti-counterfeit traceability charged by the third-party BATP
will have a negative impact on the brand goodwill regardless
of whether it chooses to resell or resell, and the negative
impact is even greater in the RO model.
Fig. 9(a) shows that when e-commerce platforms cooperate
with the third-party BATP, the supplier’s profit is affected by
the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service charged
by the third-party BATP, and the profit is slightly affected in
the MO mode and more affected in the RO mode.
Fig. 9(b) shows that when an e-commerce platform coop-
erates with a third-party BATP, the fee rate of the third-party
BATP will directly determine the size of the e-commerce
platform’s profit, thus affecting the choice of the e-commerce

goodwill.
platform’s salesmodel.With the increasing fees of third-party
BATPs, the profits of e-commerce platforms are significantly
reduced. Therefore, under the conditions of fixed market
size, wholesale price and commission rate, many e-commerce
platforms prefer to build their own BATP platforms.
Fig. 9(c) shows that the unit price of anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service charged by the third-party BATP will deter-
mine the size of its own profit, and its own profit will increase
with the increase of the fee rate, which is less affected in the
RO mode and more affected in the MO mode.
C. THE INTERACTION OF KEY PARAMETERS ON SUPPLIER
PROFITABILITY
1) THE INTERACTION OF THE WHOLESALE PRICE AND
MARKET SIZE
Fig. 10(a) shows that when the market size remains at
or below the medium level, the scenario in which suppli-
ers achieve higher profits with higher wholesale prices is
RE→RO. When the market size is moderate and above,
suppliers achieve higher profits in the RE model. Fig. 10(b)
shows that suppliers achieve higher profits in the ME model.
Fig. 10(c) shows that the scenario in which suppliers achieve
higher profits with higher wholesale prices when the market
size is maintained at or below the medium level is ME→RE.
When the market size is maintained at a medium level and
above, suppliers achieve higher profits in the ME model.
Figure 10(d) shows that when the market size is maintained
at medium level and below, the scenario in which suppliers
achieve higher profits as the wholesale price increases is
FIGURE 9. Impact of unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service
charged by third-party BATP on profit.
MO→RO.When themarket size is maintained at the medium
level and above, suppliers achieve higher profits in the MO
model.
In summary, when the market size is maintained at a
medium level and below, the scenario of higher profitability
for suppliers with higher wholesale prices would be, when
the market size is maintained at a medium level and above,
suppliers achieve higher profitability in the ME model.
2) THE INTERACTION OF MARKET SIZE AND UNIT PRICE OF
ANTI-COUNTERFEIT TRACEABILITY SERVICES CHARGED BY
THE THIRD-PARTY BATP
Comprehensive Fig. 11(a)-(b): 1) When the market size is
small and the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service
charged by the third-party BATP is high, it is the wisest choice
for the e-commerce platform to build its own BATP; this is
also beneficial to the suppliers, otherwise the e-commerce
platform faces the risk of losing profits due to the high
unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service, which may

increase the retail price of the products and damage the
market demand, thus it will indirectly affect suppliers’ prof-

2) When the market size is at the lower middle level and the
unit price of service is high, suppliers make more profit in the
ROmode. 3)When the market size is at a high level, suppliers
make more profit in the RE mode because the larger market

price of anti-counterfeit traceability service.
In summary, as the market size increases and the unit price
of services decreases, the scenarios in which suppliers can
achieve higher profits are RE→RO→RE.

D. THE INTERACTION OF KEY PARAMETERS ON SUPPLIER
PROFITABILITY THE INTERACTION OF KEY PARAMETERS
ON THE PROFITABILITY OF e-commerce PLATFORMS
In this section, we examine the preferences of e-commerce
platforms and analyze four scenarios by considering the
strategic interaction between sales model and strategy choice.
We consider the impact of two main factors on the model
choice and strategy choice of e-commerce platforms - market
size and cost effectiveness of anti-counterfeit traceability
services (i.e. χ = α2/k).3

Fig. 12 shows that: 1) the area below the dotted line indicates
a scenario with negative value for money, a situation that is

not conducive to sustainable market development and will
be eliminated from the market, so we only analyze the area
above the dotted line. 2) Under the resale model, e-commerce
platforms will realize higher profits under the RE model. The
rationale depends on the fact that compared to the RO model,
the e-commerce platform under the RE model has both pric-
ing power and the right to develop anti-counterfeit trace-
ability strategies, with less double marginalization effect,
thus promoting higher profits. In contrast, under the agency
model, e-commerce platforms earn higher profits under the
ME model. This shows that self-built BATP is a better
choice for e-commerce platforms. 3) Further, we observe
in Fig. 12(c) that when e-commerce platforms build their
own BATP, the best choice for e-commerce platforms is
resale→agent sales as the market size increases and the cost
effectiveness decreases, and when the market size is at the
medium and above level, the best choice for e-commerce
platforms becomes resale. As the market scale and the cost
performance of anti-counterfeit traceability service gradually
increase, the e-commerce platform will have obvious profit
advantage in RE mode.
2) THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COST PERFORMANCE
OF ANTI-COUNTERFEIT TRACEABILITY SERVICE OF
E-COMMERCE PLATFORM AND THE COST PERFORMANCE
OF THIRD-PARTY BATP ANTI-COUNTERFEIT TRACEABILITY
SERVICE
In the core model, we assume that the cost of anti-counterfeit
traceability services for e-commerce platforms and third-
party BATP anti-counterfeit traceability services are the
same. However, according to the industry practice, the
anti-counterfeit traceability services provided by different
platforms may differ due to different technical levels and
operational capabilities. To incorporate this situation, in this
subsection we extend the model to consider the impact of dif-
ferent anti-counterfeit traceability service costs on the choice
of e-commerce platforms. Specifically, we define χE =
α2/kE and χO = α2/kO to represent the cost effectiveness
of anti-counterfeit traceability services for e-commerce plat-
forms and third-party BATPs, respectively.
Observing Fig. 13, when the cost performance ratio is
negative, it will eventually be eliminated from the market,
so we only focus on the upper right area of the dotted line.
Fig. 13 shows that: on the basis of the e-commerce platform
acting as a distributor, when the third-party BATP is more
advantageous than the e-commerce platform in terms of cost
performance of anti-counterfeiting traceability services, the
e-commerce platform earns higher profits in the RO model.
When the price of anti-counterfeit traceability service of the
e-commerce platform is more advantageous, the e-commerce
platform will choose to build its own BATP. On the basis of
the e-commerce platform acting as an agent, the e-commerce
platform earns higher profits under the model. On the basis of
the e-commerce platform’s self-built BATP, the e-commerce
platform prefers to choose the resale sales model. The reason
is that in the ME scenario, the e-commerce platform cedes

the channel right to the supplier and can only passively bear
the market result. However, in the RE scenario, the platform
can seizemore channel power (i.e. pricing power). Intuitively,
companies with a greater advantage in cost performance
of anti-counterfeit traceability services have an incentive to
provide a higher level of anti-counterfeit traceability services.
Therefore, when the third-party BATP platform has a signif-
icant advantage in the cost performance of anti-counterfeit
traceability services, the e-commerce platform will prefer
the third-party BATP platform to undertake anti-counterfeit
traceability services; otherwise, the e-commerce platform
will prefer to provide anti-counterfeit traceability services
itself. The underlying principle lies in the fact that companies
with higher cost performance of anti-counterfeit traceability
services have an incentive to provide higher service levels
of anti-counterfeit traceability services and thus gain higher
profits.
VII. DISCUSSION AND RESULTS
A. DISCUSSION
This paper considers a distribution channel consisting of
suppliers, e-commerce platforms and continuous consumers,
and solves the optimal strategy of members, product innova-
tion, brand goodwill and corporate profit under four models
with the help of Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming
theory, and analyzes them. Through comparative analysis,
the magnitude of strategies under different models is studied.
And the influence of key parameters on strategy and profit
is further investigated by numerical arithmetic examples, and
the influence of the interaction between sales model and strat-
egy selection on profit is discussed. The following discussion
are obtained:
In previous related studies, Qin et al. [10] considered the
optimal combination of platform sales model selection and
logistics service strategy, focusing on the impact of cost-
effectiveness of logistics service on the equilibrium scenario.
However, in real life, some force majeure factors can have
an important impact on firms’ strategies. Therefore, unlike
the study by Qin et al. [10] we also examined the impact
of important factors such as market size, wholesale price,
and unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services charged
by third-party BATPs on each strategy. We find that market
size promotes higher retail prices for products and increases
the incentive for suppliers to invest in technology. Inter-
estingly, the impact of market size, wholesale price, and
unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services charged
by third-party BATPs on anti-counterfeit traceability strategy
and DDM strategy under different models is determined by
different conditions. In the RE model, the effects of mar-
ket size and wholesale price on anti-counterfeit traceability
service strategy and DDM strategy of e-commerce platform
depend on their interactions. In the RO model, market size
will always incentivize the third-party BATP to improve the
anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy, and the whole-
sale price will inhibit this strategy. the influence of market
size and wholesale price on the DDM strategy of e-commerce
platform depends on the unit price of anti-counterfeit trace-
ability service of the third-party BATP. In the ME model,
market size will promote the anti-counterfeit traceability ser-
vice strategy and DDM strategy of e-commerce platform,
and promote higher brand goodwill. The increase in com-
mission rate will weaken suppliers’ technology investment
level, which is detrimental to product innovation degree,
but will prompt e-commerce platforms to improve anti-
counterfeit traceability service strategy and DDM strategy to
reduce the negative impact of impaired product innovation
degree on demand. In the MO model, market size and the
unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service charged by
third-party BATPs consistently motivate third-party BATPs
to improve anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy,
and market size has an The impact of market size on
DDM strategy of e-commerce platforms depends on the
pricing of anti-counterfeit traceability services of third-party
BATPs.

Second, Qin et al. [10] show that the ‘‘reseller-supplier’’
scenario generates lower sales prices when the logistics
service is more cost-effective, and the ‘‘market-supplier’’
scenario generates lower sales prices when the logistics
service is less cost-effective. In contrast to the results of
Qin et al. [10], we find that the retail price of the prod-
uct in the resale model is higher than that in the agency
model due to the double marginal effect, and the RO model
generates a higher retail price by comparing the retail price
of the product in the four models. The retail prices of the
products in ME and MO models are the same and the
lowest.
Third, unlike previous studies, in this paper we analyze the
effects of key factors on product innovation, brand goodwill,
and firm profits from a dynamic perspective. In the resale
model, an appropriate range of wholesale prices can lead
to higher product innovation, brand goodwill, and profits of
each firm, but too high wholesale prices can weaken product
innovation, brand goodwill, and profits of each firm, which is
not conducive to the sustainable development of the market.
The increase of commission rate under agency model will
damage the product innovation degree and brand goodwill,
and lead to lower profits of suppliers and third-party BATPs.
A reasonable commission rate will enhance the profit of the
e-commerce platform, but if the commission rate is too high,
it will damage the profit of the e-commerce platform. The
unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability service set by the
third-party BATP can improve its own profit, but otherwise,
it will be detrimental to the degree of product innovation,
brand goodwill, and the profit of suppliers and e-commerce
platforms.
B. RESULTS
Based on the above analysis and conclusions, we draw the
following management comments. First, the market size will
promote the retail price of products and increase the moti-
vation of suppliers to invest in technology. The impact of
market size on anti-counterfeit traceability service strategy
and DDM strategy under different models is determined by
different conditions. Second, by comparing the retail prices of
the products under the four models, it is found that the highest
retail prices of the products under the RO model. By compar-
ing the anti-counterfeit traceability service strategies under
the four models, it was found that the results depend on
the interaction between the wholesale price, the unit price
of anti-counterfeit traceability service charged by the third-
party BATP, and the market size. In addition, we found that
suppliers’ profitability under different models can be con-
strained by multiple factors. On the one hand, the interaction
of market size and wholesale price, when the market size
is maintained at a medium level or below, with the increase
in wholesale price, the situation where suppliers can achieve
higher profits will evolve from ME to RO. Higher profits are
realized in the ME model when the market size is above the
medium level. On the other hand, the interaction of market
size and the unit price of anti-counterfeit traceability services
of third-party BATPs, as the market size increases, the unit
price of services decreases, and the scenarios in which sup-
pliers can achieve higher profits are RE→RO→RE. Finally,
we test the four models by considering the strategic inter-
action of sales model and strategy choice of e-commerce
platforms. Self-built BATP is found to be a better choice
for e-commerce platforms, and the outcome of the choice of
sales model depends on the interaction between market size
and cost effectiveness of anti-counterfeit traceability services.
When the market size is at a below-medium level, the best
choice for e-commerce platforms as the market size increases
and the cost performance decreases is resale→agent sale.
When the market size is at a medium and above level,
the best choice for e-commerce platforms becomes resale.
In addition, we extend the model that the cost performance
of anti-counterfeit traceability services of e-commerce plat-
form and third-party BATP are different. Only when the
cost performance of anti-counterfeit traceability services of
e-commerce platform is very low and the cost performance
of anti-counterfeit traceability services of third-party BATP
is very high, the e-commerce platform prefers the RO model,
otherwise, it will prefer the RE model.
This paper also has the limitation of not including whole-
sale price as a decision variable for suppliers. Also, future
research can consider consumer surplus and social welfare
based on our model and analyze which case generates higher
consumer surplus and social welfare.
