ABSTRACT
Maximal (also miner) extractable value, or MEV, usually refers to
the value that privileged players can extract by strategically or-
dering, censoring, and placing transactions in a blockchain. Each
blockchain network, which we refer to as a domain, has its own
consensus, ordering, and block-creation mechanisms, which gives
rise to different optimal strategies to extract MEV. The strategic
behaviour of rational players, known as searchers, lead to MEV
games that have different impacts and externalities in each domain.
Several ordering mechanisms, which determine the inclusion and
position of transactions in a block, have been considered to con-
struct alternative games to organise MEV extraction, and minimize
negative externalities; examples include sealed bid auctions, first
input first output, and private priority gas auctions. However, to
date, no sufficiently formal and abstract definition of MEV games
have been made.
In this paper, we take a step toward the formalization of MEV
games and compare different ordering mechanisms and their ex-
ternalities. In particular, we attempt to formalize games that arise
from common knowledge MEV opportunities, such as arbitrage and
sandwich attacks. In defining these games, we utilise a theoretical
framework that provides groundwork for several important roles
and concepts, such as the searcher, sequencer, domain, and bun-
dle. We also introduce the price of MEV as the price of anarchy of
MEV games, a measure that provides formal comparison between
different ordering mechanisms.

1 INTRODUCTION
The notion of miner-extractable value (MEV) introduced in [5], and
formally defined in [3], measures the value that miners can extract
by strategically ordering, censoring, and including transactions
in a block. This extra value is usually induced by different DeFi
protocols, such as decentralized exchanges and Lending protocols.
The most popular MEV operations are cyclic arbitrage and sand-
wiches
1
. In general, block proposers (typically validators or miners),
have the power to dictate or influence the inclusion and ordering
of pending transactions in a new block. Thus, rational proposers
have access to extra rewards per block. However, as shown in [5],
this power is not limited to block proposers. Blockchain users and
bots, usually termed searchers, can use strategies like spamming
transactions or outbidding competitors to extract MEV themselves.
For this and other reasons, the term miner-extractable value has
evolved to mean maximal extractable value, formally defined in
[16], which does not limit extraction to block proposers. We often
refer to block proposers and searchers as players.
Depending on the network protocol, which we refer to as the
domain, and type of MEV being extracted, rational searchers have
incentives to take different actions to increase their expected rev-
enue. For example, [5] showed that Ethereum, a network with
higher propagation latency, incentivises searchers to widen their
view of the mempool to outbid their competitors, while domains
like Polygon PoS, where the propagation of transactions is proba-
bilistic, incentivises searchers to spam transactions to extract MEV.
This motivates a more general formulation of the MEV game pre-
sented in [5] such that models of rational searcher behaviour can
be derived from a domain input.
1.1 Our contributions
The main goal of this paper is to formalise MEV games with a finite
number of players under different ordering mechanism and auction
designs which are defined by various environment conditions and
rules such as latency of players, PoW/PoS consensus, and mempool
visibility. To this end, the following topics will be covered:

• Inspired by [3], we provide a formal definition of MEV and lo-
cal MEV as an optimization problem constrained by player re-
sources. In our definition, we emphasize relative constraints
like capital, software resources, and view of the mempool.
• We formally define a more abstract and general MEV game
that provides a foundation for analysing the incentives of
searchers in different domains.
• We also introduce different negative externalities that arise
from MEV games, and we formally define the Price of Anar-
chy in MEV games under different cost functions as a way to
quantify their impact. We explore the specific case of block
space misuse, which we refer to as the price of MEV, and
compute this to characterize and classify different ordering
mechanisms.
1.2 Previous Work
In Flashboys 2.0 [5] Daian et al. proposed a formalization of the
priority gas auction (PGA) model and proved mathematically and
empirically the existence of Grim-Trigger Nash equilibrium under
certain conditions. However, the results are limited to two players
and the PoW Ethereum domain, and do not consider reverted trans-
action costs proportional to the bid or that players can engage in
Sybil attacks. In [9], the authors explore the equilibrium of sand-
wich MEV as a router game. Likewise, in [18], the authors compare
empirically the miner’s revenue and the searchers competition of ar-
bitrage opportunities before and after the introduction of Flashbots
MEV auctions on Ethereum. In [10], the first formalization of cross
chain MEV was proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no formal and empirical study on the impacts of MEV on
several distinct domains.
2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
In general, miner or maximum extractive value (MEV) is a term that
refers to any excess profits that a block proposer or searcher can
make based on transaction ordering and/or transaction inclusion.
MEV was introduced in [5], formally defined in [3], and extended in
cross-domain environments in [10]. Another similar definition was
given in [16], except MEV was treated independently of a player.
The MEV opportunities we consider in this paper are limited to
the profits a player can obtain by modifying the blockchain state.
In this section, we will formalize this kind of MEV opportunity
using the concept of profitable ‘bundles’. Then, we will define ‘lo-
cal’ MEV as the maximally profitable bundle a specific player can
construct. Similar to [10], we start by formally defining the domain
and searcher:
Definition 2.1. A domainD is a self-contained system with a glob-
ally shared state st. This state is altered by various agents through
actions (sending transactions, constructing blocks, slashing, etc.),
that execute within a shared execution environment’s semantics.
Each domain has a predefined consensus protocol that includes a
set of valid algorithms to order transactions, denoted by prt(D).
A blockchain is a domain, however, there are other non-blockchain
domains that also have MEV, like centralized exchanges.
Definition 2.2. A searcher (in general, we will call it a player)
in a domain D is a participant that assumes that sequencers fol-
low a specific set of rules and take strategic actions (send bundles
with specific bids) to maximize their own utility. In general, we
will assume that a player’s utility depends linearly on their token
balances.
In a domain D with state st, the update of the state st after
executing transactions tx is given by st ◦ tx. For an ordered set of
transactions 𝐵 = {tx1, ..., tx𝑙 }, we have the composition st ◦ 𝐵 =
st ◦ tx1 ◦ .... ◦ tx𝑙 .
Similar to [3], we use Addr to denote the set of all possible ac-
counts andT to denote the set of all tokens.We define𝑏 : 𝐴×T→ Z
as the function that maps a pair of, an account and a token, to its
current balance. More precisely, for 𝑎 ∈ Addr we let 𝑏 (𝑎, ·) denote
the balance of all tokens held in 𝑎 and𝑏 (𝑎,𝑇 ) denote the account bal-
ance of token𝑇 . Abusing notation, we will denote by 𝑏 (𝑎) the value
of 𝑏 (𝑎, ·) priced by a numéraire 𝐸. That is, if there is a pricing vector
𝑝 = (𝑝𝑇→𝐸 )𝑇 ∈T, then 𝑏 (𝑎) = 𝑝 · 𝑏 (𝑎, ·) =
∑
𝑇 ∈T 𝑝𝑇→𝐸𝑏 (𝑎,𝑇 ).
Definition 2.3. An ordering mechanism is a set of rules that de-
termines the order and inclusion of a set of transactions in a block.
More formally, let T be the set of all transactions, an ordering
mechanism is a map or : P≤ (T ) → P≤ (T ), where P≤ (T ) is the
set of all ordered subsets of T , such that or(𝑇 ) ⊆ 𝑇 for all 𝑇 ⊆ T .
Definition 2.4. A sequencer is an agent of a domain responsible
for maintaining the liveness and consistency through a set of ac-
tions. We distinguish four types of sequencers: dummy, dummy
Byzantine, rational and partially rational. A sequencer is dummy if
he follows the validator consensus protocol prt(D). A sequencer is
dummy Byzantine if they misbehave, but other nodes can detect his
misconduct. A sequencer is rational if it follows a set of valid actions
on the domainD to maximize its revenue (including deviating from
an ordering mechanism). Therefore, if a player misbehaves to max-
imize their payoff but can not be identified, punished, or slashed,
we say that is a rational player. A sequencer is partially rational
if they commit to using a specific valid ordering mechanism to
maximize its payoff. The commitment is public, but not necessarily
publicly verifiable. In general, the action of following the ordering
mechanism is not publicly verifiable (there are no validity proofs),
however, users and more sophisticated players can probabilistically
identify misbehavior.
On Ethereum (before the merge), miners are usually partially
rational. In general, miners run mev-geth2, which receives a block
transaction ordering of highest revenue from the Flashbots relayer.
Rational sequencers could take the Flashbots block and reorg to
maximize their own revenue. Nevertheless, miners do not deviate
from the mev-geth intended protocol
3
. For this reason, players
participating in the MEV extraction are not necessarily sequencers;
they take a sequence of actions to bias nodes to maximize their own
revenue. The set of actions that a sequencer can follow depends on
the domain and can include arbitrary actions. Studying the impact
that rational players and sequencers can have in a domain is helpful
2
Mev-geth is deprecated post-merge, currently validators are using MEV-boost.
3
However, recent miners are deviating from the Flashbots protocol to extract more
value. No formal or academic work has proved this yet. These are statements from
some Flashbots team members.

to bound the set of actions. For example, in selfish mining [17] the
set of actions to construct or publish the private chains.
From now on, we will assume that sequencers are partially ra-
tional. An example of an ordering mechanism is the default geth
client, which uses a greedy approximation algorithm to optimize
the blocks’ transaction fee revenue.
A sequencer receives a set of concurrent transactions tx1, ..., tx𝑛
with gas price𝑚1, ...,𝑚𝑛 and 𝑔1, ..., 𝑔𝑛 units of gas. If the sequencer
includes tx𝑖 , it obtains𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑖 in fees. Since the gas used per block
is restricted in every domain by some constant 𝐿, the sequencer
must choose a subset of transactions T such that
∑
𝑖:tx𝑖 ∈T 𝑔𝑖 ≤ 𝐿.
Then, a node that tries to maximize its revenues per block needs
to solve the following Knapsack optimization problem, which we
name Knapsack Extractable Value (KEV) problem:
max
𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑖
s.t.
𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖𝑔𝑖 ≤ 𝐿,
𝑥𝑖 ∈ {0, 1}.
We note by KEV(T ) the solutions’ revenue of the optimization
problem. Knapsack optimization problems [15] are NP-complete;
that is, no known polynomial time algorithm finds an optimal
solution. Thus, each sequencer usually chooses different algorithms
to approximate the optimal solution. For example, Parity nodes
order transactions by gas price𝑚 without considering the gas costs.
Another example is the Flashbots relayer, which uses a greedy
approximation algorithm [1], ordering transactions by the ratio of
miner payment and gas consumed (a natural extension of ordering
by gas price taking into account direct payments and more than
one transaction). However, the problem that the Flashbots relayer
tries to solve is quite different, since it does not include reverted
transactions or competing bundles. Moreover, we proved (see C)
that there are examples where this algorithm does not produce
a good approximation. In [2], the authors reformulate the block
production as a linear programming problem without taking into
account competing bundles. We will give more details after defining
bundles.
Now that we have settled up some ground definitions, we will
focus next on the formalization of the extraction of MEV opportu-
nities. To simplify the games, we will not consider the complete
MEV extraction per block, but separate the MEV opportunities into
“independent/concurrent” ones.
Definition 2.5. Let P be the set of all players. A set of transactions
T = {tx1, ..., tx𝑘 } and a state st induce an MEV opportunity in a
domain D to a player 𝑃 ∈ P if they can construct an ordered set of
transactions 𝐵 such that:
Δ𝑏 (𝑃 ; st ◦ 𝐵, st) := 𝑏 (𝑃, st ◦ 𝐵) − 𝑏 (𝑃, st) > 0, (1)
where 𝑏 is the balance of 𝑃 with the corresponding order. We call 𝐵
a profitable bundle or bundle. If 𝐵 consists of a unique transaction,
we say that 𝐵 is an MEV-transaction. Each bundle can contain ex-
tra metadata, such as sequencer timestamps, bundle hash, sender
ID, and gas price. For a given state st, each bundle incurs exe-
cution costs called gas costs. From the bundle metadata and the
domain state, the bundle execution incurs some payments, denoted
by pr(𝐵), to a sequencer or set of sequencers responsible for exe-
cuting the bundle.
Definition 2.6. A set of bundles 𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑛 are order-invariant valid
if for every permutation 𝜎 ∈ 𝑆𝑛 we have that the state transition
st −→ st ◦ 𝐵𝜎 (1) ◦ ... ◦ 𝐵𝜎 (𝑛) (2)
is a valid state transition and is invariant among all the permuta-
tions. A set of bundles 𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑛 compete in a state 𝑠 if for all 𝑖 and
𝑗 , st→ st ◦ 𝐵𝑖 ◦ 𝐵 𝑗 is not a valid state transition.
Definition 2.7. We say that a bundle 𝐵 is a partial extraction of a
bundle 𝐵′ if 𝐵 and 𝐵′ compete, and Δ𝑏 (𝑃, st ◦𝐵) < Δ𝑏 (𝑃 ′, st ◦𝐵′).
The Flashbots combinatorial auction (FBCA) allows players to
bid for bundles. The Flashbots allocation rule tries to solve the
block optimization problem with conflicting constraints. That is,
the block can not contain competing bundles (bundles that contain
same transactions or bundles that revert). So, the FBCA can be
modelled as the knapsack problem with a conflict graph𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸)
[11], where𝑉 is the set of bundles, and𝑢𝑣 ∈ 𝐸 if and only if bundles
𝑢 and 𝑣 compete. Flashbots use a greedy approximation algorithm,
leading to an auction mechanism similar to a first-price sealed
auction, since players can only observe winning bundles. That
is, the bundles are ordered by effective gas price (or average gas
price, see more details in the appendix A) and afterwards prune the
conflicting bundles. In case of symmetric gas efficiencies, the MEV
opportunity is sealed to the higher bidder and pays what they bid.
In general, this algorithm does not give the optimal solution (see
appendix C). It also allows searchers to check for relayer deviation
with just the executed block and the bundle sent by the searcher.
In other words, theoretically, searchers can privately monitor the
correct functioning of the relayer.
Now we are ready to define the local MEV for a player 𝑃 or
MEV𝑃 for short. The definition we provide is similar to the one pro-
vided in [3]. However, in [3], players have constraints on the state
transitions, but not on the set of bundles that they can construct.
Definition 2.8. Let D be a domain with state st, a player 𝑃 with
local mempool view T𝑀
𝑃
and a set of transactions T𝑃 that the player
𝑃 can construct. We denote by C𝑃 = T𝑀
𝑃
∪ T𝑃 to be the set of
reachable transactions. We define the local MEV of 𝑃 with state st
(MEV𝑃 (st)) as the solution to the following optimization problem
max
𝐵
Δ𝑏 (𝑃 ; st ◦ 𝐵, st)
s.t. 𝐵 ⊆ C𝑃 ,
st→ st ◦ 𝐵 is a valid state transition in D
Let argmev𝑃 (st) be the set of bundles that are a solution to the
optimization problem
4
. The constraints of reachable bundles is
subject to a player’s information, gas efficiency, budget, ability to
propose blocks, etc.
Observe that if all players have access to the same MEV op-
portunities and have access to all bundles, then this definition is
4
Observe that this definition fundamentally depends on the token balance. In the
presence of a unique token, MEV𝑃 is trivially defined. Nevertheless, in the presence of
multiple domains and tokens this definition is non-trivial. Moreover, in this definition,
we are assuming that all players value equally the tokens, assuming the existence of
some transferable utility. We leave a more general definition of local MEV for future
work.

equivalent to the one provided in [3]. If the mempool view is the
empty set, we will refer to the MEV as on top of block MEV, and we
will denote it by TMEV𝑃 .
Lemma 2.9. For a given player 𝑃 and a state st, if
𝐵 ∈ argmev𝑃 (st), then MEV𝑃 (st ◦ 𝐵) = 0.
Proof. Assume otherwise. Let st and 𝐵 ∈ argmev𝑃 (st) such
that MEV𝑃 (st) > 0. Then, there exist 𝐵′ such that Δ𝑏 (𝑃, st ◦ 𝐵 ◦
𝐵′, st ◦ 𝐵) > 0. Taking the bundle 𝐵′′ = 𝐵 ∪ 𝐵′, we have that
Δ(𝑃, st ◦ 𝐵′′, st) > MEV𝑃 (st), that is a contradiction. □
Definition 2.10. For a set of reachable bundles C, we define the
C-permissionless MEV ( MEV
C
) as the minimum local MEV that
can be extracted among players that have access to the bundles in
C. More formally,
MEV
C (st) := min
𝑃 s.t C⊆T𝑃
MEV𝑃 (st).
If for all players 𝑃 with reachable bundles C, MEV𝑃 (st) = 0, we
say that st is a null MEV state. We denote the set of null MEV states
as NS.
Remark: Note that this definition is an extension of the defini-
tion made in [16] when C𝐾 is the set of transactions that burns 𝐾
coins. In other words, MEV
C𝐾
permissionless is MEV that can be
extracted by players with at least 𝐾 coins. In this paper, we will
assume that a finite number of players are able to capture a spe-
cific MEV opportunity. In other words, we will fix a set of players
P = {𝑃1, ..., 𝑃𝑛}. For each 𝑃 ∈ P, we define st𝑖 as the state that
realizes the extraction MEV𝑃 . Then, we will assume that for each
player 𝑃 ∈ P, MEV𝑃 (st𝑗 ) = 0 for all 𝑃 ∈ P.
3 THE MEV STAGE GAME
In [5], the authors proposed a formalization of the game played by
different players in Ethereum to extract an MEV opportunity of
gross value ev ∈ R≥0. In the model, they assume that the ordering
mechanism is given by ordering by gas price and the game have
a structure of all-pay auction. That is, players pay for losing the
auction. In this section, we propose a generalization of this model.
In the model, we propose more general notions of ordering mech-
anisms, latency, external costs and values observed by players. In
other words, we will formalize the game played for extracting a
given MEV opportunity in a specific block in a specific Domain.
Afterwards, we will define the utility of the players as a function
of their balance and the notion of strategy. Finally, we introduce a
solution concept of the MEV stage game, the Sybil resistant Nash
equilibrium.
We model the MEV game as a sequential game among a set of
𝑛 searchers P = {𝑃1, ..., 𝑃𝑛} who can send bundles to obtain an
MEV opportunity. We will assume that all players compete for the
same MEV opportunity and have sufficient capital to extract it.
When a specific player wins the MEV opportunity, it reaches a null
MEV state for all players. In the following, we will provide a list of
points that will define the MEV stage game. This game will take
into account the latency of the players, the duration of the blocks,
the mechanism of transaction inclusion, and the costs of improving
software, node location, etc.
(1) Continuous time: Searchers act in continuous time rather
than discrete rounds (as in typical extensive-form games).
That is, at any moment in time, players can take an action
that, in our case study, will be sending a bundle.
(2) Local MEV: At time 𝑡 , each player 𝑃𝑖 finds an MEV oppor-
tunity of value 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) ∼ 𝑉𝑖 (𝑡), (in general, such that 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) ≥
𝑣𝑖 (𝑠)) for all 𝑡 ≥ 𝑠 , with {𝑉𝑖 (𝑡) : 𝑡 ≥ 0} being a family of
distributions. More specifically, for each time 𝑡 , the player
finds a bundle 𝐵 such that Δ𝑏 (st ◦ 𝐵, st) = 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡).
(3) Latency: Searchers can see each other’s actions, but not
immediately, due to the latency in the peer-to-peer network.
The latency is modeled by a directed weighted graph 𝐺 =
(𝐸,𝑉 ). Each searcher controls a set of nodes 𝑁𝑖 ⊆ 𝑉 . So, if
𝑃 𝑗 sends a bundle from a subset of peers 𝐿𝑗 ⊆ 𝑁 𝑗 at time 𝑡 𝑗 ,
𝑃𝑖 observe the bundle at time 𝑡 = 𝑡 𝑗 + 𝑑 (𝐿𝑗 , 𝑁𝑖 ), where 𝑑 is
the non-symmetric distance induced by the weight.
(4) Probabilistic auction duration: The auction terminates
at a randomly drawn time when a new block is mined. We
model the block interval as a positive random variable B.
(5) Competitors information: Players do not necessarily know
the number of competitors and their features. However, each
player estimates the number of competitors and their behav-
ior.
(6) Access to a public correlating device: Let (Ω, Pr) be a
probability space. All searchers observe the first drawn𝑤 ∈
[0, 1] of a uniform public random variable 𝑋 (a beacon or
the hash of the previous block). This can be used by players
to coordinate their actions.
(7) Auction Mechanism: Sequencers have a predefined algo-
rithm that inputs a set of bundles and outputs an order of
transactions for inclusion in a block. We will denote this
algorithm by the ordering mechanism. This ordering mecha-
nism and the characteristics of the MEV opportunity (Back-
running, Front-running, sandwich,...) determines the rev-
enue for each player. The ordering mechanism and the MEV
opportunity determinate an auction A = (x, pr), that is, a
pair of maps that take as inputs the set of bundles and a ran-
dom event and outputs a winner and the payment induced
per each player. More formally,
x : View𝑠 × Ω → {𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛 : 𝑥 · 1𝑇 ≤ 1}
pr : View𝑠 × Ω → R𝑛 .
where View𝑠 is the set of transactions seen by the sequencer
when constructing the block.
(8) External costs: Players can improve their mempool view,
reduce their latency, and improve their software to increase
their local MEV. The set of external actions that a player 𝑃𝑖
can take rely on a set of actions A𝑖 , and the costs of taking
those actions are modeled by a function 𝑐𝑖 : A𝑖 → R.
Definition 3.1. Given a set of playersP, a random positive variable
B, a gossip network graph 𝐺 and an auction mechanism, A =
(x, pr), an MEV game is G = (P,𝐺,B,A, (𝑐𝑖 )𝑖=1,..,𝑛). We say the
game is symmetric if all players share the same features. That is,
𝑉𝑖 = 𝑉𝑗 , 𝑐𝑖 = 𝑐 𝑗 for all 𝑖, 𝑗 , A are symmetric functions and 𝐺 is a
homogeneous graph.

Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV DeFi ’22, November 11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
The MEV game has a structure of sequential continuous game, and
therefore we can define utilities, strategies, and solution concepts
such as Nash equilibrium.
Definition 3.2. A strategy 𝑆𝑖 is a procedure for participating in
the MEV stage game and may be probabilistic. 𝑆𝑖 takes the fol-
lowing form, for a current time 𝑡 and a local view view𝑖 (𝑡) of the
player 𝑖: (𝑎, view′
𝑖
(𝑡)) ← 𝑆𝑖 (𝑡, view𝑖 (𝑡)). The output 𝑎 is the action
taken by 𝑃𝑖 and is bounded by domain constraints. The output
view′
𝑖
(𝑡) is the updated state, that is, view′
𝑖
(𝑡) = view𝑖 (𝑡) ∪ {𝑎}.
A strategy of a player 𝑖 is non-adaptive if it does not depend
on the local view view𝑖 (𝑡). More formally, for every 𝑡 and ev-
ery pair view𝑖 (𝑡), view′𝑖 (𝑡) ∈ View𝑖 (𝑡), it holds 𝑆𝑖 (𝑡, view𝑖 (𝑡)) =
𝑆𝑖 (𝑡, view′𝑖 (𝑡)).
Definition 3.3. Let 𝑆 = (𝑆1, ..., 𝑆𝑛) be a strategy tuple, then the
expected payoff of the player 𝑃𝑖 is
𝑢𝑖 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆−𝑖 ) := E[Δ𝑏𝑖 | 𝑆],
where 𝑆−𝑖 is an 𝑛 − 1 tuple without the 𝑖th coordinate. We denote
by S𝑖 the set of all strategies.
That is, 𝑢𝑖 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆−𝑖 ) is the expected payoff of player 𝑖 if they ex-
ecute the strategy 𝑆𝑖 , the other players execute the strategy 𝑆−𝑖
in a domain D. Notice that we assume players have a monotone
risk-neutral utility over the balances.
Definition 3.4. Let G be an MEV stage game, we say that a tuple
of strategies (𝑆1, ..., 𝑆𝑛) is a Nash equilibrium (NE) if for each player
𝑃𝑖
𝑢𝑖 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑢𝑖 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆−𝑖 ), for all strategies 𝑆𝑖 .
In other words, if players are taking the strategies (𝑆1, ..., 𝑆𝑛), none
of them have incentives to deviate unilaterally. We denote NE(G)
the set of all Nash equilibrium.
However, the notion of Nash equilibrium is not strong in per-
missionless environments. For example, the equilibrium of firms
competing in the Cournot price model [14] is weak against Sybil
attacks. Another example is the equilibrium constructed in the the-
orem of Flashboys 2.0 [5] that proves that exponential raise bidding
strategies with grim-trigger area a Nash equilibrium in the game
with two players. Nevertheless, one can prove that agents have
incentives to use Sybil attacks to maximize their payoff. For this
reason, we introduce a stronger notion of a solution concept for
MEV games that are resistant to Sybil attacks:
Definition 3.5. Let G be a symmetric
5
MEV game with 𝑛 players,
and let 𝜙 : N→
⊕∞
𝑖=1 S𝑖 be a strategy mapping. A Sybil resistant
Nash equilibrium is 𝜙 such that for all 𝑛 ∈ N, 𝜙 (𝑛) ∈
⊕𝑛
𝑖=1 S𝑖 ,
and 𝜙 (𝑛) is a Nash equilibrium, where for each 𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑛} and
𝑗 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑛 + 1} − {𝑖},
𝑢𝑖 (𝜙 (𝑛)𝑖 , 𝜙 (𝑛)−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑢𝑖 (𝜙 (𝑛 + 1)𝑖 , 𝜙 (𝑛 + 1)−𝑖 )
+ 𝑢 𝑗 (𝜙 (𝑛 + 1) 𝑗 , 𝜙 (𝑛 + 1)− 𝑗 ).
The notion of Sybil resistance is important in permissionless
pseudo-anonymous environments such as blockchains. Players
have the ability to generate additional addresses to take more profits
from cooperative strategies. In future work, we will prove that
5
This definition can be extended to non-symmetric games, but we will leave it for
future work.
Sybil resistant cooperative Nash equilibrium exist in the priority
gas auction in the non-repeated games, and the existence of Sybil
resistant equilibrium in games with private mempools.
3.1 Example: Priority gas auction (PGA)
In this section, we will give an example of MEV game, a general-
ization of the priority gas auction given in [5]. Differently than [5],
in this model, we not assume that the reverted transactions have
a constant cost and the players do not share latency and cost pa-
rameters. More precisely, in this game, the transactions are ordered
by gas price𝑚. For a player 𝑃𝑖 , a bundle incurs gas costs 𝑔𝑖 ∈ R≥0
if it extracts the MEV opportunity, and 𝛾𝑖 ∈ R≥0 otherwise (other
player wins the MEV opportunity and the bundle reverts). That
is, if a player 𝑃𝑖 bids𝑚𝑖 , the player loses𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑖 in case of winning
the MEV opportunity, and𝑚𝑖𝛾𝑖 otherwise. We will assume that all
searchers find the MEV opportunity at the beginning of the auction
and that the first bundle executed in the block will extract the MEV
opportunity. That is, 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) = ev for all 𝑡 ≥ 0. So, the game induces
the following auction mechanism:
x𝑖 (𝑚1, ...,𝑚𝑛) =
{
1, if𝑚𝑖 > max𝑗≠𝑖 {𝑚 𝑗 }
0, otherwise
pr(𝑚1, ...,𝑚𝑛) =
{
𝑔𝑖𝑚𝑖 , if𝑚𝑖 > max𝑗≠𝑖 {𝑚 𝑗 }
𝛾𝑖𝑚𝑖 , otherwise
So, the total profits of player 𝑖 is𝑢𝑖 = evx𝑖 (𝑚1, ...,𝑚𝑛)−pr𝑖 (𝑚1, ...,𝑚𝑟 ).
We let 𝐵𝑖 = (𝑡𝑖 ,𝑚𝑖 ; 𝑖) denote a MEV profitable bundle of a searcher
𝑖 . Here 𝑡𝑖 is the time at which the bid is placed,𝑚𝑖 is the gas price,
and 𝑖 is the identity of the bidder. We will assume that the gossip
network has a complete graph structure. That is, a player 𝑗 , sees a
bundle 𝐵 = (𝑡,𝑚; 𝑖) at time 𝑡𝑖 + Δ 𝑗 . We denote by view𝑖 (𝑡) the set
of all bundles seen by the searcher 𝑖 at time 𝑡 (including their own
bundle) and the state of the auction (active or finished). We denote
by View𝑖 (𝑡) the set of all possible views at time 𝑡 for a searcher 𝑖 .
The following theorem states that, a wide ranges of outcomes
are feasible in the PGA auction. In general, this Nash equilibrium
points induce to minimal revenue to the sequencer and share the
profits among the searchers.
Theorem 3.6 (PGA Folks’ theorem). LetD be a PoW domain with
B ∼ Exp(_). Let,
𝐹 = {(𝑥1, ..., 𝑥𝑛) : 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [0, ev − 𝑔𝑖𝑚],
𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖
ev − 𝑔𝑖𝑚
≤ 1},
where𝑚 = ev(1− 𝑒−_Δmin )/(𝑔min (1− 𝑒−_Δmin ) +𝛾min𝑒
−_Δmin ) and
𝛾min = min{𝛾𝑖 }. Then, given a suitable correlating device 𝐷 , for
any payoff vector 𝒗 ∈ 𝐹 there exists a correlated Nash equilibrium
6 (𝑆1, ..., 𝑆𝑛) such that 𝒖 = (𝑢1 (𝑆1, 𝑆−1), ..., 𝑢𝑛 (𝑆𝑛, 𝑆−𝑛)) = 𝒗. The
strategies used by the players consists of choosing a uniform cor-
relating device in {1, ..., 𝑛}. The player 𝑖 bids if 𝐷 = 𝑖 . If a player
𝑗 ≠ 𝑖 deviates and bids when 𝐷 ≠ 𝑗 , then other players execute a
grim-trigger, leading to losses to all players.

The set of Nash equilibrium are not Sybil resistant. In future work, we will propose
a general transformation that transforms non-Sybil resistant equilibrium in Sybil
resistant equilibrium in sequential games.

4 PRICE OF MEV
MEV games have an important impact on users, network conges-
tion, computation overload, and blockchain liveness. On one hand,
some MEV opportunities arise from value extracted from users. On
the other hand, in general, MEV games induce an inefficient extrac-
tion of MEV opportunities, leading to network congestion (e.g. P2P
network load), and chain congestion (e.g. block-space usage). In this
paper, we will not take into account the negative externalities of
MEV on individual users (for example, sandwich attacks and oracle
manipulation), but rather the negative externalities that impact the
consensus protocol, liveness, chain quality, stake distribution, etc.
Suppose there is an MEV opportunity on a state st, with a set of 𝑛
players that compete to extract it, sending bundles 𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 . Then,
a sequencer, using the ordering mechanism or, outputs a block (this
order mechanism does not necessarily respect the internal order of
the bundles). In this setting, we define the block space cost as the
gas cost of executing the block built by the ordering mechanism
using the bundles, more formally
𝐶 (𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 ; st) = gasUsed
(
st ◦ or(∪𝑘𝑖=1𝐵𝑖 )
)
. (3)
We naturally extend the function of cost over strategies by taking
the outcome (or the expected outcomes in case of mixed strategies)
of the strategies (the broadcasted bundles). Clearly, ex-post it is
trivial to compute the gas cost. However, ex-ante, estimating the
gas costs induced by the MEV game is much more complex due to
the non-commutative nature of execution costs. Also, other cost
functions can be very relevant in some domains. Different MEV
games can induce other types of negative externalities, such as
wasted resources induced by computation costs
7
or centralization
effects.
In general, self-interested behaviour by strategic players leads
to an inefficient result, an outcome that could be improved upon
given centralized control over everyone’s action [13]. Nevertheless,
imposing such control can be costly, infeasible or undesirable (due
to trust assumptions). This motivates the search for conditions
and mechanisms in which decentralized optimization by strategic
agents is guaranteed to produce a near-optimal outcome. The price
of anarchy (PoA) [12] is a measure that quantifies how far is the
worst Nash equilibrium (in the sense of social cost) with respect
to any optimal configuration that minimizes the social cost. More
formally, given a cost function 𝐶 and the set of Nash equilibrium
𝑁𝐸, the price of anarchy is defined as:
PoA =
max𝑆∈𝑁𝐸 𝐶 (𝑆)
min𝑆 𝐶 (𝑆)
.
Different examples of the study of the price of anarchy can be seen
in [4, 12, 13]. However, the price of anarchy in the MEV game is,
in general, not well-defined. For example, assume that two players
are competing for extracting the same arbitrage opportunity. Then,
as we will see, the block space cost of extracting the arbitrage
opportunity will be the sum of gas used by executing both searchers’
transactions. However, the minimal cost of the game is zero, since
not extracting theMEV opportunity is a feasible outcome. Therefore,
the ratio is not defined, leaving an inconsistent definition of the

price of anarchy in the MEV game. In the following, we propose a
small adjustment to have a well-defined price of anarchy in theMEV
game, which we denote as the Price of MEV. This measure tracks
the social costs induced by the competition among individually
rational agents for MEV extraction in a particular MEV game. More
precisely, the Price of MEV is a family of measures parametrized by
the social cost functions. This family of measurements can be useful
to compare the negative externalities and trade-offs of different
MEV games. Similar to the price of anarchy definition, the price
of MEV of game G with social cost 𝐶 is the ratio of the worst
Nash equilibrium with respect to the extraction made by the most
efficient player in an order-free consensus protocol blockchain.
Definition 4.1. Given a cost function 𝐶 , the set of Sybil resistant
Nash equilibrium SNE(G), and the set of actions that induce a null
MEV state NS, we define the price of MEV as:
PoMEV(G, 𝑛) =
max𝑆∈𝑆𝑁𝐸 (G) 𝐶 (𝑆)
min𝑆∈NS𝐶 (𝑆)
,
where min𝑎∈NS𝐶 (𝑎) is the minimum cost taken by extracting the
MEV opportunity.
We argue that a more efficient mechanism to extract MEV op-
portunities (low Price of MEV) can have an important impact on
blockchain stability, users utility, and consensus protocol
8
. In the
case where the cost function is defined over pure strategies, we can
extend the definition naturally over the mixed strategies, taking
the expectancy of the outcomes.
5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTUREWORK
In this work, we proposed measures to formally study the Nash
equilibrium and negative externalities of different ordering mecha-
nisms. We think that this is import due to the future changes on
Ethereum mainnet about Proposer-Builder separation and MEV-
boost [7]. We leave for future work to study and compute the price
of MEV of popular proposed ordering mechanisms. Also, in the
future we will study the negative externalities of zero-sum MEV
opportunities such as sandwich attacks, time bandit attacks, eclipse
attacks, draining bot attacks
9
, and censorship attacks. We conjec-
ture that a domain with suboptimal block-space market design will
lead to more block-space misuse (high price of MEV), raising the
transactions fees of the underlying domain. The higher transactions
fees will increase the direct payments of the miner (another form
of MEV) and the market inefficiencies. This market inefficient will
imply inefficient price discover, creating more internal and cross
chain MEV opportunities. We call this effect the Circular forces of
MEV 1.

A EXAMPLES OF ORDERING MECHANISMS
For the sake of completeness, we will provide a list of examples of
ordering mechanisms. They are induced in different domain and
consensus protocol designs.
• Priority gas orderingmechanism : Sequencers try to solve
the KEV by using the greedy approximation algorithm that
consists of ordering the transactions by gas price. In this
case, if a player is trying to capture an MEV opportunity, it
must monitor the mempool and choose an optimal gas price
𝑚. If a player is trying to front-run a transaction tx, with gas
price𝑚, it is enough to outbid it with𝑚 + [. In this setting,
if the gas cost of exploiting this MEV opportunity is 𝑔, the
block-space price of MEV of the uni-agent game is 1.
• Flashbots mechanism: Searchers send bundles to the re-
layer through a private channel. The Flashbots relayer tries
to build the block with the highest profits among all the

blocks that can be constructed using the transactions in the
public mempool and the Flashbots mempool of bundles. But
the bundles have a number of allocation constraints that the
Flashbots relayer must account for [16]. In order to build the
block with the highest profit, Flashbots (to our knowledge)
uses a greedy approximation algorithm. As described in the
Flashbots documentation, a bundle 𝐵 is ordered by effective
gas price / bundle score, which is defined as,
𝑠𝑐 (𝐵) :=
Δ𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 +
∑
𝑡𝑥∈𝐵\TX 𝑔(𝑡𝑥)𝑚(𝑡𝑥)∑
𝑡𝑥∈𝐵 𝑔(𝑡𝑥)
where Δ𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 denotes the direct payment to the miner,
TX is the set of mempool transactions, 𝑔(𝑡𝑥) is the gas used
by 𝑡𝑥 and𝑚(𝑡𝑥) is the gas price of 𝑡𝑥 .
• Random ordering mechanism: The transactions included
in the next block and the order of transaction execution are
probabilistic with a uniform distribution.
• First input first output mechanism: The transactions are
ordered by the sequencer local’s timestamps or by a pseudo-
global timestamp such as the one mentioned in [8]. In this
sense, players with better geolocation and propagation algo-
rithms will win the MEV game. However, in decentralized
systems, this will depend on the leader geolocation that will
change randomly per round.
• Dictatorship/Permissioned mechanism: The sequencer
has its own arbitrary ordering rule, prioritizing transactions
of a fixed set of addresses. In this setting, players do not have
a lot of freedom to interact or win the MEV opportunity.
In other words, the sequencer will censor other players’
transactions to prioritize its own extraction. Moreover, this
potentially will induce inefficient market prices. However,
the block-space price of anarchy is minimized since just one
player is extracting it. This rule also models the situation
where the miner captures the MEV opportunity, prioritizing
its own profitable bundles.
• Metadata mechanism: Let ({0, 1}𝑛, ≤) be a total ordered
set. Transactions and bundles can add a parameter nonce,
giving them an associated hash identification. Then the bun-
dles and transactions are ordered by hashes. For example, if a
transaction tx with nonce tries to extract a back-running ar-
bitrage opportunity, then a player will try to produce a trans-
action that extracts the opportunity nonce nonce’ < nonce.

B BOT EXAMPLE
Before the pull request [6], transactions with the same gas price
were randomly ordered, creating incentives for searchers to spam
transactions to capture an MEV opportunity. In the following, we
will show how a particular MEV bot that captured back running
opportunities, was responsible for consuming unnecessary block
space to increase its expected revenue. A lot of examples can be seen
using tools such as mev-inspect-py. Moreover, we could lower
bound the estimated block space price of MEV by ≈ 7.

C FLASHBOTS V0.6 COUNTER-EXAMPLE
Let FBR(𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑛) be the revenue using the Flashbots greedy ap-
proximation algorithm. Let OTP(𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑛) be the maximal revenue
of the Flashbots combinatorial problem.
Claim: The Flashbots combinatorial auction is not optimal. More
specifically,
inf{ FBR(𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 )
OPT(𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 )
: for 𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 bundles} ≤ 1
⌊ 𝐿
𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛
⌋ − 1
,
where 𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the minimal gas consumed by competing bundles
and 𝐿 is the gas limit of a block.
Proof: Let 𝐵1, ..., 𝐵𝑘 all the bundles such that, 𝐵1 compete with
𝐵𝑖 for all 𝑖 ≠ 1 and 𝐵𝑖 , 𝐵 𝑗 are pairwise non-competing bundles.
Moreover, assume that 𝐵1 has gas costs 𝐿/𝑘 and effective gas bid
𝑚 + Y for Y > 0 and all the other bundles have gas bid 𝑚. Then,
the Flashbots algorithm outputs 𝐵 = {𝐵1}, leaving to a sequencers’
revenue of 𝑚 + Y. On the other hand, the optimal valid block is
𝐵 = {𝐵2, ..., 𝐵𝑘 } with𝑚(𝑘 − 1) revenue. The result follows using
bundles with gas cost 𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 .
