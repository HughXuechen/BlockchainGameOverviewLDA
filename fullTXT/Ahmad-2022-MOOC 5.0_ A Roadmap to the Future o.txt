Abstract: Industry 4.0 has created a whole new world for us to explore, and its effects can be seen
in every facet of our lives, especially in the workplace where it calls for technology-driven employ-
ment. There is a growing need to teach individuals and assist them in transitioning to longer-term
employment prospects to execute Industry 4.0 effectively. Although MOOCs revolutionized the way
learners study, it is critical to investigate teaching techniques using Education 4.0 at this time. This
article explores how the technologies of Industry 4.0 can be incorporated into MOOCs. This paper
proposes MOOCs 5.0, whose features include better universal access, better learner engagement,
adaptive learning, greater collaboration, security, and curiosity, which is being developed using
Industry 4.0 technologies of the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Artificial Intelli-
gence/Machine Learning, Blockchain, Gamification Technologies, and the Metaverse and would
incorporate the zones of ethics and humanism, while at the same time providing learners with a
richer and more individualized experience.

1. Introduction
Humans have been learning and adapting to new environments since the dawn of
civilization. This trend has been going on for thousands of years in many aspects of
human existence, but the introduction of information technology accelerated the process
of learning and adaptation rapidly [1,2]. Education not only prepares individuals with
better values to live within society but at the same time assists them to procure the abilities
and skills required for sustainable development. The United Nations 2030 agenda has
acknowledged education as a critical component of sustainable development. One of the
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is to improve education and has been
stated as: “Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4): Quality Education—Ensure inclusive
and equitable Quality Education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” [3]
and “Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG9) of Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure”.
Interestingly, the education structure of the 21st century has transformed drastically. It
is difficult to believe how drastically different the situation was only a few years back since
the world we live in is changing so quickly and unpredictably. In the last few decades, the
Internet and how people use it have also undergone significant transformations. One of
the major areas where this transformation can be seen is in the teaching–learning process.
Technology, pedagogy, implementation strategies, and institutional frameworks can all be
used to implement flexible learning in higher education [4]. Imparting education through
classroom teaching is now challenged by the growing popularity of the Internet [5,6].
One of the best ways of flexible learning is through Massive Open Online Courses, also
known as MOOCs. Ever since it began in 2008, it has become the primary display for open

years [7]. MOOCs have grown in popularity not only in the academic world but also in the
business sector for a variety of reasons, including flexibility and cost effectiveness [8]. While
MOOCs provide educational data on a new level, their high dropout rates have concerned
many instructors [9]. With Online Education being the new normal after the COVID-19
pandemic, enrolment in MOOCs has gained tremendous momentum. The higher education
system must alter its environment, instructional methods, and the roles of instructors and
learners, in light of Industry 4.0′s technological breakthroughs [10]. Changes are inevitable
and expected to occur in all facets of education, and MOOCs too will transform. It will
be challenging for instructors to adapt to these cutting-edge Industry 4.0 technologies for
creating MOOCs adhering to the needs of learners from varied social, economic, and, most
importantly, cultural backgrounds.

3. Overview of Industry 5.0 and Education 5.0
The effect of technology in today’s fast-changing world is not confined to modes of
transportation and communication; the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” has brought us
a new wave of change in all fields. The digital revolution is significantly changing how
people live and work [11]. The “Fifth Industrial Revolution”, branded as Industry 5.0,
promises to alter the way we develop products, increasing productivity and competitive
advantage. While Industry 4.0 aspired to develop future “Smart Factories” by combining
physical, digital, and virtual environments using cyber-physical systems, in Industry 5.0,
intelligent machines will act as collaborators rather than opponents since they will be
integrated with human brains [12]. Industry 5.0 offers a vision of the business that goes
beyond the narrow focus on production and efficiency and strengthens the function and
value of the industry in society [13]. Figure 3 illustrates all five industrial revolutions.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 4 of 17
Figure 3. Industrial Revolutions.
“Industry 4.0” developments are having a wide range of organizational repercussions,
not simply technological ones [14]. The first and foremost challenge of “Industry 4.0” is
that there is a greater need for highly skilled employees [15,16]. Over the next five years,
technology-driven job creation is likely to outnumber job loss. There is a growing sense
of urgency to assist people in transitioning to more long-term employment prospects [17].
Industry 4.0 is said to be driven by technology, whereas Industry 5.0 is driven by values [18];
as a result, the current state of industry inevitably raises concerns in this period of expo-
nential technological advancement, such as the appropriateness of the current educational
system in light of Industry 5.0′s requirements, design of the new educational paradigm,
components in Education 5.0, etc.
Education has progressed from ‘going to university’ of Education 1.0 to Internet-
based learning of Education 2.0, proceeding towards knowledge-based education of
Education 3.0, and finally to innovation-based education in Education 4.0 [19]. Technology
infiltrations into education, such as the use of smartphones, online testing, Artificial Intel-
ligence, and Big Data, are all part of Education 4.0 [20]. Education 5.0 moves beyond the
creation and use of technology and into the spheres of humanism and ethics [21]. The term
“Education 4.0” and “Education 5.0” has gained popularity among educators all across the
world, and emphasizes adapting to the changes, and for institutions of higher learning, this
involves knowing what is expected of their incoming graduates. Figure 4 illustrates the
progression of education.
Figure 4. Progression of Education.
The technologies of Industry 4.0 are already influencing our daily lives. Universities
and colleges should prepare for the significant shift of incorporating technology-driven
designs into the curriculum with the support of educationists and other visionaries. It is
heartening to learn that the education system is integrating the usage of Cyber System
technologies in learning under the mantra Education 4.0 [22,23]. At this juncture, it is
vital to explore teaching methodologies in the context of the technical advancements of
Industry 4.0 as the future years will test our ability to redesign learning for the learners
of today’s digital generation [24,25]. MOOCs also require improvements on the parts of
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 5 of 17
both learners and instructors to adapt to the new paradigms of learning. This research
paper proposes MOOCs 5.0, which uses the advanced technologies of Industry 5.0 and
possess features, viz., better universal access, better learner engagement, adaptive learning,
greater collaboration, security, and curiosity. The features are discussed in Section 6 and
are depicted in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Features of MOOCs 5.0.
4. Technology Intervention in MOOCs
The social revolution has been sparked by Industry 5.0. technologies such as the
Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Machine
Learning, Block Chain, Robotics, Digital Twin, Gamification Technologies, Virtual reality
(VR)/Augmented reality (AR), and the Metaverse. It is anticipated that technology will
have advanced to the point of total autonomy by 2050 [16]. Future MOOCs will undergo a
significant change in terms of education due to these technological improvements.
4.1. IoT in MOOCs
Kevin Ashton, a British technologist, coined the phrase “Internet of Things” (IoT) [26]
to describe a way for people and items to be connected across a network. These are now
widely utilized and well liked in a variety of industries, including smart homes, smart cities,
wearable technology, and industrial equipment. IoT envisions a bright future for such
an Internet where machine–machine communication will predominate over the present
models of human–human or human–device connection [27]. Future intelligent virtual
products will be created from real-world objects with the expansion of the Internet of
Things [28]. IoT can be embedded in online higher education with the help of a cutting-
edge AI-assisted system that considers environmental data and embedded biosensor data
to estimate learners’ progress, wellness, and health [29]; this will not only improve e-
learning platforms but will improve learning outcomes for professions and will increase
completion but also reduce expenses [30]. A literature review suggests that researchers
concentrated on several topics, a few of these included IoT in mobile learning [31], blending
lab projects with IoT-based learning frameworks for Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics (STEM) learners [32], personalized instruction for students through IoT
data collection [33], etc. All students will profit from the inclusion of IoT in MOOCs since
there will be improved communication and individualized learning, not to mention the
unique advantages for those with impairments. Table 1 summarizes the articles of IoT
implementation for MOOCs.

4.2. Cloud Computing in MOOCs
In recent years, the shift to Cloud Computing has picked up pace [34]. Business
owners are turning over control of their assets, including critical systems, to platforms
that cloud service providers offer and operate [35]. Cloud Computing is quickly replacing
traditional computer paradigms in all facets of life including education; some of the
successful examples of this paradigm in the education field are Learning management
systems (LMS), MOOCs, and Podcasts [36]. They all use the Internet to make education
perpetually accessible to a limitless number of learners. In this paradigm, two main cloud
service models are employed, which are infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and software as
a service (SaaS). All the major MOOC providers employ cloud services and resources to
promote quality teaching and learning internationally [37]. As the Cloud Computing trends
make it abundantly evident that it will be crucial to IT in the upcoming years [38], MOOCs
will witness better and more affordable services in the near future. Table 2 summarizes the
articles of Cloud Computing in Online Education/MOOCs.

4.3. Big Data in MOOCs
MOOCs produce a significant amount of heterogeneous educational data [39] and
provide several chances to study a variety of issues connected to teaching design and
learner outcomes [40]. Finding a way to extract knowledge from the extraordinarily
rich datasets being produced and turn it into information that can be used by students,
instructors, and the general public is the key problem in Big-Data-intensive research and
learning analytics [41]. According to a literature study, researchers investigated a variety of
MOOC categories using Big Data, among which included diverse Big Data of MOOC [42],
identification of MOOC dropout learners [43,44], forecasting MOOC learners’ potential
grades [45], MOOC data analytics [46], learning analytics [47], demand for MOOC [48],

4.4. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in MOOCs
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have made considerable strides
in recent years, and they now represent an emergent technology that will transform how
people live. The use of AI/ML in education is expanding quickly to enhance the caliber of
teaching and learning. According to the Horizon Report’s Higher Education Edition from
2017, Artificial Intelligence will be applied in higher education by 2022 [54]. MOOCs have
a strong probability of using AI/ML by an analysis of the extensive MOOC dataset [55].
AI/ML may employ data analytics to enhance teaching and learning methods. Large
datasets of MOOCs may be used to train Machine Learning algorithms so they can learn
from them and provide predictions or suggestions on how to learn something new or
improve teaching. The MOOC dropout prediction studies using AI/ML have been dis-
cussed by several authors [56–59]. While notable researchers focused on many different
subjects, some of these included learner clickstream analyses [60,61], satisfaction among
the learners [62,63], time-based metrics of learner interactions and evaluations [64], the
usage of MOOC datasets for the K-means method [65], using Machine Learning techniques
to sort and categorize MOOC learners [66], learners’ emotional tendencies [67], MOOC
learning behaviors [68], an intelligent investigation [69], Convolutional neural networks
(CNN) for measuring the levels of learner engagement through webcam [70], etc. Table 4

4.5. Blockchain Technology in MOOC
Blockchain technology has demonstrated remarkable application opportunities since
its beginnings and has been used in numerous sectors; because of its strengthening security
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 8 of 17
feature, it may be used to construct many Blockchain systems [71,72]. Blockchain technol-
ogy may be implemented at higher education institutions to enhance teaching strategies,
provide better learning platforms, improve recordkeeping, and enhance student involve-
ment and motivation [73]. The literature suggests that the rapid advancement of Blockchain
technology will have a positive impact on the creation of MOOC communication platforms
resulting in the advancement of higher education [74]. MOOCs’ completion records are
kept in Electronic Learning Records (ELRs), which are often maintained in a cloud data
center, which are crucial for learners since they provide solid proof of the learning process.
However, the security and Privacy of ELRs cannot be ensured with third-party storage.
As a result, a Blockchain-based solution for the safe storing and distribution of ELRs in
MOOC learning systems can be implemented [75]. A Blockchain system that keeps track of
every detail of every transaction will allow the academic institution that awards credentials
to confirm that learning actually happened and that knowledge, competencies, and skills
were accurately assessed [76]. Melanie Swan suggested using Blockchain to encode open
badges for MOOCs [77]. Table 5 summarizes the articles of Blockchain Technology in
Online Education/MOOCs.

4.6. Digital Twin in MOOCs
Though highly creative and needing a broad framework of several technologies, the
Digital Twin notion is still not at the cutting edge [78]. The qualities of a Digital Twin
include a virtual and actual symbiosis, high levels of simulation, real-time contact, and
deep understanding, among others. The trend of its use is moving from the industrial to
the educational sectors [79]. Interesting scientific material has begun to stream on topics
such as smart factory Digital Twin technology in education [80], Digital Twin Campus [81],
Ontology [82], etc. For many IT applications in Industry 5.0, the concept of the “digital
twin for everything” seems to be a relevant one [83]. However, the use of Digital Twin
(DT) in education is still in its infancy when compared to that of DT in the industrial sector.

4.7. Gamification Technologies in MOOCs
Gamification is the application of components often prevalent in games, such as plot,
feedback, rewards systems, conflict, collaboration, competition, defined objectives and
rules, levels, trial-and-error, enjoyment, engagement, and interactivity [84], and it is often
used to fix problems and enhance learning [85]. The primary goal of Gamification, for
non-gaming objectives in real-world environments, is to increase human motivation and
performance concerning a particular task [86]. In the beginning, Gamification techniques
were used in marketing campaigns and web applications to encourage, involve, and retain
customers [87].
With the shifting paradigm in education, Gamification has also found use in the
teaching–learning process. Concept acquisition and awareness were considerably en-
hanced when using information and communication technologies (ICT) along with Gamifi-
cation [88]. It applies the foundational principle of learning by doing, which encourages
students to acquire knowledge and make discoveries about many topics via independent
experimentation. There is limited acceptance of serious games in higher education; for
example, higher education institutions in Portugal use only around 20% of the Gamification
techniques [89]. Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are a growing trend, but their
extremely low completion rates provide difficulty. Finding innovative strategies to inspire
learners and persuade them to finish the course is vital because a significant number of
learners drop out of the MOOC [90]. Gamification-based methodology for motivating
MOOC learners to complete the course can be a better strategy [91–94]. Gamification
design for MOOCs should incorporate both social and individual components, based on
the implementation goal, social presence, social impact, and flow theory [95]. Studies have
revealed that MOOC Gamification has been implemented in a few cases and even if the
outcomes on motivation and learning are positive, there are still prospects for scholarly
publishing [96]. Table 7 summarizes the articles of Gamification Technologies in Online
Education/MOOCs.

4.8. Metaverse in MOOCs
The Metaverse is a perpetual multi-user habitat that unifies the actual world with
digital virtual elements [97]. Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), as well as
mixed reality (MR), are some of the most important elements of the Metaverse since they
successfully give users a 3D immersive virtual experience [98], although Virtual reality
(VR)/Augmented reality (AR) is now employed extensively across many industries. As
MOOCs need personalization and communication for traditionalist means of material in-
troduction (fixed visual, sound, and contents) to provide the learners with a more engaging
learning experience [99], the Metaverse and its components provide excellent chances to
raise educational standards by developing fresh approaches and strategies. Few Metaverse
MOOCs have been implemented where learners confirmed their applicability and func-
tioning both within and outside of the classroom [100] and some have been proposed [101];
however, it will take time, and studies presently show that there is a research gap in
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 10 of 17

5. MOOC 5.0
For a substantial portion of the world’s population, MOOCs provide not only learning
opportunities but access to world-class educators and researchers from top-tier educational
institutions [103]. Some literature categorizes MOOCs in various ways; however, there does
not appear to be agreement on the best way to do so. It has been classified as MOOC 2.0. on
the concepts of collaboration among other online learners [104,105], credit credentials [106],
and personal learning goals [107], as MOOC 3.0 is based on MOOC incorporation into
traditional academic programs and credit recognition [108]. Otto Scharmer [109] suggests
that MOOCs have evolved from instructor-centric one-to-many to learner-centric many-to-
one personalized education. Figure 6 explains all four levels of evolution of MOOCs. The
theory was based on a pilot MOOC, where for evolution from MOOC 1.0 to MOOC 4.0,
there has effectively been a change in the conversational level at which the learning takes
place, which evolves from downloading MOOC 1.0 to a two-way interaction in MOOC 2.0,
to a multi-lateral dialogue in MOOC 3.0 before finally being anchored in level 4 as collective
creativity in MOOC 4.0 because conversation is experienced as a co-creative.
Figure 6. Evolution of MOOCs based on Otto Scharmer’s classification [109].
As learners will have access to more technology in the future, humanized online
courses that cater to each learner’s unique requirements will be more and more essen-
tial [110]. This is where MOOC, which is being developed using Industry 5.0 technology
and also examines the areas of ethics and humanism, may be extendedly classified, giv-
ing it the name MOOC 5.0. The focus of MOOC 5.0 teaching may be on each learner’s
interpretation and way of thinking, as well as providing them with personalized learning
recommendations that have humanism and ethics. The concept is shown in Figure 7.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 11 of 17
Figure 7. MOOCs 5.0.
6. Discussions and Recommendations
New economic development will be sparked by Industry 5.0 technologies. How
effectively these technologies are implemented into education will determine how far
humanity develops in the future. The fusion of cutting-edge technology and learning
systems can more accurately simulate the dynamics of high-level learning. Industry 5.0
technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data, Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, Blockchain technology, Digital Twins, Gamification
Technologies, and the Metaverse, will significantly change MOOCs. Within a few years, the
developing technologies of Industry 5.0 are projected to be a typical feature in MOOCs 5.0.
Figure 8 depicts and highlights the major recommendations.
The highlights of the major recommendations for moving forward with SDG4 of
Quality Education and SDG9 of Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure to achieve the
SDGs are:
• MOOC with better universal access: Learners, especially those in rural areas or
who would typically have limited access to formal education, will soon have a better
experience with MOOCs 5.0 as a result of the widespread availability of mobile devices,
next-generation networks such as 5G, better Cloud Computing services [36–38], and
IoT devices [33]. A boost for MOOCs 5.0 will come from the development of a mobile
learning platform that prioritizes providing a reliable, inexpensive, WiFi-detection
device and user-friendly mobile applications, which work even in rural areas [31].
• MOOC with better learner engagement: The creation of affordable intelligent edge
computing-enabled IoT devices will use the learner system’s camera, clicks, and
biosensor data to estimate the learning levels and evaluate their academic progress [29].
The tool would save the data on the learners’ computer, cutting down on bandwidth
usage and accelerating response time. A better Cloud Computing service [36–38] with
an IoT device with an intelligent edge computing capability continuously monitors the
student’s metrics, can enter alert mode or alarm mode based on conditions, and would
provide feedback on the learners’ engagement to both the learner and the instructor.
• MOOC with adaptive learning: The most prominent problem of MOOCs all over
the world is the dropout problem. As discussed in this paper, AI/ML and Big-Data-
based systems for assessing learner development and its impact on learning progress
are already in place [44,56–59]. The research on design and development has to be
expanded by the scholars by using in-built learning analytics capabilities with AI/ML
and Big Data [47] on a MOOCs 5.0 platform, which would process data about the
Sustainability 2022, 14, 11199 12 of 17
learning activities of learners, measure the effectiveness of teaching methods and
students’ engagement to identify at-risk students. The system can predict and alert
the learners and course coordinators about potential dropouts. As a consequence,
the option of adaptive learning will be made available, which modifies the pace and
substance of learning to suit the needs of each learner.
• MOOC with greater collaboration: with a combination of Cloud Computing [36–38],
Big Data, AI/ML [56–59], Gamification [88–95], and the Metaverse [99] in the background
with MOOCs 5.0, there would be room for novel innovations in collaborative learning.
• MOOC with security: MOOCs 5.0 will offer credentials of the learners through Elec-
tronic Learning Records (ELRs) through Blockchain technology [75], which might then
be shared in a secure format with potential employers too. Other research areas of
Blockchain could be better MOOC communication platforms, and encode open badges
for MOOCs to motivate learners [77].
• MOOC with curiosity: Cloud Computing [36–38], Big Data [42–53], AI/ML [56–59],
the Metaverse [99], and integrated Gamification [88–95], with features such as points,
badges, rewards, and leader boards to encourage learners to be more engaged, would
provide a platform that will create interest in the subject matter for the learners in
MOOCs 5.0. In the future, researchers will need to expand their research into 3D
interface design and educational video games.

7. Conclusions
The Sustainable Development Goals, SDG4 of Quality Education, and SDG9 of In-
dustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure can be achieved with the use of new educational
technologies in a sustainable manner. Based upon this motivation, this study discussed the
implementation of Industry 5.0. technologies, viz., IoT, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Arti-
ficial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Blockchain Technology, Digital Twin, Gamification
Technologies, and the Metaverse in MOOCs. From the above analysis, this study concludes
that the adaptation of these technologies in education will support innovative pedagogies,
guaranteeing comprehensive and equitable Quality Education and encouraging possibili-
ties for lifelong learning for everyone. There is a lot of future scopes in integrating emerging
technologies in MOOCs. Further research should be conducted to make MOOC 5.0 a reality.
Every MOOC 5.0 feature—improved universal access, higher learner engagement, adaptive
learning, increased collaboration, security, and curiosity—offers the chance for in-depth
research. The future of learning will be all about the integration of digital and physical
worlds. MOOCs were a revolution in the way we learn, but Industry 5.0 and Education 5.0
has already created a new world for us to explore. The MOOCs 5.0 evolution will provide
learners with a richer and more personal experience than ever before.
