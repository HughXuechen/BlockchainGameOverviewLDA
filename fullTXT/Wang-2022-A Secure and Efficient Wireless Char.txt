Abstract—To address the limited driving range of electric vehi-
cles (EVs) and promote EVs’ penetration, vehicular energy net-
works (VENs) have emerged and opened possibility to charge EVs
in motion via dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology.
However, security and efficiency concerns arise due to the untrusted
operating environment and EVs’ selfish charging/discharging be-
haviors. Existing trust models rely on the personal recommenda-
tions from neighboring EVs to identify malicious entities in VENs,
which may cause potential privacy breaches and data misuse for
recommenders. Besides, it is challenging to optimally schedule EVs’
energy behaviors by considering complex interactions among three
energy entities (i.e., energy nodes, charging EVs, and discharging
EVs). To this end, by leveraging blockchain technology and game
theory, this paper proposes a secure and efficient wireless charging
scheme to address these issues in VENs. Firstly, a blockchain-
based fine-grained access control mechanism with traceability and
auditability is presented to enable EV users to fully control and
audit their personal rating data usage during trust management by
logging data activities and issuing access tokens into decentralized
ledgers. In this manner, the privacy of recommenders can be pre-
served by fully controlling the access and usage of personal rating
data. Furthermore, by introducing cooperative wireless energy
transfer mode, a hierarchical game-based energy scheduling algo-
rithm is developed to optimize the strategies of three energy parties
tier by tier, while considering their cooperation and competition.
Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate
that the proposed scheme can effectively improve users’ utility and
security of energy transmission for EVs, compared with existing
representative approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION
E LECTRIC vehicles (EVs), as a key enabling component for
future green transportation, hold great potentials in miti-
gating fossil fuel crisis and promoting energy sustainability [1]–
[3]. EVs are expected to take 30% of the new-car market by 2030
with an annual growth of 44 million per year [4]. However,
owing to the limited and inconvenient charging infrastructures,
the booming EV penetration can inevitably cause range anxiety
issues for EV users, especially in highways where the connection
of power grid may be unavailable. Fortunately, dynamic wireless
power transfer (DWPT) technology [5]–[7] has emerged as an
attractive solution which enables wireless energy transmission
to EVs while driving. Qualcomm has demonstrated their Halo
system for EV charging in motion, even when the vehicle is
moving at up to 70 mph [8]. As a matter of fact, Chevy Volt,
Cadillac ELR, Nissan LEAF, Mercedes S550e, BMW i3, and
Tesla Model S have been equipped with DWPT kits powered by
Plugless Power since 2014 [9]. Empowered by DWPT technol-
ogy, vehicular energy networks (VENs) [10], [11] have emerged
as a promising paradigm to facilitate a myriad of on-road energy
services and applications for EVs. VENs are constructed upon
existing transportation systems, and basically consist of a group
of moving EVs and roadside energy nodes equipped with DWPT
facilities to enable wirelessly EV charging or discharging [11]. In
VENs, by deploying energy nodes with DWPT capability, EVs
can receive convenient energy charging services when traveling
without waiting at charging stations. Moreover, via coordinated
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy scheduling, EVs can serve as
both mobile energy sources and flexible loads to help flatten the
load profile of power grids [12].
Along with the aforementioned benefits, the energy manage-
ment of EVs in VEN encounters non-trivial challenges as well.
On one hand, since EV users are intrinsically selfish and au-
tonomous, they may exhibit uncooperative charging/discharging
behaviors in pursuit of self-interests, which can cause severe
effects on energy scheduling [13]. On the other hand, attackers in
VEN can pose severe security and privacy concerns for EV users
through a variety of malicious behaviors, e.g., false information
injection, node impersonation, and privacy leakage. Therefore,
it is urgently needed to design a secure and incentive scheme for
cooperative wireless energy transfer management in VENs.
In the literature, many research works have been reported
on V2V energy scheduling [12], [14], [15], however, most of
them cannot be directly applied in VEN due to the following

reasons. Firstly, the framework of wireless energy transfer in
VEN usually involves three energy parties (i.e., the energy nodes,
charging EVs, and discharging EVs), whereas most of the cur-
rent literature focus on two-sided energy interactions between
energy nodes and charging EVs or discharging EVs in VEN.
Besides, few works consider collaborative energy interactions
between charging EVs and discharging EVs in VENs. Accord-
ing to [16], efficient energy scheduling among shared energy
facilities, energy users with sufficient energy, and energy users
with deficient energy can greatly improve the overall energy
efficiency and user gains. Motivated by these works, we focus on
the wireless charging scheduling in VEN with consideration of
the cooperation and competition among the three energy entities.
Due to the complex interactions and coupled effects among
them, we analyze the optimal energy strategies of participants
by exploiting the hierarchical energy scheduling model [17].
In VENs, energy nodes run by the operators offer wireless
charging and discharging services for EVs. Malicious energy
node operators may threaten EV security through diverse at-
tacks. Besides, the absence of security validations can weaken
the incentives for collaborative EVs. Trust model is an effective
tool to identify malicious operators in power systems through
feedback (e.g., rating) aggregation and trustworthiness assess-
ment [18], [19]. Nonetheless, it may bring new privacy breaches
for EV users in constantly collecting users’ rating data during
trust management [20], which are not properly addressed in
existing works. For example, the shared rating datasets may
contain sensitive user rating information and the locations and
visit time of rated energy nodes. If the shared rating data is
misused by the untrusted data requesters or exposed to malicious
entities, the rating preferences, driving routes, and even home
addresses of EV users can be leaked. Recently, the emerging
blockchain offers an attractive solution for access control of
personal data management in a transparent and accountable
manner [21]–[23]. Therefore, we aim to develop a secure trust
model for EVs to identify malicious energy nodes while pre-
serving EV users’ privacy in trust evaluation by exploiting the
blockchain technology.
In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving
wireless charging (SPC) framework for collaborative wireless
energy transfer in VENs which can achieve the following
three goals: 1) Decentralized privacy provisioning: a consor-
tium blockchain-based personal data management mechanism is
presented for EV users to allow only designated entities can pro-
cess their personal rating information. The blockchain platform
serves as a trust-free authentication and authorization server by
issuing access token as a “proof-of-permission”. 2) Distributed
trust management: with the shared rating information, a trust
model in the blockchain context is constructed from explicit
and implicit trust computing to assess the trustworthiness of
energy nodes and identify malicious entities in providing energy
services. 3) Cooperative energy transfer: by introducing the
cooperative wireless energy transfer (CWET) mode, we analyze
the utilities for charging EVs, discharging EVs, and energy
nodes with diverse user characteristics. Furthermore, the inter-
actions among the three entities are modeled as a game-based
three-tier energy scheduling problem. In the first tier, cooperative
charging and discharging EVs select the optimal energy demand
and price strategies based on the Stackelberg game. In the second
tier, the stable matching pairs for charging and discharging EVs
are obtained through the V2V matching game. In the third tier,
matched EV pairs determine their optimal candidate energy node
to realize inter-vehicle wireless energy transfer by the reverse
auction game. In the conference version [24], to secure wireless
transfer of EVs in VEN, we proposed a privacy-preserving trust
mechanism; meanwhile, we designed a matching-auction game-
based algorithm for energy scheduling. However, we focused on
the cloud-based centralized trust model and didn’t consider the
optimal energy pricing strategies of discharging EVs. Thus, in
this paper, we develop a blockchain-based decentralized mech-
anism with privacy-preserving trust computing, and devise a
Stackelberg game-based pricing model in the matching-auction
process for efficient energy scheduling of EVs.
To summarize, the main contributions of this work are:
� Collaborative Wireless Charging Framework: By exploit-
ing the consortium blockchain technology, a secure and
collaborative wireless energy transmission framework is
proposed in VENs, whereby EVs can behave in collabora-
tion to get secure and efficient energy services.
� Secure and Efficient Scheme: A blockchain-based personal
data management mechanism is devised to prevent the
misuse of shared personal datasets and enable fine-grained
access control for data owners during trust computing. The
off-chain data storage is implemented to improve the scala-
bility and capacity of the blockchain system with mitigated
deploy cost. Furthermore, a three-tier energy scheduling
mechanism is developed to motivate energy cooperation of
EVs and derive optimal strategies of the three energy enti-
ties through a joint Stackelberg-matching-auction game.
� Performance Evaluation: Extensive simulations are con-
ducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can not only
enhance the utility for EV users, but also improve the
security in wireless energy transfer, compared with existing
schemes.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the related literature. Section III introduces the system
model. The blockchain-based personal data management mech-
anism in trust computing is presented in Section IV. The game-
based energy scheduling mechanism is presented in Section V.
Performance evaluation is shown in Section VI. Section VII

A. Trust and Reputation Management in Vehicular Networks
In the literature, many recent works have been reported on
trust and reputation management to enhance vehicular network
security. By leveraging the evolutionary game, Tian et al. de-
velop an evaluation scheme for trust management in Internet of
vehicles (IoV) to model the evolution of adversaries’ attacking
strategies [18]. Javed and Zeadally present a reputation-based
reliable route guidance scheme to identify suspicious traffic

density information through an outlier detection and verifica-
tion method in IoV [19]. Based on reputation assessment, Cui
et al. design a novel lightweight message authentication protocol
to mitigate malicious messages in 5G-enabled vehicular net-
works [25]. Huang et al. propose a multi-weighted subjective
logic-based trust mechanism to enhance security in vehicular
edge networks [26], where the local trust management tasks are
executed by edge servers. However, most of the existing trust
and reputation approaches may suffer from privacy misuse and
privacy disclosure during the collection of personal rating or rec-
ommendation information for trust and reputation calculation.
B. Blockchain Approaches in Vehicular Networks
Currently, the emerging blockchain as a unique decentral-
ized paradigm has been widely applied in IoV context to se-
curely record and share data among various untrusted entities.
By optimally managing the number of vehicular transactions
with clustering techniques, Sharma presents an energy-efficient
blockchain model for IoV with 40.16% improvement in energy
conservation [27]. Liu et al. investigate a secure blockchain-
enabled IoV data trading framework whereby a debt-credit
mechanism and a two-stage Stackelberg game are utilized to
ensure efficient data sharing among vehicles [28]. By incor-
porating sub-blockchain networks into vehicular networking,
Jiang et al. study secure and distributed storage of vehicular big
data while ensuring information transparency for IoV applica-
tions [29]. Chen et al. devise a permissioned blockchain-based
data trading scheme integrated with an iterative double auction
mechanism to safeguard and facilitate truthful data transmission
among vehicle users [30]. However, the personal data recorded
in the blockchain are public and transparent to any node in the
decentralized network, which may disclose users’ private and
sensitive information. In addition, the massive data resided on
the distributed ledgers may cause a heavy burden of managing
and synchronizing the blockchain.
C. Energy Scheduling Mechanisms for EVs
There has been a number of increasing literature on V2V en-
ergy scheduling for cooperative EVs. Li et al. develop an optimal
deployment mechanism for wireless charging infrastructures by
considering both recharging ability and traffic mobility to reduce
traffic delay and facility utilization rate, where the problem is
solved by the particle swarm optimization method [31]. Due to
the limited power supply of EV service equipment, Park et al.
present a load scheduling algorithm with different targets such
as battery stability and energy efficiency, where a blockchain
network is employed for secured charging billing [32]. Zeng
et al. present a cooperative EV-to-EV energy management
framework for EVs in parking lots aiming to improve both the
energy efficiency and the quality of experience (QoE) of EV
users [12]. Zhang et al. develop a collaborative V2V charging
scheme to optimally schedule EVs’ charging and discharging
behaviors based on max-weight V2V matching game and bi-
partite graph [33]. Mediwaththe and Smith explore a two-stage
non-cooperative game-theoretical framework for coordinated
EV charging based on prospect theory by considering users’

segment in blockchain-enabled VEN.
potential non-ideal behaviors [34]. Ghosh and Aggarwal design
a menu-based pricing mechanism in charging stations integrated
with renewable energy and energy storage to derive optimal price
and energy contracts for EVs with divergent preferences [35].
Wei et al. develop an intelligent multi-charging management
scheme for garage charging operators with the integration of
battery charging impacts under time-of-use pricing [36]. Fotouhi
et al. propose a stochastic EV charging model which incor-
porates EV drivers’ behavioral characteristics to improve the
quality of service of public charging stations as well as consumer
satisfaction [37]. The above works for energy scheduling of EVs
mainly focus on two-sided energy interactions between energy
nodes and charging EVs or discharging EVs. Besides, few works
consider the utility model of energy nodes in the DWPT scenario.
In this work, the energy interactions among energy nodes,
charging EVs, and discharging EVs are jointly considered in
designing efficient energy scheduling mechanisms. In addition,
we further consider the driving patterns, social trust, and user
cooperation/competition in energy scheduling.
Different from existing works, this paper investigates the
secure and incentive scheme for cooperative DWPT in VENs
through a blockchain-based trust model with automated ac-
cess control of personal rating data and a hierarchical game-
based energy scheduling algorithm, to coordinate EVs’ charg-
ing/discharging behaviors while protecting their security and
privacy.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Network Model
Fig. 1 shows the blockchain-enabled VEN, which mainly
consists of a set of energy nodes, a fleet of moving EVs, and
multiple roadside units (RSUs).
Road Network. The road network can be described as a
directed graph G(E,O), where E is the set of road intersections
and O is the set of road segments. The energy nodes are deployed
on part of the road segments with charging/discharging facilities
installed. Let Z denote the set of all possible loop-free vehicular
routes in the graphG. Each z ∈ Z is a sequence of connected arcs
with traffic density�(t). Specifically, we have z = (o1, . . . , o|z|),
where ok ∈ O, 1 ≤ k ≤ |z|.

Energy Nodes. A set of energy nodes J = {1, . . . , j, . . . , J}
are strategically deployed alongside the roads to offer DWPT
services for passing EVs. In VEN, each energy node j ∈ J
equips a lane with charging tracks �c, a lane with discharg-
ing tracks �d, and a lane without power tracks �o to enable
dynamic energy exchange with EVs in motion through DWPT.
These charging/discharging tracks (or called power tracks) are
composed of coils buried under the road surface, and are con-
nected by a common bus with an energy storage device (ESD)
attached [11]. Through dynamic wireless charging, energy can
be wirelessly and dynamically transferred to EVs when moving
on power tracks [6]. Thereby, EVs can get charged or discharged
without the need of stopping or slowing down. The energy
deficit can be compensated by the ESD while the excessive
energy can be stored. The length of charging/discharging tracks
owned by energy node j is denoted as lj . The service capability
Θj of energy node j for DWPT services is associated with its
charging/discharging rate P e
j , energy capacity Cs
j of the ESD,
and the length of power tracks lj , which can be expressed as:
Θj = ζj · P e
j · Cs
j · ln (1 + lj) , (1)
where ζj is an adjustment factor of energy node j.
EVs. Each EV is equipped with an bidirectional charger and
DWPT device for wireless charging and discharging. The set of
EVs in VEN is denoted by I = {1, . . . , i, . . . , I}, which can be
further divided into three categories, i.e., M, N, and L, where
M ∪N ∪ L = I. Here, M = {1, . . . ,m, . . . ,M} is the set of
charging EVs, N = {1, . . . , n, . . . , N} is the set of discharging
EVs, and L = {1, . . . , l, . . . , L} is the set of EVs without any
needs of energy exchange. For each EV i ∈ I, its possible
vehicular routes is denoted as a subset of Z, i.e., Zi ⊆ Z. Here,
Zi = {zi,1, . . . , zi,a, . . . , zi,|Zi|}, and zi,a = (o1, . . . , o|zi,a|). In
VEN, EVs with redundant or deficient battery energy can coop-
eratively exchange energy with the assistance of power tracks
installed in energy nodes via DWPT. Each moving EV i ∈ I can
select its role (i.e., M, N, and L) based on its battery state of
charge (SoC) (i.e., αi) and the selection of lanes (i.e., �c, �d,
and �o). Let T = {1, . . . , t, . . . , T} be the finite time horizon,
which can be further divided into T time slots with equal length
δ. Let λi(t) = {−1, 0, 1} be the selection variable of EV i for
different lane types at time slot t. Specifically, λi(t) = −1 means
that EV i selects the discharging lane �d; λi(t) = 1 indicates that
the charging lane �c is chosen by EV i; otherwise, λi(t) = 0.
Since the time interval δ can be sufficiently small, for each
EV i ∈ I, its velocity vi(t) and selection variable λi(t) can be
approximately fixed within each time slot t ∈ T . According to
the fluid traffic model [38], EVs are assumed to drive at the same
speed v(t) at time slot t, and the average velocity v(t) of EVs
is associated with the traffic density �(t), which is estimated by
v(t) = [vmin, vmax(1− �(t)
�max
)]+, where [x, y]+ = max{x, y},
vmin is the minimum vehicle velocity, vmax is the maximum
vehicle velocity, and �max is the maximum density of vehicles
on the road.
RSUs. A group of RSUs are deployed alongside the roads
in VEN to provide wireless connectivity for both EVs and
energy nodes in their coverage areas. Let R = {1, . . . , r, . . . , R}
denote the set of RSUs in the network. For each RSU r, its
communication coverage is a circle with radius radiusr. More-
over, RSUs are served as distributed transaction collectors and
verifiers to collect EV users’ transactions (e.g., energy transac-
tions, personal data request transactions, and data access consent
transactions) and record them into the blockchain through the
consensus phase.
Consortium Blockchain. In consortium blockchain networks,
data is recorded into hash-chained blocks and only authorized
entities can participate in the decentralized networks [30]. Due
to the limited storage and computing capacities, EVs and energy
nodes perform as lightweight nodes which only store the block
header instead of the entire blockchain [2]. For instance, the
data size of whole blocks in Bitcoin is about 100 GB, while that
of a block header is only about 1.5 MB. RSUs are provisioned
with powerful computing capacities and act as full nodes in the
blockchain. RSUs store the entire blockchain data and can carry
out consensus operations to reach an agreement on the data to
be appended to the blockchain.
B. Cooperative Wireless Energy Transfer Model
In VENs, EVs with redundant battery energy can collabora-
tively share their surplus energy to adjacent EVs with deficient
battery energy through DWPT. Based on [33], the concept of
cooperative wireless energy transfer (CWET) is introduced to
describe the power flow interactions among energy nodes and
collaborative EVs in VENs. CWET mode can be beneficial for
both energy operators and charging/discharging EVs. Owing to
the limited energy capacity of ESD in each energy node, through
coordinated V2V energy scheduling, charging overloads of en-
ergy nodes in providing DWPT services can be greatly relieved.
Besides, by executing CWET mode in the peak time of the
power grid, the load profile of grid systems can be reshaped
to smooth power fluctuation and enhance power stability. For
EVs as energy consumers, their range anxiety can be mitigated
while the QoE can be enhanced since EVs can be charged more
easily on roads. For EVs as energy providers, they can earn extra
profits by sharing surplus energy to neighboring EVs.
The procedure of CWET mode in VENs can be simplified as
follows. First, in the EV discovery process, all cooperative EVs
with charging/discharging desires send their energy information
including charging requests, energy prices, and maximum dis-
chargeable energy to the RSU via vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) com-
munications. Then, RSUs broadcast energy requests to nearby
EVs. Next, the charging EV and discharging EV that make an
agreement on the energy demand and price form an EV pair.
Last, the matched charging EV and discharging EV in the EV
pair jointly select a nearby energy node to realize inter-vehicle
wireless energy exchange. Note that with the assistance of ESD,
the matched EV pair does not need to simultaneously drive on
the power tracks in the energy node.
C. Power Dynamics Model
Based on the analytical traction model [7], for EV i driving at
a velocity vi(t) and an acceleration ai(t) =
dvi(t)
dt , its required
traction force F d
i (t) at time slot t can be described by the sum

of acceleration resistance force F acc
i (t), rolling resistance force
F rol
i (t), gradient resistance force F gra
i (t), and air resistance
force F air
i (t). As such, we have
F d
i (t) = F acc
i (t) + F rol
i (t) + F gra
i (t) + F air
i (t)
= κaccmiai(t) + κrolmig cosφ(t) +mig sinφ(t)
+ 0.5κair�airAi (vi(t))
2 , (2)
where κacc is the acceleration resistance coefficient, mi is the
vehicle weight of EV i, κrol is the rolling resistance coefficient,
g is the gravity acceleration, φ(t) is the road gradient, κair is
the air drag coefficient, �air is the air density, and Ai is the area
of vehicle’s front surface. The required traction power P d
i (t)
and required battery power P b
i (t) of EV i at time slot t can be
attained as [7] {
P d
i (t) = F d
i (t) · v(t), (3)
P b
i (t) = 1/ηM · P d
i (t), (4)
where ηM is the motor efficiency during the process of convert-
ing electric energy into kinetic energy.
If EV i is driving on the lanes equipped with power tracks (i.e.,
λi(t) = {−1, 1}), its battery SoC (i.e.,αi(t)) is varied according
to its selection of lane types (i.e., λi(t)) and the wireless power
(i.e., P e
j ) transferred by the energy node j. Otherwise, if it is
traveling on the lanes with no charging/discharging tracks (i.e.,
λi(t) = 0), its battery SoC is in a decline. The battery dynamics
of EV i can be described as a linear model, i.e.,
dαi(t)
dt
=
{
−ηiP b

)

Ci
, λi(t)={−1, 1},
(5)
where ηi is the battery energy conversion efficiency of EV i,Ci is
EV i’s battery capacity, and ηW is the wireless power efficiency
of energy nodes. Besides, to prolong EV’s battery life, the battery
SoC of EV i should be no less than the minimum value αmin,
i.e., αmin ≤ αi(t) ≤ 1, ∀t ∈ T [7]. Let xi(t) be the charging or
discharging energy of EV i at time slot t. If δ is small enough,
we can approximately have
xi(t) =
∫ te
ts
λi(τ)ηWP e
j (τ)dτ = λi(t)ηWP e
j (t)δ. (6)
where ts and te = ts + δ are the start and end time of time slot
t, respectively. Here, xi(t) > 0 means that EV i is in charging
state, while xi(t) < 0 implies that EV i is in discharging state.
D. Power Congestion Model
The participation of charging or discharging EVs into bal-
ancing power may challenge the operation of ESDs in energy
nodes and cause congestions. According to existing works [39],
the power congestion can be mitigated via direct load control or
market pricing mechanisms. In this work, an energy reservation
mechanism is exploited to handle the congestion via market
pricing, where matched EV pairs can send energy reservations
to the particular energy node on their route. Specifically, a
power congestion factor ψj is defined as an measurement of
the congestion effect to the ESD j, i.e., ψj =
1
ξ (τarr − τres).
Here, τarr is the average arrival time of the EV pair, τres is
the energy reservation time, and ξ is a normalization constant.
By adapting the DWPT service price according to the power
congestion factor, the power congestion of energy nodes can be
alleviated (as shown in Sect. V-B).
E. Threat Model and Security Assumptions
We consider the following threats and security assumptions
during wireless energy transfer and trust management.
In the system, part of energy nodes can be compromised by
adversaries. Malicious energy nodes may launch a variety of
attacks (e.g., false information injection, advertising fraudulent
energy services, and replacing with poor-quality energy) to
threaten vehicle security during energy transmission with EVs
for profit. Besides, the data store (e.g., AWS and Google Drive)
for personal data storage is assumed to be honest-but-curious,
where it would honestly execute the required protocols and
operations, but is curious about the results after each operation.
In addition, the blockchain platform is assumed to be secure,
i.e., its recorded data in the hash-chained blocks is immutable
and tamper-resistant.
Misuse of Shared Personal Data. The shared rating datasets
of EV users usually contain the sensitive rating information and
the rating time and locations of rated energy nodes. As such,
EV user’s rating preferences, driving routes, and even home
addresses may be disclosed if the data requester misuses or sells
them to other third parties for monetary purposes.
Threats to Data Ownership. Once an EV user shares his rating
dataset to other entities, he may lose control of his rating data
and fail to monitor the personal data usage.
IV. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PERSONAL DATA MANAGEMENT IN
TRUST COMPUTING
In this section, the blockchain-based personal data manage-
ment mechanism is first introduced. Then, the trust model is
devised to privately assess the trustworthiness of energy nodes
via explicit trust computing and implicit trust computing.
A. System Overview
To evaluate the trustworthiness of a specific energy node
(i.e., DWPT service provider) more accurately, apart from the
direct observations originated from their historical energy in-
teractions (referred to as explicit trust computing), an EV user
(i.e., DWPT service customer) can request personal rating data
(e.g., recommendations, ratings, and feedbacks) from other EV
users (referred to as implicit trust computing). Since the direct
energy interactions between an EV and an energy node are
usually infrequent, EVs can acquire a more accurate profile of the
trustworthiness of an energy node via implicit trust evaluation
by aggregating the recommendations or opinions obtained from
other EVs. However, in traditional client-server architecture, the
access control of personal data fully relies on the truthfulness
of the centralized authentication and authorisation server which
controls data access and provenance. As a result, the lack of trust
and transparency in traditional approaches concerning personal

data management may raise risks of privacy leakage and data
misuse, as well as difficulties in data accountability. For the
recommenders (i.e., personal data owners), to take full con-
trol of their personal data from being misused, the consortium
blockchain is deployed to enable trust-free data management,
fine-grained access control, and data ownership traceability.
As depicted in Fig. 2, in the proposed blockchain-based per-
sonal data management system, there exist the following steps.
� The data requester asks the data owner for permission to
access his personal data which is stored in an off-chain data
store (Step 1).
� If the data owner grants access permission to the data
requester, he sends a consent message with personalized
access control rules to the blockchain platform (Step 2).
� The blockchain platform serves as the decentralized au-
thorization server for logging data usage activities, issuing
access tokens, and updating access control policies. After
reaching consensus, the access token, as an evidence for
authorisation to access a particular dataset, is returned to
the data requester (Step 3).
� After receiving the data query from data requester with the
access token (Step 4), the data store checks the validity
of access token by synchronizing the latest blockchain
(Step 5).
� If validation passes, the data store returns query results to
the data requester (Step 6).
B. Off-Chain Storage and Compound Identity Generation
For better scalability and mitigated overhead of blockchain,
the off-chain storage technique is adopted for personal data
storage by moving EV users’ data to off-chain data stores while
maintaining a pointer of the data on the blockchain. Here,
the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [40] is employed as the
distributed off-chain data store while the pointer refers to the
hash value of personal data. In IPFS, data is stored in the form of
distributed files and is identified and addressed via a unique hash
value of the data [40]. The storage nodes in IPFS are assumed to
be honest-but-curious, where they would honestly perform the
operations in data query but are curious about the results.
The certificate authority (CA) is responsible for authenticating
identities and issuing certificates. Each EV, energy node, and
RSU become authorized in the network after binding their real
identities (e.g., the vehicle identification number of each EV, the
digital business license of each energy node and RSU) at CA.
Furthermore, we employ compound identity [23], which is an
extension of asymmetric keys, as the shared identity for two or
more parties associated with a digital asset. In our scenario, a
compound identity �i,DS of a dateset Di of EV i consists of an
asymmetric key-pair (yi, xi) for the data owner i, an asymmetric
key-pair (yDS , xDS) for the data store, and an asymmetric key-
pair (yenc, xenc) for the data pointer of dataset Di. In this sense,
the personal data can be protected from other participants in the
system. In specific, the compound identity �i,DS is defined as a
6-tuple as below:
�i,DS =
(
yi, xi, yDS , xDS , yenc, xenc
)
. (7)
Formally, the �i,DS is externally observed by the nodes in the
blockchain network as a 3-tuple:
�publici,DS =
(
yi, yDS , yenc
)
. (8)
Meanwhile, the �i,DS is observed by the data owner i or data
store as a 5-tuple:
�DO
i,DS =
(
yi, xi, yDS , yenc, xenc
)
, (9)
�DS
i,DS =
(
yi, yDS , xDS , yenc, xenc
)
. (10)
When EV user i attempts to store his rating data Di, he can
broadcast an off-chain data storage transaction txdata to the
blockchain network after a new shared compound identity is
generated. Using a hash pointer ψ = H(Di), the dataset Di can
route to an off-chain IPFS. Note that the data recorded on ledgers
can be publicly accessible and auditable for all participating
nodes in the blockchain network. Hence, the sensitive and private
data including the raw hash pointer ψ used for uniquely data
addressing should be protected and can only be accessed by
authorized entities. In specific, ψ should be privately kept and
only the encrypted versionψenc = Eyenc
(ψ) is shared to granted
data requesters. Besides, only the hash value of ψ, i.e.,H(ψ), is
stored on the blockchain. Here, E(.) is the encryption function
andH(.) is the hash function (i.e., SHA-256). Formally, the data
storage transaction txdata is described as:
txdata =
〈
�publici,DS ||H(ψ)||time||Sigxi
(σd)||SigxDS
(σd)
〉
,
(11)
where time is the timestamp for transaction generation, σd is the
hash digest of txdata, andSigxi
(.) is the signature function using
the private key xi. Due to the irreversibility of hash functions,
given H(ψ), the original ψ cannot be inferred by others in the
transparent blockchain. The detailed operation flow of personal
data management is illustrated in Fig. 3.
C. Access Request and Access Authorisation
In step (1) in Fig. 3, the data requester (i.e., EV user k) who
intends to compute implicit trust values of particular energy
nodes can send a data request message to the rating data owner
i, i.e.,
requestMsg =
〈
Req||time||Eyk
(nonce)||Sigxk
(σr)
〉
,
(12)
where nonce is a random number, (yk, xk) is the public/private
key-pair of data requester k, and σr is the hash digest of message

requestMsg.Eyk
(nonce) indicates that only the data requester
himself holds a valid nonce and the validity of nonce can be
checked by other nodes in blockchain. If data owner i grants
consent to a data requester k in step (2), a grant transaction
txgrant is generated with specific access control policies as
follows:
txgrant =
〈
requestMsg||policyi→k||
token||time||Sigxi
(σg)
〉
, (13)
where σg is the hash digest of txgrant. policyi→k is EV i’s
access policy for EV k in processing Di, and it can be denoted
as a 4-tuple, i.e.,
policyi→k =
(
yi, yk, πi,k, exT ime
)
, (14)
where πi,k is the authorization operations such as create, read,
update, and delete (i.e., CRUD operations). exT ime is the expire
time such as a day, a week, and a month. In (13), token is the
access token as a “proof of permission” indicating that an entity
has been granted for accessing a specific dataset. We have
token = Sigxi
[
yi||ψenc||time
]
, (15)
where ψenc is the encrypted hash pointer of dataset Di by using
the public key yenc.
D. Token Authorization
The access policy state of each associated personal dataset is
stored in the form of key-value and maintained by all consensus
nodes. During each consensus epoch, the access policies of
data owners are updated based on the recorded policy-related
transactions in step (3). The access policy stateAmap of dataset
Di owned by EV i is denoted as:
Amap =
〈
IDi,
[
policyi→k
]|K|
k=1
〉
, (16)
where IDi is the identity of data owner i and is identified by
its public key yi. K is the set of data requests with consent to
access dataset Di, and |K| is its cardinality.
The data requester k can query its access policy and autho-
rization status in step (4) by sending a query transaction txquery:
txquery =
〈
σg||nonce||time||Sigxk
(σq)
〉
, (17)
where σq is the hash digest of transaction txquery. nonce is
defined in (12) and is used to identify whether it is the true
requester or not. In step (5), after receiving the transaction
txquery, each consensus node checks the validity of nonce and
the attached signature. If the verification passes, each consensus
node attaches its signature on it. If txquery passes the pre-defined
threshold condition (i.e., more than 2
3R distinct consensus nodes
sign on it), the block producer returns the authorized token
Token to the data requester in step (6) via multi-signature
technique:
Token =
〈
token||time
∣∣∣∣
∣∣∣∣{yq}|Q|q=1
∣∣∣∣
∣∣∣∣
MultiSig(H(token||time)) 〉, (18)
where time is the issuance time of Token, Q is the set of
consensus nodes (i.e., RSUs) who signs on transaction txquery,
and |Q| is its cardinality. MultiSig(.) is the multi-signature of
all consensus nodes in set Q.
E. Data Return and Policy Management
For the data store, only the application programming interface
(API) call with a valid Token can successfully execute the call.
Specifically, after receiving the Token for data request in step
(7), the data store first validates the correctness and freshness of
Token by checking its contained multi-signature of consensus
nodes and its issuance time in step (8). Then, it checks the
signature of data owner i on message token by using the public
key yi. The data store maintains all the identities of data owners
and the corresponding private keys of the pointer of personal
datasets, which are stored in the form as key-value:
Imap =
〈
IDi, xenc
〉|I|
i=1, (19)
where IDi = yi is the identity of data owner i,xenc is the private
key of the pointer of dataset Di, and I is the set of data owners
who store personal dataset in the data store. Then, based on Imap
and yi, the data store decodes ψenc in token by using the private
key xenc and obtains the original hash pointerψ. Here,ψ is used
for data addressing in IPFS. Finally, the data store returns the
requested data to the data requester in step (9).
In addition, for better control of the personal data, the data
owner i can change or revoke the granted access permissions
for a certain set of data requesters (i.e., K) by issuing a txaccess
transaction with a set of new permissions, i.e.,
txaccess =
〈[
policynewi→k
]|K|
k=1 ||time||Sigxi
(σa)
〉
, (20)
where σa is the hash digest of txaccess. policynewi→k =
(yi, yk, π
new
i,k , exT imenew) is the new access policy granted to
data requester k. If πnew
i,k = ∅ and exT imenew = 0, it means
that the access permission is revoked.
Security Analysis. By immutably logging the data usage
activities and permissions in decentralized ledgers through dis-
tributed consensus operations, the proposed blockchain system
can offer traceable data provenance and data ownership for
the update and revocation of user’s access policy. The access
policy of the personal data can be securely updated once the
consent is granted or revoked by the data owner. As a result,
users can customise their own access policies on each shared
dataset by specifying access control rules on the immutable and
tamper-resistant blockchain ledgers. Thereby, our blockchain

system can provide trust-free authorization for personal data
management with fine-grained access control.
Besides, through membership registration and certificate is-
suance by CA, only authorized nodes can join the blockchain
network, which can protect the network from external attack-
ers. Moreover, since EV users can dynamically change their
pseudonyms (i.e., public keys) in different transactions, the
anonymity and unlinkability can be achieved for identity and
location privacy protection. Additionally, since all registered
entities and corresponding identities are managed by CA, the
misbehaving entities can be identified and tracked to achieve
conditional anonymity.
F. Distributed Trust Management
To assess the trustworthiness of energy nodes in offering
wireless energy services, the trust model is established from
two aspects, namely, explicit trust and implicit trust.
1) Explicit Trust. For EV i, its explicit trust ETi,j in energy
node j is associated with the satisfaction of energy service, which
is represented by the rating value. Let rahi,j ∈ [0, 1] be the rating
value given by EV i to energy node j for h-th energy service.
Here, raki,j = 1 indicates absolutely positive experience, while
raki,j = 0 means absolutely negative experience. By incorporat-
ing the time decay effects of interactions, the explicit trust of
EV i in energy node j is the weighted sum of historical ratings,
i.e.,
ETi,j =
∑Hi,j
h=1 ra
h
i,j ·Θ(th)∑Hi,j
h=1 Θ(th)
, (21)
whereHi,j is the total number of interactions between EV i and
energy node j. Θ(th) = e−�(τ−th) means the exponential time
decay function to capture the nature that latest ratings are more
important than previous ones. Here, � is the rate of decay, τ is
the current time, and th is h-th service time.
2) Implicit Trust. For EV i, its implicit trust in energy node
j is evaluated according to the recommendation information
collected from other EVs that have interacted with energy node
j. The recommendation information of an EV i′ for an energy
node j is stored in the off-chain data store, and can be denoted
by a time sequence as:
reci,′j =
〈
(ra1
i,′j , t1),· · ·, (rahi,′j , th),· · ·, (ra
Hi,′j
i,′j , tHi,′j )
〉
.
(22)
EV i can access the personal recommendation data after the
consent of data owner and the authorization of the blockchain
network. Commonly, malicious users may offer false and mis-
leading recommendations, and legitimate users may give unfair
and subjective feedbacks due to personal expectations and opin-
ions. The credibility of recommendations needs to be accessed.
The credibility measurement process is composed of two phases,
i.e., malicious feedbacks detection and credibility assessment
for normal feedbacks. In the first phase, the extreme malicious
feedbacks (EMFs) can be detected and eliminated via threshold
filtering. In specific, the rating beyond the range of μ± 3σ can
be regarded as an EMF, where μ is the mean of the collected
Γ number of feedback ratings towards a specific energy node,
and σ =
√∑Γ
m=1 (ram−μ)2
Γ−1 is the standard deviation. Besides, to
detect the hidden malicious feedbacks (HMFs) within μ± 3σ,
the non-parametric cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm can
be applied. The detailed HMF detection procedure using non-
parametric CUSUM algorithm can refer to [41], [42].
The second phase involves computing the credibility of each
normal feedback based on social features and rating deviations.
Normally, for an EV user i′, a higher trust that EV user i puts
on his friends instead of the strangers. Moreover, the smaller
deviation between his ratings with the average rating of others
on a specific energy node, the higher credibility of his recom-
mendation. The trust value between EV users can be described
by their social relationships in the social network G. Let sri,i′
be the edge (i.e., social relationship) between vertices (i.e., EV
users) i and i′ in graph G. Here, sri,i′ = 1 means that two users
have the closest relation, while sri,i′ = 0 stands for the opposite.
Then, the trust of EV user i in EV user i′ can be obtained as:
Ti,i′ = sri,i′ + δs
∑
ĩ∈Ni
sri,̃i · srĩ,i′ , (23)
where δs ∈ [0, 1] is an adjustment parameter. Ni is the set of
social neighbours of EV user i, which means sri,̃i �= 0, ∀ĩ ∈ Ni.
Next, the deviation value of EV i′ in energy node j is defined
as:
divi,′j =
1
Hi,′j
∑Hi,′j
h=1
∣∣rahi,′j − raj∣∣, (24)
where raj = 1
|Ij |
∑
ĩ∈Ij
1
Hi,′j
∑Hĩ,j
h=1 ra
h
ĩ,j
is the average rating
given by recommender EVs to energy node j. Ij is the set of
recommender EVs that have interacted with energy node j and
granted the recommendation request of EV i. Then, for EV i,
the credibility of EV i′’s recommendation on energy node j is:
crei,i,′j = Ti,i′ · (1− divi,′j). (25)
The implicit trust of EV i in energy node j can be acquired by
ITi,j =
∑
i′∈Ij
Hi,′j∑
h=1
crei,i,′jra
h
i,′jΘ(th)
∑
i′∈Ij
Hi,′j∑
h=1
crei,i,′jΘ(th)
. (26)
3) Global Trust. The global trust of EV i in energy node j is
the combination of the explicit and implicit trust, i.e.,
Ti,j = �i,j · ETi,j+
(
1−�i,j
) ·ITi,j . (27)
Here, �i,j is the weight parameter and is adjusted by �i,j =
Hi,j
Hi,j+δt
, where δt ∈ [0, 1] is an adjustment parameter. It reflects
the fact that with higher direct interaction times, the explicit trust
becomes more accurate and its effect will increase.
V. GAME-BASED ENERGY SCHEDULING IN VEN
After charging EVm and discharging EV n calculate the trust
values of all neighboring energy nodes, the formed collaborative
EV pair (m,n) can select a trustworthy energy node with the
lowest cost to receive DWPT service under CWET mode. The

WANG et al.: SECURE AND EFFICIENT WIRELESS CHARGING SCHEME FOR EVS IN EVNS 1499
wireless charging process is coordinated by the proposed hier-
archical game model with consideration of the trust evaluation.
In particular, the social trust value between EVs is considered in
forming stable EV pairs, while the trustworthiness of energy
nodes in considered for optimal candidate selection. In this
section, the utility functions of charging/discharging EVs and
energy nodes are first presented. Then, the energy interactions
among these three energy entities are formulated as a hierar-
chical game model. Finally, the optimal energy strategies of the
three energy entities are derived via game analysis.
A. User Utility Formulation
Utility Function of Charging EVs. For EV m ∈M with
energy charging desire and operating in CWET mode, its utility
function can be defined as its payoff minus its cost in energy
consumption:
Uc
m (xm,n, pm,n) = �m − Cm, (28)
where �m denotes the payoff of EV m who requests energy
demand xm from discharging EV n, and Cm is the cost of EVm
in energy charging process. The charging satisfaction [10], [43],
as a measurement of EV user’s QoE, is employed to represent
the payoff of EV m, which can be formulated as:
�m = βmTm,n ln (1 + ηmxm,n) , xm,n ∈ [0, cmax
m ], (29)
where βm is the satisfaction parameter reflecting EVm’s desire
for charging, Tm,n is the social trust of EV m in EV n and
is defined in (23), ηm is the energy efficiency of EV m, and
cmax
m is the maximum amount of charging energy for EV m.
The cost of EV m during energy charging is related to the
battery degradation cost and charging expenditure paid to both
discharging EV n and energy node j, which can be obtained by
Cm = ϑγcmxm,n + pm,nxm,n +
pj
2
, (30)
where γcm is the unit cost of battery degradation of EVm for each
charging operation [7], ϑ is an adjustment factor, pm,n is the unit
energy price that charging EVm pays to discharging EV n, and
pj is the payment of DWPT service provided by energy node
j which is evenly shared in each matched charging/discharging
EV pair (m,n).
Utility Function of Discharging EVs. For discharging EV n ∈
N that provides energy amount−xm,n to EVm and operates in
CWET mode, its utility function can be defined as the difference
between its revenue and cost, which can be expressed as:
Ud
n (xm,n, pm,n) = pm,n (−xm,n)− ϑγdn (−xm,n)− pj
2
=−pm,nxm,n + ϑγdnxm,n − pj
2
, xm,n ∈ [−dmax
n , 0],
(31)
where −pm,nxm,n is the revenue for providing energy amount
to EV m, γdn is the unit cost of battery degradation of EV n in
each discharging operation [7], and dmax
n the maximum amount
of discharging energy for EV n.
Utility Function of Energy Nodes. For energy node j∈J
that provides DWPT service to each EV pair (m,n), its utility
function can be given as:
πj = pj − cj , s.t. pj ≥ cj , (32)
where cj is the cost of energy node j for offering DWPT service
to EV pair (m,n). In common, the higher service capability
of an energy node means higher cost for building its energy
infrastructure such as the wireless power tracks. Meanwhile,
higher average trust value implies higher cost in maintaining
high-quality DWPT service. Therefore, the cost of energy node
j is associated with its service capability Θj , average trust value
T j of EVs in I to itself, and the traded energy amount xj in each
DWPT service, i.e.,
cj = ς1
j ln
(
1 + T j
)
+ ς2
jψjΘjxj , (33)
where ς1
j , ς
2
j are positive cost parameters of energy node j, and
ψj is the power congestion factor defined in Section III-D.
B. Hierarchical Game Formulation
Each charging EV m ∈M and discharging EV n ∈ N can
operate in CWET mode (as analyzed in Section III-B) and
send discharging or charging requests to the RSU, respectively.
Based on EVs’ charging/discharging information collected by
the RSU, each charging EVmneeds to choose its energy demand
strategy xm,n, while each discharging EV n selects its energy
price strategy pm,n. Next, each involved charging EV selects its
EV pair for charging, while each discharging EV picks its EV
pair for discharging. Lastly, the charging and discharging EV
in the matched EV pair jointly select an energy node j in their
common routes to realize wireless energy transfer. To derive
the optimal strategies of both charging EVs and discharging
EVs in the cooperative energy exchange process, we divide
the decision-making process of EVs into the following three
tiers. Tier 1: each charging EV desires higher energy demand
with low payment, whereas each discharging EV hopes the
payment can be as high as possible. Based on [3], the optimal
energy demand strategies of charging EVs and optimal pricing
strategies of discharging EVs can be derived by a two-stage
Stackelberg game. Tier 2: each charging/discharging EV com-
petes with each other to form optimal EV pair and maximize
its own utility. Based on [33], the optimal matching strategies
for charging/discharging EVs can be obtained by the matching
game. Tier 3: each pair of matched charging and discharging EVs
determines an optimal energy node to purchase DWPT services
for inter-vehicular energy exchange. The reverse auction game
can be used to derive the optimal candidate energy node (i.e.,
bidder) for each matched EV pair (i.e., auctioneer). In the above
games, all players are assumed to be rational and selfish, whose
targets are to pursue their maximum utilities. Hence, we design
a hierarchical game-based three-tier energy scheduling (GTS)
algorithm for charging EVs, discharging EVs, and energy nodes,
as illustrated in Algorithm 1.
C. Three-Tier Game Analysis

tiers.

wireless energy transfer by:

j∈Π
p∗j , (34)
where p∗j is the optimal bid of energy node j ∈ Π
derived by (50).
Tier 1: Two-stage Stackelberg game for charging EVs and
discharging EVs. In the two-stage Stackelberg game, each dis-
charging EV, as the leader of the game, first selects its optimal
energy price strategy to maximize its utility in stage I. Then, each
charging EV, as the follower of the game, selects its optimal
charging demand strategy in stage II for utility maximization
based on the announced price of the leader. The solution of the
Stackelberg game is the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), which
implies that all players in the game cannot alter their strategies
to improve their utilities. The SE of the proposed Stackelberg
game is denoted by (p∗m,n, x

The backward induction method is employed to analyze the SE,
where the strategy of the follower (i.e., charging EVm) in stage
II is first analyzed. Then, based on the obtained result, the strat-
egy of the leader (i.e., discharging EV n) in stage I is analyzed.
Specifically, the charging EVm first decides its optimal strategy
on energy demand to maximize its utility Uc
m(xm,n, pm,n).
Next, given the optimal energy demand x∗m,n of charging EVm,
the discharging EV n decides its optimal energy price strategy
p∗m,n to maximize its utilityUd
n(x

m,n, pm,n). The following two
theorems are presented to obtain the SE.
Theorem 1: If the price of discharging EV n satisfies pθ2 <
pm,n < pθ1 , the optimal energy demand strategy of charging EV
m is
x∗m,n =

Theorem 2: Given the energy demand of charging EVm, the
optimal price strategy of discharging EV n is denoted as:
p∗m,n =

βmTm,nηmϑ (γcm + γdm)− ϑγcm. (41)
Proof: Refer to Appendix B. �
Tier 2: V2V matching game for charging EVs and discharging
EVs. After all charging and discharging EVs decide their optimal
energy demand and price strategies, respectively, each involved
EV makes its optimal selection strategy via the proposed V2V
matching game, as given in lines 5-13 in Algorithm 1. In the
V2V matching game, the optimization function of each charg-
ing/discharging EV is expressed as follows:

m (in line 7). Meanwhile, each discharging EV
n picks the optimal charging EV for energy exchange (in line 10)
by establishing its preference list Γt
n (in line 9). After iteration
t, each charging EV whose energy request is rejected updates
its rejection list Gt+1
m (in line 11) and its preference list Γt+1
m ,
then the set of unmatched charging EVs (i.e., M′) is updated (in
line 12). To derive the stable matching outcome, the following
definitions in the V2V matching game are given.
Definition 1: (V2V matching). A V2V matching Ψ is defined
as a bidirectional mapping between the set of charging EVs (i.e.,
M) and the set of discharging EVs (i.e., N) such that:
� each charging EV m ∈M is assigned to at most one dis-
charging EV, i.e., Ψ(m) ∈ N ∪ {∅} and |Ψ(m)| ∈ {0, 1}.
� each discharging EV n ∈ N is assigned to at most one
charging EV, i.e., Ψ(n) ∈M ∪ {∅} and |Ψ(n)| ∈ {0, 1}.
Definition 2: (Preference relation). If a charging EV m
prefers a discharging EV n to n′, where n, n′ ∈ N and n �= n′,
the strict preference relation �m is defined such that:
n�mn
′ ⇔ Uc
m(n) > Uc
m (n′) , (43)
whereUc
m(×) denotes the utility of charging EVm that matches
with a discharging EV×. Similarly, if a discharging EVnprefers
a charging EV m to m′, where m,m′ ∈M and m �= m′, the
strict preference relation �n is defined such that:
m�nm
′ ⇔ Ud
n(m) > Ud
n (m
′) , (44)
where Ud
n(×) denotes the utility of discharging EV n that
matches with a charging EV ×.
Definition 3: (Deferred-acceptance rule). Suppose that
charging EV m is already the accepted matching candidate of
discharging EV n in current matching iteration t (i.e.,At
n = m).
Then, in the next matching iteration, discharging EVnwill com-
pare its utilities generated by current candidate charging EVs and
its previous accepted candidate. If there is an alternative one (i.e.,
charging EV m′, m′ �= m) that satisfies m′�nm, charging EV
m′ will be chosen as the new accepted matching candidate by
discharging EV n and charging EV m will be rejected.
Definition 4: (Stable matching). A V2V matching Ψ is called
to be stable [44], if and only if there does not exist a blocking
pair (m,n), i.e.,
�(m,n), s.t. n�mΨ(m) and m�nΨ(n), (45)
where Ψ(m) �= n, Ψ(n) �= m. Here, Ψ(m) and Ψ(n) mean the
current matching pair of charging EV m and discharging EV n,
respectively.
Theorem 3: The matching Ψ∗ for all involved EVs in Algo-
rithm 1 is stable.
Proof: Refer to Appendix C. �
After acquiring the stable V2V matching Ψ∗, the matched
EV pair (m,n) resorts to the reverse auction game to choose
an optimal energy node in their common routes for energy
exchange, as shown in lines 15-16 in Algorithm 2. Unmatched
EVs can sell their superfluous energy or request the demanded
energy from nearby energy nodes.
Tier 3: Reverse auction game for matched EV pairs and energy
nodes. In the reverse auction game, each matched EV pair (i.e.,
auctioneer) purchases DWPT services from energy nodes to
realize inter-vehicle energy transfer, while each energy node
(i.e., bidder) sells its DWPT service to EVs. Here, each matched
EV pair (m,n) ∈ Ψ∗ selects the optimal energy node with the
maximum utility, i.e.,
j∗(m,n) = argmax
j∈Π
(
Uc
m +Ud
n
)
, (46)
where j∗(m,n) is the optimal energy node for EV pair (m,n).
Here, Π is the set of candidate energy nodes that can join the
auction, i.e.,
Π=
{
j|Tj(m,n)≥Tθ, χ(m,n)
j ≤χθ, j ∈ Zm ∪ Zn, j ∈ J
}
,
(47)
where Tj
(m,n) = min{Tm,j , Tn,j} is the minimum trust value
of EV m and EV n in energy node j. χ(m,n)
j is the average
distance between EV pair (m,n) and energy node j. Tθ and χθ
are the trust threshold and distance threshold of each EV pair,
respectively. Zm ∪ Zn means that energy node j is located on
the common route of EVsm and n. In the auction, the candidate
energy node whose bid price is the lowest wins the auction and
earns corresponding profits. Otherwise, its utility is zero. Hence,
the utility of energy node j ∈ J in (32) can be rewritten as the
difference between its bid price pj and its valuation cj , i.e.,
πj =
{
pj − cj , if pj < min
j∈Π
{p−j} ,
0, otherwise,
(48)
where p−j represents the bidding strategies of other candidate
energy nodes excluding energy node j. It is notable that the
bid price of a candidate energy node should be no less than
its valuation (i.e., cost) to obtain the non-negative utility, i.e.,
pj ≥ cj . For each energy node j, the cost parameter cj is private
and cannot be known by others. But other energy nodes can
estimate the cost cj with a probability distribution. Suppose that
cj follows the uniform distribution within [cmin, cmax], where
cmin and cmax are the minimum and maximum cost of energy
nodes in each DWPT service, respectively. In the auction, each
energy node aims to maximize its utility by selecting its optimal
bidding strategy, where the optimization problem of each energy
node j can be formulated as:
max
pj
E {πj} , s.t. cj ≤ pj < min
j∈Π
{p−j} . (49)
To solve (49) and obtain the optimal bidding strategy for energy
node j to win the auction, the following theorem is presented.
Theorem 4: The optimal bidding strategy of energy nodej is:
p∗j =

Next, we analyze the complexity and convergence of the
proposed GTS algorithm in the following theorems.
Theorem 5: The computational complexity of the GTS algo-
rithm is O(M 2N(logN + logM) + |Ψ∗|J log J) in the worst

case, while it yieldsO(MN(logN + logM) + |Ψ∗|J log J) in
the best case.
Proof: The GTS algorithm in Algorithm 1 consists of three
tiers. The computational complexity in tier 1 (i.e., the Stackel-
berg game process) isO(MN). In tier 2 (i.e., the V2V matching
process), the complexity in lines 7-10 is dominated by the sorting
operation and yieldsO(MN(logN + logM)). In the best case,
the V2V matching process can be terminated in a step, while
it terminates after M iterations in the worst case. Therefore,
the computational complexity in tier 2 is O(M 2N(logN +
logM)) in the worst case, and is O(MN(logN + logM))
in the best case. In tier 3 (i.e., the reverse auction process),
the complexity yields O(|Ψ∗|J log J). Therefore, Theorem 5
is proved. �
Theorem 6: The GTS algorithm is ensured to be convergent.
Proof: In Algorithm 1, the loop part only exists in the V2V
matching process. According to Theorem 3, the matching result
Ψ∗ for EVs is stable. As a result, the V2V matching process in
tier 2 is convergent. Besides, both the game processes in tiers 1
and 3 are non-loop operations. Thereby, Theorem 6 is proved.�
Remark 1: The GTS algorithm is executed by each charg-
ing/discharging EV for energy scheduling in a distributed man-
ner.
VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Simulation Setup
We utilize the SUMO simulator [45] to generate a simulation
scenario on the map of a 2 km × 2 km urban area in Belo
Horizonte, as shown in Fig. 4. There are 29 energy nodes
deployed on the road segments to deliver DWPT services and 4
RSUs to offer V2R communication services for EVs. In Fig. 4,
the power track of each energy node is denoted by the red line,
and its length is randomly selected within [10, 60]m [5]. There
are 140 EVs driving on the roads, and the ratios of charging EVs
and discharging EVs are equal to 0.5. The vehicular traces of
EVs are obtained from a modified public data set [46]. The SoC
of charging EVs is evenly distributed within [20%, 49%], while
that of discharging EVs is evenly selected in [50%, 90%]. The
minimum SoC of EV is set as 20% [7]. The ratio of legitimate
EVs is set as 70%. The rating value of a legitimate EV on
a malicious or legitimate energy node is randomly picked in
[0, 0.5] or (0.5, 1], respectively. Malicious EVs randomly give
TABLE I
SIMULATION PARAMETERS
their feedbacks to energy nodes. The satisfaction parameter of
charging EVs follows a uniform distribution between 20 and
60. The upper and lower bound of the cost for energy transfer
service (i.e., cj) are set as 2.5 cents and 10 cents, respectively. In
the trust model, we set � = 0.001, δs = 0.1, and δt = 0.5. The
Hyperledger Caliper [47], which is a widely used performance
benchmark, is employed to implement our blockchain system.
We evaluate the system performance on a PC with Ubuntu
16.04 OS, Intel Core i7-8700 CPU, 3.6 GHz, and 32 GB RAM.
The centralized approach for energy scheduling is evaluated in
Matlab along with the CVX tool. Other parameters are listed in
Table I.
B. Performance Analysis
For the blockchain system in the Caliper benchmark, we use
the following three metrics: throughput, latency, and scalability.
We define the following metrics to evaluate the performance of
the proposed scheme in terms of security and efficiency.
� Secure energy transfer ratio [48]: the ratio of wireless
energy transmission with legitimate energy nodes to the
total amount of traded energy of EVs.
� Average utility of matched charging EVs (AUC): the total
utility of charging EVs in the stable matching Ψ∗ divided
by the number of matched EV pairs.
� Average utility of matched discharging EVs (AUD): the
total utility of discharging EVs in the stable matching Ψ∗
divided by the number of matched EV pairs.
� Satisfactory EV charging ratio: It is defined byMsat/M ×
100%, where Msat is the number of charging EVs whose
energy demand has been fully satisfied in a certain time
period, and M is the total number of charging EVs in that
time period1. Here, the time period used in simulation is the
energy scheduling time of our proposed GTS algorithm.
� Unhappiness index [49]: It is defined as the number
of unhappy EV pairs in a matching, which also indi-
cates the instability of the matching. For an unhappy EV
pair (m,n), it satisfies: 1) m�nΨ(n) and n�mΨ(m),
or 2) m�nΨ(n) and Ψ(m) = ∅, or 3) n�mΨ(m) and
Ψ(n) = ∅, or 4) Ψ(m) = ∅ and Ψ(n) = ∅ [49].
1Even if the charging EV is included in the final stable matching pairs, when
its energy demand is not fully satisfied, this EV cannot be added into Msat.

TABLE II
COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME WITH EXISTING BLOCKCHAIN-BASED APPROACHES IN TRUST AND PERSONAL DATA MANAGEMENT
We compare the proposed game model with the following
conventional schemes:
� Explicit trust scheme (ETS) [50]. In ETS scheme, the trust
of energy nodes of an EV is evaluated based on its explicit
experience (i.e., direct energy interactions).
� Recommendation-based trust scheme (RTS) [21]. In RTS
scheme, the energy node’s trustworthiness of an EV is
assessed based on the rating information from other EVs
(i.e., implicit interactions).
� Game-based scheme without trust assessment (GWT). In
GWT scheme, the charging process is managed by the
proposed game model in Algorithm 1 while the trust as-
sessment is absent.
� 3D stable matching scheme. Distinguished from the 2D
V2V matching, this scheme aims to search the 3D stable
matching pairs for charging EVs, discharging EVs, and
energy nodes in a distributed manner, where the distance is
used to measure their preference. Two algorithms [51], i.e.,
Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) algorithm and
Greedy Stable Matching (GSM) algorithm are considered
to solve the 3D stable matching problem.
� Max system utility matching scheme. This scheme aims to
maximize the system utility of EVs (i.e., the overall utility
of all EVs) by building the maximum bipartite matching
between charging EVs and discharging EVs, which is
solved by the well-known Hungarian algorithm.
� Non-CWET scheme. In non-CWET scheme, each charging
EV chooses the optimal candidate energy node to re-
quest DWPT service, while the energy cooperation among
charging EVs and discharging EVs is not taken into
account.
� Matching-auction scheme (MAS) [24]. In MAS scheme,
charging and discharging EVs form stable matching pairs
through the proposed V2V matching game, and the optimal
candidate energy node is selected by the reverse auction
game. In this scheme, each charging EV randomly deter-
mines its energy demand in [0, 10] kWh, and the energy
price of each discharging EV is set as 15 cents/kWh [33].
� V2V matching scheme (MS). In MS scheme, charg-
ing/discharging EVs can exchange energy by forming EV
pairs based on the proposed V2V matching.
� Random selection scheme (RS). In RS scheme, each charg-
ing EV randomly selects the discharging EV and energy
node to connect, while the energy demands of charging
EVs and energy prices of discharging EVs are picked at
random.
Table II shows the comparison of the proposed scheme with
existing blockchain-based approaches in trust computing and

personal data management. Compared with existing blockchain-
based trust schemes [21], [50], our proposed scheme further
considers the privacy protection in personal rating or recom-
mendation data collection during trust computing. Besides, we
consider both explicit trust and implicit trust in trustworthiness
evaluation, and compare the security performance with [21],
[50] in Figs. 5 and 6. In existing blockchain-based personal data
management schemes [23], [52], both the encrypted data pointer
(e.g., hash value for data addressing) of personal dataset and the
corresponding decryption key are shared to data requesters. In
this case, as the data address is still held by data requesters, the
personal data can still be accessible even if the data requester’s
access right has been revoked. Instead, in our work, only the
encrypted pointer is sent to authorized data requester, while the
decryption key is shared to the data store. Therefore, in our
work, the data requester cannot access the particular user data
if its access has been revoked. In addition, the data store cannot
query the particular user data without the encrypted pointer.
Fig. 5 shows the evaluation of the average trust value of
malicious and legitimate energy nodes in three schemes. We
can observe that the proposed scheme achieves a higher average
trust value for legitimate energy nodes and a lower one for
malicious energy nodes, compared with ETS and RTS schemes.
It is because our proposed scheme comprehensively considers

number of EVs.
direct and indirect energy interactions, time decay effect, and
social effect in trust computing. Besides, in Fig. 5, the average
trust value of malicious energy nodes decreases over time while
that of legitimate energy nodes increases.
Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the proposed scheme with
other three conventional schemes in terms of secure energy
transfer ratio (STR), where the ratio of legitimate energy nodes
changes from 0.2 to 0.8. In this simulation, two values of simu-
lation time are exploited, i.e., τ = 1000 s and τ = 2000 s. It can
be seen that, given the simulation time τ , the proposed scheme
outperforms the other three schemes in attaining a better STR
even if the ratio of legitimate energy nodes is low. The reason
is that in GWT scheme, due to the absence of trust evaluation,
the selected candidate energy nodes for DWPT services may
be malicious. In ETS scheme, since EV users only evaluate
the trustworthiness of energy nodes based on their own expe-
riences from their limited historical interactions, the evaluation
results may be inaccurate especially when their interactions are
infrequent. In RTS scheme, as both the direct historical and
the social effect is absent, the trust evaluation results may also
be inaccurate. In the proposed scheme, by considering explicit
and implicit trust assessment, dynamic weight adjustment, and
social effects, EV users can attain a more accurate result about
the energy provider’s trustworthiness. Thereby, trustworthy en-
ergy nodes can be selected with high probability during energy
transmission, and particularly our proposal attains safer DWPT
services for EVs. Fig. 7 shows the throughput and latency of our
blockchain system vs. scalability when the number of EVs varies
from 30 to 180. In this benchmark, the throughput can reach
highest to 490 tps, the latency is less than 8 s, and high scalability
is achieved. As seen in Fig. 7, when the number of EVs increases,
the system throughput first increases with a relatively fast speed
then decreases with a relatively slow speed. The reason is that
transactions are queued at RSU’s buffer and there exists a local
processing bottleneck. As a result, when the number of EVs is
large (i.e., ≥ 90), the throughput tends to decrease while the
latency keeps increase.
Figs. 8 and 9 show the comparison of the proposed scheme
with conventional MAS, MS, RS, and centralized schemes in
terms of AUC and AUD. From Figs. 8 and 9, we can observe
that the proposed scheme results in the smallest gap with the
centralized approach in terms of AUC and AUD, compared
with MAS, MS, and RS schemes. This is because in MAS
scheme, each EV cannot decide the optimal energy demand
strategy to optimize its benefit. In both MS and RS schemes, EVs
randomly choose their energy demand and pricing strategies,

ized schemes in terms of AUC.

ized schemes in terms of AUD.

causing that their utilities are not the maximum. In the pro-
posed scheme, through the joint Stackelberg-matching-auction
game, both charging EVs and discharging EVs in VEN can
determine the optimal energy demand and price strategies, form
optimal matching pairs, and choose the optimal energy nodes
to exchange energy. Consequently, the utilities of EVs can be
maximized in our proposal under the distributed scenario.
Fig. 10 depicts the evolution of EV’s utility and the number
of matched EV pairs with respect to the iterations in V2V
matching. In this simulation, we set M = 100 and N = 100,
and other settings keep unchanged. From Fig. 10, it can be
observed that the proposed scheme can quickly converge to a
stable V2V matching in 4 iterations, and the number of stable
matched EVs reaches a stable value 64. Moreover, both the
utilities of charging/discharging EVs keep increasing before
reaching the stable value. The reason is that both charging EVs
and discharging EVs can improve their utilities by establishing
and updating their preference lists to form optimal matching
pairs in the V2V matching process.
Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the system utility of EVs and the
unhappiness index in max system utility matching and our V2V
stable matching, respectively. As seen in Figs. 11 and 12, the

matching and V2V stable matching.
max system utility matching attains a higher system utility of
EVs while yielding a much larger unhappiness index than the
proposed V2V stable matching. It is because the max system
utility matching aims to optimize the overall system utility of
EVs while ignoring EVs’ preferences (i.e., Γt
m and Γt
n) in the
matching. Thus, part of EVs may left unassigned or form the
blocking pair (in Definition 4), causing a higher unhappiness
index. In opposite, the proposed V2V stable matching aims
to satisfy EVs’ preferences as much as possible and eliminate
blocking pairs by using the deferred acceptance rule (in Defini-
tion 3), resulting in a lower unhappiness index.
Fig. 13 shows the optimal bid price p∗j of an energy node and
the auction latency given different number of candidate energy
nodes and the maximum cost cmax for each DWPT service. We
can observe that the optimal bid price decreases as the number
of candidate energy nodes increases. Meanwhile, p∗j increases
with the increase of the maximum service cost. The reason is
that, according to (50) in Theorem 4, if the number of candidate
energy nodes becomes larger or the maximum service cost is
smaller, each energy node tends to lower its bid price to win
the auction in the competitive environment. Besides, the auction
latency mainly contains the bidding collection time and bidding

sorting time. As shown in Fig. 12, the auction can be quickly
completed in less than 4 ms.
Fig. 14 compares the proposed scheme with the non-CWET
scheme in terms of satisfactory EV charging ratio, where the
energy capacity of ESD in each energy node varies from 100 to
250 kWh. From Fig. 14, it can be seen that the proposed scheme
which operates in CWET mode can attain a much higher satis-
factory EV charging ratio (SCR) than the non-CWET scheme. It
can be explained as follows. In the non-CWET scheme, without
considering the discharging EVs during energy management,
EVs with charging requests can only acquire energy resources
from energy nodes. Additionally, due to the limitation in energy
capacity of ESD at energy nodes, part of EVs may not attain
well-pleasing energy resources, resulting in a low SCR. In the
proposed approach, discharging EVs can collaboratively share
their redundant battery energy with neighboring charging EVs
and establish the best V2V matching pairs, resulting in a high
SCR for EVs. Besides, in Fig. 11, the achieved range extension of
EVs increases when the energy conversion efficiency increases
or the energy capacity of ESD increases. It is because the higher
energy conversion efficiency, the more rated power is transferred
to EVs. In addition, the higher energy capacity of ESD, the

more energy can be stored to support more DWPT services
concurrently.
Table III shows the comparison of the proposed scheme with
existing 3D stable matching approaches. In the uniform pricing,
the service price of energy nodes is the same (i.e., 3.8 cents). In
the random pricing, the service price is randomly selected in [2,
5.6] cents. As seen in Table III, MWIS gains high accuracy in
solving the 3D matching problem but yields high computational
inefficiency. Meanwhile, GSM is more efficient but suffers low
accuracy in searching the optimal 3D stable matching, which
causing lower average utilities for both EVs and energy nodes
than MWIS. In opposite, our hierarchical game has the small-
est computational complexity. Moreover, as energy nodes can
optimize their pricing strategies in our approach, the average
utility of energy nodes is the highest. Besides, as MWIS and
GSM focus on EV users’ preferences (e.g., driving distance) in
3D matching and employ unadjustable and relatively low service
price of energy nodes, EVs can attain a relatively higher average
utility in MWIS and GSM than our proposal.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a secure and privacy-
preserving wireless charging scheme to safeguard and facilitate
efficient energy exchange among EVs and energy nodes in
VENs. First, a blockchain-based personal data management
mechanism with off-chain data storage has been presented to
enable fine-grained access control for EV users’ sensitive rating
datasets. Second, a distributed trust model has been designed in
the blockchain to identify malicious energy nodes and secure
DWPT services or EVs. By introducing the CWET mode, a
hierarchical game-theoretical algorithm has been further devel-
oped to promote cooperation and maximize the utilities of the
three energy entities in VENs. The optimal energy demand and
pricing strategies, stable matching pairs, and optimal energy
nodes can be derived. Simulation results have demonstrated that
the proposed scheme can efficiently improve the utility of users,
and effectively protect security in energy transfer, compared
with conventional schemes. For the future work, we will further
extend this work by considering the load profile shaping of power
systems and the uncertainty of EV’s driving pattern including the
optimal route selection during energy scheduling in VENs. In
addition, we will study the implementation of energy scheduling
algorithms in smart contracts with privacy preservation func-
tions for EVs.

APPENDIX B
PROOF OF THEOREM 2
Proof: Substituting x∗m,n =
βmTm,n
pm,n+ϑγc
m
− 1
ηm
into (31), the
utility function of discharging EV n can be rewritten as:
Ud
n(x

m,n, pm,n)=
(
pm,n−ϑγdn
)( βmTm,n
pm,n + ϑγcm

ηm
)
− pj

.
(51)
The second derivative of Ud
n(x
∗
m,n, pm,n) with respect to
pm,n satisfies
∂2Ud
n(x
∗
m,n,pm,n)
∂pm,n
2 < 0, which indicates that
Ud
n(x
∗
m,n, pm,n) is strictly convex in pm,n. By adjusting system
parameters, the following inequality can be guaranteed to be
hold:
lim
pm,n→0
∂Ud

(
x∗m,n, pm,n
)
∂pm,n
=
βmTm,nϑ
(
γcm + γdn

(pm,n + ϑγcm)2

ηm
> 0. (52)
We can further derive limpm,n→∞
∂Ud
n(x
∗
m,n,pm,n)
∂pm,n
= − 1
ηm
< 0.
Thus, the optimal price strategy of discharging EV n can be
resolved by
∂Ud
n(x
∗
m,n,pm,n)
∂pm,n
= 0. This completes the proof. �
APPENDIX C
PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Proof: If |M| ≤ |N|, the V2V matching algorithm ends as
soon as |M| discharging EVs have been sent charging request.
Otherwise, if |M| > |N|, our matching algorithm terminates
when each charging EV is either on a discharging EV’s ac-
ceptance list or has been rejected by all the discharging EVs.
Therefore, in both cases, the V2V matching game in Algorithm 1
is convergent. Without loss of generality, suppose that EV n and
EV n′ separately adopt EV m and EV m′ in the final matching
results Ψ∗ of Algorithm 1. Next, we prove the stability of the
matching game by contradiction. Assume that a blocking pair
(m,′ n) exists in Ψ∗, such that EV n prefers EV m′ to EV m,
while EV m′ prefers EV n to EV n′. Then, according to lines
5-13 in Algorithm 1, EV m′ should be assigned to EV n, which
contradicts the primary assumption. Thus, any blocking pair
does not exist in Ψ∗, and the matching outcome of Algorithm 1
is stable. Theorem 3 is proved. �
APPENDIX D
PROOF OF THEOREM 4
Proof: For energy node j, its bidding strategy is given by
pj = νj(cj). Since each energy node is rational, pj increases
with the increase of cj . We defineϕ(pj) = ν−1
j (cj) as the inverse
function of νj(cj). The probability that energy node j wins the
auction can be formulated as:
Prj =
∏|Π|−1
k=1,k �=j
Pr (pj < pk) =
(∫ cmax
ϕ(pj)
f(u)du
)|Π|−1
.

The optimization problem in (49) can be rewritten as:
max
pj
E {πj} = max
pj
{Prj · (pj − cj) + 0 · (1− Prj)} . (54)
The first derivative of E{πj} with respect to pj is
dE {πj}
dpj
=
(∫ cmax
ϕ(pj)
f(u)du
)|Π|−1
− (|Π| − 1)
×
(∫ cmax
ϕ(pj)
f(u)du
)|Π|−2
f (ϕ (pj))ϕ(pj)
′ (pj − cj) . (55)
If pj is the optimal bid price of energy node j, we have ϕ(pj) =
ν−1
j (pj) = cj . Let dE{πj}
dpj
= 0, we can obtain∫ cmax
cj
f(u)du = (|Π| − 1) f (cj) cj
′ (pj − cj) . (56)
Let Ξ(cj) =
∫ cmax
cj
f(u)du, we have Ξ(cj)− (|Π| − 1)
(pj − cj)f(cj) dcjdpj
= 0. Furthermore, we have
dpj
dcj
− pjΛ = −cjΛ, (57)
where Λ = (|Π| − 1) f(cj)Ξ(cj)
. By solving (57), the optimal bid
price of energy node j is p∗j = e
∫
Λdcj
∫ −cjΛe∫ −Λdcjdcj .
Since cj is uniformly distributed within [cmin, cmax], we have
f(cj)
Ξ(cj)
= 1
cmax−cj . Furthermore, we have
e
∫
Λdcj = e
∫ |Π|−1
cmax−cj dcj = (cmax − cj)−(|Π|−1),
(58)∫
−cjΛe
∫−Λdcjdcj=cj(cmax−cj)|Π|−1+
(cmax−cj)|Π|
|Π| .
(59)
Then, the optimal bid price of energy node j can be reformulated
as p∗j =
(|Π|−1)cj + cmax
|Π| . With (33), p∗j can be obtained as given
in (50). This completes the proof. �
