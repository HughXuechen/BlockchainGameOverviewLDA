Abstract— The market value of the gaming industry in 
2021 is said to be more than 198.40 billion USD. Market value 
is also supported by the number of gamers, with 4.75 billion in 
January 2022. In today's In-App Purchase (IAP) income 
method has become a big trend in today's modern era models 
of free-to-play games, where gamers can choose or buy many 
items during the game to speed up the progress of the game or 
enjoy the full content of the game. However, sometimes players 
are overwhelmed with the number of items on offer, making it 
difficult for players to choose because the game content is too 
diverse. In addition, players are also worried about the security 
of their digital assets because, in 2021, there will be 7.5 million 
digital assets lost due to hacking. We propose a 
recommendation system to make it easier for players to choose 
items that suit their playstyle to solve this problem. We use the 
multi-criteria recommender system (MCRS) method because 
this method can improve the accuracy of recommendations 
compared to conventional recommendations that only use one 
criterion. In this study, we used eight criteria to calculate the 
recommendations. The results of our recommendation test 
show the accuracy value = 0.71, precision = 0.76, recall = 0.71 
and F1 score = 0.66. To address security issues, we propose the 
implementation of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for each item. 
NFT can increase security because it uses a decentralized 
blockchain architecture in which every transaction is 
encrypted. The system guarantees that the assets will remain 
online so that users do not risk losing ownership of their assets 
when the developer changes game data, or the game server 
closes. 
Keywords—Game Industry, In-App Purchase, Multi-Criteria 
Recommender System, Non-Fungible Token, Blockchain. 
I. INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) 
Game Development is one of the most important 
businesses in the Entertainment Industry, with more than 
198.40 billion USD in 2021 [1]. This revenue is also 
supported by a growing audience, with more than 4.75 
billion gamers worldwide in January 2022 [2]. The growth 
results from various marketing strategies of developers to 
increase their income. These strategies are, for example, 
prepayment games that get full game content on an initial 
payment and Free games that have a whole range, but 
players need to make in-app purchases if they have advanced 
needs [3]. The eMarketer survey [4] shows that in-App 
purchases (IAP) will become a big trend. IAP is also 
supported by statistics on the increasing number of in-app 
purchase revenues every year [5]. However, sometimes, 
players are overwhelmed with the number of items on offer 
and the variety of playstyles. This leads players to find it 
challenging to improve their game progress because the 
game content is too difficult.  
One way to help make it easier for players to choose 
appropriate content is to use a recommendation system [6]. 
The recommendation system can help prevent this problem 
by offering items that match the player's preferences and 
play style, improving the purchase and in-game experience 
[7]. The system can ultimately increase revenue by 
increasing player retention and conversion from user free to 
play to pay to play [8]. However, in implementing In-App-
Purchase sales, a large amount of money is lost from 
downloading or duplicating assets illegally [9]. Based on 
Apsalar research, 7.5 million virtual assets are lost due to 
fraud and hacking [10]. In addition, players are also worried 
about losing ownership of their assets when developers 
change game data or close game servers [11]. 
There is a solution to improve system security described 
in the research of Chia-Hung et al. [12] by using blockchain 
architecture. The study explains the decentralized blockchain 
architecture, where every transaction made is encrypted, and 
every transaction data nature cannot be changed and deleted, 
allowing for better data security. Christos et al. [11] 
explained that the reward mechanism in most games, 
including eSports, is usually controlled by game developers, 
and these prizes have no exchange value in the real world. 
The use of NTF can allow changes in the ownership 
mechanism of digital assets that players entirely hold, and 
each asset has an exchange value in the real world. This 
system guarantees that the asset will stay online, so users do 
not risk losing control of the digital asset or its value, even if 
the game company loses interest or goes bankrupt. 
In this study, the MCRS recommendation system (Multi-
Criteria-Recommender-System) will be used, which will 
perform calculations on player data with previous player data 
that has been recorded in the database. This method will 
generate item recommendations according to the data of 
players who have similar playstyles. Furthermore, for NFT-
based In-App-Purchase implementation, we propose 
blockchain with the Ethereum platform. This research is 
expected to make it easier for players to choose the 
appropriate game items. The NFT method is also expected to 
create a complete digital asset ownership mechanism and 
have a sound security system.

II. RELATED WORK 
A more efficient way to turn casual players who don't 
buy stuff into item buyers is to use the in-app purchase 
model. The concept is different from traditional payment 
methods or prepayments, where the user pays for the game 
and then plays it [13, 14]. In-app purchases provide a 
recurring revenue stream for game developers. Therefore, it 
is essential to analyze in-app purchase patterns and 
determine how to increase monetization [15].  
A recommendation system is an essential method for 
increasing income [17]. In the research conducted by Arif et 
al. [19], In order to create suggestion ratings that players 
might use as a guide while selecting tourist attractions in 
halal tourism games, a multi-criteria recommender system 
(MCRS) method was employed. The effectiveness of 
traditional tourism recommendation systems, which are 
frequently based on a single criterion, is improved by using 
this Method In this study, the authors calculate the 
recommendation system in the halal tourism game using 
eight destination rating factors as a guide. Each of these 
criteria becomes a reference for how travellers evaluate 
Indonesia's halal travel locations. However, centralized data 
architecture is prone to data theft, hacking, and data loss 
when the server is turned off [20]. 
In Christos Karapapas' research, Non-Fungible Tokens 
(NFT) were used to provide a flexible, decentralized, and fair 
basis structure for trading games. The author created a fully 
decentralized system, where the player entirely holds the 
digital asset ownership model. The concept allows game 
assets to be resold and valued based on their rarity and 
utility. It also gives players a benefit without the requirement 
for a reliable third party. Players don't run the danger of 
losing control of the digital asset or its value even if the 
game company loses interest in it or goes out of business 
because the system ensures that it will remain online. [11, 
21]. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
This study has several objectives, including making an 
In-App Purchase item recommendation system to make it 
easier for prospective buyers to determine the items to be 
purchased. The goal is to affect the number of item sales 
because players’ ease in choosing things to buy also 
increases the possibility of selling items. In addition, this 
research also aims to improve transaction security by using a 
decentralized blockchain network. Items purchased by 
players will be mined into NFT format and broadcast to a 
blockchain network encrypted in each block. The NTF 
format also gives players full ownership of the purchased 
items. Items also have real-world exchange rates that can be 
exchanged for other currencies. 
The game platform that we made is based on personal 
computers (PC). We chose that platform because most 
MMORPG games are on the PC platform, including the 
games we use as the reference for this research. The game 
engine we use for the development process is Unity, Visual 
Studio as a script editor, Blender 3D as a 3D modeler, and 
metamask for crypto wallet management. The blockchain 
network platform used in this research is Ethereum, the 
network that will accommodate the NFT data needed for this 
game. The following subsection will explain the program 
flow, NFT implementation, and MCRS performance.

As seen in Figure 1 of the game scenario design 
flowchart, the process starts with logging in for players who 
already have an account. Registering is for players who do 
not have an account. After the process is complete, the player 
will be directed to the main menu page. This game has three 
game menu options, Battle mode, Profile, and Shop. 
• Battle Scenario is a game mode where players must 
defeat enemies to gain experience, which is used to level 
up. By leveling up, players will get skill points which are 
used to increase stats. 
• The Shop menu is a page where players can buy the 
items they want. A recommendation system will help 
players determine which item best suits the character's 
current condition.  
• The profile menu is a page that displays information on 
characters such as statistical parameters, list items, and 
levels. Players can allocate skill points to increase 
statistical parameters and equip their items on this page. 
1) Multi-criteria recommender system 
In this study, we propose using MCRS as a method for 
generating item recommendations that are visualized through 
a list of items on the Shop page in the game. In this study, 
the parameters that affect the results of the recommendations 
are character statistics and item ratings. Figure 4 below 
shows two parts that affect the MCRS process. The character 
progression part is the process of players increasing levels by 
defeating enemies and will get skill points when leveling up. 
These skill points can be used to increase the character's 
stats. When the stats change, the recommendation calculation 
will also change. In the recommender system section, an 
MCRS calculation works based on item usage data based on 
statistics and item ratings from previous players in the game. 
In MMORPG games, the player's playstyle is strongly 
influenced by the statistics they have because every playstyle 
played must be supported by the appropriate statistics. 
Therefore, two criteria will be used to calculate 
recommendations in this study. 
 
Figure 4 flow Multi-criteria recommender system 
The first step in calculating the MCRS is to calculate the 
similarity value of player μ with all previous player μ'. To 
find the similarity results sim(μ,μ') we use a cosine-based 
similarity calculation with the formula for Eq. (1). Where 
I(μ,μ') is the item rated by player μ and μ', and R(μ,i) is the 
rating from user μ for item i. 
 
𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝜇𝜇, 𝜇𝜇′) =
∑ 𝑅𝑅(𝑢𝑢, 𝑠𝑠)𝑅𝑅(𝜇𝜇′, 𝑠𝑠)𝑖𝑖∈𝐼𝐼(𝜇𝜇,𝜇𝜇′)
�∑ 𝑅𝑅(𝑢𝑢, 𝑠𝑠)2𝑖𝑖∈𝐼𝐼(𝜇𝜇,𝜇𝜇′)  �∑ 𝑅𝑅(𝑢𝑢, 𝑠𝑠)2𝑖𝑖∈𝐼𝐼(𝜇𝜇,𝜇𝜇′)
  (1) 
Table 1 Criteria Table 
Criteria Description  Criteria Description 
P1 Strength  R1 Damage 
P2 Dexterity  R2 Attack Speed 
P3 Vitality  R3 Combo 
P4 Agility  R4 Weapon Skill 
P5 Intelligence  R5 Match Playstyle 
P6 Wisdom  R6 Match With Stats 
P7 Level  R7 Cooldown Skill 
P0 Overall  R0 Overall 
 
 The next step is to calculate the average equation 
(𝜇𝜇, 𝜇𝜇′)𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
  each rating obtained from the previous calculation 
between the player 𝜇𝜇 and the previous player 𝜇𝜇′  as in Eq. 
(2). In the similarity calculation𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐(𝜇𝜇, 𝜇𝜇′), the similarity 
value of each criterion c is obtained between the player 𝜇𝜇 and 
the previous player 𝜇𝜇′ . Using average similarity, the 
similarity value of the player with the previous player has a 
higher result. The value of n is the number of criteria that get 
a rating from the user. 
𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝜇𝜇, 𝜇𝜇′) =  
1
𝑛𝑛 + 1
� 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐(𝜇𝜇, 𝜇𝜇′)
𝑛𝑛
𝑐𝑐=0
     (2) 
After the system gets the similarity value of player 𝜇𝜇 with 
each previous player 𝜇𝜇′, the next step is to rank all similarity 
values to get the highest value. The system assumes that the 
player 𝜇𝜇′ with the highest score is the closest to the player 𝜇𝜇. 
Then the following process is rating prediction, which takes 
the overall rating value of R0 for each item that is the most 
similar, then that value is filled into the data item player 𝜇𝜇, 
which is still empty. The last step is to generate Top-N 
recommendations. The system sorts R0 values for player 𝜇𝜇, 
and produces a sequence of R0 values for all items from the 
highest to the lowest. 
B. NFT Implementation 
 
Figure 5 Flow Creation NFT 
This section discusses the implementation of NFT smart 
contracts on the In-App Purchase mechanism. The 
blockchain platform used is ethereum. To make an NFT 
contract, a standard token protocol that Ethereum has 
approved is required. In this study, the ERC-1155 standard 
token will be used. The newest token specification on the 
Ethereum Blockchain is ERC-1155. It adheres to a global 
standard and supports both fungible (ERC-20) and non-
fungible (ERC-721) features. 
NFT also supports transparency and long-term data 
storage, which means the history of the data will be visible 
and accessible to everyone on the network. Data security is 
also maintained because there is an encryption process in 
216

every transaction made. In contrast to the centralized 
network that can only be accessed as long as the service is 
running, the decentralized NFT network allows data to 
remain active. Even if the game developer closes the game 
service, it will not be lost. The following is the process of 
applying NFT in this research. 
• The first is Smart Contract Logic Script Writing. The 
logic used includes NFT creation functions, NFT 
transfers, NFT stock additions, and several other 
functions. 
• The following process is deploying the smart contract 
into the Ethereum developer account. The process so that 
the developer owns the smart contract. 
• Next is the process of integrating Ethereum into the Unity 
engine. 
• The following process is the integration of Smart 
Contracts into unity. This integration process is carried 
out by converting smart contracts into a format that can 
be read in C#. After the conversion process is complete, 
the functions in the smart contract can be run on the 
Unity engine. 
IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
This chapter will discuss the testing of the IAP 
recommendation system using the Multi-criteria 
recommender system. There are tests for accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1 values. This chapter will also discuss the 
implementation of NFT in this game. There is a test of gas 
price, time process, and results of NFT transactions.   
A. Gameplay Visualization 
This section aims to show the results of implementing 
and visualizing an NFT-based recommendation system in an 
Action-RPG game. Figure 6 shows the main menu display, 
which is the main navigation for players to play this game. 
Figure 7 is a display of recommended items from the MCRS 
calculation results. Figure 8 is a display of rating data input. 
Figure 9 is a battle gameplay view where the player must 
defeat the opponent to level up. 
B. MCRS result 
This test is performed to assess the accuracy and 
precision of the resulting recommendation system. Based on 
the following equation, this test employs a matrix 
configuration to generate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 
scores.

According to the algorithm above, TP (True Positive) is 
the number of things recommended by both the system and 
the players. TN (True Negative) is the total quantity of things 
that the players and system do not recommend. Additionally, 
FP (False Positive) is the quantity of items the system 
recommends but does not include in the list the player 
recommends. Simultaneously, FN (False Negative) refers to 
the amount of items suggested by players but not included in 
the system's recommendation rating.

Two test scenarios are used in this test. The first is 
determined by the amount of items rated by the player. The 
second is dependent on the player's various input ratings. 
Figure 10 compares precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 for 
the first case, and Figure 11 displays the outcomes for the

C. NFT Implementation 
This test is carried out to test whether the NFT system is 
running according to its functionality. The test carried out is 
to transfer the NFT to other accounts 20 times. In addition, 
gas price efficiency tests will also be carried out to minimize 
the costs that must be paid for each transaction.

Figure 12 Average accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores. 
• Gas Price Test 
Gas Price is the rate that must be paid by the person who 
makes the transaction to the person who has succeeded in 
mining. Gas price is the amount of gas fee multiplied by the 
gas used, and the gas is the computational process carried 
out. The following are the results of transaction testing based 
on several gas prices. 
• Gas Limit Test 
Gas limit testing is performed to determine the minimum 
gas limit used in this case when sending score data as a 
transaction. The selection of the appropriate gas is also an 
important factor in the success of transactions on the 
Ethereum blockchain network. The results of the gas limit 
test used in the study are shown in Figure 13. The minimum 
gas limit can be used in in-game transactions, with a 
maximum success rate of 400,000 gas. 
 
 
Figure 13 Gas Price Testing Result 
 
Figure 14 Gas Limit Testing Result 
By testing the gas price and gas limit, the optimal 
arrangement of NFT transactions is obtained. The percentage 
of successful transactions will be even more significant with 
these settings. Figure 15 is the result of the NFT transaction 
accessed via the Opensea website.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we developed a recommendation system to 
assist players in selecting items that suit their playstyle. We 
use the MCRS method by using a dataset from the previous 
player rating input. The MCRS in this study uses two 
criteria types. The first is based on the results of the input

rating  𝑅𝑅0,𝑅𝑅1,𝑅𝑅2,𝑅𝑅3,𝑅𝑅4,𝑅𝑅5,𝑅𝑅6,𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎 𝑅𝑅7.  Furthermore, the 
second criterion comes from the player's statistical 
values 𝑇𝑇0,𝑇𝑇1,𝑇𝑇2,𝑇𝑇3,𝑇𝑇4,𝑇𝑇5,𝑇𝑇6,𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎 𝑇𝑇7 . The dataset will be 
the reference data for the item recommendation results. 
 
We developed an Action RPG game using the Unity 
Engine in the implementation process. We make adventure 
games that aim to defeat enemies to earn money and level 
up. Testing the recommendation system shows that the 
number of input ratings and the composition of the input 
ratings affects the results obtained. The test results show that 
the average values for MCRS are 0.71 for accuracy, 0.72 for 
precision, 0.71 for recall, and 0.66 for F1 score. While the 
greatest recommendation value yields the following results: 
accuracy = 0.83, precision = 0.77, recall = 0.76, and F1 
score = 0.71. In the NFT test, it can be seen that the 
difference in gas price affects the transaction speed. The 
more expensive the transaction fee will also increase the 
transaction speed. Meanwhile, in the gas limit test, the 
optimal value was obtained at 400,000.
