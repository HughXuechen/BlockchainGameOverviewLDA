Abstract— Cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communica-
tion is expected to herald the age of autonomous vehicles in
the coming years. With the integration of blockchain in such
networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete
blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles
at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected
to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of
cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distrib-
uted ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks
hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable
the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale
platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks
in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may
try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select
the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause con-
gestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources.
To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for
balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness
among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency
requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength
transmission which is more practical compared to the use of
infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with
our proposed offloading framework show improved performance
over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.

I. INTRODUCTION
BLOCKCHAIN is a technology that leverages the sub-
tle interaction of multiple data structures and incen-
tive mechanisms. In isolation, the various components that
comprise the blockchain are well known and in some cases
have existed for years [1]. The novelty of blockchain stems
from a combination of these elements that could be applied
to different applications ranging from cryptocurrencies to
smart contracts, and from resource management to differential

privacy. The rapid success of blockchain has generated a lot
of interest in the design principles employed in the devel-
opment of large-scale systems. This, in turn, has prompted
researchers in academia and industry to critically reassess
traditional methods used to process information [2]. The goal
is to determine the extent to which the architectural aspects
of blockchain might be replicated in analogous scenarios to
reduce or eliminate current inefficiencies.
The integration of blockchain with cellular vehicle-to-
everything (V2X) communications is expected to revolu-
tionize intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), in terms
of enriched travel experiences, on-road safety services, and
transportation efficiency [3]. Generally speaking, the V2X
communication enabled by a cellular infrastructure is known
as cellular V2X and encompasses the inter-vehicle (V2V)
communications, vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communica-
tions, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications [4].
The efficient architecture of blockchain and the coopera-
tive/interactive nature of cellular V2X communications can
solve various resource-related issues. Blockchain-based cellu-
lar V2X communications can also overcome the conventional
resource-constrained barriers (such as security and privacy
costs) and can improve real-time exchange of information,
spectrum allocation, and mobile offloading. Recent advances
in blockchain-based vehicular communications have opened
up opportunities in various areas of vehicular communications.
This includes IEEE 802.11p based vehicular networks where
blockchain is used for authentication and key management [5]
and cellular V2X networks for guaranteeing security [6], [7].
Some other important areas include efficient and transparent
energy trading between electric vehicles and grid stations,
and reliable platoon management for autonomous vehicles [8].
Additionally, blockchain-enabled vehicles can act as secure
and trustworthy data collection platforms for transportation
authorities.
Mining is an important process in blockchain technology
for securing the validity and integrity of transactions [9].
There are two types of mining schemes, i.e., solo mining
and pool/cluster mining [10]. As the name suggests, cluster
mining involves multiple miners to mine a block, whereas,
solo mining is performed individually. Regardless of the
mining approach, mining a block is a computation-intensive
and resource-demanding task, especially for wireless vehicular
networks. To improve mining efficiency, the mining task can
be offloaded to nearby vehicles. This work proposes a mining

A. Related Work
Vehicular communication is a significantly mature concept
and has been extensively explored in the literature. Perfor-
mance analysis and the evaluation of vehicular communica-
tions were some of the key areas of interest for researchers
initially. Some of these studies focused on the deterministic
evaluation of performance while others focused on the wire-
less channel characterization for inter-vehicle communications
[11]–[14]. However, these studies lack the fundamentals of
exchanging data between the vehicle and the infrastructure
and they used relatively simplistic spatial modeling techniques.
To extend these studies, Guha first performed the analysis for
cellular V2X communication [15]. Specifically, they analyzed
the association probabilities of the vehicle and proposed a
maximum-power association technique to enhance network
performance. From the perspective of resource optimization,
some studies on cellular V2X communications also exist
where the authors considered a unicast communication par-
adigm for guaranteeing the sum-rate for V2X communication
[16]. Similarly, the authors of [17] proposed a resource allo-
cation solution to maximize the service rate of the network
users while Masmoudi et al. reduces the latency of V2X
communication to support driver safety applications [18].
From the perspective of blockchain networks, some recent
works have focused on resource allocation in wireless commu-
nications. For instance, Novo presented a novel architecture for
access management [19]. They address the scalability issue of
blockchain and noted that the forking in blockchain networks
may take place due to different delays. They proposed to
use some blockchain nodes in the network as management
hubs. These management hubs can be distributed across the
blockchain network and provide the much-needed flexibility
to adapt to various communication scenarios. Lee et al. [20]
proposed a blockchain-based solution for reducing the ineffi-
ciency associated with the energy consumption of blockchain
networks. In another work, the authors of [9] proposed a
solution to minimize forking events using machine learning.
From the perspective of secure offloading of data, Muthanna
et al. provided a software-defined solution [6]. They proposed
a novel algorithm that can be used to offload the data to
OpenFlow switches. Nguyen et al. in [21] argued that a
task that is offloaded to the cloud may become vulnerable
to different types of attacks. Thus, they proposed a deep
reinforcement learning solution to efficiently offload the task
to other devices without compromising the security. Task
offloading in blockchain networks have also attracted attention
recently. Recent solutions based on machine learning [22],
reinforcement learning [23], and stable matching [24] have
been proposed to ensure efficient offloading and preserve
privacy in edge networks.
Although there many studies on blockchain-based vehicular
communications [25], [26], only a few works focus on the
mining task offloading aspects of such networks. For instance,
Sharma in [27] focused on energy-efficient offloading of data
for Internet-of-vehicles (IoV). They showed that their proposed
model optimally controls the number of transactions in a
distributed manner. Similarly, the authors of [7], [28] proposed
an energy-efficient trading solution for vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
communications. They developed an iterative convex-concave
algorithm to address the social welfare optimization problem
in blockchain-based vehicular networks. Here, the social wel-
fare measures the optimal quality of resources allocated in
the network. In [29], the authors proposed energy and proof-
of-work aware offloading mechanism for vehicular ad-hoc
networks (VANETs) while the authors of [30] proposed an
adaptive participation scheme for charging the electric vehicles
from the smart grid. Other studies [31]–[33] also loosely focus
on the task offloading aspect of blockchain-based vehicular
communications, but their main focus is still on security
and energy efficiency aspect of such networks. The review
of these various recent works demonstrates that there are
only a few works [31]–[33] on mining task offloading in
the literature of blockchain-based vehicular communications.
However, the focus of these studies is not on finite blocklength
which is not practical for mission-critical applications [34]
because most practical systems work in finite blocklength
regime. As a feasible solution, the finite blocklength approach
is being rapidly adopted for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency
vehicular communications [35]. In this work, we aim to
identify the performance limits of vehicular communications
in finite blocklength regime and propose a solution to address
the mining task offloading problem for blockchain-enabled
V2X communications.
B. Motivation and Contribution
Motivated by the above-mentioned studies, we anticipate
that the interchange of homogeneous data facilitated by
blockchain technologies, is the catalyst needed to transform the
ideas of blockchain-enabled autonomous vehicles into practice
because of peer-to-peer and distributed nature of blockchain.
However, before the full realization of such autonomous
vehicles, there is a need to further explore and solve the
challenges associated with the blockchain-based cellular V2X
communications. One such challenge is the execution of
mining tasks and the issues related to offloading such tasks to
the mining cluster. The initiatives described in this work are
attempts at breaking down the nascent data silos generated by
cellular V2X communications in the blockchain ecosystem.
In the process, we aim to provide a feasible solution for
selecting the appropriate mining cluster for offloading the
mining tasks. We summarize our main research contributions
as follows:
1) We consider a practical finite blocklength (number
of wireless channel uses) transmission architecture
for blockchain-based cellular V2X communications.
This guarantees low-latency transmission due to the
short blocklength. However, it suffers from non-zero
decoding error probability. To the best of our knowl-
edge, such finite blocklength transmission has not yet
been considered for blockchain-based cellular V2X
communications.

via backhaul links. The BSs serve different vehicles in the coverage region and manage the transaction-messages between vehicles and the core.
2) We formulate the mining task offloading problem by
considering the transmission rate of vehicles and the
available computation resources in the mining cluster.
Due to the limited local view of the offloading vehicles,
the formulated problem ensures the feasible execution
of mining tasks.
3) We propose a game-theoretic solution to balance the
computation load at the mining cluster. The solution
also ensures that all the offloading vehicles offload
their task fairly. The simulation results show perfor-
mance improvements over the conventional nearest clus-
ter selection approach.

In this section, we present the details of the system model
along with a discussion on the problem formulation.

can switch between normal and mining modes depending
on their computation resources. Once in the mining mode,
the vehicle does not change mode until the completion of
the mining task. The impact of switching between mining
and normal modes and their relevant processes is beyond the
scope of this study. To perform the recording of transactions
in the network, all the vehicles are assumed to run blockchain

applications. Accordingly, M vehicles with lower computation
resources may offload the computationally difficult tasks to
one of the mining clusters.
When a vehicle i ∈ G uploads a task to the mining cluster
j ∈ F a task X , the head of the mining cluster receives the
task and distributes it among cluster members. Due to the
delay-sensitive nature of vehicular communications, it is not
feasible to allocate different timeslots. Thus, we assume that
all vehicles communicate at the same time T over orthogonal
frequency bands. The total frequency band is divided into
B0 bandwidth units, such that the bandwidth allocated to an
offloading vehicle communicating to the mining cluster is
expressed as Bi, j = ni, j B0. Here, ni, j denotes the number
of bandwidth units allocated to the i -th vehicle for commu-
nicating to the j -th mining cluster. We also assume that the
coherence bandwidth Wc = nmax B0 is divisible by B0 and
that the total bandwidth allocated to the vehicles is not higher
than Wc. Thus, we have:
M�
i=1
N�
j=1
ni, j ≤ nmax (1)
In general, most theoretical results reported in the litera-
ture are asymptotic in the number of channel uses (block-
length), i.e., they are valid when the number of channel
used approaches infinity [36]. However, when the blocklength
is very large, the decoding error rate becomes very small
[37]. Such an opportunity may not be available in practical
vehicular communication conditions due to requirement of
low latency and short blocklength. Due to this finite short
blocklength, the probability of non-zero decoding error sig-
nificantly increases which is often neglected in the analysis of
blockchain-based vehicular networks. Assuming the channel
between the offloading vehicle and the head of mining cluster
follows Rayleigh fading, the maximum upload transmission
rate for a given channel blocklength Li, j = Bi, j T can be
expressed as:

B. Problem Formulation
In this work, our objective is to match the offloading
vehicle with the appropriate mining cluster based on the
price and computation resources. This is intuitive because
different mining clusters may have different resources and,
thus, different costs to provide task execution services. In this
context, two key factors must be considered to efficiently
perform the computation of the offloading task. First, there
is the transmission rate for a specific task offloading vehicle.
As shown in (2), the transmission rate mainly depends on
the received signal of the vehicle for decoding the message.
Second, task execution also depends on the number of avail-
able computation resources in the mining cluster. We denote
the portion of computation resources of the j -th cluster that
is assigned for performing the task of the i -th vehicle as Ri, j .
Furthermore, since multiple vehicles can offload a task to the
mining cluster, it is important to define an offloading indicator
as ρi, j . The offloading indicator identifies whether a particular
vehicle is offloading a task to the j -th mining cluster such that:
ρi, j =
�
1 i -th vehicle offloading to j -th mining cluster
0 otherwise
(5)
Thus, the offloading problem can now be written as:

C2:

ρi, j ≤ 1,
C3: ρi, j ∈ {0, 1},
C4: Ri, j ≥ 0, (6)
where the logarithmic function has been used as a common
choice of the utility function for maintaining fairness. It is
worth noting that the linear utility functions result in a
trivial solution for the case of objective maximization, where
providing more resources to vehicles with low transmission
rates is desirable. Hence, following the approach of [39],
we use a logarithmic utility function in the remainder of this
paper which is closer to the resource allocation philosophy of
practical wireless networks. Moreover, in (6), the expression�N
j=1 Ri, j �i, j ρi, j shows the task offloading gain that the i -th
vehicle can get by offloading the task to the j -th mining
cluster. Here, the constraint C1 indicates that the j -the mining
cluster does not over-utilize its computational resources while
serving different vehicles. The constraint C2 ensures that a
particular vehicle can only offload the task to a single mining
cluster. The constraints C3 and C4 highlights the bounds of
computation resources and the binary nature of the offloading
indicator.
It is can be noted from (6) that the objective is to maximize
the global offloading utility. In this way, the offloading among

the overcrowded mining clusters can be balanced by matching
the offloading vehicle with an appropriate mining cluster.
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the problem in (6) is a
mixed integer programming problem and it is difficult to solve
in polynomial time. Though relaxations can be performed on
the offloading indicator and fixing the number of offloading
vehicles, the results obtained may not have much practical
significance. On the other hand, the solution can be found
via exhaustive search but it may not be scalable for a large
vehicular network due to the complexity of the problem.
III. PROPOSED SOLUTION FOR MINING
CLUSTER SELECTION
In this section, we make use of game-theoretic strategies and
bipartite graphs to model the interplay of offloading vehicle
and mining cluster and finding the efficient offloading solution.
We first use the graph theory approach to model different
dynamics between offloading vehicles and mining cluster
Fig. 2 shows. Specifically, to account for different execution
tasks of offloading vehicles, the vehicles within a mining
cluster must be connected to the offloading vehicles with
different weights. Assuming the computation resources within
a mining cluster are divided equally among the number of
vehicles in a mining cluster,1 we have:
Ri, j = 1
Sj
, (7)
where Sj denotes the number of offloading vehicles connected
to the j -th mining cluster. The maximum utility sum of the
mining cluster can be given as:
S j�
s=1
log
	
�i, j
S j

	�S j
s=1 �i, j

(8)
1Note that we have considered commonly used uniform distribution of
computation resources for the proposed solution. However, in practical condi-
tions, it is possible that computation resources are distributed non-uniformly
depending on the different types of vehicles. This case will be addressed in
future studies.

Using the maximal weighted approach, it can be shown
that the sum of weights for the edges of the graph are lower

(9)
Thus, for a given offloading vehicle set G and mining cluster
F , a bipartite graph can be constructed. We first introduce the
vehicles of a mining cluster as v1
j , v
2
j , . . . , v
V
j , where j ∈ F .
When an i -th offloading vehicle is in range of the j -th mining
cluster, we add an edge between (ui , v

where s = 1, 2, . . . , V with the weight given as:
ws
i, j = log
�
�i, j �
ss
�
. (10)
where � = (s − 1)s−1. When a vehicle offloads a task
to the mining cluster, the corresponding mining vehicle v1
1
would be matched with the weight log �11. When another
offloading vehicle offloads a task to the same mining cluster,
the cluster head divides the computation resources equally.
Due to this reason, the net utility of both offloading vehicles
become log
�

and log

.
Note that this gain would be equal to the weight between
u2 and v2
1 . Thus, by offloading the s-th vehicle to the mining
cluster, we can keep track of the marginal utility gains for
a particular mining cluster. It is worth mentioning that there
are two parts of the edge weights ws
i, j . The first part log �i, j
deals with the offloading rate of the vehicle, while the other
part represents the computation burden on the mining cluster.
The two parts can be dealt with separately at the mining cluster
using an auction-based game theory approach.

TABLE II
SIMULATION PARAMETERS AND THEIR VALUES
Fig. 3. Transmission rate against number of mining clusters.
The utility of the offloading vehicle is based on the price
of each mining cluster. Specifically, every offloading vehicle
compares the price of mining clusters and sets its utility as:
Ui, j = c + log �i, j , (12)
where c is a pre-defined constant with a value greater than the
initial prices by mining clusters. The auction process takes
place in multiple rounds. A mining cluster announces the
price ps
j to the other vehicles in the network. Based on the
broadcasted price, the offloading vehicle calculates the gain
as:
mi, j = Ui, j − ps
j (13)
The offloading vehicle calculates two margins, i.e., m∗
i and
m̃i called the highest and second-highest margin respectively.
The difference between the two values is submitted as a
bid to the mining cluster that provides the largest margin.
If there is a tie among two mining clusters, the offloading
vehicle submits a bid of δ. To maximize its utility, each
mining cluster selects a vehicle with the highest bid and
temporarily assigns it to the cluster. In the new round of
auction, the mining cluster increases the price by the amount
of the highest bid. If a new offloading vehicle provides a
higher bid, the temporarily assigned vehicle is removed and a
new assignment is performed. The new temporarily assigned
vehicle along with the latest price is announced in the network
via a broadcast message from the mining cluster.
The process of auction continues until all the mining clusters
stop changing the temporary assignment of the offloading
vehicles. In our version of the auction, all the unassigned

It is also straightforward to extend the approach where vehicles
are allowed to submit their bids asynchronously. It may also
be noted that the price of the mining clusters increases at

vehicles that a mining cluster can have, the maximum number

From (14), we note that the number of rounds depends
on the computation capabilities of the mining cluster and its
overall utility.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section presents the simulation results and relevant
discussions. As indicated in Section II, we consider the
wireless channel between the offloading vehicle and mining
clusters to be Rayleigh faded. Rayleigh fading is an important
ionospheric and tropospheric radio channel model when there
are different signal reflection points in the environment. This
type of propagation channel adequately suits the cellular V2X
network considered in this work. We have compared the result
of our proposed technique with the baseline nearest cluster
selection approach. In this approach, each vehicle selects
the cluster based on the smallest Euclidean distance. Nearest
cluster selection is a commonly used technique for offloading
tasks [40]. Unless stated otherwise, Table II presents the values
of different simulation parameters. These values are selected
for illustrating the performance of the proposed offloading
framework and can change depending on the communication
conditions.
Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the baseline and the
proposed technique. Here, ‘finite’ refers to the case for short
blocklength transmission with � = 0.3 while ‘infinite’ refers
to the � = 0.5. We observe that the proposed approach
performs better in terms of the achievable transmission rate.
Specifically, we note that an increase in the number of mining
clusters generally increases the transmission rate. In this
context, the proposed mining task offloading technique suffers
at the start, but when the number of mining clusters increases,
the proposed approach significantly outperforms the conven-
tional nearest mining cluster selection technique.
To further demonstrate the impact of using a short packet
on the transmission rate, Fig. 4 shows the results for different
values of � . We note that, for an improvement in transmit
power, the overall transmission rate improves as compared to
the results shown in Fig. 3. Additionally, an increase in the
number of mining clusters also improves the transmission rate.
However, at smaller values of � , the value of the transmission
rate decreases significantly. When � = 0.5, we can observe
that the overall transmission rate becomes lower than 1 bit/s.
This also decreases the number of mining clusters because
there is a negligible change in the transmission rate when the
number of mining clusters increases from 10 to 50.
To illustrate the benefit of the proposed technique, Fig. 5
shows the results for Jain’s fairness index of offloading
vehicles. We observe that the proposed technique has a
higher fairness index as compared to the conventional baseline
approach. Specifically, for infinite blocklength, the fairness
index is higher compared with the shorter blocklength. How-
ever, both alternatives to the proposed technique achieve better
fairness index than the nearest cluster selection approach. The
major reason for the poor performance of the nearest mining
cluster approach is because the offloading vehicles closer to
the mining cluster can offload more data which quickly results
in saturation in the cluster. As a result, there is an imbalance
in the use of network resources due to the selection of the
nearest mining cluster. In contrast, the proposed approach does
not rely on the proximity and creates a balance in the use of
network resources to achieve better fairness and maintain a
reasonable tradeoff.
Fig. 6 shows the average number of available mining
clusters per vehicle for different values of δ. We observe
that increasing the value of δ has a direct impact on the
cost of the mining cluster. Specifically, during each round,
the price increases by δ. The value of δ changes from 10−5
to 10−3 in Fig. 6 (a) to (c). Due to this reason, the number of
available offloading clusters per vehicle gradually decreases
as δ approaches 10−3. On the other hand, an increase in
each round helps the mining clusters to improve their gains.
Besides, we again note that the overall transmission rate
decreases for the short blocklength transmission as compared
with the infinite blocklength transmission.
Fig. 7 shows the mismanagement ratio, i.e., the ratio of a
vehicle unable to offload to the total number of offloading
vehicles in the network. From the figure, we can observe
that the mismanagement ratio decreases with an increase in
the number of mining clusters. This is intuitive because a
larger number of mining clusters allow a better opportunity
for offloading vehicles to offload their data. Again, it can

be seen that the proposed technique outperforms the baseline
method by reducing the number of vehicles that cannot be
offloaded. The difference between the performances of the
two techniques becomes clearer when the number of mining
clusters increases in the network.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The wide range of applications of blockchain will con-
tinue to improve the performance of cellular V2X networks.
However, to reap the full benefits of this integration, it is
important to address some challenges and identify potential
solutions. In this work, we propose an efficient solution for
offloading mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. To satisfy
the low-latency requirements of safety applications, we have
considered a short blocklength transmission architecture. The
finite blocklength architecture is a more practical approach to
model such blockchain networks. Subsequently, we adopted
a game-theoretic approach to efficiently offload the mining
tasks to the mining clusters. Our proposed solution not only
ensures good transmission rates but also maintains fairness
among offloading vehicles. When compared with the conven-
tional baseline nearest cluster selection approach, the results
obtained reveal that the performance of the proposed technique
improves when the number of mining clusters increases in the
network.
Although the proposed solution provides considerable per-
formance gains, it can be improved in several ways. For
instance, the scalability of the blockchain network is still
a challenging problem. We anticipate that the cooperation
among different mining clusters can be helpful to address
the issue of scalability in such networks. Additionally, future
studies can jointly consider the mining task offloading and
security in blockchain-based cellular V2X networks. Since
security is one of the critical issues in conventional blockchain
networks, it would be more useful to explore its impact
on the offloading performance of vehicular networks. These
challenging yet interesting extensions will be part of our future
work.
