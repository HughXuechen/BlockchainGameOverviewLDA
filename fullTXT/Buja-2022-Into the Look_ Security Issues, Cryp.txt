Abstract—This paper presents a brief overview of 
blockchain and cryptocurrency for beginners in Malaysia. 
Cryptocurrency is an innovation for financial technology (also 
called FinTech) which has been innovated based on the 
blockchain technology.  The presence of several properties 
provided by blockchain allows cryptocurrency to be traded 
and exchanged in a virtual environment; just like the common 
currencies used today.  However, as the processes for 
exchanging and managing blockchain and cryptocurrency are 
carried out over the Internet, users are vulnerable to several 
cyber-attacks.  Besides, the existence of cryptocurrency may 
lead to other crimes such as money-laundering and online 
gambling.  Therefore, this paper discusses security issues and 
crimes related to cryptocurrency.  Furthermore, this paper 
proposes an improved crypto-hygiene as the guideline to 
mitigate and minimize the risk of cyber-attack which may also 
assist beginners who wish to involve with cryptocurrency or 
any blockchain applications in gaining some insights and 
opinions regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency.   
Keywords—blockchain, cryptocurrency, fraud, money-
laundering, sharia- 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The evolution of digital technology has led to the 
innovation of financial technology. Blockchain technology 
has introduced cryptocurrency, a medium of exchange like 
the common currency system. Cryptocurrencies are a subset 
of alternative currencies and virtual currencies [1]. In 
Malaysia, an order which recommends the traits of digital 
currency aiming to enforce security laws in the country has 
been issued by the Securities Commission Malaysia 
(henceforth, SC). This order was later amended to fulfil 
market procedures that encompass a framework which 
managers of digital asset platforms ought to accomplish in 
order to be acknowledged by the SC. In the framework, the 
organization and administration of the entity, the procedures 
in risk management, coverage of customer assets, 
transparency, and market integrity are emphasized [2]. 
A document on the proposed approach to organize the 
Initial Coin Offerings (henceforth, ICO) was issued by the 
SC in March 2019. This document expresses that the ICO's 
assent by the SC is dependent on different measures and the 
enlistment of disclosure reports that fulfil specific 
requirements [3]. Besides, cryptocurrency has also become a 
stage for money-laundering, betting, and financing of 
terrorism which the central bank is unable to track [1]. Due 
to the anonymous nature of blockchain technology, a number 
of cryptocurrency-related scams have been reported [4]. The 
presence of a gap between consumers and technology has 
lead towards other security issues such as identity and wallet 
thefts [5]. 
Moreover, the advantages and importance of the 
technology offered by cryptocurrency and blockchain have 
attracted the attention of researchers from various fields, 
especially in the fields of information technology, finance, 
and economics [6]. Several studies and research work have 
been done on both blockchain and cryptocurrency including 
the application of blockchain [7], [8] and cryptocurrency [9], 
[10], the acceptance of cryptocurrency [4], [11], [12], the 
challenges of cryptocurrency [13], [14] and many more [15] 
- [18]. Meanwhile, the amount of cryptocurrency studies 
Malaysia is relatively scarce and limited.   
Furthermore, cryptocurrency does not only attract the 
attention of researchers and businessmen or investors, but 
also general public regardless of their ages and backgrounds. 
Therefore, this paper provides a brief overview of blockchain 
and cryptocurrency in Malaysia. Section 2 presents the key 
concepts related to blockchain and cryptocurrency, 
respectively. Security and crime issues in blockchain and 
cryptocurrency are reviewed in Section 3; while in Section 4,  
an improved crypto-hygiene is presented. Finally, future 
directions for blockchain and cryptocurrency in Malaysia are 
discussed in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes this paper.

II. BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY 
The digital asset industry is one of the best and it is a 
business that allows industry players to work and 
communicate effectively in different time zones and enables 
remote management. Cryptocurrency is one of the highest 
financial technology innovations that is bringing change to 
our current global financial sector and economy. This digital 
currency consists of sequential hashing and digital 
signatures created through encryption techniques. This 
process is performed by thousands of computers around the 
world that has replaced the responsibilities of several 
entities (banks). The act of a digital currency transaction 
from sender to receiver and verified in a general ledger is 
known as mining process [6], [7]. 
A. Approved Digital Asset Exchanger (DAX) in Malaysia 
As a result of the Capital Markets and Services 
(Securities Prescription) (Digital Currency and Digital 
Tokens) Order 2019 which was issued on 15 January 2019, 
the SC has now enrolled three Recognized Market Operators 
(RMOs) to build up and work on the exchanges of digital 
assets in Malaysia. Moreover, the Guidelines on Recognized 
Markets which were modified on 31 January 2019 which 
present new conditions for DAX Operators were also issued. 
Besides, based on the Income Tax Act 1967, the Inland 
Revenue Board is currently drafting a rule on incomes 
acquired through cryptocurrency [19]. 
In Malaysia, the SC has exhorted the entities that have 
not been endorsed to automatically halt their operations and 
therefore return all cash and resources that have been 
gathered from investors. As indicated by the SC, prior to 
initiating businesses that involve digital asset exchange, the 
public is urged to allude to the authority's sites where the lists 
of endorsed operators of digital currency are regularly 
revised. The approach taken by all approved DAX is 
coaching and guiding.  Due to the size of community 
involved in cryptocurrency is still small and controlled; each 
of the DAX has established a closed relationship and 
engagement with their customers.  Table 1 shows the details 
of approved DAX in Malaysia [20]. 
TABLE I.  APPROVED DAX IN MALAYSIA 
DAX Location Digital Asset 
Luno Selangor Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple,

Tokenize Kuala Lumpur Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple 
 
B. Regulatory Bodies 
 In Malaysia, there are two main regulatory bodies 
responsible to coordinate and produce standard regulatory 
framework for this emerging financial technology 
innovation.  Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is accountable 
for ensuring the adherence to laws and guidelines under the 
domain of the two regulators. The subsequent organization is 
the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) which controls the 
production of digital assets including digital currencies and 
tokens via the ICO. Additionally, the exchanges of digital 
assets at digital assets exchanges in Malaysia are also 
monitored by the SC [21], [22]. 
     With an end goal to advance precise and safe trading to 
investors, these digital asset-related guidelines are 
established for consideration and acknowledgment in the 
domain of securities law. Furthermore, in battling money 
laundering, online gambling and terrorist financing, BNM 
has to guarantee that ICO issuers and exchanges of digital 
assets associated with the issuance or exchange of digital 
assets with payment capacities should consent to the laws 
and guidelines that have been set as in the rules given by the 
SC [21], [22]. 
C. Blockchain 
TABLE II.  TYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN[7] 
Type Description 
Permission-less User participation does not need the consent of 
any entity because this blockchain has no owner. 
Therefore, a copy of the same ledger is 
distributed to all nodes in the network. 
Permissioned In order to identify trustworthy network nodes, 
user participation requires the consent of any 
entity as this blockchain ought to establish trust 
in a central coordinating entity. While, for open 
block type chains it can be accessed by anyone. 
However, only authorized network participants 
can perform transactions and / or update ledger 
status. 
Closed or 
“enterprise” 
permissioned 
Any transactions and ledger updates can only be 
performed by the network administrator. Like 
other blockchains, this blockchain also does not 
require a trusted third -party intermediary to 
perform authentication. 
 
Blockchain is part of Distributed Ledger Technology 
(DLT) which functions by recording and sharing data via 
multifold data warehouses; known as ledgers. Within this 
data warehouse, a network of distributed computer servers, 
called nodes will handle the same data records and maintain 
them collectively [4], [7]. Inside the blockchain (a set) 
specialized mathematical algorithms will be used to create 
and validate ever -evolving data structures.  This algorithm is 
known as cryptography whereby data can only be inserted 
while any existing data cannot be diminished.  The blockhain 
has advanced properties compared to the tradition ledger 
system.  Table 2 and Table 3 describe the types and 
properties of blockchain respectively. 
TABLE III.  PROPERTIES OF BLOCKCHAIN[7] 
Property Description 
Peer-To-Peer No central node required. Data can be 
exchanged between the participants 
directly. 
Distributed The ledger is advertised to the entire 
network. 
Cryptographically 
Secured 
Cryptography provides extra safety to the 
ledger from being compromised. 
Add-Only To maintain the integrity of the 
information, data must be included in the 
blockchain with consecutive requests. 
Consensus Decentralization requires the blockchain 
the ability to update the ledger through 
consensus. 
 
Generally, the blockchain technology is closely known as 
the backbone of digital or virtual currency schemes, 
payments, and financial services. However, from a more 
detailed perspective, the scope of blockchain use is very 
broad and can be applied in various sectors including 
collateral pledges, registration of shares, bonds and other 
assets, on the transfer of real estate tiles, and on land register

operations.  However, this study only focuses on the 
blockchain technology in cryptocurrency.  Fig. 1 depicts the 
application of blockchain in cryptocurrency.  Firstly, users 
will set up a wallet within the mobile application which 
stores the cryptocurrency in an address for payment 
purposes. When cryptocurrency is transferred from user A to 
user B, the blockchain technology will handle this process 
replacing the bank’s tasks. Next, each user's account and 
transaction will be managed in the Distributed Ledger 
Technology (DLT) which will be advertised in the network 
[4], [7]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. The application of blockchain in cryptocurrency. 
The main principles of the blockchain technologies are 
digital signatures and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  
Public Key Cryptography is a cryptographic system that 
utilizes a couple of keys; the private key which will not be 
disclosed while the public key which will be broadcast to the 
network. The genuineness and integrity of the message 
delivered via this system is guaranteed [23], [24].   
Bitcoin uses Public Key Cryptography to ensure the 
integrity of messages created in protocols involving the 
creation and signing of wallet transactions. To enable the 
public address used by Bitcoin users to send and receive 
funds, Bitcoin uses a public key with a hash function. In 
order to sign a digital transaction in guaranteeing the validity 
of the transaction, the private key is utilized. Since Bitcoin is 
decentralized, Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure 
(DPKI) is utilized whereby there are concerns related to 
building up trust relations between all parties. Be that as it 
may, today, there is no requirement for the third-parties 
whereby blockchain acts as a novel way to deal with 
assembling a more capable and secure PKI framework. In the 
DPKI, blockchain goes about as the decentralized key-value 
storage that is equipped for getting the information perused 
to forestall MITM attacks as well as to limit third-parties' 
control [25].  
In addition, with the presence of the blockchain 
technology in the system, DPKI settles the issues related to 
the traditional PKI system by guaranteeing that no single 
third-party can think twice about integrity and security of the 
framework. In blockchain-controlled DPKI, the new third 
parties are recognized as miners or validators where they 
should observe the standards of the convention that would 
financially compensate or punish these third parties to 
successfully overcome negative conducts in the blockchain 
as well as restricting their roles [25]. 
III. SECURITY ISSUES AND CRIMES 
Blockchain and cryptocurrency are still developing 
worldwide.  Therefore, security issues and crimes related to 
blockchain and cryptocurrency are expected to rise.  Since 
the introduction of Bitcoin, consequently, blockchain has 
been applied in large-scale today due to its robustness and 
integrity-support.  However, there is still lack testing on the 
blockchain infrastructure especially on the endpoints of the 
cryptocurrency network for instance, the “wallet”.  As the 
ecosystem of blockhain grows, more vulnerability could be 
discovered and exploited by hackers.  Furthermore, because 
of the regulation standardized for the cryptocurrency is still 
insufficient and there are only few countries that own it, 
there are groups of people who gain benefits from the 
anonymity of the blockchain itself (such as money-
laundering and gambling activities) or from the mistakes of 
others (for instance, victims of scams and frauds). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Relationship between age of user – technology and the 
vulnerability - attack. 
Fig. 2 shows that the technology is growing together with 
risk such as cyber-attacks that can be harmful towards end 
users of the technology.  Users that use the technology vary 
in terms of age.  For the elderly, the gap of the technologies 
during their time and todays’ technologies is the main 
concern because it requires users to have knowledge on how 
to use the technology wisely.  The elderly is an age group 
that is more vulnerable to be compromised by the 
irresponsible persons [5]. 
In addition, users of cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to 
cyber-attacks regardless the types of cryptocurrency [26].  
Due to the advancement in information technology and the 
acceptance of using social media, the chances for cyber-
attack such as fraud or scam also increase.  Fraud can be 
described as a fraudulent activity by using the advantages of 
the Internet, either through emails, websites, or social media.  
Often, these fraudulent activities will offer goods or services 
that do not actually exist or in other words, are counterfeit to 
consumers [4]. Other than that, another technique of 
scamming is by social engineering that is done by obtaining 
confidential information by taking advantage of an 
individual’s weaknesses through persuasion or temptation 
techniques [26].   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3. A Scenario of cryptocurrency scam. 
Commonly, crypto-scammers develop a website that can 
convince users to buy and invest in cryptocurrency, for

instance, purchasing Bitcoin.  In addition, they will invite the 
users to a trusted group in various social media platforms 
[27].  Because of the state of cryptocurrency in Malaysia is 
still new and growing, users or Malaysian citizens are 
generally more eager to get involved in cryptocurrency as it 
promises a simpler way to become rich.  In information 
security, this situation is called “user confuse” where the user 
is unable to think wisely for his involvement in 
cryptocurrency investment [27].  Fig. 3 illustrates the 
scenario on how a user, also called a victim, is scammed by 
investing in Bitcoin.   
A. Vulnerability and Risk of Mobile Device 
Cryptocurrency requires user to install the application on 
their mobile devices.  The application, which is provided by 
the DAX, will give access for the user to the cryptocurrency 
network. Crypto-wallet is one of the features in the 
application.  Therefore, the security risks of the mobile 
device itself can cause the vulnerabilities to the user’s 
crypto-wallet and identity.  The security risks of a mobile 
device include the mobile device being misplaced, shoulder 
surfing and unattended, the connection vulnerabilities, 
accessing untrusted content, and deployment model.   
The example of connection vulnerabilities is when the 
user is connecting to the insecure public network whereas the 
user might be vulnerable to eavesdroppers who can steal data 
in the transmissions and view sensitive information.  With 
their mobile device, the user tends to access content 
immediately.  For instance, the user might access the content 
through quick response code (QR-code) which may 
indirectly install the malware to their mobile device.  Finally, 
following the advancement of technology, the nature of 
doing the routines is also changed.  Companies can deploy 
the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model which allows 
their employers to use their own personal mobile devices for 
business purposes.  When the user connects to the corporate 
network, their personal information in their mobile device 
might be discoverable by others [24]. 
B. Crypto-laundering and Gambling 
Cryptocurrency can be misused such as in money 
laundering activities and online gambling. This is because 
the handling of cryptocurrency is made hidden, decentralized 
and it is new in the market, so it has many systemic gaps.   
There are difficulties that may lead to no detection that can 
be made by the authorities. Moreover, the acceptance of 
cryptocurrency by the world has also made cryptocurrency as 
a platform for these criminal activities. The existence of 
online gambling sites using cryptocurrency payment methods 
is also rapidly developing [27].  
IV. AN IMPROVED CRYPTO-HYGIENE 
Hygiene for cryptocurrency is important for any 
beginners. Much like computer-hygiene [29], cyber-hygiene 
or network-hygiene [30], crypto-hygiene is a set of 
guidelines and precautions for users involved in 
cryptocurrency. Crypto-hygiene includes self- hygiene + 
computer-hygiene + network-hygiene; which can be defined 
as self-protection that starts from the self then to the devices 
used by the user and the network. This paper proposes an 
improved crypto-hygiene to include several types of hygiene 
in order to mitigate the vulnerabilities at the endpoints of 
cryptocurrency network as illustrated in Fig. 4.

V. FUTURE DIRECTION OF BLOCKCHAIN AND 
CRYPTOCURRENCY IN MALAYSIA 
Blockchain and cryptocurrency both have potential in 
Malaysia. Table 4 summarizes the future direction and 
movement on blockchain and cryptocurrency. The 
robustness of distributed ledgers developed based on the 
blockchain technology can be used for insurance and land 
ownership management. Despites, blockchain can be used 
for online voting systems. With the help of the blockchain 
technology, it can help companies to save time, increase 
costs in transparency, comply with regulations, and build 
better products and markets [14], [32]. 
TABLE IV.  FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN AND 
CRYPTOCURRENCY IN MALAYSIA 
Direction Explanation 
Insurance and land grant title The blockchain technology can be 
used to create insurance policy and 
land grant title because the data or 
information can be secured from 
modification or alteration.  
Payment and investment Citizens will use cryptocurrency as 
the medium of payment and 
investment instead of the existing 
digital assets. 
Securities Commission Approval More Digital Asset Exchanger 
(DAX) will be approved by 
Securities Commission. 
Sharia-Compliant The authorities will work further on 
sharia-compliant so that the 
cryptocurrency can be accepted and 
adopted in Islamic community. 
Health record The blockchain technology can be 
used to create and maintain health 
record. 
 
The use of blockchain can expand the trust and use of 
cryptocurrency in Malaysia [10], [14], [15], [32]. 
Cryptocurrency can be used in business for payments and 
investments. Therefore, more DAX will be approved by the 
SC as long as it complies with the terms and conditions. The 
acceptance of cryptocurrency by the Muslim community in 
Malaysia is still in its infancy [31], [32]. Cryptocurrency is 
now a hot topic among researchers, scholars, and academics. 
The results of a recent study indicate that compatibility, 
awareness and facilitation conditions have a significant 
impact on the investment of the Malaysian Muslim 
community in the Bitcoin market [31], [32]. Cryptocurrency

can be accepted by the Muslim community if and only if it is 
sharia compliant and consumers know where the money is 
coming from and where it will go through the cryptocurrency 
network. This is because, in crypto exchanges, the source of 
cryptocurrency funds may be related to illegal activities [31] 
- [34]. 
 
Fig. 5. Blockchain and cryptocurrency research areas. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Blockchain and cryptocurrency itself can bring more 
benefits to end users.  This innovation can lead to a broad 
opportunity in expanding the existing business processes.  If 
evaluated based on the advantages of the blockchain 
technology adopted in cryptocurrency, there are many 
advantages. However, since this cryptocurrency is still new, 
it also has its drawbacks. There are not many sources that 
can be referred to. Therefore, the results of the study are 
much needed to enable more people to understand 
blockchain and cryptocurrency.  Further studies on the 
effectiveness of the proposed an improved crypto-hygiene, 
blockchain and cryptocurrency from the context of Malaysia 
are strongly recommended for future works as presented in 
Fig. 5.
