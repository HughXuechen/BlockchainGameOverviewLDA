Abstract. Over the course of time, electronic voting has evolved as a substitute for paper ballot voting to 
decrease redundancies and inconsistencies. Due to the many security and privacy vulnerabilities experienced 
over time, the past results of e-voting in the last three decades indicate that it has not been very successful. 
All cryptocurrencies are actually based on block chain. Block chain is based on the principle of distribution 
and decentralization. It is a continuous and continuously growing ledger that holds, in a secure, 
chronological and immutable way, a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place. Value in 
a block chain can be anything. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it takes the meaning of money or currency. 
While in a game it takes the form of points or score.  The value can take the form of a vote or a ballot while e-
voting. The blockchain can be used in this article to pass votes between two parties. In our case, the 
electorate is one party and the candidate who earns the vote is the other. Without having a controlling 
central authority body, the block chain can be implemented in a more stable manner in mass electoral voting 
practise. A voting system that uses a more stable, tamper-proof block chain (immutable to voting 
modifications either by other voters or by any third party) and is cost-effective. 
Keywords- Block chain, Electronic Voting, Cryptocurrency, Decentralization, Distributed ledger 
 
Introduction: 
E-VOTING is amidst the popular public segments that have the scope to be improved by 
Blockchain technology. The idea here is simple. Blockchains can address two of the most 
prevailing problems common in voting today which are the voter’s access and voter’s fraud. 
Blockchain enabled e-voting will deploy an encrypted key (such as an RSA private key) and 
tamper-proof personal IDs (Fingerprint biometric verification). Blockchain will tie each 
cast/vote of the ballot to an individual voter to establish a permanent, immutable record so that 
no hacker will be able to engage in reprehensible pursuits because such no operation can be 
performed on all of the public ledgers such as blockchain that are a part of a peer-to-peer 
consensus network and also to do that one would need to recalculate all the hashes of every 
block from the infected block which will be very time consuming and too complex to perform. To 
exploit the used network or any blockchain network, the hackers would have to hack all of the 
blocks (blocks containing even one transaction record) even before the new ones got introduced. 
The hashes of hashes will be there to ensure that no vote has been altered or removed and also 
that there are no illegitimate votes casted or the original vote changed. In simple words, 
blockchains enables the formation of tamper-proof audit trails or traces of voting. In the 
presented report, we would try to highlight some blockchain-enabled e-voting methodology and

its results and conclusion. The e-voting is foreseen to have an incredible future yet the past isn't 
excessively sublime. There are some countries that are trying to bring up e-voting but the 
problem of reliability and proof which are among the other stuff that need immensely deep 
consideration by the governments and technological people and basically the people. This 
research suggested a system based on the adaptable block chain that could capture the issues 
that prevail in the polling process, and would help in the selection of a suitable hashing 
algorithm, is helpful even in the selection of changes in the blockchain, it will help in securing 
the content of block data. Block-chain has been of great use in order to fit into the available 
needs and process of electronic voting.

Nir Kshetri [3] each voter is considered as a wallet, and the transactions between wallet 
is limited to one. As the candidates are considered as the receiver wallet. The vote is actually the 
transaction between all the candidates or receiver wallets. The methodology used in this paper is 
Blockchain enabled e-voting which is using an encrypted key along with the alteration-proof 
user IDs. The advantage is Blockchain enabled e-voting will help us to ensure the aspect of 
security as well as transparency which would help to reduce electoral violence and produce more 
mathematically precise voting results. The Disadvantage is They did not use a decentralized 
voting system (only meant for one single place). No consensus. The wallet-coin model can be 
amended to single wallet. 
Fridrik [2] Attempt to use a case study to determine the potential of distributed ledger 
technologies; such as the election process and its implementation via a block-chain-based 
framework, which will boost security and reduce the cost of conducting national elections. The 
technique is to achieve these objectives by using a Go-Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (POA) 
blockchain authorization setup. They have used the algorithm through a process based on 
identity as a stake, which delivers faster transactions. They use district and boot. The voting data 
is checked by the majority of the district nodes when any individual elector casts a vote from 
their compliant smart contract, and any vote they agree on is appended to the blockchain. The 
advantage is Elections can be used as a Blockchain part of Smart Contract, using developer 
friendly Framework (Go-Ethereum), Centralized consensus. The disadvantage is limited up to 
5000 votes/second. Can use some better blockchain frameworks for increasing transactions per 
second. 
Zhang [4] proposes a local voting mechanism conceptualized on block-chain to help 
decision making for its peers’ networks. It protects the privacy and enables detection as well as 
correction against cheating. The methodology used are Distributed consensus based blockchain 
algorithm. The advantage is Elections can be used as a Blockchain part of Smart Contract, Peer 
to peer network, consensus, Two phase validation (decryption pvt key, smart contract 
verification). The disadvantage is No proof if the model will work or not. Untested with many 
blockchain frameworks. Can use a better blockchain framework for increasing transactions per 
second. If tested with faster and premised blockchain frameworks it can set the standards.

Crowcroft[1], to ensure data protection, such as block formation and sealing, it proposes 
useful hashing techniques. The methodology used are consensus based blockchain algorithm. 
The advantages are Used their own framework, Better hashing algorithm. The disadvantage is 
No proof if the model will work or not, Untested with many blockchain frameworks. 
Proposed Architecture: 
E-voting has developed over time to be an auxiliary to the paper-based voting to reduce 
mistakes as well as complete vote counting process faster. But flaws of safety, secrecy have been 
there, as it comes it every electronic technology. This is a grave liability, as electronic voting is 
used in election of governments of countries. Block is the primary component of any block-chain 
which contains of a body and a header, In which the body of the block comprises the 
transactions that are to be written to system and header of block encompasses data about block 
such as nonce value, time stamp of block and transactions and previous hash. In the block part, 
the voter casts the vote/ballot after validation that he/she is a valid user. Then ballot signed by 
using a RSA private key. If the submitted ballot is proven to be valid, it will be sealed. In this 
chain section, transactions (ballots) with valid data will be generated. They are then sealed into 
blocks.  
 
Challenges in the Existing Systems are: 
 Privacy:  Only the elector is permitted to see his or her data and who they voted for 
as well. The revealed details in election is nothing but the cumulative votes to candidates as well 
as in entire election 
 Absence of Evidence:  While privacy with the concealment component will protect 
against electoral fraud, there is no way to guarantee that votes are cast under any form of 
electoral fraud.  
 Fraud-Resistance:  The system should check the uniqueness and status of each 
probable voter, but should not allow this information to be related to their voting status. 
 
 Ease-of-Use:  Elections are open to the public, and must therefore be organised in 
such a way that fewer preparation and technological knowledge can be required. 
 
The project is based on Blockchain which is still a research area, hence a detailed study was 
required to understand the requirements. Since most of these are only theoretically available in 
form of research papers, we intend to generate data and then segregate it for detailed study. We 
have used three methods for requirements gathering analysis are brainstorming, observation 
and Document Analysis 
 The main objective of the project is to form a framework for a voting model to ensure the 
security of the data. Blockchain is secure and can be used for effective casting of votes and 
ensuring that the voting system is not tampered or manipulated to change the votes. In simple 
terms the objective of our project is: To verify voters’ identity using biometric authentication, 
face or fingerprint, Make the election process as transparent as possible (independently verify 
that the process is conducted according to procedures and no irregularities), Tracking of votes 
for voters (even after the election is over users can check who they voted for), Ability to change 
their votes any time before the deadline.

In Figure1: System Architecture of Electronic Based Voting System consists of four modules are 
Voter Registration, Voter Authentication, Vote Process and Blockchain module. In Voter 
Registration we will ask the volunteering voters to register their fingerprint for biometric 
authentication. Happens before the actual voting takes place.

In Voter Authentication the voter will be verified by his unique finger impression and the 
framework will produce a pk for the voter with the goal that vote can be encrypted and 
decrypted by the blockchain server. In Vote process the candidate list will be generated after 
successful authentication. The voter will then select a candidate and after selecting vote is 
encrypted by RSA algorithm and sent to server to add to the blockchain. In Blockchain module 
the candidate list will be generated after successful authentication. The voter will then select a 
candidate and after selecting vote is encrypted by RSA algorithm and sent to server to add to the 
blockchain.  
Four Algorithms are used for Securing the database are SHA3, RSA, Blockchain Voting and 
Merkle root algorithm. In SHA3 Algorithm is used for hashing. A unidirectional feature for 
producing digital prints of the chosen length (the standard accepts 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits) 
from input data of any size is also called Keecak. It can directly be implemented by the developer 
by importing the python module keccak or pysha3[5][8].  
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) It is one of the most well-known cryptosystems for key transfer 
and block encryption. In R.S.A we use a block with variable size and a key with variable size. It 
follows an asymmetric way of encryption. R.S.A has three steps; key generation, encryption and 
decryption. The voter will then select a candidate to caste vote and after selecting the vote will

then be encrypted by RSA algorithm and sent to server to append in the blockchain. The 
constituent and vote data that will be passed to the RSA input and the data will be used as type 
string, then it will be encrypted using RSA private key by using RSA algorithm.

 In Blockchain[7] voting Algorithm every vote we will be asked to seal the ballot which 
will generate a ballot id and a generated signature. After sealing the ballot, the transaction hash 
will be generated and stored then the block hash will be created with the updated hashes and a 
unique nonce will be given to each block with a time stamp. Figure 3 gives the block details of 
voting system after hashing and Figure 4 gives the verification process of a voter and generated 
the signature for every ballot.

In a Merkle root is commonly referred to as the hash of all the hashes of all the transactions 
that are part of a block in a blockchain. Here the Merkle root is the hash of all the vote 
transaction inside a block. The number of votes stored in a block depends entirely on our own 
requirements. To calculate the changing hashes with every new vote added and to create the 
final hash we will use pymerkle tools algorithm available in python library, can be installed 
through pip. The module uses SHA-3 algorithm to create the hashes which is faster and more 
efficient than SHA-1 and SHA-2. A Merkle tree is a data structure tree in which every leaf node 
i.e. (the node which has no children) stores the hash of the block, and every non-leaf node (the 
node which has one or more children) stores the hash of its child nodes. So, the root node will 
contain the hash of all hashes that we need here. In Figure 5 the root node is having the hashes 
of all the child nodes.

The e-voting is foreseen to have an incredible future yet the past isn't excessively sublime. In 
certain nations e-casting a ballot isn't a choice while few are in a procedure to take out the 
security, undeniable nature, and anonymity concerns. This examination has proposed a 
structure dependent on the movable blockchain that can catch the issues in the surveying

procedure, determination of the reasonable hash calculation, choice of modifications in the 
blockchain, procedure of casting a ballot information the executives, and the security and 
verification of the democratic procedure. The intensity of blockchain has been utilized 
customizable to fit into the elements of the electronic voting procedure. We developed an 
effective model for generating a block for every vote based on blockchain block creation and 
sealing. The sealed blocks can be used to count the votes for each candidate. For our project we 
used Python simulation-based test which is a part of Django Framework[6]. It’s a python-based 
unit testing framework based out on Python and helps us easily perform unit testing based on 
different modules present in the system, thus helping us gain insights on how the software 
works and how the different modules work independently.  We simulated the number of 
candidates to be 3 and created a simulation class with loosely coupled functions and set the 
voting time limit to one minute. 
When we started the test, we got 10000 votes in one minute (3332+3377+3291) for the three 
candidates. The votes were successfully sealed in blocks along with the voter id of the voter.

Conclusion:  
We developed an effective model for generating a block for every vote based on 
blockchain block creation and sealing. The sealed blocks can be used to count the votes for each 
candidate. Our proposed System overcome the disadvantage of votes are casted through EVM, 
There is no way to guarantee that votes are cast in some sort of electoral fraud that only a voter 
is able to access his / her data and who voted for them.Using SHA3, RSA and Merkel root 
algorithm all the information about the e-voting system is highly secured in blockchain. Despite 
the fact that blockchains are exceptionally secure with regards to securing data that is stored in 
it — the main problem occurs when the clients don't safeguard their private credentials. This 
implies there is consistently a danger of private keys being taken. As an undertaking or business, 
you have to teach clients on the best way to protect their private keys.
