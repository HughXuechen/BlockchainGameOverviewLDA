Abstract—Blockchain has been gradually applied to dif-
ferent Internet-of-Things platforms. As the efficiency of the
blockchain mainly depends on the network computing ca-
pability, how to make sure the acquisition of the compu-
tational resources and participation of the devices would
be the driving force. In this article, we focus on investigat-
ing incentive mechanism for rational miners to purchase
the computational resources. An edge-computing-based
blockchain network is considered, where the edge service
provider (ESP) can provide computational resources for
the miners. Accordingly, we formulate a two-stage Stack-
elberg game between the miners and ESP. The aim is to
investigate SE of the optimal mining strategy under the two
different mining schemes, in order to find the optimal in-
centive for the ESP and miners to choose autofit strategies.
Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we
can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
on encouraging devices to participate the blockchain.

the coming decades, smart city, smart healthcare, smart logistics,
smart grid, digital currency, e-government, intelligent logistics,
and many others will gradually emerge into our daily life [1].
However, as a decentralized system with a large number of
devices, enjoying the benefits of IoT comes with challenges,
such as the problems related to security, delay, resources, and
privacy [2]. The increase in the number of devices connected
to the IoT and the variety of devices have led to issues, such as
flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability. All
these problems are mainly caused by the inherent natures of
IoT, which has prompted researchers to explore novel network
architecture and bring the cloud computing platform into the
research of IoT [2].
However, as the increasing number of devices join the IoT
and the massive data transmission consume too much frequency
bandwidth, the cloud-centric processing operation requires a
large amount of computational and radio resources, and the
long-distance transmission has added a longer delay [3]. There-
fore, due to insufficient network capacity, radio resources, and
data security, it is not always desired to upload all the data to a
remote cloud via core networks. Consequently, stakeholder and
researchers start to investigate a novel proximal paradigm for
cloud computing, namely edge (or fog) computing. It can be seen
as a layered service structure that extends the traditional cloud
computing to provide proximal solutions at network edge for the
users. By such, the network and computational resources can be
coordinated and accessed at the network edge and the related
services can be provided with better experience and quality,
which intuitively are also able to boost the development of IoT.
Meanwhile, the blockchain has evolved from the original
digital currency to extensive IoT applications due to its dis-
tributed, tamper-resistant, retrospective, and transparent fea-
tures [4], [5]. It has a great potential to provide a secure and
efficient decentralized IoT paradigm. A block contains specific
data about cryptographic transactions. In peer-to-peer network,
blockchain technology allows us to operate applications in a
distributed manner without a trusted third party as intermediate
media [6], which can enable individual to interact with others in a
verifiable way. In general, the generation of blockchain involves
two processes: computing and reporting/releasing. Computing
refers to the process of solving the Proof of Work (PoW)
by computing to obtain a settlement or an unverified block.
Reporting means that when the nodes successfully solve the
PoW problem and, then, report the result to blockchain for
verification. When the verification is correct, the nodes in the

blockchain will reach consensus and, then, obtain rewards.
The users/nodes who participate in computing are also named
as miners while the computing for consensus is called mining.
To further realize the blockchain in the IoT, edge computing
can play a significant role [7]. The miners with insufficient hash
power can rent the computational resources from edge service
provider (ESP). As we know, the computing capability is the key
to the security and efficiency of blockchain, how to incentivize
the miners to participate the blockchain process and obtain the
computational resources is of profound significance. Therefore,
in this article, we aim at proposing a novel incentive mechanism
for an edge-computing-based blockchain, in order to find the
optimal purchase and pricing strategies for the miners and ESP
via Stackelberg game.
Recently, how to incentivize the miners to establish the
blockchain receives increasing interests. Luong et al. [8] present
an action game architecture to study the optimal profits of ESP
and miners based on deep learning. Jiao et al. [9] design a novel
approximation algorithm and study how the social welfare of
blockchain network can be maximized. Hu [10] proposes genetic
algorithm for the profit optimization of the blockchain. There
are also several works utilizing the game theory on designing
the incentive schemes [11]–[16]. Xiong et al. [11] propose to
investigate the optimal profits of ESPs and miners under different
pricing strategies via game theoretic approaches. Houy [12]
suggests a two-miner model to find the strategy of hash power
utilization and find the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the blockchain.
In [13], a game model with incomplete information is presented
to discuss whether the miner should release the solution of the
puzzle immediately after the successfully computing. In [14],
Kiayias et al. present a stochastic game with incomplete infor-
mation for efficient mining in blockchain. Feng et al. [15] also
present a game model to investigate the optimal profit among
blockchain providers, network insurers, and miners. Lewenberg
et al. [16] present a cooperative game to study the dynamic
equilibrium problem that when the miners choose to participate
in the mining pool. Wu et al. [17] propose an effective algorithm
to propose the optimal offloading solution in edge computing to
minimize the service delay. For the industrial IoT (IIoT) net-
work, Li et al. [18] propose a multiagent enhancement learning
algorithms to find the optimal offloading strategy to solve the
resource management problem. Liu et al.[19] present a wireless
blockchain offloading framework to support edge computing and
Chen et al. [20] introduce a multihop collaborative distributed
computing offloading algorithm to address the blockchain min-
ing problems in IIoT.
B. Contribution
Motivated by the aforementioned observations, we will inves-
tigate the incentive mechanism for the edge-computing-based
blockchain system by utilizing the game theory. The game-
theoretic approaches can be categorized into two groups, i.e.,
cooperative game and noncooperative game. The cooperative
game models are usually used for cluster formulation, base
station, or user cooperation scheme, where all the entities in the
network share the same goal. While the noncooperative game
has been used for resource allocation problems. In this article,
the two-stage Stackelberg game is considered, which is a suitable
model for the scenario where two selfish parties are involved.
The ESP in this article can act as the leader to set the price and the
miners are the followers to purchase the resources. Comparing
with the previous works, the main contribution of this article can
be summarized as follows.
1) A three-layer edge-computing-based blockchain system
is considered. In the proposed system, the miners can
purchase computational resources from the ESP. The
considered system can overcome some limitations of the
IoT system, such as wireless sensor network or smart city,
where the sensors with limited computing and storage
capabilities.
2) In our considered system, to encourage the nodes to
participate the mining process and the ESP to provide the
computational resources, we aim to explore the relations
and interactions between two parties. The optimal incen-
tive mechanism is presented based on the game-theoretic
approach, i.e., Stackelberg game, where ESP is the leader
and miner is the follower.
3) Two mining schemes are particularly investigated. The
first one is that after successfully computing, the miner
will report immediately, and the other one is to report
strategically after successfully computing. Then, we have
proved the existence and uniqueness of NE, and applied
backward induction to find the global optimal solution.
4) The proposed mechanisms can help both parties to obtain
the best benefits and essentially stimulate the develop-
ment of blockchain system. Numerical results demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mecha-
nism.
C. Organization
The rest of this article is organized as follows. The system
model is introduced in Section II. In Sections III and IV, we
present the game formulation and theoretical analysis, respec-
tively. Section V evaluates the performance of the proposed
scheme. Finally, Section VI concludes this article.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. System Architecture
In Fig. 1, the system model is presented. The considered
system is divided into three layers: the cloud layer, the edge layer,
and the user layer. In the user layer, the node not only can be
considered as a normal device for data acquisition and execution,
but also can take crucial computing and transmission operations.
These nodes are the potential miners in the blockchain. In the
edge layer, the ESP can provide computing and caching capacity
at the network edge. The miners at the user layer can request the
computing resources from ESP in the edge layer and offload
the computing tasks to the edge/fog node. The cloud layer
can coordinate the transmission and computing operations and
provide computing resources to the ESP if needed.

Fig. 1. System model.
The main processes considered in the system are described as
follows. First, when a transaction happens, the node/miner sends
the request to the blockchain network. Second, when the security
of transaction could be verified, the blockchain network begins
to execute the transaction. Next, the generation of block begins,
and rational miners participate in the computing of new blocks
by using hash power. The miners can purchase the computational
resources from ESP in the edge layer, the amount of which
depends on individual hash power, the cost, and the received
reward. The ESP sets the price of the computational resources.
New blocks would reach consensus after obtaining the PoW and
miners can receive the rewards. Finally, the blockchain network
transmits the data to the user layer or cloud layer for the next
actions.
In this article, we consider the miners are rational and then
formulate the game model. However, in practice, the users or
miners in the edge computing system may not be completely
rational and some external environment, such as probability of
successfully awarding, costs, profits, and historical experience,
may have significant and unpredictable impact on the choice
of the miners. In addition, in the SR scheme, the miners may
choose to obtain more profits by hiding a chain of blocks,
especially when other miners have less computational capability
that cannot timely release a new block, i.e., “withholding block
attack” could happen. The security and privacy may also be a
problem as the communications between edge computing unit
and miners could be exposed to the eavesdroppers or attackers.
B. System Assumption
We consider a scenario where there is one ESP and N miners.
The set of miners is denoted as N . We consider the miner is
the buyer and the ESP is the seller in the computing resource
market. ESP pursues optimal revenue by renting computational
resource to the miners. Practically, the ESP owns different edge
computing units, and the miners can offload the computing task
or storage requests to the edge computing unit in proximity
via the wireless connection. We assume that price of compu-
tational resource for miner i is qi and the purchase strategy of
miner i is si. The set of price of computational resource for
miners is Q = {q1, q2, . . . ,qn, . . ., qN}, and qi ∈ [qmin, qmax]
where qmin and qmax are the minimum and maximum prices,
respectively. The set of purchase strategy (purchased amount) is
S = {s1, s2, . . ., sn, . . ., sN} and si ∈ [smin, smax] where smin
and smax are the minimum and maximum computational re-
sources purchased by miner i, respectively. Meanwhile, we
assume that all the hash power used for mining is purchased
from the ESP and the hash power proportion of miner i in the
whole blockchain network is αi, which is
αi =
si∑
j∈N sj
. (1)
During the computing process, we assume that the probability
that miner i successfully solves the PoW problem is μi. Con-
sidering the miner’s solution to the PoW problem follows the
Poisson distribution with a compliance parameter λ [12], μi can
be expressed as
μi = αie
−λti (2)
where the computing delay ti is related to the block size πb of
each block b. We can consider it as follows:
ti = ςiπb (3)
where ςi is a constant parameter for miner i. Taking Bitcoin
as an example, the time for generating new blocks is generally
around 10 min, which meansλ = 1
600 s . Similarly, we assume that
the probability that the miner successfully reports the solutions
of the PoW problem from verification is νi. Also, we consider
the miner’s solution to the PoW problem follows the Poisson
distribution with a compliance parameter γ, then we have
νi = αie
−γτi (4)
where τi is the delay, which is also related to the block size, and
we assume
τi = ξiπb (5)
where ξi is a constant parameter for miner i. For simplicity,
we assume for each block, the size is equal, which means
πb = π. Meanwhile, the process of verification would consume
less computational resources and shorter processing time than
computing the PoW. For example, we can consider the value to
be γ = 1
60 s .
When there are new tasks and transactions, they are first being
verified. After successful verification, the task will be published
to the blockchain. After that, if it is successfully solved through
general consensus algorithm, a new block will be generated on a
certain chain. We assume that the new block would be generated
at the beginning of the pseudogenesis block. For single rational
miner i, there are generally two effective mining schemes. One
is that the miner can obtain the reward from single-block genera-
tion and the other one is from a chain of blocks or branched chain.
However, miner imay face the risk that the others can report their
results after computing before him. Thus, there are two mining
and reporting schemes: immediate reporting after successfully
computing (IR) and strategically reporting after successfully
computing (SR). The main difference is that whether a miner
prefer to publish the solution immediately to award from single
block or to publish after generating a chain of blocks.

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Rewards
In the process of block generation, there are three types of
rewards for the miners: fixed reward, performance reward, and
participant reward.
1) The fixed rewardRf is the constant reward for computing
the newly generated block. For example, for Bitcoin,
a new block would be generated approximately every
10 min and the bonus generated by the Bitcoin has been
halved every four years. Therefore, the fixed reward of
blockchain can be regarded as an attenuation function of
which the half-life is T . That is
Rf = Rmax
f
(
1
2
) t
T
(6)
where Rmax
f is the constant reward from genesis block.
2) The performance reward Rp is related to the volume of
transactions contained within the generated block, e.g.,
the size of each block. We have following definition:
Rp = rπ (7)
where r is an evaluation factor and π is the size of block.
3) The participant reward Rε, i depends on the degree of
participation in the computing process while the new
block is generated, i.e.,
Rε,i = εαi (8)
where ε is an evaluation factor.
B. Stackelberg Game
In this article, we investigate the profits for miners and ESP by
introducing a two-stage Stackelberg game. We define the ESP as
the “leader” and the miner as the “follower” in the game model.
In the first stage, the ESP sets the price based on the services
provided to the miners and in the second stage, miners determine
the demand for computational resources based on the price set
in the first stage, the cost, and rewards. The formulated game
is divided into two stages, and the utility functions of ESP and
miners in each stage can be described in the following.
1) In the first stage, the ESP will have the pricing strategy
Q = {q1, q2, . . .} and the utility/profit function is
UESP(S,Q) =
N∑
i
si (qi − c) (9)
where c is the cost of providing resources of the ESP,
which is related to power consumption and hardware loss,
etc.
2) In the second stage, the purchase strategy of miner i is si
and the utility/profit function of i is
Ui(S,Q) = μiνiα
2
i (Rf +Rp) +Rε,i − qisi − ci
(10)
where ci is the cost of miner i.
Accordingly, at each stage, the problem can be formulated n
in the following.
1) In the first stage, the game of the ESP aims at addressing
problem (P1)
P1 : max
Q
Ui(S,Q)
s.t. qi ∈ [qmin, qmax] .
2) In the second stage, to maximize the profit of the miners,
the optimization problem at miner i is formulated as
P2 : max
S
Ui(S,Q)
s.t. si ∈ [smin, smax] .
C. Stackelberg Equilibrium
Based on our presented Stackelberg game model, we can bring
the definition of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) as follows.
Definition 1: Let Q∗ be a solution for P1 and S∗ denotes a
solution for P2, Then, the point (S∗,Q∗) is an SE for the game
if for any (S,Q), the following conditions are fulfilled:
UESP (S∗,Q∗) ≥ UESP (S,Q)
Ui (S∗,Q∗) ≥ Ui (S,Q) .
We can see that from the definition, a two-stage iterative
algorithm is required to reach an SE. In the first stage, the
ESP sets a price of the resources. Then, the miners can compete
in a noncooperative fashion in the second stage. After the NE
is reached, the ESP will reset the price based on the purchase
strategies of the miners. This two-stage update will iterate until
the conditions in Definition 1 are satisfied. In this article, we will
apply the backward induction to find the SE of the formulated
game. Backward induction is to solve the equilibrium of the
dynamic game from the last stage of the dynamic game, which
can simplify the multistage dynamic game into several single-
stage subgames [21]. The backward induction is essentially the
reverse derivation from the latter stage to the forward stage in
the two-stage game. Through the analysis of subgame of each
stage, the local optimal strategy can be reached and the global
optimal solution of the whole game is derived.
IV. INCENTIVE MECHANISM FOR MINING
A. IR Scheme
1) Game of Miners in IR: At first, we study the existence of
NE and then to provide the uniqueness. In the IR scheme, we
assume the miners can successfully announce the solution after
computing, which means νi = 1. To simplify the calculation, in
the following, we use uesp = UESP(S,Q), and ui = Ui(S,Q),
and we assume
Rc = Rf +Rp. (11)
First, we will provide the proof of existence for NE under the
considered game model. After some calculations, we can see
that ui is strictly convex with respect to si. Accordingly, we can
arrive the following lemmas and theorems.
Lemma 1: The strategy set A of this game is a nonempty
convex and compact set, and the utility function is a continuous
function.

CHANG et al.: INCENTIVE MECHANISM FOR EDGE-COMPUTING-BASED BLOCKCHAIN 7109
Proof: There areN pricing strategies of ESP in the first stage,
and the domain is (0, qmax)
N×1 among them, where qmax is the
maximum price and × is Cartesian product. In the second stage,
there are N purchase strategies of miners, and the domain is
(0, smax)
l×1, where smax is the maximum. Then, the domain of
all elements of this Stackelberg game is AN×N . As there is at
least one strategy, the solution set is a nonempty set. In addition,
as we have proved, the utility function is a strictly convex
function. We can also see the sets are convex sets. Therefore,
both of the strategy sets are nonempty convex sets. In addition,
the domain of the set has its upper bound, which means it is a
compact set. Therefore, it can be proved that the set of strategy is
nonempty convex and compact. Moreover, we can easily observe
that the function is continuous. �
Lemma 2: The considered game is finite, i.e., the number of
miners and ESP is denumerable, and the strategy set is limited.
Proof: Due to the limited rewards in the generation of new
block, there would be a finite number of game participants:
ESP and miners. Although the demand sets of miners S =
{s1, s2, . . .} and the strategy set of ESP Q = {q1, q2, . . .} may
have infinite number of elements, as shown in the proof of
Lemma 1, both of them are bounded closed sets. �
Theorem 1: If the complete information static game is finite,
i.e., the number of miners and ESP is denumerable, and the
pure strategy involved is limited, then there must be at least one
NE (S∗,Q∗), where the profits of ESP and miners can reach
optimum.
Proof: Similar proof can be found in [23] (see “Existence of
Equilibrium Points”). Due to limitation of the space, we omit
here. �
We have shown the existence of the NE and next we can derive
the uniqueness of the NE.
Theorem 2: The defined utility functions have the fixed
points.
Proof: From Lemma 1, the strategy set A of this game is a
nonempty convex and compact set, and the utility functions are
continuous. Therefore, the defined utility functions must have
the fixed points [22]. Due to the limitation of the space, detailed
proof can be found in [22] (“2.3 Fixed Point Problems” about
the application of fixed point theorems), so we omit here. �
Theorem 3: The NE that obtains the optimal profits for min-
ers and ESP must be the fixed point of the utility function [25].
Proof: Similar proof can be found in [24] (see “2.3 Fixed
Point Problems” about the application of fixed point theorems
and the expression of Nash’s earlier studies by using “Brouwer’s
theorem” to prove NE in [22]), due to limitation of the space,
we omit here. �
Next, we demonstrate the uniqueness of NE upon the method
of a standard function [25]. First, we present the definition of a
standard function.
Definition 2: A general function f(x) can be seen as a stan-
dard function when it satisfy the conditions as follows.
1) Positivity
∀x ∈ X, f(x) > 0. (12)
2) Monotonicity
∀x1, x2 ∈ X, x1 ≤ x2, f (x1) ≤ f (x2) . (13)
3) Scalability
∀ρ > 1, x ∈ X, f (ρx) ≤ ρ · f(x). (14)
Accordingly, in the following, we will prove that the strategy
function is a standard function. As we have shown in Theorems
2 and 3, there are at least one NE and it is the fixed point. Then,
we have
(s∗) = (f (s∗1) , f (s∗2) , . . ., f (s∗N )) . (15)
For miner i, f(si) is the purchase strategy. Then, we set
∂ui
∂si
= 0 and obtain
∑
j∈N
sj =
√
(μRc + ε) ·∑j �=i sj
q
. (16)
As we know
si =
∑
j∈N
sj −
∑
i�=j
sj (17)
and we can substitute (16) into (17) and get
s∗i = f (si) =
√
(μiRc + ε) ·∑i�=j sj
qi
−
∑
i�=j
sj . (18)
Then, we can arrive the following lemma and theorem.
Lemma 3: The strategy function of miner i is a standard
function.
Proof: We will prove the lemma according to the definition
of a standard function. As si is the purchase strategy of miner
i and we have given the expression of f(si) in (18), so we can
obtain that
∀si ∈ S, f (si) > 0. (19)
Next, we assume that s1, s2(s1 ∈ S, s2 ∈ S), and s1 < s2,
and after substituting it into (18), we can obtain that
f(s1)− f(s2)
= −
(√∑
j �=1
sj −

j �=2
sj
)√
(μiRc+ε)
q

j �=1
sj −
√∑
j �=2
sj
)⎛⎝∑
j �=2

∑
j �=1
sj
⎞
⎠. (20)
As s1 < s2, we can see
√∑
j �=1 sj −
√∑
j �=2 sj > 0, which
means f(s1)− f(s2) ≤ 0. Considering ∀ρ > 1, we have
ρf(si)− f(ρsi) = (ρ−√
ρ)
√
(μiRc + ε) ·∑i�=j sj
qi
> 0.
(21)
Then, all the conditions of a standard function have been
satisfied. �
Theorem 4: If the strategy function of miner i is a standard
function, and there must be only one NE in the space of strategy
set [25].
We have proved the existence and uniqueness of NE of the
second stage of the game. The existence and uniqueness of NE
of the first stage can also be provided using a similar approach.

Then, we can obtain the optimal strategy of miners by apply-

From (16), we can obtain that

Correspondingly, we can obtain the optimal strategy as follows:
si
∗ =
N − 1∑
j∈N
qi
μRc+ε
−
(
N − 1∑
j∈N
qi
μRc+ε
)2
· qi
μRc + ε
. (26)
2) Game of ESP in IR: In the first stage, the pricing strategy
of ESP depends on the service demand si. When we get the
NE of the second stage, then we can try to find the best pricing
strategy for ESP to obtain the optimal profits. After substituting
(26) into (9), one can arrive
uesp = (qi − c1)
(N − 1)
∑
j∈N
(
e−λtiRc + ε
)
qi
− (qi − c1)
(N − 1)2
(∑
j∈N (e−λtiRc + ε)
)2
qi (e−λtiRc + ε)
.
(27)
Then, with some calculations, we can see that uesp is also a
convex function with respect to qi. Accordingly, there must be
Q∗, which enables ESP to obtain the optimal profits. The proofs
of existence and uniqueness are similar to the ones in the second
stage. With the optimal purchase strategy s∗i of miner i, we will
obtain the optimal pricing strategy q∗i . In other words, under
the combination of the strategy (S∗,Q∗), both the miners and
the ESP can achieve the optimal profit, which is essentially the
SE of the game. We could then apply the KKT conditions and
Lagrangian method to solve the P1 to find the optimal q∗i .
In the IR scheme, the existence and uniqueness of NE of each
stage of the formulated game model can be proved according to
the presented theorems. The backward induction method is used
to solve the SE of the two-stage Stackelberg game to obtain the
global optimal solution. First, the optimal purchase strategy of
the miners in the second stage is solved. Then, we can obtain
the pricing strategy of the ESP in the first stage.
B. SR Scheme
When miners decide to participate in mining, some of the
miners may choose to temporarily hide their solutions of com-
plex transactions due to their stronger hash power. We assume
rational miners who are with stronger hash power, i.e., a certain
level of hash power, would tend to utilize the SR mining scheme
instead of IR to get a better reward. However, the miner who
would like to choose SR will suffer a higher risk as the other
miners may report their solutions before it. In this article, we
do not consider the situation of “orphan”-like to avoid the folk
game with different branches [26]. That is, although the miner i
can obtain a better reward when choosing SR, it will suffer more
risk to generate a chain of abandoned blocks.
Similar to the solution of the IR, we advocate the backward
induction and first study the second stage.
1) Game of Miners in SR: After successfully mining block
m, miner i who select the SR has the utility function that

(28)
In the following, we also assume uSR
i,m = USR
i,m(S,Q). First,
we take the first-order and second-order derivatives of (28) with
respect to si, and we can obtain

Then, we can conclude that ∂2u2
∂si2 < 0, which means that the
utility function is convex. When we set ∂u2

Then, we assume a content-specified function l(s), set the
equation θ =

∑
j �=i sj = θ − si,
and
l(si) = 2mR1e

(

)
si
− (εθ2 − qθ3
)
. (35)
When we set the equation l(si) = 0, we can see that the
discriminant is
Δ =

)2
+ 8mR1e

Meanwhile, under the condition of the axis of symmetry, si =
εti−2mR1e
−λti−γτi t
−4mR1e−λti−γτi
> 0, that is, the axis of symmetry is the right
of the origin. According to Vieta Theorem, it can be known that
the relation between the two roots is s1
is
2
i =
εt2−qt3
2mR1e−λti−γτi
< 0;
then, we can see that equation l(si) = 0 has only one positive
root. Also, we assume s2
i > s1
i when the domain of strategy is
si ∈ [smin, smax], there must be only one root
s2
i =

φ2
i + 8mR1e−λti−γτi (εt2 − qt3)

which makes condition
∂uSR

∂si
= 0 satisfied, and φi =
(εti −mR1e
−λti−γτiti). Therefore, the optimal purchase strat-
egy for the miner who chooses the SR can be found in
Under condition (1), we can conclude that
α∗
i ≥
2qis∗i
mR1e−λti−γτi + ε
. (39)
Then, miner i can obtain optimal profit uSR
i,m

Then, we take the first-order and second-order derivatives of
(40) with respect to αi
∂uSR
i,m
∂αi
= 2e−λti−γτimR1αi + ε > 0 (41)
and
∂2uSR
i
∂α2
i
= 2e−λti−γτimR1 > 0. (42)
Thus, it can be seen that for the miner who chooses the strategy
to report the solution strategically, the higher the proportion of
computational resource leads to a higher reward.
2) Game of ESP in SR: In the first stage, we can substitute
the optimal strategy (38) shown at the bottom of this page,
into ESP’s utility function (9) and can obtain (43) shown at
the bottom of the next page. Then, we take the first-order and
second-order derivatives of (43) with respect to qi; then, we
would conclude that the utility functionuesp of the ESP is strictly
convex. Therefore, according to the previous analysis, there is an
NE of the game. According to (40), we can obtain the optimal
mining strategy S∗ for miner i and could obtain the optimal
pricing strategy Q∗ for ESP by applying the KKT condition.
The method of backward induction is used to seek the SE to
maximize the profit of participants of the overall game
Therefore, we can see that for both IR and SR schemes,
Stackelberg equilibria exist. That is, there are strategies (S∗,Q∗)
enabling the miner and ESP to obtain the optimal profits for both
mining schemes.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
To simplify the evaluation, we assume the miner has no hash
power, which means that all the hash power should be purchased
from the ESP. Some key simulation parameters are from [9]
and [10].
Fig. 2 presents the relations between the computing capability
αi and the profit of the miner. It can be found that, for the IR
scheme, as we consider the probability of successful reporting
is 1, it has a better performance than the SR scheme. It is mainly
due to the fact that in the SR scheme, the miner has to buy more
resources due to the competition, which induce higher cost. In
addition, we can see that when α is small, the benefit is basically
negative. That is mainly because when α is small, the obtained
reward is smaller than the cost. It can also be found that the profit
increases as the size of block gets bigger.
In Fig. 3, we plot the impact of the size of the transaction
in each block on the profit of the miners. In this figure, the
performance of IR scheme is presented. As we can see, as the
size of the block increases, the profits first become larger, then
decrease after reaching the maximum value. When the size of
a block increases, the time and complexity of computing PoW
are incremental. Therefore, after reaching the maximum, the
cost dominates the performance of profit no matter what kind of
computing capability is considered. Moreover, when computing
capability increases, the performance get better.
Fig. 4 shows the size of the transaction in each block on the
probability of successful reporting/rewarding. In this figure, the

performance of both IR and SR schemes are illustrated. Gener-
ally, the IR scheme has a better performance than the SR scheme.
As the size of the block increases, the probability of successful
reporting/rewarding decreases. This is mainly due to the fact
that complexity of computing is incremental. More hash power
is used for computing purpose and increasing the computing
capability can help to get a better performance. In addition, if
more transactions or users are considered, the proposed scheme
is able to allocate more resources to the users with demand in
order to obtain the optimal utility.
Fig. 5 illustrates the relationship between the computing
capability αi and the profits of the miner under different forms
of reward composition. In this figure, the larger the coefficient
e is, the greater the proportional rewards will be. First, when
the performance reward coefficient is increased, the increase
of miners’ reward can be observed under the condition of the
same participation reward (i.e., Rε,i) and computing capability.
We can also observe that the profits of the miners increase
significantly with the increase of the coefficient e, whereas the
performance reward evaluation factor r and the computing ca-
pability αi remain constant. When different reward coefficients
are selected, the rewards available to the miners increase with
the increase of computing capability. This is mainly due to
the participation reward, which is directly determined by the
proportion of the computing capability contributed when solving
the PoW puzzle.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, we investigated the incentive mechanism under
the edge-computing-enabled blockchain. To encourage the par-
ticipation of blockchain and find the optimal profits for miners

and ESP, we formulated a two-stage Stackelberg game model to
maximize the profits under the two mining schemes. First, we
provided proof of the existence and uniqueness of NE of each
stage. Then, the optimal solutions were presented and backward
induction was introduced to find the Stackelberg equilibria.
Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we have proved the
effectiveness of the proposed inventive mechanism. In the future,
we will focus on in-depth study of the incentive mechanism. In
particular, we would like to focus on the case where multiple
ESPs coexit in the system. Then, we turn to investigate the
cooperation and competition of multiple ESPs when providing
resources to the miners/nodes, by utilizing game-theoretic ap-
proaches.
