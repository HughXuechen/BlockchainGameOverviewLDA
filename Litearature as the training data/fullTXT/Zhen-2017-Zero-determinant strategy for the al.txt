Abstract: The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm guarantees the safety and dependability of Blockchain systems. 
Miners can achieve a consensus through the PoW algorithm during the mining process, that is mutual attacking. However, when 
the miners attack each other, all miners earn less. In this paper, we established a model that mining between two miners is an 
iterative game, and proposed a subclass of ZD strategy (a pining strategy) to alleviate miners’ dilemma, a miner can control 
another miner’s payoff and increase the social revenue through a pinning strategy. Numerical simulation results verify the 
effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In summary, this work leads to the better understanding and analysis of the PoW algorithm 
via the game theory, rendering it possible to design a more rational consensus algorithm in the future.

1 Introduction 
The blockchain is a distributed shared ledger [1], 
maintained by all the participants in bitcoin system [2]. As 
the most successful application of blockchain, bitcoin relies 
on the participation in the PoW consensus of distributed 
network nodes to complete the verification and record of 
transactions [3], it also products a set of database with 
sequential, not be tampered and trustworthy [4]. Through 
complicated checking mechanism, blockchain database can 
maintain the integrity, continuity and consistency of data, 
even if some participants make mistakes, they cannot change 
blockchain integrity, and tamper with the trading data yet. In 
brief, blockchain technology [5] involving key points 
include: decentralized, trustless, collectively maintain, 
reliable database, time stamp, asymmetric cryptography, and 
so on. 
The PoW is a kind of incentive mechanism in blockchain, 
and the core concept of PoW is to guarantee the consistency 
of data and the safety of consensus through the power 
competition of miners, namely, mining. In bitcion system, 
nodes competition with each other based on the power of 
them respective mine, to collectively work out a SHA256 
mathematical problems which is solved complicated but 
easily verified, the node fastest to solve complex problems 
will acquire the right of recording block and the currency 
reward with the system automatically generate bitcions, that 
is this node successfully mines a block. 
In the bitcoin system, miners are the participants that mine 
blocks. It is vulnerable for the open pool since each miner 
can join this pool by providing a network ID number. 
Because the currency system produces a block in about 10 
minutes, it is extremely difficult for most of the miners to 
produce a block during a certain period of time. In order to 
increase the likelihood of stable revenues, many miners 
choose to join an open pool by cooperating with other miners

[6]. Many miners spend plenty of computing power on 
creating a block. In other words, producing block is to solve 
a complex problem, or to generate a full poof of work. 
Miners get the corresponding payoff through sending poof of 
work to the pool, while they might as well send partial proof 
of work to the open pool since a full pool of work is difficulty 
to be discovered. Moreover, this pool allocates equality 
according to the contributed power ratio in whole system. 
However, a miner can sabotage an open pool by seemingly 
joining it but never sharing its power. The attacker only 
sends a partial proof of work to pool, and discards the full 
proof of work when it is discovered. This situation is called 
block withholding attack [7]. In an open pool, miners choose 
either to attack or cooperate with other miners to gain its own 
payoff. When all miners attack each other, they earn less than 
that they would have if none had attacked, that is the mining 
dilemma [8-9] in PoW consensus process, this dilemma also 
corresponds to the famous of Prisoner’s Dilemma in the 
game theory [10], namely, it is the optimal choice for 
individual to attack, but not the best for system. Similarly, for 
all miners mine in an open pool, whether or not attack is a 
miner’s dilemma, attack is the best choose for one miner, 
while attack will make the system obtain a low welfare. With 
the purpose that promoting miners cooperatively mine in 
pool, to get a high social revenue, it is necessary to develop 
or optimize the incentive mechanisms to promote 
cooperative mine in PoW consensus algorithm in blockchain 
[11-13].  
PoW consensus mechanism aims at ensuring the 
consistency of bitcoin distributed accounting system. 
Unfortunately, it also holds many shortcomings. There are 
some improved consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Stake 
(PoS) [14], which changes the power of the PoW into the 
system rights, greater ownership of player has greater 
probability of becoming the next to account. PoS is both 
energy saving and time saving, while it is prone to fork, and 
also needed to mine. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) [15] 
depending on PoS plays the role of accounting professionals, 
in which the accounts are kept by the player selected by the 
rights. It significantly reduces the number of nodes involved 
in authentication and accounting, and reaches the second

level of consensus verification. Whereas it still relies on 
tokens. The Verified Pool [16] based on the traditional 
distribution consensus technology uses data verification 
mechanism. It works without tokens, keeping a low degree of 
decentration. The Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
algorithm [17] selects bookkeepers selected by the rights to 
achieve a consensus, which maximizes the integrity of the 
system but also forks a lot. None of the present consensus 
mechanisms is perfect or apt to all the application scenarios. 
Lewenberg Y et. al. [18] propose an alternative structure to the 
chain for higher rates, and analyzes the security protocol to 
decrease the attacks between miners. Moreover, a new 
protocol that just uses cryptography principle without 
generating cryptogram is proposed to guarantee the 
transactional privacy [19]. A new method that weights tuning 
laws in critic neural networks to achieve a Nash Equilibrium 
to assure the system stability is presented in [20]. Optimal 
control scheme methods are also proposed for nonlinear 
systems, for example, the iterative two-stage dual heuristic 
programming [21] or the adaptive dynamic programming 
[22], are  based on the change of  system state. 
In order to prevent participants from being trapped in a 
prisoner's dilemma [23-24], the ZD strategy [25-26] is 
employed as a probabilistic and conditional strategy in the 
iterated game to cope with the “free-riding” problem. With 
the ZD strategies, the player is able to unilaterally set the 
expected utility of an opponent or a ratio of the player’s 
expected payoff to its opponent’s, whatever the opponent’s 
strategy is. 
The zero-determinant (ZD) strategy is applied in many 
fields. It is used in wireless communication for cooperation 
of resource sharing in many works [27-30]. In [31], the ZD 
strategy is applied in iterated public goods game, while in 
[32], Ashraf et al. model the secondary sharing of wireless 
spectrum as an iterated game, and a ZD strategy is used to 
control the outcome of opponents in a certain range or to 
achieve any feasible outcome.  
To avoid a low social welfare since miners attack each 
other, we consider a LM, a loyal miner who cares about the 
whole pool revenue, and a SM, a selfish miner who only 
concerns about its own payoff and manages to get high 
reward, and take the mining as an iterated game. At each 
game iteration, both the LM and the SM choose to cooperate 
or to attack. Derived from the original ZD strategies 
proposed by Press and Dyson [24], we put forward a 
subclass ZD strategy, a pinning strategy, for the LM, to 
control the payoff of SM unilaterally at a threshold value, 
and ultimately to increase the welfare of society, no matter 
what the strategy of SM is. 
The rest of this paper is organized as followings: Section 2 
analyzes the miner’s dilemma in an open pool, and builds 
system model. In Section 3, we propose a pinning strategy to 
optimize the mining model in the PoW consensus process, 
then the game analysis is given. Numerical simulation’s 
analysis and results are presented in Section 4. Finally, we 
give the conclusion in Section 5. 
2 System Model 
In an open pool, when a loyal miner sends a full or partial 
proof of work to the pool, he will be allocated with a fair 
reward depending on its contributed power. Unfortunately, 
some miners may not work faithfully, they launch a classical 
block withholding attack, by just sending partial proof of 
work, and abandoning the full proof of work whenever it is 
found. In addition, the attacked pool will divide its welfare 
equally among all the attackers, therefore each miner,  
containing the attackers certainly, earns less because the 
attackers will get less than that they do not attack. However, 
in some cases, attackers will gain higher payoff than the price 
they paid, that is the “free riding” theory in mining.  
The LMs mine regularly with their power consumed. The 
cooperation in an open pool increases the probability of 
block generating, and also expands the expected payoff. 
Miners in an open pool will face a prisoners’ dilemma. 
Suppose that the power consuming is c, the enlarging 
multiples of payoff is r (r>1), r (1-c)>1/2, and c>1/2. We 
consider there are two miners mining in pool, LM and SM, 
each miner has two strategies: cooperation (C) and attack (A), 
when regularly mine, the two miners’ payoffs are 1 and the 
payoff in different strategies is expressed as: 
LM 
SM C A 
C r/2-c  r/2-c 1/2-c  1/2 
A 1/2    1/2-c 0      0 
In the open pool, the interaction between LM and SM is 
regarded as an iterative game. At each iteration, we model 
the mining between the LM and SM as a single stage of 
prisoner’s dilemma game. When the combination of their 
strategies is (C, C), the payoff of LM and SM are RL
R, RS
R 
respectively. When the strategy combination is (C, A), the 
payoffs are RL
S, RS
T. Given the combination of (A, C), the 
payoffs are RL
T, RS
S, and when (A, A), the payoffs are RL
P, 
RS
P, respectively. With the payoff matrix, RL
R = r/2-c, RS
R = 
r/2-c, RL
S = 1/2-c, RS
T = 1/2, RL
T = 1/2, RS
S = 1/2-c, RL
P = 0, 
RS
P = 0. 
In the iterated game, it is proved that the long-memory 
player has no advantage over the short-memory player when 
each stage game is iterated identically infinite times [24]. 
Hence, we suppose the two miners have memory of only one 
single previous move, in other words, at current iteration of 
the game, the actions of both miners only depend on the 
payoffs of the previous round. When take an iterated process 
of game into account, both LM’s and SM’s mixed strategies 
are supposed as p = [p1, p2, p3, p4] and q = [q1, q2, q3, q4] for 
their probabilities of cooperation based on the previous 
iteration, cooperation or attacking strategies. Namely, p and 
q represent the transition probability vectors for the 
cooperation state in the next state. When the two miners 
adopted cooperation in the previous stage, and the LM 
chooses cooperation at present, the conditional probability 
of LM is p1, and the conditional probability for SM to choose 
cooperation strategy is q1. When both the LM and the SM 
choose to attack, their conditional probabilities are (1-p1) 
and (1-q1) respectively. Similarly, when the LM and the SM 
choose different strategies in the previous stage, the 
conditional probability for LM and SM to take cooperation 
strategy is shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2. 
In the following section, we consider the case where two 
miners mine in an open pool, one miner is a LM, the other is 
a SM. The pinning strategy for the LM, a subclass of the ZD 
strategy, is proposed to promote SM to mine cooperatively,

3 Game Analysis  
Following the above game model, we define X, Y to 
represent the LM’s and SM’s actions, X�[C, A], Y�[C, A]. 
Under the initial conditions, the procedure of the repeated 
game is a stochastic process. Label the payoffs of the 
previous strategy as 1, 2, 3 and 4, with the payoff XY�[CC, 
CA, AC, AA]. With the payoff matrix, the payoff vector of 
LM in four different states is RL=[RL
R, RL
S, RL
T, RL
P]T=[r/2-c, 
1/2-c, 1/2, 0]T, and that of the SM is RS=[RS
R, RS
T, RS
S, RS
P]T 
=[r/2-c, 1/2, 1/2-c, 0]T.  
An iterated game can be represented with the Markov 
process, and the state transition of Markov process is 
completely determined by p and q, hence the Markov 
transition matrix M(p, q) is defined as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Define the stationary vector of Markov matrix M as v = [v1, 
v2, v3, v4]T, where v1, v2, v3 and v4 are the four different states 
of probabilities, (C, C), (C, A), (A, C), (A, A), and v1 + v2 + 
v3 + v4=1. Since M has a unit eigenvalue, denote IMM

where I  is a unit matrix, and M� is a singular matrix. We 
have

According to the Cramer’s ruler, the M� and its adjugate 
matrix )(adj M� meet

Following equation (2) and (3), v is proportional to every 
row of )(adj M� .With the Laplace expansion rule, )(det M� is 
equal to the last row of )(adj M� dot product the last column 
of M� , and the last column is replaced by an arbitrary four 
vector f=[f1, f2, f3, f4]T, so that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In equation (4), the second column of D(p, q, f ) is controlled 
only by LM, While the third column of D(p, q, f ) is  
controlled by SM, define

where α, β, γ are non-zero parameters.  
When the LM takes strategies of αRL, βRS, or a linear 
combination of them, he will have the possibility of choosing 
unilateral strategies to make the determinant in numerator 
vanish. Similarly, the same about SM. e.i., if the LM adopts a 
strategy which satisfies p=αRL+βRS+γ1, or the SM takes a 
strategy with q=αRL+βRS+γ1, then the determinant vanishes. 
Accordingly, between the LM and the SM expected payoffs

When the parameters α and β have different value, we have 
different subclass of ZD strategies. 
The pinning strategy is one of the subclass of ZD strategy, 
in which a miner could control the payoff of another miner, 
no matter what strategy the other miner takes. Taking a 
pinning strategy with α=0, a LM can determine the payoff of

In equation (10) and (11), when p1 and p4 approaches 1 
and 0 respectively, p2 tends to 1 from 0 while p3 draws near 
to 0 from 1. In equation (12) and (13), when p1 gets gradually 
close to 1, regardless of the value of p4, the payoff of the SM 
approaches (r/2-c), the payoff of the LM also gets closer to 
(r/2-c). The payoff of the SM converges to 0 when p4 
approaches to 0 no matter what the value of p1 is. However, 
the LM’s payoff is c(r-2c)/(r-1) not 0. That is, LM can set the 
payoff of the SM into a range, from mutual cooperation to 
mutual attack, no matter what strategies the SM takes, while 
its own payoff changes along with the strategy it chooses. 
With the pinning strategy, the LM also tries to control its 
own payoff by setting p=αRL+γ1 and αUL+γ=0. We pin p1 
and p4 yet, p2 and p3 can be solved as,

p2 and p3 are conditional probabilities, and 10 2 �� p , 
10 3 �� p . Given the conditional probabilities of LM, p1=1, 
p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, the conditional probability vector of LM is 
p=[1, 1, 0, 0], which means that if LM took a cooperation 
strategy at previous stage, it will choose to continue  
cooperation at this stage. Analogously, it tends to choose to 
attack other miners at the present stage if he did attack others 
at the previous stage. In short, if the LM always chose to 
cooperate or attack, it can’t control himself payoff 
unilaterally. 
Theorem 1: When LM takes a pinning strategy, it can 
unilaterally set the payoff of SM within a range from 0 to 
r/2-c, regardless of the SM’s strategy. The SM’s payoff is 
proportional to r but inversely proportional to c. while the 
LM can’t control its own payoff even with any subclass of 
ZD strategy. 
4 Simulation Results  
In this section, different scenarios are illustrated to appraise 
the performance of the proposed pinning strategies in the 
iterated mining dilemma. In the first three scenarios as shown 
in Fig.3, LM takes the pinning strategy, the WSFS strategy 
(namely, p=[1, 0, 0, 1]), and the TFT strategy (namely, p=[1, 
0, 1, 0]), respectively, while the SM adopts the WSFS 
strategy all the time. In the following three cases shown in 
Fig.4, the LM uses the pinning strategy, the WSFS strategy, 
and the TFT strategy, respectively, while the SM takes the 
TFT strategy all along. In the rest four cases (Fig.5), the LM 
also takes the four different strategies while the SM adopts 
different strategies, q=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], respectively. 
Without losing generality, set α=0, β=-8, the factor expand 
multiples of payoff r=2, and consume of outcome c=2/3. The 
revenue vectors of the LM and SM in four states are RL=[1/3, 
-1/6, 1/2, 0]T and RS=[1/3, 1/2, -1/6, 0]T, respectively. 
 
Fig. 3. The LM takes different strategy and the SM adopts the 
WSFS strategy  
 
Fig. 4. The LM takes different strategy and the SM adopts the TFT 
strategy. 
In Fig. 3, the SM always takes a WSFS strategy, while the 
LM takes the pining strategy, and the payoff of SM is kept to 
a specific value 1/3, which means that the LM can either set 
the payoff of SM or control the SM to choose to cooperate 
with the LM through a pinning strategy. When the LM takes 
a WSFS strategy, the payoff of the SM is pinned at a fixed 
value. While the LM adopts a TFT strategy, the payoff of SM 
is fixed as 1/6, which isn’t the maximum value. When the 
LM applies [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] strategy, the payoff of the SM 
is pinned at a relatively low value. Therefore, when SM takes 
a WSFS strategy, the best strategy for LM is the pinning 
strategy or the WSFS strategy, while the worst is [0.1, 0.2, 
0.3, 0.4]. 
In Fig.4, the SM implements a TFT strategy and the LM 
adopts a pinning strategy. The welfare of the SM is fixed at a 
certain value, and both miners mine cooperatively. When the 
LM takes a WSFS strategy or a TFT strategy, the payoff of 
the SM is lower than that in the case that they cooperate with

each other. When the LM applies the strategy of [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 
0.4], the payoff of the SM gets a low value. In short, when 
SM takes a TFT strategy, the best choice for the LM is the 
pinning strategy, and the worst is [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]. 
In Fig. 5, the LM takes the pinning strategy, and the SM 
cooperates with the LM gradually to improve its payoff 
When the LM takes a WSFS strategy, the payoff of SM gets 
reduced. If the LM applies a TFT strategy or the [0.1, 0.2, 
0.3, 0.4] strategy, SM will be rewarded with the lowest 
value. 
As for the first situation shown in Fig. 3-5, as long as the 
LM takes the pinning strategy during mining, it could set the 
payoff of the SM approach gradually to 1/3, e.i., the LM 
could control SM to select a cooperative strategy after a 
certain number of iterations. 
In Fig. 6, when the SM takes a WSFS strategy and the LM 
adopts the pinning strategy or a WSFS strategy, the revenue

of the society could achieve a high value, where both of the 
miners choose to cooperate in mining. Once the LM takes 
TFT strategy or [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] strategy, the revenue of 
society couldn’t be satisfied. When the SM applies a WSFS 
strategy, the best choice for the LM is to take a pinning or 
WSFS strategy, while the worst strategy is [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 
0.4]. 
In Fig. 7 where the LM adopts a pinning strategy, the 
society’s revenue reaches a relatively high value. When the 
LM applies a WSFS or TFT strategy, the system gets lower 
benefits. When the LM takes [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], the society’s 
revenue is the lowest. 
In Fig. 8, when LM applies a pinning strategy, the 
society’s revenue can be satisfied. When LM applies WSFS, 
the system gets the lower benefits. When LM takes TFT 
strategy or [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], the society’s revenue falls to 
the lowest point.

As shown in Fig.6-8, the LM just takes a pinning strategy 
in mining, regardless of the strategy that the SM takes, the 
society revenue reaches a relative high value. Especially, 
when the SM takes a WSFS strategy, too, the revenue of 
society gets the highest value. In such a way, the LM can set 
society’s revenue after a certain number of iterations, no 
matter what the SM’s strategy is. 
5 Conclusion  
In this paper, we analyze the miners’ dilemma in the PoW 
consensus process, and optimize the PoW consensus through 
game theory. To prevent the two miners to attack each other, 
we propose a pinning strategy, a subclass of ZD strategy, 
which can set the payoff of SM and therefore improve the 
social revenue Simulation results confirm that when the LM 
takes a pinning strategy, the bitcoin system obtains relative 
higher social revenue, regardless of the SM’s strategy. 
Besides, we have proved that the LM can’t control its own 
payoff with any strategy. 
Based on the analysis of the pinning strategy, we find that 
the payoff of SM is proportional to r but inversely 
proportional to c. Hence, to improve the probability of the 
SM’s cooperation and increase the revenue of society, the 
blockchain system can be optimized by improving the value 
of r or reducing the value of c, or applying a pinning strategy.
