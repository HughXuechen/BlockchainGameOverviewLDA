on the principles of gamification enhanced by a blockchain based token system and
crowdsourcing as methods to collect and utilise spatial data such as the location and
the size of previously unused heat sources. The mobile platform-neutral HotCity
App en ables users to collectively patrol the city in search of waste heat sources and
to gain tokens that can be exchanged for rewards. The blockchain platform Ardor
was used for cheat proofing and to enable transparency for the reward system. The
field test conducted in winter 2020/2021 showed high usability scores as well as high
acceptance ratings of our approach opening up new use case scenarios in the context
of spatial energy planning.

1 Introduction
Availability of reliable data is one of the most important elements for fact-based
decisions. Urban planning and spatial energy planning often suffers from a lack
of availability of good, validated and up-to-date data sets. Furthermore, integrated
spatial and energy planning needs to incorporate new spatially distributed energy
sources and understand how these sources can be used in the future to meet climate
protection targets. These new energy sources can be, for example, waste heat from
industrial food production, local industrial/commercial enterprises, data centers, or
urban infrastructure such as tunnels and metro stations. The utilization of such waste
heat sources in heating networks has been demonstrated several times, however,
their proper identification in an urban environment can be challenging, especially
for smaller and unconventional sources [17].
Gamification as an innovative way to collect the needed data was investigated
within a national funded research project “HotCity”. Gamification builds on the use
of game mechanics in contexts that are, by nature, unrelated to the game [7]. Within
the project the “HotCity App” was developed enabling users to spatially report and
evaluate different sources of waste heat. The gamification of data collection was also
intended to raise awareness of waste heat and energy use on the one hand, and to
facilitate the collection of data from small energy sources on the other. For the first
time, the game framework is secured using a blockchain and mapped by means of a
token system. The HotCity App was tested in the Austrian cities Vienna and Graz as
a proof of concept to analyse if and how the gamification approach can deliver valid
results.
The HotCity App makes it possible to identify and georeference also smaller
sources of waste heat in order to use the available energy. Two test runs were each
conducted in Graz and Vienna, which provided helpful feedback from the testers
regarding promising features as well as showed barriers reducing the success of this
data collection approach.

The paperwill elaborate the game development, discuss the gamification approach
and the lessons learned during the proof of concept project.
2 Gamifying the Challenge
The energy system of the future will most likely consist of many different decen-
tralised units (e.g. rooftop PV systems, individual heat pumps, etc.). For the devel-
opment of districts with high energy efficiency and increased use of locally available
and sustainable energy sources, a detailed spatial identification of possible energy
potentials is necessary in order to plan cost-efficiently and future-proof. In particular,
waste heat from industry (foundries, food production …) and commerce (data cen-
tres, supermarkets …) as well as urban infrastructure (tunnels, metro stations) can
make an important contribution to heating and hot water in plus-energy neighbour-
hoods. While “low-hanging-fruits” such as waste heat from large industrial plants
are already used on a large scale, the identification of smaller sources is associated
with various difficulties [17]. Many larger cities already have a dataset, e.g. Open
Government Data, but it is usually not up-to-date enough, not (spatially) detailed
enough and often does not contain the necessary data. The often chosen top-down
methodology for determining waste heat potential, i.e. via a survey of the largest pol-
lutant emitters (e.g. [3]), does not cover smaller sources, which thus do not appear
in these databases.
Gamification, on the other hand, offers the possibility of generating targeted incen-
tive systems for data collection (crowdsourcing/crowdcollecting).Games like “Poke-
mon Go” have shown the unimagined dynamics that can be generated. As part of the
HotCity project funded by the Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment,
Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK), the HotCity App was devel-
oped that allows users to spatially record and evaluate new sources of waste heat.
The application for the collection of waste heat was chosen as an example for other
spatial energy data. The gamification of waste heat data collection was also intended
to raise general awareness of the issue and facilitate the collection of data from small
energy sources that are not normally considered in top-down approaches.
2.1 Gamification as a Method for Incentivizing the
Identification of Waste Heat Sources
The massive distribution and market penetration of digital games (approx. 37 billion
dollars in sales in 2020 in the USA alone as stated by [5]) is impressive. For example,
510 million people are currently actively playing games (5.3 million in Austria as
stated by [14]), with an average age of 35. Gamification is based on the use of
game mechanics in contexts that are, by nature, unrelated to games [7]. The aim
18 T. Wernbacher et al.
of gamification usually is to apply the motivational and feedback techniques that
have been tried and tested in games. Games provide clear goals ([10]; e.g. in the
form of quests), they reward ([19]; e.g. badges, level-ups), they allow to compete or
cooperate with others ([20]; e.g. in the form of rankings, multiplayer elements) and
they provide an interactive framework for different experiences and skills [11, 12].
Gamification has already been successfully used in various application areas to
promote participation, such as in the context of civic courage [6], citizen participation
[18], e-learning [2] and e-government [1]. The application of gamification has also
yielded positive results in the mobility sector, e.g. in terms of promoting sustainable
forms of mobility [13].
Pfeiffer et al. [15] coined a newdefinition ofGamification: “Gamification is the use
of game mechanics as a further dimension within and around both gaming and non-
gaming contexts, in an endeavour to nudge participants to perform certain actions,
by adopting a playful attitude”. This definition shows that gamification can also take
place within games, whenever further elements outside the core mechanics and the
core storyline are used to get the players to explore certain content. Furthermore, the
definition also shows the relation to the principle of nudging and that gamification
can be seen as one of the tools to trigger positive behaviour.
2.2 Blockchain as a Method for Securing the Gamification
Framework
Due to its decentralisation, transparency and security, the blockchain is dominating
technological and social discourse [4] and is being treated as a disruptive innovator
for awide range of applications: from transaction processing to land registry entries to
logistics chains, the intermediary is to be eliminated in the future [9]. Previous crypto
technologies such as Bitcoin and the first version of Ethereum rely on the “proof of
work” architecture. A small percentage of the cryptocurrency in the network is used
to reward “miners”, who keep the entire network alive and validate all transactions,
for solving randomly generated computing tasks. The computing power required
for this increases linearly with the difficulty of the computing tasks and consumes
more and more resources, which leads to grounded environmental concerns [8]. This
is where new blockchain technologies such as “Ardor” or “NXT” come into play.
These solutions are based on the “proof of stake” algorithm and are much more
energy-efficient. In this case, it is not about computing power in the form of graphics
card performance or CPU-power, but about holding a certain stake in the network-
maintenance token, as well as other aspects such as the total time of being active
online as a verification node and a certain degree of randomness. Regardless of the
particularities of architecture, the peer-to-peer principle, the strong encryption and
the permanent and validatable storage of information represent an opportunity for
diverse industries—including, of course, the gaming industry [16].
HotCity—A Gamified Token System for Reporting … 19
Ardor offers the possibility to generate utility tokens on the child chain Ignis.
Approval models can be set up around these created tokens and therefore the set of
rules can be specified. Furthermore, there is the possibility to develop smart contracts.
As a bonus, there is also a ready-made marketplace that can be used within the scope
of the decentralised applications (DApps) generated using the Ardor blockchain and
its child chain Ignis.
In HotCity, the blockchain was used to prevent cheating on the one hand and
to ensure transparency for the players on the other. It was used to automate the
management of redeemedprizes and rewards and to reduce the administrative effort to
a minimum. The concept involved incentives (such as coffee vouchers)—mapped on
a blockchain token—that could be redeemed at project partners. Double spending or
counterfeiting of vouchers can thus be avoided. In addition, the accounting settlement
can be automated. For example, similar to a current account system, the partners could
send the tokens to our billing account on a monthly basis, thus triggering the transfer
of Euro funds from the game operator to the prize provider.
3 The HotCity App
A platform-neutral app design was created for the HotCity App in order to appeal
to users from both worlds (iOS and Android). This platform-agnostic design also
offers the possibility of drawing users more strongly into the Hot City world, as the
branding elements from the style guide are implemented everywhere. For a quick
overview, explanatory screens were developed for rapid onboarding, which users are
shown at the start of the app and can also view again and again while using the app.
The app is based on learned UI patterns (e.g. menu navigation, call-to-actions, map
with markers), so that no specific knowledge or explanations are necessary to use
the app (Fig. 1).
The home screen of the app or main game area is the overview map. The map
is divided into rectangular districts that can be conquered by users and crews. From
there, the user has an overview of everything. The user sees the city from a bird’s eye
view, above it the districts and the heat sources. The heat sources have a status that
shows how much information can still be added by users. Users can add new heat
sources directly from the home screen via the “Upload photo” function. The photo
is first saved and then entered on the Basemap Austria via a map picker. In the next
step, the user is asked to add first details to the found heat source.
By earning more heat tokens, users can climb up the ranking in the app’s leader-
board and earn new badges. Besides, they can form crew and engage in cooperative
play. In this scenario, each user and each crew aims to occupy predefined squares
according to the plan in the app and thereby both increase their heat score and earn
new badges.

3.1 The Token Framework
The gamification framework consists of three utility tokens realised within the
blockchain Ardor and its child chain Ignis that represent points: bronze, silver and
gold tokens. Users receive bronze tokens for simple tasks such as uploading uncon-
firmed images and later receive points with higher value, when heat sources are
confirmed by other payers. These tokens can later be redeemed for incentives, with
better incentives distributed for gold tokens than for bronze tokens. As a further game
mechanic, tokens can be exchanged for each other, e.g. 10 silver tokens result in 1
golden token. Furthermore, all badges are displayed as tokens.
The actual transfer of the respective tokens in the formof assets takes place entirely
on the blockchain. A lightweight contract (cf. smart contract) was developed for this
purpose, which, in conjunction with the API, ensures that the assets are transferred
correctly. This contract is initially triggered by the backend and contains, for example,
information about which “heat spot” has triggered an asset transfer. The lightweight
contract then calls the API and checks whether the entries and information are valid
and correct and then transfers them. In a freely definable period of time, the API
checks whether the asset transfer was successful. If, for example, the transfer of the
assets fails due to technical circumstances or insufficient fee, a new process takes
place. The Ardor node primarily manages and executes the lightweight contracts for
the transfer of the application. As already mentioned, the API acts as a validation
unit for this contract and only transfers assets or badges if the correct information is
available.
In summary, blockchain technologies in the HotCity project secure those relevant
parts of the game where values for the players or project partners are affected. On the
one hand, tokens, badges and vouchers earned and, on the other hand, the accounting
modalities. All other data, such as the description of the heat sources, are saved
HotCity—A Gamified Token System for Reporting … 21
in a conventional database, which is of course designed in the best possible way
and continuously backed up. Transactions on the blockchain, as accessed from the
graphical interface of the main account full-node as well as a triggered badge.
4 The HotCity Field Test
The field test took place in two different phases during the winter 2020/2021. The
first phase was performed in November 2020, while the second phase was launched
mid of February 2021 for 3 weeks. For a part of the test persons, fees were awarded
for 5–8 h playing time. All participants received a briefing in advance in the form of
a tutorial on the app and in the form of marked districts that showed a high potential
in terms of waste heat sources. The responses were collected in anonymous form
with a request for open critical feedback. A total of 836 tokens were sent out for (a)
heat sources, divided into bronze, silver and gold and (b) badges (Fig. 2).
After a 2–3 week test phase, an online questionnaire was created and submitted
using the “Survey Monkey” software. The item collection contained both open and
closed questions with dichotomous and rating scaled gradations. A total of 31 people
took part in the test and filled out the online questionnaire. The majority of the test
persons (almost 68%) tested the app in Vienna, the rest (32%) in Graz.
4.1 The Game Rating and Winning Strategies
Satisfactory values could be reported with regard to the usability and acceptance
of the app. The usability is subjectively high (mean values from 2.03 to 2.62). The
simple user interface (M = 2.07) and the assessment of the comprehensibility for
other users (M = 2.03) are particularly noteworthy in this regard. The normalised
SUS (system usability scale) score is 79.675, which corresponds to an above average
value (maximum = 100, minimum = 0).
A comparison between the first and second test phase shows that incremental
improvements to the tutorial led to heat sources being found more easily (M = 2.2 in
the second test phase). Solely the input of the additional information should still be
improved. Game enjoyment was rated as high (M = 1.83 in the second test phase)
(Fig. 3).
Going for a walk was named as the most successful or popular game strategy
(27%) because of the positive health effects, followed by the targeted search for heat
sources in industrial districts (20%) and searching in advance on Google satellite
maps (16%) (Fig. 4).

4.2 Lessons Learned
The results of the field test show high values for the acceptance of the app. The fun
of play and the level of difficulty were also rated as appropriate. The standardised
SUS score is in the upper fifth, a high subjective usability is thus evident.
The core functionality of the app—the search for heat sources,whichwas designed
and integrated in accordance with the project goals—is seen as motivating by the
users; compared to other game features, the entertainment value is particularly high.
With regard to the qualitative aspects, the design of the app, the game idea and
the ease of use were praised by the test persons.
Problems were encountered with regard to GPS positioning, which sometimes
did not work immediately and had to be corrected manually (A technical problem
here is that automatic GPS positioning reduces the duration of one battery load, thus
a compromise has to be chosen, or using manual GPS positioning, which reduces
the usability). In addition, as the first phase of the field test in particular showed,
it was sometimes difficult for the users to find suitable heat sources, and chimneys
from private households were often photographed. Through clearer communication
and tutorials, this problem was alleviated in the second test phase.
Suggestions for improvement mainly refer to an improved tutorial (phase I) and
an automated location on the map and of the heat sources.

5 Conclusion and Outlook
Gamification can be a promisingway to identify urban energy data such aswaste heat.
The reward system could be secured in a transparent way using the energy-efficient
proof of stake blockchain Ardor. The HotCity-App has been successfully developed
and tested in two Austrian cities. The two test phases have shown that the app seems
to be very promising from a user point of view as the usability score shows. The
lessons learned from the two test phases demonstrate that a good briefing (tutorial
material) is important to gain useful results within the respective context. Compared
to the already existing waste heat data for Vienna and Graz new promising waste heat
proposals could be found, which have not been in the data sets so far and for some
existing data sets an increased accuracy of the GPS position could be established
thanks to the crowdsourcing approach. Interestingly even with the relatively low
amount of testers a significant number of valid waste heat proposals could be found.
However the tests also helped us to identify potential obstacles especially regarding
details attached to heat spot entries which can be used for estimating the amount of
waste heat for each waste heat proposal. The results indicate that these are hard to
collect with the current app, thus more advanced users (experts) or higher incentives
are needed to collect this information. The developed interactive evaluation tool
(web-application) seems to be a very good starting point for experts (not necessarily
players) in order to filter the most promising waste heat proposals and to estimate
their actual potential.
5.1 Recommendations Regarding Gamified Apps for Serious
Application Scenarios
Based on the feedback obtained during testing we suggest that similar approaches
take into account the following recommendations:
– Provide an optional tutorial video and a half-hour webinar to introduce and explain
the app. As user segmentation in the future could include regular users, experts as
well as community experts. Such a webinar is an efficient method for onboard-
ing and providing the necessary skills to assess heat sources according to their
potential.
– Simplify the registration process by publishing it in the app stores. The current
process requires several steps, which cause a time delay for users and thus make
“seamless onboarding” difficult. In addition, the release had to be done manually
due to restrictive settings on company devices. A release in the app store would
prevent such problems.
– Integration of a button to update one’s GPS position within the app. This func-
tion facilitates correct positioning, and a “double-select” interaction for uploading
photos should be introduced so that users can enter or readjust their GPS position
correctly.
HotCity—A Gamified Token System for Reporting … 25
– Switching the map view to a satellite view. This makes it easier to recognise heat
sources, and it is also possible to estimate the height of objects/heat sources using
Google Earth 3D, for example.
– Integration of notifications for finding heat sources and invitations to groups. This
also regularly encourages users to use the app, but a good balance must be struck
so as not to exert a disruptive influence.
– The token logic should be adapted so that the confirmation of heat sources is only
possible between different groups/crews. The “report” function for uploaded heat
sources should be reframed to create a positive connotation and thus encourage
use by users.
5.2 Recommendations Regarding the Use of Blockchain
Technology in Gamified Frameworks
With regard to the blockchain, we suggest that future or similar approaches fulfill
the following basic requirements:
– It must be a fully decentralised public blockchain.
– Users can, if they want, run a node of the blockchain on one of their devices, such
as a laptop or mobile phone.
– We can use approval models to ensure that various conditions aremet. One of these
conditions is that the tokens cannot be transferred to other unregistered wallets.
– Identity management can potentially be implemented. In our case, this would be
a possible connection of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
– Users do not need cryptocurrencies to pay network fees, we can take care of this
as an operator with bundling accounts.
– Individual transactions must be manageable in terms of costs, even if the crypto
market fluctuates massively.
– Messages attached to transactions must be encryptable.
– However, it must be possible to generate shared keys. To make the information
readable for authorised parties.
– It needs the possibility to programme lightweight smart contracts, in our case it is
the exchange of the different token classes as part of the game mechanics.
