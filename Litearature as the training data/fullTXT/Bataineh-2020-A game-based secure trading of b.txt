Abstract. The blockchain technology has recently proved to be an effi-
cient solution for guaranteeing the security of data transactions in data
trading scenarios. The benefits of the blockchain in this domain have been
shown to span over several crucial security and privacy aspects such as
verifying the identities of data providers, detecting and preventing mali-
cious data consumers, and regulating the trust relationships between
the data trading parties. However, the cost and economic aspects of
using this solution such as the pricing of mining process have not been
addressed yet. In fact, using the blockchain entails high operational costs
and puts both the data providers and miners in a continuous dilemma
between delivering high-quality security services and adding supplemen-
tary costs. In addition, the mining leader requires an efficient mecha-
nism to select the tasks from the mining pool and determine the needed
computational resources for each particular task in order to maximize
its payoff. Motivated by these two points, we propose in this paper a
novel game theoretical model based on the two-sided market approach
that exhibits a mix of cooperative and competitive strategies between
the (blockchain) miners and data providers. The game helps both the
data providers and miners determine the monetary reward and compu-
tational resources respectively. Simulations conducted on a real-world
dataset show promising potential of the proposed solution in terms of
achieving total surpluses for all involved parties, i.e., data providers,
data consumers and miners.

the privacy and security of data trading transactaions in critical domains such
as Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, mobile crowd-sensing, and machine
learning. Interestingly, recent statistics estimate that the data contained in the
blockchain ledger is expected to worth up to 20% of the global big data market
and to generate up to 100 billion in annual income to the data market that
already hit $203 billion dollar of revenue at the end of 2019 [6,9]. In the con-
text of data trading using blockchain, three players are to be considered: miners,
data providers and data consumers. Miners are responsible for supervising and
regulating the execution of what is known as smart contracts. A Smart contract
is a self-executing computer program that states and organizes the agreed terms
of a certain data transaction such as the desired quality of service clauses and
secure payment mechanism between the data providers and data consumers.
Processing smart contacts by miners entails high (mining) operational costs and
processing time, which might negatively affect the execution time of real-time
and delay-critical applications such as IoT and data analytics. In the literature,
there is lack of attention on the business model that would enable data trading
over blockchain where the main stream research in the general context of data
focuses on developing mechanisms of data resource management such as [14–
16]. Several challenging issues are yet to be addressed, in particular, assigning
optimal amount of computational units to the mining tasks, sustaining optimal
payoffs to involved players and serving data requests on time. In this work, our
objective is to provide a novel contribution to the data trading over blockchain
through proposing a game-theoretic-based business model that helps regulate
the secure data trading of IoT and big data analytics services. In particular, we
aim to address the following two substantial research challenges: 1) how should
the blockchain node distribute the computational resources of the mining pro-
cess among the data providers in such a way to maximize its payoff; and 2) how
should the data providers decide on the optimal monetary reward that needs to
be given to the miners versus their service in such a way to guarantee optimal
execution time of their transactions while avoiding over-payments.
1.1 Motivating Example
We provide in Fig. 1 a motivating example to better clarify the research gap
in the literature and highlight the need of our solution. As explained in the
figure, data consumers request to run real-time data analytics on an edge IoT
server. Following the blockchain technology, the request is deployed as a smart
contract which includes clauses that regulate the relationships between the data
consumers and the edge IoT server in terms of data quality, data size and pro-
cessing speed. The execution of the smart contract is supervised and executed
by the blockchain node, which manages the mining process and the mining com-
putational units. Smart contracts vary in their terms, and hence they differ in
their executions in terms of execution time and required resources. For instance,
in Fig. 1, the hospital server is exposed to more privacy threatens as it stores
patients data, which requires more computational units from the blockchain node
to authenticate only trusted consumers. This creates the need for a distributing
Trading of Big Data and IoT Services: Blockchain as a Two-Sided Market 87
mechanism that determines the optimal amount of resources for each smart con-
tract. However, the absence of such a mechanism might assign more resources
to less profitable contracts.

using the blockchain technology.
1.2 Related Work and Problem Statement
The state-of-the-art proposals focus on deploying verification approaches into
the blockchain technology in order to tackle the privacy and security issues such
as preserving the anonymity of the data providers, and preventing imperson-
ation attacks and colluding miners. For instance, the approaches proposed in
[18,22] leverage the blockchain technology to address the problem of user loca-
tion impersonation and re-identification attacks respectively in a crowd-sensing
context. The approaches proposed in [8,11] aim to increase the engagement of the
crowd system participants through capitalizing on the anonymous and reliable
interaction features provided by the blockchain technology.
88 A. S. Bataineh et al.
The proposals [10,13,19,20] propose game theoretical foundations in the con-
text of mobile blockchain supported by edge computing services. The interactions
between miners and edge computing nodes are modeled using Stackelberg games
and auctions to derive an optimal price for the proof-of-work for offloading allo-
cation tasks. The main limitation of such games is that they result in putting
the miners into an aggressive competition situation between each other from one
side, and with the edge computing services from the other side. This leads to
less efficient outcomes in terms of total surpluses for all these parties. In [21], the
authors propose to deploy blockchain for big data sharing in a collaborative edge
environment. Similar works have also been proposed in [12,23]. The aforemen-
tioned proposals, and the state-of-the-art in general suffer from several problems.
In fact, they 1) do not explain how the mining resources should be distributed
over the existing smart contracts and miners; 2) do not provide any mechanism
to derive the optimal payment that should be given by data providers to min-
ers); and/or 3) propose pricing schemes for the mining process based on pure
competitive games, which entails an aggressive competition among the involved
parties and results in lower payoffs for them.
1.3 Contribution
To address the aforementioned issues, we extend the work in [3,4] by proposing
a novel double two-sided game that models the interactions among the involved
parties (i.e., blockchain node, data providers and data consumers) using the two-
sided market theory [17]. In the proposed game, as shown in Fig. 2, both the data
providers and blockchain node act as a two-sided platform that gets on board
two market sides. Specifically, the blockchain node intermediates the interactions
between the data providers and data consumers, while the data providers inter-
mediate the interactions between the blockchain node and data consumers. As
shown in the figure, the data providers either 1) subsidize the blockchain node
by a higher portion of revenue to motivate it to supply more mining computa-
tional units, which results in attracting more data consumers and increasing the
revenue; or 2) subsidize the data consumers by more data computational units,
which increases the consumers’ demand and hence contributes in attracting the
blockchain node. Similar strategies are set up to the blockchain node as shown
in Fig. 2b. The proposed game combines both strategies as two separate games.
The solution of the games helps derive the equilibrium in terms of shared revenue
among the blockchain node and data providers and amount of mining resources
that each smart contract should be assigned with.

2.1 Model Description: A Double Two-Sided Game Formulation
Fig. 3. Double two-sided game
The proposed secure data trading model, depicted in Fig. 3, consists of three
entities: Data Service Consumers (SC), Big Data Service Providers (SP ) and
Blockchain node (BC) that consists of a network of miners. In our solution, a
certain big data service provider SPi receives a monetary value of Pi per a data
service consumer’s access to its services. The service provider SPi provides both
90 A. S. Bataineh et al.
the data and computing resources that are required to execute the data analytics
duties of the data consumers. The interactions between data providers and data
consumers include negotiating the data type, quality of provided services, pay-
ments, and all the associated terms of delivered data services. The blockchain
node BC is in charge of executing the transactions of smart contracts in order
to append a correct block into the blockchain. Executing smart contracts will
also ensure the sustainability of consumers’ access security, verification of the
identities of the data providers and consumers, protection of the privacy of data
providers and enforcement of quality control of data services. In our model, the
blockchain node seeks to distribute and allocate its computing resources for the
mining process among service providers in such a way to maximize its own payoff.
The Consumers’ demand on data service i provided by a service provider SPi
is denoted by Dci and the computing resources allocated by service i to run the
data analytics duties of its consumers is donated by DDi
. DDi
is measured in
terms of the throughput per second of executing the data requests. The relation-
ship between consumers’ demand Dci and supplying service i is modeled using
the two-sided market theory [17] as cross-group externalities φ and ψ. Here, ψ
represents the increase in the number of data consumers obtained when some
new computing and storage resources are added to DDi
. φ represents the amount
of profit that the data service provider earns when one more new consumer is
added to Dci . Similarly, the computing resources allocated by the blockchain
node to regulate the smart contracts of service i is denoted by Dsi
. The rela-
tionship between consumers’ demand and the supply of the blockchain node is
likewise modeled using the two-sided market theory as cross-group externalities
α and β. Here, α represents the increasing of data consumers obtained when
some new computing and storage resources are added to Dsi
and β represents
the amount of benefits that the blockchain node earns when one more new con-
sumers are added to Dci . The parameters α, β, φ, and ψ are dependant on the
service i. However, the variable i is omitted from the notations of these parame-
ters to simplify the equations when the service i is understood from the context.
Thus, instead of using αi for instance, α will be used. The same simplification
is applied for the other parameters that appear as exponents in our equations.
The interaction between SP and BC is modeled as a two-stage game, where
BC acts as the game leader and SP are the followers. In the first stage of the
game, each service provider SPi providing service i observes the amount of money
returns χi requested by BC in order to adjust the supply volume of computing
resources and the price to be charged to service consumers SCi consuming the
service i. In quest of the price specified by SPi, BC determines the optimal amount
of computing resources Dsi
that should be supplied to handle the smart contracts
between SPi and SCi. The model forms a closed loop of dependencies that involves
subsidizing techniques from the two-sided market theory. Thus, SPi may chose to
subsidize BC by an extra amount of payment that exceeds the contribution of BC.
The objective is to keep an optimal level of Dsi
that maximizes the return revenues
Pi ∗ Dci . Alternatively, BC may subsidize SPi with a low portion of the resulting
Trading of Big Data and IoT Services: Blockchain as a Two-Sided Market 91
revenue to keep an optimal level of Pi. The different parameters and symbols used
in our proposed solution are summarized in Table 1.
2.2 Players Demands and Utility Functions
The consumer’s demand and supply are modeled using the Cobb-Douglas func-
tion, which have the ability to represent the elasticity of the computing and
storage resources supply (Dsi
, DDi
) and its variations depending on the user’s
demand. These demand functions are defined as per Eqs. (1), (2), and (3). By
substituting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq. (1), we can express the consumer’s demand
as a function of χi and Pi as described in Eq. (4).

2.3 Game Equilibrium
The equilibrium of the above-described game is solved using a backward induc-
tion methodology. Specifically, the followers’ (data service providers) sub-game
is solved first to obtain their optimal response P ∗
i to the service consumers. The
leader’s (blockchain node) sub-game is then computed to obtain the optimal χ∗
i .
The game equilibrium is stated in Theorem 1.
Theorem 1. Under the assumption validated in [4] stating that the cross-group
externalities are not too week and not too strong, (0.1 < αβ < 0.8) and (0.1 <
φψ < 0.8), The equilibrium of our double two-sided game is given by the best
responses of the different players as follows:
1. The best response of the data service provider SPi is given by:
P ∗
i =
a1a3fs
(a1a3 − 1)(χ∗

if: 1 < (1/a1a3)
2. The best response of the Blockchain node with respect to a service i is given
by:
χ∗
i =
a2a3fc
(a2a3 + 1)P ∗

(8)
Proof. From Eq. (5) of the data service provider’s payoff, using log for both sides
of the equation, we obtain:
log πi = log(Pi(1 − χi) − fs) + log Dci (9)
Then, the optimal price P ∗
i is defined by ∂πi/∂Pi = 0 as follows:

∂Dci
∂Pi

i (11)
Trading of Big Data and IoT Services: Blockchain as a Two-Sided Market 93
By substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (10), we get:
Pi =
a1a3fs
(a1a3 − 1)(χi − 1)
(12)
Since Pi > 0, fs > 0, ((χi −1) < 1) then (a1a3/(a1a3 −1) < 0), so the condition.
By considering the acceptable range for γ analysed in [5], 0.2 < γ < 0.3 then
∂πi/∂Pi > 0 when Pi < (a1a3fs)/((a1a3 − 1)(χi − 1)) and ∂πi/∂Pi < 0 when
Pi > (a1a3fs)/((a1a3 − 1)(χi − 1)). Consequently, Pi is the best response.
For the second result of the theorem, we consider and take the log for both
sides of the equation of the blockchain node’s payoff (Eq. (6)) and obtain:
log π = log(Piχi − fc) + log Dci (13)
Then, the optimal χ∗
i is defined by ∂π/∂χi = 0 as follows:

By substituting Eq. (15) into Eq. (14), then:
χi =
a2a3fc
(a2a3 + 1)Pi
(16)
∂π/∂χi > 0 when χi < (a2a3fc)((a2a3 + 1)Pi) and ∂π/∂χi < 0 when χi >
(a2a3fc)((a2a3 + 1)Pi). Consequently, χi is the best response, so the theorem.
3 Simulation and Empirical Analysis
3.1 Simulation Setup
Our simulation analysis is grounded on statistical observations from big data
and IoT services from the AWS marketplace [2], BMR [1]—the annual statistical
report that publishes the revenues, payoffs and market growth of the the AWS
marketplace—and a real-world dataset from Google [7]. The price, Pi, of the
data service is chosen from the interval [0.2, 3.2] USD/hour, following the price
distribution of 150 data and IoT services from the AWS marketplace. According
to [1], Amazon Web services (AWS) received 30 billion USD in revenue with a
net income of approx. 12 billion. The gap between the gross and net revenues is
caused by the marginal operating costs which made up approx. 60% of revenue.
The operating costs represents in our model the costs associated with the smart
contracts fc and service requests initiated by data consumers fs. The Google
dataset [7] records statistics on the execution of big data requests executed on
94 A. S. Bataineh et al.
Google-powered virtual machines, which are similar to the instances of Amazon
cloud infrastructure (EC2). According to these statistics, each virtual machine
takes on average 1.42 to 10 s to complete a data processing request (with a mean
of 5.71 s and standard deviation of 4.29 s). The instances and their average com-
putational power are respectively represented in our model by Dsi
and the exter-
nality factor α. Adding a compute instance has a direct impact on the increase of
the consumers’ demand between 0.1 to 0.7 data request per second. By following
the mathematically proved result in [4] that the cross-group externalities should
not be neither too weak nor too strong, the cross-group externalities should be
bounded by 0.1 < αβ < 0.8. Hence, the externality factor β would range from
0.1/α to 0.8/α. We follow those estimations and set up the cross-group exter-
nalities φ and ψ in the same range of α and β. The price elasticity γ is set to
0.15, which is similar to the sensitivity of mobile/telecommunication services
price estimated in the literature [5]. The simulation takes the aforementioned
parameters as inputs, and then calculates the optimal shared revenue χi from
each service i according to Eq. (8) in Theorem 1. Moreover, the simulation inputs
meet the theoretical condition (1 < 1/a1a3) in Theorem 1. Thus, by substituting
the real ranges of the simulation parameters, the mathematical term represent-
ing the strength of total externalities (a3) is greater than zero (i.e αβ +φψ < 1).
Hence, we demonstrate our three dimensional results in three sets of criteria: 1)
week externalities (0.1 < αβ < 0.4, 0.1 < φψ < 0.4); 2) strong externalities of
αβ - weak externalities of φψ (0.4 < αβ < 0.7, 0.1 < φψ < 0.2); and 3) strong
externalities of φψ - weak externalities of αβ (0.1 < αβ < 0.2, 0.4 < φψ < 0.7).
3.2 Shared Revenues and Computational Costs over Externalities

externalities
Fig. 5. Shared revenue over strong
externalities αβ
Trading of Big Data and IoT Services: Blockchain as a Two-Sided Market 95
Fig. 6. Shared revenue over strong externalities φψ
In this section, we study the impact of the cross group externalitie metrics (αβ)
and (φψ) on the shared revenue χi among data providers and blockchain node.
In Fig. 4, we study the percentage of shared revenue received by the blockchain
node for a weak level of externalities between, on one side the data providers
and blockchain node, and on the other side the data consumers. In Figs. 5 and 6,
we study the shared revenue for a stronger level of externalities αβ and φψ
respectively. As shown in these figures, the blockchain node receives a higher
percentage of revenue as the externality factors αβ and φψ become stronger.
Another important observation is that the average of shared revenues increases
at a higher pace over the blockchain node externalities with data consumers (αβ)
than that over data provider and data consumers (φψ). This behavior is clearly
observed in Fig. 5 which shows that the shared revenue reaches 60% over strong
externalities of αβ versus a maximum of 40% over strong externalities of φψ
as shown in Fig. 6. This behavior is interpreted as follows. The demand of data
consumers is positively impacted when its externalities with the blockchain node
(αβ) become stronger. Consequently, the data providers entice the blockchain
node by a higher portion χi of revenues to supply more computational units
with the aim of increasing the consumers’ demand and hence the total revenue.
Nonetheless, the blockchain node faces higher operating costs by increasing its
supply of mining computational units. Consequently, it would ask for a higher
portion of revenue. Moreover, the consumers’ demand is positively impacted as
its externalities with data provider become stronger. Thus, the data providers
would face higher operating costs when they add more computational units in
an attempt to increase the consumers’ demand. This forces the blockchain node
to subsidize data providers with a lower portion χi of revenue to sustain a higher
level Dci of consumers’ demand. In general, increasing the consumers’ demand
adds more computational cost on the blockchain node, which leads to increasing
the portion of blockchain node as the externalities among the data provider
and data consumers become stronger. This explains the slower increase pace of
shared revenues over the externalities φψ compared to the externalities αβ.
96 A. S. Bataineh et al.
3.3 Data Consumers’ Demand and Computational Unit Supply
In this section, we study the impact of cross-group externalities among all the
involved parties (i.e., data providers, blockchain node, and data consumers) on
the data consumers’ demand. As shown on Figs. 7, 8 and 9, the consumers’
demand is higher under a weak level of externalities than the strong level. Those
observed results are interpreted as follows. A higher externality level among the
market players incurs a higher cost for the two-sided market platform to get
the market players on board. Specifically, under a strong level of externalities
among the blockchain node and data consumers αβ, data providers either (1)
subsidize the blockchain node with a higher portion of revenue to attract more
data consumers (as discussed in Sect. 3.2); or (2) subsidize the data consumers
by supplying higher amounts of data computational units, which in turns, leads
to incentivizing the blockchain node. However, data providers cannot ultimately
subsidize data consumers due to their mutual cross-group externalities (φψ).
To study this phenomenon, we show in Figs. 10 and 11 the amount of data
computational units supplied by data providers as well as the number of data
consumers attracted over the externalities φψ respectively. As shown in Fig. 10,
the amount of supplied computational units increases under weak externali-
ties (φψ ∈ [0.1 − 0.4]) and gradually decreases as the cross-group externalities
become stronger (i.e., φψ ∈ [0.4 − 0.8]). However, as shown in Fig. 11, the num-
ber of attracted data consumers exponentially decreases over the whole range
of externalities. This implies that the subsidizing technique becomes costly as
the externalities become stronger. For instance, data providers attract 2 × 105
data consumers by providing 20 data computational units at an externality level
of 0.2, while they attract a number of data consumers that is 0.1 × 105 less
by providing the same amount of data computational units but with a higher
externality level of 0.5. In both cases (i.e., subsidizing data consumers and data
providers), the data providers would undergo higher costs. Similarly, under a
strong level of externalities between data providers and data consumers, the
blockchain node subsidizes either the data providers (by asking lower portion of
revenues) or the data consumers (by supplying a higher amount of computational
units), which entails higher costs for both cases. Similarly, the blockchain node
cannot ultimately subsidize the data consumers due to their mutual cross-group
externalities represented by αβ. Similar observations are depicted in Fig. 12 in
terms of mining computational units over αβ.
3.4 Data Providers and Blockchain Payoffs
In this section, we investigate the impact of externalities on the payoff of the
data providers and blockchain node. Figure 13 shows the payoff of data providers
under weak externalities, while Figs. 14 and 15 depict providers’ payoff under
strong externalities αβ and φψ respectively. As illustrated in these figures, the
data providers’ payoff gradually decreases as the externalities increase. The rea-
son behind this increasing is that the overall demand of consumers decreases
while computational costs and asked shared revenue increase over externalities

4 Conclusion
In this work, we proposed a new game-based business model for data trading
over blockchain. The problem is formulated as a double two-sided game that
Trading of Big Data and IoT Services: Blockchain as a Two-Sided Market 99
solved the problem of maximizing the players’ payoff by optimally distributing
the mining computational powers over smart contracts. Technically, the game
considered the smart contract characteristics as well as the impact of the mining
computational units on the data service and consumers’ demand. The theoretical
and simulation results proved the efficiency of the proposed game.
