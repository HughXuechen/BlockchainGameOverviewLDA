Abstract—Despite the touting value of blockchain technology
(BT), many agri-food supply chains are still struggling to the
adoption of it. In this article, incorporating the benefit and cost
associated with BT, we seek to answer whether and under what
conditions can two competing agri-food supply chains benefit from
the adoption of BT, and how government choose optimal subsidy
scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The findings suggest that
the Nash equilibrium outcome toward BT adoption strategy will be
greatly affected by key parameters, such as competitive intensity,
the growth rate of the market size and the investment cost with the
adoption of BT, and the planting cost of the agri-food. Specifically,
early adopter can always snatch more benefit from the adoption
of the BT than the follower, and the gap between them will be
increased in the competition intensity. In addition, the decisions
selected by agri-food supply chains does not always benefit the
consumer surplus and the social welfare, which call for further
government subsidy scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The
findings provide important implications for both the industrial
managers and policy makers on how to benefit from BT in the
digital transformation era.

I. INTRODUCTION
AGRI-FOOD industry plays a very important role in the
global economy, providing food and nutrition for the
people. In recent years, however, scandals and safety incidents
on agri-food are not infrequent to witness [1], [2]. As estimated

by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, 10% of food sold
worldwide is adulterated [3]. In such situations involving risks,
uncertainty, and information asymmetry, consumers are increas-
ingly concerned with the quality and safety of the agri-food
they eat, and fear being cheated when buying the agri-food.
As a result, trust is particularly imperative for the agri-food
market and can positively influence and facilitate consumers’
purchasing behavior [4].
As a disruptive technology, blockchain is being popularized in
several countries with strong R&D capabilities [5]. It is viewed
as a “trust machine” that can enable the traceable integrity of
supply chains and decrease the chance of fraud in a decentral-
ized manner [6], [7], [8], [9]. Different from the conventional
technologies that storing and exchanging the original data in
off-chain, blockchain technology (BT) adopts the mechanism of
cryptographic signatures and decentralized consensus, so it can
guarantee information integrity and reliability (Kumar et al. [11]
2018). In addition, because information recorded in a blockchain
is distributed among network members and linked to each other,
every member has permissions to obtain a more transparent
trace of information [12], [13]. Through BT, all participants
of the agri-food supply chain can acquire detailed information
about the food to verify how it is produced, processed, and
delivered, thereby reducing their perceived risks [14]. Compared
with other traceability technologies, such as radio frequency
identification (RFID) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
which store data centrally and are easy to tamper with, BT
can help consumers access to product information and evalu-
ate product quality more simply and, thus, have more trust in
blockchain applications [15], [16]. Currently, many well-known
organizations have adopted BT to track their product safety, so as
to enhance consumer trust toward agri-food and facilitate their
purchasing. For example, Walmart, JD.com, IBM, and Tsinghua
University jointly announced the establishment of China’s first
blockchain traceability alliance and have conducted trials in the
pork supply chain [17].
In recent years, many researchers have discussed the value and
application of BT in the context of food traceability [14], [18],
[19]. Despite widely touting the value of BT (VBT), in practices,
however, many agri-food supply chains are still struggling to
adopt this disruptive technology. From a positive view, BT
provides consumers a more time-saving and cost-effective way
to ascertain the authenticity and integrity of a product [20], it
can enhance consumers trust and allow consumers who have

no particular confidence in the agri-food to make purchase
decisions. Therefore, the adoption of BT can help the supply
chain to charge a higher price and enjoy a larger market share
over its competitors that fail to do so. From a negative view,
however, the adoption of BT requires substantial investment and
coordination among supply chain partners [21]. Therefore, a key
problem arises for agri-food supply chains in terms of whether
and under what conditions should they adopt this disruptive
technology is to consider whether the value brought by BT
is sufficiently large to compensate for the increased costs of
adopt it.
The firm’s BT adoption decision has also attracted re-
searchers’ attention in recent years. However, the existing stud-
ies explore this problem either in monopoly or duopoly settings
[20], [22], [23] while neglect the equilibrium strategies for two
competing supply chains. Actually, when taking the competitor’s
interplay response into consideration, it is of particular interest
to investigate what is the equilibrium adoption strategy for two
competitive supply chains in the duopoly environment. Whether
and when should they choose to be the early adopter, or the fol-
lower, or the nonadopter when taking the competitor’s response
into consideration? Why? How the competitive intensity, the
growth rate of the market size and the investment cost with
the adoption of BT, as well as the planting cost affect the
equilibrium strategy? Can the equilibrium outcome selecting
by profit-maximizing supply chains always benefit consumer
surplus and social welfare? If not, how can the government
intervention help?
To address these research questions, we construct two compet-
ing agri-food supply chains, each consisting a food company and
a farm, and use game theory to analyze the interactions among
the participants in the supply chain. We take the competitive
intensity, the positive side (helps to increase the market size)
and negative side (needs additional investment cost) of the
adoption of BT, as well as the planting cost of the agri-food into
consideration. We first analyze the two supply chains’ decision
making behavior and profits under four alternative scenarios
regarding whether or not to adopt BT: Scenario (N, N), Scenario
(U, N), Scenario (N, U), and Scenario (U, U), then compare
the respective profits in these four scenarios and get the Nash
equilibrium outcome under different conditions. Moreover, we
further take the government subsidy into consideration and
analyze the choice of the government’s optimal subsidy scheme
to maximize the social welfare. The findings provide theoretical
support and managerial implications for the decision-making
of supply chains in terms of whether or not to adopt BT under
different conditions and get successfully paid off in a duopoly
competitive market. The findings also offer guidance to policy
makers on designing suitable subsidy scheme to facilitate the
development of BT and leverage BT to enhance value creation
and social welfare in the digital transformation era.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the literature. Section III provides the two compet-
ing supply chains’ BT adoption strategy matrix, the demand
and supply chains’ profit. Section IV performs the supply
chains’ decisions and profits under four scenarios, respectively.
Section V analyzes the equilibrium outcome of two competing
supply chains under different conditions. Section VI considers
the government intervention scheme from the perspective of
maximizing social welfare. Finally, Section VII concludes this
article. All proofs are provided in the online Appendix.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
This study is largely inspired by previous studies on the
agricultural supply chain and the application of BT in product
traceability
A. Studies on Agricultural Supply Chain
The research of single agricultural supply chain is relatively
mature. For the fresh product supply chain area, Shukla and
Jharkharia [24] forecasted the demand of fresh produce by the
application of autoregressive integrated moving average model,
which can realize an acceptable limit for the fresh product
market. Furthermore, Shukla and Jharkharia [25] presented a
literature review of the fresh produce supply chain management,
which revealed the mainstream and neglected research topics in
the fresh produce supply chain management area. Yang and Tang
[26] compared the three sales models (retail mode, dual-channel
mode, and online-to-offline mode) of fresh products, and studied
the influence of sales modes on the profits of suppliers, distribu-
tors, and consumers. Dolat-Abadi [27] concentrated on the prob-
lem of how to choose a daily or bourse market for the economy
and decentralized or coordinated strategy to control the waste of
the product. The cooperation within agricultural supply chain
members is usually difficult to promote because of different
objects, so the study of coordination mechanism is meaningful.
For the area of agricultural supply chain coordination, Anderson
and Monjardino [28] designed a new type of contract structure,
which can coordinate the supply chain and demonstrate the
potential advantages when producers are risk-averse. Cao et al.
[29] designed a cost-sharing contract and a buyback contract to
coordinate the greening effort decisions and further investigated
the impact of the green standards at different stages of the supply
chain. Due to the impact of climate change, the production
of agricultural products has strong uncertainty. Many scholars
have carried out research on agricultural supply chain under
the background of uncertain yield. Kazaz [30] proposed early
pricing model and delayed pricing model to study the sales
price and production decision-making of agricultural products
under supply uncertainty. Furthermore, Kazaz and Webster [31]
discussed the optimization decision-making of the agricultural
supply chain based on yield effort under the environment of
random yield. Zhao and Wu [32] coordinated the agricultural
food chain under random output and demand through revenue
sharing contracts. Ahumada et al. [33] present a stochastic tacti-
cal planning model, which can be used for the effective tactical
planning of fresh produce under uncertainty and the application
of stochastic tactical planning can result in reduced levels of
risk. Zhang and Swaminathan [34] realized that the planting of
agricultural products also has strong seasonality, and it is difficult
for farmers to change their production plan according to market
demand. Chen and Chen [35] studied the production of high-
value agricultural products by multiple farmers with uncertain
output. The study found that if the production cost of high-value
agricultural products is low, farmers with low output rate of

agricultural products will choose to order contract agriculture,
which can effectively improve the income of farmers and reduce
the income difference between farmers. There are relatively little
research works related to the game between agricultural supply
chains. Yu and Nagurney [36] studied oligopolistic competi-
tion with product differentiation, and they assessed alternative
technologies involved in each supply chain activity based on it.
Besik and Nagurney [37] studied the framework of game theory
in both uncapacitated and capacitated versions through the case
of apples in Massachusetts.
On the other hand, agriculture concerns the health and safety
of the whole nation and is of great strategic significance for
the whole country. Therefore, the government needs to provide
relevant policies to support it. Government subsidy is a common
way to protect agriculture. Recently, Kazaz [38] investigated
various intervention measures to stabilize the price fluctuation
of artemisinin and compared their performance. Focusing on
agricultural innovation, Akkaya et al. [39] examined the effect of
using taxes and subsidies to promote agricultural innovation. To
protect farmers’ incomes, Alizamir et al. [40] studied two types
of government subsidy, price protection, and income protection.
They also analyzed which policies can achieve better results. Hsu
et al. [41] found that government subsidies for farmers based on
product quality sometimes actually lower the quality of dairy
products. Ye et al. [42] analyzed Farmer Subsidy Program and
Producer Subsidy Program found that the optimal government
subsidy program depends on the government’s budget and land
capacity.
In this vein, we consider the Cournot competition model
between two argi-food supply chains with uncertain supply.
Based on it, our article also includes the discussion that how
to formulate government subsidy scheme.
B. Studies on the Application of BT in Product Traceability
Recommendations
Traceability has become a prerequisite for a successful agri-
food supply chains [43]. ISO 9000 [44] defined traceability
as “the ability to trace the history, application, or location of
that which is under consideration.” The European Union [45]
narrows the definition of traceability in the food industry to be
“the ability to trace and follow a food, feed, food-producing
animal, or substance intended to be, or expected to be incor-
porated into a food or feed, through all stages of production,
processing, and distribution.” Based on these definitions, Kele-
pouris et al. [43] studied the main requirements according to the
definition of traceability. Aung and Chang [46] elaborated on
the development of traceability, the importance of food quality,
and the challenges to traceability to ensure food quality. Roy
[47] established a contrast between supply chain traceability
and supply chain visibility.
However, in a conventional technology-based traceability
system (RFID for example), the traceability information is es-
tablished and governed by the argi-food supply chains or a third
party (such as government) in a centralized manner. That is,
the traceability information is governed by the argi-food supply
chains or a third party themselves, and consumers have to rely
on their trust in them. The BT, by design, uses cryptographic
signatures to create a decentralized consensus. All participants
in the argi-food supply chain, including consumers, can acquire
end-to-end trustworthy traceability information about the food
through a distributed ledge [3], [14]. Thus, the BT has the
capacity to allow consumers to side-step the need for trust in
either the argi-food supply chains or a third party.
With the development of BT, scholars are gradually exploring
the application of BT, especially in the area of product traceabil-
ity. Most of them is the theoretical analysis or the case study on
the VBT. For example, Zhao et al. [19] systematically analyzed
the main applications and challenges of BT in the agri-food value
chain. Kshetri [48] analyzed typical cases of BT application in
food safety, such as Walmart in the United States began to use
BT to monitor Chinese pork products and imported agricultural
products in 2016. Salah et al. [49] proposed a blockchain-
enabled soybean supply chain solution to effectively execute
soybean business transactions and track and trace the entire
soybean supply chain. Kumar et al. [11] discussed the challenges
and opportunities of supply chain management applying BT
from technology perspective. Behnke and Janssen [50] analyzed
the boundary conditions of food supply chain traceability using
BT, and concluded that successful implementation of BT in the
supply chain first requires measures to meet these boundary
conditions. Casino et al. [51] developed and tested a distributed
trustless and secure architecture for food supply chain trace-
ability. Some studied used mathematical models to analyze the
feasibility of BT. Cui et al. [22] studied how the supply chain
traceability enabled by BT can affect suppliers’ quality decisions
and supply chain contracts. Choi [20] compared the BT selling
platform model with the traditional selling model to get the
optimal model under different conditions. Choi and Luo [52]
proposed that BT can help solve the problem of data quality in
emerging markets based on the reliability and traceability of BT
data. They discussed the impact of BT on sustainable fashion
supply chain operations and social welfare. Based on the reality
that the cross-border e-commerce platforms applied BT to offer
quality verification and improve consumers’ trust in products.
Guo et al. [53] considered the information asymmetry between
manufacturers and retailers on the use of environment friendly
materials. Niu et al. [54] discussed the application choice of BT
in the transnational supply chain. Wu et al. [23] focused on the
problem that which fresh product supply chain members should
lead the construction of the blockchain-based traceability system
and how to allocate BT costs to achieve Pareto optimality.
Following these studies, we also assume that BT can enhance
consumer confidence in agri-food quality and promote the sale
of agri-foods. Differently, we study the two competing agri-food
supply chains’ Nash equilibrium of the BT adoption strategies
when taking both the value and cost of BT into consideration.
We also consider how the government subsidy scheme helps to
promote the adoption of BT and improve social welfare.
C. Uniqueness and Contributions of This Study
Our study is distinguished from previous studies in three ways.
First, most of the BT adoption in supply chains studies only show

COMPARISON BETWEEN PREVIOUS RELATED STUDIES AND THIS STUDY
from the technical level that BT can provide accurate traceabil-
ity services for agricultural products and ensure the safety of
them from a purely conceptual or descriptive perspective while
ignoring the fact that supply chains do not necessarily adopt BT
on an economic level [18], [55]. In this study, we incorporate
both the value and cost for the adoption of BT, analyze the BT
adoption strategies for two competing agri-food supply chains
and the corresponding application conditions (competition in-
tensity, output uncertainty, planting cost, the promotion effect
and cost of BT, etc.). Second, the previous studies neglected the
equilibrium strategies for two competing supply chains by taking
the competitor’s interplay response into consideration. When
facing an emerging disruptive technology, firms’ decisions on
to be the early adopter, or the follower, or the nonadopter
of BT will significantly depend on the competitor’s reaction.
Therefore, our study uses Nash game to analyze the equilibrium
BT adoption strategy between two competing supply chains,
instead of a single supply chain’s adoption strategy. Third, we
take into account the government’s subsidy scheme for BT
adoption. Since the development of BT is still in its infancy,
as a macrocontroller, the government plays a critical role on
promoting the development of BT. From the perspective of
social welfare, this article explores whether and when a subsidy
should be provided to supply chains, thus provides guidance for
policy makers to design suitable subsidy schemes to facilitate
the adoption of BT. Table I summarizes the comparison between
previous studies and this study.
III. MODEL
Considering two agri-food supply chains sell substitutable
agri-foods to compete for consumers. Each supply chain is con-
sisting of one food company and one farm. The game between the
supply chains is the Nash game, whereas within a supply chain
is the Stackelberg game. That is, in each supply chain, before the
growing season, food company 1 (resp. food company 2) signs
a contract with farm 1 (resp. farm 2) to promise to purchase all
agri-foods yielded by farm 1 (resp. farm 2) at a wholesale price
Fig. 1. Sequence of events for the two competing agri-food supply chains.
w1(resp. w2) in the harvest season. Then, farm 1 (resp. farm
2) decides the planting area q1 (resp. q2) at planting cost cq21
(resp. cq22) (including the resource costs and efforts needed to
do the planting). The quadratic planting cost function captures
the increasing marginal cost for planting and diseconomies of
scale, which has been widely adopted in agriculture literature
[40], [41]. The actual yielded agri-foods are random, due to
the impact of weather conditions (e.g., drought, floods, pests,
etc.). We assume that the yield ε(ε ∈ (A,B)) is random with a
continuous probability density function f(ε) and a cumulative
distribution functionF (ε). In addition, we assume the two farms
produce in the same area and face similar weather conditions,
thus, they have the same yield uncertainty and planting cost
coefficient.
Therefore, for farm 1 (resp. farm 2), the realized yielded
agri-foods is q1ε (resp. q2ε) [42], where Eε = μ, Dε = σ2,
and define δ2 = E ε2 = μ2 + σ2. Food company 1 and food
company 2 sell the agri-foods to the market at a retail price p1 =
a− q1ε− bq2ε and p2 = a− q2ε− bq1ε, respectively, where a
denotes the market potential, b ∈ (0, 1)denotes the substitutabil-
ity between the two products. That is, bmeasures the intensity of
market competition, a larger bmeans a more intense competition
between two products.
With the adoption of BT, consumers can acquire end-to-end
trustworthy traceability information about the agri-food to verify
how it is produced, processed, and delivered to the consumer,
through a distributed ledger [3], [14]. This will significantly de-
crease the chance of fraud and enhance consumers’ confidence in
the products. Thus, we assume that with the adoption of BT, the
market potential will increase from a to a(1 + λ), where λ(> 0)
represents the growth rate of the market size with the adoption of
BT. However, the adoption of BT requires an investment costK,
such as the R&D cost of blockchain, the purchase of machinery,
the salaries of technicians, etc.
We assume each of the two agri-food supply chains either
adopts BT (denoted U) or does not adopt BT (denoted N),
resulting in four alternative scenarios in the market: Scenario
(N, N), Scenario (U, N), Scenario (N, U), and Scenario (U,
U), as shown in Fig. 1 and Table II. In each scenario, the two

EXPECTED PROFITS IN THE FOUR ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
supply chains engage in Cournot (quantity) competition, and
determine the production quantities and wholesale prices. By
comparing the respective profits, the two supply chains decide
the scenario that is best for them. In this study, we first consider
the government will not provide any intervention, then, taking
the real practice that governments may provide subsidies to
supply chains to promote the adoption of BT to ensure the
end-to-end trustworthy traceability information into considera-
tion, we further analyze the choice of the government’s optimal
subsidy scheme to maximize the social welfare.
Throughout this article, subscripts f1 (resp. f2), c1 (resp. c2),
and sc1 (resp. sc2) denote a variable pertaining to the farm 1
(resp. farm 2), food company 1 (resp. food company 2), and
supply chain 1 (resp. supply chain 2). Superscripts NN, UN,
NU, and UU denote a variable pertaining to Scenarios (N, N), (U,
N), (N, U), and (U, U), respectively. For example, qNN
1 , wNN
1 ,
πNN
f1 , and πNN
c1 denote the production quantity of farm 1, the
wholesale price of food company 1, the farm 1’s profit, and the
food company 1’s profit in Scenario (N, N), respectively. Table II
shows the expected profits in the four alternative scenarios.
IV. MODEL ANALYSIS
In this section, we solve the production quantity and pricing
decisions of the two supply chains in the four scenarios and the
corresponding profits of each party.
A. Scenario (N, N)
In Scenario (N, N), both supply chains do not adopt the
BT. The expected profits of farm 1 and food company 1 are,
respectively

. (2)
Farm 2 and food company 2’s expected profits are the same as
farm 1 and food company 1. Using backward induction to solve
this game, the optimal wholesale prices, production quantities,
and expected profits in Scenario (N, N) are given in Table III
From Table III we have, if the mean of the random yield (μ) is
lower than a threshold value (i.e., 0 < μ ≤
√
4c
2+b + σ2), both
farms’ production scales and profits will the increase in μ. How-
ever, ifμ is higher than a threshold value (i.e.,μ >
√
4c
2+b + σ2),
the increasing μ will conversely lead to a decrease in the farms’
TABLE III
OPTIMAL DECISIONS AND PROFITS IN SCENARIO (N, N)
production scales and hurt their profits as well. This is because
that a higher μ can generate more output with the same input,
thus, to avoid the lower market price due to the oversupply, a
higherμ can also cause each farm to produce less in equilibrium.
While the companies will always get higher profits through
setting lower wholesale prices with the increasing of μ. On the
other side, a higher yield uncertainty (σ2) always leads to a lower
production quantity, wholesale price, as well as the profit of each
party in the supply chain.
Intuitively, with the increase in the planting cost coefficient
(c), the farms tend to reduce their production scales and the
companies need to set higher wholesale prices to encourage
the farms to plant more. Thus, the companies’ profits will be
decreased. While the farms’ profits are not necessarily increas-
ing or decreasing in c. If c is low (i.e., 0 < c ≤ (2+b)δ2
4 ), the
positive impact of the higher wholesale prices due to increasing
c dominates, resulting in the farms’ higher profits. However, if c
is higher than a threshold (i.e., c > (2+b)δ2
4 ), the negative impact
of fewer production quantities due to increasing c dominates,
leading to the farms’ decreasing profit.
B. Scenario (U, U)
In Scenario (U, U), both the two supply chains adopt the BT,
then the market potential for agricultural products will increase
from a to a(1 + λ). Moreover, to facilitate the adoption of BT
in the supply chain, each party of the supply chain should share
part of the investment costK. For example, China’s e-commerce
giant JD.com is building a traceability system with its 30-plus
brand owners on its open blockchain platform [56]. JD Farm,
established in April 2018, cooperated with 17 farms and suc-
cessfully created a series of agricultural product brands, such
as “Hulunbeir mustard oil” and “Mengqing millet.” Since the
adoption of BT requires the participation of multiple parties, the
investment cost of BT is shared by JD.com and the farms. JD is
responsible for the research and development of BT and IoT, and
the farm needs to set up operation institutions related to these
businesses and full-time staff to purchase relevant machines for
data collection and control. We assume the ratio of the BT
investment cost K borne by the farm is ϕ, whereas the ratio
borne by the food company is 1− ϕ. Therefore, the expected
profits of farm 1 and food company 1 are

Again, farm 2 and food company 2’s expected profits are the
same as farm 1 and food company 1. Using backward induction
to solve this game, the optimal wholesale prices, production
quantities, and expected profits in Scenario (U, U) are given in
Table IV.
When both the two supply chains adopt BT, the market po-
tential will be expanded, resulting in increases in the wholesale
prices, production quantities, as well as the gross profits of each
party in the supply chains. The impacts of the major parameters
(i.e., the random yield and the planting cost coefficient) on the
optimal decisions and profits are the same as those in Scenario
(N, N).
C. Scenario (U, N) and Scenario (N, U)
In Scenario (U, N) and Scenario (N, U), only one supply
chain adopts BT, whereas the other does not. Since the two
supply chains are symmetric, the analysis for Scenario (U, N)
is identical to that of Scenario (N, U), thus, we only analyze
Scenario (U, N) here.
In Scenario (U, N), food company 1’s market potential is
a(1 + λ), whereas food company 2’s market potential remains
a. Their expected profits are

We note that when λ ≥ 2g1
bδ2 − 1, qUN
2 ≤ 0. That is, if the
growth rate of the market size with the adoption of BT is
mighty to a certain extent, the market size of the supply chain
adopting BT will grow significantly and force the other supply
chain did not adopt BT to quit the market, resulting in the
monopoly setting, which is quite different from the duopoly
setting in our study. Therefore, in the following discussions, we
limit λ to satisfy 0 < λ < 2g1
δ2 − 1, so as to ensure the duopoly
setting in the market for any given degree of competition (i.e.,
b ∈ (0, 1)). For convenience, we let λm = 2g1
δ2 − 1. When the
growth rate of the market size with the adoption of BT is large
(i.e., (4c+δ2)

< λ < λm) and the competitive intensity is strong
(i.e.,
2(1+λ−

δ2 < b < 1), the supply chain adopting BT
can obtain more market demand and higher profit with the
increase of b.
Similarly, we can get the optimal decisions and profits in
Scenario (N, U) in Table VI.
V. EQUILIBRIUM OF THE BT ADOPTION STRATEGY
A. Value of BT
To gain an in-depth comprehensive understanding of the
value and cost of adopting BT, as well as the equilibrium of
the BT adoption strategy, we define the VBT as the revenue
brought by the adoption of BT. For convenience, when analyzing
VBT, we ignore the investment cost K of the adoption of BT
first, which do not affect the following results. Specifically,
to explore the value difference between the early adopter and
follower for the adoption of BT, we further define two indi-
cators: The VBT for the Leader (V BTL
sc) and the VBT for the
Follower (V BTF
sc). V BTL
sc refers to the difference in expected
profit (ignoring K) of one supply chain with the adoption
of BT, whereas the other does not adopt. That is, V BTL
sc =
(πUN∗
sc +K)− πNN∗
sc = 4a2λμ2g1(g1+c)((2+λ)g1−bδ2)
g2
2
. V BTF
sc
refers to the difference in expected profit (ignoring K)
of one supply chain with the adoption of BT when the
other has adopted BT. That is, V BTF
sc = (πUU∗
sc +K)−
πNU∗
sc = 4a2λμ2g1(g1+c)((2+λ)g1−b(1+λ)δ2)
g2

. Figs. 2 and 3 re-
veal the relationships between V BTL
sc, V BTF
sc, and b,
c, λ.
As shown in Fig. 2, when c is large (i.e., c > δ2
4 ), if b is low,
the increase in b will increase the competition internal friction
between the two products, resulting in the reduce of V BTL
sc.
However, if b is high to a certain degree, the early adopter of BT
can differentiate its product from its competitor, then, combining
a larger λ (i.e., λ1 < λ < λm), the early adopter can build an
overwhelming advantage over its competitor and get a larger
V BTL
sc [as shown in Fig. 2(b)], whereas the leading advantage
will be decreased with a smaller λ (i.e.,0 < λ ≤ λ1) [as shown
in Fig. 2(a)]. But when c is small (i.e., 0 < c ≤ δ2
4 ), only a small
increase in λ can help to form a large competitive advantage,
thus, V BTL
sc will first decrease then increase in b [as shown in
Fig. 2(c)].
For the follower, the adoption of BT will further strengthen
the competitive environment. Therefore, the increase of b will
reduce V BTF
sc significantly, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b).
However, when c is low (i.e., 0 < c < δ2
4 ) and λ is small
(i.e.,0 < λ < λ2), V BTF
sc will first decrease then increase in
b [as shown in Fig. 3(c)]. This is because with specifically
intensive competition, if the cost is small, the supply chain’s
following the adoption of BT can help to mitigate the inferior
position in a certain extent, otherwise, it will suffer from huge
competition pressure.
Moreover, comparing V BTL
sc and V BTF
sc, we have the fol-
lowing Lemma 1.

Lemma 1 suggests that the early adopter (the leader) can
always snatch more benefit from the adoption of BT than
the follower. Moreover, the more intense the competition is,
the more benefit the early adopter can obtain comparing to the
follower. When one supply chain first adopts BT, it will face
less competitive pressure because its competitor offers ordinary
products without traceability and anticounterfeiting services, so
it can gain greater value from the adoption of BT. On the contrary,
when the other supply chain follows the adoption of BT, it
will face more competitive pressure because its competitor also
offers trusted products with traceability and anticounterfeiting
services, thus obtaining less value.
B. Analysis of the Equilibrium
By analyzing the expected profits of the two supply chains in
the four alternative scenarios, as depicted in Table II, we have
the following (7) shown at the bottom of this page.
Fig. 4 reveals the impact of K and λ on the equilibrium of
the BT adoption strategy. When K is higher than a threshold
(i.e., K > V BTL
sc), both supply chains tend not to adopt BT,
resulting in the equilibrium Scenario (N, N). While both of them
will prefer to adopt BT when K is lower than a threshold (i.e.,
K < V BTF
sc), that is, resulting in equilibrium Scenario (U, U).
Moreover, we can find that the curves of V BTF
sc and V BTL
sc go
up with the increasing of λ. This is consistent with real practice.
When the consumers’ appetites for greater transparency and
integrity of product information increase, the adoption of BT
can create and deliver more values to consumers and increases

their confidence and acceptance to the products adopting BT.
Under this situation, the supply chains can adjust the adoption
strategy to cater to consumers’ changing appetites, and leverage
BT to better capture the demand, even doing so requiring a higher
investment cost. That is, the supply chains should take both the
cost and value of adopting BT into consideration. That is why
BT is more popular to be adopted in the higher value-added
products in developed regions.
Interestingly, we find that when K is in a middle range (i.e.,
V BTF
sc ≤ K ≤ V BTL
sc), the equilibrium is Scenario (U, N)
and Scenario (N, U). That is, one supply chain adopts BT,
whereas the other does not. Moreover, with the increasing of the
competitive intensity, the area of Scenario (U, N) and Scenario
(N, U) will become larger. This finding suggest that the use of
different BT adoption strategies can help the supply chains to
weaken the intensity of competition to a certain extent. Facing
fierce competition, one supply chain is more motivated to adopt
BT to differentiate itself from the other and take the lead to
gain a higher market share. Then, the other supply chain will
carefully consider whether to be the follower of the adoption
of the BT. Generally, it will choose to stand still first while
to be the follower when the investment cost of BT comes
down and/or the market acceptance for the technology becomes
higher.
VI. GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
Since BT is still in its infancy, to encourage the supply chains
to leverage BT to ensure the end-to-end trustworthy traceability
information, many governments have developed supportive reg-
ulations, interventions, and infrastructure to promote its adop-
tion. For example, Tianjin announced a hefty special financial
fund totaling USD 1.48 billion over five years for smart manu-
facturing in May 2018, expecting to boost intelligence upgrades
for emerging industries, including the blockchain [57].
Based on the aforementioned fact, we assume the govern-
ment provides a subsidy S to maximize the social welfare,
which includes three parts. The first part is the profit of two
supply chains: πc1+πc2+πf1+πf2+mS, where m = 0, 1, 2
represents subsidizing none, single, and both supply chains,
respectively. For the convenience of expression, we use S-none
(subsidizing none supply chain), S-one (subsidizing one supply
chain), and S-both (subsidizing both supply chains) to represent
them, respectively. The second part is the consumer surplus:
E( (q1ε)
2+(q2ε)
2+2bq1q2ε

2 ) [58]. The third part is the government
expenditure mS. Therefore, the government’s social welfare is

Fig. 5 reveals the relationships among V BTL
sw, V BTF
sw, b,
and λ.
Fig. 5 suggests that, as λ is small (i.e., 0 < λ ≤ λ3), V BTL
sw
decreases in b while as λ is large than a threshold (i.e., λ3 <
λ < λm), V BTL
sw first decreases then increases in b. When λ is
relatively small, there is little difference between the products
adopting BT and ordinary products, so it is impossible to get
rid of the low price competition between the two products
under high competition intensity, leading to the decrease of
V BTL
sw. However, when λ is large, if the competition intensity
is weak, the increase of competition intensity will significantly
strengthen the internal competition between the two products
and reduce V BTL
sw. But if the competition intensity reaches a
certain level, the larger λ can enhance consumers’ willingness
to purchase and enable the product to be sold at a suitable high
price, which will avoid the low price competition between the
two products under high competition intensity, and can help
to increase the profit of the V BTL
sw. Unlike V BTL
sw, V BTF
sw
always decreases in b. With the increasing of the competition
intensity, the follower will face more intensive competition and
obtain less increase in social welfare from the adoption of BT.

Comparing (7) and (12), we can see that the equilibrium
to maximize social welfare is not always the same as that
choosing from the supply chain perspective. Sometimes it is not
economic to adopt BT from the perspective of profit-maximizing
supply chain (i.e., the investment cost is too high), but it is
beneficial from the perspective of social welfare (i.e., it may
generate more consumer surplus). Obviously, the government
needs to provide a subsidy to encourage supply chains to adopt
the BT if and only if: First, the supply chains will not adopt
BT spontaneously. Second, the adoption of BT is beneficial to
improve social welfare. From (7) and (12), we can easily get
that as V BTL
sc < K < V BTL
sw or V BTF
sc < K < V BTF
sw, the
government needs to provide a subsidy, otherwise, the govern-
ment does not need to subsidize any supply chain.
We compare the values of V BTF
sc, V BTF
sw, V BTL
sc, and
V BTL
sw under different conditions of K, b, and λ, so as to find
out the government’s optimal subsidy scheme (including the
subsidy amount and subsidy object), as shown in Table VII and
Fig. 6.
Table VII and Fig. 6 suggest that the government’s optimal
subsidy scheme vary with K, λ, as well as b.
Specifically, whenK is too large or too small, the government
does not need to provide any subsidies, that is, S-none dominates.
If K is too large (i.e., K ≥ V BTL
sw), the adoption of BT has no
benefit to the society; if K is too small (i.e., K < V BTF
sc), the
two supply chains will both adopt BT and achieve equilibrium
(U,U) spontaneously even without government subsidy.
However, when K is in the middle range (i.e., V BTF
sc ≤
K < V BTL
sw), with the increase of K, the government will

shift from subsidizing both supply chains to subsidizing only
one supply chain, that is, the optimal subsidy object shifts from
S-both to S-one with the increase of K. This is because the
follower adopting BT will further strengthen the competition
environment between the two supply chains, which leads to the
shrink of blockchain value and harm the total social welfare.
From Fig. 6(b), we can notice that there is a small area the
government does not need to provide any subsidy (that is, S-none
area) when the competition intensity reaches a certain high
value (i.e., b > b4), combining with the middle range of λ (i.e.,
(λ4, λ5)). In this area, the equilibrium between supply chains
without subsidy is consistent with the government’s expected
equilibrium, which is Scenario (U, N) or Scenario (N, U).
Interestingly, when λ is specific large [i.e., λ ∈ (λ5, λm) in
Fig. 6(c)], and if the competition intensity is further strengthened
(i.e., b > b5), the government should give up subsidizing both
supply chain, no matter what the investment cost K is. Because
of the high competition intensity and promotion effect, the fol-
lower adopting BT will strengthen the competition environment
greatly. In this case, the benefit to the society is smaller than that
of the supply chain itself, that is V BTF
sw < V BTF
sc.
Table VII and Fig. 6 suggest that the government’s optimal
subsidy scheme vary with K, λ, as well as b.
Specifically, whenK is too large or too small, the government
does not need to provide any subsidies, that is, S-none dominates.
If K is too large (i.e., K ≥ V BTL

benefit to the society; if K is too small (i.e., K < V BTF

two supply chains will both adopt BT and achieve equilibrium
(U,U) spontaneously even without government subsidy.
However, when K is in the middle range (i.e., V BTF
sc ≤
K < V BTL
sw), with the increase of K, the government will
shift from subsidizing both supply chains to subsidizing only
one supply chain, that is, the optimal subsidy object shifts
from S-both to S-one with the increase of K. This is because
the follower adopting BT will further strengthen the competi-
tion environment between the two supply chains, which leads
to the shrink of blockchain value and harm the total social
welfare. From Fig. 6(b), we can notice that there is a small
area the government does not need to provide any subsidy
(that is, S-none area) when the competition intensity reaches
a certain high value (i.e., b > b4), combining with the mid-
dle range of λ (i.e., (λ4, λ5)). In this area, the equilibrium
between supply chains without subsidy is consistent with the
government’s expected equilibrium, which is Scenario (U, N) or
Scenario (N, U).
Interestingly, when λ is specific large [i.e., λ ∈ (λ5, λm) in
Fig. 6(c)], and if the competition intensity is further strengthened

lower adopting BT will strengthen the competition environment

of the supply chain itself, that is V BTF

VII. CONCLUSION
Despite the touting of the VBT, many companies are still
struggling to adopt it in practice. This article investigated the
Nash equilibrium outcome of two competing agri-food supply
chains in the duopoly environment through taking both the
positive side (helps to increase the market size) and negative
side (needs additional investment cost) of the adoption of BT
into consideration. We first analyzed two supply chains’ decision
making behavior and profits under four alternative scenarios
regarding whether or not to adopt BT: (N, N), (U, N), (N, U), and
(U, U), compared the respective profits in these four scenarios,
and got the Nash equilibrium outcome under different condi-
tions. Then, we took the government subsidy into consideration
and further analyzed the choice of the government’s optimal
subsidy scheme to maximize the social welfare.
The findings suggested that the two competing agri-food
supply chains’ Nash equilibrium outcome toward BT adoption
strategy will be greatly affected by key parameters, such as
competitive intensity, the growth rate of the market size with
the adoption of BT, the investment cost of BT, as well as the
planting cost. The BT can bring great competitiveness to the
supply chain competing in high-intensity competition and the
larger growth rate of the market size with the adoption of BT.
Specifically, early adopter can always snatch more benefit from
the adoption of the BT than the follower, and the gap between
them will be increased with competition intensity. When the
investment cost of BT is higher than a threshold, Scenario
(N, N) dominates, whereas Scenario (U, U) dominates as the
investment cost is lower than a threshold. When K is in a middle
range, the equilibrium is Scenario (U, N) and Scenario (N, U),
and the area of this equilibrium will become larger with the
increasing of the competitive intensity. In addition, the results
also showed that the Nash equilibrium outcome selected by two
profit-maximizing supply chains does not always benefit the
consumers surplus and the social welfare. Government needs
to use subsidies to regulate companies’ adoption of blockchain
decisions from society level. Under certain conditions, either
subsidizing a single supply chain or both supply chains can help
to achieve a better social welfare.
A. Theoretical Implications
This study enriched the research and understanding of
blockchain literature. First, despite touting the VBT in ensuring
the end-to-end trustworthy traceability information and create
value to consumers, a key problem arises for agri-food supply
chains in terms of whether to invest in this disruptive technology
is to consider whether the value brought by BT is sufficiently
large to compensate for the increased costs of adopt it. Therefore,
we contribute to the blockchain literature by analytically inves-
tigating whether and under what conditions should the agri-food
supply chains adopt the BT and benefit from it. Second, instead
of a single supply chain perspective, we incorporate the com-
petitor’s interplay response and investigate the better reaction
for the competing argi-food supply chains. Based on the distinct
features of BT and the agri-food market, we take the growth
rate of the market size and the investment cost with the adoption
of BT, as well as the competition intensity, output uncertainty,
planting cost into consideration. The findings help to develop a
more holistic understanding for the competing argi-food supply
chains on strategically choosing the decision on investing in

BT. Third, we extend the blockchain literature by incorporating
the role of government’s subsidy scheme and investigating the
government’s optimal choice for subsidy scheme to maximize
the social welfare. The findings can provide implications for
policy makers who seek to design effective subsidy schemes to
promote the adoption of BT.
B. Managerial Implications
This study also provided interesting implications for both
industrial managers and policy makers when making strate-
gic choice and subsidy scheme to promote the development
of BT.
For the implications to the industrial managers, first, the
findings confirmed that early adopter can always snatch more
benefit from the adoption of BT than the follower, therefore,
managers should change their mindset, act as the first mover
to harness the advantage of BT, and reap the greatest benefit
in the digital transformation era. As reported by JD.com, in its
platform, the brands adopting BT have increased the sales of
health care products by 29.4% and increased the repurchase
rate for fresh seafood by 47.5%, compared with those do not
adopting BT [59]. Second, our study suggested that the benefit
from the adoption of BT differs for the industries with different
characteristics (i.e., competitive intensity, the growth rate of the
market size with the adoption of BT, the investment cost of BT,
the planting cost), thus, managers in different industries should
recognize the characteristics in their industries and choose
“right” BT adoption strategy under competitive environment to
get successfully paid off. Third, it is important for managers to
realize that the adoption of BT requires the participation of all
partners in the supply chain, and thus, reasonable investment cost
allocation among supply chain partners is conducive to facilitate
the adoption of BT. For example, JD Farm, established in 2018,
has cooperated with 17 farms and successfully created a series of
agricultural product brands, such as “Hulunbeir mustard oil” and
“Mengqing millet.” As the core company in the supply chain,
JD is responsible for the R&D and framework building for BT,
and the farms also need to invest in hardware and software
(machines and staff for data collection and management for
example).
For the implications to the policy makers, first, as a macrocon-
troller, the government plays a critical role on moving forward
to facilitate the development of BT. The findings can offer
guidance for policy makers on whether and when a subsidy
should be provided to supply chains to facilitate the adoption
of BT, and thus help them to select the “right” BT projects to
subsidize. Second, we find that the Nash equilibrium outcome
selected by profit-maximizing supply chains does not always
benefit the consumer surplus and the social welfare, which calls
for further government interventions. Policy makers can choose
either subsidizing a single supply chain or both supply chains to
achieve a better social welfare depending on the characteristics
of different industries. By doing this, governments can help
supply chains to shift to the equilibrium outcome consistent
with the one with better social welfare, so as to leverage BT
to enhance value creation in the agri-tech era.
C. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
This study has several limitations that deserve further re-
search. First, in this study, we analyzed the BT adoption strategy
for a whole supply chain perspective, in practice, however, the
adoption of BT requires the participation of all partners in the
supply chain. Therefore, the coordination behavior regarding
BT adoption among supply chain partners needs to be further
investigated. Second, we assumed the adoption of BT helps
to increase the potential market size, given the value of trans-
parency disclosure to consumers, the examination of how BT
affects consumers’ willingness to pay and their decision-making
will help to tease out more interesting implications for firms’
BT adoption decisions. Notwithstanding these limitations, the
current work offers guidance for competing argi-food supply
chains and government on whether adopt BT and which subsidy
scheme should be provided under specified conditions, thus
contribute to the burgeoning research on blockchain literature.

D5, we prove it as follows. It is obvious that ∂ΔF−L
∂b < ∂ΔF−F
∂b <
0 for b ∈ (0, 1), besides D5 > 0. Therefore, ΔF−L(b = 0) > 0
and ΔF−F (b = 0) > 0. Set the root of ΔF−L = 0 is b4 and
the root of ΔF−F = 0 is b5, if the two roots exist in the
area. Because of ∂ΔF−L
∂b < ∂ΔF−F
∂b < 0, there exist b4 < b5.
LetΔF−L(b = 1) < 0 andΔF−F (b = 1) < 0, we can conclude
λ > λ4 and λ > λ5.
Therefore, if λ ∈ (0, λ4], then V BTF
sc < V BTL

In conclusion, there are three cases, which are V BTF

sw ≤ V BTF

sc < V BTL

two cases can be derived similarly and we omit the details
