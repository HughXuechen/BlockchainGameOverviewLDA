Abstract—Due to the forecasted fast increasing cellular traffic
and the already highly congested licensed spectrum, it is critical
to exploit and utilize the unlicensed spectrum resources for the
fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. A challenging problem
is the coexistence of 5G and other networks with fair, reliable,
and efficient sharing of the unlicensed spectrum. In this paper,
we propose a blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum sharing
scheme for coexisting multiple operators and multiple WiFi APs.
We design a novel lightweight and efficient consensus mechanism,
named Proof of Strategy (PoG). In this consensus mechanism, the
problem of spectrum sharing is used as a consensus puzzle, and the
part of the unlicensed spectrum is used as the ‘fee’ of miners. With
such a design, the computing overhead of the consensus process is
expected to be reduced significantly. We develop a non-cooperative
game to analyze the behavior of the miners and obtain a sym-
metric Bayesian Nash equilibrium under the uniform distribution
of mining cost estimation. It can be found mathematically and
experimentally that the strategy of the winner tends to maximize
the system revenue by sharing the unlicensed spectrum resource.
Furthermore, to reduce the impact of heavy interactions on system
throughput, the operation of WiFi APs in the proposed scheme can
be adaptively switched between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain
mode’ according to the network traffic load. The dynamic be-
havior is constructed as an evolutionary game, and the existence
and uniqueness of equilibrium points are proved by theoretical
analysis. Simulations demonstrated the fairness and effectiveness
of the proposed blockchain-based scheme and the mode switching
method for distributed spectrum sharing by heterogeneous wireless
networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
W ITH the fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks starting
to be rolled out globally, it is expected that cellular
network traffic will increase at a fast pace. According to the
latest Ericsson Mobility Report, the total global mobile data
traffic (excluding the traffic generated by fixed wireless access)
is estimated to reach around 65EB per month by the end of
2021, and is projected to grow by a factor of around 4.4 to reach
288EB per month in 2027. The scarcity of licensed spectrum
poses key challenges to delivering sustained performance and
the desired quality of service to connected mobile users [1], [2].
Due to the fast increasing cellular traffic and the already highly
congested licensed spectrum, it is critical to exploit and utilize
the unlicensed spectrum resources for 5G and beyond networks.
As WiFi and other networks have been using the unlicensed
spectrum, a challenging problem for the coexistence of the
heterogeneous wireless networks is fair, reliable, and efficient
sharing of the unlicensed spectrum. This problem becomes
worse due to the Covid-19 pandemic as there are increasing
home working and competing indoor traffic from cell and WiFi
networks. The coexistence problem of unlicensed heterogeneous
networks has attracted great interest from industry and academia.
3GPP has successively launched LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) [3],
licensed assisted access (LAA) [4] and NR- unlicensed (NR-
U) [5] as solutions to the coexistence problem.
Despite the existing work on the coexistence of heterogeneous
wireless networks, there are still many technical challenges to be
tackled to efficiently use the unlicensed bands for the coexisting
networks. Several works [6]–[8] focus on adjusting the param-
eters and mechanisms of the cellular system to ensure fairness
for the WiFi networks, and cellular systems are even required
to learn and predict the traffic patterns of WiFi networks [9],
[11], [12]. However, these schemes can only achieve limited
fairness, as channel access is entirely controlled by the cellular
system. In addition, even the cellular system can guarantee
the fairness of WiFi networks by using contention-based MAC
protocol, it may result in low efficiency of the cellular system.
Coordination of multiple cellular networks with unlicensed
spectrum was investigated by [8], [13]. But there is very little
reported on the coordination among multiple cellular networks
and WiFi networks. It is very difficult for traditional WiFi
networks to coordinate with each other, due to those random and
scattered mobile users. IEEE 802.11ax offers opportunities for
coordination by using cellular-like protocols to schedule WiFi
transmissions from the APs [14]. However, how to design an

appropriate coordination mechanism between WiFi APs and
cellular systems remains an open issue. On the other hand,
massive nodes (such as IoT devices) in next-generation mobile
networks present many challenges to the traditional central-
ized network management in terms of reliability and admin-
istrative cost. It is very difficult to meet the expectations of
multi-stakeholders in heterogeneous networks. Most existing
works on distributed spectrum sharing schemes [10], [15], [16]
change the single-center approach to the multi-centers approach.
However, these local centers can not solve the reliability prob-
lem, instead, they bring management problems as the network
expands. Even a few works implemented user-based distributed
mechanisms [17], the spectrum management is still affected by
a third party with a vulnerable structure.
As a disruptive technology, Blockchain [18] has found many
applications for virtual currency and decentralized system man-
agement [19], [20]. The features of blockchain including decen-
tralization, transparency, immutability, availability, and security,
make it perfectly suitable for distributed decision making by
multiple untrusted unities. Hence, it is widely regarded as a pow-
erful tool for distributed spectrum sharing for wireless networks.
However, one of the barriers to the application of blockchain to
unlicensed spectrum sharing is the excessive communication
and computing overheads and the latency on the consensus
processes. Conventional consensus mechanisms such as proof-
of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consume excessive
computing power resulting in low efficiency on resource use.
Existing lightweight consensus algorithms, such as proof of
reputation [21], still require additional overhead. In addition,
compared with traditional models, the transaction confirmation
delay of blocks will reduce throughput if spectrum resources
are idle. Therefore, how to make efficient blockchain-based
consensus on spectrum sharing under various situations is a
challenge. Furthermore, in the existing consensus mechanisms,
the objectives of the consensus processes are independent of the
distributed spectrum sharing problem, which means separate
spectrum allocation and scheduling decisions are to be made
even a consensus is reached. Even several researchers conducted
the combination approaches of blockchain and spectrum shar-
ing, most of them [22]–[25] follow the bitcoin model, ignoring
the requirements of lightweight and highly efficient consensus
processes of future IoT scenarios.
Motivated by the aforementioned research problems, in this
article, we propose a new blockchain-enhanced distributed
unlicensed spectrum management for heterogeneous wireless
networks, which may not have full trust in each other. More
specifically, we propose a novel lightweight consensus mech-
anism, named Proof of Strategy (PoG), which combines with
the processes of consensus and distributed spectrum alloca-
tion. With the new PoG consensus mechanism, miners (co-
existing networks) who work out a fair spectrum allocation
strategy with the maximal global system revenue will be the
winner of the consensus. It can be proved that the global
revenue of the proposed strategy is close to the global rev-
enue that can be achieved by a central spectrum allocation
system.
The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:
� We propose a multi-operators multi-APs distributed spec-
trum management scheme for unlicensed spectrum shar-
ing, where blockchain is firstly introduced into unlicensed
spectrum management among cellular systems and WiFi
networks. With the proposed scheme, fair spectrum shar-
ing among untrusted heterogeneous wireless networks is
achieved while maintaining high efficiency of spectrum
utilization.
� A lightweight consensus mechanism PoG is designed for
the spectrum sharing task. Miners propose spectrum al-
location solutions that may allocate more spectrum to
themselves as a reward for mining, and the miner with the
greatest global revenue will win. This process is modeled
as a non-cooperative game. The equilibrium points indi-
cate that it is optimal but does not require any additional
spectrum for competing with other potential winners. In
other words, the spectrum allocation solution that seeks
to maximize global revenue becomes the best strategy for
all miners. By setting the spectrum sharing problem as the
consensus puzzle, extra computing overhead unrelated to
the distributed spectrum sharing can be avoided. Simula-
tion results demonstrate the effectiveness and fairness of
the proposed distributed spectrum sharing scheme and the
PoG consensus mechanism.
� To reduce the effect of complex interactions on throughput,
we investigate the transaction validation delay and design
a mode switch algorithm for WiFi APs, which can switch
between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain mode’ accord-
ing to network conditions. In this way, the unnecessary
overhead caused by waiting for transaction validation with
unused spectrum is avoided. Based on CSMA/CA MAC
protocol, we model the dynamic behavior of APs as an
evolutionary game. The existence and uniqueness of Nash
equilibrium are proved mathematically and demonstrated
by simulation experiments. The simulation also shows that
the lower bound of the throughput of the proposed model
is the throughput of the CSMA/CA.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II
reviews distributed spectrum sharing and blockchain technology
for unlicensed spectrum sharing. The distributed spectrum man-
agement scheme is presented in Section III. Detailed analysis
of the PoG consensus mechanism is provided in Section IV.
In Section V, mode switching of WiFi APs is designed and
analyzed as an evolutionary game. Performance evaluation and
conclusion are presented in section VI and VII, respectively.
II. RELATED WORK
Several works have been proposed to tackle the coexistence
problem of the cellular system and the WiFi networks. Almeida
et al. [26] reported that in the absence of any coexistence
mechanism, the throughput of Wi-Fi was reduced by 96.63%
and that of LTE by 0.49%, with no obvious impact on LTE. A
representative work was promoted by 3GPP. Based on R10-12,
LTE-U uses carrier-aware adaptive transmission (CSAT) for the

coexistence of LTE networks and Wi-Fi networks. Duty cycle
(DC) was used to mute LTE so that Wi-Fi can have reasonable
access to the frequency band [27]. The channel occupancy rate
between LTE-U and WiFi networks is defined by the cellular
system, which needs to monitor WiFi network activity for a
long time to determine its optimal duty cycle to ensure fair
spectrum sharing with WiFi. The CSAT-based scheme sched-
ules periodic ‘on/off’ periods over which the cellular system
enables or disables access to the channel. However, it is unfair
for the WiFi network to fully comply with the LTE network
arrangement. LAA, as part of Release 13, supports the listen
before talk (LBT) mechanism, where the transmitter senses an
unlicensed carrier before transmission to avoid conflicts with
other LAA or WiFi nodes at a fixed or random contention
Windows (CW) [4]. Based on the above two mechanisms, serval
works were been proposed. Deep reinforcement learning or deep
neural network was applied in [9], [11], [12], [28], [29], where
the cellular system learns the traffic of WiFi to maintain fair
coexistence. However, these efforts only focus on tuning the
parameters and mechanisms of cellular systems. The size of
the regression window of CSMA/CA and LAA was adjusted
and optimized in the [6], and the impact of IEEE 802.11ax
on the coexistence problem was studied in [7]. However, these
research works are still based on a contention model, which is
unable to achieve efficiency maximization, and the heteroge-
neous coordination between WiFi and the cellular system is still
lacking.
Blockchain is a disruptive technology for decentralized sys-
tems and building trust between untrusted entities. It has been
widely used in the field of spectrum sharing. Most of the works
have been focused on using blockchain to set up a token trade
system between ordinary users or operators. Because of the
spectrum sharing problem in a multi-operators wireless com-
munication network in [22], a blockchain trust framework is
proposed. A. Okon [23] proposed a blockchain-enabled ap-
proach for managing radio spectrum access between operators
using smart contracts over small cellular networks. Similarly, a
blockchain validation protocol is proposed to implement and en-
sure spectrum sharing in mobile cognitive radio networks [24].
Blockchain authorization for secure spectrum sharing in 5G
heterogeneous networks was considered in [25]. The above
work is a simple application of a blockchain ledger, using smart
contracts to build a token exchange system between ordinary
users or operators. However, due to the heavy computation and
communication overhead of the PoW consensus, the existing
blockchain solutions are not directly applicable to the spec-
trum sharing of cell-WiFi coexistence networks. Some existing
lightweight schemes are facing difficulties in the design of
evaluation mechanisms. For example, the evaluation mechanism
of reputation is always subjective in the proof of reputation
mechanism. [21], [30]–[32].
It can be observed that although great efforts have been made
in the above studies, guaranteeing fairness and maintaining
high spectrum utilization efficiency are very challenging for
the coexistence of cellular systems and WiFi networks. Even
if blockchain-based spectrum sharing approaches have been
proposed, there is a strong need for a lightweight and efficient

consensus mechanism, such as the PoG consensus mechanism
proposed in this paper.
III. DISTRIBUTED SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
We propose a collaborative spectrum sharing scheme based
on blockchain for heterogeneous networks. The architecture of
the proposed framework is illustrated in Fig. 1. Subsequently,
the detailed design of the proposed consensus mechanism PoG
will be presented.
A. System Overview
We assume that there are heterogeneous networks, which
comprise mobile users, WiFi APs, and small base stations. Two
types of users use the unlicensed spectrum together: Small Base
Stations (SBSs) and WiFi Access Points (APs). According to
IEEE 802.11ax, the uplink and downlink of WiFi stations are
controlled by APs, and APs still compete for spectrum by the
CSMA/CA protocol. Hence, it should be noted that ‘user’ in the
following paper refers to AP or SBS. In this paper, we consider
a densely populated environment, where the SBSs and APs are
assumed to be the communication range of each other, such as
an apartment. The two SBSs depicted in Fig. 1 points to different
stakeholders who may use the same infrastructure.
We build a spectrum coordination model of heterogeneous
users based on blockchain technology and assume participation
of all cellular networks in resource coordination is mandatory,
and WiFi networks join voluntarily. For ease of expression, WiFi
network joining in spectrum coordination is called Blockchain
CSMA/CA users (BC Users), while the others are called Con-
ventional CSMA/CA users (CC users). To avoid the situations
that a few BC users occupy a large part of resources and ensure
that as many users as possible can transfer including CC users,
each BC user is allowed to be allocated resources that can trigger
an OFDMA transmission within each consensus period. TDMA
(time division multiple addresses) is used in our framework.
Building on the idea of Duty Cycle technology of LTE-U,
we divided the spectrum usage time into multiple cycles. Con-
sidering that many 3GPP members might think that fairness
means that cellular nodes and IEEE 802.11 APs should have
half the bandwidth [33], each cycle is proportionally allocated

to different types of users. As shown in Fig. 1, green indicates the
priority of spectrum use for SBSs, yellow indicates only idle, and
red indicates forbidden. Cellular networks can use the yellow
time slot with no or few competing WiFi networks. Red time
slots are reserved for WiFi networks that are not participating in
resource coordination.
In the blockchain network, the heterogeneous users will store
the results of resource allocation. We use a lightweight strategy-
based consensus to achieve distributed allocation, which is in-
troduced in the next subsection. The proposed architecture can
adapt to different scenarios as shown below.
Scenario with cellular users only: The proposed scheme can
be used to coordinate competition among different stakeholders
with only cellular users on the use of the unlicensed spectrum.
While providing fair spectrum allocation to untrusted entities,
spectrum allocation through mining is shown in Section IV,
which can achieve performance close to the globally optimal.
Scenario with WiFi Networks only: When there are no sched-
uled SBS users, the proposed allocation model gradually degen-
erates into the conventional contention model.
Scenario with heterogeneous wireless networks: By planning
the allocation cycle, we can ensure fairness among different
types of networks users. Considering the characteristics of the
contention access protocol, we allocate the first part of each
cycle to central users. In this way, the CC user is forced to enter
the rollback wait count, avoiding the influence of CC users on
BC users who use spectrum following the allocated time.
B. Consensus Process
In conventional consensus methods (including classical PoW
and PoS), the nodes which solve the puzzles fastest will win
the competition and gain the reward. However, in the proposed
PoG consensus mechanism [34], the users who solve the puzzle
best within the predefined time, i.e., slot T , will win and gain
the reward. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the main procedures of the
proposed consensus can be divided into the following steps:
1) Apply-Transaction generation; 2) Spectrum allocation strat-
egy making; 3) Block generation; 4) Distributed consensus in
slot T .
Step 1. Apply-Transaction Generation: This operation will
be run by all users, who will generate an apply-transaction,
including the public key, the network ID, and the type of the
used MAC protocol.
Step 2. Spectrum Allocation Strategy Making: In every period
T , miners (users) will compute an appropriate spectrum alloca-
tion strategy based on the information from the transaction pool.
We set the consensus period to be the same as the spectrum
allocation period. The winning strategy in consensus slot nt
will be executed in slot nt+h, where h is a system parameter
that can be configured depending on the actual environment.
The incentive for the miner in the traditional blockchain is a
coin such as bitcoin, which is directly recorded in the block.
However, the incentive is more implicit in our model. Users
will gain a different amount of rewards with different spectrum
allocation strategies. All users may wish to propose strategies
that can benefit themselves more in the form of a new block.
Fig. 2. Consensus Process.
Nonetheless, the rule in the consensus process is that the block
with the maximum global revenue will win and be added to
the blockchain. So the block proposed by greedy users will be
unlikely added to the blockchain. To increase the probability
of winning, all miners will need to propose a strategy with a
trade-off between their interests and global interest. A detailed
mathematical model for the analysis of user behavior will be
presented in the next section.
Step 3. Block Generation: Upon generating their strategy, the
miners will generate a new block for the competition in the next
slot. The block header contains mainly two parts, the hash value
of the last block and the Merkle tree root of the transaction
list. Compared to bitcoin, the proposed blockchain has a smaller
header with the information of the hash puzzle.
Step 4. Consensus competition: Before the end of the current
slot, miners broadcast their blocks to the blockchain network.
As the blockchain network is built over the local network, the
information of new blocks can be transported to every node in
a short time. Every node will receive all new blocks before the
beginning of the next slot and add the block with the maximum
global revenue into the blockchain.
Tamper-proofing is one of the most important advantages of
blockchain. Traditional blockchain can help achieve tamper-
proofing in two methods. An old block that is in the front of
the blockchain is protected by the next new block which stores
the hash value of the old block. The new block is protected by
a hash-puzzle, which requires plenty of computation power to
handle the hash-puzzle and can be verified by all the miners. In
our model, the second method is not used as there is no harm
if new blocks to be linked are changed. As for the blockhead,
the previous hash value cannot be changed and the head of the
Merkle is associated with the transaction list. The transaction list
stores the spectrum allocation strategy and the global revenue of
the block varies with the transaction list. If the global revenue

of the block becomes smaller, it will win the consensus process.
If the revenue becomes larger, it will be good for the system
revenue. In conclusion, there is no need to protect a new block
before it is added to the blockchain in our model. But the special
method of miner rewarding will make it more difficult for an
adversary to benefit from a vicious mining way.
IV. MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR POG
CONSENSUS MECHANISM
The consensus competition in this paper can be viewed as
within the same type of users. For example, when a WiFi user is
a miner, to improve the probability of winning, the allocation of
resources to the cellular users should be made to maximize the
global revenue, and vice versa. Considering that the proportion
of resources allocated to one type of user is fixed, WiFi users and
cellular users can be allocated resources separately. Therefore,
the consensus rule can be expressed as the following model.
A. Consensus Mechanism
Like several existing works [35], [36], we assume that the
average spectral efficiency is R. Consequently, the total trans-
mission quantity of user i ∈ N is ri = Rti, where ti is the
duration of channel occupied by the user i. T is the total amount
of available time. The utility u(r) is defined as anα-fair function
with α ∈ (0, 1).
u(r) =
r1−α
1 − α
, (1)
The utility function may not be consistent with the actual sit-
uation of users, but it is introduced to measure the fairness
of the users. The proposed consensus rule is to maximize the
global revenue, so the miner who proposes a resource allocation
strategy with the largest global revenue will be the winner. We
first calculate the maximum global revenue, which can be used
as assessment criteria for miners.
The global optimization problem can be formulated as the
following convex problem:
max
t
∑
i∈N
(Rti)
1−α
1 − α
0 �
∑
i
ti � T (2)
We can get the optimal solution t∗ when the first derivative is
zero, which can be shown as
t∗ =
T
|N | (3)
We assume that miners are as self-interested as possible and
when they act as decision-makers, they will allocate the spectrum
resources in ways that can benefit them. For a general user i, it
will set up an optimization problem as follow:
max
t
∑
j∈N
(Rtj)
1−α
1 − α
0 �
∑
j
tj � T
ti = t∗ + βi (4)
where βi is the extra spectrum resource reserved for user i using
before allocation, and it can be regarded as the reward of winning
the competition. Similarly, it is also a convex problem, and the
optimal solution where the first derivative is zero is as follows:
t(βi) =
T − t∗ − βi
|N | − 1
(5)
where t(βi) represent the optimal solution of maximizing the
global revenue with the constraint of ti = t∗ + βi.
The probability of being the winner is closely related to
the decay of global revenue brought by βi. The decay can be
described by a decay ratio γi as
γi =
(|N | − 1)
(Rt(βi))
1−α
1 − α
+
(Rt∗ +Rβi)
1−α
1 − α
|N | (Rt∗)1−α
1 − α
(6)
Hence, the comparison of global revenue can be converted into
a comparison of γ of the proposed strategies by each user.
B. Non-Cooperative Game of Miners
Next, we use the non-cooperative game to model the strategy
of miners, specifically the βi. The determination of a miner is
not only affected by the utility, but also by the probability to be
the winner in the consensus process. The game is to model the
competition among miners, where the game solution is a Nash
equilibrium.
Any user can be a miner, which can freely chosen resource
allocation strategy on its own. The utility of user i being a
winning miner is
UW
i = t∗ + βi (7)
When the user i is not successful in the consensus process, the
utility function will become as
UL
i = Eb (8)
whereEb is the average resource of not being a miner and waiting
for the spectrum decision from others.
When the strategies of the other users are determined, the best
response of user i is
B(β−i) = argmax

As the ratio γi is a monotone decreasing function of βi, γi >

Theorem 1: Under the uniform distribution of mining cost
estimation, the symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the
non-cooperative game is
B(β−i) = 0 (11)
Proof: Player/miner j takes the strategy βj = Θ(·). With the
relationship between the bid of users and the value of the product
widely used in the classic auction model, we assume Θ(·) is
a monotonically increasing differentiable function of cost ci,
including computation and communication resource brought by
mining. Θ−1(βj) is the estimated cost when the bid of user j is
βj , that is βj = Θ(cj). Based on the classic auction assumptions
about the value of goods, we assume the cost of each user
is uniformly distributed over [0,1]. Hence the expectations of
spectrum resource Eb can be obtained as follows:
Eb =
∫ 1

As cj is uniformly distributed over [0,1],
Prob(βi < βj) = Prob(Θ−1(βi) < cj) = 1 −Θ−1(βi) (13)

−(nm − 1)[Θ(ci) + t∗ − Eb] + (1 − ci)
dΘ(ci)
dci
= 0 (17)
which can be solved as
Θ(ci) = ξ(ci − 1)−nm+1 − (t∗ − Eb) (18)
For ci = 0, user i is assumed to choose to be a miner with
no reward required, which is equal to ξ(−1)−nm+1 = t∗ − Eb.
Hence,
Θ(ci) = (t∗ − Eb)[(1 − ci)
−nm+1 − 1] (19)
Combining equation (12) and (19), we can obtain Eb = t∗. As
a result,
Θ(ci) = 0 (20)
Even if we use a looser but still reasonable assumption of
Eb < t∗ instead of equation (12), we can find thatΘ(ci) = 0 still
holds. The reason can be explained as follows. The exception
revenue for miner iwith βi = Θ(ci) is equal to t∗, which is same
as the revenue at global maximum point, where βi = 0. �
Under the proposed consensus rule, the miners asking for
extra compensation may not increase the expected utility, as the
probability of not winning the competition increases. B(β−i) =
0 means that miners will work without claiming excessive
reward by proposing greedy strategies. Therefore, the revenue
of the distributed decision model will approach the maximum
global revenue of the central system.
V. MODE SWITCHING AND ITS MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
In the case of sharing unlicensed spectrum bands, users with
distributed coordination function (DCF) used in CSMA/CA
cannot be forced to join the blockchain system to participate in
centralized scheduling. In addition, transaction validation delay
often leads to lower throughput during the spectrum idle period.
To adapt to various situations, WiFi APs in the proposed frame-
work can switch between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain
mode’ according to system throughput performance. Based on
evolutionary game theory, this section mainly analyzes the mode
selection of CSMA/CA users with the aim to improve through-
put.
A. Two Work Model
1) Contention Model: In this model, the users will follow
the conventional CSMA/CA. The collision probability of each
packet can be expressed as with the widely used analytical
model [37]:
ρ = 1 − (1 − τ)n−1, (21)
wheren is the number of contending stations which are assumed
to have saturated traffic. Each station transmits a packet with
probability τ , given by
τ =
2(1 − 2ρ)
(1 − 2ρ)(CWmin + 1) + ρCWmin(1 − (2ρ)m)
, (22)

ZHANG et al.: BLOCKCHAIN ENHANCED COEXISTENCE OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS ON UNLICENSED SPECTRUM 7619
where m is the maximum backoff stage and CWmin is the
minimum backoff window. Based on [37], there is only one
solution (τ, ρ) of equation (21) and (22).
Based on τ , the probability of at least one transmitting in a
slot can be expressed as
Ptr = 1 − (1 − τ)n. (23)
The probability that one user transmits successfully in a slot
is shown as follows:
Ps =
nτ(1 − τ)n−1
1 − (1 − τ)n
. (24)
The normalized system throughput can be defined as follows
S =
PSPtrE[P ]
(1 − Ptr)σ + PtrPSTS + Ptr(1 − PS)TC
, (25)
where E[P ] is the average payload size of an OFDMA trans-
mission, and the TS is the average time the channel is sensed
busy because of successful transmission. TC is the average time
the channel is sensed busy by each station during a collision. σ
is the propagation delay.
However, when the channel is occupied by blockchain users,
the CSMA/CA users will detect that the channel is busy and will
wait for channel to be available or rollback counting. Therefore,
the actual average communication rate RC is as follows:
RC = min
{
0,
(
1 − tB
T
)}
S (26)
where T is the time of the blockchain schedule cycle, and tB is
the time occupied by blockchain users.
2) Blockchain Model: Users under the blockchain model still
follow the original MAC protocol, i.e. Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) user still waits
for Distributed Inter-frame Spacing (DIFS) before communicat-
ing. Because of the pre-scheduled time, users in the blockchain
mode can conduct channel listening at the proper time, avoiding
the detection of a busy and backoff. In blockchain mode, users
with the centralized MAC protocol are placed at the front of the
scheduling table. Therefore, at the beginning of each scheduling
cycle, non-blockchain CSMA/CA users must begin to wait a
random backoff time because they detect a ‘busy’ channel. Since
then, the channel continues to be busy, causing its rollback count
to be frozen until the blockchain mode user ends spectrum usage.
So users in blockchain mode can be thought of as simply waiting
for DIFS to begin non-interference transmission. Hence, the
normalized system throughput can be defined as
RB =
mBE(P )
T
, (27)
wheremB is the average number of the packet transmitting under
the blockchain mode.
B. Evolution Game Model
The evolutionary game is a mathematical tool developed by
biologists for predicting population dynamics [38]. We define
an evolutionary game for the users as follow:
� Players: Each CSMA/CA user is a player of the game.
In this paper, they can dynamically choose the modes to
obtain the highest utility in terms of throughput. The users
can gradually change the mode selfishly by observing the
action of others.
� Strategies: There are only two strategies to choose, which
are ‘blockchain mode’ and ‘contention mode’.
� Utility: The utility is defined as the throughput. The utility
of users under the blockchain mode and contention mode
is as follows respectively:
UB = RB
UC = RC (28)
In a dynamic evolutionary game, each individual can replicate
the strategy used by the others through learning. This process
of replication can be modeled by a set of differential equations,
i.e., the replicator dynamics. Let the proportion of CSAM/CA
users selecting blockchain mode and contention mode be ex-
pressed as xB = nB/n, xC = nC/n, where n = nB + nC is
the total number of CSMA/CA users/stations, and nB and nC
are the number of CSMA/CA users under blockchain mode
and contention mode. In each iteration, the users will adopt the
strategy with high utility. Moreover, the game is repeated until
the equilibrium is achieved. The speed of the users in learning the
strategy is controlled by parameter θ > 0. For a small period, the
rate of game evolution is controlled by the replicator dynamics,
which is defined as:
∂xB(t)
∂t
= θxB(t)(UB − UC)
∂xC(t)
∂t
= θxB(t)(UC − UB) (29)
where xB + xC = 1.
It is noted that there is a special situation where no resource is
available for competing users with UC = 0. When this happens,
all users will choose the blockchain mode, further deepening
the trend. This situation will only happen when there is a huge
demand for spectrum resources. In the following, we are going to
look at other cases with UC > 0, such as when the system is not
overcrowded or the blockchain system has just been launched.
The equilibrium would be obtained as a solution of:
UB = UC . (30)
For the sake of brevity, we will write xB as x in the following.
The equilibrium also can be written specifically as follows:
nxE(P )
T
=
[T − noTo − nxTs]PSPtrE(P )
T [(1 − Ptr)σ + PtrPSTS + Ptr(1 − PS)TC ]
(31)
where noTo is the time occupied by schedule-users.
Based on the unique solution of equation (21) and (22), there
is also a mapping from x to (ρ, τ), denoted as (ρ, τ) = f(x). It

can be reduced to the form of a quadratic function as follows
Ax2 +Bx+ C = 0
A = aτ(1 − ρ)
B = bτ(1 − ρ) + (TC − σ)ρ+ σ
C = cτ(1 − ρ)
(ρ, τ) = f(x) (32)
The above parameters a, b and c are constants as follows:
a = (TC − 2TS)n
b = (2TS − TC)n+ (TC − σ) + (T − noTo)
c = −(T − noTo) (33)
Obviously, according to the fairness of spectrum allocation, the
spectrum share reserved for CSMA/CA cannot be zero, with
T − noTS > 0. With the properties of CSMA/CA, we can know
TS > TC > σ. As a result,
a < 0, b > 0, c < 0 (34)
As the parameter τ and ρ are the probability,
A < 0, B > 0, C < 0 (35)
Let y(x) = Ax2 +Bx+ C, we can know y(0) = C < 0,
and y(1) = A+B + C = (TC − σ)τ(1 − ρ) + (TC − σ)ρ+
σ > 0. Considering A < 0, there is a unique positive zero point
at (0,1), which can be built as the mapping from (ρ, τ) to the
zero point x, denoted as x = g(ρ, τ), x ∈ (0, 1).
Obviously x is bounded and less than 1. We assume that the
blockchain mode carries an upper limit of n′, i.e., the upper limit
of x is n′/n. We can obtain y(n′/n) > 0, as noTo + n′Ts = T .
That meana the equilibrium is less than the upper limit, but for
convenience, we still use (0,1) in the subsequent analysis.
Theorem 2. Existence: At least one Nash equilibrium exists
in the evolution game
Proof: Obviously, the equilibrium should satisfied x =
g(ρ, τ), x ∈ (0, 1) and (ρ, τ) = f(x) simultaneously. Hence,
the equilibrium x∗ can be solved by
x∗ = g(f(x∗)) (36)
As g(f(x)) is a continuous function, there exist at least a point
where x∗ = g(f(x∗)), with g(f(0)) > 0 and g(f(1)) < 1, �
Before we prove that the equilibrium point is unique, we will
make some lemma as follow.
Lemma 1: If (ρ, τ) = f(x) and (ρ,′ τ ′) = f(x′) with x > x′,
there is a relationship that τ ′ > τ , ρ > ρ′, τ(1 − ρ) > τ ′(1 − ρ′)
and τ + ρ− τρ > τ ′ + ρ′ − τ ′ρ′
Proof: As x = g(ρ, τ) ∈ (0, 1), we just need consider x ∈
(0, 1), when we analyse (ρ, τ) = f(x). We can convert equation
(21) to τ(ρ) = 1 − (1 − ρ)1/[n(1−x)−1]. The first derivative is
shown below:
∂τ
∂x
= −nln(1 − ρ)(1 − ρ)1/n(1−x)−1
[n(1 − x)− 1]2
(37)
With ln(1 − ρ) < 0, we can have
∂τ
∂x
> 0, which means
τ(ρ|x) > τ(ρ|x′). We can obtain τ ∗(ρ) by equation (22), and it
is a monotonically decreasing function. When τ(ρ∗x) = τ ∗(ρ∗x),
we can get τ(ρ∗x′) < τ ∗(ρ∗x). Hence, when τ(ρ∗x′) = τ ∗(ρ∗x′), we
have ρ∗x′ < ρ∗x and τ ∗(ρ∗x′) < τ ∗(ρ∗x). It can be rewrite as τ ′ > τ ,
ρ > ρ′.
We can calculate the first derivative of τ(1 − ρ) and τ + ρ−
τρ as follows
∂(τ(1 − ρ))
∂τ
= (1 − τn(1 − x)(1 − τ)n(1−x)−2)
∂(τ + ρ− τρ)
∂τ
= n(1 − x)(1 − τ)n(1−x)−1 (38)
So, we can get τ(1 − ρ) > τ ′(1 − ρ′) and τ + ρ− τρ > τ ′ +
ρ′ − τ ′ρ′, when τ > τ ′. �
Lemma 2: The intersection point of any two quadratic func-
tions y(x|ρ, τ) corresponding to (ρ, τ) = f(x) is unique and
less than the intersection point of each of them with the X-axis.
Proof: In order to analyse the intersection point of y(x|ρ, τ)
and y(x|ρ,′ τ ′), let
y∗ = y(x|ρ, τ)− y(x|ρ,′ τ ′)
= A∗x2 +B∗x+ C∗ (39)
where
A∗ = a[τ(1 − ρ)− τ ′(1 − ρ)]
B∗ = b[τ(1 − ρ)− τ ′(1 − ρ′)] + (TC − σ)(ρ− ρ′)
C∗ = c[τ(1 − ρ)− τ ′(1 − ρ′)] (40)
Same as before, we assume x > x′. From Lemma 1, we can
obtain
A∗ < 0, B∗ > 0, C∗ < 0 (41)
and
y∗(0) = C∗ < 0
y∗(1) = A∗ +B∗ + C∗
= (TC − σ)[(τ + ρ− τρ)− (τ ′ + ρ′ − τ ′ρ′)] > 0
(42)
Hence, there exist unique real solution for y∗(x) = 0 at (0,1).
Because A < 0, A′ < 0 and A∗ < 0, the real root at (0,1) is the
smaller one. So we can write the general form of the roots at
(0,1) as follows:
x∗ = − B

Hence, x(ly) > x(xy∗). �
Lemma 3: g(f(x)) is monotone decreasing function at (0,1).
Proof: On the basis of Lemma 2, when (ρ, τ) = f(x) and
(ρ,′ τ ′) = f(x) with x > x′, the zero point of y(x|ρ, τ) and
y(x|ρ,′ τ ′) is large than the intersection point x∗ of them. We
have proved above that x∗ is unique at (0,1), so y(x|ρ, τ) <
y(x|ρ,′ τ ′) at x > x∗, and y(x|ρ, τ) < y(x|ρ,′ τ ′) at x > x∗.
Hence, for x0 satisfying y(x0|ρ, τ) = 0, we can get
y(x0|ρ,′ τ ′) < 0. Considering y(1|ρ,′ τ ′) > 0, the zero point of
y(x|ρ,′ τ ′) is at (x0, 1).
As a result, g(ρ, τ) < g(ρ,′ τ ′) at (0,1). �
Theorem 3. Uniqueness: The Nash equilibrium of the evolu-
tion game is unique. �
Proof: On the basis of Lemma 3, there cannot be multiple
intersection points of g(f(x)) and h(x) = x, because g(f(x))
is a monotonically decreasing function and h(x) is monoton-
ically increasing. If there exist two intersection points x1 and
x2 with x1 > x2, then g(f(x2)) < g(f(x1)) = h(x1) < h(x2)
and g(f(x2)) = h(x2). Obviously there is a conflict. So the
intersection point is unique. The solution of x = f(g(x)) is
unique. �
VI. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, the performance of the proposed blockchain-
based distributed spectrum sharing scheme is evaluated by sim-
ulations. The simulator is implemented in the Matlab environ-
ment. Following [39], the system parameters are determined as
Table I. We consider a scenario of a densely populated environ-
ment (such as a part of a residential building) with 2 SBSs, and
several APs. The SBSs and APs are all in the communication
range of each other.
Fig. 3. Normalized throughput of Blockchain Mode and Conventional Mode
again the Number of APs.
A comparison between the proposed blockchain model with-
out ‘mode switching’ and the non-blockchain model will be
presented. Then, we analyze the performance change brought
by ‘mode switching’. We analyze the throughput and Nash
equilibrium with different consensus periods and the various
number of APs. The mining reward, revenue, and reliability of
blockchain mode are also considered. We compare the perfor-
mance of PoS and PoG in terms of computational overhead and
spectrum allocation efficiency. In the simulations, we assume
that all users choose to act as miners because of the lightweight
consensus mechanism.
The period of DC in the convention mode (CM) is the same
as the consensus period of the blockchain mode (BM) at period
= 5 ms, and the allocation ratio is the same as 0.5, we compared
the throughput of these two. As the network is in a small area,
the consensus period should be within a few milliseconds, and
100 ms is a conventional period value of the duty cycle, so we
use it for comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the blockchain
model based on the proposed Proof of Strategy can perform
better when there are many APs and resources are scarce.
However, due to the delay of the consensus process, when the
number of APs is small, the performance of the conventional DC
technology with the same cycle is better. Therefore, to solve this
problem, a dynamic switching mechanism has been proposed in
Section V.
The average throughput is closely related to the percentage
of blockchain users and the total number of users. As shown in
Fig. 4, we compare the average throughput of the Switching
Mode (SM) with that of the Conventional duty cycle Mode
(CM) and Blockchain Mode (BM) without switching. The SM
can greatly improve the average throughput of users because
the loss from collisions is reduced. Although the throughput
of the proposed model declines as the blockchain cycle period
increases, it is at least on par with conventional models. Similar
to the previous analysis, the larger the number of APs, the more
advantages of the BM over the CM can be maintained over a
longer blockchain cycle period. SM based on dynamic mode
selection can obtain the maximum throughput. Compared with
SM at 6 ms, SM at 8 ms enters blockchain mode more slowly,
which also corresponds to Fig. 5.

Fig. 4. Average Throughput with Different Number of APs.
Fig. 5. Nash Equilibrium in Evolutionary Games with Different Number of
APs.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, we test the relationship between
the proportion of users choosing the blockchain mode and the
blockchain cycle, as well as the influence of the number of
APs on it. The proportion of blockchain users represents the
Nash equilibrium of evolutionary games. In the analysis of the
equilibrium point in section V, we proved that the equilibrium
point is unique and not equal to 0 or 1, which is different
from the simulation results. Because in the process of proof,
we used the continuous number of users, but in the simulation
it is discrete. Equilibrium points that may not be equal to 0
or 1 in mathematical analysis fall on 0 and 1 in simulation.
As the blockchain cycle period increases, the number of users
choosing blockchain mode gradually decreases. As the cycle
period increases, blockchain users tend to choose the contention
mode because the allocation time they need to wait is too long.
As the number of APs increases, the throughput in contention
mode decreases, allowing blockchain users to tolerate a longer
allocation cycle period.
We compare the global utility of the proposed scheme with
that of the traditional one under spectrum resource allocation. To
better reflect the changes in the strategy of miners, we assume
some miners are very radical who believe Eb = 0, and removed
the miners who chose β = 0, i.e., all miners who chose the
globally optimal strategy. If users with β = 0 are not removed,
the β curve will overlap the X-axis and cannot be observed. As
shown in Fig. 6, the two curves overlap very well, when we

assume that the revenues of all users are based on the α-fair
function. The changes of the corresponding mining reward for
the winning miners are also drawn. It can be seen that even if
the users with β = 0 are removed, the strategy of the winner for
the rest of the users gradually approaches 0.
The simulation results are consistent with our proof in Sec-
tion IV. With the increase of users, the optimal response moves
close to 0. Our analysis shows that the expected revenue of min-
ers at this extreme value point is the same as the expected revenue
of β = 0, which is the user revenue under global optimization.
The optimal solution of β in the domain is 0 and the extreme
point. So, even with a small number of users, there are miners
who will choose β = 0 to increase the stability of revenue.
In addition, we compare the reliability of the proposed model
with the centralized resource allocation approach. As shown
in Fig. 7, it is assumed that there is a malicious attacker, and
the success rate of the attacked nodes is shown on the X-axis.
In the proposed distributed model, the success rate of attack is
represented by the ratio of disabled miner nodes. Similarly, we
assume the miners are radical who believeEb = 0. The Y-axis is
the mean of the normalized global revenue of several trials, and
we can obtain that the revenue of the proposed model is stable
until success rare is 1.
Next, we compare the computational overhead and global rev-
enue of the proposed consensus mechanism PoG based scheme
with that of the PoW based one in Fig. 8. Considering that the
investigated scenario is a small local area network, the block
generation period of PoW is assumed to be 50 ms, which means

that if the average block generation delay is less than 50 ms,
the difficulty of the Hash puzzle will be increased. So there
is a change in overhead for 15 users. For a single node, it
can be found that the overhead of the proposed model is the
same as that with a distributed management architecture without
blockchain. However, the conventional PoW model will greatly
increase the computational overhead. In addition, we compare
the performance of the two consensus mechanisms in spectrum
resource sharing. We assume that the winning miner in the PoW
can obtain spectrum allocation rights and behave in a greedy
manner. Compared with the proposed PoG, PoW performs
poorly in spectrum sharing, so it is necessary to introduce an
alternative spectrum sharing mechanism to achieve efficient and
fair resource sharing.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a multi-operators multi-APs distributed
spectrum management scheme for unlicensed spectrum shar-
ing. Blockchain is firstly introduced into unlicensed spectrum
management among coexisting cellular systems and WiFi net-
works. More specifically, we propose a lightweight consensus
mechanism (Proof of Strategy), which attempts to solve both
the consensus problem in the blockchain and the distributed
spectrum allocation problem by setting the spectrum allocation
problem as the blockchain puzzle to be solved. Extra computa-
tion overhead such as solving the hash puzzles in traditional
blockchain can be avoided. The behavior of the miners was
analyzed by a non-cooperative game, and symmetric Bayesian
Nash equilibrium was obtained under the uniform distribution.
It was proved that the bid tends to be zero, which was verified
by simulations. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of complex
user interactions on throughput, a mode switch algorithm was
proposed for the WiFi APs, which can dynamically switch
between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain mode’ according
to the network conditions. The dynamic behavior of users was
studied as an evolutionary game. The existence and uniqueness
of Nash equilibrium for the game were proved mathematically
and verified by simulation results. The proposed distributed
spectrum allocation scheme can be applied to the distributed
autonomous spectrum management in 6G networks. In addi-
tion, the theoretic analysis of the blockchain-based spectrum
sharing scheme can provide a strong basis for the evaluation
and optimization of global revenue in a distributed environ-
ment. In the future, we will extend our works with intelligent
control and applications of blockchains for distributed spectrum
management.
