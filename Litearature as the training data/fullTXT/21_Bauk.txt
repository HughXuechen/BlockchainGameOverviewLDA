Abstract:  
The demand for radioactive materials has been increasing over the last five decades, and 
therefore it is to be expected that the need for radioactive materials transportation shall also 
increase. The Radio Frequency and IDentification (RFID) technology has already made 
progress in this field and become the most widespread way to track and trace radioactive cargo. 
The easy installation, simple and fast data transfer from the sensor through RFID transponder, 
along with compactness and quality of the sensors provide a safe and easy way of using this 
technology in transport of the radioactive materials. A variety of sensors, such as temperature, 
radiation, speed, earthquake, (Differential) Global Positioning System (D)GPS, etc., are the 
key, but not the only one part of the complex system that is responsible for safe transportation 
of radioactive goods. A large number of parameters that must be monitored at the same time, 
as well as the simplicity of the system, are strengthened by using the appropriate RFID 
software. By means of this software, the operator has insight into the condition of the 
radioactive material inside the container without the risk of exposure to radiation, and without 
compromising the safety and security of the data exchange at any time. By using the latest-
generation crypto tools, security has been guaranteed. 
Keywords:  
radioactive materials, sea transportation, tracking and tracing, RFID technology. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Today nuclear power provides 10% of the world’s electricity. Due to the clime change, 80% of 
all electricity will need to be clean and low carbon by 2050 [1]. Therefore, nuclear capacity 
should be considerably increased in order to meet climate goals. Russia, India and China are 
currently leaders in expanding nuclear power production. For instance, China has nine reactors 
under construction now. Finland, United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Bangladesh and Turkey are 
also building new reactors. Currently, in total 450 nuclear power reactors operate worldwide. 
 
Plans for increasing nuclear capacity are always connected with huge and high-risk 
investments. Small modular reactors make these plans more feasible and allow combining 
  
nuclear power with renewables, i.e., sources of energy that are not depleted by use, such as 
water, wind or solar power. The environmental consciousness is generally rising and it becomes 
evident that energy need could not be satisfied in the future by sole use of coal or natural gas. 
Besides, for producing electrical power, nuclear energy is used for variety of research, industry, 
agriculture, and medicine purposes. 
With increase of nuclear capacity worldwide, it is to be expected that the need for radioactive 
materials (RAM) transportation will increase. Thereby, sea transportation will undoubtedly 
play an important role in satisfying irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and radioactive waste 
transportation requirements in the upcoming period [2]. 
In this research article, we will be focused on literature review in the field of RAM 
transportation by means of sea, road and rail transport (Section 2). Particular emphasize will be 
given to tracking RAM cargo during its transportation or transshipment. An overview of the 
ARG-US project achievements, when it comes to tracking and tracing RAM in road and rail 
transportation, will be given (Section 3). After that, an attempt to conceive a similar model of 
RAM tracking in sea transportation will be done (Section 4). At the end, some conclusion 
remarks and directions for further research work in the field will be given (Section 5).  
 
1. LITERATURE REVIEW 
There is a scarcity of research articles on nuclear cargo transportation, which are available 
online. Below are presented some of the articles, which have been found after an extensive web 
search. Legislative framework of maritime transportation of irradiated nuclear fuel (INF), 
plutonium and radioactive wastes together with widely expressed concern that an accident may 
occur to a ship carrying such cargo has been studied in [2]. The same study reviews the legal 
issues associated with the right of emergency access to a foreign seaport by a ship transporting 
nuclear materials. It also considers whether seabed characteristics should be assessed in 
determining the routing of nuclear cargo ships, bearing in mind that ocean floor topography and 
sea water depth will be crucial in determining whether recovery of nuclear materials would be 
practicable in the event of sinking of a ship. The description of ship carrying nuclear cargo 
construction requirements has been given in [3]. This paper presents INF Code requirements 
due to the ship’s construction, fire safety measures, electrical power supply, cargo stowage and 
segregation, emergency planning and security measures. World Nuclear Transport Institute 
(WNTI) has published a fact sheet on the transport of nuclear fuel [4]. This study gives relevant 
data on the nuclear fuel cycle, front-end operations, fuel fabrication, reprocessing, transport 
packaging, sea transport, purpose-built vessels, etc. A model of response in the case of 
radioactive cargo transportation in Japan has been presented in [5]. The authors have given in 
this reference an overview of the tracking system for radioactive material transport including 
sensor unit, communication network, central monitoring center and sub-terminals, which 
provide trend viewer, abnormal situation detection, current situation and next step during the 
shipment. The authors of the references [6;7;8] have given description of applying Radio 
Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology in nuclear material management. They have 
provided prototype tag design and production, prototype application software including 
graphical user interface and preliminary test results in terms of read range, sensor performance, 
memory read/write, seal sensor, battery life, etc. It is worth to mention within the context that 
reference [9] gives a general insight in RFID technology and its applications. The authors of 
the reference [10] have dealt with mathematical modeling and simulations, based on special 
  
tran-function theory, in estimating temperature of plutonium during its transportation. The 
authors of [11] have investigated efficiency of detectors for intercepting illicit trafficking of 
fissionable material in container cargo in maritime transportation. They have suggested tagged 
neutron inspection system in addition to container content X-ray scan, etc.  
 
2. TRACKING RAM IN ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION 
In 2008 Argonne National Laboratory (Chicago, Illinois, USA) Packaging Certification 
Program (PCP) team has developed RFID tracking and monitoring system for the management 
of RAM packages during storage and transportation [12]. This system, called ARG-US, is 
composed of appropriate hardware modification, application software, secured database, 
protected web access, and irradiation experimental measurements. The B fissile material drums 
(models 9975, 9979 and ES-3100) certified by US Department of Energy and US Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission have been used for testing the prototype. The demonstration of the 
system successfully integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) for vehicles and railway 
wagons positioning, including their RAM cargo, satellite and cellular General Radio Package 
Service (GPRS) wireless communications, the RFID tags attached to the RAM drums, and 
Geographic Information System (GIS) technology in geo-fencing purposes [13], etc. The RFID 
tags and GPS technology in combination with GIS enable dedicated software to trigger a 
response when a mobile device enters or leaves certain geographical area. The RFID in 
combination with GPS generate an alarm in the case of an incident with the RAM drums. Figure 
1 gives an overview of the ARG-US prototype and associated field experiment. The fifty 
authorized stakeholders across the country of Illinois (USA) have observed the demonstration 
via secured internet access.

[13]) Scheme of ARG-US RFID monitoring and tracking RAM drum 
packages during storage and transport (Source: [12]) 
  
a) b) 
Firstly, experiments have been made with road transportation of a vehicle with 14 RAM drums 
along the route Chicago (Illinois) to Augusta (South Carolina). Sensor data were updated every 
10 minutes, while several incidents of seal (i.e., loosening the drum bolts) and shock sensor 
violations were observed. At two mountain spots lost of satellite/cellular connection has been 
noticed. In addition, an incident with low battery level at sensors’ unit attached to the RAM 
drum has been indicated (Figure 2). 
  
 
Figure 2. The ARG-US project graphical interface: round symbols 
represent RAM drums (Source: [12]) 
 
The RAM dram marked yellow indicates a potential danger since battery is low at the moment. 
A drum marked red means serious danger, while a drums marked green indicates that 
everything is in order and there is no danger of an incident. The system tracks the drums in road 
transportation in close to real time. After these experiments in transportation of RAM cargo, a 
series of experiments at Argonne (Chicago, Illinois, USA) radiological facility has been realized 
across the RAM drums storage areas. Two layers of network for tracking and tracing stored 
RAM drums have been set: a multi-sand wired one as the first layer based on Ethernet, and the 
second one based on wireless network. Blink sensors have been used as wireless sensors that 
communicate only upstream with the Remote Area Modular Monitoring (RAMM) 
infrastructure nodes. They enable fast connection to the existing wireless sensor network 
(WSN). A digital video camera, or optical sensor, has been also incorporated into the RAMM 
platform. More about these second term set of the ARG-US experiments can be found in 
references [13;14;15].  
Due to the lack of research articles when it comes to tracking RAM drums as single items in 
sea transportation, we have used the experiences from the ARG-US project realization to 
propose a model for RAM cargo tracking in marine transportation. Prior to the presenting the 
model, we have given a short overview of some structural  requirements that ships for 
transportation of nuclear cargo have to comply with, in order to ensure safe RAM transport. 
 
3. A MODEL FOR TRACKING RAM IN SEA TRANSPORTATION  
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced the elective Code for Safe 
Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flaks on 
Board ships, or so-called INF Code, in 1993 [3;4]. This Code complements International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations. The INF Code has been adopted in 1999 and 
become mandatory in 2001. It covers ship design, construction and equipment. It also included 
  
advanced safety measures for ships carrying spent fuel, Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel and vitrified 
high-level waste. The requirements for ships carrying nuclear cargo are as follows: 
­ Double hull around cargo holds, plus high resistant structures between hulls; 
­ Hull’s firm anti-collision construction; 
­ Double safety-required equipment for navigation, communication, cargo control and 
monitoring, electrical and cooling systems, so that the second system could be used in the 
case of need; 
­ Satellite navigation, tracking and tracing, so that the ship automatically transmits it position 
in close to real time to a control center; 
­ Extra fire detection and fire fighting equipment including a hold flooding system, so that 
all holds could be completely flooded, while the vessel remains its buoyancy; 
­ Twin engines, rudders and propellers which operate entirely independently; 
­ Bow thrusters to provide higher level of maneuverability at slow speed, etc. 
These purpose-built vessels have been used to transport fissile materials between Japan and 
Europe (United Kingdom and France). They are owned by Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited 
(PNTL), TN International, and a Japanese consortium. PNTL is the most experienced company 
for transportation of nuclear cargo at world scale. Up to now, it has covered more than five 
million miles without an accident. These ships usually have crew that is about two to three times 
larger than crew on chemical tankers of a similar size. Besides, navigating and engineering 
officers commonly hold certificates of competence for a higher rank than the one they serve. 
All PNTL ships meet the international standards and requirements of the relevant authorities 
[16]. In Figure 3 are shown main structural areas of a PNTL ship with a transversal cross-section 
of a nuclear cargo hold. 
Figure 3. Scheme of main structural areas of a PNLT vessel (Source: 
[16]) 
 
 
  
Security is a top priority for ships carrying nuclear materials. Shipments must comply with 
coastal state requirements, as well as physical protection measures developed by the IAEA and 
IMO. Since in the focus of this paper is tracking and tracking RAM via RFID in sea 
transportation, we have tried to make a compilation of results and experiences from ARG-US 
project, and available online literature sources in this domain and propose a framework of an 
appropriate info-communication model (Figure 4). All PNTL ships have satellite navigation 
and weather routing equipment, as well as tracking equipment. Such systems enable these ships 
to follow the safest route and avoid severe weather patterns. Ship’s position is monitored at any 
stage of her voyage. The voyage monitoring system automatically reports the vessel’s latitude 
and longitude, speed and heading every two hours. If a message is not received by the report 
centre within a pre-determined time, PNTL’s emergency response system is automatically 
activated [17]. If a ship accounts difficulty, trained and fully equipped PNTL emergency team 
is 24 hours on stand by to offer assistance. All emergency arrangements are in keeping with 
IAEA regulations [18]. Special monitors in the holds of each PNTL ship would provide 
information about the status of the cargo to a salvage team.  
Figure 4. Model of a nuclear cargo ship’s communication system with 
manned Report Center (Source: Own) 
 
We have assumed that each ship’s cargo hold is treated as a Remote Area Modular Monitoring 
(RAMM) sub-system connected with central monitoring system on board refereeing to AGR-
US project attainments [6;7;8;13;14;15]. A digital video camera or optical sensor might be 
incorporated into each RAMM (RAM cargo hold). The RFID active tags attached to each RAM 
drum’s bolt contains following sensors: temperature, 3-axis digital accelerometer, gamma 
sensor, neutron sensor, electronic loop seal and rechargeable Li-ion battery. All these sensors 
are connected with monitoring system via two-layered network, i.e., via wired Ethernet and 
wireless network for security purposes. Due to [19] ships carrying RAM cargo are fitted with 
  
an automatic voyage monitoring system which transmits detail of the vessel’s position, speed 
and heading to the Report Center (Barrow, UK) every two hours. These transmissions are 
preformed automatically and without any intervention of the crew. If a message was not 
received at the allotted time the Emergency Response System would be activated. Further in 
[19] is stated: “It is probable that the transmission system would be based on, or similar to, the 
widely used Inmarsat C communication system which uses geo-stationary satellites positioned 
over the equator to receive and transmit the data.” As an alternative, one can conjecture that 
Officers on Watch (OoW) and/or Master should monitor and control cargo holds through back-
end info-communication system with the appropriate software architecture and interface. In 
addition, they might be responsible for regular reporting to the Report Center. If we assume 
that VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) is used for this purpose, than the reports should be 
sent via Application Specific Message (ASM) 6 (dangerous cargo indication + following 
communication) to the land based control-report center. The ASM 6 contains the information 
as: MMSI, flag, unit of quantity of dangerous cargo, code under which cargo is carried, BC 
class, IMDG class, and like [20]. Within the context, it is important to emphasize that 
mandatory reporting from ships is usually encapsulated into ASM, while Maritime Service 
Portfolio (MSP) cover a number of Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) related and other services 
[21]. Additionally, possibilities of using Iridium GMDSS [22] should be analyzed in the 
forthcoming research work in this domain. Apart from the proposed model based on the 
assumptions, through further research work some efforts should be made to identify exact 
extraterrestrial communication channel(s) and method(s) of (automatic) reporting, used as a 
bidirectional link between ships carrying nuclear cargo and ground based (control) report 
center(s).  
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The paper proposes a model of communication between a ship carrying nuclear cargo and land 
based control center in sea transportation. The model is based on the experiences from ARG-
US project being realized during ten years period (2008-2018) in Argonne National Laboratory 
(Chicago, Illinois, USA). Conceiving and designing a model has been supported by PNLT 
information available on their official website. After an extensive search of the web, it can be 
concluded that online literature sources in this field are scarce. Further investigation should go 
in two directions: (a) exploring data transfer between sealed and tagged RAM drums and 
monitoring system on board ship, and (b) exploring in more detail communications between 
the ship carrying nuclear cargo and (control) report center ashore. Due to the lack of available 
information, we can only assume which form of data exchange and which communication 
channels are used. We have conjectured that ASM 6 reporting method within VDES might be 
used, but it might be also Inmarsat C, Iridium GMDSS, or some other extraterrestrial 
communication mode for providing safety and security at sea. This is to be explored in some 
more detail through the following research work.
