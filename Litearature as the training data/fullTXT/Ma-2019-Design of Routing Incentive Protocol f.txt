Abstract. The global commercialization of satellites has intensified, and the
types and numbers of new spacecrafts have increased year by year. However,
the repeated functional construction and “islandization” characteristics of
spacecraft severely restrict the use efficiency of space resources. How to realize
the open interconnection and self-adaptation optimization cooperation of satel-
lite resources and encourage more and more on-orbit spacecrafts to share spatial
data services and routing resources is a severe challenge for the new generation
space network communication protocol. This paper builds the Incentive Protocol
of Routing based on the TCP/IP protocol family under the CCSDS spatial
communication protocol standard framework. Using blockchain distributed
database technology and consensus mechanism, combined with routing flow
identification technology, design, and implement a network route incentive
protocol and game model based on spacecraft route contribution proof con-
sensus mechanism, intended to provide a feasible technical framework and
feasible solution for the construction of the integrated digital intelligent eco-
nomic ecology of the world.

1 Introduction
With the intensification of the global commercialization of satellites, the types and
numbers of new research spacecraft have increased year by year. Under the existing
spacecraft development and launch system, the repeated construction of the load
function and the isolation feature of “islandization” are widespread, and there is
undoubtedly serious restriction and waste on the use of near-Earth space resources.
Therefore, in order to realize the open interconnection and adaptive optimization of
satellite resources, and encourage more on-orbit spacecraft to share spatial data services
and routing resources, higher requirements are put forward for the new generation
satellite network communication protocol [1–3].

(1) Openness: Any on-orbit spacecraft which belong to different organizations and
types can be freely joined or withdrawn from the network without the permission
of a third party, subject to the corresponding technical specifications and
conditions.
(2) Standardization: A common protocol family architecture should be adopted to
maximize the integration of compatible satellite standards and ground Internet
communication protocols to achieve integration of space and ground network.
(3) Self-driven: The networking protocol should have a built-in economic model,
which can independently optimize the scheduling space routing resources, and
encourage spacecraft to share data services: quantify the value of data services and
routing resources contributed by in-orbit spacecraft, and Real-time clearing of
data services and routing resources provided by the orbiting spacecraft.
(4) Security: Using mature digital signature and encryption algorithm, under the open
information transmission system, data encryption transmission and confirmation
are realized, and a peer-to-peer security information transmission network is
constructed to serve the settlement system.
(5) Neutrality: The space network will serve as a public infrastructure that is not
owned and controlled by any single or a small number of institutions and indi-
viduals. It will treat the information content of the space network fairly and
provide relay and transmission services without review and distinction.
2 Protocol Technology Architecture
In addition to the basic communication functions, the spatial networking protocol
quantifies the contribution value of the routing resources (connectivity, transmission
data volume, and propagation delay) provided by the spacecraft in the spatial data
communication service by the incentive protocol. The identification of the routing
information of the space information flow through the spacecraft node is effectively
identified and counted, and broadcasted to the entire network in real time. The ground
verification node is then responsible for collecting and verifying the broadcast routing
information, recording it in the blockchain data book in a distributed competitive
accounting manner, and completing the real-time clearing and reward distribution of
the spatial network data service and routing resources. The network incentive protocol
encourages spacecraft individuals to share data services and routing resources by
constructing an economic game model, thereby optimizing the use efficiency of spatial
network routing resources.
The incentive protocol architecture is mainly divided into three subsystems:
(1) Information Routing Flow Identification Subsystem: completes the routing infor-
mation identification and statistics of the TCP/IP format exchange distribution infor-
mation flow between space network spacecraft nodes, and broadcasts to the whole
network. (2) Distributed Verification Subsystem: The local verification node checks the
broadcast data of the information flow by competing accounting, and stores it in the
Distributed File Storage System of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and the corre-
sponding IPFS index. The hash value is used for blockchain accounting processing [4].

(3) Self-adaptive optimization scheduling subsystem: The space data service request will
divide the real-time priority according to the amount of the additional certificate bonus
when it is initiated, and the spatial routing node will give priority to the service of the
higher data service request for the certificate. In this subsystem, an economic benefit
coordination and game model with positive feedback mechanism is constructed. When
each routing node participant adopts the strategic behavior of maximizing its own
interests, the utilization efficiency of the entire space network will be optimal (Fig. 1).
2.1 Information Flow Route Identification
A set of information flows is a set of single-item packets between a given source node
and a destination node. Both source and destination nodes are defined by the address of
the network layer and the port of the transport layer. The incentive protocol records and
analyzes the network traffic information based on the flow network packet exchange
technology, distributes the information according to the service request priority, and
collects and broadcasts the routing information of each node in real time. This process
is divided into two steps
(1) Data exchange and distribution according to the optimal use efficiency of the
routing performance of the own node and the priority order of the transfer target
data. The prioritization can be expressed as the amount of the token attached that
the user is willing to pay when requesting the service.
(2) After the data transmission is completed, the distribution data stream is collected
and broadcast to the entire network. The broadcast statistics include: the incentive
layer protocol version number, the source port IP address, the source port ID
(public key address), the target port IP, Target port ID (public key address), data
transfer amount, transfer start and end time stamp, and stream ID.

2.2 Distributed Consensus Synchronization
The distributed consensus subsystem is mainly responsible for verifying and storing the
information flow identification data of the broadcast, and forming the consensus of the
whole network and recording it in the blockchain ledger. Considering the operating
costs, the verification node body is generally composed of a ground network computer.
After the verification node verifies the routing information broadcast by the space
routing incentive protocol, the route contribution value of each spacecraft routing node
in the data service is converted, packaged, and stored in the IPFS (InterPlanetary File
System, IPFS) distribution. In the data sharing system, the index hash address of the
packet in the IPFS is stored in the blockchain data book as the workload of the routing
node to obtain the certificate revenue.
The information packed by the verification node includes not limited to the fol-
lowing contents: (1) digital signature of the source node, the destination node and the
relay node in the transmission service; (2) transmission time stamp of each node;
(3) data transmission amount; (4) The data packet hash value of each node; (5) The
verification result of the data service correctness of the destination node at the time of
service termination. The process of verifying the routing of the routing information by
the node is as follows (Fig. 2).
Considering that it is expensive to store data for blockchain, only the IPFS index
hash address corresponding to the key data is stored in the blockchain ledger, and the
complete data content is stored in the IPFS system. The IPFS system is based on a
globally distributed peer-to-peer encryption storage protocol. Any node can only store
one fragmented content of a complete file, and each fragment is backed up in multiple
IPFS storage nodes, and only the complete index hash address is obtained [5, 6]. In
order to collect all the file fragments and extract the complete file. Therefore, the
scheme design of adopting such index address winding can not only ensure the security

of data storage, but also save construction cost and improve the running efficiency of
the entire system.
The generation of a block will package the following information: (1) The hash
address of the collected and verified information flow during the period; (2) The
transaction information between the collected and verified accounts during the period;
(3) Block Generate timestamp information; (4) Incentive protocol version number;
(5) Block height; (6) Previous block hash value. Therefore, the ground verification
node is a non-tamperable high-performance chained distributed storage database [7, 8]
(Fig. 3).
2.3 Self-adaptive Optimization Scheduling
The implementation of the self-adaptive optimization scheduling subsystem relies on
constructing a credible economic model that can coordinate the interests of all parties
and has a positive feedback incentive effect. The incentive agreement involves three
parties: the space routing node, the ground verification node, and the user. The con-
structor of the spatial network service is mainly composed of the spatial routing node
and the verification node: the spatial routing node forms a spatial network to provide

collects and verifies the routing contribution of routing nodes in the spatial data service.
Value and inter-account transaction information, store key information and generate a
blockchain transaction book that cannot be tampered with. The user holds a certain
amount of pass and enjoys a certain share of the space network, and can use the pass to
purchase data services or increase the priority of service requests.

The economic incentive model is designed as follows: The pass name used to
measure the space data service of the whole network is the Satdomain, shorthand:
Sado, which characterizes the holder of the Sado to enjoy the use of the routing
resources of the space network. The initial circulation of Sado is 20,000,000, the final
circulation is 200,000,000, the full issuance period is 45–106 years, and the annual
issuance limit is 2–5%. The annual Sado issuance rate is based on the growth rate of the
total service value of the previous year. The full issuance period is 45–106 years. The
additional issuance amount is used to reward the contribution of the space routing node
and the verification node as the infrastructure.
The following economic indicators are defined for the entire network:
(1) GSSPj: Gross Spacenetwork Service Product AD j.
GSSPj¼

Hopij �MBij ð1Þ
mj The total number of information flow routing services provided by the whole
network in AD j.
Hopij the number of hops of the i-th space routing data service in AD j.
MBij The data transmission volume of the i-th space routing data service in AD j.
(2) Pj: The growth rate of GSSP in the previous year compared to the previous year in
AD j.
(3) Sj: The total amount of Sado basic certificate issued in AD j.
(4) △Sj: New circulation of Sado in AD j.
The following design for the entire network Sado distribution and rewards.
The Sado characterizes the use of space network data services. In order to maintain
the stability of the Sado currency, the increase in the total amount of Sado’s issuance
should always be consistent with the growth of GSSP (Gross spacenetwork service
production). The total value of the default space network service will reach saturation
in 106 years, that is, the Sado circulation will reach no increase after the number of 200
million issuance. During this issuance, the annual new circulation of Sado is always
issued according to △Sj (when △Sj meets the conditions: 2% < △ Sj < 5%), the
current year GSSPj−1 growth rate △ Pj−1 is also in the range of 2–5%, then in the
current year Sado new circulation
DSj ¼ DPj�1 � Sj�1 ð2Þ
The increase in the total value of the space network service is due to the expansion of
the scale of the service provider’s space routing node and the verification node and the
improvement of the efficiency. Therefore, the issued Sado is used for proportional
rewards and routing nodes and verification nodes. 95% of the new circulation is awarded
to the routing node. 5% of the new circulation is awarded to the verification node. In

addition to this, the routing node and the verification node will also obtain a transaction
reward for the user’s additional payment.
