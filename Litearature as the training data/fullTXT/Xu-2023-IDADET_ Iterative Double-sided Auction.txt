Abstract—In the era of big data, the unprecedented growth of
data has been regarded as an important asset and the commercial
application of data acquisition markets has emerged accordingly.
With the advancement of vehicle manufacturing and sensor
technologies, a large amount of data can be collected and stored
in electric vehicles (EV), making the data acquisition scenario
gradually extend to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and thus the
corresponding operational rules and economic feasibility need
to be fully investigated there. In this paper, we focus on a
general IoV-oriented data acquisition market that consists of
a data center, multiple EVs, multiple roadside units (RSUs),
and a market operator (broker), with the objective of social
welfare maximization (SWM) by identifying the optimal data task
allocation. However, due to the inherent information asymmetry
and fragmentation in such a market, it is not feasible to solve
the SWM problem directly. To this end, we propose an iterative
double-sided auction (IDA) mechanism, which leverages the self-
interested feature of RSUs and EVs to decompose the SWM
problem, enabling every participant to make decisions in a
distributed manner under the broker’s coordination. A complete
set of operational rules covering the data task allocation, bidding,
payment, and reimbursement are elaborately designed to achieve
SWM, and energy is adopted as the pricing “currency”, such that
an IDA-based Data-Energy Transaction (IDADET) ecosystem is
established in IoV. We verify the economic feasibility of the
proposed IDADET ecosystem by showing its convergence and
desirable properties of individual rationality, budget balance,
incentive compatibility, and economic efficiency. In addition, con-
sidering the psychological effects of practical market participants,
we make amendments to the operational rules of the IDADET
ecosystem from the behavioral economics perspective, aiming
to ensure its long-term well-functioning. Extensive numerical

I. INTRODUCTION
THE rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT)
has led to the upgrade of traditional vehicular ad hoc
networks to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) [1]–[3]. IoV is
considered to carry tremendous research value and commercial
interest, and thereby attracting increasing attention from both
academic and industrial communities [4], [5]. With the ad-
vancement of vehicle manufacturing and sensor technologies,
vehicles in IoV are equipped with various sensors with com-
puting and storing capabilities, and are therefore able to collect
and store extensive data. Meanwhile, with the assistance of
5G/B5G communications and cloud computing, large-scale
IoT data transmission can be easily realized. In this context,
massive data contained in IoV are regarded as an important
asset, and the data acquisition there has become an emerging
business model that benefits commercial entities and creates
new revenue streams for Internet enterprises [6].
On one hand, as more and more sensors are equipped in
modern vehicles, the amount of data generated from moni-
toring both the on-road and in-vehicle status is significantly
rising. This explosive growth of generated vehicular data,
along with the increasing data demands from data platforms
and users, has resulted in a tremendous potential for data
transactions in IoV [7]. On the other hand, due to real-
time changes in the geographic location, moving vehicles can
implement data transactions with multiple participating entities
while driving, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside
unit (RSU), and vehicle-to-agent [8], [9]. As a result, there is
an urgent need to establish a data acquisition market with well-
refined operational procedures and rules that enable massive
and efficient data transactions in IoV.
By now, some preliminary works have been done to explore
the development of data acquisition markets and the design of
data transaction mechanisms. For instance, Yu et al. [10] intro-
duced a brokerage-based market, in which participants propose
their selling and buying quantities to the trading platform
that matches the market supply and demand, and developed a

prospect theory model from behavioral economics to analyze
the users’ realistic trading behaviors. Liu et al. [11] proposed a
blockchain-enhanced data market framework to support secure
and efficient IoT data trading, and formulated a two-stage
Stackelberg game to solve the pricing and purchasing problem
between the data consumer and the market agency. Lin et
al. [12] developed a consortium blockchain for secure and
efficient knowledge management and trading, and applied the
non-cooperative game to design a knowledge pricing strategy
with incentives for the market. Nguyen et al. [13] proposed a
benchmarking framework for evaluating data trading protocol-
s, and analyzed the communication efficiency of three basic
IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms
of latency and energy consumption.
A. Motivation and Contributions
Although the above existing works represent brilliant
progress in the study of data acquisition markets, they are
not dedicatedly designed for and therefore do not match well
IoV. In particular, information asymmetry is a key feature
of data markets in IoV, that is, a market participant cannot
fully know others’ information such as willingness and utili-
ties. Therefore, under the insufficient and asymmetric market
information, how to design the operational procedures for a
data acquisition market in IoV as well as the operational rules
to regulate the behaviors of market participants, is a great
challenge and remains largely uninvestigated. Meanwhile, to
realize the practical commercialization of the proposed data
acquisition market in IoV, its economic feasibility must also
be fully demonstrated.
Motivated by the above statements, in this paper, we explore
the design of a general data acquisition market oriented
towards IoV, in which mobile vehicles roaming in a wide area
gather data by equipped sensors, and randomly deployed RSUs
work as data exchange stations to acquire data from passing
vehicles and then deliver data to a data center over base
stations. Our goal is to achieve social welfare maximization
(SWM) for the data acquisition market in IoV under the
information asymmetry constraint. To this end, we develop
an iterative double-sided auction (IDA) mechanism, which
is able to encourage market participants to gradually report
their truthful information and incentivizes vehicles to exchange
data by issuing reimbursements. Note that along with the
global trend of low-carbon living, alternative fuel vehicles,
especially electric vehicles (EVs), are becoming mainstream
in the automotive market [14], and electrical energy is the
most essential resource for EVs. Hence, we consider the IoV
composed of EVs and use energy as the reimbursements
for EVs to perform data acquisition tasks, thus establish-
ing an IDA-based data-energy transaction ecosystem in IoV.
Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses for the economic
feasibility of the proposed ecosystem and make amendments
to the operational rules according to market participants’
psychological behaviors.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• Novel IoV-oriented Data-Energy Transaction Ecosystem
Design: To the best of our knowledge, for the emerg-
ing IoV and the potentially huge data assets therein,
this work is the first to develop a novel data energy
transaction ecosystem with the goal of maximizing total
social welfare, named IDADET. To cope with the market
information asymmetry, we apply the idea of IDA to
design the transaction mechanism, which enables RSUs
and EVs to make decisions in a distributed manner under
a broker’s coordination. Correspondingly, a complete set
of operational rules are elaborately formulated to regulate
entities’ interactions, including data allocation, bidding,
and pricing. Therefore, this work can be considered a
new and appropriate application of IDA in an emerging
area, and the comparative results indicate that the IDA
mechanism does have advantages in terms of convergence
and social welfare.
• Economic Feasibility Analysis: We show the convergence
of the IDA mechanism by proving it converges to the
unique solution to the market SWM problem. We also
prove the IDADET ecosystem satisfies the desirable eco-
nomic properties of individual rationality, incentive com-
patibility, economic efficiency, and budget balance. These
theoretical analyses demonstrate the economic feasibility
of the IDADET ecosystem in IoV.
• Behavioral Economics-based Amendment: We further
consider the phenomenon that the psychological behav-
iors of participants have effects on the data acquisition
market, which may occur in the real world. Accord-
ingly, we make amendments to the operational rules of
the IDADET ecosystem from the behavioral economics
perspective. We identify appropriate additional energy
reimbursements that grant to EVs to compensate for their
psychological loss during continuous data collection task
implementation, so as to guarantee the long-term well-
functioning of the IDADET ecosystem.
B. Paper Organization
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
introduce related work in Section II. Section III describes
the system model and problem formulation. The IDADET
ecosystem is established in Section IV. We verify the eco-
nomic feasibility of the IDADET ecosystem in Section V and
make amendments to the IDA mechanism from the behavioral
economics perspective in Section VI. Section VII presents the
numerical results, followed by the conclusion in Section VIII.
II. RELATED WORK
Data has become an important asset in the current era of big
data. Many existing studies have demonstrated the feasibility
of data transaction implementation, based on which the issues
such as data transaction mechanism design and data trans-
action pricing have been widely investigated [15]. In recent
years, IoT provides a class of typical application scenarios for
data transactions and has been attracting increasing academic
attention [16]–[19]. Specially, Jung et al. [16] investigated
the responsibilities of consumers in the dataset trading and
designed a set of accountable protocols to secure the big data
transaction environment, achieving book-keeping ability and
accountability against dishonest consumers with misbehaviors.

Taking into account the characteristics of data consumers and
data providers as well as the conflict between data privacy and
data exploitation, Oh et al. [17] applied the non-cooperative
game model to develop a competitive data transaction scheme
with privacy valuation for multiple stakeholders in IoT data
markets. In [18], Zheng et al. proposed a profit-driven data
acquisition framework for crowd-sensed data markets, which
is composed of two complementary mechanisms for prof-
it maximization and for payment minimization respectively.
The architecture design problem of the mobile crowd-sensed
data market was investigated in [19], where a reward shar-
ing scheme was developed to incentivize data providers to
contribute data according to some fairness criteria, and an
online query-based data pricing mechanism was designed to
determine the trading price of crowd-sensed data and guarantee
both arbitrage-freeness and a constant competitive ratio in
terms of profit maximization.
More recently, by formulating the interactions between the
mobile operator and users in the data trading market as a
three-stage Stackelberg game, Yu et al. [20] studied the users’
operator selection and trading decisions and analyzed the
operator’s profit-maximizing strategy. In [21], a framework for
data trading over the internet of artificially intelligent things
was established, where the security and pricing issues were in-
vestigated, and a data trading strategy was proposed to jointly
maintain the model performance and the budget consumption.
Zhang et al. [22] proposed a smart contract-based quality-
driven incentive mechanism for secure data sharing among IoT
devices with limited resources, where a two-layer Stackelberg
game of nested coalitional scheme was designed to realize the
maximum overall social welfare. By designing a two-phase
sampling-based algorithm and two types of pricing strategies
for different data trading circumstances, Cai et al. [23] studied
the range counting trading for IoT data with the objective
of preserving the privacy of data contributors. The problem
of trustworthy data sharing in two-stage industrial IoTs was
investigated in [24], where two scenarios were considered
based on the availability of prior knowledge on devices, and
three device allocation algorithms were designed to guarantee
the total scales of data per round while achieving the fairness
among devices and system owners.
Since blockchain technology has been gradually contribut-
ing to the improvement of data transaction markets, some
works exploring blockchain-based data trading in IoT can be
found in the literature. For example, with the help of the smart
contract technique, Zhao et al. [25] proposed a blockchain-
based fair data trading protocol for the big data market, which
combines ring signature, double- authentication-preventing
signature, and similarity learning to guarantee the availability
of trading data, the privacy of data providers, and fairness be-
tween data providers and consumers. To mitigate limitations in
conventional data trading markets with dishonest buyers/data
brokers, Dai et al. [26] established a new blockchain-based
ecosystem, by introducing a paradigm shift where a buyer
obtains the result of the data analysis rather than the actual
dataset, using blockchain to allow the tracing of unauthorized
transactional modifications, and building a secure contract
execution environment to protect the source data and the
analysis result. In [27], based on blockchain technology, a
privacy-preserving incentive private data sharing scheme was
constructed for IoT, to realize the behavior profile-building
prevention and non-frameability and ensure the flexible ac-
cess control of multi-sharing. Liu et al. [28] developed a
transparent data marketing architecture with the cloud as a
data management unit and the consortium blockchain as a
reliable controller, which achieves consortium management
and executable fairness in the cloud-based marketing model
with a distributed committee.
With the advancement of wireless communications and sen-
sor technologies, a large amount of data is collected and stored
in electric vehicles (EV), which makes the data transaction
scenario gradually extend to the context of the Internet of
Vehicles (IoV). The commodity value of data will bring new
value attributes to EVs, and therefore, the data transaction in
IoV has become a new research focus in recent years. Liu et
al. [9] used blockchain technology to propose a secure and de-
centralized data transaction system and designed a debit-credit
mechanism to support efficient data trading in IoV, where
a two-stage Stackelberg game was formulated to maximize
the profits of borrowing and lending vehicles jointly. In [29],
Lu et al. developed a federated learning-based data-sharing
architecture to relieve transmission load and address privacy
concerns of providers in IoV, where a hybrid model consisting
of the permissioned blockchain and the local directed acyclic
graph is used to enhance security and reliability, and an
asynchronous federated learning scheme for node selection
was proposed to improve efficiency. Sadiq et al. [30] adopted
consortium blockchain to maintain transparency and trust in
data and energy trading activities in IoV, where smart contracts
were utilized to tackle trading disputes and illegal actions,
and an elliptic curve bilinear pairing-based digital signature
scheme was developed to ensure data reliability and integrity.
In [31], Chai et al. proposed a hierarchical blockchain-enabled
federated learning algorithm for knowledge sharing in large-
scale IoV, where the knowledge sharing was modeled as a
trading market process to stimulate sharing behaviors, and the
hierarchical federated learning algorithm is designed to meet
the distributed pattern and privacy requirement of IoV. Zou et
al. [32] developed a regional federated learning framework for
knowledge trading in IoV, where a reputation mechanism was
designed to measure the reliability of participating vehicles,
and a blockchain-enhanced trading scheme along with a non-
cooperative game-based pricing strategy was proposed to
ensure an authorized market agency coordinates the trading
quickly.
It is worth noting that this work is distinguishable from
the existing ones in the sense that we fully consider the
information asymmetry in the practical IoV-oriented data
acquisition market, and elaborately design an iterative double-
sided auction mechanism with a complete set of operational
rules covering the resource allocation, bidding, payment, and
reimbursement, so as to establish a data-energy transaction
ecosystem in IoV with provable decent economic properties.
In addition, we investigate the psychological effects of market
participants from the behavioral economics perspective, and
make amendments to the operational rules to achieve the long-

III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we first introduce the system model of the
IoV-oriented data acquisition market, and then formulate the
social welfare maximization problem with the consideration
of both EVs and RSUs.
A. IoV-oriented Data Acquisition Market
As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider a data acquisition
market in a wide-area IoV, which is composed of a data
center, multiple roadside units (RSUs), and multiple electric
vehicles (EVs). Base stations serve as the information infras-
tructure to provide wide-area data communication services. Let
M = {1, · · · ,M} and N = {1, · · · , N} denote the sets of
RSUs and EVs, respectively, where M and N are the numbers
of RSUs and EVs in the IoV. With the help of base stations,
the data center can release a series of data collection tasks
to RSUs and EVs in a broadcasting way. Each EV roaming
in the wide-area IoV gathers data from the sensors carried in
itself and extracts valid data to meet the data collection task
demands. RSUs are deployed randomly in different regions
of the IoV, which work as data exchange stations to acquire
data from passing EVs in a way of D2D communications
by adopting short-range wireless communication technologies.
Then, RSUs deliver data to the data center over the information
infrastructure provided by the base stations.
For a data collection task undertaken by RSU m ∈ M, let
xm,n denote the percentage of data that RSU m expects to
receive from EV n ∈ N , and yn,m denote the percentage
of data that EV n is willing to offer RSU m. Then, the
data request matrix of the whole market, denoted by X , is
expressed as
X , (xm : ∀m ∈M) = (xm,n : ∀m ∈M, ∀n ∈ N ) , (1)
and the data offer matrix of the whole market, denoted by Y ,
is expressed as
Y , (yn : ∀n ∈ N ) = (yn,m : ∀n ∈ N , ∀m ∈M) . (2)

Fig. 2. Trends of RSU’s payoff function and EV’s cost function.
Let Fm(xm) denote the payoff function of RSU m by
acquiring data vector xm from EVs. Obviously, Fm(xm) is
a positive and increasing function of the data request vector
xm and satisfies Fm(0) = 0, in accordance with the fact that
the more data acquired, the more benefits can be achieved. In
addition, note that “diminishing marginal returns” is a generic
economic law reflecting the phenomenon that the benefits from
gaining an item when there is nothing are greater than the
benefits from gaining the same item when there are already
a lot of possessions. To make the payoff function conform to
the law of “diminishing marginal returns”, Fm(xm) should be
strictly concave in xm. On the other hand, implementing data
collection tasks will cost EVs in terms of power, computing
resources, and so on. Let Cn(yn) denote the cost function of
EV n by offering data vector yn to RSUs, which is positive,
increasing, and satisfies Cn(0) = 0. Moreover, we assume
the cost function conforms to the generic economic law of
“increasing marginal costs” and thus Cn(yn) is strictly convex
in yn, which captures the fact that as the offered data by
an EV increases, its operation cost for gathering one more
unit of data increases, since the EV has to roam a wider area
for gathering data, and meanwhile there are fewer remaining
resources for extracting and maintaining valid data. Fig. 2
shows the trends of payoff function Fm(xm) of RSU m and
cost function Cn(yn) of EV n.
Remark 1. The economic laws of “diminishing marginal re-
turns” and “increasing marginal costs” are commonly applied
in data trading markets, for example, [12], [17]. Note that here
we only stipulate these two economic laws for the payment
function and cost function, without restricting the specific
function expressions, which indicates that the ecosystem and
scheme developed in the work are universally applicable. In
the simulations, we will specify the expressions of the payoff
function and cost function as case studies. As introduced
later, our objective is to maximize the social welfare of
the whole market, which is the difference between the total
payoffs and the total costs. The assumption of “diminishing
marginal returns” and “increasing marginal costs” implies that
a worst-case is considered, and thus the proposed solution can
guarantee an achievable lower bound for the market social
welfare.

B. Problem Formulation
Clearly, the objectives of RSUs and EVs are intrinsically
conflicting with each other. On one hand, RSUs expect to
obtain as much data as possible to achieve a higher payoff. On
the other hand, EVs tend to collect less data to save their cost.
If they decide unilaterally how much data to request and to
offer, it is impossible to reach an agreement. To this end, there
is a need for a market operator, who works as a broker to help
coordinate the interactions among RSUs and EVs, ensuring
that the market operates efficiently.
In the IoV-oriented data acquisition market, social welfare is
the aggregate utility of all involved entities and thus represents
the market’s operational efficiency. Specifically, let S(X,Y )
denote the social welfare, which is the difference between the
total payoff of RSUs and the total cost of EVs, given by
S(X,Y ) =
M∑
m=1
Fm(xm)−
N∑

Cn(yn). (3)
To improve the market’s operational efficiency, the broker
needs to undertake the task of maximizing social welfare
by negotiating appropriate data request matrix X and data
offer matrix Y . Thus, the social welfare maximization (SWM)
problem for the broker can be formulated as
SWM: max

xm,n ≤ yn,m, ∀n ∈ N ,∀m ∈M, (4c)
yn,m ≥ 0, xm,n ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N ,∀m ∈M, (4d)
where constraint (4c) indicates that the data amount supplied
by each EV should satisfy the corresponding data amount
requested by the RSU. Note that the objective function of
the SWM problem is strictly concave and the constraint set
is compact and convex. Hence, the SWM problem admits a
unique optimal solution that can be characterized by using the
necessary and sufficient Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condi-
tions.
Specifically, we relax constraints (4b) and (4c) and define
the Lagrangian function of the SWM problem as follows:

where λ , (λn ≥ 0 : ∀n ∈ N ) is the Lagrange multiplier
vector corresponding to constraints (4b), and µ , (µm,n ≥
0 : ∀m ∈ M,∀n ∈ N ) is the Lagrange multiplier matrix
corresponding to constraints (4c). Then, the KKT conditions
of the SWM problem that yield the optimal primal variables
X∗ and Y ∗ and the optimal dual variables λ∗ and µ∗ are
given by the following set of equations:
∂Fm(x∗m)
∂x∗m,n
− µ∗m,n = 0, (6a)
∂Cn(y∗n)

λ∗n ≥ 0, µ∗m,n ≥ 0, x∗m,n ≥ 0, y∗n,m ≥ 0. (6e)
According to (6a) and (6b), the optimal solutions of xm,n and
yn,m satisfy 
∂Fm(x∗m,n)
∂x∗m,n
= µ∗m,n, (7a)
∂Cn(y∗n,m)
y∗n,m
= (µ∗m,n − λ∗n). (7b)
However, it is infeasible for the broker to derive the optimal
solution to the SWM problem by solving (6a)-(6e) directly,
due to the information asymmetry in the IoV-oriented data
acquisition market. Specifically, the RSU payoff function
set {Fm(xm),∀m ∈ M} and the EV cost function set
{Cn(yn),∀n ∈ N} are local information for RSUs and EVs,
respectively, and the broker cannot be aware of such infor-
mation. To eliminate this lack of information, it is necessary
to design an incentive mechanism for the broker to encourage
RSUs and EVs to report their truthful data request amount and
data offer amount, respectively.
IV. IDA-BASED DATA-ENERGY TRANSACTION
ECOSYSTEM DESIGN
In this section, we design an iterative double-sided auction
(IDA for short) mechanism to solve the SWM problem in the
IoV-oriented data acquisition market, which is a powerful mea-
sure to deal with information asymmetry. The basic principle
of IDA is to leverage the self-interested feature of RSUs and
EVs, and decompose the original market operation problem
such that RSUs and EVs can make decisions in a distributed
manner under the broker’s mild coordination. Specifically, the
broker solves an alternative optimization problem to determine
X and Y (called allocation rule), which is combined with
appropriate pricing rules (i.e., payments for RSUs and reim-
bursements for EVs) so as to achieve the optimal solution
to the original SWM problem. This mechanism corresponds
to a double-sided auction facilitated by the broker, where
multiple buyers (RSUs) and multiple sellers (EVs) interact
in an iterative manner to adjust their bids until the market
reaches an optimal and feasible point. Note that in IoV
scenarios, energy is the most essential resource for EVs and
the function of energy supply can be integrated into RSUs.
Therefore, we adopt energy as the “currency” of payments
and reimbursements in the IDA mechanism, establishing a
data-energy transaction ecosystem in IoV. In the following, we

elaborate on the allocation rule, the optimal pricing rules, and
the implementation of the IDA-based data-energy transaction
ecosystem, sequentially.
A. Allocation Rule
The IDA mechanism comprises the following two steps in
each iteration.
Step I: Each RSU m ∈ M submits a bid um,n ≥ 0 for
each EV n ∈ N to the broker, implying the data it expects to
exchange. Similarly, each EV n ∈ N submits a bid vm,n ≥ 0
for each RSU m ∈ M to the broker, which reflects its cost
for collecting data. We define the bid vector um for RSU m
and the bid vector vn for EV n as follows:
um , (um,n : ∀n ∈ N ), (8)
vn , (vn,m : ∀m ∈M). (9)
The bids will be utilized as the inputs during the allocation
procedure at Stage II, and to further determine the actual
payments of RSUs and reimbursements of EVs.
Step II: By following the previous studies on network
utility maximization, e.g., [33], [34], we employ a logarith-
mic function along with a quadratic function to design the
allocation rule, which can capture the concave and convex
increasing properties of the RSU’s payoff function and the
EV’s cost function, respectively. Specifically, after receiving
the bid vectors (um : ∀m ∈M) and (vn : ∀n ∈ N ) from both
two sides, the broker determines the data request/offer matrices
by solving the following broker’s allocation (BA) problem:
BA: max
X,Y
M∑
m=1
N∑
n=1
(um,nlnxm,n −

xm,n ≤ yn,m, ∀n ∈ N ,∀m ∈M, (10c)
yn,m ≥ 0, xm,n ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N ,∀m ∈M. (10d)
Note that the BA problem possesses the same constraint set
as the SWM problem but has a different yet strictly concave
objective function, so it admits a unique optimal solution.
Then, we define the corresponding Lagrange function of the
BA problem as
L2(λ,µ,X,Y ) =

(11)
The KKT conditions that yield the optimal primal variables
X† and Y † and the optimal dual variables λ† and µ† are
given by the following set of equations:
um,n
x†m,n
− µ†m,n = 0, (12a)

λ†n ≥ 0, µ†m,n ≥ 0, x†m,n ≥ 0, y†n,m ≥ 0. (12e)
According to conditions in (12a) and (12b), we have the
allocation rules for two sides as
x†m,n =
um,n
µ†m,n
, (13a)
y†n,m =
µ†m,n − λ†n
vn,m
. (13b)
B. Optimal Pricing Rules
Comparing the KKT conditions (6a)-(6e) with (12a)-(12e),
we can note that the BA problem has the same optimal solution
as the SWM problem, i.e., X† = X∗ and Y † = Y ∗, if
the submitted bids from RSUs and EVs satisfy the following
equations: 
um,n = x†m,n
∂Fm(x†m)
∂x†m,n
, (14a)
vn,m =
1
y†n,m
∂Cn(y†n)
∂y†n,m
. (14b)
In consequence, the broker should design appropriate pricing
rules, i.e., the payment rule for RSUs and the reimbursement
rule for EVs, which are capable of inducing RSUs and
EVs to submit bids following expressions (14a) and (14b),
respectively.
We first investigate the behavior of RSUs as bidders. Let
Pm(xm) denote the payments required to be paid by RSU
m to the broker if RSU m receives data xm from EVs. It
is worth noting that in the IDA mechanism, the data vector
xm is not requested by RSU m directly, but is determined
based on the bid from RSU m as well as the allocation
rule (13a). The payment rule Pm(xm) is carried out by the
broker and each RSU only needs to find its optimal bid vector
um to maximize its own utility, i.e., payoff minus payments.
Specifically, each RSU m solves the following RSU’s utility
maximization (RUM) problem:
RUM: max
um
Fm(xm)− Pm(xm), (15a)
s.t. um,n ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N . (15b)
By setting the first-order derivative of the objective func-
tion (15a) with respect to um,n to be 0 and applying the

allocation rule (13a), we can derive that the optimal solution
of the RUM problem satisfies
∂Pm(xm)
∂um,n
=
∂Fm(xm)
∂xm,n
· ∂xm,n
∂um,n
=
∂Fm(xm)
∂xm,n

. (16)
Moreover, to achieve the maximal social welfare, RSU m
should submits the bid according to (14a). Then, by substi-
tuting (14a) into (16) we have
∂Pm(xm)
∂um,n
=
1
µ†m,n
· um,n
xm,n
= 1. (17)
Therefore, the payment rule that requires RSU m to pay the
broker is determined as
Pm(um) =
N∑
n=1
um,n. (18)
We next check the behavior of EVs as bidders. Let Qn(yn)
denote the reimbursements provided by the broker to EV n if
EV n exchanges data vector yn to RSUs. Similarly, here the
data vector yn is determined based on the bid from EV n and
the allocation rule (13b). The reimbursement rule Qn(yn) is
implemented by the broker and each EV only needs to find
its optimal bid vector vn to maximize its own utility, i.e.,
reimbursements minus cost. Specifically, each EV n solves
the following EV’s utility maximization (EUM) problem:
EUM: max
vn
Qn(yn)− Cn(yn), (19a)
s.t. vn,m ≥ 0,∀m ∈M. (19b)
By setting the first-order derivative of the objective func-
tion (19a) with respect to vn,m to be 0 and applying the
allocation rule (13b), we can derive that the optimal solution
of the EUM problem satisfies
∂Qn(yn)
∂vn,m
=
∂Cn(yn)
∂yn,m
· ∂yn,m
∂vn,m
= − ∂Cn(yn)
∂yn,m
·
µ†m,n − λ†n
(vn,m)2
.
(20)
To achieve the maximal social welfare, EV n should submits
the bid according to (14b). Then, by substituting (14b) into
(20) we have
∂Qn(yn)
∂vn,m
= −vn,myn,m
µ†m,n − λ†n
(vn,m)2
= −
(µ†m,n − λ†n)2
(vn,m)2
.
(21)
Therefore, the reimbursement rule that requires the broker to
pay EV n is given by
Qn(vn) =
M∑
m=1
(µ†m,n − λ†n)2
vn,m
=
M∑
m=1
yn,m(µ†m,n − λ†n).

C. Implementation of IDA-based Data-Energy Transaction
Ecosystem
By applying the allocation rules (13a)-(13b) as well as
the payment rule (18) and the reimbursement rule (22), the
RSUs and EVs can calculate their optimal bids and the
broker can achieve the market equilibrium for social welfare
maximization in one round, if they know the complete market

information including RSUs’ payoff functions and EVs’ cost
functions. However, due to the information asymmetry, an
iterative algorithm is required to gradually adjust the market
operation point to converge to the desirable one.
The procedures of the IDA (iterative double-sided auction)
mechanism can be described as follows. At the beginning
of each iteration, the broker announces the up-to-date dual
variables, i.e., the Lagrange multiplies λ and µ. Then, each
RSU and each EV determine their optimal bids by solving
the RUM and EUM problems, respectively, and submit the
bids to the broker. After receiving the bids, the broker decides
the current optimal allocation and pricing by solving the BA
problem, which produces the new data matrices X and Y
as well as the Lagrange multipliers λ and µ. Note that the

RUM and EUM problems are parameterized by the Lagrange
multipliers of the BA problem, in turn, the BA problem is
parameterized by the bids of the RUM and EUM problems,
that is the reason they need to be solved iteratively based
on the feedback from the market. In particular, for the BA
problem, we make use of its decomposable structure and adopt
the primal-dual Lagrangian decomposition approach [34], [35]
to solve it. As a result, the broker updates the dual variables
λ and µ in a gradient descent way as follows:

where δ > 0 is the step size and t represents the iteration
index. Then, the broker checks whether the current bids reach
stability. If not, the above procedures are repeated until the
bids reach stability, which indicates the market reaches equi-
librium. The details of the IDA mechanism are summarized
in Algorithm 1.

As mentioned previously, since energy is essential for EVs
and the function of energy supply can be integrated into RSUs,
we use energy as payments for RSUs and reimbursements
for EVs in the IDA mechanism. Consequently, we establish
an IDA-based Data-Energy Transaction (IDADET for short)
ecosystem in IoV, with a complete architecture as illustrated
in Fig. 3 and a whole operation process as shown in Fig. 4.

In the IDADET ecosystem, the data center publishes data
acquisition tasks to RSUs and EVs. Then, EVs aggregate
data and will exchange data to RSUs for energy. A broker
(market operator) is engaged in this stage to facilitate the
data-energy transaction process between EVs and RSUs, who
executes the IDA mechanism (Algorithm 1) to regulate and
induce the market behaviors of buyers and sellers. According
to the data allocation and pricing decided by the broker, EVs
and RSUs implement the data and energy exchange. Finally,
RSUs return the data purchased from EVs to the data center.
The proposed IDADET ecosystem possesses a set of desirable
properties such that RSUs and EVs are willing to participate
in it, resulting in virtuous and sustainable operations. In the
next section, we will introduce and prove these properties
sequentially.
Remark 2. Regarding the practical implementation and com-
mercialization of the IDADET ecosystem, except for the pro-
posed IDA transaction mechanism, the underlying technolo-
gies in terms of wireless communications and energy transfer
are also significant. As mentioned in the system model, the
information infrastructure consisting of base stations (which
have been already widely used in human life for a long time)
can help broadcast the data collection tasks and deliver the
data from RSUs to the data center. When adjacent RSUs
and EVs conduct transactions, data can be transmitted in a
way of D2D communications by using short-range wireless
communication technologies, while energy reimbursements
can be achieved by wireless charging. The details of various
technical implementations of wireless charging can be found
in [36].
V. ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF IDADET ECOSYSTEM
In this section, we verify the economic feasibility of the
proposed IDADET ecosystem. We first analyze the conver-
gence of the IDA mechanism and then prove the desirable
economic properties of the ecosystem, including individual
rationality, incentive compatibility, economic efficiency, and
budget balance.
A. Convergence of IDA Mechanism
Regarding the convergence of the proposed IDA mechanis-
m, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The IDA mechanism designed for the data-energy
transaction between RSUs and EVs converges to the unique
optimal solution to the SWM problem formulated in (4a)-(4d).
Proof: According to the update functions (23) and (24),
the dynamics of the dual variables λn and µm,n, defined as
λ̇n(t) = λ
(t+1)
n −λ(t)
n and µ̇m,n(t) = µ

Let V̇ (λ,µ) denote the first-order derivative of the Lyapunov
function with respect to t, which satisfies inequality (28)

we have ∂Fm(x†m)
∂x†m,n
= µ†m,n and ∂Cn(y†n)
∂y†n,m
= µ†m,n − λ†n. Then,
inequality (28) can be transformed to (29), shown at the bottom
of this page.
Due to the strictly concave property of RSUs’ payoff func-
tions and the strictly convex property of EVs’ cost functions,
we have(

Therefore, V̇ (λ,µ) ≤ 0 holds, and according to the Lyapunov
stability theory [37], [38], λ(t)
n and µ
(t)
m,n converge, further
indicating that the IDA mechanism converges. In addition,
the pricing rules adopted by the IDA mechanism are able to
induce RSUs and EVs to submit bids following (14a) and
(14b), respectively, ensuring that the outputs converge to the
unique optimal solution to the SWM problem. This completes
the proof.
B. Economic Properties
The concerned desirable economic properties include In-
dividual Rationality (IR), Budget Balance (BB), Incentive
Compatibility (IC), and Economic Efficiency (EE), which are
defined as follow:
• Individual Rationality: By participating in the IDADET
ecosystem, RSUs and EVs will never obtain negative
utilities, i.e., they will be at least not worse than those
who do not participate in the ecosystem.
• Budget Balance: There is no additional investment re-
quired for the market operator (broker) to make the
IDADET ecosystem work well. That is, the negotiated
payments from each RSU to the broker is no less than
the reimbursements from the broker to the corresponding
EV.
• Incentive Compatibility: Both sides of the auction, i.e.,
RSUs and EVs, are incentivized to reveal their local
information truthfully.
• Economic Efficiency: The IDADET ecosystem is able to
realize the social welfare maximization.
Theorem 2. The proposed IDADET ecosystem possesses
the desirable economic properties of individual rationality
(IR), budget balance (BB), incentive compatibility (IC), and
economic efficiency (EE).
In what follows, we prove these economic properties se-
quentially.
1) Individual Rationality
Proof: Since Fm(xm) is a strictly concave function of
xm and Fm(0) = 0, according to the Lagrange’s Mean Value
Theorem, we have
Fm(x†m) ≥ Fm(0) + x†m,n
∂Fm(x†m)
∂x†m,n
= x†m,n
∂Fm(x†m)
∂x†m,n
.
(31)
Considering the optimal bid and payments of RSU m, there
is
x∗m,n
∂Fm(x†m)
∂x†m,n
= x†m,n
um,n
x†m,n
= Pm(u†m), (32)
which implies the following inequalities always hold.
Fm(x†m) ≥ Pm(u†m), ∀m ∈M. (33)
Similarly, considering the strictly convex property of EVs’
cost function Cn(yn) as well as the optimal bid and reimburse-
ments of EV n, we can deduce that the following inequalities
always hold.
Qn(v†n)− Cn(y†n) ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N , (34)
We have the following conclusions: on one hand, RSUs and
EVs can always gain a non-negative utility by participating in
the IDADET ecosystem; on the other hand, they have no gain
if they do not participate. Therefore, the designed IDADET
ecosystem satisfies the IR property.
2) Budget Balance
Proof: According to the RUM problem of each RSU
and the EUM problem of each EV, the budget of the broker,
denoted as Θ(U ,V ), is given by
Θ(U ,V ) =
M∑
m=1
Pm(um)−

n=1
Qn(vn),

vn,m
]
,
=
M∑
m=1
N∑
n=1
[µm,nxm,n − yn,m(µm,n − λn)] .
When all participants submit their optimal bids, there is
Θ(U †,V †) =
M∑
m=1
N∑
n=1
µ†m,n(x†m,n − y†n,m)
+

n=1
λ†n
M∑
m=1
N∑
n=1
(y†n,m − 1) +
N∑
n=1
λ†n,
(35)
It indicates that when the broker receives the optimal bids um
and vn from both sides, due to the KKT constraints, it will
always gain a non-negative budget. Therefore, the designed
IDADET ecosystem satisfies the BB property.
3) Incentive Compatibility (IC)
Proof: According to our derivations, it is clear that RSUs
and EVs do not need to report their private information to
the broker, but submit their current optimal bids to the broker
by locally solving the RUM problem and the EUM problem,
respectively. In addition, these iteratively updated optimal bids
can gradually reveal RSUs’ hidden payoff and EVs’ hidden
cost. In other words, RSUs and EVs do not share information
with the broker, but the optimal bids that they submit will
gradually eliminate confidential information and ultimately
maximize social welfare. Therefore, the designed IDADET
ecosystem satisfies the IC property.
4) Economic Efficiency
Proof: According to Theorem 1, we can know that the
IDA mechanism converges to an optimal solution where the
KKT conditions (12a)-(12e) are satisfied. In addition, adopting
the pricing rules regulated by (18) and (22) when the broker
charges payments from RSUs and provides reimbursements
to EVs, respectively, the optimal bids produced by the IDA
mechanism can result in the optimal data allocation X† and
Y †, which are equivalent to the optimal solution of the
SWM problem. Therefore, the designed IDADET ecosystem
can achieve social welfare maximization and satisfies the EE
property.
VI. AMENDMENT BASED ON BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
In real-world economic markets, the psychological and
emotional behaviors of economic participants usually have

11
non-negligible impacts on their psychological utilities and
decision-making. For instance, it is common that the psycho-
logical utility of the same food is higher for a hungry person
than for an already-full one due to different psychological
expectations held by the two types of people. Similarly, in our
proposed IDADET ecosystem, if an EV has been participating
in data acquisition tasks for a long time but there is never
a “salary” (energy reimbursement) raise, its willingness to
continue participating may decline, which could eventually
lead to the entire ecosystem coming to a halt. Taking into
account such effects and aiming to achieve the long-term
well-functioning of the IDADET ecosystem, in this section,
we make amendments to its operational rules by applying
the theory of behavioral economics, which is widely used
to explain the extent to which incentives affect participants’
psychology [39]–[42].
Consider a long-term operation of the IDADET ecosystem
going through multiple rounds of data acquisition task releases,
let Qr
n denote the energy reimbursements gained by EV n in
the data acquisition task of round r. Similar to [43], we also
utilize the concept of participation capital deposits, which is
defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Participation Capital Deposits). The depreciated
sum of energy reimbursements gained by EV n is referred to
as its participation capital deposits (PCD). Specifically, let Γr
n
denote the PCD of EV n after accomplishing the r-th round
of data acquisition task, and then we have
Γr
n =
M∑
m=1
Qr
n,m + φnΓr−1
n , (36)
where Qr
n,m denotes the energy reimbursements gained by EV
n from RSU m, and φn ∈ (0, 1) is the depreciation rate of
EV n’s PCD.
From the perspective of behavioral economics, the depre-
ciation rate measures the degree of decline in the psycho-
logical value of past cumulative gains. In this context, to
compensate for the psychological loss of EVs during long-
term participation (working), we amend the operational rules
of the IDADET ecosystem by regulating that EVs should
be compensated for additional energy reimbursements during
each round of data acquisition task. Let χr
n,m denote the
additional energy compensation provided by RSU m to EV
n at round r. In the following, we analyze the single-round
satisfaction and the long-term psychological experience of
EVs from the perspective of behavioral economics, which
are termed product utility and experience utility, respectively.
Based on the analysis of product utility and experience utility,
we then determine the additional energy compensation χr
n,m.
A. Product Utility
In the theory of behavioral economics, the product utility
of a participant reflects its satisfaction with the gain in a
single round of participation. Let Φr
n,m denote the product
utility of EV n obtained from RSU m at the r-th round of
data acquisition task, and it is calculated by the single-round
utility of an EV multiplying a corresponding satisfaction rate.
Therefore, Φr
n,m can be formulated as
Φr
n,m =
(
Qr
n,m(yrn,m)− Cr
n,m(yrn,m) + χr
n,m
)
ρrn,m, (37)
where ρrn,m is the satisfaction rate of EV n with RSU m, used
to measure the product utility gained from the unit profit.
We consider there are two factors that affect the satisfaction
rate ρrn,m. On one hand, ρrn,m is related to the ratio of energy
reimbursements from RSU m to the total reimbursements from
all RSUs. The higher this ratio, the larger the satisfaction
rate ρrn,m. On the other hand, ρrn,m is related to the ratio of
the total reimbursements to the expected return. The lower
this ratio, the larger ρrn,m, due to the fact that when the
reimbursements are scarce compared with the expected return,
the unit reimbursement can bring more psychological value.
Let Rr
n denote the expected return of EV n in the r-th
round and combing the above discussions, we formulate the
satisfaction rate ρrn,m as
ρrn,m =
√√√√√ Qr
n,m + χr

B. Experience Utility
The experience utility describes the long-term psychological
experience of EVs participating in data acquisition tasks.
Specifically, PCD and the cumulative task cost are two factors
to affect the experience utility of an EV. Let Br
n denote the cost
threshold of EV n at r-th round, which is used to capture the
EV’s sensitivity to the cost of implementing data acquisition
tasks. Then, the experience utility of EV n for RSU m up to
the rth round of tasks, denoted as Ψr
n,m, is given by
Ψr

M∑
m=1
Crn,m(yrn,m)
Brn , (39)
where 0 < αn,m < 1 is a discount factor and Ωr−1
n is the
accumulative negative utility.
Unlike PCD, there is no depreciation rate for the accumula-
tive negative utility, because the negative utility represents the
cost of immediate expenditure and past expenditure does not
have a depreciation effect on the current task. Then, we have
Ωr
n = ωr
n + Ωr−1
n , (40)
where ωr
n denotes the negative utility of EV n at the r-th
round, and it is expressed as
ωr
n =
M∑
m=1
Cr
n,m(yrn,m) · σr

The cost factor σr
n,m is used to measure the negative utility
resulting from the unit cost and it is related to the situation
that whether the EV’s expect return is achieved. Let Ar

cost of completing the data collection task for the current RSU.
When the expected return is already achieved, i.e., Ar
n > Rr
n,
EV n conducting data tasks for new RSUs will incur more
cost, so a decision needs to be made based on the total cost,
whether to continue the task for profit or stop it for cost saving.
Therefore, the cost factor σr
n,m is formulated as

According to the theory of behavioral economics, we define
the combined utility Ξr

utility and experience utility, which is expressed as
Ξr

Φr
n,m +
M∑

Regarding the combined utility, we have the following theo-
rem.
Theorem 3. If there is no additional energy compensation, i.e.,
χr
n,m = 0, although the EV’s combined utility increases as it
is continuously engaged in the IDA mechanism, the combined
utility per task decreases.
Proof: The proof of Theorem 3 is equivalent to proving
that as M becomes larger, Ξr
n increases but (Φr
n,m+Ψr
n,m) de-
creases. Since Φr
n,m > 0 and Ψr
n,m > 0, from expression (43)
it is obvious that the growth of M leads to an increase in Ξr
n.

Then, we have
∂(Φrn,m+Ψrn,m)
∂M < 0, i.e., (Φr

decreases as M increases. This completes the proof.
C. Amended IDA Mechanism
According to Theorem 3, we know that if there is no
additional energy compensation, the product utility and expe-
rience utility gained by an EV from a new data task decreases
when this EV continues being engaged in the IDA mechanism
for a long time. From the behavioral economics perspective,
although the IDA mechanism is able to achieve convergence
for each round of data acquisition task, the psychological
satisfaction of EVs for the energy exchanged per unit of
data will decrease with the growth of the participating period.
Over time, this could result in the dropping out of more and
more EVs, leading to the eventual shutdown of the IDADET
ecosystem.
To relieve EVs’ psychological dissatisfaction, it is necessary
to introduce additional energy reimbursements. Therefore, we
make amendments to the IDA mechanism by providing each
EV n with
M∑
m=1
χr
n,m energy reimbursements after the double-
sided auction converges, such that EVs are motivated to
continue participating in the next round of data acquisition
tasks. The energy compensation χr
n,m should be determined
based on the satisfaction rate and cost factor of each round,
and thus it is formulated as
χr
n,m =
(
1 + σr−1
n,m
)

(
max{ρr−1

)
Qr−1
n,m(yr−1
n,m).
(46)
Hence, in Algorithm 2, we summarize the amended IDA
mechanism that copes with behavioral economics.

VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we conduct extensive numerical simulations
to demonstrate the performance of the IDADET ecosystem.
We first show the behaviors of EVs and RSU under the IDA
mechanism. Then, taking psychological effects into account,
we show the performance of the amended IDA mechanism.
In our simulations, we specify the payoff function Fm(xm)
of RSU m as
Fm(xm) = log

We can see that expression (47) satisfies the criteria discussed

− 1. (48)
In addition, we set the step size δ = 0.05 and the tolerance
error ε1 = ε2 = 0.001 in Algorithm 1, and initialize the
data request and offer matrices X(0) and Y (0), as well as
the dual variables λ(0) and µ(0) as random values shown in
Table I. Actually, the system parameters can be flexibly set in
our simulations [44].
A. Performance of IDA Mechanism
We first plot Fig. 5 to show the evolution behavior of
EVs’ submitted bids with the number of iterations, where
we consider the ecosystem consists of two RSUs and two
EVs. We can observe from Fig. 5 that for every RSU-EV
pair, the EV’s bid shows a monotonically increasing trend
and converges after about 8 iterations, which demonstrates the

proposed IDA mechanism has high convergence efficiency. It
is worth mentioning that according to the update equations
and iteration terminating conditions in Algorithm 1, we can
know that when the EVs’ bids converge, the RSUs’ bids will
also converge.
With the same settings as those in Fig. 5, we then summarize
in Fig. 6 the variation of the gap between the data offer
and data request (i.e., y(t)
n,m − x(t)
m,n), which is an important
indicator for reflecting the market stability. Fig. 6 shows
that as the iteration number increases the gap monotonically
diminishes and finally tends to 0. It indicates that the proposed
IDA mechanism can guarantee that the iterative interactions
between two sides lead to an exact match point for the data
request amount of RSUs and the data offer amount of EVs.
The results of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 reflect the operating law
of the IDADET ecosystem in IoV, where RSUs and EVs
bid separately, and the broker adjusts the data allocation and
pricing until the amount of data offered by EVs and the
amount of energy supplied by RSUs reach equilibrium.

Fig. 7 shows how the social welfare of the IDADET ecosys-
tem varies with the iteration numbers of the IDA mechanism
under different settings of step size δ, where we set δ =
{0.04, 0.05, 0.06}, M = 5, and N = 5. We can observe that
in all cases the social welfare monotonically increases with the
number of iterations and gradually converges to the maximum,
which verifies the economic feasibility and convergence of
the proposed IDA mechanism. We can also see that the step
size does not change the achievable maximal social welfare
but affects the speed of social welfare convergence. This is
because the increase in step size will accelerate the evolution
of dual variables in Algorithm 1 so that the social welfare
reaches convergence quickly.
We plot Fig. 8 to show the evolution of RSU’s payments
and EV’s reimbursements with the number of iterations. We
can see that ss the iteration number increases, RSUs’ payments
increase instantly and then quickly become stable, while EVs’
reimbursements increase gradually. An important observation
from Fig. 8 is that the sum of RSU’s payments is always higher
than the sum of EVs’ reimbursements, which is compatible
with the assertion that the IDADET ecosystem satisfies the
economic property of budget balance.

terms of social welfare in the IoV-oriented data acquisition
market, we first plot Fig. 9 to compare its performance with
two mechanisms, i.e., Price-first and On-demand, which are
intuitive strategies that decide the data allocation according
to the order of pricing and data request amount, respectively
[44]. Fig. 9 shows that as the number of iterations increases,
different from the upward trend of the IDA mechanism, the
social welfare of the On-demand mechanism remains largely
unchanged and that of the Price-first mechanism declines
significantly. This is because, for the On-demand mechanism,
the variation of iteration numbers has no effect on data
allocation, while for the Price-first mechanism, determining
data allocation only by the order of pricing will incur malicious
competition, thereby leading to a decline in social welfare.
It indicates that although the operational rules of the intu-
itive mechanisms are straightforward and simple, they cannot
guarantee good social welfare for the whole data acquisition
market.
We further summarize in Fig. 10 the performance com-
parison in terms of the market social welfare of the IDA
mechanism with two existing resource trading mechanisms,
i.e., PAM-N and PAM-S [45]. The main difference between
these trading mechanisms reflects in the rules of reimburse-

ment. We can observe from Fig. 10 that as the number of
iterations increases, the social welfare of all the mechanisms
increases first, then, it converges soon for the IDA and PAM-
N mechanisms but oscillates obviously for the PAM-S mech-
anism. In addition, Fig. 10 shows that the convergent social
welfare of the IDA mechanism is remarkably higher than that
of the PAM-N mechanism, and not lower than the peak of the
oscillation curve of the PAM-S mechanism. It demonstrates
the advantages of the developed IDADET ecosystem in terms
of algorithmic convergence and achievable social welfare.
B. Performance of Amended IDA Mechanism
In the simulations for the amended IDA (A-IDA for short)
mechanism, we set M = 5, N = 4, and initialize the La-
grangian parameters and other system parameters by adopting
uniformly distributed random values. We summarize in Fig. 11
the long-term evolution of the EV’s combined utility in the
IDADET ecosystem under the A-IDA mechanism. We can
observe from Fig. 11 that the evolution trends of different
EVs’ combined utilities are similar, which first decrease, then
slowly increase, and eventually tend towards stability. This is
because when the combined utility of the EV decreases, the

A-IDA mechanism can suppress the downward trend in time
by giving the EV additional energy compensation, so that the
combined utility can rebound and remain in a stable state. It
indicates that the A-IDA mechanism can efficiently cope with
the psychological loss of EVs and motivate them to participate
in the IDADET ecosystem for a long time.
We then plot Fig. 12 to show the variation of the EV’s
satisfaction rate during the long-term participation in data
acquisition tasks under the A-IDA mechanism. Note that
in Fig. 12, each numerical point represents the sum of an
EV’s satisfaction rate with all RSUs, i.e.,
∑M
i=1 ρ
r
n,m. It can
be seen that as the number of rounds of data acquisition
tasks increases, the EV’s satisfaction rate swings (mainly in
increasing) in the first few rounds and then tends to be stable.
It indicates that by executing the A-IDA mechanism, EVs’
psychological satisfaction will not decline with the increase
in working time, and thus they are willing to be engaged
continuously in the IDADET ecosystem.
In Fig. 13, we show how the amount of additional energy
compensation granted to EVs varies with the number of rounds
of data acquisition tasks under the A-IDA mechanism. We can
observe that as the number of rounds increases, the additional

energy compensation of all EVs is somewhat reduced in
the first few rounds and then tends towards stability. Such
observation provides us with the significant insight that the ad-
ditional energy compensation granted to EVs does not become
uncontrollable as the number of rounds increases, instead, we
only need to provide a limited amount of energy compensation
to keep EVs participating in the IDADET ecosystem.
Finally, we plot Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 to show the impacts
of the cost threshold and expected return on satisfaction rate.
We can see that all the curves of satisfaction rate present
fluctuations with the number of rounds and finally converge,
this is because the satisfaction rate will tend to be stable
with the stabilization of the additional energy compensation.
Fig. 14 shows that a larger cost threshold can lead to a higher
satisfaction rate. This is in line with the basic principle of
behavioral economics: when the acceptable overhead is higher,
then an entity will have a better experience during market
participation. In the IDADET ecosystem, the larger the cost
threshold of EVs, the more additional energy compensation
can be provided, and thus the higher the satisfaction rate
of EVs will be. We can observe from Fig. 15 that a larger
expected return can result in a higher satisfaction rate. This is
because when the expected return is larger, the psychological
value generated by the unit payoff will also increase, and the
satisfaction rate becomes higher. The phenomena presented in
these figures demonstrate that the designed A-IDA mechanism
fits with the basic laws of market behavioral economics.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an iterative double-sided
auction-based data-energy transaction (IDADET) ecosystem
in the Internet of Vehicles. To achieve social welfare maxi-
mization under incomplete market information, we have reg-
ulated the interactive behaviors among market participants
by elaborately designing a set of operational rules covering
data allocation, bidding, payment, and reimbursement. The
economic feasibility of the IDADET ecosystem has been an-
alyzed by proving its convergence and desirable properties of
individual rationality, budget balance, incentive compatibility,
and economic efficiency. Furthermore, we have also made a-
mendments to the operational rules of the IDADET ecosystem
from the behavioral economics perspective, to cope with the
psychological effects of market participants and thus ensure
the long-term well-functioning of the ecosystem. Extensive
numerical simulations have been conducted to demonstrate
the practical operability and performance behaviors of the
IDADET ecosystem.
Note that in this study, the development of the IDADET
ecosystem is on the basis of the underlying techniques’ com-
pleteness. When formulating the SWM problem, we consider
the properties of the data acquisition market while shielding
the physical characteristics of the IoV. It is interesting to
introduce the physical effects such as energy transfer, wireless
communications, and EVs’ mobility into the problem formula-
tion, but meanwhile, the problem solution and the design of the
data transaction mechanism may become more sophisticated.
Therefore, in our future work, we will further investigate the
design of the IoV-oriented data acquisition market integrated
with more practical network characteristics.
