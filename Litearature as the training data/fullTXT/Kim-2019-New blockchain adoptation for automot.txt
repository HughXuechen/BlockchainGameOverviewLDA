I. INTRODUCTION  
This paper deals with the security matters in automotive by 
using the Blockchain technology and an innovative thinking 
skill which has been adopted to develop the new prototype 
design from the initial idea. One of innovative thinking skill 
which is called Systematic Innovation [1] is a structured 
process and a practical toolset for new idea generations and 
applied to the technical problems. One of techniques in the 
Systematic Innovation has been applied to make a conceptual 
solution. Blockchain becomes a strong candidate for solving 
various problems in the automotive industries. Atypical 
Blockchain adaptation in the automotive includes supply 
chain, finance, retail sales and the management of spare parts 
and warranty [2]. The parts of a car are connected as IoT 
(Internet-of-Things) and identifying genuine parts of each 
component becomes vital and these types of technology 
evolving have faced various security matters in the 
automotive industries. Blockchain becomes a strong 
candidate for solving these problems [3-4]. Especially, spare 
parts and warranty problems are directly related with security 
matters of cars.  
 
The Blockchain maintains a growing list of blocks which 
are chained to each other. It is a distributed database and has 
been proposed by Satoshi as the underlying technology 
behind the Bitcoin [5]. The Blockchain has been applied in all 
range of car industries in terms of enhancing the security 
matters. The process of upgrading the Electronic Control 
Units (ECU) in a vehicle and the process of fixing a bug in 
the software installed in ECUs are considered as the security 
matters. Current security architectures are centralized 
software updates and these architectures do not address the 
privacy issues. But software upgrade based on the Blockchain 
architecture could be applied while maintaining the vehicle 
the owner privacy [6]. Car insurance companies could offer 
flexible insurance fees of cars for their customers and a car 
company could evaluates the driving behavior using data 
collected from a vehicles. These data could be secured by the 
decentralized networks (i.e., Blockchain network). Car 
sharing companies could also adapts the Blockchain 
technology because of enhancing similar security matters [6]. 
The number of electric vehicles is constantly growing and all 
components in a car are connected with smart devices 
including smartphones and smart home. Again, these kind 
connection requires high secured architectures and the 
Blockchain could be one of strong candidates. The owners of 
home (or cars) could determine the information sharing to 
protect his privacy when the novel services are enabled for 
enhancing the smart home (or vehicle) and its functionality. 
Blockchain based charging service (i.e., Blockcharge) could 
be used in platforms to pay the charging fees [7]. 
 
Many automobile manufacturers concern that false 
service centers are fitting counterfeit spare parts to their 
vehicles of customers [8]. The brand reputation could be 
damaged by counterfeit parts when these parts become a 
causes of accidents. Even a Blockchain enabled system which 
means that all IoT sensors, smart devices and service centers 
are connected makes the car manufacturer and the customer 
to enable trace the provenance of spare parts back through 
every step in the supply chain including the information of its 
original manufacture date and location. But it would be still 
difficult if a warranty claim has been made against a genuine 
part in grey market. In addition, most automotive 
manufacturers are not able to uniquely identify every part in 
every car sold they need to issue the recall for a specific model 
and model year. Using another type of Blockchain system in 
this paper shall make it easy for the warranty team to identify 
counterfeits quickly [8].  
 
The one of major strength of Blockchain is the 
decentralized peer-to-peer network and it eliminates a number 
of security risks that come with data being held centrally [9]. 
A vital concern in the decentralized network including the 
Blockchain network is the prevention of the 51 percent attack 
[9-10]. Decentralized consensus has been claimed with a

blockchain and we have observed the intensive attacks which 
are dedicated for decentralized networks. 
 
 This research deals with solving the problems for 
authentication of genuine parts of a cars by using the 
Blockchain technology. It includes the design development 
by using one of the Systematic Innovation methods to 
generate the conceptual solution and also shows the process 
how the conceptual solution could become an actual 
prototype solution. The brief summary of the prototype 
solution by using the Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) 
is explained after the conceptual design section [9].   
  
II. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN BY USING SYSTEMATIC 
INNOVATION 
The Systematic Innovation tools have been widely used for 
technical breakthrough and system improvements. Altshuller 
who is the founder of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving) and his colleagues have studied for identifying 76 
standard solutions [1] to improve problematic Su-Field 
models based on the massive research of existing patents. The 
Substance-Field (Su-Field) model is designed for analyze the 
problems related existing technological systems [11] and  this  
analysis is designed for making the complex problems to the 
form of analytic model which is related to the existing 
technical system. In other words, the Enhanced Su-Field 
model makes possible to identify problems in the view point 
of a technical system and to find innovative solutions to these 
identified problems [11]. 
 
A. Enhanced Su-Field Model 
The Enhanced Su-Field model has been introduced and it 
has been widely applied in the various area [12]. The notation 
of the model gives the intuitive descriptions of a problem and 
a solution at once. The conceptual descriptions are based on 
the Inventive Standards in the conventional TRIZ method. The 
notation of the Enhanced Su-Field model comes from the 
queuing model notations and these could describe all types of 
queuing model. Users who know the rules of the notations 
would understand the characteristics of the queuing model 
almost instantly when they see the notation [12]. The notions 
of the Enhanced Su-Field model has designed not only to 
cover most of all 76 Inventive Standards but also for someone 
who does not have the knowledge of the Inventive Standard 
solutions. Atypical user could recognize the problems and 
candidate solutions intuitively by using the Enhanced Su-Field 
model by itself (see Fig. 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 1. Types of the Problems based on the Su-Field Notation [12] 
 
The basic structure of the Enhanced Su-Field model 
which is simplified model of the Inventive Standard consists 
one object (S1), one tool (S2) and one field (F) The basic 
structure could be described as follows: 
 
 { } 4,2,1,0/// =xfsx                      (1) 
 
where x is the problem (or solution) type.  The problems in 
the 76 Inventive Standards could categorized as three types in 
the Enhanced Su-Field Model. Similarly, the Inventive 
Standard solutions based on Su-Field notations can be 
summarized as follows [12]:

The formula (2) is the most abstracted conceptual solutions 
[12] which gives a brief description but it covers all of 
Inventive Solutions (Group 1-4). The conceptual solution 
based on the Enhanced Su-Field model could be not only 
applied in conventional engineering problems but also 
flexibly applied in problems of technologies and business. 
 
B. Enhanced Su-Field Model based Conceptual Solution   
As it mentioned, the problem in this paper is about 
improving genuine parts [8]. The problem could be scope 
down how to generate and store the genuine  identification 
number of each automotive parts. This problem could be 
categorized into the Type-2 problem and the typical solution 
for the Type-2 problem is as follows [12]:

where the substances S* and the fields F* are the optimal 
attributes for solving the problem. The proposed solution for 
this particular problem about tracing the genuine part is as 
follows: 
(4) 
 
by adding some substances. It indicates that the candidate 
solution is adding additional factors conceptually. The new 
idea to compromise the counterfeit problem could be initiated 
by the Enhanced Su-Field model. The details of the candidate 
solution will be described on the Section III as the prototyping. 
 
III. PROTOTYPING 
This paper tackles the major issues for designing a 
Blockchain based automotive service that particularly related 
with handling the geniality of car parts. Two most recent 
technologies which are the BGG and the Fog Computing are 
adopted for solving this problem. This section provides the 
details of both technologies and give the guideline how these 
could be adopted to build the highly secure decentralized 
network. 
 
A. Blockchain Governance Game 
The Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) is a stochastic 
game model with the fluctuation and the mixed game 
strategies for analyzing the network to provide the decision 
making moment to take the preliminary security actions. This 
mathematical model could be formulated as the theorem 
which has been proved by the author [9] and it predicts the 
moment of one step before the 51 percent attack. The 
important factors including the marginal means for the number 
of attackers and the moment of the prior time when it exceeds 
more than half of total nodes. The portion of the reserved 
nodes will be the factor of changing the cost function. 
 
Fig. 2. Blockchain Network based on BGG [10] 
This game model is targeted to prevent the 51 percent 
attack and keeps the network decentralized. The defender only 
manages the small percentage of nodes which are released 
prior the attack is happened (Fig. 2). The results are given as a 
joint functional which gives the predicted time of two players 
when the first observed threshold is crossing the half of the 
total nodes along with values of each component upon this 
time. 
 
B. Fog and Edge Computing 
Fog computing is closed to end users and bigger 
geographical distribution. Fog computing is the terms created 
by Cisco and it refers to extending cloud computing to the 
edge of an enterprise network. Its computing facilitates 
operates for computing, storage, and networking services 
between end devices and cloud computing data centers. Edge 
computing is targeted to optimize cloud computing systems by 
performing data processing at the edge of the network, near 
the source of the data [13]. Although edge computing is 
conventionally referred to the location of services, fog 
computing implies distribution of the services which close to 
devices and systems in the control of end-users. Fog 
computing requires a medium weight and intermediate level 
of computational power. It often serves as a complement to 
cloud computing rather than a substitute. 
 
Basically, fog computing pushes information to the 
neighborhood area network amount of community knowledge 
at a fog node or even an IoT gateway [14]. The fog computing 
could be combined with the Blockchain technology for 
enhancing the security matters.

C. Blockchain Connected Smart Automotive Parts 
The Blockchain within IoT (i.e., components of a car) is 
considered for a secure network architecture. It is assumed that 
the car components in the Blockchain are "smart" which 
means that each component contains a sensor and capable to 
connected with other IoT. The car components are connected 
as the Edge network and the monitoring equipment in car 
service centers are Fog level (see Fig. 4). Additionally, the 
database in the headquarter is considered as the cloud network. 
The components in the car and the equipment of a service 
center are connected as single Blockchain (see Fig 5).

Fig. 4. Edge and Fog Computings in Auto Services by Using Blockchain 
 
Service centers and/or a headquarter have the additional 
nodes to avoid the 51 percent attack in the Blockchain 
Governance Game [9-10]. It is noted that another technologies 
for handling the isolated Blockchain within the Fog computing 
may be required to design the system.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5. Adopting BGG for Auto Services in Blockchain 
 
Each car component generates the value based on its 
mechanical action and the generated value is the transaction 
value in the Blockchain. The car components and one or more 
(logical) equipment in a service center are the nodes of the 
Blockchain. The miner is selected based on VRF (Verifiable 
Random Function) which could be used for selecting the node 
for the ledge generation [15] without heavy computational 
powers. Unlike atypical Blockchain services (i.e., cyber 
currencies), there is no reward mechanisms in the system 
rather the VRF has been applied for proper node selection to 
generate a new ledger. Comparison between Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. 
shows how the framework of BGG is applied into the 
Blockchain based automotive services especially handling the 
genuine car parts.  
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper tackles the major issue for designing a Blockchain 
based automotive service network. The security perspective 
provides the Blockchain network protection to avoid the 51 
percent attack by using a hybrid stochastic model. In addition, 
relatively new IoT network is considered for build the new 
architecture to support the Blockchain network based 
automotive services. The unique innovative thinking skill has 
been applied to adopting the Fog computing and the 
Blockchain Governance Game techniques are applied into the 
automotive services especially for handling genuine car parts. 
This thinking skill called Systematic Innovation is the core to 
solve this problems in the proper Blockchain security network 
design and well demonstrated in this paper.
