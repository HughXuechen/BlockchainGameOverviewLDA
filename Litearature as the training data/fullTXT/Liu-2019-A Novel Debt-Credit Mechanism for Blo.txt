Abstract—With the advancement and emergence of diverse
network services in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), large volume of
data are collected and stored, making data important properties.
Data will be one of the most important commodities in the future
blockchain-based IoV systems. However, efficiency challenges
have been commonly found in blockchain-based data markets,
which is mainly caused by transaction confirmation delays and
the cold-start problems for new users. To address the efficiency
challenges, we propose a secure, decentralized IoV data-trading
system by exploiting the blockchain technology, and design an
efficient debt-credit mechamism to support efficient data-trading
in IoV. In the debt-credit mechanism, a vehicle with loan demand
could loan from multivehicles by promising to pay interest and
reward. In particular, we encourage loaning among vehicles by
a motivation-based investing and pricing mechanism. We for-
mulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to maximize the profits of
borrower vehicle and lender vehicles jointly. In the first stage,
the borrower vehicle set the interest rate and reward for the loan
as its pricing strategies. In the second stage, the lender vehicles
decide on their investing strategies. We apply backward induc-
tion to analyze the subgame perfect equilibrium at each stage
for both independent and uniform pricing schemes. We also val-
idate the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium.
The numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
pricing schemes.

the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted
widespread attentions by industry and academia [1], [2]. An
universal network framework of vehicles includes all existing
heterogeneous networks and vehicle-related mobile devices.
This concept is strongly shaped due to highly growing num-
ber of vehicles and mobile devices, such as smartphones,
laptops, wearable smart devices, and other sensor enabled
devices [3]. With the development of diverse network services,
the data collected, and stored in IoV are explosive increas-
ing, and are becoming non-negligible resources [4], [5]. The
current IoV framework usually adopt cyber-physical system
(CPS) as a centralized information infrastructure [6], [7]. In
the CPS framework, vehicle–vehicle interactions such as data
exchanging and trading are conducted via a management cen-
ter, which has high performance and reliability requirements
for data storage and computation-intensive tasks. Under the
background of big data and cloud storage technology, data
exchanging and trading will become important in future IoV.
However, under the current cloud-based centralized IoV frame-
work, the loss of control over users’ data has became a very
serious challenge, making it difficult to protect privacy, boost
innovation, and guarantee data sovereignty.
Recently, blockchain technology has emerged with its
advantages of decentralization, security, and trust [8]–[10].
Blockchain technology has been considered as a feasible
solution for addressing the challenges of trusty and security
in Internet of Things (IoT) [11]–[13]. With the assistance
of blockchain, IoT devices could trade energy or resources
with other un-trusted peers securely [14]–[16]. Especially,
researchers have also study applying blockchain in IoV sce-
narios for enhancing data security [17], which motivate us
to take a further study of establishing an efficient, peer-
to-peer (P2P) data-trading system for IoV. Li et al. [18]
proposed a blockchain-based secure scheme for IoT data stor-
age and protection, and exploited this scheme for data-trading.
Liu et al. [19] investigated the security issues of the data
interactions in the electric vehicles cloud and edge (EVCE)
computing, and proposed blockchain-inspired “data coins” to
support secure data interactions.
In the scenario of IoV, data interactions frequently occur
among multiple participating roles, such as vehicle-vehicle,
vehicle-roadside, and vehicle-infrastructure interactions [3].
Data commodities in IoV usually contain sensitive personal
information, thus the guarantee of security and privacy is

crucial for users involving data-trading [20]. The blockchain-
based trading system has the advantages of decentralization
and security, thus can provide security and privacy protec-
tion for IoV data-trading. In the other hand, blockchain-based
trading system still faces many challenges. First, the mobil-
ity of vehicles makes the connections of IoV instability and
frequently changes. The orders of IoV data commodities are
frequently interrupted and repricing is necessary. This poses
challenges of efficiency to IoV data-trading. Second, IoV
data usually represent high perishability. The perishable IoV
data suffer a greater loss in value with the trading time gap
getting larger [8]. For example, the smart vehicle naviga-
tion system needs the latest nearby traffic and environmental
information to avoid traffic jams. The consensus process in
a blockchain-based system increases the transaction confirma-
tion delays, which affects trading efficiency and funds turnover
of data-requester. During frequently data-trading of IoV, data
requesters usually do not have enough funds to support their
next transaction immediately due to the transaction confirma-
tion delays. Third, in IoV scenario there are many occasional
users. It is difficult for such new users to participate in data-
trading before they get data tokens by selling their data, which
reduces the trading willingness of new users. Such “cold-start”
problem also increases the barriers for new users. To overcome
the above challenges in data-trading, the blockchain-based IoV
system needs a flexible P2P debt-credit mechanism to help
data requesters pay for their transactions immediately even
if there are not enough funds in their accounts. The debt-
credit mechanism can improve trading efficiency and solve
the cold-start problem.
In this paper, we design an auxiliary debt-credit mecha-
nism for the blockchain-based IoV data-trading system. We
first describe typical P2P data-trading and loaning scenarios in
IoV. Then, we present an unified data-trading IoV framework
including buyer vehicles, seller vehicles, borrower vehicles,
and lender vehicles. To improve trading efficiency, we propose
a motivation-based debt-credit mechanism. The proposed debt-
credit system adopts a multiple-multiple, pure P2P debt-credit
mechanism. We encourage debt-credit businesses by providing
both interests and rewards to the lender vehicles. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to introduce debt-credit mech-
anism into IoV data-trading system. The main contributions
of this paper are summarized as following.
1) In this paper, we establish a blockchain-based data-
trading system for IoV. To support efficient data-trading,
we design an auxiliary debt-credit mechanism for the
data-trading system.
2) We formulate an investing and pricing model for
the debt-credit transaction, and adopt a two-stage
Stackelberg game to maximize the utility of the bor-
rower vehicle. In this game, the borrower vehicle acts as
leader and determines the loan rate for each lender vehi-
cle. The lender vehicles act as followers and determine
their investing amount.
3) We derive an unique Nash equilibrium point among
lender vehicles in the second stage. We investigate the
independent pricing as well as uniform pricing schemes
in the first stage. We prove that for both the independent
and uniform pricing schemes, the Stackelberg equilib-
rium is derived analytically.
4) We conduct simulation in a virtual map to evalu-
ate the performance of the proposed pricing schemes.
The numerical results show that our proposed pricing
schemes are effective and efficient. The independent
pricing scheme performs better than uniform pricing
scheme for maximizing the profit of the borrower vehi-
cle, and can better encourage data-trading and loaning.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II is
the research work related to this paper. In Section III, we intro-
duce the system components of the data-trading framework as
well as the debt-credit system. We propose a new architecture
for the blockchain-based IoV system. We also describe the
key operations of debt-credit business. In Section IV, we for-
mulate the two-stage Stackelberg game for the investing and
pricing problem. We analyze the optimal investing amount
of lender vehicles as well as the profit maximization of the
borrower vehicle by using backward induction for both the
independent and uniform pricing schemes. In Section V, we
give the performance evaluation with simulation and results. In
Section VI, we give the conclusions of this paper with future
directions.
II. RELATED WORKS
With the development of intelligent vehicles and vehicular
networks, the sharing and interaction of vehicular data have
also been focused by both academia and industry. Vehicular
data includes data generated from vehicular network and the
data required by vehicle users. How to securely and effi-
ciently share vehicular data is a challenge issue. Ko et al. [21]
presented an efficient data dissemination system in vehicular
networks via the cooperation of infrastructure-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-vehicle communication. More et al. [22] proposed
a cooperative data sharing with secure framework for volun-
tary services in vehicular networks. Ito et al. [23] proposed a
road alert information sharing system with multiple vehicles
considering various communication network environments by
using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Moreover, Feng and
Wang [24] proposed and analyzed a selective sharing scheme
for vehicular data owners to share their sensitive data with
some authorized data users in a vehicular social network. The
above works expanded the application of vehicular data in
various IoV scenarios. However, the security challenge and
privacy risk exist in the sharing of vehicular data.
In the last few years, the application of the blockchain has
been extended to IoT. Ferrag et al. [25] gave an overview of
the blockchain protocols and applications for IoT, and dis-
cussed the existing issues and challenges in blockchain-based
IoT framework. Moreover, many researchers have investigated
the potential of blockchain for establishing a trusted and secure
trading system for IoV. Kang et al. [26] exploited a consortium
blockchain to design a localized P2P energy-trading system
in which electric vehicles can trade energy. This motivates
us to study how to establish a blockchain-based data-trading
system for IoV. Singh and Kim [27] proposed a blockchain-
based crypto Trust point (cTp) mechanism to build a secure

trusted decentralized environment for vehicular data-sharing.
Yang et al. [17] proposed a decentralized trust management
system for IoV based on blockchain. The above systems did
not consider the efficiency issue of data-trading. Vehicular
data are characterized by perishability [4]. Data requesters in
IoV usually urgently need the desired data, such as real-time
road conditions data for trip time prediction. Transaction effi-
ciency becomes a bottleneck problem for blockchain-based
data-trading system.
In blockchain-based data-trading system, users are usually
short of funds due to the transaction confirmation delays and
cold-start problem, which significantly influences the transac-
tion efficiency. Li et al. [28] designed a credit-based payment
scheme to overcome the efficiency issue of blockchain-based
energy-trading system in IIoT. This scheme depends on autho-
rized “Credit Bank” which makes it not a pure P2P mecha-
nism. User privacy is still facing security risks. In this paper,
we exploit the blockchain technology to propose an effi-
cient data-trading and loan system for IoV. In particular, we
design a motivation-based investing and pricing mechanism
for the debt-credit system to address the efficiency challenge
of data-trading in IoV.
III. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED DATA-TRADING AND
DEBT-CREDIT SYSTEM
In this section, we introduce the entities and core com-
ponents of the blockchain-based data-trading and debt-credit
system. We propose a blockchain-enhanced five layered archi-
tecture for IoV based on the legacy architecture. We also
describe the key operations of the debt-credit process.
A. Entities in the Data-Trading and Debt-Credit System
The explosive increase of data generated in IoV makes it
impossible to store and manage all data in the local vehicu-
lar devices. Our proposed data-trading and debt-credit system
includes multi-interface-based station as aggregators which
provide high-speed communication and ledge storage ser-
vice for vehicles. Fig. 1 illustrates the data-trading and loan
system we consider. This system consists of the following
components.
1) Vehicles: Vehicles in our proposed system can exchange
their private data as commodities. Meanwhile, the vehicles can
also borrow and lend their data tokens, which we call “data
coins,” with other peers. Vehicles can gain data coins by selling
their private data, or borrowing data coins from other vehicles.
Vehicles which lend their data coins to others can also get
revenue of data coins as interests. Thus, in the proposed data-
trading and debt-credit system, vehicles play multiple roles:
seller vehicles, buyer vehicles, borrower vehicles, and lender
vehicles. Each vehicle chooses its role according to its data
requirement and economic state.
2) Aggregators: In the data-trading and debt-credit system,
aggregators work as brokers to manage trading-related activ-
ities and provide edge-computing services. The aggregators
also support high-speed communication among vehicles. In
a typical IoV system, the communication infrastructure (i.e.,
base stations) usually act as the aggregators [29]. Aggregators

also provide storage and backup for vehicular data, especially
when the local storage space is limited. Vehicles can transmit
their data via vehicle-to-vehicle communication directly or via
the aggregators.
B. Unified Blockchain for Data-Trading and Debt-Credit
System
In the proposed data-trading and debt-credit system, we
exploit a consortium blockchain for secure P2P data-trading
and loan services. Based on the five layered legacy IoV
architecture proposed in [3], we designed a new blockchain-
enhanced layered architecture for IoV, which includes the
following layers: perception layer, coordination layer, artificial
intelligence layer, application layer, and business layer. The
proposed five layered architecture with the related protocol
stack is shown in Fig. 2.
1) Data Layer: The first layer of our architecture is data
layer, which is consisted of the IoV perception sublayer and
blockchain data sublayer. IoV perception sublayer is mainly
responsible to gather vehicular data via vehicular sensors and
personal devices. The blockchain data sublayer is represented
by a series of connected blocks. Each block contains a hash
pointing to the previous block such that all blocks comprise
the blockchain. The transactional data stored in the blocks are
visible to all vehicles. Transactional data are encrypted and
signed with the digital signature for security.
2) Network Layer: The second layer of the architecture
is network layer, which is consisted of a network coor-
dination module and P2P network sublayer of blockchain.
The network coordination module is involving heterogeneous
networks including IEEE 802.11p, 802.11, and WAVE-1609.4.
In our system, we exploit a consortium blockchain to sup-
port secure and efficient data-trading and loan services. The
aggregators are selected as the authorized blockchain nodes.
Therefore, the P2P connections are actually built among the
authorized aggregators.
3) Artificial Intelligence Layer: The third layer is artifi-
cial intelligence layer, which is consisted of the blockchain

consensus sublayer, and vehicular-oriented computing and
analysis services. The protocols in this layer include CALM
service sublayer, WAVE-1609.6 service related protocols,
vehicular cloud computing and big data analysis related proto-
cols, and the consensus protocol of blockchain. In our system,
the authorized aggregators perform the proof-of-work (PoW)
consensus algorithm for vehicles and write the blocks with
transactional data. Transactional data are publicly audited by
all authorized aggregators [29].
4) Application Layer: The fourth layer is application layer,
which is consisted of resource handler protocol WAVE-1609.1,
blockchain intensive sublayer, and blockchain smart contract
sublayer. The resource handler protocol could manage resource
among IoV applications. Blockchain intensive sublayer is
responsible for rewarding the miner that first provides valid
PoW with digital tokens. Smart contracts are a series of
predefined protocols operated by all peers in a blockchain-
based system for specific service requirements. Blockchain
smart contract sublayer defines the smart contracts involving
trading and debt-credit business.
5) Business Layer: The topmost layer is business layer,
which is consisted of IoV business models, data-trading busi-
ness, and debt-credit business. As defined in [3], four types of
business models are considered in IoV, i.e., insurance, sale,
service and advertisement. Data-trading business and debt-
credit business are guaranteed by the blockchain system with
security.
C. Operations of Debt-Credit Business
We now discuss the key operations of the proposed debt-
credit mechanism. The key operations of debt-credit process
are illustrated in Fig. 3.
1) System Initialization: In the proposed system, each vehi-
cle will become a legitimate entity by registration with a
trusted authority. Smart contracts deployed in the system
ensure the authority of vehicles. When joining the system,
each vehicle obtains an unique identity, its public and private
Fig. 3. Key operations of debt-credit process.
keys, and its encrypted signature. The authority also allocates
a wallet address for each vehicle as its account. After regis-
tration, the authority generates a mapping list for each vehicle
and stores the list in each aggregator.
2) Choosing Different Roles: In the debt-credit scenario,
vehicles are divided into borrower vehicles and lender vehi-
cles. Vehicles without enough funds become the borrower
vehicles, and vehicles with surplus funds become the lender
vehicles. Lender vehicles should register their loan services
into the service pools. The borrower vehicle asks for a list
of lender vehicles from the service pools and select the
appropriate lender vehicles.
3) Borrowing and Lending: Our proposed debt-credit
mechanism supports a multiple-multiple borrowing and lend-
ing model. A borrower vehicle can get its loans from multiple
lender vehicles, and a lender vehicle can also provide loans
to multiple borrower vehicles. In this debt-credit machanism,
the loan amount and rate of each borrower-lender pairs are
derived by a motivation-based investing and pricing mecha-
nism. More details are given in Section IV. After determining
the loan amount and interest rate, the borrower vehicle will
send an IOU (i.e., a promise to pay a debt) to each lender
vehicle. After verifying the IOU as well as the identity of
the borrower vehicle, the lender vehicles send corresponding
data coins to the public wallet address of the borrower vehi-
cle. In the repayment process, the borrower vehicle sends the
repayments, including both capital and interest, to the wallet
address of each lender vehicle. The lender vehicles confirm
the amount of repayments and whether the repayments are
overdue. Finally, both the lender vehicles and borrower vehi-
cle will update their credit rate and broadcast the transactional
data to aggregators for public audit.
4) Building Blocks and Carrying Out Consensus
Process: Authorized aggregators will collect all transactional
data for a certain period with encrypted signatures, and struc-
ture them into blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic
hash for its prior block, thus form the blockchain. The

9102 IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL, VOL. 6, NO. 5, OCTOBER 2019
authorized aggregators that first gives a valid PoW in the con-
sensus process will be selected as the blockchain leader. The
blockchain leader broadcasts block data, a timestamp, and its
PoW to other peers for verification and audit. Other peers
then reply with their audit results for mutual supervision and
verification. If all the auditors agree on the block data, the
blockchain leader will add its block into the blockchain and
obtain its mining rewards.
IV. MOTIVATION-BASED INVESTING AND PRICING
MECHANISM FOR DEBT-CREDIT SYSTEM
In the scenario of data-trading, buyer vehicles obtain the
required data by paying data coins to the seller vehicles. The
perishability of digital goods requires an efficient trading and
payment manner [4]. However, due to the transaction confir-
mation delays, some buyer vehicles may not have enough data
coins for their required data. The cold-start problem for new
users also increases the barriers for new participants joining
the trading. In this section, we present a debt-credit system
to address the challenge of efficiency, and solve the cold-
start problem of new users. We propose a motivation-based
investing and pricing mechanism for the debt-credit system.
In particular, we formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to
solve the pricing problem in the debt-credit process. In this
game, the borrower vehicle acts as the leader and sets its loan
rate for each lender. The lender vehicles act as followers and
decide their optimal investing strategies.
A. Problem Formulation
The proposed loan system is similar with a bond-based
investment system. In this system, the borrower vehicle raise
the required funds by issuing bonds with a given repayment
term. The lender vehicles act as investors. Each investor will
purchase some bonds from the borrower vehicle. The borrower
vehicle has the duty to repay both capital and interest to the
investors within the prescribed repayment term.
We consider that there are a group of N lender vehicles,
the set of which is denoted by N = {1, . . . ,N}, that can pro-
vide lending services to the borrower vehicle. The borrower
vehicle obtains its required data coins by issuing bonds with
a certain interest rate to each lender vehicle. The lender vehi-
cles purchase the bonds by paying data coins to the borrower
vehicle. In this model, the borrower vehicle determines its
loan rate from each lender vehicle i ∈ N , which is denoted
by ri. Lender vehicle i determines its investing amount, i.e.,
the lending amount, which is denoted by xi. The minimum
loan requirement of the borrower vehicle is denoted by X.
The maximum investing amount, i.e., the maximum lending
amount, of i is denoted by xmax
i . The minimum lending rate
of i is denoted as rmin
i . The maximum loan rate the borrower
vehicle can give is denoted by rmax. Let x � (x1, . . . , xN) and
x∗ � (x∗1, . . . , x∗N) represent the investing amount profile and
optimal investing amount profile of the lender vehicles, respec-
tively. Similarly, let r � (r1, . . . , rN) and r∗ � (r∗1, . . . , r∗N)
represent the loan rate profile and the optimal loan rate profile
of the borrower vehicle for each lender vehicle. The major
notations used in this paper are listed in Table I.
TABLE I
NOTATIONS
The interactions among borrower vehicle and lender vehi-
cles can be modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game [28].
In this game, the borrower vehicle acts as the leader and sets
its loan rate profile r in Stage I. The lender vehicles act as
the followers and decide their investing amount profile x in
Stage II. Fig. 4 illustrates this two-stage Stackelberg game. In
this model, we design a motivation-based investing and pric-
ing mechanism to provide economic incentives for the lender
vehicles. In this mechanism, the revenue of each lender vehicle
i consists a steady interest income, i.e., xiri, and an unstable
reward R. In a loan transaction, all the lender vehicles can
obtain their interest incomes, but only one lender vehicle can
obtain the unstable reward R. In our model, the lender vehicle
with more investment should be more likely to win the unsta-
ble reward. Thus, we define the probability that lender vehicle
i successfully wins the unstable reward as
Pi(xi, x−i) = xi
∑
j∈N xj
. (1)
Considering the economic risks of investing for the unstable
reward, which is a discouragement to the investors, we define
the investment willingness of i for the unstable reward as
φi = w
(
xmax
i + R− xi
)
/xmax
i (2)
where w is a predefined investment willing factor for R.
Therefore, the expected utility of lender vehicle i can be
given as
LUi(xi, x−i, ri) = xi
∑
j∈N xj
φiR+
(
ri − rmin
i
)
xi. (3)
The satisfaction of the borrower vehicle is related to total
raised funds, i.e., the investing amount from all lender vehicles.
We denote the satisfaction function of the borrower vehicle as
BUsat(x) = η ln
(
∑
i∈N
xi − X + 1
)
(4)
where η > 0 is a predefined greedy factor of the borrower
vehicle, indicating the willingness of the borrower vehicle for
raising more loans.

Fig. 4. Two-stage Stackberg game model of loan pricing problem.
The profit of the borrower vehicle is its satisfaction minus
the interest and the reward it will pay. Thus, the expected profit
of the borrower vehicle is represented as
BU(x, r) = BUsat(x)−
∑
i∈N
(
rixi + xi
∑
j∈N xj
R
)
= BUsat(x)−
∑
i∈N
rixi − R. (5)
By using backward induction, we formulate the optimization
problem for borrower vehicle and lender vehicles as follows.
Problem 1 (Lender Vehicle i Subgame):
maximize
xi
LUi(xi, x−i, ri)
subject to xi ∈ [0, xmax
i ],∀i ∈ N . (6)
Problem 2 (Borrower Vehicle Subgame):
maximize
r
BU(x, r)
subject to ri ∈
[
rmin
i , rmax
]
,∀i ∈ N . (7)
Problems 1 and 2 together form the two-stage Stackelberg
game. The objective of this game is to find the Stackelberg
equilibrium in which the profit of the leader is maximized
given that the followers adopt their best responses.
Definition 1: Let x∗ and r∗ denote the optimal investing
amount profile of the lender vehicles and the optimal loan
rate profile of the borrower vehicle for each lender vehicle,
respectively. The point (x∗, r∗) is the Stackelberg equilibrium
if the following conditions:
BU
(
x∗, r∗
) ≥ BU
(
x∗, r
)
(8)
and
LUi
(
x∗i , x∗−i, r∗i
) ≥ LUi
(
xi, x∗−i, r∗i
)
,∀xi ≥ 0,∀i ∈ N (9)
are satisfied, where x∗−i is the optimal investing amount profile
of other lender vehicles except i.
In this Stackelberg game, the borrower vehicle can apply
two types of pricing schemes to the lender vehicles: 1) the
independent pricing scheme and 2) the uniform pricing
scheme. These two types of pricing schemes focus on the profit
of the borrower vehicle and the profit of the lender vehicles,
respectively. In the independent pricing mode, the borrower
vehicle set different loan rate for each lender vehicle indepen-
dently to maximize its profit and minimize the cost. In the
uniform pricing mode, the borrower vehicle set the same loan
rate for each lender vehicle. Each lender vehicle impartially
get their interest income based on an uniform loan rate. This
mode embodies the principle of fairness for the investments of
the lender vehicles. We investigate these two pricing schemes,
and conduct equilibrium analysis in the following.
B. Independent Pricing Scheme
We first investigate the independent pricing scheme. The
Stackelberg game between the borrower vehicle and the lender
vehicles can be divided into a series of subgames between
the borrower vehicle and each lender vehicle. Therefore, we
can solve the pricing problem by deriving the Stackeberg
equilibrium, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, of each subgame inde-
pendently. We use backward induction to analyze the two-stage
Stackelberg game.
1) Lender Vehicles’ Investing Strategies in Stage II: Given
the loan rate of the borrower vehicle for each lender vehicle i ∈
N , i.e., {ri}i∈N , the lender vehicles maximize their utilities by
determining their optimal investing strategies. This forms the
noncooperative Lender vehicles’ investing game (LIG), which
is presented as: G = {N , {xi}i∈N , {LUi(xi, x−i, ri)}i∈N }, where
{xi}i∈N is the set of investing strategies, and LUi(xi, x−i, ri) is
the utility of lender vehicle i corresponding to ri and x. Each
lender vehicle sets its investing strategy to maximize its utility.
We next investigate the Nash equilibrium in the LIG.
Definition 2: The investing mount vector
x∗ � (x∗1, . . . , x∗N) is the Nash equilibrium of
G = {N , {xi}i∈N , {LUi(xi, x−i, ri)}i∈N }, if LUi(x∗i , x∗−i, r∗i ) ≥
LUi(xi, x∗−i, r∗i ) is satisfied for each lender vehicle i ∈ N and
for all xi ∈ [0, xmax
i ].
Theorem 1: An unique Nash equilibrium exists in G =
{N , {xi}i∈N , {LUi(xi, x−i, ri)}i∈N }.
Proof: The strategy space for i is defined to be [0, xmax
i ],
which is a nonempty, convex, compact subset of the Euclidean
space. From (3), LUi(xi, x−i, ri) is apparently continuous in
[0, xmax
i ]. We define α = ∑
i∈N xi as the loan amount of the
borrower vehicle from all lender vehicles. Similarly, we define
βi = α − xi = ∑
j �=i xj as the loan amount of the borrower
vehicle from other lender vehicles except i, and assume that
βi > xi,∀i ∈ N . We take the first- and second-order deriva-
tives of (3) with respect to xi to prove its concavity, which can
be written as follows:

Therefore, we proved that LUi(xi, x−i, ri) is strictly concave
with respect to xi. Accordingly, a Nash equilibrium exists in
this noncooperative LIG.
Next, we prove the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in
LIG. We investigate the optimal investing strategies {x∗i }i∈N
of lender vehicles.
Based on [(∂LUi)/(∂xi)] = 0, we have

Therefore, we obtain the best response function for lender

where zi =

−βi, Fi(x) is the best response function of lender vehicle i.
Let x∗ denote the Nash equilibrium of LIG. This Nash
equilibrium must satisfy x∗ = F(x), where F(x) =
(F1(x), . . . ,FN(x)). Fi(x) is the best response function of
lender vehicle i as shown in (13). The uniqueness of the Nash
equilibrium in LIG can be proved by showing that the best
response function of i is a standard function [30].
Definition 3: A function F(x) is a standard function when
the following properties are guaranteed.
1) Positivity: F(x) > 0.
2) Monotonicity: If x ≤ x′, then F(x) ≤ F(x′).
3) Scalability: For all λ > 1, λF(x) > F(λx).
We will prove that Fi(x) satisfies the three properties of a
standard function.
First, for the positivity, we have
Fi(x) =

Therefore, we prove the positivity of F(x).
Then, we prove the monotonicity of F(x) with respect to x.
We first prove the monotonicity of F(x) with respect to βi.
By differentiating (13) with respect to βi, we have

Let x′ > x, we have the following inequality for lender
vehicle i:
β ′i =

j �=i
x′j >
∑
j �=i
xj = βi. (16)
Based on (15) and (16), we have
F(x)− F(x′) > 0. (17)
Therefore, the best response function F(x) is always mono-
tone increasing with x.
Finally, for scalability, we must prove that λF(x) −
F(λx) > 0, for all λ > 1. The steps of proving the positivity
of λF(x)−F(λx) are shown in (18), at the top of this page.
So far, we have proved that the best response function
F(x) satisfies the three properties of a standard function.
Therefore, an unique Nash equilibrium exists in LIG. The
proof is completed.
In the following, we will analyze the profit maximization
of the borrower vehicle in Stage I under independent pricing
scheme to further investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium.
2) Borrower Vehicle’s Pricing Strategies in Stage I: Based
on the Nash equilibrium of the lender vehicles’ investing
strategies in Stage II, the borrower vehicle maximizes its profit
by optimizing its pricing strategies in Stage I. Therefore, the
optimal pricing strategies of the borrower vehicle can be for-
mulated as an optimization problem. Based on (5), the profit
maximization problem of the borrower vehicle in Stage I is
simplified as follows:

Theorem 2: In the borrower vehicle’s pricing game, the con-
vergence of borrower vehicle’s profit BU(x, r) is guaranteed if
there are sufficient funds in the loan market, and the parameter
η satisfies the following condition:
η <

(
4wR− xmax
i ri + 4xmax

i
)
xmax
i (2α − 3X + 3)
,∀i ∈ N .
(20)
Proof: In the independent pricing scheme, we assume
that the borrower vehicle sets the loan rate ri for each lender
vehicle independently. On the other hand, each lender vehicle i
gives its investing strategy mainly based on ri and other lender
vehicles’ investing strategies x−i. In this model, we assume
the investing strategy of i is independent with the borrower
vehicle’s loan rate for other lender vehicles. Thus, we have
the following relations:
∂xi
∂rj
= 0,∀j �= i (21)
and
∂βi
∂ri
= 0,∀i ∈ N . (22)
Based on (13), the loan amount of the borrower vehicle
from all lender vehicles is represented as
α =
√
wR
(
β2
i + xmax
i βi + Rβi
)
wR− xmax
i
(
ri − rmin

) ,∀i ∈ N . (23)
We derive the first- and second-order derivatives of α with
respect to ri by substituting (21) and (22) into (23), which can
be written as follows:

We define ψi = [(∂xi)/(∂ri)] > 0 and ϕi =
[(∂2xi)/(∂r2
i )] > 0 for convenience. Based on (23)–(25) we
can obtain the following relation:
3ψ2
i = αϕi. (27)
Based on (19) and (26), the first- and second-order deriva-
tive of borrower vehicle’s profit with respect to ri is given as
follows:
∂BU

(η − γi) (29)
where γi = [((α − X + 1)2(4wR − xmax
i ri +
4xmax
i rmin
i ))/(xmax
i (2α − 3X + 3))].
Since there are sufficient funds in the market, we assume
that (2/3)α − X + 1 > 0. It is easy to derive that
[(∂2BU)/(∂r2
i )] < 0 if the condition η < γi is satisfied.
The convergence of BU(x, r) is guaranteed. The proof is
completed.
The profit maximization of the borrower vehicle defined
in (19) is a convex optimization problem. We can apply a
low-complexity gradient-based search algorithm to achieve
the maximized profit of the borrower vehicle, as well as
the optimal strategies of both the borrower vehicle and
lender vehicles. We adopt Algorithm 1 to obtain the unique
Stackelberg equilibrium and solve the optimal loan pricing
problem. The basic description is explained as follows. First,
the leader, i.e., the borrower vehicle, offer its initial pricing
strategies to the lender vehicles. Then, the subgame of each
follower (lender vehicle) is solved based on the given pricing
strategies. Next, each lender vehicle offers its optimal invest-
ing strategy to the borrower vehicle. After substituting the best
response of the follower’s subgame into the leader’s subgame,
we find the leader’s corresponding pricing strategies which are
fed back to the follower’s subgame. Therefore, the leader’s
optimal pricing strategies can be obtained by a gradient-based
algorithm.
C. Uniform Pricing Scheme
Then, we investigate the uniform pricing scheme. In this
scheme, the borrower vehicle treats all the lender vehicles
equally with an uniform loan rate, i.e., ri = r,∀i ∈ N . We
use the backward induction to analyze the optimal investing
strategies of lender vehicles and the profit maximization of the
borrower vehicle.
1) Lender Vehicles’ Strategies in Stage II: In the uniform
pricing scheme, the strategy space of the borrower vehi-
cle becomes r ∈ [ max{rmin
i }i∈N , rmax]. The best response
function of lender vehicle i is similar with (13), which is
represented as follows:
x∗i = Fi(x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
xmax
i zi > xmax
i
zi 0 < zi ≤ xmax
i
0 zi ≤ 0
(30)
where zi =
√
([wR(β2
i +xmax
i βi+Rβi)]/[wR−xmax
i (r−rmin
i )])
−βi.
Since in the above section, we have proved the existence and
uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in LIG given the independent
pricing scheme, under the uniform pricing scheme the exis-
tence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium is also guaranteed.
To further investigate the Stackelberg game, we next analysis
the profit maximize of the borrower vehicle.

2) Borrower Vehicle’s Strategy in Stage I: Similar to the
independent pricing scheme, in the uniform pricing scheme,
the borrower vehicle maximize its profit based on the Nash
equilibrium of the lender vehicles’ investing strategies in the
Stage II. The optimal pricing strategy of the borrower vehicle
in the uniform pricing scheme can also be formulated as an
optimization problem as follows:
maximize

. (31)
Under the uniform pricing scheme, the borrower vehicle
sets the loan rate for each lender vehicle uniformly instead
of independently. Therefore, in the uniform pricing scheme,
the conditions (21) and (22) are not satisfied. It is difficult to
apply the gradient-based searching algorithm to achieve the
borrower vehicle’s maximize profit as Algorithm 1. However,
we notice that the strategy space of borrower vehicle in the
uniform pricing scheme, i.e., r ∈ [ max{rmin
i }i∈N , rmax], is a
subset of the strategy space in independent pricing scheme,
which is ri ∈ [rmin
i , rmax],∀i ∈ N . Thus, in the uniform
pricing scheme, the convergence of borrower vehicle’s profit
is also guaranteed by the conditions in Theorem 2. We can
adopt Algorithm 2, which applies a distributed pricing way
for the borrower vehicle, to approach the borrower vehicle’s
optimal uniform pricing strategy r∗.

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we first provide the security analysis of
the blockchain-based data-trading and debt-credit system.
Then, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the
performance of the proposed pricing schemes, including both
the independent pricing scheme the and the uniform pricing
scheme.
A. Security Analysis
Our proposed blockchain-based data-trading and debt-credit
system can provide feasible solution for trusty enhancement,
cost reduction and failure avoidance for data interactions.
Specially, the proposed system satisfies the following security
requirements.
1) Decentralization and Privacy Protection: The
blockchain-based trading system enables vehicles to conduct
data-trading in a pure P2P manner without relying on a
globally trusted intermediary, thus the privacy protection is
guaranteed.
2) Account Security: The proposed system also guaran-
tees the account security of vehicles by encrypted signature.
Adversaries cannot open vehicles’ wallets without the corre-
sponding keys and certificates.
3) Publicly Audit: Transactional data are publicly audited
and authenticated by all authorized aggregators such that
compromising all entities is impossible because of the over-
whelming cost.
4) Encrypted Signature: The encrypted signature ensure
that no adversary can pose as a user or corrupt the network,
because the adversary cannot forge a signature of a vehicle or
gain control over the majority of system resources [8].

Fig. 5. Simulation in the virtual map.
B. Simulation of IoV Scenario
We perform the simulation of IoV with a virtual map
as shown in Fig. 5. This virtual map consists of 200 cells
×200 cells. A cell is a grid in the map which represents a
50 m × 50 m area in the actual map. The cells can be
divided into two groups: 1) road cells in which vehicle nodes
can exist and 2) building cells in which vehicle nodes cannot
exist. The road cells are located per 10 cells in row and in
column in the virtual map, representing roads in the actual
map. Vehicle nodes are distributed in the road cells. All vehi-
cle nodes move to their neighboring road cells per unit-time,
and change direction only at the crossing. We consider the
unit-time in our IoV scenario is 5 s, thus the speed of each
vehicle node is 36 km/h averagely. The probability of a vehi-
cle node changing its direction at the crossing is set to 20%.
We define that a communication area of a vehicle node as the
area 10 cells ×10 cells from it.
In our scenario, a vehicle only executes debt-credit busi-
ness with vehicles in its communication areas. We call the set
of vehicles that can lend for a vehicle is the lender set of it.
Because of the mobility, a lender vehicle that enters the com-
munication area of the borrower vehicle will become a new
member of its lender set. The borrower vehicle will repric-
ing if there are new lender vehicles joining its communication
areas.
We study the performance of proposed debt-credit pricing
schemes by simulations. To illustrate the impacts of different
parameters on the performance, we consider a group of N
vehicles providing loan services when the borrower vehicle
asks for loans. The default parameter values of the numerical
experiments are set as follows: η = 120, rmax = 30%, R =
20, w = 6, X = 200, N = 10. We assume that {xmax
i }i∈N
and {rmin
i }i∈N follow continuous uniform distributions with
parameters [40, 60] and [0.8%, 1%], respectively. Besides, we
evaluate the performance of the independent pricing scheme
and the uniform pricing scheme in the following.
C. Impact of Mobility and Competition
The mobility of vehicles frequently cause that the lender set
of a borrower vehicle changes, and further influences both the
Fig. 6. Impact brought by mobility of vehicles on loan amount and average
lending rate.
Fig. 7. Comparison of independent pricing scheme with the scheme without
considering competition among lender vehicles.
pricing and lending processes. Since, we adopt low-complex
Algorithm 2 under uniform pricing scheme, here we only
investigate the impact of mobility under independent pricing
scheme. Fig. 6 shows the dynamics of average lending rate
and loan amount over time. In the scenario of Fig. 6, new
lender vehicles join in the lender set of the borrower vehicle
one by one with an unit-time as time interval, the amount of
lender vehicles, i.e., N, increases from 8 to 12.
We observe from Fig. 6 that the average lending rate and
loan amount quickly becomes constant because the borrower
vehicle gets its optimal pricing strategies in which the Nash
equilibrium is reached. The participating of new lender vehi-
cle will not decrease the pricing efficiency. Both average
lending rate and loan amount will convergence within 20 iter-
ations. Therefore, the proposed independent pricing scheme
is efficient and has good convergence even the lender set is
changed.
In Fig. 7, we compare the independent pricing scheme
with another Stackelberg game-based credit mechanism which
was used in [28]. In the compared algorithm, the competition
among lender vehicles is not considered. The unstable reward
is divided and equally distributed to each lender vehicle.

Fig. 8. Profit and loan amount of borrower vehicle versus the number of
lender vehicles.
Fig. 7 shows that our proposed pricing scheme outperforms
the compared schemes both in loan amount and average lend-
ing rate. We also observe that the borrower vehicle can obtain
more loans with lower rate under independent pricing scheme
with the increase of N. With the compared scheme, the bor-
rower vehicle’s profit and loan amount are not influenced
by N.
Furthermore, we observe that the average lending rate is
decreased, and loan amount is increased, when new lender
vehicles join the loan business. This is because that more
lender vehicles can intensify competition among lender vehi-
cles. The number of lender vehicles represents the competition
level among lender vehicles. We then investigate the impacts
brought by the number of lender vehicles, i.e., N, on the profit
and expenditure of the borrower vehicle. We also investigate
the impacts of greedy factor η, and address the comparison
of the independent pricing scheme and the uniform pricing
scheme.
Fig. 8 shows the impact of N on the profit and loan amount
of the borrower vehicle. We observe that the profit of the
borrower vehicle and its total loan amount increase with the
increase of N. This is due to that more lender vehicles will
provide more funds for the borrower vehicle. Therefore, the
borrower vehicle can collect more loan when there are more
lender vehicles. We also find that both the profit and loan
amount of the borrower vehicle under independent pricing
scheme are larger than that under the uniform pricing scheme.
This is because under independent pricing scheme, the strat-
egy space of the borrower vehicle is much lager than that of
the uniform pricing scheme. The borrower vehicle sets pric-
ing strategies for each lender vehicle independently thus can
achieve better pricing strategies. Further, we notice that both
the profit and loan amount of the borrower vehicle increase
when the greedy factor η increases. This is because when η
increases, the borrower vehicle is inclined to obtain more loans
instead of to reduce the costs.
Fig. 9. Interest revenue of borrower vehicle and average lending rate of
lender vehicles versus the number of lender vehicles.
Fig. 9 shows the impact of N on the interest revenue
and lending rate of the lender vehicles. The lender vehicles’
interest revenue is also the expenditure of the borrower vehi-
cle for its loan. From Fig. 9, we observe that the average
lending rate of lender vehicles decreases with the increase
of N. The interest revenue of lender vehicles is also decreased
with the increase of N, except for the initial part. This is
because that with the increase of N, the competition among
lender vehicles also increases. As a result, the borrower vehi-
cle can obtain more funds without paying more interest to the
investors. Therefore, we can get the conclusion that the com-
petition intensifying among lender vehicles will increase the
borrower vehicle’s profit and decrease its expenditure.
We also notice that the interest expenditure of the borrower
vehicle increases with N when N is no large than 7 from
Fig. 9. This is due to the borrower vehicle set the maximum
loan rate, i.e., 30%, as its pricing in this situation. Therefore,
its interest expenditure increases with N until there are enough
lender vehicles in the loan market. We also find that when
there are enough lender vehicles in the loan market, the bor-
rower vehicle will set lower loan rate under the independent
pricing scheme than under the uniform pricing scheme. Thus,
we can conclude that under the independent pricing scheme
the borrower vehicle can obtain more loans from the lender
vehicles by paying less interest than under the uniform pricing
scheme.
We next investigate the impacts of minimum lending rate
of lender vehicles, i.e., the set of {rmin
i }i∈N , on the interest
revenue and average lending rate of lender vehicles. Fig. 10
shows the results. In Fig. 10, rmin = 0.01 means the set of
{rmin
i }i∈N follows an uniform distribution among [0.8%, 1%],
rmin = 0.02 means the set of {rmin
i }i∈N follows an uniform
distribution among [1.8%, 2%]. From Fig. 10, we can find
that when lender vehicles increase their setting of {rmin
i }i∈N ,

the interest revenue and average lending rate of lender vehi-
cles are also increased. This is due to the setting of {rmin
i }i∈N
can influence the lender vehicles’ utility. The borrower vehi-
cle must increase its pricing strategies to satisfy the increased
interest demand of lender vehicles.
D. Investigation on the Impacts of the Unstable Reward
Then, we investigate the impacts of unstable reward R on
the profit and expenditure of the borrower vehicle. The results
are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.
Fig. 11 shows the impact of R on the profit and loan amount
of the borrower vehicle. From Fig. 11, we find that with the
increase of R, the profit of the borrower vehicle and its total
loan amount decrease. This is contrary to our intuition, because
when the borrower vehicle increases the reward the investors
reduce their investments. This can be explained as that each
lender decides its investing strategy not only based on the
reward R, but also for its interest revenue. The increasing of R
intensify the competition of lender vehicles. This enables the
borrower vehicle to increase its profit by reducing its loan rate
for each lender, which reduces the investment willingness of
lender vehicles conversely.
Fig. 12 shows the impact of R on the interest revenue and
lending rate of the lender vehicles. We observe that under the
independent pricing scheme, both interest revenue and aver-
age lending rate of lender vehicles decrease with the increase
of R. This is because that intensified competition makes the
borrower vehicle reduce its pricing strategies. We find that
although the borrower vehicle increase the reward cost, its
total expenditure is decreased due to the reduced interest rate.
We can conclude that under the independent pricing scheme,
the increasing of R will reduce the borrower vehicle’s expen-
diture. We also find that under the uniform pricing scheme, the
borrower vehicle’s expenditure dose not decrease significantly.

lender vehicles versus the unstable reward.

lender vehicles versus the unstable reward.
This also shows that the borrower vehicle can save more costs
under the independent pricing scheme.
E. Investigation on the Normalized Loan Rate of the
Borrower Vehicle
At last, we examine the impact of N and R on the normal-
ized loan rate of the borrower vehicle. The borrower vehicle’s
normalized loan rate is calculated by dividing the total cost,
including the interest cost and the unstable reward, by the
total loan amount. The results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14.
Fig. 13 demonstrates the borrower vehicle’s normalized loan
rate versus N. We observe that the borrower vehicle’s normal-
ized loan rate decrease with the increase of N. This shows

that the borrower vehicle will gain funds with more afford-
able pricing strategies when there are more competition among
investors. We also observe that the borrower vehicle’s normal-
ized loan rate is lower under the independent pricing scheme
than that under the uniform pricing scheme when there are
enough investors in the market. However, when there are not
enough investors, the borrower vehicle can gain lower nor-
malized loan rate under the uniform pricing scheme. This is
because when there are limited investors in the market, the bor-
rower vehicle is inclined to raise the interest rates for gaining
more loans. On the contrary, when there are enough investors,
the borrower vehicle is inclined to reduce the interest rates
for saving the costs. Therefore, we obtain the conclusion that
under the independent pricing scheme the borrower vehicle
can set better pricing strategies to maximum its profit. Fig. 14
demonstrates the borrower vehicle’s normalized loan rate ver-
sus R. We find that under independent pricing scheme, the
normalized loan rate of the borrower vehicle decrease with
the increase of R. However, under the uniform pricing scheme,
the increasing of R is not conducive to gain more profit for
the borrower vehicle. Therefore, we can conclude that there
is no significant advantage when the reward R is introduced
under the uniform pricing scheme. The introduction of R is
of benefit to the borrower vehicle only under the independent
pricing scheme.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a secure, decentralized data-
trading and debt-credit system for IoV based on blockchain
technology. To address the efficiency challenges caused by
transaction confirmation delays and cold-start problem of new
users, we designed an debt-credit mechanism to encourage
borrowing and lending among vehicles by a motivation-based
debt-credit mechanism. In this mechanism, the lender vehicles
act as the investors. we have adopt a two-stage Stackelberg
game to jointly maximize the profits of the borrower vehi-
cle and the lender vehicles. We adopt independent pricing
scheme and uniform pricing scheme in the debt-credit mecha-
nism. We have conducted numerical simulations to evaluate
the performance of both independent and uniform pricing
schemes. The numerical results show the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed debt-credit mechanism. Specially,
with the independent pricing schemes, the borrower vehi-
cle can gain more loans with less interest cost. In future
work, we will further investigate other important problems
in the blockchain-based data-trading and debt-credit system,
such as the valuation of data, and the problem of cooperative
purchasing of data.
