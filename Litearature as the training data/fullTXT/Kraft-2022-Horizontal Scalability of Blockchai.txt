Horizontal Scalability of Blockchain Games Using the GSP Model
Horizontal Scalability of Blockchain
Games Using the GSP Model
Daniel Kraft
Abstract In recent years, blockchain has emerged as an interesting technology not
just for digital currency but also more complex decentralised applications including
computer games. Smart-contract platforms like Ethereum are a popular choice for
developers of blockchain games. However, due to their architecture they are unsuit-
able for complex on-chain computations, as those would lead to unfeasibly high gas
costs. Consequently, most blockchain games today are either trivial in terms of game
mechanics or run on a centralised server, defeating the original purpose of using a
blockchain. In this paper, we present an alternate architecture based on game-state
processors (GSPs). This model decouples computations from the core blockchain
layer (miners and full nodes), effectively sharding computation and storage of state
between the different applications and games. With this, a blockchain platform can
be scaled horizontally to support many and highly-complex games with fully decen-
tralised, on-chain computations.

1 Introduction
Only a few years after Nakamoto’s invention of blockchain technology [21] in 2008
his idea was being applied to things beyond just a currency. The first such application
was Namecoin [14], but already soon after that a fully decentralised computer game
based on blockchain was described [8] and launched with Huntercoin [10]. Apart
from trivial gambling (e.g. SatoshiDice [4]), this was the first blockchain game ever

created, and it also pioneered the concept of human mining. Soon after, a second
decentralised game (Motocoin [30]) introduced another interesting concept, proof-
of-play. Based on the original ethos and cypherpunk spirit of the Bitcoin community
at the time, those early projects were indeed fully decentralised like Bitcoin itself.
Later on, smart-contract platforms like Ethereum [1] made it much easier to cre-
ate blockchain-based games. During the Bitcoin bullrun of 2017, CryptoKitties was
such a smart-contract game that gained widespread attention [27], and made larger
audiences aware of blockchain as a tool for computer games. Unfortunately, the
monolithic design of smart-contract platforms makes them unsuitable for decen-
tralised and complex game logic—this means that most blockchain games to date
are either almost trivial or using the blockchain mainly to store game assets, while
the game itself still runs on centralised infrastructure similar to traditional, non-
blockchain online games. CryptoKitties itself arguably falls in both categories at the
same time; the main interaction with the game is breeding digital cats, which can
hardly be seen as a particularly deep or complex game concept. But even with this
simple design, a crucial part of the game (namely the pictures associated to cats,
i.e. the phenotype derived from the on-chain genes) is not decentralised and instead
hosted on the game studio’s servers. Enjin is even an entire platform built around the
concept of centralised games that use blockchain-based assets [26]. Even for cen-
tralised games, the use of blockchain-based assets in the game certainly has many
benefits. For instance, it makes it much easier for users to hold, transfer and trade
their assets, even if the game developer was not able or willing to build a dedicated
in-game marketplace. For Ethereum-based assets, OpenSea [11] has developed into
a de-facto standard, universal marketplace where such assets can be traded.
However, game assets always have to be considered in the context of the games
themselves. Assets of a centralised game may be owned by the users in a trustless
manner on a public, decentralised blockchain (like Ethereum); but if the developers
of the game decide to shut down the game servers, ban a user or inflate the supply of a
supposedly rare item, then items will become worthless even if the game developers
may not be able to take them directly off a user. Especially with smart contracts, it
is nowadays quite common for the developers to give themselves special power to
upgrade the contract or otherwise control the system at will; such backdoors have in
the past been used to shut down supposedly decentralised applications such as the
IOTA network [7] or the tBTC application [12].
Therefore, it is important to distinguish between true ownership of assets in fully
decentralised games and just non-custodial ownership of assets in centralised games.
The latter is only an evolution, which makes asset-ownership and trading easier; the
former is a true revolution, which shows the real disruptive potential of blockchain
technology. This can be compared to how Bitcoin enabled the emergence of value
without any trusted, central instance for the first time in history, while “permissioned”
blockchains are just a handy tool to optimise some processes [13]. For a more in-
depth discussion of the benefits of fully decentralised gaming, see [28], specifically
the sections about CryptoKitties and hybrid architectures.
Xaya is a blockchain, platform and open-source project that strives to enable fully
decentralised, on-chain games that are still able to feature highly complex game logic

and computations. In contrast to gamesbuilt solely on smart-contract platforms, this is
enabled by decoupling the core blockchain from the potentially heavy computations
and states of individual games. This is possible through an architecture based on
game-state processors (GSPs), which we will describe in this paper.
Note that while we work on this topic ourselves to build decentralised computer
games, the term game in the following can just as well be understood to mean any
type of decentralised application (dApp), not necessarily restricted to entertainment
purposes.
2 Scalability for Blockchain Games
At least since the blocksize debate in Bitcoin [5], it is clear that scalability in general
is a hot topic and potential issue for any blockchain-based system. In fact, blockchain
as a data structure is very inefficient in terms of scalability; only because it enables
otherwise-impossible full decentralisation should it be used at all [31].
For “simple” applications of blockchain technology like Bitcoin itself, the main
scalability issue is the data that needs to be put into blocks, transmitted through the
network, and stored forever in the blockchain.But formore complex applications (e.g.
smart contracts on Ethereum) and especially non-trivial games, another important
bottleneck is the computing power needed to execute the contract or game logic. In
many cases of complex games, this may be the limiting factor rather than the volume
of raw data. Therefore, it makes sense to distinguish between two slightly different
types of scalability in this context.
2.1 Vertical Scalability
Even a monolithic design (where a single game runs on its own blockchain) can
easily run into scalability limits. For instance, Fig. 1 shows the size of the Hunter-
coin blockchain over the first 18 months after its launch. Especially right at the
beginning, the growth (i.e. transaction volume) was tremendous, considering also
that this was back in 2014 where even Bitcoin itself was not yet hitting the block-
size limit. It became clear that this growth was not sustainable, and a couple of
network-wide changes were implemented to address the issue (some of which are
marked with vertical lines in the chart). As can be seen, they took effect and slowed
down blockchain growth. However, this solution is far from perfect, as it came with
restrictions and severe changes to how Huntercoin could be used and played. Also,
since these changes were tailored specifically to Huntercoin, they cannot be applied
directly to other games.
Huntercoin was created as an experiment to see how blockchains can be used
for MMO-type games. As it became clear that some scalability solution is needed,
we developed game channels [19] as an off-chain scaling technology. Inspired by
80 D. Kraft
payment channels [23] and developed independently from state channels [20] at
around the same time, they allow complex game interactions (and not just payments)
to be done off-chain while keeping the whole system fully decentralised and trust-
less. This enables massive scalability within a single game as well as near-realtime
blockchain-gaming experiences. In the following, however, we want to focus on a
different aspect of scalability, and refer to [19] for more details about game channels
and vertical scalability.
2.2 Horizontal Scalability
If a blockchain platform is not specific to a single game and instead built to run
many games and applications in parallel, then the limits imposed on each individual
application have to be even tighter. For instance, Ethereum as the leading smart-
contract platformusesgas fees to charge eachuser according to the computations their
transactions require in smart contracts. As a consequence, it becomes prohibitively
expensive to execute anything beyond the most trivial game logic. For instance, it is
even impossible to directly check whether or not a position in chess is check mate

after launch. The vertical lines indicate changes to the network rules

[15]; and while it is certainly challenging for a human to play well in chess, the rules
themselves are much simpler than e.g. the computations required for a real MMO
strategy game. Similarly, CryptoKitties famously clogged the Ethereum network due
to its massive traffic after launch [16].
Strictly speaking, both of these are of course examples of single games running
into scalability limits, and thus could be considered vertical scalability issues. How-
ever, a decentralised network is certainly able to verify check-mate positions. But
if the network as a whole must be able to execute the computations of many other
smart contracts as well, then the limits have to be a lot more restrictive, which is
exactly what happens with Ethereum.
This is especially the case if the cost in computation (and perhaps state storage)
outweighs the raw transaction size stored in the blockchain, as is the case for the
chess example and many other potential gaming applications. For these situations,
the monolithic approach of smart-contract platforms is not very cost effective or even
outright prohibitive. To enable horizontal scalability of a blockchain to many and
complex applications, a different model is required, which we will discuss below.
3 The Role of Miners
It is a common misconception, especially in mainstream media, that “the job of
a Bitcoin miner is to validate transactions, and in exchange get a portion of the
reward in BTC for doing it” [24]. Of course, Bitcoin miners typically also validate
transactions before they put them into blocks; if they did not do this, they would risk
losing money for mining invalid blocks. (In fact, in 2015 an incident related to “SPV
mining” actually caused miners who did not properly validate blocks to lose block
rewards in this way [25].) However, from the network’s point of view, all full nodes
(which are typically a superset of the miners) validate transactions.
The real function of mining is to achieve consensus with proof-of-work (PoW).
More specifically, through mining the network establishes a time order in which
transactions occurred, thus enabling to determine which of a possible set of conflict-
ing transactions is the “correct” one, solving the double-spending problem. This is
described as a “timestamp server” already in the original Bitcoin whitepaper [21].
4 Game-State Processors
Now all necessary preliminaries are in place, and we can discuss how the GSP
architecture allows to decouple the potentially expensive computations for some
game from the core blockchain network, and thus greatly improve the network’s
horizontal scalability.
82 D. Kraft
Fig. 2 Screenshot of Huntercoin, showing some of the game’s basic concepts
4.1 Game States
Blockchains in general can be interpreted as a state-transition system [1]. Associ-
ated to each block is a current state. It can be computed deterministically from the
state associated to the previous block, the transactions inside the block as “update
data”, and the network’s hardcoded rules (the state-transition function). In the case
of Bitcoin, the state is the current ledger, represented by the UTXO set. The updates
applied are transactions that spend some inputs (remove them from the UTXO set)
and create new outputs (that get added to the UTXO set). Other blockchains typically
have more complex states and state-transition functions, e.g. Namecoin or Ethereum.
Figure 2 shows a screenshot of Huntercoin. In the game, players can move around
with their avatars (“hunters”) on a map. They are able to pick up coins placed on the
map, and then need to bring them to a banking location while others may try to attack
them and steal the coins. Once banked, the coins appear in the user’s wallet, and act
like an ordinary cryptocurrency. Consequently, the game state ofHuntercoin contains
like Bitcoin’s the ledger of banked coins in form of an UTXO set; however, it also
contains the state of the game world, i.e. the positions of all hunters on the map, their
waypoints and all coins that are not yet banked. This state can be affected by each
player by sending their moves as transactions in the blockchain. These moves are
the creation of new hunters, changes to their waypoints (thus controlling movement)
and an “attack” action.
Horizontal Scalability of Blockchain Games Using the GSP Model 83
It is important to understand that the state itself is never stored in the blockchain,
only moves (player actions) are. The state is computed independently from those
moves by each network node for themselves. Since mining ensures consensus about
the set and order of moves that have occurred and each node is using the same
game rules (state-transition function), everyone is guaranteed to obtain the same
state as well.
4.2 Decoupling States from the Core Blockchain
Let us now briefly summarise what we have learned so far: It is not necessary to
store the actual game state on chain; instead, it is enough to store the moves on the
blockchain, and then have every node compute the game state independently. The
only thing that is required to make this work and ensure everyone arrives at the same
state is to ensure that they are using the same state-transition function (i.e. are using
the same consensus rules and follow the same hard forks), and that PoW mining
yields a network consensus on the sequence of moves that have taken place. But on
the other hand, it is not necessary for miners to actually interpret what those moves
mean in the context of a particular game, and thus it is also not necessary for miners
to know any current game state (or even the rules of individual games).
This insight allows us to decouple computation of game states from the underlying
core network; thus, we can split the architecture of such a platform into two layers:
1. The core layer consists of the P2P network of nodes, the actual blockchain, and
PoWmining of transactions. It also needs a cryptocurrency to pay for transaction
fees and in this way protect against blockchain spam (by having a fee market).
This layer allows arbitrary data for moves to be put on chain, without validating
or interpreting them in any game-specific way. In the case of Xaya, the core layer
also manages a concept of “user accounts” (based on Namecoin names), and
ensures through digital signatures that only the owner of an account can send
moves for it.
2. Each game running on the platform provides a game-state processor (GSP):
This is a software process that runs alongside the core blockchain node, reads
the sequence of moves from the blockchain, and uses the game-specific state-
transition function to compute the current state. This can then e.g. be used to
show the state to the user in a game frontend, or for other purposes (perhaps as
part of an exchange that allows trading of assets from one of the games).
The crucial observation here is that miners and full nodes are only required to
handle the first part of this. All heavy computation for a particular game (as well as
storing that game’s state) is done by the GSP instead. And the GSP for some game
only needs to be run by users who need to know the state of that game, i.e. who
are actively interested in the game (e.g. playing it). This allows a single blockchain
platform to support hundreds or thousands of complex games in parallel, because
each user is only required to do computations for the games they are using themselves.

(bold)
In some sense, this can be seen as (partial) sharding, namely sharding of computation
power and storage (but not of the raw blockchain data).
This model is in complete contrast to a monolithic platform like Ethereum, where
every full node (and thus miner) always has to perform all computations of the entire
network. Hence, a platform based on GSPs is highly scalable horizontally, while a
monolithic platform is not.
This split into a core layer andmultiple GSPs on top of it is sketched in Fig. 3: The
core blockchain corresponds to the bold parts in the diagram, i.e. blocks that contain
just some moves. Those moves are then used by two GSPs running on the platform
to derive the states S1 and S2 associated to each of the blocks. The ⊕ indicates the
state-transition function (game logic) for each game, which derives the new state
from the previous state and the current block’s moves.
Note that each GSP is purely local, and does not concern the core network at all.
This has an interesting consequence: Even if at some point in time no one is playing
a particular game at all, the game still carries on (it is unstoppable), although there
does not exist any instance of the current state at that time. If at a later time someone
starts playing again and runs the GSP, they will compute the game state for the entire
history (including those blocks when no GSPs were running) and “re-materialise”
the game world. This also means that unlike platforms that have a “one blockchain
per game” model (e.g. Planetarium [6]), there is no need to incentivise and worry
about nodes running GSPs all the time.
Let us also remark that the decoupling of states from a core blockchain (which
is used to achieve consensus) is not a completely new idea. A couple of overlay
protocols have been built on top of Bitcoin in the past, e.g. Mastercoin [29] (now
calledOmni) orCounterparty [22]. To the best of our knowledge, however, all of these
platforms were built to place a specific use case on top of Bitcoin and take advantage
of the Bitcoin network’s security. In our proposal, we use the overlay architecture for
a different purpose, namely for horizontal scaling of a custom blockchain. In a sense,
this can be compared rather to rollups, which have become the scaling solution of
choice inEthereum [3]: EachGSP can be thought of as its own rollup, except radically
Horizontal Scalability of Blockchain Games Using the GSP Model 85
simplified and not relying on any complex security assumptions and mechanisms to
bridge state back to the main chain.
5 Drawbacks of Game-State Decoupling
We have seen that decoupling the game state from the core network leads to drastic
improvements in scalability. On the other hand, it also means that the core network
does not and can not (by design) fully verify game-specific operations,which imposes
two main restrictions on games built with this architecture.
5.1 SPV Security
SPV (simplified payment verification; see [21]) is a method to run cryptocurrency
wallets without the need to download and verify the entire blockchain. It is used
by popular tools such as Electrum or mobile Bitcoin wallets. SPV wallets assume
that all transactions inside the longest (most work) chain of blocks are valid without
verifying them for themselves. This works as long as the majority of mining power
is honest, since miners have a strong incentive to only include valid transactions into
blocks (as discussed previously).
Strictly speaking, this of course remains true for GSP-based blockchains. How-
ever, for them SPV security obviously only applies to things validated by the core
network (e.g. CHI transactions and name operations in the case of Xaya). Since the
game-specific interpretation of move data is left to GSPs, the mere presence of a
particular move in the longest chain does not automatically imply that the move has
a particular effect on the game state or is even valid for a specific game.
For example, Alice could send a move that indicates “send a Vorpal sword to
Bob”, and it could be confirmed and included into the longest chain of blocks just
fine. However, it may still be invalid with respect to the game, e.g. because Alice
does not own such a sword. Hence, Bob must not rely on the sword being transferred
to him just because Alice’s transaction has been confirmed. Instead, he has to check
the game state himself by running a GSP.
However, it is still possible to build mobile and light clients for GSP-based games
(just not with the SPV technique alone). Depending on the desired balance between
decentralisation and convenience, users may simply trust a remote GSP that is run
by the game developer, especially if they do not yet have a lot of money at stake
inside the game. If their interest and stake in the game increases, they can at any later
time decide to run their own GSP for more security and reliability instead. The game
developer (or a third party) can even provide ready-made VM or container images
for GSPs, so that also non-technical users are easily able to run their own GSP on a
cheap VPS and still play on mobile devices.
86 D. Kraft
It is even possible to design a system that allows for a balance between decentrali-
sation and convenience that is strictly between the two extremes of “trusting a single
remote GSP” and “running your own GSP”. For instance, users could query multiple
remote GSPs and only accept a current game state if all of them agree. Or the opera-
tors of remote GSPs could sign the states they deliver, so that a wrong answer can be
proven to the network; with this, it is possible to build a “GSP-as-a-service” system
based on deposits and penalties similar to some of the more recent proof-of-stake
consensus algorithms [2] or optimistic rollups like Arbitrum [17].
5.2 No Control Over the Coin
The second restriction implied by state decoupling is that GSPs and specific games
cannot control the native on-chain currency directly; this is in direct contrast to smart
contracts on monolithic platforms (e.g. contracts on Ethereum have their own ETH
balance). As coin transactions are part of the core network layer and thus need to be
validated by all nodes, it is not possible that any coin transfers are conditional on the
state of some game (which is not known by those nodes). It is, however, possible for
a GSP to observe coin transactions that happen on the core layer and then update the
game state accordingly (for instance, mint in-game assets whenever coins are paid
to the game developer’s address). This is a direct consequence of the unidirectional
flow of information between the two layers (from the core network to GSPs, but not
the other way round).
This restricts how value can flow into and out of games through the blockchain’s
native currency (especially for human-mining/play-to-earn games). It is, however,
possible to add a game-specific currency (e.g. gold pieces, credits, gems, …) to the
game state. Together with all other game assets, balances of this currency can then be
fully controlled by arbitrary rules coded into the GSP. As long as this game currency
can be exchanged to some fiat or other cryptocurrency, it will enable free flow of
value again.
The latter, finally, is easily possible: Centralised exchanges can integrate an in-
game currency just as easily as a “normal” cryptocurrency; all they have to do is
run the game’s GSP. Additionally, the core blockchain can be designed to facilitate
atomic trades between its coin and game assets, so that trustless and decentralised
exchanges can be built as well. In the case of Xaya, atomic name updates [18] can
be used for this purpose; they are based on atomic name trades originally proposed
for Namecoin [9].
6 Conclusion
We have seen that scalability is a major concern for blockchain projects in general,
but evenmore so for blockchain-based games.Monolithic approaches based on smart
Horizontal Scalability of Blockchain Games Using the GSP Model 87
contracts are popular for blockchain games today, but they lead to games that are
either centralised (with only assets on the blockchain) or have trivial rules and shallow
game play. In other words, Ethereum may not be the best choice for building a fully
decentralised game.
Hence, we proposed to decouple game-logic processing from the core blockchain
network. This GSP architecture improves horizontal scalability drastically and, in
particular, allows to build complex and still fully decentralised games. Game-state
decoupling comes not without its own trade-offs, though, as it means that the core
network is not aware of game-specific states and rules. This leads to some restric-
tions, but we believe that they can be dealt with very well in practice using, among
other techniques, atomic transactions for trading between the native coin of the core
blockchain and in-game assets.
With the methods described, it is possible to bring blockchain games to the next
level of their evolution, and build highly complex but still fully trustless, scalable
and decentralised games and applications.
