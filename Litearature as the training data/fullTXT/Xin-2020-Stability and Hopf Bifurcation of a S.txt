ABSTRACT The blockchain technology has been rapidly popularizing and gaining a quick mileage in
many domains owing to its innate nature, so there must be several tremendous market opportunities and
uncertainties for the blockchain cloud service. We propose a Cournot duopoly game in a blockchain cloud
services market for cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). Introducing Brownian noise disturbance to the
deterministic Cournot duopoly game, we construct a stochastic Cournot duopoly game in a blockchain
cloud service market with uncertainty. We analyze the stochastic stability of the Cournot duopoly game
by the Lyapunov exponent method, the Lyapunov function, and the singular boundary theory. Then we
investigate the stochastic Hopf bifurcation of the Cournot duopoly game by the invariant measure theory.
At last, we numerically validate these results by the probability density. These results of stability and Hopf
bifurcation illustrate complex behaviors of the stochastic Cournot duopoly game in the blockchain cloud
services market.

I. INTRODUCTION
Growing business interest in blockchain has been triggering
an enormous amount of research effort goes into blockchain
cloud services technology, such as blockchain-enabled
edge computation [1], blockchain-powered crowdsource [2],
blockchain-based cloudlet management for multimedia
workflow [3], cloud health resource sharing based blockchain
technology [4], privacy-friendly platform for healthcare
data [5], cloud-assisted secure eHealth systems via
blockchain [6], trustworthy blockchain-based multi-cloud
brokers [7], blockchain-based cloud data management [8].
In turn, arousing academic enthusiasm in blockchain has been
inspired by a significant number of demands for blockchain
cloud services technology. Over the past several years, several
companies, such as Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, Microsoft, and
Google, have invested billions into expanded infrastructure
to meet the market demand.
However, the efficiency of data processing has not
been able to satisfy the large-scale popularization of

blockchain technology. The main obstacle is to prevent
double-spending and to provide reliable protection against
51% attack. Considering a blockchain designed to achieve
real-time cooperation between critical systems, the long wait
time of confirmation or service request is unacceptable in
many real-time scenarios. Assuming that the collaboration
among data-intensive departments needs to be considered
now, the correctness of data, the efficiency of the process
and the responsibility of users are growing more and more
critical. Also, there will be problems such as poor sharing of
data flow, the conflict owing to data. Transmitting, updating
and other operating can cause data association by exposing
business logic and algorithms, which can lead to a wide range
of sensitive information leakage. There are many threats,
such as unauthorized data disclosure, access and modifica-
tion, inconsistencies and errors. Thus, such as block cloud
platform, a service systemwith reliable computing power and
high applicability must be created.
Meanwhile, the blockchain cloud service market comes
into being. The blockchain industry is developing in a sim-
ilar architecture to cloud computing. Through standardized
design, entities participating in the transaction can quickly

deploy and apply and pay more attention to value-added
services that can create higher added value.
The blockchain cloud-hosting space has the characteristics
of high investment cost, long payback period and high invest-
ment risks. The industry is currently very far from perfect
competition. We can regard the blockchain cloud services
market as an oligopoly because the market is dominated by
a handful of major players, where any new players of mean-
ingful size can seldom enter. For simplicity, we can employ
a duopoly game to depict the character of a blockchain cloud
services market.
There are many approaches can be used to depict duopoly,
such as a duopoly differential game for licensing to a competi-
tor [9], a continuous Bertrand duopoly game with fractional
delay and conformable derivative [9], a duopoly game in a
multilateral distribution platform [10], a Bertrand duopoly
game in an IoT market [11], a master-slave Bertrand game
model [12], a Cournot duopoly game with bounded ratio-
nality [13], a duopoly Bertrand game with environmental
taxes [14], a delayed duopoly model with bounded rational-
ity [15]. In brief, mentioned-above duopoly games are based
on assumptions of deterministic environment. However,
as such an industry with the characteristics of innovation
elements intensive, high investment risks, long investment
cycle, and intense competition, the blockchain cloud services
market must face too much uncertainty. We can employ the
Brownian motion to represent uncertainty [16], [17]. So it is
necessary for us to study stochastic versions of the duopoly
game.
The stochastic differential operator is a powerful tool to
describe duopoly game in uncertain environment [18]. There
are a lot of researches on stochastic game models and their
stability and bifurcation, such as the stochastic vocal folds
dynamical model [19], the hydro-turbine generator [20],
a 2-D stochastic differential equations with multiplicative
excitations [21], MWCNT-absorbing hydrogen atoms [22],
closed orbit equations [23], suspended wheelset system [24],
parabolic equations with multiplicative noise [25], a singular
delayed predator-prey model [26], a Marchuk’s model [27],
an Internet congestion control model [28], Hopfield neural
networks [29].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
We propose the stochastic Cournot duopoly game in
Section 2. We present some preliminary results in Section 3.
We analyze its local stochastic stability by the Lyapunov
exponent method and its global stochastic stability by the
singular boundary theory in Section 4. We investigate its
stochastic Hopf bifurcation by the invariant measure theory
in Section5. We illustrate the results by numerical simulation
in Section 6. We draw a conclusions in Section 7.
II. THE PROPOSED MODEL
Consider an oligopoly market of the blockchain cloud
service, including two firms named X and Y , each provides
one variety of differentiated blockchain cloud services. Let
x(t) and y(t) represent the quantities supplied by firms X
and Y , respectively. Each firm determines its optimal supply
quantities in the light of its expectations of its rival’s supply
quantities in the subsequent period. The following inverse
demand functions for the blockchain cloud services are given,
respectively.
px(t) = 1− x(t)− ky(t), py(t) = 1− kx(t)− y(t),
where the parameter k ∈ (−1, 1) denotes the extent to which
two kinds of blockchain cloud services are substitutes for
each other.
Consider the following linear supply cost functions of the
blockchain cloud services are given, respectively.
Cx(t) = c1x(t), Cy(t) = c1y(t),
where the parameter c1 are the marginal supply cost of the
blockchain cloud services.
Hence, the following profits of the two firm in the single
period are given, respectively.
5x(t) = x(t) (1− x(t)− ky(t)− c1) ,
5y(t) = y(t) (1− y(t)− kx(t)− c1) .
Thenwe can obtain the two firms’marginal profits as follows.
∂5x
∂x
= 1− c1 − 2x(t)− ky(t),
∂5y
∂y
= 1− c1 − 2y(t)− kx(t).
With the help of [30], we get the following gradient
adjustment processes of price.
dx(t)
dt
= ax(t) (1− c1 − 2x(t)− ky(t)) ,
dy(t)
dt
= by(t) (1− c1 − kx(t)− 2y(t)) ,
(1)
where a and b represent the quantity adjustment speeds of
firms X and Y , respectively.
Due to the influence of external environment such as
typhoons, tsunamis, infectious diseases and so on, the deter-
ministic system can no longer reflect the dynamic changes of
real problems. Considering the influence of uncertain factors,
stochastic systems are increasingly favored by researchers
and widely used in the analysis of practical problem.
Assuming that the variables x(t) and y(t) are subject to
different kinds of stochastic noise, we rewrite system (1) as
follows:{
dx(t) = ax(t) (c− 2x(t)− ky(t)) dt + σ1x(t)dB1(t),
dy(t) = by(t) (c− kx(t)− 2y(t)) dt + σ2y(t)dB2(t),
(2)
where dB1(t) and dB2(t) are derivatives of Brownian motion;
σ1 and σ2 are the intensity of the white noise; c = 1− c1.
When σ1 = σ2 = 0, Eqs. (2) degenerates into Eqs. (1)
which has four equilibria: E1 = (0, 0), E2 =
(
0, c
/
2
)
, E3 =
(c
/
2, 0), E4 =
(
c
/
(k + 2), c
/
(k + 2)
)
. Points E1, E2, and
E3 are bounded equilibria [31], while E4 is a non-bounded
equilibrium. Thus, we only analyze the stability of E4.

Proposition 1: The equilibrium E4 is stable when a, b and
c all are positive and k ∈ (−1, 1) hold.
Proof: We obtain the following Jacobian matrix of
system (1) evaluated at the non-bounded equilibrium E4.
J (E4) =

when a, b and c all are positive and k ∈ (−1, 1) hold.
It is proved.
As we know, noises could affect the stability so we analyze
the stability and bifurcation around the equilibrium E4 in the
following sections.

By setting the coordinate transformation x2 = r cos θ and
y2 = r sin θ , using the Khasminskii limit theorem and the
stochastic averaging method, we obtain the following Itô

dr = m1(r)dt + σ11(r)dWr (t)+ σ12(r)dWθ (t),
dθ = m2(r)dt + σ21(r)dWr (t)+ σ22(r)dWθ (t),

IV. THE STABILITY
There many theories can be employed to analyze the
stochastic stability, such as maximal Lyapunov exponent,
Lyapunov function, the singular boundary theory.
A. LOCAL STABILITY WITH THE MAXIMAL
LYAPUNOV EXPONENT
Under the condition u3 = 0, we consider the linear Itô
stochastic differential equation of system (8) as follows:
dr = (u1 +
1
4
u2)rdr + (u4r2)
1
2 dWr (t), (9)
Proposition 2:
(i) When u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 < 0, the trivial solution of
stochastic linear differential equation (9) is locally asymp-
totically stable, i.e. the nonlinear stochastic system (4) is
locally asymptotically stable at the origin in the meaning of
probability.
(ii) When u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 > 0, the trivial solution
of stochastic differential equation (9) is locally unstable,
i.e. the nonlinear stochastic system (4) is locally unstable at
the origin in the meaning of probability.
Proof: The solution of system (9) is
r(t) = r(0) exp

(u1 +

u2 −

u4)ds+
∫ t

Thus, the maximal Lyapunov exponent of system (9) is:
λ = lim
t→∞
1
t
ln ‖r(t)‖ =

2
(u1 +

4
u2 −

u4).
It is proved.
B. STOCHASTIC STABILITY WITH THE LYAPUNOV
FUNCTION
Proposition 3:
(i) When u3 = 0, the nonlinear stochastic differential
system (4) is stable at the origin with u1+ u2
/
4− u4
/
2 < 0,
and the system (4) is unstable at the origin with u1 + u2
/
4−
u4
/
2 > 0.
(ii) When u3 6= 0, the stochastic differential system (4) is
unstable at the origin.
Proof: For Eq. (8), we set the following amplitude func-
tions r(t) = eρ , ρ = ρ(r). According to the Itô stochastic
differential method, we obtain
dρ =

]
dt , dt
Thus, if u3 = 0 and its Lyapunov exponent λ = u1 +
1
4u2−
1
2u4 < 0 hold, then the nonlinear stochastic differential
system (4) is stable at the origin.
If λ = u1 + 1
4u2 −
1
2u4 > 0, then the nonlinear stochastic
differential system (4) is unstable at the origin.
If u3 > 0, r → 0, and its Lyapunov exponent λ = u1 +
1
4u2 −
1
2u4 + E
(
u3

)
> 0 hold, then the system is unstable
with r = 0.
It is proved.
C. GLOBAL STABILITY
1) GLOBAL STABILITY U3 = 0
Proposition 4:
(i) When u1+u2
/
4−u4
/
2 < 0, the stochastic differential
system (8) is globally stable at the trivial solution r = 0, then
the system (4) is globally stable at the origin.
(ii) When u1+u2
/
4−u4
/
2 > 0, the stochastic differential
system (8) is globally unstable at the trivial solution r = 0,
then the system (4) is globally unstable at the origin.
Proof: From the singular boundary theory, we get
(i) r = 0 is the first kind of singular boundary of
system (9).
When r → 0+, we can get the diffusion coefficient αl = 2,
drifting coefficient βl = 1, and characteristic value
Cl = lim
r→0+
2m(r)rαL−βL
σ 2(r)
=
4u1 + u2
2u4
.
So we can draw the following conclusions:
The left boundary r = 0 is exclusively natural if Cl > 1,
i.e. u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 > 0, and the left boundary r = 0 is
attractively natural if Cl < 1, i.e. u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 < 0,
and the left boundary r = 0 is strictly natural if Cl = 1, i.e.
u1 + u2
/
4− u4
/
2 = 0.
(ii) r → ∞ is the second kind of singular boundary of
system (9).
VOLUME 8, 2020 41435
B. Xin, Y. Wang: Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of a Stochastic Cournot Duopoly Game
We get the diffusion coefficient αr = 2, drifting coefficient
βr = 1, and characteristic value
Cr = lim
r→0+
−2m(r)rαL−βL
σ 2(r)
= −
4u1 + u2

.
So we can draw the following conclusions:
The right boundary r → ∞ is attractively natural if
Cr < −1, i.e. u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 > 0, and
the right boundary r → ∞ is exclusively natural if
Cr > −1, i.e. u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 < 0, and the right
boundary r → ∞ is strictly natural if Cr = −1,
i.e. u1 + u2
/
4− u4
/
2 = 0.
It is proved.
2) GLOBAL STABILITY WITH U3 6= 0
Proposition 5: The stochastic differential system (8) is
globally unstable at the trivial solution r = 0.
Proof: From the singular boundary theory, we get
(i) r = 0 is the regular boundary of system (8).
That is, it can enter the boundary from the inside as well as
from the boundary to the inside.
(ii) r → ∞ is the second kind of singular boundary of
system (8).
We get the diffusion coefficient αr = 2, drifting coefficient
βr = 1, and characteristic value
Cr = lim
r→0+
−2m(r)rαL−βL
σ 2(r)
= −
4u1 + u2
2u4
.
So we can draw the following conclusions:
The right boundary r →∞ is attractively natural if Cr <
−1, i.e u1+u2
/
4−u4
/
2 > 0, and the right boundary r →∞
is exclusively natural if Cr > −1, i.e. u1+u2
/
4−u4
/
2 < 0,
and the right boundary r →∞ is strictly natural if Cr = −1,
i.e. u1 + u2
/
4− u4
/
2 = 0.
It is proved.
Remark 1: Under the condition u3 = 0, (i) the sys-
tem (4) is both locally stable and globally stable when
u1 + u2
/
4 − u4
/
2 < 0; (ii) the system (4) is unstable when
u1+ u2
/
4− u4
/
2 > 0; (iii) in the system (4), the bifurcation
may occur near the origin when u1 + u2
/
4− u4
/
2 = 0.
Remark 2: Under the condition u3 6= 0, the system (4) is
unstable at the origin.
V. HOPF BIFURCATION
We can study stochastic bifurcations of a stochastic dynami-
cal system with noise by varying its parameter family. Since
the invariant measures is an essential characteristic value of
stochastic bifurcation [32], [33], we will study the p bifurca-
tion of stochastic differential equation by the extremum of its
steady state probability density function.
From the amplitude equation (8), we can obtain its corre-
sponding FPK equation as follows:

with the initial value p(r, t |r0, t0 ) → δ(r − r0), t → t0,
where p(r, t |r0, t0 ) is the transition probability density. The
invariant measure of diffusion process r(t) is the steady state
probability density p(r). We can obtain the following p(r)
by calculating the solution of the degenerate system when
∂p
∂t = 0.
p(r) = K exp

The steady state probability density p(r) can be
differentiated w.r.t. the diffusion process r(t) to obtain the
following equation:
dp
dr
= K
(
u3 + u4r2
)v−7/2
r2
[
3u3 + 2u4r2 (v− 1)
]
.
We can get r# = 0, r∗ =
√
3u3

(2u4 (1− v)) with v < 1

by setting dp

dr = 0.
The two following equations hold:

< 0,
(10)
We can obtain its maximum p(r∗) and the minimum
p(r#) = 0 from Eq. (10).
According to the Namachivaya’s theory, the sample
trajectory of system (8) stays for a longer time in the neigh-
borhood of r∗, i.e. system (8) is stable in the meaning of prob-
ability in the neighborhood of r∗, and the sample trajectory
stays in the neighborhood of r = 0 for a relatively short
time. That is, when the system (4) is subjected to random
excitation, the origin is unstable, which is consistent with
the results obtained from the singular boundary theory and
the Lyapunov function method. Stochastic Hopf bifurcation
occurs at r = r∗ (i.e. x2 + y2 = 3u3
/
(2u4 (1− v))) in the
stochastic nonlinear system (8).
VI. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
In this section, we set different parameter combinations to
show the occurrence probabilities and positions of the Hopf
bifurcation of the Cournot duopoly game in a blockchain
cloud services market for cyber-physical-social systems
(CPSS), as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.
Table 1 and Figure 1 show that, with the increase of random
excitations u3 > 0 as well as σ1 and σ2, their bifurcation
positions increase, but the probability densities of bifurcation
decrease. Figure 1 confirms the results from the singular
boundary theory, the Lyapunov exponent, and the invariant
measure theory. Therefore, we can regard u3 as a parameter
of stochastic Hopf bifurcation of the system (8).

VII. CONCLUSION
We present a Cournot duopoly game driven by Brownian
motion in a blockchain services market. Using the maximal
Lyapunov exponent, Lyapunov function, the singular bound-
ary theory, and the invariant measure theory, we discuss its
stochastic stability and Hopf bifurcation. At last, we numeri-
cally validate the above results by phase portraits.
The results mentioned above show that the stochastic
game model with Brownian noise is more realistic than its
VOLUME 8, 2020 41437
B. Xin, Y. Wang: Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of a Stochastic Cournot Duopoly Game
deterministic model. Furthermore, the Brownian noise can
change the stability condition of a deterministic system.
Besides, the Brownian noise disturbance is inevitable, so it
is more meaningful to research Hopf bifurcation at the equi-
librium of the stochastic dynamic game than that of the
deterministic system at the stability of the equilibrium. So we
can extend these results to analyze the effects of other kinds
of noises (such as Gaussian noise), and rewrite the two-
dimensional model to a multidimensional model with time
delays.
