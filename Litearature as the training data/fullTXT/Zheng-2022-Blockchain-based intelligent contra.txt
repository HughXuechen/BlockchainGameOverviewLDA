Abstract
Factoring business, an important aspect in the supply chain finance field, has significant
potential in adopting blockchain-based intelligent contract technology. Based on the exist-
ing theories of factoring business in supply chains, this paper conducts a coupling analysis
between blockchain technology and supply chain factoring business. Specifically, we pro-
pose the application scenarios of blockchain-based intelligent contract technology in the
supply chain factoring business from three aspects: the division and transfer of creditors’
rights certificate, the factoring financing of upstream suppliers, and the due payment of core
enterprises, and elaborate their implementation processes. Furthermore, from a game theo-
retical perspective, we analyze the mechanism of the key technology implementation of the
intelligent contract to verify whether the nodes on the blockchains will follow the relevant
protocols to automatically execute them. Finally, we conduct a three-way game analysis of
the supply chain factor financing process and obtain an equilibrium solution based on the
principle of utility maximization, which highlights the optimization effect of the intelligent
contract technology on the decision-making behavior of individual entities in the supply
chain.

1 Introduction
The whole world is embarking on a wave of blockchain craze. Various forces from
academia and industry have been enthusiastically involved in the blockchain development
and entrepreneurship tide.
Blockchain is a new decentralized infrastructure and distributed computing paradigm
that has emerged with the increasing popularity of bitcoin and other digital cryptocurren-
cies (Koutmos 2019). Featured with decentralization, timing data, collective maintenance,
programmability, security, and credibility, blockchain is particularly suitable for the construc-
tion of programmable monetary systems, financial systems, and even macro social systems
(Tapscott and Tapscott 2017). Blockchain technology enables the implementation of digital
currency, advanced intelligent contract, and other decentralized applications by providing
users with a flexible scripting code system (Romano and Schmid 2017). An intelligent con-
tract is a special type of embedded programming that runs in a reproducible shared computer
program block on chain data books (Helo and Hao 2019). Through active or passive ways to
accept, store, and process the data being sent, intelligent contracts take the control of all kinds
of chain intelligence assets and management functions (Wang et al. 2019). Considered as the
core element of the blockchain technology 2.0, the smart contract technology of blockchains
will be the focus of all industries in the near future, and this topic has become an increasing
area of scholarly interest (e.g., Bogner et al. 2016; Kosba and Miller 2019; Macrinici et al.
2018; Watanabe et al. 2015).
Factoring occurs frequently, but currently manual processing is generally adopted, so pro-
cessing speed tends to be slow, labor cost high, and existing management mode not suitable.
With the increasing demand for this business, and the organizational goals to achieve process
optimization, strengthen operation specification, reduce financing costs, and improve market
competitiveness, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent contract application system
to handle factoring accounting information, process improvement, and data management for
banks. The advance in blockchain technology, particularly intelligent contract technology,
provides an opportunity for the innovation and development of intelligent factoring (Hofmann
et al. 2017).
Although prior research has investigated factoring, blockchains, and smart contract tech-
nology, very few comprehensive studies exist on the combination of factoring and smart
contract technology with blockchains. Our paper addresses this research gap by system-
atically studying the factoring business model based on the smart contract technology of
blockchains. Specifically, this paper aims to analyze the application of blockchains in fac-
toring business, namely design of supply chain “smart factoring” systems with a simple
operation, low operation cost, and convenient financing advantage. This research contributes
to the existing and growing body of research in the field of supply chain factoring. Specifi-
cally, we propose the new business model of “intelligent factoring” of supply chain based on
blockchains through the fusing of supply chain factoring with blockchain intelligent contract
technology. Then, drawing on the practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (pBFT) algorithm and
the incentive compatibility mechanism, wemodel and analyze the key technology facilitation
of the supply chain “intelligent factoring” business model, demonstrating why upon obtain-
ing the Nash equilibrium, a rational node will always choose to follow protocol, facilitating
the automatic execution of the supply chain contract agreement in the intelligent factoring
business of supply chains. In addition, this paper provides practical guidance for both core
enterprises and upstream providers in supply chains to play a positive role, and for banks
(factor) to broaden their own supply chain downstream channels.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The following section reviews
prior literature by focusing on supply chain finance services, factoring, and the role of
blockchains. Section 3 proposes the supply chain intelligent factoring business model
by focusing on the coupling analysis between supply chain’s factoring and smart con-
tract of blockchains. Section 4 conducts an intelligent factoring game analysis at both
the technical level of blockchains as well as at the supply chain business level. The
last section concludes with a discussion of the paper’s contributions and implica-
tions.
2 Prior literature
This section reviews prior literature focusing on supply chain finance, factoring
business, and blockchain applications. In addition, we identify the research gap in
the existing literature and highlight the focus of our study and its main contribu-
tions.
Supply chain finance refers to the business that provide receivables, prepayments, and
inventory financing by connecting financial institutions, core enterprises, and upstream and
downstream enterprises (Deng and Yu 2017; Gelsomino et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2018). With the
continuous development and increasing maturity of the supply chain financial market, the
financial institutions (factoring companies) that handle the factoring business have begun to
highlight their specialization (Auboin et al. 2016), which demands that historical conditions
be reexamined for the application of factoring in supply chains. The core of supply chain
finance is composed of upstream suppliers, core enterprises, and downstream distributors.
Correspondingly, the essence of supply chain finance focuses on two receivables (Hofmann
and Zumsteg 2015), namely, receivables formed by upstream suppliers to core enterprises
and receivables formed by core enterprises to downstream distributors, as shown in Fig. 1.
As an effective way to deal with these two accounts receivable problems, a factor-
ing business across supply chains introduces funds to run raw material supply, prod-

uct production, and sales of goods (Caniato et al. 2019). The links around the core
enterprises allows them to expand their businesses to create supply chain downstream
channels and effectively grasp their credit advantage in supply chains; both can effec-
tively avoid risks to a certain extent and can extract additional customer resources (Song
et al. 2016). The increasing trend from the historical data shows a heavy burden to the
enterprises for their accounts receivable balances, especially to small and medium enter-
prises, so the supply chain factoring business plays an especially important role as the
main form of supply chain finance accounts receivable financing transactions (Jia et al.
2019).
The article “factoring” published by Jones (1936) is the earliest known reference to factor-
ing. Existing literature on factoringmainly focuses on its theoretical elaboration, emphasizing
the importance and necessity of factoring, the development status, and countermeasures of
addressing the issues in factoring. For example,Glinavos (2002) elaborated on the process and
system of factoring and pointed out that factoring is not only a financing tool, but also a ser-
vice combination. Klapper (2006) analyzed the unique advantages of international factoring
as an innovative international settlement business and highlighted its crucial importance for
economic development and growth. Through quantitative analysis of financial data, Gustin
(2005) confirmed the feasibility of carrying out supply chain factoring financing business in
small and medium-sized enterprises and elaborated its business process and system in detail.
As for other aspects, Summers and Wilson (2000) took British enterprises as the research
object and empirically showed that British enterprises generally regard factoring as financing
resources. Wuttke et al. (2013) argued that reverse factoring is not only a financing tool but
also a service combination. They pointed out that the premise of business development is
that the financing cost of the buyer as the initiator is not higher than the corresponding cost
of the supplier.
As a new type of database systems, blockchains bring new technology choices to the
development of many fields related to database applications (Saberi et al. 2019), for instance,
accounting and assurance (Dai and Vasarhelyi 2017), customer order management (Martinez
et al. 2019), human resource management (Wang et al. 2017), manufacturing systems (Li
et al. 2018), marketing (Liu et al. 2019), medical records storage (Chen et al. 2019), and
smart city network architecture (Sharma and Park 2018).
The supply chain finance service industry’s highly digital nature makes it an extremely
applicable concept for blockchain applications (Fosso Wamba et al. 2019), due to the decen-
tralization, distributed billing, and security features in blockchains (Aitzhan and Svetinovic
2016). The fusion of supply chain finance services with blockchains will bring great promise
to form a new development model. To the extent that smart contract is the core technology of
blockchains (Governatori et al. 2018; Chang et al. 2019) and factoring is an important aspect
of supply chain finance services (Abbasi et al. 2017; Liebl et al. 2016), the combination of
the factoring with smart contract will significantly facilitate the innovative development of
the supply chain finance service industry.
Prior research has explored the design and working mechanisms of blockchain-based
smart contracts as well as their applications in various areas including patient monitoring in
healthcare (Griggs et al. 2018), real estate (Karamitsos et al. 2018), and supply chains (Dolgui
et al. 2020). However, very few prior studies have comprehensively integrated blockchain
smart contract technology in supply chain factoring business. Our research makes contri-
butions to the existing literature by exploring the application of blockchains in factoring
business through proposing and analyzing a supply chain “smart factoring” system based on
blockchains.

3 Supply chain intelligent factoring business model
3.1 Definition of supply chain’s factoring
Supply chain’s factoring constitutes the business in which banks and other supply chain
participants together deal with the financial institutions of factoring business (factor) and
upstreamsupplier (seller).With a comprehensive institutional arrangement between the banks
and upstream suppliers, a negotiated agreement transfers the creditor’s rights (receivables) of
the core enterprise (trader) to banks (factor), and the bank (factor) is responsible for providing
financing and accounts receivable collection, credit risk control, and other services.
3.2 Basic process of supply chain’s factoring
The basic process of supply chain’s factoring is shown in Fig. 2.
1. The upstream supplier and the core enterprise negotiate an agreement to provide goods
or services to the core enterprise and standardize the preparation of invoices and other
related documents to form accounts receivable.
2. The supplier applies to the bank (factoring) for factoring business and submits the appli-
cation materials as required.
3. The bank conducts due diligence on the operation and other basic information of financ-
ing enterprises, confirms the authenticity of accounts receivable, and notifies the core
enterprise of the assignment of accounts receivable in written form.
4. The bank signs a factoring contract with the upstream suppliers, provides factoring ser-
vices to the suppliers according to the proportion stipulated in the contract (up to 80%),
and opens a special financing account to record the financing details, etc.
5. The upstream suppliers will use the financing from banks to purchase raw materials and
engage in production and processing.
6. The bank in a timely manner collects the accounts receivable due to the core enterprise
being issued a notice of payment requirements.
7. Core enterprises receive payments for products sold by distributors.
8. Core enterprises shall remit the money directly to the designated account of the bank
according to the amount specified in the agreement.
9. After deducting financing capital and interest and fees related to factoring service, the
bank will transfer the balance of accounts to the account of the upstream suppliers.

3.3 Coupling between supply chain’s factoring and smart contract of blockchains
Although factoring has made great progress in recent years in the context of supply chains, it
still faces a number of shortcomings, including centralized credit grantingmechanisms, ardu-
ous separation and transfer of certificates such as contract and creditor’s right, cumbersome
business processes, and difficulty in connection with business systems.
Supply chain finance aims to integrate information flow, capital flow, and logistics, where
its most important task is the integration of information flow. The introduction of blockchain
technology can get through the underlying data, so as to solve the problem that industry has
been suffering in supply chain finance. In factoring, supply chain upstream suppliers, the core
enterprise, and the banks (factor) participating in the trading scenes are closely aligned with
the blockchain scenarios, which can be accomplished through specific blockchain applica-
tions, as shown in Table 1.
Table 1 shows that the problems existing in developing supply chain’s factoring businesses
can be solved to a certain extent through the three major technologies of blockchains (dis-
tributed ledger, asymmetric encryption algorithm, and consensus mechanism), with the role
of intelligent contract as the core blockchain technology. To provide the script blockchain
code system as technical support, the contract for intelligent information processing and
data storage mechanism, as well as a fully functional state machine, its working principle is
similar to computer programs “If–Then” programming statements. Specifically, a few of the
trigger conditions are compiled in advance to be satisfied by future events between nodes.
Based on the reliable data and information maintained in the chain, intelligent contract will
automatically perform the corresponding terms of the contract, as shown in Fig. 3.
The specific application of smart contract of blockchains in supply chain’s factoring is
mainly divided into three aspects: the segmentation and transfer of credit certificates, the
factoring financing of upstream suppliers, and the payment due of core enterprises, as shown
in Table 2.
The factoring service contract is primarily based on the agreement between the core
enterprise and the bank. When the contract is due for payment, it will be executed by the
intelligent mechanism embedded in the supply chain’s factoring contract, which enables
more effective implementation.
In summary, with blockchains as the underlying supporting technology, distributed
peer-to-peer network structure is used to realize the existence of decentralized units and
synchronous sharing of information. The timestamp and consensus algorithm is applied
to solve data trace and information updates, granting access to critical data protection and
password algorithms. Using intelligent contract programming that features standard business
transactions, the factoring business model in the supply chain enriches innovation. Therefore,
it is of great practical significance to integrate the smart contract technology of blockchains
into the supply chain factoring to form the “smart factoring” business model of supply chain
based on blockchains.
4 Game analysis of supply chain intelligent factoring business model
Following the analysis of the intelligent factoring businessmodel in supply chains, this section
proposes and analyzes a game theoretical model to study the intelligent contract operation
mechanisms at both the technical and business level.

4.1 Analysis at the technical level
We first investigate the activities of the nodes in the supply chain from the technical level.
Specifically, we construct an automation mechanism game model to study if the nodes in the
supply chain will follow the agreements in the intelligent factoring business model to ensure
they are automatically executed, so as to fulfill the intelligent business processes.
4.1.1 Model background
The core nodes in supply chain factoring include core enterprise, upstream supplier, and bank
(factoring). Eachmember’smanagement information system (MIS) has different information
modules that can be divided into six parts: information collection, transmission, storage, pro-
cessing, maintenance, and use. To ensure the sound operations of the tripartite supply chain,
we assume that information asymmetry exists only between the three types of participants,
but not within each enterprise. In other words, the five information management modules
(i.e., information collection, transmission, storage, processing, and maintenance) all perform
normal operations, whereas the “information use” module conducted by an individual enter-
prise is highly subjective, so there may exist default. Therefore, in the blockchain-based
supply chain “intelligent factoring” business, each information module in the core enter-
prise, upstream supplier, bank (factoring) and their own internal system connected to the
blockchain network are accounting nodes, namely, core enterprise nodes CP1, CP2, …, CPi,
supplier nodes SP1, SP2, …, SPj, and bank nodes BP1, BP2, …, BPk . Due to the limitations
of the existing technology, a blockchain network system with distributed nodes in the present
stage is not fully mature. Not all the nodes will voluntarily follow related rules to generate a
constantly add block “correct” chain; there is still a “witch attack”, i.e., a small number of
nodes’ behavior does not conform to the system requirements to achieve the goals of common
interest. Therefore, pBFT algorithm provides a feasible solution to address such issue, while
the “incentive compatibility” mechanism design can be introduced as the reward/punishment
constraints to induce the nodes’ appropriate behavior.

Castro andLiskov (1999) propose the pBFTalgorithmwhich includesmajor elements such
as a primary (master) node, other regular (backup) nodes which may fail, and requests and
replies by nodes. The essence of pBFT is to broadcast accurate information to nodes through
rounds of communication. Specifically, after the master node receives a request from a client
(a regular node), it will copy the request and broadcast it to all the backup nodes to invoke the
service operation request. Each node summarizes and analyzes the information it receives,
and then send a reply to the client. According to the rule that the minority is subordinate to
the majority, the backup nodes that account for a large proportion will eventually process
the requested information when each node represents one vote. By this time, Byzantium’s
fault-tolerant calculation will have been completed. The pBFT assumes that at least 2/3 of the
nodes can genuinely participate in the analysis of consensus algorithm in the whole algorithm
execution process, that is, the number of malicious nodes shall not exceed 1/3 of the total
number of nodes in order to fulfill the normal operation of the distributed node network
system of blockchain. With the notation used in this paper, we denote R ≥ 3F + 1, where
R represents the total number of nodes and F the total number of malicious (failure) nodes.
The formula that calculates the number of master node is p � i mod|R|, where i represents
the view number, p is the copy of the label, |R| denotes total number of copies, and mod is
the operation of dividing integer i by the integer |R| and then taking the remainder.
Hurwicz’s (1973) theory of incentive compatibility entails the goal of the theory is to
maximize individual and collective interests by changing the behavior choice of economic
individuals through appropriate institutional arrangements (Hurwicz 1973; Myerson 1979).
To follow the rules of the system, accounting nodes will be given an incentive, or otherwise
an equity deduction as the punishment, so as to ensure the normal operations of the system.
Specifically, the total incentives refer to the external introduction of the initial endowment U
to define the utility, so the initial incentive distribution for each node isU/R. The punishment
mechanism is that the initial reward will be deducted according to the number of enemies
made by the accounting node when it conducts behaviors against the system—adopting
malicious strategies.
Based on the above setting, we synthesize the important elements from the pBFT algorith-
m—the client and the node of charge to an account—as well as the reward and punishment
instrument from incentive compatibility mechanism and include them in our model frame-
work. In particular, our model considers a network that consists of the nodes represented
by the banks, the core enterprises, and the upstream suppliers; the request sent by nodes
will reach a consensus based on the algorithm and the corresponding reward/punishment
intelligent contracts.
4.1.2 Model assumptions and variables
Following upon the discussion of our model setting, we next summarize the assumptions and
variables in our model.
1. We assume that the total number of nodes participating in bookkeeping, including banks,
core enterprises, upstream suppliers, and information modules in the system is R. All
nodes with malicious policies are represented by f , where f ∈ R, | f | < F , and F is
the upper limit of the number of nodes to take malicious policies. Our above analysis
shows that for participating companies, the failure of their information management
module nodes may happen to the node for each participating company and its use of the
information management module. Therefore, the total number of failure nodes within the
123

supply chain system is no more than 3×2 � 6 and the total number of nodes R is 6×3
+ 3 � 21, which meets the basic condition R ≥ 3F + 1.
2. We suppose that a client submits the request to the master node through the p2p network
system, and the master node later voluntarily informs the backup nodes of the whole
network about the request in detail. The backup nodes, including the master node, will
perform a limited round of consensus algorithm operations on the request and feed the
execution result back to the client. Among them, the operation of each round of consensus
algorithm is a dynamic game of complete information, that is, any node can decide its own
strategy selection by observing the behavior of others, and the interests between nodes
will affect each other. Node x and node y represent two arbitrary nodes in R, where,
x �� y.
3. We assume that any node in the consensus algorithm defining the rational behavior of
running must send the message received from the master node to the rest of the nodes.
According to the corresponding rules, forwarding message node will be marked; once
a node is marked as bad, it will be marked as bad state, and cannot be modified (threat
strategy) in the rest of the running consensus algorithm. Any node should mark the status
label of other nodes before running the consensus algorithm. At the end of the running
of the consensus algorithm, all nodes report the observed status of the other nodes to
the intelligent contract. If the rational node x observes that y is good, it reports to the
intelligent contract where g represents the performing party, otherwise it reports to the
intelligent contract where b represents the defaulting party (in this case, y is bad and x
will not send messages to y later), that is, x will behave honestly. The node is represented
by m, and the cost of each message must be sent to node y. M is the maximum cost of
all messages sent to node y by x after the execution of the finite number of rounds of the
consensus algorithm.
4. We assume that intelligent contracts contain the compiled rights and interests of all nodes
in the initial state and cover matters such as distribution and transformation rules, leading
to the conditions of the contract execution. Smart contracts have been received from
all the nodes y ∈ R; default party reports to complete the particular events. Choice of
action under particular situations need to follow the rules of the system that charge to
an account node and give incentives as well as punishment. On the basis that the initial
award allocation for each node is U/R, the smart contract will wait for the report of the
defaulting party to be received by all nodes y ∈ R. Once this step is completed, the
smart contract will continue to deduct the reward of each node x from the report of each
node y( y ∈ R − {x}); the reward of this node will be deducted according to the number
of defaulters produced by node x. In other words, if y reports to the smart contract that
x is the defaulting party, x’s reward will be deducted according to a constant λ, which
results in the maximum cost of x being R * λ, and the total deductible amount is R2 *
λ. This leads to an additional assumption which is U > R2 ∗ λ. We let SxR represent
the status of each node, including each node x and each node y( y ∈ R − {x}), sent
by each node x(x ∈ R) to the intelligent contract after the operation of the consensus
algorithm in finite rounds. There are two states: g, representing the performing party, or
b, representing the defaulting party. Sxy represents the state in which x chooses y (the
state information about each node y that each node x reports to the intelligent contract).
If x observes that y is good, then Sxy � g. After receiving SRx from each node y, the smart
contract starts to allocate rewards rx to node x, i.e., ∀x ∈ R, rx � U
R − ∑
y∈R−{x} C
y
x .
In addition, C y
x is defined as the reporting cost incurred by the intelligent contract on x
123

after receiving the Syx message set about node x(x ∈ R) reported by all nodes y. When
∀x, y ∈ R, Sxy � gΛSxy � g,Cx
y � 0. In all other cases, the reported cost is λ.
5. We assume that rational actors are risk-averse and do their best to maximize their utility
in the worst-case scenario, where all malicious nodes adopt a malicious strategy. The
malicious strategy means that x is good for y, but node y always reports the bad status of
node x to the smart contract, that is, y is dishonest.
4.1.3 Analysis and results
Against the backdrop of the supply chain “intelligent factoring” of blockchains, we construct
the game model to fulfill the intelligent contract technology. The whole game process is
composed of the following three components.
1. participants: rational node and malicious node.
2. strategic space for each participant: either following the protocol or deviating from the
protocol.
3. revenue (cost) function of each participant: total cost� information cost + reporting cost.
Participants including the core enterprise, upstream suppliers, banks (factor), and their
information management modules in the system are the bookkeeping nodes, which can be
divided into two types of participants: (1) honestly reporting to the intelligent contract the
performance of other nodes, and (2) always reporting to the intelligent contract other nodes’
status as the malicious nodes. The strategic choice for each node is either “following agree-
ment” or “not following agreement”,which corresponds to “performance” or “default”. Every
node in the blockchains is to maximize its own utility, taking into account the minimum cost
into its goal. Verifying the interaction message transmissions, each node is to report back to
the intelligent contract other node status while incurring an information cost. The rational
nodes usually choose to abide by the agreement to make it automated.
1. Cost boundary value λ
Assuming that the rational node is always trying to maximize its utility in the worst-case
scenario, we consider the case where all nodes y ∈ R − {x} are taking a malicious strategy
(the worst-case scenario mentioned above), where y is good for x, but Sxy ��Syx .
Strategy ∅1: node x sends a message to each node y ∈ R − {x}.
Strategy ∅2: node x randomly sends messages (1 − ω) to y ∈ R − {x}.
In order for a rational node x to always choose the desired strategy ∅1 desired, the total
utility of strategy ∅1 should not be less than that of strategy ∅2, i.e.,
U(∅1) ≥ U(∅2),
which is equivalent to
U − (R − 1) ∗ M − F ∗ λ ≥ U − (F + (R − 1 − F) ∗ (ω)) ∗ λ
− (R − 1) ∗ (1 − ω) ∗ M,
or
(R − 1 − F) ∗ ω ∗ λ ≥ (R − 1) ∗ ω ∗ M,
leading to the following condition,
λ ≥ R − 1
R − 1 − F
M . (1)
123

790 Annals of Operations Research (2022) 308:777–797
If the rational node x chooses to send messages to some nodes not according to the rules,
the extra reporting cost can balance the cost saved by not forwarding messages. λ is therefore
set to be x’s marginal value between the cost of the message and the cost of the report.
2. Equilibrium analysis
Lemma 1 If all nodes y( y ∈ R − {x}) follow a malicious strategy, (R − 1) ∗ M + F ∗ λ
is the lowest cost x can afford.
Proof If all nodes y( y ∈ R − {x}) follow the malicious strategy, Sxy ��Syx , x will minimize
its cost by sending no message. At this time, the message cost of x is 0, and only the report
cost is left, which is also the total cost of x at this time (R − 1) ∗ λ.
(R − 1) ∗ λ � (R − 1 − F) ∗ λ + F ∗ λ
� (R − 1 − F)(R − 1)
(R − 1 − F)
M + F ∗ λ
� (R − 1) ∗ M + λ. (2)
�
Lemma 2 If x follows the relevant agreement, the maximum cost of x will always be y
( y ∈ R − {x}) regardless of the strategy adopted by node factory (R − 1) ∗ M + F + λ.
Proof The worst-case scenario for the rational node x is when all y adopts a malicious
strategy, in which case, because all y is good for x, all messages will be sent to y according
to the protocol, and the message cost (R − 1) ∗ M will be incurred. In addition, as for each
malicious node y, Sxy ��Syx , x also has to bear the total reporting cost F*λ, so the total cost
of node x is (R − 1) ∗ M + F ∗ λ. �
Theorem 1 The rational node x always chooses to follow the protocol to minimize its own
cost.
Proof According to Lemmas 1 and 2, the minimum cost of x in the case of non-compliance
is the same as the maximum cost in the case of compliance. In other words, no matter what
strategy y takes, x always follows the protocol to send messages, which can also maximize
its benefits, that is, follow the optimal strategy that the protocol is x. Therefore, x will
anticipate the lowest cost (maximum utility) in the worst-case scenario by following the
relevant protocol. So, any rational node x will always follow the protocol. �
When the malicious node chooses to perform the contract, the default cost of the rational
node [(R − 1) ∗ λ] is greater than or equal to the performance cost [(R − 1) ∗ M + F ∗ λ],
so performance is the optimal choice of the rational node. When the malicious node chooses
to breach the contract, it is also the same. The optimal choice is still to perform the contract,
so no matter what strategy the malicious node takes, the optimal choice of the rational node
is to perform the contract, that is, to follow the protocol to send the message. However, when
the rational node chooses to perform the contract, the performance cost [(R − 1) ∗ M] of the
malicious node is far greater than the default cost (0), so it will choose to breach the contract.
When the rational node chooses to default, the malicious node still realizes a smaller cost
when it defaults, so it always chooses to default; the Nash equilibrium solution is obtained as
performance plus default, that is, the rational node chooses to perform and themalicious node
chooses to default. Through the above analysis, the total number of nodes and the number
123

LE
Annals of Operations Research (2022) 308:777–797 791
of malicious nodes meet the condition R ≥ 3F + 1, for which the normal operation of the
blockchain system is the basic guarantee. The strict enforcement of the extremely costly
punishment mechanism makes the vast majority of attacks difficult to succeed. Unless the
malicious nodes would like to go to destruction, the system will always be in conformity
with the economics principle of “self-interest”. Therefore, the normal operation of the system
can be fully realized on the premise of satisfying the condition R ≥ 3F + 1 as well as the
incentive and punishmentmechanism designedwithin the blockchain system. In other words,
from the perspective of block chain technology, the important role of blockchain technology
for facilitating business processes is demonstrated through the idea of game theory, which
can ensure the intelligent execution of its business process, so as to improve the transaction
processing efficiency.
4.2 Analysis at the business level
4.2.1 Basic assumptions and variable interpretation
1. The banks, core enterprises, and upstream enterprises involved in factoring financing are
all assumed to be rational economic entities and risk averse. We denote b as the bank, c
the core enterprise, and s the supplier.
2. The “default” strategy adopted by the supplier and the core enterprise is assumed to be
independent, so the bank only needs to consider whether the core enterprise defaults or
not and whether the small and medium-sized enterprise defaults.
3. We assume that the supplier of core enterprise supply the form of accounts receivable
creditor’s rights with the corresponding amount Rs, bank factoring service rates is k, the
payment days of factoring claims thefinancing deadline as ts, and vendorfinancing project
investment return is rs. When the supplier is bankrupt due to the abnormal operation
such that the repayment default probability is Ps, it does not need to bear the cost of
default payments for Cs, including fines, reputational damage, etc. The loan interest
rate of the bank is rb, while the deposit interest rate is r0. The total cost of collecting
all kinds of information involved in the pre-loan stage and implementing supervision
in the middle and post-loan stage is Cb. The return rate of the core enterprise can be
obtained by extending the repayment term rc, and the agreed repayment term tc. The
default probability of the core enterprise may be Pc, the default cost is Cc, and the
additional default cost considering the impact of blockchain is Cl. In addition, in the
credit accumulation environment formed by long-term supply chain cooperation, the
credit income that member enterprises can obtain is E, where t s, t c,Cs,Cc,Cl , E >
0, 0 < k, r0, rb, r s, rc, Ps, Pc < 1, and r0 < rb.
4.2.2 Analysis and results
Based on the above assumptions, this paper considers that the bank agrees to lend money
to the upstream supplier as the default premise, because in the case that the bank does not
lend money, no matter how the core enterprise and the upstream supplier make decisions,
their benefits do not exist and the game cannot be played. Next, this paper mainly studies the
returns of the participants under different decisions after the bank chooses to lend, that is,
after the game enters the second stage. According to the assumption that the core of corporate
defaults and supplier defaults are independent of each other, the bank only needs to default
core enterprise and suppliers. Considering whether the default state if one of the four (1)

RETRACTED A
RTIC
LE
792 Annals of Operations Research (2022) 308:777–797
reimbursement & payment; (2) reimbursement & no reimbursement, (3) no reimbursement
& payment; (4) no payments & no reimbursement, the tripartite game results can be obtained.
When the bank chooses not to lend, the income of the three parties is 0 and the game ends.
When the bank chooses a loan, the income matrix of the three parties is shown in Table 3
(from top to bottom, banks, core enterprises, and suppliers).
Member enterprises are facedwith two choices of strategies: repayment or non-repayment.
They pursue the maximization of their utility based on the amount of income. If the income
exceeds the non-repayment, the optimal strategy of member enterprises is “repayment”.
When the core enterprise chooses “non-repayment”, there exists:
R(repayment) − R(non-repayment) � (1 − k)Rs(r s − rb)t s
− Rs − [
(1 − k)Rs(1 + r s t s) − Cs − C−Rs
] � Cs + C−2(1 − k)Rs(1 + rbt s). (3)
When the core enterprise chooses “repayment”, the supplier:
R′(repayment) − R′(non-repayment) � (1 − k)Rs(r s − rb)t s + E
− [(1 − k)Rs(1 + r s t s) − Cs − Cl ] � Cs + C+E − (1 − k)Rs(1 + rbt s). (4)
As long as the default cost is large enough, no matter if the core enterprise defaults or not,
the supplier will not default and choose to repay on time. At this point, the optimal strategy
of the supplier is “repayment”.
On the premise that the supplier has chosen its optimal strategy “repayment”, the strategic
choice of the core enterprise is analyzed as follows:
R′(repayment) − R′(non-repayment) � rct cRs + E − [Rs(1 + rct c) − Cc − Cl ] > 0
(5)
As long asCc+Cl+E > R, the optimal strategy of the core enterprise is also “repayment”.
In supply chain services, factoring financing needs financing upstream suppliers and core
enterprise to form a long-term relationship rather than one-off cooperation, so the enterprise
credibility is very important to develop a complete set of supply chain enterprises. When an
enterprise’s credit is accepted by other enterprises on the supply chain, this can significantly
influence the enterprise’s behavior and resulted changes. If a member enterprise chooses
default due to short-term interests, other its credit will be reduced by other enterprises in
the supply chain when they hear the news about the enterprise’s credit rating. When the
enterprise’s credit is reduced to a certain degree, other enterprises in the supply chain will
cancel the cooperation with it, so that the company was forced to withdraw from the supply
chain and seek new cooperative partners. But, at the same time, the enterprise’s reputation is
affected. To find new partners, they will encounter the same obstacles, thus paying a painful
price. This consequence significantly reduces the number ofmember enterprises in the supply
chain that will default. Therefore, as long as the loss of reputation cost is large enough, a
member enterprise, as a rational economic person, will not default; it will choose to repay on
time to maximize its utility. In a blockchain environment, in the event of breach and default
to make data modification, information after fabrication and malicious behavior can lead to a
high information cost, such as that when its default behavior is once discovered by other node
enterprises. So, the broadcast brought about by the additional cost of default (reputational
damage, etc.) will do more harm to the member enterprise than good; the loss ratio in a
simple supply chain environment is more serious. As a result, the supplier/core business has
no incentive to default, and the bank no longer has to worry about being cheated or defaulting
afterwards (even if the default is a low probability event).

5 Conclusion
As a decentralized database technology, the application of blockchains in the field of supply
chain finance merits more attention from both industry and academia. The decentralized and
distributed characteristics of billing and securitywith blockchainsmaintain a good fitwith the
financial supply chain concept. Factoring is the foundation of supply chain in the financial
sector. Intelligent contracts are considered a key part of blockchains. The combination of
these two is bound to accelerate the factoring in the innovation and development of supply
chain.
5.1 Theoretical contributions
Prior research has studied factoring, blockchain, and smart contract technology to varying
degrees, but there are very few comprehensive studies on the combination of factoring and
blockchain smart contract technology. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperative
development of factoring and smart contract technology of blockchains to conduct relevant
and systematic research. Our study constitutes an initial step that we hopewill motivate future
research in this area.
Against this backdrop, this paper represents an attempt to begin a preliminary discussion
and analysis on these issues. First, we propose the application idea of combining supply
chain factoring and blockchain intelligent contract technology, and then elaborate the new
businessmodel of “intelligent factoring” of supply chain based onblockchains. Then, drawing
on game theory with a focus on the technical level of blockchains, we model and analyze the
key technology realization part of the supply chain “intelligent factoring” business model,
demonstrating why each node can automatically execute terms in the supply chain intelligent
factoring business. Based on the pBFT algorithm and the incentive compatibility mechanism,
we introduce the related background, where each node (including banks, core enterprises,
upstream suppliers, and the informationmodules)makes a strategic choice by considering the
reward andpunishment factor, aiming at aminimal cost.Uponobtaining theNash equilibrium,
the results show that a rational node will always choose to follow protocol, facilitating
the automatic execution of the supply chain contract agreement in the intelligent factoring
business of supply chains, which proves from the technical perspective the importance of
blockchains in fulfilling the business processes.
Second, from the perspective of supply chain operations, our research considers the effects
of blockchains on the tripartite game analysis process of supply chain factoring financing,
taking utility maximization as the goal for the equilibrium—lending, reimbursement, and
payment. From a business perspective, we reveal how the blockchain technology can be
utilized to optimize the decision-making behavior of main participants, which could make
their decision-making more rational, realize the three-side equilibrium solution, and promote
the virtuous cycle of business operations. Through the game analysis of the above two aspects,
our research finds that blockchains can play an extremely important role in ensuring the
smooth operations of supply chain factoring business, acting on both the business process
objects and the decision-making subjects.
5.2 Practical contributions
This study also offers several important contributions to practitioners. First, our contributions
begin with the recognition that factoring occurs frequently, but at present it is generally
123
RETRACTED A
RTIC
LE
Annals of Operations Research (2022) 308:777–797 795
handled by hand, so the processing speed is slow, the labor cost is high, and the management
mode is not suitable. With the demand for this business continues to increase and the goals
to achieve process optimization, strengthen operation specification, enhance risk aversion,
reduce financing costs, and improve market competitiveness, banks have an urgent need to
design, develop, and implement an intelligent application system to manage the factoring
business accounting data, information, and process. The blockchain technology, especially
the smart contract technology, provides an opportunity for the innovation and development
of smart factoring. Our study helps to advance the increasing recognition of the importance
of this opportunity.
Second, our paper offers additional practical implications in supply chain finance. Aiming
to integrate information flow, capital flow, and logistics, the most important task of supply
chain finance is the integration of information flow. Factoring across supply chains is a good
way to deal with accounts receivable problems by introducing funds to sustain raw material
supply, product production, and sales of goods. The introduction of blockchain technology
can streamline the underlying data, so as to solve the problem that industry has been suffering
in supply chain finance. In factoring, supply chain upstream suppliers, the core enterprise,
and the banks (factor) participating in the trading scenes need to be closely aligned with the
blockchain scenarios, which can be accomplished through specific blockchain applications.
Finally, with blockchains being adopted as the underlying supporting technology,
distributed peer-to-peer network structure can be deployed to realize the existence of
decentralized units and synchronous sharing of information. The timestamp and consen-
sus algorithm can be applied to enable data trace and information updates, granting access
to critical data and password protection. Using intelligent contract programming that stan-
dardizes business transactions, the factoring business model in the supply chain enriches
innovation. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to integrate the smart contract tech-
nology of blockchains into the supply chain factoring to form the “smart factoring” business
model of supply chain based on blockchains.
5.3 Limitations and future research directions
Although our research makes some significant contributions to the existing literature, it is
subject to some limitationswhich provide goodopportunities for future research. For instance,
the framework and mechanism we proposed are mostly at a conceptual level. Future research
can conduct specific case analysis or relevant empirical studies to verify the efficacy of the
suggested framework and derive additional practical implications and guidelines. In addition,
our research only focuses on the benefits of blockchains in factoring business. Future research
should also investigate the possible negative impact of blockchain applications in factoring
business as well as the challenges of implementing such applications.
