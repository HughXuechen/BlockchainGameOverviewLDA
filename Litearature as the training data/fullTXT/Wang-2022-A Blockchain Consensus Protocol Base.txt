�e blockchain is a distributed storage system of digital assets. �is decentralized, non-copyable technology stems from universal
standard password algorithm and the consensus mechanism of the game theory. �e development of quantum computing poses
threat to traditional algorithms of blockchain encryption, including symmetric encryption and hash encryption. Focusing on the
traditional blockchain consensus mechanism, this paper designs a new blockchain consensus mechanism, based on the sto-
chasticity, irreversibility, and uncertainty of quantummeasurement. In the proposed consensus mechanism, complex calculations
and intractability mathematical problems are abandoned. In this way, a huge amount of computing resources is saved, less energy

withstand 51% attacks.
1. Introduction
Currently, blockchain has been applied in various �elds,
such as �nance, industry, logistics, Internet of �ings
(IoT), copyright protection, and data sharing [1–7]. �e
application scenarios of blockchain provide a high level of
data security. To realize decentralization, the blockchain
system ensures that consensus tasks are completed
without involving third-parties and guarantees the
highest level of fault tolerance. �e de�ning features of the
system are transparency, credibility, tamper-proofness,
forgery prevention, traceability, openness, and fairness
[8].
Quantum computers and quantum computing have
been developing at a fast speed. Once quantum computers
are put into use, the blockchain will be unable to maintain
data security. �e smart contract system may be hindered,
and the entire blockchain technology will go downhill. �e
security of the blockchain is manifested as the ability to cope
with mathematical challenges, which cannot be solved easily
even by the most powerful traditional computers.
Quantum passwords have constituted a serious threat to
the classic encryption algorithms, such as asymmetric en-
cryption and hash encryption [9, 10]. Shor [11] proposed a
quantum algorithm that solves discrete logarithms and in-
teger factors. �e algorithm can completely crack Rivest–
Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm, digital signature algo-
rithm (DSA), and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm
(ECDSA). Grover’s algorithm [12] can accelerate traditional
hash operations and solve the once unsolvable problems at a
reasonable time cost. Hence, the algorithm has attracted
much attention in many �elds of quantum computing.
2. Materials and Methods
Focusing on the consensus mechanism of traditional
blockchain, this paper designs a novel blockchain consensus
protocol, based on the stochasticity, irreversibility, and
uncertainty of quantum measurement. In the proposed
consensus mechanism, complex calculations and intracta-
bility mathematical problems are abandoned.. In this way, a
huge amount of computing resources is saved, less energy is

consumed, the time delay is shortened, and the throughput
is increased. *e proposed quantum consensus mechanism
can withstand 51% attacks. *e main contributions are as
follows.
Firstly, the proposed decentralized consensus mecha-
nism for the blockchain, which is based on quantum en-
cryption technology, achieves higher fault tolerance and
attack resistance than traditional mechanisms.
Secondly, quantum entanglement was employed to re-
alize the Byzantine consensus protocol. *e entangled state
was utilized to construct mutual communication informa-
tion, which reduces the amount of computing resources
consumed in solving hard math problems.
*irdly, the proposed consensus protocol was tested on a
self-designed Ethereum. *e test results show that our
quantum consensus mechanism can withstand 51% attacks,
a sign of its high effectiveness and security.
3. Related Work
*e consensus protocols based on classic cryptography
have been successfully applied in the past two decades
[13–15], such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake
(PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT),
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG)-based algorithm, Paxos consensus algorithm, and
raft consensus algorithm, an improvement of Paxos.
Based on classic cryptography, these consensus protocols
have a high complexity in computing problems like the
factorial decomposition of large numbers. Quantum
computing threatens the security of these classic pro-
tocols, for a huge amount of data can be decomposed in a
short time, and the attacker can reconstruct the entire
blockchain without being detected. At present, the
Byzantine consensus faces serious security threats from
network updates and the progress of quantum com-
puting. Based on classic cryptography theories, this
consensus mechanism consumes too many resources and
energy in the computing process. Many mechanisms are
grounded on complex computing, namely, RSA, DSA,
ECDSA, elliptic curve (EC) algorithm, ElGamal, and
Diffe-Hellman. For instance, RSA2048 can complete
cracking within 42 min, using quantum computers
[16, 17]. According to the research on traditional
cryptography algorithm and quantum computing algo-
rithm, the potential threat of quantum computing to
existing cryptography mechanism is shown in Table 1.
To solve the problem, Lyubashevsky proposed a quan-
tum signature scheme [18]and a quantum key distribution
strategy [19, 20]thatattempt to to resist quantum computing
with quantum technology. Drawing on the unique prop-
erties of quantum information, they devised a powerful
consensus mechanism based on quantum passwords and
integrated quantum encryption protocols into a quantum
blockchain. Gottesman and Lu et al. [20–22] put forward a
scheme using irreversible one-way functions, which have
complex negation operations on a given random input.
*ese one-way functions receive classic bit strings and
output quantum states. Behera et al. [23] designed a
quantum currency system based on one-way functional
security and successfully resisted quantum attacks. Alkadri
et al. [24] presented the quantum random prophecy of the
quantum random prophecy model and provided a grid-
based solution. Harikrishnan et al. [25] proposed the Zero
Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), which verify data without ex-
posing them. Each transaction is assigned to a verifier and a
prover. During a ZKP transaction, the verifier tries to prove
something to the prover, without disclosing any information
about it. To ensure the safety against quantum attacks, two
indistinguishable hash functions were integrated to the ZKP
protocol. Nevertheless, the above algorithms are not highly
scalable, and some of them can only work as auxiliary al-
gorithms. Sun et al. [26] proposed algorithms such as swarm
intelligence contract, legal anonymous identity authentica-
tion under the consensus protocol.
4. Quantum Password-Based Blockchain
Consensus Protocol
During the transaction of the quantum blockchain system,
miners compete with each other for bookkeeping rights in
mining to generate a new blockchain. When users conduct
transactions, they need to prepare the quantum state |ψ
formed by N photon sequences.*e network structure of the
quantum blockchain is shown in Figure 1. Each block
consists of a block head and a block body. *e block head
contains the sequence number of the previous block head
and a random value, and the block body contains a set of
transactions.
*e traditional consensus protocol distributes keys
under the conventional encryption method. If the same
ciphertext is sent repeatedly, the attacker Eve will be able
to obtain its statistics. *is paper designs a consensus
protocol, based on the stochasticity, irreversibility, and
uncertainty of quantum measurement. Without relying
on mathematical proof and complex mathematical cal-
culations, the proposed protocol improves the effective-
ness of communication between two parties. Besides, the
quantum state as the ciphertext makes it impossible for
the attacker to reliably read and analyse the ciphertext.
Under the consensus mechanism, the two parties must
meet three conditions before communicating with each
other: the signatures of the two parties cannot be forged;
the signer cannot deny his/her signature; during the
communication, any holder of the public key can verify
the authenticity of the message.
4.1.QuantumKeyDistributionAlgorithm. To initiate secure
communication, the proposed protocol needs to dis-
tribute a key and establish a secure channel using that
key. If Bob does not have the private code s, he will be the
owner of non-measurement basis. By random guess
alone, he cannot acquire any information about the
private code s from the certificate sent by Alice. Similarly,
if Alice does not have the private code s, she will be
unable to acquire any information s from the authen-
tication process of Bob.
2 Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
Firstly, it is assumed that Alice does not have the private
code s, i.e., she does not possess the correct measurement
basis. *en, Alice can be regarded as non-honest (or forged
by eavesdropper Eve). According to the principle of
quantum measurement, unknown quantum states are
unclonable. *us, it is impossible for Eve to obtain the
original photon sequence. *en, Eve chooses a random
measurement basis for measurement.
According to quantum measurement theory, the
quantum state of N photon sequences is |ψ � (1/
�
2
√
)
(|0 + |1). A random value is generated from [0, 2N] and
encoded as quantum ground state: |0⟶ 0, |1⟶ 1. *ere
is a 50% probability of a random bit that the measurement
basis thus chosen is consistent with Alice’s measurement
basis.
Next, it is assumed that the verifier Bob is forged and
does not have the private code s. But he wants to steal the
private code s from the proof process of Alice. Bob chooses a
random measurement basis for measurement. *e mea-
surement state and measured result R can be, respectively,
expressed as
|0, |1, |+, |−{ }. (1)
*e measured result R is
|0, |+, |0, |−, |1, |+, |1, |−. (2)
If the measured result R is |0 or |+, Bob will discard the
photon sequence and notify Alice to discard the entire
photon sequence. If R is |1or|−, Bob will preserve the se-
quence except 1-bit.
*e remaining photons can be encoded as
|1> ⟶ 0, |− > ⟶ 1. (3)
*en, Alice chooses a measurement basis to measure the
remaining photons. If R is |0 or |+, then Bob is a fake verifier.
In this case, Alice will reject the proof and immediately
terminate the consensus protocol. If R is |1or|−, the mea-
sured result is proved valid. Alice will continue with the
following steps.
Alice encodes to obtain her measurement results S � Si􏼈 􏼉
according to equation (3) which is the proof information. S is
encrypted by KAB and sent to Bob. Bob gets the encrypted
proof information from Alice and then decrypts with KAB
and obtains S � Si􏼈 􏼉. If Si � Ri, then the verification is
passed; else, the above steps will be repeated exchanging the
roles of Alice and Bob.
After N iterations, the two particles will hold the same
photon sequence and obtain the final shared key. *rough
the above steps, the two parties can verify each other,
completing the interactive authentication under the
protocol.
4.2. Quantum Consensus Protocol. *is section constructs
the rules of the consensus protocol with AND operation.
Suppose a proposal is waiting to be voted by n blockchain
nodes (voters) block1, . . . , blockn􏼈 􏼉. *e vote of each node is
represented by a quantum password. Yes and no are denoted
by quantum states |0, |0{ } and |1, |1{ }, respectively. Each
node can execute quantum AND and quantum OR
operations.

Each node measures the voting information by the al-
gorithm described in Section 4.1. *e measured result is
recorded as R1 � |11| and noted as R. For the node set of
formula (4), the fault tolerance probability of consensus can
be expressed as

Each node has a record set of all quantum voting in-
formation.*e record set is composed of zeros and ones. For
AND(v1 ⊗ v1 ⊗ v1 ⊗ , . . . , ⊗ v1), the quantum states may have
the same distribution. *en, the quantum voting machine
reads all its input and output records. If at least half of the
records are 1, then the machine will output “agree”; oth-
erwise, it will output “disagree.”
4.3. Security and PerformanceAnalysis. *e previous section
fully describes the design of our consensus protocol based on
quantum encryption. *e proposed consensus algorithm
utilizes quantum measurement theory, Heisenberg’s un-
certainty principle, and the quantum no-cloning theorem.
*e security of the algorithm is independent of the com-
puting power and resources of the computer. *erefore, the
algorithm has unconditional security, which is unmatched
by classical consensus algorithms.
In practical applications, Alice first encodes the classic
photon sequence into the quantum ground state (00101
encoded into |00101) and then applies the quantum gate
sequence in accordance with the steps described in Section
4.1. *e cost is merely O(n), a signal of high efficiency. Even
if the ciphertext sequence is sent to Bob (or eavesdropped by
Eve) via an insecure channel, it is impossible for Eve to
duplicate the photon sequence and fake the key, owing to the
principle of quantum measurement that unknown quantum
states are unclonable. *is is because Alice shares the key
with Bob via a secure key communication channel, which is
based on the quantum sequence. After receiving the ci-
phertext state, Bob can restore the plaintext through
quantum inverse operation. Since the algorithm runs O(n)
times and Alice and Bob exchange information O(n) times,
the protocol needs to send O(n2) messages.*e quantum bit
consumed by themeasurements of each consensus making is
a random number t. *us, the mean complexity of our
protocol is O((n − t)2),where t< (n/2).
5. Experiments and Result Analysis
*e software environment of our experiments includes a
workstation with Dual-CPU Intel Xeon E5-2440 (2.40GHz),
64GB memory, and 64 bit Windows 10 operation system.
Based on Ethereum, a private chain was constructed, after
deploying geth-windows-amd64-1.8.8 and Ethereum-Wal-
let-win64-0-11-1. *e difficulty was set to 0× 20000. *e
experiments mainly test the security, fault tolerance, and
mutual communication of our protocol. *e security veri-
fication means that when all nodes make the same decision,
this new block will be allowed to add to the chain and ensure
the attacks of selfish-mining or blockchain-fork never
happen in the system. *e fault tolerance test verifies the
resistance of the protocol to forgery attacks: a new block can
only be added, if and only if all honest nodes agree with the
addition. *e mutual communication test verifies if the
protocol can withstand 51% attacks. *e experimental re-
sults (Figures 2–4) demonstrate that our protocol is effective.
*e effectiveness of the protocol is not greatly affected, with
the growing number of nodes.
Our consensus mechanism does not rely on the hash
algorithm in the classical blockchain, but the quantum
measurement theory and the quantum non-cloning theory,
to resist 51% attacks. *e traditional blockchain system has
the disadvantages of low throughput, long time delay, and
high energy consumption. Taking the Bitcoin system as an
example, its throughput only allows about 10 transactions
per second, and each transaction needs to wait about 10min
to be confirmed. If the transaction is large, the waiting time

may reach 1 h. In addition, the system consumes a lot of
computing power and energy during the competition of
miners. As shown in Figures 2–4, our mechanism can greatly
suppress computing power and energy consumption, in-
crease the throughput, and reduce the time delay.
6. Conclusions
*is paper devises a novel consensus protocol, drawing on
the stochasticity, irreversibility, and uncertainty of
quantum measurement. Without relying on mathematical
proofs and complex mathematical computations, the
protocol improves the communication between the two
parties of authentication, making the authentication more
effective. Since the ciphertext is transmitted in quantum
state, the security of ciphertext communication is thus
assured, even if the text is eavesdropped multiple times by
the attacker. Hence, the consensus mechanism is un-
conditional and reliable. Compared with the consensus
mechanisms based on classic encryption algorithms, the
proposed protocol requires relatively few computing re-
sources, consumes only a few energies and a short time,
leads to a short time delay, and achieves a high
throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our
consensus protocol improves the success rate and effec-
tiveness of the blockchain in resisting quantum attacks
and solves a thorny problem of the classic consensus
mechanisms: the inability to withstand 51% attacks.
