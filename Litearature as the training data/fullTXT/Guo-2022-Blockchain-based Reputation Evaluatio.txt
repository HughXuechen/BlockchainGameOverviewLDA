ABSTRACT
Reputation evaluation is one of vital elements in contemporary
social network-based applications. A common type of evaluation
method is relying on the third party or a community-based rat-
ing. However, this type of method is encountering an issue caused
by fake comments posted by adversaries. In this paper, we pro-
pose a blockchain-based reputation evaluation approach that uses
game theory to address the ghost commentator issue. Over the
blockchain network, our approach establishes a reputation-based
personal credit evaluation system, in which participants’ strategies
and payoffs are modeled. A smart contract-based deposit incentive
mechanism is developed. We have implemented an experimental
evaluation to show the evidence to the performance of our ap-
proach.

1 INTRODUCTION
Currently, reputation ratings are considered a crucial element for

However, However, this type of method is encountering an issue
caused by fake comments posted by adversaries. Recent advance of
network technologies have been reforming features of reputation
evaluation systems. On one side, personal credits are available in
different sources, which results in less requirements of the tradi-
tional credit service; on the other side, it is hard to track data used
in the evaluation and uncertain participants in the evaluation may
weaken the trustworthiness of the evaluation [8]. For instance, most
current reputation platforms only offers evaluation results rather
than evidencing the truth. Hence, there is an urgent demand for
constructing a scheme of reputation evaluation.
As a decentralized approach, blockchain technology is an alter-
native for establishing a trustworthy reputation evaluation sys-
tem [4, 5]. The analysis of the behavior of each participant in the
blockchain system is one of the latest research directions, and game
theory provides a new solution to this problem [19]. Based on
mathematical models, game theory has been applied in strategic
decision-making. Game theory in blockchain technology has a
dual role, inward and outward. Introversion is the application of
theoretical principles to blockchain protocols. Extroversion is the
integration of strategic decision models with business processes.
The work [20] proposed a reputation-based approach using repeat
game model to solve the problems caused by intense competitions
among miners and consequently dishonest mining strategies, such
as block withholding attack, selfish mining, eclipse attack and stub-
born mining, etc.
Reputation-based trust management using game theory can be
used to deal with privacy issues, a typical privacy risk comes from
data shared by multiple parties in social networks. Xu et. al [24]
propose a trust-based mechanism to achieve collaborative privacy
management. The user decides whether to publish a data item based
on the aggregate opinions of all relevant users. The user updates
these values according to the user’s privacy loss. Moreover, users
can make trade-offs between data sharing and privacy protection by
adjusting the parameters of the proposed mechanism. Authors for-
mulate the selection of parameters as a multi-armed bandit problem,
and apply an upper-limit confidence strategy to solve the problem.
Consortium blockchain is a specific blockchain with multiple
pre-selected nodes to establish the distributed shared database with
moderate cost [10]. In our proposed system, the pre-selected nodes
are participants associated with trust evaluations. We utilize smart
contracts to achieve the evaluation of behavior games, which are

self-executing scripts residing on blockchain with distributed multi-
step processes. These smart contract-based solutions make the
automation of data trust evaluation highly efficient and defend
against malicious assessment. Moreover, the credibility of evalu-
ation data is a core element. For instance, the service evaluator
may turn into an insider threat due to self-purpose. The incentive
mechanism designed based on game theory can courage evaluators
to evaluate honestly as their optimal strategy.
The architecture of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1. A
service evaluator refers to the participants who evaluates the trans-
action or blockchain-stored affairs. Smart contract considers the
authenticity of the evaluation and reward or punish the service eval-
uator. The updated reputation values will be securely stored in the
reputation blockchain. The decision on rewards and punishments
is determined by the proposed game theory-based method.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• Wepropose a novel approach that utilizes consortium blockchain
to establish a distributed reputation-based trust evaluation
system.
• We develop a non-cooperative non-zero sum behavior game
model mechanism, which encourages participants to hon-
estly evaluate the reliability of transactions in order to im-
prove the credibility of the information.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We have reviewed
and summarized related work, as displayed in Section 2. Next, Sec-
tion 3 presents problems, model design, and major algorithms. Fi-
nally, Sections 4 and 5 provide our evaluation results and conclu-
sions, respectively.
2 RELATEDWORK
2.1 Blockchain-based Reputation Management
Consortium blockchain has achieved great potential in “5G + IoT"
fields. The authors [11] proposed exploits advantages of edge com-
puting and blockchain to establish a privacy-preserving mechanism
while considering other constraints, such as energy cost. The work
[10] presented a consortium blockchain-oriented approach to solve
the problem of privacy leakagewithout restricting trading functions.
The proposed method detects the relationship between various en-
ergy transaction volumes that can be mined and other information
(e.g., geographic location and energy usage), and solves the privacy
problem of energy transaction users in the smart grid. In order to
balance resource consumption and transaction execution efficiency,
vicious researchers consider using cloud computing or edge com-
puting [9]. Executing complex smart contracts is also a huge burden
on devices with limited resources.
Fog/edge computing is the next frontier of cloud computing be-
cause it can calculate and store large amounts of data generated
by IoT devices near its source. However, its functionality and de-
ployment flexibility make fog computing vulnerable to security and
privacy attacks.[9]. Therefore, to ensure security and privacy, [2]
propose a trust management system based on two-way subjective
logic, which allows service requesters to verify whether the service
provider can provide reliable and secure services, and let The ser-
vice provider checks the trustworthiness of the service provider.
The proposed distributed and event-driven trust management sys-
tem considers both QoS and social trust metrics to determine the
trust of a fog node, and final trust value is calculated by dynami-
cally combining information obtained from self-observation and
recommendations of neighboring nodes.
IoT network integrates various heterogeneous nodes, e.g., con-
nected devices, smart homes, etc. These smart objects communicate
and collaborate with each other in a distributed and dynamic envi-
ronment, facing some security challenges. Traditional trust manage-
ment solutions cannot meet the new requirements of IoT, such as
heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability. The authors in [17] propose
a hierarchical and scalable blockchain trust management protocol
that has mobility support in large-scale distributed IoT systems.
The key point is that the mobile smart object can propagate trust
information about the service provider to the blockchain. There-
fore, all objects will have a global view of each service provider
in the architecture, thus speeding up trust decisions. In addition,
protocol in [17] is resistant to known malicious attacks such as bad-
mouthing, ballot-stuffing and cooperative Attack, and researchers
confirmed the validity of their proposal through theoretical analysis
and extensive simulations.
The development of IoT has promoted the development of the
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with autonomous vehicles and roadside
infrastructure as the main components. However, untrusted envi-
ronment hinders the broadcast of information to improve traffic
safety and efficiency. Therefore, trust establishment in IoV is a
key security issue, which is constantly limited by scalability chal-
lenges. [13] proposes a blockchain-based protocol for IoV using
smart contracts, physical unclonable functions, certificates, and
dynamic proof of work consensus algorithms. Researchers provides
a secure framework for registering trusted vehicles and preventing
malicious vehicles. physical unclonable functions is used to assign a
unique identity to each vehicle that establishes trust. The certificate
is issued by the roadside unit to protect the privacy of the vehicle,
and the dynamic proof of work consensus algorithms allows the
protocol to be extended based on the incoming traffic generated
by the vehicle. A security and performance analysis is proposed
in order to prove the feasibility and scalability of the proposed
protocol, and a case study was also discussed that confirmed that
the protocol can provide excellent decentralized trust management
for IoV.
In [25], vehicles can validate the received messages from neigh-
boring vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the vali-
dation result, the vehicle will generate a rating for each message

source vehicle. With the ratings uploaded from vehicles, roadside
units (RSUs) calculate the trust value offsets of involved vehicles
and pack these data into a block. Then, each RSUwill try to add their
blocks to the trust blockchain which is maintained by all the RSUs.
By employing the joint proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake
consensus mechanism, the more total value of offsets (stake) is in
the block, the easier RSU can find the nonce for the hash function
(PoW). In this way, all RSUs collaboratively maintain an updated,
reliable, and consistent trust blockchain. Simulation results reveal
that the proposed system is effective and feasible in collecting,
calculating, and storing trust values in vehicular networks.
2.2 Game Theory-based Behavior Analysis
Reputation plays an important role in many communities. Game
theory has shown great potential in various fields.
Kang et. al in [15] propose a two-stage soft security enhancement
solution to address the challenge that voting collusion between the
candidates and compromised high-stake participants in the filed
of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Their method includes two stages,
miner selection and block verification, in the first stage, the author
designed a reputation-based voting scheme to ensure safe miner
selection. The program uses past interactions and recommendations
from other tools to assess the reputation of candidates. Candidates
with high reputation are selected as active miners and standby
miners. In the second stage, in order to prevent internal collusion
between active miners, the newly generated blocks will be further
verified and reviewed by standby miners. In order to incentive
standby miners to participate in block verification, this paper uses
game theory to model the interaction between active miners and
standby miners.
The authors also presented a secure P2P data sharing system
in vehicular computing and networks in [16], researchers utilized
consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies to achieve
secure and efficient data storage and data sharing, in which the
authors proposed a reputation based data sharing scheme with
the three-weight subjective logic model considering interaction
frequency, event timeliness, and trajectory similarity. The authors
have demonstrated the usage of smart contracts in the dimensions
of data storage and information sharing.
In traditional data sharing applications, users need to transmit
data to a third party for verification. However, users are reluctant
to share cybersecurity information due to concerns about mistrust,
possible false information, privacy loopholes and lack of incentives.
[22] proposed a blockchain-based data sharing framework “iShare”.
Similar to the mining pool in Bitcoin, the attack model is part of the
participants. Sub-organizations are generated, and more profits are
obtained by not publishing information to another group, similar
to a pool block retention attack. In the case of two groups, each
group determines the number of organizations that penetrate into
the other group to maximize its profit. Therefore, non-cooperative
games can be used for modeling and analysis. The only Nash equi-
librium is not to launch an attack, which is the best response for
each group. When the number of infiltrating organizations meets
different constraints, the Nash equilibrium will change. More gen-
eral situations such as multi-party organization scenarios can be
considered in future work.
The risk of false information and lack of incentives are also com-
mon in traditional cloud computing scenarios. Cloud users may not
fully trust the calculation results returned by the cloud provider.
A prior study provides evidences [18] of using a smart contract-
based method to address this issue. In this solution, the cloud user
uses the smart contract to pay the same Calculate the task, and
then collect and compare the results from the two clouds to verify
correctness. However, the smart contract-based method described
above is limited to processing data on the blockchain, and trusted
entities can launch attacks by modifying the data to obtain addi-
tional profits [21]. [1] proposed a distributed entity-based scheme
to prevent attacks. In this solution, the coordination game can be
used to analyze the interaction between voters and verifiers, and it
is easy to prove that the game has two Nash equilibriums, that is,
the strategies of the participants are the same.
3 MODEL DESIGN
3.1 Overview of the System
This part will briefly introduce the trust management system archi-
tecture of this paper from the five parts, trust composition, trust
propagation, trust aggregation, trust update and trust formation,
using the method described from [14]. In our paper, if the con-
sumer of the service does not evaluate the service after receiving
the service, it will not have any influence on the system. Aimed
to facilitate the analysis of this paper, we assume that all service
consumers participate in service evaluation, service estimators and
service consumers in the following represents the same meaning.
In order to meet the needs of service requesters and maximize
application performance, it is important to evaluate the trustworthi-
ness of service providers in the IoT environment. On one hand, the
trustworthiness of service providers cannot be separated from their
own good reviews, and on the other hand, they cannot be separated
from true evaluations. Therefore, the reputation proposed in this
paper also includes two aspects, including quality of service (QoS)
trust and social trust. QoS trust in general refers to performance
and is measured by competence, cooperativeness, reliability, task
completion capability, etc. Social trust derives from social relation-
ship between owners of IoT devices and is measured by intimacy,
honesty, centrality [3], and connectivity.
In our blockchain-based reputation system, both metadata and
trust values are stored, and are shared among participants with
identity authenticated. Based on the blockchain to establish a trust
management system, our trust propagation method is decentralized,
and all the storage, concentration, and update of trust data are
stored in the system in a distributed manner. At the same time,
all calculations and subsequent rewards and punishments will be
based on smart contracts, which largely resists traditional attacks
on centralized control centers.
Trust aggregation refers to the collection of trust evidence through
self-observation or feedback from participants. In this paper, we
use a weighted sum method to aggregate the reputation value, and
the weight is dynamic and will change with past experience and
user preferences.
Trust update concerns when trust is updated. In general, there
are two schemes - event-driven scheme and time-driven scheme. In
this work,We consider a more practical situation, that is, the storage
BSCI Session 3 BSCI '22, May 30, 2022, Nagasaki, Japan

and update of the blockchain itself requires greater consumption.
Therefore, we consider two dimensions of trust update, frequency
and time, which are described in details in Section 3.5.
3.2 Design Goals
Trust, as a soft security measure, is particularly suitable for service-
oriented IoT systems, because humans’ inherent IoT devices may be
malicious for their own benefit. Malicious users can also collude to
dominate the service provider market. We enumerate the possible
threats to IoT systems [6, 12]. The target of this article is to protect
against the following attacks:
(1) Self-promotion attacks: a malicious service provider can pro-
mote its own service by providing good recommendations
for itself.
(2) Bad-mouthing attacks: a malicious service provider can ruin
the trust of a well-behaved participant by providing bad
recommendations against it so as to decrease the chance of
that node being selected for service.
(3) Ballot-stuffing attacks: a malicious service provider can boost
the trust ofmalicious participants so as to increase the chance
of themselves being selected. This is a form of collusion
recommendation attacks, i.e., it can collaborate with other
malicious nodes to boost the trust of each other.
(4) Opportunistic service attacks: a malicious service provider
can provide good service to gain high reputation opportunis-
tically especially when it senses its reputation is dropping
because of providing bad service. With good reputation, it
can effectively collude with other bad node to perform bad-
mouthing and ballot-stuffing attacks.
The “ghost commentator problem" is a concrete manifestation
of the above problem. The attacker prepares a certain amount of
funds to buy out the service evaluation party participating in the
transaction, so that the service evaluation party will evaluate ac-
cording to the attacker’s wishes. We present this attacking method
also as the “bribe".
3.3 Reputation-based Trust Composition
In this system, when participant i has a transaction with participant
j (indicated by the symbol 𝑇𝑖 𝑗 ), participant i will score participant
j based on the satisfaction of this transaction. Participant i will
score participant j based on the satisfaction of this transaction,
satisfaction means that participant i’s satisfaction with participant
j increases by 1; Unsatisfied means that participant i is dissatisfied
with participant j and 𝑈𝑛𝑆𝑎𝑖 𝑗 plus one. After multiple rounds of
transactions, the evaluation value of participant i to participant j is
𝐸𝑣𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑆𝑎𝑖 𝑗 −𝑈𝑛𝑆𝑎𝑖 𝑗 , and 𝐸𝑣𝑖 𝑗 is standardized to obtain the partial
trust value of i to j. The partial trust value is shown in Eq. (1):
𝐿ij =
𝑀𝑎𝑥
(
Evij, 0
)∑n
𝑘=1𝑀𝑎𝑥 (Evik, 0)
(k ≠ i) . (1)
where n represents the total number of participants in the system.
For ease of description, in this paper, partial trust value and local
trust value have the samemeaning. From this, we can obtain the par-
tial trust vector of participant i 𝐿𝑖 = {𝐿𝑖 𝑗 | 𝑗 ∈ (1, . . . , 𝑛)}, obviously
𝐿𝑖𝑖 = 1. In this evaluation system, each participant will regularly
aggregate its own partial trust vector to the rating platform server.
A partial trust matrix 𝑇𝐿 is formed, where 𝑇𝐿𝑖 𝑗 (𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ (1, . . . , 𝑛))
represents the partial trust value of participant i to participant j,
obviously 𝑇𝐿𝑖 𝑗 = 𝐿𝑖 𝑗 .
In addition, as in real world, participant i not only needs to
consider its own trust value to participant j before transacting
with participant j, but also consider related parties (participants
who have had transactions with participant i) Evaluation of party
j. Let participant i’s associated participant k’s partial trust value
𝐿𝑘 𝑗 to participant jj’s influence on participant i be determined by
participant i’s local trust value LocVaik to participant k.
From this, we can obtain the global trust value𝐺𝑖 𝑗 of participant
i to participant j, as shown in Eq. (2).
𝐺𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑐 (𝑘) =
𝑛∑︁
𝑘=1
𝐿𝑖𝑘 · 𝐿𝑘 𝑗 =
𝑛∑︁
𝑘=1
𝑇𝐿𝑖𝑘 ·𝑇𝐿𝑘 𝑗 . (2)
The global trust vector of participant i to other participants
𝑇𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 𝑗 | 𝑗 ∈ (1, . . . , 𝑛).𝑇𝑖 = (𝐺𝑖 𝑗 | 𝑗 ∈ (1, . . . , 𝑛) .
It can be seen from this that participant i will comprehensively
calculate its transaction trust value 𝑅𝑒𝑖 𝑗 for participant j before
trading with participant j, as shown in Eq. (3):
𝑅𝑒𝑖 𝑗 = 𝛼 · 𝐿𝑖 𝑗 + (1 − 𝛼) ·𝐺𝑖 𝑗
= 𝛼 ·𝑇𝐿𝑖 𝑗 + (1 − 𝛼) ·
𝑛∑︁
𝑘=1
𝑇𝐿𝑖𝑘 ·𝑇𝐿𝑘 .
(3)
where 𝛼 is the self-confidence coefficient of participants , and
𝛼 ∈ (0, 1) . When participant i needs to purchase a service, it
will choose the one with the highest transaction trust value from
the participants that provide similar services for the transaction.
In addition, for a new participant iwho has no transaction record,
the platform server initializes its partial trust value to others to 1
2 .
3.4 Behavioral Game between the Service
Provider and Estimator
Under the background of information asymmetry, the perceived
credit system cannot fully guarantee the authenticity of the eval-
uation information. On one hand, the information provider may
provide false evaluation information and mislead the users’ transac-
tion decision; On the other hand, the service provider will identify
the information based on its own experience and make the correct
transaction decision as much as possible. In this process, it is the a
non-zero sum game relationship between the gains and losses of
the two sides of the game. The behavioral game model based on
the proposed credit system is shown in Fig.1.
The objects participating in the game in the model are divided
into two categories, one is the service provider; the other is the
service estimator. Both game objects in the model adopt mixed
strategies. Any service provider i may accept the evaluation in-
formation provided by the credit platform with probability 𝑝𝑖 , or
reject the evaluation information provided by the platform with
probability (1 − 𝑝𝑖 ). At the same time, any information provider
j may publish a false evaluation with a probability of 𝑞 𝑗 , or may
publish a true evaluation with a probability of (1−𝑞 𝑗 ). From above,
we can get the strategy matrix of the proposed model, namely
𝑃𝑖 = (𝑝𝑖 , 1−𝑝𝑖 ) and𝑄 𝑗 = (𝑞 𝑗 , 1−𝑞 𝑗 ). In order to construct the pay-
off function of the participating objects of this model, we quantify

the profit results of both parties in the game, and focus on the key
factors that affect the value of the payoff.
The formal representation of the game model is as follows in Eq.
(4):
𝑁 = {𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟 (𝑖), 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 ( 𝑗)}
𝑆 = {𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 ℎ𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑙𝑦, 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑙𝑦,
𝐸𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒 ℎ𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑙𝑦, 𝐸𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑙𝑦}
𝑈 = {(𝑈𝑠ℎℎ,𝑈 𝑒ℎℎ), (𝑈𝑠ℎ𝑑 ,𝑈 𝑒ℎ𝑑 ),
(𝑈𝑠ℎℎ,𝑈 𝑒ℎℎ), (𝑈𝑠ℎℎ,𝑈 𝑒ℎℎ)}.
(4)
The game payoffmatrix of the participants in this model is shown
in Tab. 1.
For the convenience of analysis, we adopt the classic 1 𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟
game model in this part, that is, the final maximum utility is a fixed
value. The specific meaning can be seen in [23]. The following
describe each utility separately.
(1) When the service provider chooses to provide real services
and the service evaluator evaluates according to his own
wishes, the utilities of the two persons is their deposit, (𝑈𝑠ℎℎ =
1,𝑈 𝑒ℎℎ = 1). This is the ideal target we want, that is, we
need the Nash equilibrium to converge to this solution.
(2) When the service provider chooses to provide dishonest
services and the service evaluator truly evaluates it according
to his wishes, the service provider will suffer losses, that
is, lose his deposit, and the service evaluator will recover
his deposit, (𝑈𝑠𝑑ℎ < 1,𝑈 𝑒𝑑ℎ = 1). This situation can be
understood as a failure of the attack.
(3) When the service provider chooses not to provide the honest
service, and the service evaluator does not evaluate accord-
ing to the real situation either, the utilities of the two persons
is greater than their deposit(𝑈𝑠𝑑𝑑 > 1,𝑈 𝑒𝑑𝑑 > 1). In this
case, the attack is successful and we need to prevent this
kind of situation.
(4) When the service provider chooses to provide honest ser-
vices, but the service evaluator fails to evaluate according to
his own wishes, the service provider will lose its deposit. In
this case, (𝑈𝑠ℎ𝑑 < 1,𝑈 𝑒ℎ𝑑 < 1), the service provider will se-
riously damage the market development, where the attacker
should be severely punished.
We assume that all participants are intelligent. When neither
service providers nor evaluators provide the honest service, the
benefit is the greatest. If the game is played only once, the current
situation can be regarded as a “prisoner’s dilemma". However, the
transaction will obviously continue. From a long-term perspective,
the current Nash equilibrium is not the global optimal solution. We
need to model the long-term benefits and establish an incentive
mechanism based on smart contracts, which will be described in
detail in next part.
3.5 Deposit-based Incentive Mechanism
In order to resit the attack mentioned in section 3, our work pro-
poses an deposit based incentive mechanism.A system parameter
analysis is proposed to measure the probability that an attacker
with limited funds can change the result in Section 4. The context
in this and next section will show that there is a Nash equilibrium
under these conditions, that is, all rational participants are forced
to act honestly.
Each transaction will be considered as a proposal submitted to
the proposal pool. Submitter shows an transaction with the funding,
presented by 𝐷𝑣 . Before all information providers conduct their
transaction evaluations, participants need to pay a certain deposit.
The submitter submits the proposal and is ready to accept the
evaluation of the evaluator, and then the evaluator will bet on the
bet. Anyone can join or exit the system anytime and anywhere.
Commonly, the certification result is the cumulative sum of the
number of certifications. Each service evaluator will compare it
with the average evaluation of other subjects. Specifically, we pro-
pose a deviation to describe the distance between different service
evaluators and the evaluation average. For example, if Alice’s score
is 0.9, Bob’s score is 0.2, and the overall average score is 0.6, then
Alice’s deviation is ( |0.9 − 0.8|)/0.8 = 0.125, and Bob’s deviation
is ( |0.2 − 0.8|)/0.8 = 0.75, different users have different deviations,
starting from reality, we designed a layered feedback mechanism.
Divide the deviation into three levels, lower than the tolerance
value, tolerable value to trigger, and higher than trigger. These
three levels correspond to honest evaluation, accidental deviation
and malicious evaluation respectively.
In response to malicious estimators, we adopted the "nuclear op-
tion" strategy proposed in repeat game [7]. Our solution is directly
reducing its reputation by half, which will cause a huge obstacle to
its future participation in business and protect the normal operation
of the entire system.
On the other hand, if the service provided by the service party
is unstable and the user’s evaluation deviation does not exceed the
trigger, it is tolerable to withhold the deposit, and it will not have
much impact if the honest evaluation is maintained. Intuitively, the
proposed system encourages estimator to bet on proposal with high
confidence.
The process is briefly summarized as follows:
1. A user in the system generates transaction information, creates
a proposal and submits it to the blockchain network through the
client, and places a funding 𝐷𝑣 .
2. Other users make judgments based on their own information
and submit deposits to participate in evaluation.
3. The smart contract collects the deposits of each player until it
reaches the condition for outputting the game result.
4. The output based on game theory will be given by smart
contract.
5. Obtain the outcome of transaction according to the player’s
betting situation, then return the rewards or punishments respec-
tively.
The main process of deposit-based incentive mechanism algo-
rithm is shown in Algorithm. 1.

First of all, there are many proposals constructed by submitters
are waited to be certified, which is denoted by 𝑃 , and our work
assume that its size 𝑛 = |𝑃 |, and each proposal is associated with a
𝐷𝑣 used to motivate users to verify his/her proposal. The detailed
description of the construction of 𝑃 is not discussed in this paper.
It can be constructed in many different ways, and this will be our
follow-up work.
Then one player submit its own deposit through the smart con-
tract. 𝑠𝑖,𝑟,𝑣 denotes the amount that player i placed a stake to get the
opportunity for evaluate the proposal 𝑝 𝑗 , here r is not yet decided,
because it will be assignment by smart contract randomly. Note
that r is chosen from [1, |𝑃 |]. How to obtain a real random number
in smart contract on blockchain network is a active research in
recent days, and this work do not discuss this issue. For ease of
analysis, the deposit evaluators placed is all 𝑑 , At the same time,
the evaluator submits a sealed estimation grade 𝑒 ∈ (0, 1). This can
be accomplished using a commit-reveal scheme in which the voter
commits to a hash of their vote concatenated with a nonce and later
reveals the vote and nonce.
Considering that the blockchain consumes a lot of energy and
time when rewriting data, we do not adopt a real-time update
method for the update of reputation. Taking into account different
types of transactions, we have considered the frequency of transac-
tions and the cycle of reputation updates. Specifically, in the first
case, if a large number of evaluations are generated for a certain
transaction in a short period of time, that is, the volume of deposit
in a short period of time exceeds the Deposit threshold 𝐷 , the sys-
tem will trigger an update of the reputation. In the second case,
there are new transactions but the transaction volume is relatively
small, but a long time has passed. In order to provide the user of
the service with the latest reference in time, the system will also
trigger the update of the reputation.
For the penalty mechanism, we refer to the "nuclear option" in
the repeated game and refer to work [7]. If an appraiser’s score
is not much different from the average of everyone else (degree
of deviation), we just deduct part of its deposit. If there is a big
deviation, we decide to implement the "nuclear option" to halve
its overall reputation. The halving process will directly make the
service appraiser unable to purchase the service later. Consider that
the service provider may be unstable. This will also directly affect
the value of its social trust, thereby affecting other service users.
3.6 Threat Model
Consider a malicious participant attempting to launch the attacks
mentioned in Section 3. Assuming that a malicious participant
attempts to control the result of proposal j, and the malicious par-
ticipant owns 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 currency and attempts to buy a certain amount
of estimator for manipulation the result.
Every time estimator receives a proposal, the action is pro-
cessed by a smart contract. Due to the decentralized nature of the
blockchain, it is not possible for an attacker to only attack the inter-
mediate platform to achieve its goal. Assuming that the proposal
randomly allocated by the smart contract belongs to the Bernoulli
distribution. For ease of analysis, we assume that all estimators will
place a deposit of 𝑑 when participating in the evaluation, and now
we calculate the probability of successful implementation of the
attack.
It is known that it would be 𝐷
𝑑
estimations on each proposal
in total. Mark 𝑋 ∼ 𝐵(𝐷
𝑑
, 𝑝𝑟 ), 𝐷
𝑑
= 𝑡 , 𝐵(·) presents a binomial
random variable. It can be known from the principle of binomial
distribution that: 𝑃 (𝑋 = 𝑥) = 𝐶𝑥
𝑡 𝑝𝑟
𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑟 )𝑡−𝑥 . So the probability
of successful attacking implementation is shown in Eq. (5), where
𝑝𝑟 is the probability that the estimation belong to adversary.

Assume the adversary’s 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 is an integer multiple of 𝑑 , then at
most 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒
𝑑
estimations belong to the malicious participant. Since
the smart contract randomly sends a proposal to the estimator, so
that the probability of a random estimation is belong to adversary
is as Eq. (6):

4 EXPERIMENT AND EVALUATIONS
All the experimentswere run on themachinewith Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz and 16GB memory.
For the threat model described in the previous section, we sim-
ulated the probability of a malicious participant’s success in an
attack. We consider the two situations in this part:
One situation is that, the service provider knows the𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
set by the system, which means the attacker knows the total volume
of evaluation deposit required at first. Then the malicious partici-
pant can calculate how much money he needs, to launch an attack
in order to obtain a greater probability of successful manipulating.
To simulate this situation,We set the input of the experiment includ-
ing 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 , 𝑑 , 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 , and |𝑃 |, where 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 , 𝑑 and
|𝑃 | are fixed. The output refers to the probability of the attacker suc-
cessfully tampering with the evaluation result. The 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
represents the total amount of deposit required when evaluating a
service; 𝑑 represents the deposit that each evaluator needs to pay
when participating in the evaluation. For ease of calculation, we
set the value of 𝑑 to 1 unit; 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 refers to the principal used by
malicious participants to launch an attack, and |𝑝 | represents the
number of services to be evaluated in the current service evaluation
pool. Here we analyze a single service and set the value of |𝑝 | to 1.
The experimental results are shown in the fig. 2.
The figure 2 describes the relationship between the node’s suc-
cessful probability of doing evil and the node’s investment in the
case of a fixed total deposit. The deposit that a node normally needs
to pay is 1 unit. It can be seen that when the node’s investment
is less than about five times the total deposit, the probability of
the node’s successful evil is almost zero. In fact, as long as the
malicious node invests more than 1 time, he will lose money, and
he needs to have a 50% probability of success, and he needs to
deposit amout 9 times the unit of funds, which is 180 units, so the
penalty mechanism we designed is very Effective. In addition, the
comparison between the solid line and the dashed line in the figure
shows that the larger the total amount of deposits, the higher the
capital requirements for the node to successfully commit evil.
Another situation is that, the system administrator decides to
set the total amount of the deposit after knowing the funds of the
malicious party, to make the probability of the attacker launching
a “ghost comments” attack to tamper with the result approaches as
close to zero as possible. That is, the system administrator knows
the 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 first. To facilitate analysis, we set 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 to 1, and we also
made a comparison simulation when 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 is 2. Then the admin-
istrator can calculate how much he needs to set the threshold of
the deposit to be able to resist attacks by malicious participants.
To simulate this situation, We set the input of the experiment in-
cluding 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 , 𝑑 , 𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 , and also |𝑃 |. The output is the
same as above, refers to the probability of the attacker successfully
tampering with the evaluation result. Differently, in this situation
𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 is fixed, represents the total amount of funds the attacker has,
and the deposit threshold 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 becomes the independent
variable. The settings and assumptions of 𝑑 and |𝑃 | are the same
as the previous experiment. The experimental results are shown in
the fig. 3.
Figure 2: The relationship between successful tampering and
the multiple of the deposit amount used for Bribe under
limited total amount of deposits.
Figure 3: The probability of successful attack varies with the
total amount of deposit under limited bribe.
The figure 3 shows the relationship between the probability of
the attacker’s success and the total amount of deposit when the
amount of funds invested by the malicious party is limited.
It can be seen from the figure that the higher the total deposit re-
quired by the system for credit evaluation, the lower the probability
of an attacker successfully carrying out a malicious attack.
This means that when he launches an attack, that is, when he
is the only one who makes a false evaluation, as long as there
are 8 people participating in the evaluation at the same time, the
probability of success will drop to less than 10%. When there are
11 people participating in the evaluation at the same time, the
probability of success will drop to less than 1%, which proves that
the mechanism we designed can resist the attacks in section 3.

5 CONCLUSIONS
This work proposed a scheme of blockchain-based trust manage-
ment using game theory for 5G-enabled distributed IIoT system to
solve the ghost commentator problem.We developed the blockchain-
enabled reputation-based evaluation system that modelized eval-
uation strategies by using behavioral game theory. The incentive
mechanism in our work was a deposit-based scheme that relied
on the implementation of smart contract. We showed the effect of
parameter setting on the system and our experiments illustrated
that using the deposit-based smart contract mechanism could crack-
down malicious participants who intended launch ghost commen-
tator attacks. Future work would further address the dynamic exe-
cution scenarios in which a consistent changing proposal list would
be researched.
