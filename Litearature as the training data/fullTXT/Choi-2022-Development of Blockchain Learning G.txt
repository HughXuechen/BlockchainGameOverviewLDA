Abstract: The blockchain education program based on the ASSURE model proposed in this article is
of value because it can be applied in blended learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, using learning
games to facilitate self-directed learning. We developed the education program in accordance with
the six steps of the education design process of the ASSURE model. Firstly, we assessed learners
to identify digital literacy issues of South Korean elementary students and jobs desired by them.
Secondly, the objective of blockchain education was defined as improving awareness of and attention
to blockchain technology by elementary students. Thirdly, gamification applied lessons were used
as a teaching method, with educational media and data developed as worksheets and materials
that can be used both online and offline. Fourthly, the educational contents and teaching aids were
tested to evaluate the developed learning materials. Fifthly, the learning games were designed to
offer rewards. Last, we designed the program to teach the principles of consensus mechanisms,
private blockchain, and public blockchain. Education experts’ feedback was analyzed using technical
statistics and LDA-based topic modeling to assess and modify the program. The education program
design approach incorporating gamification elements was effective but needed expansion in coverage
to include level-based teaching elements.
Keywords: blockchain; gamification; ASSURE model; primary education; blended learning
1. Introduction
Due to recent ICT breakthroughs, many innovative approaches have appeared in
the educational sector [1]; the COVID-19 outbreak has prompted efforts to adopt ICT-
enabled distance learning strategies to sustain teaching/learning [2]. A review of the latest
improvements made to the 2015 revised national curriculum in South Korea shows that an
emphasis is placed on the importance of students’ computational thinking abilities [3]. The
emphasis highlights the need to make the learning of computing skills more easily accessible
in elementary school education. For example, the South Korean government has promoted
ICT-enabled, textbook-less classes, incorporating computer program coding lessons in the
regular curriculum to foster the fourth industrial revolution, and has facilitated educational
innovation away from a focus on theory towards hands-on ICT practice sessions [1]. Despite
this top-down guideline, some concerns have been reported that training in specialized
computing skills could reduce students’ motivation to learn, leading to a decrease in their
concentration, possibly impacting the quality of classes [4]. It is notable that review of
statistical materials relating to classroom-based teaching and learning in the past shows
that approximately 35% of South Korean students reported that they enjoyed their classes—
behind the corresponding responses from France (55%) and the U.K. (48%). The findings

confirm that some measures are needed to foster student enthusiasm for classes and to
enhance the level of their involvement during classes [3].
This article concerns the development of a blockchain education program utilizing
gamification to encourage elementary student learners to develop an interest in blockchain,
identifying implications for how to educate the founding principles of blockchain by
analyzing keywords and topic modeling language networks. Sub-goals covered include
the following:
(1) To develop an educational program on blockchain principles using gamification based
on the six stages of the ASSURE model.
(2) To analyze focus group perspectives on the developed program for learning blockchain
principles using language network approaches involving keyword centralities and
topic modeling.

2.1. Gamification as a Mechanism of Learning
The exploitation of gamification, where game-like elements are combined with con-
ventional classroom approaches, is considered to be a positive way of encouraging students
to more spontaneously take an interest and of helping them pay more attention to their
classes. Gamification has the merits of offering students fun experiences induced by games
while studying their subjects so that their learning experience becomes more enjoyable,
and of providing tangible indicators that allow students to instantaneously check on their
own achievements [5].
The term ‘gamification’ was coined from the word ‘game’ and was first used by Nick
Pelling in 2002. Gamification means combining game-based mechanisms, aesthetic ele-
ments, ways of thinking, etc., in ways that encourage immersion, motivate student actions,
facilitate learning, and help students to solve problems in non-game-like contexts [6]. In
the foregoing, ‘game’ can be defined as an activity that includes skills, knowledge, and
opportunities for solving problems under certain sets of rules and making efforts to win [7].
A game provides clear rules and purposes, clarifying the conditions for winning and termi-
nating the game. It can provide users with a sense of purpose and help raise the level of
interest in games.
A wide range of studies, both domestic and international, have been conducted to
consider the incorporation of gamification into education so that the concentration skills of
students can be improved. For example, Randel et al. [8] analyzed studies of gamification-
combined education over 28 years and found that 12 out of 14 interventions involving
language and mathematics education identified were effective. Iannotti [9] observed
improvements in empathy skills and altruism in students with implementation of role-
playing in classroom education. Sitzmann [10] analyzed education approaches in which 65
simulation games were implemented finding that, compared to their peers who received
a more traditional education, students experiencing these showed learning benefits, i.e.,
an 11% increase in declarative knowledge, a 14% increase in procedural knowledge, and a
9% increase in knowledge-maintaining skills. More recently, studies of gamification have
highlighted that the learning approach includes questioning, goal setting, decision making,
and simulating, so that it possibly enhances learners’ motivation, interest, participation,
and comprehensive knowledge [1,11,12].
2.2. Blockchain Education
Since 2018 in South Korea, some universities have launched departments and training
courses for blockchain. Table 1 below lists the department management details of each uni-
versity. Overseas educational institutions are also conducting blockchain-related courses,
including MIT, EU Business school, Fordham University, and Hochschule Mittweida Uni-
versity; the outline content of the educational programs conducted by each institution
is shown in Table 1 [13]. Most schools have recently been running blockchain education
courses. While some schools conduct programs centered on blockchain technology itself,
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 3 of 24
others divide programs by subdividing blockchain technology, and some programs are
grafted onto other fields of study. These other fields of study include economics and
business—the fields are not diverse.

As illustrated above, blockchain education programs primarily target adults or tal-
ented blockchain students whether in South Korea or elsewhere around the world, but there
are also blockchain education programs targeting younger population segments. A univer-
sity in South Korea introduced an effective educational tool that easily teaches blockchain
to students 16 years of age or older, a teaching and learning method that utilizes a technical
play called ‘Village Coin’ and a boardgame [14]. The play consists of four acts—its contents
deal with the value of money, the issue of exchange of money and goods, currency evapo-
ration, security and trust in the local currency, and the blockchain. In addition, the Village
Coin board game was designed to convey how to replace the financial elements of banking,
real estate ownership, and currency with blockchain technology, which was developed
based on the Monopoly game. The education model, which combines play and board
games, was found to be suitable for conveying complex technical ideas to students. Games
represent a convenient tool for in-depth education of cryptography and blockchain theory.
In an example of research on use of this educational model to teach blockchain technology
to elementary school students, card games and worksheets were used to help students
understand the core principles of preventing forgery and alteration of the blockchain [15].
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 4 of 24
The card game allowed all participants to obtain a total sum for two words selected by the
learner, and if the words gave the same sum, the learner obtained a score so that the learner
could learn the principle of the hash of the blockchain. Game players could learn the
distributed record ledger by writing down the sum of the obtained scores in their respective
worksheets. Thus, gamification is a tool that can be used for teaching blockchain technology
to students in elementary, middle, and high schools [14,15], and many educators use games
to teach complex and challenging skills to young learners [8]. Boardgames were developed
in some cases to teach blockchain mechanisms, public blockchain, and private blockchain to
children [16]. The boardgame developers thought that blockchain education targeting chil-
dren or teenagers needed to focus on helping them understand blockchain principles using
metaphor rather than through in-depth use of the technology [16]. Accordingly, conceptual
principles or types of blockchain were incorporated into the educational contents and the
education programs were designed to utilize a variety of media, including educational
skits, learning games, cartoons, video clips, etc., to encourage students to self-direct in
learning and develop an interest in the learning content.
2.3. Instructional Design Using ASSURE Model
The ASSURE (Analyze learners-State objectives-Select methods, media, and materials-
Utilize media and materials-Require learner participation-Evaluate and revise) model
proposed by Heinich et al. [17] refers to an education system or set of guidelines that can
be used by teachers in developing teaching plans that use digital technologies [18]. The
model is a teaching model that specifies how instructors can appropriately use a variety
of media while delivering a lecture. In particular, the model regards educational media,
teaching aids, and lesson materials as critical to the level and quality of teaching content.
Furthermore, the model emphasizes how to utilize digital technology-enabled teaching
media in the ADDIE (Analysis-Design-Develop-Implement-Evaluate) model, frequently
used as a teaching design model to enable learners to be more focused. Therefore, the
model is deemed appropriate for utilizing online tools to provide contextualized education
in on and offline classrooms in accordance with the changes in classroom environments in
the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The six steps, questions, and strategies for designing lessons in accordance with the
ASSURE Model are described in Table 2 [19].
In Step 1, demographics, general characteristics, learning style, and entry competencies
of learners are analyzed. In Step 2, objectives of lessons to be developed are stated; learning
outcomes to be achieved by fulfilling the objectives can be assessed, which can be conducive
to providing and configuring a learning environment. Mager’s [20] principles for stating
the objectives can be used to guide the formulation of lesson objectives, focusing on learners
and suggesting behavioral targets for them in order to design a learner-directed lesson. The
principles imply that it is necessary to suggest conditions in which observable behaviors
are triggered and specify standards by which the fulfillment of lesson objectives can be
assessed [19]. In Step 3, teaching methods, media, and/or materials are selected. In
this step, existing materials can be analyzed to plan and configure methods, media, and
materials suitable for the education program to be designed. Instructors must consider
lesson formats and methods that can contribute to learner outcomes and the fulfillment of
specified teaching objectives. Elements of new material design review include objectives,
targeted audience, costs, facilities, time, etc. In Step 4, the media and materials specified in
Step 3 are reviewed for their on-site applicability. The contents of teaching materials are
assessed to see if they can contribute to fulfilling instructional objectives. In addition, the
elements of contents that instructors need to be aware of before the contents are applied
directly on educational sites are reviewed, if any. In Step 5, how to engage learners in classes
is discussed. A wide range of teaching techniques is considered before a technique that can
ensure an optimized teaching effect is specified. As learners are encouraged to engage in
classes, they will be more focused and stand a better chance of understanding lessons. In
the final step, the developed teaching program is assessed. By this step, the teaching model
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 5 of 24
can be finally refined and supplemented to deliver a more complete education program.
Educational programs are primarily assessed as they are applied to learners or instructors
on a pilot basis and their effectiveness analyzed. Such an effectiveness analysis can identify
improvement opportunities in applicable education programs and competencies to which
the programs are directly beneficial.

A host of education programs based on the ASSURE model have been developed.
Karakis et al. [20] designed a mathematical lesson on fractional numbers, utilizing computer-
aided media in accordance with the teaching design principles of the ASSURE model.
They improved the proficiency of students with their lessons and emphasized that the
educational materials and activities developed in the lesson had positive impacts on the
attitude of students toward computer-aided lessons. Mehmet [21] planned an English
language instruction on the basis of the ASSURE model. As the planned education program
was applied to students, most of them enjoyed the activities and materials provided in
the program, and successfully performed the exercises provided in class [18]. As such, the
ASSURE model is frequently used in education research designs for a variety of applications
utilizing digital media, delivering educational effects.
3. Methodology
The purpose of this research was to teach blockchain at the children’s level to enable
students to understand the conceptual principles underpinning blockchain and, ultimately,
to develop an interest in it. To fulfill this purpose, we decided to develop an education
program. To develop the education program, teaching design models were first analyzed,
and the ASSURE model emphasizing the utilization of digital media was selected among
the existing teaching design models as the development model for the education program,
as opposed to the more popularized ADDIE model [17]. Then, the education program was
designed in accordance with the six steps in the ASSURE model (Figure 1).

First of all, in the ‘Analyze Learners’ step, the audience targeted by the education 
program was selected by analyzing the findings from the 2018–2020 survey on desired 
jobs and digital literacy of South Korean elementary school students [22–25]. Secondly, in 
the ‘State Objectives’ step, the purpose of the education program was clearly specified. 
The objectives were stated in detail in accordance with Mager’s [19] objective statement 
principle of the ‘Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree (ABCD)’ method. Education 
experts and blockchain technology specialists collaborated in specifying the instructional 
objectives. Thirdly, to select teaching methods and media, blockchain education methods 
and tools, media, and materials, etc., used in designing education programs recently after 
the COVID-19 outbreak, were analyzed. To develop teaching methods and materials, we 
studied references in the study literature to identify and organize techniques and 
materials used in blockchain education programs. The studies covered in the literature 
review included educational development research on blockchain education, targeting 
not only elementary students, but also graduate students of business schools or adults. As 
the studies covering blockchain teaching methods for elementary students were too few, 
it was hard to restrict the studies. Accordingly, we expanded the scope of the targeted 
audience. We analyzed a total of six studies: three targeting elementary students, two 
covering undergraduate students, and one for adults familiar with java technology [16,26–
29]. The analysis findings were used as inputs for selecting teaching methods and  the 
media to be developed and utilized. Fourthly, the teaching methods and media selected 
in Step 3 were used to develop worksheets and instructional materials to be used in the

were used to develop worksheets and instructional materials to be used in the education
program proposed. The content of the education program was quantitatively verified for
validity by a panel of ten blockchain technology and pedagogy experts, including one
professor of elementary school computer education, two doctoral students of computer
education, and six blockchain technology researchers, and their feedback regarding the
appropriateness of the designed education contents was gathered. A CVR value was
calculated by applying the content validity ratio (CVR) equation for the quantification
study of Lawshe [30] extensively used in social science studies. The mathematical formula
for the above is as shown in Equation (1), where N is the total number of the assessors and
ne is the number of assessors who responded that it is adequate.
Content Validity Ratio =

(1)
According to Lawshe’s [30] study, the minimum CVR is 0.62 when the number of
assessors is 10. Therefore, the educational contents were deemed to be viable in this research
when the CVR value was at or above 0.62. For the standards for developing instructional
aids, the standards and questions concerning considerations for instructional aid selection
in Shim et al.’s [31] study were referenced. They claimed that instructional aids must be
safe, appropriate, durable, and cost-effective from functional perspectives. Accordingly, the
instructional aids, including cards, boards, and ledgers developed in this research, were put
to viability review from all those four perspectives. In Step 5, how to encourage learners to
engage in the program was specified. It is necessary to motivate learners to actively engage
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 7 of 24
in learning. Accordingly, in this study, motivation techniques primarily used in educational
program design were retrieved from the existing literature and an appropriate strategy
to motivate learners to engage in the program was determined. Lastly, in the ‘Evaluate
and Revise’ step, the learning games and education program based on such games were
designed and evaluated with reference to the elements specified and designed from Steps
1 to 5. The education program was refined and rendered more complete as informed
by the evaluation findings. To evaluate the education program, focus group interviews
(FGIs) were conducted. The FGIs were conducted with the ten experts who participated in
the validity assessment in Step 4 of the ASSURE model and their expert feedback on the
strengths and weaknesses of the education program was gathered. The interview findings
were converted to text by an AI-enabled language processing application, and keywords
were retrieved from the gathered data using the social network analysis software NetMiner
4.3 program, and topic modeling analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was
conducted. Keywords in unstructured data of text format were extracted and converted to
structured data, and networks were generated from the extracted keywords and rendered
into visualized representations.

4.1.1. Analyze Learners
The purpose of this process was to provide a basis for facilitation of a comprehensive
comparison of the prospective jobs desired by elementary school students in South Korea.
This job comparison was intended to assess how much the learners were interested in jobs
related to the cutting-edge technologies of the future. According to a survey conducted
by the South Korean Ministry of Education for three years from 2018 to 2019 and 2020 on
23,223 students of 1200 schools across South Korea, including 6352 in elementary schools,
8339 in middle schools, and 8532 in high schools, the students desired a variety of jobs,
but revealed a similar pattern [22]. Regardless of their school grades, all students were
found to favor roles as athletes and teachers the most. What was noteworthy was the
rank of computer scientists or software developers related to blockchain; when the top
ten desired jobs per school grade were compared, elementary school students did not
desire jobs related to cutting-edge technologies. Those jobs ranked 10th in 2018, and 9th
in 2019. They did not appear in the top ten jobs in 2020. Among high school students,
computer-related jobs were ranked at higher places than among middle school students.
They ranked 8th in 2018, 4th in 2019, and 7th in 2020. By this comparison, we can see
that preference for jobs utilizing cutting-edge technologies of the future, such as computer
or blockchain technology, lower among the elementary school students than among the
middle school and high school students. A comparison of desired jobs per year is shown in
Table 3.
Digital literacy means certain competencies for understanding and utilizing digital
technologies [32]. This encompasses, beyond simple familiarity with computers, compe-
tencies for communication enabled by digital technology or devices, adaptability to the
digital environment, or combinations of such qualities. Blockchain is also empowered
by digital technologies, and the level of digital literacy may suggest how amenable the
learner is toward blockchain concepts and how a blockchain education program should be
designed. The digital literacy survey of South Korean elementary school students, covering
11,055 learners in 2018, 8847 in 2019, and 9611 in 2020, was reviewed. Table 4 shows the
means and standard deviations of digital literacy per element [23–26].

According to the survey, when the digital literacy scores in all areas were summarized,
the mean and standard deviation were the highest in 2018 at 17.23 and 5.96 respectively, and
the lowest in 2019 at 16.39 and 6.27, respectively. Among the ICT elements, the ‘Organize

standard deviation at 1.89 and 1.19 in 2018, 2.13 and 1.28 in 2019, and 2.15 and 1.28 in
2020, respectively. Among the CT elements, the mean scores for ‘Automation’ were all
found to be low when compared with ‘Abstraction’, with the mean and standard deviation
at 1.92 and 1.30 in 2018, 1.77 and 1.31 in 2019, and 1.72 and 1.37 in 2020, respectively.
These statistics suggest that in terms of digital literacy, South Korean elementary school
students found it relatively challenging to gather data or convert it into a different format
to solve problems. In addition, it was confirmed that it was difficult for them to design
and implement a program according to the algorithm. Therefore, we infer that when we
develop an education program, it is important to provide an experience where students
can solve problems or organize/create information using blockchains.

When designing the education program, we intended, firstly, to promote understand-
ing of and interest in blockchain among the elementary students, and to foster talent for a
sustainable future with quality education programs. To specifically state the objectives, we
used the audience, behavior, condition, degree (ABCD) method, the objective statement of
the Mager principles [19]. Figure 2 details the educational objectives specified in accordance
with Mager’s [19] objective statement principles applied to this education program.

Figure 2. Instructional Objectives. 
Firstly, in terms of audience, it is emphasized that it is important for instruction 
design to focus on what is done by learners rather than by instructors. To configure a 
lesson systematically, it needs to be recognized that the fulfillment of an objective is 
determined by what is performed by whom. Specifying an instructional objective starts 
from the statement of what is converted by whom. In Step 1 of the ASSURE model, 
‘Analyze Learners’, it was found that the South Korean elementary school students did 
not prefer jobs requiring digital technologies and strong computing competency, and 
faced difficulties with information-enabled problem-solving skills or 
Figure 2. Instructional Objectives.
Firstly, in terms of audience, it is emphasized that it is important for instruction design
to focus on what is done by learners rather than by instructors. To configure a lesson
systematically, it needs to be recognized that the fulfillment of an objective is determined by
what is performed by whom. Specifying an instructional objective starts from the statement
of what is converted by whom. In Step 1 of the ASSURE model, ‘Analyze Learners’, it was
found that the South Korean elementary school students did not prefer jobs requiring digital
technologies and strong computing competency, and faced difficulties with information-
enabled problem-solving skills or creation/implementation of information. Therefore,
elementary school learners in South Korea were defined as the audience for the education
program proposed. Secondly, in terms of ‘Behavior’, competency or behavior to be attained
by learners through education is specified. As this education program was intended to
foster understanding of and interest in blockchain among elementary students, it needed to
be determined whether learners could understand and act on the consensus mechanism of
blockchain and conceptual principles of blockchain types among various concepts related
to blockchain. Actions expected after the application of this education program are that
the learners can express the foundational concepts and principles of blockchain in their
own language. Thirdly, ‘Condition’ means circumstances or conditions in which a learner’s
behavior can be manifested. We would like our education program to enable learners
to understand blockchain better. Furthermore, we expect the program to be effective in
helping elementary school students learn concepts related to cutting-edge technologies
in practical art classes and innovation classes of creative activities programs. Fourthly,
‘Degree’ is intended to provide for benchmarks assessing the fulfillment of objectives. We
did not restrict the learning performance assessment standards to the understanding of
blockchain concepts but to the improvement of problem-solving skills and digital literacy
enabled by blockchain. We designed the education program to encourage learners to
develop an interest in blockchain and to be inclined to learn and study the subject with a
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 10 of 24
stronger commitment, by experiencing and understanding the principles of blockchain.
After all, what matters in fostering talents from the perspective of sustainable development
education is not just knowledge about blockchain but also understanding of and insight
into blockchain.
Thus, the educational program described in this paper allows elementary school
learners to handle various areas of knowledge and information that can reasonably solve
problems to cultivate the creative convergence talents required by future societies. It can
also contribute to fostering elementary school learners’ ability to handle interdisciplinary
fields of knowledge and information so that they can reasonably solve problems and
cultivate creative convergence talents required by future societies. Specifically, we intended
to convey understanding of blockchain principles, a key technology in the fourth industrial
revolution, and to remove psychological fear about blockchain to provide a foothold to
enable students to grow into experts.
4.1.3. Select Method, Media, or Materials
In this step, instructional methods and media or materials required for lessons were
selected. Table 5 shows analysis findings on the instructional methods and tools for teaching

Using code-based methods
to teach blockchain to
accountants was feasible
and instructive.
In terms of instructional methods for blockchain, experimental learning and simulation
were included in all the six studies. In addition, gamification, problem-based learning,
and lecture were used in five of them. Discussion was used in none of the studies. This
indicates that experiments or games are included in programs targeting both children and
adults, unless the programs are intended to cover blockchain technology in-depth, and that
the programs are designed to deliver problem-based learning beyond the understanding of
blockchain concepts, so that the learners can solve problems encountered in daily life. In
addition, expert lectures were included to assist with the understanding of concepts rather
than simple experiments.
In terms of educational tools, including blockchain education media and materi-
als, unplugged worksheets were included in all programs targeting elementary students.
Blockchain education programs targeting adults used software programs, such as java
applications or R-based coding programs, or bespoke online software. Some lessons used in-
structional materials designed for undergraduate classes, not just for blockchain education.
None of the six studies used online video clips in classes. The use of unplugged work-
sheets in all programs targeting elementary students seems to have factored in the level of
elementary school learners or lack of digital infrastructure in schools. However, as online
classes are extensively used in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of
worksheets utilizing online tools may be required.
Therefore, this study used an instructional method containing games accompanying
experiments. In addition, the instructor’s lectures and briefings were added as precursors
to instructional games to improve the understanding of students. Furthermore, online
tool-based worksheets were developed in addition to unplugged worksheets compatible
with conventional classroom environment to ensure continuity of lessons in an online
environment in the event that tele-learning classes were needed at short notice.
4.1.4. Utilize Media and Materials
Design Educational Contents
In Step 3, we selected instructional methods and tools. Educational content was con-
figured based upon the selection, and instructional materials were developed to enable
systematic instruction. Standards for educational content required to be included in the
lectures of instructors to help with the understanding of learners were established. It was
necessary to configure the educational content to help learners develop basic knowledge
without encompassing an excessively broad scope, and in-depth details of the level of learn-
ers was applied. Given that blockchain lessons are not included in the current educational
curriculum of South Korea and therefore it is hard for teachers to allocate a significant
amount of time, the blockchain education program was designed to consist of two or three
lessons, so that it could be readily deployed on-site. We designed the educational contents
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 12 of 24
with reference to the blockchain education programs analyzed in Step 3, primarily drawing
upon Kim and Park’s [16] educational contents. They dealt with the basic concepts and
types of blockchain in their educational content. Jung et al.’s [15] study focused on the
tamper-proofing mechanism of blockchain and proposed an education program focused on
the mechanism. Choi and Koo’s [27] study dealt with the concepts and formation process
of blockchain, distributed storing of blockchain, encryption and validation of blockchain,
the connection of blockchains, and cases of blockchain utilization, designing educational
content consisting of six lessons. These two studies were referenced in terms of instructional
method and material development.
Lesson 1 of the designed educational contents dealt with the basic concepts of blockchain,
with lessons 2 and 3 covering the types of blockchain. The basic concepts of blockchain
in lesson 1 included the features of blockchain, the principle of distributed storing, con-
sensus mechanism, and the basic concept of cryptocurrency. Lesson 2 focused on public
blockchains, covering their features, principles, strengths, and weaknesses, and utiliza-
tion cases. Lesson 3 dealt with private blockchains, describing their features, principles,
strengths and weaknesses, and utilization cases. The developed educational contents were
deemed to be viable by all panel members, with a minimum CVR value of 0.78. Details
of the findings are shown in Table 6. Therefore, the educational contents of the education
program developed were deemed to be viable.

including worksheets usable in on and offline environments. Figure 3 shows unplugged
worksheets usable in offline classes and online worksheets that can be used when remote
lessons are adopted in place of offline classes.

Figure 3. Unplugged and/or online interactive worksheets. 
The worksheets were designed to ask open-type questions by which teachers could 
check and revisit content learned in classes while delivering a lecture. In addition, the 
same worksheets were adapted to online interactive worksheets on the Liveworksheets 
platform. Blank boxes were included in the online worksheets to allow students to freely 
state their comments, and teachers were permitted to evaluate and provide feedback on 
the worksheets completed by students on the online platform. 
Design Educational Games and Tools 
After lesson-specific educational content was designed, corresponding educational 
games and tools were developed. Three educational games were developed to help the 
students understand the consensus mechanism and foundational principles of public and 
private blockchains among the concepts of blockchain. The blockchain educational games 
proposed in this paper were produced based on vital elements of a well-designed 
educational game according to Shute and Ke [33]. Elements proposed by them are specific 
objectives/rules, interactive problem solving, adaptive challenge, ongoing feedback, 
uncertainty, control, and sensory stimuli. The educational games proposed were 
described per game element as shown in Appendix A. 
The first educational game is a learning game designed to help with the 
understanding of consensus mechanism which is one of the foundational concepts of 
blockchain. In the first step, teams of two players are organized and a set of cards is given 
to each party. The team members place six white cards face down. Each team member 
shouts one of the cryptocurrency symbols and turns around each card of the opponent 
team at the same time. If the cryptocurrency symbol of the turned card matches the 
symbol shouted, the applicable player can take the card of the opponent team. When all 
white cards placed are used up, the game is played with blue cards. The basic rules are 
the same, but two cryptocurrency symbols must be shouted and two cards of the 
opponent team turned around this time. If both symbols are matched, two cards of the 
opponent team can be taken. Lastly, when it comes to red cards, three red cards of the 
opponent team can be taken only when three cryptocurrency symbols are matched. A 
player who has won two out of three rounds is the final winner. Figure 4 shows an 
example of instructional tools developed for the educational game.

Figure 4. Card Samples for Blockchain Consensus Mechanism Game. 
The second educational game designed was used in Lesson 2 to help the students 
understand the principle of a public blockchain. Each student starts with 50 coins. When 
the game is ready, every student chooses the color they want on the board. Students place 
their markers on the board in the color they choose. Students decide the order of the games 
by rock-paper-scissors. When the game starts, a player throws the dice in front of all 
players. Every student records every transaction on the ledger every time he/she throws 
the dice. The player throws the dice and moves the marker forward when the number 
comes out. He/she can throw the dice once more if the destination’s color is the same as 
the color of his/her choice. Double trading is possible in the next transaction. If the number 
of dice is odd, the player should pay coins to the other party, and if the number is even, 
he/she can take the other’s coins. The last remaining person will be the winner, or the 
person who has obtained the most coins in a set time will be the winner. If the player does 
not have coins, he/she can sell his/her slot to the other party, and the price is ten coins. It 
is important to note that all of these transactions must be recorded in their ledgers by all 
students. 
The last learning game is intended to help with the understanding of the principle of 
private blockchain. Unlike a public blockchain, when teachers and students play a private 
blockchain game, they need to select students who play designated intermediaries. 
During this process, students can naturally feel the difference depending on the type of 
blockchain. It is also understandable that the concept of decentralization or transaction 
transparency can be blurred in private blockchains since game participants give records 
of transactions to intermediaries. Figure 5 shows a sample of teaching aids for public and 
private blockchains.

The validity of the teaching aids was verified to assess whether the learning games 
developed were applicable on education sites. The same experts who participated in the 
validation of the educational contents took part in the teaching aid verification. Validity 
assessment outcomes of the teaching aids and contents developed are as shown in Table

cards, boards, and ledgers were safe and suitable for education in all respects. In 
particular, in terms of economic efficiency, CVR values were the highest with CVR = 0.94 
for cards, CVR = 0.95 for boards, and CVR = 0.96 for ledgers. This indicated that the 
teaching aids were sufficiently usable even in a poorly equipped classroom environment. 
With respect to durability, the teaching aids were found to be viable, but CVR values were 
somewhat lower than for other items, with CVR = 0.69 for cards, CVR = 0.75 for boards, 
and CVR = 0.72 for ledgers. Therefore, it was inferred that the developed aids need to be

Step 5 of the ASSURE model is about developing a method to motivate learners to
engage in games. It is important to design elements of motivation properly to enable
learners to actively participate in classes. All the previous blockchain education studies
referenced in Step 3 included elements of competition to motivate learners to engage in
class. However, Dettling and Bettina’s [28] study offered coins as rewards and used Ap-
playing to further boost the attention level of students. Jung et al.’s [15] study offered
certification for each objective to be fulfilled. Rewards in games play a critical role in
encouraging the engagement of learners. Accordingly, the education program developed
offered coins to winners to encourage the learners to participate more actively in games.
These rewards can add more dynamism to learning games and allow students to feel as if
they were trading cryptocurrencies in reality.

In the analysis, for the strengths, occurrence frequency was in the order of student 
(8.0), learning games (6.0), blockchain (6.0), school (5.0), and worksheet (4.0). This 
indicates that most of the students were satisfied with the blockchain education method 
using worksheets and learning games in class. In contrast, for weaknesses, occurrence 
frequency was in the order of student (11.0), learning games (7.0), blockchain (7.0), school 
(4.0), education (4.0), and level (2.0), which suggests that some students wanted difficulty 
level to be added to the blockchain learning game used in class. Table 8 shows the analysis 
outcomes of degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities for keywords in the 
strengths and weaknesses identified in expert interviews. 
In the degree centrality analysis associated with the strengths of the program, degree 
centrality was found to be 0.25 or under for each word. Eigenvector centrality was rated 
to be 0.3 or higher for ‘blockchain’, ‘education’, and ‘learning games’. In the betweenness 
centrality analysis, ‘blockchain’ and ‘school’ showed a betweenness centrality of 0.2 or 
higher. In contrast, in the degree centrality analysis associated with the weaknesses of the 
program, ‘difficulty’, ‘student’, ‘blockchain’, ‘education’, ‘learning games’, and ‘school’ 
showed higher degree centrality values of 0.97 or more, whereas the eigenvector centrality 
was 0.29 or higher for ‘student’, ‘blockchain’, and ‘learning games’. These analysis 
outcomes suggest that associated words are used frequently in school classes to describe

In the degree centrality analysis associated with the strengths of the program, degree
centrality was found to be 0.25 or under for each word. Eigenvector centrality was rated
to be 0.3 or higher for ‘blockchain’, ‘education’, and ‘learning games’. In the betweenness
centrality analysis, ‘blockchain’ and ‘school’ showed a betweenness centrality of 0.2 or
higher. In contrast, in the degree centrality analysis associated with the weaknesses of
the program, ‘difficulty’, ‘student’, ‘blockchain’, ‘education’, ‘learning games’, and ‘school’
showed higher degree centrality values of 0.97 or more, whereas the eigenvector centrality
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 17 of 24
was 0.29 or higher for ‘student’, ‘blockchain’, and ‘learning games’. These analysis outcomes
suggest that associated words are used frequently in school classes to describe the strength
of the program designed to teach the principles of blockchain and indicate that, to address
the weaknesses of the program, learners need to be supported in connection with their
challenges or in-depth activities prepared, depending on the varying level of learners.

To retrieve topics out of experts’ unstructured feedback, LDA-based topic modeling
was conducted. To filter words, the TF-IDF threshold was set to 0.5 and word length to
2 in a bid to eliminate frequently used words and words composed of two or fewer let-
ters. Figure 7 shows the 2-mode spring visualization of the relations among top keywords

all with high relevance to ‘learning games’. As for each topic, Topic-1 consisted of such
words as ‘research’, ‘school’, ‘literature’, ‘trouble’, etc., with ‘learning games’ in the center.
Based on these findings, Topic-1 suggests that the learning games were well designed, even
though not many previous studies for learning games played in school were available.
Topic-2 consists of ‘learning games’, ‘students’, ‘worksheet’, ‘understanding’, and ‘fun’,
etc. To sum up, these topics indicated that the learning games and worksheets were
configured to be interesting to and readily comprehensible by students. Topic-3 includes
‘learning games’, ‘blockchain’, ‘education’, ‘school’, ‘case’, and ‘site’, which suggests that
the experts believe that the blockchain education program using learning games is suitable
for deployment in school sites. Lastly, Topic-4 consists of ‘learning games’, ‘students’,
‘worksheets’, ‘imagination’, and ‘way’. This indicates that the use of learning games and
worksheets is effective in stimulating the imagination of students.
In the topic modeling of weaknesses, four topics were finally extracted. Unlike the
strengths, several words were evenly distributed for the weaknesses rather than one
dominant word. Firstly, Topic-1 comprised ‘education’, ‘difficulty’, ‘scalability’, ‘class’,
and ‘improvement’, which indicates that the developed education program needs to be
improved in terms of extensibility if it is to be used in classes. Topic-2 contained ‘re-
search, ‘learning games’, ‘COVID19′, ‘Post-COVID19′, and ‘research’. Words related to
COVID-19 appeared in this topic, indicating that studies utilizing learning games are ever
more required in the post-COVID 19-era. Topic-3 included ‘student’, ‘school’, ‘principle’,
‘blockchain’, and ‘course’, etc., which suggests that the principles of blockchain covered
in the education program are restricted. Lastly, Topic-4 included ‘education’, ‘level’, ‘com-
pleteness’, ‘difficulty’, and ‘improvement’. This indicates that the topic suggests that the
level of difficulty needs to be added to the education program for completeness.

5. Discussion
We developed an educational program based on learning games in an effort to en-
courage elementary students to have more interest in blockchain and to foster the talent
of those well-versed in blockchain technology. The education program was developed in
accordance with the instruction design steps of the ASSURE model that emphasizes the
utilization of instructional media.
We first analyzed learners to select elementary school learners. In the survey, fewer
South Korean elementary school students were found to favor engineer or software de-
veloper jobs directly related to computing technology than other school-age groups. Fur-
thermore, in the digital literacy analysis of elementary school students, South Korean
elementary students were found to have difficulties with organizing/creating information
or converting it into different formats in general. It is necessary to underscore competencies
for creating new things beyond playing games and solving problems with given infor-
mation. It is also worthwhile studying the relevance of this education program to digital
literacy. Since blockchain has the high latent potential to promote coordination, coopera-
tion, and trust with technologies, artifacts, and cultural forms as the next step in a human
tradition, we need to put in a great deal of effort encouraging learners to acquire sufficient
digital literacy of their secure digital infrastructure, public access to online resources, and
public computing [34].
Secondly, educational objectives were specified. Instructional objectives were de-
scribed in detail according to Mager’s [19] A-B-C-D principle. It was concluded that it is
important to conduct learner-centered education and teach students to express what has
been learned in their own language. This approach allowed the learners to reflect on what
they learned in open-type sentences in worksheets. When this program was applied in
practical arts classes or creative activities programs, improvement in problem-solving skills
and digital literacy of learners was specified as the standard applicable to the assessment
of the fulfillment of such educational objectives. If the program effectiveness is analyzed as
to changes in those competencies when this education program is applied to students in
subsequent studies, meaningful insight may be obtained.
Thirdly, with regard to the selection of educational methods, media, and materials, we
examined previous studies on the blockchain education program to analyze duplicated
elements and define an educational method design strategy combined with lecture, ex-
perimental learning, gamification, problem-based learning, and simulations. Recognizing
the significance of both unplugged worksheets and online-compatible worksheets for el-
ementary school learners, we also developed worksheets usable even in remote lessons,
using the Liveworksheets platform. Additional studies are needed to scale up the learning
games proposed to be deployable, not only in offline classes, but also in online learning
environments. Using the additional competencies of innovative emerging technological
applications, such as blockchain, educators in the online and distance learning system,
which has flourished with the use and support of the ICTs, should play a crucial role in
terms of delivery instruction and interactive communication [35]. Within an educational
context, blockchain can empower individual learners to manage and share details of their
credentials without a trusted intermediary through an indisputable mechanism to verify
that the data has existed at a moment [36].
Fourthly, educational content was designed and teaching aids were utilized. To that
end, the reference literature covered in Step 3 was consulted. Then, the validity of the
developed educational contents and tools was assessed by experts. In the analysis, all CVR
values were found to be 0.62 or higher, which indicates that the contents and tools were
viable. However, the CVR of the durability of the developed educational tools tended
to be somewhat lower, which suggests that the tools need to be made of sturdier and
longer-lasting materials.
Fifthly, in Step 5, how to motivate learners to engage more in games was analyzed
in relation to previous studies examined in Steps 3 and 4. It was found that a reward
in coins was needed. However, such coins need to be developed from the ground up
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3771 19 of 24
in consideration of the economic efficiency of physical coin material. Chivu et al. [37]
suggested that a reward system has a critical role in enabling learners to be actively
involved in learning blockchain technologies. In terms of the potential for blockchain to
represent an innovative technological paradigm shift that helps security, simplification,
and efficiency, it is necessary to instill understanding of the core of blockchain in education
beyond infancy [37].
In the last step, the developed education program was evaluated and improvement
opportunities were identified. In the analysis of experts’ feedback on the strengths and
weakness, the assessed level with the learning game design was high. Yet, there was also
feedback that the level of difficulty needed to be increased and the game design expanded
to allow students of a wider range of age groups to participate in the education program.
Therefore, more in-depth study is deemed necessary to add level of difficulty to the program
design so that the program can be compatible with learners of more diverse literacy levels.
According to previous studies that have tried to develop teaching materials for integrated
education for elementary school students, dynamic materials that lead to self-directed
learning are helpful to effectively bring about learning outcomes [27,38]. Some studies
have found that learning models focusing on motivation and creativity might increase
the potential of learners during their understanding of cutting-edge technologies [37,39].
Though this paper can provide a basis for further research to develop or improve learning
programs using new technological concepts underlying trends of industries, there are still
challenges concerning how the learning content, materials, or models can be contextualized
depending on individual learning needs.
6. Conclusions
Blockchain, promoted as one of the foundational technologies for the fourth industrial
revolution, is becoming ever more important [40]. The compromised trust of public insti-
tutions and the financial crisis have prompted many people to look for new transactional
arrangements, and the concept of blockchain guaranteeing trust through decentralization
has emerged as a new stream of innovation [41].
Many attempts have recently been made to incorporate blockchain principles into
education, but the method of teaching elementary school students has yet to be studied [14].
Thus, this study has proposed an education program that can teach blockchain principles
using games. The education program was developed based on the ASSURE model and
was intended to evaluate the possibility of field application.
The blockchain education program developed consists of three lessons: Lesson 1
covers the basic concepts and principles of blockchain, Lesson 2, public blockchain, and
Lesson 3, private blockchain. Each lesson includes learning games that are to be played by
students after teachers deliver a lecture and organize worksheet activities. By playing the
learning games, students can spontaneously improve their understanding of blockchain
concepts. When experts’ feedback on the developed education program was summed up,
the gamification method adopted to teach relatively complicated concepts to elementary
school learners through learning games was found to be effective. However, improvement
opportunities were also pointed out, for example, that the content of the education program
was somewhat limited and the level of difficulty and learner level-specific learning program
were not included in the content. In addition, the ultimate goal of the education program,
defined as the fostering of talents for sustainable future development with quality education
programs, requires the effectiveness of the program to be analyzed in reference to the SDGs
in subsequent studies. Subsequent activities following this study will focus in depth on
how to boost the extensibility of the education program and foster talent for sustainable
future development. Unlike previous studies that have leaned toward statistical analysis
of quantitative data, this study is significant in that it has attempted to utilize models and
visualize unstructured data contributed by experts. It is hoped that this article will provide
insight into education programs designed to teach cutting-edge technologies to elementary
students who are likely to be excluded from the scope of such programs.

Table A1. Educational Game Activities for the Element of Learning Game.
Periods Gamified Components Learning Activities
1
Specific objectives
To help players understand the principle of consensus mechanism
among blockchain concepts.
The game is won when all the cards of the opponent are taken.
Rules
Two sets of 18 cards in total, including six white, blue, and red cards,
respectively, are needed.
The cards are painted in respective colors on one side; and six
different cryptocurrency symbols are printed on the other side.
Logos of cryptocurrencies used in reality are used to stimulate the
interest of learners and allow them to experience the real use of
blockchain indirectly.
Interactive problem solving
Two people usually play the game, but it can also be played while
discussing in a team. If the players play in a team battle, they can
increase their unity by scoring points for each team.
Adaptive challenge
Teachers need time to explain the rules to the students before the
game so that they can understand the rules that depend on the color
of the cards.
Ongoing feedback
During the game, the teacher helps the game progress and develops
the game by investigating students’ difficulties during the game.
Because timing is important, this feedback increases the completeness
of the game through quick response.
Uncertainty
Students may develop suspense about unpredictable matches during
the game, leading to motivation for the game. Appropriate rewards
are given to ensure that the tension in the game leads to learning
motivation.
Control
It is necessary to create an environment where students concentrate
on the games to learn blockchain principles. Due to the nature of the
educational game, it will be mainly played in the classroom, and
although the game has rules, we encourage students to develop the
game by making rules.
Sensory stimuli
Through unplugged education activities, five senses were used to
play games with creativity during a game. Elementary school
students are especially crucial for developing the five senses, so
games that can utilize senses, such as sight, touch, and hearing, are
essential [42].

Specific objectives
This game aims to help students understand the principles
of the public blockchain and the characteristics of the
openness and transparency of the blockchain. In the process
of recording all transactions in the ledger, everyone can
learn the shortcomings of public blockchain in situations
where the game is delayed. On the other hand, the game is
structured so that players can understand the advantage
that it is difficult to forge because every player
records books.
Rules
Students and teachers need ledgers, dice, markers, game
boards, and coins. Since each player needs one marker, the
teacher should prepare enough to fit the number of students
and make four members of a team.
Interactive problem solving
The process of recording all transactions on the ledgers can
be cumbersome, but students cannot cooperate and show
their books to other students in the middle. It is because it
can increase the possibility of sharing wrong transactions.
Students can create their space during the game where they
can prepare telescopes or focus on games to avoid missing a
deal. Thus, when faced with a problem, students can
develop various measures to develop the power to solve
them independently.
Adaptive challenge
The game is similar to Monopoly, a boardgame, with the
possibility that more coins can be obtained through double
deals or land sales when there are not as many coins as other
students. It provides students with a chance to get up again
even if they are losing, rather than being easily frustrated.
Ongoing feedback
Teachers should try to solve the problem by quickly
investigating students’ inconvenience or incomprehension
while playing the game.
Uncertainty
Due to variables such as double trading and land sales, it is
difficult to predict who will be the winner and how the
game will proceed.
Control
In order to allow all students to see the dice, students create
a playing space where they can sit in a circle or see each
other; and they can also play games in a larger space, not in
the classroom. All students can play games actively and
even decorate the game space like a bank to arouse interest.
Sensory stimuli
The process of all students watching one dice throw or
making a deal and writing it down on the ledgers is a
process that stimulates five senses. Some students may use
tablet PCs or smartphones during the bookkeeping process.
It is up to the students themselves to write by hand or to use
IT devices. Each child may have a different stimulating
process, and the learning effect may vary accordingly [43].

Specific objectives The purpose of this game is to help students understand the
principles of private blockchain.
Rules
The rules of the game are basically the same as the public blockchain.
However, the different point is that the ledger is not written by all
students, but rather a few reliable students are selected. During the
game, transactions are impossible without the approval of the
students who write down the ledgers.
Interactive problem solving
Students in writing the ledgers role work together to prepare ledgers.
When players play games, they cannot trade without their approval.
During this process, brokers can consult with each other to approve
or deny transactions and solve problems together. Players can solve
problems in the event of a transaction by consulting with a broker.
Through these situations, students can develop problem-solving
skills through communication.
Adaptive challenge
The same challenges are given because this game is played in
essentially the same way as a public blockchain game. Those who
lack coins can consult with a broker to solve this problem, and in this
process, it can be an opportunity to learn this aspect of the
private blockchain.
Ongoing feedback
Teachers should quickly identify problems that arise while brokers
record transactions and host players’ games and provide appropriate
assistance. Rather than simply solving problems, it is crucial to teach
them how to solve them indirectly. Teachers should also be careful
not to cause problems that students cannot solve or are in an
emergency during the game.
Uncertainty
A few of the students may secretly consult with a broker to obtain
more coins by expedient behaviour. Since these variables can have a
strong influence on the game’s win or loss, it can be seen that there is
stronger uncertainty than in a public blockchain game.
Control
It is necessary to be cautious when selecting intermediaries to create a
game environment. Selecting students with a strong sense of trust
can facilitate the progress of the game. However, when selecting
students who lack trust from the other students, the game progresses
slowly, and there can be a war of nerves between brokers and players.
There is no right way between the two, but it is better to choose
considering game time or environment.
Sensory stimuli
Players and brokers will have different sensory stimuli because their
roles are different in the game. Various stimuli in games increase the
effectiveness of education and help develop.
