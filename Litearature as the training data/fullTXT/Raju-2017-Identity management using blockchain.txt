Abstract—Cloud-centric cognitive cellular networks utilize
dynamic spectrum access and opportunistic network access
technologies as a means to mitigate spectrum crunch and
network demand. However, furnishing a carrier with personally
identifiable information for user setup increases the risk of
profiling in cognitive cellular networks, wherein users seek
secondary access at various times with multiple carriers.
Moreover, network access provisioning – assertion, authentication,
authorization, and accounting – implemented in conventional
cellular networks is inadequate in the cognitive space, as
it is neither spontaneous nor scalable. In this paper, we
propose a privacy-enhancing user identity management system
using blockchain technology which places due importance
on both anonymity and attribution, and supports end-to-end
management from user assertion to usage billing. The setup
enables network access using pseudonymous identities, hindering
the reconstruction of a subscriber’s identity. Our test results
indicate that this approach diminishes access provisioning dura-
tion by up to 4x, decreases network signaling traffic by almost
40%, and enables near real-time user billing that may lead to
approximately 3x reduction in payments settlement time.

I. INTRODUCTION
The number of cellular connections and human population
are strikingly close, each estimated at around 7.5 billion. While
machines currently account for only 300 million, this number
is forecast to triple, surpassing a billion by 2020. Around this
same time, it is estimated that there will be an aggregate of 8.9
billion cellular connections worldwide, achieving a penetration
rate of 1.14 per capita [1].
As cellular services used by humans and between machines
continue to grow, so does the volume of data and network
traffic. Today, the total monthly cellular data traffic is pegged
at 8 exabyte, slated to be eight times this figure at the start of
the next decade. In the case of smartphones, social networking
ranks as the second largest traffic generator behind video
streaming [2].
With cellular services becoming the primary means for
people to interact socially and stay connected, ubiquitous
systematic observation of all subjects rather than a select
few has become the new normal. The growth in cellular
connections and data traffic exposes avenues for profiling and
increases privacy threats, now more than ever. These threats to
an individual’s right to privacy originate from institutions that
include pernicious elements, private enterprises, and public
entities [3]. As a result, issues regarding data collection and
individual privacy have entered public discourse.
In [4], we proposed a cloud-centric cognitive cellular
network (CCN) model to actualize dynamic spectrum
access, facilitating carrier-agnostic, spontaneous provisioning
of unaccredited users that spans the entire lifecycle, from
assertion to accounting. We introduced Identity and Credibility
Service (ICS) as a federated network element to ascertain
the legitimacy of a cognitive cellular user (CCU). The ICS
partners with CCNs and CCUs to provide user – subscriber
and device – assertion, authentication, and authorization ser-
vices. However, this setup neither accounted for nor was
it equipped with mechanisms to execute service contracts,
enable payments settlement, and more importantly, enhance
user privacy. We address these insufficiencies in our work by
using blockchain [5] technology to build the ICS.
A blockchain is a ledger to store cryptographically secured
records. A blockchain network has multiple users, where each
user is designated a pseudonymous identity. A contract dictates
the interactions between the users and the ledger. The use
of pseudonymous identities in a blockchain network presents
the possibility of separating the identity provider from the
network operator, with cryptographic contracts governing user
data access. Hence, it is vital to study blockchain for identity
management in the cellular domain to enhance privacy.
In this paper, we design the ICS using the privacy-enhancing
blockchain protocol (BCP) with the CCNs and CCUs as par-
ticipating nodes, and test BCP’s performance against current
network access protocols. We submit, to the best of our
knowledge, we are not aware of any existing work on user
identity management in cellular networks using blockchain.
Our approach presents these benefits:
1) uses shared secrets to prevent unauthorized access to
a subscriber’s personally identifiable information neces-
sary for user assertion,
2) limits data exposure by partitioning the blockchain data
store so that only the pseudonymous identity of a
subscriber is required for access provisioning,
3) enables app-specific credentials distinct from a
user’s network access credentials, which hinders the
reconstruction of a subscriber’s identity, and
4) supports a self-contained system with the necessary
structures to accommodate user setup, access contracts,
and usage billing.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
discusses related work, Section III network setup, and Section
IV experimental analysis. Section V presents final remarks.

During secondary access, a CCU has to provide only its MDN and UID to a CCN. Use of UIDs increases privacy and hinders profiling.
II. RELATED WORK
The protocol used across the telecommunications industry
to administer AAA is Diameter [6]. It is the lingua franca
for signaling between network elements, accounting for 70%
of all signaling traffic. By 2020, this protocol is expected to
surpass all global IP traffic by generating an estimated 395
million messages per second [7].
The growth in signaling traffic can be directly attributed
to an increase in teledensity, particularly cellular commu-
nications. As teledensity increases, it presents two sets of
challenges: one from an ethical viewpoint with regard to
subscriber profiling and individual privacy, and the other from
an engineering standpoint that concerns radio spectrum and
network demand.
Ethically, the “walled garden” approach to network access
and data services results in unprecedented user profiling by
governments and businesses alike [3], [8]. The adoption of
blockchain [9] can aid in the realization of trusted computing
[10]. In the context of engineering, as radio spectrum demand
grows, implementation of cognitive radio networks becomes
imperative [11]. These networks enable dynamic spectrum
access, but as users seek secondary network access from
multiple carriers, more personal data has to be shared with
multiple parties.
We therefore reason that in the realm of cognitive cellular
networks, established AAA protocols have limitations in
enhancing subscriber privacy and guaranteeing spontaneous
network access. We assert that a network built using BCP
can provide a comprehensive framework to address these
shortcomings. Our design takes a contracts-based approach
to dynamic spectrum and opportunistic network access. It
addresses some of the real-world challenges outlined in [12]
related to usage billing and payments settlement, while also
having provisions to facilitate service contracts in a privacy-
enhancing fashion [9], [13]. Notably, the pseudonymous nature
of BCP assures both anonymity and attribution by separating
a user’s personal data from access data.
III. NETWORK SETUP
The topology is set up as a cloud-centric cognitive cellular
network, as presented in [4] utilizing virtualized network
elements, which adds elasticity to spectrum and network
management.
The architecture is a two-layered federated access model,
as shown in Fig. 1, where a CCN is both the spectrum
owner and the network operator. A CCN operates in two
modes: primary network (PN) and secondary network (SN),
and services two distinct classes of CCUs: primary user (PU)
and secondary user (SU) [11]. A PU receives service primarily
from a PN, but it may also seek service as an SU from one
or more SNs depending on the payoff offered. The SUs are
unaccredited users of whom the SNs have no knowledge. The
Network Access Exchange (NAE) supplies the CCUs with
access contract options and the CCNs work with the ICS
to handle user identity assertion and contract management.
In addition, the CCNs poll the ICS to determine the number
of CCUs in a given geolocation which will aid the CCNs in
capacity planning and competing for new customers.
A. Blockchain
A blockchain is a secure, distributed database that in its
most elementary form is a digital ledger. This ledger leverages
peer-to-peer technology to list and link continuously added
records, where each record is termed a block. All blocks are
cryptographically signed and secured from accidental changes
or adversarial tampering. Each new block stores a set of trans-
actions and registers the hash of its preceding block to form a
chain of blocks. A blockchain network has a number of users
and every user has an assigned pseudonymous ID, for instance,
���������		��
������	��������������. There
are three network permissioning classes: public, consortium,
and private. The ICS is a private chain that grants users
network access only after assertion and approval [9]. The
interactions between the ICS, CCNs, and CCUs are governed
by smart contracts as elaborated in Section III-D.

(a) BCP signaling: Network access management from user
assertion to bill payment is within the CCN ecosystem.
(b) AAA signaling: Entities enabling seamless secondary
access and bill payment are outside the carrier’s ecosystem.

B. User Provisioning
There are two objectives to user provisioning, one to as-
sert the identity of a subscriber and the other to verify the
compliance of a device with regulatory requirements. During
the assertion process, a CCU supplies the ICS personally
identifiable information (PII), such as first name, last name,
address, etc. The ICS obtains the mobile directory number
(MDN) a PN has assigned the CCU, and subsequently gener-
ates a pseudonymous blockchain ID (UID) to uniquely identify
the subscriber’s account. The MDN is the subscriber’s phone
number, and the UID is an alphanumeric string similar to the
one mentioned in Section III-A.
All account information pertinent to a CCU (DCCU ) is
partitioned into two sets, one to facilitate attribution (DPII )
in order to maintain legal compliance, and another (DNAX )
to enable service provisioning, as given in (1):
DCCU = DPII ∪DNAX (1)
DPII ∩DNAX = {UID,MDN} (2)
To facilitate network access, the ICS shares with a CCN
the data from (2) and a CCU’s credit risk indicator (CRI)
to let a CCN decide the level of network authorization the
CCU should have. The risk index, CRI, may be derived from
multiple parameters such as a subscriber’s credit history, past
usage etiquette, etc., where a high score implies a high risk. In
this setup, a CCN may still collect metadata such as physical
location, call records, websites visited, usage pattern, etc. for
a given MDN, but cannot associate it directly with a real
person. Likewise, the ICS only has data that the CCU supplied
during identity assertion. This separation of personal and
metadata enhances personal privacy and impedes subscriber
profiling. Furthermore, the system is scalable, as CCNs need
not have an interconnect agreement with each other. As a
result, the architecture can grant opportunistic network access
by spontaneous provisioning of SUs [4].
C. Service Provisioning
In conventional cellular networks, when a user requires
network access while away from the home network, the
request may be brokered by an application such as Customized
Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL)
[14]. CAMEL is a suite of interconnect protocols to enable
voice and data for subscribers in a visited network (VN). Pe-
riodically, carriers exchange usage information and settle any
interconnect charges through banks using traditional financial
tools, such as the Automated Clearing House (ACH) [15].
After a CCU enters into an access agreement with a CCN,
the latter assigns a Mobile Identification Number (MIN) to the
CCU’s device. The MIN acts as a pointer to the subscriber’s
MDN i.e. MDN ← MIN . When a CCU switches between
CCNs, each CCN activates a MIN pointing to the MDN. This
interconnect setup based on number portability ensures a CCU
receives voice calls bound to its MDN, irrespective of the CCN
of which it is a customer.
D. Smart Contracts
The interactions between a CCU and a CCN are governed
by a smart contract [9] facilitated by the ICS for the trans-
actions shown in Fig. 2a. A smart contract in a blockchain
network is a complete set of instructions programmed to run
when prescribed conditions are met. A contract comprising of
data and logic resides in the blockchain network once signed
into motion and until such time it is ready to execute. Smart
contracts have two broad purposes. First, they enforce privacy
compliance between the CCU and the ICS with the intent
of deterring unapproved access to personal data, and second,
to establish a service level agreement between a CCU and
a CCN for network access. Once a CCU and a CCN enter
into a smart contract, it is then maintained and executed by
the ICS blockchain network. The contract clauses may include
provisions for arbitration, termination, choice of law, etc. that
protects the interests of customers and carriers alike.

E. Security
A blockchain network such as ICS relies on public-key
cryptography for transaction management. A CCU’s account
data is comprised of the 3-tuple cryptosystem, KCCU :
KCCU = (KRCCU ,KUCCU , UIDCCU ) (3)
The ICS assigns a CCU a unique pseudonymous address,
UIDCCU , derived from the hash of the CCU’s public key,
KUCCU . A CCU relays its UID to the CCNs when requesting
secondary network access. We assume no one but the CCU has
access to its private key, KRCCU .
Apart from CCUs, the ICS as well as each of the CCNs
have their own UIDs with which contract policies and payment
settlements between the CCUs and CCNs are handled. The
ICS provides the following privacy enhancements for a user,
and security benefits to a carrier:
1) User-centric: While the CCN does not know of a
CCU’s PII, the ICS has access to this data. Hence, after
successful completion of the identity assertion process, the
CCU’s PII provided to the ICS is encrypted. The secret key
used for encrypting the PII – KSCCU,ICS – is split and
shared between the CCU and the ICS using Shamir’s secret
sharing scheme. This transaction’s outcome is hashed and sent
to the blockchain for entry. The rules that govern access to
a subscriber’s data are defined in the contract, SCCCU,ICS .
Thus, any access or alteration to the PII cannot happen without
the consent of the CCU.
The aforementioned approach to identity management adds
a layer of deterrence to subscriber profiling. Nevertheless,
having one unique identification number still allows many
data services to reconstruct the identity of a subscriber based
on high-resolution data and deep-learning techniques [3]. To
prevent such reconstruction, apart from the UID, ICS allows a
CCU to randomly generate multiple pseudonymous identities
per account based on the KRCCU and KUCCU pair:
UIDCCU = {x ∈ [1..n]} (4)
A CCU thereby has the option to provide app-specific identi-
ties instead of its UID or MDN to programs that track metadata
related to a user such as places visited, call history, etc., as
part of a transaction [10], [13].
2) Carrier-centric: Cognitive radio networks take the com-
mons approach and rely on their users to gauge spectrum
utilization level [11]. The realization of cloud-centric CCNs
depends on CCU etiquette in honest spectrum sensing, report-
ing, and sharing. However, it is likely that a malicious CCU
may either over- or under-report spectrum utilization.
To mitigate this issue, we rely on the blockchain’s consensus
mechanism [16]. The purpose of consensus is to ensure peer
users in the network agree on a state before it is published
in the blockchain [9]. If some CCUs were to intentionally or
even inadvertently provide incorrect spectrum utilization data
not inline with the consensus, a CCN will reject the record.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
We use the Ethereum [17] blockchain implementation to
emulate the ICS. Our experiments are carried out on testnet –
a private, sandboxed Ethereum network. For the conventional
cellular setup, the 389 directory server is used for AAA.
Both networks are served on identical x86-64 dual processor
machines clocked at 3.8 GHz, and stocked with 16 GB of
RAM. The tests are run on CentOS GNU/Linux 7 platform.
We use three machines, each a hop from the other, to mimic
a user, network carrier and the federated identity manager.
To compare how the BCP scales vis-a-vis the AAA, identical
simulations are run on them. We use a simple key-based
authentication method to simulate access requests. Access
provisioning and signaling performance are analyzed for 2,500
users, blockchain partitioning based user provisioning for
10,000 users. Additionally, bill payments settlement time in
BCP is also evaluated.
Algorithm 1 Network Access Provisioning

2: status← false
3: if ({UIDCCU , MDNCCU} = known ) then
4: if (CRICCU < CRIthreshold) then � CRI ∈ [0..1]
5: status← KSC(UIDCCU , UIDCCN , NAEAID)
6: return status

8: return status

15: CRICCU ← 1 � CRI = 1 implies highest risk
16: if ({UIDCCU , MDNCCU} = known) then
17: CRICCU ← CRI(UIDCCU ,MDNCCU )
18: status← true
19: return {status, CRICCU}
20: else
21: return {status, CRICCU}
A CCU queries the NAE to identify a contract, NAEAID,
which provides the best service at the lowest cost. It initiates
the contract by establishing contact with the corresponding
CCN. The CCU relays its UIDCCU and MDNCCU as part
of this process. If it is an unknown SU, the CCN forwards the
request to the ICS with the information supplied by the CCU.
Finally, the ICS attempts to validate the CCU based on this
information.
If user identity assertion is successful, as shown in the
Function KYC in Algorithm 1, the ICS reverts to the CCN
with a positive reply. The CCN in response instructs the
ICS to execute the access service contract presented in the
Function KSC in Algorithm 2 per the SU’s request, granting
the SU network access. On the other hand, if the user was
recently authenticated and the network session duration is
below the timeout limit, the CCN may instruct the ICS to
execute the contract right away. A CCN relies on the CCU’s
risk index, CRI, provided by the ICS, to make a determination
about whether to permit a user into its network, and establish
appropriate service usage limits.

After the ICS receives instruction from a CCN to proceed
with a CCU’s access request, the contract is executed by the
ICS on behalf of the two parties. The contract has provisions
to manage various aspects of the transaction, which include
service tier, access price, usage time, etc. as outlined in
functions CHECKKSC and CREDITKSC in Algorithm 2. Once
a contract goes live, it stays a resident program within the ICS
until its fulfillment.

2: sender← UIDCCU
3: receiver← UIDCCN

7: if (useTime < TIME && useTier ≥ TIER) then
8: return true
9: else

14: coinBalanceOf[sender]− = amount
15: coinBalanceOf[receiver]+ = amount
16: coinTransfer(sender, receiver, amount)
17: return true
18: else
19: return false
In Ethereum-based ICS, smart contract clauses for access
provisioning and bill payment may be implemented as follows:

We gauge how BCP’s access provisioning and network sig-
naling fare in comparison to AAA under identical conditions.
A. Access Provisioning Performance
The duration between an access request sent to a CCN
and the request being granted is the authentication time. We
use the average authentication time for a CCU under various
loads as the benchmark to compare the access provisioning
performance of BCP and AAA. Two batches of tests are
carried out: one with negligible latency and the other with
an average regional latency of 36 ms as published in [18]. We
observe from Fig. 3 that BCP outperforms AAA by up to 4x.
The average time per successful authentication, in the absence
and presence of latency, is 0.54 s and 0.72 s for BCP, and
1.52 s and 1.69 s for AAA. The results show that BCP will
outperform AAA, particularly for short-term contracts.
Fig. 3. Access Provisioning – BCP vs. AAA
B. Network Signaling Performance
Signaling is a vital component of network traffic that
impacts a network’s responsiveness. We conduct an elementary
analysis of signaling performance in BCP and AAA by assign-
ing a weight of one for each interaction a network element
in Fig. 2 has with another in order to achieve user access
provisioning. From Fig. 4 one may infer that the AAA trails
behind BCP as the number of users increases.
Fig. 4. Network Signaling – BCP vs. AAA
Unlike conventional cellular networks, the ICS that is built
using BCP reduces signaling traffic by as much as 40%, as
many of the network entities traditionally external to the setup,
such as financial institutions to settle payments, are now within
the ICS ecosystem.

C. Blockchain Partitioning Performance
As the number of blocks in a blockchain continues to grow,
transaction throughput decreases [19]. The blockchain data
store may be semantically partitioned to improve responsive-
ness.
Fig. 5. BCP performance - Partitioned vs. Unpartitioned
We analyze network access provisioning performance by
partitioning the ICS, which uses a simple key-value data store
to group users based on postal codes in a given cell sector. As
shown in Fig. 5., blockchain partitioning leads to faster access
provisioning times as the number of subscribers and devices
increases.
D. Payments Settlement Performance
With regard to usage billing, the current mechanisms to
settle payments is time-consuming for CCNs who grant
opportunistic network access to transitory secondary users.
In the case of ACH, it takes two or three business days for
payment realization [15]. ICS billing transactions use crypto-
currencies as opposed to fiat currencies. Payments settlement
in this design was processed on average in 500 milliseconds in
our setup and may be realized in minutes [19] in the real world,
yielding a conservative 3x reduction in settlement times. More
importantly, the assurance of a smart contract adds a binding
agreement on the CCUs to apportion funds for network usage,
and the CCNs to allot network resources, at the time of access
approval.
V. FINAL REMARKS
We face engineering and ethical quandaries as cellular
penetration and data consumption continue to grow. In or-
der to safeguard personal privacy, a holistic approach to
data security is a must. We propose a privacy enhancing
identity management system using blockchain as a possible
solution. The system strictly demarcates personal and access
data, while still providing mechanisms for unaccredited users
to obtain opportunistic network access in cognitive cellular
networks. On evaluating the performance of our prototype
against conventional methods, we note that the test results hold
potential promise: a 4x improvement in access provisioning
times, 40% decrease in signaling traffic, and 3x reduction in
payments settlement time. In the future, we plan to test the
model’s scalability, and resistance against security attacks.
