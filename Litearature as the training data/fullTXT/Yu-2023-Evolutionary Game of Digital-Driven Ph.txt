Abstract: In the context of “carbon neutral”, distributed energy, including photovoltaic power
generation and energy storage systems, is developing rapidly. Meanwhile, the new generation
of information technology, such as “Cloud computing, Big data, the Internet of things, Mobile
Internet, AI, Blockchain”, is driving the digital transformation of the energy industry. Under digital
drive, how the agents in the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaborate and create value
intelligently is a question worthy of deep consideration. Firstly, the value creation mechanism
and collaborative process of the digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain are analyzed
from a value intelligence creation perspective. Secondly, the tripartite evolutionary game model
of photovoltaic power generator, energy storage provider and user is established. Finally, the
influencing factors of digital- driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaboration are explored
through a numerical simulation, and management suggestions are put forward. The study finds
the following: (1) The behavior choice of each agent in the value chain will affect the decision of
other agents. In particular, the photovoltaic power generator has a great influence on the cooperative
willingness of other agents. To promote value chain collaboration, the guiding role of the photovoltaic
power generator should be fully realized. (2) Agents on the value chain can use a variety of digital
technologies to improve enabling benefits, which is conducive to promoting value chain collaboration.
(3) The driving costs and potential risks are obstacles for value chain collaboration. Cost reduction
and risk prevention are effective ways to improve the willingness of collaboration. (4) Reasonable
incentive compensation mechanisms and information asymmetry punishment measures are the keys
to enhancing collective willingness. This research provides theoretical support for photovoltaic–
storage–use value chain collaboration from a value intelligence creation perspective.

1. Introduction
The aspects of “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality” put forward new require-
ments for upgrading energy structures and low-carbon development in the energy industry.
Photovoltaics, wind power, and other new energy sources are gradually replacing fossil
energy. Among them, photovoltaic power generation has developed rapidly in China, and
its installed capacity and electricity generation have steadily ranked first in the world in
recent years [1]. However, photovoltaic output is volatile, so energy storage systems are
introduced to provide a stable power supply to users. Thus, a value chain of photovoltaic
power generation–energy storage–energy use is formed. At the same time, the new genera-
tion of information technology and advanced technology represented by cloud computing,
big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain [2] have
become important information asset elements for accelerating intelligent and information-
based upgrading of the value chain of the photovoltaic-energy storage industry. They can

promote the collaboration of energy flow, information flow and value flow and realize
value intelligence creation.
According to complex system theory [3], the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain
is a complex network system composed of multi-agents, multi-nodes and multi-links, as
well as a complex adaptive system formed by the interaction and coupling of energy flow,
information flow and value flow [4]. According to the theory of synergy [5], in complex
systems, there are nonlinear relationships in the internal composition in the system and
in each subsystem. The dynamic competition, mutual coordination and cooperative co-
operation among these lead to the spontaneous evolution of the system from disorder to
order on the macro level. Then, the overall effect of the system is enhanced to achieve the
“1 + 1 > 2” synergy effect. Based on the new generation of digital technology, the cooper-
ation, competition and coupling coordination among the value subjects in photovoltaic
power generation, energy storage and energy use will cause the value of the whole chain
to change. Research on the collaboration mechanism driven by the digital aspects of the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain can promote the overall effect of the value chain,
which provides a reference basis for realizing value intelligence creation.
The system’s coordination process is dynamic and complex, and the cooperation
among the agents is based on the condition of information asymmetry. Each agent of the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain cannot determine its coordination strategy immedi-
ately, but seeks a better strategy through learning, comparison and imitation in the dynamic
game process. The related characteristics, constraints and incentives will also affect the
equilibrium state of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaboration. Based on the
above analysis, evolutionary game theory [6,7] is introduced to explore the cooperative
decision-making and evolution mechanism among the bounded rational agents in the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain.
This paper makes the following three contributions: (1) It provides innovation in re-
search perspectives. This paper studies how to realize the value intelligence creation of the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain under the background of digital drive. (2) This paper
establishes an evolutionary game model of digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value
chain collaboration. The co-evolution and stable state of the value chain are considered
under the condition of bounded rationality. Unlike previous studies, this model considers
a situation where the photovoltaic power generator, energy storage provider and user
make collaborative decisions. (3) Considering the driving role of digital technology, the
correlation coefficients of enabling benefit, driving cost and potential risk are introduced
into the model. The influencing factors such as incentive compensation and information
asymmetry penalty are also considered. This paper uses numerical simulation to dynami-
cally analyze the evolution process of the decision of value chain collaboration. It provides
a more specific research framework for value intelligence creation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant research.
Section 3 analyzes the value intelligence creation mechanism and collaborative process.
Section 4 establishes an evolutionary game model of photovoltaic power generator, energy
storage provider and energy user three-party cooperation, and discusses the evolution
path and stability of the game system. Section 5 carries out numerical simulation and puts
forward relevant management suggestions. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Literature Review
This paper mainly focuses on the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain under digital
drive. This section reviews and summarizes the literature on photovoltaic–storage–use
value chain collaboration, new information technology, and the application of evolutionary
game modeling in the field of electric energy production and consumption.

2.1. Study of Photovoltaic–Storage–Use Value Chain Collaboration
The emergence and development of energy storage technology has brought new oppor-
tunities for photovoltaic consumption. Many scholars have carried out extensive research
on combinations of photovoltaic generation and energy storage. They focused on solving
the safe and efficient consumption of photovoltaic power generation side, and improving
the economy, safety and stability of the energy use side. In addition, as an independent
new energy storage subject, energy storage is gradually expanding as part of electricity
market operation. It plays an important role in supporting energy optimization schedul-
ing [8], electric vehicle development [9] and intelligent community operation [10]. The
rapid development of photovoltaic–storage technology promotes the formation of relevant
value chains and industrial clusters. Multiple stakeholders have vertical and horizontal
competition and cooperation under multiple links of production and operation. There are
many studies on the clean energy value chain involving photovoltaic and energy storage,
and they focus on industrial development [11], value addition [12], node coupling [13],
collaborative optimization [14], benefit allocation [15], risk assessment [16], etc.
Collaboration and mutual influence exist in multiple agents of the photovoltaic–
storage–use value chain, which can effectively integrate resources, realize information
sharing, improve the overall efficiency of the value chain [17] and promote clean energy
transformation. The main factors affecting the competitiveness and collaboration are con-
centrated among the main players in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the value
chain [18]. Liu et al. established the Clean Energy Value Co-creation System in China and
studied how the components of the clean energy value chain achieve value co-creation
through the collaborative mechanism [19]. Denes-Santos and Kindl Cunha put forward
that incentives are needed to encourage the Brazilian domestic solar panel industry across
the whole value chain and to encourage technological innovation and the formation of
cooperation [20]. Li et al. studied the mechanisms of technology, policy, markets and other
aspects to drive the collaborative development of the energy storage industry in China
based on synergetic industrial theory [21]. Bekti et al. studied the factors that influence the
willingness of Indonesian customers to use PV, and the results showed that the behavior
of users to participate in PV value chain collaboration is most significantly influenced by
price value [22].
2.2. Background of New Information Technology
The new generation of information technology promotes the development of the
digital economy and can inject new vitality into the photovoltaic-energy storage industry.
On the one hand, the application of new information technology has accelerated energy’s
digital transformation. Different information technologies have different applications in
the energy field. Cloud computing [23] and Internet of Things technology [24] are used
to build systems to enhance the prediction ability and power control ability of the power
generation side, energy storage side and energy use side [25]. Big data technology is mainly
used to collect and process relevant information. The application of artificial intelligence
technology is mainly through the combination of intelligent algorithms and models, which
can be used to solve PV power prediction [26], load prediction, capacity allocation, optimal
scheduling [27] and other problems in the value chain. For example, machine learning
algorithms play an important role in the prediction performance and fault detection of PV
systems [28]. To cope with conditions such as variation of wind speed and variable solar
radiation, based on machine learning, a dynamic general type-2 fuzzy energy management
system for online frequency regulation is suggested [29]. With regard to block chain
technology, its characteristics are decentralized, safe and reliable, can be used to improve
transaction efficiency, solve trust problems [30], and enhance the participation willingness
of each agent.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 4 of 30
On the other hand, digital information technologies can enable collaboration and
innovation in the value chain. Digital technologies can facilitate information sharing along
supply chains, making their collaborative processes smarter, more value-driven and more
efficient [31]. Big data technology and data-driven analytics can effectively identify and
analyze value chains [32] to promote the value increment of the industry. Blockchain
technology is designed to provide other value propositions beyond decentralized storage,
such as innovative crypto economy and investment models and radically new forms of
decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of a new
generation of digital platforms in the supply chain and multiple stakeholder interactions
along the value chain [33]. Huang et al. proposed a new sort of smart supply chain man-
agement model based on the “Internet of Things + Blockchain” [34], which can realize
information and data sharing, conducive to value chain appreciation and industrial up-
grading. Saretta et al. developed a more open and collaborative digital-based approach to
achieve photovoltaic value chain collaboration and benefit improvement [35].
It is observed that digital technology can empower domestic green development [36].
The wider application of new information technology to the photovoltaic–storage–use
value chain could therefore create a path towards value intelligence creation.
2.3. Application of Evolutionary Game Method in the Field of Electric Energy Production
and Consumption
The evolutionary game method is suitable for solving finite conflict problems and
describing the behavior of stakeholders. It can effectively describe the dynamic influence
process of the change of relevant parameters on the trading strategy of stakeholders [7]. It
is widely used in energy transformation [37], new energy utilization, the electricity market,
the distributed energy system, microgrids, smart grids and energy storage [38].
In terms of clean energy development, considering the conflicts of interest among
the Chinese government, the energy industry and third-party clean energy regulatory
auditors, the three-party evolutionary game model is used to discuss the evolutionary
form of strategy choice of each stakeholder group, as reported by Wang et al. The research
finds that the government’s regulatory effort to adapt to the development status of China’s
energy industry is the decisive factor for the effectiveness of government policy imple-
mentation [39]. Combining evolutionary game and system dynamics methods, Zhu et al.
studied how policy interventions under different quota targets affect the behavioral strate-
gies of electricity-selling companies and clean energy power generation companies [40].
Fang et al. simulated the connections between electricity producers under both the per-
fectly competitive market and monopoly market using a networked evolutionary game,
proposed a dynamic renewable energy portfolio standard policy and analyzed its impact
on the diffusion of renewable energy in China [41]. Liu et al. used evolutionary game
theory to explore the behavioral strategies of private sectors from the perspectives of green
energy generators and sellers, considering multiple influencing factors during green energy
production in a PPP project [42].
In terms of behavior selection and collaboration strategy among relevant stakehold-
ers in the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain, a three-party evolution game model is
established by Chen et al., in which incentive policies of distributed photovoltaic systems
and the actual industry situation are used for numerical simulation. The influence of
initial willingness, financial subsidy, penalty tax, operating efficiency, additional cost and
investment cost on participant behavior was analyzed [43]. Based on a variety of initial
conditions of different regions, Zhang et al. explored the evolutionary process of electricity
market players considering energy storage technology, and adopted a three-party evolu-
tionary game model to analyze the strategies of the power plant, the power grid and the
government [44]. Sun et al. established a dynamic evolutionary model of different types
of users choosing retailers based on the logit revision protocol, considering characteristics
of different types of users and interruptible loads as well as users’ distributed renewable
energy [45].
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 5 of 30
To sum up, it is found that in terms of research objects, most focus on a single node,
especially the collaborative mechanism of photovoltaic industrial chain development [46].
There are few studies on the energy storage node and energy use node as the main agent
participating in the value chain collaboration. In terms of research background, there is
a lack of relevant research on the collaboration of the photovoltaic storage value chain
driven by digital technology. In the aspect of research methods, the essence of the collab-
orative problem is to play a game and find equilibrium among the subjects. The actual
photovoltaic storage market is in an asymmetric information environment. There is an
incomplete information game among photovoltaic nodes, energy storage nodes and energy
consumption nodes [47]. Therefore, this paper uses an evolutionary game method to study
the collaboration of the digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain to promote
value intelligence creation.
3. Value Intelligence Creation Mechanism and Collaborative Process of Digital-Driven
Photovoltaic–Storage–Use Value Chain
Based on the theory of information resources [48] and the connotation of digital
empowerment [49], it can be seen that, driven by digital technologies such as “cloud com-
puting, big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain”,
information flow can produce an energization effect based on the energy flow and value
flow.
This can effectively promote photovoltaic consumption and innovation in energy
storage and benefit the emergence of energy use among the subjects of the “power genera-
tor–storage–use” value chain. Digital technologies can help to achieve transformation and
upgrading of “informatization, digitization and intelligence” of the value chain. The agents
of the value chain become the energy information resources agents, which are relevant and
influenced by each other, to realize value intelligence creation.
3.1. Value Intelligence Creation Mechanism
The value intelligence creation mechanism is studied from the aspects of the upstream
photovoltaic power generation node, midstream energy storage node, downstream energy
consumption node and collaboration of these three nodes. See Figure 1.
(1) At present, contradictions such as uneven consumption of photovoltaic power
generation, incoordination between generation and power grid, and imperfect market
mechanism still exist. The new generation of digital information technology, such as
“cloud computing, big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and
blockchain”, are applied to data transmission, output prediction, system detection, power
supply control and other aspects of photovoltaic power generation, which can realize
the collaboratively rapid response of consumption and generation of photovoltaic power.
Digital technology works on the power generation side, which increases the value of
the power generation side of the value chain and forms value-added utility. The value
contained in this utility generates new value when the value flows to the energy storage
node, and then continuously acts on the middle and lower nodes of the value chain.
Therefore, value intelligence creation can be realized in this process.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 6 of 30
Figure 1. Value intelligence creation mechanism of photovoltaic–storage–use value chain.
(2) The energy storage link is the intermediate node of the value chain. The photo-
voltaic abandonment generated by the upstream power generation link can be stored by
the energy storage system and then supplied to users or power systems. The application of
big data, blockchain, cloud computing and other technologies can achieve innovation in
the energy storage management system and the optimization of capacity allocation, system
scheduling, transaction mode, etc. This can promote energy storage applications that are
safer, more efficient, more intelligent and more economic. Improvement of digital-driven
energy storage innovation efficiency is manifested, as this digital information technology
improves energy storage technology, reduces cost and increases efficiency. Application of
information technology in energy storage realizes the value transmission from the power
generation link to energy storage link, as well as the value extension from the energy stor-
age link to energy use link. Through the collaboration of upstream and downstream nodes
and the optimization of the layout of energy storage systems by digital-driven methods,
the capacity of peak regulating in the energy system is improved, and the photovoltaic
consumption is promoted.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 7 of 30
(3) Under the demand of clean energy systems dominated by the demand side, energy
trading is gradually liberalized. More energy users actively participate in the energy
consumption link of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain. By the application of digital
information technology, energy users realize multi-dimensional benefits of energy using,
such as economic benefits, social benefits and environmental benefits. Users can make
more accurate load prediction and demand response and carry out more intelligent modes
of power consumption and energy service. As the downstream node of the value chain, the
energy-using side completes the terminal value added of the value intelligence creation
process supported, by the new generation of information technology.
(4) With the application of new digital information technology, such as “cloud comput-
ing, big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain”, the
self-organizing characteristics of the value chain system and the adaptive characteristics of
the main bodies promote the ecological niche change of the value chain system, so that the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain system evolves in the direction of intelligence and
high efficiency. The application of new generation information technology stimulates the
cooperative organization, cooperative operation and cooperative decision-making among
all subjects in the node of “power generation –energy storage–energy use” and realizes the
virtuous cycle of value intelligence creation. Digital technology can promote the control
precision of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain system and the timeliness of infor-
mation sharing, realize the linkage of “upper and lower” and the interaction of “internal
and external”, and maximize the energy consumption capacity, energy storage innovation
efficiency and energy using benefit so that the value intelligence creation and the goals of
“carbon neutral” are realized.
3.2. Collaborative Process
The collaborative process and mechanism of the value chain are embodied in the
following stages: the first stage—resource input (information generation); the second
stage—information sharing (energy efficiency improvement); the third stage—coupling
collaboration (value intelligence creation). See Figure 2.
(1) Resource input (Information generation). In the first stage, each agent actively
builds a new generation of digital information technology chain and invests information
resource elements, including information subjects, information technology and so on.
New technologies such as big data, cloud computing, 5G networks and advanced sensing
technologies support the abstraction of physical energy networks to logical networks in
virtual networks, namely “Digital Twins”. As the initial stage of the collaborative process,
each agent realizes the energy flow transmission and information network sharing based
on the “Digital Twin”. The photovoltaic storage physical system is optimized by feedback
through carrying out simulation, calculation, analysis and decisions of intelligent entities.
Each agent has become a value intelligence creation agent of photovoltaic storage, with the
functions of environment stereoscopic perception, knowledge deep learning, interactive
evolution of behavior and so on. The collaborative intelligence creation effect of the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain thus initially emerges.
(2) Information sharing (energy efficiency improvement). In the second stage, each
node in the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaborates, and multi-agents, multi-
links and multi-levels are interconnected openly. Digital technologies are fully leveraged
to drive data integration and information sharing. This realizes the two-way flow and
interaction of energy flow and information flow in the whole life-cycle process of “photo-
voltaic power generation–energy storage–energy consumption” and each link of the value
chain extension. The photovoltaic power generation side not only collects and transmits
basic power generation data but also analyzes, integrates, identifies and extracts different
types of data and information resources from other agents, such as electricity, heat, nat-
ural gas, transportation, energy storage and load. Energy storage flexible addition, agile
response and innovation can coordinate some behavior activities of each agent on the value
chain. This greatly improves the consumption capacity of photovoltaics, reduces carbon
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 8 of 30
emissions, and realizes the emergence of multiple benefits on the energy-using side. The
collaborative intelligence creation effect of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain is
further accumulated and value-added.
Figure 2. Process of digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaboration.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 9 of 30
(3) Coupling collaboration (value intelligence creation). In this stage, the use of
“cloud computing, big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and
blockchain” realizes resources coupling among material, information and technology.
Under the influence of the internal system elements (individual characteristics, behavior
patterns, organizational structure, development strategy, the types of decision making,
etc.) and the external environmental conditions (technical progress, policy system, market
competition and resource constraints, etc.), multiple intelligent agents on value chain
will gradually adapt to the surrounding environment. They will optimize their own
strategies according to their observed environment and the behaviors of other agents.
Relying on the powerful learning function of digital technology, they adapt to the other
main body behaviors. Combined with behavior advantages of adaptation, self-learning
and self-organizing of all the agents, the optimal allocation and utilization of resources is
achieved through coordinated decisions. In the third stage, each node of the photovoltaic–
storage–use value chain uses information technology and means to constantly create new
collaborative information resources and promote information sharing. With the internal
and external coupling coordination, self-organization and self-adaptation, the intelligence
creation effect of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain keeps increasing. The system
evolves into a stable, orderly and dynamic equilibrium state to maximize the intelligence
creation effect of value.
4. The Evolutionary Game Model
4.1. Hypothesis
At present, there are development forms such as cooperation and alliance formation
among the agents of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain. Many agents on the interior
of the value chain have contributed to digital construction foundation and collaboration
mechanisms. There are basic conditions for digital technology to drive the intelligence
creation. Compared with the traditional value chain collaborative mechanism, the main
driving force of value intelligence creation is digital technology and information resources.
Corresponding to the upper, middle and lower reaches of the value chain, it is assumed that
there are photovoltaic power generators, energy storage providers and users to participate
in the collaboration. All three parties are characterized by “bounded rationality”, which is
the basis of evolutionary game analysis.
(1) Hypothesis of collaborative game strategy. Assume that the strategy is [digital-
driven, non-digital-driven], and the proportion of the three parties choosing a “digital-
driven” strategy for value chain collaboration is x, y, and z, respectively. Under the current
asymmetric information condition, the choice of a “digital-driven” strategy represents
the subject as actively using digital technology, driving data integration and information
sharing on the value chain, improving the efficiency of information collaboration, fulfill-
ing the contract with integrity, promoting the value chain collaboration, and realizing
value intelligence creation. On the contrary, where the subject is unwilling to use digital
technology to drive the value chain collaboration, and negatively participates, this is a
“non-digital-driven” strategy. When the three parties do not use digital driving technology
to make value chain collaborative decisions, the digital empowerment effect will not occur;
this is the traditional value chain game mode. The initial income of the three parties is
Ei(i = 1, 2, 3).
(2) Hypothesis of collaborative empowerment benefit. With the help of the coupling
and collaboration of the new generation of information technology, the agents produce the
agglomerative digital-driven effect, which can improve the consumption capacity of photo-
voltaic power generation, energy storage innovation efficiency and user emergence benefit.
Here, Qi(i = 1, 2, 3) represents the enabling benefit obtained by the three parties collab-
oratively making decisions. This paper assumes that di(i = 1, 2, 3) is used to reflect the
input of information resource elements (information subject, information and information
technology) from each subject. When the subject chooses the “non-digital-driven” strategy,
di = 0. Different agents have different data mining abilities, information processing levels,
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 10 of 30
integration means and application degrees of digital driving technology. So, the intelligence
creation effect obtained by digital-driven methods is different. ri(i = 1, 2, 3) represents the
enabling benefit coefficient of each subject under digital driving. Each subject drives data
integration, resource sharing, information circulation and dynamic coordination through
digital technology. Therefore, the enabling benefit obtained by subject i is not only related
to the information resource elements invested by itself but also related to the input of
other subjects. Taking photovoltaic power generators as an example, photovoltaic power
generation needs to carry out prediction, operation, maintenance and scheduling based on
historical and real-time power big data, and use big data, cloud computing and other new
technologies to promote photovoltaic consumption. Generally speaking, the application
level and informatization level of digital technology of photovoltaic power generators will
be relatively high. Their digitally driven enabling benefits and income coefficients will also
be relatively high, which can be represented by Q1 = r1(d1 + d2 + d3).
(3) Hypothesis of collaborative drive cost. In the process of using new-generation
information technology to drive value chain collaboration and enhance the intellectual
creation effect, each subject needs to build digital systems, technology operation and
maintenance, research investment, data conversion, information communication, etc. These
increase the cost of information technology use, infrastructure and other hardware, system
platforms and other software construction. The above costs are summarized as the driving
costs of the collaborative decision making of all subjects. ci(i = 1, 2, 3) represents the
driving cost coefficient of all subjects, and cidi represents the driving cost of the value chain
collaboration driven by all subjects using digital technology.
(4) Hypothesis of potential risk. Information asymmetry, fluctuation of trust level,
opportunistic behaviorism, changes in external market and policy environment may lead
to the loss of core data or knowledge advantages of the subject. There may also be potential
risks, including technology, personnel, core information, negotiation red lines and so
on. mi(i = 1, 2, 3) is used to represent the potential risk coefficient of each subject’s
collaboration, and midi is used to represent the potential risk of each subject’s collaboration.
(5) Hypothesis of collaborative incentive mechanism. There will be corresponding
incentive measures for the subjects who actively choose digital technology to drive value
intelligence creation. In the context of continuous policy support and encouragement
of clean energy power generation and the great development of the Internet, especially
in the context of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals” and the digital economy,
collaborative decision making based on digital technology among photovoltaic power
generators, energy storage providers and users is an effective way to respond to national
policies and drive the development of energy Internet. Suppose pi(i = 1, 2, 3) is the
incentive compensation coefficient. It shows the policy incentive benefits provided by the
government and the value chain alliance when each subject adapts to new policy changes
and makes collaborative decisions based on digital driving technology to carry out value
intelligence creation, such as material rewards and reputation rewards.
(6) Hypothesis of collaborative punishment mechanism. The degree of integration
of information resources will affect the effectiveness of decision making in the process of
value chain collaboration. The punishment mechanism of information asymmetry is set
up here in order to promote the degree of information symmetry among the three parties
in the game. The penalty coefficient is denoted by si(i= 1, 2, 3) . When the subject does
not use the digital-driven technology but makes use of the information factor resources of
other collaborative interests, it will be punished. For example, if the collaboration between
subjects is further reduced, and the reputation of subjects is reduced, some funds will
be affected. The greater the input information elements of other subjects, the greater the
benefit of “free riding” obtained by the negative subject, so the corresponding punishment
should be greater.

4.2. Tripartite Evolutionary Game Model
Based on the above game assumptions, the expected revenues of PV choosing “digital-
driven” and “non-digital-driven” strategies in the game are calculated, which can be
represented by U1 and U′1, respectively. The average revenue is U1, as follows.
U1 = yz[E1 + r1(d1 + d2 + d3)− c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1] + y(1− z)[E1 + r1(d1 + d2)− c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1]
+(1− y)z[E1 + r1(d1 + d3)− c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1] + (1− y)(1− z)[E1 + r1d1 − c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1]
(1)
U′1 = yz[E1 + r1(d2 + d3)− s1(d2 + d3)] + y(1− z)(E1 + r1d2 − s1d2) + (1− y)z(E1 + r1d3 − s1d3) + (1− y)(1− z)E1 (2)
U1 = xU1 + (1− x)U′

(3)
Similarly, it can be obtained that the expected revenues of the ES choosing “digital-
driven” and “non-digital-driven” strategies in the game are U2 and U′2 respectively. The
average revenue is U2, as follows.
U2 = xz[E2 + r2(d1 + d2 + d3)− c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2] + x(1− z)[E2 + r2(d1 + d2)− c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2]
+(1− x)z[E2 + r2(d2 + d3)− c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2] + (1− x)(1− z)[E2 + r2d2 − c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2]
(4)
U′2 = xz[E2 + r2(d1 + d3)− s2(d1 + d3)] + x(1− z)(E2 + r2d1 − s2d1) + (1− x)z(E2 + r2d3 − s2d3) + (1− x)(1− z)E2 (5)
U2 = yU2 + (1− y)U′2 (6)
In the game, US chooses the “digital-driven” and “non-digital-driven” strategies, the
expected revenues are U3 and U′3, respectively, and the average payoff is U3, as follows:
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 12 of 30
U3 = xy[E3 + r3(d1 + d2 + d3)− c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3] + x(1− y)[E3 + r3(d1 + d3)− c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3]
+(1− x)y[E3 + r3(d2 + d3)− c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3] + (1− x)(1− y)[E3 + r3d3 − c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3]
(7)
U′3 = xy[E3 + r3(d1 + d2)− s3(d1 + d2)] + x(1− y)(E3 + r3d1 − s3d1) + (1− x)y(E3 + r3d2 − s2d2) + (1− x)(1− y)E3 (8)
U3 = zU2 + (1− z)U′3 (9)
The dynamic change rate of a game’s strategy is the core of bounded rational game
analysis. The dynamic change rate of a game model can be reflected by differential equa-
tions. According to the replication dynamic formula, the replication dynamic equations of
photovoltaic–storage–use can be obtained as follows:
F(x) = dx/dt = x(U1 −U′1) = x(1− x)(U1 −U′1) = x(1− x)(ys1d2 + zs1d3 + r1d1 − c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1) (10)
F(y) = dy/dt = y(U2 −U2′) = y(1− y)(U2 −U2
′) = y(1− y)(xs2d1 + zs2d3 + r2d2 − c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2) (11)
F(z) = dz/dt = z(U3 −U3′) = z(1− z)(U3 −U2
′) = z(1− z)(xs3d1 + ys3d2 + r3d3 − c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3) (12)
4.2.1. Photovoltaic Power Generator Evolutionary Path
According to the stability theorem of the replicated dynamic differential equation and
the properties of the evolutionary stability strategy, the derivative of F(x) is
d(F(x))/dx = (1− 2x)(ys1d2 + zs1d3 + r1d1 − c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d) (13)
If z = (c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3, at this time F(x) = 0; no matter what
value x takes, the strategy selection of PV is in a stable state and will not change with time,
as shown in Figure 3a.
Figure 3. Evolutionary process of PV. (a) When z = (c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3;
(b) When z > (c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3; (c) When z <
(c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3.
If z > (c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3, and we let F(x) = 0, we get two
evolution stable points, which are x = 0 and x = 1. When x = 0, d(F(x))/dx > 0, and when
x = 1, d(F(x))/dx < 0, so x = 1 is the evolution stable point, as shown in Figure 3b.
If z < (c1d1 + m1d1 − r1d1 − p1d− ys1d2)/s1d3, let F(x) = 0, at this time, when x = 0,
d(F(x))/dx < 0, and when x = 1, d(F(x))/dx > 0, so x = 0 is the evolution stable point, as
shown in Figure 3c.

4.2.2. Energy Storage Provider Evolutionary Path
Similarly, taking the derivative of F(y) yields
d(F(y))/dy = (1− 2y)(xs2d1 + zs2d3 + r2d2 − c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2) (14)
If z = (c2d2 + m2d2 − r2d2 − p2d2 − xs2d1)/s2d3, at this time, F(y) = 0; no matter
what value y takes, the strategy selection of ES is in a stable state and will not change with
time, as shown in Figure 4a.

If z > (c2d2 + m2d2 − r2d2 − p2d2 − xs2d1)/s2d3, let F(y) = 0; there are two evolution
stable points, which are y =0 and y =1. When y = 0, d(F(y))/dy > 0 and when y = 1,
d(F(y))/dy < 0, so y = 1 is the evolution stable point, as shown in Figure 4b.
If z < (c2d2 + m2d2 − r2d2 − p2d2 − xs2d1)/s2d3, let F(y) = 0; at this time, when y =
0, d(F(y))/dy > 0 and when y = 1, d(F(y))/dy > 0, so y = 0 is the evolution stable point,
as shown in Figure 4c.
4.2.3. User Evolutionary Path
Similarly, taking the derivative of F(z) yields
d(F(z))/dz = (1− 2z)(xs3d1 + ys3d2 + r3d3 − c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3) (15)
If y = (c3d3 + m3d3 − r3d3 − p3d3 − xs3d1)/s3d2, at this time F(z) = 0; no matter
what value z takes, the strategy selection of US is in a stable state and will not change with
time, as shown in Figure 5a.

Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 14 of 30
If y > (c3d3 + m3d3 − r3d3 − p3d3 − xs3d1)/s3d2, let F(z) = 0, there are two evolution
stable points, which are z = 0 and z = 1. When z = 0, d(F(z))/dz > 0 and when z = 1,
d(F(z))/dz < 0, so z = 1 is the evolution stable point, as shown in Figure 5b.
If y < (c3d3 + m3d3 − r3d3 − p3d3 − xs3d1)/s3d2, let F(z) = 0; at this time, when z =
0, d(F(z))/dz < 0 and when z = 1, d(F(z))/dz > 0, so z = 0 is the evolution stable point, as
shown in Figure 5c.
4.3. Stability Analysis of Evolutionary Game System

In the asymmetric game, if the condition of information asymmetry holds, the evo-
lutionarily stable strategy is pure strategy. Therefore, this paper only needs to discuss
the asymptotic stability of the eight local equilibrium points, E1(1, 1, 1), E2(0, 1, 1), E3(1, 0, 1),
E4(0, 0, 1), E5(1, 1, 0), E6(0, 1, 0), E7(1, 0, 0), and E8(0, 0, 0), in the above formula [50]. The evo-
lutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of game is judged by judging the eigenvalues (λ) of the
Jacobian matrix. When all eigenvalues λ are greater than 0, the equilibrium point is un-
stable, and is the source point. The positive and negative signs of the eigenvalues λ are
different, and the equilibrium point is a saddle point. All the eigenvalues λ are less than 0,
the equilibrium point is stable and is the sink point. The eigenvalues of the above eight
local equilibrium points are shown in Table 3 below.

Taking the local equilibrium point E1(1, 1, 1) as an example, the stable equilibrium
point of the evolving system is discussed. This paper studies the situation in which the
three parties in the game adopt digital technology to drive information sharing, data
integration and collaborative decision making of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain
and promote value intelligence creation. Therefore, equilibrium point E1(1, 1, 1) is the ideal
equilibrium situation. When all three eigenvalues are less than 0, E1(1, 1, 1) becomes a stable
point. The following conditions are met:
−(s1d2 + s1d3 + r1d1 − c1d1 −m1d1 + p1d1) < 0
−(s2d1 + s2d3 + r2d2 − c2d2 −m2d2 + p2d2) < 0
−(s3d1 + s3d2 + r3d3 − c3d3 −m3d3 + p3d3 < 0

Taking condition 4© as an example, when E8(0, 0, 0) becomes the stable point (ESS),
the stability of the other three uncertain local equilibrium points E4(0, 0, 1), E6(0, 1, 0) and
E7(1, 0, 0) in Table 4 are discussed, as shown in Table 5 below.

It can be seen that if the parameters satisfy the above assumptions, the stable points of
the system evolution may converge to E1(1, 1, 1), E8(0, 0, 0) and E6(0, 1, 0) (when condition 2©
is satisfied).
Combined with the characteristic value of the Jacobi matrix in Table 3, the local
equilibrium point E1(1, 1, 1) is taken as an example to analyze and discuss. The results
(Tables 4 and 5) show that the conditions of stable points of the tripartite collaborative
evolutionary game are conflicting. There are few stable points at the same time, and there
are only a few stable equilibrium solutions in the game of tripartite collaborative evolution
of the photovoltaic–storage–use value chain.
5. Simulation Analysis
To clearly and intuitively demonstrate the impact of changes in the parameters on
the evolutionary path of the system, this paper uses MATLAB to carry out simulations.
During this process, we first interviewed senior executives in the photovoltaic and en-
ergy storage industry and experts from relevant government departments. According
to the actual research situation, we established the conditions that the initial simulation
parameters should meet. In general, as the interest subject of the power generation side,
the photovoltaic power generator is the starting point of the whole value chain, with a
large amount of photovoltaic resource data and advanced digital technology. As the value
transfer terminal of the energy side, the user’s information resource is the basic source of
intelligent electricity analysis. Therefore, compared with the energy storage provider and
user, the photovoltaic power generator has a larger volume of initial input information
resource elements and a greater degree of digital technology utilization proficiency. In the
current environment, the photovoltaic power generator and user have a certain amount of
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 16 of 30
information construction. However, when the energy storage provider participates in value
chain collaboration as a new type of energy storage transaction subject, the requirements of
flexible configuration and agile response of the energy storage system lead to the higher
demands for the energy storage provider on cloud computing, edge computing and other
information technologies, so the driving cost will be relatively high. Therefore, in most
cases, d1 > d3 > d2, r1 > r3 > r2, c2 > c1 and c2 > c3.
Take the real situation of agents in a micro-grid as an example. A PV power generation
company, an energy storage company and a community user group form a value chain
alliance. After negotiation, the three subjects respectively invest information resources
(including shared information, technology, etc.) with the volume of 30, 10, and 20. The
enabling income of the three parties from each unit of information resources is, respectively,
45,000 yuan, 35,000 yuan and 40,000 yuan. The driving cost from each unit of information
resources is, respectively, 100,000 yuan, 200,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan. The risk cost
from each unit of information resources is, respectively, 30,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and
25,000 yuan.
The parameter values of incentive compensation coefficient and asymmetric penalty
coefficient are assigned concerning the actual operation situation of the value chain alliance,
suggestions of system simulation experts and the simulation data of existing research
results [50–52], so that the parameter settings are more relevant to the actual situation.
Based on the above real situation and objective facts, and combined with other scholars’
relevant research [53,54], the parameters are set as follows: let d1 = 30, d2 = 10, d3 = 20,
r1 = 4.5, r2 = 3.5, r3 = 4, c1 = 10, c2 = 20, c3 = 15, m1 = 3, m2 = 2, m3 = 2.5,p1 = 5, p2 = 4.5,
p3 = 6, s1 = 7.5, s2 = 7, and s3 = 8. Matlab R2018a is used to simulate and obtain the results
of the three-party dynamic evolution game, as shown in Figure 6 below. At this time, the
stable points of system evolution are (0,0,0) and (1,1,1).
Figure 6. Results of the three-party dynamic evolution game.

5.1. Influence of Initial Willingness of Game Parties
To simulate the change of the initial probability (that is, the initial willingness of
tripartite collaboration to choose the digital-driven strategy) of tripartite collaboration of
PV, ES and US, assume x = y = z. As shown in Figure 7, the threshold of initial intention x,
y and z are all 0.4~0.5. When the initial intentions x, y and z are all less than the threshold, x,
y and z will converge to 0, where the convergence speed of z is faster, and the smaller x, y
and z are, the faster the system will evolve to the stable point (0,0,0). On the contrary, when
the initial intentions x, y and z are all larger than the threshold, they will evolve to converge
to 1. Among them, y converges faster, and the larger x, y and z are, the faster the system
evolves to the stable point (1,1,1). This shows that (1) the greater the initial willingness,
the greater the probability that PV, ES and US all choose the digital-driven strategy, and
the faster the stabilization speed. (2) The strategy stabilizes faster when ES chooses the
digital-driven method. While the strategy of US is affected by the behavior of others; when
US defers, the collaboration converges faster.
Figure 7. Evolution results of different initial intentions.
As shown in Figure 8a, when the initial y = z = 0.3, the threshold value of the initial
willingness x of the PV is between 0.5 and 0.6 (medium range). As shown in Figure 8b,
when the initial x = z = 0.3, no matter how big the ES’s initial willingness y is, x and z will
converge to 0. The more minor y is, the faster the convergence speed of evolution will be.
As shown in Figure 8c, when x = y = 0.3 at the beginning, the threshold of z is between 0.7
and 0.8 (higher interval). When z = 0.7, the values of x and y will initially rise due to the high
initial value of z, but with the evolution of time, x and y gradually decrease, and the system
gradually converges to (0,0,0). The results show that when the collaboration willingness of
the other two subjects is low, the initial willingness of PV has the most significant impact
on the value chain collaboration, followed by US and ES.

5.2. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
5.2.1. Enabling Benefit Coefficient
Assume that the initial x, y and z are all 0.5, and take different values for r1, r2, r3. The
evolution results are shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 9a, the threshold of r1 is
between 3.8 and 3.9. When r1 is lower than the threshold, the stable strategy of three-party
collaboration evolution tends to (0,0,0), and the more minor r1 is, the faster the three parties
converge to 0. When r1 is higher than the threshold, the stable strategy tends to (1,1,1),
and the larger r1 is, the faster the three parties converge to (1,1,1). As can be seen from
Figure 9b, when r2 > 0, the stability points are (1,1,1), and the larger r2 is, the faster the
convergence speed. Similarly, Figure 9c shows that the threshold value of r3 is between 2.4
and 2.5. Figure 9 shows that y converges to 1 faster in most cases. The results show that
(1) the larger the enabling efficiency coefficient is, the stronger the willingness of PV, ES
and US’s selection of the digital-driven strategy for value chain collaboration is, and the
faster the speed of convergence to the stable state. This is due to the increasingly advanced
information technology in the context of the digital economy, which has greater power
to drive the digital transformation of energy and digital utility of the value chain, and
greater encouragement for stakeholders to carry out collaborative decision making. (2) PV
and US are sensitive to the enabling benefit coefficient, because they have more input
in information resource elements. (3) Even when the ES is under the condition of small
enabling benefit coefficient, it will evolve to choose the digital-driven strategy. Because ES
can profit from the large amount of information resources invested by the PV and US, it
has a stronger willingness to collaborate.
5.2.2. Driving Cost Coefficient
Figure 10 shows the simulation results when different values of c1, c2, c3 are taken. The
threshold value of c1 is between 10 and 11. The c2 threshold ranges from 34 to 35. When c2
is lower than the threshold but not very low, y rapidly drops to 0, and x and z rise slowly.
After a long period of evolution, y gradually increases with the increase of x and z, and
finally y converges to 1, and the game system stabilizes to the equilibrium point (1,1,1).
Similarly, the threshold value of c3 is between 16 and 17. The results show that (1) there is a
critical value of the driving cost coefficient. When the driving cost is too high, the three
parties in the game will give up the digital technology to drive the value chain collaboration;
(2) compared with PV and US, ES is less sensitive to the driving cost coefficient, because ES
has less input in information resources and less overall driving costs. In the long run, even
if the driving cost of ES is high, the ES will still benefit from the other two players’ choice of
digital-driven strategy collaboration and eventually evolve to the strategy of using digital
technology to carry out value chain collaboration.
5.2.3. Potential Risk Coefficient
Figure 11 shows that the threshold value of m1 is between 3.6 and 3.7. The threshold
of m2 ranges from 16 to 17. When m2 is lower than the threshold but not very low, the ES’s
willingness y to collaborate is not very strong at the beginning. After a period of evolution,
as x and z become stronger, ES will choose to collaborate with the other two subjects, and
finally y converges to 1. Similarly, the threshold of m3 is between 4 and 4.1. The results
show that (1) if the potential risk coefficient is too large, it will take a long time to reach
the stable point of tripartite collaboration or directly lead to the three parties not choosing
the collaboration strategy; (2) PV and US are more sensitive to the potential risk coefficient.
This is due to the high initial resource investment of these two parties, which may face
risks such as data leakage. They also have high dependence on information resources. In
particular, PV has high requirements for the accuracy of data elements and needs to prevent
potential risks in advance.

5.2.4. Incentive Compensation Coefficient
As shown in Figure 12, the threshold of p1 is between 4.3 and 4.4. No matter how p2
changes, the stable point is (1,1,1), but the larger p2 is, the faster the convergence speed.
When p2 is 0, y decreases first, then slowly rises with the evolution of the system, and finally
converges to 1. The threshold of p2 ranges from 4.4 to 4.5. The results show that (1) the
incentive compensation coefficient’s size will affect the three-party evolutionary game’s
result and stability speed. The larger the incentive degree is, the faster the three parties tend
to collaborate in the value chain. To adapt to the current environment of “digital economy”
and “carbon neutral”, the choice of collaborative strategy will obtain more policy incentives,
and the willingness of three-party collaboration will gradually increase to improve the
value intelligence creation effect. (2) Compared with PV and US, the strategy selection of
ES is less affected by the incentive compensation coefficient. However, if the coefficient is
too small, the ES will not have strong willingness to collaborate in the early stage of the
game, which will eventually slow down the stability speed of the system.
5.2.5. Asymmetric Penalty Coefficient
As can be seen from Figure 13, the threshold value of s1 is between 6.1 and 6.2. The
threshold of s2 ranges from 2.8 to 2.9. When s2 is less than the threshold, y converges to
0. The stable equilibrium point of the three-way game system is (1,0,1). When s2 = 2.9, s2
is larger than the threshold but not very large, and y rapidly evolves toward 0. However,
with a longer period of game and evolution, y will gradually increase due to x = y = 1,
and slowly converge to 1. The threshold of s3 ranges from 6.5 to 6.6. The results show
the following: (1) The penalty mechanism of information asymmetry will affect the value
chain collaboration, and the asymmetric penalty coefficient has a critical value. The greater
the asymmetric penalty coefficient is, the greater the final probability of PV, ES and US’s
collaboration will be, and the faster the stabilization speed will be. (2) When each subject
is punished by free-riding behavior, the severity of punishment is related to the input of
information resource factors of the other two subjects. Due to PV and US having relatively
high information integration, and the initial resource investment of ES being relatively
small, the critical values of the asymmetric penalty coefficient of PV and US are high,
and the critical value of the asymmetric penalty coefficient of ES is low. (3) When the
asymmetric penalty coefficient of ES is small, it tends toward a non-numerically driven
strategy in the early stage of the game. However, in the longer term, because PV and US
choose to collaborate in the value chain and gradually improve the intelligence creation
ability of the value chain, ES will be influenced by the other two parties and gradually
evolve to choose the digital-driven strategy for value intelligence creation.
Some results obtained from numerical simulation have been verified in related studies.
For example, [50] found that digital transformation is an essential regulator of collaboration
in the supply chain, and government support provides critical links in the collaboration
formation path. However, the applicability to value intelligence creation of the suggested
sensitivity factors in this paper is higher versus some other influencing factors, such
as digital-transformation degree [50], supervision costs [55] and sharing income coeffi-
cient [51].

5.3. Mangement Suggestions
Based on above analysis and simulation results, according to the main conclusions, the
incentive mechanism and management suggestions of digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–
use value chain collaboration from the perspective of value intelligence creation are put
forward as follows:
(1) The photovoltaic power generator, energy storage provider and user should
strengthen the application of digital technology and promote value intelligence creation.
For example, the photovoltaic power generator can use digital technologies such as “Cloud
computing, Big data, the Internet of things, Mobile Internet, AI, Blockchain” to widely
collect and integrate big data such as meteorological data, energy consumption data and
macroeconomic data. Machine learning, data mining and big data analysis are used to
grasp the energy consumption characteristics of photovoltaic power generation systems
and users, coordinate planning and scheduling multiple power generation subsystems.
The energy storage provider can implement system status and fault monitoring based
on big data technology, considering the use of blockchain, cloud computing, etc., to optimize
shared energy storage and cloud energy storage operation transaction modes, capacity
configuration and optimal scheduling.
On the user side, blockchain technology and Internet of Things technology can be used
to realize intelligent electricity information collection, energy platform applications and
intelligent service of electric vehicles. A variety of artificial intelligence methods are used
for load forecasting and demand response modeling to provide users with clean, efficient,
low-carbon and safe electricity. It can also provide users with personalized services and
solutions for energy use.
(2) It is suggested to strengthen the collaboration intensity among the photovoltaic
power generator, energy storage provider and user. Due to the mutual influence of the
three parties’ willingness to collaborate, the collaboration results of the value chain will
eventually evolve into different states. The stronger the initial willingness of the three
parties to collaborate, the faster the evolution speed. As the photovoltaic power generator
is the node that has the strongest influence on the value chain collaboration, it should be
further promoted to participate in the collaboration of the photovoltaic–storage–use value
chain, so that it can play a guiding role, and then influence the user and energy storage
side to actively lay out the digital construction and transformation.
(3) It is essential to improve the benefits of digital empowerment and better pro-
mote the digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaboration. On the one
hand, digital technology is used to realize horizontal resource complementarity of the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain system to improve energy efficiency.
On the other hand, it should play the coordinating role of digital technology in the
vertical link of “power generation, energy storage and energy use” of the value chain;
realize the interconnection among energy flow, information flow and value flow; fully
improve the use and empowerment of digital technology; and enhance photovoltaic power
consumption, energy storage innovation efficiency and energy use benefit.
(4) There should be a move to reduce the driving costs and potential risks of using
digital technology. In terms of reducing driving costs, the photovoltaic power generator
can consider leading the formation of a value chain alliance, jointly build a digital platform,
formulate a reasonable cost sharing mechanism, use blockchain and other technologies
to achieve data integration and sharing, improve the reusability of information resources
and data elements, reduce the cost of system construction, and ensure the efficient use of
collaborative information resources sharing.
In terms of potential risks, an effective trust mechanism should be established to give
full play to the advantages of information technology and realize the gradual feedback
and accumulation of energy data. In addition, stakeholders need to build information
sharing mechanisms, improve the transparency of information of each subject, realize the
traceability of information, and prevent the system risk caused by information distortion.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 27 of 30
In addition, the government and relevant industry departments should also improve
the relevant regulations to reduce the potential risks driven by digital technology; the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain alliance can consider carrying out pilot applications
for crucial business scenarios, implement the feedback and replication expansion mode,
and form a continuously strengthened risk prevention mechanism.
(5) Reasonable incentive compensation mechanisms and information asymmetry
punishment measures are the keys to enhancing collective willingness. Guided by policy
goals and driven by digital technology, the value creation of the traditional photovoltaic–
storage–use value chain and energy trading market has been disrupted and transformed.
The incentive measures of external forces in the system can give participants greater choices,
activate innovation consciousness and promote collaborative participation. Therefore, it is
necessary to formulate scientific and reasonable incentive means and punishment measures
with guidance, which should take into account economic effects, environmental effects and
social effects.
(6) Due to the different sensitivities of the photovoltaic power generator, user and
energy storage provider to different influencing factors of digitally driven value chain
collaboration, targeted management is needed in practical applications. The photovoltaic
power generator and user are more sensitive to the influencing factors because they invest
more resources and have higher technical requirements. Energy storage providers are
relatively weak in sensitivity, but they are more willing to collaborate. To encourage energy
storage providers to adopt collaborative strategies faster, it is necessary to strengthen
efforts to improve the digital empowerment effect of energy storage providers and reduce
risks and costs. Therefore, energy storage providers can consider a new type of energy
storage subject to speed up digital construction and reduce information costs and risks. In
addition, safety risks caused by some electrochemical energy storage technologies should
be prevented, and more advanced energy storage technologies should be developed and
used.
6. Conclusions
Based on the development background of the “carbon neutral” and “digital economy”,
this paper studies the cooperation of digital drive photovoltaic–energy storage–use value
chain from the perspective of value intelligence creation. An evolutionary game model
of the three-party collaboration among the digital-driven photovoltaic power generator,
energy storage provider and user is constructed. Through game analysis and simula-
tion, this paper draws the following conclusions: (1) Driven by digital technologies, the
photovoltaic–storage–use value chain can collaborate more effectively. The photovoltaic
power generation, energy storage and energy use stakeholders can adopt various infor-
mation technologies to improve node energy efficiency and realize value intelligence
creation. (2) The larger the initial willingness of the photovoltaic power generator, energy
storage provider and user, the faster the three parties choose digital-driven value chain
collaboration. At the same time, the three parties will also impact each other’s choice of
collaboration strategy. For example, in the simulation case studied in Section 5.1, when
the initial collaborative willingness of the other two parties is low (0.3), the threshold of
the initial collaborative willingness of the photovoltaic power generator and user is in
the medium range (0.5–0.6) and high range (0.7–0.8), respectively. The initial willingness
of each party should be improved, especially the guiding role of the photovoltaic power
generator. (3) The photovoltaic power generator and user are more sensitive to influencing
factors. Although the energy storage provider is relatively weak in sensitivity, its willing-
ness to collaborate is stronger. (4) Digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain
collaboration will be affected by many factors. The higher the enabling benefit coefficient,
the lower the driving cost and potential risk, and the greater the incentives and punish-
ment, the more efficiently and effectively the three parties will evolve in the direction of
collaboration. For example, in the simulation case in Section 5.2.1, when the enabling
benefit coefficient of the photovoltaic power generator increases from 3.9 to 4.5, the time to
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3287 28 of 30
evolve to the collaborative state accelerates from about 0.12 to about 0.06, saving half of the
time. Therefore, the corresponding management strategies should be developed to promote
the coordinated decision making of the three agents in the value chains, so as to realize
the intelligent creation of value better. This paper reveals the digital-driven photovoltaic–
storage–use value chain collaborative mechanism, and how to achieve value intelligence
creation, providing a reference for stakeholders to choose strategies. Next, the content of
digital-driven photovoltaic–storage–use value chain collaborative decision-making, cost
allocation method, risk prevention mechanism and other aspects mentioned will be further
studied.
