Abstract: Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed into a field
of research and it purposes at linking many sensors enabling devices mostly
to data collection and track applications. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a
vital element of IoT paradigm since its inception and has developed into one of
the chosen platforms for deploying many smart city application regions such
as disaster management, intelligent transportation, home automation, smart
buildings, and other such IoT-based application. The routing approaches were
extremely-utilized energy efficient approaches with an initial drive that is, for
balancing the energy amongst sensor nodes. The clustering and routing pro-
cedures assumed that Non-Polynomial (NP) hard problems but bio-simulated
approaches are utilized to a recognized time for resolving such problems.
With this motivation, this paper presents a new blockchain with Enhanced
Hunger Games Search based Route Planning (BCEHGS-RP) scheme for IoT
assisted WSN. The presented BCEHGS-RP model majorly employs BC tech-
nology for secure communication in the IoT supported WSN environment. In
addition, an effective multihop route planning approach was designed by the
use of EHGS technique. The proposed EHGS technique is derived from the
concept of Hill Climbing strategy (HCS) and HGS algorithm. Moreover, a
fitness function with two parameters namely residual energy (RE) and inter-
cluster distance to elect optimal routes. The performance validation of the
BCEHGS-RP model is experimented with under diverse number of nodes.

1 Introduction
The rapid development of the WSN technologies received a demand for IoT applications which
forms the other pervasive very efficient. IoT was used to provide the network constantly all over the
world [1]. Moreover, the IoT goes with the principle which can be things or objects, and take part on
the basis of wireless connections with one another to assuring ubiquitous communications. Along with
that, the IoT was indulged with numerous applications that are smart homes, military, agriculture,
cities, etc [2]. In several IoT applications, the sensor node (SN) transfers sensed data into the Base
Station (BS) for enhancing the scalability, the energy efficiency, and data broadcast, in the WSNs which
builds network further practicable [3]. Conversely, with the efficient and resourceful communication
protocol for IoT or WSNs, there come numerous difficulties like undependability of low power wireless
links and the less sources which were absent in relation to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements [4].
According to the demand in before line, the growth of multipath aware routing protocol becomes vital
prerequisite which might assure minimum energy consumption, loss rate, delay, and the latency for
numerous applications from IoT [5,6]. Fig. 1 depicts the framework of IoT supported WSN.
Figure 1: Structure of IoT assisted WSN
The WSNs consist of limited life because of the limited energy capability of deployed SNs. So,
energy-efficient routing turns out to be a challenging research field in WSN [7,8]. Numerous current
policies were offered for presenting energy efficient (EE) routing in WSNs. But, clustering-related
protocols were mostly used for routing [9,10]. The energy can be effectively used when sending the
data packets to the BS. Many routing related prevailing research works are basically aimed at effectual
power utilization [11]. SNs produce a vast volume of data and transfer of the enormous volume of data
may lead to collision. A multi-channel communication method was used for reducing disputes amongst
SNs [12]. Numerous conventional routing plans leveraged composite event recognition for diminishing
power consumption. But then, centroid oriented routing improves the network performance by using
effective energy [13]. If transmission between BS and SNs was over, a black hole attack appears because
of random selection
Shen et al. [14] suggest a novel EE centroid-oriented routing protocol (EECRP) for WSN-
supported IoT for improving network performance. The presented EECRP has 3 main segments they
are a newly distributed cluster formation approach which allows the self-organization of local sensors,
and innovative sequences of systems to adapt cluster and rotate the CH in accordance with the centroid
CMC, 2023, vol.74, no.1 935
position to equally allocate the energy load between every SNs. The researchers in [15] suggest a new
Secure DL (SecDL) methodology for dynamic cluster-related WSN-IoT network systems. In order to
improvise the productivity of energy, the network was made that is Bi-Concentric Hexagons together
with Mobile Sink technology. Dynamic clusters were generated inside Bi-Hex network and optimal
CHs are selected by Quality Prediction Phenomenon (QP2) which assures energy efficiency and QoS.
Data aggregation was permitted in all the clusters and managed with a Two-way Data Elimination
after Reduction structure.
The authors in [16] present Scalable and EE routing protocol (SEEP). SEEP uses the multi-hop
hierarchical routing strategy for reducing power consumption. In order to attain scalably as well as
EE networks, SEEP uses a multi-tier related clustering structure. The network region in SEEP can be
segregated into several regions by using suggested subarea division system. The zones in the network
can be raised as size of the network rises to ignore long distance transmission. In [17], an original EE
SN-deployment scheme for two stage routing protocol (EE-DSTRP) was suggested for minimizing
the power utilization of SNs and expanding the network lifespan. SN deployment was a new method
that depends upon the golden ratio. Every conventional protocol segregates network regions for
transmission. Priyanga et al. [18] suggest an energy aware multiuser& multi-hop hierarchical-related
routing protocol (EAMMH-RP) has multi-hop transmission that equally dispenses the energy load
between every SNs in cluster formation, novel sequence of systems to adapt and rotate clusters, and
brand-novel process for reducing the power utilization for remote transmission.
This paper presents a new blockchain with Enhanced Hunger Games Search based Route
Planning (BCEHGS-RP) scheme for IoT assisted WSN. The presented BCEHGS-RP model majorly
employs BC technology for secure communication in the IoT supported WSN environment. In
addition, an effective multihop route planning technique was designed with the use of EHGS
technique. The proposed EHGS technique is derived from the concept of Hill Climbing strategy (HCS)
and HGS algorithm. Moreover, a fitness function with two parameters namely residual energy (RE)
and inter-cluster distance to elect optimal routes. The performance validation of the BCEHGS-RP
model has been experimented with under diverse number of nodes.
2 The Proposed Model
In this study, a novel BCEHGS-RP approach was established for secure communication in the
IoT assisted WSN. Besides, the presented BCEHGS-RP model majorly employed BC technology for
secure communication from the IoT supported WSN environment. Mover, an effective multihop route
planning technique is designed by the use of EHGS technique.
2.1 BC Enabled Secure Transmission
Blockchain (BC) is a distributed dataset, where each node must agree and participate in the
conclusion of appending novel blocks of dataset in BC and must have a counterfeit of that dataset
[19]. BC is a distributed ledger with data traceability, tamper-proof, and decentralization features. BC
is utilized for improving the robustness and trustworthiness of the routing dataset. Then, apply the BC
for recording the routing table database. The procedure of agreeing and participating in a majority
or common decision is named consensus. Here, we introduced an AI-based lightweight consensus
approach relevant to WSN. At present, the most consensus algorithm utilized is not relevant for WSN
since this algorithm consumes energy and processing power to reach consensus assumption appending
a novel block in BC. The widely employed consensus algorithm is Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of
Work (PoW). In PoW approach, every mining node takes part in the consensus procedure, and the
936 CMC, 2023, vol.74, no.1
node using additional assets, that is., hashing or computing power could assign novel block. In PoS,
the nodes using additional stakes have higher possibility to assign the novel block. The drawback
of algorithm is time delay and energy consumption to process novel blocks that make the algorithm
inappropriate for WSN due to less computing power and lower battery power. BC encompasses three
major elements chain, transactions or blocks, and consensus algorithm.
2.2 Design of EHGS Algorithm
Yang et al. [20] developed an HGS algorithm that is a population-based and gradient-free
optimizer, which imitate the collaborative foraging activity of social animal whose behavior is related
to the hunger degree. Especially, an adoptive weight is applied in HGS for stimulating the impact of
hunger in the logical rule (game) on every searching phase, which provides a simple, however, active
structure with higher efficiency. Because hunger is assumed to be the critical factor in preserving
homeostatic balance and affect animal decision and action, craving for food increase as starving.
Furthermore, game refers to logical rules adopted by nearly every animal for survival, namely
searching for food and defending itself from the predator. Once there is a constrained number of food,
a logical game starts among hungry animals that will struggle to discover food resources and win the
present competition. In the following, HGS can be mathematically modelled as follows.
2.2.1 Approach Food
This section demonstrates collaborative and independent predatory behavior of social animals,
which derive updating mechanism of the location in all the iterations. Even though social animal
frequently collaborates in group for hunting the prey, there exists the possibility that a certain
individual doesn’t contribute to teamwork. In that respect, three games are adapted for expressing
the behavior approaches to food in the following [21]:
−→
X (t + 1) =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
−→
X (t) · (1 + randn (1)) , r1 < l
−→
W1 · −→
Xb (t) + −→
R · −→
W2 ·
∣∣∣ −→
Xb (t) − −→
X (t)
∣∣∣ , r1 > l, r2 > E
−→
W1 · −→
Xb (t) − −→
R · −→
W2 ·
∣∣∣ −→
Xb (t) − −→
X (t)
∣∣∣ , r1 > l, r2 < E
(1)
From the expression, t represents the existing iteration;
−→
X (t) indicates every individual position;
−→
Xb (t) signifies the position of the finest individual in the existing iteration;
−→
W1 and
−→
W2 characterize
weight of hunger, randn (1) denotes an arbitrary value fulfilling standard distribution; r1 and r2 denotes
two arbitrary value ranges within [0, 1]; l represents a variable developed for enhancing the approach.
Here,
∣∣∣ −→
Xb (t) − −→
X (t)
∣∣∣ model “range of activity” for every agent (individual), and
−→
R is constrained
within [−a, a] extended. E served as a control variation determined as follows.
−→
R = a × (2 × r3 − 1) (2)
a = 2 ×
(
1 − t
T
)
(3)
E = sech (|F (i) − Fbest|) (4)
CMC, 2023, vol.74, no.1 937
From the equation, T denotes the maximal iteration count; r3 indicates an arbitrary value ranges
from [0, 1]; i ∈ 1, 2, . . . n and F (i) signifies the fitness value of all the agents; Fbest signifies the fitness
value of optimal agent; sech characterizes the hyperbolic function as (x) = 2
eχ + e−χ
.
In this section, three guidelines are classified into two factors for the population, that is,
−→
X -based
and
−→
Xb-based. The initial game focused on autonomous hunting behaviors without team work for
some individuals. The final two games simulate the collective foraging activity using
−→
R ,
−→
W1 and
−→
W2.
Such laws offer each individual different potential positions for exploring the optimum solution in the
searching space. Fig. 2 illustrates the flowchart of HGS approach.
Figure 2: Flowchart of HGS algorithm
2.2.2 Hunger Role
In this part, the hunger-driven features are modelled arithmetically. In another word, the impact
of hunger on every searching stage in the game setting is formulated.
The description of “weight of hunger”
(
i.e.,
−→
W1 and
−→
W2
)
are evaluated by:
−→
W1 (ι) =
{
hungry (i) · N
SHungry
× r4, r3 < l
1, r3 > l
(5)
−→
W2 (ι) = (1 − exp (− |hungry (i) − Hungry|)) × r5 × 2 (6)
In the equation, hungry(i) signifies the hunger stage of all the agents; SHungry denotes a sum of
hungry quantity of every agent, viz., sum (hungry); N symbolizes the amount of agents; r3, r4 and r5
indicates arbitrary integer lies within [0l1] .
938 CMC, 2023, vol.74, no.1
The hungry(i) is provided in the following:
hungry (i) =
{
0, F (i) = Fbest
hungry (i) + H F (i) �= Fbest
(7)
From the formula, the hunger stage of the optimal individual in all the iterations is often fixed as
zero that produces hungry
(−→
Xb
)
= 0. For each other, a novel hunger sensation (H) is appended to the
actual hunger stage for generating individual diversification.
The equation of H is shown below.
H =
{
LH × (1 + r6)l TH < LH
TH, TH ≥ LH
(8)
TH = F (i) − Fbest
Fworst − Fbest
× r7 × 2 × (ub − lb) (9)
In the formula, LH indicates lower limits of the hunger sensation H; r6 and r7 denotes the two
arbitrary number ranges within [0, 1]; Fworst denotes the fitness values of worst agent; ub and lb indicate
the upper and lower limits of the searching region, correspondingly.
From the above expression,
F (i) − Fbest
Fworst − Fbest
denotes the hunger ratio, where F (i) − Fbest indicates
the quantity of food that agent demands to accomplish the comprehensive non-hungry state, and
Fworst − Fbest denotes the highest foraging ability of the agent in the present iteration.
The proposed EHGS technique is derived from the concept of HCS and HGS algorithm. The HCS
refers to local search form [22]. Firstly, arbitrary solution is initiated and frequently moves downhill
from a present solution till the neighborhood solution with best quality is reached. It is applied in
various challenges of optimization tasks. The HCS initiated by a random solution for the candidate’s
problems Hi = {
H1
i , H2
i , . . . , Hn
i
}
, and later Neighborhood navigation (N-operator) and β operators
are applied to repetitively produce novel solution H ′
i = {H ′1
i , H ′2
i , . . . , H ′n
i }. In all the iterations of HCS,
the N-operator phase is implemented by the random walk model for obtaining the
(
H ′
i
)
neighboring
solution of the Hi solution in the following:
H
′k
i = Hk
i ± U (0, 1) × BW ∃! k ∈ [1, n] (10)
Now, BW = UBk − LBk.
At the same time, β operator is used to allocate new values for the H ′
i solution through the original
value of Hi or the novel one as follows:
H
′k
i =
{
Hr
i if rand ≤ β
Hk
i otherwise
(11)
The β-operator increases the exploration of HCS by roaming from a searching region to others.
Moreover, exploitation is implemented by the N-operator phase that helps the neighborhood search
for the existing solution. Using this operator, the HCS could prevent falling into the local minimal.

2.3 Process Involved in Route Planning
In this study, an effective multihop route planning technique is designed by the use of EHGS
technique with a fitness function with two parameters namely residual energy (RE) and inter-cluster
distance to elect optimal routes [23–25]. In the case of routing, the dimension of every single population
in the EHGS algorithm is similar to CH and the further position is added in the BS. Given that,
θ i = (θ i
1, θ i
2|θ i
p+1) refers to a ith bacterium, θ i
ni
that denotes real values amongst [0, 1]. Next, the proposed
mapping function is utilized to evaluate the next-hop to BS. A mapping function is represented as
follows.
f (x) =
{
i, forwhich
∣∣∣∣
(
i
k
− Xif j
)∣∣∣∣ isminimum, ∀i1 ≤ i ≤ k (12)
In Eq. (12), the primary goal is to select the optimal path among BS and CHs. It is achieved by
utilizing the fitness function by assuming objectives such as Euclidean distance, and RE. At first, the
RE of succeeding hop is preferred as a relay to BS. For transmission purposes, the succeeding hop
attains and gathers information and transmits them to BS. Therefore, the maximal RE for next-hop
is greatly preferable. Hence, initial sub-objective interms of RE is f 1 upgraded by using Eq. (13):
f 1 =
∑m
i=1
ECHi (13)
Following, Euclidean distance is applied to describe the distance amongst the CH to BS and next-
hop. Energy reduction is in equal proportion to a transmission distance. Once a distance is low, then
its minimal quantity of energy is exhausted. Therefore, the secondary objective is to minimalize the
distance amongst BS and CH. At last, it improves the lifetime of the network. Therefore, the secondary
sub-objective using distance is f 2 is represented by using:
f 2 = 1∑m
i=1dis (CHi, NH) + dis (NH, BS)
(14)
The abovementioned sub-objective transforms the normalization function at different ranges.
Next, the weighted sum method was utilized for sub objective and changed to a single objective. Here,
α1 and α2 implies the weight assigned for each sub-objective.
Fitness = α1 (f 1) + α2 (f 2) , where
∑2
i=1
αi = 1αiε (0, 1) ; (15)
3 Experimental Validation
The experimental validation of the BCEHGS-RP model is tested on MATLAB tool. The results
are inspected under two scenarios: node count of 100 and node count of 150. Tab. 1 and Fig. 3
provide a brief average residual energy (ARE) inspection of the BCEHGS-RP approach with existing
methodologies under 100 nodes. The obtained values inferred that the BCEHGS-RP algorithm has
shown better results with maximum values of ARE. For instance, with 10 rounds, the BCEHGS-
RP model has demonstrated higher ARE of 9.28 J while the MEQSA-OLSRv2 method, EOMR
algorithm, EMEER approach, FGGWO system, and TSGWO methodology have attained lower
ARE of 9.01, 8.91, 8.86, 8.98, and 9.13 J respectively. In addition, with 50 rounds, the BCEHGS-RP

with recent methodologies under 100 nodes. The attained values exposed that the BCEHGS-RP
approach has outperformed optimum outcomes with maximal values of LLT. For instance, with 10
rounds, the BCEHGS-RP algorithm has outperformed superior LLT of 1.326 s but the MEQSA-
OLSRv2 method, EOMR algorithm, EMEER approach, FGGWO system, and TSGWO method-
ology have gained lower LLT of 0.027, 0.464, 0.157, 0.044, and 0.150 s correspondingly. More-
over, with 50 rounds, the BCEHGS-RP model has exhibited improvised LLT of 0.604 s while the
MEQSA-OLSRv2 method, EOMR algorithm, EMEER approach, FGGWO system, and TSGWO
methodology have illustrated lower LLT of 0.007, 0.092, 0.126, 0.024, and 0.157 s correspondingly.
Moreover, with 100 rounds, the BCEHGS-RP system has exposed maximal LLT of 0.278 s while the

4 Conclusion
In this study, a novel BCEHGS-RP approach was established for secure communication in the
assisted WSN. Besides, the presented BCEHGS-RP model majorly employed BC technology for
secure communication from the IoT supported WSN environment. Mover, an effective multihop route
planning approach was designed with utilize of EHGS technique. The proposed EHGS technique
is derived from the concept of HCS and HGS algorithm. Moreover, a fitness function with two
parameters namely RE and inter-cluster distance to elect optimal routes. The performance validation
of the BCEHGS-RP model has been experimented with under diverse number of nodes. Extensive
experimental outcomes highlighted the better performance of the BCEHGS-RP approach on existing
approaches. In futureIoT, data aggregation and compression systems are planned for improving the
longevity of the network.
