Abstract—Crypto Kitties is one of the most well-known games
built on the Ethereum blockchain and has been in operation
for a longer time. This paper examines the market’s fairness
by focusing on the gene determination algorithm required for
breeding two kittens. This method has very little unpredictability,
and as a result, players who understand it have a considerable
edge over those who do not. Furthermore, this paper demon-
strates a methodology that aims to increase randomness in the
gene determination algorithm by associating it with a discrete
crossover operator. In the end, this paper addresses some of the
drawbacks of crypto kitties and countermeasures to overcome
them.
Index Terms—Smart contracts, Crypto kitties, Non-fungible
tokens, Solidity, Ethereum, Genetic algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
One of the most exceptional technologies that surfaced in
late 2017 is the blockchain system [1]. This technology gained
popularity nine years after the release of Satoshi Nakamoto’s
Bitcoin whitepaper [2]. Bitcoin, initially investigated this area
for a payment application. However, Ethereum attempts to
actualize the space created by "smart contracts beyond the
payment process." Smart contracts are open-source programs
that execute automatically without the intervention of any
centralized authority [3]. The Ethereum platform, often known
as Blockchain 2.0, highly motivated the construction of DApps
backed by smart contracts [4], [5].
Blockchain technology has opened up a new approach to
creating digital scarcity, and perhaps, new types of market
value are created due to the advancements [6]. This idea
has found practical realization in several digital projects on
the blockchain. For example, projects such as Crypto kitties,
Crypto punks [7], Care Bears, and Crypto apes have initiated
a boom of NFTs on the art marketplace. One of the most
important goals of permissionless blockchain technology and
smart contract as an application is to ensure that an economic
system is transparent and fair. This is uncertain for smart con-
tracts applications but may be true for payment applications
such as bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
For the fairness of smart contracts, two aspects need to
be considered in the shadow. The first is the effect of an
autonomous system, and the other is the liability of the
programming code. Users may find it challenging to handle
their assets and strategies and comprehend how their financial
transactions are carried out fairly if they employ autonomous
execution. The users are requested to trust the smart contract’s
code. But ordinary people find it difficult to comprehend code
written in programming languages such as solidity, vyper, etc.
At the time of framing this article, we do not have a good
measure to determine whether a specific smart contract or
application is fair or not. Therefore, though discussing the
integrity of smart contracts is an extensive investigation, it
is worthwhile to investigate the underlying causes of smart
contract inequity. This direction will serve as the foundation
for such evaluation standards.
B. Contributions of this paper
The main contributions of this manuscript are summarized
as follow:
1) This paper highlights the potential unfairness of the
market created by a worldwide famous application called
crypto kitties. According to some estimates, the impact
of crypto kitties is worth more than 40 million. Thus,
the existence of possible unfairness may raise concerns
about the site’s credibility as a crypto-asset exchange.
2) In particular, we focus on the breeding process, which
is used to generate ERC721 tokens in crypto kitties. In
this game, an ERC721 token is a kitty [8]. We assume
the purpose of this game for each player is to earn Ether
by swapping tokens and having fun with the kitty. The
gene algorithm in this game determines the qualities of
a freshly born kitten, an ERC-721 coin.
As a consequence of our research, we discovered that
crypto kitties does not satisfy certain conditions to employ
fairness in the market. The gene determination algorithm lacks
qualified randomness, and it has a significant impact on the
character determination of a newborn kitten. It is a source
of knowledge asymmetry. Only someone aware of the nature
of random function can predict the traits of a new kitty. We
discovered that individuals who are aware of the bias and can
purchase kittens that give birth to valuable kittens earn more
profit in the form of Ether. This fact contradicts the fairness
of opportunities provided to the users to gain profit. As a

countermeasure, in this paper, we propose an algorithm that
incorporates randomness to alleviate the predictability of child
genes. The rest of the paper is organized as follows;
Literature review of the previously designed data aggrega-
tion models are described in Section II. Section III represents
the related preliminaries used throughout the paper. The
detailed construction of the proposed model is illustrated in
Section IV. Further, we elaborate the experimental analysis
in Section V. Finally, we conclude the proposed model with
future work in Section VI.
II. RELATED LITERATURE
Alesha Serada et al. [9] looked at crypto kitties as a case
study to explore how blockchain will influence game creation
in the future. First, they looked into the connection between
token ownership and crypto kittie’s value construction. Next,
they contend with the various aspects of the gaming economy
that make it unsustainable. The authors demonstrated the
reasons behind the fall in kitty’s worth and the value of
Gen0, which can not be produced by breeding. They also
indicated that higher GAS transaction costs could stifle new
user participation.
Kentaro Sako et al. [10] emphasized the importance of
fairness in an open and unrestricted market. They highlighted
the various unfair factors exercised by crypto kitties. For
example, the authors claimed that persons fluent in the Solidity
programming language have a better probability of profiting
than those unable to forecast the behavior of kitty generation
methods. They also proposed countermeasures to reduce the
unfairness caused by the market of crypto kitties.
Charlotte et al. [11] discussed the idea of trust without trust
in blockchain technology. The authors questioned whether
parties might conduct business with one another without
relying on officially sanctioned confidence. The writers clearly
articulated the need for users to test the legitimacy of claims
made by Dapps. They concentrated on a Dapp called crypto
kitties and questioned its decentralized aspect. Charlotte em-
phasizes that it is a flaw that some people can deceive others
into carrying out a dishonest commitment.
Alesha Serada demonstrated the significance of ‘vintage’
for community players in the online crypto games. The
author accessed the influence of the label ‘vintage’ in the
early months of 2018 by studying the application of crypto
kitties. The author concludes that crypto kitty failed to acquire
enormous market value despite gaining explosive popularity
due to breeding [12].
Shang Gao et al. [13] discovered the reasons behind the
user’s intention of using blockchain-based games. Perceived
practicality, ease of use, fun, and trust were the vital determi-
nants for the research model. On the other hand, subjective
norm had no positive effect on the user’s performance ex-
pectancy.
III. PRELIMINARIES
This paper aims to bring a fair view to all the players of a
blockchain game, crypto kitties irrespective of ETH in their
wallet and their ability to comprehend solidity. Furthermore,
the proposed methodology increases randomness in the gene
determination algorithm used for breeding.
A. Blockchain
Blockchain is a database often used as a ledger for
cryptocurrency transactions. Decentralization, censorship-free,
immutability, transparency, and anonymity are some of the
unique features of Blockchain. A blockchain is made up of a
list of blocks. Transactions, a timestamp, a prior hash, and
a nonce are included in each block. A transaction mainly
consists of three parts: a sender, a recipient, and a value.
Users of the blockchain network submit potential trans-
actions via various software, including desktop applications,
smartphone applications, digital wallets, and web services
[14]. These transactions are sent to a node or nodes within the
blockchain network. Subsequently, the submitted transactions
are propagated to the rest of the network’s nodes. A pending
transaction must wait in a queue until it is published to
the blockchain by a publishing node after being broadcasted
among nodes. When a publishing node publishes a block,
transactions are appended to the blockchain.
B. Smart contracts
Smart contracts are executed on a blockchain when prede-
fined conditions are met. Ethereum is the first to implement
smart contracts. They’re used to automate the execution so
that all participants can be positive of the conclusion without
any intermediaries or wastage of time. They can also automate
a workflow, starting when certain circumstances are satisfied.
C. Crypto kitties
Crypto kitties are among the most well-known blockchain-
based games on Ethereum [15]. Axiom Zen created this game
in 2017. Fig. 1 shows the overview of crypto kitties. In this
game, users trade ERC721 tokens using the native coin of
Ethereum, ether. An ERC721 is a non-fungible token. These
tokens are one of a kind with specific properties. The value
of each ERC721 token depreciates over time. There is an ID,
a gene, and a generation for each cat. The ID of a kitten is
assigned in chronological order of birth, and the gene that
determines the kitty’s appearance is generated via a Solidity
algorithm. A child kitty’s generation is one greater than the
parent kittens’ generation. The blockchain stores not only
the transactions but the data of these kitties. Smart contracts
handle all the trades and breeding in this game as the source
code is written in solidity.
There are two ways to obtain a kitty; one is winning an
auction and the gene determination algorithm creates the other.
The user must choose parent kittens as input to the algorithm
to create a new kitty. One parent kitties can be one of his
cats or a kitty he got in a rental auction. He can get a baby
kitty after picking parent kitties. Thus, this process is known
as breeding. A kitten can be either a matron or a sire because
it has no gender. The gene and generation of a baby kitten
are determined through breeding.

D. Crypto kitty market analysis
A fair market should adhere to the requirements that safe-
guard the vulnerable. First, it must be impossible to defraud
people to make money. The knowledge asymmetry, which
allows some people to earn a higher profit than others, must
remain relatively small. Finally, all players must be treated
equally in the trading environment. The same set of rules must
apply to Crypto kitties. In crypto kitties, a way to earn Ether
is to get and sell a high-value kitty. All players should get
equal chances to own precious kitties for this game to be fair.
This paper focuses on the unfair aspect of breeding. So, an
unfair practice could include winning the kitty at the auction
without obeying the rules or gaining it by manipulating the
breeding algorithm. CryptoKitties must prohibit both actions.
Crypto kitties should essentially provide answers to specific
questions such as how a new kitty is created and what kind of
kitty is traded at what price, regardless of a player’s eloquence
in Solidity. Again, a user can obtain a kitty by auction
or breeding. For breeding, a gene determination algorithm
reveals the creation of a kitty. If a player learns the game’s
mechanism, he will determine which kitten he should receive
and which kitties he should choose as parents to gain the
most profit. As a result, his decision is influenced by how
well he understands the game. Hence, we define the weak as
players who have a limited amount of Ethereum and cannot
comprehend Solidity.

IV. PROPOSED MODEL
This section demonstrates the proposed gene determination
algorithm that builds the value of tokens to be traded in the
market. A gene is a 256-bit unsigned number that defines the
kitty’s appearance. A gene array of length 16 is considered in
this algorithm. This value is classified into eight categories.
Each group has two cells; the first two are group 0, the next
two are group 1, etc. Each pair displays a different aspect of
the kitty’s appearance.
The algorithm uses the hash value on the Ethereum
blockchain recognized as the target block. A baby gene is
dependent on its parents’ genes and the target block’s hash
value. The genes of all kitties are available on the blockchain.
The target block is the one that is issued when a matron kitty
regains her fertility. Specifically, the product of the variable,
which stores the frequency of block creation and the dame’s
kitty breeding period, results in the blocks issued when she
can reproduce again. The information about the breeding
period is available on the official website of crypto kitties.
By computing the hash value of the target block, one can
easily predict a baby gene. The demand for parent cats is
high because the outcome of the gene finding algorithm is
foreseeable, and only the wealthy can afford them.
A. Working
Fig. 2 illustrates the systems’ overview and solution to
mitigate the above problem by adding external randomness
to the gene determination algorithm. This method implements
the genetic algorithm with a discrete crossover operator to
produce single offspring. The genes from the parents are
selected depending upon the random real number. The mode
of the joint input of the users creates this 8-bit random
number. The output remains unpredictable as all the users
can not predict the information. Further, a small percentage of
randomness is deployed to this output by using the timestamp
value of the block.

V. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
To assess the proposed system’s effectiveness, we have
deployed the smart contracts written in solidity are on the
ropsten testnet Ethereum network using the truffle framework.
We have tested the proposed functionality successfully. All
function calls can be viewed using the etherscan, a blockchain
explorer for ropsten to verify the transactions and cost of
execution. Fig. 3 shows the implementation of the breeding
using the proposed gene determination algorithm.

operation between two kittens. This is a snapshot of a meta
mask wallet displaying the information about cumulative gas
incurred.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper concludes that the crypto kitty does not provide a
fair market for all users. Furthermore, we discovered that the
gene determination algorithm depends on the target block’s
hash value which is easily predictable by the player familiar
with solidity. Players can have a significant advantage if
they are aware of this bias. To mitigate the unfairness, we
have proposed a countermeasure. The proposed solution adds
randomness to the gene determination algorithm by taking the
input from the users.
We aim to extend this work towards the transaction and
breeding fee. Higher transaction fees can be an obstacle for
an average user. For example, a user pays Ether in exchange
for a kitty. Besides, the current breeding fee is 0.008 ETH.
This limits the action count for some players. Therefore,
they have limited opportunities to own good kitties and earn
profit compared to rich people, and thereby we will propose
a countermeasure to reduce breeding fees.
