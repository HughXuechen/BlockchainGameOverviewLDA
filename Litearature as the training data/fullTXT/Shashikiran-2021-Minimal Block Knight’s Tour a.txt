Abstract
The data security of an information is predominant in the digital world and gaining lot of importance. Cryptography and 
steganography are widely used in providing security to an information. In the proposed algorithm, the image encryption and 
steganography are performed using Knight’s move in the game of chess called Knight’s Tour Algorithm. Minimum block 
or square required for a knight’s tour to reach all the squares is 5 × 5 block. The 5 × 5 blocks’ pattern generated is used for 
image encryption. The encrypted image is then embedded into another image and block shuffling is performed to obtain a 
crypto-stego image. Proposed algorithm is robust and provides high data security with a good PSNR and SSIM.

Introduction
The incessant development and popularization of digital 
technology has changed the processing of secret images. The 
entire world is moving towards smart era driven by digital 
technology and all information is accessible at finger tips. 
Every second, more than a million information is exchanged 
across the internet in different formats, such as text, audio, 
image or video. Information in the image is sparkling and 
visually attractive than text information. Sensitive, personal 
information or defense information related to a country or 
medical information or documents related to an organization 
need to be protected from trespassers when it is distributed 
and shared over internet.
The recursive root cause analysis is carried out on trap-
ping and attack of information by trespassers and data 
protective techniques are improved with new security 
algorithms. There are many effective techniques that are 
available to protect the data from unauthorized access like 
cryptography and steganography. Image files are extensively 
used nowadays due to its high capacity and easy accessibility 
and protecting these image files are the top priority. Many 
cryptography, steganography and crypto-steganography 
algorithms are developed.
Chess is a game of adaptive strategy and intelligence. 
Each move of pieces in the chess ends with some pattern 
by the end of game. The pattern of each pieces has encour-
aged many combinatorial puzzles. The most interesting and 
popular patterns are obtained from Knight’s Tour and Eight 
Queen puzzle.
Knight’s tour [1–3] is an arrangement of moves of a 
knight on a chess board such that knight visits each square 
just once. If the knight tops on a same square where it 
started, then it is called closed tour, otherwise it is open. The 
knight’s tour problem has become the mathematical puzzle 
and motivated open thoughts for many image processing and 
pattern-based research work. The moves of knight in chess 
game are very tactical to end the game with possible win. 
Knight’s tour is not restricted only for a chess board size 
8 × 8, but it can be extended for any size M × N. To obtain a 
solution for Knight’s tour, minimum size of the board should 
be 5 × 5. Figure 1a shows one of the patterns generated by 
knight’s tour on 8 × 8 board and Fig. 1b shows one of the 
patterns generated by knight’s tour on 5 × 5 board.

Steganography [4] is a technique of hiding information 
such that it does not attract the attention of unauthorized 
persons. Steganography means protected writing and is 
originated [5] from two Greek words ‘Steganos’ means pro-
tected and ‘graphia’ means writing. Types of steganography 
methods [6] used for embedding information are text, image, 
video and audio steganography. Nevertheless, all types of 
steganography can be combined together to protect the secret 
information [7]. Image steganography is a widespread digital 
steganography used in most of the application.
Cryptography [8] is a technique used for protected com-
munication between authorized persons in the presence of 
unauthorized person. Cryptography [9] is categorized into 
two types: symmetric-key cryptography in which same key 
is used for encryption and decryption; when different keys 
are used, it is called asymmetric-key cryptography. With the 
increase use of image for information sharing, image encryp-
tion [10] gained lot of demand in the digital era. Differ-
ent algorithms are used for image encryption ranging from 
mathematical operations on individual pixels to blocks of 
pixels.
This work is focused towards encrypting an image 
using minimal knight’s tour algorithm and embedding the 
encrypted image in other image using steganography. Mini-
mal knight’s tour is open tour knight’s move on a 5 × 5 block. 
Knight’s tour does not exist below 5 × 5 block which visits 
all the locations in a block and also for an odd size of blocks, 
there exists no closed knight’s tour.
The proposed algorithm is applicable in vast field like 
confidential communication, protection of data modification, 
database systems in an organization and other applications.
Motivation
The development of technology and interest of people to 
have the information at finger tips has encountered in infor-
mation security issues. During COVID-19 pandemic, most 
of the physical things changed to virtual things, viz online 
classes, meetings, shopping, etc. Some organizations inevi-
tably need to share the information virtually. Few of which 
are making a way for trespassers to hack the information. 
The main idea is to secure the information in an image by 
embedding encrypted image using minimal knight’s tour 
algorithm.
Contribution
The information in the image needs to be protected from 
the intruders. Various encryption and steganography algo-
rithms exist to secure the secret information in an image. 
With the drastic development in the technology, new algo-
rithms are required for securing the information in an image. 
In this work, smallest knight’s tour algorithm is used for 
image scrambling to get crypto-image. This crypto-image is 
then embedded into other image using edge-based and LSB 
pixel replacement which is applied with block shuffling to 
get crypto-stego image.
Organization
Related work and problem definition are discussed in Sect. 2 
and 3, respectively. Embedding and decryption process with 
implementation algorithm is described in Sect. 4. Perfor-
mance results are discussed in Sect. 5.
Related Work
Steganography and cryptography are the techniques that pro-
vide security to digital information with the development 
of digital technology; enormous research at present is in 
the field of data security. Knight’s move in game of chess 
is different compared to other games and is used in image 
processing applications. Image encryption and steganogra-
phy can be achieved using the knight’s tour algorithm and

a minimal open knight’s tour algorithm is proposed in the 
work.
Manpreet et al., [11] proposed image encryption algo-
rithm by scrambling the image using standard chessboard 
knight’s tour approach with Euler’s solution. Jiang et al., 
[12] proposed an encryption algorithm using Knight’s tour 
matrix and slip filter convolution approach by altering filter 
template matrix.
Kanchan et  al., [13] proposed knight’s tour matrix 
algorithm in which, image is divided into m x n block 
size. Knight’s tour matrix neighborhood addition modulo 
encryption is performed to get the encrypted image in two 
phases. Said et al., [14] proposed image encryption and 
steganography technique using DNA encoding Choquet’s 
integral sequences. Four coded images are produced using 
the DNA bases and integral sequences are generated, Cho-
quet’s approach used to get four random sequences that 
are encoded. Wavelet fusion algorithm is used to generate 
encrypted image.
Chaotic Lorenz system-based information hiding tech-
nique is proposed in [15]. Encryption parameters are derived 
from Lorenz differential equation and using this equation, 
secret image is encrypted and standard LSB technique is 
applied on RGB planes separately to embed the encrypted 
image into Cover image. DCT-based image steganography 
algorithm is proposed in [16]. Two-dimensional DCT is 
applied on a non-overlapping 8 × 8 block image and a quan-
tization of image is performed with quality factor of 50. 
Non-zero coefficients of K × K blocks are unaltered and other 
blocks are embedded with secret image pixels to get the 
stego image.
Histogram-oriented gradient and intensity gradient are 
used to get the block of interest with a size of 2 × 2 for 
embedding secret image, on the BOI (block of interest) pixel 
value differencing algorithm is performed in [17]. The pro-
cess of compressing the secret image is embedded into cover 
image is discussed in [18]. Coefficient adjustment scheme is 
employed to slightly modify the cover image based on stego 
image. Hiding process is performed based on the quality 
factor.
Graph signal processing (GSP)-based image steganogra-
phy is discussed in [19]. Arnold cap transformation is used 
on secret image to scrambled image and then graph wavelets 
are performed on both cover image and secret image. Alpha 
bending is performed and then embedding process is car-
ried out to get stego image. Quotient value differencing and 
LSB substitution-based image steganography and discussed 
in [20]. 3 × 3 non-overlapping pixel blocks are considered 
and QVD is identified. There exists a gradient substation 
of pixels at higher bits and standard LSB replacement is 
performed to get stego image.
Problem Definition
Problem Statement
Digital information in the form of image is widely used with 
the progress of technology. It is observed that trespassers 
attack the image to retrieve information. Securing the infor-
mation hidden in an image when it is personal and sensitive 
is a challenging task. So, crypto-steganography algorithm is 
developed to embed secret information.
Objectives
The objective of our work is to:
 (i) To develop algorithm to maintain integrity and con-
fidentiality of the information.
 (ii) To embed secret image using a cover image with 
knight’s tour.
Assumptions
Few of the assumptions in developing algorithm are:
 (i) Size of the cover image is M × M i.e., square image.
 (ii) Size of the QR code image is less than M/2 × M/2 of 
cover image.
Implementation
The method proposed is to apply LSB technique and mini-
mal knight’s tour algorithm on secret image and cover image 
to obtain stego image such that only lawful person has access 
to hidden information. In this work, a knight tour-based pixel 
replacement algorithm is developed to encrypt the secret 
image, making it difficult to trace the original information. 
The encrypted image is embedded at the edges of blocks and 
last two-bit planes of cover image using LSB Replacement 
technique. The obtained image is again applied block shuf-
fling for replacement of blocks.
To recover the secret image from stego image, Knight’s 
tour backtracking algorithm is applied on blocks of stego 
image and reverse LSB technique is performed to get the 
encrypted image. The decryption of image is performed 
using backtracking of knight’s tour algorithm. The block 
diagram of proposed algorithm is represented is Fig. 2. Met-
rices, such as MSE and PSNR, are calculated to validate the 
quality of the obtained image and SSIM is calculated to find 
the structural similarity of cover image and stego image. The 
key for encryption and decryption is optional and patterns 
generated using knight’s tour should be same for encryp-
tion and decryption for the integrity of data. Change in the

pattern for encryption and decryption results in redundant 
information of the image.
Embedding Process
For embedding secret image in cover image, it is assumed 
that the ratio in size of the images should be 1:2, respec-
tively. For a minimal knight’s tour algorithm, the size of 
block should be 5 × 5 and an algorithm is developed on 
5 × 5 matrix. The numbers generated on 5 × 5 matrix using 
knight’s tour algorithm are converted to a single column. 
The secret image is divided into 5 × 5 pixel blocks and con-
verted to a single column in a sequential order. Numbers 
generated using algorithm are now mapped to pixels posi-
tions and replaced based on the encryption block of pixels. 
The process of encryption is extended all over the image 
with 5 × 5 pixel blocks. The cover image is also divided into 
P x Q pixel blocks. Encrypted secret image is embedded 
at the last two-bit planes of cover image and extreme cor-
ner pixels. Once the pixel replacements is completed, block 
shuffling is performed and minimal knight’s tour algorithm 
is performed to obtain Crypto-Stego image.
The cover image is represented by:
where M = N.
Secret image is represented by:
where K = L = M/2.
Secret image B(m,n) is divided into 5 × 5 pixel blocks first 
block is represented by:
Knight’s tour algorithm is produced based on the L-shape 
knight’s move in chess based on its current position. Few 
of the moves are represented in the Fig. 3. Once the Knight 
visits a position, it is grayed out or marked as full and not 
allowing knight to visit the same position again (Figs. 4, 5). 
A Knight can have a maximum option to have one among 8 
positions to move when it is placed at the center and a mini-
mum of 2 positions to move when it is placed at the corner. 
Based on the present position of knight, number of possible 
positions available for next move is decided by:
This encrypted image is embedded into 7th and 8th bit 
planes of cover image using LSB-based steganography to 
obtain the stego image and a block shuffling is performed 
using block flip operation to get crypto-stego image repre-
sented by:

Decryption Process
Decrypting the secret image from crypto-stego image is 
exactly reverse of embedding process. The crypto-stego 
image is divided into P × Q pixel blocks and inverse block 
shuffling algorithm is applied to get stego image from the 
7th and 8th bit planes of stego image-encrypted secret image 
is extracted.
The encrypted secret image is divided into 5 × 5 pixel 
blocks and converted to a single column in a sequential 
order. Knight’s tour algorithm performed on 5 × 5 block to 
generate the numbers is mapped with the encrypted image 
to get the secret image information. The representation of 
image and mathematical calculations is same as embedding 
process.

Performance Evaluation
Performance Metrices
Mean square error (MSE) MSE is defined as the square of 
error between cover image and stego image and is given by:
Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) PSNR is defined as the 
peak signal-to-noise ratio, it is used to regulate the excel-
lence of the image before and after crypto-steganography. 
The suitable value of PNSR for a typical 8-bit image is 30 
to 50 dB and PSNR is calculated as:
Structural similarity index measure (SSIM) It is a method 
for visualizing the apparent quality of an image by determin-
ing the similarity between two images. SSIM is based on 
three evaluation measurements between the input and output 
images given by luminance (l), contrast (c) and structure (s) 
mathematically represented by:
where �x is the average of x, �y is theaverage of y, �2
x
 is the 
variance of x, �2
y
 is the variance of y, �xy is the covariance 
of x and y.
Performance Analysis
To measure the performance analysis, standard image data 
sets are used and results are calculated based on the per-
formance metrices. PSNR and SSIM are calculated and 
tabulated in the results. PSNR is calculated before block 
shuffling. SSIM is calculated before and after block shuffling 
to find the structural similarity of the images. Though mul-
tiple levels of operations are performed, block shuffling and 
encryption operations are lossless process as it only changes 
the positions of pixels without modifying pixel value. The 
loss of redundant information encountered only during 
embedding process. Some images used in the proposed 
algorithm and its crypto-stego images are shown in Fig. 6.
The algorithm proposes a new way of securing the 
information in an image by encrypting and embedding in 
another image using minimal Knight’s tour algorithm. The 
algorithm is implemented using m-script and is on standard 
set of images. PSNR and SSIM are calculated and tabulated

compromised PSNR and better SSIM. The pattern gener-
ated using the algorithm makes the encryption stronger with 
different starting positions. Same pattern is used for encryp-
tion and decryption, thus providing the integrity to data. The 
encrypted image is a result of lossless encryption process 
which involves only replacement of pixels without any modi-
fication to its value. The encrypted image is embedded into 
a cover image which is then shuffled using block shuffling 
or Knight’s tour to obtain a crypto-stego image resulting 
in further security and confidentiality to information in an 
image with acceptable PSNR and better SSIM. The proposed 
algorithm provides security to an image resulting in encryp-
tion of secret image and is embedded in another image such 
that it is not visible to eavesdropper.
