Abstract. Since almost all new bitcoins nowadays are minted by min-
ing pools, the security of mining pools is quite crucial to the health of
the Bitcoin system. Among the attacks targeting at mining pools, the
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is the notable one. Previous
research shows that mining pools would launch DDoS attacks on oth-
ers when the size is relatively large. However, no mining pools claimed
responsibility to any DDoS attacks on mining pools till now. In this
paper, we revise the previous game-theoretic analysis model by adding
DDoS defense cost. With the assumption that the whole computing
resource of any mining pool consists of mining, defense and attack, we
obtain some interesting conclusions. (1) If the failure probability of DDoS
attack is high, then mining pools would have a greater incentive to stay
peacefully. (2) Increasing the computing resource in mining is always the
primary choice for mining pools, no matter whether they are launching
DDoS attacks or under DDoS attacks.

1 Introduction
Due to the decentralized, crypto-protected, and transparent properties, Bitcoin
[21] has gained considerable popularity during the past ten years. It has even
become like a worldwide currency. One reason for this tremendous success is that
everybody could be the minter of a new bitcoin. Only if he/she finds a solution to
a specific cryptographic puzzle before others, he/she can own the new bitcoins.
In other words, more computing resource, more bitcoins. This situation leads to
two strategies to earn more bitcoins. One is to increase competitive computing
resources, which results in a prosperous market for specialized hardware [6].
The other is to collaborate with some other miners to constitute a mining pool,
which evolves to that almost all new bitcoins are minted/mined by mining pools
currently [5].

Due to the importance of the mining pools in the Bitcoin system, many
attacks targeting at mining pools have emerged. Among those, the distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attack is the most famous one. The earliest reported
DDoS attacks can even go back to 2011 [1], and one peak of DDoS incidents on
mining pools happened in 2015 [2]. We also witnessed that several mining pools,
such as Altcoin.pw [14] and GHash.io [3], shut down (partially) due to repeated
DDoS attacks. Currently, anti-DDoS implementation is a crucial part of the
standard configuration for mining pools [7]. However, DDoS attacks still happen
from time to time [4]. It is believed that DDoS attacks come from two kinds of
entities. One is the hackers whose goal is to hijack the attacked mining pool.
The other is the competing mining pool who wants to increase the probability
of winning the mining competition. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge,
no mining pool claimed responsibility for any DDoS attack on mining pools till
now. A natural question arises about whether the mining pools would really
launch the DDoS attack on other mining pools.
Johnson et al. [14] responded to the above question by using the game theory.
According to their analysis, the relative size of mining pools is a vital factor for
the mining pool to choose the strategy between investing in computation and
engaging in attack. In particular, large mining pools have a higher possibility to
be attacked than small ones, and larger mining pools are more willing to attack
compared to smaller ones. In other words, two relative large mining pools would
like to launch DDoS attacks on each other. This analysis result is somewhat
different from the reality where the large mining pools are living peacefully.
In this paper, following Johnson et al.’s method, we would like to re-analyze
the DDoS attacks happened between mining pools from game-theoretic point of
view.
Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows.
– To reflect the fact that the current mining pools are usually equipped with an
anti-DDoS system, we add DDoS defence cost into Johnson et al.’s model with
the condition that the whole computing resource of any mining pool consists
of mining, defense and attack. This modification makes the failure possibility
of DDoS attacks dynamic and turns out some new game’s equilibria.
– With the new analysis model, we obtain some interesting conclusions. (1) If
the failure probability of DDoS attack is high, then mining pools would have
a greater incentive to stay peacefully. (2) Increasing the computing resource
in mining is always the primary choice for mining pools, no matter whether
they are launching DDoS attacks or under DDoS attacks.
Our presentation proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly discuss the related
work. In Sect. 3, we modify Johnson et al.’s model by adding defense cost and
operational cost, and carry out numerical and graph analysis with different fail-
ure probability of DDoS attacks. In Sect. 4, we further extend the analysis in
Sect. 3 by restricting the whole computing resource, and obtaining the failure
probability of DDoS attacks dynamically. In Sect. 5, we summarize this paper.

2 Related Work
Bitcoin’s incentive mechanism encourages miners to mine and disseminate new
blocks they have constructed to reap benefits. From the rational point of view,
miners always pursuit higher profit even if they have to deviate from the standard
mining strategy. This deviation strategy may even be a proactive attack on other
miners or mining pools, such as DDoS attacks. It is natural to analyze the DDoS
attacks and possible countermeasures from the economic point of view.
Many researchers have studied the problem by analyzing the characteristics
of adversaries. Liu et al. [18] developed a game-theoretic AIOS (Attacker Intent,
Objectives and Strategies) formalization to unify a large variety of attacker
intents. Li et al. [17] studied the botnet-related attacks such as the DDoS attack.
Their result showed that the profits of botnet masters and attacker can be max-
imized with the effective rental size and the optimal botnet size. Böhme et al.
[8] believed that DDoS attacks seemed to be particularly effective and difficult
to prevent in the Bitcoin system.
Analyzing the characteristics of the defense is another way to study the
DDoS attack. Spyridopoulos et al. [23] modeled a DDoS attack as a one-shot,
non-cooperative and zero-sum game, where the attacker can adaptively choose
his/her strategy according to the defender’s response. Their analysis result shows
that only if the attacker is rational, the cost of the damages due to the DDoS
attack can be minimized by a proper firewall configuration, no matter which
strategy the attacker chooses for the next stage. Karami et al. [15] explored the
facets of booters-based DDoS attacks by analyzing the leaked and scraped data
from three major booters. They showed that the payment intervention could be
a promising countermeasure to this kind of DDoS attacks.
The research on the incentive of adversarial behavior is one of our primary
concerns. Schechter and Smith [22] took the advantages of the economic threat
modeling to understand adversaries aiming at financial gain. Cremonini and
Nizovtsev [10] used game theory to compare the strategies the attacker used
to make decision in different scenarios. Clark and Konrad [9] proposed a game
model where only one defender and one attacker exist. They showed that the
defender would surrender if he/she needs to protect lots of nodes while the
attacker only needs to win at only once. Fultz and Grossklags [12] solved the
problem of strategy selection for attackers and cyber criminals. Grossklags et al.
[13] modeled multiple attackers, and found that attackers and defenders had an
impact on their inherent interdependence. Manshaei et al. [20] summarized the
game theory research on network security and privacy.
Due to the economic nature of the Bitcoin system, it is natural to use game
theory model to analyze the incentive of attacks. Vasek et al. [25] pointed out
that the possibility of becoming an attacking target was related to the size of the
mining pool. Accordingly, Johnson et al. [14] established a game theory model
with two participants, big and small mining pools. The alternative strategy is
investing in mining or launching DDoS attacks. They concluded that two rel-
atively large mining pools are more likely to attack each other. Laszka et al.
[16] established a model of two mining pools attacking each other and analyzed
570 R. Zheng et al.
the long-term impact of DDoS attacks with the migration of miners. Tang et al.
[24] argued that the win-or-nothing reward method may lead miners to behave
maliciously.
Besides the DDoS attack, game theory is also applied to analyze the other
attacks, such as block withholding attacks [11,19], in Bitcoin.
3 Modified Model from Johnson et al.’s Model
Before giving our proposed model for analyzing the DDoS attacks among mining
pools, we would like to present a modified model original from [14]. In this model,
we have two players, denoted as B and S, and we focus on the income of each
player. It is worth mentioning that the rest mining pools in Bitcoin system are
considered as an entity and denoted as R. We assume that the action of R will
not effect on the income of player B and S. In other words, the whole computing
resource of R is used for mining. If we denote B, S, and R as the computing
resource as B, S and R, respectively. We have that B + S + R = 1.
3.1 Theoretical Analysis
Similar with Johnson et al.’s model [14], we assume that the whole computing
resource in Bitcoin increases with a fixed rate ε over the game’s time. The
first option for each player in our model is to invest more computing resource
to maintain the market equilibrium, and the second one is to launch a DDoS
attack to decrease the other player’s mining resource. We also assume that DDoS
attacks will fail with a fixed probability σ. If one player launches a DDoS attack,
the player’s computing resource will no longer increase.
We would like to express the cost of mining, defense, and attack by using
computing resource, especially the ratios to the whole computing resources. We
denote γ, β, λ and η as the ratios of the cost of investment, mining, attack and
defense to the whole computing resource, respectively. We also assume that the
cost of attack is related to the computational power of the opponent, while the
defense cost is related to the player’s own resource.
– If player B chooses mining, then his/her investment cost, operational cost
and defense cost are γεB, β(1 + ε)B and η(1 + ε)B, respectively.
– If player B launches a DDoS attack on player S while player S invests in
mining, then the operational cost, defense cost and attack cost of player B
are βB, ηB, and λ(1 + ε)S, respectively.
For simplicity, we have that λ < γ. The payoffs for players B and S are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Best-Response Strategies. We denote MB(i, j) (resp. MS(i, j)) as the value in the
cell of the i-th column and the j-th row in Table 1 (resp. Table 2). For instance,
we have that
MB(1, 1) =
B
B + S + R
− γεB − ηB(1 + ε) − βB(1 + ε)

Hence, we have the following best response strategies for player B.
– Player B would invest in mining, if S also invest in mining and MB(1, 1) ≥
MB(1, 2), or player S chooses attack and MB(2, 1) ≥ MB(2, 2).
– Player B would launch the DDoS attack, if S invests in mining and
MB(1, 1) ≤ MB(1, 2), or player S chooses attack and MB(2, 1) ≤ MB(2, 2).
Note that when the equalities hold, both of mining and attack are the best
response strategies for player B. Similarly, we can get the best response strategies
for player S.
Equilibria. With Tables 1 and 2, it is easy to see that there exist four Nash
equilibria as follows.
– Both players launch DDoS attacks on each other, if MB(2, 2) ≥ MB(2, 1) and
MS(2, 2) ≥ MS(1, 2).
– Both players invest in mining, if MB(1, 1) ≥ MB(1, 2) and MS(1, 1) ≥
MS(2, 1).
– Player B prefers attacks while player S invests in mining, if MB(1, 2) ≥
MB(1, 1) and MS(1, 2) ≥ MS(2, 2).
– Player B prefers mining while player S launches attacks, if MB(2, 1) ≥
MB(2, 2) and MS(2, 1) ≥ MS(1, 1).

3.2 Numerical Illustrations
For clarification, we give the numerical illustrations for the Nash equilibrium in
this part. The values of ε, γ, λ, β and η are set as 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.001 and
0.001, respectively.
Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the characteristics of the Nash equilibrium for dif-
ferent values of B and S and different attack failure probabilities. The first one
demonstrates the equilibrium profiles of players B and S as a function of the
values of B and S1. The second one demonstrates the payoff of player B as a
function of the values of B and S. If there exist multiple equilibria, the average
value is applied. The last one demonstrates the payoffs of players B and S as a
function of the values of B and a fixed value of S.
Clearly, these three figures conduct the results in [14]. In particular, large
mining pools have a higher possibility to be attacked than small ones, and larger
mining pools are more willing to attack compared to smaller ones. These figures
also conduct that players are more willing to invest in mining when the attack
failure probability increases.

4 Our Model with Limited Computing Resource
In the previous section, we re-analyzed the equilibrium distribution as a function
of computing resource size with the operational cost and defense cost. However,
we observe that the pool may need to allocate his/her computing resource for
mining, defense or DDoS attack, when the whole computing resource is fixed.
The strategy equilibrium of players will be accordingly affected by this allocation.
In order to solve this problem, we will give a new model in this section.
The new model is almost the same as the previous model, except the following
modifications.
– The Bitcoin mining market in this model would not increase computing
resource over the game’s time scale.
– Players B and S have the same computing resource, and we set that B =
S = CBS.
– The computing resources of players B and S contain three parts: mining,
defense and attack. The attack part could be zero, which means that the
player does not launch the DDoS attack on the other. While the defense part
cannot be zero when he/she will launch the DDoS attack, and it is related to
the mining part with the ratio α. If one player prefer mining to attack, the
defense part could be zero.
– The attack failure probability σ is decided by the defense cost of the victim
and the attack cost of the attacker. Specially, σ = D/A, where D and A are
the defense cost of the victim and the attack cost of the attacker, respectively.
4.1 Theoretical Analysis
We use the subscripts m, d and a to denote the parts related to mining, defense
and attack, respectively. Hence, we have that
B = Bm + Bd + Ba = (1 + α) · Bm + Ba
= CBS = S
= Sm + Sd + Sa = (1 + α) · Sm + Sa.
574 R. Zheng et al.
Recall the operational cost ratio is β, we have that player B (resp. player S)
should pay the cost of βB (resp. βS) to keep him/her running. If both players
invest in mining, then the payoff of player B (resp. player S) is
Bm
Sm + Bm + R
− βCBS (resp.
Sm
Sm + Bm + R
− βCBS).
If both play players initiate the DDoS attack against each other, then Bd =
αBm, Ba = CBS−(1+α)Bm, Sd = αSm, and Sa = CBS−(1+α)Sm. Now, we have
that the attack failure probability of player B (resp. player S) is αSm
CBS−(1+α)Bm
(resp. αBm
CBS−(1+α)Sm
), and the payoff of player B (resp. player S) is
αBm

(resp.

If player B initiates a DDoS attack against player S who invests in mining,
then Bd = αBm, Ba = CBS − (1 + α)Bm, Sd = CBS − Sm, and Sa = 0. Now,
we have that the attack failure probability of player B is CBS−Sm
CBS−(1+α)Bm
, and the
payoff of player B (resp. player S) is
Bm

CBS−(1+α)Bm
Sm + Bm + R
− βCBS
(resp.

− βCBS).
If player B invests in mining while player S initiates a DDoS attack against
him/her, then Bd = CBS − Bm, Ba = 0, Sd = αSm, and Sa = CBS − (1 + α)Sm.
Now, we have that the attack failure probability of player B is CBS−Sm
CBS−(1+α)Bm
, and
the payoff of player B (resp. player S) is

Best-Response Strategies and Equilibria. Similar with that in Sect. 3, we can
conduct the best response strategies for players B and S, and four Nash equilibria
from Tables 3 and 4.

4.2 Numerical Illustrations
The players B and S are, in essence, the same in the game. Hence, in this
subsection, we only show the numerical illustrations of player B’s payoff. As
that in Sect. 3, the red portions in the figures in this subsection represent higher
payoff. The white parts in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 demonstrate that there is no Nash
equilibria for the underlying strategies. For example, from the point (0.05, 0.15)
in Fig. 4(a), we conduct that there is no Nash equilibria when both players B
and S invest in mining with Bm = 0.05 and Sm = 0.15. However, if we combine
the four sub-figures in each figure together, there would be no white region left.
The parameters of Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are almost the same, except with different
α. It is easy to see that when α increases, the colorful region corresponding to
strategies (mining, mining) and (attack, attack) enlarges. In Figs. 4, 5 and 6, if
the probability of attack failure is larger than 1, we set it as 1.
Figures 4(a), 5(a) and 6(a) show the equilibrium payoff of player B when
both players B and S invest in mining. The colorful region in these figures only
exists when the values of Bm and Sm are similar. Furthermore, the payoff of
player B increases when Bm and Sm increase, which means that Bm and Sm are
willing to increase their computing resource in mining when they both invest in
mining.
Figures 4(b), 5(b) and 6(b) show the equilibrium payoff of player B when both
players B and S launch DDoS attacks on each other. The size of the colorful
region in these figures is much smaller than that in other figures. Especially,
there exists only one tiny colorful area in Fig. 4(b). It is quite interesting that
the colorful region in these figures only exists when Bm and Sm are of similar
values and relatively large, and the larger the values, the more playoffs. This
means that even if both players B and S launch DDoS attacks on each other,

they are still willing to invest the computing resource in mining as much as
possible.
We have the following observations from Figs. 4(c), 5(c) and 6(c).
Observation 1. When Sm is smaller than some threshold value, the payoff of
player B won’t change no matter how Bm changes.
Observation 2. When Sm is higher than some threshold value, the payoff of
player B increases proportionally with Bm(≤ Sm).
Furthermore, we have the following observations from Figs. 4(d), 5(d)
and 6(d).
Observation 3. If Sm is fixed, then the payoff of player B is almost fixed no
matter how Bm changes.
Observation 4. If Sm increases, then the payoff of player B increases no matter
how Bm changes.

Now, we analyze the actions of players B and S if only one of them launches
the DDoS attack. Without loss of generality, we assume that player B is the
attacker. According to Observation 3 and Observation 4, the only way to increase
the payoff of player B is to increase Sm. However, player S increases Sm only if
Bm is large enough according to Observation 1 and Observation 2. As a result,
both players B and S are willing to invest computing resource in mining as much
as possible, when only one of them launches the DDoS attack.

5 Conclusion
It is a folklore that mining pools would launch DDoS attacks to other min-
ing pools. The previous research (e.g., [14]) also shows that relative large mining
pools are willing to attack each other by a game-theoretic analysis. In this paper,
we further extended the result by adding defence cost into the previous game-
theoretic model. Our analysis conducts some interesting results: (1) The prob-
ability of launching DDoS attacks is related to the failure possibility of DDoS
attacks. (2) Increasing the computing resource in mining is always the primary
choice for mining pools, no matter whether they are launching attacks or under
attacks.
In reality, the computing resources of mining pools increase gradually; how-
ever, it remains the same in our proposed model. This situation could be analyzed
by the evolutionary game theory. We leave it as the future work.
