Abstract:With recent advancements made in wireless communication techniques,
wireless sensors have become an essential component in both data collection as
well as tracking applications. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an integral part
of Internet of Things (IoT) and it encounters different kinds of security issues.
Blockchain is designed as a game changer for highly secure and effective digital
society. So, the current research paper focuses on the design of Metaheuristic-
based Clustering with Routing Protocol for Blockchain-enabled WSN abbreviated
as MCRP-BWSN. The proposed MCRP-BWSN technique aims at deriving a
shared memory scheme using blockchain technology and determine the optimal
paths to reach the destination in clustered WSN. In MCRP-BWSN technique,
Chimp Optimization Algorithm (COA)-based clustering technique is designed
to elect a proper set of Cluster Heads (CHs) and organize the selected clusters.
In addition, Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)-based routing technique is also
presented to optimally select the routes based on fitness function. Besides, HOA-
based routing technique utilizes blockchain technology to avail the shared mem-
ory among nodes in the network. Sensor nodes are treated as coins whereas the
ownership handles the sensor nodes and Base Station (BS). In order to validate
the enhanced performance of the proposed MCRP-BWSN technique, a wide
range of simulations was conducted and the results were examined under different
measures. Based on the performance exhibited in simulation outcomes, the pro-
posed MCRP-BWSN technique has been established as a promising candidate
over other existing techniques.

1 Introduction

communication, microelectronics, database, network, and so on. This is primarily because it is
extensively applied in a wide range of domains. It integrates many technologies such as computing,
sensing, and wireless transmission [1]. The physical target is monitored on a real-time basis via different

kinds of microsensors which in turn generate a huge amount of perceptive data at an unparalleled rate. Even
though the application scenario and positioning of hardware are distinct, the fundamental objective remains
the same i.e., to transmit, process, and collect the perceived data. At last, the users can obtain stimulating data
from the information [2]. Being a data-centric network, WSN faces a significant challenge i.e., data storage of
nodes which must be resolved. The user is more concerned about perspectives of data instead of the sensors
or the networks that contain the sensors. Moreover, WSN assists reliable and efficient data storage from
which access is possible under unreliable and heterogeneous environments. The research investigations
conducted about efficient storage of data, overcoming the constrained storage space, form a significant
area of research in WSN data management since energy and storage space of every node are constrained.
In hierarchical WSN, a sink node or otherwise a Cluster Head (CH), is widely employed in the
aggregation of the sensed data from Cluster Members (CM). However, the clustered routing protocol is
positioned for reducing energy consumption and network traffic [3,4]. Lower Energy Adaptive Clustering
Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is a traditional clustered routing protocol used for balancing the network
load and reducing the power utilization [5]. In case of hierarchical WSN, when CHs are in high level and
its data processing load gains too much of weight, the failure of high level CH might paralyze the entire
networks. Simultaneously, when a CH, specifically a high level one, is compromised and captured, it
breaches the data security of entire network.
Multi-hop routing technique is one of the significant technologies in WSN and is largely accountable for
the transmission of data gathered by sensors from source to destination nodes based on the approved routing
protocol [6]. But, the dynamic, open, and distributed features of WSNmake the multihop routing, susceptible
to different kinds of attacks. So, it severely impacts the effectiveness and security [7]. Conventional secure
routing systems are targeted by certain selfish / malicious attacks. Therefore, it could not be applied in case of
multihop-distributed WSN, since they are largely based on authentication mechanism encryption algorithm.
In dynamic and time-varying WSN environments, current routing schemes could not precisely differentiate
the malicious nodes. In certain routing algorithms, the routing node could not authenticate the routing data
released by other routing nodes.
Data security issues mostly come from security attacks [8]. Generally, a security attack is classified as
either internal or external attack intended towards WSN. Internal attacks include eavesdropping attacks,
decoding attacks and probabilistic jamming attacks. External attacks are targeted at compromised nodes
and its attack behavior includes discarding, tampering, forging, selective forwarding, and replaying of the
data packets. It is possible to prevent the external attacks by authentication, encryption-based digital
watermarking and other conventional security systems. On the contrary, this security system cannot give
protection against internal attacks. This is because of the fact that compromised nodes contain keys and
security algorithms [9]. Moreover, in case of resource-limited sensors, it is not possible to run the security
algorithm which has higher computation complexity. In hierarchical WSN, the data security is now
heavily increased in order to ensure the communication of sensed data which is secured with the help of
lightweight authentication / encryption systems. But, due to the unattended placement of sensors, no
efficient systems are in place for the prevention of compromise and capture of nodes. Thus, the internal
attacks are made at these compromised nodes which could not be avoided as well. Concurrently, when a
malicious node is selected as a CH, there is no assurance provided for both integrity and authenticity of
the sensed data in whole cluster. Fortunately, various researches have displayed that trust management
system is an efficient method to defend the internal attacks [10]. Furthermore, the trust values are adopted
from these trust management systems as significant factors using which a secure CH is selected and a
secure routing protocol is developed.
The current research paper focuses on the design of Metaheuristic-based Clustering with Routing
Protocol for Blockchain-enabled WSN abbreviated as MCRP-BWSN. The proposed MCRP-BWSN
1234 CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2
technique intends to utilize blockchain technology for shared memory schemes and optimal route selection in
clustered WSN. MCRP-BWSN technique involves two major processes namely Chimp Optimization
Algorithm (COA)-based clustering technique and Horse Optimization Algorithm (HOA)-based routing
technique. Besides, HOA-based routing technique utilizes blockchain technology to avail shared memory
among the nodes present in the network. In order to authenticate the superiority of the proposed MCRP-
BWSN technique, a comprehensive experimental analysis was carried out and the results were assessed
under distinct metrics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers the literature review, Section 3 provides the
proposed model, and Section 4 concludes the work.
2 Literature Review
The current section offers a detailed review on existing cluster-based routing techniques for blockchain-
enabled WSN. Yang et al. [11] proposed a trusted routing system with blockchain and RL algorithm to
improve the routing efficiency and security in WSN. A set of possible routing systems are provided to
obtain the routing data of routing nodes on the blockchain in order to make the former impossible and
non-traceable to tamper with. Reinforcement learning (RL) method is applied to help the routing nodes
vigorously by the selection of efficient and trusted routing connections. Sahay et al. [12] proposed a
layered IoT routing security method to analyze the susceptibilities with regards to every stage of the
routing method. The authors examined the way to leverage the inherent characteristics of blockchain so
as to enhance the routing security in IoT-Lossy Network Architecture (LLN). Then, a blockchain-based
architecture was proposed using an intelligent contract to generate real-time alerts that can effectively find
the sensors including the tampering of LLN configurational data.
Shahbazi et al. [13] proposed a blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR)
protocol for WBAN. Power utilization, throughput, and temperature increase were used as calculation
metrics to analyze the efficiency of ATEAR in data transmission. On the other hand, resource utilization,
transaction throughput, and latency were applied in the investigation of blockchain scheme outcomes.
Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmark tool, was utilized to assess the efficacy of blockchain method based on
memory, and central processing unit (CPU) consumption. Nguyen et al. [14] introduced a novel energy-
effective and secure clustering-based data transmission method from pervasive WSN, with RDA-based
clustering method using blockchain-assisted secured data transmission abbreviated as red deer algorithm
based clustering with blockchain (RDAC-BC). The clustering techniques perform CH election whereas
the cluster construction method is developed. If a CH is selected, blockchain-assisted secure data
transmission occurs between CHs and CMs.
Honar Pajooh et al. [15] proposed a multilayer blockchain security method for the protection of IoT
networks, when simplifying the execution. In this study, clustering idea was used to facilitate the
multilayer framework. K-unknown cluster was determined within the IoT network using the method that
exploits a hybrid Evolutionary Computation Algorithm, a result of combining simulated annealing (SA)
and genetic algorithm (GA). The selected CH is accounted for local authorization and authentication. The
execution of local private blockchain facilitates the transmission between CHs and significant BSs.
Dhurandher et al. [16] explored a decentralized and secure method in which a Proof of Work (PoW)
consensus method was exploited to propose a BDRP approach. In this study, the authors designed and
incorporated a routing protocol that utilizes PoW for routing process. The model was demonstrated for its
immutability in OppNet model. Blockchain promises distributed, transparent, and secure systems and
tamper-resistant ledger which altogether offer secure routing solutions for OppNet model.
In Awan et al. [17], a blockchain-based verification method was presented in which the identity of all
nodes is saved in the blockchain. Both private and public blockchains were employed for verification. SN
CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2 1235
was authenticated by private blockchain, whereas public blockchain authenticated the CHs. In the presented
method, the trust values were evaluated for the removal of malicious node. A secure routing was executed
based on the reliable nodes in the network. Wang et al. [18] proposed a light-weight blockchain-based secure
routing method for swarm UAS networking. The study leveraged a light-weight blockchain method to
enhance a secure routing for swarm UAS networking i.e., based on 5G NR cellular networking. Unlike
traditional routing algorithm, the presented approach used light-weight blockchain which can prevent the
malicious connection from attackers, identify the malicious UAS and alleviate it from malicious UAS.
Kudva et al. [19] proposed two stage detection systems in which during initial phase, the adjacent node
calculates the trust separately. Next, a consortium blockchain-based scheme, using authorized RSU as
validator, aggregates the trust scores for vehicular nodes. Later, based on the trust scores secured by the
adjacent node, the blacklist nodes present in the table get changed vigorously. Ramezan et al. [20]
proposed a novel BCR protocol for a network of untrusted IoT devices. Unlike traditional secure routing
protocols, where a CA is required to facilitate the authentication and identification of all the devices,
BCR protocols operate in a dispersed way without CA. BCR protocols utilize smart contracts to find a
path for data gateway or destination within heterogeneous IoT network. Some intermediate devices could
ensure a route from source IoT device to a gateway/destination device.
3 The Proposed Model
In current study, a new MCRP-BWSN technique is proposed to accomplish optimal route selection and
security in the clustered WSN. The proposed MCRP-BWSN technique primarily makes use of COA-based
clustering technique to choose the CHs from the available set of nodes. Then, HOA-based routing technique
is employed to derive an optimal set of routes to BS. At the same time, HOA-based routing technique utilizes
blockchain technology to avail the shared memory among nodes in the network. At the time of route
selection, the transactions are saved in the blockchain with an intention to share the status of network in
real-time environment. Fig. 1 demonstrates the overall working process of MCRP-BWSN model. The
details of the processes involved in these tasks are discussed in the following sections.
3.1 Design of COA-Based Clustering Technique
During initial stage, the nodes are randomly placed in the network. Then, COA technique is applied in
the selection of CHs and the clusters are constructed. COA is a new SI algorithm developed by Khishe and
Mosavi in 2020 [21]. Its instinctive backgrounds originate from the hunting behaviors of chimps. Chimp
performs a variety of activities based on the separation of labour to identification of the prey. In normal
COA approach, the chimp group is divided into four types such as barrier, attacker, driver, and chaser.
Amongst the four types, ‘attackers’ lead the population. The other three kinds of chimps support in
hunting and accordingly, the status gets reduced in a consecutive manner. The arithmetical method is
briefly determined as given herewith. Eqs. (1) & (2) are employed to update the location of the chimps.
X1 t þ 1ð Þ ¼ XAttacker tð Þ � a1 � dAttacker
X2 t þ 1ð Þ ¼ XBarrier tð Þ � a2 � dBarrier (1)
X3 t þ 1ð Þ ¼ XChaser tð Þ � a3 � dChaser

Xchimp t þ 1ð Þ ¼ X1 þ X2 þ X3 þ X4

1236 CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2
Whereas t represents the number of present iterations, the location of the chimps are upgraded based on four
kinds of location considered i.e., XBarrier; XAttacker; XDriver and XChaser. Vector d and dynamic coefficient a are
shown in Eq. (3).
a1 ¼ 2 � f1 � r1 � f1; dAttacker ¼ XAttacker tð Þ � m � X tð Þj j
a2 ¼ 2 � f2 � r1 � f2; dBarrier ¼ XBarrier tð Þ � m � X tð Þj j (3)
a3 ¼ 2 � f3 � r1 � f3; dChaser ¼ XChaser tð Þ � m � X tð Þj j
a4 ¼ 2 � f4 � r1 � f4; dDriver ¼ XDriver tð Þ � m � X tð Þj j

Here, the coefficient f gets non-linearly minimizes from 2.5 to 0 with a lapse of iteration. c ¼ 2r2 .r1 and
r2 denote arbitrary values in the range of zero and one [22]: m indicates a chaotic map vector. Assume, in all
likelihood that μ represents an arbitrary value in the range of zero and one and chaotic models are applied to
the location upgrading while l � 0:5, as expressed in Eq. (4). Or else, Eq. (2) is yet to be performed.

COA-based clustering method is derived at, in the presence of four fitness parameters namely, residual
energy, node density, distance to neighbors, and distance from CH to BS. The fitness parameters are given
herewith.
Residual energy: CHs carry out various procedures namely, sensing, collecting, aggregation and data
broadcast. Therefore, CHs utilize the maximum energy than another node. After that, it is important to
determine the Fitness Function (FF) which shares the load amongst all other sensors in the network. The
fitness parameters for effectual usage of network energy are given herewith.

1238 CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2
where, Re; Amge, and ni denote node residual energy, network average energy and the total amount of SNs
from the network. CHopt refers to optimal percentage of CH. The objective function f1 showcases the
ratio of every node residual energy and network average energy.
Node density: During intra cluster communication, cost is a vital parameter to improve the energy
performance of the network. The maximum node degree of the CHs results in effective network
efficiency and it can be determined as follows.
f2 ¼ max n CH1ð Þ; n CH2ð Þ; n CH3ð Þn CHj
� �� �8n ¼ 2 To 95; j ¼ 1 to 15 (6)
where n CHj
� �
implies the number of sensors in the range of jth CH CHj
� �
. The value of objective function f2
is higher for right choice of CHs and it is utilized based on reducing energy consumption.
Distance to neighbors: In intracluster communication, the sensor transmits the data to CHs. If the CHs
are reserved in a CM, then the sensors reduce the energy if CH is closer to the member where the nearby SNs
employ minimal energy.

where, nsr and dist CH ; ið Þ denote the number of sensors from sensing sequences and Euclidean distance
between the nodes and CH.
Distance from CH to BS: For effective CH selection, the distance between CHs and BS becomes an
essential function. This occurs particularly in case if the selected CH is distant from the BS and it utilizes
the energy rapidly. This scenario is estimated from the functions given below.
f4 ¼ 1

dist BS; CHið Þ 8dist BS; CHið Þ ¼ 1 to 70m; CH ¼ 1 to 15 (8)
where, dist BS; CHið Þ signifies the Euclidean distance between BS and the ith CH CHið Þ. The f4 objective
function statement should be minimized so that the selected CHs are not distant to BS.
Once f1; f2; f3, and f4 function parameters are estimated, the objective function named FF is defined as
follows.
F ¼ Maximize Fitness ¼ a�f1 þ b�f2 þ c� 1

(9)
where, a;b; c, and d are the weighted coefficients for f1; f2; f3, and f4 FF parameters, correspondingly. The
range of the weighted coefficient varies in the interval of [0,1].
3.2 HOA-Based Routing Technique Design
After CH selection and cluster construction processes, HOA is executed to perform the route selection
process. The main inspiration of HOA is the hierarchical organization of horse herds. Horses prefer to live as
herds. Since several animals live together as large groups, it is important and significant to determine a stable
hierarchical scheme or ‘pecking order’ in order to increase group cohesion and mitigate aggression. It is
often, but not always, a linear method. In nonlinear hierarchy, horse A might be superior to horse B,
which in turn is superior to horse C. However, horse C might be superior to horse A. Superiority is
decided based on several aspects and involves an individual’s requirement for a certain resource at a
certain moment. Therefore, it remains a variable all over the lifespan of herds or single animal. Few
horses might be superior throughout the resource whereas others might be submissive for each resource.
It must be noted that this is not a part of natural horse behaviour. It may at times be enforced by human
being upon horses to live together in constraint space and less number of resources. Sometimes, a
CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2 1239
dysfunctional social ability horse is also termed as ‘superior horse’. Once the horses form a herd, their
behaviour becomes hierarchical i.e., high ranking animal in the herd drinks and eat early. Herd members
at low status eat at later stages while at times, some may not also get sufficient food. In case of low feed
availability, high-ranked horses might have prevented the low-ranked ones from eating at all.
Horse herds have a superior mare/stallion and the hierarchical order of horse in a herd defines the priority
of access to the resources. The hierarchy of a horse in a herd is calculated by the primary stage of the
approach, considering its fitness value in that herd. Let us assume a herd of k horses and P denotes a
function
Herd ¼ H1; . . . ;Hkf g (10)
P ¼ Herd ! 1; . . . ;Kf g (11)
If fitness Hxð Þ<fitness Hy

If fitness Hxð Þ=fitness Hy

where x 6¼ y and x, yE 1 . . .Kf g then
P Hxð Þ � P Hy

x� yð Þ > 0 (13)
The rank of each horse Hx is determined as follows.
Hx � Rank of each horse ¼ P Hxð Þ
K
(14)
All the herds have a centre one which is equivalent to the weighted average of the position of horse from
herd. Thus, the weight is represented as the rank of horse [23]. The centre of the herds is computed as given
herewith.

The distance between the location of stallion and the center of horse herd ‘H’ is calculated by Euclidean

of HMP of D column and horse.

where N represents a standard distribution with mean zero and standard deviation (SD). HOA derives a
fitness value of every solution or route between the CHs and BS. The aim of HOA-based routing
technique is to determine the route utilizing less energy and at less distance. Fitness function can be
considered as a minimization function and is represented as follows.
Fi ¼ min REi � DISTif g (21)
where, ‘Fi’ denotes the fitness of ith population, ‘REi' is the energy needed for ith population and ‘DISTi’
refers to the total distance of ith route or population. In HOA, the existing routes between CH and BS are
initialized as primary populations. At the beginning, CH becomes a transmission whereas other CHs or
BS gets transformed into a destination. Therefore, the probable routes from CH to BS are defined as
follows.
Sol ¼ Pi; i ¼ 1; 2; � � � ;N : (22)
where ‘Sol’ signifies the initial population set, ‘Pi’ designates the i
th route from CH to BS, and ‘N’ denotes
the count of routes. The route comprises of distance and total energy as given below.
P ¼ RE; DISTf g (23)
where ‘RE’ denotes the remaining energy of node in the route whereas ‘DIST’ denotes the total distance of
the route. The standard deviation for RE rREð Þ is employed in the determination of value of uniform load

3.3 Blockchain Design as a Shared Memory Scheme
Blockchain is a group of blocks in which every block has four sections such as hash value of the prior
block, data about the transactions (ethereum, bitcoin), timestamp, and current block. Blockchain is
determined as a distributed electronic ledger and it can be employed in saving the transaction data
through different points. The transaction can be recorded by a cryptographic hash value and confirmed by
CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2 1241
each miner. It may possess the same values in comprehensive ledger and is made up of blocks of each
transaction. Blockchain provides the capacity to share ledger details in a protected way. Decentralized
storage is a basic characteristic in blockchain whereas maximal data could be transferred and recorded
from current block to prior block through a smart contract code. In LitecoinDB, Swarm, SiacoinDB,
MoneroDB, BigchainDB, and Interplanetary File System (IPFS), distinct features are employed in the
decentralized database. Fig. 2 illustrates the framework of blockchain.
Blockchain system depends on a ledger that keeps track of every transaction which is circulating in a
network. Therefore, a certain way is required to determine the nodes that are being transferred and
through which path they get transferred. This way, one can save the paths in real time, active,
transactions in the blockchain. In order to achieve this, the network nodes are processed as coins. To be
specific, certain nodes transfer a message from one source to BS and its ownership get influenced by the
source node. Initially, each node possesses a BS and all the nodes possess BS which are deliberated as
inactive [24]. In other terms, each node does not possess an active BS. Then, it asks the BS to transfer
the path node ownership to it. When the transactions are registered with blockchain, the nodes get
transferred via the selected route. Once the data is transferred effectively, to the BS, the transferring nodes
transmit back the ownership of the path node, to BS including itself. This is only to ensure that the
networks are notified about the peer, where the communication was completed. After this, such nodes are
discharged. They consider that a source node is capable of owning u nodes when u ≤ n.
Further, it is also considered that the node transmits on two channels. Initially, it is dedicated to path
claiming and the transmission of blockchain transaction only. Later on, it is developed to carry forward
sensitive information too. Primarily, they are attracted to succeeding channels that can be employed in the
Figure 2: Framework of blockchain
1242 CSSE, 2023, vol.44, no.2
transmittance of the message. Also, assume that all the intermediate nodes can be possessed, merely, through
a single source node whereas a source node can be possessed, merely by itself. Once a node senses an
activity, when it is possessed by another node, the last one waits for action, till its ownership is
transferred to the BS. Meanwhile, the node informs the BS, through primary channel, to add in the
waiting queue. Most of the waiting queues are dealt with BS. So, it is essential to prioritize the waiting
node. As already mentioned, this approach enables a good knowledge about the source node and the path
that they transfer over, at a certain point of time. The change in these numbers denote the number of
messages transferred through a node, because a node status gets altered merely, while it is in the path
where the messages are transferred

5 Conclusion
In current study, a novel MCRP-BWSN technique was proposed to accomplish optimal route selection
and security in WSN. The proposed MCRP-BWSN technique involves two major stages such as COA-based
clustering process and HOA-based routing process. Besides, COA and HOA techniques derived a fitness
function using different input parameters for effective CH and route selection. In addition, the
transactions are saved in the blockchain with an intention to share the status of network in real-time
environments. In order to authenticate the superiority of the proposed MCRP-BWSN technique, a
comprehensive experimental analysis was carried out and the results were assessed under distinct metrics.
The experimental results highlight that the proposed MCRP-BWSN technique produced significant
outcomes over other existing techniques. As a part of future scope, MCRP-BWSN technique can be
applied in mobile adhoc networks and vehicular networks.
