Abstract—Modern smart homes are being equipped with certain renewable energy resources that can produce their own electric
energy. From time to time, these smart homes or microgrids are also capable of supplying energy to other houses, buildings, or energy
grid in the time of available self-produced renewable energy. Therefore, researches have been carried out to develop optimal trading
strategies, and many recent technologies are also being used in combination with microgrids. One such technology is blockchain,
which works over decentralized distributed ledger. In this paper, we develop a blockchain based approach for microgrid energy auction.
To make this auction more secure and private, we use differential privacy technique, which ensures that no adversary will be able to
infer private information of any participant with confidence. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity at every trading node, we
use consortium blockchain, in which selected nodes are given authority to add a new block in the blockchain. Finally, we develop
differentially private Energy Auction for bLockchain-based microgrid systems (DEAL). We compare DEAL with Vickrey–Clarke–Groves
(VCG) auction scenario and experimental results demonstrates that DEAL outperforms VCGmechanism by maximizing sellers’
revenue along with maintaining overall network benefit and social welfare.

1 INTRODUCTION
MICROGRID technology caught attention of researchers
due to increasing demand of energy from renewable
energy resources. Microgrid is a distributed energy sys-
tem usually equipped with more than one renewable
energy resource that are used to generate green electric
energy without harming the environment. Solar, wind,
and biomass are commonly used energy resources by
microgrids [1]. One of the major purpose of such micro-
grids is storage of electric energy. This stored energy is
further used to benefit both the customers and utilities in
various ways, such as enhancing demand side manage-
ment (DSM) by dynamically adjusting prices of energy by
sharing load between microgrid and fossil fuel-based
energy system [2]. This stored energy is traded among
different consumers depending upon their demand. In
this way, a reliable energy system can be constructed that
will provide seamless and uninterrupted supply of elec-
tric energy.
An important phenomenon of microgrid is trading energy
mutually and with other consumers. This energy trading
leads to many advantages such as increase in revenue of pro-
sumers by supplying surplus energy to demanding custom-
ers. Energy trading phenomenon is not that simple, and it
requires critical decisions, such as what will be the trading
charges in accordance with per unit supplied energy? How
the specific buyers will be determined from a list of buyers?
Which seller to select from the list of sellers? How onewill get
maximum benefit/profit? How the complete network will be
profitable? These mentioned decisions are crucial and require
special attention before practical implementation of trading
model of microgrids. If we analyse the mentioned questions
critically, all these questions can be solved by developing an
efficient and optimal auction phenomenon. An efficient auc-
tion phenomenon results in increase of revenue and social
welfare to an optimal level in which every buyer and seller
gets some advantage of participating in auction [3], [4]. This
microgrid auction comes up with two critical challenges. One
is to carry out a secure, user-friendly, and transparent auction,
while second is to develop a game theoretic model which
enhances revenue and social welfare of auction mechanism to
an optimal level. In order to enhance social welfare and reve-
nue of the network, we enhanced Vickrey–Clarke–Groves
(VCG) auction mechanism and developed a new game-
theoretic auction. Second, to overcome the need of security,
we integrated blockchain technology with microgrid system
because of its tamper-proof nature [5], [6].
Blockchain-based microgrid auction provides a decentral-
ized and trusted atmosphere to buyers and suppliers inwhich
they can freely trade without the need of a centralized trusted
third-party. Despite of all these benefits, auction mechanism
on blockchain is not completely secure and is actually vulner-
able to certain privacy attacks. One such attack is inference
attack in which the adversary tries different combinations of
ask/bid in order to predict and get knowledge about the cor-
responding outcomes of auction [7], [8]. Another attack which
require special consideration while designing an auction
mechanism is the leakage of individuals’ private information

due to repeatability of auction. For example,microgrid energy
auctions are usually repeated after a certain interval of time,
thus, certain clues are always left over in form of historical
records which can further be used to infer ones’ private
information [9], [10]. Overcoming such issues become more
difficult in a transparent blockchain technology. Therefore,
we used differential privacy preservation strategy in our auc-
tion mechanism which ensures that presence or absence of
participant will have minimal effect over the outcome of the
auction. Thus, leaving no room for adversary to infer or
estimate about behaviour or any particular individual partici-
pating in auction.
In this paper, we propose DEAL, which is a Differentially
private Energy Auction for bLockchain-based microgrid.
DEAL not only maximizes revenue and security, but also
guarantees preservation of private individual information
along with protecting bid privacy. DEAL works over differ-
entially private VCG auction algorithm deployed over
blockchain-based microgrid scenario in which prosumers
and customers carry out auction in order to initiate energy
trading between them. We compare our results with VCG
auction used by the authors in [11]. The work in [11] evalu-
ated and proposed the use of VCG auction mechanism for
microgrids energy trading.
1.1 Related Work
Auction is a well-researched topic and plenty of work have
been carried out to implement and study auction behaviour
in different scenarios. For example, many privacy preserv-
ing auction approaches such as encryption [12] and ano-
nymization [13] have been proposed in literature to carry
out certain optimal auctions. Similarly, certain works are
available in which VCG auction is applied over smart grid
energy trading scenario to maximize its revenue [14]. More-
over, certain properties and criteria of differential privacy
have also been studied in literature to carry out a privacy
preserving auction [15].
However, to the best of our knowledge, no work that
integrates differential privacy with decentralized block-
chain based microgrid auction have been carried out in the
past. For more details over implementation of blockchain in
smart grid, we suggest readers to study [16]. Moreover, for
detailed analysis of privacy issues in blockchain and direc-
tions, we suggest our readers to consult [17].
1.2 Major Contributions
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
� We modify VCG auction mechanism for microgrid
energy trading in order to maximize revenue of the
network.
� We provide moderate cost, secure, and private auc-
tion mechanism for microgrids based over consor-
tium blockchain properties.
� We preserve bid privacy of individual participants.
� We develop DEAL algorithm to protect outcome
results of VCG auction mechanism from adversaries
and inferring attacks.
The remainder of paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2,we provide detailed description of core components
of our proposed strategy. Section 3 contains the functioning
and algorithmic details of DEAL strategy. Furthermore,
Section 4 discusses simulation results in a brief manner.
Finally, Section 5 concludes the article.
2 CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS FOR PRIVATE
DECENTRALIZED ENERGY AUCTION
In this section, the core system components for DEAL strat-
egy such as VCG auction mechanism, differential privacy,
and consortium blockchain for DEAL are presented.
2.1 VCG Auction Mechanism
VCG auction is generally referred as a sealed-bid multiple
items auction. In VCG, buyers (bidders) submit their valua-
tions in the form of bids for every item in the auction. The
allocations and payments are done by following specific
rules, mention hereafter, as allocation and payment rules
respectively.
2.1.1 Allocation Rule
The aim of allocation rule is to compute optimal set of bid-
ders according to items in order to maximize social welfare
along with generating a good revenue. The allocation rule is
defined as [18]
XðbÞ ¼ argmax
y2L
Xn
i¼1
biðyÞ; (1)
where XðbÞ is the formula for allocation rule of VCG auc-
tion, bi is specific buyer ID, y is the valuation of each buyer
(referred as bid). Here, valuations y belong to a specific dis-
tribution L, this distribution will be a set of number in
which buyers can bid their valuations. Getting values from
a specific distribution ensures that only buyers only bid non
negative bids. This distribution can further be adjusted to
set minimum or maximum bid value. This equation checks
all available bids for a specific item and allocates it to the
highest bidder.
2.1.2 Payment Rule
In VCG dynamic price auction, the payment that each bid-
der has to pay is calculated on the basis of “harm” his/her
presence causes to other participant bidders. It can be sim-
plified by saying as the difference between the accumulative
sum of bids of other bidders without the winner and the
accumulative sum of bids of other bidders when the winner
is included in the allocation rule [19]. This payment is also
known as “social cost”. In our blockchain-based VCG auc-
tion, the payments can be calculated as
PiðbÞ ¼ maxy2L

ðBÞwith winner i
: (2)
In the above equation, y� is the outcome of the winner
chosen in Eq. (1), j serves as iterative factor that iterates
through all the values except for winner i. It is worthy to
note that PiðbÞwill always yield a nonnegative socially opti-
mal number. In the above equation, part ðBÞ is the sum of
winning bids, while part ðAÞ is sum of valuations/bids of
all participants that would win if bidder i was not bidding.

This can also be termed as, the difference between optimal
social welfare of all participating players (if i is not the par-
ticipant) and welfare of all participating from the selected
result (in which i is participating).
Definition 1 (Truthfulness). Truthfulness is always a domi-
nant strategy in VCG auction. Moreover, the allocation rule
ðXðbÞÞ and payment rule ðPðbÞÞ provides maximum revenue
and significantly good social welfare if the bids are truthful. In
VCG mechanism, Revenue is the total finalised payment that
sellers will get at the end of auction mechanism. Furthermore,
utility can be termed as the difference between the valuation of
buyer and the hammer price (selected price PðbÞ after payment
rule). Similarly, the sum of utilities of all participants of auc-
tion is referred as social welfare, which will indicate the total
amount of profit that is generated in the market because of that
specific auction mechanism [20]. It is compulsory for an auc-
tion mechanism to have nonnegative utility for every buyer,
which means that no buyer will be allocated any slot with a
price more than its valuation. This positive utility ensures that
every participant is satisfied which in turn motivates other
agents as well to participate in the auction. The utility Ui of
VCG auction is referred as quasilinear utility, which is given as
follows [18]:
Ui ¼ SiðyÞ � PiðbÞ: (3)
In Eq. (3), SiðyÞ represents the true valuation of bidder i
and PiðbÞ represents the payment that specific bidder will
pay [21]. By substituting the value of Eq. (2) in Eq. (3),
we get
Ui ¼ SiðyÞ �

ðBÞbids withoutwinner i
:
(6)
In Eq. (6), part ðBÞ is a constant term, which is independent
of bid of bidder ðiÞ. Therefore, bidder i will not be able to
increase or decrease its payment by reporting a lie. The only
possible change that will take place by varying bidder i bid is
in part ðAÞ of Eq. (6), although this change will only have
effect of the value of combined social welfare. Hence, bidder i
will be keener to enhance term ðAÞ, which in turn will lead to
truthful reporting of valuation. It can also be said in a way
that lying or false bid will not change the overall outcome,
however, the utility of i depends upon its bidding. Therefore,
bidder i is not left with any other option except truthful
bidding.
2.2 Differential Privacy
The term “Differential Privacy” was first introduced by C.
Dwork in 2006 to protect the privacy of statistical data-
sets [22]. Differential privacy ensures that a result of an
observers’ query should not reveal too much amount of per-
sonal information about a particular individual present in
the dataset [16], [23].
Definition 2 (Differential Privacy). Amechanism F provides
ð"; dÞ-differential privacy protection for every set having an
output rangeV, and for any two neighboring datasetsD andD0.
Pr½FðDÞ 2 V� � expð"Þ � Pr½FðD0Þ 2 V� þ d: (7)
This mechanism states that for a particular output range V,
e" bounds the ratio between two probabilities. Similarly, if the
value of d = 0, then the randomized mechanism provides "-
differential privacy according to its strictest definition. How-
ever, ð"; dÞ-differential privacy relaxes the strict "-differential
privacy definition for certain events requiring low probability.
"-differential privacy is generally said to be pure differential
privacy, however, the form ð"; dÞ-differential privacy having
d > 0 is referred as approximate differential privacy [24].
InDefinition 2, the symbol " represents the parameter called
privacy budget, which further controls the level of guarantee
that differentially private mechanism F provides [25]. Smaller
value of " ensures stronger privacy guarantee, therefore in
practice, the value of " is usually set less than unity “1”.
The term sensitivity determines the amount of perturba-
tion which is required to protect the data from adversary.
Sensitivity will calibrate the volume/amount of noise for
the mechanism FðDÞ. It can formally be defined as follows:
Definition 3 (Sensitivity). Suppose a random query is given
to the mechanism Fð:Þ, then the value of sensitivity DFS can be
defined as
DFS ¼ max
D;D0
jjFðDÞ � FðD0Þjj: (8)
2.2.1 Laplace Mechanism
Laplace mechanism is basically based over addition of con-
trolled amount of Laplacian noise to the analyst query output.
The noise is calculated by sampling it via Laplace distribution,
in which m acts as a centre point and s acts as a scaling
factor [26]. The formula for basic Laplacemechanism is

be a dataset in a range R, the mechanism L is "-differentially
private if it adds Laplacian noise using the given formula on
the basis of Eq. (7) as follows:
LðDÞ ¼ FðDÞDF

A powerful method to execute differential privacy in a
game-theoretic auction is Exponential mechanism. In this

function), whichmaps input and output pairs to a utility score.

2.3 Consortium Blockchain for DEAL
The concept of blockchain flourished after the introduction of
Bitcoin in 2008 by S. Nakamoto [27], [28]. Generally, block-
chain is divided into three further types; private, public, and
consortium [29], [30]. In this paper, we use the third type
named as consortium blockchain, that is special type of block-
chain in which consensus is carried out using some pre-
selected nodes (energy trading nodes (ETNs) in our case). The
controlling nodes (ETNs) are authorized to mine a new block
in the network by carrying out consensus process. Major rea-
son behind use of consortium blockchain is to facilitate such
nodes which does not have high computational power. So
that, the nodes that cannot solve complex cryptographic puz-
zle can also take part in the trading process.
2.3.1 “Blocks” Data Storage Entity
Blockchain networkmaintains uninform record of transactions
in form of data storage entities named as “blocks” [31]. These
blocks are fault-tolerant, append-only, shared, and distributed
among all consensus carrying nodes of blockchain [32]. In
DEAL strategy, ETNs are the consensus nodes which are
responsible for addition of blocks in the network. A brief illus-
tration of ETNs, and their connection with microgrid, and
blockchain network is provided in Fig. 2. Mining and storing a
new block in the network require high computational power.
Therefore, we chose ETNs as authoritative nodes, which con-
trol the process of consensus. ETNs collect, handle, manage,
and audit their local transactional records. ETNs collect
records, audit them (with help of consensus), and then struc-
ture these records into blocks after encryption. Once a block
gets added in the blockchain network (through consensus
mechanism, defined hereafter), it becomes publicly accessible
to all blockchain nodes (i.e., microgrid users, sellers, buyers,
and ETNs), however, this record is tamper-proof, therefore
these nodes can only view the data and cannot change it.
2.3.2 DEAL Coin
DEAL coin is a trading entity for our proposed mechanism,
which is used to carry out trading, provide incentives, and
charge penalties to participating nodes. Each blockchain node
will have a cryptographic wallet to store and manage these
energy coins. Actual value of this energy coin can be con-
trolled by ETNs or can also be hard coded in the genesis node.
2.3.3 Consensus Mechanism
In this paper, we use proof of work (PoW) consensus algo-
rithm, which is also the backbone of Bitcoin technology.
Consensus nodes (also known as ETNs) are chosen by
mutual agreement between all participating nodes. These
nodes are not permanent and can be changed afterwards if
some node does not follow the legal rules.
2.3.3.1 Proof-of-Work Consensus. We are using PoW consen-
sus mechanism in our DEAL strategy because it ensures a
healthy competition among mining nodes and every miner
gets a reward after successfully mining a block. Moreover,
PoW is less prone to security attacks as compared to other con-
sensus mechanisms, because attacker require to control mini-
mum of 51 percent computational power in order to hack
complete network. In order to add new transactional record in
blockchain, all ETNs in the network will carry out consensus.
PoW consensus ensures the appending of legitimate data in
the blockchain along with a guarantee that there is no conflict
in the transaction and historical records of data [33], [34]. PoW
used for ETNs in our strategy is similar to themechanism used
in Bitcoin technology, in which a unique hash value is gener-
ated every time alongwith a certain puzzle for every newblock
that needs to bemined in blockchain. This specific unique hash
value serves as a link between the newly appended block and
the prior block in that chain. ETNs solve a puzzle (by finding
valid PoW) in order to mine a block in the network, and thus,
they do also competewith each other to add the blocks as quick
as possible. Similarly, this competition turns out to be in favour
the fastest ETN which gets rewards in the form of DEAL coin
every time a new block is added in blockchain. During consen-
sus process, an ETN audits the auction records, structure these
records in the form of a new block to verify the block from
other ETNs during the PoW consensus process.
Similarly, the microgrids with maximum contribution in
the network do also gets incentives in the form of DEAL
coins from their respective ETNs. These incentives serve as
a reward that will encourage more microgrids to take part
in the auction process and to contribute more energy to the
grid network. These rewards are given on the basis of
energy recorded by smart meter.
3 DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE AUCTION MODEL
In this section, we discuss motivation, system model, design
goals, and adversary model of DEAL mechanism.
3.1 Motivation of DEAL
The motivation of our DEAL strategy is as follows:
� Traditional smart grid auctions are usually carried
out via some intermediary of centralized auction
authority, which leads to lack of trust in the network.
Our proposed blockchain based DEAL strategy
ensures that every participant gets its fair share and
no intermediary can alter with auction mechanism.
� Conventional VCG auction is not inclined towards
maximizing revenue of sellers. However, in DEAL
we modified VCG auction to provide maximum pos-
sible revenue to sellers.
� Typical auction approaches does not consider any
privacy parameter and are prone to certain privacy
attacks, such as inference attack. In our proposed
DEAL strategy, we integrated differential privacy to
ensure bidding privacy of bidders participating in
decentralized auction.

3.2 Problem Definition
Problem definition of our proposed work consists of three
major points which are defined as follows:
� How to maximize revenue and utility of sellers and
buyers respectively in order to motivate more micro-
grid sellers to participate in auction process?
� How to provide a secure and transparent auction
mechanism?
� How to preserve true valuations of bidders in VCG
auction mechanism in order to protect their privacy
and trust?
3.3 System Model of DEAL
DEAL consist of three major entities, i.e., microgrids (inte-
grated with homes), buyer homes/buildings, and block-
chains’ distributed ledger. Microgrid can be a smart home
or a network of homes that are capable of producing energy
from different renewable energy resources such as solar,
wind, biomass, etc. Microgrids are autonomous and can
power the connected homes, and even surplus electricity
can be traded into the network. Each microgrid has storage
capacity where it can store its surplus energy which can be
used for trading or usage at the time of need. Similarly,
these microgrids are also connected with certain other
homes and building that are not autonomous and require a
continuous supply of electricity (which usually comes from
electric grid station). These buildings/homes can request
microgrids to sell its extra energy to earn some profit. This
trading leads to the formation of an auction strategy, which
is used to carry out a type of trading in which every partici-
pant will be happy and gets some benefits.
Traditional auctions are usually carried out using an
intermediary or centralized auctioneer. However, central
auctioneer has certain disadvantages and may cause trust,
security, and privacy leakages especially when using VCG
auction (discussed in Section 3). Here, the next entity of our
DEAL strategy comes over which is blockchain-based dis-
tributed ledger. As discussed earlier, blockchain is a decen-
tralized distributed ledger which ensures the correctness of
records throughout the network. This step is carried out
with the help of ETNs, which work as brokers to provide
access to buyers and microgrids in order to trade energy.
Each microgrid send a request to ETN about their excessive
electric energy along with minimum selling price. ETNs
announces the available amount of energy to buyers in the
network. Energy buyers then submit their bids to network,
and ETN carry out auction process and match energy trad-
ing pairs of microgrids and energy buyers. Nevertheless,
integration of consortium blockchain in microgrid auction
has solved certain security and trust issues, but due to its
public nature it also raises large number of privacy threats.
In order to overcome this, our DEAL strategy integrated dif-
ferential privacy protection strategy with blockchain-based
microgrid auction.
The dynamic nature of differential privacy ensures that
adversary may not be able to infer any private information
about auctions’ participants. Despite of public availability of
auction results, differential privacy is one of the most opti-
mal strategy which preserves auction privacy. Furthermore,
DEAL ensures the truthfulness and revenue maximization
of the network using VCG auction mechanism. In order to
make DEAL understandable for generalist audience, we also
developed a pseudocode based algorithm which is given in
Algorithm 1. A graphical illustration of our system model is
given in Fig. 1.
3.4 Design Goals
Previous technical works over microgrid auction, differen-
tially private auction, and blockchain-based auction consid-
ered certain problems on either topic individually, but none
of the work from past literature considered preservation of
individuals and bidding privacy in blockchain-based micro-
grid scenario using differential privacy protection. In order
to visualize DEAL strategy from truthfulness, privacy, and
social welfare perspective, we made a Venn diagram based
illustration, which is given in Fig. 2. Our developed DEAL
strategy has following design goals:
� Integrating consortium blockchain technology with
microgrid energy trading system by using ETNs as
authoritative nodes.
� Ensuring security during bidding by using crypto-
graphic encryption of blockchain technology.
� Maintaining a decentralized and distributed ledger
in auction to ensure transparency in the network.
� Achieving complete bid privacy and individual
record privacy using differential privacy so that
nobody may be able to estimate about future bids or
auction outcomes.
� Enhancing revenue and social welfare of auction
mechanism to ensure that every auction participant
gets benefit from participating in the auction.
3.5 Adversary Model
In DEAL, owners of energy buying homes and buildings
submit their truthful valuations to auctioneer in order to
carry out VCG auction. However, the value of a specific
energy slot is very private information in the sight of
buyers. Similarly, if someone gets to know the final output
prices of VCG auction, then it can easily infer the valuations
and bidding prices of winners and other bidders because it
is a sealed bid auction. So, revealing of valuations of energy
buyers will directly put these bidders at the risk of disclo-
sure of their sensitive information. Therefore, we aim to
protect this sensitive bidders’ information from different
adversaries within or outside the decentralized blockchain
network. Contrary to this, if bidders have a risk of leakage
of their valuations, then they will not report their truthful
valuations to the mechanism. Which will lead to the denial
of truthfulness of VCG mechanism, along with the reduc-
tion in social welfare and revenue of the auction. In order to
overcome all this situation, we propose a decentralized dif-
ferentially private auction mechanism that preserves the
valuations of bidders by using the concept of dual differen-
tial privacy as demonstrated in the next sections.
4 PRIVATE DECENTRALIZED ENERGY AUCTION
USING DEAL STRATEGY

4.1 Operation Details of DEAL
DEAL works over the principle of integration of differential
privacy inVCGauction operating over consortiumblockchain.
4.1.1 Parameter and Roles Initialization
In DEAL, each bidder and seller form a legitimate entity after
a formal registration over a trusted authority, i.e., smart grid
base station controlled by government authorities. During
registration, the agent declares that whether it wants to join as
buyer or seller. The assigned roles cannot be changed during
an auction process, and one have to re-register itself with a
new one if there comes any change. Once an agent joins the
blockchain network, it gets its public and private key to carry
out cryptographic transactions in the network. Similarly, we
use elliptic curve digital signature algorithm in order to carry
out cryptographic transactions in the network, as
demonstrated in [35]. Each agent in the network is identified
using its true identity, public key, and private key generated
by authorities. Moreover, in order to carry out transactions
and trade DEAL coins, agents do require x number of crypto-
graphic wallet addresses ðWADi;jÞ, which the agents ðAiÞ can
request to authorities after joining the blockchain network. In
here, i is the node identity and j is the specific address ID
within that wallet. The governing authority is responsible to
provide every agent with an appended list of public key, pri-
vate key, and wallet address (PBKi; PRKi; ½WADi;j�xj¼1). This
mapping list, especially the wallet addresses can be used to
carry out auction and trading after authorization by ETN of
that area. A memory pool, which is further connected to
decentralized distributed ledger stores the record of every
auction and transaction in the network. This record is uni-
formly updated over the distributed ledger via ETNs.
4.1.2 Collecting Bids and Pre-Requisites of Auction
After parameters and roles initialization, the next step is to
advertise the available energy slots and collect bids, which is
carried out by the use of ETNs. ETN collects the information
about available energy from all microgrids with respect to a
pre-decided geographical distance, this can also be distance
dependent and concept of Energy Internet can be used in
order to route energy in the most optimal manner. After-
wards, ETNs broadcast this energy to all available buyers in
the network. The buyers then check the available energy and
provide their responses back to ETNs. ETNs collects the bids
and carry out auction using our proposedDEAL strategy.

4.1.3 Carrying out Auction
Auction mechanism in the network is carried out using the
DEAL strategy, in which all available nodes participate, and
winners are determined in accordance with their bids and
available energy slots. As ETN has collected all the bids of
buyers, it carries out VCG auction and then modify it further
to enhance the privacy using differential privacy and maxi-
mize the revenue using our proposed methodology. The
detailed elaboration of DEALmechanism is given in Section 3.
Similarly, after a specific period of time, the microgrids that
have provided maximum amount of energy are incentivized
in the form of DEAL coins. Along with this, the ETNwinning
the consensus mechanism is rewarded with certain DEAL
coins according to the strategy.
4.1.4 Paying and Auditing Transactions
After completion of auction, all buyers pay the calculated
amount to microgrids through wallet address of the specific
microgrid. The buyers transfer DEAL coins from their wal-
let to the wallet of microgrid, which further collects the
amount and verify it by using digital signature. These digi-
tally signed approved transaction records are further sent to
ETNs for auditing.
4.1.5 Carrying out PoW Consensus
After a specific interval of time, ETNs collect all energy and
coin transaction records of their local network, encrypt them,
and then protect them by using digital signature. This
encryption and signature process is carried out to ensure the
accuracy, authenticity, and immutability of data. These trans-
action records are then combined to form a block like struc-
ture which do also contains the address of previous block in
the chain. Furthermore, ETN calculates the hash value of this
block over a random nonce value (e.g., x) to mine it in the
chain using PoW consensus. Consensus is carried out similar
to the method of Bitcoin consensus, in which timestamp,
hash value and Merkle root of transaction is used to
determine the hash value in accordance with difficulty, such
as HashValueðxþ PdataÞ < ConsensusDifficultyÞ [36]. The
speed of mining and block addition depends upon the
ConsensusDifficultywhich is a variable entity and is varied
accordingly by authorities to control block mining rate. In
our DEALmechanism, consensus difficulty is varied tomake
sure that every block gets mined at least after 10minutes.
4.1.6 Appending and Verifying the Block using
Consensus
The fastest ETN to achieve PoW becomes the leader of that
consensus process. This leader further broadcasts the com-
piled block to all authorizedETNnodes,which audit this block
to ensure the verification and mutual supervision in the net-
work. These ETNs broadcast their report in the network after
auditing the received block.After this, eachETNcompare their
result with the result of other ETNs in the network. This com-
parison result is further sent to the network along with the
signature of each ETN. The leader then does a statistical analy-
sis of data to ensure that there is not conflict in the block. If
the block is free from conflict, then the block is appended in
the blockchain network in chronological order. The total time
required to reach the consensus is 10 minutes, which is
independent of the size of nodes in the network [37]. However,
if there arises any conflict or any ETN disapproves the block,
then leader analyse all results in a comprehensivemanner and
broadcast the disputed block again to all ETNs for re-auditing.
After this, the same process is carried out again, and the results
are analysed again for all ETNs along with their ring signa-
tures. This correspondence between ETNs help out to reach
the compromisedETN,which is held accountable afterwards.

4.2 Functioning and Problem Formalization of
DEAL
In this section, we propose DEAL mechanism to carry out
differentially private d-revenue maximizing auction operat-
ing over decentralized blockchain network for microgrids
energy trading. The mechanism is used to determine the
winner, winning price, and system utility and revenue. The
detailed pseudo code based functioning of DEAL mecha-
nism is presented in Algorithm 1.
4.2.1 Preliminaries of DEAL
Microgrids. Microgrids send their available energy
slots, along with its time and available energy to auctioneer.
The energy slot vector for ith slot of total n number of slots
is Sn
i ¼ fSn
i jj 2Mg. The aim of every microgrid agent is to
maximize its revenue, and in order to increase its revenue,
the auctioneer solves a problem based over DEAL auction
algorithm. The combined revenue of microgrids is accumu-
lated at the end of auction in order to determine the total
revenue generation in the network. The aim of our DEAL
mechanism is to enhance the revenue so that more sellers
participate in the auction. The problem for revenue calcula-
tion sums up all payments ðPiÞ for m number of buyers, the
formula is given as follows:
Total Revenue ðRÞ ¼
Xm
i
ðPiÞ: (12)
Buyers (Homes, Buildings). Buyers analyse the avail-
able energy slots and place their bids for every slot in the
form of a bid vector for every buyer. It is a requirement of
VCG auction that the buyer has to bid for every available
slot, however, if some buyer does not bid for some specific
energy slot, then its bid will be counted as zero and that
buyer will never be allocated that specific slot, because the
utility of buyers always needs to be positive. Individual val-
uations of ith buyers in vector form Bn
i ¼ fbni 2 Ng are sent
to auctioneer which further processes these valuations and
carry out auction. The aim of buyers is to maximize their
utility, for which they have to solve the following problem:
Utility ðUiÞ ¼ argmax
Bn
i
ðBi �PiÞ: (13)
The above equation computes utility Ui of DEAL mecha-
nism for buyers by subtracting each bid Bi from the pay-
ment Pi for that specific buyer. The sum of all utilities of
buyers is called as social welfare of the network which is
denoted as follows:
Social Welfare ðSWÞ ¼
Xn
i
ðargmax
Bn
i
ðBi �PiÞÞ: (14)
Auctioneer. Auctioneer is responsible to carry out decen-
tralized differentially private VCG auction along with maxi-
mizing the network revenue and social welfare. In our
scenario, auctioneer collects the bids and energy information
from buyers and sellers respective and determine the winners
and winning price. After completion of auction, the auction-
eer does solve the problem to calculate total revenue and
social welfare of the network. Here, we formed a new variable
named as “Network Benefit (NB)”, which shows the accumula-
tive sum of revenue and social welfare of the network. The
aim of auctioneer is to maximize NB, in order to attract more
buyers and sellers to participate in the auction. The problem
for calculation ofNB is given as follows:
NB ¼

Eq. (15) computes network benefit by adding payment

ðBi �PiÞÞÞwhich is also given in Eq. (14).
4.2.2 Problem Formalization
In DEAL strategy, homes or building who require energy
act as buying entities, and the microgrid smart homes act as
selling entities. Sellers will submit their available energy
and time slots to auctioneer, which is advertised afterwards,
and the buyers will submit their bids after viewing the
advertised energy slots. After successful collection of bids,
the auctioneer will carry out auction using the allocation
and payment rule provided in Section 2. In further equa-
tions, “i” will denote the buyer number (i 2 n) and “j”
(j 2 m) will denote the seller. In order to proceed further,
we assume that there are “n” number of buyers
(i ¼ f1; 2; 3:::ng) and “m” (j ¼ f1; 2; 3:::mg) number of sell-
ers in the blockchain environment. Since we want everyone
to participate in the auction, we assume that microgrid sell-
ers will always provide the energy cheaper than the actual
energy grid which is controlled by government. Further-
more, we assume that the number of buyers is always
greater than or at least equal to number of sellers (n � m).
We further divided the energy trading into slots, which
demonstrates the exact time period at which the supply of
energy will be available, we denoted it with T
(T ¼ f1; 2:3:::tg). The slots can be decided by the mutual
agreement, for example there may be 24 hourly slots in a
day, or 12 slots of 2 hours, etc. Once the allocation and VCG
payment is calculated, the auctioneer further proceeds to
make the payments differentially private by using the reve-
nue maximizing DEAL algorithm proposed in this paper.
Finally, a matrix WM is formed which will indicate the
buyer id, allocated slot number, seller of slot, and the pay-
ment decided for that slot. The matrix will look as follows:

4.2.3 Differentially Private Pricing Strategy
One of the major purpose of DEAL strategy is to optimize
revenue of VCG mechanism while preserving the bids pri-
vacy. It is because in VCG mechanism, is one gets to know
about the actual price that a buyer is paying, and the adver-
sary has a complete record of prices from some previous
auctions, it can easily infer the private information of spe-
cific buyers, such as their private valuations for a specific
energy slot, valuations for specific time, etc. Therefore, to

preserve bid privacy, we use the concept of differential pri-
vacy in decentralized auctions scenario. In this section, we
start the discussion from part (2) of Algorithm 1. We assume
that auctioneer has calculated VCG payments and has
decided the winners of specific slots and only the calcula-
tion of final price is left Section 2.1. We use dual differential
privacy mechanism, in which we use both Laplacian mecha-
nism and Exponential mechanism to make our pricing strat-
egy more private. At first, the Laplacian mechanism collects
data from step (1) and calculates mean and noise scale (sc)
on the basic of VCG price (also called as base price). The
intensity of noise scale is controlled by the privacy
parameter "1 which in turn controls the amount of noise
generated by Laplacian mechanism. The formulas used are
as follows [1]:
m ¼ dv=2 (17)
sc ¼

ðsdÞ"21
2Nx

: (18)
After calculation of mean and noise scale, Laplacian mecha-
nism is used to generate a group of number in accordance
with noise scale and mean value. As discussed earlier, "1
controls the intensity of noise, and it can be varied to
increase or decrease the level required privacy. In this
experiment, we use "1 ¼ 1, but this can be changed depend-
ing up the demand and need of application. Afterwards,
Laplace mechanism generates a random number using the
basic differentially private Laplacian mechanism, which is
given as follows:

In above equation, we take Nx = 1 for single sample and
it can be varied according to sample size. Similarly, the
value of x is generated using the random Laplace mecha-
nism of simulation environment. After simplification, the
above equation can be re-written for noise calculation as

Once, the group is generated, we further generate the
final output group to be fed into exponential mechanism.
The final noise array is generated by appending all values
and adding the base price value to them individually using
the following formula.
~LPiðappendÞ ¼ bpþ LapðF;m; sdÞ: (21)
Here, our section (2) of algorithm completes up and the out-
put result is fed to section (3), in which Exponential mecha-
nism is used to decide the differentially private price of
energy slot. In this part of algorithm, the group size of calcu-
lated Laplacian price is used to determine the size of
probability distribution of Exponential mechanism. Two pri-
vacy controlling parameters are used in exponential mecha-
nism, one is Dq (also known as sensitivity), and second is "2
(also called as privacy budget). It is worth to remind that in
Laplacian mechanism, we used privacy budget value as 1
(varepsilon1 ¼ 1). However, in Exponential mechanism, we
will vary the privacy budget according to the experimental
setup. Similarly, the value of Dq also depends upon the
requirement of privacy and it can vary accordingly. Different
researchers calculate sensitivity via different methods, so it
depends upon the discretion of the researcher implementing
it up. An important function of Exponential mechanism is
00scorefunction½qð ~LP;PsÞ�00. The score function explains that
how good is the output Ps is for the given dataset LP . Simi-
larly, the choice of a good score function also depends upon
the requirement of application, in ourmechanism, we use for-
mal Exponential score function in order to carry out optimal
price selection using differential privacy mechanism. After
getting Laplacian price group, Exponential mechanism gener-
ate a probability distribution of the group prices using the
mechanism as follows [38]:
PrðFðMÞ ¼ PsÞ / expð"2:qðLP;PsÞ2Dq ÞP
Ps 02LP ðPsÞ expð
"2:qðLP;P 0sÞ
2Dq Þ
: (22)
In above equation,M ¼ ðq; LP; PsÞ.
After generating Exponential probability distribution, a
temporary price is selected using the random mechanism,
which is further checked for all the constraints such as the
selected price should provide non-negative utility, positive
revenue, etc. If the selected price fulfils all the requirements,
then the price is finalized and is considered to be selling price
(Pf ) that ith buyer has to pay for selected slot. As true valua-
tion of bidder is the base price which is used to determine this
differentially private price, so our proposed strategy guaran-
tees that price selection is completely random. This random-
ness ensures that no adversary can get to know the original
valuation of buyer/bidder. Therefore, DEALmechanism pro-
vides 100 percent privacy guarantee to participating bidders.
Theorem 1 (DEAL satisfies "-differential privacy). For
any two set of bidders’ valuations B ¼ ðb1; b2; :::::bnÞ and
B0 ¼ ðb1; b2; :::::bnÞ having a difference of only one valuation.
The output probability distribution of DEAL mechanism deter-
mined using Eq. (22) ("2 ¼ "). So, in accordance with the dif-
ferential privacy definition, for a similar output x, we get the
following result [38].

According to proof of differential privacy in [39], the

Keeping in view all above discussion, we can conclude that our
proposed DEAL mechanism satisfies "-differential privacy
condition.
5 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In order to evaluate the performance of DEAL, we consider
three parameters named as revenue (R), buyers’ utility
(BU), and network benefit (NB). We compare our results
with VCG auction used by the authors in [11]. In order to
carry out experiments, we use Pandas v0.24 and NumPy
v1.14 libraries over Python 3.0 and iterated our auction for
50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 buyers. In every auction simula-
tion, we took the data set of n buyers and n-1 sellers. We
generate output results by dealing with five different
parameters named as revenue, utility, NB, average utility
per buyer, and average revenue per seller. Furthermore,
one of the most important factor in differentially private
preservation strategy is the change in output by varying
value of ", which is "2 in our case for exponential privacy
preservation according to Algorithm 1. In our experiments,
we conducted auction by varying "2 at three different pri-
vacy levels such as 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5. Furthermore, we
assumed that the sellers will always sell their electricity in a
price less than the energy price from smart grid. This fur-
ther leads to two important points, (i) if the price of energy
is greater than the price of smart grid energy, then there is
no reason left for buyers to participate in auction as they
can simply purchase the energy at lower cost directly from
grid station. (ii) hence, buyers are getting energy at low cost
as compared to price of grid station, so the major objective
is to encourage more and more microgrid sellers to partici-
pate and this can only be done by maximizing their reve-
nue. The detailed description of auction, it’s functioning,
and privacy preservation according to selected parameters
is given below in this section.
5.1 Differentially Private Revenue Maximization
During decentralized energy trading, maximizing revenue
is the most important objective. Revenue is termed as the
total amount of cash collected. In our scenario, the total
amount that a seller gets after completion of auction is the
revenue of that seller, and the accumulated sum of all reve-
nues is the total revenue of our system. Furthermore, we
evaluated average seller revenue, which is a ratio that dem-
onstrates the average revenue a seller will generate if he/
she participates in the auction mechanism. In order to maxi-
mize revenue, we modified the payment rule of VCG mech-
anism and ensured that our differentially private auction
generates more revenue as compared to VCG mechanism.
The graphical illustration of outcomes of DEAL auction in
comparison with VCG auction is presented in Fig. 3. In
Fig. 3a, the graph demonstrates revenues of DEAL strategy
in comparison with VCG auction. We categorized graph in
two way, first one is the change of revenue with respect to
privacy parameter � and the second one is the change in rev-
enue by varying number of buyers/bidders. From " point of
view, a slight increase in the revenue can be observed when
value of " is varied from 0.01 to 0.1. However, the value of
utility does not really change when this value is raised to
0.5. Since, lower value of epsilon (such as 0.01) is
demanded, therefore it can be said that there is a slight
decrease in revenue with the decrease in privacy level.
However, if we compare these values with VCG auction
revenue, we can see a clear difference that DEAL auction
strategy outperforms VCG auction mechanism, because of
modifications made in the payment rule. Similarly, from the
point of view of number of buyers, it can be observed that
the revenue increases with the increase in buyers, this is
because the number of sales also increase with the number
of bidders. However, the clear difference between revenues
of DEAL and VCG can be observed even with the increase
in number of buyers. Another important parameter that is
normally used to determine the efficiency of an auction
mechanism is the average revenue per seller. We calculate
average revenue for all our scenarios and presented its
graphical illustration in Fig. 3b. From the figure, it can be
observed that revenue of DEAL mechanism always out-
classes the revenue of VCG auction. Keeping of view all the
discussion, we can conclude that DEAL maximized revenue of
VCG mechanism along with preserving the privacy of bidders.
5.2 Buyers Utility
Enhancing utility of buyers and having non-zero utility is
also an important objective of any auction mechanism. In
DEAL mechanism, we ensured that no should have nega-
tive utility and the level of satisfaction or social welfare is

nue per buyer.

always positive. Similarly, in our scenario, revenue and util-
ity are linked with each other as revenue is the degree of
happiness of sellers and utility is the degree of satisfaction
of buyers. So, there is always a trade-off between both of
them. However, we tried to enhance the revenue of buyers
along with not decreasing utility to a larger extent. The pay-
ment values are selected using differential privacy Lapla-
cian and Exponential distribution, and thus, this payment
ensured that the revenue always gets maximized, therefore
the slight decrease in utility can be observed in our simula-
tion results as compared to VCG mechanism. The detailed
graphs showing the auction utility is given in Fig. 4.
Graph in Fig. 4a demonstrate the trend of utility with
respect to variation in privacy parameter (") and number of
buyers. It can be observed that utility value increases with the
increase in number of buyers, because it is the accumulative
sum of all utilities. However, the privacy parameter has varied
effect over utility values. For example, the value of utility with
100 buyers ismaximumwith " = 0.1, same goeswith other pre-
sented graphs as well. This is because the trade-off between
revenue and utility supports the utility maximization at " =
0.1. However, from the presented graphs, we can visualize
that if we decrease the value of ", we will increase the level of
privacy, but utility will decrease. Similarly, in Fig. 4b, the aver-
age utility per buyers also demonstrates the similar output and
ensures that the level of socialwelfare of buyers is always satis-
factory. This utility is actually the buyers’ utility also named as
social welfare, so it should not be mixed with the usefulness
(utility) of data which is usually referred in differential privacy
papers. In DEAL, the utility reflects the level of satisfaction of
buyers according to their valuation and payment, and it
should not bemixedwith the privacy value or data usefulness.
By viewing all graphs, it can easily be concluded that DEAL provides
satisfactory utility ratio for all its bidders and encourages bidders to
participate in auction because of non-negative utility.
5.3 Network Benefit
We introduced a new parameter named as network benefit.
The value of network benefits is the sum of total revenue
and utility of the network in that particular scenario. We cal-
culated the network benefit of VCG and DEAL auctions for
different buyers and different privacy preservation scenar-
ios. The graph showing the comparison of network benefit
is provided in Fig. 5. It can be seen from the graph that the
value of network benefits is exactly the same for both DEAL
and VCG auction. This shows that the overall performance
of DEAL is equal to optimal VCG mechanism. Though, the
trade-off between revenue and utility is adjusted because of
the requirement of maximizing of revenue. Besides, DEAL
mechanism also ensures bid privacy by using modern dif-
ferentially private privacy preservation. However, basic
VCG mechanism in the presented paper do not ensures the
privacy of bids and any adversary can infer private informa-
tion of buyers by analysing winning price and comparing it
with previous data. Furthermore, DEAL also provides
decentralized energy trading that ensures the security and
transparency in auction mechanism, which further increases
the trust of participating agents. By analysing all graphical
values from perspective of participants, it can be concluded that
DEAL outperforms VCG mechanism by maximizing auction rev-
enue along with enhancing utility and overall network benefit.
5.4 Privacy Analysis
Final price in DEALmechanism is picked by dual differential
privacy mechanism; first random string is generated using
Laplace differential privacy and afterwards, exponential
privacy protection mechanism is used to pick a completely
random price according to chosen distribution. In order to
carry out privacy analysis, we thoroughly compared
randomly picked price with theoretic bounds of differential

theoretical implications of differential privacy and is one of the most
suitable mechanism to preserve bidding privacy for microgrids
auction.
6 CONCLUSION
Microgrids are capable of generating, storing, and distribut-
ing energy to the network in the time of need using solar,
wind and similar renewable energy resources. Usually
microgrids produce more than the required amount of
energy and trade the surplus energy in order to generate
some profit. This trading works in accordance with the rules
provided by governing authorities. The trading is not
completely secure and private; therefore, researchers are
working over formulation of latest technologies to make it
more efficient. Nowadays, modern trading technologies do
also discuss the use of blockchain in trading due to its
decentralized, timestamped, transparent, and immutable
nature. However, blockchain in not an all one solution to all
auction/trading problems as it can easily cause leakage of
because of its transparent nature. In this paper, we propose
a decentralized auction strategy for microgrid energy trad-
ing and preserved bid privacy by using differential privacy
protection operating over consortium blockchain technol-
ogy. To be more precise, we develop Differentially private
Energy Auction for bLockchain-based microgrid systems
(DEAL) mechanism, which preserves the privacy of partici-
pants of auction by effectively preserving the data using
Laplacian and Exponential privacy protection. We further
evaluated DEAL in different auction scenarios and com-
pared it with optimal VCG auction mechanism. The results
from experimental evaluations show that DEAL outper-
forms VCG mechanism by providing maximizing revenue
and enhancing utility and network benefit to a satisfactory
level. As a plan of our future work, we intend to develop a
prototype of decentralized private auction with the help of
DApp platform and smart contract.
