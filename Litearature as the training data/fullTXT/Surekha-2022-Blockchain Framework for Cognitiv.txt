ABSTRACT The incorporation of technology in healthcare and hospital management has given a new per-
ception to themedical procedures, and drugmanagement for patient-centric care. Emerging technologies like
blockchain, Internet of Things, and cognitive computing are most adaptable for designing smart healthcare
systems. However, due to the diversified tasks involved, a design approach with broader understanding
involving multiple factors that represent each area of the healthcare is the need of the hour. Game theory
has gained prominence in modeling multi-player problems designated by strategic interdependency. This
paper proposes a non-cooperative game strategy between players (stakeholders) to inspect how rationality
is exhibited among the players who seamlessly try to get benefitted from the actions of other players.
To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype was designed based on Ethereum permissioned
blockchain employing Raspberry pi IoT devices and sensor-based cognition. Use of blockchain brings in
trust, security and transparency to the system. The simulation results show that the proposed model provides
better outcomes in terms of latency (≈15 min), throughput and scalability with an increased number of
transactions. The comparative analysis elucidates the fact that the proposed method outperforms the existing
healthcare systems with a significant improvement of 10-15% in terms of resource utilization and provides
faster and accurate patient-centric services.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cognitive computing is a self-learning framework that recre-
ates the human perspectives using automated models. Atten-
tion, language, learning, memory, perception and thought are
the processes that fall under cognition. Cognition computing
can offer both hardware and software services. Technologies
such as natural language processing, deep learning, context-
aware processing and query-based methods are widely used
in cognition. Applications such as virtual nursing assistant,
fraud detection, and risk assessment are the most commonly
used ones based on cognitive computing. Healthcare is one
of the vital domains to maintain or restore human health.
Pandemics like COVID-19 has resulted in rapid changes in
the health care systems and has put an excessive burden on
them. The policy-makers are trying to take the healthcare
system to new frontiers for the betterment of the people who
access it.
The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and
approving it for publication was Mansoor Ahmed .
Cognition in healthcare can provide intelligence to the
emergency or life-support medical equipment with the help
of sensors. They support monitoring of patient’s body vital
parameters either from bedside or from remote location. For
example, a drop in the oxygen level in the patient body can
immediately trigger a signal to turn on the oxygen supply.
With cognition, useful information from medical records or
healthcare monitoring devices can be effectively captured.
All the structured and unstructured data related to healthcare
can easily be analyzed and the relationship between the data
and patients correlated so that effective treatments could be
devised.
Data security and privacy is a huge concern in the health-
care data networks. Complex data encryption algorithms
require heavy processing and memory. Since, IoT devices
are constrained in terms of processing speed, memory and
power, accommodating heavyweight encryption algorithms
on such devices is not feasible. Patient-centric treatments,
payments processing, treatment-based billing, administration
cost reduction and insurance claim processing are major

hurdles in healthcare sector that require immediate attention.
Since healthcare requires interaction among different entities
involved in the process, a strong coordination and trust is
required between these entities. Game theory is useful to
understand the interactions among stakeholders (players) in
action. It provides sustainable gains to the players and reduces
administration costs. This paper focuses on creating a trusted
platform using blockchain wherein sensor-based cognition
is used to identify changes in a patient’s body and trigger
corresponding medical services. IoT devices can store data
with ensured privacy. The whole process inside the system is
transparent and game theory-based strategies help in achiev-
ing the best possible outcomes for all the stakeholders in the
system.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
discusses the relative works. In section III, the strategic game
design, queuing and trafficmodels for patients are elaborated.
In section IV, the hardware and software-based results are
evaluated and major advantages of the proposed models are
discussed and comparisons are drawn between the exist-
ing and proposed works. Section V provides the conclusive
remarks.
II. RELATED WORKS
A comprehensive investigation of cognitive computing is
proposed in [1]. Various evolutionary stages of cognitive
computing for human-centered and cloud-assisted comput-
ing are described. The major aspects related to cognitive
system architecture namely networking, analytics and cloud
computing are elaborated with reference to human-centered
cognitive applications. Cognition is an important component
in building mash-up applications where data from multiple
sources are combined into a single application that supports
new services. A centralized mash-up service for environmen-
tal monitoring using cognition is presented in [2]. An Internet
of Multimedia Things (IoMT) application is developed to
detect hazardous patterns using wavelet transforms. Internet
of Things (IoT) [3] has been used widely in providing many
intelligent applications, such as smart cities, smart agricul-
ture, smart environmental monitoring and smart healthcare.
However, due to the increased IoT applications globally,
optimized access control, efficient information processing
and sharing is the need of the hour. Adaptation of IoT
devices into the new intelligent system is a challenge. The key
challenges related to the incorporation of cognition in IoT,
security and privacy issues and key infrastructural details are
elaborated in [4]. An ankle surgery monitoring system using
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed
in [5]. This system monitors ankle features after surgery and
uses cognition derived from deep learning algorithm-based
classifications. Sensors play a vital role in the cognition-
based architectures. A cognition module can be developed
using sensors, such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), to pro-
vide state-of-the-art monitoring system for healthcare [6].
Protocols mentioned in [7] can help in identifying data loss
inside the network. Efficient transmission mechanisms are
essential in cognitive IoT networks to improve the throughput
and reduce packet delays and losses [8]. Communication
technology, security and privacy are of a huge concern in
the IoT networks. The devices used in IoT networks have
limited memory and processing capabilities and are battery
operated. As such, powerful encryption algorithms cannot be
implemented. Since the devices are heterogeneous; the use of
common communication protocols between different device
networks is not possible. Blockchain [9] is a powerful tech-
nology that has the potential to provide security for sensitive
data networks, such as banking and healthcare [10].
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and trustwor-
thy platform technology that records transactions which are
immutable and shared amongst legitimate users. The infor-
mation stored on the blockchain is updated regularly and
all the nodes in the blockchain can view this. Scalability
is a major constraint in the blockchain-based healthcare
systems. By carefully optimizing the storage mechanisms
and redesigning the blockchain, scalability of the overall
system can be improved [11], [12]. Shard-based transactions
processing, wherein the transactions are split among multiple
committees, will increase the transaction throughput and
scalability of the blockchain because of the parallel transac-
tions processing. However, the processor strategic behavior
is one aspect that needs to be addressed during modeling
of such systems. A non-cooperative game strategy-based
incentive mechanism is designed in [13] to enforce
cooperation amongst processors for optimal incentive dis-
tribution. Blockchain can be used for efficient spectrum
management when integrated with IoT based healthcare
system [14]. The header generation time, block prepa-
ration time, data duplication and approximation errors
can be reduced by using edge-based decoupled healthcare
blockchain [15]. Supply chain management in healthcare is
vital for effective functionality and provides cost-benefits,
vendor’s selections and volume discounts. Blockchain-based
supply chain management provides economical and feasible
solutions [16]. Blockchain based insurance processing can
assess potential high-risk and low-risk patients to determine
the insurance rates transparently [17]. Cognition in IoT is
not a new science and finds many applications [18], [19].
Incorporating game theory in cognition based IoT health-
care systems improves the performance of the healthcare
system [20].
Over the last couple of years, various game strategies were
developed to enhance security aspects, network performance,
and energy efficiency in the healthcare domain [21], [22].
Blockchain provides a transparent and trustworthy platform
for transaction management and secure data sharing among
different stakeholders of the healthcare platform, while cog-
nition using IoT devices provides patient’s critical data using
sensors and provides knowledge about the processes at the
patient’s end without human intervention. Blockchain based
game theory approaches provide trust amongst the players
and immutable record keeping of every event inside the
blockchain. Game theoretical approaches also improve the

incentive mechanisms and allow other technologies such as
IoT to work in conjunction with blockchain [23].
Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) provides real-
time medical data. A two-stage task and priority-based
resource allocation scheme based on game theory is proposed
in [24]. Game theory also finds applications in mitigating
the interference caused by multiple WBANs [25]. In situ-
ations such as COVID-19, where there is a rapid growth
in the demand for hospital, game theory-based solutions
can become handy [26]. Priority-based local data process-
ing unit (LDPU) systems for critical and emergency care
is proposed in [27]. Parameters such as urgency, priority
are used to allocate the transmission slots for the LDPUs.
Clustering in WBANs improves scalability and game theory-
based clustering helps in better scalability with improved
power utilization [28]. Cooperative or non-cooperative game
theorymodels can be employed to control the communication
between the peers in the WBANs and behavioral models can
be analyzed for better controllability [29]. Blockchain based
biomedical applications continue to emerge with the increase
in demand for data privacy and security [30]. With decentral-
ized systems and edge nodes, the ever-growing data from the
IoT networks can be managed [31]. A proof of concept devel-
oped in [32] provides a model with off-loading provision to
decrease the on-chain process and improve overall scalability
of a healthcare system. COVID-19 has changed the lives
and living styles of people in many ways. Management of
electronic medical records, sharing among different entities
while preserving privacy and security is challenging. In [33],
authors demonstrate a model that provides a transparent,
secured and privacy preserving data sharing and communi-
cation platform using blockchain. The impact of resource
utilization on the system performance is demonstrated
in [34], [35].
The transaction processing capacity and thereby the
throughput of the blockchain network is the major issue that
limits the scalability and performance of the blockchain. The
major challenges associated with IoT and blockchain based
healthcare systems that are yet prevailing are:
1. Data Privacy and security: The data stored inside
the blockchain is tamper-proof. However, other nodes
inside the chain can still have access to this data which
is a threat to the privacy of the user.
2. Transparency: The medical processes are complex
and require coordination between various entities of
the healthcare systems. There should be transparency
at levels including treatment, medication, billing and
insurance claiming processes.
3. Interoperability: Due to the device heterogeneity inside
the IoT networks, the interoperability is a concern.
4. Access Control: Most of the works provide access to
legitimate users using encryption and decryption pro-
cess. Such process is expensive on blockchain platform.
Also, key distribution is another problem.
5. Denial/Delay in Insurance Claims: Due to the differ-
ences between the actual costs and billed costs or due
to the use of unwanted medical processes, the insurance
claims may be denied and delayed.
The proposed system addresses the challenges associated
with the blockchain based approaches. A novel game
theory-based model is designed with the objective of pro-
viding scalable, secured, and efficient patient-centric smart
healthcare platform using blockchain, cognition and IoT tech-
nologies. Use of game theory in the healthcare helps to model
strategies among the different entities such as patient, doctor,
insurance companies and hospitals where actions of individ-
ual entities affect the actions of others. Non-cooperative game
theory incorporates competition into the system wherein
every player in the system autonomously strives to maximize
his payoff abiding to the strategies formulated thereby provid-
ing the best possible outcomes. IoT devices deployed on-site
collect patient body vital parameters and blockchain provides
a trusted platform for data storage and to facilitate interac-
tions amongst different stakeholders. The contributions of
this paper are:
1. To design and develop a non-cooperative game-theory
based strategy for various players in the healthcare
sector in such a way that all the players compete with
each other using a non-cooperative game strategy to
maximize his benefits.
2. To model a secured and trustworthy platform
using blockchain for immutable data storage using
lightweight smart contracts-based access control for the
patient’s data.
3. To ensure ensures faster claims as all the records are
readily available and are tamper-proof.
4. To design and evaluate the performance of the complete
system prototype built using embedded processor based
IoT devices and Ethereum-based blockchain platform.
III. METHODOLOGY
Figure 1. illustrates the overall processes involved in the
proposed model. While developing game theory models for
healthcare, most of the attention is paid towards develop-
ing quantitative relationships between a set of variables and
corresponding outcomes. In the proposed healthcare model,
a chain consisting of a group of hospitals, a group of insurance
companies (insurers) and a group of patients is considered.
The strategy adopted is non-cooperative, meaning that the
players in the game are competitive and try to maximize their
own profit. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a common
term used for IoT device networks in medical applications.
Each patient that joins into the system is allotted an iden-
tification number (PID) which is unique. The patient-end
devices are connected through wireless networks, such as
Wi-Fi and can access the healthcare system. All the data from
the IoT devices is collected by a central processing module
which runs on a high-end processing machine. The central
processing module is responsible for managing the different
participation groups. It manages the three different groups
present in the system and performs adding, deleting and

report generation tasks. Rankings to hospitals and insurance
companies are based on the reports generated by blockchain.
Every event in the system, such as patient admit, medica-
tion, bill processing, insurance claiming, claim processing,
bill settlements, are recorded in the blockchain as a transac-
tion. Since the platform is immutable, transparency can be
maintained throughout the system. The performance of the
healthcare management in terms of patient arrival, departure
and resource utilization can be best assessed using queuing
and traffic models. In this section, queuing and traffic models
along with the game theory-based strategy are elaborated.
The queuing models can be used to model the objects that
seek entry and exit into the system and traffic models are
used to analyze the transactional events. Following this, the
technology used in the system implementation is detailed.
A. QUEUING AND TRAFFIC MODELING
The queuing and traffic models usually concentrate on under-
standing wait time and locating the points of congestion
within the system. To develop the queuing and traffic models,
the pattern in which the objects enter into and exit from
the system are to be identified. The M/G/1 model proposed
by Kendall [36] is apt for a generalized healthcare system.
The state of the system at time t is represented as {M (t),
t ≥ 0} process and X (t) represents the service time. The
arrival times and service times of the objects are stochas-
tic and Poisson distributed represents the probability of
a series of consecutive independent events. In this case,
pn = dn = an, where pn is the probability of n number
of objects existing in the system, an and dn are the number
of objects arriving at and departing from the system. With
the Poisson distribute input processes arriving at a rate λ and
service times independently and identically distributed with

where r is the arrival rate, s is the service rate and kM = σ
is the drop-off rate and k is the drop-out proportion. If r > s,
then length of the queue will grow and as M increases, drop-
off rate increases. This differential equation (9) has a solution
given by

where M0 represents the number of individuals in the queue

For each individual object/process P in the system, the wait
time is given by
WP = tqout − tqin (11)
The size of the wait list in front of the individual P at
time t is denoted by Q(t) which satisfies (11) when time t
is confined to the interval tqin ≤ t ≤ tout .

This is a closed form solution for the total waiting time of
P when the length of the waiting time during its entry into the
queue is known.
B. GAME THEORETIC APPROACH
A strategic game model is developed in this paper to provide
an interactive and cost-effective healthcare system. Game
theory can be an apt solution-provider to non-cooperative
behavior in healthcare thereby providing mutual benefits to
the stakeholders. Game theory-based strategy is represented
using a tuple G = 〈I , Si∈I ,Ui∈I 〉 where I = {1, 2, . . . I }
is a finite set of players and S is a set of strategies/actions
for each player and U represents the utility/pay-off function.
The pay-off function maps a strategy to a real number. Nash
equilibrium, also known as strategic equilibrium, specifies
a strategy for each player in such a way that each player’s
FIGURE 2. Workflow model between three players in the proposed
system.
FIGURE 3. Strategic diagram of the proposed model.
strategy yields the player at least as high a payoff as any
other strategy of the player, given the strategies of the other
player. In general, utility function ui for a player i, a strategy
si ∈ Si yields best response to s−i(s−i indicates set of players
except i) if and only if
ui
(
si(Best Response), s−i
)
≥ ui (si, s−i) ∀si ∈ Si (15)
If (1) is true for all s−i, then it is called as dominant strat-
egy. Figure.2. shows the workflow and Figure.3. gives the
strategic relationships amongst the three players (Patient,
Hospital/Healthcare service, Insurer) in the proposed model.
Patients have the option of choosing any hospital or insurance
agent, while the insurer tries to cover maximum medical
needs of the patient through their services which are sub-
ject to change over the course of time. Hospitals provide
charge-based medical services and the amount is collected
from either patients or claimed from the insurance companies.
Table 1 lists the strategies adapted by the players in this
non-cooperative game plan. A Central Processing Module
(Controller/Central Management System) manages the over-
all system interactions. The controller is a blockchain man-
agement module that enrolls legitimate users to the system.
This module is responsible for overall system validation,
transactions management, and rank assignments to the hos-
pitals and insurance companies. The rank of the hospitals is

influenced by the cost-effective treatments, success rate in
curing the patient’s illness and percentage of successful insur-
ance claims made through that hospital. Similarly providing
flexible premium plans and time taken for claim processing
will dictate the ranking of the insurance companies. Table 2
shows symbols used in the modeling and their description.
The ill-patients’ arrivals to the healthcare system are Pois-
son random distributed with arrival rate λ and successful
treatment rate µ,. The probability of illness is determined by
Pi
(
Np, λ
)
=
λNpe−λ
Np!
(16)
and
Ptreated
(
Np_treated , µ
)
=
µNp_treated e−µ
Np_treated !
(17)
where,
Nptreated =
∑Nh
i=1
Nptreated i (18)
Nash equilibrium is established inside the system when
1. Pi = Pimin i.e., if the probability of illness is mini-
mum, then the number of patients turning to hospitals
becomes minimum; number of claims also becomes
minimum.
2. λ should be close toµ, i.e., all patients admitted into the
hospital with illness are treated successfully.
3. NC ≈ NCsuccess i.e., all claims raised by the users are
successfully processed.
To provide competition between the hospitals and insur-
ance companies, ranking is given to each hospital and insur-
ance companies. The rank of the ith hospital in the chain is
given by
Rhi = F
{
PsHi , µhi
}
(19)
For example, during a period, T, let
• Total no of patients in the system, Np = 100
• No of patients selecting the ith hospital Nphi = 20
The rate of selecting the ith hospital in this case is 0.2. The
cumulative ratio over the consecutive time durations is given
by the sum of the rates in (T1, T2, . . .).
If the number of patients treated successfully by the
ith hospital be Np_treated_hi = 18, then the success rate for the

C. COGNITION, BLOCKCHAIN, AND INTERNET OF THINGS
In the recent times, game theory use cases for blockchain
has gained significant momentum as game theory helps in
developing applications with optimum incentives. A process-
ing model using game theory for blockchain is developed
in [37], [38]. Off-chain processing reduces the bur-
den of intensive computing on-chain thereby providing
a lightweight infrastructure for cost-effective application
development. Mining is one mechanism in which game the-
ory can be applied. As the mining process not only depends
on the computational resources of the miner but also on
the resources of the other miners, a non-cooperative game
strategy can be modeled to derive an efficient solution for
earning rewards [39]. It can also be applied on the financial
applications based on blockchain such as Bitcoin cryptocur-
rency. In [40], game theory-based resource mining strategy is
developed to invest electricity for mining Bitcoin.
In critical applications such as healthcare, data is critical to
derive insight resulting in effective decision-making. Cogni-
tion can be incorporated into the healthcare system in order
to get information about the patient condition, and the resul-
tant medical processes to be implemented. The IoT devices
installed at the patient-end (wearable devices or bed-side
VOLUME 10, 2022 60119
S. Surekha, M. Z. U. Rahman: Blockchain Framework for Cognitive Sensor Network Using Non-Cooperative Game Theory
installations) continuously monitor the patient-end activities
and the data collected through sensors is stored off-chain.
The sensors connected to the IoT devices provide cognition
about the environment around the patient. In the blockchain,
the transactions are signed using the hash of the node address.
A special node called miner will validate these transactions
and stores them inside the block, periodically and adds the
blocks to the previous blocks, as shown in Figure. 4. The first
node in the chain is called genesis block. The data structure
inside the blockchain is organized as a binary Merkle tree,
as shown in Figure 5. It is evident from the structure that any
fraudulent action can easily be traced back and such a trans-
action will automatically be discarded from the blockchain
record.
Every event at the patient’s end (such as opening oxygen
supply valve for patient with breathing difficulty) is recorded
in the blockchain as a transaction along with digital prescrip-
tions, patient body vital parameters, and medical records.
The blockchain and IoT technologies have bought revolu-
tionary changes in the transformation of healthcare systems.
Blockchain provides secure data sharing, and unaltered med-
ical record keeping resulting in faster claim processing and
treatment-oriented billing. Smart contracts are employed to
provide access control to the patient’s medical records and
other relevant data. A smart contract is a digital agreement
comprising a set of rules that all the nodes in the blockchain
agree upon. Smart contracts avoid the need for employ-
ing complex consensus mechanisms to validate transactions.
Solidity is the official programming language for writing
smart contracts. Smart contract algorithms for patient event
recording and insurer modules are shown in listings 1 and 2,
respectively.

FIGURE 5. Merkle tree structure.
Smart contracts use Solidity’s mapping data structures that
associate address of the node to a Boolean which returns
true when the user is legitimate to access the resource and
false otherwise. Pysolc and Web3.py are used to access the
contracts from the Python APIs. Smart contracts require less
computational process in comparison to consensus mecha-
nisms hence are able to provide economical transaction vali-
dations. Data storage is validated through smart contracts and
hence only legitimate transactions are recorded. At the same
time, only authorized insurance agents, hospitals and doctors
can access the patient medical records hence data privacy
is preserved. The conjunction of blockchain, IoT and cog-
nition technologies makes the transactions non-fraudulent,
traceable and improves the efficacy and the efficiency of the
system. In the next section, a healthcare prototype is designed
to evaluate the proposed design methodology. A comparative

uses Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ [41] boards as IoT devices
on which various sensors are interfaced. A few switches are
configured and attached to the bed to indicate the status
of life-support systems. Ethereum [42] based permisioned
blockchain is created and the IoT devices are attached to
this network. A high-end computing system with 32 GB
RAM and 2 TB secondary storage acts as the miner, as well
as the central controller, to validate the transactions in the
system. The miner uses Ubuntu 18.04 operating system, and
computations are carried out using core-i7 processor clocking
at 2.2 GHz. Every event, such as patient admit, medication

Truffle [43] is one of the smart contract provisioning
framework used in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This
framework generates an executable byte code for smart con-
tracts written in Solidity. Truffle supports rapid prototyp-
ing and testing of smart contracts. Using interfaces such as
Web3.py, nodes can access the smart contracts. The list of
packages and libraries used in the prototype are listed in

are gwei and 1 gwei = 10−9ETH (Ethers) on an Ethereum
platform. The gas price is fixed at 20 gwei in the proposed
blockchain model.
The cost of a transaction is calculated as Cost = Gas
Spent × Gas Price. This cost becomes significant when the
testing chain is connected to the public Ethereum chain.
Every transaction and every access to smart contract has
associated cost. Table 4 gives the costs for accessing vari-
ous contracts in the implemented blockchain network. The
system is considered to be stable when λ < µ. If λ > µ,
the queue inside the system grows longer and it takes larger
time interval to reach stationary distribution. Figure 6. shows
the patient arrival and successful treatment timing in the
healthcare system. The average waiting and treatment times
are shown in Figure 7.
Figure 8 gives the system utilization and response time as a
function of increasing service rates. Factors such as available
infrastructure, number of users will impact the response time
of the system. In the equilibrium state, the system utiliza-
tion (ρ) is a measure of how busy the system is during
the course of its operation. Bandwidth utilization, accurate
communication between entities and use of smart contracts
has significant impact on the overall system impact. The
utilization provided by the proposed model proves to be supe-
rior compared to the existing schemes. For the system to be
stable ρ < 1. Figure 9 shows the variation of queuing delay
with respect to the length of queue for the overall healthcare
system. The longer the patients and other stakeholders are
waiting, the longer the delay will be. As the number of users
entering the system increases, the amount of time the system
takes to enter the equilibrium (stable) state. Latency is another
important parameter that hinders the overall performance of
the blockchain network, latency in blockchain is the amount
of time it takes to broadcast the validated transactions to all
the peers in the network. The variation of switching delay
in the network is shown in Figure 10. The switching delay
increases with the increase in the switching from one process
to the other process and the longer these delays, the slower
the network becomes. It is evident that the switching delay
is less compared to the existing similar methods because the

course of actions and outcomes at each stage are predefined
and little process is required at each stage. Figure 11 shows
the transaction processing times in the blockchain network.
The processing time increases with the increase in the num-
ber of transactions but these delays are tolerable and less
than 13 seconds in the proposed method, due to the use of
smart contracts. Figure 12 shows the latency in the blockchain
as a function of increasing transactions. Compared to public
Blockchains, latency in the proposed model is less due to
the use of permissioned blockchain networks and dedicated
bandwidth is available to all the nodes.
Since patient’s critical data, medical records and pre-
scriptions are stored off-chain and only transactional refer-
ences are stored in the blockchain which reduces the gas

consumption and improves throughput. Fig.13. shows the
average throughput with an increase in number of trans-
actions across the system. The proposed model uses smart
contracts-based transaction validations (instead of consen-
sus mechanisms) and hence the transaction rates are higher.
Processing rates and latency also influence the throughput.
A comparative analysis between the proposed model and the
existing works is presented in Table 6. It is evident from
Table 6 that the proposed model provides enhanced features

systems.
B. DISCUSSION
Healthcare is always a challenging domain and the need
for quality treatments and services at reduced costs is ever
growing. With the conventional approaches failing to meet
the rising demands, digital technologies can transform the
healthcare sector by building trust amongst the stakeholders
and providing mutual benefits. Use of blockchain provides a
secured platform for data sharing and storage and immutable
record keeping allows faster claim process. Overall, the
developed system is transparent, autonomous, and scalable.
The proposed model is suitable in environments where inter-
dependencies among the entities in a system plays vital role.
Further, this method outlines the qualitative approach that
can be used by the entities of the system to derive optimal
policies.
There is a vast scope for improvement in this area of
research in future. With the advent of quantum comput-
ing, there is a need to shift from conventional hashing and
other encryption schemes used in the blockchain and develop
quantum-proof algorithms. Device authentication is another
area of concern. This is essential to ensure only autho-
rized devices are getting access to the system resources.
PUF-based device authorization and mutual authentication
schemes can be employed to prevent fake devices and pro-
vide secured communication among different entities. In the
present work, authors implemented the prototype on a per-
missioned Ethereum blockchain. This system can be further
extended to operate in multichain interoperable networks.
V. CONCLUSION
A novel model using non-cooperative game strategy and
emerging technologies like cognitive IoT and blockchain is
proposed in this model. This strategic game satisfies Nash
equilibrium conditions and provides stable operational con-
ditions. The three players in the game, doctor, hospital and
insurer abide to the game rules and strategies and each user
will try to get benefitted from the actions of other play-
ers. The strategy incorporates ranking to hospitals, insurers
and provide best possible coverage for the patients with
low premium. Blockchain platform provides an immutable
and secured medical record keeping. Ethereum-based per-
missioned blockchain allows only authenticated users into
the healthcare network. IoT devices at the patient end can
perceive changes at the patient’s end, such as oxygen-supply,
pulse rate variations etc., and each of these events are
recorded in the blockchain. The doctor prescriptions and
other medical records are stored electronically in the off-
chain database. To provide data privacy, the sensitive data
is stored in the off-chain database, and only transaction
related data is stored in the blockchain. Smart contracts are
used to provide access to the off-chain data. The simulation
results show that the system provides a stable operational
environment in terms of latency, throughput and scales with
the increased transactions. The proposed model provides a
flexible operating environment wherein the interdependent
communicating entities can follows diversified strategies to
yield optimal results that provide mutual benefits to all the
players in the system.
