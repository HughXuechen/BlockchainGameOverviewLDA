Abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to provide a discussion on the interface and interactions between data, analytical techniques and impactful research in
humanitarian health supply chains. New techniques for data capturing, processing and analytics, such as big data, blockchain technology and artificial
intelligence, are increasingly put forward as potential “game changers” in the humanitarian field. Yet while they have potential to improve data analytics in
the future, larger data sets and quantification per se are no “silver bullet” for complex and wicked problems in humanitarian health settings. Humanitarian
health supply chains provide health care and medical aid to the most vulnerable in development and disaster relief settings alike. Unlike commercial supply
chains, they often lack resources and long-term collaborations to enable learning from the past and to improve further.
Design/methodology/approach – Based on a combination of the authors’ research experience, interactions with practitioners throughout projects
and academic literature, the authors consider the interface between data and analytical techniques and highlight some of the challenges inherent to
humanitarian health settings. The authors apply a systems approach to represent the multiple factors and interactions between data, analytical
techniques and collaboration in impactful research.
Findings – Based on this representation, the authors discuss relevant debates and suggest directions for future research to increase the impact of
data analytics and collaborations in fostering sustainable solutions.
Originality/value – This study distinguishes itself and contributes by bringing the interface and interactions between data, analytical techniques
and impactful research together in a systems approach, emphasizing the interconnectedness.

1. Introduction
The third United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG
3) is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all
ages” (UN, 2021). Despite improvements in health before 2020,
the rate of progress has been insufficient to meet most SDG
targets (UN, 2020), notably in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern
Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest mortality rate among
under-fives. Together with Southern Asia, it accounts for 86% of
maternal deaths worldwide. TheCOVID-19 pandemic hasmade
reaching the SDGs more difficult by throwing progress off track
in many health domains. Border closures have resulted in
potential vaccine shortages in dozens of low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). Disruption to global supply chains can lead
to shortages of contraceptives, and the shortage of health
professionals has been exacerbated, setting off alarms about
preparedness for health emergencies (UN, 2020).
The focus of this paper is on humanitarian health supply
chains. In this paper, we define humanitarian health supply
chains encompassing health care and medical programs in both
development (e.g. childhood immunization, family planning,
HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment in LMICs) and relief
operations (epidemic outbreaks such as Ebola, COVID-19,
plague and measles). Important differentiating factors between
humanitarian health supply chains and regular health supply
chains often include the presence of multiple stakeholders or
the fragmentation of humanitarian supply chains.
New techniques for data capturing, processing and analytics,
such as big data, blockchain technology and artificial
intelligence (AI), are increasingly put forward as potential
“game changers” in the humanitarian field (Dubey et al., 2020;
Swaminathan, 2018; Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020; Tang,
2021). Although these have proven useful in commercial
settings, their application to humanitarian health settings
warrants caution, as the supply chain here is fundamentally
different from its commercial counterparts (Pedraza-Martinez
and Van Wassenhove, 2016). Holguín-Veras et al. (2012)
identify several differentiating features in terms of the:
� objectives pursued;
� origins of commodity flows;
� decision-making structure;
� knowledge of demand;
� state of the social networks;
� state of the supporting systems; and
� periodicity and volume of logistic activity.
Tang (2021) highlights three characteristics of economic
development programs that differ from traditional operations
research/operations management (OR/OM) problems focused
on profit maximization: interdependent goals, complementary
efforts and contextual challenges. Another distinguishing
feature between commercial and humanitarian supply chains is
that the former tends to be proactive, whereas the latter,
especially in relief settings, is reactive (Dubey et al., 2021).
The ultimate goal of (new techniques of) data capture and
analysis in humanitarian settings is to help practitioners in
humanitarian health supply chains solve real-life problems. To
achieve this goal, collaboration between academics and
researchers is indispensable. This collaboration is needed both
for obtaining the necessary input data and for eventually
implementing suggested interventions in practice (e.g. by
creating rigorous implementation research frameworks to
gauge the impact of these interventions;Maric et al., 2021).
The interactions between data, analytical techniques and
collaboration between academics and practitioners in impactful
research in humanitarian health environments are legion,
forming a complex system of interconnected loops. Only by
understanding these loops, it is possible to see why data
analytics may not be a “silver bullet”, how it depends on
collaborations and ask what can be done about it. The
simplified causal loop diagram (CLD) presented in this paper
clearly shows these interconnections. A CLD is a system
dynamics (SD) tool used to visualize how different variables in
a system are interrelated (Sterman, 2000). Based on the CLD
and a combination of research experience, interactions with
practitioners throughout projects and academic literature, we
discuss the challenges inherent to humanitarian health settings
as a basis for developing recommendations to steer future
research in a direction where collaborations and analytics can
foster sustainable solutions, resulting in both impactful
practical recommendations and relevant research output.
Themain contribution of our work is taking a systems approach
to the problem. Other papers have already discussed several
difficulties and challenges related to data and analytics in
humanitarian operations (de Vries and Van Wassenhove, 2020;
Pedraza-Martinez and Van Wassenhove, 2016). Our work
distinguishes itself from those papers by bringing the interface and
interactions between data, analytical techniques and collaborative
research together in a CLD, thereby showing how everything is
interconnected. Those connections and loops have not been
explicitly explained in literature. The CLD helps explain why
interventions often do not yield the intended improvements and
highlights that a change in one of the connections will affect the
entire system in the long run. A proper understanding of these
connections can lead to the escaping fromwhat is often stated as a
“deadlock”.We indicate how this can be accomplished through an
exemplary case and by suggesting future research directions. Our
paper aims to improve the understanding of the complex system
encompassing both data analytics and collaborations among
researchers and practitioners in humanitarian health supply chains.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
presents three real-life examples of experiences gained by the
authors from research projects – both successes and failures, to
provide the reader with contextual information and insights.
Section 3 describes the different factors between data,
analytical techniques and collaborative research. We represent
the interactions between them in a CLD and highlight the
challenges inherent to humanitarian health supply chains. In
Section 4, we identify ways to increase the impact of data
analytics and collaborations in fostering sustainable solutions,
illustrated by a case study (Section 4.1), and suggest directions
for further research (Section 4.2). Section 5 concludes with a
summary of themain insights.
2. Lessons from three research projects
In this section, we present three cases from our experiences in
the field of humanitarian health OR/OM: childhood
immunization, family planning and supply chain resilience in
health emergencies. Each case focuses on a different part of the
data capturing, data analytics and collaboration triptych. The
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
childhood immunization case shows the difficulties typically
encountered during data capturing; obtaining reliable and
relevant context-related data is often imperative but takes time
and requires collaboration between researchers and
practitioners. The family planning case shows that simply
having data is not enough; to be useable, the data must be
cleaned and one needs to understand the context in which they
were collected. The supply chain resilience case highlights that
constructing a model that can encompass different locations
and different organizations – for generalizability – is time-
consuming and beyond the scope of most academic studies.
2.1 Childhood immunization
Despite being one of the most successful and cost-effective
health interventions, immunization presents substantial
challenges in LMICs (De Boeck et al., 2020; Decouttere et al.,
2021b).
First, reported immunization coverage rates are often inaccurate.
While the ratio between the number of vaccinated children and
the total child population is an internationally used metric
(Stashko et al., 2019), in practice, errors in the numerator and
denominator frequently occur. For the numerator, registration
of the vaccines administered is challenging in low-resource
settings. Even more problematic is the denominator, which
takes the population estimate (often based on historical census
data and projections) for the catchment area as the basis which
may differ substantially from the actual number (Stashko et al.,
2019). Factors that “blur” the actual number of children to be
vaccinated in a catchment area include freedom of health-care
choice, migration, home-births and demographic evolution.
Related to the denominator errors is the so-called “aggregation
fallacy” – that is, while national immunization coverage may
look promising, subnational differences exist – which explains
why reported/estimated coverage rates can exceed 100%,
unrealistic year-to-year fluctuations are reported, and disease
outbreaks can occur in areas with high reported coverage
(Stashko et al., 2019).
A second challenge relates to the tendency to focus on short-term
solutions. For example, when a measles outbreak occurs, mass
vaccination campaigns are put in place. When immunization
status is hard to establish because of lack of well-functioning
immunization registries, every child in the targeted age group is
vaccinated in the campaign regardless of whether they already
received a vaccine. This again leads to immunization coverage
rates that exceed 100%. Mass vaccination campaigns absorb
immunization resources and remove the urgency from
correcting deficiencies in the routine immunization system that
caused the local under-immunization, preventing the
identification of sustainable interventions.
Through an ongoing collaboration with the University of
Rwanda, several authors of this paper conducted community-
level research, stakeholder workshops and field visits to analyze
the immunization system in Rwanda. A substantial portion of
the data used for operational planning in the vaccine supply
chain are paper-based or entered on Excel sheets, which is also
the case in Rwanda. As a result, data are scattered and of
variable quality, making it necessary to use multiple sources to
obtain the necessary input, including reports from WHO and
UNICEF and primary data collected by local researchers. For
the latter, it was necessary to apply for ethical clearance, a
lengthy and difficult process.
For the research (Decouttere et al., 2021a, 2021b), we first
drew a CLD, which was adapted through several iterations with
stakeholders during field visits, stakeholder workshops and
discussions with local research staff. After the CLD was
constructed, an analytical SD model was developed, again
requiring multiple iterations with local researchers. These
researchers reconnected through regular follow-up interviews
with the stakeholders in the communities to clarify unexpected
data input and model output. During the COVID-19
pandemic, we continued the collaboration through online
meetings thanks to the longstanding relationship with and
involvement of local researchers.
Data collection (based on stakeholder engagement) during
this research was time-consuming and slowed the delivery of
research output. It was, nevertheless, valuable (and even
imperative), as it allowed to:
� identify relevant problems;
� make an overview of the available and useful data and data
sources;
� identify required additional data and construct a plan to
collect these data (including applying for ethical
clearance); and
� build a long-lasting relationship with local research
partners.
2.2 Family planning
For many years, a few of the authors have collaborated with a
mid-size non-governmental organization (NGO) dealing with
family-planning services (de Vries et al., 2021; Alban et al.,
2022) that operates some 500 mobile outreach teams in 30
African countries. The teams generally visit villages after a
marketing campaign, but their visits are irregular and client
numbers vary widely. Some villages have large numbers of
clients even though they are visited infrequently; others have
small client numbers but are visited every month. Clearly, there
are resource allocation problems here, such as assigning villages
to outreach teams and determining visit frequencies. How
marketing efforts influence client numbers and whether villages
are saturated or constitute a source of new clients remains
unclear.
The organization systematically captures considerable data
regarding clients visiting the mobile outreach teams (through
software that allows them to record client information), which
itself is rare in the humanitarian health field. However, the data
are “dirty” – names and reasons for the visit as well as
information about arrival and departure of the mobile outreach
team are often poorly recorded, village names are entered in
different ways and geographical coordinates are imprecise. In
short, it is difficult to use the data for analysis without cleaning
them andmaking linkages, for example, to characteristics of the
village in terms of population, poverty, marketing efforts and
client numbers. It is important to note that this NGO invests
substantial efforts in data gathering, making it a clear leader in
the sector. Hence, this signals that the challenges for many
other organizations are evenmuch larger than described above.
While donors to this NGO insist that priority be given to the
young and the poor, very limited information linking villages
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
with such groups is captured. Under increasing pressure from
donors, staff put a lot of time and effort into collecting data and
making reports to comply with donors’ reporting requirements,
but these are not always useful for improving internal efficiency
or for research purposes. They tend to serve auditing purposes
instead of being geared toward learning and performance
improvement. Moreover, auditing and reporting take away
resources that could be invested in developing sustainable
solutions.
The organization is extremely cautious about suggesting – let
alone imposing – rules on the mobile outreach teams, which
makes it difficult to change key operating variables (e.g. visit
frequencies) and to determine the impact of better-designed
visit allocation rules. Given a reluctance to intervene at the local
level, they are hesitant to test and implement recommendations
from research insights.
This type of situation is common in development settings
and makes systemic improvements hard for several reasons.
First, there is little reliable information (i.e. not enough solid
and useful data) to do a proper analysis of the drivers of
performance. Second, organizations often do not have the
competences or resources to do this type of analysis in-house.
Third, they do not see how this can be changed and, thus,
expend little effort collecting and analyzing data to improve
operations. Also, they do not have the authority to run pilots or
change routines in the field, where operations are typically
decentralized and obtaining good information is difficult.
2.3 Supply chain resilience in the event of health
emergencies
Using information from a large humanitarian organization
regarding the impact of likely scenarios of disasters on its
operations, several authors of this paper developed an SD
model to optimize the disaster preparedness of the organization
(Stumpf et al., 2022, Rustemeier, 2017). After the research and
development phase, a broker consulting organization tested
and implemented the model in the humanitarian context. The
goal of the broker was to apply the model to different
humanitarian organizations and disaster responses to be able to
generalize the findings for a larger part of the sector. Themodel
so far has been used for both food and non-food items. For
example, a study was conducted on the response capacities of a
humanitarian organization in the event of a possible cholera
outbreak by studying the availability of oral rehydration
solutions and normal saline for the management and treatment
of cholera.
When a humanitarian organization approaches the broker
organization with an interest in using the SD model, a one-day
workshop is held to develop the disaster scenario. This secures
model contextualization based on operational parameters,
assures the relevance of the analysis for the humanitarian
organization and greatly enhances the sense of ownership by
field office staff. It avoids the lack of stakeholder engagement
that often hampers projects where the benefits are not mutually
understood or communicated. For a period of one to three
weeks, the humanitarian organization is supported with data
collection. Data requirements include supply chain
information during both current operations and the disaster
scenario selected from multiple external stakeholders (e.g.
suppliers and transportation companies). Different data
sources may be combined (e.g. storage and transport technical
reports, historical data and extensive qualitative discussions
with staff). All assumptions are verified through discussion with
the organization’s supply chain and program departments. The
results of the model are outlined in a practitioner report and
presented to the humanitarian organization’s leader and senior
management team during a final workshop.
Although the field study is necessary to understand the
challenges and context, it is time-consuming. The data may not
be in the correct format or may not even have been collected.
Hence, the engagement of the humanitarian organization’s
employees is vital to obtain reliable estimations. This is
particularly challenging when the practitioners need to imagine a
“fictitious” disaster; they can find it hard to accept that their
assumptions must be reliable and to recognize that, even if the
SD model strives to represent the organization’s operations in
the most realistic way possible, it cannot represent every detail of
the real supply chain. The context is even more complex when
the scenario includes a disease outbreak in LMICs with limited
financial resources, as the local health system is overwhelmed and
does not function properly. An epidemic can worsen if natural
disasters occur simultaneously, creating additional challenges
regarding data availability and reliability. Clearly, data analytics
for effective decision-making is difficult to achieve. Rolling out a
model in different locations and for different organizations to
allow for its generalizability is time-consuming and typically lies
outside the scope of academic studies.
3. Data analytics in humanitarian health
operations
3.1 The interface between data, analytical techniques
and collaboration for impactful research
Drawing upon our collective experience in humanitarian OR/
OM, we start by describing the different factors between data,
analytical techniques and collaboration for impactful research
and identifying the interactions and loops between these factors
(Sections 3.1.1–3.1.3). They emphasize the complex
interrelations captured in a CLD (Section 3.1.4).
3.1.1Myopic versus sustainable solutions
In many instances, an underlying phenomenon initially does
not create an acute problem (e.g. local under-immunization
does not result in an outbreak of disease). Indeed, decision-
makers may not be aware of the problem or feel any urgency to
invest in solutions. Awareness suddenly increases when a
serious problem occurs (e.g. a measles outbreak), resulting in a
perceived urgency to change. As the apparent problems are
often life-threatening, resources are focused on finding a “quick
fix” (immediate solution) to improve the as-is situation.
Decisions are often made at short notice and under time
pressure, resulting in myopic solutions that relieve the
symptoms of the underlying problem(s) but not their root
cause(s). Consequently, these myopic solutions are rarely close
to long-term sustainable solutions. It is only a matter of time
before the system re-enters an acute state with pressing
problems, repeating the cycle.
Given the resource-limited setting (in terms of for example
money, people, assets and time), a tradeoff exists between
investing in myopic quick-fixes in response to an acute problem
and sustainable solutions whose benefits only become apparent
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
in the long term, consistent with the “shifting the burden”
systems archetype described in Meadows (2008). To find
heuristic solutions that can also be implemented during an
acute state and that are close or nearly close to long-term
optimal solutions, considerable resources need to be invested.
Given the tradeoff mentioned above, these resources are often
used for implementing myopic solutions because the system is
constantly re-entering acute states characterized by pressing
problems.
3.1.2 Availability and reliability of data
Decision-makers need to be aware of the problem if they are to
start investing in sustainable solutions and developing research
that helps to define a solution. They need the right data, that is, to
monitor the relevant metrics that identify the problem, based on
research techniques and validated with real-life data of
satisfactory quality. Being able to make sense of data requires a
knowledge of the context in which they are collected (which is
often linked to the reporting of metrics) andmay require multiple
iterations with people in the field. To ensure high-quality data,
decision-makers must be aware of the value they represent and,
therefore, allocate sufficient resources. We have seen some
organizations deliberating on what the relevant metrics are, yet
few succeed. Logistics in the humanitarian sector are often
neither considered a priority at leadership level (at best, it is
considered a support function) nor is there a donor appetite for it.
3.1.3 Fostering sustainable solutions using analytical techniques in
long-term collaborations
The use of analytical techniques does not necessarily lead to the
identification of sustainable solutions. Several steps are
necessary for this to happen. First, analytical techniques must
address a real-life problem (as opposed to finding a problem
that fits the technique). Engaging with people in the field is a
better way to direct research efforts to relevant problems,
increase understanding of the local context and establish a
relationship with practitioners and stakeholders. This
incentivizes (further) collaboration between humanitarian
organizations and researchers and increases the willingness of
stakeholders to engage in research projects and primary data
collection. When analytical techniques are coupled with real-
life, high-quality data, embedded in the local context and
targeted at solving relevant problems, it increases the ability to
deliver impactful research output. When this output enables
researchers to both solve real-life problems encountered by
practitioners and publish in academic journals, it increases the
incentive to develop analytical techniques.
Going one step further, the development of analytical
techniques that are firmly linked with practice is needed to close
the gap – going back to practitioners with solutions that
integrate several problem-solving iterations – and ultimately
leads to valid research insights and the identification of
sustainable solutions. When changes to practice are based on
research insights that actually resolve or reduce the problems at
hand, it again increases the incentive for practitioners to
collaborate with researchers.
3.1.4. A general causal loop diagram
Clearly, many factors intervene in the relationship between
data, analytical techniques, collaboration between researchers
and practitioners and impactful, implementation-oriented
research. Moreover, multiple interactions and causal loops
between these different factors lead to a complex system. We
use a systems approach to represent the dynamic complexity of
the interactions discussed in Sections 3.1.1–3.1.3.
Figure 1 presents the resulting CLDwith feedback loops that
are either reinforcing (R) loops or balancing (B) loops. In a
reinforcing loop, an initial deviation in a variable in the loop will
lead to a further deviation of that variable in the same direction.
For example, an initial increase in loop R1 of “identification of
sustainable solutions” will increase “ability to deliver relevant
research output”, which will increase “analytical techniques
development”. This, in turn, will increase “analytical
techniques implementation”, and by closing the reinforcing
loop, this will lead to a further increase in the initially increased
variable “identification of sustainable solutions”. In contrast, a
balancing feedback loop will convert an initial deviation in a
variable to a deviation in the opposite direction. For instance,
in loop B1, a higher “perceived urgency to change”will increase
“investment in myopic solution”, which will decrease
“situation awareness” because the problem symptoms have
been fixed. Consequently, the “perceived urgency to change”
will be reduced and the initial “investment in myopic solution”
as well.
Figure 1 explains two main insights derived from the three
case studies. First, it reveals the undermining effect (R4) of
quick fix solutions (B1) on resolving problems through
sustainable country development (B2) in which we recognize
the “shifting the burden” systems archetype (Meadows, 2008).
Second, it clarifies the synergistic effect between “fostering
sustainable solutions” (R1) where analytical techniques are
developed and implemented and “implementation success”
(R2) which further incentivizes research collaboration between
practitioners and researchers. This, in turn, enables stakeholder
engagement and primary data collection, increasing the ability
to deliver impactful research output and further contributing to
“analytical techniques development”. Conversely, a low ability
to deliver relevant research output will ultimately lead to few
possibilities to identify sustainable solutions that can be used in
practice. This, in turn, further decreases the ability to deliver
relevant research output, creating a negatively reinforcing loop.
Moreover, several of the feedback loops are closely interacting
with each other. Therefore, a change in one of the variables or
connections will ultimately affect the entire system.
If we consider the ultimate goal of the humanitarian system,
then only the balancing loop B2 “supporting country
development” is involved in actually reducing the unresolved
problems. In contrast, when one invests in myopic solutions
following the “quick fix” reinforcing loop, the research
opportunity is lost, as the analytical processes that would enable
to solve the cause of the problems are not implemented.
3.2. A challenging environment
In this section, we review major challenges that hamper the
positively reinforcing connections in the CLD in Figure 1 when
applied to humanitarian health operations. To identify these
challenges, we draw upon a combination of our own research
experience, interactions with practitioners throughout projects
and academic literature.
We searched the databases Web of Science and Scopus
using the following search terms: (data analytics) AND
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
([humanitarian operations] OR [development operations] OR
[global health operations]). We then selected articles that
describe challenges related to data, analytical techniques and
collaboration between academics and practitioners in
humanitarian health environments. It is not our aim to provide
an exhaustive overview of papers using data analytics for
humanitarian health operations – for this, interested readers
can consult, for example, Akter and Wamba (2019), Ali et al.
(2016), Gupta et al. (2019), Maric et al. (2021) and Sharma
and Joshi (2019). Practitioner input was obtained from:
� one of the coauthors who is a practitioner; and
� interactions with practitioners from humanitarian,
medical and supply chain organizations throughout
different research projects.
Using the CLD, we conclude that unless a problem is identified
and unless relevant and reliable data are coupled with
knowledge about the context, data analytics have limited use in
these settings because the proposed solutions will neither
model a real-life problem nor solve it.
3.2.1 Focus on myopic solutions
3.2.1.1 Challenge 1: Competing priorities. Gonçalves (2011)
quantifies the tradeoff for humanitarian organizations between
providing relief/recovery after a disaster and building capacity.
Deploying substantial resources in the form of disaster relief
shows clear benefits in the short term, making this a compelling
strategy but inevitably results in fewer resources available for
capacity building. If the humanitarian organization is in the
“quick fix” loop (Figure 1), then it is too busy with life-saving
and health activities to care about data collection – data are not
a priority (Kunz, 2019).
Organizational values (e.g. capacity to ferment positive
change in reaction to observed or experienced flaws) have an
impact on the consideration of the tradeoff between short-term
myopic and long-term sustainable solutions (Dennehy et al.,
2021). The idea still prevails in the field that humanitarian
organizations should focus their energy and resources on
delivering medical care to people in need rather than
developing IT applications (Falagara Sigala et al., 2020).
Donors often consider the latter as overheads which should be
minimized. Nearly every humanitarian organization performs
an Emergency Response Evaluation after a severe crisis and
poorly engineered data systems are frequently pinpointed as
failures, yet investment in systems and apps does not
materialize, as it is not their core business.
3.2.2 Data overload versus data that are not available, reliable and
useful
3.2.2.1 Challenge 2: Collecting context-related data takes time.
Most commercial companies have a large database. In
humanitarian health settings, data are seldom properly
collected, stored or shared, and information systems are lacking
(de Vries and Van Wassenhove, 2020; Pedraza-Martinez and
Figure 1 The interface between data, analytical techniques, collaboration and impactful research
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
Van Wassenhove, 2016). People working in the field still rely
heavily on paper-based lists and Excel sheets to manage
operations (Falagara Sigala et al., 2020). Field data are
characterized by noise, dirt and missing elements, leaving the
researcher tomake sense of it using a combination of contextual
knowledge and modern data analytics techniques (Besiou and
VanWassenhove, 2020).
Without context, data often do not make sense. A
practitioner told us:
The numbers tell the tale. But there are many “buts” – Is there enough data
available? Is the data comparable for merged analysis? Can data between
emergencies be compared or is it context-specific? Maybe it all hinges on
two points: (1) What data, and at what level of granularity, is gathered along
the decision points of the humanitarian supply chain set-up? (2) Is enough
data made available for analysis and system-wide learning to put it in a
contextual perspective?
For data collection, researchers need to work with people on
the ground, establish partnerships with local agents, obtain
ethical clearance and explain to local partners the benefits from
the intervention. Multiple iterations are often required to
understand the context and correctly interpret the data. This
takes a considerable amount of time and effort from researchers
(i.e. beyond that typically committed in the course of a young
academic’s career) and local partners. During the data
collection phase, there is neither output in terms of publication
in scientific journals nor any guarantee that these efforts will
eventually result in a published paper. This makes it a “risky”
investment and reduces the appetite to engage in this type of
research (Kohrt et al., 2019; Standley et al., 2022).
Consequently, some researchers tend to work on problems
using hypothetical data or flock to the scarce cases where data
are readily available, letting techniques or methodology
dominate research relevance and impact.
Data collection is often not standardized nor integrated
across different platforms, agencies, sectors and partners (Nair,
2022). When collecting data, it is important to avoid
duplication of effort (e.g. different research institutions asking
for the same data in a slightly different format or granularity),
thereby wasting local partners’ time and creating frustration.
People in the field are often asked for data collection or
reporting without being told what the data are for and how they
are going to be used. Consequently, field practitioners might
find it hard to appreciate the purpose of data, despite the drive
toward digitalization and technology in the humanitarian
sector. In addition, local partners often focus on gathering data
required by donors for reporting purposes, which are not
always useful for research purposes (e.g. national versus
subnational immunization rates). Different donors have
different reporting requirements (Falagara Sigala et al., 2020).
As resources are limited, this pulls people away from collecting
relevant data for research.
3.2.2.2 Challenge 3: Overload of data that are neither in the
right format nor accessible. In other instances, there may be a
data overload – but not in the right format or difficult to access,
for example, because an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system is bought and installed without training people in
understanding the methodology, context or procedure
(Falagara Sigala et al., 2020). The myopic view referred to in
Section 3.1 means organizations neither design connected
applications nor share data, even though they receive money
from the same donors. Current data storage and IT systems
used by organizations are diverse, siloed and offer limited scope
for collaboration (Akter and Wamba, 2019; Dubey et al.,
2020). Sometimes, the required data are not directly available
but could be extracted from “open sources” like geographical
data and social media (Warnier et al., 2020). It is possible for a
data overload to exist where comprehensive, cross-functional
and accurate data are missing, resulting in a fragmented and
volatile information landscape (Comes et al., 2020; Griffith
et al., 2019; Prasad et al., 2018).
Difficulty of access may be because of different priorities
(Section 3.2.1) or because multiple stakeholders need to grant
access. Hence, it is important to consider data ownership,
governance and security in humanitarian health settings. While
NGOs and global donor agencies operate data systems on
behalf of governments, they do not own the data; ownership
remains with the national governments of LMICs or with the
beneficiary. As such, the approach to data and analytics must
be cognizant of (and embedded in) the data governance
framework of any given application. A local NGO, an
international NGO, a donor and the government may all have
data, but data-sharing rules may not have been agreed upon. In
addition, ethical clearance procedures can take considerable
time.
3.2.3 Difficulties in connecting analytical techniques to sustainable
solutions
Nowadays, humanitarian organizations are more aware of the
importance of supply chain management and increasingly
adopt analytical and technological innovations. As academic
interest in these settings grows, efforts have proliferated to
adapt techniques developed for the commercial context to
humanitarian operations (Besiou and Van Wassenhove, 2020;
Holguín-Veras et al., 2012). However, humanitarian health
settings are very different, as COVID-19 has shown, and
examples of a mismatch between the real-life challenges and
the academic literature abound. Lemmens et al. (2016) found
that general supply chain network models were unable to cope
with the complexities of a vaccine supply chain. De Vries and
Van Wassenhove (2020) note that although routing
optimization software is used extensively for private sector
logistics, this has not happened in humanitarian logistics. The
conditions in which advanced routing systems perform well
rarely hold in humanitarian settings.
3.2.3.1 Challenge 4: Currently applied analytical techniques
fail to grasp the complexity of humanitarian health operations or
are not adapted for field use. Model outcomes need to be
understood and linked to reality, which has proven challenging.
A gap often exists between an optimal solution generated by a
model and what is feasible in practice. There may be cultural
hurdles to the acceptance and usefulness of analytical techniques:
local staff might not trust “black box” optimization (de Vries and
Van Wassenhove, 2020). Consequently, pure OR or AI may
have little value for some humanitarian health issues in LMICs.
Unlike the commercial sector, limited budgets and a challenging
environment (e.g. unreliable internet connections, power outages
and limited access to upgrades) limit the use of IT solutions
that require costly software (Besiou and Van Wassenhove,
2020; Falagara Sigala et al., 2020; Griffith et al., 2019;
Sharma and Joshi, 2019). Decision support tools need to be cost-
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
effective, although measures of cost-effectiveness may vary
greatly among countries (de Vries andVanWassenhove, 2020).
3.2.3.2 Challenge 5: Researchers are not always working on rel-
evant real-life problems. Besiou and Van Wassenhove (2020)
found that papers published in special issues (i.e. of POM,
JOM and EJOR) on humanitarian operations focused on
traditional OR/OM problems with little consideration for the
specific context and on so-called “CNN disasters” that attract
media attention in developed regions (perhaps because of easier
access to data). Tang (2021) provides several examples
showing that a development program is more likely to be
sustainable if the underlying constraints and context are taken
into consideration.
Successful application of data analytics in humanitarian
health settings is highly dependent on the link with practice.
Researchers must first acquire a deep understanding of the
problem, underlying constraints and the context before diving
into analytical modeling or else risk focusing “purely on
developing mathematical methods to solve stylized problems
(puzzles) without reference to any real problem situation”,
creating a vicious circle “where some academics know more
and more about less and less and become disconnected from
the real world” (Dyson et al., 2021).
4. A challenging but necessary way forward
Humanitarian health operations are complex and involve a
multifaceted relationship between data, analytical techniques,
collaboration and impactful research. A proper understanding
of the connections and loops in the CLD (Figure 1) can lead to
the escaping of what is often stated as a “deadlock”. In this
section, we show how this can be accomplished through an
exemplary case (Section 4.1), and we use the CLD (Figure 1)
to develop recommendations to steer future research in
directions where analytics are useful (Section 4.2).
4.1 Exemplary case: Data system and analytics design
for humanitarian health supply chains tomaximize
end-user adoption
Attempts to use software systems to digitize stock and flow data
for vaccine supply chains in LMICs have met with limited
success. Among the reasons for this are the following:
� System design is often focused on administrative reporting
and central planner needs (Ramanujapuram and
Malemarpuram, 2020).
� Too much too soon. Systems attempt to digitize all parts
of the supply chain information flow in one go. This
increases cognitive complexity and data entry effort,
leading to low adoption and poor data quality.
� End-user-friendly design is based on perceptions of end-
users in developed countries instead of including actual
end-users in LMICs.
The Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), a
software tool developed by Logistimo, captures vaccine stock,
in-bound receipts, orders and temperature recordings.
Following a pilot implementation in one state in India, it now
operates almost nationwide (Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India, 2018). The implementation of
eVIN has led to an increase in systematic data capture and
record updating, fewer stock-outs of vaccines and a reduction
in doses wasted/discarded. In addition, the captured data by
eVIN created numerous analytical studies on the factors that
lead to stock-outs and ways to redesign the replenishment
process. This case study demonstrates that systematic data
collection and rigorous analytics are feasible in humanitarian
health supply chains in LMICs if carefully designed and
applied.
Several factors contributed to the success of eVIN:
� Developing a bottom-up design that aligns with the top-
down supply chain planning hierarchy.
� Starting simple and progressively advancing the
complexity of what gets captured in the system. This
allows the user to adapt and select the level of system
complexity according to their degree of familiarity and
ease with the system.
� Using a ubiquitously accessible medium/device for data
collection.
� Creating partnerships with academia to carry out
analytics.
4.2 Paving the way for impactful research
It takes time and considerable effort to understand real
problems in humanitarian health settings (Besiou and Van
Wassenhove, 2020), establish relationships with practitioners
(Kunz et al., 2017) and interact with them iteratively
throughout a research project. Nevertheless, we are convinced
it is worth the effort for analytics to have a positive impact on
current practice. Researchers can significantly contribute to
relevant solutions for humanitarian decision makers. Based on
the CLD (Figure 1), we point out several directions for future
research to activate the positively reinforcing loops in theCLD.
4.2.1 Improving accessibility and quality of data
Research is needed on the reasons behind the frequent
occurrence of noise and imprecise elements in field data such
that improvement efforts are targeted toward effective
incentives or changes. Comes et al. (2020) indicate the need for
experimental and empirical research to assess and quantify the
perceived priority of information to understand information
acquisition in different contexts. This kind of research would be
insightful in both humanitarian development and relief
settings. In addition, future research could investigate the
application of statistical techniques to deal with missing or
noisy data in humanitarian health supply chains, building
models using sparse data and developing modelling techniques
targeting insights rather than purely numerical results.
Alignment of data and reporting requirements between
different donors might result in improved data quality and
accessibility, while reducing the burden on local staff.
Researchers could investigate the impact of donor focus on data
collection efforts and investigate how a shift in donor focus
might improve data quality and accessibility.
Another way to improve accessibility and quality of data is
through the collaboration in data collection, construction of
shared databases and model platforms (Nair, 2022). To set up
a shared database that is useful for all parties involved, there is a
need for coordination between different organizations and
within the organization. This results in the need of a neutral
body collecting and processing these data and making them
freely available to all in an easy-to-use format. Previous
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
research has explored the design principles that need to be
considered in ERP systems for humanitarian organizations in a
disaster relief context (Falagara Sigala et al., 2020). Future
research could investigate similar coordination efforts for data
sharing both within and between humanitarian organizations
and research institutions. Building shared databases raises
many interesting research questions: who is going to collect the
data, who pays for it and how is it governed?
Lack of trust among supply chain partners is a major issue
because collaboration requires sharing of sensitive data and
information (Dubey et al., 2020; Nair, 2022). Tang (2021)
emphasizes the challenge to monitor and respond to conditions
in LMICs when information is not available or verifiable.
Blockchain technology is increasingly put forward to collect
information and facilitate data sharing in a safe and transparent
way in humanitarian settings (Dubey et al., 2020; Rodríguez-
Espíndola et al., 2020; Tang, 2021). It might be interesting to
investigate why organizations are not using blockchain
technology and how they differ from those that successfully
apply this technology on a regular basis.
4.2.2 Qualitative research
Qualitative research is underused and, to some extent,
undervalued in traditional OR/OM journals, as a view exists
that research not involving quantitative modeling should not be
classified as OR/OM (Dyson et al., 2021). However, the field of
humanitarian OR/OM requires both quantitative and
qualitative methods, as humanitarian health settings are very
complex and have strong behavioral aspects (Besiou and Van
Wassenhove, 2015). “Even for hard modelling, the exploration
with stakeholders, the structuring of the problem, the
development of diagrammatic representations, and the choice
of methodologies are crucial stages that deserve the explicit
systematic exploration of problem structuring rather than ad
hoc approaches that are not open to scrutiny and may well lack
rigor” (Dyson et al., 2021). Similarly, in health system design,
qualitative and quantitative methodologies need to be
combined to reach implementable results from analytical
research efforts (Decouttere et al., 2016). External validity of
qualitative research can be assured by including a range of data
sources such as interviews, observations, documents and
artifacts (Comes et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2018).
Qualitative research has high value for both the individual
researchers and the research community as a whole. It increases
understanding of the context and problems on the ground and
is more transparent for stakeholders. When combined with
quantitative modeling, qualitative research can help identify the
research questions to be answered through analytical modeling,
define the required data and, as a result, collect the right data to
investigate the problem at hand (Gralla et al., 2014). It also
provides interesting avenues for future quantitative research,
especially problems and settings that have not yet been
extensively researched. The field of humanitarian health
operations offers many interesting and socially relevant
research opportunities.
4.2.3 Interdisciplinary research
Solely applying typical OR/OM methodologies might not be
sufficient to result in impactful research that takes account of
long-term effects and the unintended consequences of
symptomatic solutions. The need for interdisciplinary research
becomes apparent. This includes the use of data analytics
methodologies beyond typical OR/OM methodologies to
obtain and interpret relevant data such as spatial and
geophysical modeling or using machine learning techniques to
assess and verify data quality, to estimate vulnerability to
disasters (e.g. landslides and flooding) and to produce high-
resolution maps of health indicators (Bosco et al., 2017; Kunz,
2019).
4.2.4 Research on the use and usefulness of data analytics
AI and big data are increasingly put forward as potential “game
changers” in the humanitarian field (Swaminathan, 2018;
Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020; Tang, 2021). Most
publications focus on the benefits of big data (Sharma and
Joshi, 2019). However, it is not a given that AI and big data
always contribute to humanitarian health operations.
Research on perceptions of AI and big data and the feasibility
of applying them in resource-constrained environments offers
insights on the potential hurdles of implementing these
techniques in humanitarian settings. Research is needed to
investigate the performance of easy-to-implement heuristics
compared to optimal solutions, as there is often a gap between
them. This includes research on the usefulness of AI in
humanitarian health settings:
� Does AI significantly outperform current practice or
heuristics that are easy to implement?
� If so, can we derive heuristics from AI solutions that are
intuitive and easy to implement in practice?
The importance of easy-to-implement heuristics should not be
underestimated, as decision-makers are known to follow
intuitive rules to make quick decisions in stressful conditions
(Comes et al., 2020).
Researchers should be aware of potential biases when relying
on big data. Trustworthiness of data sources may be
questionable, particularly when big data is generated on social
media platforms (Ali et al., 2016; Kunz, 2019). Information
obtained through big data technologies and practices is partial
and linked to the geographical and social context of the people
who produce it (Sharma and Joshi, 2019). An important
limitation of using big data comes from the “digital divide”
between those who have access to and those with limited or
non-existent access to connectivity and digital technologies
(Kunz, 2019; Sharma and Joshi, 2019). This is especially
relevant for humanitarian health operations, where connectivity
may be limited in areas hit by a disaster and where a large share
of the population in LMICs still does not have internet access.
A portion of the intended beneficiaries, thus, risk becoming
“invisible” in the humanitarian space and potentially
overlooked (Sharma and Joshi, 2019). This raises important
concerns around fairness and equity. Future research could
investigate the consequences of the “digital divide” as
increasing emphasis is put on data analytics.
4.2.5 Collaboration and stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement throughout an entire research project
is necessary to make the research useful and impactful. To
support the work of humanitarian health organizations with
data analytics, it is imperative that academic research has a
clear link with practice. Spending time with practitioners
enables researchers to understand their reality, concerns and
Humanitarian health supply chains
Kim De Boeck et al.
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management
constraints (Pedraza-Martinez and Van Wassenhove, 2016).
This again underscores the importance of gaining insights on
the ground and obtaining data first-hand through field studies
(Besiou and Van Wassenhove, 2020; Kunz et al., 2017). It
implies using both qualitative (interviews and case studies) and
quantitative (optimization and simulation) methods and
including multiple stakeholders (Besiou and Van Wassenhove,
2015; Dyson, 2021; Van Wassenhove, 2019), as well as data
from governments and organizations. To close the loop, we
must go back to the stakeholders with solutions that integrate
several problem-solving iterations (Besiou and Van
Wassenhove, 2020; Kunz et al., 2017; Van Wassenhove, 2019;
VanWassenhove, 2022).
This will take a considerable amount of time and effort from
both researchers (i.e. a timeframe that goes beyond typical
commitments in young academics’ careers) and their local
partners. To increase stakeholder engagement during research
projects, we must provide researchers with the right incentives
(i.e. universities’ evaluation criteria and journals’ definition of
academic contribution) and work with donors to provide
organizations with the right incentives (i.e. funding) (Kohrt
et al., 2019; Standley et al., 2022). For example,Nature recently
presented a new framework that aims to improve inclusion and
ethics in global research collaborations to avoid and prevent
“helicopter research” (Nature, 2022). The latter occurs “when
researchers from high-income settings, or who are otherwise
privileged, conduct studies in lower-income settings or with
groups who are historically marginalized, with little or no
involvement from those communities or local researchers in the
conceptualization, design, conduct or publication of the
research” (Nature, 2022).
How can research papers go beyond findings to, for example,
enable advocacy, marketing, implementation and fundraising
to make solutions happen? To make a compelling case to drive
better research and get solutions implemented, the definition of
research “contribution” needs to be more inclusive, explaining
the benefit to humanity beyond knowledge advancement. The
involvement of broker consulting organizations can help to
build a bridge between academics and practitioners. These
organizations can apply and implement the model developed
by academics in different locations and tailor it to different
humanitarian organizations.
5. Conclusion
Humanitarian health supply chains provide health care and
medical aid to the most vulnerable in development and disaster
relief settings alike. Researchers in this field have the potential
to contribute to relevant solutions for humanitarian decision
makers. However, a gap between practitioner challenges and
academic literature remains. Although new techniques for data
capturing and processing can potentially improve data analytics
in the future, larger data sets and quantification alone will not
provide a “silver bullet” for all problems in humanitarian health
settings.
This paper has revealed the dynamic mechanisms behind
data, analytical techniques, research collaboration and
impactful research in the field of humanitarian health supply
chains based on a systems approach. The resulting CLD shows
the interconnections and feedback loops between the system
elements. This allows to explain observed behavior and
challenges from the three presented cases. Based on the CLD,
we show that humanitarian operations involve complex systems
and doing research in this field presents abundant challenges:
� Humanitarian organizations often focus on myopic
solutions because of competing priorities.
� Obtaining reliable and relevant context-related data is
often imperative but takes time and requires collaboration
between researchers and practitioners.
� An overload of data exists that are neither in the right
format nor are easily accessible.
� Currently applied analytical techniques fail to grasp the
complexity of humanitarian health operations.
� Researchers do not always work on real-life problems.
Nevertheless, researchers can significantly contribute to
relevant solutions for humanitarian decision-makers.
Humanitarian health supply chains are, above all, a rewarding
and impactful environment in which to do research. Using the
developed CLD, we provide several directions for future
research that we believe will increase the impact of data
analytics in fostering sustainable solutions:
� research on improving the accessibility and quality of data;
� qualitative research;
� interdisciplinary research;
� research on the use and usefulness of data analytics in
humanitarian health settings; and
� stakeholder engagement.
Note that increasing the impact of data analytics in fostering
sustainable solutions will not entirely overcome the gap
between practitioner challenges and academic literature.
Practitioners sparsely publish in academic journals for a variety
of reasons, including different incentive structures to
academics. These are not directly addressed in the CLD
presented in this paper but could remain challenging even after
other challenges are dealt with.
We hope this paper will convince researchers and
practitioners alike of the value and contribution of
collaborations between researchers and humanitarian
organizations, resulting in research projects and partnerships
that provide both impactful practical solutions and relevant
research output.
