+e present work serves to improve the stable cooperation relationship among subjects of supply chain such as enterprises,
farmers, intermediary organizations, and retailers and enhance the governance and optimization of agricultural product supply
chain, thus strengthening the competitiveness of China’s agricultural industry. +e supply chain governance of agricultural
products is taken as the research object. Initially, the stabilities of two supply chain organization modes, “company and farmer”
and “company, intermediary organization and farmer,” are analyzed by static game analysis.+en, based on the above analysis and
the characteristics of blockchain institutional technology, a detailed analyzation is made on the mechanism of supply chain of
agricultural products governance based on blockchain technology. Finally, the functional framework of agricultural supply chain
governance is designed based on the basic framework of blockchain technology, and analyzation is made on the trust mechanism
and contract mechanism of agricultural supply chain governance based on blockchain technology. +e research results show that
problems such as information and cognitive constraints in agricultural supply chain governance cannot be completely solved only
through the evolution of blockchain organizational structure and the supply of governance mechanism, and speculative behavior
will still appear. Optimizing the governance of supply chain of agricultural products based on blockchain technology can realize
the transformation of its governance scenario. Meanwhile, the blockchain technologies such as deintermediation, demistrust, and
intelligent contract play an important role in the process of agricultural supply chain governance, which can make it change in
many aspects such as organization mode, application operation, and governance mechanism. +e rapid development of new
generation information technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of +ings, and computer technology makes it possible to
comprehensively digitize economic activities such as production and transaction in the supply chain of agricultural products. +e
present work combines the technical logic of blockchain digital governance with the institutional logic of agricultural product
supply chain governance and tries to solve the instability problems caused by imperfect organization, lack of trust, and incomplete
contract in agricultural product supply chain governance with the characteristics of blockchain such as deintermediation,
demistrust, and intelligent contract.
1. Introduction
Under the rapid development of free market economy, in
order to realize the modernization of China’s agricultural
field, society must keep up with the pace of reform and
opening up. With the constant industrialization of agri-
culture, the agricultural economic form has changed to some
extent. New forms of agricultural products supply chain
emerge such as strategic alliance and cooperative
production. Under the organizationmodes of “company and
farmer” and “company, intermediary organization and
farmer,” the supply chain of agricultural products is con-
stantly developing and growing [1, 2]. Establishing a stable
cooperative relationship among the participants in the ag-
ricultural supply chain and strengthening the governance of
the agricultural supply chain can effectively improve the
competitive advantage of China’s agriculture. In recent
years, a variety of agricultural products supply chain models,

such as “farmers and companies,” “family farms and com-
panies,” and “farmers, supermarkets, and rural cooperatives”
have emerged constantly, and the participants are also
growing [3]. On the whole, through the governance and
optimization of supply chain of agricultural products, the
cooperative relationship in supply chain of agricultural
products has become relatively stable. Its organizational
structure has gradually changed from loose to tight. However,
there are still some problems to be solved in China’s agri-
cultural supply chain for a long time, such as the difficulty in
ensuring the quality of agricultural products, the high default
rate when farmers and companies cooperate, and the diffi-
culty in reaching long-term cooperative relations [4–6].
By consulting relevant references, results turn out that
many researchers attribute the change of the relationship of
supply chain of agricultural products to the change of system.
Based on the relevant theories under the new system, study
and discussion are made on the formation and evolution of
supply chain of agricultural products. On the governance of
agricultural supply chain, some relevant scholars have
compared the governance mechanism and transaction rela-
tionship in different agricultural products circulation chan-
nels through actual case analysis. +e research results show
that the long-term transaction relationship of “order indus-
try” has the highest performance level, which verifies that
trust relationship is beneficial to improving industry per-
formance [7]. In the follow-up development process, some
researchers also used case analysis and model empirical
method to analyze the causal relationship of the relationship
governance elements between vegetable growers and com-
panies. +e results show that there are the two following
causal chains during the transaction between vegetable
growers and companies. “Farmers’ perception of enterprise
behavior determines whether farmers trust the enterprise,
which in turn determines the cooperative relationship be-
tween farmers and companies.” “Farmers’ trust in companies
will affect the degree of cooperation between farmers and
companies, which in turn determines the certainty of farmers’
transactions” [8].
At present, there are many researches on the governance
optimization of supply chain of agricultural products
globally, but most of them are focused on how to alleviate the
effectiveness of opportunistic risks through the optimization
of governance models and mechanisms, while there are
relatively few researches on the governance optimization of
supply chain of agricultural products based on blockchain
embedding. +erefore, based on blockchain digital gover-
nance technology, optimization is made on the governance
of agricultural supply chain, and solutions are given for the
unstable problems caused by low trust between companies
and farmers and imperfect organization and management
system based on the characteristics of blockchain, such as
deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract.
2. Literature Review
+e research on the organization and governance of agri-
cultural product supply chain mainly evolved from the re-
search on agricultural industrial organization. Li and Zhang
(2021) [9] concluded that vertical integration of agricultural
supply chains had a positive impact on the safety of agri-
cultural products through the analysis of economic models.
With the improvement of vertical integration of agricultural
products supply chain, wholesalers and suppliers have im-
proved the security of agricultural products, reduced the
circulation cost of agricultural products, and decreased the
sales price of agricultural products. To promote the close
integration of agricultural product supply chain, Zhou and
Metawea (2021) [10] proposed a computer simulation model
of agricultural product supply chain based on multiagent
system.+rough a series of simulation experiments, detailed
discussion was made on the evolution of the organizational
structure of agricultural supply chain under different gov-
ernment regulations and its impact on the quality and safety
of agricultural products. +e simulation results revealed that
the more long-term contracts between farmers and retailers,
the more conducive to the improvement of the quality and
safety of agricultural products, and the scholars put forward
corresponding countermeasures and suggestions. Qiu
(2017) [11] studied retailers’ pricing and ordering strategies
based on real-time value loss information of agricultural
products. Considering the influence of technology appli-
cation on the circulation of fresh agricultural products, the
scholars constructed the profit model of two stages of fresh
agricultural products supply chain and analyzed three key
parameters. +e results indicated that the upstream and
downstream parts of the supply chain had the consistent
investment interval of technology label cost; under certain
conditions, upstream suppliers bore the cost of technical
labels, and wholesale and retail prices were determined by
incremental delivery.
By comparing the relevant literature, it can be found
that, in terms of theoretical research, Chinese researchers
still focus on the theory of new institutional economics. +e
research on transaction governance and relationship gov-
ernance based on transaction cost economics has just
started. +e research on agricultural product supply chain
from the perspective of transaction cost economics in for-
eign countries has been relatively mature, which is also more
in-depth and detailed, and is gradually expanded to the
combination of various theories.
3. Methods
3.1. Blockchain Data Structure and Functional Framework of
the Blockchain System
3.1.1. Blockchain Data Structure. Figure 1 signifies the data
structure of the blockchain system.
Figure 1 illustrates that the blockchain is composed of a
block header and a block body, and the block header also
includes a timestamp, a random number, a target hash, and a
Merkle root. +e Merkle root is generated by the data
structure of Merkle tree and counted in the head of the
block, of which the value is unique.+e blocks are connected
in time sequence to form a blockchain. Each blockchain is
connected by the address information of the previous block
in the block header, and each transaction can be recorded in
2 Scientific Programming
the block body by the Merkle tree structure key, finally
forming a data chain with comprehensive transaction rec-
ords [12, 13].
3.1.2. Overall Functional Architecture of the Blockchain
System. With the continuous development of digital tech-
nology, the data structure of blockchain is constantly being
updated. From the earliest distributed accounting system to
Ethereum to the current alliance chain, it can be found that
blockchain is constantly being merged with digital tech-
nology. Although there are some differences in specific
applications among different blockchains, their overall ar-
chitectures are basically the same [14]. Figure 2 shows the
overall functional framework of the system.
3.2. StabilityAnalysis of SupplyChain ofAgricultural Products
under Different Organizational Modes
3.2.1. Stability Game Analysis under the Organization Mode
of “Company and Farmer”. Under this mode, the company
signs long-term contracts with farmers. Based on the
“company and farmers” mode, it can not only solve the
supply problem of raw materials for agricultural products
but also increase the sales volume of farmers’ agricultural
products. However, there are some problems that need to be
solved urgently, such as the low trust between companies
and farmers, which leads to frequent defaults between both
parties. In this mode, the game relationship between the two
parties is very obvious, and the trust relationship between
the two parties will directly affect the development of the
company and farmers [15]. +is problem will be analyzed in
detail below. Before the concrete analysis, it is assumed that
when farmers and companies conduct transactions, both
parties of the transaction are rational transactions, the
purpose of which is to enable them to obtain greater benefits.
Before trading, the quantity of agricultural products traded
by both parties has been stated in the contract, which is set as
V, and the prices of agricultural products will fluctuate
accordingly different market conditions. +e prices of ag-
ricultural products in good and better market conditions are
set as Pg and Pb, respectively. +e price in the purchase of
agricultural products of farmers is set as Pf, the production
cost of farmers in the production of agricultural products is
expressed as C1, and the logistics cost of companies is
represented by C2. Farmers will hand over the quantity V of
agricultural products to companies for processing and sales,
and finally the money profits obtained by companies are
referred to by M, where Pg >Pf>Pb. +e probability of
default by both parties and the amount of compensation to
be paid after default are set as R and L, respectively [16]. As
the default of an enterprise in the transaction process will
have a certain impact on the reputation of the enterprise, the
loss brought by the subsequent development of the enter-
prise is set as D. When the market develops well, the benefits
of both parties of the transaction are as shown in Figure 3
[17].
As Figure 3 displays, when the overall development of
the market is good, companies will make greater profits by
choosing to abide by the contract, while farmers will make
their choices by comparing the benefits they have obtained
under the conditions of abiding by the contract and
breaching the contract. +e situation arises as
VPf − C1 >VPg − C1 − Lr. (1)
Namely,
Lr>V Pg − Pf􏼐 􏼑. (2)
In equations (1) and (2), V expresses the amount of
agricultural products; Pf represents the order price of ag-
ricultural products; C1 denotes the production cost of
farmers; Pg refers to the price of agricultural products when
there is more benefit in the market; L stands for the com-
pensatory payment for breaching of contract; r accords with
the rate that compensatory payment will be paid.
+en, the farmers’ profit from breach of contract is
greater than that from keeping the contract. Hence, farmers
will choose to default.
When the overall development of the market is poor, the
benefits of both parties to the transaction are as shown in
Figure 4.

As Figure 5 signifies, in the case of poor overall market
development, farmers will make greater profits by choosing
to keep the contract, while companies will make their choice
by comparing the benefits obtained by keeping the contract
and breaching the contract. +e situation arises as follows:
M − VPf − C2 <M − VPb − C2 + Lr. (3)
Namely,
V Pf − Pb􏼐 􏼑>D + Lr. (4)
In equations (3) and (4), M represents the gain of
processing and selling V agricultural products; C2 expresses
the logistic and production cost of enterprises; Pf refers to
the order price of agricultural products; Pb refers to the price
of agricultural products when there is less benefit in the
market; L stands for the compensatory payment for breach
of contract; r accords with the rate that compensatory
payment will be paid; D expresses the future discount losses,
which will be led by the reputational losses suffered by
enterprises, if they breach the contract.
+en, if the profit obtained by the enterprise’s breach of
contract is greater than the profit obtained by keeping the
contract, the enterprise will choose to default.
+e above analysis illustrates that the following aspects
will influence the cooperative relationship between com-
panies and farmers: first, the price fluctuation of agricultural
products, and second, the cost of default, such as the
probability of compensation and the amount of loss after
default. +e price fluctuation of agricultural products is
mainly affected by the external environment, namely,
market environment. From that perspective of default cost,
because the number of farmers is large but the scale of their
property is small, once the amount to be paid for breach of
contract exceeds the scope of farmers’ acceptance, farmers
will think passively before participating in the supply chain
organization, so the default amount should not be too large.
Additionally, the value of compensation probability r is
mainly affected by transaction costs such as negotiation
ability and litigation cost of both parties. However, because
the price of agricultural products is relatively low, the value
of agricultural products is often lower than the transaction

execution cost, and both parties to the transaction will
consider this factor and give up default during the trans-
action, so the probability of compensation is very low.
Generally speaking, the stability of the organization mode of
“farmers and companies” is relatively poor.
Time Impression Company, also known as Shaanxi Time
Impression Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd., is engaged in
online sales of agricultural and sideline products, storage,
sales, and industrial information services of kiwifruit, as well
as special products and dry fruit and fresh fruit acquisition
and sales business. +e operation mode of the enterprise is
“company + farmer.” It mainly cooperates with farmers in
signing of planting acquisition contracts, where the enter-
prise puts forward a series of crop process requirements for
farmers. Farmers grow products according to requirements
of the enterprise, and the latter finally purchases products at
market prices in the acquisition. +e whole process from
orchard to market is divided into several stages, and the
scope of responsibility is delimited. Time Impression
Company began to implement cooperation with farmers
from 2010, mainly in the way of order acquisition during
2010-2011; in the way of order acquisition, technical
training, and demonstration guidance during 2011–2013;
and in the way of brand building, marketing, and integrated
service system during 2014–2016.
3.2.2. Stability Game Analysis under the Organizational
Mode of “Company, Intermediary Organization, and
Farmer”. +e members of intermediary organizations in
this mode are mostly local farmers, so the trust between
intermediary organizations and farmers is high. +erefore,
when analyzing this mode, the game relationship between
farmers and intermediary organizations is ignored inten-
tionally, and analyzation is made only on the game between
companies and intermediary organizations [18].
Before the analysis, the following assumptions are made:
in order to ensure that both parties can get the maximum
benefits, both parties are rational in the transaction process.
+e number of agricultural products traded is set as V, the
price of agricultural products is represented by Pf, and the
prices of agricultural products are referred to by Pg and Pb,
when the market environment is good or bad, respectively,
where Pg > Pf>Pb.+e cost of the intermediary organization
is C1, and the cost of the enterprise in the transportation
process is C2. Farmers hand over V quantity of agricultural
products to the enterprise for processing and sales, and
finally the money profit obtained by the enterprise is set as
M, and the probability of default and the amount of com-
pensation to be paid after default by both parties are set as R
and L, respectively. +e losses caused to the development of
companies or intermediary organizations are set as D and G.
Figure 5 indicates the benefits of both intermediary orga-
nizations and companies, when the overall market devel-
opment is good [19].
As Figure 5 presents, when the overall development of
the market is good, companies will make greater profits by
choosing to abide by the contract, while intermediary or-
ganizations will make their choices by comparing the

contract and breaching the contract. +e situation arises as
equations (5) and (6) [20] show
VPf − C1 <VPg − C1 − Lr − G. (5)
Namely,
Lr + G<V Pg − Pf􏼐 􏼑. (6)
In equations (5) and (6), V refers to the amount of the
agricultural products; Pf indicates the price of agricultural
products in the contract; Pg represents the price of agri-
cultural products when there is more benefit in the market;
C1 denotes the cost of the agricultural products purchased by
intermediary organizations; L expresses the compensatory
payment for breach of contract; r accords with the rate that
compensatory payment will be paid; G stands for the future
discount losses, which will be led by the reputational losses
suffered by intermediary organizations with certain size. +e
profit obtained by the intermediary organization’s breach of
contract is greater than the profit obtained by keeping the
contract, so the enterprise will choose to default.
When the overall market development is poor, the
benefits of both intermediary organizations and companies
are presented in Figure 6.
+rough the above analysis, the results show that the three
following aspects will affect the cooperative relationship
between companies and intermediary organizations: first, the
price fluctuation range of agricultural products, second, the
probability of compensation, and third, the loss caused by
reputation damage after default to the future development of
companies and intermediary organizations. +e price fluc-
tuation of agricultural products is mainly affected by the
external environment. Compared with the organizationmode
of “company and farmer,” the number of orders has been
greatly increased due to the addition of intermediary orga-
nizations, and the order value has exceeded the cost required
by default litigation, so the probability of winning compen-
sation has been greatly improved.
3.3. Mechanism Analysis on Governance Optimization of
Agricultural Products Supply Chain Based on Blockchain
Technology. According to the analysis of “ company and
farmer” and “company, intermediary organization, and
farmer” in Section 2 and the understanding of new insti-
tutional economics, it can be found that the agricultural
products supply chain is constantly evolving in the way
illustrated in Figure 7.
Institutional factors such as asset specificity, uncertainty,
and transaction frequency play an important role in the or-
ganizational structure of agricultural products supply chain.
Figure 8 displays three important factors of governance
of agricultural products supply chain based on blockchain
data technology.
3.3.1. Blockchain Optimizes the Network Organization
Structure of Supply Chain of Agricultural Products.
Supply chain of agricultural products is a very complicated
business system, and its main components include
consumers, farmers, companies, supervision institutions,
and cooperatives. Business entities not only have certain
dynamics and randomness but also have certain constraints
[21, 22]. +erefore, certain requirements for the governance
structure of blockchain are also put forward, so that it can be
coupled with the governance structure of agricultural supply
chain. Figure 9 signifies the specific structure.
As a decentralized and distributed database technology
under collective maintenance, blockchain can save a lot of
intermediary costs in reality. +is peer-to-peer trading
method with equal rights and obligations for each node
eliminates the hierarchical relationship derived from the
traditional central governance structure to the surrounding
radiation. +erefore, the advantage of blockchain embed-
ding in traditional organizations is to guide the “dein-
termediation” of traditional intermediaries and transaction
settlement systems, improve transaction efficiency, and re-
duce transaction costs.
+e traditional agricultural supply chain is a distributed
network chain structure composed of enterprises, farmers,
distributors, regulators, consumers, and other participating
entities. Due to the characteristics of agriculture, the par-
ticipants of agricultural supply chain are distributed in space
and time dimension, and the traditional centralized trans-
action structure can easily add the cost of information
processing and the degree of information asymmetry,
resulting in higher transaction costs. +e distributed and
decentralized characteristics of blockchain are coupled with
the distributed network organization of agricultural product
supply chain. +e agricultural product supply chain em-
bedded in the blockchain can use the point-to-point in-
formation and value transmission network architecture
based on the blockchain P2P network to trade, thereby
changing the centralized governance of agricultural product
supply chain governance. Blockchain technology embedding
can transform the original “series” organizational gover-
nance structure of agricultural product supply chain into a
flat “parallel” organizational governance structure. +e
participants can realize the direct exchange of economic
factors in the agricultural product supply chain system based
on blockchain and form the technical support of “dein-
termediation” in the agricultural product supply chain or-
ganization, thus further reducing the transaction cost.
+e governance of agricultural product supply chain
includes complex contents, such as the docking of external
market transactions, the collaboration among organizational
members, and the hierarchical governance within members.
+e blockchain can be divided into public chain, alliance
chain, and private chain according to the degree of openness.
Public chain refers to the blockchain where anyone can join,
read data, participate in the consensus process, send
transactions, and obtain effective confirmation at any time;
alliance chain refers to the blockchain where consensus
process is controlled by preselected nodes, allowing only
designated node users to account for and modify blockchain
data, which can be regarded as a “partially decentralize”
blockchain; private chain refers to the blockchain that the
written permissions are controlled by an organization or
institution, whose data processing speed is far better than
6 Scientific Programming
public chain and alliance chain. Considering the processing
speed and the privacy of book access, many enterprises
choose private chain technology at the level of corporate
governance. Agricultural products supply chain can flexibly
use cross-chain, public chain, alliance chain, private chain,
hierarchical cloud mechanism, and other technologies to
deal with the participants of agricultural products supply
chain dynamically and form a more matching blockchain
and the network chain coupling mapping of agricultural
products supply chain.

3.3.2. Blockchain Improves the Contract Completeness of
Supply Chain of Agricultural Products. When constructing
the contract theory, the relevant scholars found that there
were some differences in the information about the quality
and sales volume of agricultural products owned by both
parties to the contract, and, in the whole process of trans-
actions between both parties, irrational transactions might
occur between both parties. +erefore, it is very difficult to
clarify all the rights and obligations that both parties need to
perform when conducting transactions through the clauses
in the contract, and this will increase transaction costs
[23, 24]. +erefore, incomplete contracts are ubiquitous in
the transaction process of both parties, and the main
transaction costs brought by incomplete contracts include
the three following points: First, because there are relatively
many trading subjects involved in the supply chain of ag-
ricultural products, the cost of signing contracts is relatively
high. Second, because there are few “objects” contents to be
standardized when the subject of agricultural products trade
enters into a contract, the cost to supervise the imple-
mentation of the contract is higher than the trading target of
agricultural products. +ird, natural disasters and market
risks will have a great impact on the production of agri-
cultural products, and both natural disasters and market
risks have unpredictability, resulting in higher information
and cognitive costs [25].
Incomplete contracts and transaction costs are the
sources of organizational and governance problems, while a
considerable number of scholars believe that, when solving
the problems caused by incomplete contracts, a new gen-
eration of technologies such as blockchain can be embedded.
Figure 10 explains the specific structure.
3.3.3. Blockchain Optimizes Organizational Trust of Supply
Chain of Agricultural Products. +e root cause of the breach
of contract between the two parties is not the incomplete
contract but the speculative behavior. Companies, farmers,
intermediary organizations, and other participants in the
supply chain of agricultural products may realize their own
goals by relying on other parties violating the rules in order
to realize their own interests in the transaction process, and
the stronger the asset specificity is in the supply chain of
agricultural products, themore likely the trading subject is to
be “locked up,” and the more likely it is to have speculative
behavior.
All the problems in the supply chain of agricultural
products, such as high uncertainty, speculative behavior, and
limited rationality of trading subjects, will lead to the
emergence of organizational and governance problems. An
effective way to overcome speculative behavior and enable
the trading subjects to cooperate for a long time is to im-
prove the trust of both parties. Interpersonal trust can solve
problems such as difficulty in quantifying transaction costs
and unclear property rights in supply chain of agricultural
products caused by incomplete contracts.
Blockchain based on digital technology can not only
make the transaction information transparent but also make
it automatically execute the contract contents through
intelligent contracts, to avoid the speculative behavior that
the transaction subjects improve their own interests by
deception in the transaction process. Figure 11 shows the
specific structure.
3.3.4. 4e Principle of the Agricultural Product Supply Chain
Governance. Agricultural product supply chain gover-
nance is a very interdisciplinary subject, which can be
divided into aspects of agricultural products, supply
chain, and governance. Different combinations, different
perspectives, and different focuses of the three aspects
influence each other, infuse with each other, and then
derive the ever-changing researches and results. From the
perspective of agricultural products, the different bio-
chemical characteristics of agricultural products, regional
agricultural production, farmers’ different preferences,
and cultural attributes of different aspects of the change
factors into the subject of agricultural supply chain
governance will form a new perspective of research.
+erefore, with the deepening of research, scholars’ re-
searches show gradually more specific trends, such as
focusing on the supply chain management of some ag-
ricultural products, comparative analysis of supply chain
management of different agricultural products, the impact
of agricultural production brought by regional charac-
teristics on the supply chain management of agricultural
products, and the impact of farmers’ various preferences
on the supply chain management of agricultural products,
and these studies show different research results through
different research methods and models. In the past few
decades, with the development of globalization, indus-
trialization, and technology, supply chain has experienced
multiple stages of development, including logistics
management stage, value-added stage, network chain
stage, and emerging supply chain business stage, and both
its external form and internal mechanism have undergone
great changes. From the perspectives of supply chain
logistics, capital flow, and information flow, the research
on agricultural product supply chain governance derives
many research topics such as agricultural product supply
chain finance, agricultural product quality and safety
governance, and information sharing under agricultural
product supply chain. From the perspective of gover-
nance, researches are more consistent with the develop-
ment logic of new institutional economics. With the
continuous enrichment of the content of new institutional
economics, the research contents, and achievements of
agricultural product supply chain organization, contract
regulation and relationship governance are also constantly

4.1. Analysis of China’s Total Output Value and Total Import
and Export Volume of Agricultural Products. As a big agri-
cultural producer, China’s gross agricultural output value
has exceeded the trillion yuan mark at the end of last
century. With the steady growth of gross agricultural output

value, China’s agricultural production and management
level are also steadily improving. Figure 12 presents the total
output value and growth rate of China’s agricultural
products in recent years.
As Figure 12 shows, China’s gross agricultural products
have been increasing since 2012, with the gross agricultural
products of China reaching 11.36 trillion yuan in 2018 and
12.4 trillion yuan in 2019, up 9.1% year-on-year. China, as an
important global producer and consumer of agricultural
products, has increased the proportion of agricultural
products trade in the world agricultural products trade year
by year. It is playing an increasingly important role in the
world’s agricultural trade. With the rapid growth, the
structure of China’s agricultural trade is constantly changing
as shown in Figure 13.
Figure 13 describes that the total of import and export of
agricultural products in China showed a declining trend
from 2014 to 2017. From 2017, the total of import and export
of agricultural products in China began to rise continuously.
In 2018, the total of import and export of agricultural
products was $228.43 billion, and, in 2019, it was $228.43
billion, an increase of 5.7% year-on-year.
4.2. Functional Framework of Supply Chain Governance of
Agricultural Products under the Blockchain Technology Path.
In the process of rapid development of digital technology,
blockchain technology has been continuously integrated
with digital technology to provide more effective solutions
for optimizing the organizational governance system. By
combining different digital technologies, different technical
characteristics can be brought to blockchain products.
However, each blockchain product can be divided into data
layer, network layer, consensus layer, contract layer, and
application layer on the technical path of systematic func-
tional architecture. On the basis of consulting relevant lit-
erature, the overall functional framework of agricultural
products supply chain is reconstructed in view of the existing
problems in the current supply chain of agricultural
products, which can be divided into five parts as shown in
Figure 14.
In order to intelligently identify and track and monitor
the processes and subjects in the supply chain of agricultural
products, the physical layer in Figure 14 is set up, which
includes various digital technologies such as intelligent re-
mote sensing and laser scanning. +rough the integration
with these technologies, the planting, processing, and lo-
gistics information in the supply chain of agricultural
products can be collected. For example, if the sensor is
installed on the agricultural seed machine, the position
information provided by GPS can be used to photograph the
growth of farmland crops, which can be input into the
computer system for further processing and storage of
relevant data.
+e data layer mainly includes many data technologies
such as asymmetric encryption, hash function, and Merkle
tree to store the data in the process of agricultural supply
chain governance. Asymmetric encryption can encrypt data
through a pair of public key and private key; the public key is
open to the whole network, while the private key can only be
used by individuals. +is method can not only protect
personal data privacy and ensure the information stored by
users safely but also clarify the boundaries between the two
parties in the supply chain. Hash function has the charac-
teristics of noninterference and being one-way. Based on
these characteristics, it can ensure that the data in the supply
chain of agricultural products will not be easily tampered

and ensure the authenticity of the recorded data. Merkle tree
is an essential technology when building the block data
structure of blockchain. Its branch nodes can store the
calculated hash value, and the root value corresponds to the
last hash value in recursive calculation, which is recorded in
the block data structure together to ensure that the previous
data can be traced back. +erefore, this technology can be
used when constructing the data traceability system of
supply chain of agricultural products and building the re-
lational database based on the trading network.
+e consensus network layer includes cross-chain
technology for connecting different blockchains, consensus
algorithms such as DPoS and PoW, and P2P network
technology. +e network layer frames the data verification
structure, information dissemination mechanism, and net-
work formation mode among the trading subjects of supply
chain of agricultural products and reshapes the organization
mode of supply chain of agricultural products. Among them,
DPoS, PoW, and other blockchain consensus algorithms can
ensure that the number of general ledgers is consistent when
the bookkeeping rights of each node in the supply chain of
agricultural products organization are the same. +e dis-
tributed ledger formed based on this algorithm can improve
the trust between transaction subjects and make the orga-
nizations in the supply chain of agricultural products form
mutual trust. P2P network technology can ensure that the
trading statuses of each subject equal each other in supply
chain of agricultural products. In this case, the intervention
of third-party intermediary is not needed, and the point-to-
point trading structure among trading subjects is realized,
thus effectively reducing the transaction cost.
Intelligent contract layer includes Multisignature
Technology, Programmable Script Technology, and Turing
Complete Technology. It can transform contracts in supply
chain of agricultural products into computer protocols in
blockchain data structure through program codes. +is
protocol adopts self-verification method and automatically
performs tasks without intervention of intermediary. In
order to make the information exchange, asset management,
and value transfer between trading entities more efficient
and convenient, various data and assets can be flexibly
embedded in smart contracts. It can also be embedded with
intelligent prediction machines and various intelligent al-
gorithms involved in transactions to build an intelligent
system that can analyze the environment and make corre-
sponding decisions.
+e application layer contains various application cases
and scenarios in the supply chain of agricultural products,
which are applied to the specific production process based
on the functions of the above layers. For example, the or-
ganizational credit system of supply chain of agricultural
products is constructed, and the data of the participants’
demand and financial supply are analyzed. +rough the
above analysis, the intelligent functional framework of ag-
ricultural products supply chain based on blockchain can be
obtained as in Figure 15.
4.3. Mechanism Optimization of Supply Chain Governance of
Agricultural Products under Blockchain Technology Path.
All participants in the supply chain of agricultural products
can sign contracts before trading, so that the interests of both
parties can be effectively guaranteed.+e clearer the terms in
the contracts, the more stable the cooperative relationship
between both parties. At present, the commonly used formal
governance mechanism is shown in Figure 16.
In the governance mechanism of agricultural supply
chain, it includes not only formal governance mechanisms
such as contracts but also informal governance mechanisms
such as agreements and exchanges, as shown in Figure 17.
4.3.1. Blockchain Embedding Optimizes the Trust Mechanism
of Supply Chain of Agricultural Products. Because the supply
chain of agricultural products is greatly influenced by the
natural environment, the investment risk is high, the es-
tablishment of trust relationship between trading subjects
can avoid opportunistic behavior to a great extent, and the
improvement of trust between trading subjects can improve
the stability of the supply chain of agricultural products. By
encrypting and transparentizing the data and information,
the distrustful factors in the blockchain can be removed, and
the influence degree of the organization can be reduced by
“information without doubt.” Blockchain can encrypt data
information to ensure the authenticity and reliability of data
and reduce the influence of personal feelings on trust. In
order to effectively deal with the limited rationality among

the trading subjects, there are two main ways to realize
“information without doubt” based on the technology of
blockchain: first, construct the infrastructure of
“information without doubt” based on new information
technology; second, build the digital trust mechanism to
improve the enthusiasm of trading subjects such as com-
panies, farmers, and intermediary organizations.

technology constructed according to the above contents.

programming. Based on reducing costs, its application scope is
broader, and the transparency of the implementation process
greatly reduces the probability of default by both parties. +e

contract does not consider the influence of intermediary or-
ganizations. It can consciously carry out relevant activities
according to the contents of the contract and play a supple-
mentary or even alternative role to the existing rules and
regulations.
In the supply chain of agricultural products based on
blockchain technology, transactions among companies,
intermediary organizations, farmers, and other trading
entities can be transformed into codes by computer algo-
rithms and then evolved into programs, forming computer
protocols and storing them. Economic activities such as
identity authentication and contract transactions can be
completed through intelligent contracts. Figure 20 shows the
specific functional architecture.
4.4. Case Analysis
4.4.1. Case Description. Based on the high-quality black land
of ”BEIDAHUANG Group,” “Shan Liang Taste” integrates a
new generation of information technologies such as Internet of
+ings, blockchain, and big data to serve the whole supply
chain and creates the first rice supply chain system in China
based on blockchain in the form of “consumers+ logistics
system+ trading platform+production base+ farmers.” “Shan
Liang Taste” implements the digitization of agricultural assets.
+e supply chain is split into 1639 business nodes, spanning 3
farms, 9 administration areas, and 33 workstations, signing 249
plots (a total of 24318.98 mu), and covering 1477 plots (a total
of 271223.03 mu), and single land has 17 conventional digital
attributes. “Shan Liang Taste” links the contracted agricultural
land to the network platform, forming the corresponding
programmable assets. Relying on the modernized, standard-
ized, and mechanized production management mode of the
“BEIDAHUANG Group,” various intelligent devices are em-
bedded in all aspects of the supply chain such as rice planting,
production, sales, and after-sales. Collection is made on a series
of data such as soil environment, fertilizer and water use,
seedling information, rice deep processing, storage and
transportation, and sales and distribution in the process of rice
planting. After process screening and algorithm screening, the
data are uploaded to the blockchain to ensure the objective
authenticity of the data.
Based on this, “Shan Liang Taste” realizes the compre-
hensive data mapping of the participants, production, and
circulation, agricultural assets, and trading system of the rice
supply chain in the blockchain network, breaks the data
island, and forms the consistent database of the rice supply
chain based on the blockchain. Specifically, “Shan Liang
Taste” uses blockchain to create a closed-loop autonomous
system and develops APP and digital equipment based on
blockchain in the production and logistics links of rice
supply chain for digital governance.
In the transaction of rice supply chain, on the one hand,
”Shan Liang Taste” makes the best of the financial and
technological characteristics of blockchain to organically
combine the circulation of digital assets of farm land with
bulk grain transactions. In the blockchain environment,
”Shan Liang Taste” forms a confirmed agricultural product
by anchoring with the land of “Shan Liang Farm,” thus
creating a brand grain futures trading scene based on
blockchain “Grain Exchange.” “Shan Liang Taste” anchors
the digital assets of agricultural land with the “Shan Liang
blockchain grain ticket,” a tradeable and mortgageable
digital planting order produced by the plot. Grain ticket is
the only certificate for grain physical delivery in “Grain
Exchange,” and farmland asset securitization is completed
by anchoring grain ticket and real grain.
On the other hand, “Shan Liang Taste” implements
e-commerce sales for consumers. Consumers can delimit a
part of the farm through cloud farms, order one season of
rice produced on the land, and generate orders online with
one button. Farmers can contract the production orders of
land anchored by “Shan Liang Blockchain Grain Ticket”
online through “Farmer Treasure,” thus forming blockchain
futures products of shared farms. After that, through the
closed-loop channel construction and traceability certifi-
cation process of “Shan Liang Taste,” the high-quality grain
with “geographical stamp, time stamp, and quality stamp” is
sent to consumers by express delivery. In June 2018, “Shan
Liang Taste” cooperated with Tencent and issued a “Shan
Liang Blockchain Order” corresponding to the land through
WeChat, which was sold online at the price of CNY 8,000 per
mu of land and 500 kg of high-quality rice to support online
crowdfunding consumption. Ten people could make group
reservations and the goods would be delivered by express

flow of “Shan Liang Taste Sharing Farm.”
Whether it is the blockchain-based commodity trading
or consumer-oriented online orders, “Shan Liang Taste” uses
blockchain-based smart contracts. “Shan Liang Taste” dig-
itizes and programmes the order through script code. Once
the system triggers the threshold, the contract terms will be
automatically executed, and none of participants of the
contract unilaterally have right to cancel or prevent the
contract execution, which effectively solves the contract
credit problem faced by the original rice supply chain. “Shan
Liang Taste” releases the rights, responsibilities, and benefits
of all aspects of the agricultural supply chain transparently
and open in the form of blockchain-based smart contract
terms. Once an order happens in the sales end, intelligent
contracts will automatically allocate revenue to each supply
chain link. +e rice supply chain based on blockchain has
formed a systematic, digital, and intelligent benefit distri-
bution mechanism. +e originally fragmented supply chain
subjects have formed efficient coordination and positive
incentives through algorithms.
“Shan Liang Taste” relies on a new generation of in-
formation technology to create a variety of integrated ap-
plications for specific scenarios of rice supply chain at the
platform level, for example, relying on BEIDAHUANG
Group standardized production, integrated services, and
digital management to create “Shan Liang Stewards,” to
provide integrated services for supply chain participants,
unified breeding, agricultural procurement, production
planning, warehousing acquisitions, logistics, and distri-
bution services; developing “Shan Liang School” to spread
farming skills and knowledge and providing all-round skills
services such as fertilizer and pesticide use and pest control
technology for the new farmers who contracted rice pro-
duction tasks; cooperating with financial institutions to
create “Shan Liang New Finance” and forming a consistent
database based on blockchain with financial institutions.
Based on the big data analysis of the production, processing,
logistics, trading, and consumption of the rice supply chain,
financial services such as borrowing, asset securitization, and
insurance are carried out to solve the problems of opaque
financial information in the agricultural supply chain, re-
dundant intermediaries, and complex business processes
and provide effective protection for the financial needs of
farmers and SMEs in the rice supply chain. Figure 22
demonstrates the scheme of the “Shan Liang Taste” block-
chain network architecture.
4.4.2. Optimization of Agricultural Products Supply Chain
Governance from the Perspective of Blockchain Embedding.
Blockchain is the technology to solve the problem of rice
supply chain. Besides, the underlying technical logic of
decentralization, trust, intelligent contract, and consensus
sharing of blockchain is the core of guiding the project of
“Shan Liang Taste.” “Shan Liang Taste” uses blockchain as
the underlying functional architecture to integrate Internet

other technologies into the framework to optimize the
governance of rice supply chain. According to the functional
framework design of agricultural product supply chain
governance based on blockchain, “Shan Liang Taste” also
adopts similar functional architecture on the technical path:
basic physical layer, data layer, consensus network layer,
intelligent contract layer, and application layer.
+e basic physical layer integrates technologies such as
the Internet of +ings, mobile Internet, big data, remote
control, and data processing. Each node in the rice supply
chain contains much data. +ese data are collected through
various technologies and terminals in the physical layer and
uploaded to the system with communication protocols. +e
whole process mapping of the rice supply chain is completed
in the physical layer. “Shan Liang Taste” relies on the same
cultivation of rice standard with BEIDAHUANGGroup and
uses the Internet of +ings, mobile Internet, and other
technologies to realize the whole process of data collection in
the preparation, production, and receiving links. +e data
layer integrates hash function, distributed database tech-
nology, timestamp, cloud database, Merkle tree, and other
technologies to receive data from the basic physical layer and
unify data format, which is stored in the “Shan Liang Taste”
system. +e consensus network layer adopts the common
consensus algorithms such as PoS and DPoS and the hybrid
consensus mechanism of joint consensus. +e intelligent
contract layer encapsulates the business logic and transac-
tion logic of the code-programmed “Shan Liang Taste”
system, which is a complete intelligent contract. +e ap-
plication layer encapsulates the application logic of specific
cases in the “Shan Liang Taste” rice supply chain based on
the functions of each layer. +e API interface provided by
the underlying blockchain can call the distributed data of
each layer and the resources for consumers, enterprises,
regulators, and trusted service providers to realize the
governance requirements of specific system applications,
such as user authentication, quality inspection and detec-
tion, product traceability, monitoring and early warning,
supply chain finance, and other specific application sce-
narios. Figure 23 signifies the system functional framework
based on blockchain governance for “Shan Liang Taste.”
5. Conclusion
Because the information owned by the trading subjects in
the agricultural supply chain is not completely consistent
and not necessarily completely rational in the trading
process, there is instability in the governance of the agri-
cultural supply chain, which will lead to speculative behavior
of the trading subjects. According to the new institutional
economics theory of blockchain technology and agricultural
supply chain governance, the governance of supply chain of
agricultural products is discussed through literature re-
search, executive analysis, and interdisciplinary research.
+e results are as follows: By analyzing the organizational
structure and stability of two organizational models,
“company and farmer” and “company, intermediary orga-
nization, and farmer,” a deep discussion is made on the
relationship, organizational structure, and manifestation of
trading subjects in the supply chain of agricultural products.
With the rapid development of the new generation of in-
formation technology, such as blockchain, Internet of
+ings, and computer technology, it is possible to com-
prehensively digitize economic activities such as production
and transaction in the supply chain of agricultural products.
