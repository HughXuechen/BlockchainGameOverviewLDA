Abstract—Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), one of the most popular
permissioned blockchains, has recently received attention for
blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT). However, for IoT
applications to handle time-sensitive data, the processing latency
in HLF has emerged as a new challenge. In this article, therefore,
we establish a practical HLF latency model for HLF-enabled
IoT. We first discuss the structure and the transaction flow of
HLF-enabled IoT. After implementing real HLF, we capture the
latencies that each transaction experiences and show that the
total latency of HLF can be modeled as a Gamma distribution,
which is validated by conducting a goodness-of-fit test (i.e., the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test). We also provide the parameter
values of the modeled latency distribution for various HLF
environments. Furthermore, we explore the impacts of three
important HLF parameters including the average transaction
generation rate, block size, and block-generation timeout on the
HLF latency. As a result, this article provides design insights on
minimizing the average latency for HLF-enabled IoT.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since blockchain technology was developed as a novel
solution to ensure data integrity in distributed systems, various
blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications have
recently emerged to address privacy and security vulnerabili-
ties [1]. In the blockchain-enabled IoT applications, delivered
IoT data is appended to the assigned remote blockchain stor-
age. Blockchains can be classified into public (permissionless)
blockchain and permissioned blockchain. In the permissioned
blockchain, according to granting permission for read and
write, there are also two types (i.e., consortium and private
blockchains). The permissioned blockchain has recently re-
ceived much attention in terms of fast transaction process-
ing, privacy preservation, and lower power consumption [2].

Particularly, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF)1, which is hosted by
Linux Foundation and contributed by IBM since 2015, is
gaining popularity [1] as one of the promising permissioned
blockchains. Generally, the permissioned blockchain is less
scalable than the public blockchain [3]. However, HLF can
also have high scalable [4], so due to the scalability and the
benefits of HLF, it has been used for many IoT applications.
As discovered in literature [5]–[8], HLF-enabled IoT ap-
plications include industrial IoT (IIoT), healthcare, wireless
monitoring, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For exam-
ple, HLF is used for 5G IIoT-enabled cloud manufacturing
using fog computing in [5]. In [6], decentralized IIoT data
marketplace is proposed using HLF. For smart healthcare, HLF
is exploited for IoT to share monitored patient vital signs [7]
and to ensure security and privacy for medical data in the
Healthcare 4.0 industry using UAVs [8]. Thus, it is expected
that HLF will be more widely used to securely manage a high
volume of IoT data.
However, in blockchain platforms including HLF, high
latency is still recognized as a major issue [1]. Specifically,
certain IoT applications, which are handling time-critical data,
may have strict latency requirements for making correct and
useful decision [9], and require fast transaction commitment.
For example, vital signs of patients need to be promptly
processed and transferred to smart hospital blockchain net-
works for effective medical care [7]. Therefore, for those
applications, it is important to predict and understand the HLF
latency, prior to their practical implementations. Nonetheless,
in most works on HLF-enabled applications, the HLF latency
is generally not considered or simply ignored, and the latency
characteristics including its distribution have not been fully
explored.
Recently, there have been some works that analyze the
HLF latency [10]–[13].2 Specifically, the latency is defined
and measured based on several theoretical models including
stochastic reward net (SRN) [10], generalized stochastic petri
nets (GSPNs) [11], a hierarchical model based on transaction
execution and validation [12], and a queueing-based model
[13].
However, in all the previous works above, only the average
latency is presented without showing the latency distribution,
and in most works, the theoretical models are not verified in
real HLF. When the latency is measured in real HLF, it is

Kafka/ZooKeeper for consensus.

quite random. This randomness makes challenges in provid-
ing reliable HLF-based IoT systems, such as [7], especially
when the latency-sensitive services are required. When the
IoT service requires to complete the transaction processing
within certain target latency for most of the time, the latency
distribution can be more importantly and usefully used than
the average latency-based results. Furthermore, HLF has a
sophisticated structure, where many network parameters affect
the latency simultaneously, so their impacts on the latency
should be carefully investigated to lower the HLF latency.
In this article, therefore, we establish a latency model of
HLF especially for HLF-enabled IoT, where time-sensitive
data is generally managed. After characterizing the latency
distribution, we also analyze the impacts of three important
HLF parameters (i.e., the block size, block-generation timeout,
and average transaction generation rate) on the HLF latency.
We then discuss how the average HLF latency can be reduced
by setting those parameters properly. The contributions of this
article can be summarized as follows:
• We newly provide the probability distribution of the
HLF latency by performing the probability distribution
fitting on transaction latency samples, which are captured
in real HLF. We also provide the parameter values of
corresponding probability distributions for various HLF
parameter setups. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that provides the distribution of the HLF
latency.
• We develop the latency model of HLF with a new
structure, which is adopted in the latest HLF releases.
Hence, our work is more compatible with current HLF-
enabled IoT, compared to other HLF latency models for
the previous HLF structure.
• We explore the impacts of three main HLF parameters
(i.e., the block size, block-generation timeout, and av-
erage transaction generation rate) on the HLF latency.
Especially, we figure out the existence of the best values
of those HLF parameters that minimize the HLF latency.
This provides some design insights on HLF parameters
to lower the HLF latency for more reliable HLF-enabled
IoT.
II. HLF-ENABLED IOT
In this section, we first describe HLF and HLF-enabled
IoT. We then demonstrate the transaction flow consisting of
three phases, and provide the definitions of some important
parameters in HLF.
HLF is a permissioned blockchain platform for a modular
architecture, which is one of the sub-projects in the Hyper-
ledger Project. In the recent version of HLF, Apache Kafka
and Apache ZooKeeper are adopted for transaction collection
and block generation. Apache Kafka is to generate new blocks
after collecting transactions with the resistance to crash faults,
and Apache ZooKeeper is to manage Apache Kafka nodes
in terms of task coordination, cluster membership, and access
control.
Figure 1 shows a flowchart of HLF transaction processing
(left) and a structure of HLF-enabled IoT (right), where IoT
data are managed in HLF. As shown in the right side of Fig. 1,
generated data are delivered from IoT devices to a base station
(BS) connected to HLF. The receiving BS transmits the data to
HLF as new transactions, and the transactions are processed in
the three phases as shown in the left side of Fig. 1. Specifically,
the transactions are executed by the endorsing peer(s) (i.e.,
a.peer.3) and conveyed to the ordering service. The ordering

3
service generates a new block using the transactions, and the
block is appended to the ledger after validation at each peer.
The transaction processing inside HLF is described in detail
as below.
A. Transaction Flow
As shown in the left side of Fig. 1, HLF appends trans-
actions to the ledger through three phases: endorsing phase,
ordering phase, and validation phase. The processing phases
enable HLF networks not only to support general-purpose
programming languages, but also to remain tamper-proof. In
this subsection, we describe the transaction flow in HLF for
data updates.
1) Endorsing Phase: The endorsing phase is to check
whether a transaction has been well-formed, authorized, and
not been submitted in the past. When a transaction is gener-
ated, the endorsing peers independently execute the conveyed
transaction based on the data in their copied ledgers, and
returns the result to the client. If all of the results are identical,
this means all copied ledgers have the same data for the
targeted one of the transaction (i.e., synchronized). Then, the
transaction is delivered to the ordering service, otherwise,
the transaction is discarded. By doing this, the endorsing
phase can prevent ledger divergence, which results from data
inconsistency among the copied ledgers of the endorsing peers.
2) Ordering Phase: The ordering phase is to generate new
blocks by ordering all transactions chronologically. Note that,
as explained earlier, the ordering service is a node cluster,
where a pre-defined consensus protocol is conducted for block
generation. The consensus protocol is a method to achieve
consensus on block generation among ordering nodes, such
as Kafka/ZooKeeper in HLF. A newly generated block is
transmitted to peers for the validation phase. Here, we focus on
the Kafka/ZooKeeper-based ordering service, which has been
currently the most widely used [9].
3) Validation Phase: The validation phase is the last phase
in which the new block is validated by each peer individually.
In this phase, each peer that receives the block conducts mainly
1) validation system chaincode (VSCC) to check whether the
transactions in the block have been properly endorsed and 2)
multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to check whether
the target data in the copied ledgers still have the same versions
as those in the endorsing phase. The block is appended to the
ledger after the validation at each peer. From the successfully
validated transactions, their data are updated in the ledger.
If any verification is failed, the transaction is marked as an
invalid one and prohibited from updating the ledger.
B. Important HLF Parameters
In this subsection, we define three important HLF parame-
ters, which mainly affect the HLF latency.
1) Block Size (Sb): The block size Sb is one of the con-
figurable parameters of the ordering service. This parameter
defines the maximum number of transactions in one block. In
other words, the block size determines how many transactions
the ordering service can collect the most in one block. The
waiting transactions are promptly exported from the ordering
service as a new block, when the number of transactions in
the waiting queue reaches a pre-defined block size value.
2) Block-generation Timeout (Tb): The block-generation
timeout Tb is another configurable parameter of the ordering
service. This parameter defines the maximum time to wait for
other transactions to be exported as a new block since the
first transaction arrived at the waiting queue. Once the timer
expires, the waiting transactions are included into a new block,
regardless of their number in the waiting queue.
3) Average Transaction Generation Rate (λt): The aver-
age transaction generation rate λt refers to the number of
transactions arrived in HLF per second. Being different from
the two configurable parameters above, this parameter can be
determined by many factors. For example, when an IoT device
conveys data to HLF as transactions, the communication
channel and data generation frequency of the device can affect
this parameter.
III. HLF LATENCY MODELING
In this section, we conduct HLF latency modeling based
on the probability distribution fitting method. We first define
latency types in HLF, and provide the experimental setup
of our HLF networks. For the probability distribution fitting
method, we first capture transaction latency samples from the
HLF networks. We then find the best-fit distribution for each
latency type, and finally provide our HLF latency model. For
evaluating goodness-of-fit of our modeling, we also conduct
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The feasibility conditions
for our latency modeling are discussed with providing the
cases, for which the probability distribution fitting method
does not work well.
A. Latency Types in HLF
Before modeling the HLF latency, we first divide the total
elapsed time of the data in the HLF network according to the
transaction-processing stages, such as the endorsing latency,
the ordering latency, the validation latency, and the ledger-
commitment latency (i.e., the total latency). Note that we
exclude the communication latency spent from an IoT device
to reach the HLF network, as it is more depending on the
communication standard that IoT devices use, and it has
already been explored in many literature.
1) Endorsing Latency: The endorsing latency refers to the
time taken to receive the transaction execution results from
the endorsing peers since a transaction was generated. To be
specific, it is defined as the sum of the latencies for step 1 ,
2 , 3 , and 4 in Fig. 1.
2) Ordering Latency: The ordering latency refers to the
time taken to await until the transaction is exported as a new
block from the ordering service. It is defined as the sum of
the latencies for step 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 in Fig. 1. Note that
the latency for step 6 consists of the consensus time and the
waiting time for other transactions to be released as part of
the new block.
In contrast, the latency for step 8 is the sum of the
transmission time and the waiting time of the released block
for the validation phase. Thus, it may be considered as part

of the validation latency. In this article, however, we include
this latency into the ordering latency, when we depict the
histograms in Figs. 2 and 4. Note that the latency for step 8
can be high if there are many blocks, waiting for the validation.
Hence, in this article, the ordering latency is generally higher
than the endorsing and validation latencies, forming the same
distribution as that of the ledger-commitment latency.
3) Validation Latency: The validation latency refers to the
time taken to validate and commit the block with ledger
update. This latency is defined as the latency for step 9 in Fig.
1. All transactions in the same block are sequentially validated,
but committed to the ledger all together as a batch. Therefore,
they have the identical validation latency to each other. Note
that the validation latency may vary according to peer’s type.
In this article, this latency is measured at the endorsing peer.
4) Ledger-commitment Latency (Total Latency): The
ledger-commitment latency refers to the time taken to com-
pletely process the transaction from the beginning. Thus, it is
the sum of the endorsing, ordering, and validation latencies.
B. Experiment Setup
For the implementation of our HLF network, we exploit
HLF v1.3 on one physical machine using Docker, which is a
software platform to implement a distributed system based on
isolated Docker containers. The machine is with Intel® Xeon
W-2155 @ 3.30 GHz processor and 16 GB RAM. When HLF
is deployed on one physical machine, nodes communicate with
each other through the Google remote procedure call (gRPC)
[4]. In contrast, when HLF is deployed on multiple physical
machines, transactions and blocks can experience the network-
ing latency (i.e., wired communication latency) among the
machines. However, generally, the networking latency is small,
compared to the processing latency in HLF, so our latency
modeling can still be effective even on multiple machines,
which were also validated by our additional experiments with
four machines.3
We bring up a Kafka/ZooKeeper-based ordering service
consisting of four Kafka nodes, three ZooKeeper nodes, and
3When Kafka nodes, ZooKeeper nodes, frontends, and peers are deployed
on four different machines using Docker Swarm for Sb = 10, Tb = 2 [sec],
and λt = 10 [transactions/sec], the measured latency is well-matched with
the Gamma distribution with αt = 1.283 and βt = 2.267.
three frontends that are connected to the Kafka cluster in the
network (i.e., the minimum Kafka and ZooKeeper nodes for
crash fault tolerance). Note that the frontend is not only to
inject transactions from clients into the Kafka node cluster,
but also to receive new blocks, which will be disseminated
to peers. The HLF network has one endorsing peer and two
committing peers.4
We perform 10 test runs for one experiment setup, and each
test run includes 1,000 transaction proposals transmitted. All
proposals attempt to update a key-value set, using appropriate
parameters for the changeCarOwner function defined in the
Fabcar chaincode5. Each of the equipped frontends has an
equal probability of being selected to relay a transaction from
our client to the Kafka node cluster, and to make a new block
propagated. Note that all proposals in one test run do not
access the same key-value set. Hence, we do not consider
MVCC violation during the validation phase in this article.
Transactions are generated at the average rate of λt [transac-
tions/sec], whose arrival model is a Poisson process.6 At each
iteration of test runs, we not only vary the average transaction
generation rate λt, but also measure the endorsing, ordering,
validation, and ledger-commitment latency in order to analyze
the impact of increasing λt. Note that Sb and Tb refer to the
block size and block-generation timeout, respectively.
C. Latency Modeling
For the latency modeling, we first obtain the histogram for
each latency type defined earlier, and then figure out its best-
fit probability distribution. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the
latency histograms, obtained from the experiments and the
discovered best-fit distributions (red lines) for the endorsing,
ordering, validation, and ledger-commitment latencies. Here,
we use the histogram fitting function (i.e, histfit) in Matlab
4From numerous experiments, we found that our HLF latency model can be
valid with different numbers of nodes (e.g., endorsing, Kafka, and committing
nodes), except for the modeling infeasible cases, discussed later.
5https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.3/chaincode/
fabcar/go/fabcar.go.
6The Poisson process is the most widely used model for the random
data/packet generation as also used in 3GPP [14]. The periodic data generation
is also widely used, especially in the sensor networks. However, it makes the
ledger-commitment latency less random and more predictable, so it is not
considered in this article.

for available 21 distributions, and then determine the best-fit
distribution for each latency type as follows.
1) Endorsing Latency: The best-fit distribution of the en-
dorsing latency Te is the exponential distribution Te ∼ Exp(ζ)
(also see Fig. 2a), whose probability density function (PDF)
and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are defined as
fTe(t) = ζe−ζt, FTe(t) = 1− e−ζt,
where ζ = 1
E[Te]
is the rate parameter.
2) Ordering and Ledger-commitment Latencies: The best-
fit distributions of the ordering latency To and ledger-
commitment latency Tt are the Gamma distribution, To ∼
Gamma(αo, βo) and Tt ∼ Gamma(αt, βt), respectively (also
see Figs. 2b and 2d), whose PDF and CDF are defined as

0 xαi−1 e−x dx is the
lower incomplete Gamma function. Note that αi = βiE[Ti],
where αi and βi are the shape and rate parameters, respec-
tively.
3) Validation Latency: The best-fit distribution of the val-
idation latency Tv is the three-parameter Fréchet distribution
Tv ∼ Frechet(α, s,m) (also see Fig. 2c), whose PDF and CDF
are defined as
fTv(t) =

where α, s, and m are the shape, scale, and location parame-
ters, respectively.
Once the best-fit distributions are determined, we estimate
the distribution parameters, such as ζ for the endorsing,
(α, s,m) for the validation, and (αo, βo) and (αt, βt) for the
ordering and ledger-commitment latencies. Specifically, we
use the curve fitting tool (i.e., cftool) in Matlab to obtain the
best-fit parameters of a given best-fit distribution. From Fig.
2, we can see that the discovered best-fit distributions match
well with the histograms, especially with that of the ledger-
commitment latency.
For the ledge-commitment latency, we obtain the best-fit
Gamma distribution parameter pairs of the ledger-commitment
latency for various HLF environments. Detailed parameter
pairs are provided as a supplement on the archival version.7
Note that the parameter ranges, used in this article, are in the
ranges that other works used including [15]. The CDFs of
some empirically measured values and their best-fit Gamma
distributions are then demonstrated in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3,
we can see that the CDFs of the best-fit Gamma distribution
matches well with the empirically obtained ones.
D. Latency Modeling Validation
In order to validate and improve the reliability of our latency
model, we conduct the KS test, which is a general test that
evaluates how empirical and best-fit distributions match well

with each other. If the KS statistics value, generated by the KS
test, is smaller than a critical value, the empirical distribution
can be considered as a well-matched one. Fig. 3 shows the
ledger-commitment latency, when Sb = 10 and Tb = 2 [sec]
for λt = 8, 9, 10 and 11, and the critical value is computed
as 0.0513. Each of their KS statistics values is averaged
over 10 test runs at 0.01 significance level and respectively
computed as 0.0388, 0.0437, 0.0457, and 0.0444. We can see
that they are all smaller than the critical value. Hence, the
test is passed for all the cases, and we can conclude that the
models are reliable. Note that our archival version includes
more numerical data obtained from various HLF environments
and their KS test results as explained earlier.
E. Feasibility Conditions for Latency Modeling
During the modeling process, it is found that there exist
some cases in which histograms of Tt do not fit well into a
known probability distribution. In other words, the probabil-
ity distribution fitting method is not always applicable. We
have discovered two environments that make the probability
distribution fitting method infeasible as follows.
1) Timeout-dominant Block Generation Environment:
When the average transaction generation rate λt is small,
transactions arrive in the ordering phase slowly. In this case,
most blocks are generated when the timer set to Tb expires as
each block is seldom fully filled with transactions (i.e., up to
the amount of block size before timeout). In this case, a large
portion of transactions can have the ordering latency equal
to Tb, resulting in a peak on the ordering latency histogram
around Tb (i.e., 1.2 [sec]), as shown in Fig. 4a. Due to this
peak, the histogram of Tt in Fig. 4b cannot match with any
known probability distributions.
2) Block Size-dominant Block Generation Environment:
When transactions are relatively generated fast (i.e., high λt),
most blocks are filled with transactions up to Sb fast, so blocks

are also generated fast with the full block size at the ordering
phase. In this case, the ordering latency can be small, but there
can be a large load at the validation phase due to the fast block
generation, which makes blocks wait for validation. Hence,
there can be many transactions with long waiting time for the
validation, resulting in long-tail outliers longer than 4 [sec] on
the histogram of Tt in Fig. 4c. This makes it difficult to fit the
latency distribution into any known probability distributions.
Note that the two environments, discussed above, are the
cases where Sb or Tb is too small or large, so a large portion
of transactions experience long latency in the ordering or
validation phase. For delay-sensitive HLF-enabled IoT, such
HLF parameter setups will be generally avoided.
IV. FACING TO BLOCKCHAIN LATENCY: INFLUENTIAL
PARAMETER ANALYSIS ON LATENCY
For HLF-enabled IoT handling time-sensitive data and re-
quiring faster transaction commitment, it is important to design
HLF in the way to minimize the average ledger-commitment
latency. We can see in Fig. 5, the average ledger-commitment
latency varies with different Sb, Tb, and λt. In this section,
therefore, we explore their impacts on the average ledger-
commitment latency. Moreover, we discuss how to optimally
determine the three parameters to minimize the average ledger-
commitment latency.
A. Average Transaction Generation Rate Control
Figure 5 (solid lines) demonstrates the impact of the average
transaction generation rate λt for different Sb and Tb on T t.
Note that our ledger-commitment latency model can also be
applied to high λt cases unless the modeling infeasible cases
happen. From Fig. 5, we can observe two conflicting effects
of λt on T t. First, increasing λt makes transactions exported
from the ordering service faster, so lower T t can be achieved.
For instance, when Sb is 20 and Tb is 1 [sec] (blue line),
T t decreases from 1.6 to 1.49 [sec] as λt increases from 10
to 12. However, T t starts to increase beyond some values
of λt (e.g., for λt > 12 in blue line) because of the fast
block generation, which results in long waiting time for the
validation to each block. In Fig. 5, we can also see that the
optimal λt that minimizes T t increases for larger Sb or Tb (e.g.,
the optimal λt = 10 with Sb = 10, but the optimal λt = 17
with Sb = 20). Increasing the optimal λt with larger Sb or Tb
is mainly to maintain or slowly change the block generation
rate. Hence, the average transaction generation rate should be
well-determined to minimize T t.
Furthermore, in Fig. 5, we can also see the probability that
the ledger-commitment latency is less than 3 [sec], i.e., P[Tt <
3], (dotted line). This probability becomes the lowest when
λt = 9, different from λt = 10 that minimizes T t. Hence, for
reliable IoT services, the latency distribution of HLF should
be importantly considered to determine the HLF parameters,
besides the average ledger-commitment latency.
B. Block Size and Block-generation Timeout Optimization
Figure 6 illustrates the impacts of the block size Sb (red
lines) and block-generation timeout Tb (blue lines) on T t
for empirical results and best-fit distributions. In Fig. 6,
we can see that the average ledger-commitment latency of
the best-fit distributions are well-matched with that of the
empirical results. We can see that the shape of T t has three
trends. Specifically, T t first decreases (i.e., decreasing area)
and increases (i.e., increasing area), and finally saturates (i.e.,
saturating area). We explain the trend of those three areas as
below.
1) Decreasing Area: First, T t decreases with the block size
or block-generation timeout when the block size or the block-
generation timeout are small or short (e.g., Sb < 8 or Tb <
1.5 [sec]). With small block size and short block-generation
timeout, T t is generally high due to the fast block generation
that gives large burden to the validation phase (i.e., step 8
in Fig. 1). Therefore, new blocks gradually stack up in each
peer’s queue for the validation, which leads to long validation
delay. Hence, in this area, having larger block size or longer
block-generation timeout helps to decrease T t.
2) Increasing Area: When the block size or the block-
generation timeout is relatively large (e.g., 10 < Sb < 15
or 2 < Tb < 2.75 [sec]), T t increases with the block size
or the block-generation timeout. In this area, the validation
latency is no longer large. However, transactions need to wait
longer in the ordering phase to be in the form of a block as
the block size or the block-generation timeout increases.

Fig. 5: Effects of the average transaction generation rate λt
on the average ledger-commitment latency T t (solid lines and
left y-axis) for different values of the block size Sb and the
block-generation timeout Tb, and on the probability that the
ledger-commitment latency is less than 3 [sec], P[Tt < 3]
(dotted line and right y-axis).
3) Saturating Area: As the block size or the block-
generation timeout keeps increasing (e.g., Sb > 15 or Tb > 3
[sec]), T t eventually saturates. When the block size is large,
most of new blocks are generated by timeout expiration before
they are fully filled with Sb numbers of transactions. When the
block-generation timeout is long, blocks are also generated
with full size, and increasing the block-generation timeout no
longer affects the latency. Therefore, T t does not change in
this area, even though the block size or the block-generation
timeout increases.
Due to the trend on the impacts on the block size and the
block-generation timeout on T t, it is important to properly
determine Sb and Tb values to lower T t.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This article provides the latency model for HLF-enabled
IoT, where time-sensitive data is generally managed. From
the histograms of the ledger-commitment latency obtained
from our real implementation of HLF, we figure out that the
ledger-commitment latency can be modeled as the Gamma
distribution in various HLF setups. We also conduct the
KS test and verify that our modeling is reliable. Moreover,
we explore the impacts of three important HLF parameters
(i.e., the average transaction generation rate, block size, and
block-generation timeout) on the average ledger-commitment
latency. Specifically, when they are set to be small, the average
ledger-commitment latency is fairly high due to the fast block
generation that causes long validation latency. Hence, the
average ledger-commitment latency decreases as those values
increase, but eventually it increases again since the ordering
latency increases. From those observations, it is shown that
a proper setup of HLF parameters are important to lower
the average ledger-commitment latency. This article can serve
as a useful framework not only to predict the average and
