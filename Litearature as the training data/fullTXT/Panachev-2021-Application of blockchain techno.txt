Abstract: This article deals with the use of Blockchain technology and game approach in the context of the educational 
process in high education institutions. Application of new information technologies and the educational sector general 
digital transformation in conjunction with Blockchain technology and game mechanics allow, on the one hand, to 
increase information systems reliability and, on the other hand, to increase the efficiency of learning the information by 
students. Based on the materials described, the model is developed that can be used for own educational software 
products elaboration. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The education system is a priority area of the state’s internal policy, since economic, social and technological 
development is closely related to the formation, preservation and enhancement of human capital, as well as 
improving the quality of training for specialists. Timely response to global changes (for example, the transition to 
the sixth technological order) contributes to faster adaptation to new conditions of scientific and technological 
development, more efficient modernization of existing processes, the emergence of social and technological 
innovations in universities. 
The sphere of education itself remains rather fragmented (there is no integral system of education), where each 
educational institution provides services at the expense of its own resources. There is also a focus on the market 
economy (the predominance of the service sector, low interest in research and production), low funding [1-3]. 
To solve the problems identified, it is necessary to change the focus of educational programs towards personal 
and meta-subject competencies, build the educational process on the balance of theoretical and practical knowledge, 
introduce modern technologies (blockchain, game approach, etc.) [4-6]. 
The aim of the study is to create a model of a software product containing the features of blockchain technology 
and a gaming approach for further use for educational purposes. 
METHODOLOGY 
Blockchain technologies and a gaming approach fit into the components of innovative development in education 
(educational process development, technical and technological development), and also have the characteristics of 
innovative educational models: the use of games and simulations in training, the use of modern information and 
communication technologies [7, 8]. 
The blockchain is an unchangeable public distributed (decentralized) data registry that allows transactions 
without a single central intermediary (a decentralized network or a peer-to-peer network consisting of nodes - 
individual users). The blockchain is a built-up sequential chain of blocks containing encrypted or open information.

In addition to information, each block stores its own hash sum and the hash sum of the previous block in the chain. 
Blockchain was invented already in the 90s of the twentieth century, but found its application only in 2009 due to 
the advent of the crypto currency Bitcoin. Since then, the technology has found its application in banks, medicine, 
logistics, etc. [9, 10]. 
Figure 1 shows a blockchain technology scheme with highlighted structural elements. 
FIGURE 1. Blockchain technology scheme 
It can be seen from Figure 1 that any block contains the time of its creation in Unix format, the transaction chain 
X1 - Xn in any convenient format, Nonce (the number of iterations of selecting the hash sum of transactions with the 
Proof-of-Work algorithm), the hash sum the block itself and the hash of the previous block. This structure leads to 
the immunity of the contents of the block and allow using available software tools (Golang, Java, JavaScript, etc.) to 
check the validity of the block chain. Also, it increases the security of information in the context of copyright. This 
feature is supplemented using smart contracts - a computer program aimed at ensuring the fulfillment of contractual 
conditions between users in automatic mode [11]. 
Currently, the technology is actively developing. The Committee of the international organization for 
standardization ISO/TC 307 "Blockchain (BC) and distributed registry (DR) technologies" deals with 
standardization issues. However, there are still certain problems related to scalability (exponential growth of data 
volume) and security (personal data protection, stability of cryptographic algorithms) [12]. 
In addition to its use in crypto currencies, blockchain can potentially be used in the field of education. The 
University of Nicosia (Greece) uses technology to manage students' electronic certificates, while the Holberton 
school (USA) stores diplomas in an open decentralized registry [13]. 
The game approach as a way to positively improve the activity of students, their social interaction, and improve 
the quality and productivity of work fits into the concept of innovative educational models. In this case, the game is 
considered not as entertainment, but as a term "serious game" aimed at obtaining skills in the context of a certain 
field of activity (medicine, production, science, etc.) in the form of an interactive narrative [14]. Figure 2 shows the 
relationship between these types of games with the inclusion of a serious game as a phenomenon. Video games tend 
to simplify the game process and avoid reality. In turn, serious games tend more towards relative realism in the 
gameplay. 
FIGURE 2. Connection between video games and serious games [14] 
The Classcraft system [15] is an example of high-quality and successful integration of a classic video game into 
the educational process. Here, a deep gaming educational system is created in which student players choose a hero 
for themselves and travel through the virtual world, studying one or another subject, developing their character and 
100004-2
forming their own knowledge base during the game. In [16] it is stated that the Classcraft system is an addition to 
the existing Tire 1/Universal SEL process of skill formation and development, as well as a tool for implementing 
PBIS. 
The study "Classifying Serious Games: the G/P/S model "[17] provides a model for classifying "serious games" 
G/P/S, which includes the strengths of other models and focuses on gaming and non-gaming aspects of the 
educational process. There is a fundamental difference between regular computer games (video games) and serious 
games – focusing on the gameplay in different contexts. 
The G/P/S model is a classification of serious games in three aspects: Gameplay, Purpose (goal of the game: 
messaging, training, data exchange), Scope (boundaries of the game: market, target audience, etc.). An approximate 
representation of the model is shown in Figure 3 below: 
FIGURE 3. Presentation of the G / P / S Model [17] 
RESULTS 
The use of blockchain technologies, the principles of gamification in the aggregate will allow adding up 
efficiency when creating software tools aimed at the educational process. 
The integration model of the above technologies can be represented as a three-level system: 
1. The first (lower) level. A decentralized network that provides communication between independent nodes.
Communication can occur using any system (for example, gRPC). 
2. The second (middle) level. This level is represented by a blockchain connected to the lower level, forming a
decentralized register of information managed using a DHT (distributed hash table of user addresses) and any 
DBMS. 
3. The third (upper) level. The system level contains the game platform, an add-on above the previous two levels.
User data inside the game is stored in a decentralized storage and is not subject to change, which ensures the safety 
of data and permanent confirmation of ownership of a particular resource in the game. 
Further work on the model is appropriate because of the large potential for use in education. 
CONCLUSION 
The article discusses blockchain technology and the gaming approach in the context of the educational process in 
higher educational institutions. The use of new information technologies and the general digital transformation of 
the education sector in conjunction with blockchain technologies and game mechanics allows, on the one hand, 
increasing the reliability of information systems within educational institutions, and on the other, increasing the 
100004-3
efficiency of students learning information. Based on the materials described, a concept model was compiled that 
can be used for our own educational software products. 
Further work on the model is appropriate because of the large potential for use in education.
