Evolving Regulatory Frameworks:
Blockchain as a Form of Trust—
Comparative Evidence
Alfio A. Puglisi
Abstract Firms and governments are interested in regulatory experiments in order
to minimise compliance costs and improve business and regulatory efficiency.
Blockchain presents many hopes for achieving the aforementioned objectives but
presents many risks in the area of privacy and cyber risks. Considering its regulatory
and business organisational features, it can be considered a regulatory tool that
supplements, complements and substitutes law. In the area of AML, Blockchain
can be employed to verify, validates and transfer information between two or more
stakeholders. The aim of this chapter is to understand the organisational features of
the four most prominent Blockchain networks and understand how and when firms
and their associated Blockchain-based system operate. In order to do so, this chapter
compares Blockchain features with national and international current regulatory
frameworks for Blockchain. Results show that Blockchain does not undermine the
role of the government, but it reinforces its role when the rule of law is weak or
absent. Moreover, considering that technological actors can evolve into a digital
sovereign, governments need to carefully assess the risks of this novel technological
framework and set the right rules of the games that benefits all consumers and
businesses.
1 Introduction
Blockchain technology has relaunched the debate how and when technology can be
used for legal and administrative purposes thanks to its organisational features. If the
internet provided a solid infrastructure for connecting individuals, Blockchain tech-
nology is creating a spectrum of novel economic and legal structures. They are
incorporated in innovative organisational structures of firms in the form of smart
contracts or self-executed legal code. In the Blockchain environment, legal

objectives span from anti-money laundering (AML) measures to regulatory tools to
strengthen the integrity of financial markets.
What is Blockchain? Broadly speaking, Blockchain is an open-source technolog-
ical infrastructure which allows the exchange of information and wealth, allowing
two or more individuals to interact into a virtual world of finance with or without a
centralised authority, with or without formal and informal institutions. In the regu-
latory and legal circles, Blockchain is considered a form of “trust architecture” that
supplements, substitutes and complements existing forms of law.1 Advocates of
Blockchain and its related applications would argue that Blockchain have useful
applications when governments control or rule of law is absent,2 allowing citizens,
firms and governments to operate within a relatively safe environment to conduct
business, administer territory, provide governments services and the list goes on.
Governments and firms have started regulatory experiments to understand how to
use Blockchain. Blockchain can also serve for AML compliance as a verification and
validation mechanism allowing consumers to upload their information, being stored
on the Blockchain and shared across relevant institutions. In this regard, Blockchain
can emerge as a self-regulatory tool for organisations to coordinate their activities3
and can supplement, complement and substitute law. In becoming a regulatory tool
for AML or other government services for regulation and supervision, Blockchain
can exercise digital sovereignty, the exercise of power through various channels
from the provision of technological products and services to the deployment of data
and legal code at the expense of consumers. These self-regulatory objectives are not
limited to associations, firms or industry groups and I argue that Blockchain itself
represents a form of self-regulation. This has broader societal issues regarding
market monopoly, lock-in of consumers, fairness of actors involved in the industry,
with the latent detrimental effect on reducing consumer choices and their freedom.
The aim of this chapter is to explain when and how Blockchain technology
supplements, complements and substitutes law. It cognizes the operational aspects
and design of Blockchain technology, in particular the diverse architectural regula-
tory approaches taken in Blockchain technology for financial services in the area of
crypto-assets, capital markets, token sales, digital identity and derivatives. This
paper focuses on the technological infrastructure and the technological companies
who operate in this space and exercise digital sovereignty. Digital sovereignty is the
outcome of a coordination game played by a wide range of transnational communi-
ties with diverse purposes and missions. They exercise digital sovereignty in their
regulatory and business functions rooted on substituting, complementing and adding
law. This chapter examines why and when firms supplement, substitute or comple-
ment law by engaging with Blockchain technology either by joining industry groups
or developing their own Blockchain infrastructure to address regulatory uncertainty.
I employ a cross-country comparative approach by analysing global regulatory

approaches employed by national governments and private Blockchain projects and
the governance of eight Blockchain projects such as E-dinar, Barbados Central Bank
digital currencies, Petro-backed digital currencies.4 I compare the regulatory archi-
tecture of the four most prominent Blockchain infrastructures such as Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Ripple and R3 in order to understand how traditional regulatory organi-
sations are developing their mission and objectives in light of an emerging distrib-
uted ledger economy. This allows me to understand when and how Blockchain
supplements, complements and substitute law in national and international settings.
Surveying the regulatory technological perimeter, projects in Blockchain technology
comprises of private, public, private-public partnerships, whereas the Blockchain
industry comprises of technological companies, exchanges, wallet custodians, smart
contracts company, payments companies, government companies. By assessing the
governance of these projects and companies, technocratic and delegated governance
materialise, in which self-executed law and technology are at the core of the
organisation of these firms and aim to create a platform and digital economy by
providing technological tools and law to governments, businesses and consumers.
This chapter adds to the relevant regulatory literature by advocating for a novel
approach which differs from long standing traditions of regulatory scholars5 who
neglected the role of technology in examining political and regulatory order. This
chapter ties regulatory and governance theories, by offering novel insights into the
regulation of Blockchain. Blockchain allows governments and firms to set up
transnational regulatory structures through policy coordination in which technology
plays an important role in mediating individuals’ and governments’ sense of mean-
ing, purpose and value according to code and law. In this fashion, I move from a
conception of monist digital sovereignty like the idea of having a Leviathan
Blockchain trust infrastructure which suffocates pluralism. Instead, I advocate for
pluralism and a normative semi-distributed technological order embedded in tech-
nological and business infrastructures.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. The first section introduces the topic to
the reader. The second section reviews new forms of business and regulation in
Blockchain technology and how Blockchain can serve as a regulatory AML tool.
Moreover, it surveys the relevant literature on trust and confidence two fundamental
pillars of Blockchain technology, contract enforcement mechanisms and digital
governance. The third section sets out the research design and the hypothesis of
this chapter; it theorises how and when Blockchain supplements, complements and
adds law. The fourth part summarises the main results and compares the four most
prominent Blockchain networks with transnational and global Blockchain projects in
the areas of payments, capital markets, digital identity and derivatives. In particular,
it explains how current Blockchain projects can supplement, complement and add
law. The fifth section concludes this chapter and addresses significant risks for
governments, consumers and firms.

2 Blockchain Technology: Digital Sovereignty
and Exchange Without Government
Blockchain seems to facilitate AML compliance by introducing a series of techno-
logical and compliance mechanisms in which consumers can upload their informa-
tion and shared it among a wide group of stakeholders. Blockchain as a regulatory
tool can serve as a mechanism to verify information, accept documentation, and
exchange value and information. Blockchain technology is a designed, developed,
and distributed free software taking into consideration a different set of values,
societal behaviours, and dynamics without a central authority. Blockchain as a
self-regulatory organisation creates and designs a regulatory framework that supplies
complements and substitutes law.
Companies in every industry have started to understand how to apply blockchain-
based solutions to solve business problems,6 especially in those areas where the
financial infrastructure is underdeveloped. A market supported by Blockchain tech-
nology is not fundamentally different from more traditional forms of markets in
which consumers are well identified from users or business physical interactions, but
it poses certain challenges.7 The internet allows firm to access bigger markets, but
also expose customers to millions of potential fraudsters around the world. Promi-
nent challenges8 that governments have faced in the Blockchain environment
include tracking transactions, digital identity of users, cyber-attacks to Blockchain
companies and their associated liabilities. All of these challenges belong not only to
AML protocols that firms need to follow but also for governments that need to
supervise new business models, products and services.
On the topic of digital identity, cryptographic proof and pseudo anonymity
around it, the supervision of these processes represents a challenge for government
and impacted firms. Consumers and firms face a number of challenges when they
need to take legal actions against actors in several countries.9 With the rise of
technology, new forms of trade have emerged which one could not think 20 years
ago such as e-commerce, online banking etc. In this digital environment in which
interactions and exchange occurs on the web, Blockchain technology allows users to
transfer capital without a trusted central intermediary, which could be the govern-
ment. The decentralised infrastructure of Blockchain technology represents both a
barrier for government intervention as well as an opportunity for creating a global
business ecosystem. No higher authority can command the infrastructure to do
anything, verification nodes are distributed around the world going beyond national

territories and creating a transnational world. Technology cannot often tell the
difference between a thief and a legitimate user and its legal national territory due
to the different layers of technological software in which consumers and businesses
operate. In the same manner, Blockchain technology and smart contracts cannot tell
between legal and illegal transactions, although strong design measures can help
machines or distributed automated firms in addressing these problems. Notwith-
standing the shortcomings of this technology, legal scholars, such as Wright and De
Filippi argue that Blockchain “could make it easier for citizens to create custom legal
systems, where people are free to choose and to implement their own rules within
their own techno-legal frameworks”.10 Some activists take this argument even
further “thanks to the Blockchain technology, we have the chance to not only
re-invent governments, but fundamentally replace the nation state”.11 Theorists
such as North (1990) and Stringham (2015) would have argued that exchange
without government is limited to small and simple settings. In particular, North
(1990) p. 12 states that: “realizing the economic potential of the gains from trade in a
high technology world of enormous specialization and division of labour character-
ized by impersonal exchange is extremely rare, because one does not necessarily
have repeated dealings, nor know the other party, nor deal with a small number of
other people.”12 Moreover, he writes “the returns on opportunism, cheating, and
shirking rise in complex societies. A coercive third party is essential”,13 which in the
past would have been under the authority of the government or an established
institution in the private sector. Going beyond these theoretical debates, Blockchain
proves that exchange can occur without government in which resources and assets
are owned, managed and distributed in self-executing economy or platform econ-
omy, formed of polycentric structure of actors with several interests and preferences
for technological services and products. Blockchain allows to operate across several
legal frameworks.14 Scholars have studied and are studying design system to reduce
market failures in these frameworks.15 A key characteristic of Blockchain technol-
ogy is rooted on trust and confidence. Standard market-based activities are grounded
on trust.16 Trust depends on many socio-economic factors and often is considered a
market failure for countries in which there is a high level of corruption or rule of
law.17 Trusting a network can also present vulnerabilities, as people are required to

trust each other with the risk that someone can deviate from its optimal strategy and
act deceitful with the risk that re-building trust in the system is difficult to be
regained. Blockchain architecture aims to address these market failures such as
asymmetric information between market participants as depicted in Fig. 1.
Figure 1 is a stylised regulatory model, built on the analysis of the four most
prominent Blockchain networks. In particular, it shows two companies interacting
with an authority.18 This model assumes that firms have the same incentives and
missions, cheaters must compete against the bulk of the network and the underlying
assumption is the fact that being less honest is a disadvantage. Trusting the network
is an important pillar for the functioning of the Blockchain network. However, in
open-source project such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, developers can exercise excessive
control over the rest of actors in the network due to their mining power. The
interaction between the firms is filtrated through “the state” which represent a
node in the network or a key decision that the network needs to undertake in order

An Authority can be the government, or a regulatory agency. The triangle represents the space of
action, it can be a model of platform economy. Each point in the space represents one user or
stakeholder or a set of users or communities of stakeholders. A state is an immutable object
representing a fact known by one or more nodes in the Blockchain. A contract is an agreement
between two parties, in the blockchain can represent a self-executed smart contract or smart
contract. A protocol is a set of rules of the operators in the Blockchain network. These mechanisms
can be deployed to verify information during AML or KYC protocols

on the two companies. Collaboration across organisational boundaries allows the transfer of
information or wealth.

to process a mechanism. The agreement between the parties occurs according to a
contract or self-executed law between the parties or according to a protocol which
represents a set of rules. This set of rules is followed by all members in the
Blockchain network and can be extended to an ideal AML regulatory model. The
Blockchain infrastructure runs on algorithm which are set by the software developers
who validate the code on the nodes of the network. The nodes in the network
represent checking points, anyone in the network can examine the code, verify the
mechanism. The underlying principle of this infrastructure is trust. Trust can include
vulnerability, undermine privacy, nudge people into decisions that were not intended
or reinforce biases in the network. Similarly, within a self-regulatory framework
based on rule of law, trust is shared among market participants and a central
authority represented by a judge. Checks and balances ensure that the judge is
“super-partes” and operates within his/her/their powers.
In order to address these challenges, firms are building governance schemes
inside and outside their organisations and many firms have looked into applying
Blockchain technology as a regulatory tool to orderly keep the duties and roles of
agents. Thus, the ability to effectively design self-regulatory frameworks and their
associated business and regulatory models depend on the prevailing coercion
constraining institutions, which are those that influence decisions regarding the
acquisition and use of coercive power and the preferences and values of all individ-
uals in the system.19 The design of regulatory organisations often resembles tech-
nocratic and delegated governance in which governments appoint strategic business
leaders or delegate their regulatory functions to technological companies; blockchain
companies operate across several horizontal, vertical and delegated layers of law.20
With this in mind, I argue that technology allows them the acquisition and the use of
coercive power. This is the case because many designed self-regulatory frameworks
reveal information about wealth to those with coercive power.21 Wealth-revealing,
designed, contract-enforcement institutions will be utilized only if coercion-
constraining institutions are such that this information does not undermine the
security of a right, which can be a property right, control of wealth, or control
over a piece of information. Those institutions22 are not only self-regulatory but also
19Please refer to Fig. 1.
20Horizontal layers of law are regulatory framework across jurisdiction who shares similar consti-
tutions and legal principles. Vertical layers of law refer to the intersection of national and
international law. Delegate layers of law refers to when government functions are delegated to
third parties (i.e. private management of tax collection).
21In this case coercive power is defined as the use of force to get an employee of an institution to
follow an instruction. Moreover, in a Blockchains setting, the power to access a particular piece of
information will be shared among several stakeholders and access to that information will be
granted through the use of smart contracts. Little we know about those that have coercive power
will be act according to “the rule of law” or not with the assumption that technology can limit their
power and they can act as benevolent leaders.
22In this context, institutions are defined as Blockchain firms, firms providing Blockchain services
and products to consumers and or public and private clients.

self-enforcing institutions meaning that following the guidelines of these institutions
is the best response of the actors involved in the industry. What emerges is the
concept of self-regulatory organisation which is also a digital sovereign. For the
purpose of this paper, I define a digital sovereign institution an institution that
exercises power by employing self-executed code either in the form of smart-
contracts or within their platform business environment, which is often the case as
a regulatory governance structure of tech firms. Considering the business and
operational models of Blockchain companies and the overall Blockchain infrastruc-
ture as self-regulatory organisation or regulatory tools, companies are both becom-
ing technology companies and self-regulated entities. Companies can use their
technology as a regulatory tool or join associations of firms which will provide
guidelines in using technology. As such, the difference between technology and
code is becoming more blurred. Blockchain can also be used to address the market
failures described above and detect fraud in market transactions.
This also allows to fulfil know-your-customer requirements easier. A blockchain-
based AML platform23 that utilizes smart contracts would be able to use inbuilt
algorithms to automate the process of AML fraud detection. The inbuilt algorithms
would follow processes as depicted in Fig. 2. The figure explains how transactions
occurring within the Blockchain network would be validated across three layers of
control between two access points one in which the transaction is requested and one
in which transaction is requested. This stylised solution to address fraud in the
market allow each market participants such as consumers, governments, firms and
any third parties involved to act as a node and active participant in the Blockchain
network. Moreover, with this implementation of Blockchain a consumer will be
required to undergo this process only once and the information will be stored on the
Blockchain and the consumers could share this information with other companies.
This model also illustrates how in each step of the process, key regulatory formal and
informal institutions will need to access piece of information to fulfil their functions.

2.1 A Novel Approach to Reg-Tech
Widespread failures of ICO, fraud surrounding crypto-currencies and blockchain
companies that do not go beyond the proof-of-concept stage contributed to the
undermining of trust in the blockchain architecture. Stating that blockchain needs
regulatory frameworks begs the question how Blockchain as a self-regulatory
framework work in practice and which problems they aim to address. The aim of a
regulatory framework whether public or private is to create trust between parties and
encourage market integrity.24 In this scenario, law enhances confidence between
parties and reduce the probability of loss and or fraud in a transaction.25 Law
formalises relationships between market participants and can limit misunderstand-
ings, develop first self-regulatory in a specified geographical area which eventually
will enter the national legal code. Scholars have argued that law also shapes the
behaviour of firms and consumers.26 The legal system exists as a commitment
mechanism for individuals to align private interest to private goals (Baldwin
2014). It is important to note that the legal system works if only the individuals
trust the system and the actors involved. However, in countries where rule of law is
poor, technology and a stylised platform economy seems to address these market
failures. Institutions such as governments of business firms are indispensable for
trust. What is trust? Trust comes from the interaction between two or more parties,
from the predictability that the agent with whom one is conducting business, or it is
interacting is reliable, from the design of an economic structure. As such, technology
with its algorithms and self-defined rules embedded in software and code make it
easier to coordinate actors’ decisions and preferences and technology has been
increasingly used in self-regulatory frameworks. Technology and law can promote
trust, but also can undermine it.27 Borrowing concepts from institutional economics
and the theoretical framework developed by Werbach, I argue that self-regulation is
grounded on two key elements: contract enforcement and contract coercion. Self-
regulatory measures of contract enforcement and contract coercion are often forgot-
ten in AML protocols, however within a Blockchain framework, they would be
embedded in the business model of firms as well as in their regulatory perimeter.
Scholars have mainly focus on coercion constraints “the range of transactions in
which individuals can commit to keep their contractual obligations”.28 Moreover,
these studies have mainly focused on self-regulation as the result of cooperative
games. With the rise of technology, a platform either in the form of Blockchain or
distributed system manage the preferences, objectives and decisions of actors and
could support firms to fulfil their AML requirements.29 Following Thomas Hobbes,

29Hofman et al. (2021).
Evolving Regulatory Frameworks: Blockchain as a Form of. . . 219
credible enforcement institutions depend on the possibility of the governing author-
ity of coercion. As Greif has detailed in his book check and balances on the authority
of the state and separation of powers is important to ensure confidence among market
participants. Blockchain allows to distribute the authority across different actors and
this feature is very important to be considered for AML requirements.30 Thus, trust
requires institutions and institutions requires governance in order to operate cross-
border and enforce rules.31 Contract enforcement institutions (spontaneously)
develop in the initial phases of market development as unintended and unforeseeable
outcomes from the pursuit of individual interests32 and rent-seeking behaviour.33
Self-regulatory frameworks are also the result of incomplete-contracts, contracts can
be the result of market failures in the forms of asymmetric information and or
negative externalities. In particular, Oliver Haart, Bengt Holmstrom, Jean Tirole
and other incomplete-contracts theorists explained that business practices around
contracts (Hart 1988). They also argued that contracts may be dynamic arrangement
that may necessarily require changes to address mutual arrangements and when a
government is involved “immutability” may mean that socio-economic system is
reluctant to legitimate political order. This is a vulnerable point, due to the fact that
users can betray your trust (Werbach 2018b) or may lose confidence into technology
or the system.
Confidence often emerges from trust but the distinction between the two concepts
is often deceiving. Confidence is a different concept from trust;34 confidence can be
considered a feature of trust within a system or framework. Confidence often comes
from our own impression and implies a lack of agency or authority between two or
more parties.35 In a utopian technological world, trust emerge into the institutions in
which we decide to rely upon, and confidence lies in the technology.36,37 Confidence
is based on a consensus mechanism and technology may improve confidence by
increasing transparency. Confidence and trust allow business, technological and
regulatory models to be improved and developed. Technology is built into peer-to-
peer network with several stakeholders who have conflicting interests and missions.
Thus, Blockchain requires several models of governance. Two main models of
governance emerge (1) delegated governance and (2) technocratic governance.
30AML compliance protocols involve many firms and institutions.

33The covid-19 crisis has increased the demand for digital services and products. Blockchain can
facilitate these digital transactions. The covid-19 crisis has also highlighted rent-seeking behaviour
of digital platforms. These arguments are beyond the scope of this chapter, but they are worthy to be
mentioned.

The first model denotes the market together with the government to design a set of
rules, norms and protocols over transnationally territory in which governance occurs
through public-private partnerships and decisions are reached through consensus.
The second model is the outcome of a top-down model of governance in which
decisions are implemented through an institution that serves the interests of their
users. In many Blockchain projects these differences are well visible however, based
on the Blockchain structure of substituting, complementing and adding law, these
models of governance are dynamic and aims to address market failures in the market.
In these legal processes, governance operate across several layers of law. Blockchain
seems to fit the gap in the regulatory frameworks as a self-regulatory organisation in
horizontal, vertical and networked legal systems. In order to envision governance
frameworks in Blockchain, I focus the analysis on policy coordination in which
actors feel the need to cooperate in order to conduct business, exchange information
and operate transnationally.
3 Research Design
3.1 Data
The global Blockchain industry represents a novel research field. Interest for a
Blockchain infrastructure has grown both in the private and the public sector with
governments and firms experimenting new models of governance and new models of
trust. Moreover, the cumulative total investment in Blockchain amounts to US$ 1.6
billion as 2017 and is constantly growing.38 Many new technological firms were
established in the industry and several firms from allied industries (such as banks or
payments providers) entered the industry and were confronted with the task of
establishing a reputation after the 2008 financial crisis. Many financial firms are
experimenting with Blockchain technology to reduce costs and improve compliance
of their business models. I apply Werbach’s Blockchain legal risk assessment, and I
test his regulatory theory by looking at the operational infrastructure of four
Blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, R3 and Ripple and ten Blockchain projects
in the area of capital markets, digital identity, payments and digital assets. I chose the
most eight prominent projects39 and public and private Blockchain networks, with
Bitcoin counting more than 5 million users, whereas Ripple counting more then
100 members.40 I compare them with the functions and characteristics of current
legal frameworks developed by national governments, firms and trade associations. I

39These projects were developed by national governments, central banks, leading Blockchain
companies and have been fully tested and few of them implemented. The scale and size of these
project is significant, attracting the attention of policy makers and regulators.

employed four criteria to assess the projects and the information of institutions under
scrutiny: (1) analysis of their governance structure, (2) the business model, (3) the
board structure, (4) involvement of regulatory bodies in the project. On the analysis
of the governance structure, I looked at the procedural dimension of governance
which looks at the activities of private transnational actors, the structural dimension
of governance which distinguish norms, rules, network and actor constellation and
the functional dimension of governance which highlights the relationship between
material and ideational result of private governance in light of national and interna-
tional public governance.41
I tested the hypotheses of my research in a single industry rather than multiple
industries and at multiple time points from 2008 to 2019. This allowed me to account
for any industry effects and to explain the institutional context in which legitimate
organizations advanced the reputations of the Blockchain firms. In order to corrob-
orate the analysis, 12 semi-structured interviews with experts in trade associations
and with regulators were conducted and these inform the insights in the results
section. Interviews were conducted over the phone and interviewees were recruited
according to a snowball sampling principle, which is used when the sample size
under investigation is relatively small.42 In order to address this challenge, archival
research was also conducted. Legal texts, codes of conduct of industry groups, white
papers of Blockchain providers, policy texts developed by regulators were also
examined in order to understand the differences between traditional and novel
regulatory frameworks. In selecting code of conducts of institutions in Blockchain
technology, a snowballing principle was applied. This sampling technique is used in
hidden populations when researchers have difficulties in assessing data.43 The
methodology of this project differs from other studies of soft regulation and regula-
tory capitalisms44 and analyse Blockchain as a regulatory tool.
A number of matters should be considered when assessing the results. First,
Blockchain is a novel technology, the financial services industry per se was unfa-
miliar to products and services offered to prospective consumers and investors. Early
adopters and consumers were confused due to misunderstanding in the area of
technology, data privacy, cybersecurity, money laundry and terrorist financing
which are also topics of considerable controversy. The only point of agreement
about Blockchain technology was that it could enhance data transparency and reduce
costs of transaction but not increase speed to transactions due to scalability issues.45
As such, firms decided to experiment with Blockchain projects to address trust in the
financial markets especially after the explosive growth and collapse of the securities-
backed assets of the financial crisis in 2008 which spurred the debate on the

transparency of the banking industry and decided to join a new model of finance
rooted on technology.
3.2 Hypothesis
Blockchain-based systems and associated self-regulatory frameworks can directly
shape compliance, law enforcement and regulation in three possible scenarios. In
what follows, I develop three hypotheses that will help to test how trust and law may
enhance regulatory compliance46 based onWerbach’s theoretical framework.47 I test
these hypotheses by looking at both private and public Blockchain infrastructure and
any regulatory frameworks in this industry. Blockchain technology allows self-
regulatory frameworks in being efficient. Self- regulatory frameworks can support
traditional government frameworks to achieve legal objectives. One legal objective
in the Blockchain environment is AML as well as protecting consumers. Self-
regulatory frameworks allow for firms the harmonisation of regulatory frameworks
as well as establishing new regulatory frameworks without displacing current legal
frameworks.48
(H1) The Supplement Hypothesis Self-regulatory frameworks supplement law,
legal and technical code emerge and blockchain embroils law as the basic means
of enforcement. Self-regulatory frameworks can address the challenge that govern-
ments face in the enforcement of legal rules. In this context, government often face
the challenge in enforcing rules for actors in other countries, self-regulatory frame-
work represents a mechanism for legal compliance across jurisdiction. Legal
enforcement involves misalignments of the incentives of actors involved.49
(H2) The Complement Hypothesis Self-regulatory frameworks complement the
law, when legal regime is flawed, blockchain intervenes in the dispute and address
market failures due to lack of regulatory clarity. In the early days of the internet
economy, governments were sceptical of self-defined rules outside legal frame-
works, due to the fear that self-defined rules could undermine the power of national
sovereignty and the private intermediation. Where government services such as
judicial system are functional, a self-regulatory approach may improve efficiency
and speed of the judicial process, but its benefits toward traditional legal system are
limited. Actors trust the institutions and have confident in the technology in order to
46Regulatory compliance for AML in KYC and digital identity.

use Blockchain as regulatory tool.50 In this case, there no-state backed enforcement
mechanisms behind self-regulatory regimes.51
(H3) The Substitute Hypothesis Self-regulatory frameworks substitute law, the
legal technological code replaces law entirely and blockchain become an enforce-
ment mechanism for disputes.
4 Results
Results of this analysis are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 highlighting two main
models of governance (1) delegated governance and (2) technocratic governance in
which Blockchain add, substitute and complements law. Table 1 assesses the
business and regulatory model of the two most prominent Blockchain infrastructure
Ripple and R3, who are developing the infrastructure for “digital cash”. They
resemble the structure of self-regulatory organisation with self-defined rules exe-
cuted by automated code. Both entities apply an open-source protocol for their
products and services, in which the source code is released under a licence in
which the copyright holder allows users the rights to study, change and distribute
the software to anyone and for any purposes. The open-source software is developed
in a collaborative public manner and based on technocratic governance. For exam-
ple, R3 continued to gain momentum with regulators through proactive outreach to
regulators across the globe and providing advice, support and the knowledge to
assist their policy processes and forward-looking initiatives on crypto and
blockchain propositions.52 Table 1 provides an overview of the business and regu-
latory model of Ripple, R3 and Bitcoin. Ripple launched the network system Stellar
in 2014. Stellar is a decentralised payment network and protocol with native
currency Stellar, serving approximately 3 million users and market capitalisation
of $15 million. It can be considered as a self-regulatory framework for blockchain
technology and follows a delegated governance framework. An example of private
form of global standards in Blockchain infrastructure for financial services is the
Stellar Partnership program. Stellar is a global rather national payment system,
allowing users to transcend their local economies and interact globally. The payment
system is ownerless, and it is defined as a network of peers. An important peer in the
stellar partnership is IMB who has played an important role in the cryptography
industry since the 1960, supporting the Data encryption standard together with the
National Security agency (NSA) of the USA. IBM is constantly pursuing partnership
and issuing patents with many business players aiming to become a world leader in
Blockchain technology. An example of partnership is offered by the Hyperledger

project created by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger is a private delegated frame-
work for Blockchain technology for business. Unlike Bitcoin, which only allow
users to transfer Bitcoin, Hyperledger allows users to transfer any asset to which a
value has been assigned. Hyperledger does not own a cryptocurrency.53 Among
other partners of the Hyperledger projects, JP Morgan and Swifts also appear and
beyond financial services Ford features.54 Another example of private-public part-
nership is offered by R3, an enterprise blockchain software firm working with a
broad ecosystem of more than 300 members and partners across multiple industries
from both the private and public sectors to develop on Corda, our open-source
blockchain platform, and Corda Enterprise. Generally speaking, R3, Ripple,
Ethereum employs a technocratic blockchain network based on four core values
propositions: decentralised control, a shared view of the truth, collaboration across
organisational boundaries, the direct exchange of value with tokens. On the matter of
decentralisation, a blockchain network has different value proposition that one can
build around traditional intermediaries.55 It also allows business and regulatory
operations across several legal jurisdictions. The governance of the network is
very important because CEOs of Blockchain companies are in the position of
controlling the value proposition of the network and can exercise digital sovereignty
by complementing, adding or substituting law based on their business and regulatory
preferences. The intermediation process resides in the ledger not in the ledger
creator, however some nodes which represents companies may exercise more
power than others. This model of technocratic governance shares truth in which
the parties involved in the network cannot exercise exclusive authority. Everyone in
the network has a copy of the ledgers and the decision-making process of the
authority is based in the consensus.56 On the matter of value, exchange occurs via
digital token complementing the current payment infrastructure. Token can represent
value or a piece of information operating in a separate or congruous and comple-
mentary government infrastructure.57
Table 2 shows how Blockchain-based systems can strengthen traditional
government-led legal frameworks in many circumstances. For example, post-trade
systems in the EU have developed nationally with different forms and different
business practices.58 The four blockchain infrastructures also show several degrees

of intervention regarding compliance with AML/KYC requirements. This fragmen-
tation increases the complexity of cross-border clearing and settlements of trans-
actions. This also creates costs, risks and inefficiencies for investors, institutions and
issuers. Distributed ledgers offer a different model of business and regulatory: a
single real time record that tracks directly ownership in which many actors can check
and verify information and enforce regulation. This mechanism can be integrated
into the established securities regulatory regimes without replacing existing legal
frameworks. If companies could issue their stocks on a distributed ledger, the
number of traders who follow an arbitrage strategy would be reduced and or
prevented, complementing trust in the system from a public-private framework.
This stylised framework would require companies to not replace law but to evolve
towards an inclusive distributed legal framework. The implementation of this frame-
work is not easy and the intermediaries that resist from the current legal framework
may resist. In scenarios where trust based legal system is not functioning efficiently
due to incomplete markets, blockchain-based systems support the enforcement of
legal rules via smart-contracts. It is true that Blockchain enhance trust, however the
problem of trust will be present and cannot be addressed if the Blockchain infra-
structure is managed by a potential “unreliable” government.
Moreover, the blockchain ledger can be implemented as a workable legal com-
pliance system helping firms to reduce cost and meet their compliance requirements
towards national and international regulation. A prominent example is R3 regulatory
reporting tool developed with the Financial Conduct Authority (UK) and two global
banks.59 This blockchain-based solution allowed multiple parties to access a shared
authoritative record offered an elegant simplification of many regulatory functions
through the creation of a regulatory platform. This platform removed the need to
send copies of information and removed futile double-checking mechanisms. The
built-in features of distributed ledgers—like requiring transaction validation at each
step and recording a full audit trail complete with cryptographic signatures—
improved data integrity throughout the entire process and increased the speed of
transferring information.
This system is a good illustration of new model for financial infrastructure offered
by DLT which provide new tools to promote safer and more efficient markets.
Where rule of law is unstable or absent, the Blockchain infrastructure can substitute,
complement or supplement regulatory frameworks. In these contexts, mechanisms
that introduces workable legal rules are likely to emerge according to a bottom-up
framework developed by business leaders and governments who seek to solve
market failures present in the market. A practical example is the Barbados central
Bank Digital currency project,60 aimed at addressing financial inclusion. This project
develops a payment infrastructure for small-medium enterprises and consumers

conducting business in the Caribbean islands.61 One take-way from these examples
is important to remember is that institutions are not disappearing, but they need to
keep up with the innovation process and the societal pressures to digitisation,
however where governmental institutions can fail, technological infrastructure can
also fail. These extra-legal regimes can go beyond national boundaries, allowing
firms and government to operate in transnational area which comprises of many legal
jurisdictions with wider markets and bigger risks. One key advantage of employing
technology as a regulatory tool is allowing institutions to regulate areas of the
economy which it was difficult to supervise or monitor before. Traditional-self
regulatory frameworks and payment network such as Bitcoin have emerged in
unexpected places (i.e. virtual games) and could potentially scale up. Moreover,
technology-based solutions have been implemented in areas where the financial
infrastructure was underdeveloped and Blockchain aims to address financial inclu-
sion, with Barbados being an important example of this claim.
The distinct nature of Blockchain technology and their associated decentralised
technology infrastructure allow firms to develop a set of collectively supplied,
specific industry relevant skills and capabilities designed for firms and user organi-
sations based on the principle of trust and confidence. In order to operate,
Blockchain projects have a range of formal solutions and sanctions supported by
Blockchain technology such as the block of “bad” users through a smart contract and
informal sanctions typically including denial of media access, bad advertisements on
Blockchain public forums and membership expulsions from associations and con-
sortium. These rules are applied in the case a member misconduct, similarly in the
Blockchain infrastructure decision-making algorithms can automatically punish
members when they misconduct enhancing trust and transparency.
Having examined the main characteristics of these Blockchain projects, I can
affirm that they operate as a form of self-regulatory frameworks. These self-
regulatory frameworks seem to suggest that they do not compete over regulatory
authority, but they complement it.62 Blockchain cannot rid of institutions and
cooperation between incumbent players and Blockchain technology is important.
Depending on the context in which Blockchain is applied, this notion of relationship
of complementarity emerges, connotating that one mechanism of Blockchain
strengthens the functionality of the other or compensates for its weaknesses.63 For
example, the chamber of digital commerce in the USA, an example of private-public
sector partnership, aims to strengthen relationship between private and public actors
in order to advance regulatory experiments in Blockchain and protecting con-
sumers.64 To conclude, these regulatory frameworks seem to be an extension of

innovation, exercising a form of digital and regulatory sovereignty over firms and
consumers.
5 Conclusion
The proposed analyses of the current national and international regulatory frame-
works and of the Blockchain infrastructure as a self-regulatory organisation enabled
a systematic treatment of the main regulatory and business factors and an innovative
approach to the analysis of private governance in Blockchain. I pragmatically
identified three models according to which Blockchain operates by adding,
complementing and substituting law. I have also analysed governance frameworks
in Blockchain and have categorised their mechanisms into two models (1) delegated
governance and (2) technocratic governance. By comparing and contrasting global
government projects and the different regulatory architecture employed by firms in
the Blockchain industry, I showed how technology allowed and will continue to
allow firms that operate on the Blockchain to go beyond national sovereignty and
exercise digital sovereignty in an open global business and political scenario with a
bigger role played by traditional and technological institutions. The mechanisms by
which firms exercise digital sovereignty are numerous ranging from supplementing,
complementing to adding new rules to legal regulatory frameworks to building
platforms which aim to control and monitor consumers via a public and private
Blockchain ledgers. These mechanisms are examples of how emerging technologies
can “induce firms to cooperate”65 as well as governments to interact with a series of
technological infrastructures. These technological infrastructures such as Blockchain
networks allow the incumbent players and start-ups to reinforce powers in global
governance relations while maintaining or reinforcing their institutional role in
governments and society. As financial services activities are migrating from physical
infrastructure such as banks to the internet of finance, the space of traditional
governance is not decreasing. The internet of regulation and Blockchain are chal-
lenging how governments regulate reporting activities, especially in auditing busi-
ness functions and products and the reports associated with them.66 In this light,
governments should take a responsible, proactive way to create a regulatory frame-
work which allows fair competition and address any anti-trust issues arising from a
close number of players involved in this industry. Governments are increasingly
required to understand how technology can facilitate their regulatory and supervi-
sory functions and create a digital economy that can operate on a public or private
Blockchain. Going forward, we need more private and public regulatory

experiments with much better results. Blockchain supplements, complements and
adds to law whilst the government being the administrator of a novel technological
