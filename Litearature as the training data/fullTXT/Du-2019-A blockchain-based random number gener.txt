A Blockchain-based Random Number Generation Algorithm and the Application in Blockchain Games
  
� 
Abstract�Blockchain technology has developed rapidly and 
has been applied in various areas. Blockchain technology has 
the features of decentralization, transparency, autonomy and 
tamper resistance etc. The blockchain, with its unique features, 
can address some problems in traditional areas. In traditional 
games area, especially the gambling game, we learn that there is 
a strong requirement for fairness and random numbers. But 
traditional games are centralized and cannot meet this 
requirement. Hence, we propose a blockchain-based random 
number generation algorithm that can provide a "true random 
number". This algorithm allows all the participants to take part 
in the generation of a random number, which ensures that the 
random number will not be manipulated by anyone. We as well 
design a blockchain game platform adopting this random 
number generation algorithm. Traditional games can be 
deployed on this platform with a simple adaptation. Finally, we 
deploy a poker game on the platform to verify the algorithm and 
performance. The experimental results show that the algorithm 
is effective and the platform has good performance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The blockchain is born as the underlying technology of 
Bitcoin. Blockchain, as a new distributed infrastructure and 
computing paradigm, uses the encrypted chain-block structure 
to store data and uses consensus algorithms to generate blocks. 
Some blockchains contain smart contracts for developing 
blockchain-based applications. The blockchain can realize 
peer-to-peer transaction, coordination and collaboration based 
on decentralized credit, which effectively solves the problem 
of reliable value trading on the Internet. The blockchain has 
the characteristics of decentralization, transparency, autonomy, 
and tamper resistance. 
In recent years, with the rapid development, blockchain 
technology has quickly attracted the attention of researchers, 
governments, financial institutions and technology companies. 
The blockchain has become a hot topic among governments 
and enterprises around the world. The blockchain is a 
so-called revolutionary technical framework [1]. Many 
researchers gradually focus on researching blockchain 
applications. Blockchain has been applied in the Internet of 
Things [2-4], transportation services [5, 6], energy Internet [7, 
8], medical data storage [9], and supply chain finance [10, 11]. 
For example, Guo et al. proposed that the blockchain is 
expected to radically change the payment method and the 
bank's credit system, and improve the efficiency of banking 
business [12]. Zyskind et al. described a decentralized

personal data management system that uses a blockchain as an 
automated access control manager [13]. 
Blockchain games currently occupy a large proportion of 
the blockchain applications. Blockchain games can be divided 
into two categories, one is a completely decentralized 
"on-chain game". CryptoKitties, which was unveiled at 
Ethereum in November 2017, is the originator of these games 
[14]. These games do not rely on the game provider, all the 
processes are completed through smart contracts on the 
blockchain. However, these games have some disadvantages 
compared with traditional games, such as simple game rules, 
poor interactivity, and a relatively short life cycle. Moreover, 
such games are limited by the performance of the blockchain, 
and the transaction cost of this game is high. 
The other type of blockchain game is to execute part of the 
traditional game process with the smart contract and record

accounts are associated with the blockchain accounts (or 
addresses) and the players own the assets which are recorded 
on the blockchain accounts (addresses). This process can 
prevent centralized game providers from tampering with the 
�����	�����
��� �������
����� �

	�����	���������
convenience for the circulation of game assets. Overall, the 
current blockchain game is in its infancy stage. 
In the field of gambling and lottery games, online gaming 
platforms are destined to have low transparency because they 
are centralized. In the gambling and lottery games, "luck" 
explains a large portion of a victory. However, the game 
providers coul�� ��	��

�� 
��� �����	��� ������� ���
cheating, which is unsupervised. Some researchers have tried 
to solve the fairness problem with blockchain. For example, 
Liao et al. designed a blockchain-based lottery system to 
�	�

� 
��� ��
�	�������	��� ��irness [15], and Marcin et al. 
constructed protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the 
Bitcoin [16]. The other blockchain gambling games, like 
Fomo3D on Ethereum, are entirely based on smart contracts 
[17]. These games are relatively simple, and there is still the 
possibility that the game providers could cheat by exploiting 
the loopholes in the contract or attaching the blockchain. 
The traditional gambling game usually just record some 
important game data on the blockchain. But this solution can 
only solve the problem of data tampering, and cannot prevent 
the game provider from cheating in the game process. Players 
have to choose the game providers who have a good reputation 
and believe that the game providers can remain fair in the 
game.

To address the problem of the game providers' 
manipulation of data, we designed a blockchain-based random 
number generation algorithm to prevent human manipulation. 
This algorithm allows all the participants to be involved in the 
generation of a random number, which ensures that the 
random number could not be manipulated by anyone. 
Additionally, we as well proposed a blockchain game platform 
solution based on this algorithm for transferring tradition 
games to the blockchain. The platform uses a consortium 
blockchain and makes it possible that classical gambling 
games could be deployed in this platform with a simple 
adaptation. With the true random number and recording the 
game process on the blockchain, the fairness and transparency 
of the games in the platform are truly guaranteed. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II we introduce 
�����������������
	��
�	������features. 
In Section III, we propose the blockchain-based random 
number generation algorithm. In Section IV we describe the 
blockchain game platform and deploy a poker game on the 
platform to verify the algorithm and performance. In Section 
V we conclude the paper with some future research directions. 
II. BLOCKCHAIN 
A. Structure and classification 
���� �����������s data structure is mainly composed of 
transactions and blocks. A transaction is the smallest operating 
unit in the blockchain. The block generally includes 
information such as version number, previous block hash, 
transaction hash, etc. Each block can contain several 
transactions. From the data structure, the record of blockchain 
is a linear chain. The chain can only add content at the end, 
and it is not allowed to delete or modify the previous content 
in the chain. As shown in Fig. 1, the linked chain is composed 
of sequence blocks. Each block contains a hash of the previous 
block, which forms a chain relationship [18]. Depending on 
the participants and openness, blockchains can be divided into 
the public blockchain, private blockchain and consortium 
blockchain [19]. 
Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are the most 
popular blockchains. Bitcoin and Ethereum are public 
blockchains, whereas Hyperledger Fabric is a consortium 
blockchain [20]. Smart contracts came from Ethereum and 
make blockchains useful for any applications. A smart 
contract is a program that can automatically perform, and 
nodes can manipulate blockchain by this smart contract. 
B. Features of the blockchain 
Decentralization: Decentralization is the most basic 
feature of the blockchain. Blockchain applications can record, 
storage and update of data without relying on centralized 
organizations. The nodes in the blockchain network have 
equal rights and obligations. The nodes in the whole 
blockchain network jointly record the data. Blockchains have 
the characteristics of redundant backup, and the behavior of a 
single node cannot cause a system crash. 
Transparency: Transactions in blockchains are open and 
transparent. Any operation that changes data records is 
transparent to the whole network. The source code of 
blockchains are often open and cannot be tampered with. 
!������������	���	��������perating rules can be reviewed and 
tracked. Transparency is the basis of the blockchain. 
Tamper-resistance: There are two cryptographic 
mechanisms in blockchains to prevent tampering with records. 
The first is to use Merkel Tree (Merkel Tree) to index 
transaction records. When the original transaction is changed, 
the root hash value of Merkel tree will change. The second is 
to record the hash value of the previous block when creating 
new blocks. If anyone wants to change the transaction in a 
block, he or she must reconstruct the transaction records and 
hash values of all the blocks behind this block. 
III. RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION ALGORITHM 
A. Problems of tradition games 
centralization: The traditional online gambling uses a 
centralized system, while the mobile app or website serves as 
a user interface to connect players with the back-end. Players 
can only passively participate in a game and accept the game 
rules and data. The game providers control the whole 
processes. In this mode, the players have to default that the 
providers of the game are trustful. The players must choose to 
accept passively otherwise leave the game. 
Low transparency: The centralization interest of traditional 
gambling platforms leads to low transparency. Taking poker 
games as an example, players do not know which algorithms 
are used to determine the cards and whether game providers 
modify the data during the game. The fairness of the game is 
questionable. In addition, as long as the benefits are attractive 
enough, game providers can tamper with a game easily. The 
players have no tool available to supervise the game's process. 
Security: Game providers are vulnerable to external

�� �	��
questionable. To reduce costs, the data storage and execution 
of the game are concentrated on a limited number of servers. 
#����	���������
���������������������
����
���� etc. are stored 
on these servers. If the hackers control these servers, they can 
modify the game data and control the game results. This will 
trigger devastating disasters to the system. 
B. Algorithm 
In this paper, we design an algorithm to generate random 
numbers. All participants, game providers, and blockchains 
are involved in the execution of the algorithm. First, the game 
provider generates a random number and records the 
encrypted random number on the blockchain, ensuring that the 
game provider cannot manipulate the result of the final

random number. The players then generate their own random 
numbers and send them to the game provider after verification 
on the blockchain. The provider generates a random number 
according to a pre-announced algorithm by �����
��������	���
random numbers, the chain random number and its own 
random number. Then the game provider can use this random 
number to start a game.  
When the game is over, the game provider must announce 
its random number and the private key. The players can use 
the game provider's private key to decrypt to determine 
whether the random number is correct, and finally, verify 
whether there is cheating in the game. Fig. 2 illustrates the 
process of this algorithm. The detailed steps of the random 
number generation algorithm are as follows: 
1) The game provider generates a random number and a 
public-private key pair for a new game. Then the game 
provider encrypts this random number with the newly 
generated public key and sends message{E(Nprovider) 
||GameID} to the blockchain. In this message, GameID

2) The blockchain smart contract checks the GameID. If

������
number(txid1) to the game provider. 
3) The game provider sends the txid1 to all the players. 
The players can use the txid1 to check the game info on 
the blockchain. If the game information is correct, the 
player i need to send her/his own random number to the 
game provider with a signed message random 
{GameID ||Ni}. Here the random number is sent to the 
game provider instead of the blockchain because the 
transaction speed of the blockchain is the bottleneck of 
the whole system. We try to minimize direct 
communications with the blockchain. Sending random 
numbers to the game provider is also sufficient to 
ensure the security of the algorithm.) The game 
provider replies player i with a signed message 
receipt{random} The game provider collects all the 
�����	��� 	������ �����	�� ���� ������ 
��� �������
{E(Nprovider) ||GameID ||[Ni]} to the blockchain. [Ni] is 
the collection of these random numbers. 
4) The smart contract checks the message. Then it 
generates a new record {txid2 ||txid1 ||E(Nprovider) 
||GameID ||[Ni]} and return txid2 to the game provider. 
5) The game provider broadcasts the txid2 to the players. 
������������	���random number is tampered with, he or 
she can refuse to start the game and send the 
receipt{random} to the blockchain to accuse the 
cheating. If all the players agree with this txid2, the 
game can start. The game provider uses the random 
number blocktxid2 hash, txid2, Nprovider, and [Ni] as the 
inputs of function f(x) and gets a number k as output. 
The function f(x) could be an arbitrary predetermined 
function such as bitwise XOR operation. In the 
algorithm, we use blocktxid2 hash, and txid2 as inputs to 
prevent collusion between the game provider and any 
player. 
6) Then the game provider can use k as a random number 
and start the game following the game rule. When the 
game ends, the game provider uploads the record and 
the result. 
7) The smart contract generates a new transaction {txid3 
||txid2 ||txid1 ||E(Nprovider) ||GameID ||[Ni] ||Result 
||Operation ||Private Keyprovider}. The game provider 
must declare the private key and txid3 to the players. 
IV. BLOCKCHAIN GAME PLATFORM 
A. Structure 
We use a consortium chain as the underlying chain of the 
platform and redesign the consensus algorithm by using 
sharding. The consensus mechanism is designed to ensure the 
accuracy and consistency of stored information. The choice of 
consensus mainly determined by business requirements. The 
platform mainly serves the game field and requires high 
decentralization, low verification delay and high fault 
tolerance. In response to these needs, we design a mixed 
Byzantine fault tolerance (MBFT) consensus algorithm for the 
platform by using sharding technology. Fig. 3 shows a 
example structure of MBFT. MBFT can add new consensus 
groups with a random election mechanism to help process 
transactions when the number of transactions increases. The 
consensus groups process different transactions and smart 
contracts separately. Then the high-level consensus group 
verifies the verified transactions packages (mini-block) 
submitted by low-level consensus groups and generate the 
new block. The entire network has high scalability. We will 
introduce this algorithm in detail in future papers. 
 In this consortium chain-based game platform, the nodes 
participating in the transaction verification and block 
producing are maintained by some authorized institutions. The 
game providers can develop game contracts on the blockchain, 
and record game data to the blockchain through the game 
contracts. These contracts are open to all users and are 
associated with the corresponding games. The players can use 
a client to query the game data which have been stored on the 
blockchain. The platform interaction is shown in Fig. 4.

The game platform consists of three layers: the 
infrastructure layer, the smart contract layer, and the 
application layer. Fig. 5 shows 
��� ������������� ����	�� ����
modules. 
Infrastructure layer: The infrastructure layer is the 
foundation of the game system, including data storage, 
peer-to-peer (p2p) network, and consensus mechanisms. This 
layer is responsible for recording data and communication 
among nodes. Data synchronization is accomplished among 
nodes through a consensus mechanism. The consensus 
mechanism ensures consistency and tampers resistance of 
stored data 
Smart contract layer: The smart contract layer links the 
platform layer and the application layer. On the one hand, 
smart contract layer must provide flexible interfaces, such as 
random number generation interface, data logging interface 
for the application layer. In addition, smart contract layer also 
needs to manage the application access rights; on the other 
hand, it needs to interact with the infrastructure layer to save 
the application data, and ensure that the data on the blockchain 
cannot be tampered with. 
Application layer: The application layer acts as a window 
of the platform and is responsible for interacting with the 
client. The application layer responds 
��
��������
������	�
�����
on the platform by calling smart contracts. The application 
layer can also provide some applications and smart contract 
interfaces for third-party companies to develop new games. 
B. Experiment 
We deployed a poker game on the platform to test the 
design. The poker game uses gRPC APIs to connect with 
blockchain. The smart contracts are programmed by Golang 
and running in Dockers. We deployed 12 computers as 
blockchain nodes, 1 computer as the game platform and 1 
computer as the game provider. There are 1 high-level 
consensus group and 2 low-level consensus groups, and each 
group contains 4 nodes. We use different processes to 
simulate the players in 5 computers. 
In the experiment, the game provider first starts enough 
games. Then the players simultaneously execute the 
algorithm in section 3.2. We record the average latency 
between the player sending out its random number and the 
game provider sending back txid2. This latency is 
approximately equal to the load time that a player has to wait 
to start a game. Every two players play a game together. The 
result is shown in Fig. 6. When the number of players is less 
than about 2000, there is only one consensus group. Due to 
the limitation of block size and package speed, when the 
number of players continues to increase, if there is still only 
one consensus group, the latency will double when the 
number of players doubles. However, when a new consensus 
group was added at this time. Although transaction allocation 
and mini-block verification increased some time, the original 
delay was greatly reduced. The final record of one of the 
games is shown in Fig. 7. The record is queried from the 
blockchain with txid3. 
In this experiment, we only make a simple modification to 
the random number generation function and the data storage 
function of a tradition poker game. Then the poker game can 
be deployed on the platform. This experiment shows that with 
only two low-level consensus groups, the system still has low 
game latency in the case of thousands of concurrent requests. 
The actual blockchain game experience is not much different 
from the centralized one. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based true random 
number generation algorithm. This algorithm combines 
players, game providers and blockchains to generate random 
numbers. It solves the problem of "pseudo-random" and 
manipulation problem in traditional gambling games. Then 
we design a blockchain game platform based on this 
algorithm. The game platform is based on the consortium

chain, which can provide better performance than traditional 
public chains and solve the forking problem. The blockchain 
game platform provides an interface, and the traditional 
games can connect to the platform without any changes. The 
game process is recorded on the blockchain so that the whole 
process of the game can be supervised. The platform solves 
the problem of cheating and manipulating game data 
artificially by game providers. Besides, the random number 
generation algorithm can be used in many other application 
scenarios to ensure fairness.  
Considering the insufficient performance and the data 
privacy protection problem of the blockchain, we do not use 
smart contracts to execute all the complex game logic. We 
still retain the role of game provider in the random number 
generation algorithm and game platform. Next, we are going 
to optimize the platform in three aspects: (1) Add a credit 
evaluation module to the blockchain to monitor the game 
�	�����	���behavior. The credit evaluation module can help 
the game players to choose reliable game providers. (2) Use 
secure multi-party computation (SMPC) in the blockchain. 
We will design an SMPC-based random number generation 
algorithm and SMPC-based game process to prevent the joint 
cheating between game providers and some players. (3) 
Continue to optimize the consensus algorithm and design a 
blockchain with high performance and low latency. Relying 
on this high-performance blockchain, the game logic process 
can be executed entirely using the smart contract. With this 
solution, the blockchain game platform will be completely 
transparent and fair.
