Abstract—Mobile service providers (MSPs) are particularly vulnerable to roaming frauds, especially ones that exploit the long delay in
the data exchange process of the contemporary roaming management systems, causing multi-billion dollars loss each year. In this
paper, we introduce BlockRoam, a novel blockchain-based roaming management system that provides an efficient data exchange
platform among MSPs and mobile subscribers. Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts,
BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through
intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by
incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g.,
formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize
the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an effective method to
guarantee the uniqueness of this game’s equilibrium. The performance evaluations show that the proposed economic model helps the
MSPs to earn additional profits, attracts more investment to the blockchain network, and enhances the network’s security and
performance.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation
WITH the popularity of IT technologies and smart devi-
ces, over 5 billion people have been subscribed to
mobile services, generating a $1.03 trillion revenue globally
in 2018 [1]. Although the number of subscribers and the rev-
enues will continue to grow, mobile service providers
(MSPs) have been facing several obstacles, especially for
roaming services. Among them, fraud management is one
of the biggest challenges for MSPs with over $32.7 billion
annual loss throughout the world [2]. Roaming fraud
exploits the inefficiency in managing data exchanges
between two MSPs in order to use illegal free-riding serv-
ices. In particular, when a subscriber moves from its Home
Public Mobile Network (HPMN) to a Visited Public Mobile
Network (VPMN) and remotely accesses services of the
HPMN via the VPMN’s facilities, the HPMN has to pay the
VPMN for the subscriber’s service usage costs incurred
according to the roaming agreement. However, the HPMN
may not be able to charge the subscriber properly due to the
delay in data exchange between the HPMN and VPMN, i.e.,
the time interval between when the subscriber finished
using the service and when the HPMN received the service
report from the VPMN [3]. For example, a subscriber can
fraudulently obtain subscription from the HPMN, e.g., by
SIM cloning or using invalid identities, and uses roaming
services in the VPMN. Such roaming frauds can only be
detected and responded to after the HPMN receives the ser-
vice report, which might take more than 4 hours. This long
delay, coupled with interoperability issues between differ-
ent mobile networks, is the main reason why roaming
frauds are hard to detect and prevent in current roaming
systems, causing significant losses of up to € 40,000 in some
severe incidents [4].
Recently, the rapid development of blockchain technol-
ogy has enabled blockchain-based applications in various
areas, including Internet-of-Things, healthcare, military,
and service providers. In particular, thanks to its advan-
tages of low latency and negligible computational require-
ment, the PoS consensus mechanism has emerged to be an
effective solution to data management in networks consist-
ing of devices with limited computational capacity [5]. Spe-
cifically, blockchain technology can be leveraged to
significantly reduce the data exchange delay in traditional
roaming system, which can help the mobile operators to
detect and respond to the frauds much sooner, thereby min-
imizing the financial loss. Moreover, the privacy of the

mobile roamers can be enhanced thanks to blockchain’s
advanced cryptography techniques such as digital signa-
tures and asymmetric keys. This can help to protect
roamers’ sensitive information such as travel location and
travel history. Note that deanonymization attack, e.g.,
attempting to link a blockchain account to an IP address [6],
[7], or guessing patterns of transaction [7] may compromise
users’ privacy. However, these types of attacks are not effec-
tive when targeting mobile users in roaming as mobile
users’ IPs are usually dynamic. Furthermore, current sys-
tems often rely on Data Clearing Houses (DCHs) to process
and transmit roaming service records. In addition to the
middleman fee which the mobile operators have to pay the
DCH, the reliance on such a centralized entity means that if
the DCH is down, the current system cannot exchange data.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose BlockRoam, a PoS
blockchain solution to address the high delay problem in
existing roaming systems.
1.2 Related Work
Typically, a roaming fraud protection system consists of
preventive and reactive layers as illustrated in Fig. 1 [3].
The preventive layer prevents fraud perpetration by vali-
dating subscribers’ authentication, auditing subscribers’
credit, limiting services duration, and so on. Although these
measures can help to mitigate roaming frauds, they have a
negative impact on the Quality-of-Service provided to the
subscribers, e.g., frequent validation and service limitation
will lower customer satisfaction. The reactive layer typically
consists of four main stages to detect and react to roaming
fraud attacks. The roaming data, e.g., service records,
exchanged between MSPs is first collected at the data collec-
tion stage and processed at the fraud detection stage to
detect potential fraud cases [3]. Each case is then supervised
manually in the supervision stage. The service usage is ter-
minated if a fraud attack is confirmed at the response stage.
Among these stages, data collection is often the bottleneck
in the roaming fraud protection system. Techniques
employed at this stage can only support data collection in
near real-time with a limited number of subscribers, e.g.,
Fraud Information Gathering System [8], or shorten the
data exchanging delay to 4 hours, e.g., Near Real Time
Roaming Data Exchange [9]. Due to the sequential nature of
the system, other stages cannot be activated if the data has
not been collected. Consequently, although fraud attacks
such as SIM cloning can also perpetrate locally in the
HPMN, their consequences are much more severe in the
roaming scenario due to the delay in data exchange, e.g., it
takes up to 18 hours on average before an international
roaming fraud attack can be stopped with the current
system [4].
With outstanding performance in data integrity, decen-
tralization, and privacy-preserving, blockchain has been
emerging to be a secure and effective solution for data man-
agement in many decentralized networks. As a result,
blockchain-based solutions for mobile roaming have been
introduced recently by some organizations, e.g., IBM [10],
Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom [11], and Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance [12], focusing on identity management,
automating billing processes, and fraud prevention. In par-
ticular, these solutions focus on developing blockchain’s
asymmetric keys and digital signatures to manage sub-
scriber identities and propose smart contracts to set up
roaming pacts and automate billing processes. With
enhanced identity management and automatic billing, fraud
attacks can be significantly reduced. However, most of these
solutions are still at the early stage of development and are
facing several technical challenges.
Specifically, most of current blockchain-based data man-
agement systems often employ the Proof-of-Work (PoW)
consensus mechanism, e.g., Bitcoin [13]. However, the
PoW mechanism consumes massive amounts of energy,
e.g., the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption is higher
than that of many countries [14]. Moreover, PoW-based
networks often take a long time to reach consensus, e.g.,
one hour on average [5]. Thus, a new consensus mecha-
nism, namely Proof-of-Stake (PoS), has been developed
with significant advantages over the PoW mechanism,
including reduced energy consumption and delay [5].
Recently, a PoS-based blockchain network, namely Bubble-
tone [15], has been introduced for MSPs to address roam-
ing fraud problems. Using the PoS-based consensus
mechanism and smart contracts, the blockchain-based Bub-
bletone system provides a general platform for various
MSP-to-MSP and MSP-to-subscriber interactions in the
roaming environment. Nevertheless, the consensus mecha-
nism design is not thoroughly discussed in [15].
In addition, more users (e.g., mobile subscribers) partici-
pate in a PoS-based blockchain network means better the
performance and security of the network are. Thus, it is
important to incentivize more users to participate in the net-
work. In current PoS-based blockchain systems, some
stakes, e.g., network tokens, are paid to the users as a
reward for consensus participation. However, a user with a
few stakes is less likely to receive the reward. Moreover,
some blockchain networks such as [15] impose a high stake
requirement for consensus participation. Consequently, the
stakeholders, i.e., subscribers, are inclined to join a stake
pool (formed by MSPs) to earn more rewards. Furthermore,
a stake pool can earn profits from the investments of the
stakeholders by charging a portion of each stakeholder’s
reward [5]. As a result, the formation of a stake pool can be
beneficial if it can incentivize more subscribers and MSPs to
join the network. Therefore, the design of stake pool and
network parameters has a significant impact on the perfor-
mance of a blockchain network, yet studies on this topic are
still limited. The stake pool formation in PoS-based block-
chain networks was analyzed in our previous work in [5].
However, [5] only considers the investment strategies of the

users while the stake pool’s pricing policy is assumed to be
static. In practice, however, the pool has to design its pricing
policy to maximize the profits while attracting more invest-
ments from the stakeholders.
1.3 Contributions and Paper Organization
The main contributions of this paper are briefly summa-
rized as follows:
� We propose BlockRoam, an effective blockchain-
based roaming service management system to pro-
vide a transparent, secure, and automatic platform
for data exchanging between the MSPs. In particular,
by employing the PoS consensus mechanism, Block-
Roam can achieve a delay of less than 3 minutes as
will be shown later in Section 3, which is much lower
than the 4-hour delay of traditional roaming man-
agement systems. In addition to the reduced latency,
BlockRoam can automate various roaming processes
thanks to smart contracts [16], and thus roaming
frauds can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the
MSPs often rely on Data Clearing Houses (DCHs) to
process and exchange data, which incurs additional
costs [3]. In our proposed system, the transactions
are stored in the blockchain and processed by smart
contracts, and thus the service fees for DCHs can be
eliminated. Furthermore, the privacy and security of
the subscribers in BlockRoam are significantly
enhanced thanks to the blockchain’s advanced cryp-
tography techniques [17].
� We analyze existing PoS-based consensus mecha-
nisms [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] to show that
they are not suitable for roaming management due
to their limitations in terms of security and perfor-
mance. Therefore, we develop a consensus mecha-
nism for BlockRoam, which can meet strict security
requirements, mitigate a wide variety of blockchain
attacks, and achieve a much better performance in
terms of transaction confirmation time compared to
those of existing mechanisms.
� We introduce an economic model based on the
Stackelberg game theory in order to jointly maximize
the profits of the stake pool and the stakeholders. By
analyzing utility functions of the stake pool and
stakeholders, we develop a Mixed Integer Linear
Programming model to find the Stackelberg equilib-
rium of our proposed game. We also propose an
effective method that can guarantee to achieve the
unique equilibrium for this game. The proposed eco-
nomic approach can help to maximize the profits of
the stake pool and the stakeholders, as well as
attracting more investment and improving Block-
Roam’s security and performance.
� Extensive simulations have been performed to eval-
uate the performance of our game theoretic model.
Particularly, we simulate the game to show that the
model can brings additional benefits for the stake
pool and the stakeholders. Moreover, we also exam-
ine the influence of important parameters on the
outcome of the game. Furthermore, adversarial
attacks scenarios are also simulated to show that
the proposed economic model can help to improve
the network’s security and performance by attract-
ing more investments to the network. These results
are especially crucial in designing appropriate
parameters (e.g., total network stakes, pool fees,
and rewards) to improve BlockRoam’s security and
performance.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
first provide the background about current mobile roaming
systems and blockchain technology and introduce Block-
Roam in Section 2. We then analyze the security and perfor-
mance of BlockRoam in Section 3. After that, we formulate
and analyze the stake pool and stakeholders game in
Section 4. Finally, simulations and numerical results are pre-
sented in Section 5, and conclusions are summarized in
Section 6.
2 BACKGROUND AND SYSTEM MODEL
2.1 Current Roaming Systems
The current roaming system is illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. In the
current system, first, a roaming pact is established between
two MSPs. Then, when a subscriber wants to use services
from its HPMN while being in the service area of the
VPMN, the subscriber sends a request to the VPMN. Then,
the VPMN queries the HPMN about the services that the
subscriber has subscribed to. This information is stored in
the Home Location Register (HLR) database of the HPMN.
If the subscription information is correct, the VPMN will
provide the subscriber access to the corresponding services
(e.g., voice or data service) through the Mobile Switching
Center/Visited Location Register (MSC/VLR). The Call
Detail Records (CDRs) are then sent to both networks where
the CDRs are processed for subscription billings and invoi-
ces generation. Afterward, the VPMN sends a Transfer
Account Procedure (TAP) file which contains the CDR
information to the HPMN. Usually, there is a Data Clearing
House (DCH) company acting as a middleman, which vali-
dates and transmits the TAP files for the VPMN. Once the
HPMN receives the TAP files, it will pay the VPMN in
accordance with the roaming pact [3].
Fraud attacks in roaming occur when a subscriber gains
access to the roaming services, but the HPMN is unable to
charge the subscriber for the services provided. In this case,
the HPMN still has to pay the VPNM for the facilities pro-
vided during the roaming process, which may result in sig-
nificant financial loss. For example, a fraudulent SIM can
use up to 18 hours of service on average, and in some

incidents, the loss rate is up to € 40,000 per hour [4]. The cur-
rent roaming system is vulnerable to roaming fraud attacks
mainly because of the delay in data exchanging between the
HPMN and the VPMN. Even with the Near Real Time
Roaming Data Exchange scheme [9], the data exchange can
be delayed up to 4 hours, and thus it may take a long time
to detect and determine the fraud. Even if the fraud is
found, it is still difficult for the HPMN to response as it
does not have direct control over the VPMN’s facilities [3].
2.2 Blockchain Fundamentals
A blockchain is a sequence (chain) of blocks, where each
block consists of data (transactions) shared among users in
the network. When a transaction is generated by a user, it
will be first verified by miners, i.e., nodes who participate in
the consensus process, to verify the transaction. After the
transaction is verified and added to a new block, the block
will be broadcast to the rest of the nodes in the network.
Based on the distributed consensus mechanism, a block will
be selected from all the blocks proposed by the miners to
append to the chain [17]. Besides the transactions, a block
also contains a hash pointer created by the hash functions
which map all the block contents and the last block’s pointer
to the current block’s pointer. Therefore, any change in pre-
vious blocks will result in a different hash value in the next
one, and it can be traced back to the first block of the chain.
As a result, the whole blockchain is tamper-evident, i.e., any
attempt to alter the previous blocks can be immediately
detected. This is one of the most crucial advantages of
blockchain technology compared to other security mecha-
nisms. Another advantage is that a blockchain network is
decentralized, and thus there is no single point of failure,
i.e., the network’s operation is ensured even when some
nodes are failed. In contrast, for the current roaming system,
if the DCH is failed, the CDRs and TAP files cannot be trans-
mitted, and in this case, the whole system will stop working.
A smart contract is a program stored in the blockchain
network consisting of a set of rules created by users. If the
rules are satisfied, the contract will automatically be
enforced by the consensus mechanism. The content of a
smart contract is visible to all network users, thus transpar-
ency is ensured [16]. For example, an HPMN and a VPMN
can negotiate with each other and make a smart contract on
the blockchain, which is triggered when a transaction with
CDR data is sent to the smart contract address. Then, when
the transaction is verified and added into the blockchain, all
consensus participants execute the contract code and trigger
the events according to the terms of agreement written in
the contract, e.g., the HPMN automatically pays the VPMN
as per their agreement.
The distributed consensus mechanism is the backbone of
a blockchain network, which governs most of the block-
chain’s operations and ensures that once the data is stored in
a block, it is extremely difficult to be altered without the con-
sensus of most of the nodes in the network. Currently, most
of the blockchain networks have been employing the PoW
consensus mechanisms. In the PoW, the users compete with
each other in a solution searching procedure where a user
with higher computational power may have higher opportu-
nities to be the block winner who will add a new block to the
chain and receive the reward. This competition leads to the
waste of energy in PoW-based blockchain networks. More-
over, PoW-based blockchain networks often experience high
delays in reaching consensus due to security reasons. This
makes PoW consensus mechanisms inappropriate to imple-
ment in mobile roaming systems requiring low delay for
fraud prevention.
Unlike the PoW, each block in PoS-based blockchain
networks is dedicated to an authorized participant
(leader) for mining in advance based on stakes of stake-
holders in the network. This mechanism has many
advantages over the PoW, including lower energy con-
sumption and delay, and thus PoS-based blockchain
applications can be employed effectively in networks
with thousands of users [5]. Currently, there are several
variations of the PoS mechanism, each has some desir-
able characteristics that are suitable for roaming manage-
ment as well as some limitations that hinder their
applicability in this specific context. In the following, we
discuss advantages as well as disadvantages of each
mechanism in details.
� Proof-of-Activity (PoA) [23] is one of the first PoS
mechanisms proposed. This mechanism uses the
block header of previous blocks to determine the
leader for the current block, which helps to ensure
unbiased randomness and prevent grinding attacks
as proven in [23]. However, this mechanism is a
hybrid PoW-PoS mechanism, and thus it has inher-
ent limitations of PoW mechanism such as high
energy consumption and long delay.
� Casper [20] is another PoW-PoS hybrid mechanism.
Although this mechanism is proven to be secure and
able to mitigate many attacks, it still has performance
limitations because of the PoWmechanism.
� Chain-of-Activity (CoA) [22] is a pure PoS mechanism,
and thus it can achieve a relatively low delay (trans-
action confirmation time) (6 minutes) and requires
negligible energy consumption. Nevertheless, the
security of this mechanism is not proven rigorously
in the paper, and its real-world application network
has a relatively low transaction throughput (60 trans-
actions per second).
� Tendermint [21], developed based on a Byzantine
Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol, can achieve very low
delay and high throughput. However, Tendermint
relies on a set of validators to vote for the consensus,
but how these validators are chosen is not discussed
in the paper. Moreover, this mechanism requires
high a communication complexity, i.e., Oðn3Þ, and
the security analysis in the paper is not extensive
(does not consider several attacks).
� Ouroboros [19] is a PoS mechanism with strong theo-
retical background and rigorous security analysis.
The mechanism is proven to be secure, satisfying the
persistence and liveness properties [26] with over-
whelming probability, and able to mitigate many
attacks. However, in case of a strong adversary, the
delay is significantly increased.
� Algorand [24] is proven to be secure and can achieve
high performance. However, the mechanism can

tolerate only an adversarial ratio of 1/3, and there is no
incentivemechanism and attack analysis in the paper
� Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) [25] is a variation of
PoS that employs a committee to create blocks. How-
ever, this mechanism requires a lot more communi-
cations, is more prone to centralization, and can
tolerate a smaller adversarial ratio compared to those
of the other PoS mechanisms
The main advantages and limitations of the considered
consensus mechanisms are summarized in Table 1. As
observed in the table, all the consensus mechanisms have
security flaws or performance limitations that make these
mechanism unsuitable for the roaming management appli-
cation. Thus, in the next Section, we will propose a consen-
sus mechanism for BlockRoam to address these issues.
2.3 Blockroam
2.3.1 Network Model
Our proposed blockchain-based system consists of two
main components, namely the roaming management plat-
form and the consensus mechanism as illustrated in Fig. 3.
The roaming management platform supports complex inter-
actions between the users, automates various roaming pro-
cesses, and provides a universal currency, i.e., blockchain
network tokens, for payments. In addition to the roaming
processes, the network can also take part in the consensus
mechanism to maintain the network’s operations and
security, store data (e.g., roaming pacts, subscriber informa-
tion, and transaction history), and execute roaming pro-
cesses such as payments and processing CDRs.
2.3.2 Roaming Management Procedure
The roaming process, the main procedure of the roamingman-
agement platform, consists of sevenmain steps as follows:
� Step 0: Two MSPs form a roaming pact consisting of
tariff plans for services offered to the subscribers
and the payment agreement between two MSPs.
This roaming pact is made in the form of a smart
contract and stored in the blockchain.
� Step 1: When a subscriber (roamer) wants to use
services from its HPMN, the subscriber queries the
VPMN and receives available tariff plans as per
the roaming agreement between the VPMN and the
HPMN.
� Step 2: If the subscriber agrees to use the service, the
subscriber sends a transaction containing a sufficient
amount of money (in form of digital tokens) to the
smart contract’s address.
� Step 3: When the transaction is verified and sent suc-
cessfully, the VPMN will grant the subscriber access
to roaming facilities.
� Step 4: When the subscriber finishes its roaming ser-
vice, the VPMN sends a transaction to the smart

contract’s address, which consists of the CDR data of
the provided service.
� Step 5: The smart contract then automatically calcu-
lates the subscriber’s service fee and sends it to the
HPMN. The smart contract also triggers a transac-
tion from the HPMN to the VPMN for payment of
the service.
� Step 6: Finally, the smart contract sends the unused
tokens to the subscriber.
2.3.3 Benefits
BlockRoam has the following advantages over the tradi-
tional roaming system:
� Roaming fraud prevention: The main obstacle to prevent
and react to fraud attacks is the significant delay in
data exchange, i.e., up to 4 hours. Our proposed sys-
tem employs the PoS mechanism to speed up the data
exchanging process, e.g., approximately 3 minutes on
average as later shown in Section 3, and thus fraud
attacks can be detected much earlier. Moreover, by
using smart contracts, the billing process is executed
right after the service usage finished.As a result, roam-
ing fraud can be significantlymitigated.
� Cost saving: In our proposed system, the CDRs are
stored in the blockchain and processed by smart con-
tracts. Therefore, the DCHs are no longer needed,
and thus the middleman fees are eliminated. More-
over, our system automates various processes, such
as subscribers billing and HPMN payments, which
can further reduce operational costs. Furthermore,
our system’s energy consumption is negligible com-
pared to that of PoW-based systems, and thus our
energy cost is much lower.
� Security and privacy: Using cryptographically secure
mechanisms, the privacy and security of the sub-
scribers can be significantly improved. Each sub-
scriber in the network uses a pair of public and
private keys for identification and verification. The
network only needs the subscriber’s digital signature
which can be easily verified and almost impossible
to forge. This also protects the anonymity of the sub-
scribers, as the subscriber’s real-life identity is
completely unrelated to the network identity.
3 BLOCKROAM’S CONSENSUS MECHANISM
We have shown that the existing PoS mechanisms are not
suitable for the roaming management application due to
either security flaws, or insufficient performance ability.
Therefore, in this section, we propose a novel consensus
mechanism for BlockRoam. We also conduct analyses to
show that the proposed consensus mechanism can satisfy
the strict security requirements and achieve more desirable
performance compared to existing mechanisms.
3.1 Proposed Consensus Mechanism
3.1.1 Epochs and Time Slots
In our proposed consensus mechanism, time is divided into
epochs, each of which is composed of Ne time slots. At the
first time slot of epoch ek, a committee, consists of some
users (stakeholders), executes an election protocol to elect
one leader for each time slot in epoch ek. The election proto-
col also selects the committee members for the epoch ekþ1. If
a leader fails to broadcast its block during its designated
time slot (being offline during its time slot), an empty block
will be added to the chain. The leader is also instructed to
not change its broadcast blocks at any later time.
3.1.2 Leader and Committee Election Protocol
To elect the leaders and committee members, the committee
members of epoch ek execute the Publicly Verifiable Secret
Sharing (PVSS) protocol [18] to create seeds for the Follow-
the-Satoshi (FTS) algorithm [5]. The PVSS protocol allows
the protocol participants to produce unbiased randomness
in the form of strings and any network user to verify these
strings. Moreover, the PVSS protocol can tolerate an adver-
sarial ratio of up to 1/2, and this protocol is very efficient in
terms of communication complexity, i.e., OðmÞ where m is
the number of committee members [18]. Once the random
strings are created, they are used as the seeds for the FTS
algorithm (a hash function that takes any string as input
and outputs some token indices [5]). The current owners of
these tokens are then chosen as leaders of epoch ek and com-
mittee members of epoch ekþ1.
3.1.3 Incentive Mechanism
The incentive mechanism plays a crucial role in ensuring
that the stakeholders follow the consensus mechanism
properly. To this end, the incentive mechanism needs to
incentivize participation in the consensus mechanism via a
reward scheme and penalize malicious behavior via a pen-
alty scheme. In the reward scheme, a leader will receive a
fixed number of tokens when the leader adds a new block
to the chain. The probability Pn that user n is selected by the
FTS algorithm in a network ofN stakeholders is
Pi ¼ snPN
n¼1 sn
; (1)
where sn is the number of stakes (tokens) of stakeholder n.
As observed from 1, the more stakes a stakeholder has, the
higher chance it can be selected to be the leader and able to
obtain the reward. For the penalty scheme, the leader is
required to make a deposit that will be locked during its
designated epoch to prevent nothing-at-stake, bribe [5], and
transaction denial attacks [19]. The stakes of committee
members are also locked during the epoch that they are
serving in the committee to prevent long-range attacks [5].
3.2 Security Analysis
3.2.1 Blockchain Properties
To maintain the blockchain’s operations and security, a con-
sensusmechanismmust satisfy the following properties [26]:
� Persistence: Once a transaction is confirmed by an
honest user, all other honest users will also confirm
that transaction, and its position is the same for all
honest users.
� Liveness: After a sufficient period of time, a valid
transaction will be confirmed by all honest users.

Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 09:05:23 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
In our proposed system, persistence ensures that once a
transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reverted. Without per-
sistence, a fraudster can use the roaming services for free.
For example, a fraudster can perform a double-spending
attack by first sending a transaction Tx1 to the smart con-
tract. Then, after the VPMN has granted the fraudster access
to the roaming service, the fraudster broadcasts a transaction
Tx2 which sends the tokens of Tx1 to another address (e.g.,
the fraudster’s second account). If Tx1 has not been con-
firmed, Tx2 is still valid and may be confirmed by honest
users.
While the persistence property ensures data immutabil-
ity, the liveness property ensures that every valid transac-
tion will eventually be included in the chain. Without
liveness, an attacker might successfully block every transac-
tion coming from the MSP, and consequently, the roaming
process cannot commence. It has been proven in [26] that
the persistence and liveness properties are ensured if the
consensus mechanism satisfies the following properties:
� Common prefix (CP) with parameter k 2 N: For any pair
of honest users, their versions of the chain C1; C2
must share a common prefix. Specifically, assuming
that C2 is longer than C1, removing k last blocks of C1
results in the prefix of C2.
� Chain growth (CG) with parameter & 2 N and t 2 ð0; 1�:
A chain possessed by an honest user at time tþ &
will be at least &t blocks longer than the chain it pos-
sesses at time t.
� Chain quality (CQ) with parameter l 2 N and m 2 ð0; 1�:
Consider any part of the chain that has at least l
blocks, the ratio of blocks created by the adversary is
at most 1� m.
We prove that our proposed consensus mechanism can sat-
isfy the commonprefix, chain growth, and chain quality proper-
tieswith overwhelming probabilities in the following Theorem.
Theorem 1. BlockRoam’s consensus mechanism satisfy the com-
mon prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties with
overwhelming probabilities.
Proof. See Appendix A, which can be found on the Computer
Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.
org/10.1109/TMC.2021.3065672. tu
3.2.2 Roaming Fraud Protection Ability
To evaluate the roaming fraud protection ability of our sys-
tem, we focus on the average resolution time ttotal, i.e., the
average time between the occurrence of a roaming fraud
attack and the execution of the responses to the attack. As
observed in Fig. 1, ttotal is the sum of every stage’s duration at
the reactive layer, i.e., ttotal ¼ tC þ tD þ tS þ tR. Since our
proposed system can achieve a much lower tC compared to
the traditional roaming system, i.e., approximately 3minutes
(as later shown in Section 3.3) compared to 4 hours, the ttotal
of our system is nearly 4 hours shorter than that of the tradi-
tional roaming system.
3.2.3 Blockchain Attacks Mitigation
In the following Theorem, we prove that our proposed
BlockRoam can also be able to mitigate and prevent a
variety of emerging blockchain attacks such as double
spending, grinding, bribe, nothing-at-stakes, and long-
range attacks.
Theorem 2. BlockRoam can mitigate double-spending, grinding,
nothing-at-stakes, bribe, transaction denial, and long-range
attacks as long as the adversary does not control more than
50 percent total network stakes.
Proof. See Appendix B, available in the online supplemen-
tal material. tu
When the adversary controls more than 50 percent of the
total network stakes, both the persistence and liveness prop-
erties are no longer guaranteed [19]. Consequently, attacks
such as double-spending, nothing-at-stakes, and transaction
denial attacks can no longer be mitigated.
3.3 Performance Analysis
In Table 2, we examine and compare the transaction confir-
mation times under different adversarial ratio (percentage
of stakes in PoS or computational power in PoW that the
adversary controls) of a PoW blockchain network (Bitcoin),
a PoS network with delayed finality (Cardano), and Block-
Roam. The transaction confirmation time is the time it takes
to reach a common prefix violation probability PrCP � 0:1%.
Based on (14), k can be determined, and then k is multiplied
with the slot time to calculate the transaction confirmation
time. Our slot time is set to be 20 seconds (the same as that
of Cardano [28]). The transaction confirmation times of Bit-
coin and Cardano are presented in [19].
As observed in Table 2, themore stakes the adversary con-
trols, the longer the transaction confirmation time is. More-
over, 51 percent attack [19] can break most of the PoW-based
and PoS-based blockchain networks. Specifically, an adver-
sary controlling more than 51 percent of total computational
power in a PoW-based network or 51 percent of total stakes
in a PoS-based network can successfully perform many
attacks, including double-spending, nothing-at-stakes, and
transaction denial attacks. Therefore, it is critical to attract
more participants to our PoS-based blockchain system in
order to increase the network’s total stakes, thereby improv-
ing the common prefix violation probability and transaction
confirmation time. In the next section, we will introduce an
effective economic model that can jointly maximize profits
for the participants, encouraging them to participate in the
network and thus improving the network’s performance
and security.

4 ECONOMIC MODEL
4.1 Stake Pools and Stakeholders
In a PoS-based blockchain network, the probability that an
individual user (stakeholder) with a small number of stakes is
selected to be the leader is low as shown in (1). Moreover,
when a stakeholder is selected to be the leader, it needs to be
online during its designated time slot to (1) collect transac-
tions from other users, (2) validate these transactions, (3) cre-
ate a block containing valid transaction, (4) broadcast the
block to the network. Therefore, if the stakeholder’s connec-
tion is poor, it fails to create a valid block, and consequently it
cannot obtain the block reward. Thus, stakeholders who par-
ticipate in the consensus process need to maintain a strong
connection to the network, which incurs an operational cost,
e.g., $40 to $300 per month [29]. Therefore, small stakeholders
often pool their stakes together to increase their opportunities
to be the leaders and share operational costs, which results in
the formation of stake pools, e.g., [30], [31], [32]. Such forma-
tion of a stake pool is also beneficial for the blockchain because
no transaction is processed when the leader fails to create a
valid block (which reduces transaction throughput). In Block-
Roam, the stakeholders, e.g., the subscribers, might be more
inclined to join the stake pool (e.g., formed byMSPs) to reduce
their operational costs and have more stable incomes. A stake
pool often charges a part of the stakeholder’s profits for join-
ing the pool, e.g., the Stakecube pool charges 3 percent of each
reward a stakeholder receives [31]. In this section, we intro-
duce an economic model using Stackelberg game in order to
jointly maximize the profits of the stake pool and stakehold-
ers, which is beneficial for MSPs and BlockRoam’s operation
and security.
We consider a PoS-based blockchain network with one
stake pool and N stakeholders. The stakeholders have stake
budgets B ¼ ðB1; . . . ; BNÞ and individual operational costs
C ¼ ðC1; . . . ; CNÞ. The stake pool has its own stake s, and
the pool defines a cost c and a fee a in advance for users
who are interested in participating in the pool. The pool’s
cost is charged for joining the pool and maintaining its oper-
ations. The pool’s fee is the profit margin of the pool’s
owner, which usually ranges from 1 to 9 percent in real-
world stake pools, e.g., [30], [31], [32]. The stakeholders can
use their budgets to invest pi stakes to the pool and mi
stakes for self-mining (individually participate in the con-
sensus process), such that pi þmi � Bi. Let denote N p to be
the set of stakeholders who invest in the pool, the probabil-
ity Pw that the pool is selected to be the leader and obtains a
block reward R is proportional to the pool’s stakes in the
total network stakes, i.e.,
Pw ¼

After receiving the reward R, the pool calculates each stake-
holder’s reward rpi based on the proportion Pp
i of stake-
holder i’s stakes in the total stakes of the pool, which is
Pp
i ¼ pi
s þP
n2N p

: (3)
The pool then charges a fee for a percentage from each
stakeholder’s reward and a cost of ce�pi before the reward is
finally sent to each stakeholder. Since the cost decreases
exponentially as the stakes increase, it encourages the stake-
holders to invest more stakes to the pool. Thus, when a
stakeholder i invests pi stakes to the pool, the stakeholder’s
expected reward rpi is given by

The total profit of the pool consists of the profits from its
own stakes, i.e., the first term in (6), and the costs and fees it
charges the stakeholders, i.e., the second term in (6).
4.2 Stackelberg Game Formulation
In practice, a pool usually announces its cost and fee first,
e.g., the fee to join the Stakecube pool can be found on its
website [31]. Based on that information, the stakeholders
will decide how much to invest. As a result, the interaction
between the stake pool and stakeholders can be formulated
to be a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game
[33]. In this game, the leader is the stake pool who first
announces its strategy, i.e., costs and fees to join the pool,
and then the stakeholders, i.e., followers, will make their
decisions, e.g., to invest to the pool or not.
We denote sp and si to be the strategies of the leader and
follower i, respectively. Furthermore, we denote Si to be the
set of all possible strategies of follower i. Then, the best
response s�i of a follower i can be defined to be the strategy
set which gives the follower the best payoff given a fixed
strategy sp ¼ ða; cÞ of the leader, i.e.,
Uiðs�i ; spÞ � Uiðs0i; spÞ; 8s0i 2 Si: (7)
Based on the follower’s best response, the Stackelberg strat-
egy for the leader is a strategy s�p such that
s�p ¼ argmax

Then, the Stackelberg solution can be defined as the tuple

Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. To find the Stackelberg
equilibrium, the game can be divided into two stages. At the

first stage, the leader announces its strategy. Then, at the
second stage, the followers determine their strategies based
on the leader’s strategy. In the following, the backward-
induction-based analysis is carried out to examine the
Stackelberg equilibrium of this game.
4.2.1 Follower Strategy
In this game, a follower’s possible strategies can be divided
into four cases:
� Case 1: Only invest stakes to the pool.
� Case 2: Only invest stakes for self-mining.
� Case 3: Simultaneously invest stakes to the pool and
for self-mining.
� Case 4: Do not invest stakes to the PoS-based block-
chain network.
We prove in the following Theorem that a follower’s best
response is use all its stakes either to invest to the pool or
for self-mining.
Theorem 3. A stakeholder’s best response is to invest all stakes
either to invest to the pool or for self-mining.
Proof. See Appendix C, available in the online supplemen-
tal material. tu
Since the a stakeholder’s best response is to invest all its
stakes, the best response can be deduced from either p�i or
m�
i . Therefore, from now on, we can denote the best
response of follower i by the number of stakes it invest to
the pool p�i . Then, the best response p�i of follower i can be
expressed as a function of the pool’s cost and fee as follows:
p�i ða; cÞ ¼
0 if Ci < BiaR

Theorem 4. Given a strategy of the leader, there exists an opti-
mal strategy for every follower and this strategy is unique.
Proof. From (9), it can be seen that for every fixed strategy
of the leader, a unique best response of every follower
can be straightforwardly determined. tu
4.2.2 Leader Strategy
The backward induction mechanism [33] can be used to find
the best strategy of the leader, which is the strategy that
yields the highest payoff given the best responses of all fol-
lowers, i.e., we have

Since the total network stakes can be considered a con-
stant, the profit from the pool owner’s stake is also a con-
stant (the first term in (10)) and does not need to be
optimized. Moreover, since p�i ða; cÞ can only take two val-
ues, i.e., 0 or Bi, it can be represented by a binary decision
variable xi 2 x ¼ fx1; . . . ; xNg, such that when xi ¼ 1, p�i ¼
Bi and when xi ¼ 0, p�i ¼ 0. This helps to transform the opti-
mization problem (10) into a Mixed-Integer Programming
(MIP) optimization as follows:

(11)
where L is a sufficiently large number. The goal of (11) is to
find the optimal values of ða; c; xÞ to maximize the pool’s
profit. The objective function represents the profit of the pool,
where the stake pool can only charge the stakeholders who
have invested in the pool. The first set of constraints ensures
that only when the pool charges follower i less thanCi, xi can
take the value of 1, and thus the profit can be added to the total
profit of the pool. The second set of constraints ensures that
every xi is a binary number. However, the objective function
is nonlinear, i.e., it contains a multiplication of two decision
variables xi and a, which makes it much more complex to
solve [35]. Thus, we transform (11) into an equivalent Mixed-
Integer Linear Programming (MILP)model as follows:

þ ce�Bi 8i 2 N ;
xi 2 f0; 1g 8i 2 N ;
yi 2 Rþ 8i 2 N :
(12)
The transformation from (11) to (12) is done by a stan-
dard transformation technique which ensures the equiva-
lence of the two models [34]. In particular, we introduce a
new set of continuous variables y ¼ fy1; . . . ; yNg which
represents the profit which the pool can yield from fol-
lower i. Two new sets of auxiliary constraints, i.e., the sec-
ond and third sets of constraints, are added to set the
upper bound for yi. If xi ¼ 0, i.e., follower i does not invest
stakes to the pool, yi will be upper-bounded by 0. If xi ¼ 1,
yi will be upper-bounded by BiRaPN
j¼1

þ ce�Bi . Thus, the
optimal solution of (12) consists of two optimal values of a
and c as shown in (10).
4.2.3 Existence of the Stackelberg Equilibrium
The existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proven via
the existence of the optimal solutions of (12) in the following
Theorem.
Theorem 5. There exists at least one Stackelberg equilibrium in
the considered stake pool game.

Proof. See Appendix D, available in the online supplemen-
tal material. tu
4.2.4 Uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium
Although there always exists at least one Stackelberg equi-
librium in this game, the uniqueness of the equilibrium can-
not be guaranteed because both a and c are continuous
variables. Consequently, there may be multiple pairs of a
and c to achieve the same optimal utility as will be shown
later in Section 5. In the conventional Stackelberg game
model, the leader has only one primary priority, that is, to
maximize the profit. Therefore, we propose a secondary pri-
ority for the leader, which is to minimize a. This serves two
purposes, i.e., to attract followers with high stakes (as the
amount the pool charges via the fee is proportional to the
stakes) and to determine the unique optimal strategy for
the game (i.e., the unique optimal strategy for both the
leader and followers). Under the proposed approach, we
can always obtain the unique Stackelberg equilibrium as
proven in Theorem 6.
Theorem 6. The considered stake pool game admits a unique
Stackelberg equilibrium.
Proof. See Appendix E, available in the online supplemen-
tal material. tu
Based on this unique Stackelberg equilibrium, the stake
pool can design appropriate parameters, i.e., cost and fee, to
maximize its profits and attract more stakeholders to invest
in the pool, and at the same time, the stakeholders can
determine their best investment strategies to maximize their
profits.
5 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
5.1 Parameter Settings
We first study three small game instances, i.e., G1 to G3, to
clearly show the relation between the leader and the fol-
lowers in different situations. In these instances, we exam-
ine the utility functions of the stake pool and stakeholders.
Particularly, we present their corresponding utilities over a
range of fees and costs, thereby demonstrating the effects
of the stake pool strategy on the profit of the stakeholders
and the stake pool. In G1, we consider a small game con-
sisting one stakeholder and one stake pool with C1 ¼ 0:1,
b1 ¼ 5, R ¼ 10, and s ¼ 10. Then, we extend this game to
G2 by considering five followers with the same configura-
tions as that of the follower in G1, while other parameters
are unchanged. After that, we consider game G3. Parame-
ters are similar as those of G2 except that the followers
have different budgets B ¼ ð5; 10; 13; 6; 8Þ, operational costs
C ¼ ð0:1; 0:3; 0:2; 0:6; 0:5Þ, and R ¼ 50.
To evaluate more general cases, we simulate 13 instances
G4 to G16, each with 1,000 followers and different parameters
as shown in Table 3. Among them, the first five games G4 to G8
are simulated with network parameters, such as R, C, and B,
generated based on several real-world PoS-based blockchain
networks [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Particularly, the values ofR
is determined using the number of coins these networks pay
out (as block reward) per one block. For the values of C, we
first calculate the reference valueCr as follow:
Cr ¼ 100
VRNb
; (13)
where 100 is the average cost per month (in $) to participate
in the consensus process, VR is the monetary value of each
coin, and Nb is the number of blocks produced per month.
As a result, Cr represents on average how many coins it
costs to participate in the consensus process for one block.
Then, the ranges of C can be determined based on Cr. For B,
we estimate the ranges by dividing the total number of coins
in circulation and the total number of stakeholders in the
network. Then, Bn and Cn of each stakeholder are generated
randomly with normal distribution in the ranges listed in
Table 3. The eight instances G9 to G16 are simulated to study
the impacts of important parameters, i.e., R, B, C, and s, on
the game outcome. Taking G4 as a reference, we vary a sin-
gle parameter at a time to evaluate the impacts of each
parameter. For example, to study the impacts of R, we
decrease R ten times (compared to G4) in G9 and increase R
ten times in G10, while all the other parameters are kept the
same. The results, including the optimal leader strategy,
optimal profit, and percentage of the network stakes
invested in the pool, are obtained by solving the MILP opti-
mization (12).

To evaluate the effects of the economic model on the
network’s security and performance, we simulate six game
instances, G17 to G22. In instance G17, we simulate the net-
work with a stake pool, similar to the previous game instan-
ces. In contrast, we simulate the network without a stake
pool in instance G18. Since there is no stake pool, each stake-
holder in this instance only has two choices, i.e., to partici-
pate in the consensus process if its operational cost is less
than its profit (Ci < BiRPN
n¼1
Bi
), or does not participate in the
consensus process if its operational cost is higher than its
profits. Then, we examine the cases where there is an
adversary who tries to attack the network with the same
adversarial budget BA in both instances. Under such
adversarial attacks, we compare the security and perfor-
mance of the network (with and without the stake pool) in
terms of common prefix violation probability and transac-
tion confirmation time. The common prefix violation prob-
ability is calculated using (14). Based on this, we find the
minimum value of k such that PrCP < 0:1% and multiply
it with a block time of 20 seconds to determine the transac-
tion confirmation time. For G17 and G18, we simulate a
weak adversary with BA ¼ 20; 000 tokens. Similarly, we
simulate a medium adversary with BA ¼ 40; 000 tokens for
G20 and G21 and a strong adversary with BA ¼ 60; 000
tokens for G21 and G22. The other parameters of G17 to G22
are the same as those of G4.
5.2 Numerical Results
5.2.1 Leader and Follower’s Utilities
The best response function of follower 1 in G1 is illustrated
in Fig. 4a. Based on its best response, the profit of follower 1
can be determined. In this game, the profit of the follower
decreases as the pool’s fee and cost increase as shown in
Fig. 4b, but it is still higher than self-mining. The profit of
the pool is illustrated in Fig. 4c. Since there is only one fol-
lower in G1, the profit of the pool only comes from follower
1, and thus it is upper-bounded by C1. In this game, any
pair of (c;a) that satisfies aRBi
sþCi
þ ce�Bi ¼ Ci ¼ 50
15aþ 0:007c ¼
0:1 is a Stackelberg solution, which leads to multiple Stack-
elberg equilibria. Nevertheless, under our proposed
approach, we can find the unique Stackelberg equilibrium
for this game at ðc�;a�Þ ¼ ð14:8; 0Þ.
In G2, since the followers have the same budgets and
operational costs, their best response and profit functions
are the same, which are illustrated in Figs. 5a and 5b,
respectively. These functions are similar to that of G1,
except that the fee threshold is higher (7 percent). This is
because there are more followers in G2, and thus (c;a)
must satisfy aRBi
sþCi
þ ce�Bi ¼ Ci ¼ 50
35aþ 0:007c ¼ 0:1. The
pool’s profit in G2 is illustrated in Fig. 5c, which is upper-
bounded by 5Ci in this game. The unique proposed equi-
librium of this game has a corresponding solution
ðc�;a�Þ ¼ ð14:8; 0Þ as shown in Fig. 5c.
In G3, each follower’s best response is illustrated
in Fig. 6a. Typically, the higher a follower’s budget is, the
higher cost and the lower fee that follower is willing to
accept, and vice versa. For example, follower 3 with the hig-
hest budget only accepts a fee of no more than 1.6 percent,
and follower 1 with the lowest budget only accepts a cost
lower than 15. This is because the budget is proportional to
the fee the pool charges, while the cost decreases exponen-
tially as the budget increases. The pool’s profit in G3 is illus-
trated in Fig. 6b, with the leader’s optimal strategy
ðc�;a�Þ ¼ ð171:3; 3:0%Þ and optimal profit U�
p ¼ 1:19. Fig. 6c
illustrates the profit the pool receives from each follower.

Interestingly, at the obtained Stackelberg equilibrium of G3,
the follower with the highest stake, i.e, follower 3, does not
invest to the pool. The reason is that follower 3 has a rela-
tively low operational cost, and thus the follower is more
inclined to mine if the pool’s cost and fee are too high. If the
pool tries to incentivize all followers to invest by reducing a
and c, its profit is only Up ¼ 0:68.
The results of more general cases are shown in Table 3.
The five instances G4 to G8 are simulated with parameters
adopted from several real-world blockchain networks [36],
[37], [38], [39], [40]. The results show that the leader’s opti-
mal strategy and profit are significantly influenced by the
network’s parameters. For example, we obtain the optimal
solution of G4 where ðc�;a�Þ ¼ ð3:2; 4:0%Þ, U�
p ¼ 28:95, and
approximately 69.5 percent of the total network’s stakes
(including s) are invested to the pool. The profit that the
pool earns from each follower depends on each follower’s
budget and operational cost, as shown in Fig. 7. Typically, a
follower with higher cost and budget can give the pool
more profit. However, similar to G3, if the budget is too
high, the follower might not want to invest stakes to the
pool, e.g., the followers with budget Bi greater than 150 do
not join the pool in G4.
5.2.2 Impacts of Parameters
The eight games G9 to G16 are simulated to study the impacts
of important parameters R, B, c, and s, on the game’s out-
come. The impacts of those parameters are briefly described
as follows:
� Block reward R: G9 and G10 are simulated to show the
impact ofR. AsR increases, the pool’s profit increases.
However, the followers’ operational costs are constant.
Therefore, the pool has to decrease a when R
increases, otherwise the followerswill self-mine.
� Operational costs C: G11 and G12 show how the
followers’ operational cost impacts the game’s out-
come. As the C increase, the pool can increase its
profit by increasing a. The reason is that the
followers’ profits from self-mining are inversely pro-
portional to the C, and thus self-mining becomes less
profitable if C are too high.
� Budgets B: G13 and G14 show that as the budgets of
followers increase, the pool can increase c but it has
to reduce a. This is because the profit the pool
receives via a is proportional to B, while the profit
the pool gets from c decreases exponentially as B
increase. Moreover, as B increase, the stakeholders
invest fewer stakes to the pool and consequently the
pool’s profit decreases. The reason is that when B
increase, the profit from self-mining also increases,
and thus the followers prefer to self-mine.
� The pool owner’s stake s: The last two games show that
as s increases, although there are more stakes
invested in the pool, its profit slightly decreases. The
reason is that s is inversely proportional to the pool’s
profit from each follower, and thus increasing s
means that the pool charges less from each follower.
Consequently, the pool’s profit decreases even
though more followers invest to the pool.
5.2.3 Network Security and Performance
Fig. 8 illustrates the common prefix violation probability in
instances G17 to G22. As observed from the figure, the instances
with a stake pool achieve a lower common prefix violation
probability compared to the instances without a stake pool.
For example, for the medium adversary setting, the network
achieves a 1.28 percent violation probability, whereas the

probability is 2.20 percent if there is no stake pool. This is
because if there is no stake pool, the stakeholders with small
budgets may have negative utility if they participate in the
consensus process (if their operational costs are higher than
the reward they can obtain). Thus, the stakeholders holding
few stakes may not participate in the consensus process,
resulting in lower total network stakes. Consequently, the
adversarial ratio can be increased, and the adversary may
have higher chances to successfully attack the network.
Fig. 9 illustrates the transaction confirmation time in
instances G17 to G22. Similar to the common prefix violation
probability, the transaction confirmation time of the instan-
ces with a stake pool are lower than those of the instances
without a stake pool. The reason is that, when the common
prefix violation probability is higher than 0.1 percent, the
stakeholders have to wait for more blocks (higher k) to con-
firm a transaction. Since the common prefix violation proba-
bilities are higher in the instances without stake pool as
discussed above, the transaction confirmation time is also
higher in these cases. For example, in G22, the stakeholders
have to wait for 15 blocks to confirm a transaction, whereas
they have to wait for 13 blocks in G21, and thus the transac-
tion confirmation time is lower in G21
5.3 Summary of Findings
The key findings of the considered stake pool game are
summarized as follows:
� We have proved that for a rational stakeholder, its
best strategy is to invest all stakes from its budget to
the blockchain network.
� We have proved that for each stakeholder, its best
strategy is to invest all its stakes either to the pool or
for self-mining.
� We have proposed an approach for the leader to
decide its optimal strategy. Under this approach,
there always exists the optimal and unique best strat-
egies for the stakeholders and the stake pool owner.
This approach also helps the stake pool to attract
stakeholders with high stakes.
� We have shown that the proposed economic model
can enhance the network’s security and performance.
6 CONCLUSION
To address the problem of roaming fraud for mobile ser-
vice providers, we have proposed BlockRoam, a novel
blockchain-based roaming management system which con-
sists of our thoroughly analyzed PoS consensus mechanism
and a smart-contract-enabled roaming management plat-
form. Moreover, we have analyzed and showed that Block-
Roam’s security and performance can be enhanced by
incentivizing more users to participate in the network.
Therefore, we have developed an economic model based on
Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of network
users, thereby incentivizing their participation. We have
analyzed and determined the best strategies for the stake-
holders and the stake pool. We have also proposed an effec-
tive solution that results in a unique equilibrium for our
economic model. Lastly, we have evaluated the impacts of
important parameters on the strategies and the equilibrium
of the game. The proposed economic model can help the
mobile service providers to earn additional profits, attract
more investment to the blockchain network, and enhance
the network’s security and performance.
