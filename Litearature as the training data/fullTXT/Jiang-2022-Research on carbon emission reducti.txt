Abstract
Based on the consideration that consumers have low-carbon sensitivity and channel preference, a Stackelberg game model 
dominated by the manufacturer was constructed to study the joint strategies of low-carbon emission reduction and blockchain 
investment of supply chain members under three models: traditional retailer dual channel, manufacturer’s online direct sales 
dual channel, and third-party e-commerce distribution dual channel. The interaction of different levels of emission reduction 
and blockchain investment in different dual-channel models was verified through the calculation and simulation analysis 
of the optimal decision of the supply chain members. The research results showed that the optimal emission reduction of 
manufacturers and the blockchain investment level of retailers under different dual-channel models are distinguishing, and 
manufacturers have the highest emission reduction under the dual-channel model of direct online sales; when manufactur-
ers invest the same amount of emission reduction, the traditional retailer dual-channel model can obtain the highest profit. 
In the process of emission reduction decision-making, there are technology investors and beneficiaries, and the investment 
level is affected by the dual benefit effect of low-carbon emission reduction and trust and the combined effect of cost input. 
And the profit of the dual channel of third-party e-commerce distribution is the lowest; the ratio of technology gain to cost 
investment in the supply chain determines the initiative of low-carbon investment. Meanwhile, there are specific blockchain 
investment thresholds in different dual-channel modes, and the increase of the threshold value will improve the emission 
reduction. Besides, emission reduction investment is driven by the manufacturer’s profit, and the more the manufacturer’s 
channel accounts for, the higher the emission reduction tends to be. And further from the perspective of profit and emission 
reduction, it provides a reference for the channel selection and joint emission reduction strategies of the supply chain.

Introduction
In recent years, with the rapid intensification of the green-
house effect and the deterioration of the global climate 
environment, China, as the world’s largest carbon emitter, 
is actively seeking carbon emission reduction strategies 
and advocating the development of a low-carbon economy 
(Cheng et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2021). On November 30, 
2015, President Xi Jinping announced at the Paris Cli-
mate Conference that China would establish an open and 
transparent carbon emissions trading market by 2020 and 
make carbon emissions reach a peak by 2030 (Su et al. 
2022). Meanwhile, the deepening of consumers’ concept 
of living green life and their demand for green products 
also promote enterprises to adopt necessary low-carbon 
emission reduction strategies to reduce carbon emissions 
(Singh and Mishra 2022). For example, the study shows 
that car sharing can reduce private car congestion and 
greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Paihwa, Pakistan 
(Ullah et al. 2019). In practice, large enterprises such as 
Wal-Mart and IKEA have already started to implement 
carbon labeling technology and have successfully gained a 
competitive advantage by establishing their energy-saving 
and environmental protection image by actions such as 
marketing low-carbon products and promoting low-carbon 
brands (Sun and Fang 2022; Zhao and Cheng  2016). Hui 
An et al. argue that higher green logistics performance

can stimulate trade and business activity and promote 
economic growth (Hui An et al.2021). Meanwhile, more 
and more companies have started to adopt a combination 
of two supply chain distribution models, electronic direct 
sales channels and traditional retail channels, to sell their 
products, such as IBM, Dell, and Nike (Yu et al. 2020; 
Feng et al. 2020). And domestic retailers such as Suning 
have opened online direct sales and distribution channels 
based on traditional offline channels, guiding consumers 
to low-carbon consumption by strengthening the physical 
store experience and store layout and promotion (Liang 
and Zhang 2020; Luo et al. 2014). The low-carbon public-
ity and marketing strategies help enterprises to open up 
the low-carbon market, shape a green corporate image, 
and then fulfill their social responsibility (Hou and Sun. 
2020). And creating economic value has also become one 
of the key considerations for enterprises in implementing 
low-carbon emission reduction.
Under the background of online and offline dual chan-
nels parallel and low-carbon emission reduction, the three 
dual-channel models of a traditional retailer, manufactur-
er’s online direct sales, and third-party e-commerce were 
established in this paper, and the impact of combination 
strategies of emission reduction technology investment and 
blockchain investment on supply chain optimal profit and 
emission reduction decisions were studied. By comparing 
the optimal decision-making under different dual-channel 
modes, the contribution of this paper is to find out the opti-
mal solution for emission reduction investment and block-
chain investment and obtain the influence of dual-channel 
parameters on members’ profit distribution and cooperation 
stability. Further from the perspective of profit and emission 
reduction, it provides a reference for the channel selection 
of the supply chain and the joint emission reduction strat-
egy. Finally, the corresponding management inspirations and 
suggestions were provided. The framework of this paper is 
organized as follows. The “Literature review” section pro-
vides a literature review of blockchain construction and 
application, blockchain investment decisions in the supply 
chain, and low-carbon emission reduction decisions in the 
dual-channel supply chain. The research problem description 
and key assumptions of the model are made in the “Problem 
description and model assumptions” section. In the “Model 
formulation and comparative analysis” section, three deci-
sion-making models based on the Stackelberg game under 
the dual channel are established and theoretical research is 
carried out through propositions. The “Algorithm analy-
sis” section carries out numerical simulation research by 
means of quantitative methods to verify the accuracy of the 
obtained propositions, conducts parameter sensitivity analy-
sis from the perspective of single-factor influence and dou-
ble-factors interaction, and studies the impact of technical 
investment under different dual channels on member profits 
and reductions. Finally, conclusions, managerial implica-
tions, study limitations, and future research development are 
discussed in the “Conclusion” section.
Literature review
In this section, we review the literature focusing on four 
issues related to optimizing decision and low-carbon emis-
sion reduction and blockchain investment decisions. We first 
illustrate the related literature on blockchain construction 
and application in the supply chain and blockchain invest-
ment decisions. The literature on low-carbon emission 
reduction decisons is then analyzed. Finally, the related lit-
erature on optimal decision comparison in a dual-channel 
low-carbon supply chain is reviewed.
Blockchain construction and application 
in the supply chain
Tamayo et al. (2009) developed a perfect blockchain-based 
traceability system for agricultural products to truly achieve 
effective monitoring of the whole process from “farm to 
table” and thus ensure the transparency of the agricultural 
supply chain. And  He et al. (2018) studied the optimal deci-
sion in three cases: traditional supply chain without emis-
sion reduction, individual manufacturer emission reduction, 
and collaborative supply chain emission reduction. Kim and 
Laskowski (2018) used ontological tools as a traceability 
food supply chain blockchain design, using the Ethernet 
blockchain platform to develop smart contracts that support 
commodity traceability and analyze the origin of luxury 
goods in large and complex international supply chains. 
Liu et al. (2021a) constructed a dual-channel supply chain 
model and found that inter-channel competition is conducive 
to improving supply chain profits and social benefits.
Blockchain investment decisions in the supply chain
Fan et al. (2020) discussed the conditions for manufactur-
ers to implement blockchain based on the consideration of 
consumers’ willingness to traceability and blockchain cost-
sharing. Liu et al. (2020) studied the conditions for investing 
in big data and blockchain technology in the green agri-
cultural supply chain from the perspective of enhancing 
consumers’ trust in the greenness of agricultural products. 
Liu et al. (2021b) studied the thresholds and conditions for 
implementing blockchain in green supply chains under the 
condition that the implementation of blockchain brings value 
gain. Liu and Li (2022) proposed that investing in block-
chain technology can suppress the misreporting behavior of 
suppliers, analyzed the changes of supply chain equilibrium 
solutions before and after technology investment, sought the

cost investment threshold of blockchain technology under 
different scenarios, designed revenue-sharing contract and 
repurchase compensation contract for supply chain coordina-
tion, and proposed asymmetric Nash equilibrium negotiation 
to allocate surplus gains.
Low‑carbon emission reduction decisons 
in the supply chain
Promoting carbon emission reduction and increasing profits 
is an important element for companies to carry out strategic 
upgrading and optimization at present. For example, Jiang 
and Chen (2016) studied the optimal production, pricing, 
carbon trading, and green supply chains under centralized 
and decentralized technology investment strategies and 
proved that quantity commitment strategies can improve the 
profits of low-carbon supply chains with strategic customer 
behavior. Ji et al. (2017) found that joint emission reduc-
tion strategies are more profitable for both manufacturers 
and retailers. Low-carbon promotion helps to achieve emis-
sion reduction targets and promote economic development 
and social progress. Liu (2017) compared and analyzed the 
optimal solutions for decentralized and centralized agricul-
tural supply chains with and without low-carbon technolo-
gies, considering the impact of retail prices and low-carbon 
technology levels. Wu et al. (2021) analyzed the effect of 
independent and integrated incentives on the total cost and 
carbon emission cost of collaborative supply chain opera-
tion. Ma et al. (2021) further explored the effects of big data 
empowerment, consumer reference effects, channel prefer-
ences, and corporate altruistic behavior on the optimal deci-
sions and performance of firms with the help of continuous 
dynamic programming theory.
Optimal decision comparison in dual‑channel 
low‑carbon supply chain
With the rapid development and application of information 
technology, e-commerce plays an increasingly important 
role in today’s economy and society. For example, Liu et al. 
(2017) studied the emission reduction performance in the 
single-channel and exclusive dual-channel cases and found 
that the implementation of low-carbon strategies depends 
on parameters such as product substitutability and channel-
based demand. And to achieve the optimal strategy for emis-
sion reduction in dual-channel supply chains. Wang et al. 
(2018) investigated carbon emission reduction in a dual-
channel supply chain driven by aggregate control and trad-
ing regulation and consumer low-carbon preferences. Zhou 
and Ye (2018) compared the optimal equilibrium strategies 
under single-channel and dual-channel supply chains and 
found that compared to single-channel supply chains, the 
profits and emission reduction efforts of manufacturers in 
dual-channel supply chains are higher, while the profits and 
advertising efforts of retailers are lower. Han and Wang 
(2018) found that the ability of electronic supply chains to 
respond to consumer preferences for low-carbon products 
directly affects their operations, and manufacturers’ emis-
sion reduction behaviors will strive for more. And Xin 
et al. (2019) found that dual-channel sales are only a better 
choice for manufacturers and retailers under certain condi-
tions. Therefore, in order to study the emission reduction and 
profit level of the dual-channel supply chain under different 
conditions, Kai et al. (2019) proposed an evolutionary game 
analysis evolutionary stability strategy study of low-carbon 
strategies for supply chain firms and applied it to four com-
binations of low-carbon strategies for retailers and manu-
facturers. Ghosh et al. (2020) found that introducing a dual-
channel strategy is profitable when consumer low-carbon 
preferences are high and initial product emissions are low. 
Yu et al. (2020) analyzed the impact of emission reduction 
cost coefficient, advertising effort cost coefficient, and cost-
sharing ratio on the profit of a dual-channel supply chain. 
Xie et al. (2021) investigated the dual-channel of retailers, 
dual-channel of manufacturers, and mixed dual channels for 
optimal decisions on carbon emission reduction and pric-
ing, with sensitivity analysis and comparison of three dual-
channel models. Wu et al. (2021) established a low-carbon 
decision model based on online stores and their suppliers 
and found that the promotion of low-carbon operations is 
effective when the similarity between online and offline 
operation modes is high, which is conducive to improving 
the low-carbon awareness of online shoppers. Zhang and Yu 
(2021) established a dynamic optimization model of dual-
channel supply chain emission reduction to study the impact 
of low-carbon effect and low-carbon goodwill of products.
From the above literature review, it can be found that 
implementing a dual-channel supply chain strategy is an 
effective way for most companies, especially consumer 
product manufacturers and retailers, to expand their sales 
channels and market space. Table 1 summarizes the related 
studies on the low-carbon emission reduction and blockchain 
investment decisions in different dual-channel supply chains. 
From the described literature, it can be seen that most of 
the existing research on low-carbon supply chains combined 
with blockchain technology investment can be character-
ized as follows: First, the current research on low-carbon 
supply chain mainly focuses on the single-channel model or 
the only dual-channel model, and there is a lack of research 
on carbon emission reduction and blockchain investment 
strategies among different dual-channel channels. Second, 
when researching low-carbon technology investment, there 
are less considered that the application of blockchain as car-
bon traceability and low-carbon propaganda technology, as 
well as the matching strategy of the two technology invest-
ment processes. Third, there is also a lack of comprehensive 
Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–6532165306
research focusing on the impact of emission reduction and 
blockchain investment and consumer preferences on emis-
sion reduction strategies in various dual-channel models and 
the influence of multi-parameter interaction on optimal deci-
sion-making. Based on the above research background, this 
paper establishes three dual-channel supply chain emission 
reduction and marketing decision models based on the low-
carbon sensitivity and channel preference of consumers and 
analyzes the emission reduction strategies and optimal prof-
its of each member under different dual-channel models. The 
investment decisions of the two technologies and the impact 
of different dual-channel models are studied, which has theo-
retical significance for guiding the selection and transfor-
mation of low-carbon supplier dual-channel models. It has 
theoretical implications for guiding the selection and trans-
formation of dual-channel models for low-carbon suppliers.
Problem description and model assumptions
Problem description
In this paper, three dual-channel supply chain decision mod-
els were constructed for a secondary supply chain structure 
consisting of an abatement manufacturer and a low-carbon 
promotion retailer, where the manufacturer is the Stackel-
berg leader and the retailer is the follower (Xin et al. 2019; 
Wang et al. 2018). Considering the effects of low-carbon 
technology investment, blockchain technology promotion 
and consumer preferences on supply chain members, three 
decision models of traditional retailer dual channel, manu-
facturer’s online direct sales dual channel, and online distri-
bution dual channel were built (Yang et al. 2018), as shown 
in Fig. 1. Through a comparative analysis of equilibrium 
results, the supply chain emission reduction and marketing 
decisions under different channel models were studied to 
provide theoretical support for supply chain emission reduc-
tion strategies in the context of sustainable development.
Model assumptions
Assumption 1 Carbon emissions from retailer sales pro-
cesses are much lower than those from production and trans-
portation processes, so this paper only assumes that manu-
facturers make emissions reduction investments because of 
the constrainment of carbon emissions (Ma et al. 2014). It 
is assumed that emission reduction investment has no effect 
on the production cost of the product, and the higher the 
investment factor, the more difficult it is to reduce emissions 
(Yang et al.2017).

Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–65321 65307
Assumption 2 The manufacturer’s independent research 
and development of abatement technology requires invest-
ment in technology cost Ct. Referring to the cost form of 
carbon abatement investment with the established assump-
tions (Zhao et al. 2016), the investment cost Ct is set as a 
second-order differentiable convex function, i.e.,Ct = k� t
2∕2 , 
and C(0) = 0, C(+ ∞) = 1, C'(t) > 0, C''(t) > 0, t is the abate-
ment amount, and k� is the abatement cost coefficient. Also, 
considering that blockchain technology investment is also 
one of the main factors influencing consumers’ purchasing 
behavior, the blockchain technology investment cost can be 
set as I(b) = kbb
2∕2 and borne by retailers or distributors, b 
is the blockchain investment level, and kb is the blockchain 
cost coefficient (Sun and Fang 2022; Liu et al. 2020).
Assumption 3 In the analysis of market demand, the impact 
of emission reduction and blockchain technology investment 
strategy on product price, market competition, and supply 
chain profit are considered, and the following demand func-
tion can be obtained (Kai et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2018; Han 
and Wang 2018).
The demand function takes into account the effects of 
market volume, dual-channel sales price difference, emis-
sion reduction level, and low-carbon publicity, where r and 
d denote offline and online channels, respectively. d is the 
market demand, a is the market volume, h is the consumer 
online channel preference, p is the sales price, η and � are the 
low-carbon sensitivity coefficient and blockchain investment 
coefficient of the product, respectively, and γ represents the 
price sensitivity coefficient.
Assumption 4 Consumer demand for a product is more 
responsive to price changes in its own channel than to price 
changes of the product in another channel, and the price sen-
sitivity coefficient is set to be symmetric and weakly neutral 
0 < γ < 0.4 for the purpose of analysis (Zhao et al. 2016).
Model formulation and comparative analysis
Retailer dual‑channel model (Model A)
In the retailer dual-channel model, an online marketing 
channel is introduced by the retailer and the low-carbon 
products are sold through both offline and online dual chan-
nels. In the game process of both sides, firstly, the wholesale 
price w1 of low-carbon products is decided by the manufac-
turer, where the product supply prices of both channels are 
(1)dr = a(1 − h) − pr + �pd + �t + �b
(2)dd = ah − pd + �pr + �t + �b
the same; then, based on the wholesale price given by the 
manufacturer, the sales price pr1 and pd1 of products in tradi-
tional and e-commerce channels are set by the retailer, from 
which the demand function and decision profit function of 
the supply chain under the traditional retailer dual-channel 
model can be obtained as follows (He et al. 2018; Wang et al. 
2018; Yang et al. 2018).
The demand function is
The manufacturer profit function is
Correspondingly, the profit function of the retailer is

From Proposition 1, it is clear that under the retailer dual-
channel model, consumer channel preference is positively 
related to the dual-channel selling price pr1∗ and pd1∗ and 
dual-channel demand dd1∗ and dr1∗ . While the price sen-
sitivity coefficient affects the profitability of supply chain 
members differently under different consumer preferences. 
When consumers prefer traditional offline channels more 
(i.e., h < 0.5), it can be seen that � is negatively correlated 
with Δp1∗ (the price difference between offline and e-com-
merce channels). Conversely, when the e-commerce channel 
is dominant (i.e., h > 0.5), and � is positively correlated with 
Δp1
∗ . In the overall trend, the price differential is negatively 
correlated with the share of e-commerce channels, and the 
same is true for the change in the dual-channel demand 
differential.

 reaches the optimal value.
From Proposition 2, it is clear that in the retailer dual-
channel model, consumers’ low-carbon preferences posi-
tively affect both w1
∗ and pr1∗ and pd1∗ ; thus, the profit level 
is increased. Emission reduction t is concave and convexly 
correlated with ΠS
1
 and ΠM
1
 , respectively, and the nonlinearity 
of emission reduction on profit enhancement is mainly influ-
enced by the investment. Considering that the manufacturer 
needs to bear the cost of emission reduction, when 
𝜂2
4(1−𝛾)
< k𝜏 , there exists an optimal amount of emission 
reduction t1∗ for the manufacturer to optimize its profit. It 
can be seen that the sensitivity of consumer emission reduc-
tion and publicity will promote the manufacturer’s motiva-
tion to reduce emissions and promote its better implementa-
tion of carbon emission reduction. Also, increasing 
investment in blockchain technology will increase consumer 
trust, which in turn will have a positive impact on manufac-
turers’ carbon emission reductions.

Proof: The proof process is the same as that of Proposition 
2.
Proposition 3 shows that the impact of the level of low-
carbon marketing promotion on price, demand, and profit 
level is similar to the trend of emission reduction invest-
ment. By increasing the low-carbon publicity, it will increase 
the selling price and demand and boost the manufacturer’s 
profit. Also, considering the cost of publicity, when kb > k′
b
 , 
there exists an optimal level of marketing publicity b1∗ for 
retailers to optimize their profits, where b1∗ is also propor-
tional to the emission reduction t. Besides, low-carbon emis-
sion reduction and marketing promotion promote each other.
Manufacturer’s online direct sales dual‑channel 
model (Model B)
In the manufacturer’s online direct sales dual-channel 
model, two sales pathways exist for the manufacturer. 
Route 1: Low-carbon products are produced by the manu-
facturer to supply to offline retailers, who sell to consum-
ers based on emission reduction promotion; Route 2: The 
manufacturer also takes on the role of e-merchants and 
sells directly to consumers through the online route. At 
this point, the demand function is not only related to the 
emission reduction efforts and blockchain investment but 
also related to the sales price of the dual-channel prod-
ucts. In the game process, firstly, the offline channel sup-
ply price wr2 and the wholesale price pd2 of low-carbon 
products in the online direct sales channel are decided, 
and then the carbon emission reduction level t2 is decided 
by the manufacturer; secondly, based on the wholesale 
price wr2 given by the manufacturer, the offline sales 
price pr2 and the offline channel blockchain technology 
investment b2 are set by retailer. The demand function 
and decision profit function of the supply chain under the 
Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–65321 65309
manufacturer’s online direct sales dual-channel model can 
be obtained as follows (Wang et al. 2018; Xin et al. 2019):
The demand function is
The manufacturer profit function is
Correspondingly, the profit function of the retailer is

From Proposition 4, it can be seen that under the man-
ufacturer’s online direct sales dual-channel model, both 
manufacturer dual-channel price and retailer selling price 
are positively correlated with consumer low-carbon pref-
erences. Indicating that the higher the consumers’ low-
carbon preferences, both the manufacturer and retailer will 
adopt higher selling prices to obtain higher profits. When 
k𝜏 > k′
𝜏
 , the manufacturer has the best emission reduction t2∗ . 
Meanwhile, the emission reduction investment will always 
improve dual-channel demand and retailer profit, and the 
improvement to demand is linear. And the improvement in 
retailer profit increases with the increase of emission reduc-
tion investment, which is a concave function.

Proof: The proof process is the same as that of Proposition 4.
From Proposition 5, the impact of blockchain investment 
level on pricing and demand is influenced by the price sensi-
tivity coefficient γ , which has a similar trend to the impact of 
abatement investment. By increasing the level of blockchain 
investment, it will increase the selling price and demand and 
enhance the manufacturer’s profit. Meanwhile, when kb > k′
b
 , 
there exists an optimal blockchain investment level b2∗ for 
the retailer, which makes the retailer’s profit optimal.

Dual‑channel model of third‑party e‑commerce 
distribution (Model C)
In the dual-channel model of third-party e-commerce 
distribution, there exist three members: manufacturers, 
traditional retailers, and third-party e-commerce. Low-
carbon products are sold through offline and online chan-
nels, respectively. In the decentralized decision-making 
model, manufacturers, traditional retailers, and third-
party e-merchants make decisions based on the principle 
of maximizing their respective profits. In the game pro-
cess, firstly, the supply price wd3 , wr3 and carbon reduc-
tion rate t3 for online and offline channels are decided by 
the manufacturer; then, the offline sales price pr3 is set 
by the traditional retailer based on the wholesale price wr3 
given by the manufacturer, and the offline sales price pd3 
is set by the third-party e-merchant based on the whole-
sale price wd3 given by the manufacturer, and the retailer 
and the third-party e-merchant make separate decisions 
that do not affect each other. Where the retailer and the 
third-party e-merchant decide their respective blockchain 
investment levels br3 and bd3 , respectively, which leads 
to the decision profit function of the supply chain under 
the dual channel of third-party e-merchant distribution 
(Yang et al. 2018).
The demand function is
The manufacturer profit function is
Correspondingly, the profit function for a traditional 
retailer is
The profit function of the online retailer is
Theorem 3 The optimal decisions of the supply chain mem-
bers under the dual-channel model of online distribution for 
retailers are respectively.

From Proposition 6, it can be seen that under the dual-
channel model of third-party e-commerce distribution, when 
0 < h < h′ , consumers prefer the traditional retail channel, 
and the manufacturer’s retail channel pricing and the tradi-
tional retailer selling price are higher than the third-party 
e-commerce. When h′ < h < 1 , the preference of the third-
party e-commerce channel is higher, indicating that con-
sumer preference has a dominant role in inter-channel pric-
ing. Meanwhile, when 0 < h < h′′ , the demand of retailers is 
higher than the demand of third-party e-commerce channels. 
Since the low-carbon promotion is separately undertaken 
by retailers and third-party e-merchants, respectively, the 
inter-channel pricing and demand are influenced by the dif-
ference in blockchain investment Δb3 , and the party with 
higher blockchain investment gains higher pricing power. 
The Δb3 has an opposite effect on pricing and demand. This 
is in line with the reality that it is difficult to achieve both 
high prices and high demand under either party’s channel. 
And the trends of the differential affected by h, r are similar 
to that under the two-channel model for retailers.

Proof: The proof procedure is the same as the proof of

From Proposition 7, the abatement sensitivity coefficient 
is positively correlated with manufacturer dual-channel 
pricing, retailer and third-party e-commerce selling prices, 
and abatement investment and blockchain investment levels 
under the dual-channel model of third-party e-commerce 
distribution. The emission reduction investment t is posi-
tively correlated with both pricing and demand. When 
k𝜏 > k′

investment increases, the retailer’s profit increases. This is 
due to the fact that retailers are the beneficiaries of emission 
reduction, as they do not bear the cost of emission reduction, 
so the emission reduction investment shows a linear positive 
correlation with retailer profit.

Proposition 8 shows that under the dual-channel model of 
third-party e-commerce distribution, blockchain investment 
levels br3 and bd3 for both channels are positively correlated 
with the supply price, pricing, and demand for the prod-
uct, and both increase the manufacturer’s profit. However, 
the degree of impact on decisions under different channels 
differs, with the blockchain investment of the third-party 
e-commerce channel having a higher degree of impact on 
its own channel than the other channel, and the same for the 
retailer channel. When kb > k′

chain investment levels br3∗ and bd3∗ , respectively, which 
makes the traditional retailer profit and third-party e-com-

Algorithm analysis
The previous section analyzed the impact of low-carbon 
emission reduction and blockchain investment on the opti-
mal decision of the supply chain under three different dual-
channel models. Based on this, this section uses numerical 
simulations based on MATLAB 2018b platform to further 
verify the rationality and correctness of the above conclu-
sions, taking the core parameters of emission reduction 
investment, blockchain investment, and inter-channel as the 
Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–6532165312
influencing factors. The simulation results are obtained by 
programming and calculating the model formula above. In 
conducting the analysis, the values of fixed parameters are 
set as follows in order to simplify the arithmetic example and 
conform to the feasible region: a = 150, � = 1, � = 1, b = 10, 
k� = 10, kb = 10 (Wang et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018).
Impact of emission reduction investment 
and blockchain investment on supply chain profit
In analyzing the impact of emission reduction investment t 
and blockchain investment b, given the dual-channel impact 
parameters h, � , such that h = 0.4, � = 0.2, the impact of t and 
b changes on the pricing and optimal profit of supply chain 
members is specifically analyzed.
(1) Retailers’ dual-channel arithmetic analysis.
As can be seen from Fig. 2, under the retailer dual-chan-
nel model, the investment of emission reduction technol-
ogy t and blockchain technology b will improve the profit 
of members by increasing the selling price and demand for 
products (Liu et al. 2021b). However, considering the impact 
of abatement and blockchain costs, the gaining effect on the 
cost investment side and the beneficiary side is different. 
The beneficiary side, which is in a ride-along role, experi-
ences a nearly linear increase in profits as the level of invest-
ment increases. The investment side, on the other hand, is 
influenced by the investment cost, and the profit shows a 
parabolic trend of convex function with a maximum profit 
point. The impact of t and b on supply chain members has 
the same trend.
Figure 3 shows the trend of the interaction impact of t 
and b on the profits of manufacturers and retailers. It can 
be found that the decision process is always dominated by 
the manufacturer, while the interaction has a higher degree 
and complexity of impact on the manufacturer’s profit than 
on the retailer’s profit. Analysis of the overall trend shows 
that when the level of blockchain investment b is low, the 
market for low-carbon products is depressed. At this time, 
increasing the investment in emission reduction technology 
t has a limited impact on retailers’ profits while significantly 
increasing manufacturers’ cost investment. However, as 
the blockchain investment b increases, it can significantly 
improve the effectiveness of the manufacturer’s emission 
reduction investment and make the overall profit of the sys-
tem increase rapidly, while the technical cost borne by the 
retailer is maintained at a lower profit level. A similar con-
clusion is also obtained in the study of Wu et al. (2021): 
“When the low-carbon market is in a downturn, improving 
consumers’ low-carbon awareness will help promote low-
carbon operations.” Therefore, retailers should increase 
blockchain investment in the dual-channel model while a 
reasonable investment in emission reduction, which can 
achieve the optimal profit of the supply chain system. How-
ever, at this time, the difference in profits between supply 
and sales is large. And better win–win cooperation can be 
achieved by sharing part of the blockchain investment costs 
of retailers in the subsequent study. Zhang and Yu (2021) 
and Ghosh et al. (2020) have carried out similar research on 
emission reduction and achieved supply chain coordination.
(2) Manufacturer’s online direct marketing dual-channel 
arithmetic analysis.

chain investment on profits
Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–65321 65313
As can be seen from Fig. 4, when the dual-channel model 
of online direct sales by the manufacturer is adopted, the 
investment of t is more flexible in regulating the online chan-
nel, while the investment of b focuses on influencing the tra-
ditional channel marketing. The online channel is the main 
way for the manufacturer’s market regulation. And when the 
product abatement investment t is low, the manufacturer will 
drive the traditional channel sales by reducing the selling 
price of the online channel and conducting low-price mar-
keting to stimulate market demand. Comparing the profits 
of supply chain members shows that the manufacturer is 
responsible for both the supply of products in traditional 
channels and also undertakes sales in online direct sales 
channels, and the benefit of emission reduction is more 
obvious. At the early stage of low-carbon investment, profits 
increase significantly, and the trend of growth slows down in 
the later stage of investment due to the impact of costs. The 
retailer, on the other hand, is relatively passive in the supply 
chain and suffers from limited gains in emission reduction 
technology while bearing the full cost of blockchain invest-
ments (Xin et al. 2019).
As shown in Fig. 5, by analyzing the trend of the impact 
of t and b interaction on manufacturer and retailer profits, 
it can be seen that high emissions reduction investments 
come at the expense of some retailers’ profits, and the gains 
to manufacturers’ profits are even more pronounced. This 
also leads to the fact that manufacturers are more inclined 
to invest more in abatement technology in the dual-channel 
model of online direct sales by manufacturers, which is con-
ducive to low-carbon product promotion. And this trend is 
more obvious with high blockchain investment. However, 
with low-carbon investment, it also leads to an increase in 
the profit differential between manufacturers and retailers, 
which is not conducive to long-term healthy cooperation 
between them. This is similar to the findings of Ghosh et al. 
(2020), who argue that “when the compatibility of products 
in the online channel is high, increasing the online chan-
nel can be accepted by the manufacturer and is detrimental 
to the retailer’s entire supply chain.” Therefore, under this 
model, a higher blockchain investment and reasonable car-
bon emission reduction investment are the best decisions.

arithmetic analysis.

As can be seen from Fig. 6, under the dual-channel model 
of third-party e-commerce distribution, the impact of t and 
b on members’ profits is similar to that of the dual-channel 
model of retailers. As the investment increases, the manu-
facturer, as the low-carbon investment, is affected by the 
investment cost and has a parabolic increasing trend with 
a peak profit point. Comparing the three types of models 
at the same time, it is found that the ratio of the manufac-
turer’s technology benefit to cost investment influences the 
peak region. As the beneficiaries, retailers and third-party 
e-commerce companies have increased profits.
Figure 7 shows the trend of the impact of t and b interac-
tions on members’ profits. It can be seen that the interaction 
has the same trend of impact on retailers and third-party 
e-merchants, and the channel share h affects the difference 
between their profits. When the market is low, manufactur-
ers’ higher-cost investment greatly reduces their own prof-
its and is harmful to the overall supply chain revenue. In 
contrast, the incentive of blockchain investments to market 
demand can significantly boost overall profits (Liu et al. 
2021b). The enhancement effect is more obvious when 
manufacturers have high emission reduction investments. 
Besides, blockchain investment costs are shared by retail-
ers and third-party e-commerce, and the loss of profit to 
the selling side is not obvious. Therefore, the third-party 
e-commerce distribution should invest in maximizing block-
chain technology while making appropriate emission reduc-
tion investments to make the supply chain system achieve 
optimal profits.
Impact of dual‑channel model on enterprise pricing 
and supply chain profit
The following section analyzes the impact of dual-channel 
parameters on supply chain profit, and the analysis process 
takes the optimal emission reduction and the optimal block-
chain investment level for t and b, respectively, and specifi-
cally analyzes the impact of the change of the online channel 
share h on the pricing and optimal profit of supply chain 
members.
(1) Analysis of retailer dual-channel calculations.
As shown in Fig. 8, when the dual-channel model of 
retailers is adopted, the online channel share h indirectly 
affects the channel pricing by influencing the channel 
demand. Analyzed from the member profit perspective, the 
different h affects the revenue between the two channels of 
the retailer. When the inter-channel share difference ∆h is 
large, there is healthy competition between the online and 
offline channels and the total profit of the retailer increases. 
When the offline channel is dominant, the supply chain is 
still dominated by the traditional channel and the online 
channel will attract consumers by reducing the selling price. 
The increase of h will reduce the demand and revenue of 
traditional channels, resulting in lower profits for manufac-
turers and lower profits for the supply chain as a whole.
(2) Dual-channel online direct marketing for manufac-
turer.
As shown in Fig. 9, under the manufacturer’s online direct 
sales dual channel, the manufacturer has both the traditional 
channel and the online direct sales channel. Therefore, the 
Fig. 6  Impact of emission 
reduction rates and blockchain 
investment on third-party 
e-commerce distribution deci-
sions (a) Impact of t on profits; 
(b) Impact of b on profits
(a) (b)
Fig. 7  Interaction of emission reduction rates and blockchain invest-
ment on profits
Environmental Science and Pollution Research  (2022) 29:65304–65321 65315
increase of h is the most significant profit enhancement for 
the manufacturer. When h is low, the online direct sales 
channel attracts consumers by lowering the selling price, 
which will even be lower than the supply price of the tradi-
tional channel. When h is high, the online channel dominates 
and the online direct sales revenue takes up almost all of 
the manufacturer’s profit. At this time, the total profit level 
of the system is higher, but the traditional channel market 
is negative, and retailers’ profits are damaged, forming a 
monopoly situation for the manufacturer.
(3) Retailer online distribution dual channel.
As shown in Fig. 10, there is a significant symmetry in 
the product pricing and profit distribution of supply chain 
members with the variation of h, under the dual channels 
of retailer online distribution. The change in manufacturer 
profits reflects the level of aggregate demand, and healthy 
competition is formed between the dual channels when the 
∆h is high. Traditional retailers and third-party e-commerce 
profits are directly affected by their respective market shares.
Comparative analysis of supply chain decisions 
under three dual‑channel models
(1) Analysis of enterprise profits under three dual-channel 
models.
The following section analyzes the comparison of profit 
levels of the three dual-channel modes under different 
technological investments to provide support for the sup-
ply chain’s decision to reduce emissions under different 
market conditions. As shown in Fig. 11, the following con-
clusions can be drawn: (1) from the overall trend analysis,

 . Among the 
three dual-channel models, model A has higher profits for 
supply chain members than the other channels. (2) For manu-
facturer profits, there is a peak profit point as the t increases. 
This is similar to the findings of Wang et al. (2019), who 
argue that “given consumers’ low-carbon preferences, there 
is an optimal level of emission reduction that maximizes 
the overall benefit of the supply chain.” Among the three 
models, the level of t at the peak point: model B > model 
A > model C. It indicates that the ratio of low-carbon gain to 
cost investment in the supply chain determines the initiative 
of manufacturers’ emission reduction investment. (3) There 
are low-carbon investment parties and beneficiaries, and the 
investment level is influenced by the combined effect of cost 
investment and trust, while the beneficiary effect is related 
to the dual-channel model and the channel share. Regarding 
this conclusion, the research of He et al. (2018) also shows 
that the profits of supply chain members are not only related 
to their own input level and risk aversion but also related to 
the input level of other members.
The comparison of profit levels of three dual-channel 
models under different dual-channel parameters is ana-
lyzed, as shown in Fig. 12. The following conclusions can be

drawn: (1) With the change of parameters, there is a crosso-
ver in the trend of profit change of supply chain members, 
and the difference in the trend of change is obvious. (2) For 
manufacturer profit, the profit of model B has a positive cor-
relation, while the speed of increase is significantly higher 
than others. For retailer and third-party e-commerce profits, 
the profit change for model A is significantly higher than 
others. (3) The system is less stable under high channel share 
difference ∆h and high price sensitivity coefficient γ, which 
can easily form extreme channel dominance. (4) The dif-
ference in change trends is due to the fact that the online 
channel is dominated by retailers, manufacturers, and third-
party e-commerce under the three channels, respectively. h 
and γ increase will increase the share of online channels in 
the supply chain, and the profits of supply chain members 
dominating online channels increase significantly, which 
affects the profit level among members.
(2) Analysis of emission reduction levels under three 
dual-channel models.
As Fig. 13 shows the comparison of emission reduc-
tion levels of three dual-channel modes under different 
dual-channel parameters. It can be found that for emission 
reductions, t1 decreases linearly and t2 increases linearly as 
h increases, while t3 is not affected by the change of h. With 
the increase of γ, t1, t2, and t3 emission reductions are accel-
erated. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The 
increase of h and γ will promote the market share of the 
online channel, while t is driven by the manufacturer’s profit, 
and the more the manufacturer’s channel share, the higher 
the emission reduction tends to be. (2) In order to guarantee 
higher supply chain system emission reduction, the profit 
of both channels should be linked to the manufacturer to 
make greater t through the profit drive. This is similar to the 
findings of Wang et al. (2018), who argue that “tighter cap-
and-trade regulation and higher low-carbon preferences have 
both stimulated manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions 
in their production processes.” (3) In order to make the low-
carbon product market demand higher, retailers should be 
considered to invest more in blockchain technology. Regard-
ing the cooperation among members, the research of Han

and Wang (2018) also shows that if the e-commerce platform 
can invest in technology or share the carbon emission reduc-
tion cost of manufacturers, the performance of the electronic 
supply chain will be greatly improved.
Conclusion
In this study, based on the consideration that consumers have 
channel preferences and low-carbon sensitivity, a Stackel-
berg game model dominated by manufacturers was con-
structed to study the optimal decision of each member in the 
dual channels of a traditional retailer, manufacturer’s online 
direct sales, and third-party e-commerce under the joint 
strategy of emission reduction investment and blockchain 
investment. Consumer channel preference, low-carbon sensi-
tivity coefficient, price sensitivity coefficient, unit abatement 
volume, abatement cost coefficient, blockchain investment 
level, and blockchain cost coefficient were jointly introduced 
in the above three dual-channel structures to analyze the 
influence of the above parameters on manufacturers’ chan-
nel selection and abatement strategy, aiming to provide a 
reference for channel selection and joint abatement strategy 
of supply chain members. Finally, the reasonableness and 
correctness of the obtained conclusions and propositions 
were verified by numerical simulation. The conclusions and 
management implications are as follows.
(1) In terms of profits of supply chain members, the 
optimal emission reduction of manufacturers and block-
chain investment levels of retailers under different dual-
channel models are different. For manufacturer profits, 
there is a peak profit point when the abatement cost 
factor is greater than a certain threshold. Meanwhile, 
there exists a specific blockchain investment threshold, 
and when the retailer propaganda cost coefficient is 
greater than this threshold, there is a peak in retailer 
profits. And emission reduction technology and block-
chain technology have mutual benefits. And in the emis-
sion reduction decision-making process, there are the 
technology investment side and beneficiary side, and 
the level of investment is affected by the double gain 
effect of low-carbon emission reduction and trust and 
the combined effect of cost investment. Besides, the 
beneficiary effect is related to dual-channel modes and 
channel share. It indicates that the ratio of low-carbon 
gain to cost investment in the supply chain determines

the initiative of manufacturers’ emission reduction 
investment and retailers’ blockchain investment.
(2) The profits of supply chain members are obviously 
affected by the change in dual-channel parameters. 
With the increase of dual-channel parameters, there is 
a crossover in the changing trend of supply chain mem-
bers’ profit and the difference in the changing trend is 
obvious, which affects profit distribution among chan-
nels. Meanwhile, through the analysis, it is found that 
the difference in the changing trend is mainly due to the 
different leaders of the online channel under different 
dual-channel models. And the increase of h and γ will 
enhance the share of online channels in the supply chain 
and significantly increase the profit of supply chain 
members dominating online channels. Meanwhile, high 
channel share difference ∆h and high price sensitivity 
coefficient γ will result in a crossover in system stabil-
ity, which is easy to form extreme channel dominance. 
And it is not conducive to the long-term cooperation 
and development of members.
(3) In terms of dual channels selection, through the com-
parison of profits and emission reductions under the 
three channels, it is shown that when the same level of 
low-carbon investment is made, the profit of members 
under the traditional retail dual-channel model > manu-
facturer’s online direct sales dual-channel model > third-
party e-commerce distribution dual-channel model; in the 
process of changing channel parameters, the third-party 
e-commerce distribution channel model has checks and 
balances among multiple members and is least affected 
by channel changes; from the emission reduction perspec-
tive analysis, influenced by the manufacturer’s channel 
share, the manufacturer’s online direct sales dual-channel 
model > traditional retail dual-channel model > third-
party e-commerce distribution dual-channel model. It can 
be found that the emission reduction investment is driven 
by the profit of the manufacturer. The more the emission 
reduction channel share of the manufacturer, the higher 
the emission reduction investment.
(4) In terms of emission reduction decision, there is an 
optimal emission reduction cost threshold, and when 
the emission reduction cost coefficient is greater than 
this certain threshold, optimal emission reduction can 
be achieved under the different dual-channel channel 
modes. Meanwhile, there are specific blockchain invest-
ment thresholds in different dual-channel modes, and the 
increase of the threshold value will improve the emission 
reduction. Therefore, considering that emissions reduc-
tions are driven by manufacturer profits, the profits of 
both channels should be linked to the manufacturer to 
secure higher supply chain system emission reductions, 
and greater emission reduction investment should be 
made through profit-driven. Retailers should be consid-
ered to increase blockchain investment to make higher 
market demand for low-carbon products.
The above findings have the following management 
implications for the channel selection and emission reduc-
tion strategies of dual-channel supply chains in a low-carbon 
environment: First, when manufacturers choose different 
dual-channel models, there are different optimal emission 
reductions to achieve optimal profits. And the best dual-
channel model and emission reduction investment can be 
matched according to the market environment and reality. 
Second, the profit of traditional retailers can take advan-
tage of offline physical stores, such as improving service 
levels, improving the consumer experience, and providing 
door-to-door services to gain a competitive advantage and 
thus increase profits. Third, low-carbon campaigns by retail-
ers are beneficial to enhance profit levels and can increase 
the competitive advantage of the channel at the same time. 
Joint promotion models can be launched based on online 
direct sales and third-party distribution, and some promo-
tion models can be used to attract consumers to purchase 
through online channels. Fourth, when dual-channel leaders 
formulate marketing strategies, on the one hand, emerging 
information technologies such as blockchain can be used to 
consolidate corporate image and increase corporate reputa-
tion. To drive the development of other channels, so as to 
form a spiral upward and alternate development, this kind 
of endogenous competition can greatly promote the internal 
self-innovation power of enterprises. At the same time, it 
will also bring a better experience to consumers and promote 
the healthy development of society.
Limitations and future direction
However, this study only preliminary studies the optimal 
decision-making and emission reduction strategies of supply 
chain members under different channel structures and has 
not carried out the research on the coordinated decision-
making of profit sharing and cost-sharing among mem-
bers, which has limitations. Meanwhile, in the process of 
research on emission reduction strategies, the constraints 
such as carbon caps and carbon trading are not considered 
comprehensively, and follow-up research is required. In view 
of the limited dynamic analysis subjects in this paper, future 
research can start from the perspective of a multi-subject 
game, comprehensively considering the impact of carbon 
caps and carbon trading constraints on the joint emission 
reduction strategies of manufacturers and retailers so as to 
provide a comprehensive and optimized solution for the sus-
tainable development of low-carbon products.
