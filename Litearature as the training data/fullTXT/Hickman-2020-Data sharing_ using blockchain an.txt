The extension of blockchain use for nonfinancial domains has revealed opportunities to the health care sector that answer the need for
efficient and effective data and information exchanges in a secure and transparent manner. Blockchain is relatively novel in health care
and particularly for data analytics, although there are examples of improvements achieved. We provide a systematic review of block-
chain uses within the health care industry, with a particular focus on the in vitro fertilization (IVF) field. Blockchain technology in the
fertility sector, including data sharing collaborations compliant with ethical data handling within confines of international law, allows
for large-scale prospective cohort studies to proceed at an international scale. Other opportunities include gamete donation and match-
ing, consent sharing, and shared resources between different clinics. (Fertil Steril� 2020;114:927–33. �2020 by American Society for

VIEWS AND REVIEWS
archives of large, global, and diverse data (6), representative
of different patient demographics and clinical settings (7).
With more than 2.7 million ART cycles per year worldwide
(8), this goal should be theoretically easily achievable because
sufficient varied data exist. The challenge lies with collecting,
handling, amalgamating, and accessing the necessary data.
First, health care data are highly sensitive, requiring strict
regulation and adherence to standards with regard to preser-
vation of the privacy and confidentiality of the patients,
traceability and transparency of all interactions with the
data, accountability of the data controller and the data pro-
cessor, security of access to the data, and other ethics consid-
erations (9). The consequence has been a convoluted process
from the time the data are collected to the time research can
start, which includes consenting of participants, data organi-
zation and processing, regulatory approval, ethics approval,
and local clinic approval. This process usually takes months
if not years to complete, and it not only extends the time
and the cost of learning from and applying clinical data to
improve clinical practice but also limits exploratory research
on multicenter data to answer very specific study questions.
Streamlining this process in a manner that preserves the stan-
dards of research would therefore help the field evolve faster,
translating benefits directly to professionals and patients.
Second, the data from the 2.7 million cycles performed
each year worldwide vary in definition and standards of vali-
dation with regards to accuracy and completeness. Moreover,
most in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics are still collecting data
either wholly or in part in paper form. This highlights the need
to enhance the digitization of IVF clinics and incorporate a
culture of understanding the value of data integrity and to
ensure that the various solutions employed to collect data
are integrated with each other. Paper and inaccurate or
disjointed data greatly reduce the potential of AI analytics
tools.
Third, the IVF field lacks a system to amalgamate data
effectively. At the global level, organizations such as the In-
ternational Committee Monitoring Assisted Reproductive
Technologies (ICMART) are only capable of collecting sum-
mary data, which is impossible to verify. At the national level,
data sets such as that from the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority (HFEA) have obvious limitations.
Indeed, they are set up for regulatory purposes not for
research, so they lack the detail necessary to answer basic
clinical practice questions. Not all countries have such
mandatory registries, and an international version of the
HFEA registry is not possible given the varying regulations
among countries on how data move across international bor-
ders. As a result, it is very difficult for AI researchers to access
sufficient good-quality data to use in training algorithms to
make relevant predictions that could help clinicians make
better decisions. In the process of handling sensitive health
data, traceability and immutability should be prerequisites
to track and monitor any interaction with that data.
A blockchain is an immutable ledger containing a time-
stamped series of records of data that is managed by a distrib-
uted, decentralized cluster of computers. It records all events
occurring in the network in a ‘‘chain of blocks’’ that cannot be
altered once recorded. By making this ledger accessible to all
928
members of the network, it allows trustless transactions. For
public blockchains, anyone can be part of the network, and
the blockchain is maintained by the public community. This
is the case, for example, for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash.
For private blockchains, entrants need a permission to partic-
ipate in the network, and the ledger of transactions is only
accessible to validated participants.
Blockchain has been around since 2008 when the Bitcoin
white paper was published, setting the groundwork for a
distributed ledger technology that, at the time, focused on
electronic financial transactions. Since then, new potential
uses have been found for the technology. The second genera-
tion of blockchain allowed for smart contracts (10). The third
generation has extended to nonfinancial applications of
blockchain (e.g., insurance, supply chain, dispute resolution,
identity management, and health care). The novelty lies in
the application of blockchain-based technologies in health
care as a tool to address sensitive data-sharing challenges
(11). We provide a systematic review of blockchain uses
within the human health care industry, and blockchain’s rele-
vance to the IVF field.
METHODS AND DESIGN
This review was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines
to search four different scientific databases (PubMed, IEEE
Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus) with the search string
‘‘blockchain’’ AND (‘‘health*’’ OR ‘‘medic*’’ OR ‘‘biomedic*’’
OR ‘‘clinic*’’ OR ‘‘fertility*’’ OR ‘‘IVF*’’). Relevant publications
were selected and analyzed. The search was performed on
January 26, 2020.
Inclusion criteria
The review includes peer-reviewed publications with a major
focus related to the application of blockchain in health care,
papers written in English. Only journals with a selective edito-
rial policy and tracked by Clarivate, Scopus, or SciELO were
considered.
Exclusion criteria
We excluded studies that were performed with nonhuman
species. We also excluded studies published in languages
other than English and reviews.
Study selection
After the duplicates were removed, two investigators inde-
pendently assessed the titles and abstracts of all the articles.
Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded.
After this first step, the text of the selected studies was eval-
uated fully. Disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved
by consensus or with the involvement of a third author.
The search across all databases did not reveal any block-
chain proposed for the purpose of IVF/fertility. As a system-
atic literature review from academic search engines, this
study did not include blockchain technologies advertised on
the Internet or elsewhere, as this was considered outside the

scope of this study. Additionally, the use of English terms in
the search engine excludes publications in foreign languages.
RESULTS
The review revealed 55 studies proposing various blockchain
models with different use cases in health care (Fig. 1;
Supplemental Table 1, available online) (12–67).
Technologies that enable AI only represented a minority of
the studies among those using blockchain in health care.
Most blockchain publications (69%, 38 papers) were in
the area of general health, followed by clinical trials/biomed-
ical research. There were also examples in diabetes, oncology,
chronic disease, insomnia, dentistry, genomics, and pain
management. The search across all databases did not reveal
any blockchain proposed for the purpose of IVF/fertility.
The number of publications increased from four publications
in 2016 to 26 publications in 2018, and have since decreased
to 10 in 2019 (Supplemental Table 2, available online). Of
these proposed blockchains, 84% did not involve federated
learning and 16% did (Supplemental Table 2). Over quarter
of these proposed blockchains were developed in the People’s
Republic of China (30%), and 20% by the United States, and
others were by collaborations across countries (Fig. 2). Over
half the publications used were proposed for electronic med-
ical records (56%) and remote patient monitoring (13%); 5%
were designed for drug/pharmaceutic supply chain, 9% for
biomedical research/education, and 11% for health data ana-
lytics (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
This systematic literature review demonstrates that
blockchain-based technology has been used in many health
care fields (predominantly general health), with the overall
number of publications increasing over time. Most publica-
tions involve academic projects rather than industry, with
the People’s Republic of China and the United States leading
in terms of the number of publications.
Most studies focused on facilitating data-sharing be-
tween clinics in a decentralized way and among research in-
stitutions to enhance evidence-based medicine and improve
standards of care. A marginal number of studies focused on
data analytics applications despite the importance of the
use case. One specific use of private blockchain technology
can be to orchestrate in a secure and traceable way the access
to decentralized sensitive data by predictive algorithms and,
as such, enable AI studies in health care.
In this application, the first step of a blockchain involves
a ‘‘data requester’’ such as a researcher or a data scientist re-
questing access for the algorithm to access data from the
‘‘data provider,’’ such as a clinic or a hospital. Using block-
chain in this application, this transaction request is recorded
as a block of information in an immutable ledger. The
network then verifies and manages the transaction through
a cluster of computers, ensuring security standards are met
and creating another block. A permission system ensures
the access is permitted, creating another block. The chain of
immutable blocks allows for monitoring the circulation of
models and algorithms from one data provider to the other
VOL. 114 NO. 5 / NOVEMBER 2020
and provides reliable traceability of such transfers. It also pro-
vides the proof that different members execute the transac-
tions they committed to doing, and makes them
accountable for their actions. The process can then generalize
to a large number of data providers and data requesters for
unlimited progress (Fig. 3).
In the context of data analytics, federated learning is a
learning paradigm that seeks to address the problem of data
governance and privacy. It enables the efficient training of
machine learning algorithms on various decentralized data
sets without the need for exchanging the underlying data
sets (7). The main advantage of this solution is that it allows
learning from data located in different sources without the
need of centralizing the data, as in traditional machine
learning tasks.
Federated learning technology on its own solves the
problem of efficient learning from decentralized data sets
but does not respond to the security requirements of sensitive
data access and processing within hospitals. Blockchain tech-
nology combined with federated learning as the baseline for a
democratized data-sharing platform may be the technology
to resolve the existing challenges in data sharing in ART,
providing a potential solution for accountable and secure
data sharing to allow collaborations that are compliant with
ethical data handling within the confines of international
law. This would allow trustless collaboration between data
providers and data processors to enable powerful data ana-
lytics from multicenter, sensitive data and unlock the poten-
tial of AI. The use of blockchain-based technologies would
certainly be more responsible and compliant with the required
high standards of health care data-handling than the
currently used paper-based or unsecure and/or inefficient
digital data methods.
The fact that no publications were found in academic
journals for the use of blockchain for data sharing in ART
does not mean that blockchain is not currently used in ART.
We have recently joined the Healthchain and the Apricity
Data Hub collaborative data-sharing projects, confirming
929

that blockchain has found its way into the ART field. We also
are aware of other potential commercial uses of blockchain in
ART, including facilitating gamete and embryo donation
matching, and gamete and embryo donation to research;
traceability of data during cryotransport and cryostorage in
centralized biorepositories; and sharing resources between
clinics and consent sharing between research and clinical in-
stitutions. In particular, signing consents would be a textbook
use case for blockchain in IVF. Signed consents along with
timestamps can be added to the blockchain. Because the chain
is immutable, it is impossible to unsign or change the time
stamp after the fact. Blockchain would also be useful as an
immutable ledger for arrival, departure, and expiry records
in tracking clinic supplies, enhancing transparency in the
supply of equipment and consumables, including drugs.

Scalability, speed, interoperability, security, and patient
engagement are among the challenges of blockchain-based
technologies reported in some of the publications listed
earlier. Although some of these challenges have been resolved
with the most recent blockchain applications, these chal-
lenges are best mitigated using ART-specific standards that
do not currently exist. A multidisciplinary consensus group
met during the European Society of Human Reproduction
and Embryology (ESHRE) 2020 conference, and the publica-
tion of standards specific for data-sharing for academic rea-
sons is expected to be published in 2020. Strategically,
these standards should ensure that if different blockchain ap-
plications are set up by different vendors, they are capable of
integrating with each other thanks to interoperation with a
single source of truth. For now, without a standardization it

would be very difficult to integrate different blockchains
created for different purposes.
With regards to security protecting privacy, there is a
need to ensure that [1] the identity of a patient in a blockchain
is not revealed, especially when combined together with data
from other sources, which is a particular risk for patients who
have rare conditions; and [2] the encryption cannot be
breached by intentional malicious attacks, as has been re-
ported with exchange platforms associated with cryptocur-
rency blockchains. The private keys used for data
encryption require special attention with regards to restricted
access. Compliance needs to be kept up to date with the
continuously evolving regulations on health care data protec-
tion (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the
‘‘right to be forgotten,’’ and the U.K. Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act of 2008). Security threats can be mitigated
with rigorous software development processes and permis-
sioned protocols.
Regarding scalability, the high volume of data in ART,
with increasing image- and video-based data, means that
special attention needs to be paid to speed and scalability of
the blockchain platform to prevent performance degradation
and latency. For instance, platforms should avoid all the no-
des in a platform to validate a process (12). All these chal-
lenges can be overcome with blockchain smart contracts
(10), which outline defined rules to frame how the health
care data are handled. Such rules may themselves introduce
bias. Engaging patients during the consenting process is
another challenge that could introduce bias. For instance,
older patients may be less likely to engage than younger
patients (13).
Local protection laws are strengthening all over the
world. In many countries, it is now forbidden for ART patient
VOL. 114 NO. 5 / NOVEMBER 2020
data to leave the country, even when it is pseudonymized,
which restricts international studies from emerging. This is
preventing progress in the ART field, especially with regards
to AI. A decentralized data structure secured with
blockchain-based technology would keep the data in the
clinic, under the control of the data controller (i.e., the clinic
responsible for the data) with only algorithms moving be-
tween clinics. The algorithms would only access a pseudony-
mized version of the data, preserving confidentiality of
identifiable information. The movement of algorithms across
international borders is compliant with current international
regulations. Therefore, blockchain-based technologies allow
us to have our cake and eat it, too: we do not have to compro-
mise between protecting the patient’s privacy and evolving as
a field based on large-scale collaborative data sharing. Such
data-sharing technologies meet the legal, ethical, and infor-
mation governance compliance standards.
Traditional multipartner cohort studies require a high
level of trust between different centers. Trust can be achieved
by a combination of reputation, human relationships, and/or
strong contracts. Technology and, more specifically, block-
chain applications have a great complementary role to play
in enforcing trust for multipartner studies by framing what
can and cannot be done with the data and the results of com-
putations (i.e., AI predictive models).
Research ‘‘rules’’ are required for AI applications. Some
guidance documents, while being relevant, are being up-
dated to include AI (e.g., TRIPOD, CONSORT/SPIRIT). Simi-
larly, journal referees may struggle if not well equipped with
the nuances of being able to differentiate between a good
and poor AI study. Another challenge in AI review is the
reproducibility of experiments. With the traceability of
events that occurred on the data with a blockchain-based
931
VIEWS AND REVIEWS
technology, it may be easier to reproduce the results of an
experiment.
Blockchain-based technologies for data sharing in ART
promote collaborative research and innovation while
reducing the cost of innovation validation and implementa-
tion. It is the natural progression for the ART field, in line
with other areas of health care. Pattern recognition across
different data sets can quickly help address the issue of repro-
ducibility, which is often the downside to small single-site AI
applications.
