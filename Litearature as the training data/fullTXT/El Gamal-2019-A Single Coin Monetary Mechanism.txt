A Single Coin Monetary Mechanism for Distributed Cooperative
Interference Management
Aly El Gamal , Member, IEEE, and Hesham El Gamal, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract—We present an example, where a distributed coor-
dinated protocol supported by a simple monetary mechanism
leads to achieving optimal information theoretic degrees of free-
dom gains. The considered setting is that of a linear interference
network, where cooperative transmission is allowed, but at no
cost in terms of the overall backhaul load. We show that a sim-
ple monetary mechanism that consists only of one coin type can
enable the achievability of the optimal centralized solution. The
proposed greedy distributed algorithm relies on incentivizing the
users to share their resources in one channel use, in return of
credit they receive for maximizing their rate gains in future chan-
nel uses. This example is the first in its class and it opens the door
for constructing a unified framework for monetary mechanisms
for optimal interference management and spectrum sharing. This
problem carries the promise of a significant impact as blockchain
techniques open the door for implementing such mechanisms in
practice.

I. INTRODUCTION
THE PROBLEM of interference management in next gen-
eration infrastructural wireless networks is expected to
have a very different nature from its current one. On one
hand, the anticipated quality of service requirements from
these networks are unprecedented, with new data-intensive
applications like virtual reality and 360 videos as well as new
applications that have very high reliability and low latency
requirements like those supported by vehicular networks. On
the other hand, new technological advancements are open-
ing opportunities to meet the new requirements and achieve
significant performance gains. In particular, cooperative com-
munication (also known as Coordinated Multi-Point or
CoMP) has been shown to hold the promise of delivering sig-
nificant rate gains while simultaneously reducing the delay
requirements, even when restricted to local cooperation strate-
gies that do not require sharing of messages between distant
nodes in the network (see [1], [2]). The potential of coopera-
tive communication, however, seems to have been reported
thus far for centralized scenarios, due to the fact that the
achieved gains are asymmetric across all participating users
in the network in every channel use (see [3]). Having a

robust economic framework could alleviate this problem,
and enable efficient distributed cooperation strategies, where
mutual trust is established by a monetary mechanism that
incentivizes users to offer help in one channel use in exchange
of credit that they could use in future channel uses. Here, we
present the first example of such a blockchain empowered
technique.
In this letter, we consider the linear interference network
introduced by Wyner [4]. A message can be assigned to
more than one transmitter to enable CoMP transmission,
but the average number of messages per transmitter has to
be at most one. The considered rate criterion is the per
user Degrees of Freedom (puDoF). This problem was settled
in [5] for the case when messages are assigned to transmit-
ters through a centralized controller. It was further shown
in [6] that the linear network solution could be used to
achieve significant gains for general cellular network mod-
els. However, the optimal solution reaches a non-integer
puDoF, where some users have to be inactive in each
channel use. Hence, a myopic solution where each user opti-
mizes its own rate in each channel use is suboptimal. Here,
we show how a greedy distributed algorithm that maximizes
local benefit leads to the optimal centralized solution, when
supported by a simple monetary mechanism that has only
one coin type and a simple coordination protocol that relies
on 2-bit messages. We believe that the presented example
opens the door for a general paradigm of backhaul and spec-
trum resource sharing based on blockchain-enabled monetary
mechanisms.
Distributed interference management schemes inspired by
information theoretic analysis have been considered in the
literature. For example, in [7], a distributed interference
alignment algorithm is proposed and its performance at
finite SNR is evaluated (see also [1, Ch. 4] for an exten-
sion to cooperative communication). In [8], a graph col-
oring algorithm based on local node knowledge is ana-
lyzed, and shown to approach optimal interference avoidance
performance with low computational complexity. Distributed
scheduling based on graph coloring is also analyzed in [9],
while incorporating results from network information the-
ory beyond simple interference avoidance. Finally, in [10]
and [11], distributed interference management strategies are
presented using base station cooperation over a rate-limited
backhaul in the downlink and uplink, respectively. The
distinguishing aspect of this letter is its focus on the
incentive mechanism that enables a greedy distributed strat-
egy to mimic the optimal fully coordinated centralized
strategy.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND NOTATION
We use the standard model for the K-user Wyner’s lin-
ear interference network with single-antenna transmitters and
receivers,
Yi (t) =
i∑
j=max(1,i−1)
Hi ,j (t)Xj (t) + Zi (t), ∀i ∈ [K ], (1)
where t is the time index, Xj (t) is the transmitted signal of
transmitter j, Yi (t) is the received signal at receiver i, Zi (t) is
the zero mean unit variance Gaussian noise at receiver i, and
Hi ,j (t) is the channel coefficient from transmitter j to receiver
i over the time slot t. We remove the time index in the rest
of this letter for brevity unless it is needed. Also, we use [K]
to denote the set {1, 2, . . . ,K}. Note that each transmitter is
connected to its corresponding receiver as well as one follow-
ing receiver, and the last transmitter is only connected to its
corresponding receiver, and all channel coefficients are drawn
from a continuous joint distribution. Finally, we assume that
global channel state information is available at all nodes.
A. Message Assignment
For each i ∈ [K ], let Wi be the message intended for
receiver i, and T i ⊆ [K ] be the transmit set of receiver i,
i.e., those transmitters with the knowledge of Wi . The trans-
mitters in Ti cooperatively transmit the message Wi to the
receiver i. Although cooperative transmission is allowed, the
average transmit set size is upper bounded by a unity backhaul
load constraint,
∑K
i=1 |Ti |
K
≤ 1. (2)
A message assignment strategy is defined by a sequence
of supersets. The k th element in the sequence consists of the
transmit sets for a k-user channel. We use message assignment
strategies to define a pattern for assigning messages to trans-
mitters in large networks. For brevity, we refer to a message
assignment strategy by a message assignment, when it is clear
from context how to apply the assignment to an arbitrarily
large network.
B. Degrees of Freedom
Let P be the average transmit power constraint at each trans-
mitter, and let Wi denote the alphabet for message Wi . Then
the rates Ri (P) =
log |Wi |
n are achievable if the decoding error
probabilities of all messages can be simultaneously made arbi-
trarily small for a large enough coding block length n, and this
holds for almost all channel realizations. The degrees of free-
dom di , i ∈ [K ], are defined as di = limP→∞
Ri (P)
logP . The
DoF region D is the closure of the set of all achievable DoF
tuples. The total number of degrees of freedom (η) is the max-
imum value of the sum of the achievable degrees of freedom,
η = maxD
∑
i∈[K ] di .
For a K-user channel, we define η(K ) as the best achievable
η over all choices of transmit sets satisfying the backhaul load
constraint in (2). In order to simplify our analysis, we define

through a centralized controller.
the asymptotic per user DoF τ to measure how η(K ) scales
with K while all other parameters are fixed,
τ = lim
K→∞
η(K )
K
. (3)
We call a message assignment strategy optimal for a
sequence of K-user channels, K ∈ {1, 2, . . .}, if there exists
a sequence of coding schemes achieving τ using the transmit
sets defined by the message assignment strategy.
III. PRIOR WORK: CENTRALIZED SOLUTION
The considered setting was studied in [5], while assuming
that messages are assigned to transmitters through a central-
ized controller that is aware of the global network topology.
It was shown that τ = 3
4 , and is achievable by splitting the
network into subnetworks; each consisting of four transmitter-
receiver pairs, and using the message assignment illustrated in
Figure 1 in each subnetwork. Only signals corresponding
to the first subnetwork in a general K-user network are
shown in the figure. The signals in the dashed boxes are
deactivated. Note that the last transmitter in each subnetwork
is deactivated to eliminate inter-subnetwork interference. Also,
exactly four message instances are assigned for each group of
four messages, which is consistent with the constraint in (2).
We also note that the third message in each subnetwork is
inactive, which indicates the necessity of an incentive for
the corresponding users for a distributed algorithm to reach
the optimal solution. For further explanation, see [1, Ch. 7].
IV. OPTIMAL GREEDY DISTRIBUTED SCHEME
We start with the simple assumption that the i th user has
a transmitter-receiver pair with index i, and is interested in
delivering message Wi . The proposed scheme is based on an
interference avoidance strategy, where for each active node, a
point-to-point AWGN code with transmit power P is used to
deliver the message, and the intended receiver does not observe
interference.
A. Monetary Mechanism
Consider the following simple example of a monetary mech-
anism: There is only one coin type, and this coin could be
given from a node (transmitter-receiver pair) to another for
one of the following reasons:
1) The payer’s transmitter will cause interference at the
payee’s receiver.
2) The payer will rent the payee’s transmitter.

EL GAMAL AND EL GAMAL: SINGLE COIN MONETARY MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTED COOPERATIVE INTERFERENCE MANAGEMENT 759
The underlying concept is based on an interference avoidance
transmission strategy, where a node has to pay in order to
be active. A paid coin goes either to the following node as in
the first case above, or to the preceding node as in the second
case above.
B. Coordination Protocol
Besides the monetary mechanism, the transmission strategy
relies on a coordination protocol, where a node (say with index
i) indicates to the following node in the network (with index
i + 1) one of the following scenarios:
• Coordination Message 1 (CM1): Node i is willing to get
paid by node i + 1 to turn off transmitter i.
• CM2: Node i is willing to get paid by node i + 1 to use
transmitter i.
• CM3: Node i is not willing to get paid by node i + 1
and node i + 1 can be active (it is possible for receiver
i + 1 to observe no interference).
• CM4: Node i is not willing to get paid by node i + 1 and
node i + 1 cannot be active, i.e., its receiver will observe
interference that cannot be eliminated, because otherwise
the overall backhaul load constraint would be violated.
We have the following remarks on the extension of the above
protocol for general network topologies.
Remark 1: In a general network topology, instead of CM2,
node i can open an auction among all nodes interested in using
its transmitter. However, this may come at an extra cost in
terms of transaction overhead and delay.
Remark 2: For CM3 and CM4, the control information
about the possibility of having receiver i + 1 decode its
desired message comes only from node i, since in the consid-
ered linear network topology, transmitter i is the only source
for interference at receiver i + 1. In a general setting, such
information will be aggregated at node i + 1 from coordina-
tion messages received from all nodes that have transmitters
interfering at receiver i + 1.
C. Greedy Algorithm
We now explain a greedy distributed algorithm that reaches
the optimal centralized solution for the message assignment
and transmission strategy. The algorithm proceeds in ascend-
ing order of the node index, and each node decides first to be
active if possible, and then maximizes its monetary credit.
Both decision criteria are considered in a greedy myopic fash-
ion. The options available for each node are based on the
coordination message it receives from the preceding node. The
new coordination message passed by a node to its following
node, is based on awareness of the backhaul constraint and
network topology. We provide Algorithm 1 below, and then
show how it reaches the solution illustrated in Figure 1 that
is proved to be the optimal centralized solution in [5].
Theorem 1: Applying Algorithm 1 in an ascending order
of index, the optimal message assignment is reached, and the
optimal per user DoF τ = 3
4 is achieved in large networks.
Proof: We first trace Algorithm 1 for the first four users in
the network, and verify that we get the solution illustrated in
Figure 1. The execution of the algorithm at the first four users
will be as follows.
Algorithm 1 Greedy Algorithm for Distributed Cooperative
Interference Management in Linear Networks
1: if Received CM4 from node i − 1 then
2: Send CM2 to node i + 1.
3: Activate a subroutine that gives node i + 1 access to
transmitter i if a coin is received.
4: else if Received CM3 from node i − 1 then
5: Transmit Wi from transmitter i.
6: Pay node i + 1.
7: if Node i − 1 paid node i then
8: Design the transmit beam for Wi−1 at transmitter
i to cancel its interference at receiver i;
9: Send CM4 to node i + 1;
10: else
11: Send CM3 to node i + 1;
12: end if
13: else if Received CM2 from node i − 1 then
14: Pay node i − 1 and transmit Wi from transmitter i − 1;
15: Send CM1 to node i + 1.
16: Activate a subroutine that enables node i + 1 to turn
off transmitter i if a coin is received.
17: else
18: Pay node i − 1 and turn off transmitter i − 1;
19: Transmit Wi from transmitter i;
20: Pay node i + 1.
21: Send CM3 to node i + 1;
22: end if
1) We assume that the first user has an initial coordination
message indicating that the preceding node is not will-
ing to get paid but the first user can be active. Following
lines 5-6 and 11 of the algorithm, W1 will be transmit-
ted from transmitter 1, node 1 will send a coordination
message to node 2 indicating that it is not willing to get
paid, but receiver 2 can be active, and finally node 1 will
pay node 2 because transmitter 1 will cause interference
at receiver 2.
2) Based on the received coordination message, the second
node will execute lines 5-6 and 8-9 of the algorithm.
Hence, both W1 and W2 will be transmitted from trans-
mitter 2 for over the air zero-forcing interference
cancellation and message delivery, respectively. Note
that we are assuming that channel state information is
known at the transmitters, and hence, the transmit beam
for message W1 could be designed at the second trans-
mitter to cancel the interference caused by this message
at the second receiver. A coordination message will then
be sent to node 3 indicating that receiver 3 has to be
inactive, and a coin will be paid to node 3. Note that
message CM4 is sent from user 2, based on knowl-
edge that the information-theoretically optimal scheme
that respects the backhaul constraint of (2) does not
assign any message to more than two transmitters (see
[1, Ch. 7], [5]).
3) Based on the received coordination message, the third
node will execute lines 2-3 of the algorithm and send a

coordination message to node 4 indicating that node 3
is willing to rent out its transmitter for a coin.
4) Node 4 would then execute lines 14-16 of the algorithm,
by paying node 3 to use transmitter 3 for delivering W4,
and sending a coordination message to node 5 indicating
that it can get paid to turn off transmitter 4.
We note that node 5 would execute lines 18-21, which form a
set of actions analogous to what node 1 executed, except for
paying the node above to turn off its transmitter. If we follow
the rest of the network, we would find that all nodes that
have the same index modulo 4 would execute a similar set
of actions. The theorem statement hence follows, as the result-
ing message assignment and transmission scheme are identical
to the optimal one found in [5], and 3 DoF is achieved for each
subnetwork of 4 users.
V. DISCUSSION
We discuss below aspects of the presented example, and use
Algorithm 1 as a reference to illustrate key concepts.
A. Transaction Overhead
In the above example, aside from the coin exchange, each
node sends a 2-bit coordination message to the following node.
This incurs an extra communication overhead that may be
unjustified if the network topology changes frequently. In other
words, the overhead of the coordination and payment protocols
and the coherence time of the network topology are factors
that determine whether a monetary mechanism leads to overall
rate gains. In general, each node would need to send a coor-
dination message to each node whose receiver is connected to
the considered node’s transmitter, and possibly exchange coins
with any neighboring node in the interference conflict graph.
B. Setup Delay
We note that in Algorithm 1, a node generates a coordi-
nation message only after receiving a coordination message
from the preceding node. Hence, the delay for completion of
the coordination protocol would be on the order of the num-
ber of users in the network. It would hence be interesting to
study an extension of that algorithm where local connectivity
enables parallel execution of the algorithm in different parts
of the network.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we presented a greedy distributed algorithm
that reaches the DoF-optimal centralized solution for linear
interference networks, under a backhaul load constraint that
allows for distributing each message to an average of one
transmitter. The proposed scheme is enabled by a monetary
mechanism that has only one coin type, and a coordina-
tion protocol that relies on 2-bit messages. The transmission
scheme is based on cooperative zero-forcing and interference
avoidance. A node pays a coin either to rent out the payee’s
transmitter, or because it is causing interference at the payee’s
receiver. It is interesting to study in future work how the
proposed scheme can be extended to apply for general network
topologies. In particular, how the number of coins, overhead
of the coordination protocol, and the delay scale with the size
of the network with an arbitrary topology. The detailed imple-
mentation of blockchain techniques to realize the monetary
policies advocated in this line of work is also an interesting
direction for future research.
