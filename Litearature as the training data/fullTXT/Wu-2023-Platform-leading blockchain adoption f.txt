Abstract
Customers are facing quality uncertainty when purchasing though ecommerce platforms,
whichmayhinder their purchase intention. The platformcan use the traceability of blockchain
technology to alleviate consumers’ doubts. We construct a game theoretical model to investi-
gate the issue of platform-leading blockchain adoption in a supply chain where heterogenous
suppliers sell products through the platform. There are different selling modes depending
on whether the platform cooperates with suppliers as a marketplace (agency contract) or
a reseller (reselling contract) or both (hybrid contracts). We find that blockchain would be
adopted to improve the efficiency of the supply chain when suppliers have enough capabili-
ties to provide high-quality product regardless of selling modes. Furthermore, the platform’s
leadership in adopting blockchain benefits the entire supply chain. It stimulates the platform
to provide subsidies for the capable suppliers to solve the incentive mismatch between sup-
pliers and himself. We also make the comparison of blockchain adoption in different selling
modes. In particular, we find that the platform is most likely to adopt blockchain when the
supplier with higher quality management capability uses the agency contract and another
supplier uses the reselling contract. If the suppliers use the same contract, the supply chain
usually accepts a higher cost under the pure agency contract, however, it may not be true
when the commission rate is very low and the upstream competition is relatively fierce.

1 Introduction
Master Kong, a well-known food brand in China, was exposed for using unsanitary raw
materials recently, which does significant harm to the credibility of the brand and has negative
effect on the whole industry. Issues related to product quality happen frequently, such asWal-
Mart had been revealed to sell fake organic eggs in California, Tesco suffered a huge loss
for “Horse meat scandal” in Europe, and Samsung had to recall smartphones with issues
of overheating and halted production. Therefore, consumers are increasingly sensitive to

product quality. Consumers’ sensitivity to quality has a great effect on market demand: they
hold utterly different attitudes towards products of high and lowquality.Once consumers have
uncertainty about the quality of the product, the supply chainmay suffer serious losses.Hence,
companies make great efforts to dispel consumers’ uncertainty about product quality (Zhang
et al., 2021). The dilemma has more significant effects on the platform whose reputation
heavily depends on upstream suppliers. For example, Wal-Mart had been accused of selling
fake organic pork but the managers claimed that the supplier had been proven certification
(Shen et al., 2018). Consumers purchasing through platforms may have more uncertainty
(Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, compared to traditional retailers, platforms make extensive
effort to create credible supply chains (Ma et al., 2021).
Frequent product quality problems not only make consumers more worried about product
quality, but also let consumers distrust companies who manufacture or sell these products
(Fan et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022). As a result, consumers’ perception of product quality
has become less dependent on information disclosed from the supply chain inside, such
as advertising, and more on the traceability evidence. ISO (International Organization for
Standardization) guidelines specify that traceability may refer to the origin of materials and
parts, the processing history, and the distribution and location of the product after delivery
(Aung&Chang, 2014). It indicates that consumers could learn about the company’s capability
of quality management through traceability.
Traceability system is an important strategy for companies to create consumer confidence
both in products and company image (Aiello et al., 2015). However, traceability systems
supported by traditional technology are hard to meet the need of consumers for transparency
and authenticity. Traditional technologies, such as bar code, QR code, and RFID technology,
serve for centralized systems and are easily used by companies for their own profits (Fan
et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022). As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain has remarkable
track-and-trace ability which allows information to be recorded accurately and tamper-proof
(Hastig & Sodhi 2020; Saberi et al., 2018). Companies in various industries have developed
blockchain technology to provide authentic information, such as Carrefour for fresh food,
Target for paper, Louis Dreyfus Co for agricultural commodities (Subramanian et al., 2020).
Blockchain provides a great approach for the platform to dispel consumers’ doubts of
products and suppliers. Moreover, the platform usually has easier access to the technology
and other resources to adopt blockchain. Many platform-leading blockchain projects have
been applied into practice: Walmart developed a food-tracking blockchain with IBM; JD
provided blockchain traceability service for imported products, Alibaba use blockchain to
combat counterfeit nutritional food. It is worth studying that the platform uses blockchain as
a response to consumers’ increasing concern about product quality. However, there are some
barriers associated with the implementation of blockchain. Incentive mismatch in blockchain
adoption among supply chain members is one of the major barriers (Babich &Hilary 2020).
The leader of blockchain project may compensate other members to encourage their partic-
ipation (Cui et al., 2022a). The supplier’s information is critical for the blockchain-enabled
traceability (Niu et al., 2021). Therefore, the platformmay provide incentive for his suppliers
to promote the blockchain adoption.
The platform acts as a marketplace or a reseller depending on how he cooperates with his
suppliers. Under the agency contract, the platform serves as a marketplace where suppliers
are allowed to sell products directly and charges the commission.Under the reselling contract,
the platform purchases products from suppliers at first and then sells to consumers. Since
the platform usually offers products from competing suppliers, there are pure or hybrid
configuration of selling contracts (Tian et al., 2018). For instance, Amazon and JD offer both
contracts (Tian et al., 2018), BestBuy and Etsy only provide marketplaces under the agency
123
Annals of Operations Research
contract (Wei & Dong, 2022), and Netease Yanxuan resells products sourcing from well-
known factories (Wu et al., 2021). In this study, we consider a general upstream competition
where heterogenous Supplier A and Supplier B sell products through the common platform.
Therefore, four selling modes could exist: (1) AA mode, both suppliers use the agency
contract; (2) RR mode, both suppliers use the reselling contract; (3) AR mode, Supplier A
uses the agency contract while Supplier B uses the reselling contract; (4) RA mode, Supplier
A uses the reselling contract while Supplier B uses the agency contract.
These observations motivate this research of blockchain adoption in different selling
modes. In this study, the platform makes decision about adopting blockchain and then sup-
pliers make their own participation choices. Considering the members may have inconsistent
decisions about using blockchain, the platform as the leader of blockchain adoption provides
subsidy to encourage the supplier’s participation. Based on the proposed model, we address
these research questions: (1) Blockchain adoption:What are the blockchain strategies of the
platform and heterogenous suppliers in different sellingmodes? (2)The platform’s leadership
in blockchain adoption: What is the platform’s subsidy strategy to encourage the suppliers’
participation andwhat is the effect? (3) Selling modes:What are the differences of blockchain
adoption in different selling modes?
According to the research questions, our main contributions are divided into three parts.
First, we discuss the conditions that the platform and his suppliers adopt the blockchain
technology in each selling mode. We illustrate that blockchain can improve the efficiency
of the supply chain when suppliers are capable to ensure the product quality. Blockchain
could mitigate the suppliers’ competition through disclosing their heterogeneity and benefit
the supply chain even further. Second, the platform’s leadership in the blockchain adoption
benefits not only himself but also the entire supply chain. The subsidy is a mechanism that the
platform shares the blockchain usage cost with the suppliers. In the presence of the platform’s
subsidy, blockchain is more likely to be adopted and consequently improves the performance
of supply chain. Third, the supply chain is most likely to adopt blockchain if the supplier with
higher quality management capability uses the agency contract and another supplier uses the
reselling contract. If suppliers use the same contract, the platform usually accept a higher
cost under the pure agency contract, however, it may not be true when the commission rate
is very low and the upstream competition is relatively fierce.
In summary, our study contributes to the blockchain adoption strategy of the supply chain
consisting of the competing suppliers and the platform. In this study, the blockchain adoption
is a joint result of the decisions of all supply chainmembers rather than one particularmember.
We consider the platform as the leader of blockchain adoption and investigate the effect of his
leadership. Moreover, we discuss and compare the blockchain adoption in different selling
modes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we review the relevant
literature. In Sect. 3, we present the proposed model. In Sects. 4 and 5, we investigate the
issue of blockchain adoption and the platform’s subsidy strategy in AA mode and RR mode
respectively. Additionally, we extend the analysis to hybrid selling modes (AR and RA) in
Sect. 6, and compare blockchain adoption in different selling mode. In Sect. 7, we conclude
the paper and discuss its important implications. All proofs can be found in Appendix B.

2 Literature review
This study examines how the traceability of blockchain works for a supply chain consisting
of heterogeneous suppliers and a platform that offers different selling modes for options. The
related literature in this paper is divided into three research streams: blockchain adoption,
supply chain traceability and platform selling modes.
2.1 Blockchain adoption
As an emerging technology, blockchain has been gradually applied to various fields (Ivanov
et al., 2018), and scholars have begun to explore the value of blockchain in operations
management, such as Babich and Hilary (2020). Many studies point out that blockchain
could reduce the risk of information asymmetry (Ivanov et al., 2018) and collaborating
companies with their suppliers to increase supply chain transparency (Sodhi & Tang 2020).
The first stream of relevant literature concerns companies sending trustworthy messages to
consumers through blockchain. The other stream explores the value of blockchain for risk
management and quality management within a multi-tier supply chain (Cui et al., 2022b;
Dong et al., 2022). Our study is most relevant to the first stream. Table 1 summarizes the
positioning of our paper in the existing literature on blockchain.
Pun et al. (2021) explored the blockchain adoption of a firm who sells authentic product,
and Shen et al. (2021) made discussion about such firm should introduce a blockchain selling
channel or sell to customers directly. Xu and He (2021) investigated the retailer’s the infor-
mation disclosure strategy through blockchain technology, Zhang et al. (2021) and Song et al.

(2022) discussed the above question under competition between heterogonous retailers. Con-
sidering game between upstream and downstream members, Choi (2019) discussed whether
a manufacturer would sell diamond through blockchain-supported platform or traditional
retailers. Xu et al. (2021) explored the blockchain adoption strategy of a manufacturer who
sells products through a retailer and an online platform. These previous papers didn’t discuss
the upstream competition. More recently, Ji et al. (2022) considered the upstream competi-
tion where two horizontal-differentiated suppliers decided to adopt blockchain in sequence.
However, our paper considers twovertical-differentiated supplierswhomakedecisions simul-
taneously and we introduce the platform as a marketplace or the downstream reseller into
the supply chain.
The above studies rarely consider blockchain adoption as a joint decision of supply chain
members. Choi et al. (2021) mentioned that the costs associated with blockchain and cost
sharing among supply chainmembers need to be studied further. Niu et al. (2021) investigated
all supply chain members’ trade-offs between acquiring demand information and disclosing
quality information about adopting blockchain. In this study, we discuss all supply chain
members’ blockchain decisions when they need to pay their own cost. Furthermore, we
consider that the platform is the leader of blockchain adoption and provides certain incentive
to encourage the supplier’s participation.
2.2 Supply chain traceability
Saak (2016) analyzed the efficiency of traceability system that could identify the responsi-
bility of suppliers for quality defects. Yao and Zhu (2020) investigated the role of traceability
in combating product label misconduct. Some studies have emerged with the development
of technology, for example, Aiello et al. (2015) investigated the implementation of RFID
traceability systems for perishable products and used stochastic approach to find the opti-
mal granularity level. Recently, the remarkable traceability of blockchain attracts a lot of
attention. Dong et al. (2022) discussed how the blockchain-enabled traceability works for a
three-tier food supply chain, and Cui et al. (2022b) considered serial and parallel supply chain
structures further. Traceability is not only critical to operation within the supply chain, but
also has a significant impact on consumers’ purchase behavior. Fan et al. (2020) considered
the traceability awareness of consumers and discussed the blockchain adoption in a three-
tier supply chain. In addition to consumer traceability awareness, Ji et al. (2022) discussed
competing manufacturers selling differentiated products with the same functions. Our study
also considers competition but focuses on the different capability of quality management
between suppliers. Compared to the above papers, we introduce the platform into the supply
chain downstream instead of a traditional retailer. It’s more common that the blockchain
technology is adopted in commerce platforms. Moreover, we consider that the platform takes
the lead to adopt blockchain for improving the traceability of supply chain, and we discuss
the issue of blockchain adoption in the different selling modes.
2.3 Platform sellingmodes
In terms of platform economy, many studies have discussed the selection of selling modes,
mostly regarding the agency and resellingmodes. Researchers have focused on the platform’s
choice of mode, such as Jiang et al. (2011), Hagiu andWright (2015), Abhishek et al. (2016)
and Shen et al. (2019). Wei and Dong (2022) investigated how the manufacturer chooses
selling modes for different products. Many studies have proved that the agency mode may
123
Annals of Operations Research
have a better performance than the reselling mode (Tan&Carrillo, 2016; Tsunoda&Zennyo,
2021). However, the above papers didn’t discuss the hybrid selling modes under the upstream
competition. Considering competition, Tian et al. (2018) studied two homogeneous suppli-
ers’ choice which constitutes one hybrid mode. We consider that the competing suppliers
are heterogenous, therefore, we have one more hybrid mode to discuss. Different from the
previous papers that mainly focus on the supply chain’s performance, we investigate and
compare the blockchain strategy of supply chain in different selling modes.
The development of the platform economy is partly driven by technological advances
or are mutually reinforcing. It is worth investigating whether these emerging technologies
will bring new vitality to the platform operation. Sun and Ji (2021) demonstrate how the
platform’s mode choice interacts with the manufacturer’s IoT investment decision, and their
results suggest that investment is not always wise. Our study is focused on the blockchain-
enabled traceability, furthermore, we investigate the blockchain strategy of the platform and
his suppliers.
From the above, researches on the blockchain adoption considering both upstream com-
petition in supply chain and the platform-operated selling modes are still limited. Few papers
have examined the blockchain adoption as a joint decision of all members, and consequently
the inconsistency of adopting blockchain among members is ignored. This study contributes
to fill the above research gap. We discuss the conditions that the platform and his suppli-
ers would like to adopt blockchain in each selling mode. The platform is the leader in the
blockchain adoption; thus, he takes the responsibility to solve inconsistency of adopting
blockchain. We investigate the platform’s subsidy strategy and the effect of his leadership.
3 Model
Consider a stylized supply chain where two competing suppliers (A and B) sell two substi-
tutable products a and b through a common platform (P). There is a probability ρi for supplier
i to sell high-quality product and a probability 1 − ρi to sell low-quality product. Note that
parameter ρi characterizes supplier i’s capability of quality management, and we define it as
supplier i’ s capability in this paper for easy exposition. Consumers hold uncertainty when
they purchase online and they have beliefs ρi on the supplier i’s capability. Suppliers are
heterogeneous and we assume Supplier A is the superior one, that is, ρa > ρb. In this study,
the suppliers’ capabilities are exogenous since they are hard to improve quality management
levels in short term.
Blockchain could be adopted for supply chain traceability. We assume that all members
involved in blockchain have fixed costs for using technology (Niu et al., 2021; Shen et al.,
2021). The platform needs to pay T as the implementation cost, and suppliers need to pay F
as the usage cost if theywant to join. In the presence of blockchain, consumers can learn about
capability of the participant supplier more accurately. This paper considers that blockchain
may not provide perfect traceability. The is because the technology is still in the early stage
of development and the traceable process may not cover the entire supply chain. In this paper,
we use δ to model the blockchain’s traceability. If a supplier sells high-quality product, there
is δ probability for consumers to figure out. Referring to Swinney (2011), we let δ ∈ ( 1
2 , 1
]
to
ensure the effectiveness of blockchain.Hence, consumers’ beliefsρi = δρi+(1 − δ)(1 − ρi ).
Note that the belief ρi becomes closer to ρi as δ increases. When blockchain enables full
traceability (i.e., δ = 1), consumers are aware of supplier i’s capability perfectly, that is,
ρi = ρi . In the absence of blockchain, consumers cannot capture suppliers’ capabilities and
123

distinguish their heterogeneity. Without loss of generality, we assume that ρi = 1
2 when the
blockchain-enable traceability isn’t available.
Following the established norm in previous literature, the base demand function is given
by Di = D0− pi +γ
(
p j − pi
)
, where pi refers to the retail price for product i = {a, b}, and
γ is the measure of the intensity of upstream competition. D0 denotes the market potential:
D0 = θ for high-quality product and D0 = βθ for low-quality product, where β ∈ [0, 1)
reflects consumers sensitivity to product quality.A smallβ implies that consumers attachgreat
importance to product quality. For example, β = 0 means that consumers won’t purchase
when they realize the product is low-quality. Consequently, the supplier i’s expected demand
is Di = [
ρiθ + (
1 − ρi
)
βθ
] − pi + γ
(
p j − pi
)
.
We discuss four possible selling modes: (1) AA mode, both supplier uses the agency
contract; (2)RRmode, both supplier uses the reselling contract; (3)ARmode, Supplier A uses
the agency contract while Supplier B uses the reselling contract; (4)RAmode, Supplier A uses
the reselling contract while Supplier B uses the agency contract. The platform and suppliers
usually make decisions about blockchain adoption when the selling mode has already been
established. Therefore, we focus on the comparison of blockchain adoption rather than the
joint strategy of choosing selling mode and adopting blockchain. We model the blockchain
adoption as a sequential game: the platform makes decision of adopting blockchain at first
and then the suppliers decide to join or not. According to the blockchain adoption, the supply
chain members make their short-term pricing decisions. The game sequence is shown in
Fig. 1.
4 AAmode
In AA mode, both suppliers set retail prices and sell products directly to consumers in the
marketplace operated by the platform; thus, the platform charges a certain proportion of
suppliers’ profit as the commission.
4.1 Blockchain adoption in AAmode
The sequence of events and decisions have been given in Fig. 1. With backward induction,
we study the suppliers’ participation choices at first, and then study the platform’s blockchain
adoption strategy. In the absence of blockchain, consumers have the same original beliefs
about suppliers’ capability of quality management, i.e., ρi = 1
2 . Therefore, D

, where Kn = 1+β
2 . In this case, the expected profits for suppliers and the
platform are as follows:
πNN
i = (1 − λ)pi DN
i , πNN
P = ∑
λpi DN
i , i ∈ {a, b}.
If the platformadopts blockchain, consumers could update their belief about the participant
supplier i , i.e., ρi = δρi + (1 − δ)(1 − ρi ). In this time, DY
i = Kiθ − pi + γ
(
p j − pi
)
,
where Ki is given in Appendix B. Note that the supplier’s capability, consumers quality
sensitivity and blockchain’s traceability jointly determine the market potential. The platform
and the participant supplier i pay costs and their profit expectations are as follows:
πe
i = (1 − λ)pi D
Y
i − F, πe
P = λ
(
πe
i + πe
−i
) − T , i ∈ {a, b}.
where e denotes different scenarios, representing YN (NY) if only Supplier A (Supplier
B) joins blockchain and YY if they both join. The platform makes a one-time investment
in blockchain regardless of how many suppliers are involved. If supplier i doesn’t join
blockchain, he still has πNN
i profit. The equilibrium results are shown in Table 2 which
is given in Appendix A.
We illustrate each supplier’s participation decision in Lemma 1. To avoid intricacy, we
describe the supplier as a capable supplier if he is more likely to sell high-quality product
(i.e., ρi > 1
2 ), otherwise, we describe him as a normal supplier.
Lemma 1 A capable supplier agrees to join blockchain with a threshold of usage cost.
(i) If ρa > 1
2 , Supplier A joins blockchain when F ≤ F2.
(ii) If ρb > 1
2 , Supplier B joins blockchain when F ≤ min(F1, F2).
Lemma 1 demonstrates that when ρb < ρa ≤ 1
2 , both suppliers refuse to join blockchain.
This is intuitive because they do not want consumers to trace their supply process since they
have poor quality management capabilities. Even for capable suppliers, their participation
choices are related to the specific probability of selling high-quality product. Note that the
usage cost threshold of Supplier A (i.e., F2) is always more than or equal to that of Supplier B
(i.e.,min(F1, F2)). This implies that the superior supplier is more inclined to join blockchain
than the inferior one. Therefore, the situation where only Supplier B joins blockchain will
not arise. Note that suppliers have symmetrical strategies when F1 > F2, which yields
f (Kn, Ka, Kb) < 0 (Seedetails inAppendixB).The situationonly existswhen the difference
between ρb and ρa is very small. In the rest of paper, we assume f (Kn, Ka, Kb) ≥ 0 to
focus on the nontrivial parameter ranges where suppliers have significant heterogeneity. We
summarize the equilibrium results from Lemma 1 to obtain Proposition 1:
Proposition 1
(i) When ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa, YN equilibrium holds if F ≤ F2.
(ii) When 1
2 < ρb < ρa, YY equilibrium holds if F ≤ F1.; YN equilibrium holds if
F1 < F ≤ F2.
Both capable suppliers join blockchain if the usage cost is low (i.e., F ≤ F1.), which con-
stitutes YY equilibrium.When the usage cost is relatively high (i.e., F1 < F ≤ F2), Supplier
B can’t get enough profit from blockchain to pay for the cost. Consequently, only Supplier A
joins, which constitutes YN equilibrium. The proposition reveals that NY equilibrium will
never exist, and the reason has been explained by Lemma 1.
Given the suppliers’ participation choices, we analyze the platform’s blockchain adoption
decision according to his own profitability illustrated in Tab 2. Neither of suppliers join
123
Annals of Operations Research
blockchainwhenρi < 1
2 , the platformwill never adopt blockchain consequently.Our analysis
yields Proposition 2:
Proposition 2
(i) If T ≤ T1, the platform adopts blockchain when ρa > 1
2 and F ≤ F2.
(ii) If T1 < T ≤ T2, the platform adopts blockchain when ρb > 1
2 and F ≤ F1.
Proposition 2 demonstrates the condition that the platform adopts blockchain. The plat-
form ismotivated to adopt blockchainwith acceptable implementation cost onlywhen at least
a capable supplier agrees to join. More specifically, the platform benefits from blockchain
containing Supplier A if T ≤ T1. If the implementation cost increases, that is, T1 < T ≤ T2,
the platform obtains more profit when blockchain contains both capable suppliers. Propo-
sitions 1 and 2 reveal that the supplier’s capability is the most critical factor in blockchain
adoption. If both suppliers have small probability of selling high-quality product, the supply
chain will never use blockchain. Only when suppliers have enough capability to provide
high-quality product, the supply chain will decide to adopt blockchain according to the costs.

Corollary 1 reveals that blockchain allows suppliers to improve retail prices. The par-
ticipant supplier raises price because he could attract more consumers through blockchain.
Counterintuitively, SupplierB also raises price evenwhen he has poor capability (i.e.,ρb ≤ 1
2 )
and doesn’t join blockchain. The rationale relies on that both the expanded market and the
increase in Supplier A’s retail price mitigate the upstream competition. In the presence of
blockchain, Supplier A can set a higher price than Supplier B because their heterogeneity is
disclosed to the public.
The conditions of adopting blockchain reflectmembers’ willingness to pay for blockchain.
In AA mode, members share the profit of supply chain, therefore, they have similar attitude
about blockchain adoption. Theirwillingness to pay for blockchain are related to the upstream
competition, consumers quality sensitivity, and blockchain traceability. We present the find-
ings in Proposition 3.

Proposition 3 shows that fierce competition reduces the platform and the participant sup-
plier’s willingness to pay for blockchain. The competition between suppliers hurts the whole
supply chain profit when suppliers use the agency contract; thus, all members including the
platform cannot afford high costs. In addition, the supply chain members have less willing-
ness to use blockchain when consumers are less sensitive to product quality (higher β). The
results are intuitive because the supply chain doesn’t have strong motivation to disclose qual-
ity information when the market gap is small. Moreover, the members could accept higher
costs when blockchain has stronger traceability.
In fact, the results of sensitivity analysis help to explain the members’ attitude to the
blockchain adoption.

Heterogenous suppliers are affected by their competition in different way. Corollary 2
confirms that upstream competition hurts Supplier A in any cases and the blockchain adoption
amplifies the negative impact. However, Supplier Bmay benefit fromfierce competitionwhen
the heterogeneity between he and Supplier A is larger. Because the stronger the heterogeneity
between suppliers, the more significant the effect of blockchain on mitigating competitive
pressure.Moreover, the platform always suffers from upstream competition in AAmode. The
effect of competition on the platform is jointly determined by its effect on both suppliers;
however, the effect from Supplier A is stronger.

On the one hand, the more consumers attach importance to product quality, the worse the
performance of the supply chain. Because the supply chain suffers loss for selling low-quality
product, and the outcome is worse if consumers are more sensitive to product quality. On the
other hand, this negative effect is reduced by the blockchain adoption. The supply chain uses
blockchain to increases consumers’ confidence in purchasing high-quality products. That
is, blockchain prevents capable suppliers from losing demand. This also explains why the
members accept higher blockchain costs when the demand loss for low-quality product is
more serious.

Corollary 4 demonstrates that all members in the supply chain obtain more profit from
blockchain when it has stronger traceability. The effect becomes more significantly when
more capable suppliers are involved. In this case, blockchain traceability play a role of
improving consumers’ good perception of products. This explains why the participant mem-
bers accept higher costs when blockchain has stronger traceability.

4.2 Subsidy strategy in AAmode
The above discussion reveals that the platform is motivated to adopt blockchain when there
is a capable supplier in supply chain. However, the capable supplier’s motivation to join
blockchain may be dampened by expensive usage costs. In practice, some platforms (JD.com
and Tmall) support blockchain technology themselves for strategic competitiveness. The
platform is the leader of the blockchain adoption and is responsible for solving the incen-
tive mismatch between the supplier and himself. Therefore, the platform offers subsidy for
suppliers to encourage their participation. Since the implement cost of platform is negligible
in the long run, we assume T = 0 to focus on the impact of subsidy strategy in the later
discussion. Recall that the platform hopes to disclose information of capable supplier instead
of normal supplier, that is, he only provides subsidy when ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa and 1
2 < ρb < ρa .
When ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa , the platform wants to disclose Supplier A’s capability to attract more
consumers. If Supplier A is hold back for high usage costs, the platform may encourage
Supplier A to join blockchain, transforming NN to YN equilibrium. If the platform receives
extra profit after he compensates for Supplier A’s loss from joining blockchain, he will
conduct the subsidy strategy.
When 1
2 < ρb < ρa , there are two possible situations in the first place: YN and NN. Since
both suppliers are capable, thus, the participation of each supplier generates more profits for
the platform. When the original equilibrium is YN, the platform may subsidize Supplier B,
transforming YN to YY equilibrium. When the original equilibrium is NN, transforming to
NY, YN, and YY equilibria are all potentially profitable for the platform.However, it’s can be
proven that the platform always obtains more profit from transformingNN toYN equilibrium
than NY equilibrium. Therefore, we focus on the platform’s subsidy strategy of transforming
to YN and YY.We obtain the feasible conditions of each possible transformation and make
comparisons to choose the optimal strategy of the platform. Based on the above discussion,
we derive the optimal subsidy strategy to deal with different usage cost values and show in
the following proposition.
Proposition 4 The platform’s optimal subsidy strategy is as follows:
(i) Transforming equilibrium from YN to YY: F1 < F ≤ min( f1, F2).
(ii) Transforming equilibrium from NN to YN: when 1
2 < ρb < ρa, max(F2, f3) < F ≤
f2; when ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa, F2 < F ≤ f2.
(iii) Transforming equilibrium from NN to YY: F2 < F ≤ min( f3, f4).
Proposition 4 shows the relationship between suppliers’ usage costs and the platform’s
subsidy strategy. To deepen our understanding, the numerical analysis is shown in Fig. 2. It
shows the effect of platform subsidy strategy on blockchain adoption under different λ levels.
We use the following settings: γ = 0.5, β = 0.9, δ = 0.8, θ = 2, ρb = 0.7 and ρa = 0.8.
The region of adopting blockchain expands significantly after the platform’s subsidy. The
observation confirms that the subsidy is an effective way for the platform to improve the
blockchain adoption. The platform voluntarily contributes part of his profit to share costs
with capable suppliers and further improves the performance of the whole supply chain. In
addition, the commission rate has different effect on the blockchain adoption before and after
the platform’s subsidy. Figure 2a illustrates that the acceptable usage cost of suppliers (i.e.,
F1, F2) decreases in λ. The area of blockchain adoption consisting of YN and YY gradually
shrinks because the platform squeezes suppliers’ profits hardly with a high commission rate.
However, Fig. 2 (b) shows the area of blockchain adoption expands with an increase in λ
after the platform’s subsidy. When the platform charges a higher commission rate, he can

We use 
i , i ∈ {a, b, P} to denote member i’s profit after subsidy. After the equilibrium
has shifted from NN to YN, 
a = πY N
a + SY N = πNN
a , but 
b = πY N
b > πNN
b , where
SY N denotes the subsidy. Supplier B is better off for doing nothing, but Supplier A keeps
the same profit after changing the participation decision. Additionally, the similar effect
arises that Supplier A becomes the beneficial one when the equilibrium has shifted from
YN to YY. The above results reveal an interesting situation on “free-riding.” In the first
case, Supplier A joining blockchain increases the retail prices and Supplier B gets potential
profits from the less fierce competition (as shown in Corollary 1). When Supplier B also has
great capability to control quality, his participation creates the “free-riding” opportunity for
Supplier A. The mechanism of “free-riding” actually reflects that blockchain has potential to
mitigate upstream competition through disclosing the supplier heterogeneity. As a result, the
platform’s subsidy improves the performance of the supply chain and benefits more members
by promoting thw use of blockchain.
5 RRmode
5.1 Blockchain adoption in RRmode
In this section, we make discussion in RR mode where both suppliers cooperate with the
platform on the reselling contract. Since the analysis of two pure selling modes are very
similar, we simplify the structure of this section. InRRmode, the platform purchases products
from both suppliers for wholesale prices and then determines the retail prices for consumers.
The profits of suppliers and the platform without blockchain in RR mode are as follows:

i = w̃i D

In the presence of blockchain, the platform and the participant supplier would pay costs
respectively. Their profit expectations are as follows:

Y

P =
∑

where e still denotes YN (NY) if only Supplier A (Supplier B) joins blockchain and YY if
they both join blockchain. If supplier i doesn’t join blockchain, he still has π̃NN
i profit. We
summarize all equilibrium results in Table 3 which is given in Appendix A.
Notice that the profits of suppliers in RR mode are 1
2(1−λ)
of that in AA mode. Hence, the
equilibrium results of Proposition 1 hold with updated thresholds F̃i = Fi
2(1−λ)
. Although the
platform’s profit performance seems to change significantly, the result in each equilibrium
actually changes to the samedegree. Therefore, the blockchain adoption results of Proposition
2 also hold with updated thresholds T̃i . In fact, this implies the critical factor of blockchain
adoption is the supplier’s capability of quality management regardless of the selling mode.
The analysis about suppliers’ performance is consistent with the AA mode. Therefore,
this section focuses on investigating the platform’s willingness to pay for blockchain. The
platform’s willingness to pay increases in consumers’ sensitivity to quality and blockchain
traceability, which is similar to that in the agencymode. However, it increases in the upstream
competition in RR mode.
Proposition 5 In RR mode, the platform’s willingness to pay is affected by upstream compe-
tition in the opposite way to that in the AA mode, that is, dT̃2

2 < ρa and
dT̃i

Proposition5 reveals that upstreamcompetitiongenerates opposite impacts on theplatform
under the two pure selling modes. The different profit performances can explain the results:

RRmode. Because the upstream competition forces suppliers to lower their wholesale prices.
On the other hand, adopting blockchain makes this effect even stronger because the platform
attract more consumers.
5.2 Subsidy strategy in RRmode
The platform follows the same subsidy strategy in RR mode as in AA mode. The results
of Proposition 4 substituting thresholds fi to f̃i are still true. There are some consistent
findings in pure selling modes. As the leader in blockchain adoption, the platform is willing
to contribute part of his profit to share blockchain costs with capable suppliers. The platform’s
leadership in blockchain adoption benefits not only himself but also the entire supply chain.
Additionally, we find that the platform always prefers to subsidize Supplier A than Supplier
B in pure selling modes which may not be true in hybrid selling modes.
The difference of operational performance in pure selling modes results in the difference
of blockchain adoption. As shown in Table 3, the wholesale prices in RR mode are equal to
retail prices in AA mode, showing that the reselling contract results in a significant increase
in retail prices. Consequently, the overall profit of the supply chain is always worse off in
RRmode. This can be well explained because the agency contract would mitigate the impact
of double-marginalization (Tan & Carrillo, 2016; Tsunoda & Zennyo, 2021) and improves
123
Annals of Operations Research
the supply chain members’ performance. However, it doesn’t mean that the platform always
accepts a higher blockchain cost in AA mode. When the commission rate is very low and
the upstream competition is relatively fierce, the platform is more likely to adopt blockchain
in RR mode. In this case, the platform has limited profitability in AA mode, but the fierce
upstream competition allows the platform to squeeze more profits from suppliers in RR
mode. Therefore, the platform may offer more subsidy to improve the blockchain adoption.
Comparison of blockchain adoption in all selling modes will be present in next section.
6 Extension: hybrid sellingmodes
6.1 Blockchain adoption in hybrid sellingmodes
In this section, we study the issue of blockchain adoption in hybrid selling modes. In AR
mode, Supplier A cooperatives with the platform on the agency contract while Supplier B
cooperativeswith the platform on the reselling contract. In RAmode, Supplier A cooperatives
with the platform on the reselling contract, but Supplier B cooperatives with the platform
on the agency contract. The equilibrium results of AR mode and RA mode are shown in
Tables 4 and 5 respectively (see in Appendix A). According to results of the expected profits,
the equilibrium results could be summarized in Proposition 6.
Proposition 6 In the AR mode:
(i) When ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa, YN equilibrium holds if F ≤ F1.
(ii) When 1
2 < ρb < ρa, YY equilibrium holds if F ≤ min
(
F2, F4
)
, YN equilibrium holds
if F4 < F ≤ F1, NY equilibrium holds if F2 < F ≤ F3.
The results of RA mode with updated thresholds F̂i . The above results verify that only
a capable supplier (ρi ≥ 1
2 ) has incentive to join blockchain no matter what contract is
used. The major difference between the hybrid selling modes and the pure selling modes
is whether NY equilibrium exist. In the pure selling modes, NY equilibrium never exists
because Supplier A is always more inclined to join blockchain than Supplier B. However,
the asymmetry of selling mode could inverse the situation in the hybrid selling modes. To be
specific, the commission rate has very important effect on equilibrium results of the hybrid
selling modes.
In AR mode, YN equilibrium exists when λ is small enough to make F1 < F4, and NY
equilibrium only exists when λ is large enough to make F2 < F3. When the commission
rate is relatively high, Supplier A’s profit is squeezed by the platform when they cooperate
through the agency contract. Therefore, Supplier A cannot afford the usage cost of blockchain
even though he could obtain more demand through disclosing his superior capability. While
Supplier B could protect his profit by adjusting wholesale price when he uses the reselling
contract. In this case, Supplier B can accept a higher usage cost than Supplier A, which
constitutes NY equilibrium.
However, there are opposite observations under the RA mode: YN equilibrium exists
when λ is large enough to make F̂1 < F̂4, and NY equilibrium exists when λ is small enough
to make F̂2 < F̂3. When the commission rate is relatively low, Supplier B is motivated to
expand market for more profit. Therefore, Supplier B is willing to pay higher usage cost
than Supplier A, which also constitutes NY equilibrium. Figures 3a and 4a shows the above
equilibrium results under different λ levels in AR and RA mode respectively. The numerical
analysis still uses the same settings in Sect. 4.

6.2 Subsidy strategy in hybrid sellingmodes
In this section, we discuss the platform’s subsidy strategy in AR and RA mode. The com-
parison is too complex to show the optimal subsidy. Proposition 7 presents the necessary
conditions of the platform making possible subsidy strategies:
Proposition 7 The necessary conditions of the platform’s subsidy in AR mode:
(i) Transforming equilibrium from NN to YN: if F ≤ f 1;
(ii) Transforming equilibrium from NN to NY: if F ≤ f 2;
(iii) Transforming equilibrium from NN to YY: if F ≤ f 3;

(iv) Transforming equilibrium from YN to YY: if F ≤ f 4;
(v) Transforming equilibrium from NY to YY: if F ≤ f 5.
The platform’s subsidy strategy in RA mode follows Proposition 7, and all results hold
with updated thresholds f̂i . We conduct the numerical analysis to show the optimal subsidy
strategies of the platform. Figures 3b and 4b shows the final blockchain adoption equilibrium
under different λ levels in AR and RA mode respectively.
The asymmetric structure of selling mode has moderating effect on the platform’s subsidy
behavior. In AR mode, the platform always prefers to subsidize Supplier A to transform
NN to YN equilibrium. This finding is consistent with the pure selling modes. In contrast,
transforming NN to NY equilibrium is potentially to be the optimal strategy of the platform
in RA mode. As shown in Fig. 5, NY equilibrium could exist after the platform’s subsidy
in RA mode. Notice that the situation only arises when the difference between suppliers’
capabilities is relatively small. This implies the heterogeneity between suppliers’ capability
has a greater impact on the platform’s subsidy behaviour than the selling contract.
The analysis in hybrid sellingmodes confirm that the subsidy is an effectiveway to improve
blockchain adoption since the region of adopting blockchain expands significantly. A higher
commission rate allows the platform to provide more subsidy, consequently, is improves the
blockchain adoption. Additionally, the observation shows that the platform always prefers
to subsidizes Supplier A in the AA, RR and AR mode. However, the platform may prefer to
subsidize the Supplier B in the RA mode when the advantage of agency contract overcomes
Supplier B’s shortcoming of inferior capability.
6.3 Comparison of blockchain adoption
In this section, we explore the influence of selling modes on blockchain adoption regarding
to the equilibrium consisting of YN, NY and YY in the presence of the platform’s subsidy.
The boundary conditions are compared to figure out the blockchain adoption in different
selling modes.

As shown in Fig. 6, the platform is most likely to adopt blockchain in AR mode. We
derive that the platform can accept the highest blockchain cost in AR mode. The result can
be explained from two aspects: On the one hand, Supplier A has the superior capability of
qualitymanagement.When suppliers use the same contract, Supplier A’s participation always
bring more profits to the supply chain and the platform than Supplier B. On the other hand,
the agency contract has advantageous over the reselling contract, as we have been explained
in Sect. 5.2. Therefore, it’s the most profitable for the platform to only subsidize the superior
supplier who uses the agency contract.
7 Conclusion
Blockchain creates a reliable traceability system for supply chain to disclose its capability of
quality management. This study is motivated by the industrial practice. IBM has reported that
blockchain brought an explosion of transactions for earning trust from customers,1 and nearly
40% blockchain projects had positive returns.2 JD, the China e-commerce giant, develops its
own blockchain project “ZhiZhenLian” and provides service for its suppliers. For example,
JD cooperates the suppliers of holothurian to trace each stage of holothurian cultivation from
breeding to processing based on the blockchain technology and IoT devices.3 Consumers can
learn about the growth information of every holothurian through a specific digital certificate.
In this way, consumers have more trust in products and have greater user stickiness with the
brands.4 The findings in our study are consistent with the above real-world observations.

Moreover, our study further considers the subsidy mechanism and different selling modes,
which provides some managerial insights into the platform’s leading blockchain adoption.
First, it is important for the platform to collaborate with a supplier who has great capability
of qualitymanagement. Onlywhen the supplier has enough capability to provide high-quality
product, the supply chain members will decide to adopt blockchain according to the costs.
Blockchain improves the efficiency of supply chain by mitigating consumers uncertainty
of product quality. In this paper, we explore that blockchain disclosing the heterogeneity
between suppliers reduces their competition pressure and further benefits the supply chain.
This implies that members adopting blockchain should pay attention to the supply chain
structure, consisting of upstream competition and suppliers’ heterogeneity.
Second, the platform’s subsidy strategy could create more collaboration of blockchain
adoption. As the leader of blockchain adoption, the platform is motivated to reduce the cost
pressure on suppliers, which promotes the blockchain adoption consequently. In fact, the
blockchain leader has greater benefits than participants in the early stage of blockchain4; thus,
it is reasonable that the leader iswilling to provide incentive to adopt blockchain.Blockchain’s
role in alleviating competition creates “free-riding” opportunity for both suppliers. Therefore,
the platform’s leadership in adopting blockchain not only benefits himself, but also improves
the performance of the entire supply chain.
Third, the platform is the most likely to adopt blockchain in AR mode. The advantage of
agency contract and superior capability of Supplier A makes blockchain works the best in
ARmode. In the pure selling modes, the platform may accept a higher blockchain cost in RR
mode than AA mode when the commission rate is very low and the upstream competition is
relatively fierce even though the performance of supply chain is proven to be better in AA
mode. Regarding to the blockchain participant, the superior supplier has more willingness
to join blockchain than the inferior supplier in the pure selling modes, but this situation may
be inversed by the asymmetry of hybrid selling modes. To promote the blockchain adoption,
the platform always prefers to subsidize the superior supplier in AA, RR and AR mode.
However, the platform may prefer to subsidize the inferior supplier in RA mode when the
difference between suppliers’ capability is relatively small.
Our study examines platform-leading blockchain adoption issue and the value of
blockchain traceability under upstream competition. There still are some limitations, which
provides directions for future research. First, it would be interesting to study how the platform
motivates suppliers to improve their capabilities of quality management through adopting
blockchain. As a result, there will be more coordination issues among the supply chain mem-
bers about costs and benefits associated with adopting blockchain. Second, blockchain can
solve the issue of information asymmetry between the downstream and upstream members
and creates transparency inside the supply chain. For example, the downstream members
could learn about the upstream members’ practice through blockchain, such as the sourcing
behavior (Cui et al., 2022a). Although this paper focuses on the blockchain’s role in sending
trustworthy messages to consumers, we also study the issue of information asymmetry in
Appendix C. We find that since the platform and suppliers could reach a consensus about
the blockchain adoption when it is adopted to eliminate the consumers uncertainty, the infor-
mation asymmetry doesn’t make a significant effect in this case. Third, blockchain adoption
could be considered as a signal about product qualitywhen consumers are strategic. The game
among consumers, suppliers and the platform will lead to more discussion about adopting
blockchain.

Next, we compare the above thresholds and omit the same part (i.e., 4(1−λ)(1+γ )2θ2
[(2+γ )(2+3γ )]2
), it’s
easy to find that (1 + γ )(Ka + Kn)+γ Kb > γ Ka + (1 + γ )(Kn + Kb) and (1 + 2γ )Kn +
(1 + γ )Ka > (1 + 2γ )Kn + (1 + γ )Kb. And we realize that the discussion is about
(Kb − Kn)
[
(1 + γ )(Kb + Kn) + γ Ka
]
and (Ka − Kn)
[
(1 + 2γ )Kn + (1 + γ )Ka
]
. Thus,
we let
F1 = 4(1 − λ)(1 + γ )2θ2(Kb − Kn)
[
(1 + γ )(Kb + Kn) + γ Ka
]
[
(2 + γ )(2 + 3γ )
]2 ,
F2 = 4(1 − λ)(1 + γ )2θ2(Ka − Kn)
[
(1 + 2γ )Kn + (1 + γ )Ka
]
[
(2 + γ )(2 + 3γ )
]2
.
When ρb < ρa ≤ 1
2 , Kb < Ka < Kn . That is, all thresholds of adopting blockchain (i.e.,
F1, F2) are negative, and both suppliers refuse to join.
When ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa , Kb ≤ Kn < Ka , and we derive F1 ≤ 0 < F2. This means Supplier
B won’t join blockchain. Supplier A joins if F < F2, which constitutes YN equilibrium;
otherwise, NN equilibrium.
When 1
2 < ρb < ρa , Kn < Kb < Ka . We need more discussion regarding the
threshold of Supplier B’s decision at first. Let f (Kn, Ka, Kb) = (1 + γ )

. In the case of f (Kn, Ka, Kb) < 0,which yieldsmin(F1, F2) =
F2. That is, both suppliers join blockchain when F ≤ F2, which constitutes YY equi-
librium. In the case of f (Kn, Ka, Kb) ≥ 0, which yields min(F1, F2) = F1. That is,
both suppliers join when F ≤ F1 constituting YY equilibrium, and only Supplier A joins
when F1 < F ≤ F2 constituting YN equilibrium. Note that f (Kn, Ka, Kb) increases in
ρa and decreases in ρb. And we find that the difference between suppliers is negligent if

f (Kn, Ka, Kb) < 0 by numerical analysis. Therefore, we assume f (Kn, Ka, Kb) ≥ 0 in
the later discussion. �

. This implies that the platform
gets extra profits when both suppliers are involved into blockchain. Given Proposition 1, the
platform could make his decision, therefore, we get Proposition 2.
Proof of Corollary 1 Comparing Supplier A’s optimal prices, we derive: i) when ρb < 1

And comparing suppliers’ optimal prices, we get: pY N

pY N
a > pY N
b as long as ρb < 1
2 ; and pY N
a > pY N

Based on the above results, we could get Corollary 1. �

Proof of Corollary 3 Taking the first derivatives of optimal profits of the platform and the
participant supplier with respect to β, we get the results of Corollary 3. �

participant supplier with respect to δ, we get the results of Corollary 4. �
Proof of Proposition 4 When ρb ≤ 1
2 < ρa , we find if F ≤ f2
the platform manages to encourage Supplier A’s participation, where f2 =
(1+γ )(Ka−Kn)θ

[(2+γ )(2+3γ )]2
, and YN equilibrium occurs.
We use 
i , i ∈ {a, b, P} to denote the member i’s profit after subsidy. After equilibrium has
shifted from NN to YN, we could yield 
a = πNN
a , but 
b = πY N
b . We notice that Supplier
B gets more money for doing nothing, i.e., πY N
b > πNN
b . The result reveals “free-riding”
advantage of Supplier B.
When 1
2 < ρb < ρa , πYY
P > πY N
P > πNY
P > πNN
P if T = 0, which implies that the
platform gets more profits as long as there is a capable supplier using blockchain.
If F1 < F ≤ F2, the original equilibrium is YN. The platform only needs to encourage
supplier B to join, the platform may offer subsidy SYYb = πY N
B −πYY
B to Supplier B for more
profit�YY = πYY
P −πY N
P − SYYb . And we find if F ≤ f1 the platform gets more profits from
subsidizing Supplier B, where f1 = (1+γ )(Kb−Kn)θ

[(
4(1+γ )2+λγ 2
)
(Kn+Kb)+4(1+λ)γ (1+γ )Ka
]
[(2+γ )(2+3γ )]2
.
If F > F2, the original equilibrium is NN. When the platform wants to realize YY
equilibrium, compensating the profit gap between πNN
b and πYY
b to Supplier B is not enough.
The platform has to provide more subsidies (the profit gap between πY N
b and πYY
b ) because
Supplier B could take advantage of “free-riding”.
The platform may transform NN to NY equilibrium through offering Supplier B subsidy
SNY = πNN
b − πNY
b for extra profit �NY = πNY
P − πNN
P − SNY .
The platform may transform NN to YN equilibrium through offering Supplier A subsidy
SY N = πNN

The platform may transform NN to YY equilibrium through offering Supplier A subsidy
SYYa = πNN
a − πYY
a and offering Supplier B subsidy SYYb = πY N
b − πYY
b for extra profit
�
YY = πYY
P − πNN
P − SYYa − SYYb .
We are easy to find that �Y N > �NY , as a result, we only need to compare the thresholds
and extra profits of two latter transformation, and we summarize all possible cases in Table
6.

Appendix C: Information asymmetry between the platform and suppliers
In themain body, we assume that the platform is aware of the suppliers’ capabilities of quality
management. Therefore, the platformmakes decision about adopting blockchain with perfect
knowledge. In this Appendix, we consider that the platform has limited knowledge about his
suppliers’ capabilities. Since the discussion is similar among four selling modes, we take the
AA mode as an example at first.
In the previous discussion, we define two supplier types: a capable supplier (i.e., ρi ≥ 1
2 ),
and a normal supplier (i.e., ρi < 1
2 ). Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 shows that the type of
supplier plays a very important role in the blockchain strategy of the platform and suppliers.
Therefore, we consider the information asymmetry that the platform only holds a prior belief
about suppliers’ types before he makes decision about adopting blockchain. The platform
believes that Supplier A (Supplier B) is a capable supplier with probability ηa (ηb). Since
we focus on the type of supplier rather than the specific value of the supplier’s capability, we
assume that the capability of a capable (normal) supplier i is ρH
i (ρL
i ), i = {a, b}. We still
follow the setting of supplier heterogeneity; thus, we define that ρL
b < ρL
a < 1
2 ≤ ρH
b < ρH
a .
Notice that Supplier A has superior capability of quality management, Supplier A must be
a capable supplier when Supplier B is capable, i.e., P
(
ρa = ρH
a |ρb = ρH
b
) = 1. Moreover,
we assume that P
(
ρb = ρH
b |ρa = ρH
a
) = η, that is, ηb = η · ηa .
Recall the game sequence in Fig. 1, the pricing decisions of suppliers are made given
the blockchain adoption equilibrium. Therefore, the pricing results in different equilibrium
123
Annals of Operations Research
are the same. For the suppliers’ participation choices, we find that suppliers would choose
to join blockchain or not regarding to their type and the fixed usage cost. Lemma 1 and
Proposition 1 still holds. We find that information asymmetry doesn’t affect the suppliers’
decisions including pricing and blockchain participation.
However, information asymmetry affects the platform’s decision about adopting
blockchain. The platform would make decision based on his prior belief of suppliers’ types,
the usage cost (i.e., F) and his own implement cost (i.e., T ). Since the platform has the lim-
ited information, he only has an expectation for the blockchain participants. Moreover, the
platform will waste his implement cost when neither supplier is willing to join blockchain.
When F ≤ F1, suppliers may reach NN, YN, and YY equilibrium. If the platform decides
to adopt blockchain, his expectedprofit is:1 = (1 − ηa)π
NN
P +ηa(1 − η)πY N
P +ηbπ

In addition to the cost T , the first item represents that neither supplier is capable and they both
refuse to join blockchain. The second item represents that only Supplier A joins blockchain.
The third item represents that both suppliers join blockchain. The optimization problem
of the platform is: max
{

P ,1
}
. When F1 < F ≤ F2, suppliers may reach NN, and
YN equilibrium. If the platform decides to adopt blockchain, his expected profit is: 2 =

P − T . The optimization problem of the platform is: max

Proposition 8 In AA mode, when the platform is uncertain about the suppliers’ types:
(i) If F ≤ F1, the platform adopts blockchain when T ≤ T1.
(ii) If F1 < F ≤ F2, the platform adopts blockchain when T ≤ T2.

Notice that the participation choices of suppliers ensure that only ρH
i , i = {A, B} could be
revealed to consumers through blockchain, therefore, Ki = 1 + (1 − β)
[
(2δ − 1)ρH

]
in this Appendix. In comparison to Proposition 2, the platform makes decision according
to the blockchain costs including the suppliers’ usage cost and his own implement cost.
The conditions of usage cost, i.e., F1, F2, can help the platform to update his belief of the
suppliers’ types. Moreover, the platform makes trade-off between his expected profit and
the implement cost. In comparison to T1, T2 in Proposition 2, T1 and T2 are related to the
probabilities of suppliers’ types. In practice, the platform could achieve his prior belief from
the past transaction experience.
Recall the findings in main body that the platform will decide to adopt blockchain accord-
ing to the costs only when he confirms that at least one of suppliers is capable. With limited
information, the platform faces the risk of building a blockchain with no supplier involved.
However, although the platform’s adoption strategy is affected by his limited information, the
role of blockchain in mitigating consumers doubts is still the same. Because the suppliers’
participation choices guarantee that blockchain will not be used to disclose the information
that disappoints consumers. This means that the first conclusion in the main study still holds.
On the other hand, it also demonstrates the advantage of the joint decision of supply chain
members. Otherwise, if the platform fully controls the blockchain adoption and forces the
suppliers’ participation, information asymmetry may result in the blind use of blockchain.
Moreover, the limited information about the suppliers’ types also affects the platform’s
subsidy behaviour. In Sect. 4.2, the platform’s subsidy strategy could determine the final
blockchain equilibrium when he has perfect knowledge of the suppliers’ types. However,
in this case where the platform has limited information, the platform’s subsidy behaviour
cannot determine the final blockchain equilibrium.
Different from the game sequence shown in Fig. 1, the platform announces his subsidy
policy after he observes the suppliers’ original choices. At that moment, the platform is
123
Annals of Operations Research
uncertain about the type of the supplier who has not involved into blockchain. Additionally,
the suppliers also have the right to refuse the platform’s subsidy. Following the assumption
of the main body, we let T = 0 to focus on the influence of the platform’s subsidy on the
blockchain adoption. In this part,we are going to studyhow the information asymmetry affects
the platform’s subsidy behaviour and whether it affects the final blockchain equilibrium or
not.
When F > F2, the original equilibrium is NN. The platform is not aware of the real
type of suppliers; however, he knows that he has to offer a higher subsidy for Supplier
B’s participation than Supplier A’s. Considering all possible cases: (1) Neither supplier is
capable, with probability 1−ηa . Suppliers always refuse to join blockchain regardless of the
platform’s subsidy policy. (2) Only Supplier A is capable, with probability ηa(1 − η). At this
time, Supplier A will join blockchain if he gets the subsidy not less than sY N
a = πNN
A −πY N
A .
(3) Both suppliers are capable, with probability ηaη. Supplier B will join blockchain if he
gets the subsidy not less than sYYb = πNN
B − πYY
B . If Supplier B agrees to join, Supplier A
would accept a subsidy not less than sYYa = πNN
A − πYY
A . However, if Supplier B refuses to
join, Supplier A still need a subsidy not less than sY N
a . Notice that sY N
a > sYYa , therefore,
offering the subsidy sYYa won’t make a difference in any cases. In summary, the platform has
two potential subsidy policies when the usage cost is relatively high, i.e., F > F2:
(1) Offering sY N
a , denoted as s1 policy. The expected extra profit of the platform is:
e1 =

.
If sY N
a < sYYb , the subsidy sY N
a cannot encourage a capable Supplier B to join blockchain.
Therefore, the final equilibrium only could be YN. If sY N
a ≥ sYYb , Supplier B would like to
join blockchain when he is a capable supplier, thus, YY equilibrium will happen with the
probability ηb.
(2) Offering sYYb , denoted as s2 policy. The expected extra profit of the platform is:
e2 = ηa(1 − η)
(
πY N
P − πNN
P − sYYb
) + ηb
(
πYY
P − πNN
P − 2sYYb
)
.
Notice that when sY N
a ≥ sYYb , s2 policy is always better than s1 policy, because the
platform could offer a lower subsidy to reach the same equilibrium results. We derive the
feasible condition of s1 policy is F ≤ f2, and the feasible condition of s2 policy is F ≤ f5.
In addition, s2 policy would be the better policy if F ≤ f6.
When F1 < F ≤ F2, suppliers may reach NN, and YN equilibrium. If NN equilibrium
exists, the platform would know that neither supplier is capable. As a result, the platform
doesn’t announce any subsidy policy. If YN equilibrium exists, the platform could update
his belief about Supplier B’s type since he has already known that Supplier A is capable. At
this time, the platform would believe that Supplier B is a capable supplier with probability η,
and the platform could provide a subsidy for Supplier B to transform YN to YY equilibrium.
If Supplier B is a capable supplier, he will join blockchain if he is offered the subsidy not
less than sYYb = πY N
B − πYY
B . If Supplier B is a normal supplier, he will refuse the subsidy.
Therefore, the platform only has one subsidy policy, denoted as s3 policy, when the usage
cost is moderate, i.e., F1 < F ≤ F2. That is, offering sYYb to Supplier B when F ≤ f1.
In fact, the probability of Supplier B being capable has no effect on the platform’s subsidy
policy in this case. The platform doesn’t worry that his subsidy policy has a negative effect
on his performance because a normal supplier always refuses the subsidy, which is consistent
with the platform’s own anticipation.
The following proposition presents the platform’s optimal subsidy policy.
123
Annals of Operations Research
Proposition 9 The platform’s optimal subsidy policy is as follows:
(i) Using s1. policy when max(F2, f6) < F ≤ f2 and sY N
a < sYYb .
(ii) Using s2 policy when F2 < F ≤ min( f5, f6) and sY N
a < sYYb , or sY N
a ≥ sYYb .
(iii) Using s3 policy when F1 < F ≤ min( f1, F2).

Proposition 9 presents the platform’s optimal subsidy policy when he has limited infor-
mation about the suppliers’ types. We notice that all conditions are not dependent on ηa , and
the boundary conditions of YN and YY equilibrium, i.e., f2, f6 are not dependent on ηa or η.
This could be explained by the same reason why the probability of Supplier B being capable
has no effect on the s3 policy. Because the platform provides the subsidy that only can induce
the corresponding capable suppliers to join blockchain. In other words, the platform could
be better off if his subsidy is accepted by capable suppliers, or he at least maintains the same
performance if his subsidy is rejected by normal suppliers. Therefore, the platform won’t
occur loss regardless of the distribution of the supplier type.
We present the numerical results in Fig. 7, where we set η = 0.5 and other parameters
follows the same setting in main body, that is, γ = 0.5, β = 0.9, δ = 0.8, θ = 2, ρH
b = 0.7
and ρH
a = 0.8. There are two subregions in the region of s1 policy: both s1 and s2 policies are
feasible but s1 policy brings more profit, i.e., f6 ≤ F ≤ f5; and s1 policy is the only feasible
policy, i.e., f5 ≤ F ≤ f2; The region of s2 policy shows that the platform uses s2 policy
rather than s1 policy for more extra profits. In the region of original YN equilibrium, the
platform uses s3 policy when F ≤ f1. Proposition 4 shows when the platform knows the real
types of suppliers, he could fully anticipate the final blockchain equilibrium. Therefore, the
results of the platform’s subsidy strategy are certain. However, the platform with the limited
information cannot be sure about the final blockchain equilibrium when he announces the
subsidy policy. We conduct the numerical analysis to present the final equilibrium after the
platform’s subsidy policy in Fig. 8.
Figure 2a given in the main body shows the original equilibrium when T = 0, which still
holds because it only reflects the suppliers’ participant choices. Figure 2b shows the final
equlibriumwhen the platform has perfect information. Comparing Fig. 2b and Fig. 8, we find
that the boundary condition is changed to f6 from f3. This change is caused by the difference
in how the platform make his subsidy policy. With perfect information, the platform directly
offers differentiated subsidy to different suppliers, which allows the platform to capture
as much extra profit as possible. However, with limited information, the platfrom has to

announces his subsidy policy at first. The platform has to announce a uniform higher subsidy
that can encourage a capable supplier B if he wants to reach YY equilibrium.
However, we notice that the boundary conditions of adopting blockchain in Fig. 2b and
Fig. 8 are both f2. This means the subsidy policy with perfect or limited information leads to
the same results regarding to the blockchain adoption consisting of YN and YY equilibrium.
In summary, the blockchain equilibrium in the presence of the platform’s subsidy is basically
unchanged. The finding that the platform’s leadership could improve the blockchain adoption,
and consequently benefits himself and the entire supply chain still holds.
The result reveals that the platform and suppliers always reach a consensus that blockchain
only be adopted when the participant supplier is capable to provide high-quality product.

blockchain. In otherwords, suppliers and the platformallmake the blockchain decision for the
better performance of the whole supply chain. As a consuquence, the information asymmetry
does not affect the qualitative conclusions of the main study.
The above discussion is based on AA mode where both suppliers coperate with the plat-
form in the agency contract. Note that the supply chain members make their short-term
pricing decisions based on the blockchain adoption. The platfrom’s pricing decision under
the reselling contract won’t change since the blockchain adoption doesn’t change. Therefore,
the above findings under information asymmetry would be applicable to the other three sell-
ing modes. As a consuquence, information asymmetry will not siginificantly alter the results
in Sects. 5 and 6.
