Abstract. As an important blockchain application, CBDC (Central
Bank Digital Currency) has received significant worldwide attention as
it can restructure financial market, affect national currency policies, and
introduce new regulation policies and mechanisms. It is widely predicted
that CBDC will introduce numerous digital currency competitions in
various aspects of the global financial market, and winners will lead the
next wave of digital currency market. This paper applies the game the-
ory to study the competitions between different countries, in particular
to analyze whether they should adopt the CBDC program. We propose
two game-theoretic models for CBDC adoption, both analyzing whether
to adopt the CBDC program via the Nash equilibrium. Both game-
theoretic models draw the same conclusion that each country should
adopt the CBDC program regardless of the choices of other counties.
In other words, current currency leaders should adopt CBDC because
it may lose the premier status, and other countries should adopt CBDC
otherwise they risk of getting even further behind in the digital economy.
According to our game-theoretic models, the current market leader who
has 90% of market shares may lose about 19.2% shares if it is not the
first mover.

Game-Theoretic Analysis on CBDC Adoption 295
1 Introduction
CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) has received significant attention
recently, and it is an important blockchain application [4,9,17–19]. Many cen-
tral banks including US Federal Reserve, ECB (European Central Bank), PBOC
(People’s Bank of China), Bank of England have all announced their CBDC
projects. Numerous financial institutions such as World Bank, IMF (Interna-
tional Monetary Fund), BIS (Bank for International Settlements) have initiated
their own CBDC projects. In 2017, IMF recommended that each country develop
her own CBDC program to compete with the cryptocurrencies.
Bank of England (BoE) is the first central bank to propose her own CBDC
program, and since 2014 has published numerous research reports such as RTGS
(Real-Time Gross Settlement) blueprints and conducted many experiments. One
of earliest conclusions of their studies is that there may be a competition between
commercial banks and central banks for deposits because now central banks offer
CBDC, and customers may prefer to save their money as CBDC as it is without
any credit risks, while money in commercial banks still carries risks. This is one
of many competitions that may happen when CBDC is introduced.
Since 2015, BoE has suggested that CBDC will have a profound impact to
the financial world, affect national currency policies, and change the way finan-
cial transactions are made. Indeed, the importance of CBDC cannot be underes-
timated. In 2017, Bordo and Levin predicted that if a country does not develop
its own CBDC program, the country will incur financial risks in future [5]1.
In November 2019, Rogoff of Harvard University said currently there is a new
currency war, but this is not a conventional currency war, but a digital version
[15]. He also mentioned that the new war involves of both regulated financial
market and underground market, where cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins are
often used. He also mentioned that technology is the key driver for these changes.
In addition to the central bank-commercial bank competition for deposits,
IMF have suggested stablecoins issued in the private sector can have a profound
impact to the financial world. Stablecoins are those digital currencies backed by
fiat currencies or other assets such as bonds, but they have stable price, and can
be used do cross-border transactions. The IMF July 2019 report [1] claims if a
stablecoin is supported by a central bank, it behaves like a CBDC. This new
digital currency is called synthetic CBDC (short as sCBDC hereafter), rather
than CBDC, but like CBDC the reserve money is stored in a central bank so
that sCBDC does not have any credit risks. But in this manner, the IMF report
says that there will be competitions between those sCBDC with fiat currency as
people may prefer using those stablecoins rather than their fiat currency. This
1 “Given the rapid pace of payment technology innovation and the proliferation of vir-
tual currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum, it may not be wise for the central bank
to adopt a negative attitude in dealing with CBDC. If the central bank does not pro-
duce any form of digital currency, there is a risk of losing monetary control, and the
possibility of a serious economic recession is greater. Because of this, central banks
act quickly when considering adopting CBDC.”.
296 C. Mou et al.
will also create another competition between commercial banks and stablecoin
entities, both seeking for deposits.
In August 2019, former BoE governor Mark Carney said that a synthetic
hegemony digital currency may replace US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
This is another competition where an sCBDC may compete with US dollars or
any other fiat currency to be the world’s reserve currency.
In June 2020, US Federal Reserve published a research paper [7] supporting
the claim of deposit competition between central banks and commercial banks.
If this is the case, the financial market will indeed be fundamentally changed
due to introduction of CBDC or sCBDC.
Furthermore, stablecoins or sCBDC may compete with each other in the
market place, for example, a large stablecoin will have strong competitive edge
over other stablecoins. For example, in May 2020, ECB issued a report predicting
that Facebook’s Libra may have over 3 trillion Euros in deposit and it may
become the largest fund in Europe. The ECB made this prediction based on
the fact that Facebook is widely used in the world, many Facebook users will
become Libra users.
Thus, many competitions are created due to CBDC or sCBDC:
– Between central banks and commercial banks for deposits;
– Between stablecoin entities and commercial banks for deposits;
– Between stablecoins and fiat currencies;
– Between stablecoins and stalecoins; and
– Between different CBDCs or sCBDCs.
This paper is our first attempt in a series to theoretically study various com-
petitions introduced by CBDC or sCBDC from the viewpoint of game theory
[8]. As done in the game-theoretic analysis on software crowdsourcing [10,11,13],
this paper applies the game theory to investigate whether a specific country will
attempt to develop its own CBDC program. Developing a CBDC program is a
challenge task because this will affect national monetary policies, regulator poli-
cies, technology solutions, security issues as well as consumer protection issues.
Some countries may not have the technology know-how to develop her own tech-
nologies, and for this reason Facebook Libra 2.0 offers to assist any country to
establish her own CBDC programs.
This paper makes the following contributions: game-theoretic models are
applied to analyze whether a country should adopt the CBDC program with
respect to beneifts and cost; and according to these models, each country will
eventually commit to her own CBDC program regardless, confirming the IMF
recommendation made in 2017. In particular, the detailed game-theoretic model
provides explicitly, for a simplified market of two countries of 90% and 10%
market shares respectively, the changes of market shares for all the four possible
cases of whether they adopt CBDC or not (see Table 3 for the details). It is
interesting to see that in such settings, if the current market leader does not
adopt CBDC, it risks 19.2% of the economic market share. This confirms the
conjecture made by Bordo and Levin in 2017 that the CBDC has a serious
impact on national economy system and global market leadership.
Game-Theoretic Analysis on CBDC Adoption 297
This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the existing work related
to CBDC; Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 present our simple and detailed game-theoretic
models for CBDC adoption respectively; Sect. 5 reports our implementation and
preliminary experimental results with the detailed game-theoretic model; Sect. 6
concludes this paper with remarks and future work.
2 Related Work
IMF Report
IMF issued a report “The Rise of Digital Money” in July 2019 [1], and one of
the main theses is that people will choose different forms of money due to conve-
nience. The report proposes two key concepts: 1) sCBDC where reserve money
will be placed in central banks so that stablecoins will be risk free; 2) proposes
three stages of financial market restructuring: coexistence, complementarity, and
substitution. The June 2020 Federal Reserve Report [7] further confirms that the
3rd stage, i.e., substitution, is a likely event as central banks will have monopoly
of deposits. In this case, financial market structure is fundamentally changed.
Digital Currency Areas
Brunnermeier, James and Landau of Princeton University proposed this Digital
Currency Areas (DCA) theory in 2019 [6]. Some of their key findings include:
1) Platforms become the center of financial market: traditionally the centers are
banks, but once Internet-based platforms become the financial center, financial
markets are significantly restructured. Furthermore, those who manage those
platforms will have significant economic advantages; 2) Digital dollarization,
i.e., digital currencies will compete with fiat currencies; 3) Digital fragmenta-
tion: different parts of the world will run different digital currencies due to stiff
competitions among different digital currencies; 4) Role of digital money: digital
currencies and fiat currencies have overlapping but different emphasis as digital
currencies are mainly used in transactions including cross-border transactions.
This theory has received significant attention as BoE, ECB, and Federal Reserve
have quoted and discussed this theory publicly.
Federal Reserve Report
In June 2020, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve released a research report “Cen-
tral Bank Digital Currency: Central Banking for all?” [7]. This report uses a
game theory model, confirming the theory by BoE that there will be competi-
tion between central banks and commercial banks for deposits. It also points out
that the current two-tiered system with a central bank and commercial banks
came after the World War II, before, central banks can play the role of lend-
ing (currently done by commercial banks). Thus, it is not inconceivable that
commercial banks provide different services. In other words, the current banking
structure can be changed if necessary due to CBDC.
The models used include consumers, banks and central banks according to
various scenarios. Yet, over time, people will choose to deposit their money into
298 C. Mou et al.
their central bank as the money will be risk free as money in commercial banks
carries some risks. In this case, central banks have monopoly of deposit, and
commercial banks need to provide different services.
Libra Stablecoin
On June 18th 2019, Libra Association released the whitepaper [2], and created a
great of discussions in the world, especially among central banks and commercial
banks. On April 16th, 2020, the Association released Libra 2.0 whitepaper [3]
(hereinafter referred to as “Libra 2.0”). According to the whitepaper of Libra
2.0, if a country or region is worried that its own fiat currency can be replaced by
Libra, Libra will cooperate with the central bank to establish the CBDC for the
country. Libra 2.0 will no longer pursue public blockchain route, instead it will
follow FATF regulations, such as Travel Rules. Libra 2.0 will also incorporate
embedded supervision mechanisms to monitor transactions in real.
3 Simple Game-Theoretic Model
For a specific country, it has two choices to adopt CBDC, or not. To start it
simple, we assume there are only two countries–C1 and C2, and they compete
in the financial market.
Suppose that E1 is the benefit country C1 gained for a successful domestic
CBDC project, and H1 is the damage to country C2 incurred of a successful foreign
CBDC project in country C1. They are of the similar meanings for E2 and H2.
The benefits gained for a successful domestic CBDC project include improv-
ing its international financial position, gaining the reserve currency status, pro-
viding the same services and sharing platform to countries that cannot develop
their own CBDC as well as managing the digital currency platform. According
to the DCA theory, the entity or the country that owns the platform will have
significant advantage over others who do not. There are other benefits as well.
The damage incurred of a successful foreign CBDC project include deteri-
oration of international monetary position, and possibility of a major financial
crisis, lose of ability to manage national currency policies.
In digital economy, the first mover will have significant advantages over fol-
lowers according to the Davidow law. This law says that the first product of a
class to reach a market automatically gets a 50% market share. If CBDC eco-
nomic model follows the Davidow law, this means those entities that move first
will dominate the market, and this will apply to CBDC issued by central banks,
or CBDC by private parties. In this case, if country (or entity) C1 develops her
CBDC program, while country (or entity) C2 does not, C1 will gain significant
advantages over C2 by owing more than 50% of market share. According the
DCA theory, C1 will have significant economic benefit over C2.
Assume that αi is the success rate for country Ci to develop CBDC program
for i = 1, 2. For example, if C1 has superior technology, then α1 will be close to
1. The game model between these two countries are expressed in the following
Table 1.

Table 1. Simple game-theoretic model for CBDC adoption of two countries C1 and
C2

Develop CBDC Do not develop CBDC
Develop CBDC (E1α1 − H2α2, E2α2 − H1α1) (E1α1,−H1α1)
Do not develop CBDC (−H2α2, E2α1) (0, 0)
In the case that country C2 decides to develop CBDC program: if C1 decides
to develop, it will get the payoff of E1α1 − H2α2; if C1 decides not, it will get
−H2α2. Obviously E1α1 − H2α2 is larger than −H2α2, and thus C1 should
develop her own CBDC program.
If C2 decides not to develop her CBDC program, then C1 should still choose
to develop CBDC, because the benefit of choosing is E1α1, while the benefit of
not developing CBDC is 0, obviously E1α1 is larger. Thus, no matter how C2
chooses, C1 should develop her own CBDC program.
Similarly, regardless whatever C1 chooses, ultimately country C2 needs to
develop her own CBDC program. In this way both countries will develop CBDC
programs as a Nash equilibrium for this model.
However, C1 and C2 will have different benefit E1, E2 and damage H2, H1.
If C1 is powerful economically, but does not develop her CBDC program, the
damage that may be incurred will be significant because potentially it loses her
premier status. However, if C1 develops CBDC, but country C2 does not, C2
will be lagging further behind.
The success probability αi is a function of time and increases with time as
more research results will be available over time, and each country eventually
will be able to develop her own CBDC program. An advanced country may reach
1 before other countries, and achieve Davidow advantages. But eventually, both
α1 and α2 will be close to 1, and this means that every country will be able to
develop her own CBDC program. Yet the first mover will own market shares.
4 Detailed Game-Theoretic Model
Next we aim at establishing a detailed game-theoretic model to analyze the
benefits or losses of a country or an entity in the choice of adopting CBDC. The
benefits or losses are represented merely by the change of the market shares,
and this is because the cost for the economy’s transformation to the existence
of CBDC is negligible compared with the change of market shares.
4.1 Game-Theoretic Settings of the Model
As in Sect. 3, let us focus on the simplest game of 2 players C1 and C2 with
current market shares of M1 and M2, where M1+M2 = 1. Let S1 = S2 = {Y,N}
be the set of pure strategies for C1 and C2, where Y and N stand for adopting
300 C. Mou et al.
and not adopting CBDC respectively. Then for i = 1 and 2, the payoff function
pi for Ci is a mapping from S1 × S2 to [−1, 1], and pi(s) represents Ci’s payoff
given a profile s = (s1, s2) of pure strategies s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2.
For i = 1 and 2, a mixed strategy σi of Ci is a probability distribution over
the pure strategies in Si, where σi(s) is the probability for Ci to choose a pure
strategy s ∈ Si. Denote the space of mixed strategies of Ci by Σi. We can define
the payoff p̃i(σ) of Ci for a mixed strategy profile σ = (σ1, σ2) ∈ Σ1 × Σ2 as
p̃i(σ) =
∑
(s1,s2)∈S1×S2
σ1(s1)σ2(s2)pi(s1, s2),
which is essentially the expected payoff of Ci for the probability distribution σ.
A mixed strategy profile σ∗ = (σ∗
1 , σ
∗
2) ∈ Σ1×Σ2 is called a Nash equilibrium
of the game if p̃1(σ∗
1 , σ
∗
2) ≥ p̃1(s1, σ∗
2) and p̃2(σ∗
1 , σ
∗
2) ≥ p̃2(σ∗
1 , s2) for any pure
strategy s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2. A Nash equilibrium is a state such that each
player in the game maximizes his expected payoff under the condition that the
mixed strategies of the other players are fixed, and thus anyone attempting to
change his mixed strategy from the Nash equilibrium will face a reduced payoff.
For a finite non-cooperative game, at least one Nash equilibrium exists [14].
In this model we will compute the Nash equilibrium of the game to reveal
the probability of a certain player to adopt CBDC. To do this, we need explicit
expressions for the payoff functions.
4.2 Construction of Payoff Functions
We consider a dynamic game in the time t. The players of the game C1 and
C2, together with their pure strategies {Y,N}, keep unchanged regardless of the
time t. But their payoff functions p1 and p2 indeed change with t, as explained as
follows. To simplify our model, the time is discretized to take only non-negative
integers. It may help to assume a unit interval [t0, t0 + 1] of time to be 3 months
in the real world.
For each player Ci in our game, there is a probability of success Probi(t) if
he chooses to adopt CBDC. This probability has an initial value Probi(0) = Pi
and it increases with time (to mimic the increasing storage of underlying related
knowledge and technologies to adopt CBDC). We assume that the increase rate is
a constant c in time for both C1 and C2, and thus we know that the probability
of success for Ci is Probi(t) = min{ct + Pi, 1} for i = 1, 2. Once a player Ci
chooses to adopt CBDC at a certain time t, there is a preparatory duration of
d units of time, and this means that Ci will succeed at the time t + d with a
probability of Probi(t).
Next we discuss the payoff of each player with respect to the four possible
combinations of pure strategies. Basically the payoff of C1 in this game is to gain
the market share of C2 if C1 chooses to adopt CBDC and succeeds while C2 fails
or chooses not to adopt it, and vice versa. Suppose that at a certain time t, C1
finishes its preparatory duration and succeeds in adopting CBDC, then C1 will
take a percentage of C2’s market share at t in the next time interval (t, t + 1).
Game-Theoretic Analysis on CBDC Adoption 301
Denote by M1(t) and M2(t) the market shares of C1 and C2 with respect to t,
and let r (0 < r < 1) be the percentage of gaining (or losing) the market share
in one unit time interval. Then in the above scenario,
M1(t + 1) = M1(t) + rM2(t), M2(t + 1) = (1 − r)M2(t).
And the payoff of C1 in the interval (t, t + 1) is rM2(t), while that for C2 is
−rM2(t).
Combination I, (N,N) at t: in this case the payoffs are p1(N,N)(t) =
p2(N,N)(t) = 0.
Combination II, (Y, Y ) at t: in this case both C1 and C2 choose to adopt
CBDC, and then their payoffs depend on which succeeds first. Since the function
of success probability is Probi(t) = min{ct+Pi, 1} which linearly grows to 1, we
know that the maximum possible length of time in which there exists one and
only one player who succeeds in adopting CBDC is [t + d, T ], where
T := t + d + max
{
�1 − Prob1(t)
c
�, �1 − Prob2(t)
c
�
}
.
For each integer t ∈ [t+d, T ], we can explicitly compute the probability ˜Probi(t)
for Ci to succeed in adopting CBDC at t for the first time (which implies that
Ci fails in the interval [t + d, t − 1]). See Table 2 for an illustrative example of
the computed success probabilities.
With ˜Prob1(t) and ˜Prob2(t) for t ∈ [t + d, T ], we can enumerate each pos-
sible combination of the two first success time T1, T2 ∈ [t + d, T ] of C1 and C2
respectively, together with the possibility PT1,T2 for this combination to happen.
In this way, we can compute the expected payoff of C1, for example (that for C2
is just the opposite):
p1(Y, Y )(t) =
∑
T1,T2∈[t+d,T ]
PT1,T2 ·
(
M2(t)r ·
∑
j∈[0,T2−T1]
(1− r)j when T2 > T1
−M1(t)r ·
∑
j∈[0,T1−T2]
(1− r)j otherwise.
)
.
Combination III, (Y,N) at t: in this case we assume that C2 does not realize
the importance of adopting CBDC until he has lost a considerable percentage
m (0 < m < 1) of his market share. In other words, C2 starts to adopt CBDC
only after he loses m of his market share. Let T1 (t+d ≤ T1 ≤ t+d+� 1−Prob1(t)
c �)
be the time when C1 succeeds in adopting CBDC and T2 = T1 + min{t ∈ Z≥0 :
(1− r)t < 1−m} be the time when C2 first loses at least m of his market share.
Then the earliest time for C2 to succeed in adopting CBDC falls in the range[
T2 + d, T2 + d + � 1−Prob2(t)
c �
]
. For each t ∈
[
T2 + d, T2 + d + � 1−Prob2(t)
c �
]
,
similarly to the case above we can compute the probability and ˜Prob2(t) for
C2 to succeed in adopting CBDC at t for the first time. Then the payoff of C1 is
p1(Y,N)(t) =
∑
t∈
[
T2+d,T2+d+� 1−Prob2(t)
c �
]
˜Prob2(t) · M2(t)r ·
∑
j∈[0,t−T1]
(1 − r)j .
302 C. Mou et al.
Combination IV, (N,Y ): the dual case as III above.
With the payoff functions of C1 and C2 known, we can compute the Nash
equilibrium of the game. Let σ∗ = (σ∗
1 , σ
∗
2) ∈ Σ1×Σ2 be the Nash equilibrium of
the game, then σ∗
1(Y ) (a probability) is the tendency for C1 to choose to adopt
CBDC, and σ∗
2(Y ) is that for C2.
5 Implementation and Experiments
In this section, we first fix the values for our parameters listed in the above
section to have an illustrative model, with the interval [t, t + 1] representing
3 months in the real world in mind.
– Market shares M1 = 0.9, M2 = 0.1: country C1 takes the overwhelmingly
dominant part of the market.
– Preparation duration d = 6: one country needs 18 months to prepare the
adoption of CBDC.
– Initial success probabilities Prob1(0) = 0.5 and Prob2(0) = 0.3, and the
increase rate r of the success rate is set to 0.05.
– The loss rate of market share (in 3 months) r = 0.1: this means that one
country loses 10% of its market share in 3 months if the other player succeeds
but it does not.
– Loss of market shares for awareness m = 0.3.
With the above setup, let us work out the payoff of C1 in combination II
in Sect. 4.2. In this case, both C1 and C2 choose to adopt CBDC at t = 0.
Then at t = 6 (after 18 months, the preparation duration), the probability for
C1 to succeed is 0.5 while that for C2 is 0.3. Furthermore, let us calculate the
probability ˜Probi(t) for Ci to first succeed at time t, as in the following table.
Table 2. An example illustrating the probabilities of first success of two countries at
different time
t ˜Prob1(t) ˜Prob2(t)
6 0.5 0.3
7 0.55 × 0.5 0.35 × 0.7
i (8 ≤ i ≤ 15) (0.5 + 0.05(i − 6)) × ∏
j=0..i−7(0.5 − 0.05j) (0.3 + 0.05(i − 6)) × ∏
j=0..i−7(0.7 − 0.05j)
i (16 ≤ i ≤ 20)
∏
j=0..9(0.5 − 0.05j) Same as above
≥ 21 Same as above
∏
j=0..13(0.7 − 0.05j)
For example, from this table, we will be able to read that the probability
for C1 to succeed at t = 6 AND C2 to succeed at t = 7 for the first time is
0.5×0.245 = 0.1225. In such combination the whole payoff of C1 is (7−6)×3 = 3
months of eating C2’s market share, that is r × M2 = 0.01. Similarly, the payoff
of C2 is −0.01. Traversing all the possible combinations in the above table, we
Game-Theoretic Analysis on CBDC Adoption 303
will be able to compute the expected payoffs of C1 and C2 for the pure strategy
profile (Y, Y ).
We have implemented an algorithm to compute the explicit payoffs for C1 and
C2 with respect to all the 4 combinations of pure strategies. For the parameter
values listed above, the computed payoffs are as shown in Table 3.
Table 3. Payoffs of C1 and C2 for the listed parameter values above
C1 C2
Develop CBDC Do not develop CBDC
Develop CBDC (−0.020990, 0.020990) (0.031578,−0.031578)
Do not develop CBDC (−0.192320, 0.192320) (0, 0)
It is interesting that Table 3 shows, if country C1 with the current dominant
market shares (90%) does not adopt the CBDC program while the other country
C2 with 10% market shares adopts it, then C1 will lose around 19.2% of the
total market shares, which are too significant to lose for C1. This result indeed
partially confirms that the CBDC economic model follows the Davidow law, that
is the first country adopting the CBCD program will take a large amount of the
market shares from those who do not adopt.
Next we input the payoff functions in Table 3 into the software Gambit [12]
for computing the Nash equilibria, and the Nash equilibria is (1, 0) for C1 and
(1, 0) for C2, which means that both C1 and C2 will choose to adopt CBDC with
probability 1. This accords with the analytical result we derive in Sect. 3.
6 Concluding Remarks and Future Work
CBDC and sCBDC have received significant attention by major central banks as
well as bigTech such as Facebook have embraced this new technology. These will
not only provide technology breakthrough but also restructure financial markets
and change national currency policies. This paper has analyzed whether a given
country will commit to developing her own CBDC program given the benefits for
developing the CBDC and potential damages due to inactivity for not developing
the program. The main conclusion is that regardless if current technology status
of the country, eventually the country will commit to developing the CBDC due
to competitions with other countries.
The detailed game-theoretic model indicates that, in a simplified market of
two countries of 90% and 10% market shares respectively, if the current market
leader does not adopt CBDC, it risks 19.2% of the economic market share. This
confirms the conjecture made by Bordo and Levin in 2017 that the CBDC has
a serious impact on national economy system and global market leadership.
Furthermore, if one country is not the current market leader, then it has all

shares from the current leader. According to the New Lanchester Strategy [20],
if an entity achieves 41% of the market shares, it may become the new market
leader.
This paper assumes that benefits associated with CBDC is real, and dam-
ages is also real, and success rates improve over time. The first two assumptions
are realistic as evidenced by the impact of Facebook’s Libra on central banks
and commercial banks in 2019. Furthermore, blockchain or related technolo-
gies have improved significantly during the last twelve months with new theo-
ries, new architecture, new frameworks, and new regulation technologies having
emerged. For example, even Libra has improved her regulation mechanism to
include embedded supervision. Thus, these three assumptions are indeed realis-
tic.
As we mentioned in the introduction, this paper is our first attempt to the-
oretically study various competitions introduced by CBDC from the viewpoint
of game theory. The impact of different values of the parameters in our detailed
game-theoretic model on the expected payoffs of the players based on our fur-
ther experiments will be reported in a forthcoming paper. These further exper-
imental results will tell, for example, how the initial success rates influence the
payoffs of the players in the game, which essentially reflects the importance of
the underlying technological competence of the countries with respect to CBDC
adoption. The simple game-theoretic model of two players can also be extended
to a multiple-player game for more sophisticated analysis, which is part of our
future work. We would like to mention that some computational difficulties in
such extension to a multiple-player game lie in the rapidly growing numbers of
possible combinations of first success time and the increasing hardness of com-
puting Nash equilibria when the number of players is large [16].
