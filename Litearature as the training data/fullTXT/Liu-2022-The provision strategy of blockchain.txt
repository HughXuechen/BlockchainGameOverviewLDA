Abstract
The business activity is inseparable from the support of documental information flow. In
the past, the commercial documents needed a lot of time to get to the point-to-point, which
could lead to problems, such as insecurity or the relatively long time. With the emergence
of new technologies, it is possible to change this information transmission method to enable
fast and accurate dissemination. For considering the possibility of technology adoption, this
study investigates the role of blockchain service in term of market size and file circula-
tion time. Specifically, we construct a game-theoretic model to find the equilibrium strategy
from a manufacturer and two competing retailers. From the perspective of equilibrium, we
investigate the results for market effects, economic effects, service effects, and service effi-
ciency, respectively. Moreover, we also analyze the service strategy of retailers providing
service by manufacturer, time sensitivity, and competitive intensity, respectively. Based on
the above analysis, this study has obtained an equilibrium to support the commercial practice.
In summary, this study has two contributions. On the one hand, we analyze the impact of the
technological investment in blockchain service on asymmetricmarket scale competition. This
result extends the application scope of blockchain service in the market. On the other hand,
this study discusses the impact of time value on technology investment in blockchain ser-
vice. Therefore, through the discussion of our study, the results show the value of blockchain
service in information exchanges.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background andmotivation
In the transactional activity of modern business, the circulation of commercial documents,
which plays an important role, is the carrier of information exchange. These documents
record the transactional information, capital information, and authentication information in
e-documents or in paper documents, which support efficient business activities, especially in
the transnational commerce. For example, in the process of business in an FOB contract, the
seller submits a set of documents to the goods for performing obligations. Correspondingly,
the buyer should pay for goods based on the full documents (Yingle, 2020). According to
the requirements of documental information, the documental delivery time is shorter and the
settlement is more efficient for both parties. In other words, the firm’s superior is that the
high-level efficient circulation of documents reduces the time cost.
To improve the efficiency of business, in 2020, the Ministry of Transport of the People’s
Republic of China issued the “Guidelines on Promoting the Construction of New Types of
Infrastructure in the Transport Sector” (Chinese government, 2020). This document shows
that the application of blockchain technology need to build a highly integrated and efficient
smart transportation infrastructure. This also represents that the government promotes the
digital construction of documents, online business processing, full-chain supervision of dan-
gerous goods, and visualization of the full-process logistics. This means that the blockchain
technology tries to solve some existing problems in the process of traditional trade, including
the long circulation time of documents, unsafe circulation processes, and the loss of circu-
lation value, addressing a low efficiency in the settlement between the two parties (Ahmad
et al., 2021; Jinse, 2021).
In fact, it canfind the value of blockchain service from the existing practice. For example, in
the field of shipping, the Shanghai International Port (Group) Co., Ltd. follows the equipment
interchange receipt (EIR) and paperless packing list in order to fully realize paperless Bill of
Lading. This part involves the avoiding human errors, improving efficiency, and accurately
collecting information through the high-value paperless electronic EIR (Zhihu, 2018). In the
field of retail supply chain, a part of the stakeholders still uses the paper documents and
handwritten signatures, which uses for operating and clearing (CFLP, 2020). The existence
of these paper documents restricts the development of smart commerce, resulting in paper
documents that drag down the clearing cycle, carrier experience that drag down the goods
cycle, and waste in cost management. The JD group uses the blockchain technology to realize
the integration of documental flow and informational flow. Simultaneously, it uses technology
of digital signature to resolve the problem of the unresponsive handles in the traditional
environment. In this process, any abnormalities can be timely discovered to correct mistakes
in time and upload new data to the chain in real-time. In summary, the blockchain technology
improves many of the shortcomings in the delivery of traditional trade documents, improves
the level of commercial services, increases the time value of documents, and ultimately
enhances the operational strength of corporate finance (See Appendix for details of some
examples about some blockchain and document cases in daily business activities). These
practices have been accomplished with the support of the government.
With the blockchain service for firms, they canobtain the newsuperiority in the competitive
environment. For example, in the retail sector, Wal-Mart relies on blockchain technology to
improve operational efficiency and win the trust of consumers (Sohu, 2019). The similar
firms include Kroger and Nestle, which have cooperated with IBM. This technology firm
123

constructs a project to increase the efficiency. “Allowing all participants to share information
quickly and confidently in a strong and trustworthy network”. It is hoped that increased
transparency will promote more responsible behavior by all participants. In a word, from a
perspective of practice, regardless of maritime or retail activities, the firms will have to face
competing behaviors for blockchain service to obtain a commercial superiority, especially
the firm with different market sizes. In this case, firm needs to consider how to choose the
optimal method to satisfy the requirements of competitive market and consumer.
Existing practice shows the potential value of the application of blockchain technology.
Comparing with existing studies, these is a research gap in the service competition between
theoretical researches and practical applications. Specifically, although some research
involves the blockchain application in supply chain management (Dorri et al., 2017; Choi
et al., 2020b; Ghani et al., 2017), there are some limitations in the application of technology in
information flow. Existing studies show the characteristics of blockchain technology, includ-
ing decentralization, security, and flow quickly, it helps to understand the value of real-time
transmission of information (Lieber, 2017; Kim & Shim, 2018; Saberi et al., 2019; Song
et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2022). From the perspective of blockchain applications, the knowl-
edge gap refers to the discussion of blockchain service to competing firms on different market
sizes. It also helps to find the value of blockchain application for different firms by technical
features of blockchain service. Therefore, our research helps to understand that blockchain
technology facilitates the digitization and reduces the negative impact of information flow.
These existing commercial practice and theoretical researches show that competing enter-
prises are different from the service level and market scale. The supply chain members
closest to consumers are the downstream enterprise, which has different service strategies
to achieve the optimal selection. Therefore, in the environment of blockchain service, there
is a gap between the blockchain service of upstream and downstream enterprises, especially
the information activities of documents (e.g. real-time). This gap leads to some questions
to ponder. For example, what is the equilibrium strategy for competing firms to provide the
blockchain service under the specific condition? How to obtain the best strategic decisions?
All these questions can play a positive role in the rational operation of firms.
1.2 Research questions andmajor findings
Based on the research motivation and research gap in practical activities, we construct a
two-echelon supply chain of manufacturer and retailer by using a game-theoretical model
to analyze the three questions from the provision strategy of blockchain service. The basic
logic is that research finds the impact of market effect (e.g. product price and product quan-
tity), strategy choice, and other factors before and after the service provision of blockchain
technology. Specifically, the research questions are as follows.
First, from the perspective of competitive retailers, what are the changes in market effects,
such as product price and product quantity under the influence of documental circulation
time and market size?
Specifically, the result shows that the changes in market demand and price are affected
by the circulation time of the documents and the market size. Intuitively, we believe that the
firms can improve market prices and demand by using service and improving the positive
influence of documental circulation time on price and demand in any conditions. However,
this result may be one-side to our results. When the circulation time for documents or firm
with small market size does not have a certain level, even if blockchain services are provided,
the price and demand of firm cannot be reasonably promoted.

Second, from the perspective of economic effect and service efficiency, what is the equi-
librium strategy for competing retailer to offer blockchain service, respectively?
Specifically, the result shows that the two retailers of blockchain service are equilibrium
strategies under the condition of fixed competitive intensity. When the combination of rela-
tively low market scale and short circulation time, the large retailer as a service provider is
an equilibrium strategy. When the document is a long circulation time, the retailer’s service
strategy cannot improve the circulation time. Additionally, from the perspective of service
efficiency and service value, the results show that the blockchain service of small retailer
is more efficient. The blockchain service provides by large-scale retailers give full play to
the advantages of core enterprises and reduce the loss of commercial value caused by time
waste. From the perspective of consumer, the service behavior of competing retailers brings
the greatest benefits.
Third, which is the equilibrium strategy for competing retailers on the blockchain service
by themanufacturer? In addition, howdoes documental circulation timeaffect the equilibrium
strategy?
Specifically, the results show that when themarket size is small, the largest retailers change
their service strategy from providing services to not providing services. The deep reason lies
in the influence of the service effect produced by the service of upstream manufacturers.
In this way, the services of upstream companies are transferred to downstream companies.
In terms of homogeneity and heterogeneity of circulation time sensitivity, enterprises with
competitive strength can find that it is the equilibrium strategy for services provision by both
retailers.
1.3 Contribution statements and organization
We compare the existing literature and practical activities to find the research gap in
blockchain service and supply chain management. To sum up, the contribution of this study
has three aspects. First, while some studies consider the time factor in supply chain man-
agement (Ding et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; He et al., 2021), we consider the circulation
time of the documents to highlight the real-time technical characteristics of the blockchain
service environment (Saberi et al., 2019). Second, from the perspective of information flow,
although some existing studies have considered the application of blockchain technology in
supply chain management (Astill et al., 2019; Choi, 2020b), the existing literature absents
the discussion of relationship between of the blockchain service and the strategic choices of
competing firms. Our research enriches the research on blockchain technology in operations
management. Third, we investigate the conditions for combining documental circulation by
blockchain service. The results help to understand the commercial value of the information
flow and the blockchain in trade activities.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 is a literature review; Sect. 3 introduces the
basic model andmodel design; Sect. 4 conducts an analysis from the aspects of market effect,
economic effect, service effect, and service efficiency. Finally, the relevant conclusions and
management implications are presented in Sect. 5. In order to show the results more clearly,
we show the equilibrium results and propositional proofs in the E-Appendix.

2 Literature review
2.1 Study of service provision
Our research is related to service provision, which involves a discussion of specific factors
and optimal strategies. Specifically, from the perspective of factors, existing studies discuss
product price, subsidy, or service preference. For example, Zhu et al., (2018) point the optimal
strategy of price subsidy for general internet services provided by a high-value product
freight service providers. The shippers’ price is willing to pay depends on the amount of
transportation and the security level of the investment. From the perspective of optimal
choice, existing studies analyze the strategic or tactical method to service. For example,
Zhang et al., (2021a,2021b) analyze the optimal selling strategy for providing information
to omni-channel retailers in the case of the demand information and valuation uncertainty for
new products. Sun et al., (2022) investigate the digital showroom strategy for dual-channel
supply chain to achieve the channel coordination. Based on the above-mentioned, existing
studies investigate the methods to service provision. From aspect of our research, this paper
takes into account the role of blockchain service into the case of reducing time of documental
circulation, which shows the features of the blockchain technology (Dai et al., 2017; Chang
et al., 2019), such as accuracy and real-time. Meanwhile, this case also supports the case
of maritime supply chain in the documental activities. This is different from the previous
research results (Wu, 2012; Ding et al., 2018).
2.2 Study of blockchain and supply chainmanagement
Our research is related to blockchain and supply chain management. In the blockchain activi-
ties of supply chain, supply chainmanagement involves different links, including rawmaterial
supply management, manufacturing production management, distribution logistics, and ter-
minal consumption (Saberi et al., 2019). Moreover, it expands some scopes of the application
of blockchain service, including food traceability (Astill et al., 2019; Bumblauskas et al.,
2020), information disclosure and privacy issues (Dorri et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2020b),
smart contracts (Christidis & Devetsikiotis, 2016), and financial management (Treleaven
et al., 2017; Choi, 2020a). Based on this method, the supply chain members increase the
operational efficiency over traditional operation (Ghani et al., 2017), which better reflects the
changes in information flow. It also resolves the problem of the information islands in the
supply chain (Dominguez et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a, c). Through the operational man-
ner by blockchain service, the stakeholders integrate information flow, capital flow, logistics,
business flow, and technology flow to realize the high-level efficiency and low-level cost
(Aydiner et al., 2019; Kamble et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b). Therefore, it is necessary
for us to find the new solution for blockchain service based on the existing literature (Choi,
2019; Gurtu & Johny, 2019; Lahkani et al., 2020; Narwane et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021;
Song et al., 2022). In summary, existing studies do not consider the influence of commercial
documents activities in the time process. In this study, we investigate the quantitative results
of documental transfer time to find the optimal solution in the environment of blockchain
technology.

2.3 Study of supply chain competition and cooperation
Our study is related to competition and cooperation in supply chain. For example, from
the perspective of cooperation and supply chain structure, Zhang et al., (2021a, 2021b)
investigate the two competitive platforms in the changes of product price and commission.
From the perspective of supply chain contract, Tao et al., (2021) discuss the strategies about
newsvendor models in different cases. Niu et al., (2022) investigate the optimal strategies
in the case of information leakage by demand uncertainty and signal inference. From the
perspective of the relationship between supply chain power and co-opetition, Zhu & He
(2017) investigate the decision on product greenness from the supply chain structure, green
product types, and competition types. Based on the above-mentioned, the existing literature
analyzes the impacts of parameter in supply chain cooperation. Although our study is similar
to the above literature, these discussions only slightly investigate the influence of circulation
time and asymmetric competition. Therefore, this result could provide new implications for
firms about technological competition.
2.4 Study of service efficiency
Our study is related to service efficiency. Some existing literature uses the other methods to
find results of service efficiency, including function efficiency, ecological efficiency, or energy
efficiency. For example, Zheng et al., (2018) use a DEA model to evaluate energy service
efficiency in China and guide different regions to choose the most effective ecological and
energy-saving measures. Xu & Yang (2021) examine the efficiency of port transportation by
supporting blockchain technology. The relevant aspects (e.g. service efficiency) are different
from our research. We use the proportional to investigate the retailers with different market
capacities provide the blockchain services. By investigating the proportional relationship
between service inputs and outputs, we obtain the service value from the economic efficiency
of blockchain service. From the perspective of competing retailers, it is the best choice to
provide an equilibrium strategy for blockchain services.
2.5 Knowledge gap
Based on the above-mentioned, we elaborate the significance from the realistic needs and
research differences. From the perspective of realistic needs, we find that the blockchain ser-
vice is gradually receiving more attention in different industries. When this service is used
as a competitive advantage for firm, there is seldom the related discussion in the existing
research. This case cannot be an all-round supported business practice. For making up this
gap, our research analyzes the competitive cases based on existing practice, which helps
to understand the temporal value of blockchain service in the case of competition. From
the perspective of research differences, we summarize two aspects from the literature gap,
such as asymmetric competition and reduction of documents circulation time, which help to
understand the possibilities of actual activities of blockchain application within the scope of
maritime industry or retail industry. Based on the above-content, we provide some manage-
ment implications for the practice, including market effect, economic effect, service effect,
and service efficiency. To better understand the position of this research among the existing
studies, we summarize the Table 1 to show the research differences as below.

3 Model
This section describes the basic setting of the model to explain the influences of compet-
ing retailers on the provision of blockchain services, including the supply chain structure,
assumption, utility function, profit function, and decision sequence, respectively.
3.1 Modeling framework of supply chain structure
We construct the supply chain structure with a manufacturer and two retailers. Specifically,
the manufacturer does not provide the blockchain service. The competitive retailers have
two strategies, such as providing blockchain service (Y) or not providing blockchain service
(N). Therefore, the results are shown in Fig. 1; Table 2. Based on the above-mentioned,
we further explain the goal of the structure. Specifically, the firms need to find the new
methods in order to increase the competitive superiority. Correspondingly, in our study, we
use blockchain service to increase the firm’s benefit through documents activities. In this case,
the blockchain technology can reduce the circulation time in document activities through the
characteristics of transparency and technical credibility, which also shows the potential time
value of blockchain technology in the environment of competition.

3.2 Model sssumption and parameter description
3.2.1 Model assumption
(1) We investigate four scenarios to explain the effect of competition at different sizes of
retailers when the manufacturer without blockchain service, including NN, YN, NY,
YY based on the Table 2, respectively.
(2) According to the existing literature (Huang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2020), we set the
market ratio of retailer 1 and retailer 2 as A1/A2 � a. The Ai (i � 1, 2) means there is
no basic demand for blockchain service. To highlight the discussion of main question,
we set the A2 � 1 in order to find the changes in demand of retailer 1. Moreover, the
demand of retailer 1 is A1 � a(0 < a < 1). Based on the above-conditions, we can
construct the utility function to show the consumers’ utility (Cai, 2010). The result is
shown as follows.
U �
∑
i�1,2
(
αi qi − q2i /2
)−bq1q2 −
∑
i�1,2
piqi (1)
where αi � Ai (1 + 1(i)si ), i � 1, 2. In this term, 1(i) � 0or1 represents whether
a competing retailer is using blockchain service. When the retailer provides the
blockchain service, the term 1(i) � 1; otherwise, the term 1(i) � 0. In addition,
the pi , qi , and b represent product price, product quantity, and competitive intensity,
respectively. The
∑
i�1,2
(
αi qi − q2i /2
)−bq1q2 is utility of consumers with smooth
and strictly concave (Huang et al., 2013). The bq1q2 means substitution between prod-
uct 1 and product 2 with b > 0 as an indicator of substitutability. The last term of
formula (1) refers to the expenditure cost of consumer needs. In a word, the basic
logic of formula (1) is the net utility gain to the customer. With this formula, we can
obtain the demand function in the condition of maximum net utility from the customer’s
blockchain service.
123
Annals of Operations Research
(3) To describe the circular time of the document activities, we use the term βt to find the
influence of the circular time. In addition, the time-sensitivity coefficient is β, which
represents the degree of time impact. Therefore, the term βt shows the value of docu-
mental activities in traditional business. In blockchain business, this technology allows
the timely transmission of document information (Wang et al., 2019b; Pournader et al.,
2020), which also shows the features of blockchain technology, such as transparency.
This way can reduce the loss of documental cycle time. In the basic analysis, the time-
sensitive for two retailers is the same (β) in order to indicate the value of blockchain
technology in information activities. In the part of extension, we also investigate the
influence of time sensitivity on the optimal strategy.
(4) For the service level of blockchain technology, we set the specific level of service as
s Ai (i � 1, 2; A � NN ; Y N ; NY ; YY ). From the perspective of cost structure, we use
the unit service cost (ks Ai ) and maintenance cost (m
(
s Ai
)2
) to describe the changes of
blockchain technology based on the existing literature (Yang et al., 2020). In addition,
to focus on the main question, we consider the unit cost of operation as 1
2 s
A
i and
maintenance cost as 1
2
(
s Ai
)2
based on the literature (Li et al., 2012; Khanjari et al., 2014;
Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2021). In other words, the cost efficiency
of blockchain technology is at a medium level (Wang & Shin, 2015). Correspondingly,
if a firm wants to provide blockchain service, it needs to pay the per service cost
sYYi
2
and the investment cost 1
2
(
s Ai
)2
. In other words, these parameters are the marginal cost
as 1/2 in the environment of blockchain service. Note that this assumption is consistent
with the existing literature in order to explain the rationality of the conditional setting
(Li et al., 2012; Khanjari et al., 2014; He et al., 2019). Furthermore, the structure is set
in such a way that is does not change the main results.
(5) The model is set up to satisfy the rational person supposition, which obtains the maxi-
mum benefit or consumption experience, such as manufacturer and retailer.

3.3.1 Utility function and demand function
According to the description of themodeling framework, we can obtain the utility functions in

According to setting of models, the four scenarios have different decision sequences. We
give an example to demonstrate the decision-making process in Fig. 2. Specifically, the man-
ufacturer has the highest priority in terms of price setting. If a blockchain service provision
strategy exists, the service-level determination will have the second priority. Then, according

to the optimal market quantity of competing retailers, the optimal market price corresponding
to the two retailers is determined. Finally, a gap is performed. We construct the Stackelberg
game model to obtain the basic model (see Appendix A). In addition, from the perspective
of service efficiency, it analyzes the effect of service delivery.

4 Model analysis
In this section, we analyze the market effect, economic effect, service efficiency, service
value, and consumer surplus, respectively.Moreover,we give somemanagement implications
according to the analytical results.
4.1 Market effect of blockchain service
4.1.1 The quantity strategy
We investigate the changes of product quantity under different scenarios. Specifically, we
compare the impact of market demand with that before and after the provision of blockchain
services. The results are shown as Proposition 1.
Proposition 1 (The Changes in the Quantity of Products on the Market)
(1) the change in quantity R1 with R2 no change:
(a) when R2 does not provide service, qNN
1 < qY N
1 ; (b) when R2 provides service,
qNY
1 < qYY1 ;
(2) the change in quantity R2 with R1 no change:
(a) when R1 does not provide service, qNN
2 < qNY
2 ; (b) when R1 provides service,
qY N
2 < qYY2 ;
Proposition 1 discusses the changes inmarket demand. Specifically, the proposition shows
the changes in the quantity of products. In fact, according to the existing economic theories
and literature (Priyamvada et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), the investment behavior will
promote economic development. In other words, it will also increase the product quantity
studied in the literature. Therefore, based on the analysis of investment behavior, the firm (e.g.
retailer in our study) considers to invest in blockchain technology to increase its competitive
superiority in themarket share. In other words, other technologies also can achieve the similar
results. Combined with a competitive perspective, it also shows the same changing trend.
When a fixed competitor chooses the render service, the service provision of blockchain
will increase the product quantity, which generates higher than the quantity of non-service
provision. In addition, this change in product quantity does not change with competitor’s
service strategy. Based on the existing literature, we find that the changes of product quantity
are similar to Niu & Mu (2020). They consider the blockchain as quality verification with a
multinational supply chain structure. In this study, the e-retailer has a higher order quantity in
the case of blockchain service. This also explains that our research in the changes of product
quantity is reasonable. Moreover, the Proposition 1’ can be derived.
Proposition 1‘ (Strategy of Product Quantity).
Through the expansion of products quantity by blockchain technology, the firm can obtain
a competitive superiority.
The proposition 1’ shows the role of blockchain service in the changes of product quantity.
However, this strategy will increase the competitive intensity due to the investment behavior
of the firms. Therefore, in order to find out the different changes in market activities, we
further analyze the changes in product price to find out the influence of file transfer time and
competitive retailers.
123
Annals of Operations Research
4.1.2 The price strategy
We analyze the changes in product price at the highest price for every scenario. The result
is shown in Fig. 3 and Proposition 2. Specifically, when the low-level circulation time of the
document and market size of retailer 1, the product price of retailer 2 is higher than retailer 1
using blockchain service. In addition, when the market size of retailer 1 and retailer 2 are the
same, the circulation time of documents can be relatively prolonged, which helps to improve
the consumer experience through the blockchain service of competitive retailers.
Proposition 2 (Market Price Strategy)
The competitive retailers providing blockchain service can obtain the highest price in
the case of converging market size. In addition, when the market interval ratio is low, the
party with the larger market interval decides a higher market price than other scenarios. The
documental circulation time is longer, the service efficiency is weaker.
From Fig. 3 and Proposition 2, we can find the changes in the price strategy. Specifically,
when themanufacturer does not provideblockchain service, its behavior of productiondoesn’t
impact the product price, which leads to marginal effect. This case is also consistent with
classical economic theories and the existing literature (Fan et al., 2022). Moreover, when
two competitive retailers provide blockchain service, the retailer with the large market size
has a negative effect of prolonging documentability due to the circulation time. In other
words, through providing the blockchain service, the firm can obtain an effective way to
obtain higher benefits per unit of product. When the party with the smaller market size (R1)
provides blockchain technology, the highest price strategy is R2 for providing the services
unless certain market capacity conditions are met. Besides, the circulation time is longer,
the firm’s benefit of blockchain is worse. When the circulation time reaches a threshold, the
competing retailers without blockchain service will set the higher product prices.
From the perspective of firms, if retailers provide the blockchain service, they can obtain
the product quantity. To explain this case clearly, we give two examples in order to elaborate
the Fig. 3 and Proposition 2. For example, from the report of Deloitte, supplier adopts the
blockchain service in order to find a reasonable segment of product market in the fresh food
supply chain. It obtains a higher price when the quality of the product is higher (Atimescn,
2021). Moreover, the Spiceworks, as a survey company, finds that the large firms are 10 times
more likely than small companies to adopt emerging technologies, including blockchain, arti-
ficial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (Shilian, 2021). In other words, the different size
of enterprise also affects the choice of blockchain strategy. Based on the above-mentioned,
the existing examples can demonstrate the rational results of our study. Therefore, we can

WhereO � Y ,N ,− represents the

123
Annals of Operations Research
obtain the two aspects of management implication. On the one hand, the firm should consider
the adoption of blockchain service in order to obtain higher price based on their own market
size and the circulation time of documents. On the other hand, although the highest price
helps to increase the unit benefit, the competitive intensity will be increase in the end-market.
The firm needs to consider this reason to rationalize the price.
4.2 Economic effect of blockchain service
4.2.1 The equilibrium strategies of the retailer
By analyzing the profits of competing retailers, we can obtain strategy for different cases.
Specifically, from the perspective of competitive retailers, we can obtain Proposition 3 and
Fig. 4.
Proposition 3 (Economic Effect of the Retailer)
(1) the change in profit of R1 with R2 unchanged:
(a) when R2 does not provide service, πNN
1 < πY N
1 ; (b) when R2 provides service,
πNY
1 < πYY
1 ;
(2) the change in profit of R2 with R1 unchanged:
(a) when R1 does not provide service, πNN
2 < πNY
2 ; (b) when R1 provides service,
πY N
2 < πYY
2 ;
The Proposition 3 and Fig. 4 show the changes in profits with competing retailers. Specifi-
cally, when one retailer chooses a fixed strategy, another retailer’s service could help increase
the profit of the enterprise. Moreover, through the integration of profit with different results,
we can obtain the equilibrium, such as provision of blockchain with both retailers or large-
scale retailers. This result is similar to the existing literature (Debo and Li, 2020). This is
because the large firm has financial support for blockchain service. In addition, if a strategy
YY exists, it represents the value of competition in the market. In terms of documents cir-
culation time, the blockchain service cannot be redeemed for a long time. In other words, if
the document circulates for a long time, it is worthless.
Based on the above analysis, we can give two aspects of management implications. On
the one hand, from the perspective of market size (a), the competitive retailers can consider
increasing their service to obtain a competitive superiority. In other words, the retailer should
consider the change of profit. This is because part of the retailer’s profit will be converted
into the investment cost of blockchain technology, which reduces the profit. Besides, while
both companies provide blockchain service with increased competitive intensity, the profits
Fig. 4 The competitive retailer
services provide an equilibrium
strategy
123
Annals of Operations Research
will get from competitive benefits of similar size. On the other hand, from the perspective of
circulation time of document (t), the longer the document circulation time, the lower the time
value, and the smaller the positive impact of time savings. To support this result, we give an
example to explain this point. For example, the low-level efficient circulation of document
leads to an increased pressure on the capital occupation in the international trade, resulting in
a less efficient turnover in the international trade. This situation also reduces the operational
efficiency.
4.2.2 The equilibrium strategies of the manufacturer
The analysis of the manufacturer’s profit allows us to obtain strategies for different cases.
Specifically, we can obtain Fig. 5 and Proposition 4.
Proposition 4 (Economic Strategy)
a. From the perspective of manufacturer, the optimal strategy is for both firms to provide
the blockchain service.
b. When the circulation time of document is short and the smaller retailers are specific
conditions, the economic strategy is to provide blockchain service for two firms. When
smaller retails do not meet the specific condition of market size, the economic strategy
is to provide blockchain service to large-scale companies.
The Fig. 5 and Proposition 4 show the optimal strategy and equilibrium strategy. Specif-
ically, from the perspective of manufacturer, it benefits from competitive activities with
retailers. This is because the investment in blockchain service increases the quantity and
price of product. The manufacturer obtains more production opportunities. Moreover, from
the equilibrium perspective, the firms can have two strategies, such as NY and YY. This
means that the firms can choose the different strategies according to the changes of market
size and circulation time of documents, achieving a triple-win result. Therefore, we can pro-
vide some management implications. On the one hand, the firms use a triple-win approach
to obtain the benefits. However, it also leads to an increase in the intensity of competition
in the case of YY. In other words, this way leads to duplication of investments. In this case,
the firm needs to consider the optimal strategy according to the changing market conditions.
On the other hand, the firms also need to consider the influence of circulation time of the
documents on the optimal strategy. If the circulation time is longer, the need for the firm to
choose the blockchain service to improve its benefits due to the ambiguity of the results of
blockchain service.

4.3 Service effect of blockchain service
In this section, we analyze the changes in service effects by using blockchain technology.
Specifically, we discuss the service quality when the retailers provide blockchain services to
illustrate the impact of service effects. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and Proposition 5.
Proposition 5 (Service Strategy)
The service strategy has two cases according to the condition of documents circulation
and market size, such as strategies NY and YN.
Figure 6 and Proposition 5 show the result of service quality in the three cases with
blockchain service. Specifically, the optimal strategies are NY and YN.When the circulation
time of documents meets certain constraints, the retailer with the large market size provides
the high-level blockchain service. When the circulation time of document meets a relatively
long condition, the retailer with a smaller market size provides the high-level blockchain ser-
vice. In fact, this is because the firm obtains a competitive superiority through the blockchain
service, especially for longer document circulation times. Moreover, in conjunction with the
discussion of benefits, the strategy with the highest level of blockchain service provision
is not necessarily the most profitable strategy. In other words, the firm should consider the
optimal service intensity to obtain the optimal benefit. This way can reduce unnecessary
investments and realize the optimal investment in blockchain service. Based on this result,
we can find that the existing literature is similar to this result (Yang et al., 2020). This result
provides explanation about service advantage.
4.4 The efficiency and value of blockchain services
In this section, we investigate the value of service efficiency and service value. On the one
hand, we define the formula to show the service efficiency. On the other hand, we discuss
the value of access to blockchain services in terms of document circulation time.
4.4.1 The efficiency of blockchain service
According to the existing literature (Stefaniec et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019), we define that
the formula (2) represents the service efficiency based on the return on investment (ROI) of
the inputs and outputs. This index describes the ratio of return from blockchain investment
during the operational life. When the ROI is higher, the economic performance is better.
123
Annals of Operations Research
Based on this method, we can obtain the Proposition 6.
RO I � Prof i t
T otal investment cost
× 100% (2)
Proposition 6 (Economic Efficiency of ROI)
From the perspective of ROI, the service efficiency of small retailer (R1) is higher than
the large retailer (R2) by using blockchain technology.
Proposition 6 shows the results of ROI. Specifically, the result shows that the smaller
retailer has an efficient superiority. In other words, this doesn’t mean that the efficiency is the
same in the case of two retailers that tend to have the same market size. The firm obtains the
key competitive advantage through enhancing the vitality of firm (Jiemian, 2017). If a firm
uses the market scale to obtain the market share without a service strategy, it will lose its own
market share. From the perspective of practical business, Shandong Zhishun Industries and
Commerce Co. Ltd (ZIC), as an unknown and small firm in China, is focusing on providing
technical services in conjunction with ZhuBaJie (as a service website). ZIC invests its costs
in channel expansion to obtain a lot of service profit. After three months, the manager finds
the input-output ratio is 1:10, which means a relatively high profit of ratio (Yesky, 2021).
The standpoint and practice are consistent with the general cognition. In other words, the
small retailers have a more efficient decision-making system than larger enterprises (Small
business, 2021). In summary, when a firm chooses the strategy with the best economic effect,
it is not necessarily the most efficient in its service strategy.
4.4.2 The accessible value of transmission efficiency
Wedefine the formula (3) to represent the relationship between traditional documental activity
and blockchain service1. This index shows the accessible value of the documents using
blockchain service. The results are shown in Proposition 7.
V alue loss ratio � T OT LE T I ME V ALUE
PROF IT
× 100% (3)
Proposition 7 (Accessible Value of Blockchain Service)
(a) The loss of value caused by time loss:
Value loss ratio (both no investment) < Value loss ratio (R1 no investment) < Value loss
ratio (R2 no investment);
(b) The option values of the blockchain:
Accessible value (both investment) >Accessible value (R2 investment) >AccessibleValue
(R1 investment).
Proposition 7 shows the relationship between the loss of time value in documental cir-
culation and the option values of the blockchain. Specifically, this result shows the value of
blockchain service. When the large retailer does not provide services, the loss of benefits
reaches a maximum. The reason for this is that large firm has an impact on the product quan-
tity in the market. In other words, it leads to reduce the technical vitality. Correspondingly,
1 The idea of the blockchain approach to modeling the value of transmission efficiency options is derived
from the DEA model. The purpose is to find the relationship between the time value and blockchain service.
Therefore, we consider both sides of documental circulation in terms of value loss and blockchain service
benefits. In addition, we construct the formula (3) similar to the input-output model of DEA, which helps to
understand the value of blockchain service.
123
Annals of Operations Research
the retailers provide the blockchain service to reduce the circulation time of documents. This
result can find in the value of blockchain in practical business (Shou, 2019). For example,
in 2019, Xi’an Branch of China Merchants Bank completed an export accounts receivable
trade financing business using the cross-border business blockchain service platform, with
a financing amount of USD 307,000. The verification time of the documents was reduced
from several days to within 10 mins through the verification of the blockchain platform.
This function shows the accessible value of blockchain for documental circulation with short
times. In summary, the documental transmission is the higher-level efficiency and the value
loss ratio is medium. It helps to understand the role of the relationship between efficiency
and value of blockchain services.
4.5 Customer surplus of blockchain service
In this section, we investigate the customer surplus of blockchain service. Specifically, we
can obtain the result from formula (1). The result is shown in Proposition 8.
Proposition 8 (Customer Surplus)
CSNN < CSY N < CSNY < CSYY
Proposition 8 shows the changes of consumers’ interests in different scenarios. Specifi-
cally, the strategy YY is higher than other strategies. The reason is value of blockchain in a
competitive retailers, which brings a technological experience to the consumers. Therefore,
we can provide some management implications. On the one hand, if there is the possibility to
provide service both firms, they can obtain the benefits, which realize the balance of benefits.
On the other hand, the firm should consider the comprehensive influence of profit, service
efficiency and consumer interests to achieve an equilibrium strategy under multi-objective
conditions.
4.6 Retailer’s service strategy withmanufacturer provision service
In this section, we investigate the market response from manufacturers through blockchain
service, which extends the basic analysis. We briefly give the results of the discussion. The
details can refer the E-appendix. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
Figure 7 shows the equilibrium strategy of competing retailers in the case of manufac-
turer’s blockchain service. Specifically, the strategy NY changes the NN strategy. In addition,
the documental circulation time expands specific value (from 1.5 units to 2 units) due to the
Fig. 7 The equilibrium strategy of
competitive retailers in the case
of manufacturer’s blockchain
service
123
Annals of Operations Research
influence of upstream manufacturers’ services. When the retailer chooses the blockchain
service, it leads to a double marginal effect, which also increases the product quantity. More-
over, this result also leads to an increase in the circulation time of documents. That is to say
that the improvement of service intensity will increase the circulation time of documents and
improve the service level. Based on the above analysis, we can provide some management
implications. On the one hand, firms need to consider the changes in strategies by affecting
the manufacturer’s blockchain service according to specific conditions. On the other hand,
from the perspective of documental circulation time, blockchain service will extend the doc-
ument circulation time in the case of manufacturer’s blockchain service. Specifically, this
result shows that the circulation time of document in blockchain service will be prolonged.
If we consider the change of time in Figs. 4 and 7, we can find the maximum time for the
effective selection strategy about 1.8-unit in Fig. 4 into increase the 2.0-unit in Fig. 7. Besides,
this result is based on the blockchain service adopted by the manufacture, which changes
the blockchain’s service strategy in different retailers. In this way, we can justify this result.
Therefore, the firms should consider the strategies of upstream firm in order to determine a
reasonable technological solution.
4.7 Time value of the transfer document
In this section, we investigate the influence of time heterogeneity, which extends the basic
analysis. We briefly give the results of the discussion. The details can refer the E-appendix.
The results are shown in below.
4.7.1 Time sensitivity consistency
In this part, we investigate the same sensitivity in the documental circulation time. The result
is shown as Proposition 9 and Fig. 8.
Proposition 9 (Strategy of Homogeneous Time-Sensitivity)
The time-sensitivity of documental circulation is low and the document circulation time
is short. In addition to the time dimension, the equilibrium strategy is the strategy selection
that does not change in Fig. 8.
Proposition 9 and Fig. 8 show the changes of the equilibrium strategy for the same time
sensitivity. Specifically, the same time sensitivity will not affect the basic choice of the
equilibrium strategy. In this case, the firm needs to focus on the changes in the maximum
circulation time of the documents. In other words, from the perspective of time, the firm can
consider the service provision strategies based on the importance of documents.
Fig. 8 Equilibrium strategy selection under the same time sensitivity changes
123
Annals of Operations Research
Fig. 9 Equilibrium strategy selection under different time-sensitivity changes
4.7.2 Time sensitivity inconsistency
In this part, we investigate the heterogeneous time-sensitive in document circulation time.
The result is shown as Fig. 9.
Figure 9 shows the influence of heterogeneous time sensitivity on the choice of equilibrium
strategies. Specifically, when the time-sensitivity of the two retailers is at a low to medium
level, the choice of potential service strategies shows different performance trends. When the
time-sensitivity is high, the available service strategies change in both cases. This is because
it is influenced by the market size of the retailers. Although manufacturer has the priority in
the highly competitive supply chain, they have more control over the market than other com-
panies. However, for retailers with fierce competition, if themarket size is fixed, R2’s share of
the overall market will determine the capacity ratio of the service strategy. Therefore, when
R2’s documental circulation sensitivity reaches the pinnacle, the decision-making power
affects the overall decision-making in the downstream market. While the retailer’s decision-
making in the small market (R1) will affect the overall decision-making power to a certain
extent, the retailer’s influence on the market in the large market is “incompetent”.
Based on the above analysis, we provide the management implications. When the het-
erogeneous documental circulation time exists, the retailers of small market scales should
follow the rules of large retailer. Therefore, the firm adopts the blockchain service, which
helps to enhance the consistency of market strategy choices.
4.8 The influence of competition intensity on equilibrium strategy
In this section, we investigate the influence of competitive intensity, which extends the basic
analysis. We briefly give the results of the discussion. The details can refer the E-appendix.
The results are shown in Fig. 10.
Figure 10 shows that the influence of changes in market competition on the service strate-
gies of competing retailers. Specifically, as the intensity of competition increases, the available
123
Annals of Operations Research
Fig. 10 Influence of Market Competition Changes on Service Strategy of Competitive Retailers
range (or area) for the newNY andYY strategies decreases. In other words, although compet-
itive intensity reduces the available area, it does not change the results of the basic discussion.
Therefore, when retailers pay attention to the competitive intensity, the more substitutability
there is, the more likely firms are to adopt blockchain to accommodate literature circulation
times. While retails with a smaller market scope adopt the NY strategy when the market
range is low, the competitive intensity is increasing, and this strategic choice is much less
likely. Therefore, when the retailer’s market capacity tends to be consistent, the firm chooses
the YY strategy in order to achieve equilibrium. From this point of view, retailers should
pay attention to the intensity of competition between the two enterprises to improve service
levels, increase market share, and finally achieve the effect of market revenue balance.
4.9 Discussion themain results
In this section, we discuss the main propositions in order to summarize the main insights.
Specifically, we investigate the role of blockchain service in document circulation time to
show the transparency features. In this study, we find the strategies in terms of market effect,
economic effect, service effect, service efficiency, and service value, respectively. Moreover,
we also briefly discuss the equilibrium results of equilibrium strategy under the manufacturer
provide service, the sensitivity of documents to circulation time, and the intensity of com-
petition, respectively. These results provide the solutions for strategy selection. The main
discussions are shown in below.
Firstly, from the perspective of market effects, the blockchain service increases the price
and quantity of products based on the changes in market size and documents circulation time.
Secondly, from the perspective of equilibrium, the equilibrium is the blockchain service
provided by all retailers or larger retails. This method helps to realize the consistency in
decision-making. Thirdly, from the perspective of the value of blockchain service, this study
shows that the firm needs to consider the necessity of document circulation time for the
intensity of the service. In addition, the boat is small enough to turn around. In other words,
smaller firm has a higher service efficiency, which reduces the influence of bloated structure
of large organizations. Moreover, two retailers bring a good consumption experience through
investing in blockchain technology. Finally, through the discussion of different conditions,
the main results are consistent with the basic discussion results. Therefore, the firm should
pay attention to the choice of strategies under different conditions to achieve a balanced result
in decision-making among enterprises.

5 Conclusions, management implications, theoretical implications,
and Future Research
5.1 Conclusion
The circulation time of documents will affect the efficiency of commercial activities. The
blockchain technology can increase the trust and speed of information flow in circulation
of documents through its transparency. However, blockchain service require financial sup-
port, especially since the firms of different sizes have different attitudes toward technology
provision. Therefore, this study discusses the influence of circulation time of documents
through the support of blockchain technology in order to find the optimal strategy from the
changes of document circulation time and market size of firms. Specifically, this paper con-
structs a game-theoretical model for competing retailers with different market size. The main
discussions are as follows.
Firstly, we consider that the market effect composed of product quantity and price in
order to find the optimal strategy. The result shows the changes in market effect supported
by blockchain technology are reasonable as the circulation time documents and the market
size of firms change.
Secondly, we consider the changes of economic effect. The result shows that the equi-
librium strategies are YY and NY. That means that the equilibrium is a blockchain service
provided by all retailers or larger retailers. Moreover, it is a good choice for small retailers to
provide blockchain services due to its higher efficiency. Surely, competitive retailers provide
the blockchain service, which improves the service experience of consumers and reduces the
loss of time value of circulation documents.
Finally, the study also investigates that the impact of manufacturer’s service provision
on retailers’ service strategies, time sensitivity, and competitive intensity, respectively. The
stable results are verified by a basic discussion.
5.2 Management implications
Commercial information is inseparable from the documental support. The value of infor-
mation can only be realized if the rapid circulation of relevant information is achieved.
Blockchain technology, as a new technology, supports the secure, trustworthy, and rapid cir-
culation of information through the feature of transparency and trust. Therefore, based on the
result of this study, we can provide some management implications to support the business
decision-marking.
Firstly, from the perspective of time value, the firm needs to consider the value of
blockchain over time changes. If the existing documents are in circulation for a longer period
of time, there is less need to adopt blockchain service due to the unobvious effect of time
variation. In other words, the blockchain service is a way to improve the service experience
in documental activities.
Secondly, from the perspective of multiple effects, the firm consider providing the
blockchain service in order to achieve a balance of benefits. Moreover, it also increases
the service experience for consumers. In addition, the small firms can actively play a role in
building blockchain service to satisfy a high-level efficient requirement.
Finally, from the perspective of competitive intensity, firm needs to consider the influence
of competitive intensity on the environment of blockchain service. In other words, this result
123
Annals of Operations Research
leads to a change in the timing of documental activities. This way helps to increase the
business efficiency and to obtain the equilibrium strategy from the economic effect.
5.3 Theoretical implications
In this study, we investigate the role of blockchain service in documental activities. Our study
extends the current body of knowledge. Specifically, on the one hand, we analyze the impact
of technological investments of blockchain service on asymmetric competition in the market
size. This result extends the application scope of blockchain service in the market. On the
other hand, we investigate the time value of blockchain service in documental activities.
Although the existing literature includes a discussion of time in supply chain management
(Astill et al., 2019; Choi, 2020b), there is no discussion of the impact of the time value of
blockchain service on technology investments. In addition, we construct a game-theoretical
model with the feature of blockchain service. Based on the above analysis, we can obtain the
optimal results to support the practice of using blockchain service in documental activities.
In summary, our study extends the current body of knowledge on blockchain service, market
competition, and way of documental transmission in the supply chains.
5.4 Future research
This study investigates the blockchain service provision solution for competing retailers
when the revenue is balanced. However, this study does not consider the influence of new
equilibrium when the both firms provide competing state blockchain service. In other words,
we can obtain the new results from the sequential game in order to find a new equilibrium.
Correspondingly, the new proposition is that it is conditional for firms with different sizes to
introduce blockchain services. This is a necessary condition to pay attention to the change
in the competitive intensity. Besides, our study does not consider the contracts to coordinate
business relationships. Correspondingly, the new proposition is that through the cooperation
of firms, they can obtain the optimal results in terms of competitive intensity and coordination
level in order to reduce the repetitive investments.
