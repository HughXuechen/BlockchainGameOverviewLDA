With the popularity of on-board intelligent devices, the number of vehicle computing intensive applications is also increasing
rapidly. Due to the high mobility and limited computing power of the vehicle, and the extensive and changing demand for
computing resources of the vehicle terminal, the vehicle often has insu�cient computing power. In order to meet the needs of
intensive computing applications of vehicle terminals, the computing tasks of vehicles can be unloaded to edge cloud servers
(ECSs) with rich resources and high performance to enhance the computing power of vehicle terminals. However, the resource
charge of ECS is high, and the scheme needs to consider such issues as ECS signal coverage, long task transmission delay caused by
network congestion, and insu�cient computing capacity of ECS.�erefore, this study considers unloading the computing tasks of
vehicles with insu�cient computing resources to nearby vehicles with redundant computing capacity and proposes a resource
scheduling method for the Internet of vehicles based on blockchain and game theory. �e scheduling of computing resources can
reduce the computing workload of buyers’ vehicles and improve the operation e�ciency of the whole vehicle network.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the Internet of things (IOT) [1–4] has
attracted great attention from academia and the industry. Its
applications in life can be seen everywhere, such as smart
phones, tablet computers, smart TVs, and smart vehicles. As
a key branch of the Internet of things, the Internet of vehicles
(IOV) [5–7] has also become a key research �eld and de-
velopment direction concerned by all walks of life. �e
vigorous development of the Internet of vehicles has a strong
foundation. It is safer, more environmentally friendly, and
more convenient to drive. Functionally speaking, it can
communicate and add more on-board entertainment, self-
diagnosis, and repair, which are the necessary conditions for
the realization of unmanned driving. On a deeper level, if the
Internet of vehicles is used to realize driverless, the car is not
only a vehicle, but also a mobile space. In addition, the
Internet of vehicles can also realize vehicle to everything
(V2X), where x can be an entity or nonentity [8, 9].
However, with the rapid development of the Internet of
vehicles, the data of the Internet of vehicles has also ex-
perienced a blowout growth in recent years [10–14]. Intel’s
Research Report on the amount of data used by Internet of
vehicles users a few years ago pointed out that, in 2020, the
amount of data used by a car that realizes automatic driving
will be 4000GB [15]. At the same time, in the face of the huge
and complicated number of vehicles and roads, plus the huge
number of sensors, the Internet of vehicles puts forward high
requirements for the processing delay of data tasks and
network bandwidth resources.
Although the resource scheduling of mobile vehicles in
IOV has many advantages, the current resource scheduling
scheme still has many problems [16]. Resource scheduling in
IOV is mainly conducted through vehicle to vehicle (V2V)
and vehicle to RSU (V2R). However, since V2V commu-
nication and V2R communication do not encrypt data,
malicious nodes can intercept or even tamper with com-
munication data in the process of data transmission [17]. On

the other hand, the information between entities partici-
pating in resource scheduling is opaque, RSUs located on the
roadside are vulnerable to external attacks, and there is a lack
of an effective trust mechanism between entities partici-
pating in resource scheduling. For the sake of privacy and
data security, vehicles may not be willing to participate in the
resource scheduling of IOV [18, 19]. Most importantly, there
is a lack of an efficient resource scheduling mechanism in
IOV, which can not meet the needs of the rapidly changing
IOV resource scheduling market. To sum up, the current
IOV resource scheduling including data sharing and com-
puting task unloading mainly faces the following three
challenges.
1.1. Unsafe Data Transmission. During the process of data
sharing and computing task unloading, the communication
node does not encrypt the data, so the data is easy to be
intercepted or even tampered by malicious nodes during
transmission, which poses a serious threat to the data se-
curity of IOV.
1.2. Low Efficiency of the Centralized Dispatching System.
In the traditional IOV, the resource scheduling between
vehicles is centrally controlled by the authority. Today, with
the increasing scale of IOV, the centralized scheduling time
and energy consumption are relatively large. On the other
hand, if the dispatching organization is attacked, large-scale
data leakage may occur, resulting in a series of uncontrol-
lable events.
1.3. Lack of Efficient Resource Scheduling Mechanism. &e
resource scheduling in IOV involves multiple entities in-
volved in scheduling, which makes the process of resource
scheduling very complex. &is requires us to design an ef-
ficient resource scheduling strategy for the two resource
scheduling scenarios of data sharing and computing task
unloading to meet the needs of the IOV resource scheduling
market.
In recent years, blockchain technology [20–23] has
developed rapidly. Due to its characteristics of decentral-
ization, anonymity, and trust, a large number of researchers
have done more and more research work on the combi-
nation of blockchain and Internet of vehicles from different
angles.
Blockchain is a chained data structure. Consensus nodes
package transaction records into blocks and link blocks to
the blockchain according to the time sequence of block
generation. In fact, blockchain can be regarded as a dis-
tributed database, which uses encryption technology to
ensure that data cannot be tampered with and forged. When
the distributed nodes share data, each node can verify the
validity of the transaction signature based on the public key
in the distributed network to ensure the authenticity of the
shared data. In addition, smart contract is also an important
technology in blockchain. It is a commitment in digital form,
including the specific algorithm to be executed and the
algorithm execution conditions. After the smart contract is
deployed, it will be automatically executed by computer
programs. &rough the smart contract blockchain, various
distributed applications can be supported to achieve more
complex functions. In addition, the blockchain will dis-
tribute digital currency rewards to the consensus nodes that
have obtained the bookkeeping right, which can motivate
the nodes to provide computing power and resources.
Blockchain can promote the establishment of a secure,
mutual trust, and decentralized intelligent transportation
network to solve the resource scheduling problem in IOV
and help make better use of transportation infrastructure
and resources.
2. System Model
We mainly study the mobile vehicle computing task
unloading problem in the resource scheduling of the In-
ternet of vehicles. At present, there are many researches on
mobile vehicle computing task unloading, but there are still
many problems in the existing schemes, such as vehicle
privacy and data leakage, low system operation efficiency,
inability to provide an effective incentive mechanism, and so
on. &erefore, we propose a scheme for mobile vehicle
computing task unloading and build a system framework
based on the alliance blockchain.
2.1. System Entities. Figure 1 is the model diagram of the
mobile vehicle computing task offloading system based on
the alliance blockchain [20–23] designed in this paper. &e
model mainly includes three classes of entities: trusted
Authority (TA), roadside unit (RSU), and mobile vehicles.
&e details of the functions of each entity in the system
are as follows.
2.1.1. Trusted Authority (TA). &e function of the TA is the
same as that of the TA introduced in Section 3.1, both of
which deal with the registration and authentication of en-
tities in the system and send a digital certificate, public key,
and private key to the entity to ensure the security of entity
data transmission.
2.1.2. Roadside Unit (RSU). In the system model, the RSU
acts as a vehicle computing task offloading agent responsible
for hosting and directing the auction process to handle
calculating resource scheduling problems. At the same time,
RSU is also the consensus node of the alliance blockchain. A
smart contract (Computation Offloading Smart Contract,
COSC) that controls the offloading of vehicle computing
tasks is deployed on the RSU. A copy of the alliance
blockchain is saved on each RSU. &ere are multiple RSUs
beside the road, and the coverage radius is defined as RSUR.
Similarly, all RSUs are carried out through communication
cables, and mobile vehicles can communicate with RSUs
through V2R wireless communication.
2.1.3. Mobile Vehicles. Mobile vehicles with compute-in-
tensive applications waiting to be offloaded act as buyers of
2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
computing resources. Vehicle users with idle computing
resources can be rented to buyers to act as computing re-
source suppliers, i.e., sellers. Vehicles can communicate with
the RSU through V2R, and the vehicles communicate
through V2V. �e vehicle also has a wallet for storing re-
source coins and a virtual identity for privacy protection.
As shown in the system model diagram in Figure 1, the
smart contract COSC divides each RSU and the mobile
vehicles within its communication range into a network
area according to the communication range RRSU of each
RSU, and the network area is named regional computation
o¥oading network (RCON). As the regional manager of an
RCON, each RSU manages the o¥oading of vehicle
computing tasks in the RCON and acts as a consensus node
of the alliance blockchain on the other hand. RSU will
package the transaction records into blocks and pass the
corresponding consensus mechanism to link the block to
the consortium blockchain. In addition, RCONs are con-
nected by cable, and the same is true between RCONsand
the edge server cloud, and they can all communicate with
each other. Vehicles can o¥oad computing tasks to other
vehicles with spare computing resources in the same
RCON through RSU scheduling or o¥oad computing tasks
to edge cloud servers through RSU. We focus on the case
where a vehicle o¥oads computational tasks to a nearby
moving vehicle.
2.2. Basic Assumptions of the Computing Task O�oading
Model. �e research on computing task o¥oading [24–26] of
mobile vehicles will be based on the following assumptions:
(1) First, consider the communication between model
entities. Figure 1 shows that wired communication
between RCONs and between RCONs and edge
cloud servers will be carried out through cables. �e
communication between them does not need to
consider the e§ect of communication range.
�e V2R communication between the RSU and the
vehicle is a§ected by the communication range
RSUR of the RSU. In contrast, the communication
between them does not need to consider the e§ect of
communication range. V2R communication be-
tween RSU and vehicle is a§ected by RSU’s com-
munication range RRSU. At the same time, only when
the reliability of data transmission can be guaranteed
by one-hop V2V connection the calculation o¥oad
can be performed between the two vehicles; other-
wise, there may be data loss during the transmission
process.
(2) We also assume that time is time-slotted and studies
the computing task o¥oading strategy of moving
vehicles in a speci�c period.
(3) Assuming there is a lack of information in the
computing task o¥oading market, the RSU and
buyer cannot know the seller’s bid, and the seller
cannot know the bids of other sellers. RSU manages
the computing task o¥oading market through the
smart contract COSC of the alliance blockchain. RSU
will not favor any buyer or seller, nor can it refuse to
help any vehicle that wants to participate in com-
puting task o¥oading. In addition, due to the

characteristics of the consortium blockchain system,
various entities cannot collude with each other.
(4) In the process of computing task offloading, one
buyer can only uninstall its application to one seller,
but one seller can provide services for multiple
buyers. At the same time, since the computing task
offloading scheme proposed applies to all RCONs, to
simplify the discussion, in the follow-up work, we
will take an RCON as an example to study com-
puting task offloading.
(5) It is assumed that a computing task can be divided
into a computing program with fixed data size. &is
computing program is the smallest unit of com-
puting task division.
3. The Specific Process of Computing
Task Offloading
&e particular process of vehicle computing task offloading
is shown as follows.
3.1. SystemInitialization. All entities must be registered with
TA and submit a certain amount of resource coins as a
deposit to the account under the supervision of TA. &en
download the latest data information from the nearby al-
liance blockchain nodes’ storage pool to synchronize the
entity system’s state, which will not be repeated here.
3.2. Both Buyers and Sellers Submit Relevant Information to
RSU. In RCON, buyers and sellers of vehicles who intend
to participate in the offloading of computing tasks will
submit relevant information to RSU. &e information
submitted by the buyer’s vehicle bi can be described by
vector Ibi
� signB
i , di, vB
i , lBi􏼈 􏼉, where signB
i marks the vehicle
bi as the buyer.&at is, it needs external computing resources
to unload its intensive computing tasks, di is the data
amount of computing tasks that need to be unloaded by
vehicle bi, and vB
i and lBi are the current speed and position of
vehicle bi; on the other hand, the information vector sub-
mitted by the seller’s vehicle sj can be expressed as
Isj
� signS
j , cj, vS
j, lSj , pj, rj􏽮 􏽯, where signS
j represents that the
vehicle sj is the seller. &at is, the vehicle sj has redundant
computing resources and is willing to provide computing
task offloading services for other vehicles, cj is the com-
puting power of the vehicle sj, described by the number of
CPU cycles per second of the vehicle, vS
j and lSj are the
current speed and position of the vehicle sj, and pj is the bid
of the vehicle sj to process the application data of one
computing task. rj represents the idle computing resources
of vehicle sj virtualized as resource blocks (CPU cycles).
In addition, it should be noted that all buyers and sellers
participating in the offloading of computing tasks are within
the communication range RRSU of RSU. &erefore, their
information can be sent to RSU through V2R. At the same
time, it is assumed that the RCON contains n buyers B �
b1, b2, . . . , bn􏼈 􏼉 and m sellers S � s1, S2, . . . , sm􏼈 􏼉; these ve-
hicles have the same communication range RV.
3.3. RSU Calculates the Scheduling Results and Publishes the
Results toBothBuyers andSellers. After receiving the relevant
information about the buyer’s vehicle and the seller’s vehicle,
the RSU will extract and integrate the information, and then
according to the reverse auction mechanism proposed in this
chapter, the RSU will match buyers and sellers and send the
best match results back to buyers and sellers.
3.4. Unloading and Payment of Computing Tasks. After re-
ceiving the scheduling result of RSU, the buyer’s vehicle will
directly unload the computing task to the seller’s vehicle
through one-hop V2V. After the seller’s vehicle completes the
calculation, it will return the calculation result to the buyer.
Since the data size of the application result ismuch smaller than
the input data, the result feedback delay can be further ignored.
After the buyer confirms the receipt of the calculation
result, the buyer will forward a resource currency to the
corresponding seller’s vehicle through its wallet as the cost of
unloading the calculation task. At the same time, the buyer
sends a transaction completion message to the RSU. When
the seller receives the fee, a transaction completion message
will also be sent to RSU, which represents that the trans-
action has been completed. &e transaction record will be
placed in the RSU memory pool and broadcast to the entire
network, waiting to be added to the block.
If there is any objection between the buyer and the seller
during the transaction, for example, the buyer has not received
the calculation result, the seller has not received the corre-
sponding fee, etc., the objecting party can file a complaint with
RSU, and RSU initiates verification of data transmission and
wallet payment in the inspection network. For vehicles with
cheating, RSU will deduct a part of the security deposit for the
vehicle. &is mechanism can restrain some vehicles from
doing damage to the interests of other vehicles for their own
interests during the unloading process of computing tasks and
ensure the stability of the system operation.
3.5. Blocks Are Generated and Linked to the Blockchain.
When generating the blockchain, this chapter proposes a
new consensus mechanism based on the total amount of
buyer computing task data received by all sellers in the
RCON managed by each RSU node to elect the accounting
node (Proof of Computation Resource, POCR). &e RSU
with the most significant amount of buyer computing tasks
received by all sellers in the RCON area is elected as the
accounting node within a block generation interval.
It should be noted that when an RSU successfully obtains
the accounting right and generates a block link to the
blockchain, the system will also distribute a certain amount
of resource coins to it as a reward. RSU will distribute re-
source coins proportionally to the seller as a reward
according to the contribution of the seller’s vehicle’s com-
puting resources in the process of computing task offloading
to encourage them to continue to participate in computing
tasks offloading. &at is, the POCR consensus mechanism
uses the total amount of buyer computing task data received
by the seller to measure the seller’s computing resource
contribution.
4 Mathematical Problems in Engineering
4. Modeling and Solution
4.1. Modeling of the Reverse Auction Scheme. Consider a
computing task offloading scenario in an RCON. Since there
are multiple buyers and sellers in the RCON, buyers will
compete for the seller’s computing resources to complete
computing tasks faster. &erefore, this chapter will use the
reverse auction method to match buyers and sellers to obtain
the matching result that maximizes regional benefits. &e
actual meaning of the important parameters involved in the
auction scheme is shown in Table 1.
Consider first the benefits of offloading the buyer’s
computing tasks. Since each seller’s computing power is
different, the utility benefits provided by each seller to the
buyer are different. &e benefit that the buyer bi can get by
offloading the unit calculation data to the seller sj can be
expressed by the following function:
φij �
δ
cEC
+
1
TEC
+ θ􏼠 􏼡 −
δ
cj
+
1
Tij
􏼠 􏼡. (1)
In formula (1), (δ/cEC + 1/TEC + θ) represents the time
for the buyer ib to offload the unit computing task to the
edge cloud server ECS, δ is the mapping of bits to CPU
cycles, CEC is the computing power of the edge cloud server,
TEC is the data transfer rate between the vehicle and the ECS,
θ is the response delay due to network congestion or in-
sufficient ECS performance, δ/cj + 1/Tij represents the time
for the buyer bi to offload the unit computing task to the
seller sj, and Tij represents the data transmission speed
between the buyer bi and the seller sj.
To sum up, the time saved by the buyer bi offloading
the unit computing task data to the seller sj compared to
the time saved by the buyer bi offloading the unit com-
puting task to the edge cloud server is the unit benefit of
the buyer bi.
Next, consider the overall benefit of RCON. For n buyers
set B � b1, b2, . . . , bn􏼈 􏼉 andm seller set S � S1, S2, . . . , Sm􏼈 􏼉 in
RCON, the buyer’s demand vector is D � d1, d2, . . . , dn􏼈 􏼉,
and the seller’s bidding vector for unit resources is
P � p1, p2, . . . , pm􏼈 􏼉. Use Rbi to denote a seller within the
coverage of the buyer’s bi communication. Use Rsj to rep-
resent buyers who are within the seller’s sj communication
coverage. &en, in a time slot, through the calculation and
offloading of buyers and sellers, the overall regional benefit
that RCON can obtain can be expressed as

(2)
Here, ηij is used to the nature of the task of calibrating
the buyer bi to the winning seller sj. When ηij � 1, the buyer
bi can unload its application data to the seller sj through a
one-hop V2V communication; otherwise, it cannot be
uninstalled. For example, when the seller sj is not within the
communication coverage of the buyer bi, or the seller sj has
exhausted its idle computing resources, the situation of ηij �
0 will occur. dij represents the amount of task data unloaded
by the buyer bi to the seller sj. λi is used to adjust the ex-
pected revenue of the buyer bi unloading unit data. When
the importance of the calculation task or the timeliness
requirement is high, the value of λi is larger; this represents
that the buyers are willing to pay a higher price to complete
the current computing task faster.
Here, the limited value of constraint ηij ∈ 0, 1{ } can only
be 0 or 1; that is, the unloading of computing tasks from
buyer bi to seller js has only two states of success and failure;

workload offloaded from the buyer from exceeding the
computing resources that the seller can provide;
dij � min(dij,ΔtijTij) determines the actual uninstall data
from buyer bi to seller sj based on the smaller value between
the two data, where Δtij represents the real transmission
time of the buyer bi offloading the computing task to the
seller sj.
4.2. Reverse Auction Solution Schemes. We will use the re-
verse auction method to solve the proposed computing task
offloading problem and, at the same time, prove the au-
thenticity of the seller’s bid and the individual’s rationality to
verify the proposed scheme’s rationality.
First, define a list of preferred options from the per-
spective of the administrator RSU and the buyer, re-
spectively. For the auction manager RSU in RCON,
according to the size of the value of formula (3), a list of its
preference schemes is defined, and the list can be
expressed by formula (4):

where > RSU in formula (4) means that RSU is biased to
match the buyer bi with the seller sj, rather than matching
the buyer bi with other sellers within its communication
range; because scheme (bi, sj) can bring more benefits to
RSU than other schemes, it maximizes the regional benefit of
RCON.
Next, define a list of preferred options from the buyer’s
perspective. Also, according to the value of formula (3), the
list of buyer’s preference schemes defined here is
Lbi
� sj > bi
sk􏼐 􏼑􏼑|sj, Sk ∈ R
bi 􏽯, (5)
where > bi
in formula (5) means that the buyer bi prefers to
match the seller sj rather than other sellers within its
communication range, because the scheme (bi, sj) can make
the buyer bi obtain the maximum benefit.
In the following, the lists LRSU and Lbi
are sorted in
descending order according to the value of formula (3). At
the same time, a virtual seller sj
′ is added at the end of the list
Lbi
as a critical indicator for the following algorithm to use.
&e virtual seller sj
′ corresponds to the scheme of offloading
computing tasks to ECS. &e buyer bi unloads the unit
computing task revenue set to ωi � (λiφij − pEC)dij, where
PEC refers to the unit computing resources ECS price. Here,
we consider that all sellers’ vehicle bids are lower than PEC,
so sellers can attract buyers to offload computing tasks. &e
value ofωi is smaller than (λiφij − pj)dij for all real solutions
in the list Lbi
. If no seller in the listing Lbi
wins the auction,
the buyer bi offloads its computation to ECS. On the other
hand, when (λiφij − pj)dij ≤ 0, it means that the buyer bi
cannot benefit from the offloading of computing tasks. At
this time, ηij � 0, the buyer bi will not offload computing
tasks to the seller sj.
&e reverse auction scheme proposed here consists of
two parts, first, to determine the matching scheme of all
buyers and sellers and, then, to determine the actual amount
that the buyer should pay to the seller. In the matching
process, the list LRSU plays a leading role; that is, the scheme
will prioritize the matching scheme that can maximize the
regional benefit in the actual operation process, although
this may sacrifice the interests of some buyers.
&e auction algorithm is divided into three parts. &e
first is to set the algorithm’s parameters, create lists LRSU and
Lbi
, and sort the two lists in descending order according to
the size of the (λiφij − pEC)dij value. &is is followed by the
matching phase, where buyers are matched with suitable
sellers in the case of maximizing regional interest, based on
listing LRSU, until all buyers are matched, or sellers run out of
free resources.
&e last is the payment stage. For the matching scheme
(bi, sj), after determining the actual payment amount psj
that the buyer bi should pay to the seller sj, the next seller 􏽢sj
of sj in the list Lbi
is selected as the critical reference payment
indicator. At this time, the payment amount psj
can be
expressed as

When the seller 􏽢sj is the last seller on the list Lbi
, the seller
􏽢sj is the virtual seller sj
′ at this time; we make
(λi􏽢φij − 􏽢pj)
􏽢dij � ωi � (λiφij − pEC)dij.
&is scheme includes n buyers and m sellers. So, the
computational complexity of auction is O(n2m2). &e
complexity of the algorithm is low, and the convergence can
be achieved in a short time even when the scale of the vehicle
network is large.
4.3. Consortium Blockchain RewardModeling. In generating
the consortium blockchain, the RSU as the consensus node
will compete for the accounting right through the POCR
consensus mechanism proposed above. &e RSU that has
obtained the accounting right can not only package the
transaction records into blocks and link them to the
blockchain but also be rewarded with resource coins dis-
tributed by the blockchain system. After RSU is rewarded
with resource coins, it will distribute resource coins to sellers
according to the ratio of the total amount of computing task
data unloaded by buyers within a block generation interval
to the total amount received by all sellers in RSU. Here, the
total amount of buyer computing task data received by the
seller is used to measure the computing resource contri-
bution of the seller.
&e generation of new blocks in the POCR consensus
mechanism includes three stages: mining, consensus, and
distribution of rewards. In this chapter, “mining” refers to
how sellers provide computing resources to buyers for
buyers to offload computing tasks. After the “mining”
process, the system counts the buyers received by all sellers
in the RCON area managed by each RSU. &e total amount
of unloaded computing task data and the RSU with the
largest total amount are elected as the accounting node.
&e next step is to enter the “consensus” stage. At this
time, the accounting node packages part of the computing
task by offloading records into a block and sending them to
other RSU nodes for verification. After the verification is
passed, the accounting node links the block to the block-
chain. Next, in the “Distribute Rewards” stage, the system
will distribute a certain amount of resource coins to the
accounting node RSU as a reward. After RSU receives the
resource currency distributed by the system, it will distribute
resource currency rewards to each seller according to the
number of computing resources contributed by each seller in
RCON under its control to encourage sellers to continue to
participate in computing resource scheduling.
&e actual meanings of the important parameters are
shown in Table 2.
&e blockchain “distribute rewards” phase is modeled
below. Assuming that there are z RCON areas in the current
system, there are z consensus nodes RSU, the number of
sellers’ vehicles in the RSU numbered k, k ∈ [1, z], is mk, the
seller numbered j, j ∈ [1, mk], in the RCON corresponding
to this RSU at the amount of buyer calculation task data

probabilities of all RSUs being successfully elected as ac-
counting nodes is 1. After RSU obtains the accounting rights
and generates a block, it will immediately propagate the
block on the network for verification to complete the
consensus process. If the propagation and verification time is
too long, the mined block becomes an orphan block and is
abandoned by the blockchain. Here, the propagation delay of
RSU number k as a “miner” is set to τP
k � εk/c · μ, where ϵk is
the number of transactions in a block, c is a parameter
related to network size, and μ is the average effective channel
capacity per link. Since the verification of transactions re-
quires a fixed amount of computation, this period is assumed
to be linear with the number of transactions in the block;
then this period can be expressed as τv
k � κ∗εk, where κ is a
parameter determined by the size of the network and the
average verification speed of nodes. Considering that the
generation of new blocks follows a Poisson process, the
probability that a block generated by a “miner” RSUk is
orphaned is approximate as
Po εk( 􏼁 � 1 − e
− λ εk/cμ( )+κεk( ). (8)

coins, the reward obtained by generating a block with a
transaction volume of εk is rεk. &en the benefit function of

At this point, the blockchain reward model is estab-
lished. In the next section, we will analyze the system’s
performance through simulation.
5. Case Study
Here we will evaluate the performance of the proposed
Internet of vehicles resource scheduling based on blockchain
and game theory through simulation. First, we compare the
proposed auction scheme with several types of baseline
schemes to verify the scheme’s performance. Second, we
conduct a simulation evaluation of the blockchain reward
model to verify its effectiveness.
5.1. Simulation Setting. Since the calculation task offloading
scheme using the reverse auction method applies to all
RCONs, to simplify the discussion, we will first use an
RCON as an example to conduct a simulation study on the
reverse auction scheme. We use MATLAB2016A as the
platform to simulate RCON with a network area of
500m∗ 500m, in which there are 5 roads in the east-west
and north-south directions, and each road has 4 lanes. In
RCON, an RSU is set up as the central broker, hosting and
directing the auction process. On the other hand, this
chapter also uses the blockchain open-source framework
Hyperledger Fabric to write smart contracts to simulate the
consortium blockchain system.
To evaluate the performance of the reverse auction
scheme, the mobile vehicle computation offloading scheme
based on consortium clockchain (scheme 0) is compared

with the following baseline schemes to evaluate the per-
formance of scheme 0:
(1) &e fastest process scheme (scheme 1): in this
scheme, assuming all sellers bid reasonably, buyers
are always matched with the seller who can complete
the application and calculate the offload fastest. If
this seller runs out of idle resources, the buyer will be
forced to find another seller for fast processing or
offload computing tasks to edge cloud servers.
(2) &e lowest cost scheme (scheme 2): in this scheme,
assuming that all sellers bid reasonably, buyers are
always matched with the seller with the lowest asking
price per unit calculation task. Similarly, when sellers
run out of idle resources, buyers will be forced to find
another low-priced seller or offload computing tasks
to edge cloud servers.
(3) First-come-first-served service (scheme 3): in this
scheme, assuming that all sellers make reasonable
bids, the buyer is always matched with the first seller
to provide an offer. If this seller runs out of idle
resources, the buyer will be forced to offload com-
puting tasks to the edge cloud. Since the vehicles are
randomly distributed in the simulation area, FCFS
can be regarded as a random unloading scheme.
(4) Offload to edge cloud scheme (scheme 4): buyers
directly offload their computing tasks to edge cloud
servers for processing.
In addition, for the proposed scheme, the function σj �
acj + e is used here to represent the most reasonable bid of
the buyer sj, where a and e are positive constants, and these
two constants follow the unloading law of the market
economy, which means that the buyer sj provides that the
more the computing power, the greater the reasonable bid.
&e settings of the relevant simulation parameters are shown
in Table 3.
5.2. Simulation Analysis
5.2.1. Vehicle Density Analysis. We first analyze the impact
of vehicle density within the RCON region on the overall
benefit U(ηij) of the region and on the average computing
time of a single computing program (assuming that the
computing task can be divided into computing programs
with a fixed data size).
In the case of low and high vehicle flow levels, we
simulated the scheme 50 times with different parameter
values. We obtained the average value to cover various traffic
conditions, making the conclusion more general.
Figures 2–5 show the changes of the average calculation
time of a single calculation program and the regional overall
benefit U(ηij) with the number of sellers under low vehicle
density (18 buyers and 22 buyers).
According to Figure 2 of Figure 3, we find that the
average computing time of a single computing program in
scheme 4 is always the highest. &is is because when it is
offloaded to the edge cloud, the edge cloud receives toomany
requests, resulting in that it cannot process the task of vehicle
unloading in time, which causes a large delay in unloading.
&e calculation time of a single calculation program of
scheme 2 and scheme 3 gradually decreases with the increase
of sellers because the buyer has more options at this time,
and the buyer’s task can be uninstalled faster. But these two
schemes are still less efficient than scheme 0 and scheme 1.
For scheme 0 and scheme 1 solutions, with the increase in
the number of sellers, the computing resources are gradually
sufficient, and the completion time of the unit calculation
program gradually decreases. &e performance of scheme 0
is close to scheme 1 of the fastest processing scheme, which
reflects the superiority of the time performance of scheme 0.
According to Figures 4 and 5, it is found that, with the
increase of the number of sellers, the overall regional benefit
U(ηij) of all schemes increases because with the rise in the
number of sellers, more buyers can enjoy the calculation
service and eventually reach relative stability where most
buyers can be successfully matched to the right seller. At the
same time, we found that, under low vehicle density, the
U(ηij) value of scheme 0 is higher than other schemes, the
buyer’s cost of scheme 1 is higher, and scheme 2 time cost is
higher. However, the randomness of scheme 3 is high, and
the performance level of these schemes is not high, which
shows that scheme 0 can reasonably match buyers and sellers
and maximize the regional benefits of RCON.
Figures 6–9 show the changes of the average calculation
time of a single calculation program and the regional overall
benefit U(ηij) with the number of sellers under higher
vehicle density (38 buyers and 42 buyers).
It can be seen from Figures 6 and 7 that the average
calculation time of a single calculation program of scheme 4
is always the highest for the same reason as in the low flow
case. For scheme 3 and scheme 2, the curve decreases slightly
as more buyers access computing services as sellers increase.
Likewise, the performance of scheme 0 is close to the time-
optimal scheme 1, which verifies the superiority of the
temporal performance of scheme 0. At the same time, the
average calculation time of a single calculation program for
scheme 0, scheme 3, scheme 2, and scheme 1 decreased
compared to the low-traffic case; as buyers had more

offloading options at higher vehicle densities, the processing
time of its task will be shortened.
Figures 8 and 9 compare the U(ηij) values under each
scheme. Considering various factors, the efficiency of
scheme 0 maintains the highest level among multiple
schemes. At the same time, compared with low-traffic
scenarios, due to the increase in the number of vehicles, the
total amount of unloading tasks increases, and the total
regional benefit also increases.
To sum up, when considering the scenarios of low and
high traffic flow, it can be seen that scheme 0 proposed in this
chapter has a relatively high performance in the two per-
formance indicators of task processing efficiency and overall
regional benefit. &is proves that the proposed reverse
auction scheme can effectively match buyers and sellers.
5.2.2. Verification of the Authenticity of the Seller’s Bid and
the Rationality of the Individual. Here we will verify the
authenticity and individual rationality of the seller’s bids
proposed. To verify the authenticity of the seller’s bid, we
simulate the behavior of the randomly selected seller Srandom
in reasonable and other unreasonable bids and calculate the
graph of the seller’s Srandom revenue changing with its bid, as
shown in Figure 10.
As shown in Figure 10, when the seller’s Srandom bid is less
than its reasonable bid, the seller’s Srandom can never get the
maximum benefit. On the other hand, when the seller’s bid
reaches a reasonable price, the benefit of the seller’s Srandom is
maximized. Even if the seller’s bid is greater than the rea-
sonable price, its benefit will not increase. &erefore, it can
be proved that the seller will provide a reasonable price to the
buyer according to the computing resources and will not
provide other quotes; that is, the seller’s bid is authentic.
6. Conclusions
With the rapid development of the automotive industry,
vehicles equipped with a variety of intelligent on-board
equipment needmore andmore resources. On the one hand,
a large number of driving data will be generated during the
driving process of vehicles, which are useful in traffic sit-
uation analysis, automatic driving training, and other sce-
narios. On the other hand, due to the high mobility of
vehicles and because their own computing resources are
limited and the real-time distribution of computing re-
sources is irregular, it is easy to see that some vehicles have
insufficient computing resources while others have spare
computing resources.
&rough the scheduling of mobile vehicle data and
computing resources, the data and computing resources can
be shared to the subjects who need them, and both parties
involved in the sharing can benefit. For the resource
scheduling of Internet of vehicles based on blockchain and
game theory, this paper proposes a mobile vehicle com-
puting task unloading scheme based on alliance blockchain.
In the simulation phase, the performance of the calculated
unloading scheme and several baseline schemes under
different traffic flows is compared. &e results show that the
scheme in this paper has better performance than other
schemes.
&is research work still has many places that can be
improved. For example, for the scheduling of data resources,
artificial intelligence technology, big data, and other tech-
nologies can be used to filter vehicle data, reduce the pro-
portion of duplicate or useless data in shared data, and
improve the efficiency of data sharing. For the scheduling of
computing resources, computing tasks can be unloaded to
the edge cloud server and the surrounding mobile vehicles at
the same time. How to reasonably control the amount of
tasks unloaded to the edge cloud and mobile vehicles is also
worth studying in the future.
