Abstract. In production cyber physical systems robots perform most operations.
On the way to Industry 4.0 robots have to be automated and perform operation
in coalition to reach common goals. The paper describes an approach to dynamic
formation of coalitions of autonomous robots based on the integration of fuzzy
cooperative games and smart contracts. Each robot is viewed as an agent, nego-
tiating and bidding with others during the coalition forming for distribution of
joint winnings. It is necessary to find combination of robots in way to maximize
efficiency of joint work, while the efficiency of the entire coalition is unknown
beforehand. A cooperative game with fuzzy core is used to form a coalition of
robots allowing coordinating the actions of individual members to achieve a com-
mon goal, as well as to evaluate and distribute the overall benefit. To implement
the negotiation process and record the composition of the coalition and the respon-
sibilities of individual participants, it is proposed to use the smart contract tech-
nology, which now become a part of the blockchain technology. Smart contracts
are proposed to be used as entity holding requirements and expected winnings
of each participant in the immutable structure of a blockchain network. The final
agreement can also be stored by all participants in form of smart contract that
contains the distribution coefficients of the winnings given all the conditions of
participation in the coalition. The availability of smart contracts to all participants
in the coalition makes it possible to ensure joint control over the fulfillment of the
task assigned to the coalition.

1 Introduction
The development of robots for production cyber-physical systems has reached a level
where it is highly important to organize their joint work. The coalition is viewed as
the most effective form of joint work organization [1]. Robots in swarms or flocks are
limited in actions by strong rules and actions of nearest neighbors. In contrast, robots

Robot Coalition Formation Based on Fuzzy Cooperative Games 347
in coalitions calculate next steps based on the common goal reaching according to the
current coalition state and set of alternatives provided by norms of coalition. Existing
models of task solving in coalition define that a robot can receive a reward for the
successful problem solving according to its contribution. The independency of robots
makes it important to develop an approach to organize coalition formation and interaction
between robots for making joint decision during joint problem solving.
Usually production cyber ephysical systems consist of independent robots with dif-
ferent equipment and software that can perform various tasks and expect different levels
of reward [2]. In case of production system, the reward is introduced as measure of robot
contribution to the success of production and viewed as way to “motivate” robot in doing
actions. It is important to consider the heterogeneity and provide common model to con-
sensus reaching during task decomposition and resolving. Each robot is an independent
agent with own competencies and goals. The coalition can be considered then as a union
of such an agents, which through the negotiation make a decision on a joint solution of
the production problem and the distribution of the reward.
The coalition is characterized by dynamic nature and implies a change in its struc-
ture, depending on changes in the conditions of the problem being solved. New robots
should be quickly familiarized with the current state of the problem solution and pro-
vide description of own competences to help to solve the problem. At the same time,
existing coalition members should operate without any changes according to the plan.
This problem is usually solved by external or internal knowledge bases for storing the
history of interaction between coalition members [3, 4].
Most of the existing approaches to coalition formation are characterized by the expo-
nential nature of the computations and communications complexity. To reduce complex-
ity to polynomial the number of agents in one coalition, the number of coalitions, and
the rationality of agents are usually limited [5]. The additional complexity is caused by
the inability to accurately estimate the size of the gain received after problem solving,
which introduces fuzziness into the formulation of the problem.
To solve the problems described above this paper proposes to use the cooperative
games with fuzzy core to form a coalition of robots. This model provides the following
advantages: robots share own competencies and their expected individual benefit while
coalition actions are controlled by one of its member with calculated coalition core. The
core coordinates the actions of individual members to achieve a common goal, as well
as to evaluate and distribute the overall benefit. The change of environmental conditions
leads to a dynamic change in the composition of the coalition, if necessary. A negotiation
algorithmand architecture of robot interaction frameworkhas beendeveloped in previous
work by the authors [6]. In this paper, it is proposed to use of blockchain technology to
store and process fuzzy coalition game’s rules for robot negotiation during the coalition
formation.
To store the game rules, competencies and requirements of robots, as well as infor-
mation about the current state of coalitions and tasks, smart contracts over blockchain
technology are used. With smart contracts, two types of the rules are defined: (i) for
forming a coalition, and (ii) for changing the composition of the coalition, defined with
the theory of fuzzy sets. Smart contracts and the current state of the problem solution,
are stored in the blockchain.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related work is revised in the following
section. A fuzzy cooperative game (FCG) model with core is described in Sect. 3. In
Sect. 4, different criteria of dynamic robot coalition formation are analyzed. Finally, the
implementation scheme of a FCG over blockchain-based smart contracts is proposed
following by conclusions.
2 Related Work
The cooperative nature of modern robotic complexes in production cyber-physical sys-
tems causes necessity of considering themwithin the context of cooperative game theory
in order tomodel and understand their cooperative behavior. Themain questions of coali-
tion formation are: what coalitions will be formed, how the common winnings will be
distributed among members and if the obtained coalition structure is stable. Once coali-
tions are formed and they have a feasible set of payoffs available to its members, the
question is the identification of final payoffs awarded to each player. That is, given a col-
lection of feasible sets of payoffs, one for each coalition, can one predict or recommend
a payoff (or set of payoffs) to be awarded to each player?
The payoff distribution should guarantee the stability of the coalition structure when
no one player has an intention to leave a coalition because of the expectation to increase
its payoff. The benefit distribution among the coalition members has proved to be fuzzy,
uncertain, and ambiguous [7]. Using the theory of fuzzy cooperative games (FCGs), the
uncertainty is processed by means of the introduction of a fuzzy benefit concept through
the bargaining process to the conclusion about the corresponding fuzzy distribution of
individual benefits among the coalition members [8].
The predictions or recommendations of payment distribution are embodied in differ-
ent solution concepts. According to [9], cooperative games are divided into two classes
based on the way a solution is obtained: games with a solution set and games with a
single solution. Games with core considered in this paper, belong to the former class and
represent a mechanism for analyzing the possible set of stable outcomes of cooperative
games with transferable utilities [10]. The concept of a core tends to maximize the sum
of coalition utilities in the particular coalition structure (C-stable coalition). The core of
a game with respect to a given coalition structure is defined as a set of such imputations
that prevent the players from forming small coalitions by paying off all the subsets an
amount, which is at least as much they would get if they form a coalition. Thus the core
of a game is a set of imputations which are stable.
The drawbacks of the core is that, on the one hand, the computational complexity
of finding the optimal structure is high since for the game with n players at least 2n − 1
of the total nn/2 coalition structures should be tested. On the other hand, for particular
classes of the game a core can be empty. Because of these problems, using the C-stable
coalition structures was quite unpopular in practical applications [11] and only recently
has attracted more attention of the researchers, when the concept of fuzzy cooperative
games with core was introduced [12, 13]. For realistic applications like collaborative
work of groups of robots, additive environments and the absence of the restrictions on
the type of membership functions should be considered [14].
Robot Coalition Formation Based on Fuzzy Cooperative Games 349
With regard to the organization of robots interaction, the blockchain ismostly used as
immutable storage for information exchange and platform for smart contracts. Informa-
tion stored in the blockchain could contain records about task and consumables distribu-
tion [15, 16], smart contracts and reward transactions [17], as well as global knowledge
about coalition previous actions [18]. In combinationwith cooperative games blockchain
technology can provide more trust for communication between robots, due to the storing
information about transactions in immutable log that can be verified by every coali-
tion participant. In contrary to existing approaches, blockchain does not require central
authority that provide trust for all nodes. All nodes negotiate with each other coming to
consensus with one of possible mechanisms: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, or practical
byzantine fault tolerance [19].
The combination of the peer-to-peer network and the cryptographic algorithms used
in blockchain technology allow for a negotiation process and consensus buildingwithout
any controlling authorities. Blockchain had already been used in swarm robotics to store
global knowledge about swarm actions [18]. The availability of a distributed transaction
ledger also allows new robots to join the swarm and gain all the knowledge prior to the
moment of inclusion by downloading and analyzing the transaction history.
3 Fuzzy Cooperative Game Model with Core
A generalized model of a fuzzy cooperative game (FCG) with core was proposed in
[14, 20, 21]. As shown in [14], the concept of a core tends to maximize the sum of
coalition utilities in the particular coalition structure. The core of a game is a set of
imputations, which are stable. The proposed model helped solving the problems of the
computational complexity of finding the optimal structure and of the empty core, which
enabled its use in practical applications of selecting robots in coalitions.
A FCG is defined as a pair (Robot, w), where Robot is nonempty and finite set of
players, subsets of Robot joining together to fulfil some task Ti are called coalitions K,
and w is called a characteristic function of the game, being w : 2n → �+ a mapping
connecting every coalition K ⊂ Robot with a fuzzy quantity w(K ) ∈ �+, with a
membership function μK : R → [0, 1]. A modal value of w(K ) corresponds to the
characteristic function of the crisp game v(K ): maxμK (w(K )) = μK (ν(K )). For an
empty coalition w(∅) = 0. A fuzzy core for the game (Robot, w) with the imputation
X = (
xi j
)
i∈I, j∈Robot ∈ �+ is a fuzzy subset CF of �+:

where xi j is the fuzzy payment of a robot j participating in a coalition i , i =
1, 2, . . . , I, j = 1, 2, . . . , N , k̄ = [K1, K2, . . . , Kl ] is the ordered structure of
effective coalitions; ϕ is a fuzzy partial order relation with a membership function
ν f =: R × R → [0, 1], and ϕi j is a binary variable such that:
ϕi j =
{
1, i f robot j participates in a coali tion i;
0, otherwise.
350 A. Smirnov et al.
The ϕi j is considered here as a result of some robot’s strategy on joining a coalition.
A fuzzy partial order relation is defined as follows (for more details see [22]). Let
a, b be fuzzy numbers with membership functions μa and μb respectively, then the
possibility of partial order aφ = b is defined as νφ = (a, b) ∈ [0, 1] as follows:
νφ = (a, b) = sup
x, y ∈ R
x ≥ y
(min(μa(x), μb(y))). (2)
The core CF is the set of possible distributions of the total payment achievable by
the coalitions, and none of coalitions can offer to its members more than they can obtain
accepting some imputation from the core. The first argument of the core CF indicates
that the payments for the grand coalition are less than the characteristic function of the
game. The second argument reflects the property of group rationality of the players,
that there is no other payoff vector, which yields more to each player. The membership
function μCF : R → [0, 1], is defined as:
μCF (x) = min

The solution of a cooperative game is a coalition configuration (S, x)which consists
of (i) a partition S of Robot , the so-called coalition structure, and (ii) an efficient payoff
distribution x which assigns each robot in Robot its payoff out of the utility of the
coalition it is member of in a given coalition structure S. A coalition configuration (S, x)
is called stable if no robot has an incentive to leave its coalition in S due to its assigned
payoff xi.
It was proved that the fuzzy set of coalition structures forming the game core rep-
resents a subset of the fuzzy set formed by the structure of effective coalitions. In turn,
this inference allows us to specify the upper possibility bound for the core, which is
a very important condition for the process of solution searching, because in this case,
the presence of a solution that meets the efficiency condition may serve as the signal to
terminate the search algorithm [21].
The game purpose is to generate an effective structure of robot coalitions for execut-
ing some production task. In turn, the generated structure of robot coalitions represents
the optimal configuration of the grand coalition. Individual robots use the technique
of nonlinear fuzzy regression to estimate the parameters of utility functions for their
payments [23]. A “coalition robot” is enabled for constructing membership functions
(MF) of coalitions and generating the game core (fuzzy-number generator). The sum
operation is based on Zadeh extension principle [22] for fuzzy numbers a and b (which
are convex sets normalized in R):
μa(∗)b(Z) = supz=x∗y min(μa(x), μb(y)) (4)
where * can designate the sum ⊕ or the product • of fuzzy numbers. Each fuzzy set is
decomposed into two segments, a non-decreasing and non-increasing one. The operation
* is performed for every group of n segments (one segment for each fuzzy set) that belong
to the same class (non-decreasing or non-increasing one). Thus, a fuzzy set is generated
for every group of n segments.

4 Criteria for FCG in Dynamic Robot Coalition Formation
Group problem solving in cyberphysical production systems requires a well-coordinated
interaction of the participants’ actions during the coalition formation for production task.
Regardless of the coalition model used, its formation can be considered as three types
of interrelated actions that are performed sequentially:
• Generation of a coalition structure; a framework in which agents within each coalition
coordinate their activities;
• Optimization of each coalition; agents have to be united by competencies for effective
problem solving;
• Profit sharing between coalition members.
If these actions are performed before problem solving, a static coalition formation
is considered. The structure of static coalitions does not change over time. At the time
of optimization of the coalition, also a plan for solving the problem is calculated as well
as all possible deviations from the plan. In case of failure, the correction of the plan is
carried out with coalition members that are still operate, taking into account the changed
conditions in order to get back to the original plan with minimal losses.
A more complex case of a coalition formation is the dynamic coalition. In this case
a plan of problem solving is formed during the optimization stage same as for the static
coalition. However, in case of deviation from the plan, a fix is based on changing the
structure of the coalition, for example, by adding a new participant. To do this, the
rules for the formation of the coalition should describe actions for unknown situations
with fuzzy parameters, and the overall benefit of the coalition and plan are dynamically
recalculated considering the context of the task has changed.
To evaluate the coalition efficiency the following parameters can be used:
• Energy spent to task solving. The solution of each task or sub-task can be estimated
by the energy (charge of the battery) Ek(Ti ) of the robot k that was spent to solve it:
Ek(Ti ) =
∑
j
fTi
(
bkj
)
· ϕ(Ti , k, j) (5)
Based on aggregated data over similar problems, it is possible to obtain an approximate
estimation, which, however, introduces fuzziness into the final coalition formation.
The coalition efficiency can be estimated as the total energy expended:
v
(
KTi
) = Payof f (Ti ) − minKi∈k
∑
j∈Ki
E j (Ti ) (6)
• An analogue to the estimated energy expended is a robot uptime based on failure
probability. The estimation of failure probability is the ratio of difference between
the time of the node work and the average uptime of the same kind of robot units:
PCi = Tw
Ci
− Tm
Ci
/T avg
Ci
, where PCi – failure probability of unit ci by robot rjrj, Tw
ci
– total work duration of the unit ci , Tm
ci – last service time point. The probability of
entire robot failure is evaluated according to themaximum probability of nodes failure
Pr = maxi Pci . The efficiency criterion in this case will be the maximum duration of
the coalition’s overall work to the next maintenance.
352 A. Smirnov et al.
• Maximizing the coalition benefit. For example, in relation to cyberphysical production
system, the coalition’s benefit is the cumulative product of the system. The value of
the solution of the problem decreases with the passage of time: the longer the task is
postponed, the less benefit it can provide.
5 Robot Interaction over Smart Contracts with FCG
In this Section, the scheme of interaction of robots during the coalition formation, is
proposed. The ability of smart contracts within the scope of blockchain technology to
describe complex algorithms by using the Turing-complete programming language is
used to define game rules in smart contracts. Examples of blockchain platforms with
support of smart contracts include the Ethereum platform and Hyperledger Fabric.
Figure 1 shows the scheme of interaction of robots in the coalition through a
blockchain. Two kinds of chains for storing resources and contracts is proposed to
use in the blockchain for robot interaction. All system resources including consumables,
energy, reward, which are represented by tokens, are stored in the resources chains. In the
contracts chain the rules of cooperative game are stored, which are used by the robots
coordinators during the coalition forming and the distribution of tasks. The contracts
also contains rules for processing tasks and assigning coalition core. The need for the
presence of coalition core, which will assess the complexity of the solution of the prob-
lem or the effectiveness of its solution and then distribute tasks among the performers
is noted in previous works [20, 21]. New tasks can be formed both inside and outside of
the system and are recorded in the contract chain, where they become available for all
coalition cores. Tasks contain a formalized description of the goal, the initial parameters
and the amount of reward for the solution.
The robot coordinator (RobotCORE1 or RobotCORE2 on Fig. 1) selects robots using
smart contracts based on their competencies and reward expectations, as well as the
rules of the cooperative game, defined for the subject area to which the task belongs.
If the robot can participate in several coalitions, each robot coordinator calculates the
cooperative game core and winning for each of the coalitions, as well as the availability
of sufficient resources for the robot successful work. If there are enough resources for
robot’s operations, it can participate in several coalitions.Otherwise, the robot is assigned
to a coalition for which it can bring the largest benefit. The reward for the successful
solution of the problem is distributed among the robots participating in the coalition
based on the reward rules for the cooperative game, described in the code of the relevant
contract.
The presented approach provides the following advantages. First, the use of the
blockchain guarantees the authorship of the information and its immutability, which is an
important aspect in dynamic coalitions of robots. Built-in authentication algorithms and
digital signatures allow to get rid of the complex infrastructure of certification centers,
which simplifies the deployment and operation of the system. Separation of chains with
resources and contracts provides an independent storage and exchange of the state of
the coalition between performers and control robots. This provides a trusted knowledge
base for robots to share coalition state including task and reward distribution. Since the
Robot Coalition Formation Based on Fuzzy Cooperative Games 353
data in the blockchain is bounded by the blocks’ hash, no block can be changed. It makes
process logs immutable and history of operations can be traced back, to find a failure
points, and enhance the effectiveness of future organized coalitions. The Hyperledger
platform that is proposed to be used for the organization of interaction provides a high
speed of processing and exchange of transactions (up to 3500 transactions per seconds
[24]).

Secondly, the architecture of Hyperledger platform, which includes three levels
(clients, peers and orderers), reflects the interaction structure presented on Fig. 1: the
clients correspond to the coalition robots, peers is robots with the coalition core and
orderer is a cloud service for storing chains. Each chain is corresponds to channel in
Hyperledger. Due to this, the computation of the core and the exchange of tasks and
the solutions obtained is carried out without the involvement of robots with a small
computing power. Turing-complete language can be used to formalize a contract of any
complexity.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, the integratedmodel of application of gameswith fuzzy coalitions and fuzzy
smart contracts, which can be applied to coalition formation betweenmultiple robots has
been described. Fuzziness serves as the fundamental component of realistic cooperation
models when there exist fuzzy expectations of player and coalition benefits. When an
effective solution is found, individual benefits for players (the agreement efficiency)
increase, aswell as the capability of the coalition tofind an effective and stable agreement.
Fuzzy paymentsmay have any utility function,which enables the use of themodel in real-
world applications. The blockchain model allows to avoid the synchronization problem,
which is critical for distributed negotiation algorithms with large robot populations.
354 A. Smirnov et al.
The integration of this FCG model with smart contracts can make robot coalitions
more transparent. The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which track robots’ actions
though the chain, provides opportunity to control and analyze all process of joint problem
solving. If any robot in coalition fails to meet the terms of the contract, for instance if
it did not finish an operation on time, it would be clear for every party to see and new
coalitions can be arranged dynamically. The blockchain can be used to safe and trustiness
logging of robots’ task and reward distribution and for task solving.
