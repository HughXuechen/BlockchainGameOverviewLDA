Abstract: Wash trading is considered a highly inopportune and illegal behavior in regulated markets.
Instead, it is practiced in unregulated markets, such as cryptocurrency or NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens)
markets. Regarding the latter, in the past many researchers have been interested in this phenomenon
from an “ex-ante” perspective, aiming to identify and classify wash trading activities before or at
the exact time they happen. In this paper, we want to investigate the phenomenon of wash trading
in the NFT market from a completely different perspective, namely “ex-post”. Our ultimate goal is
to analyze wash trading activities in the past to understand whether the game is worth the candle,
i.e., whether these illicit activities actually lead to a significant profit for their perpetrators. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature that attempts to answer this question in
a “structured” way. The efforts to answer this question have enabled us to make some additional
contributions to the literature in this research area. They are: (i) a framework to support future “ex-
post” analyses of the NFT wash trading phenomenon; (ii) a new dataset on wash trading transactions
involving NFTs that can support further future investigations of this phenomenon; (iii) a set of
insights of the NFT wash trading phenomenon extracted at the end of an experimental campaign.

1. Introduction
A Non-Fungible Token (NFT, for short) is a digital content that represents real-world
objects, such as artwork, music, games and collections of any kind. In a very short time,
prosperous markets have developed around NFTs. Their evolution and dynamics follow the
classic rules of any market [1,2], flanked by several peculiarities. Similar to any technology,
NFTs present both opportunities and risks [3–5]. As for the latter, a very significant one
concerns market manipulation, which aims to artificially increase the selling price of an
asset. This practice is called wash trading and consists of a series of sell and buy transactions
on the same asset performed by a single trader so as to generate a false interest in it, thereby
artificially increasing its value. In regulated markets, wash trading is judged a highly
improper and illegal behavior [6,7]. However, the cryptocurrency and NFT markets are
not regulated; therefore, wash trading activities have been carried out within them several
times in the past [8].
In the literature, several investigations concerning NFTs in general, and the wash
trading phenomenon in particular, have been proposed. As for the former, studies are very
varied in that they focus on different issues. Among them, we highlight: (i) the analysis
and characterization of NFT ecosystems [9–11], (ii) the study of the role of social media
(e.g., Twitter), in the context of NFTs [12], and (iii) the investigation of geopolitical risks
and market factors in this scenario [13]. The wash trading phenomenon was analyzed
from a variety of perspectives. However, all of them are “ex-ante”, that is, they aimed to
identify and classify wash trading activities before or at the exact time they occur [8,14–16].

In contrast, there are no “ex-post” analyses on wash trading, i.e., investigations aiming to
determine how much wash trading activities have already achieved success in increasing
(at least apparently) interest in the NFT involved, leading to the subsequent increase of
its value. Such a kind of analysis could have a variety of interesting applications. The
first of them concerns the ability to understand whether an NFT having a current selling
price much higher than its floor one (i.e., the lowest price at which it was sold in the
past) has achieved such a success because of its characteristics or because it is the subject
of speculation.
A second, even more important, application is the following. The practice of wash
trading is illicit, improper, and potentially harmful (at least to the reputation of those who
perform it, if they are found out). For this potential very high cost, what are the benefits? In
other words: is the game worth the candle? A study by the company Chainanalysis, whose
results were published in a report in February 2022 ( https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/
2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-nft-wash-trading-money-laundering/ (accessed on 25
November 2022) ), gives us a clue that this question is not all that far-fetched. In fact, this
study points out that most wash trading tasks on NFTs did not report high profits in the
past. Only in a few cases was there a significant profit. This report certainly is an important
clue to answering the previous question. However, it is not the result of a “structured”
study, taking into account the intrinsic meaning of the various features that characterize an
NFT. Being able to conduct such a kind of study would provide insight into whether there
are correlations, causal relationships, or other forms of relationships among the features
characterizing an NFT that, if taken into account, could lead a wash trading activity on it
to significantly increase its value. Conversely, if there are no such relationships, a wash
trading activity on an NFT will not be able to impact its value significantly, so the game
will not be worth the candle. Analyzing the wash trading phenomenon in a “structured”
way and “ex-post” to determine whether it is worth the candle is the main objective of
this paper.
An NFT (In this paper, when we talk about an NFT, we mean a collection of NFTs, all of
the same type; therefore, in the following, we will use the terms “NFT” and “NFT collection”
interchangeably.) is defined by several features, such as sales volume, price, owner number,
etc. The values of these features can change over time; as a consequence, our analysis will
have to take the time component into account. In addition, as mentioned above, the various
features can be related to each other by several relationships, e.g., correlation, causality,
distance, etc. In the following, we will use the term “facets” to refer to such relationships,
because they are able to capture different dimensions of the same phenomenon. These
facets, considered for all or part of the features of an NFT, allow us to perform a “structured”
analysis of the wash trading phenomenon. Nevertheless, this analysis, and those derived
from it that we present in this paper, will not be possible if we do not have a congruent
model available for representing NFTs. Therefore, our paper is also concerned with defining
such a model.
The first motivation behind our paper is the desire to define a structured framework
that allows for an “ex-post” analysis of the NFT wash trading phenomenon, and to apply it
to verify if the game is worth the candle. The second motivation is to define a new data
model, capable of providing a rich and comprehensive representation of NFT transactions,
as well as to support analyses of the phenomenon of interest from multiple facets. The
third motivation is to build a dataset that can support our framework in the analyses of the
NFT wash trading phenomenon and other investigations that we and/or other researchers
plan to conduct in the future. The fourth and final motivation is to enrich the knowledge of
the wash trading phenomenon already derived in the literature with new insights gained
thanks to our framework and dataset.
Specifically, the main contributions of this paper are:
• A framework to support the investigation of NFT-related phenomena. Specifically, this
framework consists of: (i) a model to represent NFTs, their features and the evolution
of the latter over time; (ii) a set of facets, which represent relationships among features.

The framework is general and allows for an easy expansion of both the model and the
set of facets in the future.
• A new dataset regarding the NFT scenario. Specifically, this dataset records wash
trading transactions made on some NFTs in the past. It holds substantial importance
since, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other datasets that include all the
information needed to analyze the wash trading phenomenon “ex-post”. We had to
derive such a dataset for our analysis and we made it freely available to all those
researchers who want to perform similar analyses and develop novel approaches for
an “ex-post” investigation of the NFT wash trading phenomenon.
• The illustration of the results of an experimental campaign in which we applied the
proposed framework to the dataset we constructed in order to answer the question
representing the core of this paper, and several other ones related to it.
The outline of this paper is as follows: in Section 2, we review the related literature. In
Section 3, we present our framework. In Section 4, we describe the dataset we constructed.
In Section 5, we illustrate the experiments we conducted. In Section 6, we present a
discussion regarding our framework and its ability to achieve the goals for which it was
designed. Finally, in Section 7, we draw our conclusion and outline some possible future
developments of our research efforts in this field.
2. Related Work
In recent years, thanks to the development of blockchain technology, the use of NFTs
to represent and identify the ownership of a unique asset has become popular. The
versatility characterizing NFTs has facilitated their diffusion and use in many fields, leading
researchers to address related challenges and needs [17–19]. In particular, the NFT market
is young and has no shared rules, which could lead to some problems [20,21]. One of the
most important of these problems is market manipulation performed by malicious users.
This problem also afflicts traditional markets, for example the stock one. However, in these
contexts, there are already established techniques to detect such practices [22].
One market manipulation mechanism also widespread in the NFT context is wash
trading [23,24]. This illicit practice consists of the repetition of buy and sell transactions
performed by the same user. The goal is to fake a growth in demand for an asset, thereby
attracting other investors and buyers to it by creating the illusion of a large business. Wash
trading in traditional markets is illegal. However, this is not the case with NFTs, since this
market is new and has little regulation because it has not yet been decided to which asset
class NFTs belong. The ability to manipulate the digital asset market is increased by the fact
that a user can make, buy or sell transactions simply by creating a wallet, without having
to provide additional identifying information.
Wash trading has been extensively investigated in the literature for traditional mar-
kets [22]. Recently, the analysis of illegal practices in cryptocurrency markets has also
attracted much interest [25–28]. In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, only a few
studies analyze wash trading in the NFT market [8,14–16]. All of these techniques aim to
identify and flag suspicious transactions that are thought to have been made for carrying
out wash trading activities. Therefore, they aim to perform an “ex-ante” examination [14].
Unlike all these approaches, ours aim is to perform an “ex-post” analysis. In fact, it aims to
study transactions that have already been identified as wash trading ones in order to verify
if the game is worth the candle.
Among the “ex-ante” approaches, there is the one described in [29], which aims to
identify anomalous transactions based on the probability of making a profit. Specifically, the
approach considers as anomalous those transactions that made a profit whose probability
was below a predetermined threshold. In [14], the authors introduce three new strategies to
detect potential wash trades in the NFT market. The first, called “Closed loop token trades”,
checks whether the pair of wallets making the transactions are involved in trading the same
token. The second, called “Closed loop value trades”, checks whether the same value is
transacted across multiple tokens. The third, called “high transaction volumes”, checks
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 4 of 23
for transactions handling large volumes of cryptocurrency between recently generated
accounts. It is particularly suited for detecting automated wash traders.
Other papers aimed to understand what generates fame and price around NFTs and
whether there is a mechanism that can control them [30–35]. For example, the authors
of [32] analyze the relationship between NFT sales and NFT active wallets, focusing on
two cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). To reach their objective,
they perform a Granger causality test, which aims to verify whether the change in a
feature produces a change in another one. Using this approach, they find that the BTC
price Granger-causes the NFT sales, while the ETH price Granger-causes the number of
NFT active wallets. Thus, they show that large cryptocurrency markets affect small NFT
markets, while the opposite effect does not happen. The approach described in [32] and
ours share the use of the Granger causality test to investigate the relationships between
different features in the context of NFTs. However, the purpose of the approach of [32]
is the identification of the relationships existing between BTC and ETH on the one hand,
and NFTs on the other hand. Therefore, [32] does not deal with wash trading, which is the
core of the analysis performed by our approach. In [31], the authors propose an approach
whose goal is very similar to the approach of [32], in that they also want to understand
whether the price of NFTs is correlated with that of cryptocurrencies. Their result indicates
that NFTs represent a class of assets weakly correlated with cryptocurrencies.
In [5], the authors propose a study to assess whether or not the wash trading phe-
nomenon has a significant presence in the NFT market. From this point of view, the
objective of [5] and that of our paper are certainly related, although quite different from
each other. Indeed, it could be the case that there is a massive presence of the phenomenon
and yet it turns out in the end that the game is not worth the candle, or vice versa.
Finally, there are papers that analyze the effects of wash trading within the NFT market.
Our paper is related to them in that it analyzes what changes in the market are brought
about by wash trading and whether this practice benefits people performing it.
The authors of [15] show that much of wash trading is unprofitable because of high
transaction costs. However, in those cases where such activities are successful, they manage
to create a high profit. The authors of [8] conduct a series of analyses to understand to
what extent wash trading occurs in NFT markets and to what extent this practice distorts
prices. They first create transaction graphs to identify suspicious transactions, and then
use these graphs to understand how wash trades alter market performance. Their analysis
reveals that an NFT for sale has on average an increased price after a flagged wash trade
involving it. However, a regression on panel data, designed to measure the price impact,
showed no significant change for the majority of NFTs. While the approach of [8] and our
own share one of their objectives, their ways of proceeding are completely different. In
fact, the approach of [8] focuses on suspicious transactions, while our approach aims to
determine whether a set of relationships exists between the features characterizing wash
trading activities.
At the end of this discussion, it seems interesting to us to point out that there are
research topics on NFTs that are close to wash trading and, at the same time, orthogonal to
it. For example, in [4], the authors analyze the emerging Flash Loan service. This allows
users to apply for non-collateral loans within the decentralized finance ecosystem. It, too,
could in principle be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. For example, wash
traders can use it to manipulate the market without a large amount of capital as long as
they can afford the potential loss and the gas fee to make transactions.
3. A Framework to Support the Investigation of NFT-Related Phenomena
In this section, we propose a framework to model NFTs and investigate phenomena
involving them. Specifically, in Section 3.1, we illustrate a model for representing a set of
NFTs and its evolution over time. In Section 3.2, we propose a set of operators (called facets)
that allow us to evaluate the mutual behavior of a set of NFTs involved in one or more
phenomena we want to analyze. We recall that the phenomenon under investigation in
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 5 of 23
this paper is wash trading. As a consequence, the facets that we propose in Section 3.2 are
well-suited for studying this phenomenon. However, our framework is easily extendable
so that one or more of these facets can be removed and other facets can be easily added in
case we want to investigate different NFT-related phenomena in the future.
3.1. A Model for NFTs
In this section, we illustrate our model for representing a set of NFT collections. An
NFT collection is a set of NFTs of the same type created by the same author. In particular,
let S = {C1, C2, · · · , Cl} be a set of NFT collections of interest. We assume that all the NFT
collections of S are characterized by the same set F = { f1, f2, · · · , fm} of features. Let Ci
be a generic NFT collection of S . It can be represented as:
Ci = 〈Namei,F〉
In this case, Namei is the name of Ci; this name is unique. The set F consists of
numerical features whose values may vary over time. To model such variation, we borrow
the concepts of time series analysis [36] and describe F as a multivariate time series, that
is, a set of contiguous observations, one for each feature of interest. For instance, some
features of interest for an NFT collection might be the sales price, the number of sellers and
the number of owners.
In our model, the evolution of features is crucial; therefore, it is essential to model
time. For this purpose, given an overall interval T of interest, we can think of modeling
it as an ordered sequence of z time slices, T = T1, · · · , Tz. For example, T could be a
certain month, say October 2022, and could be represented by a succession of 31 time slices,
one for each day. It is necessary for our time representation to allow the indexing of the
sequence of time slices so that we can select a particular interval of contiguous time slices
of T (e.g., the second decade of October 2022). To this end, our model uses the notation
T[x..y], 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z, to denote the interval of contiguous time slices in T that begins
at Tx and ends at Ty. If x = y, then it means that we want to select a single time slice; in
this case, we will use the abbreviated notation Tx or T[x] to represent T[x..x]. If x = 1 and
y = z, then it means we are considering the overall interval of interest; in this case, we will
use the abbreviated notation T, instead of T[1..z], to denote this interval.
The previous notation about intervals and time slices can be extended to model the
features of an NFT collection. Specifically, given a generic NFT collection Ci = 〈Namei,F〉
of S , we denote by F [x..y] the trend of the values of F assumed by Ci in the time interval
T[x..y]. In turn, f j[x..y], 1 ≤ j ≤ m, denotes the trend of the value of f j assumed by Ci in
the time interval T[x..y]. Clearly, F [x..y] = { f1[x..y], f2[x..y], · · · , fm[x..y]}. We will use the
notation F [x], or Fx, (resp., f j[x], or f jx ) to represent the values of F (resp., the value of f j)
assumed by Ci during the time slice Tx, i.e., F [x] = F [x..x] (resp., f j[x] = f j[x..x]). Finally,
we will use the abbreviated notation F (resp., f j) to denote the trend of the values of F
(resp., the value of f j) assumed by Ci during the overall time interval T, i.e., F = F [1..z]
(resp., f j = f j[1..z]).
As a consequence of the previous modeling, F (resp., f j) represents a multivariate
(resp., univariate) time series.
3.2. The Selected Facets
In this section, we examine the facets used by our framework to investigate the wash
trading phenomenon for NFTs. They are correlations, causal relationships, and distances
between features. They are capable of capturing and evaluating different aspects of the
phenomenon under consideration. However, we recall that our research framework is
easily extendable so that some of these facets could be removed and other ones could be
easily added in the future should it be deemed appropriate.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 6 of 23
3.2.1. Correlation
The first facet considered in our research framework is the correlation occurring be-
tween different features related to NFT transactions (e.g., sales, floor price, wash sales,
active wallets). Correlation analysis is carried out through two techniques: the first de-
termines the correlation degree of a pair of features by computing the Pearson coefficient
between the corresponding time series [37]. More specifically, suppose f j and fk are the
two features of interest. Furthermore, suppose that the reference time interval for the time
series is T[1..z]. Let f jx (resp., fkx ) be the value of f j (resp. fk) in the time slice Tx, 1 ≤ x ≤ z.
Let f j (resp., fk) be the mean of the values of f j (resp., fk) in the time interval T. The Pearson
coefficient is defined as:
ρjk =
∑z
x=1(( f jx − f j) · ( fkx − fk))√
∑z
x=1( f jx − f j)2 ·
√
∑z
i=1( fkx − fk)2
(1)
The computation of the correlation using the Pearson coefficient is straightforward
and can already provide interesting insights. However, it does not take into account the
cross-correlation between the time series involved, i.e., the possibility that two features are
correlated, but one of them lags behind the other. The second correlation coefficient we use
takes this fact into account. In order to define it, we must first standardize the time series
associated with features. Standardization is achieved by subtracting the corresponding
mean from each value and dividing the result obtained by the corresponding standard
deviation. At this point, it is possible to calculate the cross-correlation between two features
by considering the xth element of one and the (x + h)th element of the other. The parameter
h represents the lag that we want to consider. In principle, h could range from 0 to z− x. In
practice, low values of h are chosen; for example, we considered values of h less than or
equal to 2 in our experiments.
By analyzing the cross-correlation between two features, it is possible to understand
whether one of them can be used to predict the values of the other. Given two features, after
computing the cross-correlation for different values of h, we select the maximum value as
the overall cross-correlation coefficient between the two features. This policy allows us to
capture the maximum similarity existing between the two features.
Correlation represents a facet of our approach, i.e., a point of view through which
to study the phenomenon of interest. Specifically, once we standardize the time series
associated with features, it is able to show us the similarity degree of each pair of them
regardless of the lag, whether or not that similarity is due to a cause-and-effect phenomenon.
3.2.2. Causality
The second facet considered in our research framework takes into account the causal
relationship that may exist between two features. Unlike correlation, here we are really
looking for a cause-and-effect relationship between a pair of features such that the values
of one of them depend on the values of the other. To compute a causal index between a pair
of features f j and fk, we first consider the test proposed by Granger [38]. This test is based
on the idea of comparing the ability to predict the values of fk using all the information
in the universe, denoted by U , with the ability to predict the same values using all the
information in U except the values of f j. We will adopt the notation U| f j to denote the
latter. If discarding f j reduces the predictive power on fk, then it means that f j has unique
information about fk. In this case, we say that f j Granger-causes fk. In order to apply the
Granger test, it is necessary to ensure that the series are stationary. To verify it, one can
adopt the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test [39]. If one or both series are not stationary, it is
necessary to make them stationary through a differentiation process.
To carry out the Granger causality test, it is necessary to compare the values returned
by a first linear model, called restricted, obtained by means of an autoregressive model
(Vector AutoRegression—VAR) [40] of the time series of fk, with the values obtained by a
second linear model, called unrestricted, which considers both the time series f j and fk [41].
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 7 of 23
Equation (2) represents the restricted model, while Equation (3) denotes the unrestricted one.
fkx = γ0 +
p
∑
h=1
(γh · fkx−h
) + ex (2)
fkx = α0 +
p
∑
h=1
(αh · fkx−h
) + ex +
p
∑
h=1
(βh · f jx−h) + ux (3)
In these equations:
• fkx denotes the value of the feature fk at time Tx;
• γh, αh and βh indicate linear coefficients;
• p represents the maximum number of lagged observations included in the model;
• ex and ux denote time-dependent noise terms;
• fkx−h
and f jx−h indicate the values of the features fk and f j at time Tx−h.
Equation (2) assumes that fk depends linearly only on its past values and the noise
term ex. Equation (3) considers fk to be linearly dependent on the past values of f j and fk
and two time-dependent noise terms ex and ux.
Similarly to what we have seen for the refined computation of the correlation of two
features in Section 3.2.1, the computation of causality values is performed considering a
certain number p of lagged observations. In the experimental tests, we set p less than or
equal to 3.
Being a statistical test, it is important to define the null hypothesis. In our case, it is
as follows: H0: “ f j does not Granger-cause fk” . This is equivalent to saying that βh = 0,
1 ≤ h ≤ p, in Equation (3). The p-value resulting from the test determines the acceptance or
the rejection of the null hypothesis.
Equations (2) and (3), used previously in the Granger test, express a linear model and,
therefore, can be used if the features f j and fk exhibit linear trends. If this is not the case, the
Granger test can still be applied, but the linear models represented by Equations (2) and (3)
must be replaced with nonlinear ones. Neural networks, which can handle nonlinearity,
can be employed for this purpose. For instance, two neural networks suitable for this
purpose are the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
models [42,43]. These nonlinear models are used as restricted and unrestricted models in
the Granger test. As in the previous case, the resulting predictions of the two models are
compared in order to derive the possible existence of the causality relationship between the
input features.
Causality is an important facet. In fact, it represents a stronger relationship than
correlation. In other words, if f j causes fk, we can say not only that fk is correlated with f j,
but also that the values of fk depend on the values of f j or, also, that the knowledge of the
values of f j allows the prediction of the values of fk. It is worth recalling that two features
f j and fk might be correlated without one depending on the other. In this sense, correlation
still remains a facet to be considered, regardless of causality.
3.2.3. Distance
The third and final facet considered by our research framework takes into account the
distance between features. Since each feature has a time series associated with it, classical
metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan or Minkowski distances, cannot be used to compute
the distance between features because they do not take the temporal nature of data into
account. In other words, they are unable to understand whether the two time series align
but with a certain lag from each other. So, ad hoc distance metrics are needed to handle
such a scenario. Among them, a well-known one is the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
distance [44].
The DTW distance receives two time series f j and fk as input. These must be stan-
dardized. If they are not, it is first necessary to proceed with a standardization task by
which the corresponding mean is subtracted from each element of the series and the result
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 8 of 23
obtained is divided by the corresponding standard deviation. As a first task, the DTW
distance identifies the optimal alignment between the two series. This alignment is defined
through the optimal alignment path π. This path can be represented as a succession of pairs
( f ju , fkv) such that f ju is the element of f j that best aligns to fkv , and vice versa (see [44] for
all details).
Once the optimal alignment path π has been identified, the DTW distance computes,
for each pair ( f ju , fkv) ∈ π, the difference ( f ju − fkv), which represents the distance be-
tween the two values. Then, it calculates the square of that distance to eliminate the sign
dependence. Finally, it sums the squares of the differences of each pair of π and com-
putes the square root of the value thus obtained [45]. This whole process is represented in
Equation (4).
DTW( f j, fk) =
√
∑
( f ju , fkv )∈π
(
f ju − fkv
)2 (4)
Distance is another important critical facet of our research framework. It can be
computed for any pair ( f j, fk) of features, regardless of the existence of a correlation
or causal relationship between them. From this point of view, distance is a “universal”
facet because it can be employed in any circumstance. However, it is clear that, at equal
distances, if two features f j and fk are also related by correlation or even causality, the
link between them is much stronger, and this should be taken into account. The adoption
of the correlation and causality facets introduced above is for just that purpose. This
reasoning reinforces the idea that a multi-facet approach to the analysis of the wash trading
phenomenon can provide more accurate results than an approach that considers only one
form of relationship between features.
4. Dataset
In order to investigate the phenomenon of NFT wash trading, we had to build a
dataset from scratch, capable of supporting our investigation. This was necessary because
there were no ready datasets in the literature that could be used for our analysis. In fact,
the few datasets available referred only to the most popular collections of NFTs or only to
a small number of specific features or, again, they covered too short time periods. More
relevantly, most of these datasets were designed to search for suspicious wash trading
transactions and did not provide information on the volume of money traded, which is
important for the objectives of our analysis.
We built our dataset by extracting data from Cryptoslam (http://criptoslam.io (ac-
cessed on 24 November 2022) ). This is an aggregator of NFT collectibles data derived from
the Ethereum, WAX, and FLOW blockchains. According to the Cryptoslam website policy,
we created a Python script that downloads all NFT sales data recorded by the Cryptoslam
explorer. We downloaded data on all NFT sales carried out from the entry of each NFT
collection into the market to the last day of our data extraction task, i.e., 7 February 2023.
Proceeding in this way, we were able to extract many NFT collections. Afterward, we
selected the top 2000 of them, indexed on the basis of their USD sales volumes. In this
way, we constructed a ranking from which to draw the NFT collections to be considered for
further analysis. In addition, we downloaded daily ETH/USD exchange rate data from
Yahoo Finance in order to standardize the money amounts within the dataset, because some
of them were expressed in USD and others in ETH. For each NFT collection, Cryptoslam
explorer (https://cryptoslam.gitbook.io/docs/ (accessed on 25 November 2022) ) identifies
and reports wash trading sales and transactions, which are stored in our dataset. The com-
plete dataset has 672,098 rows, with a mean of 336 rows for each NFT collection. A sample
of 112,512 rows of the dataset is available for further experiments at the following GitHub
address: https://github.com/Bored3DS/NFT-Scrap (accessed on 24 November 2022) .
After constructing the dataset, we performed ETL operations on it to facilitate the next
data analysis activities. The first step in this operation concerns the identification of the

https://github.com/Bored3DS/NFT-Scrap

features of NFT collections useful for studying the phenomenon of interest. At the end of
this step, we identified the following variables:
• Name: it represents the name of the NFT collection to which all the next features refer;
• Date: it indicates the day to which all the next features refer;
• Sales: it denotes the sales volume expressed in USD;
• ETH: it represents the ETH/USD exchange rate;
• Floor Price: it indicates the minimum price of an NFT in the collection;
• Active Wallets: it denotes the number of active wallets;
• Sales Txns: it represents the number of sales transactions;
• Total Owners: it indicates the total number of owners;
• Wash Sales: it indicates the volume of wash sales expressed in USD;
• Wash Txns: it denotes the number of transactions made for performing wash sale
activities.
All these variables, except for the first (representing the name of the NFT collection)
and the second (denoting the time slices of interest), form the set F of features of our
interest.
The second step of the ETL activity we carried out on the dataset regarded the homog-
enization of time slices. In fact, different features were surveyed at different cadences. In
the end, we decided to use the daily cadence as the reference one. A snapshot of the dataset
obtained after all these tasks is shown in Figure 1.

5. Experiments
In this section, we apply the model and facets described in Section 3 on the dataset
introduced in Section 4. Our ultimate goal is to address the challenge underlying this
paper, which is to understand whether, in the case of NFT wash trading, the game is
worth the candle. In the Introduction, we said we wanted to answer this question by
means of a “structured” study, which takes into consideration the intrinsic meaning of the
various features that characterize an NFT, and especially the relationships between them.
These relationships can be expressed through the three facets we introduced in Section 3.2,
namely: correlation, causality and distance. Therefore, we divide the experiments in this
section into three groups, one for each facet.
5.1. Experiments on Correlation
The first group of experiments focused on the first facet we introduced in Section 3.2,
namely correlation. Regarding this facet, we saw that there are two different forms of
correlation to consider, namely the Pearson and cross-correlation coefficients.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 10 of 23
We started our analysis by computing, for each NFT collection, the Pearson coefficient
relative to each pair of features of interest. Then, we averaged the corresponding values on
all available NFT collections. The results obtained are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Values of the Pearson coefficient averaged on all available NFT collections.
From examining this figure, we can see that the Pearson coefficient generally has
medium-low values except for the following pairs of features:
• (Sales, Active Wallets): in this case, the coefficient has a value of 0.84. This correlation
indicates that the sales volume of a certain collection tends to increase as the number
of active wallets referring to it increases.
• (Sales, Sales Txns): in this case, the coefficient has a value of 0.81. This correlation
indicates that an increase in the number of sales transactions leads to an increase in
the corresponding volumes.
• (Sales Txns, Active Wallets): in this case, the coefficient has a value of 0.95. This
correlation tells us that increasing the number of active wallets also leads to an increase
in the number of sales transactions. The two trends are very strongly correlated.
• (ETH, Total Owners): in this case, the coefficient has a value of −0.70. This correlation
tells us that a decrease in the ETH/USD exchange rate leads to an increase in the
number of NFT owners.
• (Wash Sales, Wash Txns): in this case, the coefficient has a value of 0.78. This correlation
tells us that an increase in wash trading transactions leads to an increase in the
corresponding volume of wash sales.
All the correlation pairs highlighted above have an immediate intuitive explanation
except for the pair (ETH, Total Owners). In this case, an explanation can be identified by
means of the following reasoning: A decrease in the ETH cost leads to fewer USDs needed
to purchase an NFT from the collection. So, more people can afford to buy those NFTs,
which leads to an increase in the number of total owners.
In order to perform a deeper analysis of the correlation of features, we investigated
their cross-correlation. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 3.2.1, we considered three cases
(It is worth pointing out that, when h = 0, the cross-correlation coincides with the Pearson
coefficient.) corresponding to a number h of lags equal to 0, 1 and 2. For each of these cases,
we computed the value of the cross-correlation for each pair of features and for each NFT
collection. Finally, we averaged the values thus obtained over all the NFT collections. The
results are shown in Figure 3 (for h = 1) and Figure 4 (for h = 2). The results for h = 0
are those reported in Figure 2, since they coincide with the ones of the Pearson coefficient
computation.

Figure 4. Cross-correlation values averaged on all available NFT collections (h = 2).
From the analysis of Figures 2–4, we can observe that, as the value of h increases, the
values of cross-correlation for the pairs of features generally decrease, and sometimes by a
great deal. Only for some pairs of features do they remain essentially constant. In contrast,
we never observe a significant increase in the values of cross-correlation for any pair. This
is already an interesting result because it indicates the absence of a predictive capability of
one feature with respect to any other.
Let us now focus on the features most involved in wash trading, namely Wash Sales
and Wash Txns. The values of the correlations between these features and all the others
in our dataset are shown in the last two rows of Figures 2–4. From the analysis of these
figures, we can extract the following insights:
• The values of the correlation between Wash Sales and Wash Txns are very high for
h = 0. This was quite expected because an increase in the number of wash trading
transactions generally corresponds to an increase in the amount of money involved.
However, observe that the strength of this correlation decreases rapidly when passing
from h = 0 to h = 1 or h = 2. This implies that an increase in the amount of money
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 12 of 23
currently involved in wash trading has no impact on future wash trading transactions,
and vice versa.
• The correlations of Wash Sales with the other features are positive, except for Total
Owners, with which there is a slight negative correlation. This can be explained by
considering that, in doing wash trading, a person sells their NFTs after buying them
to artificially inflate their price.
• While the correlation values between Wash Sales and Wash Txns are very high, those
between each of these features and the other ones in the model are low or very low.
This suggests that wash trading has a low or very low influence on the main economic
and financial variables of an NFT.
The examination of these three figures gives us an initial clue about the main question
underlying our paper. However, we think it is appropriate to continue with the other facets
before drawing stable conclusions about it. In addition, we have derived two other insights
about the wash trading phenomenon that, albeit collateral, are nonetheless of interest in
deepening our comprehension of this phenomenon.
5.2. Experiments on Causality
The second group of experiments focused on the second facet introduced in Section 3.2,
namely causality. In Section 3.2.1, we have said that, in order to test whether the values of a
feature f j allowed us to predict the values of a feature fk, we could use the Granger causality
test. We used such a test considering the features Wash Sales and Sales to verify whether
Wash Sales Granger-cause Sales. Indeed, if this occurs, we would have a clue that, in wash
trading, the game is worth the candle. If not, we would have an additional clue, alongside
that already obtained in the previous section, that the game is not worth the candle. Recall
that the following null hypothesis must be considered to perform this verification: H0:
“Wash Sales does not Granger-cause Sales” . Then, for each NFT collection, we perform the test
and calculate the p-value. If the latter is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Recall also that the Granger causality test for verifying whether f j Granger-causes
fk is based on the idea of comparing the ability to predict the values of fk using all the
information in the universe (U ) with the ability to predict the same values using all the
information in the universe except f j (U| f j). For the test to be meaningful, we need to have
many values of f j. In fact, if this did not happen, there would be a risk that the prediction
of fk using U and the one obtained using U| f j are identical not because of the presence of a
causal relationship between f j and fk, but because U and U| f j tend to coincide. For this
reason, we had to remove from our analysis all NFT collections that had many null values
of Wash Sales. In particular, we kept only those NFT collections that had at least 10% of
their rows with not null values of Wash Sales. At the end of this activity, we maintained
1386 of the 2000 original NFT collections.
Once the NFT collections that could be involved in the Granger causality test were
identified, we checked for how many of them the p-value associated with the null hypothe-
sis expressed above was less than 0.05. Specifically, we performed this computation both
using a linear autoregressive model (VAR) and adopting the two deep learning models
mentioned in Section 3.2.2, namely MLP and LSTM. The results obtained are reported in
Table 1. In addition to considering the three different models mentioned above, we consid-
ered different values of p (representing the maximum number of lagged observations). In
particular, we took into consideration three values of p, namely 1, 2 and 3.
Table 1. Percentage of the NFT collections for which the null hypothesis H0 can be rejected.
Model p = 1 p = 2 p = 3
VAR 4.25% 4.03% 4.01%
MLP 1.04% 1.04% 0.52%
LSTM 2.13% 1.54% 1.53%
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 13 of 23
From the analysis of Table 1, we can deduce the following insights:
• The null hypothesis is almost always confirmed when the linear model is used within
the Granger causality test, and this trend is even more evident when the MLP and
LSTM models are employed.
• As the value of p increases, there is no significant change in the percentage of NFT
collections for which the null hypothesis H0 is confirmed in the Granger causality test.
As for the 614 NFT collections that we had to discard because there were not enough
Wash Sales values, from a formal point of view we cannot draw any conclusions regarding
the existence of a causal relationship between Wash Sales and Sales. However, we can
conjecture that the high number of null values for Wash Sales in these NFT collections is
already an indicator of the little influence that Wash Sales can exert on Sales as well as on
all the other features. Therefore, we can think that, for all or most of these NFT collections,
Wash Sales do not Granger-cause Sales.
At the end of this series of tests, we can conclude that there is generally no causal
relationship between Wash Sales and Sales. This represents a confirmation of what we had
already found through the correlation analysis, namely that, in the case of wash trading,
the game is not worth the candle. However, before drawing any final conclusion, we think
it appropriate to examine the third facet described in Section 3.2, namely distance.
5.3. Experiments on Distance
The third group of experiments focuses on the third facet introduced in Section 3.2,
namely distance. In Section 3.2.3, we have specified that we use Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) to evaluate this facet quantitatively. In particular, we computed the value of DTW
for each pair of features and for each NFT collection of the dataset. Then, we averaged
the DTW values thus obtained over the NFT collections. The final results are shown in
Figure 5.

Figure 5. Distance values averaged on all available NFT collections.
Some critical insights can be obtained from the analysis of this figure. In particular:
• The pair of features (Wash Sales, Wash Txns) has a very low value of DTW. This is
justified by the fact that both of them relate directly to wash trading activities. In fact,
this result is fully congruent with what we have reported in Section 5.1, where we
have seen that there is a strong correlation between these two features.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 14 of 23
• The pair of features (Sales, Sales Txns) has a very low value of DTW. The same
explanation as seen for the previous pair applies to it.
• The pairs of features (Sales Txns, Active Wallets) and (Sales, Active Wallets) have low
values of DTW, although they are higher than those of the previous two pairs. The
same explanation as for the previous pairs applies to them. However, note that, while
in Section 5.1, the correlation of the pair (Sales Txns, Active Wallets) is much greater
than that of the pair (Sales, Active Wallets), and in the case of distance there is not a
great difference between the two pairs.
• The pairs of features (Wash Sales, Sales) and (Wash Sales, Floor Price) have high
DTW values. These values are much higher than the ones characterizing the previous
pairs. In particular, the pair (Wash Sales, Floor Price) has a much higher distance than
the previous pairs, but this distance is slightly lower than that of the other pairs. In
contrast, the distance relative to the pair (Wash Sales, Sales) is the highest one among
the distances of all the pairs of features.
The insight concerning the pair (Wash Sales, Floor Price) mentioned above is extremely
interesting because it may be a clue that wash trading activities may have an influence,
albeit limited, on Floor Price. This information, although it is not the central one we are
interested in for this paper, represents a collateral knowledge we extracted that is certainly
useful and worthy of future investigation.
Finally, the insight concerning the pair (Wash Sales, Sales) mentioned above is very
interesting. We premise that, in contrast to the other two facets, for the DTW parameter
there is no predefined maximum value. Therefore, the considerations that can be drawn
concern comparisons of the values of this parameter for the various pairs of features. All
that said, the fact that the value of DTW for the pair (Wash Sales, Sales) is the highest value
of DTW among all possible pairs of features is still a clue that, for Wash Trading, the game is
not worth the candle. If we had only this clue, it would be rash to draw a conclusion, given
the lack of the maximum value for DTW. However, in this case, this clue is perfectly in line
with the ones obtained from the previous two facets. In light of this, it seems reasonable for
us to say that, in the case of wash trading, the game is not worth the candle. Therefore, we
have found an unambiguous and, in some ways, surprising answer to the question that is
the central focus of this paper.
5.4. Further Verification of Knowledge Detected by Our Framework
The experiments in the previous section showed how our framework was able to
extract important knowledge about the NFT wash trading phenomenon, and thus to
achieve the goal for which it was designed. In particular, it derived that the game is
not worth the candle. In this section, we describe a further experiment designed to test
whether the knowledge detected by our framework has a foundation or not. For this
purpose, we examine three main NFT projects, namely Azuki, Bored Ape Yacht Club
(BAYC) and Milady. Our objective is to determine whether in these three cases the wash
trading activities carried out had a significant impact on sales. To answer this question, we
need to analyze the relationships between the features Wash Sales and Sales in the three
NFT projects considering the three different facets managed by our framework.
We begin our verification by analyzing the possible cross-correlations between the
features Wash Sales and Sales related to the three projects for the first three lags. The plots
are shown in Figures 6–8. From the analysis of this figure, we can observe that Wash Sales
and Sales show similar patterns (in the sense that, for example, both show peaks or troughs)
but are not directly correlated (in that, for example, the peaks occur at different times, and
the same happens for the troughs). This reveals that there is no strong correlation between
Wash Sales and Sales, and this is a first confirmation of our framework’s ability to extract
correct knowledge about the NFT wash trading phenomenon.

Figure 8. Cross-correlation of Wash Sales and Sales for Milady when h = 0, h = 1, and h = 2.
The next step in our verification involved the causality facet. To this end, we performed
the Granger tests to determine whether a causality relationship exists between the features
Wash Sales and Sales on the three NFT projects. The corresponding p-values are presented
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 18 of 23
in Table 2. From the analysis of this table, we can observe that the p-values are always
greater than 0.05. As a consequence, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of the Granger
tests. As mentioned in Section 3.2.2, this implies that wash trading activities have no effect
on the sales of an NFT, since the knowledge of the current values of Wash Sales does not
allow us to say anything on the future values of Sales.
Table 2. p-values returned by the Granger tests applied on the features Wash Sales and Sales for
Azuki, BAYC and Milady.

VAR 0.11 0.23 0.73

LSTM 0.38 0.93 0.46
The results derived from examining this second facet also confirm the ability of our
framework to extract correct knowledge regarding the NFT wash trading phenomenon.
As a final verification, we computed the DTW distance between all possible pairs of
features of the three NFT projects. The corresponding heatmaps are reported in Figure 9.
From the analysis of this figure, we can see that the pair of features (Wash Sales, Sales)
has associated the largest DTW values among all possible pairs. This implies that Wash
Sales and Sales are very distant features, and therefore that it is not possible to predict
the values of one of them knowing the values of the other. This conclusion is a further
confirmation that our framework was able to extract correct knowledge regarding the NFT
wash trading phenomenon.

Figure 9. DTW distance values between all the pairs of features for Azuki, BAYC, and Milady.
As a consequence, all facets examined for all NFT projects considered in this test agree
in confirming the correctness of the conclusions derived from our framework about the
(negligible) role of wash trading in stimulating sales.
6. Discussion
The experiments presented in Section 5 allowed us to conclude that our framework
is capable of supporting the analysis of the NFT scenario and, in particular, wash trading
activities that occurred in it. As proof of this, we obtained interesting results for all the
facets considered.
As for the correlation facet, we found that the correlations and the cross-correlations
between the features related to wash trading and the others were very low, suggesting that
wash trading activities had a limited impact on the financial features of an NFT.
This inference was confirmed by the causality facet. In fact, the null hypothesis of the
Granger test related to the pair (Wash Sales, Sales) was almost never rejected for either
linear and nonlinear models. This fact implies that there is generally no causal relationship
between Wash Sales and Sales.
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 20 of 23
The latest confirmation to our framework’s conclusions came from the distance facet.
In fact, the DTW value for the pair (Wash Sales, Sales) was the highest among all pairs of
features. This means that the corresponding features were very distant, implying that it is
very unlikely that there is an impact of wash trading activities on NFT values.
It is exactly the joint and unambiguous result of the three facets that allowed us to
conclude that wash trading is not worth the candle. Therefore, the framework we proposed
has proven its validity to perform the task for which it was designed.
The presence of facets provides our framework with the potential to derive (through
some facets), and next confirm (through the other ones), insights into the NFT wash trading
phenomenon. The correlation facet implies the computation of the Pearson coefficient and
cross-correlation coefficients between two features. They give us an idea of the possible
influence of one feature over another and, in our case study, of the impact of wash trading
on NFT sales. The correlation facet is able to determine the similarity degree of each pair of
features, but cannot show the presence or absence of a cause-and-effect phenomenon. For
this reason, we have included the causality facet in our framework. In this case, thanks to
the Granger tests, we are able to verify whether one feature has a predictive power over the
other. The last facet, i.e., the distance one, has a confirmatory role. In fact, if the distance
between two features are low and they are related by a correlation or causality relationship,
we can conclude that their connection is much stronger.
An additional merit of our framework is its extensibility, so that at any time we can
add other facets capable of capturing new features that we deemed appropriate to consider.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, we aimed to verify whether, in the case of wash trading in the NFT
market, the game was worth the candle. To achieve our goal, we had to define a framework
for analyzing wash trading transactions in the context of the NFT market from an “ex-post”
perspective, rather than from an “ex-ante” one, as it had been done previously in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the wash trading
phenomenon in the NFT market from this perspective and in a “structured” way. In fact,
in the past, there have been blogs and magazines that have dealt with doing “ex-post”
statistical investigations of the wash trading phenomenon. However, they proposed only
descriptive and diagnostic analyses, and not a framework, complete and “structured”,
based on a well-defined data model, capable of supporting this kind of analysis. Our
framework, in addition to a model tailored specifically for this type of analysis, introduces
several “facets” (i.e., perspectives) through which the phenomenon can be analyzed. The
formalization of “facets” is also a new feature of our framework, compared to past analyses.
At the end of our investigation, we were able to show that wash trading in the NFT market
is not worth the candle.
Although the main objective of this paper was to answer this question, it provides some
other contributions, namely: (i) a framework to support future “ex-post” investigations on
the NFT wash trading phenomenon; (ii) a new dataset, freely available, which stores data
on wash trading transactions involving NFTs in the past and may support further analyses
on the NFT wash trading phenomenon from an “ex-post” perspective; and (iii) the results
of an experimental campaign that not only answers the core question behind this paper,
but also provides several additional insights into the NFT wash trading phenomenon.
This paper does not represent an ending point, but rather a starting point, in our
investigations on the NFT wash trading phenomenon. In fact, we can imagine several
future developments in this line of research. For example, we might consider using Machine
Learning algorithms to predict wash trading and sales volumes and to extract knowledge
patterns characterizing the features involved in the wash trading phenomenon. In addition,
it would be interesting to investigate the correlation between other NFT features, such as
rarity and asset type, and the corresponding wash trading activity. Indeed, some types
of NFTs might receive more attention from malicious users than others. To this end, a
categorization of them based on their features could help predict whether and to what
Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 38 21 of 23
extent a new NFT might be subject to speculation. Finally, we plan to study what the factors
that drive NFT prices are, with a focus on the community that supports an NFT project.
In particular, we want to investigate the social media ecosystem around an NFT project
and characterize the behavior of users participating in it, as well as the characteristics of
contents produced by them.
In addition to the tasks we intend to pursue, we want to outline some potential future
recommendations that may assist any researcher who wishes to extend this research. First, it
would be interesting to investigate the role of NFT marketplaces in facilitating or preventing
wash trading activities. Researchers could enhance the data we collected by integrating it
with information about marketplaces and reasoning about the role of the latter in promoting
fairness and preventing malicious behavior. Another interesting recommendation is to
analyze the motivations behind wash trading. Indeed, our study provides an “ex-post” view
of the phenomenon, but says little about the motivations of those people who have engaged
in wash trading. Researchers interested in this topic could hypothesize certain motivations
and test the truth of their hypotheses by analyzing discussions in social networks among
those who engage in NFT transactions. More technical recommendations for researchers
interested in this context are to study the impact of NFT ownership concentration and to
investigate the impact of NFT trading bots. The first topic is a critically important aspect
of market behavior, particularly when much of the ownership is in the hands of a few
large holders. The second topic would concern the possibly automatic identification of
trading bots. This would be a challenging issue that could allow researchers to study and
understand the role of bots in promoting or preventing illicit behaviors.
