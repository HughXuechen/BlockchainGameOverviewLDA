Abstract—Blockchain technology is a promising approach for
solving the security and personal privacy problems in Internet ap-
plications. The successful commercial deployment of Blockchain
markets relies on a comprehensive understanding of the economic
and strategic interactions among different entities involved. In
this paper, we focus on a blockchain market consisting of
a blockchain platform (BP), multiple miners, and blockchain
users (BUs), and formulate their interactions as a three-stage
Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the BP strategizes the rewards
granted to the miners, so as to attract the miners to contribute
more computing power used for improving the security and
privacy of the blockchain. In Stage II, each miner strategizes
its computing power individually for winning the mining compe-
tition, which is modeled as a non-cooperative game. In Stage III,
the BUs strategize the transaction fee to acquire a corresponding
service experience. With the objective of utility maximization,
we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the hierarchical
interactive behaviors among the entities in a backward inductive
way. By solving the Stackelberg equilibrium, we determine the
optimal strategies of entities in closed-form. Numerical results
are provided to demonstrate the performance of the strategic
interactions in the blockchain market.

elberg game, equilibrium, PoW competition.
I. INTRODUCTION
The world-changing blockchain technology is a promis-
ing approach for solving the security and personal privacy
problems in Internet applications, via establishing distributed
tamper-proof ledgers and platforms [1]. As the most famous
blockchain application, Bitcoin was invented by Nakamoto in
2008, which adopts a distributed consensus mechanism proof-
of-work (PoW) to achieve trusted interactions in distributed
systems without the involvement of any third party [2]. With
the increasing popularity of Bitcoin, as well as due to the
capability of providing low-cost, efficient, and secure data
storage in distributed systems, blockchain technology has
been attracting tremendous attention from both industry and
academia.
Over the last decade, great efforts have been made to study
blockchain technology from diverse perspectives, e.g., security
and privacy protection, consensus protocol design, blockchain

applications, etc. Although these existing works have remark-
ably promoted the development of blockchain, the economic
and strategic interactions among different blockchain entities
still remain largely uninvestigated. Actually, such interactive
behaviors are pervasive in practical blockchain markets. For
example, miners join the block discovery competition for
financial incentives, while users pay fees for packing their
transactions into the blockchain. Therefore, to facilitate the
successful commercial deployment of Blockchain markets, a
comprehensive understanding of the entities’ interactions is of
great significance.
By now, some preliminary works have been conducted to
explore the blockchain entities’ interactions. Specifically, Feng
et al. [3] proposed a cyber risk management approach for
the blockchain market by modeling the interactions between
the blockchain provider and users. Considering the compe-
tition among miners, Jiao et al. [4] designed an auction-
based edge computing allocation mechanism to support the
mobile blockchain. Taghizadeh et al. [5] exploited the mean-
field game theory to analyze the mining computational power
equilibrium of miners in a PoW-based blockchain network.
Focusing on the interactions between miners and users, Liu et
al. [6] explored the economics of blockchain storage and iden-
tified some incentive issues related to the storage cost. More
recently, Ding et al. [7] designed an incentive mechanism that
drives IoT devices to purchase more computational power to
join the mining process, so as to build a secure blockchain
network while guaranteeing the profits of the blockchain
platform.
In this paper, we focus on a PoW-based blockchain mar-
ket composed of a blockchain platform (BP), miners and
blockchain users (BUs). To guarantee the security and privacy
of the blockchain, the BP attracts miners to contribute more
computing power by granting the PoW winner rewards. For
winning the PoW competition, each miner strategizes its
computing power individually. The winner not only receives
the BP’s rewards but also charges transaction fees from the
BUs for packing their transactions into the blockchain. The
BUs strategize the transaction fee to acquire a corresponding
service experience. We formulate these strategic interactions

ing the Stackelberg equilibrium in a backward inductive way,
we determine the optimal strategies which enable the entities
to achieve their maximal utilities.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• We propose a three-stage Stackelberg game modeling to
formulate the strategic interactions among the BP, miners,
and BUs in a blockchain market.
• We develop an analytical framework to solve the Stack-
elberg equilibrium, such that the optimal strategies of all

PoW competition is modeled as a non-cooperative game,
and the existence and uniqueness of its Nash equilibrium
are proved theoretically.
• We provide numerical results to demonstrate the strategic
interactive behaviors among the blockchain entities. The
results could give guidelines for the economic operations
in practical blockchain markets.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model and formulates the Stackelberg
game. We analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium in Section III.
Numerical results are provided in Section IV, followed by the
conclusion in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND STACKELBERG GAME
FORMULATION
In this section, we first introduce the PoW-based blockchain
system model involved in this study, and then formulate the
interactive behaviors among entities in the system as a three-
stage Stackelberg game.
A. PoW-based Blockchain System
As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider a PoW-based
blockchain service market that consists of three types of
entities, i.e., a blockchain platform (BP), multiple miners, and
blockchain users (BUs). In the PoW-based blockchain service
market, the BP maintains the PoW consensus and offers
blockchain services to the BUs. The larger computing power
the whole blockchain market owns, the harder it is for attackers
to tamper with the blockchain and then the more secure the

BP will be. Therefore, to realize sustainable development for
the blockchain market, the BP encourages the miners to adopt
larger computing power, by providing rewards (i.e., incentive
payments) to the miner who wins the PoW competition. Let
R, M = {m1,m2, · · · ,mN} and Pmi
denote the value of
rewards, the set of miners and the computing power of the
i-th miner, respectively, where N represents the number of
miners in the blockchain market. The PoW consensus scheme
deploys a transaction pool to deposit transactions sent by the
BUs. The miner who wins the PoW competition is able to
satisfy the requirements of BUs for recording transactions to
the blockchain, and it has the right to charge a fee for every
transaction. We assume the number of transactions included
in a block is constant and the fee paid by BUs for recording
every transaction is the same, which are denoted as B and
fu, respectively. The BUs expect a low delay, denoted as du,
for adding the block which contains their transactions into the
blockchain, and du is assumed to be inversely proportional to
the fee fu paid by BUs.
B. Stackelberg Game Formulation
As illustrated in Fig. 2, we model the interactive behaviors
among the BP, miners, and BUs in the blockchain market as
a three-stage Stackelberg game [8], [9].
1) Stage I (BP Rewards Strategizing): For security en-
hancement, the BP stimulates the miners to contribute their
computing power by granting rewards to the miner who wins
the PoW competition. Thus, the benefit that BP receives
increases as the miners’ computing power increases. How-
ever, the incremental speed of BP’s benefit should gradually
diminish when the computing power gets larger, due to the
generic economic law of “diminishing marginal return” [10].
Therefore, we formulate the BP’s utility function as
Up =
λ
1 + 1∑
mi∈M Pmi
−R, (1)
where λ is a positive system parameter that reflects the degree
of importance of miners’ computing power viewed by the BP.
By strategizing the value of rewards R appropriately, the BP
aims to achieve its maximal utility.
2) Stage II (Miner Computing Power Determination): Min-
ers join the PoW competition by contributing their computing
power. Thus, the strategy of miner mi is its computer power

Pmi
. We use Pm = {Pm1
, Pm2
, · · · , PmN
} to denote the
strategy profile including all miners’ strategies, and P−mi
to denote the strategy profile excluding Pmi
, i.e., Pm =
(Pmi
,P−mi
). We consider that the probability of winning the
PoW competition is proportional to the computing power a
miner adopts, and the unit cost of computing power is c. Then,
taking both the return (i.e., BP’s rewards and BUs’ transaction
fee) and cost (i.e., power consumption) into consideration, we
formulate the utility function Umi
of miner mi as
Umi
=
Pmi
∑
j∈M Pmj
(R+Bfu)− cPmi
. (2)
Note that in the PoW competition, miners compete with
each other individually to maximize their own utilities by de-
termining computing power strategically. Thus, the PoW com-
petition among miners can be modeled as a non-cooperative
game. We use G = (M, {Pm}, {Umi
}) to denote the PoW
competition, where M, {Pm}, {Umi
} represent the sets of
players (i.e., miners), strategy profiles and utility functions,
respectively. A fundamental problem arising from the non-
cooperative game is that whether there is a stable strategy
profile such that no miner can gain more utility by unilater-
ally changing its current strategy. The stable strategy profile
corresponds to the concept of Nash equilibrium (NE) in Game
Theory [11], which can be defined as follow.
Definition 1 (Nash Equilibrium): A strategy profile P
ne
m =
(Pne
m1
, Pne
m2
, · · · , Pne
mN
) is a Nash Equilibrium of the PoW
competition, if for any miner mi and any strategy Pmi
≥ 0
we have
Umi
(Pne
mi
,Pne
−mi
) ≥ Umi
(Pmi
,Pne
−mi
). (3)
3) Stage III (BUs Transaction Fee Decision): The BUs
pay fees to the miner for packing their transactions into the
blockchain. The corresponding delay du is inversely propor-
tional to the transaction fee fu, i.e., du = θ
fu
, where θ ∈ (0, 1]
is a parameter that controls the BUs’ sensitivity to the delay
for packing the transactions into the blockchain. That is, BUs
with a larger θ are more sensitive to the delay and need to pay
more fees to receive a satisfactory effect. By following [12],
we formulate the BUs’ utility function as
Uu = α ln(β − du)− fu = α ln(β − θ
fu
)− fu, (4)
where α and β are positive system parameters, and the first
term in logarithmic form is widely adopted to evaluate the
satisfaction degree of BUs. Equation (4) indicates the BUs’
satisfaction degree is negatively correlated with the service
delay and will deteriorate more seriously as the delay becomes
higher, which is in accordance with the intuition. By deciding
an appropriate transaction fee fu, the BUs aim to achieve the
maximal utility.
III. STACKELBERG EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE)
for the three-stage Stackelberg game in a backward inductive
way. Specifically, we first analyze the BUs’ optimal strategy
in Stage III. Then, we go backward and analyze the optimal
strategy profile of miners in Stage II based on the result in
Stage III. Finally, we reach Stage I and analyze the BP’s
optimal strategy. The joint results in the three stages constitute
the SE.
A. Stage III: BUs’ Optimal Strategy
The goal of BUs is to maximize their utility by deciding
the optimal transaction fee strategically. Therefore, the utility
maximization for BUs can be formulated as the following
mathematical optimization problem:
max
fu
Uu(fu) = α ln(β − θ
fu
)− fu (5a)
s.t.
θ
β − 1
< fu < α lnβ, (5b)
where the constraint (5b) follows from the non-negativity of
the feasible domain of a logarithmic function as well as the
non-negativity of the BUs’ utility (otherwise, the BUs will not
purchase the service from the blockchain market).
To solve the optimization problem (5), we utilize the method
of Lagrange multipliers with KKT conditions. By introducing
two Lagrange multipliers κ and γ as well as two slack
variables η and ω, we construct the Lagrangian function for
the above optimization problem as
L(fu, κ, γ, η, ω) = α ln(β − θ
fu
)− fu + κ(fu − θ
β − 1
− η2)
+ γ(fu − α lnβ + ω2). (6)
By setting the first-order derivative of L with respect to each
variable equal to zero, we obtain a system of equations. Then,
by solving the system of equations and mapping the solutions
into the feasible domain, the optimal strategy of BUs, i.e., the
optimal transaction fee f∗
u paid by BUs, can be decided as
f∗
u =
θ +
√

√
θ + 4αβ
2β
. (7)
The detailed algebraic operations for solving the system of
equations are omitted here due to the space limitation.
B. Stage II: Miners’ Optimal Strategy Profile
The PoW competition among miners is modeled as a
non-cooperative game G = (M, {Pm}, {Umi
}). To achieve
its maximal utility, each miner will adopt its best response
strategy in the PoW competition, which is defined as follows.
Definition 2 (Best Response Strategy): Given P−mi
, a
strategy is the best response strategy of miner mi, de-
noted as bi(P−mi
), if it satisfies Umi
(bi(P−mi
),P−mi
) ≥
Umi
(Pmi
,P−mi
) for all Pmi
≥ 0.
By reviewing the definition of NE, we know that the
strategy a miner adopts in an NE is its best response strategy.
Therefore, the strategy profile of all miners in the PoW
competition will converge to an NE, if it exists. Let b(Pm) =
(b1(P−m1
), b2(P−m2
), · · · , bN (P−mN
)), which is termed as
the best response correspondence of the strategy profile Pm.
Then, an NE of the game is actually a fixed point of the best

response correspondence, i.e., Pne
m = b(Pne
m ). Before proving
the existence and uniqueness of NE in the PoW competition,
we provide the following propositions.
Proposition 1: An NE exists in a non-cooperative game,
if: 1) the set of strategy profiles of players is a non-empty,
compact, and convex subset of the N -dimensional Euclidean
space R
N and 2) the utility function of a player is concave on
the strategy of this player, for every player in the game [13,
Theorem 1].
Proposition 2: Function b(Pm) is standard if for all Pm >
0, the following properties are satisfied [14]:
• Positivity: b(Pm) > 0.
• Monotonicity: if Pm ≥ P
′
m, then b(Pm) ≥ b(P
′
m).
• Scalability: for all φ > 1, φb(Pm) > b(φPm).
Proposition 3: If the function b(Pm) is standard, then its
fixed point is unique [15, Theorem 1].
Then, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1: The PoW competition game has a unique NE.
Proof: We first prove the existence of NE and then prove
the uniqueness of NE.
1) Existence: Note that the strategy of miner mi is Pmi
≥
0. Thus, the strategy space of the PoW competition game
{Pm} is a non-empty, compact, and convex subset of the N -
dimensional Euclidean space R
N . Given the optimal strategy
of BUs f∗
u and any strategy of BP R, we take the first- and
second-order derivatives of Umi
with respect to Pmi
, which
yields

(8) shows Umi
is continuous and differentiable on Pmi
, and
(9) indicates the second-order derivative of Umi
with respect
to Pmi
is negative. Thus, Umi
is a concave function of Pmi
.
According to Proposition 1, the PoW competition game exists
at least an NE.
2) Uniqueness: Since Umi
is a concave function of Pmi
,
we can obtain the best response strategy bi(P−mi
) by solving
∂Umi
∂Pmi
= 0, that is
(R+Bf∗

. (11)
If Pmi
> 0, it is the best response strategy of miner mi due
to the concavity of Umi
. When Pmi
< 0, it indicates that the
miner will not join the PoW competition by setting Pmi
= 0.
Hence, bi(P−mi
) can be determined as (12), as shown at the
bottom of this page. We can see that for a miner mi who joins
the PoW competition, its best response function bi(P−mi
) is
always positive and monotonic. In addition, for ∀φ > 1 we
have
φbi(P−mi
)− bi(φP−mi
)
=(φ−
√

√
(R+Bf∗
u)
∑
j 6=i Pmj
c
> 0, (13)
which indicates φb(Pm) > b(φPm) holds. Therefore, b(Pm)
is standard and its fixed point is unique. Accordingly, the PoW
competition game has a unique NE.
Then, we have the following theorem regarding the optimal
strategy of a miner in the PoW competition.
Theorem 2: The optimal strategy of miner mi in the PoW
competition is given by
Pne
mi
=
(R+Bf∗
u)(N − 1)
c ·N2
. (14)
Proof: Note that the optimal strategy profile of miners in
the PoW competition converges to the unique NE, which satis-
fies equation (10). Performing some algebraic transformations
on (10) yields
Pne
mi
=
∑
mj∈M
Pne
mj
−
c
(
∑
mj∈M Pne

R+Bf∗

. (15)
By calculating the sum on both sides of (15) over the set of
miners M, we have

and thus

=
(R+Bf∗

. (17)
Substituting (17) into (15) and performing some algebraic
transformations, equation (14) can be obtained.
This completes the proof.
C. Stage I: BP’s Optimal Strategy
Based on the above analysis, for any given BP’s rewards
R, the optimal strategies of BUs and miners are determinable.
That is, the BP can anticipate the behaviors of BUs and miners,
and then optimize its own strategy accordingly. Substituting

It indicates that Up is continuous and differentiable on R and

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide numerical results to demonstrate
the interaction behaviors among the entities in the blockchain
market under the variation of system parameters. Without loss
of generality, we set λ = 15, α = 2, β = 4 and B = 1 in the
simulations.
We plot Fig. 3 to show how the utilities of the BP and miners
varies with the BP’s rewards R, where we set the number of
miners in the blockchain market N = 1000 and the BUs’

Fig. 4. Effects of BUs’ delay-sensitivity parameter θ on the optimal strategies
and utilities.
delay-sensitivity parameter θ = 0.5. It can be observed from
Fig. 3 that the miner’s utility increases linearly as the BP’s
rewards R increases. This is because the growth of rewards
can raise the expected profit of every miner in the market.
On the other hand, the BP’s utility first increases and then
decreases as R gets larger. There exists an optimal strategy
R∗ for the BP to maximize its utility. Accordingly, the miner
in fact can only achieve its maximal utility under the given
rewards R∗.
We summarize in Fig. 4 the effects of BUs’ delay sensitivity
parameter θ on the optimal strategies and utilities. We can
observe from Fig. 4(a) that as the BUs become more sensitive
to the delay for packing their transactions into the blockchain,
the BUs’ optimal strategy f∗
u monotonically increases, while
the optimal BP’s rewards R∗ monotonically decreases. This is
because as θ gets larger, the BUs need to pay more transaction
fees to receive a lower delay and so as to achieve the maximal
utility. As a result that the miners have received more profits
from the BUs, the BP can reduce its rewards so as to save its
costs. Fig. 4(b) shows that a larger θ contributes to a higher
utility for the BP but reduces the utility for the BUs. Such
behaviors correspond to the trends in Fig. 4(a), as an entity’s
utility is negatively correlated to its costs. Fig 4 indicates that
in the blockchain market, the BP prefers to serve the BUs who
require a lower delay.

Fig. 5. Effects of the number of miners on the optimal BP’s and miner’s
strategies.
We summarize in Fig. 5 the behaviors of the BP’s optimal
rewards and the miner’s optimal computing power under
the variation of the number of miners in the blockchain
market, where we set the unit cost of computing power
c ∈ {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2} and the delay-sensitivity parameter θ =
0.5. We can observe from Fig. 5(a) that as the number of
miners scales up, the rewards offered by the BP, i.e., the
BP’s optimal strategy, first goes down and then tends to be
steady gradually. It can be intuitively explained that as N
increases the computing power in the market becomes larger
and then saturated, so the BP doesn’t need to make efforts for
stimulating miners and thus can reduce its rewards. Fig. 5(b)
shows that the optimal computing power adopted by a miner in
the PoW competition monotonically decreases as the number
of miners in the market gets larger. This is because as N
increases the competition for winning the PoW game becomes
more intense and the BP’s rewards will be reduced, and then
each miner needs to save its costs for achieving its maximal
utility. Another observation of Fig. 5 is that a higher unit cost
of computing power will lead to a larger R∗ but a smaller
P ∗
mi
. This is due to the fact that when c is large, the miner
will reduce the computing power to save its costs, while the
BP will offer more rewards to compensate the miners’ costs
such that the miners can provide sufficient computing power
for the blockchain market.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the interactions among
the entities in a blockchain market from a game-theoretic
perspective. By identifying the utilities of the blockchain
platform, miners and blockchain users, we have constructed a
three-stage Stackelberg game-based modeling. For the Stack-
elberg game, we have proposed an analytical framework to
solve the equilibrium in a backward inductive way, such
that the optimal strategies of different entities were obtained.
The results of this study reveal the essential behaviors of
blockchain entities and provide insights into economic opera-
tions in practical blockchain markets.
