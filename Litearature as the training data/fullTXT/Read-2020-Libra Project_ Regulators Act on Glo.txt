Libra Project: Regulators Act on Global Stablecoins
Governments, regulatory authorities and standard-setting bodies started acting on global 
stablecoins triggered by the Libra announcement. Among the concerns expressed by the 
G7 and the G20 are risks to the stability of the fi nancial system. The Financial Stability 
Board and the Financial Action Task Force have worked on regulatory issues and anti-
money laundering ahead of the G20 summit in November 2020. Overall the Libra project has 
raised many questions on the regulatory front. Facebook had to revise the concept as Libra 
2.0 and resubmit it for approval in April 2020. The European Commission announced a new 
regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) including stablecoins in September 2020 as 
part of a new Digital Finance Package. This opens the next chapter in a regulatory cat and 
mouse game.

“Libra’s mission is to enable a simple global currency and 
fi nancial infrastructure that empowers billions of people” 
(Libra Association, 2019a, 1). On 18 June 2019, the Libra 
project, Facebook’s new cryptocurrency structured as a 
‘stablecoin’, was announced with an intended launch in 
early 2020 (Brühl, 2020, 54). The internet services provided 
by the Facebook group (including Facebook, Instagram, 
WhatsApp, Messenger) have a global reach of almost 3 
billion users, alone 2.4 billion via Facebook. Not surpris-
ingly, regulators and central banks at the international level 
have been concerned by the potential impact on investor 
protection, fi nancial stability and market integrity (Europe-
an Securities and Markets Authority, 2019, 33).
Stablecoins
The term stablecoin, as used by market participants, de-
notes crypto-assets that are supposed to have a stable 
value over time (ECB Crypto-Assets Task Force, 2019, 14). 
The rise of stablecoins has been driven by the criticism on 
the signifi cant volatility seen in the price of cryptocurren-
cies. Before 2019, stablecoins slowly started drawing the 
attention of researchers and regulators, especially in con-
nection with central bank digital currencies, digital money 
and cross-border payments (Mancini-Griffoli et al., 2018).
Bullmann et al. (2019, 9) defi ne stablecoins as “digital 
units of value that are not a form of any specifi c currency 
(or basket thereof) but rely on a set of stabilisation tools 
which are supposed to minimise fl uctuations of their price 
in such currency”. To categorise stablecoins, the authors 
use three criteria of crypto-assets: (i) existence of an issu-
er that is responsible for satisfying any attached claims, 
(ii) decentralisation or centralisation of responsibilities 
over the stablecoin initiative and (iii) what underpins the 
value of a stablecoin and its stability in the currency of 
reference. So far, the following types of stablecoins have 
been observed:
• Tokenised funds. An issuer holds funds and is com-
mitted to the redeemability of the stablecoins, the 
safekeeping of the funds by a custodian, centralised 
responsibilities, e.g. Tether.
• Off-chain collateralised stablecoins. This model is 
backed by traditional asset classes like securities or 
commodities, safekeeping of the assets by a custo-
dian, centralised responsibilities.
• On-chain collateralised stablecoins. These are backed 
by other crypto-assets, with or without an issuer, and 
have decentralised responsibilities such as the Single 
Collateral DAI.

• Algorithmic stablecoins. These are backed by users’ 
expectations about the future purchasing power of 
their holding; they do not have an issuer but do have 
decentralised responsibilities, for example NuBits 
(ECB Crypto-Assets Task Force, 2020, 7).
Initial Libra concept
The Libra project is governed by the Libra Association un-
der Swiss law. The project is described in a white paper 
by the Libra Association and in various technical papers. 
The Libra Association was established by 21 founding 
members in October 2019. However, eight (including Visa, 
Mastercard, PayPal and eBay) of the initial 29 partners 
withdrew due to concerns about meeting regulatory ex-
pectations (Brühl, 2020) The intended launch has been 
delayed as too many regulatory issues remained unan-
swered.
Libra was conceived as a cryptocurrency backed by a 
basket of low-volatility assets like bank deposits and 
short-term government bonds in established fi at curren-
cies (Libra Association, 2019a, 7-8). Libra fi ts roughly into 
the category of tokenised funds. The value of the crypto-
currency can fl uctuate over time as a consequence of for-
eign exchange rate movements. Details on the functioning 
of the Libra Reserve are specifi ed in a technical paper by 
Calibra staff.1 The reserve would be held in a geographi-
cally distributed network of custodians with an investment 
grade credit rating. Users of Libra would not interact with 
the reserve, instead only ‘authorised resellers’ (not further 
specifi ed) would be able to transact large amounts of fi at 
currency and Libra with the reserve. The Libra Associa-
tion would mint and destroy coins in response to demand 
from the authorised resellers. Coins are minted when they 
purchase Libra and destroyed when they sell Libra at a 
price depending on the value of the basket of assets. The 
Libra Association controlling the Libra Reserve would act 
as a buyer of last resort, but unlike a central bank, would 
not set any monetary policy (Catalini et al., 2019).
In July 2019, Zetzsche et al. performed a detailed analysis 
of the Libra project with regards to the business model, 
corporate governance and regulatory concerns. In par-
ticular, the authors criticised the white paper’s silence on 
Libra Networks, a limited liability company under Swiss 
law already established in April 2019, which would likely 
be the company seeking regulatory approvals for fi nancial 
services. It also seems contradictory that fees and divi-
1 In May 2020, the Facebook group rebranded its subsidiary Calibra to 
Novi, as wallet provider for Libra. See Novi: Welcome to Novi, 26 May 
2020, available at https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-
novi/.
dend distributions would fl ow to the members of the as-
sociation, a non-profi t organisation.
For Adachi et al. (2020, 7), ECB staff, the Libra Reserve 
has the potential to become one of Europe’s largest mon-
ey market funds. The Libra Association disclosed that it 
would invest in a currency basket made of 50% USD, 18% 
EUR, 14% JPY, 11% GBP and 7% SGD. The share of the 
euro in the currency basket (18%) would be larger than 
the euro area’s share of the total user base of Facebook 
(10%). This could result in infl ows into euro area money 
markets (Adachi et al., 2020). The ECB Crypto-Assets 
Task Force differentiates three scenarios for the potential 
use of stablecoins: “crypto-assets accessory function” 
(considered as current state of the market), “new payment 
method” and “alterative store of value”. An extensive use 
of a stablecoin in the scenario, where a stablecoin be-
comes an ordinary means of payment, could affect the 
exchange rate channel of monetary policy. In particular, a 
multi-currency stablecoin like Libra might make it diffi cult 
to control domestic developments (ECB Crypto-Assets 
Task Force, 2020, 17-21).
Regulatory treatment of the initial Libra application 
under Swiss law
On 11 September 2019, the Libra Association (2019b) an-
nounced that it was seeking a payment system license 
under Swiss regulation. The Swiss Financial Market Su-
pervisory Authority (FINMA) confi rmed this request the 
same day (FINMA, 2019a). Simultaneously FINMA (2019b) 
issued a new supplement with criteria for the regulatory 
treatment of stablecoins under Swiss law. The stablecoin 
guidelines build upon the general guidelines for initial coin 
offerings from February 2018 which distinguished be-
tween payment, utility and asset function (FINMA, 2018). 
Libra would be seen as a hybrid token with both payment 
and asset function.
The stablecoin guidelines from September 2019 cover the 
regulatory treatment for various categories of stablecoins 
for indicative purposes, depending on the underlying as-
set that they are linked to (currencies, commodities, real 
estate, securities). Potential licensing requirements under 
the Banking Act or the Collective Investment Schemes 
Act may apply. The Anti-Money Laundering Act would be 
applicable for payment tokens and the Financial Market 
Infrastructure Act would also apply to payment systems 
of signifi cant importance. Table 1 shows an indicative su-
pervisory classifi cation as a function of the underlying as-
set to which they are linked.
In the FINMA press release of 11 September 2019, the 
regulator touched upon requirements likely to be applica-

ble to the Libra project. Due to the scope of the project, 
an internationally coordinated approach would be need-
ed, particularly with regards to the management and gov-
ernance of the Libra Reserve as well as money laundering 
issues (FINMA, 2019b).
Libra 2.0 concept
On 15 April 2020, the Libra Association published an up-
dated Libra concept with a white paper v2.0. The initiators 
highlight four major changes (Libra Association, 2020, 1-3):
1. “Offering single-currency stablecoins in addition to the 
multi-currency coin”: The Libra network would start 
with single-currency stablecoins for USD, EUR, GBP 
and SGD. The multi-currency Libra Coin (LBR) is still 
planned, but would be made out of single-currency 
coins being defi ned in terms of fi xed nominal weights 
(e.g. 50% USD, 18% EUR, 11% GBP, etc.) using a 
smart contract. Details were not disclosed.
2. “Enhancing the safety of the Libra payment system 
with a robust compliance framework”: Participants 
would now be distinguished in the categories desig-
nated dealers, regulated virtual asset service providers 
(in a FATF member jurisdiction), certifi ed virtual asset 
service providers approved by the Libra Association 
and unhosted wallets (i.e. all the others). The network 
would start with designated dealers and regulated vir-
tual asset service providers while a certifi cation pro-
cess is developed.
3. “Forgoing the future transition to a permissionless 
system while maintaining its key economic proper-
ties.”
4. “Building strong protections into the design of the Li-
bra Reserve”: The Reserve would invest at least 80% 
in short-term (up to three months remaining maturity) 
government securities issued by sovereigns that have 
very low credit risk (e.g. A+ rating from S&P and A1 
from Moody’s, or higher) and whose securities trade 
in highly liquid secondary markets. The remaining 
20% would be held in cash, with overnight sweeps into 
money market funds. Also, the Libra Reserve will get 
a capital buffer to absorb potential losses from credit, 
market and operational risks.
On the same day, FINMA confi rmed the receipt of an ap-
plication for a payment system license under Swiss law 
on the basis of Libra 2.0. FINMA (2020) reiterated that an 
international approach is required, hence it is in contact 
with more than 20 supervisory authorities and central 
banks worldwide and also contributing to working groups 
and organisations on the development of international 
standards on global stablecoins.
G7 act on stablecoins
The Libra announcement in June 2019 moved global 
stablecoins to the top of the agenda of the G7. The G7 
Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors conclud-
ed at a meeting in Chantilly, France, in July 2019, that 
stablecoins raised serious regulatory and systemic con-
cerns. Stablecoin initiatives and their operators would 
have to meet the highest standards of fi nancial regula-
tion in order to go ahead without affecting the stability 
of the fi nancial system. Facebook’s project, the big el-
ephant in the room, is not mentioned in the written an-
nouncement (G7 France, 2019a). The G7 presidency set 
up a new G7 Working Group on Stablecoins (G7 France, 
2019b).

In September 2019, the French and German Finance Min-
isters issued a joint statement warning against the Libra 
project because the documentation failed to convince 
them that risks identifi ed by the G7 would be properly ad-
dressed. Going even further, the ministers stated that no 
private entity should claim monetary power inherent to 
the sovereignty of nations (French Ministry of Economy 
and German Ministry of Finance, 2019).
At the G7 meeting in Washington in October 2019, G7 Fi-
nance Ministers and Central Bank Governors welcomed 
the report ‘Investigating the impact of global stablecoins’ 
by the G7 Working Group on Stablecoins (G7 France, 
2019c). The report points out the following critical issues 
that need to be solved (G7 Working Group on Stable-
coins, 2019):
• Stablecoin initiatives must ensure public trust by 
meeting the highest regulatory standards – including 
guidance from the international standard-setting bod-
ies – and be subject to prudent supervision and over-
sight.
• Stablecoin initiatives should demonstrate a sound le-
gal basis to ensure adequate protection and guaran-
tees to all stakeholders and users.
• The governance and risk management framework 
should ensure operational and cyber resilience.
• The management of the assets underlying the arrange-
ment must be safe, prudent, transparent and consist-
ent with the nature of obligations to the coin holders.
• Stablecoins may raise broader issues for the interna-
tional monetary system, in particular if they become a 
widespread substitute for cash and deposits in some 
economies.
The G7 Working Group on Stablecoins identifi ed chal-
lenges and risks of stablecoins for public policy, over-
sight and regulation regardless of scale as well as inher-
ent in potential global stablecoins (see Table 2). The G7 
believes that no global stablecoin project should begin 
operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight chal-
lenges and risks are adequately addressed (G7 France, 
2019c).
G20 and standard-setting bodies act on stablecoins
At their October 2019 meeting in Washington, G20 Fi-
nance Ministers and Central Bank Governors took the 
positions on stablecoins set by the G7. The G20 stated 
that global stablecoins and other similar arrangements 
with potential systemic footprints would give rise to seri-
ous public policy and regulatory risks (money laundering, 
illicit fi nance, and consumer and investor protection) to be 
evaluated and addressed before the launch (G20 Japan, 
2019). In February 2020, the new G20 presidency of Saudi 
Arabia reiterated that view and asked the Financial Stabil-
ity Board (FSB), the Committee on Payments and Market 
Infrastructures (CPMI) and other standard-setting bodies 
to develop a roadmap to enhance global cross-border 
payment arrangements by October 2020 (G20 Saudi Ara-
bia, 2020). This is a priority of the upcoming G20 summit 
in Riyadh (Carstens, 2020, 19).
In October 2019, the FSB Chair, Randal K. Quarles, in-
formed the G20 that the FSB is assessing how the exist-
ing regulatory framework applies to global stablecoins 
and whether any regulatory gaps need to be fi lled. The 
FSB formed its own working group on stablecoins (FSB, 
2019a). A report on regulatory issues of stablecoins out-
lines the following steps (FSB, 2019b, 3-4): (i) take stock 
of existing supervisory and regulatory approaches to 
stablecoins, (ii) consider whether they are adequate and 
effective in addressing fi nancial stability and systemic 
risk concerns, and (iii) advise on possible multilateral re-
sponses. In February 2020, the FSB Chair confi rmed that 
the review of approaches in the FSB member jurisdictions 
was completed and that the FSB has been tasked with 
coordinating the development of a roadmap for improv-
ing cross-border payment systems (FSB, 2020a). To pre-

pare, the FSB issued a combined report and consultation 
document in April 2020 on regulatory, supervisory and 
oversight challenges raised by global stablecoin arrange-
ments (FSB, 2020b). The paper contains a section on risks 
and vulnerabilities raised by global stablecoins, a sum-
mary of the stocktake undertaken in FSB jurisdictions, 
key standards from various international standard-setting 
bodies and last but not least ten high-level recommenda-
tions to authorities at the jurisdictional level, including the 
fi nal version of the ten high-level recommendations (FSB, 
2020c, 4). The fi nal report was published in October 2020 
(FSB, 2020c).
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international 
standard-setting body focused on Anti-Money Launder-
ing and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). 
In October 2019, the then FATF President Xiangmin Liu 
informed the G20 that both stablecoins and their service 
providers would be subject to the FATF standards either 
as Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers or as 
traditional fi nancial assets and their service providers. The 
FATF (2019a) intends to actively monitor stablecoins and 
will consider further clarifi cations on how the FATF stand-
ards apply to stablecoins and their service providers, as 
well as whether updates are necessary. The FATF issued 
a report in June 2020 on its analysis of AML/CFT risks as-
sociated with stablecoins. The preventive measures in the 
revised FATF Standards have worked to mitigate risks by 
so-called stablecoins, so no immediate amendment would 
be required. The FATF will review the implementation and 
impact of the revised Standards by June 2021 and con-
sider whether updates are necessary (FATF, 2020).
The International Organization of Securities Commis-
sions (IOSCO) is looking at stablecoins as well. The Chair 
of the IOSCO Board, Ashley Alder, warned in November 
2019 that stablecoins can include features that are typical 
of regulated securities. Therefore, the IOSCO principles 
and standards may apply to stablecoins depending on 
how they are structured, including those related to disclo-
sure, registration, reporting and liability for sponsors and 
distributors. The IOSCO agrees with the G20 that global 
stablecoins may give rise to a set of serious public poli-
cy and regulatory risks (IOSCO, 2019). In February 2020, 
the IOSCO published a report on the application of the 
IOSCO Principles to crypto-assets, without mentioning 
stablecoins (IOSCO, 2020a). A report on global stablecoin 
initiatives was issued a month later (IOSCO, 2020b). The 
paper defi nes a hypothetical case study which is reminis-
cent of Libra and explores how the existing IOSCO prin-
ciples and standards apply. It also contains a preliminary 
analysis of the application of the CPMI-IOSCO Principles 
for Financial Markets Infrastructures (PFMI) to three high-
level cases of stablecoin arrangements.
European Union institutions act on stablecoins
In December 2019, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Commission issued a joint statement 
on stablecoins based on the strict positions already artic-
ulated by the G7 and the G20. The EU institutions would 
act in cooperation with the ECB and with national and 
European supervisory authorities. The Council and the 
Commission are willing to take all necessary measures 
to ensure appropriate standards of consumer protection 
and orderly monetary and fi nancial conditions. No global 
stablecoin arrangement should begin operation in the EU 
until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and 
risks are adequately identifi ed and addressed (Council of 
the European Union, 2019).
The European Commission also launched a consultation 
on crypto-assets in December 2019 which ran until March 
2020. Eight of the 117 questions relate to stablecoins. The 
fi ndings would be considered for new EU legislation on 
crypto-assets including stablecoins (European Commis-
sion, 2019, 5).
Concerning the current EU regulatory framework, a re-
search note by ECB staff pointed out that a stablecoin 
arrangement could fall under a number of frameworks or 
none of them (in the latter case meaning a potential regu-
latory gap) (Adachi et al., 2020). Firstly, the stablecoin may 
qualify as e-money, hence the Second Electronic Money 
Directive would apply for the coin and its issuer. Second-
ly, the asset management function (e.g. Libra Reserve) 
may qualify as an investment fund, therefore the UCITS 
Directive, the AIFM Directive and the Money Market Fund 
Regulation (EU) may apply. Thirdly, the stablecoin may be 
regarded as equivalent to a deposit, so EU banking regu-
lation may apply.
A detailed study by the University of Antwerp requested 
by the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic 
and Monetary Affairs, published in April 2020, recom-
mends rulemaking on crypto-assets including global sta-
blecoins at the EU level to avoid regulatory arbitrage due 
to national initiatives that are not aligned (European Com-
mission, 2019).
In September 2020 an early draft version of a proposal 
for a regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) by 
the European Commission was leaked on the journal-
istic website politico.eu. The MiCA acronym draws an 
analogy to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
(MiFID II). Sven Giegold, Member of the European Parlia-
ment, confi rmed the authenticity of the leak and informed 
that the ECON adopted a report proposing a regulation of 
crypto-assets (Giegold, 2020).

On 24 September 2020 the European Commission an-
nounced the adoption of a new Digital Finance Package 
which includes a Digital Finance Strategy, a Retail Pay-
ments Strategy, a legislative proposal on digital opera-
tional resilience, and a provisional version of the MiCA 
legislative proposal (leaked two weeks before). The press 
release states (European Commission, 2020a) that the 
MiCA regulation should protect investors from risks and 
provide legal clarity and certainty for crypto-asset issuers 
and providers. The MiCA proposal document itself (Euro-
pean Commission, 2020b) is accompanied by provisional 
versions of the annexes (European Commission, 2020c), 
an impact assessment (European Commission, 2020d) 
and an executive summary of the impact assessment (Eu-
ropean Commission, 2020e).
The Commission stated that crypto-assets already sub-
ject to EU legislation would remain like that. For previous-
ly unregulated crypto-assets the Commission proposes a 
bespoke regime setting strict requirements for issuers of 
crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers. Safe-
guards include capital requirements, custody of assets, a 
mandatory complaint holder procedure available to inves-
tors, and rights of the investor against the issuer. Issuers 
of global stablecoins would be subject to more stringent 
capital requirements, liquidity management and interop-
erability requirements.
On 2 October 2020 the ECB published a report prepared 
by the Eurosystem High-Level Task Force on central bank 
digital currency (CBDC) on the possible issuance of a dig-
ital euro. The task force, made of experts from the ECB 
and the 19 national central banks of the euro area, identi-
fi ed possible scenarios that would require the issuance 
of a digital euro. A public consultation would start on 12 
October 2020 in parallel with experimentation, without 
prejudice to the fi nal decision by the Governing Council 
of the ECB (ECB, 2020a). By mid-2021 a decision would 
be taken whether to launch a digital euro project (ECB, 
2020b, 6). Although Libra itself is only mentioned in one 
footnote of the report, there is no doubt that the timing 
and the speed of the digital euro initiative is a reaction to 
the perceived threat posed by this global stablecoin pro-
ject.
Outlook
Politicians and regulators have no interest in allowing the 
rise of a global stablecoin to impact monetary policy and 
fi nancial stability. It is unclear whether Libra 2.0 will ac-
tually launch successfully. This will depend on how high 
the regulators worldwide are willing to raise the bar. At 
European level a clear message against the Libra project 
has just been sent with the MiCA regulation proposal by 
the European Commission and the announcement of a 
digital euro initiative by the ECB.
