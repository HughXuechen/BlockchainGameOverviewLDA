+e rise of blockchain has led to discussions on new governance models and the cooperation of multiple participants. Due to the
cognitive defects of the blockchain protocol in terms of intelligent contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations
(DAOs), it is often unclear as to how to make decisions about the evolution of blockchain applications. Many autonomous
organizations, with the support of network technologies such as blockchain, blindly absorb members and expand the scale of the
capital pool, while ignoring the cost advantage of traditional autonomous organizations based on social relations and mutual
supervision to fight information asymmetry. In this context, this study analyzes the evolutionary trend of autonomous orga-
nizations and their members’ strategies under different policy environments. To this end, under the digital economy background,
based on game theory, the evolutionary dynamics method, and the form of the mutual insurance organization, this study
constructs an evolutionary dynamics model of distributed autonomous organizations. +e results show that blind expansion
without review aggravates the overall risk pool’s moral hazard, in the context of mutual insurance. Organizational strategies, such
as risk pool splits, can effectively improve the risk pool’s operating performance and establish a benign competition elimination
mechanism. Driven by cooperation efficiency and split supervision based on homogeneous clustering, the comprehensive
application of the market elimination mechanism can effectively combat moral hazards, restrain the adverse effects of member
flow, expand the living space of small- and medium-sized insurance organizations, curb the emergence of a large-scale monopoly
risk pool, and improve market vitality.+ese conclusions and suggestions also apply to autonomous organizations based on social
relations and mutual supervision. +e results offer specific decision-making guidance and suggestions for the government,
insurance companies, and risk management.
1. Introduction
Various mutual and peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance com-
panies and other decentralized autonomous organizations
(DAOs) or decentralized autonomous companies (DACs),
typified by the use of blockchain, smart contracts, and other
digital technologies, have been blindly absorbing funds and
expanding while ignoring the participation of organiza-
tional members in autonomy. +is reflects a severe de-
parture from the objective of establishing an autonomous
organization and its organization and operation. In ad-
dition, the recent large-scale withdrawal of the members of
online mutual aid platforms and the flight of P2P financial
organizations have demonstrated the need to supervise
online mutual aid and similar platform autonomous eco-
nomic organizations.
Few studies have analyzed the given context against the
background of the digital economy by applying game theory
or combining specific application scenarios. However, there
has been a lack of emphasis on the specific organizational
structure. +e concept of distributed autonomous organi-
zations has recently received attention with the rise of
blockchain technology and various platform economies.
Since its emergence, mutual insurance has exhibited the key
elements and characteristics of a DAO, such as a one-person
vote, openness and transparency, and a decentralized au-
tonomy, under the background of the digital economy
proposed at present. +us, mutual insurance fits the context

of the blockchain technology, DAO, and platform economy
business model. However, an expansion of the capital scale
weakens the relationship between the regions, kinfolk, and
networks of the mutual insurance organizations based on
traditional supervisory functions.+ese organizations have a
high likelihood of facing serious moral hazards in the ab-
sence of adequate measures.
In this context, it must be noted that the DAO appli-
cations change the acceleration of organizational iterations,
rather than completely abandoning the traditional corporate
operation mode. For some time, the application scenarios of
DAO are expected to maintain the existing legal and social
structures of the organization and use the blockchain
technology to complete transparency-related tasks such as
record keeping. Given the significant time consumed to
make adaptive changes through the legal system, contract
specifications, and governance structure, among others,
DAOs can be used to implement organizational changes
owing to their compatibility with the traditional business
model. Additionally, DAOs are expected to offset the neg-
ative effects of capital expansion while accelerating orga-
nizational changes.
Organizations are composed of highly uncertain people;
this uncertainty also exists in the DAOs. Owing to the high
degree of human uncertainty and the complex decision-
making process, it is impossible to encode DAOs fully into a
smart contract, under the current technological level [1].
Despite accelerating information dissemination and orga-
nizational iteration, DAOs are limited by the fact that most
decision-making processes involving people may complete
off-chain [2]. Particularly, a series of liability and risk issues
(e.g., professional liability insurance) positively related to
human uncertainty relies on constant interaction and re-
peated games between people to clarify their cognition.
In this context, as shown in Figure 1, we focus on the
following problems that must be solved to promote the
development of the digital economy: how to manage virtual
organizations, establish a market mechanism of fair com-
petition, maximize cooperation, and prevent monopoly
operations? How does trust evolve in virtual organizations?
How can we implement policy measures and realize their
effects? In the next 5–10 years, DAOs may be able to solve
these problems and code into smart contracts using
blockchain technology [3]. +is aspect also brings the
subsequent quantitative analysis closer to practical appli-
cation scenarios. +e analysis focuses on how management
ability contributes toward building trust and incentives. +e
mathematical framework captures the roles of management
practices and the supervision system in team building, spin-
off, bankruptcy, and other organizational measures. +is
study aimed to determine the key measures for successfully
managing virtual organizations and their effect on the or-
ganization’s evolution.
+e remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 reviews the literature on the optimal organization
size in relation to the governance of autonomous organi-
zations. Section 3 constructs the evolutionary dynamics of
autonomous mutual insurance organizations, based on
game theory and an evolutionary dynamics model. Section 4
analyzes and discusses the model’s results, and Section 5
provides conclusions and suggestions.
2. Literature Review
As shown in Figure 1, we begin with human community
organizations, followed by mutual insurance organizations
with special functional requirements, and subsequently
move to distributed autonomous organizations under the
block chain economy to review the existing literature. We
selected papers for our review according to the keywords in
Table 1.+e papers were identified using theWeb of Science,
Wiley Online Library, and Microsoft Academic databases.
2.1.  reshold of the Average Size of Human Community
Organizations. Transcending communities and races to
facilitate large-scale cooperation supporting complete and
efficient cooperation is the most significant human potential.
Cooperation represents the underlying behavior support
generated by monopolistic economic activities. Monopoly is
caused by unregulated expansion of capital and ignoring
moral hazards. Positive collaboration and cooperation serve
as effective means and institutional guarantees to fight
monopoly. In autonomous organizations, the optimal or-
ganization size is one of the critical issues for promoting
cooperation. It is also one of the essential research questions
in anthropology, sociology, and other disciplines. Re-
searchers often use data on the neocortical volume, pop-
ulation size, and behavioral ecology variables to examine the
relationships between the variables [4, 5]. Dunbar [6] pre-
viously verified that group size is a relative cortical volume
function, whereas ecological variables are not. In other
words, the size of a community is not determined by the
ecological environment in which a species is located, but it is
more restricted by its cortical volume. Casari and Claudio
[7] found that the upper limit of community size is 150
people, consistent with Dunbar’s coefficient of 150 people.
+e social activities in human society still follow this rule,
even with today’s highly developed social network tech-
nology [8, 9]. In online social groups, most personal net-
works present three or four circles as in the classical Dunbar
structure, with a size comparable to the one initially de-
scribed by Dunbar [20]. Small online autonomous com-
munities with no more than 40 people can be managed
democratically, but communities with more than 40 people
need a leadership team structure [21].
2.2. Upper Limit of the Average Pool Size ofMutual Insurance.
Similarly, the size of the primary risk pool of mutual in-
surance also has an upper limit. +ere is consensus on this
finding in academia. However, the specific number and size
depend on the research assumptions. In terms of experi-
mental evidence, Abbink et al. [10] believed that the benefits
of cooperation and mutual risk-sharing realized through an
increase in scale can be offset by an increase in the number of
free riders, thus creating a social dilemma. Murgai et al. [11],
based on the analysis of water mutual insurance organiza-
tions in Pakistan, showed that community characteristics,
2 Complexity
transaction and cooperation costs, and other factors restrict
the risk pool’s size of mutual insurance. +rough an em-
pirical study, Adams et al. [12] showed that a mutual-system
company’s size correlates positively with the claim premium
proportion. In other words, the larger the company, the
higher the proportion of policy claims.
In terms of the theoretical model, Barigozzia et al. [13]
proved that if there are optional cooperative strategies in the
insurance market, then cooperation between policyholders
can internalize incentives and positively impact premiums.
Regardless of the pool size, cooperative strategies are the
optimal equilibrium with the highest efficiency. From the
perspective of pool size, small-scale pools can more effec-
tively promote cooperation. Von Bieberstein et al. [14] also
believed that, in the case of all kinds of homogeneous
professional risk, while individuals obtain benefits from the
risk pool, the risk pool scale is restricted by free-riding
behavior that cannot be expanded unlimitedly. Using the
lowest average risk and reducing the effect of moral hazard
on the risk pool’s return, Eisenhauer [15] deduced the
optimal size of the risk pool to be 200–400. Aase [16] used
game theory and other research methods. +is proves that
maritime mutual insurance companies’ development trends
evolve toward a medium scale under the equilibrium state.
In terms of the historical induction, by combining the
development history of mutual insurance in the Netherlands
for several centuries, van Leeuwen [17] found that the ex-
cessive size of the early guilds hindered the development of
mutual insurance. For 1940–1960, the disorderly expansion
of the organization size also reduced its ability to fight
against moral hazard. As per Valgren [18], during
1900–1930, the legal size and capital requirements for setting
up an agricultural fire mutual insurance in the United States
were as follows: number of incorporators 25 to 50, property
exceeding $50,000, and minimum membership size of 25.
Guinnane and Streb [19] showed that the expansion of the

German Mutual Insurance for Miners (KV) contributed to
its continued decline in social foundation. In this case, a
larger KV organization does not have a better way to deal
with information asymmetry. Measures such as hospitali-
zation and on-site verification improve the foundation to a
certain extent, but they weaken the trust relationship be-
tween KVs and mutual organizations.
2.3. Distributed Autonomous Organization Governance in the
Context of Blockchain. Governance is not straightforward in
blockchains and DAOs due to their networked nature.
Governance represents the framework for decision rights,
incentives, and accountabilities to encourage desirable be-
havior in the use of resources [22]. However, research on the
governance of DAOs is still relatively sparse, especially for
the specific functional requirement of distributed autono-
mous organizations. +e existing research mainly identifies
the shortcomings of DAO governance. However, there are
no corresponding governance measures. At present, there
exist three misconceptions about the applicability of
blockchain technology to many DAOs in general and the
sharing economy in particular (trust-free fallacy, disinter-
mediation fallacy, and consumer will fallacy). Blockchain
technology does not inherently solve all trust issues when it
comes to real-world interactions between human beings: the
trust-free fallacy [23]. In autonomous organizations, in-
cluding mutual insurance, there is a nonlinear relationship
between the optimal scale and the threshold range that limits
the size of the autonomous group, which is a necessary
condition for sustainable cooperation behavior. However,
the specific threshold distribution differs owing to the
various assumptions of future distributed autonomous or-
ganizations based on blockchain technology, which will also
be restricted by the organization’s size. It is therefore very
important to study DAO governance.
3. Research Methods
+e Social Brain Hypothesis suggests that there is a “natural”
group size of around 150 for humans [24, 25]. Many studies
verify that the relationships in a user’s personal network
follow Dunbar’s property or the rule of 150, with a com-
parable size [20]. +ere is considerable evidence that
groupings of this size are characteristic of personal social
networks, both offline and online [7, 8, 26, 27]. +erefore,
the basic hypothesis is that the risk pool has a threshold of
150 members. +e subsequent analysis is based on this
hypothesis.
+is study focused on the antimonopoly and incentive
mechanism design of distributed autonomous organizations as
a social dilemma under uncertainty. Since different DAOs have
different organizational visions, mechanism analysis cannot be
carried out under a unified framework. Hence, the mutual
insurance organization, which is widely used and has extended
organizational practice history, was taken as the research object.
3.1. Basic Assumptions and Conceptual Models. We built a
mathematical model by combining the current operation
scenarios of DAOs (Mutual DAO System, Aragon, and
TeamBrella) using the blockchain and other technologies
and based on the traditional mutual insurance model. We
considered the organizational and management impacts of
the gradual upgradation of technology applications in the
next 5–10 years. We combined the basic assumptions with
the actual operating scenarios (https://mutualdao.org/cn/,
https://aragon.org/, https://teambrella.com/#). Based on the
above basic models, we undertook the following processes:
(i) First, we selected uncertain subjective risks posi-
tively related to people, such as professional liability
insurance.
(ii) Second, we assumed the availability of digital cur-
rency and the payment of digital cash by the team
members. +e wallet’s private key stores only the
respective client system, and there is no external
transmission.
(iii) +ird, we set the threshold value of pool members to
150; it must be noted that the large scale of the
meeting weakens the effect of mutual supervision
among members.
(iv) Fourth, the participation of insurance members was
divided into two types, cooperation and betrayal, to
proxy for the actual level of risk and the level of
concealment of their truthful public disclosure.
(v) Fifth, after the risk pool reached the threshold, we
divided the pool into two or more new pools to
prevent bankruptcy because of the weakening of the
mutual supervision function.
Under themutual insurance application background, the
distributed autonomous system mainly includes members,
systems, and fund layers. Figure 2 shows the composition
and the operating mechanism of the DAO system. It is the
primary medium for members to communicate, vote, make
decisions, and exchange values.+e capital layer represents a
virtual capital pool built on digital currencies and smart
contracts.
As shown in Figure 3, based on the DAOmodel’s mutual
supervision with the help of blockchain technology, mem-
bers decide through voting and realize the organization’s
decision-making power. Even their voting rights can be
delegated to other familiar members, thereby establishing a
chain of trust. +e application of digital technology makes it
easier for members to develop mutual trust and eliminate
intermediary agents and centralized fund circulation. Each
member’s claim is settled through other members’ premium
payments, significantly reducing unfair prices and malicious
behavior.
As shown in Figure 4, each venture capital pool is mainly
involved in survival competition. As the main index, the
survival probability was measured by the average cooper-
ation rate of the pool members. Pool-level events mainly
included spin-off (fission into more than two pools) and
bankruptcy (extinction). +e prisoner’s dilemma was the
primary game played among the pool members, and the
events at the individual-member-level mainly included the
insurance (entering the pool), transfer (interpool flow), and

agreed-upon transactions would be enforced autonomously, following rules defined by smart contracts. +e blockchain economy would
manifest as a new form of organizational design, DAOs, which are organizations with governance rules specified in the blockchain. Member
autonomy, one-person-one-vote rules, and the risk- and benefit-sharing principles of mutual insurance comprise an organizational form
perfectly compatible with blockchain technology.

elimination (getting out). We focused on the impact of the
organizational and management measures taken after the
essential risk pool size reaches the threshold (150 members)
on the overall level of cooperation, trust, and pool capacity.
+e color of the risk pool in Figure 4 represents the
cooperation rate of its members in the pool. +e higher the
cooperation rate, the better the quality of the risk pool
funds, the higher the probability of survival, and the higher
the quality of participating members. Conversely, the lower
the cooperation rate, the higher the proportion of the
insurance fraud. +e higher the probability of fraudulent
insurance premiums, the worse is the corresponding risk
pool funds’ quality, and the greater is the probability of
bankruptcy.
3.2. Mathematical Framework. Several scholars have inte-
grated evolution with game theory to develop evolutionary
game theory, a popular framework for describing individual
interactions and overall changes in theoretical biology,
economics, and sociology [28–39]. Based on the work of
Damuth and Heisler [40], Okasha [41, 42], Champagnat
et al. [43], and Simon [44], we constructed the two-layer
mutual insurance pool selection and evolutionary dynamics
models that adopt the classic prisoner’s dilemma game at the
individual and pool levels, respectively [43–47].+e research
problem can be further abstracted as a prisoner’s dilemma
problem in taking members’ premium payments as a public
good to realize risk-sharing.
+emodel construction starts from themicrodescription
of the risk pool of the mutual insurance unit. Insured in-
dividuals’ strategy characteristics directly affect their returns
and indirectly affect the operational quality of the insured
risk pool. +e mathematical model, comprising the mem-
bers of a mutual insurance risk pool (like a biological
population), can be viewed as a population system with
random interactions [48]. +e state function θt describes the
phenotype of each insured member. +e insured individual
and the overall phenotype of the risk pool at time t depend
only on the state function θt−1 at the previous time. +e
interaction between individual members and the overall
change in the risk pool can be observed by adjusting the
Markov process parameters:

In the differential equation of equation (1), x and y are
real values and not integer values, respectively. +ey do not
affect the overall modeling or the accuracy of the results.
Simon [44] proved that the continuous deterministic
model state is consistent with the results of the discrete
random model. +e pool can be understood as a unified
organization with integer collaborators and traitors, close
to its value(x, y). In equation (1), θt(x, y) is the state
function of the overall risk pool at time t. +e right side of
Equation pt(x, y) represents the events at the risk pool
level, mainly including the R(x,y) establishment, spin-off,
and bankruptcy of the risk pool. +e establishment of the
risk pool accompanies a larger pool split at the last mo-
ment, during which some risk pools may die out owing to a
spin-off. +e two partial derivative terms on the right side
of the equation correspond to changes within the pool
R(x,y), which is caused by the cooperative and defection
strategies of members in the pool and the transfer of
members between pools. In other words, the partial de-
rivative terms correspond to the dynamics at the individual
level, while the other terms correspond to the dynamics at
the risk pool level:

+e prisoner’s dilemma game matrix among members
in the pool is shown in equation (2), and the survival rate of
members in the pool at time t is proportional to their game
payoff. b> 0 denotes the cooperation benefits, and c> 0 is
the cost of providing public goods. If c ≈ 0, there is almost
no advantage in adopting a deception strategy, and if c> b,
there is no prisoner’s dilemma problem, given that we focus
on the impact at the macropolicy level, and b> c can
simulate the dilemma of the real macrolevel public risk
pool. +e individual member and overall survival rate of
the risk pool and indicators also depend on other pa-
rameters, and hence, the exact values of b and c are not so
significant here:

+e game between members of an organization is not
entirely random. It is related to the trust established on the
basis of usual social relationships, reflecting the autonomy
concept of mutual insurance based on social relationships.
Individuals with high levels of trust are more likely to have
interactive relationships. As shown in equation (3), the
model uses the parameter r ∈ [0, 1] to characterize indi-
viduals’ trust. It is described in mathematical language as
follows: the probability r that members choose the same
strategy type and randomly select other members of different
strategy types to conduct game interaction activities with a
probability of 1 − r.
+e expected returns of the cooperator and defector in
the pool are as follows:(x, y),

+e average survival rate of the cooperators and de-
fectors in the pool (x, y) is set to sβc(x, y) and sβd(x, y), and
the parameter is the regulation parameter. s> 0 here, where
the survival rate not only represents the operation time of
the pool but also determines its ability to absorb new
members. +e higher the survival rate, the longer the sur-
vival time, and the stronger the ability to absorb new
members. +e average dropout rates of both the collabo-
rators and defectors were the same and proportional to the
size of the group:
δc(x, y) � δd(x, y) � d(x + y). (5)
+e model also includes the event in which members
flow between different risk pools. +e purpose of setting the
turnover rate parameter is to simulate a malicious insurance
fraud event that may exist in the insurance market through
frequent flows to cover its high-risk nature. Each individual
flows out of the original risk pool at a rate μ and randomly
joins another risk pool. Ct and Dt, respectively, represent the
total number of cooperators and defectors in the population
at moment t, and Pt is the total number of members at
moment t. +e above values can be calculated using the state
function θt(x, y):
Pt � 􏽚 􏽚 θt(x, y)dxdy,
Ct � 􏽚 􏽚 xθt(x, y)dxdy,
Dt � 􏽚 􏽚 yθt(x, y)dxdy.
(6)
Correspondingly, the outgoing collaborator in any pool
(x, y) is μx, and the inflow is μ(Ct/Pt), where Ct/Pt is the
average number of collaborators included in the risk pool.
Similarly, the betrayers flow out at a rate of μy and flow into
any risk pool at a rate of μ(Dt/Pt). +e dynamic equation in
the pool is expressed in the following equation:

+e rate of the pool (x, y) splitting of the model is
f(x, y) � λ(x + y). (8)
Complexity 7
Splitting density is
h((x, y), (u, v)) � (1 − ψ)h1((x, y), (u, v))
+ ψh2((x, y), (u, v)).
(9)
where ψ ∈ [0, 1] is the split correlation coefficient. When
ψ � 0, there is no correlation split, and all splits allocate two
types of members in a completely random manner. When
ψ � 1, the fission density is h2. At this time, all the collaborators
will be in one part, and all the defectors will be in another part,
that is, h((x, y), (u, v)) � δ((x,y)�(u,0)) + δ((x,y)�(0,v)).
In the insurance market, the small pool is more likely to
become bankrupt because of the low fund reserves in the
competitive environment. +is factor also explains why the
insurance is set to the minimum capital supervision. In this
context, it must be noted that excessive free-riding in the risk
pool, owing to the tragedy of the commons, will lead to
moral hazard and ultimately bankruptcy. To simulate the
above real supervision and operation situation and observe
the impact of relevant policies on the overall risk pool’s
evolution trend, we set the following parameters: the exit
rate functions e(x, y, P) increase with an increase in the
number of risk pools, decrease with an increase in the risk
pool’s size, and decrease with an increase in group coop-
erators. +is is similar to the selective extinction model in
biology:
e(x, y, P) �
e0P
(ϕx + y)
2. (10)
where e0 ≥ 0 is the initial exit rate parameter and ϕ is the
pool exit intervention coefficient. If ϕ � 1, the exit of the risk
pool depends only on the size of the risk pool and is un-
related to the proportion of cooperation in the risk pool. If
ϕ> 1, then the most cooperative group is in favor, and if
ϕ< 1, the most noncooperative risk pool is more survivable.
Finally, the initial conditions of all risk pools in the
overall mutual insurance market follow a two-dimensional
normal distribution with the center (C0, D0):

+e first two items in brackets in equation (12) are the
spin-off and exit rates of (8) and (10), respectively, and the
third item is the establishment rate of a new risk pool (x, y)
accompanied by the spin-off event of a larger risk pool at the
last moment. To simplify the analysis, we set the parameter ρ
to measure together the incidence of events at all risk pool
levels. +e overall model is equivalent to solving equations
(1) and (12) and αc
t(x, y),αc
t(x, y) in equation (7).
Equation (1) has no closed solution, but we can obtain
the equation’s numerical solution using the Monte Carlo
method. +e key is to set an appropriate number of itera-
tions, that is, the value T. To ensure that the parameter θt is
set, the final convergence to a stable state is also critical.
3.3. Model Parameters and Standard Values. We modeled
the fixed-parameter setting.+e unit of time T represents the
working day. Considering the actual situation and the
convenience of calculation, we assumed that the average
working life of insured members was 32 years. +e average
annual working day was 250 days, and the T value was
32∗ 250 � 8000. Other parameters b, c, d, s, e0 are given in
the model. +e selection of each parameter value follows the
following constraints: the risk pool’s average survival time is
3–30 years, and the unit risk pool members are between and
15 and 150 [17].+e above restriction conditions are abstract
boundary conditions based on the actual situation and
historical data of mutual insurance. For parameter values
that were inconvenient to obtain or quantify, we considered
using heuristics to indirectly determine some parameter
values under the restriction of boundary conditions. We
ensured that it matched the actual situation to the greatest
extent and conducted numerical experiments on critical
parameters to avoid meaningless results.
Variable parameters(r, ρ, ϕ,ψ, μ) are distributed uni-
formly in value according to their respective attributes, and
the specific value ranges are listed in Table 2. +e parameter
combinations are 4∗ 6∗ 2∗ 2∗ 6 � 576 species. +e initial
trust r ∈ 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3{ } represents different initial trust
levels, which can be understood as the degree of familiarity
established based on social relationships. +e relationship
between trust and cooperation is not a simple linear rela-
tionship. +is can be understood as the probability of the
interaction between individuals using the same strategy.
After each iteration, we found a difference in the average
trust in the overall risk pool. +e average trust is
Rt � P(C|C) − P(C|D). In the context of mutual insurance,
it can also be understood as the degree of heterogeneity
among members. Simon explained r in detail from the
perspective of evolutionary biology [49].
+e occurrence intensity of interpool events ρ ∈ 0, 0.5,{
1, 1.5, 2, 3} represents the occurrence intensity of interpool
events from zero to strong. +e pool withdrawal intervention
parameterϕ ∈ 1, 1.5{ }, where ϕ � 1, means that the exit of the
risk pool depends only on the size of the risk pool and has
nothing to do with the other parameters of the risk pool. +is
can be interpreted as a completely market-oriented operation,
and the size of each capital pool determines its viability.
8 Complexity
For ϕ � 1.5, the operation performance of the risk pool
can be obtained through system regulation, and the oper-
ational status of each risk pool can be identified. +e exit
mechanism is beneficial for the group with more operators
and a positive elimination mechanism.
For ϕ< 1, a high moral risk is favorable to the risk pool;
that is, the risk pool achieves a strong survivability when a
high proportion of individuals adopt the betrayal strategy.
To maximize the use of computation, extreme cases of re-
verse elimination were not considered in this study.
+e pool splitting intervention coefficientψ ∈ 0, 1{ } at
time ψ � 0 indicates that there is no correlation splitting and
that all splits are assigned to members of both types in a
completely random manner. When ψ � 1, the cooperative
members and the betrayal members are separated, and new
risk pools are established. +e flow rate of pool members
μ ∈ 0, 0.0001, 0.00025, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.003{ }. If μ � 0.0001,
the probability of any member flowing out of the risk pool
was 0.0001. In a 50-member risk pool, this means that one
member of the risk pool flows out once every 200 working
days and flows in once with the same probability.
Despite restrictions on the model’s function and pa-
rameter selection, the optional range of each variable pa-
rameter value is still relatively extensive from amathematical
point of view. To test the influence of the details of pa-
rameters on the model verification result, we also conducted
a sensitivity analysis for the essential functions and pa-
rameters. +e results of the numerical experiment showed
that the operating results were quite robust within the model
and fixed-parameter configuration environment. +e cal-
culation results of the five critical variable parameter
combinations converged to a stable state.
4. Results and Discussion
+e results of the numerical calculation showed that the
introduction of measures such as splitting and bankruptcy at
the risk pool level contributed to the formation of an overall
risk pool competition mechanism. +is can significantly
improve organizational vitality in many aspects and is
consistent with common sense and the reality of the market
economy. +e calculation results of the parameter index
have the following aspects:
4.1. Pool-Level Events Can Significantly Promote the
Emergence of Overall Cooperation. We selected three data-
sets: the benchmark group data ρ � 0, r � 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3{ };
the r value in the two groups of control data remains un-
changed, ρ � 1, 3{ }. +e benchmark group data indicated
that all members were in a risk pool and there was no split
event. +e corresponding control group data indicated that,
after the risk pool members reached a certain size, a split
event occurred and the risk pool died during this period.+e
results showed that events at the risk pool level, such as spin-
offs, can significantly improve members’ comprehensive
cooperation. +e level of cooperation here refers to the
percentage of members who adopt cooperative (i.e., coop-
eration) strategies in the model to the total number of
members. A high level means that the higher the level of
cooperation in the overall risk pool, the lower is the moral
hazard of the overall risk pool.
As shown in Figure 5, even in the absence of trust (r � 0),
interpool events can significantly promote the overall level of
cooperation in the risk pool and effectively suppress the

Note: the numerical simulation can take a greater number of iterations. However, the number of iterations’ T value is high: the variable parameter
combination 4∗ 6∗ 2∗ 2∗ 6 � 576 cases. Hence, the overall amount of calculation will exponentially and significantly weaken the feasibility of the numerical
simulation and the calculation accuracy (under the premise of giving attention to two or more things). It can also include members’ entire careers and must
cover most of the small- and medium-sized enterprises’ lifecycle. T � 8000workday ≈ 30年. In each iteration, we focused on selecting five critical indicators
of the overall risk pool to store the number of iterations, the number of members who adopted the honest (cooperation) strategy, the number of members who
adopted the deceit (betrayal) strategy, the degree of trust among the members of the overall risk pool, and the number of risk pools —TCtDtRtNt. Total

moral hazard. When there is no interpool event, cooperation
will only occur when there is strong trust (r � 0.3). Con-
sistently, the early mutual insurance was established based
on strong relationships, such as kinship and geography. +e
early mutual insurance imposed restrictive regulations on
the upper limits of the risk pool. +e development of new
technologies such as blockchain and social networks has
only changed the way people communicate, speeding up the
frequency of social interactions and the iterative update
speed of events triggered by this development [50]. +ere-
fore, the rise of blockchain and social networks has not
substantially impacted the upper limit of the basic risk pool,
and organizational measures must be taken to ensure that
the overall risk pool’s moral hazard remains low .
Frequent interpool events may be detrimental to the
long-term development of the overall risk pool. Figure 6(c)
shows that when ρ� 3, the overall average pool capacity of
the risk pool is significantly lower than that of the com-
parison group. Figure 6(b) shows that excessive interpool
event intensity inhibits overall trust. Traditional organiza-
tional spin-offs, bankruptcies, and other events incur huge
costs. +e use of blockchain, digital currency, smart con-
tracts, and other technologies significantly reduce the cost of
organizational changes, efficiently facilitating the iterative
upgradation of the organizational structure. At the same
time, attention should also be paid to the frequent adverse
impact of organizational-level events on organizational trust
and scale expansion.
4.2. Regulation of Pool Events Can Improve Multiple Index
Values of the Overall Risk Pool. Deregulation of the pool
events means that the members of the two strategies are
randomly assigned to more than two new risk pools when
the pool splits. When bankruptcy occurs, the larger the scale,
the stronger is the survivability. Figures 6(a)–6(c) show no
regulation, while Figures 7(a)–7(c) show the regulation of
pool events. After the regulation, in terms of the level of
cooperation, except when there are no interpool events
(since the analysis background focused on whether the pool
events regulate under the premise that there are interpool
events, there is no interpool event ρ� 0 only as a benchmark
control). +e adoption of regulations can significantly im-
prove the convergence speed of cooperation level indicators.
After 2000 iterations, even under the basis of weak trust, the
overall risk pool cooperation level maintained a relatively
high equilibrium state.
After regulation, the overall trust level reached its peak
after 1500–2000 iterations; this was followed by a slow up
and down process and a subsequent convergence to a
higher-level range. +e overall trust level without regu-
lation is shown in Figure 6(b). In the interval [0.28, 0.32],
after regulation (Figure 7(b)), the trust level is in the in-
terval of [0.52, 0.60], which can increase the trust level by
approximately 0.3 units. In the context of mutual insur-
ance, pool trust can also be interpreted as the level of
homogeneity among members. +e higher the value, the
higher the insured members’ homogeneity and the more
consistent the members’ risk attributes. Correspondingly,
it is in the determination of premiums and risk man-
agement. +ere are more significant cost advantages in
other aspects.
+e regulation of pool events can also significantly in-
crease the overall risk pool’s average pool capacity, thereby
increasing its size. After regulation, the average number of
risk pool members increases from the [32, 43] interval in
Figure 6(c) to the [57, 60] interval in Figure 7(c). +e average
number of risk pool members increases by approximately 15.
4.3.  e Movement of Members among Risk Pools Is Not
Conducive to the Control of Moral Hazard. As shown in
Figures 8(a), 8(c), 8(e), and 8(g), when there is an interpool
event (ρ � 1), without regulation (ϕ � 1, ψ � 0) and the flow
rate μ � 0, various parameter combinations can promote
cooperative development. When the flow rate μ> 0, under
different initial trust levels, as the flow rate μ increases, there
will be a delay in the development of the overall cooperation
strategy. When the pool event is regulated (ϕ � 1.5, ψ � 1),
as shown in Figures 8(b), 8(d), 8(f), and 8(h), the influence of

10 Complexity
the flow rate on the overall cooperation level becomes more
complicated. +e prohibition of interpool flow is not critical
to the overall risk pool cooperation level. Even in the initial
situation of trustlessness (Figure 8(a)), a lower flow rate
(μ� 0.001) can also promote the overall cooperative be-
havior of the risk pool.
In the case of different initial trust values of r, the
primary trend is as follows: a lower turnover rate will
promote the formation of the overall risk pool cooperation
strategy; beyond a certain threshold, it will hinder the de-
velopment of cooperation. +e specific threshold is not easy
to quantify; even if a precise threshold is obtained, it cannot
ensure a strong operability for the analysis of the macro-
policy level. However, we can draw some basic laws of
macroevolution of the turnover rate and cooperation
strategy:
(i) +e turnover rate parameter μ harms the overall
cooperation development.
(ii) After regulating pool events, a low turnover rate can
conditionally promote the overall risk pool coop-
eration strategy.

(iii) +e higher the initial trust, the higher is the
threshold affecting the evolution of overall coop-
eration. In the initial stage of establishing the risk
pool, the tolerance of the membership flow was
relatively small. Conversely, in the middle and later
stages of risk pool development, membership flow
tolerance was relatively high after establishing
overall trust.
Let us perform a simple logical thought experiment.
Suppose there is no market elimination or member flow
regulation in the real market, a free-market competition
environment dominated by the capital scale. In such cases,
there will be a huge risk pool. +e mutual supervision
function decreases with an increase in the scale. +e free-
riding strategy will demonstrate short-term profits, driving
other honest members to change their original strategy. +e
free-riding strategy will invade a lot. If we allow it to develop
freely for a long time, there will be a tragedy of the commons,
which will eventually lead to the risk pool’s rapid demise.
It must be noted that the regulation referred to in this
study refers to the market elimination mechanism driven by
the level of cooperation and the pool splitting supervision
principle guided by homogeneous clustering. +e afore-
mentioned market mechanisms and supervision principles
can effectively control the moral hazard of the overall risk
pool. +is coincides with the transition from “too large to
fail” to “too centralized to fail” in various countries’ current
financial supervision. +e elimination mechanism domi-
nated by scale is one of the main factors that has helped the
market to evolve and achieve a high degree of monopoly and
engulf the people’s interests (that is, “too big to fail”). +e
simulation results also prove that the market elimination
mechanism can effectively control a moral hazard and ex-
pand the living space of small- and medium-sized insurance
organizations to improve market vitality. +is mechanism is
oriented by cooperation level and is integrated with the
supervision principle of pool splitting oriented by homo-
geneous clustering.
In terms of policy implementation, it is not feasible to
prohibit members completely from flowing between risk
pools, contrary to the organization and market principles of
autonomy, sharing, and competition. To offset the adverse
effects brought about by the free flow of members between
the risk pools, the precondition is to establish a complete
market competition elimination mechanism dominated by
cooperation efficiency. At the same time, cooperation with
the homogeneous clustering supervision measures of pool
splitting, such as establishing a membership review system
based on peer review before entering the pool, and ap-
propriate restrictions regarding the flow of members in the
early stage of the development of the risk pool will be lifted
after trust in the middle and later stages develops to a higher
level.
+e Dunbar number is widely accepted in academic
circles, andmany scholars have verified its validity for online
social network scenarios. +e results of this study sub-
stantiate and extend the work of Guidi et al. [20] andWebber

Note: initial distrust (r � 0), before and after regulation; the influence of member turnover rate μ on cooperation efficiency. Note: initial
weak trust (r � 0.15), before and after regulation; the influence of member turnover rate μ on cooperation efficiency. Note: initial standard
trust (r � 0.25), before and after regulation; the influence of member turnover rate μ on cooperation efficiency. Note: initial strong trust
(r � 0.30), before and after regulation; the influence of member turnover rate μ on cooperation efficiency. Note: the calculation results under
different parameter combinations showed that the turnover rate parameter μ had a negative effect on the overall development of
cooperation.

andmust increase their managementmeasures; however, the
authors do not propose specific management measures. In
line with this prior study, the present in-depth analysis of the
specific mutual insurance scenario advances several specific
governance measures, discussed in the following section.
5. Conclusions and Recommendations
+e application of digital technology improves organiza-
tions’ iterative update speed, but there is an upper limit on
the social capacity of the human brain. +is limitation re-
stricts the basic units of the various DAOs based on social
relations. After the social capacity exceeds the threshold
value, organizational measures such as splitting and strati-
ficationmust be taken to ensure that the number of members
of the basic organizational units is below the threshold value.
+is will be crucial to ensure the overall cooperation effi-
ciency of the organization and the effective exercise of
mutual supervision and management function of members.
It will also prevent market monopoly resulting from an
excessive concentration of power. +is conclusion is ap-
propriate for most distributed autonomous organizations.
In the context of mutual insurance applications, this
study draws the following conclusions:
(i) After the unit risk pool reaches the upper limit of the
number of members, organizational strategies, such
as splitting and stratification, can ensure the ex-
pansion of the overall risk pool and effectively
combat moral hazard.
(ii) Even in situations where trust is weak, pooling events
can lead to the emergence of overall cooperation.
(iii) If the intensity of the pool events is exceptionally
large, it will inhibit the cooperation of the entire risk
pool.
(iv) +e regulation of pool events can simultaneously
improve the cooperation level, overall trust, and
average pool capacity of the overall risk pool.
(v) +e interpool flow of members harms the con-
struction of the overall risk pool cooperation
strategy, but it is not a critical determinant.
(vi) At the same time, the market elimination mecha-
nism dominated by cooperation efficiency and split
supervision based on homogeneity clustering can
effectively fight against and control the moral
hazard, restrain the negative effect brought about by
member flow, expand the living space of small- and
medium-sized insurance organizations, restrain the
emergence of the large-scale monopoly risk pool,
and improve market vitality.
+ese findings have important implications for timely
government regulation of virtual organizations through
specific management measures and provide a theoretical
roadmap for the future development of the digital economy.
Based on the abovementioned conclusions, we put forward
the following specific recommendations from the perspective
of distributed autonomous organization governance:
(i) It is necessary to limit the number of risk pool
members. After exceeding the threshold, it is nec-
essary to implement management measures such as
a spin-off and establish market mechanisms such as
spin-offs and the elimination of the risk pool.
(ii) +e intensity of risk pool splitting, mergers, and
elimination should remain small enough to avoid
vicious competition.
(iii) It is necessary to establish a market elimination
mechanism with cooperation efficiency as the
leading factor and decentralized supervision based
on homogeneous clustering.
(iv) In the early stage of market development, it is
necessary to appropriately control the flow of
members among risk pools.
+is study is also subject to certain limitations. For
example, the model parameter setting was based on em-
pirical values that may therefore have influenced our model
estimates. +is limitation can be addressed by future studies.
Moreover, this study focused only on the mutual insurance
scenario and offered governance measures, which may not
apply to other autonomous organizations with special
functional requirements. Future research may also explore
the more universal governance of DAOs.
