ABSTRACT
In recent decades, the Smart City Industry has been actively de-
veloping around the world due to the economic benefits of the
globalization of product design and development. Information ex-
change is an important characteristic of the global activities of the
Smart City Industry. The Internet of Things (IoT) enhances infor-
mation sharing for the Smart City manufacturing industry. Despite
this success, the adoption of IoT applications to automate business
processes faces many challenges due to security concerns. IoT tech-
nology helps collect real-time information about the Smart City
Industry using tags and radio frequency identification (RFID) sen-
sors. Blockchain technology with IoT can enable broader categories
of business applications to improve integration and improve the ef-
ficiency of business transactions. This article provides an overview
of blockchain integration with IoT technology, highlighting the
advantages and disadvantages of integration. This article provides
a classification of security threat models that are taken into account
by blockchain protocols in IoT networks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchain technology is a distributed network for orchestrating
transactions, value, and assets between peers without intermedi-
aries’ assistance. Blockchain technology helps record transactions
or any digital interaction designed to be secure, transparent, highly
resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. These characteristics
provide impetus to blockchain-based IoT architecture for secure
data processing in a distributed environment. In order words, IoT-
based information systems to improve their IoT networked infras-
tructure to blockchain complimented technology. It is a distributed
ledger managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to provide intern-
ode communication and verify new blocks. A convergence of IoT
and blockchain technologies can lead to a verifiable, secure, and
robust mechanism of storing andmanaging data processed by smart
connected devices. This network of connected devices will interact
with their environment and make decisions without any human
intervention. However, integrating blockchain technology in IoT-
based information systems will enhance the security, data privacy,
and reliability of IoT devices, it creates a new set of challenges.
This article presents how smart city businesses can leverage IoT
applications in combination with blockchain technology to stream-
line their supply chains business information. When combined,
these enabling technologies will help global textile and clothing
companies to overcome difficulties related to data collection d in-
tegrity, address security challenges, and reduce information asym-
metry. This article will demonstrate areas of disadvantages towards
safety and privacy in blockchain technology.
2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Blockchain technology won many individuals’ and corporations’ in-
terest due to its technological capabilities and scalability for various
use cases. This led to the disruption of traditional internet/intranet
business models alongside services such as conducting business
transactions and managing information ineffective and secure ways.
These use cases clearly communicate a message for systems and ex-
perience designers to get equipped with relevant skills and to keep
polishing them as the technology grows. Following the evolution of
this rapid introduction, blockchain technology nowadays consists
of three types: the ‘public,’ ‘private,’ and ‘federated / consorted.’ In
a nutshell, these blockchains share similar functionalities. In terms
of differences, they rely on the use cases, permission levels, and
privacy. Within the business context, the blockchain brings several
advantages: time-saving over work processes, minimizing costs,

risk reduction, and an increase in trust. By learning these values
and benefits, web designers will have the ability to foresee how this
technology can reshape our clients’ businesses, notwithstanding
the knowledge and confidence we need to guide and proposing
the right solutions fitting their needs. However, for that to happen,
the business must have a network of some kind to ensure a solid
foundation of a good blockchain use case. It is often said that ‘with
great power comes great responsibility.’ This statement is heavily
applicable when it comes to this technology. The blockchain re-
stores control and ownership of information to its rightful owner,
thus eliminating central authorities and third parties’ dependencies.
3 INTERNET OF THINGS AND ITS
APPLICATIONS IN SMART CITY INDUSTRY
IoT technology has used in smart cityl industries for different busi-
ness process automation purpose. This area of computing has re-
cently focused on enterprise automation, and there is a handful of
evidence of the successful use of this technology in supply chain
operations. IoT based information system aims to improve organ-
isational communication and collaboration activities. In recent
decades, World Wide Web technologies are getting prominence
for business use, and the numbers of Internet-based IoT services are
increasing rapidly for supply chain communities. The main form of
communication is human-to-human. IoT attempts to not only have
humans communicating through the Internet but also have objects
or devices. These things are to exchange information by themselves
over the Internet, and new forms of Internet communication would
form human-to-things and things-to-things [4].
The IoT technology characterised by three types of visions:
1. Things Oriented Vision: This vision supported by the fact that
this technology can track anything using sensors. The advancement
and convergence of microelectronic systems technology, wireless
communications and digital electronics have resulted in the devel-
opment of miniature devices having the ability to sense, compute
and communicate wirelessly in an effective way. The basic phi-
losophy is uniquely identifying an object using specifications of
Electronic Product Code (EPC) [4]. It is worth considering that
the future of ‘Things Oriented Vision’ will depend upon sensor
technology evolution for accurate sensing (without any error) and
its capabilities to fulfil the "thing" oriented other issues.
2. Internet Oriented Vision: This vision realises upon the need
to make smart objects which are connected.
3. Semantic Oriented Vision: This vision is power because the
number of sensors used in the smart city industry is vast. The data
that these IoT infrastructures collect is massive. Thus, the industry
needs to process this data in a meaningful way to form value-added
services using semantic technologies (e.g., ontology, knowledge-
based reasoning), efficient, secure, scalable, and market-oriented
computing.
In this way, the IoT application builds on three pillars, related to
the ability of smart objects to (i) be identifiable (anything identifies
itself), (ii) to communicate (anything communicates), and (iii) to
interact (anything interacts) – either among themselves, building
networks of interconnected objects, or with end-users or other
entities in the network [4]. Cloud computing and fog computing
provide computing resources and scalability to connect, store and
analyse IoT data (often labelled as big data).
4 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN SMART
CITY BUSINESS
Since the innovation of Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency, blockchain
technology has positioned itself as the focal point of interest among
a diverse range of researchers and practitioners. Blockchain is a
decentralised ledger that stores all transactions that have made
on top of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network in a secure, verifiable, and
transparent way. The significant advantage of blockchain over the
existing technologies is that it enables the two parties to make trans-
actions over the Internet securely without any intermediary party’s
interference. The omission of the intermediate party can reduce
the processing cost while improving the security and efficiency
of transactions. Due to the benefits that blockchain can bring in
information processing, this technology expands its applicability
to new territories such as supply chain management and logistics
management. Today, blockchain also stands as a gatekeeper in the
emerging "trust economy", in which the global smart city businesses
supply chain operates to serve its suppliers and customers. The effi-
ciency of a global smart city buisnesses supply chain relies on trust
between the different stakeholders. The integration of blockchain
and IoT technologies can increase the traceability and reliability of
information and the business network. The IoT technology should
integrate with enterprise resource planning (ERP) and point of sales
(POS) systems of smart city business to share and monitor real-time
information at each stage. Blockchain technology offers a mech-
anism to record transactions or any digital interaction designed
to secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and
efficient. In other words, blockchain technology has introduced
an effective solution to IoT based information systems security. A
blockchain enhances IoT devices to send inclusion data in a shared
transaction repository with the tamper-resistant record. It improves
business partners to access and supply IoT data without central
control and management, which creates a digital fusion.
In a blockchain-based infrastructure, every node of the chain
maintains a local copy of transaction information. The copy is iden-
tical to the original copy and updated in the global information
sheet as it distributed within the database with well-built constancy
support. Once data entered within the blockchain ledger in this
database, no one can change this data in the future. However, this
mechanism is known as tamperproof, a systematic effort required
for building a reliable blockchain-based information infrastructure.
The main features of these systematic efforts are as follows: (i)
Blockchain Protocols for Commitment: The protocol of commitment
makes sure that valid transaction from smart city industry business
processes are committed and stored in the blockchain information
storage with appropriate validation mechanism and within a stipu-
lated time; (ii) Consensus: Consensus consists of two things: First,
it permits blockchain to be updated while making sure that every
block in the network is valid as well as keeping participants incen-
tivised and second, it safeguards any single entity from controlling
or crashing the whole blockchain system. The consensus aims to
create a distributed network without central authorities with par-
ticipants who do not necessarily need to trust each other [3]. The
The Impact of Blockchain Technology on the Smart City Industry DEFIN-2021, March 18, 19, 2021, St.Petersburg, Russian Federation
consensus is an essential part of blockchain technology. Each node
runs a programmed mechanism called a consensus. The consensus
is how nodes agree on how to update the blockchain because of a
set of transactions. Achieving consensus ensures that most network
nodes have validated the same set of transactions; (iii) Security:
Safety is an essential aspect of the blockchain-based transaction
processes. All the data within the blockchain ecosystem needs to be
secured and tamperproof. Ensures that there are no malicious nodes
within the blockchain-based enterprise ecosystem. (iv) Privacy and
Authenticity: Privacy in blockchain enables the client/user to per-
form transactions without leaking its identification information in
the network; and (v) Smart Contracts.
5 BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS FOR THE
IOT
5.1 Applications in Supply Chain
Academics and practitioners identified industrial business pro-
cesses, mainly supply chain and logistics management, essential
for deploying IoT based information system applications. IoT-based
industrial information systems can enhance enterprise competi-
tiveness through more effective tracking of raw materials’ flow,
leading to improved business processes’ effectiveness and efficien-
cies. In the context of globalised business practice, with multi-
ple collaborating-partners based supply chains, IoT-based appli-
cations enhance the sharing of more accurate and timely infor-
mation relevant to production, quality control, distribution, and
logistics. However, researchers expressed their concern regarding
standalone IoT-based applications and global supply chain man-
agement. The main concerns raised on the issues of standalone
IoT systems security and privacy. The research community has
proposed different hybrid information system architectures (e.g.,
IoT with blockchain, cloud based IoT and blockchain technology). A
blockchain enhances IoT-based applications tamper-resistant char-
acteristics. In recent years, different blockchain-based information
management systems have reported by researchers. For example,
IBM has developed a new blockchain-based service designed to
track high-value items through complex supply chains in a secure
cloud-based application system. In recent decades, due to globalisa-
tion, manufacturing supply chain networks are going through an
evolutionary change through their business practices’ continued
digitisation. These global manufacturing chains evolve into value-
creating networks where the value chain becomes an essential
competitive advantage source. Simultaneously, developments are
in progress to integrate blockchain technology with other technolo-
gies solutions (e.g., IoT-based applications, cloud-based solutions,
and fog computing-based automation): modern manufacturing sup-
ply chains and holistic collaboration mechanisms value-enhancing
applications for the global business.
5.2 Applications on the Internet of Things
Devices Management
In IoT, devices management relates to security solutions for the
physical devices, embedded software, and residing data on the de-
vices. Internet of Things (IoT) comprises of "Things" (or IoT devices)
that have remote sensing and data collecting capabalities and can
exchange data with other connected devices and applications (di-
rectly or indirectly). IoT devices can collect data and process the
data either locally or send them to centralised servers or cloud-
based application back-ends for processing. A recent on-demand
model of manufacturing that is leveraging IoT technologies is called
Cloud-Based Manufacturing (CBM). It enables ubiquitous, conve-
nient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
manufacturing business processes information collection and use
it service provision.
5.3 Applications on the Internet of Things
Access Management
Access control is a mechanism in computer security that regu-
lates access to information system. The access control systems face
many problems, such as third-party, inefficiency, and lack of privacy.
These problems can be address by blockchain, the technology that
received significant attention in recent years, and much potential.
As there is a third party with access to the data, the risk of privacy
leakage exists. Also, a major party is in charge to control the access,
so the risk of a single point of failure also exists. This study presents
an access control mechanism with a temporal dimension to solve
these problems and adapts a blockchain-based solution for verifying
access permissions. The attribute-based Encryption method also
has some problems, such as privacy leakage from the private key
generator (PKG) and a single point of failure as mentioned before.
Wang and colleagues introduce a framework for data sharing and ac-
cess control to address this problem by implementing decentralised
storage. Blockchain can be classified either as private (permission)
or public (permissionless). Both classes are decentralising and pro-
vide a certain level of immunity against faulty or malicious users
for blockchain technology [2]. The significant differences between
private and public blockchains lie in the consensus protocol’s exe-
cution, the ledger’s maintenance, and the authorisation mechanism
to join the distributed network. Recently, there has been a tremen-
dous investment from the industries and significant interest from
academia to solve significant research challenges in blockchain
technologies. For example, consensus protocols are the primary
building blocks of blockchain-based technologies. Therefore, the
threats targeting the consensus protocols become a significant re-
search issue in the blockchain.
6 CONCLUSION
Today’s smart city industry supply chain face significant volatility,
uncertainty and complexity imposed by a dynamic business envi-
ronment. Changes in customer buying pattern – the demand for
a lower price, higher service levels, mobile commerce and so on –
necessitate customer intelligence and varying fulfilment models.
These have introduced significant stress on smart city industry
supply chain networks, compelling clothing businesses to revisit
their supply chain design strategies. It includes the deployment of
appropriate information systems that enhance supply chain execu-
tion. In such scenarios, enterprise information systems architecture
plays a significant role.
This article explains and summarises some of the main issues
of the smart city industry supply chain management system. IoT
is a smart worldwide network of interconnected objects, which
DEFIN-2021, March 18, 19, 2021, St.Petersburg, Russian Federation Vardan Mkrttchian et al.
through unique address schemes can cooperate with each other
and interact with their neighbours to reach common goals. The
data obtained from the IoT applications along smart city industry
business processes can make operational decision-making much
more comfortable. However, standalone IoT application systems
face security and privacy-related problems. With the rapid growth
in the number of connected IoT devices, many obstacles arise that
may slow down the IoT’s adoption across different smart city busi-
ness processes automation. Firstly, the market for IoT devices and
platforms is fragmented, with many standards and many vendors.
Secondly, interoperability concerns, as the solution implemented
often tends to create new data silos. IoT device data often stored
in the cloud securely, but they are not protected against compro-
mised integrity devices or tampering at the source. In contrast, the
blockchain is an evolving technology that can help with IoT systems
resiliency [3]. The blockchain provides trust between IoT devices
and reducing the risk of tampering with cryptographic techniques.
Security and business organisational issues tend to enhance the
need to build an smart city buisnesses manufacturing supply chain
management system leveraging blockchain ledger technology. Re-
gardless of the particularities of the specific textile manufacturing
supply chain-related application, blockchain can offer a wide range
of advantages. By registering and documenting a product’s (e.g., cot-
ton, fibre, textile cloths) lifecycle across the manufacturing supply
chain nodes increases the transparency and the trust of the partici-
pating business partners. Finally, the article tries to emphasise the
security and privacy-related issues of blockchain-based technology
deployment. The article concludes by presenting five different types
of threat models, namely - identity-based attacks, manipulation-
based attacks, cryptanalytic attacks, reputation-based attacks, and
service-based attacks in the context of blockchain technology. The
idea of a permissioned blockchain presents many hopeful solutions
to the development and integration of smart smart city businesses
supply chain operations. In practice, however, many more efforts
need to be conducted to secure permissioned blockchains before re-
alistic implementation. In the future, the current research moves on
to a more in-depth approach to permissioned blockchain security,
whether an analytical or experimental analysis. The membership
service provider (MSP) needs to be analysed comparatively, and rig-
orous proofs need to be built to quantify the threats that accompany
permissioned blockchain numerically. Further work is encouraged
in a comparative analysis of key management systems to find the
best fit system for permissioned blockchain. On 25 May 2018, the
GDPR became enforceable in the European Union (EU) region. This
has a paradoxical effect on blockchain data in general and should
be strongly considered when implementing any blockchain identity
solution within the EU region. In this way, enforcing data privacy
and protecting user data is no longer optional in Europe. However,
it should be noted that the text of the GDPR documentation is void
of both technical and non-technical implementation details neces-
sary to achieve GDPR compliance [1]. This constitutes a significant
research gap that this research aims to fill in the future.
