Abstract—The study of blockchain (BC) technologies has been
applied to a wide breadth of research fields in recent years,
chasing the realization of its full potential. Among them, video
games have become a very eager adopter of blockchain in many
of its different facets: cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens
(NFTs), and smart contracts. This paper presents the results
of a scoping review in order to answer the research question
”What is the current state of academic research in blockchain
applied to video games?”. After a thorough search in a diverse
set of scientific databases, a total of 39 fitting publications were
methodically retrieved, studied and categorized. The results draw
a clearer picture of the current state-of-the art, as well as the
identification of relevant trends and opportunities in this topic.
Keywords—video games, blockchain, study, review, NFT, smart
contracts, cryptocurrency
I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid growth in popularity of blockchain technologies
in recent years has spurred the interest in academic research.
Indeed, the study of the application of blockchain technology
has pushed through its initial inception as a means to an elec-
tronic cash system and set new trends and research challenges
[1]. Among the industries with an eager interest in researching
the application of blockchain technologies, video games have
become a very strong proponent.
It is necessary to advance until 2017 to find video games
that, albeit still niche in the broad gaming landscape, have
sparked the interest of the industry at large, with its use of
NFTs and smart contracts as the means to manage virtual
items. However, it is only by the start of 2022 that big
mainstream companies, such as UbiSoft or Square Enix, have
started declaring their intentions to use blockchain in their
products. However, the fact that the main push comes from the
industry does not mean that there is no research work in the
academic community. As the topics of blockchain and gaming
become more and more entangled, it becomes necessary to
provide the big picture of this research and detect which are
the current trends and opportunities.
This paper presents a scoping review [2] on the current state
of academic research in blockchain technologies in the context
of video games. Even though a thorough survey exists on video
games that are based on blockchain [3], in the short time span
since its publication, many new relevant actors have entered
the field. But most importantly, up to our knowledge, there are
no studies focused on analyzing the scientific literature (i.e.
academic peer-reviewed papers). A scoping review approach
has been chosen since it is commonly used to examine the
extent, and nature of the research activity in a topic area, in
order to assess the potential and cost of undertaking a full
systematic review at a later time.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II the method-
ology for the study is presented, including search strategy,
result eligibility criteria and the paper screening and data
extraction process. Section III shows the results, providing
references to all the publications included in the study and
their categorization according to several properties. Detected
key messages, trends and research opportunities are discussed
in Section IV, providing insights on what is the state of current
research in blockchain technologies in the contest of video
games and which are the open challenges or opportunities for
those who want to further study this topic. Finally, Section
V concludes this paper, summarizing its main findings and
suggesting future work.
II. METHODOLOGY
The review process was composed of four stages: 1) search
and compilation of publications through scientific databases,
2) a first screening to filter results that actually aligned with
the topic at hand, as well as possible duplicated results, 3) a
review of the remaining results, reading the full text of the
papers, and 4) categorization and synthesis of the content.
A. Search Strategy
The search strategy relied on the topic keywords ”video
games” AND (”blockchain” OR ”nft” OR ”smart contract”).
Variations of these terms were also used, taking into account
singular/plural and the possible use or not of blank spaces
between some words (e.g. ”video games”). A diverse spec-
trum of scientific databases was chosen in order to achieve
a broad search coverage, mainly Web of Science, Scopus,
ScienceDirect, ProQuest, IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digi-
tal Library. These searches were further complemented with

Google Scholar. However, given the vast range of results using
this search engine, the analysis was limited to the few first
pages, once it was easily detected that results quickly diverged
from the topic at hand. All searches were performed during
December 2021.
B. Selection of studies and eligibility criteria
The initial study population was the combined list of
publications extracted from all the search processes, regardless
of field of knowledge, after eliminating repetitions. Each
result was categorized and summarized independently by
two researchers who consolidated their findings, one with a
background specialized in blockchain and another in video
games, but both with a basic understanding of each other’s
fields.
In a first iteration, papers were assessed only by title,
abstract and keywords. In a second iteration, the full paper
content was read and analyzed. During each iteration, a more
thorough selection process was performed, only considering
eligible to this study papers a) where the topic was strictly the
interaction of blockchain technologies in video games, and b)
that were the result of a proper peer-review process (i.e. not
editorials, columns, or self-published books).
It must be noted that, as will be shown in Section III,
we deviated from the defined protocol and made some minor
exceptions for criterion b). This was the case of a book chapter
and two M.Sc. Thesis with a clear research focus and a well-
defined methodology, that were considered worth including
nevertheless, just for the sake of the completeness of the study.
C. Paper Screening and data extraction
In order to homogenize the categorization and summariza-
tion process among the reviewers, a data extraction form was
created, which included a set of open and closed questions.
On one hand, the open questions allowed reviewers to
identify the stated goals (i.e. research questions) of the pub-
lications, their most significant contributions, what kind of
experiments or analytical data (if any) it included, and a short
list of other interesting topics discussed.
On the other hand, closed questions delimited very specific
characteristics, such as what kind of games were mentioned,
type of blockchain and the focus within the blockchain
ecosystem (e.g. currency, NFT, smart contracts), and whether
the paper focused on technological or social aspects. The
closed questions also included the compilation of standard
bibliographical data, such as year of publication, country
of origin of the corresponding author, type of publication,
publisher, list of keywords, and number of cites.
III. RESULTS
After the iterative selection process, 39 publications were
considered eligible for this review. A summary of all the
extracted data is shown in Table I, ordered by paper relevance
using the descending number of cites. For each paper, the table
summarizes it main properties.
Regarding the type of study, we have classified the papers
in four different categories: analytical, experimental, technical
proposal, or descriptive. We have considered as analytical the
papers where the authors gather data from an existing system
(e.g. transactions from the game CryptoKitties recorded in
the Ethereum blockchain), analyze them, and extract some
conclusions. On the other hand, we have considered as ex-
perimental the papers where the authors have designed an
experiment, implemented a proof-of-concept or interacted in
some way with the studied system to get some results and
withdraw conclusions. We have classified papers as technical
proposals when the goal of the paper is to present a new
development. Finally, we have classified as descriptive all
the papers that just provide a description of one or several
systems, without interacting or extracting data from them to
withdraw new conclusions. Figure 1, shows the total amount
of papers published per year and their distribution considering
this classification.
Fig. 1. Types of paper per year.
Fig. 2. Focus of the papers per year.
Also, we have classified the papers according to the main
blockchain technology used or analyzed in each case. In most
of the cases, the papers study an application or a game imple-
mented on a single blockchain (generally Ethereum), although
other blockchains may be mentioned in the paper. In certain
cases, the authors study several applications from various
blockchain systems. In other cases, the authors study some
applications built on top of a blockchain, without specifying
the underlying one.

Table I and Figure 2 also show the focus of the paper. Here,
each paper was tagged with a key concept from the blockchain
context, if the concept has a relevant part in the content of
the paper. The tags that we considered are: cryptocurrencies
(CrCurr), smart contracts (SC), non-fungible tokens (NFT),
and “blockchain in general” (BC) for those papers not focused
enough in any of the previous topics (e.g. papers analyzing
several aspects of a game, papers showing the development of
a proof-of-concept application, etc.).
IV. DISCUSSION
Once a general overview of the current academic research
has been presented, this section discusses in more detail the
most recurrent and evident topics detected upon the assessment
of all the works included in the study. The main goal is to
answer the research question ”What is the current state of
academic research in blockchain applied to video games?”,
thus providing the ability to detect research gaps and oppor-
tunities that can be used to further progress this field of study.
Discussing the potential of cryptogames
Since the corpus of review encompassed all areas of knowl-
edge where the words blockchain and video games were
related, the results are very heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a
very important part of the current research on video games
and blockchain is dedicated to dissertations or studies on
exploring its potential, seeking to suggest how to extend the
functionalities of the blockchain in this context. They tend to
provide a general idea about how it works, but without going
into the technical details. The most usual topics are social or
legal issues, such as in [4], [8], [21], [40], for instance. These
works are evenly distributed between the years 2019-2021,
discussing the potential of new trends related to blockchain,
as they appear. Whereas the older publications tend to discuss
the potential of blockchain in general, the most recent ones
from 2021 tend to focus on NFTs, a hot topic in the video
game industry at the time of this writing [36], [40]. Generally
speaking, this kind of papers provide a very good entry point
to researchers who want to get an overview, and are a part
of the literature open to new contributions, as new subtopics
become popular.
Expanding the technology
Another very important part of the literature, just above an
even split with the previously mentioned dissertation works,
is the one related to purely technological proposals. In this
case, most papers are from 2020 and the general preferred
topics in general are interoperability, some relevant examples
are [6], [9], [27], or presenting fully fledged blockchain based
games, such as in [14], [23]. Again, a raise in the relevance
of papers related to NFTs and virtual item trading is detected
in the latest publications [34], [35].
Maybe the most surprising result from the study of more
technological-oriented works is the lack of experimental data.
Only a minority of the works included in this study, such
as [24], [28], [31], proposes an experiment or provides any
kind of analytical data supporting its effectiveness or adequacy
(such as Response Time, Throughput or gas cost). Neverthe-
less, some of them, more oriented to protocol security, provide
formalization [13], [39]. In fact, several works do not go
beyond the proof-of-concept stage or a very simple sketch of
the architectural design, just 2-3 pages long, such as [9], [34],
[41], for instance. Therefore, this is an obvious gap that authors
of future technological proposals should take into account.
Observing the technology
Speaking of works that put an emphasis in empirical data,
the ones that exist are mostly related to the analysis of existing
platforms, assessing player behavior or transaction traffic, such
as in [7], [10], [30], [33]. However, some papers that want to
study very specific aspects of blockchain, such as security or
transaction delay of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT),
create their own prototypes or emulation layer, instead of using
existing platforms, to perform experiments [17], [26]. In that
regard, from the results, it looks like there is a wide field of
potential research opportunities in the studying the behavior
of existing games, both from a technological or sociological
standpoint, and especially given what will be immediately
commented in the following subsection.
Moving beyond CryptoKitties
Among all games mentioned or studied in the literature,
with no doubt CryptoKitties has the most relevance, appearing
in 27 out of 39 works. In most of the cases, this game is
mentioned in passing, as the main example of the application
of blockchain in video games. But some works are devoted
to discussing its aspects in much more detail. On one hand,
several papers present such details as a proof on how to
introduce blockchain technologies in the game industry, and
its implications [4], [11], [16], [18], [22], [37]. On the other
hand, a few works focus on studying how it works, or its user
behavior [10], [19].
This trend is especially interesting since, actually, Cryt-
poKitties has been in obvious decline for some time. In January
2022, it ended in the 193rd position of most popular crypto
games1, and its number of users was very low, moving between
a range of 43 and at 97. However, it is still being included in
works that are very recent, related to the time of writing of this
review. In contrast, the most popular games during this period
are seldom mentioned in the literature, even in the most recent
papers. Among the top five games mentioned in the literature,
only Gods Unchained is in the top 25 (in the 24th position,
to be specific). From the top ten, only Axie Infinity, a game
released in 2018 and boasting among 47k and 56k players
in the same time period, is only briefly mentioned in three
papers, from 2019 and 2021. Even the most cited paper in
this study, a very thorough survey from 2019 [3], is mostly
outdated in that regard. This trend shows how fast the field of
cryptogames is moving, while presenting a clear research gap
in studying the heirs of CryptoKitties.

V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a clear overview of the current aca-
demic research and interests in the topic of how blockchain
technologies can be applied to the field of video games.
A trend starting from 2018 and, albeit still niche in the
general field of blockchain research, it is slowly gaining
momentum, especially in the industry. Using a scoping review
methodology, the most relevant topics and opportunities for
research were identified. From the study results, and beyond
the topics enumerated in the discussion, it is also possible
to conclude which are some of the upcoming challenges that
scientific research could try to provide an answer to, given its
recurrence in some parts of the literature.
On one hand, an obvious one would be interoperability.
Blockchain, and especially NFTs, are touted in the context of
video games as a method of decentralization where the user is
the real owner of virtual assets, out of the company’s control.
However, this is made irrelevant if the use of in-game assets
is still limited to a single game, allowing companies to act as
gatekeepers of the content. This is an interesting challenge that
has no easy solution at this moment. On the other hand, further
research on Smart Contracts as a means to fairness could
become very useful, especially in games where randomness
plays a big role (as the saying goes, ”Code is law”). However,
understanding the code gives you an edge, and thus game
creators always have the upper hand. Is it possible to balance
healthy gameplay and fairness, from a technical standpoint?
A different matter is whether game companies would want to
give up their house edge, of course, regardless of their talk.
Nevertheless, apart from these complicated challenges, the
field of video games and blockchain is a very young discipline,
full of potential, that can provide a wide breadth of oppor-

tunities in what has turned out to be a very heterogeneous
research field, not purely tied to technological proposals.
Once a preliminary scoping review has been finished and the
potential of the topic has been assessed, further work would
be to undertake a full systematic review at a later time.
