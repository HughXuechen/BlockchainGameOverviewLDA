Abstract: Blockchain technology allows fresh agricultural enterprises to share records stored on the
chain, and the technology can benefit information management systems, such as decentralization and
transparency. This study uses game theory to examine a blockchain introduction strategy for fresh
agricultural enterprises in a competitive environment, considering consumer traceability preferences.
We establish a pricing decision model in traditional and blockchain traceability modes and identify
optimal solutions. Additionally, we analyze the impact of the blockchain introduction strategy,
consumer preferences, and blockchain influence factor on optimal pricing decisions. The results
indicate that the introduction of blockchain could improve the profits of enterprises under certain
conditions. Moreover, consumer traceability preferences and the blockchain influence factor could
significantly affect the blockchain introduction strategy. We also discover that when the blockchain
influence factor meets a certain range, introducing blockchain technique in the traceability system
could shift demand from traditional enterprises to blockchain enterprises. The total market demand
for blockchain enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode will increase, whereas that of tradi-
tional enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode will decrease. Both consumer traceability
preferences and the blockchain influence factor could significantly affect optimal pricing. Finally,
some management suggestions are provided for the traceability of fresh agricultural enterprises
based on the research conclusions.

1. Introduction
Fresh agricultural product traceability has always been a major concern for consumers.
As consumers pay more attention to their health, they have higher requirements regarding
the sensory quality of the products, such as taste, texture, color, and shape, and the internal
quality and hygienic quality, such as ingredients, nutrients, harmful substances, pesti-
cide residue, and mildew [1,2]. Based on experimental research, Dickinson and Bailey [3]
showed that consumers are willing to pay more for the traceability and transparency of
meat products. Recently, electronic trade among the supply chain members of agricultural
products has become popular, which makes it more difficult to authenticate and track
information in their production, processing, and distribution processes [4]. Dalian sea cu-
cumber, Yangcheng Lake crab, Wuchang rice, and other branded agricultural products have
been subject to information fraud incidents. Additionally, it is difficult for the consumer
to trace accurate information about agricultural products. Food traceability is related to
the behavior of all members in a supply chain, and information fraud committed by any
member may reduce the authenticity and effectiveness of traceability.

In 1993, the Escherichia coli scare was the largest food crisis in the United States [5]. In
2011, bean sprouts contaminated with Escherichia coli caused many people to be infected in
Germany [6]. From 2016 to 2019, many consumers complained on the Pinduoduo website
because of rotting fruit. Some famous brands of agricultural products, such as Wuchang
rice, Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, Gannan navel oranges, West Lake Longjing tea, and Aksu
apples, are often counterfeited [7]. Governments and enterprises have attempted to use
various information technologies to solve the problems related to information opacity and
authenticity in the agricultural product supply chain. For example, the European Union
uses the RSS (Reduced Space Symbology) barcode system and the EAN/UCC (European
Article Number/Uniform Code Council) identification system to track the quality of beef,
vegetables, and other products. Some companies use the tracking system of the Internet
of Things (IoT) to track the quality of products [8]. Other enterprises use the NetMES
system based on a cloud platform to address information asymmetry in the supply chain.
However, the above initiatives have failed because the traditional traceability systems are
usually based on centralized information management systems, and information can be
easily tampered with and forged [9,10]. As a result, the traditional traceability systems
significantly damage consumers’ trust in product authenticity. It is challenging to trace
food effectively and ensure the authenticity of product traceability chain information.
Blockchain technology is feasible and has certain advantages in ensuring the trace-
ability and authenticity of the food supply chain [11]. The traceability system based on
blockchain technology is a decentralized database system with distinguishing features,
such as credibility, security, and immutability [12]. In recent years, some fresh agricul-
tural enterprises have joined the TAC platform (a traceability cloud platform based on
blockchain technology) to trace agricultural products. Consumers can seek information
on this platform concerning aspects such as the production date, batch, producer, and
ingredients list. For example, Cainiao and Tmall Global enabled blockchain technology
to trace the origin of cross-border imports in February 2018. By the end of 2019, more
than 800 cooperative brands and more than 70,000 products joined JD Zhizhen Chain’s
anti-counterfeiting and traceability platform. According to “the report of Blockchain Trace-
ability Service Innovation and Application in 2020,” jointly released by Ceibs Supply Chain
and Service Innovation Center and JD Digits, after brand owners adopted the blockchain
anti-counterfeiting traceability service, the sales of nutritional health products and the visits
of nutritional health products increased by 30%, while their repurchase rate increased by
44.8% and return rate decreased by 4.5%.
The traceability of fresh agricultural products is different from that of industrial
products. Fresh agricultural products are perishable, and their shelf-life is considerably
shorter. The value of fresh agricultural products rapidly drops to zero once the shelf-life is
exceeded. It is impossible to resell these products once they have been returned. Therefore,
the return loss may affect the decision of the supply chain members of fresh agricultural
products. Simultaneously, the development cost of a blockchain project is hundreds of
thousands up to millions, and this cost will fluctuate with the development difficulty. It
is usually a huge expense for a business. The storage cost of wholly traceable data is
another significant expense. Storing traceability data directly on the chain and backing
up the stored data at all nodes will require a large amount of memory capacity and will
increase the maintenance costs of a traceability system. The storage cost of a traceability
database based on the blockchain technique is thousands of times higher than that of a
traditional traceability database based on a distributed system or cloud storage technique.
According to rough estimates, 1 KB of Ethereum storage costs about USD 1.58 [13]. In
addition, the blockchain traceability system of the fresh products supply chain requires
all nodes on the blockchain to be backed up and store data. This makes it easy to cause
repetitive storage and increase memory consumption, thus increasing the maintenance
cost of the traceability system. The costs related to blockchain are a colossal expense
for enterprises. Additionally, Liu et al. [14] showed that consumers are more willing to
pay for fresh agricultural products. The huge initial development and operating costs
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 3 of 18
greatly reduce the willingness of companies in the food supply chain to adopt blockchain
technology [15]. In reality, not all enterprises adopt blockchain technology; for example,
Dalian sea cucumber brands such as Fortune Island and Sha Tuozi Island adopt blockchain
traceability of sea cucumber products in various links, including breeding, seedling rearing,
culture, and processing. Sea Star Island, Ocean Island, and other enterprises adopt the
traditional traceability system to trace the origin of sea cucumber products.
In this study, we build a game model to investigate enterprise practice and the under-
explored role played by blockchain in the traceability of fresh agricultural enterprises in
competitive circumstances. We attempt to theoretically address the following research
questions:
(1) In a competitive context, should fresh agricultural enterprises introduce blockchain
technology?
(2) How does the blockchain influence factor affect the optimal pricing and profits of
fresh agricultural enterprises?
(3) How would the traceability preferences of consumers affect the optimal pricing and
profits of fresh agricultural enterprises?
Inspired by the observed management practice of the fresh agricultural product supply
chain, this study first analyzed the optimal pricing and profits of enterprises of fresh agri-
cultural products under a scenario where two enterprises adopt a traditional traceability
mode considering consumers’ traceability preferences in a competitive environment. Fur-
thermore, we investigated the optimal pricing strategy and profits under a scenario where
one enterprise adopts a blockchain traceability mode, and the other adopts a traditional
traceability mode. We identify the condition of introducing blockchain traceability for the
enterprise in a competitive environment and how blockchain influence factor and con-
sumers’ traceability preferences affect the optimal pricing of fresh agricultural enterprises.
Unlike previous research, our study is theoretical. It explores the introduction strategy
of blockchain technology to the traceability system of the agricultural product supply
chain in two competitive enterprises. We examine the optimal pricing and profits of fresh
agricultural enterprises under the traditional traceability mode and blockchain traceability
mode with game theory. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the blockchain influence
factor and consumers’ traceability preferences. Novel insights and managerial implications
are proposed.
Our paper is organized as follows. We review the related literature in Section 2. In
Section 3, we build the basic theoretical model and explore the use of blockchain and
government measures in Section 4. We formally conclude this study with suggestions for
future research and management implications in Section 5. To improve readability, all
technical proofs are presented in the Appendices A–F.
2. Literature Review
This study is closely related to the applications of blockchain in supply chain manage-
ment, food traceability systems, and the impact of blockchain on operations management.
The literature concerning blockchain applications in supply chain management abounds.
For example, Chod et al. [16] analyzed the application of blockchain in supply chain
financing. Sander et al. and Tian et al. studied the feasibility of applying blockchain
to operations management [17,18]. Azzi et al. [19] studied the challenges faced by the
blockchain-based supply chain management ecosystem. Kshetri [20] further analyzed
the impact of blockchain on supply chain objectives, such as cost, quality, speed and
reliability, based on a case study. Ivanov et al. [21] studied the impact of digitalization
and Industry 4.0 on supply chain reaction and disruption risk control analysis. Kamble
et al. [22] developed a research model integrating the technology readiness index (TRI),
technology acceptance model (TAM), and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to examine
the adoption of blockchain in the supply chain. They found that supply chain practitioners
perceive BT adoption as effortless and believe it would help derive maximum benefits for
improving supply chain effectiveness. Wang et al. [23] mainly used cognitive mapping and
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 4 of 18
narrative analysis to evaluate people’s cognitive complexity in understanding blockchain
technology. They found that senior executives believe the blockchain can bring benefits such
as improved tracking and traceability to the supply chain. Saberi et al. [24] studied how to
use blockchain technology to design an intelligent signing mechanism in the sustainable
supply chain. Duan et al., Li et al. and Pandey et al. [25–27] used content analysis to discuss
the application, challenges, and future trends of blockchain in the food supply chain. Khan
et al. [28] used the interview method to analyze the benefits and challenges of applying
blockchain technology to agricultural supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic and
proposed solutions. Kouhizadeh et al. [29] discussed the cases and potential applications
of blockchain technology in the supply chain. The above-mentioned literature discusses
the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of different supply chains based on case studies,
sense-making theory, and so on. We use game theory to investigate an introduction strategy
for fresh agricultural enterprises in a competitive market.
The second study theme is a traceability system for fresh produce. Recently, some
scholars focused on how blockchain affects the traditional traceability system. Deng
et al. [30] analyzed the feasibility of using blockchain technology in food traceability.
Behnke and Janssen [31] analyzed the boundary conditions when blockchain was applied
to the food supply chain traceability through case analysis and interviews. Stranieri et al.
and Wang et al. [32,33] found that the traceability system has a positive effect on the food
market and enhances the consumer experience. Stuller and Rickard [34] investigated melon
planting and processing enterprises in California, USA, and found that litigation concerns
and firm reputation are the key drivers for maintaining traceability. Pouliot and Sumner [35]
pointed out that food safety declines with rising numbers of farms and marketers, and
imperfect traceability from consumers to marketers dampens farm liability incentives.
Resende-Filho et al. [36] studied the supply chain composed of upstream and downstream
food enterprises and discussed the quality improvement of upstream enterprises based
on the accuracy of the traceability system. Gong and Chen [37] examined the impact of
traceability on improving food safety levels in the supply chain and the profits of upstream
and downstream enterprises. Aiello [38] used stochastic mathematical programming to
evaluate the operational efficiency of the traceability system of the food supply chain.
Cao et al. [39] designed a blockchain-based human–computer verification mechanism to
strengthen consumers’ trust in the traceability of the cross-border beef supply chain between
Australia and China. Some scholars have studied traceability optimization decisions or
incentive mechanisms under the influence of different factors. Dai et al. [40] analyzed
the interactions of traceability and reliability optimization in a competitive environment
with a product recall. Given the differences in the traceability of suppliers, Hastig and
Sodhi [41] analyzed the need for implementing traceability systems in the cobalt mining
and pharmaceutical industries and analyzed the key success factors of implementing the
blockchain. This article extends the research on the traditional and blockchain traceability
modes for fresh agricultural enterprises, focusing on the introduction strategy in the
presence of demand competition, which is a further supplement to the above-mentioned
literature.
Our third research stream relates to operational management based on the blockchain
using a quantitative method model. Choi [42] assumed that the consumers’ choice of
products is related to the detection time of the product and the falseness of the product,
and they analyzed the impact of blockchain technology on social welfare with uncertain
demand. Zhang and Luo [43] proposed a traceability solution based on blockchain tech-
nology from the perspective of consumer rights. Yan et al. [44] analyzed the impact of
blockchain technology on the upstream and downstream enterprises of the supply chain.
Fan et al. [45] studied the optimal pricing strategies of the supply chain, considering the
consumers‘ traceability awareness. Cao et al. [46] analyzed the impact of blockchain on
the decisions of platforms in the agricultural product supply chain. He et al. [47] analyzed
the impact of blockchain technology on the optimal decision for cross-order e-commerce
platforms and foreign suppliers selling fresh products. As consumers pay increasing atten-
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 5 of 18
tion to product traceability, the verifiability and traceability of information are regarded as
important standards for evaluating product quality, and product traceability is regarded
as an important criterion for evaluating product quality. According to a report from IBM,
71% of consumers are willing to purchase traceable products at 37% higher prices. Zhou
et al. [48] showed that consumers’ organic preferences could affect the production and sales
decisions of the fresh agricultural products supply chain. Closely related is blockchain
introduction strategies for supply chains in a competitive market. Considering consumers’
quality sensitivity, Feng et al. [49] analyzed the impact of blockchain technology on optimal
pricing and quality decisions in the case of two competing platforms. Liu et al. [50] explore
whether the E-platforms choose reselling or agency selling for fresh food in competition
with different traditional retailers. They found that the competition between traditional and
online channels could incentivize firms to invest more in product freshness and blockchain-
enabled traceability goodwill. Assuming the consumers’ traceability awareness as the
sensibility to authentic and verifiable traceability information, Wu et al. [51] analyze a
strategy for adopting blockchain technology in the fresh produce supply chain between
two competitive supply chains. They find that when one supply chain adopts BT, the
other may be a free rider. Different from the literature mentioned above, we focus on the
introduction strategy of the blockchain between two competitive enterprises of fresh agri-
cultural products. We extend the consumers’ traceability preferences for fresh agricultural
products to more realistic factors. We infer that consumers’ traceability preferences relate
to the consumers’ sensitivity to the detection time of fresh agricultural products and to the
falseness of the product and are also related to consumers’ return loss and the probability
of consumers’ return. We also consider consumers’ transfer cost and blockchain cost to
investigate the interactive activities of enterprises in different traceability modes. Unlike
Wu’s conclusion, we find that under competitive circumstances, the enterprise adopting
the blockchain traceability mode gains a competitive advantage, and the other enterprise
adopting the traditional traceability mode is not a free rider when the blockchain influence
factor is in a certain range.
In summary, the major contributions of this study lie in the following aspects. First, we
identify the specific conditions needed for adopting blockchain technology to trace fresh
agricultural products between two competitive enterprises, which has not been explored
in previous studies. Second, we note that the blockchain influence factor has a significant
impact on the introduction of blockchain technology. Third, extending the utility function
of the consumers’ traceability preference as information authenticity, product detection,
and the falseness of the product, we prove that consumers’ traceability preferences have
a significant impact on the introduction of blockchain technology. Finally, we offer some
important and valuable managerial insights for the literature and practice through this
study. When consumers have a high preference for traceability and the blockchain influence
degree is within a certain range, enterprises should adopt a blockchain traceability system.
In a competitive market, enterprises that adopt the blockchain traceability system have a
competitive advantage. The introduction strategy of blockchain is not only related to the
consumers’ traceability preference but also to the transfer cost of consumers and the input
cost of blockchain. We also find that enterprises adopting blockchain traceability systems
gain more customers than enterprises adopting traditional traceability systems.
3. Model Setting and Analysis
3.1. Competitive Decisions under the Traditional Traceability Mode
Suppose that two agricultural enterprises are selling similar agricultural products in
a competitive market. The products provided by the two enterprises can be substituted
for each other. The decision-making order of this article is that the enterprises first choose
whether to introduce blockchain technology, and then consumers choose the enterprises’
products. Assuming that enterprises use blockchain traceability, their entire supply chain
also uses blockchain traceability.
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 6 of 18
Suppose that the market prices of enterprises 1 and 2 are p1 and p2, respectively, and
their production costs are the same. To simplify the calculation, it can be assumed that the
production cost is zero. Choi [42] assumed that the consumers’ choice of products is related
to the detection time of the product and the falseness of the product. Different from Choi’s
assumption, we suppose that consumers’ traceability preference relates to the consumers’
sensitivity to the detection time of fresh agricultural products and to the falseness of the
product, and it is also related to consumers’ return loss and the probability of consumers’
return. Suppose that B represents the possibility of consumer return as a result of the
disclosure of false information by traditional enterprises. ξ denotes the enterprise’s return
loss and τ denotes consumers’ return loss. Assume that the total demand of the agricultural
product market is one, and enterprises 1 and 2 cover the entire market. When neither
enterprise 1 nor 2 joins the blockchain (that is, both enterprises are traditional enterprises),
consumers’ utilities of enterprises 1 and 2 are as follows.
U1 = v− (p1 + βt + (1− α)γ− q)− kx− Bτ, (1)
U2 = v− (p2 + βt + (1− α)γ− q)− k(1− x)− Bτ, (2)
where v represents consumers’ retention value of the product, x represents the consumers’
psychological position between the two enterprises, and k represents the unit transfer cost
of consumers’ purchases from one enterprise to the other. Here, t represents the checking
time of fresh agricultural products, q represents the quality of the agricultural products,
and α represents the possibility that consumers believe the information of the agricultural
products is false. β and γ represent the consumers’ sensitivity to the detection time of fresh
agricultural products and to the falseness of the product, respectively [42].
Consumers will buy from enterprise1 only when U1 ≥ U2, that is, v−
(p1 + βt + (1− α)γ− q) − kx − Bτ ≥ v − (p2 + βt + (1− α)γ− q) − k(1− x) − Bτ. We
can obtain x ≤ p2−p1+k
2k .
Therefore, the market demand of enterprises 1 and 2 is, respectively,
D1 =
p2 − p1 + k
2k
, (3)
D2 =
p1 − p2 + k
2k
. (4)
The profits of enterprise 1 and 2 are, respectively,
π1 = p1·
p2 − p1 + k
2k
− Bξ· p2 − p1 + k
2k
, (5)
π2 = p2·
p1 − p2 + k
2k
− Bξ· p1 − p2 + k
2k
. (6)
Let ∂π1
∂p1
= 0, ∂π2
∂p2
= 0, we can obtain Lemma 1.
Lemma 1. In the traditional traceability mode, the optimal pricing for enterprises 1 and 2 is
p∗1 = p∗2 = k + Bξ, the total market demand for enterprises 1 and 2 is D∗1 = D∗2 = 1
2 , and the
maximum profit for enterprises 1 and 2 is π∗1 = π∗2 = k
2 .
Since ∂p∗1
∂k =
∂p∗2
∂k = 1, ∂π∗1
∂k =
∂π∗2
∂k = 1
2 , the optimal pricing and the profit of both parties
increase with an increase in the unit transfer cost.
∂p∗1
∂B = ξ, ∂p∗1
∂ξ = B, ξ > 0, B > 0, that is, the optimal pricing of both parties increases
with an increase in the possibility of consumer return and the enterprise’s return loss.
Therefore, an optimal solution for both parties’ pricing decisions exists when neither
enterprise 1 nor 2 joins the blockchain. The unit transfer cost, the possibility of consumer
return, and the enterprise’s return loss could affect the optimal pricing and profit of both
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 7 of 18
parties. The optimal pricing decision and profit of both parties increase as the switching
cost increases. Additionally, the optimal pricing of both parties increases as the possibility
of consumer return and the enterprise’s return loss increase.
3.2. Competitive Decision-Making under the Blockchain Traceability Mode
Suppose that enterprise 1 uses blockchain technology to trace the quality of agricul-
tural products, and enterprise 2 does not adopt blockchain technology. Compared with
the traditional traceability system, the blockchain traceability system can ensure informa-
tion security and maintain consumers’ trust in the authenticity of product information.
Therefore, when enterprise 1 uses blockchain technology to trace the source of agricultural
products, consumers believe that the probability of agricultural product information fraud
is zero; that is, α = 0; the probability of consumer returns because of false information
provided by enterprises is zero, that is, B = 0. The quality of the agricultural products
becomes Q (Q ≥ q), and the evaluation time becomes T (T < t). Enterprise 1′s blockchain
input cost is C.
Suppose that consumers have traceability preferences, such that the higher the degree
of traceability preferences, the more likely consumers are willing to select products with
blockchain traceability. Suppose that there are two types of consumers in the market,
namely consumers with a high traceability preference (H) and those with a low traceability
preference (L), where the proportion of the former in the market is θ. T and t represent the
quality evaluation time for blockchain agricultural products and traditional agricultural
products, respectively. Q and q denote the quality of blockchain agricultural products
and traditional agricultural products, respectively. Consumers with a high traceability
preference will buy agricultural products directly from enterprise 1 instead of enterprise
2. Consumers with a low traceability preference are likely to buy from enterprises 1 or 2.
Enterprise 1 uses blockchain and is referred to as a blockchain enterprise, and Enterprise
2 does not use blockchain and is referred to as a traditional enterprise. The utility of
consumers with a low traceability preference is, respectively,
U1
L = v− (p1 + βT −Q)− kx, (7)
U2
L = v− (p2 + βt + (1− α)γ− q)− k(1− x)− Bτ. (8)
when U1
L > U2
L, consumers with a low traceability preference will buy agricultural
products from the blockchain enterprise. The solution is x <
p2−p1+β∆t−∆q+(1−α)γ+k+Bτ
2k ;
therefore, the demand of consumers with a low traceability preference in the market for
enterprises 1 and 2 are, respectively,
D1
L =
p2 − p1 + β∆t− ∆q + (1− α)γ + k + Bτ
2k
(1− θ), (9)
D2
L =
p1 − p2 − β∆t + ∆q− (1− α)γ + k− Bτ
2k
(1− θ). (10)
The total market demand of enterprises 1 and 2 are, respectively,

The profit of enterprises 1 and 2 are, respectively,

Let ∂πB

(15)
p2 =

. (16)
where y = β∆t + (1− α)γ + ∆q represents the blockchain influence factor and reflects the
comprehensive influence of blockchain technology on the quality traceability system of
agricultural product supply chains. β∆t + (1− α)γ represents the unit net benefit for con-
sumers who purchase products from enterprises using blockchain traceability technology.
∆q = Q− q(∆q ≥ 0) represents quality improvement. In the blockchain traceability mode,
the detection of fresh agricultural products belongs to multi-node detection. The reduction
of detection time reduces the quality loss of fresh agricultural products [52]. In addition,
the use of blockchain traceability will encourage suppliers to improve product quality [49].
The higher y is, the greater the positive effect of the blockchain traceability mode. This is
because y is positively related to the unit net benefit of consumers who purchase products
from enterprises using blockchain traceability technology and quality improvement.
From (15) and (16), we can obtain Lemma 2.
Lemma 2. In a competitive environment, the optimal pricing of enterprises 1 and 2 are

and p2

, respectively.
Substituting p1
∗ and p2
∗ into (11) and (12), the total market demand of enterprises 1
and 2 can be obtained as follows:

Substituting p1

are, respectively:

Lemma 2 shows the optimal pricing decision when enterprise 1 adopts a blockchain
traceability system and enterprise 2 insists on adopting a traditional traceability system.
We obtained the optimal price, optimal total market demand, and maximum profit of
enterprises 1 and 2 under the blockchain traceability mode.
4. Results
4.1. Analysis of the Influencing Factors of the Blockchain Introduction Strategy
Proposition 1. In a competitive environment, the enterprise should adopt the blockchain traceability
strategy when the blockchain influence factor satisfies y >
√
18k(1−θ)(C+ k
2 )−4kθ
1−θ − 3k− Bξ − Bτ.
Proof. See Appendix A. �
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 9 of 18
Proposition 1 shows that enterprise 1 can obtain more profits than enterprise 2 when
the blockchain influence factor is greater than a certain threshold. If the enterprise does not
join the blockchain, it must bear the risk of losses arising from consumer returns. In this case,
consumers must bear a longer quality evaluation time, a higher possibility of false quality
information, and more loss of returns. If the enterprise chooses to join the blockchain, it
may be subject to poor economic benefits (such as a slight reduction in consumer quality
assessment time, excessive quality loss, and high costs), and consumers may be subject
to an excessive loss of quality in agricultural products. Because ∂y

4.1. Analysis of the Influencing Factors of the Blockchain Introduction Strategy 
Proposition 1. In a competitive environment, the enterprise should adopt the blockchain tracea-
bility strategy when the blockchain influence factor satisfies 𝑦 > ( ) − 3𝑘 − 𝐵𝜉 −𝐵𝜏. 
Proof. See Appendix A. □ 
Proposition 1 shows that enterprise 1 can obtain more profits than enterprise 2 when 
the blockchain influence factor is greater than a certain threshold. If the enterprise does 
not join the blockchain, it must bear the risk of losses arising from consumer returns. In 
this case, consumers must bear a longer quality evaluation time, a higher possibility of 
false quality information, and more loss of returns. If the enterprise chooses to join the 
blockchain, it may be subject to poor economic benefits (such as a slight reduction in con-
sumer quality assessment time, excessive quality loss, and high costs), and consumers 
may be subject to an excessive loss of quality in agricultural products. Because =𝛥𝑡, = 1 − 𝛼, 𝛥𝑡 > 0,1 − 𝛼 > 0, that is, the sensitivity of consumers to the detection time 
of the product and the sensitivity of consumers to the falseness of the product have a sig-
nificant impact on the blockchain influence factor. The higher the sensitivity of consumers 
to the time of product detection and to the falseness of the product, the higher the block-
chain influence factor. 
The following numerical method is used to illustrate an introduction strategy for 
blockchain. Since the actual value is difficult to obtain, we assume𝐵 = 0.14, 𝜉 = 0.8, 𝜏 =0.4, 𝑘 = 1, C = 3, 𝜃 = 0.5.

duction strategy.

traceability mode. The different shaded areas in the figure represent different decisions. In
a competitive environment, when the influence factor y is among [0, 3.972], enterprise 1
will not adopt blockchain. Because enterprise 1 had to invest a lot of money if enterprise 1
adopts a blockchain traceability system, its profits would be lower than that without
blockchain. When the blockchain influence factor y is higher than 3.972, enterprise 1 will
adopt a blockchain traceability system in a competitive environment because its profit under
the blockchain traceability mode is higher than that in the traditional mode. The sensitivity
of consumers to the detection time of the product and the sensitivity of consumers to
the falseness of the product have a positive impact on the blockchain influence factor.
As the sensitivity of consumers to the detection time of the product and the sensitivity
of consumers to the falseness of the product increase, the blockchain influence factor
will increase. At this time, the adoption of blockchain by enterprise 1 could significantly
improve its profits, so enterprise 1 will adopt blockchain technology.

enterprise 1 adopts a blockchain traceability system, its profits would be lower than that 
without blockchain. When the blockchain influence factor 𝑦 is higher than 3.972, enter-
prise 1 will adopt a blockchain traceability system in a competitive environment because 
its profit under the blockchain traceability mode is higher than that in the traditional 
mode. The sensitivity of consumers to the detection time of the product and the sensitivity 
of consumers to the falseness of the product have a positive impact on the blockchain 
influence factor. As the sensitivity of consumers to the detection time of the product and 
the sensitivity of consumers to the falseness of the product increase, the blockchain influ-
ence factor will increase. At this time, the adoption of blockchain by enterprise 1 could 
significantly improve its profits, so enterprise 1 will adopt blockchain technology.

portion of consumers with a high traceability preference is relatively large. Therefore,

with a high traceability preference is relatively large, enterprise 1 will be prompted to 
adopt the blockchain traceability strategy.

Based on proposition 1, we have ∂πB∗

Corollary 1.
Corollary 1.. In a competitive environment, the profits of enterprise 1 increase with an increase in
the possibility of consumer returns as a result of the disclosure of false information by traditional
enterprises (B), the enterprise’s return loss (ξ), the sensitivity of consumers to the falseness of the
product (γ), the sensitivity of consumers to the detection time of the product (β), and the quality
improvement of the fresh agricultural products (∆q).
Proposition 2. Under a competitive environment, when the blockchain influence factor satisfies
y < 3k− 3k
√
1−θ−2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ or y > 3k + 3k
√
1−θ+2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ, the profit of enterprise 2
under the blockchain traceability mode will be higher than that under the traditional traceability
mode.
Proof. See Appendix B. �
Proposition 2 shows that the maximum profit of enterprise 2 under the blockchain
traceability mode will be higher than under the traditional traceability mode when
blockchain influence factor y is within a certain range. In a competitive environment,
only when y satisfies this range can an enterprise with a traditional traceability system
under the blockchain traceability mode gain more profit.
Based on the conclusion of Proposition 2, Corollary 2 can be obtained.
Corollary 2. In a competitive environment, the maximum profit of enterprise 2 under the blockchain
traceability mode increases with an increase in y when y > 3k + 2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ. The maximum
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 11 of 18
profit of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability mode decreases with an increase in y when
y < 3k + 2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ.
Proof. See Appendix C. �
Corollary 2 shows that when y is in a different range, the maximum profit of enterprise
2 under the blockchain traceability mode is different. y = 3k + 2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ is the critical
point of this range. The maximum profit of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability
mode increases with an increase in y when y > 3k + 2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ. The maximum profit
of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability mode decreases with an increase in y when
y < 3k + 2kθ
1−θ − Bξ − Bτ.
Proposition 3. When the blockchain influence factor satisfies y ≥ −Bξ − Bτ− kθ
1−θ , the introduc-
tion of blockchain in a competitive environment can lead to a shift of demand from the enterprise not
adopting blockchain technology to the enterprise adopting blockchain technology.
Proof. See Appendix D. �
According to proposition 3, when the blockchain influence factor satisfies y ≥ −Bξ −
Bτ − kθ
1−θ , the total market demand of enterprise 1 under the blockchain traceability mode
will be higher than that of enterprise 1 under traditional traceability mode, whereas the
demand of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability model will be lower than that of
enterprise 2 under the traditional traceability mode. That means that some consumers with
a high traceability preference will be willing to buy fresh agricultural products and turn
from enterprises using blockchain technology.
4.2. Analysis of the Influencing Factors of the Optimal Pricing Decision
Proposition 4. Under a competitive environment, when the blockchain influence factor satisfies
y < Bξ
2 − Bτ− kθ
1−θ , the optimal pricing of enterprise 1 under the blockchain traceability mode will
be lower than that of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability mode.
Proof. See Appendix E. �
Proposition 4 shows that if the optimal pricing of enterprise 1 under the blockchain
traceability mode is lower than that of enterprise 2 under the blockchain traceability mode,
the blockchain influence factor needs to satisfy y < Bξ
2 − Bτ − kθ
1−θ . That means, in a
competitive environment, when y is less than a certain value, the price of a blockchain
enterprise is less than that of an enterprise that does not use blockchain technology.
Proposition 5. Under a competitive environment, the optimal pricing of enterprises 1 and 2
increases with an increase in the enterprises’ return loss, the unit transfer cost, and the proportion
of consumers with a high traceability preference. The optimal pricing of enterprise 1 increases with
an increase in y, γ, β, τ, and ∆q. Meanwhile, the optimal pricing of enterprise 2 decreases with an
increase in y,γ, β, τ, and ∆q.
Proof. See Appendix F. �
Proposition 5 shows that the optimal pricing is related to the enterprises’ return loss,
the unit transfer cost, and the proportion of consumers with a high traceability preference.
In the blockchain traceability mode, consumers’ sensitivity to the detection time of the
product β and the falseness of the product γ, blockchain influence factor y, consumers’
return loss τ, and quality improvement could affect the optimal pricing for both blockchain
enterprises and traditional enterprises. The optimal pricing of enterprise 1 increases with
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 12 of 18
an increase in y, γ, β, τ, and ∆q. Meanwhile, the optimal pricing of enterprise 2 decreases
with an increase in y, γ,β, τ, and ∆q.
5. Conclusions
Increasingly, consumers pay attention to the reliability and authenticity of agricultural
product information. Traditional traceability systems are usually based on centralized
information management systems, and information can be easily tampered with and
forged. It is difficult for customers to verify the authenticity of the information. Assuming
that the consumers’ traceability preference is related to the detection time of the product
and to the falseness of the product, this study examines the blockchain introduction strategy
of fresh agricultural enterprises with two competitive enterprises based on non-cooperative
game theory. In the traditional traceability mode, we consider two enterprises that do
not use blockchain technology and derive the profit functions of the two enterprises. The
optimal pricing and the maximum profits of the two enterprises are obtained through
theoretical analysis. In the blockchain traceability mode, we consider the scenario where
one enterprise uses blockchain technology and the other enterprise does not. Then, we
construct the profit functions of the two enterprises. The optimal pricing and the maximum
profits of the two enterprises are obtained through theoretical analysis. By comparing
the profits in two different traceability modes, we obtained the specific conditions for
the enterprise to introduce blockchain technology. Subsequently, we analyzed the impact
of consumer traceability preference and blockchain influence factor. The results can be
summarized as follows.
First, adopting blockchain technology is not always good for enterprises in a compet-
itive environment. This conclusion is similar to that of Wu et al. [51]. However, we find
that in specific conditions, the enterprise adopting blockchain technology as a traceability
system will obtain a competitive advantage, and the enterprise not adopting blockchain
technology as a traceability system will not be a free rider. Because the profit of an en-
terprise not adopting blockchain technology when its competitor adopts the blockchain
technology is lower than the profit when the two enterprises do not adopt the blockchain
technology, it is different from the view of Wu et al. [51], who found that when one supply
chain adopts blockchain technology, the other may be a free rider. Furthermore, we found
that the introduction strategy of blockchain technology relates to the transfer cost with
consumers and the investment cost of blockchain technology. When the transfer cost with
consumers and the investment cost is in a certain range, it is good for the enterprise to adopt
blockchain technology. Moreover, in a competitive environment, the profit of blockchain
enterprises increases with an increase in the possibility of consumer returns as a result of
the disclosure of false information by traditional enterprises, the enterprise’s return loss,
the sensitivity of consumers to the falseness of the product, the sensitivity of consumers to
the detection time of the product, and the quality improvement of the agricultural products.
Second, we observe that the decision to introduce blockchain technology in a com-
petitive environment is related to the blockchain influence factor. Enterprises will intro-
duce blockchain technology when the blockchain influence factor is greater than a certain
value. When the blockchain influence factor is less than a certain value, the optimal
price of blockchain enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode is lower than that
of traditional enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode. We discovered that
the blockchain influence factor has a significant impact on enterprise pricing. As the
blockchain influence factor increases, the optimal pricing of blockchain enterprises will
increase, whereas that of traditional enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode will
decrease. This study also showed that the enterprises’ return loss, unit transfer costs, and
proportion of consumers with a high traceability preference could influence the optimal
price of enterprises. With an increase in the enterprises’ return loss, unit transfer costs, and
the proportion of consumers with a high traceability preference, the optimal pricing of
blockchain and traditional enterprises under the blockchain traceability mode will increase.
Mathematics 2023, 11, 1090 13 of 18
Thirdly, we discover that the consumers’ traceability preferences could affect the
optimal pricing and profits of enterprises. The profits of blockchain enterprises increase
with an increase in the possibility of consumer returns as a result of the disclosure of false
information by traditional enterprises, the sensitivity of consumers to the falseness of the
product, and the sensitivity of consumers to the detection time of the product. The optimal
pricing of blockchain enterprises increases with an increase in the proportion of consumers
with a high traceability preference. The optimal pricing of blockchain enterprises increases
with an increase in the consumers’ sensitivity to the time of product detection, consumers’
sensitivity to the falseness of the product and consumers’ return loss. Our results also show
that introducing blockchain into a competitive environment can lead to a shift in demand.
We find that, in a competitive environment, the total market demand of enterprises applying
the blockchain traceability system will increase, whereas that of traditional enterprises
under the traditional traceability system will decrease. This means that some consumers
with a high traceability preference will be willing to buy fresh agricultural products from
enterprises using blockchain technology.
Based on our research results, we provide several implications for managers of fresh
product enterprises. Enterprises should focus on two aspects when considering the in-
troduction of blockchain technology. First, enterprises should consider the consumers‘
preference for the detection time of the product and the falseness of the product. If the
proportion of consumers with a high traceability preference reaches a certain threshold,
enterprises should adopt a blockchain traceability system. For example, enterprises should
introduce a blockchain traceability system if consumers in the market become more con-
cerned about food safety issues and are skeptical about the source of food and other
information. Furthermore, enterprises should focus on the blockchain influence factor.
Enterprises should introduce blockchain technology when the blockchain influence factor
reaches a certain value. We found that the quality improvement caused by the use of
the blockchain traceability mode will positively impact the blockchain influence factor.
Enterprises should pay attention to the quality loss under the traditional mode. When the
quality loss of fresh agricultural products is too significant, it is beneficial for enterprises to
introduce blockchain technology to improve product quality. Moreover, enterprises should
focus on the blockchain influence factor. Enterprises should introduce blockchain technol-
ogy when the blockchain influence factor is in a certain range. This certain value is related
to many factors, such as the possibility of consumer return as a result of the disclosure of
false information by traditional processors, the processor’s return loss, consumers’ return
loss, and so on. When consumers cannot bear the cost of return of goods due to the untrue
information disclosed by some enterprises and the losses caused by the return of goods are
large enough, enterprises in the same industry will be more willing to adopt blockchain
technology.
Finally, we note some potential directions for future research. First, we assume that
the quality and return costs are both exogenous parameters in the model; the situation
where both or one of them are endogenous parameters is worthy of further study. Sec-
ond, this study assumed that enterprises establishing blockchain traceability would trace
the production process and analyze the introduction strategy of competitive enterprises.
However, the cost of building a blockchain traceability system platform is high. Some en-
terprises probably choose blockchain traceability services provided by third-party trading
platforms. It would be interesting to investigate the impact of blockchain on the interaction
mechanisms between fresh agricultural enterprises and third-party trading platforms.

Since y ≥ −Bξ − Bτ − kθ
