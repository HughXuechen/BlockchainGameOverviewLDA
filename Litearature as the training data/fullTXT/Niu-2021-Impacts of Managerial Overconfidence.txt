ABSTRACT We study the effects of managerial overconfidence and agency costs on cash holdings of
blockchain firms, where the overconfidence is defined as a cognitive bias that a manager will underestimate
volatility in an uncertain environment. We develop a real-options game model that incorporates both
overconfidence and agency costs. The theoretical results show that future investment opportunities are
necessary for holding cash when agency costs are within the firm. Expected returns from blockchain
projects decrease with managerial overconfidence. The level of corporate cash holdings increases with
overconfidence and decreases with agency costs. Using the data of Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2019,
we find that the regression results are consistent with our theoretical findings. Moreover, we find that the
blockchain firms’ cash holdings are higher than their peers. Our results shed some light on the impacts of
behavioral characteristics on cash holdings.
INDEX TERMS Agency costs, blockchain, corporate cash holdings, managerial overconfidence.
I. INTRODUCTION
The decision of cash holdings is a key financing strategy
in corporate finance, especially when firms are involved in
blockchain projects. Because each block in a blockchain
contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, trans-
action data, and timestamp, blockchain technology could
ensure the integrity of the transaction data stored on the
blockchain [11]. Chedrawi and Howayeck [10] argue that
blockchain technology shares four characteristics: decentral-
ized, distributed, disruptive, and divine. With these features,
blockchain technology can solve information asymmetry and
lay the foundation for establishing trust between sellers and
buyers [9], [29]. Moreover, the blockchain has rich applica-
tion scenarios that enable collaborative trust and consistent
action among multiple individuals. For example, blockchain
technology has more significant advantages in reducing risks
and information asymmetry than traditional auditing [10];
it can also allow personal data to be accessed to help
policymakers improve the provision of public services [13].
However, these characteristics make it difficult to assess the
value of the blockchain project. Therefore, firms should be

more cautious in arranging their cash policies when facing
investment opportunities in blockchain projects.
Traditionally, the literature has analyzed the determinants
of cash holdings from a rational and unbiased perspective.
Some of the critical studies within the cash holdings topic
have argued that one of the essential rationales for holding
cash reserves is to address contingent risk, referred to as
the precautionary motive [19], [23], [32]. However, with the
development of behavioral finance research in recent years,
some studies have found that managers’ irrational behaviors
significantly impact corporate financial decisions [1], [12],
[15]. More specifically, among such behaviors, the cogni-
tive bias caused by managerial overconfidence is a typical
one [30]. The cognitive bias caused by overconfidence makes
managers behave and make decisions in uncertain environ-
ments as if they were in a much lower volatility environment.
However, the uncertainty of reality still governs the outcome
of those behaviors [24], [26], [35].
Literature on many topics provides empirical evidence for
managerial overconfidence, including operations [27] and
finance [1], [12]. Malmendier and Tate [30] documented that
managers are more prone to cognitive bias of overconfidence
when faced with more complicated tasks. Therefore, consid-
ering the difficulty of blockchain technology, we argue that it
is necessary to account for the impact of overconfidencewhen

investigating firms’ cash policies involved in blockchain
projects.
Agency costs arising from the misalignment of interests
between shareholders and managers can also impact the
decision-making of cash holdings [22]. The shareholders
expect the managers’ behaviors to maximize their wealth,
while the managers tend to engage in issues from their inter-
ests, especially free cash flows within the firms. The share-
holders have to incur agency costs to address the free cash
flow problems. The complexity of blockchain projects drives
up the information asymmetry between the managers and the
shareholders. Therefore, agency costs cannot be neglected
when studying blockchain firms’ cash strategies.
This study investigates the impacts of managerial overcon-
fidence and agency costs on cash holdings within blockchain
firms. Accordingly, the firm’s cash policy involving a
blockchain project is characterized mainly by two man-
agerial behaviors: a cognitive bias when the manager esti-
mates the market demand of the blockchain project and an
agency behavior when the manager pursues his interests in
operating the firm. This study differs from the traditional
scenario where managers are rational and unbiased. We first
develop a cash management model that incorporates manage-
rial overconfidence and agency costs into a firm. A geometric
Brownian motion governs the cash flows generated by the
existing assets of the firm. A shareholder decides how much
cash should be retained from the cash flow into the firm. The
shareholder has to trade off the agency costs of retaining cash
within the firm against the opportunity costs of implementing
the blockchain project. Expressly, we assume that the agency
costs are a power function concerning the cash retention
proportion.
Furthermore, a manager jointly determines when to initiate
a blockchain project and raise external funds from a financier.
Based on the estimation of the market demand, the manager
decides whether implement the blockchain project. When
there is uncertainty in market demand for the blockchain
project, overconfidence bias leads the manager to make deci-
sions as if he faced a more certain demand. Meanwhile,
the manager can have access to external financing from a
financier in a competitive capital market. Although exter-
nal financing allows more flexibility in timing blockchain
project implementation, it must be subject to the financier’s
monitoring that the manager perceives as costly. Accord-
ingly, the financier perceives that his monitoring improves the
blockchain project’s value, but he also has to pay the monitor-
ing cost that relies on transparency. Our model consists of two
phases: cash retention from cash flow and the implementation
of the blockchain project. The cash retention process engages
the shareholder and themanager, while the blockchain project
implementation process mainly involves the manager and the
financier.
We then derive the model’s equilibrium and find that the
firm’s future investment opportunities are necessary to retain
cash internally when agency costs exist. In other words, if no
investment opportunities are available in the future, the firm
should not retain any cash in the context of shareholder wealth
maximization. All cash flows generated by the firm’s assets
should be paid back to shareholders as dividends. Other-
wise, if there are possible investment opportunities within the
framework of agency costs in power function form, the opti-
mal cash retention ratio for the shareholder’s decision makes
the evolution of the cash holdings the level also subject to
a geometric Brownian motion. Both the mean and volatility
of the cash holding growth rate increase with the agency
cost. Overconfidence results in the manager underestimating
the uncertainty of the market demand for the blockchain
project. When the market demand is uncertain, this under-
estimation of volatility decreases the blockchain project’s
expected return. We find that the optimal level of cash hold-
ings for firms that invest in blockchain projects increases with
managerial overconfidence and decreases with agency costs.
Further, when managers also choose the firm’s transparency
when raising external financing, the more overconfident the
manager is, the more transparent the firm is.
We also apply data on Chinese listed companies over
2010-2019 to provide empirical evidence for the theoretical
analysis. Based on the existing literature [20], [32], [33],
we control a battery of corporate finance variables and gover-
nance in the regression analysis. In particular, the regression
results show that the level of cash holdings is positively
and negatively related to overconfidence and agency costs,
respectively. These results are consistent with our theoret-
ical findings. Further, compared to their peers, the firms
that have announced participating in blockchain have sig-
nificantly higher cash holdings levels. Managerial overcon-
fidence positively moderates this positive correlation, but
not significantly. In conclusion, our regression results are
generally consistent with the theoretical analysis. These find-
ings contribute to the literature investigating the determinants
of cash holdings for one behavioral characteristic prevalent
among managers [30].

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
This study is related to two literature streams: manage-
rial overconfidence and determinants of cash holdings. The
emerging literature of managerial overconfidence highlights
that the impact of irrational and biased behaviors on finan-
cial decisions cannot be non-negligible since these decisions
are made by human beings whose cognitive abilities are
limited. Schweitzer and Cachon’s seminal study [39] finds
a pull-to-center effect in a lab experiment, suggesting that the
subjects choose an order size between the mean and the opti-
mal quantity. Since then, multiple studies have found that this
effect holds even when changing the experimental setup [5],
[17]. Ren et al. [35] argue that overconfidence can reasonably
account for the pull-to-center effect. In empirical studies, due
to the critical work of Malmendier and Tate [30], a growing
141454 VOLUME 9, 2021

body of literature relatesmanagerial overconfidence to corpo-
rate behaviors, including investment efficiency [21], dividend
policy [15], and cash holdings [1], [12]. Salehi et al. [36]
argue that overconfidence leads a manager to believe himself
is at a higher level than his peers, and the biased belief,
in turn, contributes to take more risks. Using the Tehran Stock
Exchange sample, Salehi et al. [36] obtain empirical evidence
and find that managerial overconfidence positively affects
corporate risk-taking. Because of irrational cognitive biases,
overconfident managers believe financial markets undervalue
their companies’ investment returns and stock prices. There-
fore, they are likely to delay recognition of losses and useless
the conditional conservatism in accounting. Salehi et al. [37]
find a negative relationship between managerial overconfi-
dence and conditional conservatism.Overconfidentmanagers
tend to invest with internal funds, in which operating cash
flow has higher priority and is likely to be exhausted rapidly.
In such a situation, the managers have strong incentives
to adjust cash flow levels to avoid negative operating cash
flows. Yang and Kim [41] find that overconfident managers
are more likely to adjust negative operating cash flow to
positive and engage in higher discretion of operating cash
flow than their rational peers. Overconfident cognitive bias
leads management to expect the firm to enjoy a good growth
prospect in the near term and to believe that cash flow is
stable and abundant. Therefore, managerial overconfidence
might lead the firm to increase dividend payments. However,
suppose a firm is faced with good investment opportunities.
In that case, managerial overconfidence might instead yield
lower dividend payments, as the firm will prioritize retained
earnings to meet investment needs. Using a Vietnamese sam-
ple, Nguyen et al. [31] find that managerial overconfidence
positively impacts dividend payout. Overconfident managers
overestimate the return on investment projects while per-
ceiving the cost of external financing to be too high. As a
result, they may overinvest when internal funds are sufficient;
when internal funds are insufficient, they are reluctant to
engage in external financing due to the unduly perceived
cost of financing. Notably, cash flow can be one of the
sources of project financing, which implies that adequate cash
flow can mitigate the underinvestment problem. Therefore,
the relationship between investment and cash flow is higher
in firms run by overconfident managers. Bukalska [8] finds
that managerial overconfidence is positively associated with
the investment-cash flow sensitivity. Despite the irrationality
of managerial overconfidence, it still might exert some posi-
tive consequences. Salehi and Moghadam [38] use return on
assets to measure firm performance and find that managerial
overconfidence is positively associated with performance,
and agency costs did not significantly affect performance.
Seifzadeh et al. [40] find a significantly positive relationship
between managerial overconfidence and financial statement
readability.
This study is also related to the literature on the deter-
minants of cash holdings. Previous studies show that the
precautionary motive is the driver for the buffer-construction
behavior of maintaining excess liquidity for coping with the
unexpected future contingency [20], [23], [28], [32], [34].
The precautionary motive stems from asymmetric informa-
tion in capital markets [23]. In a frictionless world, the opti-
mal level of cash holdings is zero because firms would
always raise any funds needed with fair costs. However,
in the real world, the information asymmetry between firms
and capital markets forces up the cost of raising funds. The
unfair external financing cost is on the higher side, which
increases the cost of financial distress [23]. Therefore, firms
hold precautionary cash to cope with this situation and hedge
against future adverse events [4], [28]. Even firms with
access to capital markets might not choose to raise exter-
nal funds when informational asymmetry is high and firms
are undervalued [16]. Based on the precautionary motive,
the existing literature has summarized several determinants,
including financial characteristics, corporate governance, and
the macroeconomic environment. Opler et al. [32] demon-
strate that many financial characteristics can be regarded as
the determinants of cash holdings, including growth oppor-
tunities, cash flow risks, firm size, and access to capital
markets. Pinkowitz et al. [34] are also concerned about this
secure increasing issue but focus on multinational firms.
Benjamin et al. [6] have shown that the level of waste dis-
closure is positively related to cash holdings. They argue that
holding precautionary cash reserves can be regarded as the
ability to meet future environmental demands. We extend the
literature by taking managerial overconfidence and agency
costs into a cash holdings model to investigate their theoret-
ical impacts and management insights. Moreover, we incor-
porate the empirical evidence into the management insights.
Our study’s most closely related studies include Boot and
Vladimirov [7], and Datta [14]. We differ from them as
follows. Boot and Vladimirov [7] investigate the optimal
level of cash holdings for investments when the firm has
access to external financing. However, they assume that the
evolution of cash holdings follows a geometric Brownian
motion. Their study focuses on the changes in cash holdings
themselves while there are no agency costs. We incorporate
the cash retention stage into our model, i.e., the changes of
cash holdings stem from two sources: the risk-free growth of
cash holdings themselves and the retention from cash flows.
Although Datta [14] takes managerial overconfidence and
agency problems into the investing timing model, his model
is established on the belief updating. Our model focuses on
the decision-making of the optimal cash holdings when the
firm faces investment opportunities. Moreover, our theoreti-
cal analysis is supported by empirical evidence from Chinese
listed firms.
III. MODEL SETUP
This section considers a model with three players: a share-
holder, a manager, and a financier. Our model features a
setting in which a firm generates stochastic cash flows. The
firm is owned by the shareholder and run by the overconfident
manager. The shareholder bears agency costs because of the

T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
free cash flow problem. Also, there is a future investment
opportunity for the firm to implement a risky blockchain
project. The manager has an option to delay the implemen-
tation and can raise external funds from the financier.
A. AGENCY COSTS AND CASH HOLDINGS
Suppose that the firm’s existing assets generate stochastic
cash flows ωt governed by a geometric Brownian motion:
dωt = µωtdt + σωtdzt , (1)
where µ > 0 and σ ≥ 0 are the mean and volatility of
the growth rate of ω, and dzt is a standard Brownian motion.
Assume that µ < r , where r is the risk-free interest rate [7].
The shareholder would accumulate cash holdings to pre-
pare for the demands of future investment opportunities.
There are two main ways of accumulation. First, the reserva-
tion of cash flows. If cash flows are not paid out or invested,
they are reserved within the firm as cash holdings. Second,
the risk-free growth of cash holdings. The firm’s reserved
cash is put on a cash account and could earn a risk-free
return r . Since raising external funds is costly, it seems like
that the shareholder should keep all the generated cash flows
within the firm to avoid cash shortage.
However, retaining cash is also costly for the shareholder
because of the free cash flow problem [22]. The manager
might abuse cash for his private profits, which results in
value-destroying consequences upon the firm when the level
of cash holdings is high. To prevent the manager from that,
the shareholder has to implement monitoring and therefore
bear agency costs. Previous literature argues that only the
instantaneous increment of the retained cash flows must be
monitored regarding the relationship between cash holdings
and agency costs. This argument’s main reason is that the pre-
viously retained cash flows and the risk-free growth of cash
holdings have already been allocated to a cash account [2],
[25]. Namely, the manager cannot abuse cash holdings all as
he wishes.
Denoting the retained fraction of cash flows as α,
we assume that agency costs are C(α), where C ′(α) > 0 and
C ′′(α) > 0. Specifically, we assume that
C(α) = αθc, (2)
where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 and θ ≥ 1. The parameter θ reflects the ease
of shareholder monitoring. A larger θ represents more ease
for the shareholder to monitor the manager. Easier monitor-
ing implies a greater convergence of objectives between the
shareholder and the manager. In this case, the agency costs
borne by shareholders are lower. Given the cash retention
ratio α, the agency costs C(α) decrease in the shareholder’s
monitoring ease θ .
Furthermore, the specification of power function in (2)
assumes that agency costs are convex increasing in the
retained fraction of cash flows. It captures the intuition that
if there is a positive cash flow shock to the firm, more cash is
retained, and the manager is more likely to misuse the cash
holdings. Hence, the shareholder’s agency costs are higher.
Moreover, the specification of agency costs in our model
encompasses two different forms as exceptional cases. If
θ = 1, we obtain the agency costs in the linear form [18].
The agency costs are assumed to be a fixed ratio of the
retained cash flows in this form. Expending the cost form to a
non-linear one considers the agency problem in the financial
policies’ decision-making. If θ = 2, we obtain the agency
costs in the quadratic form [25]. Our specification differs in
that the agency problem could be more severe.
Let ht denote the cash holdings and st denote the retained
cash flows. Combining with the stochastic process of cash
flows in (1), we could get that
E[dht ] = stdt + rhtdt, (3)
where st = αωt−αθc. The left-hand part serves the expected
increment of cash holdings, while the right-hand part cov-
ers the two sources of the increment. The first term on the
right-hand part represents the cash retained from cash flows
and stored in the firm, and the second term represents the
risk-free growth of the cash holding itself.
B. MANAGERIAL OVERCONFIDENCE
AND EXTERNAL FUNDS
The firm owns an option to initiate a risky blockchain project
with an investment of K . The blockchain project requiring an
investment ofK produces productions with a random demand
X and a unit variable cost v. The distribution function (CDF)
of X is FX (·). As a price-taker, the expected profit of the
blockchain project is
π = pE[X ∧ q]−vq, (4)
where x ∧ y = min{x, y} and p is the price of selling
each unit of the production. Our model features managerial
overconfidence by a distorted demand perception [26], [27].
Specifically, the manager should have determined the optimal
quantity q∗ according to the corresponding first-order condi-
tion to maximize the profits. However, the manager exhibits
the cognitive bias of overconfidence by making the quantity
decision as though the demand distribution were FD (·) rather
than FX (·), where
D = βE[X ]+ (1− β)X , (5)
for β ∈ [0, 1]. That is, the overconfident manager determines
the optimal quantity q̂(β) as though he were maximizing
πD = pE [D ∧ q]−cq. However, the corresponding profits
of the blockchain project are π̂ (β) = pE[X ∧ q̂(β)]−vq̂(β).
The timeline of our model is illustrated in Figure 1. In the
beginning, the firm does not have enough cash in hand to
fund the blockchain project internally, but the investment
opportunity can be postponed. The manager has discretion
about the timing of initiating the blockchain project. Also,
there is a financier from whom the firm can raise external
funds in equity. Considering the financial market is compet-
itive, the manager needs to promise the financier an equity
fraction of γ .

FIGURE 1. Timeline of the model.
The external funds are expensive for themanager due to the
discrepancy in the blockchain project’s value between the
manager and the financier [7]. In the financier’s perspec-
tive, the blockchain project’s value increases in the moni-
toring intensity M , so his overall value is Mπ . Meanwhile,
there is a cost to the financier of M2/(2φ) for monitoring
and interference. The parameter φ reflects the ease of the
financier’s monitoring, determined by the manager’s trans-
parency policy. A higher φ implies the manager makes the
firm more transparent and comfortable for the financier to
monitor. Therefore, the financier’s monitoring costs decrease
in φ. From the manager’s perspective, the financier’s inter-
ference is costly, so that the manager might prefer a lower
level of transparency. Denote the costs from the manager’s
perspective as ψ(M ), increasing and convex in the amount of
interference from the financier M . Specifically, we assume
that ψ(M ) = (M2/2)λ, where λ > 0.
IV. EQUILIBRIUM
This section applies the real-option game framework to find
the model’s equilibrium solution and provides several propo-
sitions on the equilibrium solution sensitivity analysis. The
formalized proofs corresponding to each proposition are
presented in the appendix.
A. EVOLUTION PROCESS OF CASH HOLDINGS
Given the agency costs within the firm, the shareholder’s
problem is retaining the optimal fraction of cash flows to take
the opportunity to initiate the blockchain project. Suppose
there are no future investment opportunities and there are no
new blockchain projects in the short term. The shareholder,
therefore, is reluctant to retain and store cash in the firm since
the retention would cause him to suffer additional agency
costs. Alternatively, suppose the blockchain project has not
yet been implemented. In that case, the shareholder needs to
trade off the benefit of reducing the external funding costs
against the loss from the agency costs. Then, the shareholder’s
objective is shown as follows.
st = max
α
{αωt − α
θc}. (6)
Therefore, given the shareholder’s monitoring parameter θ ,
the optimal retaining fraction α∗ can be derived according to
the first-order condition as follows:
α∗ =
(ωt
cθ
) 1
θ−1
, (7)
and the corresponding level of cash saving s∗t is
s∗t = κω

t , (8)
where κ =
(
1− 1
θ
) (

cθ
) 1
θ−1
> 0 and η = θ
θ−1 > 1.
Considering the stochastic process of cash flows in (1) and
the relationship between cash flows and cash holdings in (3),
we can derive that the following equation governs the level of
cash holdings ht :

Proposition 1 represents the equilibrium level of cash
holdings.
Proposition 1: Because agency costs exist, the optimal
cash-retaining policy for the shareholder is contingent upon
whether the blockchain project has been implemented or not:
(a) If the blockchain project has already been implemented,
the optimal policy retains no cash and pays all the cash flows
as dividends.
(b) If the blockchain project has not been implemented
yet, the optimal cash holdings are governed by the following
geometric Brownian motion:
dht = µhhtdt + σhhtdz, (10)
where µh = 1
2σ
2η(η − 1) + µη > µ and σh = ση > σ are
the mean and volatility of cash holdings, respectively. In addi-
tion, both µh and σh are decreasing in the shareholder’s
monitoring ease θ .
The management implications of Proposition 1 are as
follows. In the absence of a free cash flow problem, the man-
ager’s objectives are aligned with those of the shareholder.
In this scenario, the optimal cash holdings strategy should be
retaining and storing all the generated cash flows to cope with
future investment opportunities. In contrast, if the shareholder
has to bear agency costs, retaining and storing the entire cash
flows in the firm is not the optimal decision because the
manager may use the free cash for private gain, resulting in
a loss of shareholder benefit. In such a case, the shareholder
tends to allocate a portion of cash flows to dividend payments
and keep the remaining cash flows for future investment
opportunities. Proposition 1 implies that agency costs are why
firms pay dividends even when there are future investment
opportunities.
VOLUME 9, 2021 141457
T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
The agency costs also influence the evolution process of
cash holdings. Considering θ > 1 and combining the expres-
sions of µh and σh in Proposition 1, we can obtain µh > µ
and σh > σ , which documents that the mean and volatility
of growth rate of cash holdings are higher than those of
cash flows. Moreover, as mentioned, the easier it is for the
shareholder tomonitor themanager, the lower the agency cost
that the shareholder has to bear, i.e., ∂C/∂θ < 0. Intuitively,
this would drive up the rate of cash retentions, which would
lead to an evolutionary process of cash holdings with a higher
mean and volatility of cash holdings’ growth rate. How-
ever, the reverse is the case. The counter-intuitive results are
because cash holdings’ evolution process includes retained
cash flows and risk-free growth. In the scenario where the
shareholder’s monitoring is easier, the effect of retained cash
flows on cash holdings is not sufficient to offset the risk-free
growth. Therefore, the final result shows that both the mean
and volatility decline with the ease of monitoring. That is,
∂µh/∂θ < 0 and ∂σh/∂θ < 0.
B. MANAGERIAL OVERCONFIDENCE
Since the firm does not need to hold any cash when the risky
blockchain project has already been implemented, we focus
on the alternative case where the opportunity to implement
the risky blockchain project still exists. In this scenario,
the firm needs to maintain a certain level of cash holdings
rather than paying all cash flows as dividends. Moreover,
the manager’s decision on the cash holdings threshold
depends mainly on the blockchain project’s amount of invest-
ment versus its expected profits. In particular, the expected
profits resulting from the blockchain project output that meets
the market demand. However, the manager’s estimate of mar-
ket demand is distorted by his overconfidence. Therefore,
the key to determining the optimal cash holdings threshold
is the project’s expected profits implemented by the overcon-
fident manager.
Given (4) and (5), Proposition 2 summarizes the optimal
output and resulting expected profits.
Proposition 2: Given the distribution function FX (·), its
inverse function F−1X (·), and the level of managerial over-
confidence β, the manager optimally chooses his quantity as
q̂(β) = βE[X ] + (1 − β)q∗ and obtains the corresponding
profits π̂ (β), where q∗ = F−1X (ζ ) and ζ = (p − v)/p.
In addition, π̂ (β) is decreasing in β.
The management insights of Proposition 2 are shown
below. It illustrates the equilibrium output determined by the
overconfident manager when the market demand is uncer-
tain and the blockchain project’s expected profit at that out-
put level. The results also show that the expected profit
decreases in managerial overconfidence. The reason is that
the manager’s overconfidence makes his estimate of mar-
ket demand deviate from the actual level. According to (5),
under the condition of randommarket demand, the manager’s
overconfidence does not affect his estimation of the mean.
Still, it causes his estimation of the variance to be biased.
In particular, the overconfident manager underestimates the
market demand variance. This underestimation leads to a
deviation from the real situation in the first-order condi-
tion of the blockchain project’s expected profit to output,
leading to non-optimal blockchain project output decisions.
The realized profit is affected as well. Consequently, as the
level of overconfidence increases, the expected profit of the
blockchain project decreases.
C. CASH HOLDINGS THRESHOLD AND TRANSPARENCY
1) THE SIMPLE MODEL
We abstract from the transparency decision for clarity in our
analysis and focus on the relationship between agency costs,
managerial overconfidence, and cash holdings. To this end,
we assume that the financier’s monitoring intensity is binary:
either nomonitoring or completemonitoring, i.e.,M ∈ {0, 1}.
With this setup, there are only two scenarios. The manager
can only fund the blockchain project with cash holdings if
M = 0. Alternatively, if M = 1, the manager has access to
the financier’s external funds. In the latter case, the value of
the blockchain project in the financier’s perspective is π̂ (β).
As for the manager’s transparency decision, it is optimal to
be infinity, i.e., φ → ∞. The reason is that greater trans-
parency allows the manager for a more significant proportion
of the blockchain project’s equity stake when raising a given
amount of external funds.
Themanager obtains the external fundsK−ht by selling an
equity stake of the blockchain project to the financier. Since in
the competitive market, the financier can only earn a retained
return at the break-even point by purchasing the equity stake.
Specifically, the proportion of promises to the financier is
γ =
K − ht
π
. (11)
Therefore, the manager’s net payoff is
Y (ht , β) =
(
1−
K − ht
π
)
π̂ (β)−
λ
2
− ht . (12)
As π̂ (β) ≤ π and 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, the manager’s payoff
Y (ht , β) is decreasing in the level of cash holdings ht .
We now derive how the agency costs and the managerial
overconfidence affect the timing of investing and the cash
policy. The manager’s objective is to determine the optimal
level of cash holdings ĥ to implement the blockchain project
and maximize the value of the option to invest U . The man-
ager’s expected payoff is
U (ht , ĥ) = max E
[

T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
U (ht , ĥ)|ht=ĥ = Y (ĥ, β), (16)
Uĥ(ht , ĥ)|ht=ĥ = Yĥ(ĥ, β), (17)
where the subscript of U denotes the corresponding partial
derivative.
The first condition in (15) states that if the level of cash
holdings reaches zero, there is no value of the option. The
evolution process of cash holdings is governed by geometric
Brownian motion. If the level of cash holdings is zero at any
time, it remains zero in the subsequent period. In this case,
the investment of the blockchain project relies entirely on
external financing. Therefore, the value of the option equals
zero. The second condition in (16) is the value-matching
condition, which implies that the value of the option should
be equal to the payoff of investment when the level of cash
holdings reaches the threshold. The last condition in (17) is
the smooth-pasting condition, which ensures that the thresh-
old exists and maximizes the option’s value.
Proposition 3: If the manager has access to the external
funds, the optimal level of cash holdings is given by
ĥ =

. The level of
cash holdings increases in the managerial overconfidence
and decreases in the agency costs, i.e., ∂ ĥ/∂β > 0 and
∂ ĥ/∂θ > 0.
Naturally, the cost of postponing investment timing weighs
less when there is more ease of the shareholder’s monitoring,
raising cash holdings. Moreover, if the overconfidence is
more severe, the lower the cost of delaying the execution
of the option. Firms with greater managerial overconfidence
tend to invest later, implying a positive relationship between
cash holdings and overconfidence.
2) THE SOPHISTIC MODEL
When the firm’s cash holdings are insufficient to cover the
blockchain project’s investment needs, the manager needs
external financing to fill the funding gap. The manager sig-
nals the need for external funds to the financier in a compet-
itive financial market and finances the funds in the form of
shares. Therefore, the financier has to decide on the percent-
age of shares γ and the monitoring intensity M .
Given γ , the financier decides his monitoring intensityM :
M = argmin
M
(
γMπ −
M2
2φ
)
. (19)
As mentioned, the financier is in a competitive finan-
cial market. Hence, when the manager raises funds K − ĥ,
the financier can only obtain the payoff at the break-even
condition:
γMπ −
M2
2φ
− (K − ĥ) = 0. (20)
Proposition 4: The optimal monitoring intensity of the
financier M∗ is as follows:
M∗ =
√
2φ(K − ĥ). (21)
The equilibrium equity fraction of the financier γ ∗ is as
follows:
γ ∗ =
√
2φ(K − ĥ)
φπ
. (22)
The manager’s expected payoff when he implements the
blockchain project by investing cash holdings ht and raising
external funds (K − ht ) is
Ȳ (ht ) = (1− γ ∗)π̂ (β)− ψ(M∗)− ht , (23)
where M∗ and γ ∗ are presented in (21) and (22).
Similar with the simple model, the cash holdings threshold
ĥ∗ and the level of transparency φ∗ are determined by
max
φ,ĥ
(
h
ĥ
)δh
Ȳ (ĥ). (24)
Proposition 5: The optimal levels of cash holdings ĥ∗ and
transparency φ∗ increase in the managerial overconfidence,
that is, ∂ ĥ∗/∂β > 0 and ∂φ∗/∂β > 0.
V. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
A. DATA
We obtained Chinese listed firms’ data from the Chinese
Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS) database from
2010 to 2019. We exclude the sample by the following
criteria:
1. Firms in the financial industry;
2. Firms under delisting procedures (ST/ST* firm);
3. Firms with missing values.
Also, all continuous variables are winsorized at the 1% and
99% levels of their distributions.
B. VARIABLES AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
The dependent variable, cash holdings (denoted as cash),
is computed as the ratio of cash and equivalents to
assets [32], [33].
Our proxy for managerial overconfidence (denoted as oc)
is constructed based on the change in managerial sharehold-
ing. The measure of managerial overconfidence equals one
if management increases the shareholdings and excesses the
75th percentile; otherwise, themeasure equals zero. Themea-
sure of agency costs (denoted as ac) is calculated as the ratio
of managerial costs to operating profits.
We derive the control variables at the firm level from the
previous literature on the determinants of cash holdings [3],
[32]. The firm-level control variables are shown as follows.
The financing constraints index (fc) is calculated as the abso-
lute value of the SA index, and the larger it is, the stronger
the degree of financing constraint a firm faces. The market to
book ratio (m2b) is computed as the total book value of assets
less the book value of equity plus the market value of equity
VOLUME 9, 2021 141459

divided by total assets. The capital expenditures (capex) are
denoted as the cash paid to acquire fixed assets, intangible
assets, and other long-term assets divided by assets. The
liabilities ratio (tl) is calculated as the total liabilities divided
by total assets. The cash flow (cflow) is computed as the
net cash flows generated from operating activities divided
by assets. The size (size) is calculated as the logarithm of
the assets. The net-working capital (netwc) is denoted as
the working capital less cash and cash equivalents divided
by assets. salegr denotes the growth rate of the operating
revenue. div stands for the dummy, which equals one when
the firm pays dividends.
We also control some corporate government variables.
topone measures the share proportion of the largest share-
holder. hhi presents the Herfindahl index of the share propor-
tion of the largest five shareholders, and a larger hhi indicates
a higher concentration of equity.MShrRat gives the manage-
ment shareholding ratio. InDrcRat shows the percentage of
independent directors on the board. gpay is calculated as the
natural logarithm of the total compensation of the top three
executives.
TABLE 1. Descriptive statistics.
Table 1 depicts the descriptive statistics. The mean and
median levels of cash holdings are 16.1% and 13.3% of the
total assets, respectively. The standard deviation is 0.111,
which indicates a substantial variation in the level of cash
holdings over firms.
Figure 2 consists of three groups of box plots, each repre-
senting the distribution of cash holdings across rational and
overconfident firms. The left and right adjacent lines denote
each box plot’s 10th and 90th percentile, and the left and right
hinges indicate the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively. The
median of each group is depicted in the middle of each box.
The horizontal coordinates in Figure 2 are arranged based
on the descriptive statistical characteristics of cash holdings
(cash) in the whole sample.
In Figure 2, we can observe that the right whiskers of all
box plots are longer than the left ones, suggesting that all
the groups’ distributions are right-skewed. The box of the
FIGURE 2. Distribution of cash holdings across rational and
overconfident groups.
overconfident group is more to the right than its counterpart
of the rational group. The result suggests that cash holdings
are higher in the overconfident group than in the rational
group.
When focusing on the intra-group distributions among the
blockchain-involved and the blockchain-uninvolved groups,
we find that the overconfident boxes are more to the right than
the rational boxes in Figure 2. This result can be interpreted
as the overconfident sample has an overall higher level of
cash holdings than the rational, regardless of whether they
are involved in blockchain projects. Figure 2 also shows that
the overconfident blockchain-involved firms have more cash
holdings than their overconfident blockchain-uninvolved
counterparts. When we focus on the extra-group differences
of rational firms, we can find similar results. The extra-group
results in Figure 2 reflect, to the descriptive extent, the ten-
dency of firms involved in blockchain projects to keep a
higher level of cash holdings.
C. REGRESSION MODELS
We augment the model suggested by Opler et al. [32] with the
proxy for managerial overconfidence as the baseline model.
Specifically, we estimate the following specification:
cashi,t = a0 + a1 · oci,t−1 + a2 · aci,t−1
+0′ · control i,t−1 + εi,t (25)
where the dependent variable is cashi,t , the ratio of cash and
cash equivalents to net assets of firm i at the end of year t .
oci,t−1, the independent variable of interest, reflects whether
the manager of firm i is overconfident at the end of year t−1.
In equation (25), a1 reports the effect of managerial over-
confidence on cash holdings. A significantly positive a1 sug-
gests that firms raise cash holdings when their managers are
overconfident. Similarly, a2 represents the effect of agency
costs on cash holdings. A significantly negative a2 indicates
that firms decrease cash holdings when agency costs are high.
Significance levels for estimated coefficients of equation (25)
are adjusted to reflect robust standard errors with clustering
at the firm level.

T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
TABLE 2. Regression results.
In Table 2, we estimate three specifications of the baseline
equation for two kinds of dependent variables, i.e., cash and
lncash, to accommodate the unobserved fixed effects. The
first three columns report the results where the dependent
variable is cash. Columns (1) to (3) show that the coefficients
a1 and a2 are significantly positive and negative, respectively.
The dependent variables in columns (4) to (6) are lncash.
The results are not substantially different from the first three
columns. Therefore, the firm holds more cash when the man-
ager is overconfident or has fewer agency costs. These results
are consistent with Propositions 3 and 5.
We also estimate the incremental impacts of participation
in blockchain projects on cash holdings in the last three
columns of Table 2. The variable bkc equals one when
the firm announces its involvement in blockchain-related
projects; otherwise, bkc equals zero. The variable ocbkc
denotes the interaction between managerial overconfidence
(oc) and blockchain involvement (bkc). Columns (6) to (8)
show that blockchain involvement makes the firm hold more

cash. The interaction between managerial overconfidence
and blockchain involvement has a positive but insignificant
impact on cash holdings.
VOLUME 9, 2021 141461
T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
We standardize the continuous variables in the regres-
sion models in terms of year-fixed effects and industry-fixed
effects to investigate the discrepancies in the degree of influ-
ence of each variable on cash holdings. By standardization,
we can transform each continuous variable into a variable
with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The
standardization allows the coefficients to represent the degree
of their influence on the cash holdings. If the indepen-
dent variable is continuous, the magnitude of its regression
coefficient indicates the extent to which one standard devia-
tion of its change affects cash holdings. If the independent
variable is a dummy, the value of its coefficient suggests
the magnitude of the effect of category difference on cash
holdings.
The estimated coefficients with 95% confidence intervals
for the regression analyses are reported in Figure 3. Themark-
ers represent the estimated coefficients while the ranges show
their 95% confidence intervals, and the capped spikes exhibit
the corresponding upper and lower limits. In Figure 3, each
variable matches two ranges: the upper blue range results
from the regression model accounting for year-fixed effects,
while the lower red range considers industry-fixed effects.
The dashed line in the middle of Figure 3 represents that a
variable has no impact on cash holdings. The left and right
sides of the dashed line denote negative and positive effects,
respectively. The farther the estimated coefficient is from the
dashed line, the more significant the impact of the variable on
cash holdings. Suppose a range with capped spikes does not
intersect with the dashed line. In that case, non-intersection
can regard that the effect of the independent variable on cash
holdings is statistically significant at the 95% level.
We can observe from Figure 3 a positive and negative
relationship between managerial overconfidence and agency
costs with cash holdings, respectively. Take the results con-
sidering year-fixed effects as an example. The coefficient of
managerial overconfidence (oc) is 0.1143, which means that
cash holdings in a corporate with managerial overconfidence
are 11.43 percentage points of a standard deviation higher
than its peer with managerial non-overconfidence, ceteris
paribus. The coefficient of agency costs (ac) is -0.0449, which
suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase in agency
costs is associated with a decrease of 4.49 percentage points
of a standard deviation in cash holdings with other conditions
unchanged. Similarly, the model’s coefficients of manage-
rial overconfidence (oc) and agency costs (ac) are 0.1017
and -0.0547, considering the industry-fixed effects.
To clearly illustrate the effects of the variables of interest
on cash holdings, we suppress the results of other variables
in Figure 4. There are three subfigures in Figure 4. The left
subfigure depicts the effect of the variables of interest (bkc,
oc, and ac) on cash holdings, and the remainder investigates
the marginal impact on cash holdings by heterogeneity in
blockchain involvement.
The left subfigure depicts the impacts of blockchain
involvement (bkc), managerial overconfidence (oc), and
agency costs (ac) on cash holdings. All three ranges with
FIGURE 4. Effects of the variables of interest on cash holdings.
spikes in the left subfigure do not cross the no-effect line,
which indicates that the effects of the three variables of
interest on cash holdings are statistically significant at the
95% level. Specifically, the coefficient of involvement in a
blockchain project (bkc) is 0.2292, which means that if a
firm is involved in a blockchain project, it increases cash
holdings by 22.92 percentage points of a standard devia-
tion. The coefficient of managerial overconfidence (oc) is
0.1317, which suggests that cash holdings in a corporate
with managerial overconfidence is 13.17 percentage points
of a standard deviation higher than its counterpart with man-
agerial non-overconfidence. The coefficient of agency costs
(ac) is -0.0758, which suggests that a one-standard-deviation
increase in agency costs is associated with a decrease
of 7.58 percentage points of a standard deviation in cash
holdings.
The middle and right subfigures in Figure 4 show the
marginal effects on cash holdings considering the hetero-
geneity in blockchain involvement. Both subfigures show
that the ranges with spikes for managerial overconfidence
(oc) are above the no-effect line. It means that manage-
rial overconfidence within a firm (oc) has a significant
positive effect on cash holdings, regardless of whether it
is involved in a blockchain project. The coefficients of
managerial overconfidence (oc) in the blockchain-uninvolved
and blockchain-involved samples are 0.1162 and 0.2715,
respectively. It means that cash holdings are 11.62 percentage
points of a standard deviation higher in firms with managerial
overconfidence than their non-overconfident peers when they
are not involved in blockchain projects; this compares to
27.15 percentage points of a standard deviation when they
involve in blockchain projects.
As for the effect of agency costs on cash holdings,
the results of the middle and right subfigures do not pre-
cisely match. The range with spikes for agency costs (ac)
in the middle subfigure is below the no-effect line, but
its counterpart in the right figure has a crossover with
the no-effect line. The results indicate that the effect of
agency costs on cash holdings is significantly negative
in the blockchain-uninvolved sample; however, it is nega-
tive but not significant in the blockchain-involved sample.
141462 VOLUME 9, 2021
T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
The coefficients of agency costs (ac) in the blockchain-
uninvolved and blockchain-involved samples are−0.0819 and
−0.0187, respectively. It indicates that an increment of
one standard deviation in agency costs (ac) results in
8.19 percentage points of a standard deviation decrease in
cash holdings when the firms are not involved in blockchain
projects; this comes out to 1.87 percentage points among the
blockchain-involved firms. We also use seemingly unrelated
estimation to test the blockchain-involvement heterogeneity
in themarginal effects on cash holdings. The results show that
the difference in the marginal effect of managerial overcon-
fidence (oc) on cash holdings is not significant (p-value =
0.18). Still, the difference in the marginal effect of agency
costs (ac) is significant (p-value = 0.06).
VI. CONCLUSION
The impacts of managerial overconfidence and agency costs
on corporate financial decisions have recently received a
tremendous amount of attention. This study contributes to the
literature by investigating the relationship between manage-
rial overconfidence, agency costs and cash holdings, and the
theoretical mechanism thereof. We build the cash holdings
model based on the real-option game theory considering
managerial overconfidence and agency costs. Our model’s
equilibrium suggests that cash holdings increase with man-
agerial overconfidence and decrease with agency costs.
Using Chinese listed firm data from 2010 to 2019, we find
that the regression results provide empirical evidence for
the theoretical predictions. There is a significant positive
relationship between managerial overconfidence and cash
holdings; however, there is a significant negative relationship
between agency costs and cash holdings. When we focus on
firms that disclose their participation in blockchain projects in
their announcements, the above relationships persist. More-
over, the level of cash holdings of the blockchain-involving
firms is significantly higher than their peers.
Our findings shed light on the impacts of behavioral
characteristics on cash holdings. Since the seminal study
of Opler et al. [32], there have been extensive discussions
on the determinants of cash holdings. The perspectives
have expanded from firm characteristics to behavioral ones.
We complement the literature by showing that managerial
overconfidence, one of the most critical behavioral charac-
teristics among managers, affects cash holdings due to the
overconfident cognitive bias.

optimal level of cash savings based on the first-order con-
dition of (6) with respect to α:

The second-order condition is

Combining the first and second order conditions, we can
obtain that the optimal saving fraction α∗ is as follows:

Hence, the manager determines his quantity according to

Solving the first-order condition, we can derive the unbi-
ased manager’s optimal quantity q∗ = F−1X (ζ ), where ζ =
(p− v)/p.
VOLUME 9, 2021 141463
T. Niu, X. Zhao: Impacts of Managerial Overconfidence and Agency Costs on Cash Holdings Within Blockchain Firms
In the overconfident scenario, themanager regards the PDF
of X as fD(·), rather than fX (·) and believes the expected return
of the blockchain project is
π = p

Therefore, his optimal quantity is q̂(β) = F−1D (ζ ), which
can be re-expressed as q̂(β) = βE[X ]+ (1−β)q∗. However,
the expected return of the blockchain project in the over-
confident scenario is still governed by the real CDF of X;
i.e., FX (·). Hence, the corresponding profits of the blockchain
project are π̂ (β) = pE[X∧q̂(β)]−vq̂(β). Then, we can derive
∂π̂
∂β
=
(
pF̄X (βE[X ]+ (1− β))− v
)
(E[X ]− q∗), (A.11)
where F̄X (·) = 1− FX (·).
If q∗ > E[X ], then βE[X ]+ (1− β)q∗ < q∗. As F̄X (·) is a
decreasing function, we can obtain pF̄X (βE[X ]+ (1− β))−
v > 0. That is, ∂π̂
∂β
< 0. If q∗ < E[X ], ∂π̂
∂β
< 0 still holds.
Therefore, π̂ (β) is decreasing in β. �

Proof of Proposition 3: Given η = θ

holdings can be expressed as ĥ = δh
δh−1

.
The expression ĥ intuitively shows that the level of cash
holdings ĥ is negatively related to project returns π̂ , i.e., ∂ ĥ
∂π̂
<
0. According to Proposition 2, project returns π̂ is positively
associated with managerial overconfidence β, i.e., ∂π̂

Therefore, ∂ ĥ

We then turn our attention to the relationship between the

Proposition 4 can be proved.
Proof of Proposition 5: GivenM∗ and γ ∗ from (21) and
(22), the manager’s expected payoff in (13) can be re-written
as
U =

Ȳ (ĥ). (A.14)
Then, we can derive the optimal level of cash holdings ĥ
and transparency φ̂.

The manager determines the optimal level of transparency
φ̂ according to the first order condition of (A.14) with respect
to φ:
Uφ =
(
h
ĥ
)δ √K − ĥ
2φ3
− λ(K − ĥ)
 = 0. (A.15)
The second order condition is
Uφφ =
(
h
ĥ
)δ −3
2
√
K − ĥ
2φ5
 < 0. (A.16)
Therefore, given the level of cash holdings ĥ, the manager
determines the optimal level of transparency as
φ =
(
2λ2(K − ĥ)
)− 1
3
. (A.17)
The cross-partial is as follows:
U
φĥ|φ=φ∗ =
(
h
ĥ
)δ λ− 1
2φ
√
2φ
(
K − ĥ
)
 > 0.(A.18)
Similarly, the optimal level of cash holdings ĥ is deter-
mined by the first order condition of (A.14) with respect to ĥ:
Uĥ = −
δ
ĥ
U +
(
h
ĥ
)δ  1√
2φ(K − ĥ)
+ φλ− 1
 = 0.
(A.19)
(A.15) and (A.19) are the necessary conditions for the opti-
mal level of cash holdings and transparency. The sufficient
condition is that Uφφ < 0, Uĥĥ < 0, and
H ≡
∣∣∣∣∣ Uĥĥ U
φĥ
Uĥφ Uφφ
∣∣∣∣∣ = UĥĥUφφ − UφĥUĥφ > 0 (A.20)
As mentioned before, Uφφ < 0 holds by (A.16) while the
signs of Uĥĥ and H cannot be determined in general. How-
ever, there are widely parameter ranges where the sufficient
conditions are satisfied. That is, the interior solutions for ĥ
and φ exists.
Furthermore, within the parameter ranges, we can derive
dĥ∗
dπ̂
=
U
φĥUφπ̂ − UφφUĥπ̂
H
, (A.21)
dφ̂∗
dπ̂
=
U
φĥUĥπ̂ − UĥĥUφπ̂
H
. (A.22)
As mentioned, we focus on the parameter ranges where the
interior solution of ĥ and φ exists; that is, Uφφ < 0, Uĥĥ <
0, and H > 0. According to (A.18), U
φĥ > 0 at ĥ and φ∗.
In addition,
Uφπ̂ = 0, (A.23)
Uĥπ̂ = −
δ
ĥ
(
h
ĥ
)δ
< 0. (A.24)
Algorithm 5 Algorithm for Proposition 5
Input: M∗ =
√
2φ(K − ĥ), γ ∗ =
√
2φ(K−ĥ)
φπ
.
1: Ȳ (ht )← (1− γ ∗)π̂ (β)− ψ(M∗)− ht ;
2: U ←
(
h

Ȳ (ĥ)
3: compute φ∗; where Uφ |φ=φ∗ = 0;
4: compute ĥ∗; where Uĥ|ĥ=ĥ∗ = 0;
5: H ← UĥĥUφφ − UφĥUĥφ ;
6: Uφπ̂ ← 0;
7: Uĥπ̂ ←−
δ
ĥ
(
h

)δ
< 0;
8: if Uĥĥ < 0, Uφφ < 0, and H > 0 then
9: dĥ∗
dπ̂ ←
U
φĥUφπ̂−UφφUĥπ̂
H ;
10:
dφ̂∗
dπ̂ ←
U
φĥUĥπ̂−UĥĥUφπ̂
H ;
11: end if
12: ∂ ĥ∗
∂β

dĥ∗
dπ̂
∂π̂
∂β
; where ∂π̂
∂β
< 0;
13:
∂φ∗
∂β
←
dφ̂∗
dπ̂
∂π̂
∂β
; where ∂π̂
∂β
< 0;
14: ∂ ĥ∗/∂β > 0, and ∂φ∗/∂β > 0;
Proposition 5 can be proved.
Therefore, we can derive that both (A.21) and (A.22)
are negative. That is, the optimal level of cash holdings ĥ
and transparency φ decrease in π̂ . Moreover, according to
Proposition 2, π̂ (β) decreases in β. Hence, the optimal levels
of cash holdings and transparency increase in β. �
