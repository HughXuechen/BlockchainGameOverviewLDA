Abstract—With the widespread application of blockchain 
technology in social and economic fields, various security 
challenges have become increasingly prominent and attracted 
many researchers to work in this domain. To address this issue, 
we propose a blockchain system security evaluation model based 
on game theory combination weighting and grey clustering. 
Considering the correlation between indexes, the security 
evaluation index system is constructed hierarchically from the 
technical system framework of blockchain. Then we use the 
combination weighting algorithm based on game theory to 
optimize the ratio of subjective and objective weights, and 
balance the evaluation error caused by the difference between 
subjective and objective weights to make the weight 
quantification more scientific and accurate. Finally, the security 
evaluation level of the blockchain system is determined by grey 
clustering evaluation method. The effectiveness of this method is 
verified by our experiments, which provides a useful reference 
for the security evaluation of blockchain systems.  
Keywords—blockchain, combination weighting, grey clustering, 
security evaluation 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Blockchain is a distributed ledger with the characteristics of 
decentralization, tamper-proof, traceability, openness and 
transparency. Common blockchain systems include Bitcoin[1], 
Ethereum [2], and Hyperledger [3], which is essentially a 
decentralized database [4]. Blockchain can provide secure 
electronic transaction services and trusted peer-to-peer value 
transmission without relying on third-party trusted institutions. 
As a brand-new data storage, management and transmission 
technology, blockchain becomes a national strategic 
technology. However, with the rapid development of 
blockchain technology, the security risks faced by the 
blockchain are becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, the 
security evaluation of blockchain systems has become the 
study focus at home and abroad. 
Blockchain-based information systems face similar security 
risks to other information systems at the user layer, interface 
layer, and core infrastructure layer. Zhu Yan et al. [5] 
summarized and analyzed the core technologies of the 
blockchain system from the control point of the third-level 
security level 2.0, but did not give the overall security 
evaluation results of the blockchain system. Ye Congcong et al. 
[6] proposed a model for security detection based on the 
structure of the blockchain to solve the problem of incomplete 
analysis of a single attack using mathematical methods. Qin 
Chaoxia et al. [7] proposed a new security risk assessment 
model from two aspects of technical architecture and 
computing power, but the analytical hierarchy process(AHP) 
method chosen by them relies too much on the opinions of 
experts, and the assignment of the weight of security risk 
factors is not accurate enough. Song Yingchun et al. [8] 
proposed a method to dynamically measure and evaluate 
blockchain security risks based on the blockchain maturity 
model. 
According to the literatures, most of the existing blockchain 
security evaluation methods have simple evaluation processes 
and lack a complete and comprehensive evaluation model 
framework. In addition, there are many existing security 
standards, but when implemented into the index system of 
actual security assessment, there are many indexes such as 
blockchain function and performance, and less attention is paid 
to the security of data information. Moreover, the selected 
evaluation method is relatively subjective in the determination 
of index weights, and is mostly completed by expert evaluation,

which lacks index correlation analysis. Therefore, this paper 
further improves the security evaluation index system of the 
blockchain system from the perspective of the core technical 
framework of the blockchain system and the correlation 
analysis of indexes. By improving the traditional weighting 
method, the combination weighting algorithm based on game 
theory is introduced, and then a security evaluation model 
based on combination weighting and grey clustering is 
proposed. 
II. SECURITY EVALUATION MODEL OF BLOCKCHAIN 
SYSTEM BASED ON COMBINATION WEIGHTING AND GREY 
CLUSTERING 
In view of the lack of a unified security evaluation model 
for the blockchain system, this paper proposes a security 
evaluation model for the blockchain system based on the 
combination weighting and grey clustering, as shown in Fig. 1, 
according to the national standard(GB) information security 
evaluation criteria and classified protection of information 
security level 3 [9] (referred to as level 3 equal protection) 
standard, and on the basis of considering the mutual influence 
between the evaluations. The evaluation model combines the 
technical system framework of the blockchain to construct the 
security evaluation index system of the blockchain system. The 
combination weighting method based on game theory is used 
to optimize the ratio of subjective and objective weights, and 
the security level of the blockchain system is obtained through 
grey clustering evaluation. The evaluation model expounds the 
evaluation process and key considerations of the blockchain 
system, and provides support for the construction of the 
security enhancement strategy of the blockchain system. 
A. Indicator system based on blockchain framework  
In this paper, referring to the GB information security 
assessment criteria and the control points of the three-level 
standard for equal protection, on the basis of considering the 
blockchain framework, the security assessment index system is 
constructed hierarchically. The indexes obtained based on the 
blockchain framework have different impacts on the security 
evaluation of the entire system, and there is a certain 
correlation between the evaluation indexes. Therefore, by 
constructing the index system for correlation analysis between 
them, the security of the system can be more comprehensively 
and accurately reflected to ensure the scientific validity of 
system security evaluations. 
Currently, mainstream blockchain systems include Bitcoin, 
Ethereum, and Hyperledger. The different characteristics of 
these blockchain systems bring new challenges to the security 
evaluation of blockchain systems. However, no matter what 
kind of blockchain system, according to the system framework 
of the blockchain, it can be divided into network layer, 
consensus layer, transaction layer, contract layer and 
application layer, as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Fig. 2.  Blockchain framework 
On the basis of the analysis of the blockchain system 
framework, combined with the GB information security 
evaluation criteria and level 3 equal protection standard, the 
blockchain information security evaluation index is divided 
into five first-level indexes, namely, peer-to-peer network 
security, consensus mechanism security, distributed ledger 
security, smart contract security, application expansions and 
environments security. After expansion, integration, screening 
and elimination of redundancy, a total of 22 second-level 
indexes are obtained, as shown in Table 1. The following is an

explanation of the indicators at each level, and provides the 
basis for the subsequent index scores. 
TABLE I.  BLOCKCHAIN INFORMATION SECURITY EVALUATION INDEX 
SYSTEM 
1)  Peer-to-Peer network security: A distributed peer-to-
peer network is a computer network that contains only nodes 
with equivalent control and operational capabilities. In order 
to evaluate the access, transmission and network security 
status of consensus nodes and network nodes in the 
blockchain, distributed peer-to-peer network security mainly 
evaluates the blockchain P2P network from control points 
such as software fault tolerance, identity authentication, and 
security audit. Specific secondary indexes include self-
protection and adaptive capabilities, node access control, 
network status update, and network node dynamic detection. 
2) Consensus mechanism security: The consensus 
mechanism [10] is a way to ensure that the member nodes of 
the blockchain system reach a consensus on a series of ordered 
transaction sequences. Since the blockchain is characterized 
by decentralization, there is no centralized accounting node to 
ensure that the records of transactions on all nodes are 
consistent. The role of the consensus mechanism is to achieve 
data consistency and operational synchronization between 
nodes in the blockchain. The security of the consensus 
mechanism mainly evaluates the security of the consensus 
layer of the blockchain from control points such as resource 
control, data backup and recovery, and consensus effect. 
Specific secondary indexes include consensus resource control, 
data backup, system hot redundancy, consensus fault tolerance, 
consensus mechanism choice, number and location of nodes. 
3) Distributed ledger security: Distributed ledger [11] is a 
distributed data storage structure that is serialized, 
synchronously shared, and tamper-proof among each node 
member. It can provide storage and query services for various 
data generated during the operation of the blockchain system. 
This paper selects six secondary indexes from the aspects of 
access control, data confidentiality, data integrity and other 
control points, key management, and privacy protection. 
Specific secondary indexes include ledger access control, key 
management, data confidentiality, data integrity, data 
availability, identity and transaction privacy protection. 
4) Smart contract security: A smart contract is a computer 
program or script that runs on the blockchain and is a carrier 
for implementing business logic. As the carrier of data, the 
blockchain stores the key information of a series of 
transactions, and smart contracts are the rules of operating 
these data in the blockchain. The security assessment for the 
smart contract layer should start from the control points such 
as identity authentication, malicious code prevention, and 
security audit, and analyze it item by item. Specific secondary 
indexes include execution of identity verification, malicious 
code attack, behavior event audit, and audit records. 
5) Application expansions and environmentals security: 
The distributed ledger will continue to expand with the 
changes of the nodes of the blockchain, so it is necessary to 
continuously expand the storage capacity, and the 
environment in which the blockchain application is located is 
also an evaluation index that needs to be paid attention to. For 
the scalability and environmental security of the application, 
two secondary indexes, such as storage capacity and physical 
environmental security, are selected.

The quantitative evaluation algorithm is mainly composed 
of game theory combination weighting and grey clustering 
evaluation, as shown in Fig. 3. Considering that a single 
subjective and objective weight confirmation method is not 
accurate enough, this paper uses the method of game theory to 
combine the subjective and objective weights obtained by the 
two weight determination algorithms, and then obtains the 
security evaluation results of the blockchain system through 
the grey clustering evaluation. Finally, it analyzes the results 
combined with the opinions of experts, and provides good 
information security improvement feedback to the target 
system to improve the information security level of the system. 
A. Calculation of subjective weights based on sorting-based 
weighting algorithm 
The ranking-based weight confirmation algorithm uses the 
idea of PageRank [12] to combine the basic principle of 
Markov chain and the correlation between indexes, and 
determines the weight of indexes according to the collective 
evaluation results of experts. Using this algorithm to determine 
the weight of indexes not only considers the correlation 
between indexes, but also integrates the evaluation results of 
experts [13]. 
The improved ranking-based weight determination 
algorithm based on the idea of PageRank is based on the 
following assumption: if a node receives a larger weight from 
other pointing chains, then this node is more important. At the 
same time, the quality of the inbound nodes pointing to the 
node is different, and the node with high quality will transfer 
more weights to other nodes through the link, so the node with 
higher quality points to node A, the more important node A is. 
The formula for calculating the PR value of each node is:  
  
(1) 
 
Where,  is the set of all nodes that have out-chains for 
pi node,  is the number of out-chains of nodes, and N is the 
total number of nodes,  is the probability the user randomly 
reaches a node, generally taken as 0.85. The PR value can be 
calculated according to equation (1). When the iteration tends 
to be stable, the result can be obtained. 
B. Calculation of objective weight based on CRITIC method 
The objective weight of each index of the CRITIC method 
is calculated by the amount of information contained in the 
index data. The amount of information is represented by the 
contrast strength and correlation between indexes [14]. The 
contrast strength usually takes the standard deviation of the 
data. Considering the influence of the mean on the contrast 
strength, this paper takes the coefficient of variation as the 
contrast strength. The CRITIC method is suitable for data that 
has a certain correlation between the analyzed index factors. 
As an improvement of the entropy weight method, it fully 
shows the difference and conflict between the indexes, and has 
strong practicability. The algorithm steps are as follows: 
Suppose there are m evaluation objects, and n evaluation 
indexes form the original evaluation matrix , 
where  represents the value of the j-th indexes of the i-th 
object. 
Standardize the indicators in the evaluation matrix X:

where  is the coefficient of variation of the j-th index. 
Use the standardized matrix  to extract the correlation 
coefficient, and get the correlation coefficient matrix:

The quantification coefficient of the degree of 
independence of each indicator: 
 (7) 
The comprehensive coefficient of each evaluation index: 
 (8) 
Objective weight of each indicator: 
  
(8) 
C. Combination Weights Based on Game Theory 
The combination weighting method based on game theory 
takes the Nash equilibrium as the coordination goal to find the 
balance between different weights in the conflict between the 
weights obtained by the subjective and objective weighting 
methods, which is an integrated process of mutual comparison 
and coordination. This method can take into account the 
subjective and objective weights, comprehensively consider the 
inherent information between each index, reduce the 
randomness of weight determination, and improve the 
scientific rationality of index weighting. The combination 
weighting steps are as follows [15]: 
The weight of each index is determined by the ranking-
based confirmation weight method and the CRITIC method 
respectively. The basic weight vector set is

, , where  is the number of 
methods to determine the weight, this paper takes ，n is 
the number of evaluation index. The linear combination weight 
coefficient is . Then the combined 
weight  is: 
 (10) 
In (10): when  is the optimal combination coefficient, 
 is the optimal combination weight. 
Therefore, the above analysis transforms the problem of 
finding the optimal combination weight into the problem of 
finding the optimal linear combination weight coefficient. In 
order to obtain the optimal weight , according to the idea of 
game theory, with the minimum deviation between  and  
as the goal, the above linear combination weight coefficient is 
optimized, and the obtained objective function is: 
 (11) 
According to the properties of matrix differentiation, the 
optimal first-order derivative condition of (11) is: 
 (12) 
The  obtained by the above formula is normalized to 
obtain , and the calculation formula is as follows: 
 
(13) 
The combination weights based on game theory are: 
 (14) 
D. Grey Clustering Evaluation Based on Game Theory 
Combination Weighting 
The security situation of the blockchain system is caused by 
the interaction of various related factors, which makes the 
security evaluation of the blockchain system have multi-factor 
and incomplete characteristics. In order to solve these problems 
with "grey" (partial information is clear, and some information 
is not clear), this paper introduces the grey clustering 
evaluation method. 
Grey clustering evaluation is a method of dividing the 
evaluation objects into several predefined categories according 
to the whitening weight function in the grey system [16]. The 
steps of grey clustering evaluation based on the combination 
weighting method are as follows: 
1) Determine grey: The security status of the blockchain 
system can be quantitatively represented by the grey-level 
classification method. According to the type and requirements 
of the evaluation results, five grey classifications are set: 
"lower", "low", "medium", "high", "higher", and represented 
by k values of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
2) Building a whitening weight function: The whitening 
weight function is usually determined according to the turning 
point of the index, and the specific value of the turning point 
is generally given by domain experts. See Table 2 for the 
determination of the grey turning point of the blockchain 
system evaluation index.

function expressions of the five grey classifications of "lower",

evaluation indexes, which are:

to more conveniently evaluate the security status of the 
blockchain system, the evaluation results are divided into 5 
levels, namely "higher security", "high security", "medium

IV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS 
In this section, a total of 6 groups of target system samples 
are investigated, and the items involved in the index system 
were scored by experts in the survey, and the data are obtained  
through statistical calculation. Among them, systems 1-4 are 
conventional samples selected in combination with expert 
evaluation, and systems 5 and 6 are excellent simulation 
samples. Considering the number of indexes in Table 1, we 
take the quantitative evaluation of peer-to-peer network 
security u1 and consensus mechanism security u2 in the primary 
indexes as the demonstration of the overall security evaluation 
of the blockchain system. When the subjective weight is 
determined, 10 experts are selected to score the mutual 
influence between indicators. The scoring of experts on the 
relationship between indexes is shown in Table 4: 
TABLE IV.  EXPERTS' SCORING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDEXES

u11 0 3 5 5 4 5 1 2 3 10 
u12 1 0 3 3 5 1 1 1 1 3 
u13 3 1 0 7 5 5 1 1 3 8 
u14 3 3 8 0 5 3 4 1 3 10

u25 5 7 8 8 10 10 9 10 0 10 
u26 8 7 9 9 6 10 8 5 10 0 
Firstly, the adjacency matrix Q is constructed according to 
the scoring of experts in Table 4. The value of row i-th and 
column j-th in the adjacency matrix represents the number of 
experts who believe that the i-th index will affect the j-th index. 
If Q32 is 1, it means that one expert thinks that index u13 has an 
impact on u12. The adjacency matrix Q is shown below. 
 
The column vectors of the adjacency matrix Q are 
normalized, and the probability transition matrix S is obtained 
as follows. 
 
Bringing the probability transfer matrix S obtained above 
into (22), we can get the final transfer matrix G. 
 (22) 
Where,  is a random probability, which is generally 0.85. 
N is the number of index nodes, which is 10. U is a matrix with 
all values of 1. 
 (23) 
Bring the final transfer matrix into (23), after continuous 
iteration, we can calculate the vector  composed of Pn as 
shown below. 
 
The objective weight is determined by using the 
standardized data. The final summary of the standardized 
sample data is shown in Table 5.

The objective weight is calculated by the Critic method as 
 
The basic weight vector set is brought into the formula of 
the combination weighting method based on game theory, and 
the obtained combination weight is shown in Table 6.

The whitening weight function value is calculated 
according to the sample data in Table 5, and the grey clustering 
coefficients of each index with respect to different grey 
classifications was obtained by using the combination weights 
in Table 6. The grey clustering coefficients reflect the 
membership degrees of each system at different security levels, 
which is shown in Table 7.

The comprehensive scores and rankings of the six system 
samples are calculated by using the sample data and 
combination weights, which is shown in Table 8.

system 1 7.3773 medium 6 
system 2 7.6213 medium 4 
system 3 7.7307 medium 3 
system 4 7.5080 medium 5 
system 5 8.4845 high 2 
system 6 8.6068 high 1 
Finally, the comprehensive scores of six system samples 
are calculated = {7.3773, 7.6213, 7.7307, 7.5080, 8.4845, 
8.6068}. As shown in Figure 4, the corresponding security 
levels of the six systems are: {medium, medium, medium, 
medium, high, high}, the performance of systems 5 and 6 is 
good, the security level is high, and the security level of 
systems 1 to 4 is medium, which is in line with the expected 
results of the experiment.

In order to analyze the impact of different weighting 
methods on the evaluation results, the index weights obtained 
by each weighting method are compared in Figure 5. From the 
weight results of the combination weighting method based on 
game theory, the combination weight is generally close to the 
average value of the two weight results. Considering the 
characteristics of the combination weighting method, it is 
believed that the combination weighting method based on 
game theory takes both subjectivity and objectivity into 
account. The results are more reasonable than the results of the 
PageRank method and the Critic method. At the same time, it 
can also be observed that self-protection and self-adaptation 
and the number and location indicators of nodes account for a 
large proportion of the total weight, which is one of the 
important factors affecting the evaluation score of peer-to-peer 
network security and consensus mechanism security. The 
security level of each index will quickly and effectively 
improve the overall security level of the system.

V. CONCLUSION 
Aiming at the lack of a unified security evaluation model 
for the existing blockchain evaluation methods, we propose a 
blockchain system security evaluation model based on the 
combination weighting and grep clustering. The model uses a 
combination weighting method combining subjective and 
objective, which balances the evaluation error caused by a 
single weighting method. Considering the correlation between 
indexes, we put forward the security evaluation index system 
for blockchain system based on the core framework of 
blockchain. Finally, the grey clustering evaluation is used to 
determine the security evaluation level of the blockchain 
system. Through example verification, it is proved that the 
model has good usability, which provides useful model support 
for the security evaluation of the blockchain system.
