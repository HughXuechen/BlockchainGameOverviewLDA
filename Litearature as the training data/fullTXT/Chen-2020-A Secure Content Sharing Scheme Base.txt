Abstract—Vehicular named data networking (VNDN) has
recently emerged as a novel paradigm to facilitate content-
centric data sharing for Internet of Vehicles. However, an
information holder can spread fake data to clients for ma-
licious purposes, which may affect the driving decision of
the recipient, or even worse, cause traffic congestion and
accidents. In this article, we build a data-sharing system
that consists of a double-layer blockchain. The nodes at
the bottom layer request for service by announcing their
requirements in the NDN paradigm. For the upper layer, the
nodes submit their demands and supplies to the nearest
roadside unit for further matching. We model the balance
between the demand and supply as a matching game. To
encourage nodes to provide positive services, a reputation
management mechanism that combines negative and pos-
itive transaction records is proposed. Simulation results
verify the validity of our system, and the data-sharing mech-
anism fosters a secure information interaction in the VNDN.
Index Terms—Blockchain, data sharing, matching theory,

I. INTRODUCTION
INTERNET of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a key ar-
chitecture that promises to enhance traffic experience with
various safety-related (traffic accident, sudden braking, etc.) and
nonsafety-related (commercial, entertainment, etc.) applications
to a reality. Vehicles in IoV always rely on unique IDs (primarily

the IP addresses), regardless of the type of applications, to
position termini and to establish end-to-end communications [1].
Due to the very properties of IoV, such as distributed operation,
limited bandwidth, node mobility, and dynamic network topol-
ogy, a persistent and robust connection is difficult to maintain [2],
[3]. Furthermore, as the number of electronic devices continues
to grow, it becomes increasingly tough to assign an IP address
for every device, especially to devices with high mobility. In-
terestingly, communications among vehicles concentrate more
on content, instead of their actual carriers, giving rise to named
data networking (NDN) application in IoV [vehicular named
data networking (VNDN)] [4]. Fig. 1 shows a request-driven
communication model that is officially adopted in the VNDN.
A consumer node (the Requester) issues an Interest packet that
contains the content name, instead of naming the end-to-end
hosts, when it wants to get service [5]. When a data holder
receives the Interest, it prepares a Data packet and sends the
packet to the requester. Compared to the nodes in the traditional
IoV, the vehicles in the VNDN are allowed to communicate
with each other diametrically, prior to the knowledge of any
authentication or IP address.
A. Motivation
In the VNDN, a consumer will broadcast its Interest if it
desires information. If more than one node has the content that
the consumer wants and receives the Interest, then all of these
nodes will send their Data to the requester separately, which
may lead to a waste of transmission resources and even a broad-
cast storm, especially in large-scale networks. An appropriate
matching mechanism will be beneficial to the system, that is,
find the best match among these nodes for packet reply. Another
concern is the authenticity of the propagated information. In
content-centric IoV, vehicles may request traffic information,
such as traffic accident information. Effective data sharing on
traffic conditions will greatly optimize road utilization. How-
ever, malicious nodes in the VNDN may disseminate fake
messages, which may aggravate the driving efficiency. Many
vehicles may receive such false information and lead to traffic
congestion or cause an accident. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish a reputation evaluation scheme (RES) to encourage
nodes to publish reliable information during data sharing.
More practically, vehicles with traffic or entertainment infor-
mation may be not willing to participate as suppliers in a service
trading market due to their concerns over the transmission

energy consumption or privacy. In this case, information supply
and demand are unbalanced among vehicles. Moreover, privacy
leakage [6], [7] is also an important issue. The traditional cen-
tralized interactive information trading relies on a trusted third
party such as Base Station (BS), which suffers from problems
including single point of failure and privacy leakage. Therefore,
it is imperative to design a proper incentive mechanism and
privacy protection scheme to encourage more vehicles to share
their resources while preserving the privacy of vehicles during
the trade.
B. Contribution
To address security, a promising blockchain technology with
the advantages of decentralization, security, and trust has been
introduced in recent years [8], [9].
It has been successfully applied in many fields, such as
smart contracts, public key infrastructure (PKI), domain name
server (DNS), decentralized Internet of Things (IoT), and
IoV [10].
Considering that the computational complexity in matching
execution increases with the number of nodes and allocating
supply and demand for all nodes is time consuming, we exploit
the blockchain technology to develop a regionalized secure
information transaction trading system in the VNDN.
The contributions of this article are summarized as follows.
1) We exploit a double-layer blockchain for data sharing,
which ensures data transmission security. And incentives
have been developed to encourage information sharing
between nodes.
2) To prevent malicious nodes from spreading false mes-
sages, we design a reasonable RES, which scores the
quality of service of different providers by combining
negative and positive sharing records.
3) A trading system that is modeled as a one-to-many match-
ing problem to balance the client requirements with the
server’s supply. We define different utility functions for
both server and client to maximize social welfare.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. The system
elements is described in Section II. Section III presents the
system model of our information trading system. Section IV
defines and mathematically formulates the matching problem.
Section V presents the assignment game algorithm. Section VI
is the numerical analysis of our proposed protocol. Finally,
Section VII concludes of this article.
II. SYSTEM ELEMENTS
A. Core System Components
The model for information-centric data trading among ve-
hicles is shown in Fig. 2. The core system components are as
follows.
1) On-Board Units (OBUs): We assume that each vehicle is
equipped with OBU for data trading. There are three kinds of
OBU in localized content trading in our system: client OBU,
server OBU, and relay OBU. Each OBU chooses its own char-
acter based on its demand status and network demand.
2) Roadside Units (RSUs): RSUs aggregate local transac-
tions or wireless communication services for OBUs. They can
also act as information exchange brokers, i.e., they collect the
supply and demand of different clients and servers for allocation.
3) Prerequisites for the Realization of VNDN Data Trading:
Each wireless access point with a built-in ledger records the
transactions history of traded information among OBUs. The
client OBUs pay to the server OBUs according to the records
in the smart ledger. Each OBU and RSU has storage space to
hold the transaction record. OBUs can cache the information
downloaded from the cellular network or gets it from other
nodes. To make the transaction more convenient, we present a
new digital cryptocurrency, vehicle coins, as the virtual currency
to trade data.

B. Double-Layer Blockchain in VNDN
In this article, a double-layer blockchain is built for secure
content sharing in the VNDN. A content retrieval in a large-scale
VNDN may be difficult due to the number of vehicles on a road
section. Besides, the aggregation of forwarding information base
(FIB) is troublesome because of the OBUs’ mobility. During
data trading, we divide the OBUs into several groups. The
grouped OBUs (GOs) will request for data within its group by
diffusing their Interests, i.e., with NDN. However, some of the
requests may not be satisfied within the scope of the current
group, in which case, each group will send their unsatisfied
requests to RSU seeking services.
1) Blockchain Selection: We treat different groups as sep-
arate companies. The request from a GO of a company will
first be transmitted to the members within the company. If the
request is satisfied, the client will pay for the server, and this
transaction will be recorded. The transaction is completed faster
within a group compared to spreading the Interest to a large-scale
network. Obviously, the members in a different company are
different, and the content they request may be different, so the
transaction records maintained by different companies are also
different. Considering these characteristics of the GOs, we built
a private blockchain for OBUs (PBO) to guarantee transaction
security. A private blockchain is an important technology in
achieving an encrypted transaction. The biggest benefit of a
private blockchain compared to a centralized database is the
ability to encrypt audits and publicly identifiable information.
No one can tamper with the data, and when an error occurs, the
source of the error can be traced. The private chain is faster and
cheaper than the public chain, while still respecting the client’s
privacy.
If there are requests that cannot be satisfied by other GOs
within the group, the group will seek for help from RSUs. The
RSUs will collect the demands and data available of different
PBOs and make further matching. In a consortium blockchain,
the generation of each block is determined by all preselected
nodes. Other nodes can participate in transactions, but they do
not participate in the consensus process [11]. A consortium
blockchain can shorten blocks’ creation time [12]. In this article,
we build a consortium blockchain for RSUs (CBR), which can
be seen as intermediary agents for balancing supply and demand
of PBOs, to release the high cost while processing consensus.
2) Transaction Record and Block Preparation: The transac-
tion records of the data exchange are stored in smart ledgers. The
OBUs’ anonymities, location information, transacted data, deal
price, and the timestamp of transaction generation are included
in trading information. For security and authenticity, the transac-
tions are encrypted with the digital signatures of the transactors.
After recording the transaction, these records are encrypted
and structured into blocks in a linear chronological order, after
being audited by the consensus process. For traceability and
verification, each block contains information, such as the digital
signature of the primary node and the hash value of the block.
After the transaction have been packed in blocks and added to
the blockchain, the data become accessible to OBU and RSU in
the blockchain.
III. INFORMATION TRADING SYSTEM WITH
DOUBLE-LAYER BLOCKCHAIN
Fig. 2 illustrates the system model of the double-layer
blockchain built for secure content sharing in the VNDN. At
the bottom layer, we divide the vehicles into several group
blockchains based on the movement trends similarity, i.e., PBO.
Then, at the top layer, the consensus process is executed by the
preselected RSUs, i.e., CBR. We assume that all vehicles that
tend to participate in information sharing systems are legitimate
entities after registering with a trusted authority.
A. Operation Details on PBO
1) Group Initialization in Data Trading: In the data trading
system, we divide the vehicles into several groups. To achieve
a higher data trading efficiency, we concentrate more on the
robustness of the group when grouping the OBUs, i.e., balance
the number of each group and have fewer entries or departures.
We take the mobility value defined in mobility-based metric

for clustering (MOBIC) [13] as a foundation to initialize the
PBO. The main idea of the MOBIC is to take into account
the current position and mobility of the individual nodes with
respect to its neighbors. The relative mobility metricM rel
Y (X) =
10 log10
RxPrnewX→Y
RxProldX→Y
denotes the relative mobility between X and
Y , where RxPrX→Y indicates the distance between the trans-
mitting and receiving node pair (X,Y ). The subscripts new and
old indicate the parameter with current time slot and previous
slot, respectively. After that, the mobility valueMY can be found
by calculating the variance of relative mobility samples
MY = var0(M
rel
Y (X1),M
rel
Y (X2), . . .,M
rel
Y (Xm)) (1)
where NeighborY = {X1, X2, . . ., Xm}. The vehicle with the
largest mobility value is selected as the first PBO center, which
act as a representative to negotiate with RSU. Then, this center
and its neighbors form the first group. The vehicle with the
largest mobility value among the unclassified nodes is selected
as the second PBO center. This process is executed until all
vehicles are grouped.
2) System Preparation: After the grouping, each center will
first register with the RSU, and publish its information, including
electronic signature, location, group number, and so on, to
other members. The node receiving the information from the
central node will get its own public/privacy key, certificate,
and wallet address. Each vehicle will issue the content that it
holds by announcing its content name, position, and signature
periodically. A node will follow the process, as shown in Fig. 3
for new content creation: D0 first prepares a hello packet, and
then, broadcasts the packet to its neighbors (D1, D2, D3) within
its group. Receiving a hello packet with its hop count equals 1,
the recipients would update its FIB and append its signature,
position, and hop count information in the hello packet. In this
way, the hello packet i is created. Then, Di will broadcast hello
packet i to its neighbors. Upon receiving a hello packet with hop
count equals 2, the receivers (D4, D5) would add the new item
(content, forwarder) to its FIB if the newly received nonce did
not exist previously; otherwise, this packet will be dropped.

Fig. 5. Consensus process.
3) Data Trading Among OBUs: Client OBUs prepare Inter-
est that specifies the content name and send out the Interest. After
data trading, the client pays for the data transaction through a
wallet address of the server, as shown in Fig. 4. The consumer
generates transaction records, and the server verifies them for
further audit.
4) Building Blocks and Carrying Out Consensus Process:
After trading, PBO centers collect all local data transaction
records and pack them into a block within its group. The block is
stored in the system after being confirmed. It is difficult for the
vehicles in our system to mine a block by calculating the hash
value based on a random nonce value because vehicles have
limited computing power and proof-of-work (PoW) imposes a
high level of computational cost on the transaction verification
process. Therefore, the center selected to pack the block will
act as the leader of the current consensus process, as shown in
Fig. 5. During the consensus process, the center first broadcasts
the block data to its members. After a series of audits, the header
will send the transaction record to other members if the majority
of the members agree on the blocks. Then, the leader will be
awarded with vehicle coins and the current block will be stored
in the blockchain.
5) System Maintenance: It is generally known that the topol-
ogy in IoV is not stable, even in highway environments. There-
fore, we must take into account the effect of the topological
dynamics on the group changes. When an OBU drives away
from the current leader, it will leave the current PBO. After that,

if there is another PBO center within its communication range,
the node will submit an application for certification to the leader
to join this new group. Otherwise, this node will regard itself as
the center of a new group. Note that the cluster and maintenance
method are not the focus of this article.
B. Operation Details on CBR
1) System Preparation: After registering with the nearest
RSU, each header becomes a legitimate entity and a member
over which the RSU has jurisdiction. After that, the RSU works
as a supervisor of the headers and treats each group as an
individual. All RSUs in a certain area constitute a CBR.
2) Data Trading Among PBOs: Each PBO header would col-
lect all unsatisfied requests (demand) and the name of available
data (supply) periodically. Then, these request/content name will
be packaged and sent to the nearest RSU. The RSU matches the
data supply and demand among the PBOs. Here, we take the
matching theory to execute data negotiation and transactions
among PBOs. (Details of the matching mechanism will be given
in Section IV.) After matching, as shown in Fig. 6, the RSU will
create the transaction record.
3) Building Blocks and Finding Proof-of-Work: The process
of building blocks is identical to that of the PBO. RSUs within a
CBR need to verify (mine) a block by solving a computationally
difficult PoW puzzle [14]. Every RSU competes to find a hash
value that meets a preset difficulty [15]. The fastest RSU is
selected as the header of the CBR.
4) Carrying Out Consensus Process: The fastest RSU with
a valid PoW becomes the leader of the current consensus process.
The details of the consensus process of the CBR is the same as
that of the PBO.
IV. PROBLEM DEFINITION FOR TRADING
In this section, we present the problem definition in the
network to maximize social welfare about data sharing.
A. Reputation Management in CBR
In data sharing, the vehicle may diffuse false information
because of faulty sensors, virus infection, or even for selfish
reason [16], [17]. To alleviate the impact of such malicious
messages on system deterioration, we must endeavor to suppress
the spread of these false messages. As a general rule, requesters
are reluctant to request information from providers who always
spread falsehood. To improve the transmission availability, it
is essential to design a mechanism that quantifies the vehicle’s
reputation.
We propose an RES for high-quality data sharing in this
section. providerj toward requesteri, i.e., Rj→i, by taking
their interaction history into consideration. This consists of the
requester’s satisfaction and interaction time. If a positive sharing
(PS) arises between the node pair, i.e., an interaction occurs
where requesteri found the data sent by providerj is useful,
the reputation of the provider toward the consumer is enhanced.
Conversely, an occurrence of negative sharing (NS) will lead to a
decrease in reputation value. Nodes with higher reputation indi-
cates that data with higher quality will be provided. Consumers
prefer providers with higher reputation values.
1) Confidence Level (CL): In an RES, a higher (CL between
requesteri and requesteri means that the requesteri has more
prior knowledge about the providerj , leading to more accurate
and reliable reputation calculation. The CL of requesteri toward
providerj can be calculated as CLj→i =
ITj→i∑
j∈N ITj→i
, where
ITj→i indicates the number of interactions between requesteri
and providerj , and N is a set of all the providers that interacted
with requesteri. Since there are two kinds of interactions, i.e.,
PS and NS, we classify CL into the following two categories:
CLPj→i
=
ITPj→i∑
j∈N ITPj→i
,CLNj→i
=
ITNj→i∑
j∈N ITNj→i
(2)
where ITP /ITN indicates the number of PS/NS interaction. In
this way, CLP /CLN denotes the positive/negative CL.
2) Interaction Frequency and Event Timeliness: A CBR is
not always reliable or always unreliable, and the trustfulness
between data provider and requester varies over time [15].
It is common sense that recent events have a larger impact
on the accurate and reliable reputation calculation. The credit
value of providerj toward requesteri can be calculated as
rj→i =
∑n
t=1 F(Tc − Ttj→i
), where Tc denotes the current time
and Ttj→i
indicates the time when the providerj shared data
with requesteri for the tth time. n is the total interaction times
from j to i. F(x) is a weight function that adjusts the relative
importance of frequency and timeliness. Similar to the CL, the
credit value can also be classified into positive reputation value
and negative reputation value
rPj→i
=
nP∑
t=1
F(Tc − TPtj→i
) (3)
rNj→i
=
nN∑
t=1
F(Tc − TNtj→i
). (4)
3) Reputation Management: A PS interaction between two
vehicles would strengthen the reputation of the provider toward
the requester. On the contrary, a NS interaction would deterio-
rate the credit value. Therefore, we can calculate the reputation
as Rj→i = CLPj→i
rPj→i
− CLNj→i
rNj→i
.
B. Data Transmission Rate
In a transaction, the client considers not only the credibility
of the server, but also the time required to receive the message.
Therefore, we have to evaluate the data transmission rate during

a data trading. The signal-to-interference-noise ratio of the PBO
header Hk that is registered to RSUj at the fth subchannel is
given by
S j
k (f) =
Pf
kL

∑
k′∈Kj ,k′ �=k P

k′j + σ2
(5)
where Pf
k is the uplink transmission power from Hj
k in the
subchannel f , Lf
kj is the propagation loss from Hk to the
RSUj in the subchannel f , and σ2 denotes the noise vari-
ance. Kj is the set of indices of PBO headers subscribed to
RSUj . Therefore, the uplink data transmission rate from Hk
to RSUj is T kj
r = B
∑
f∈Ckj
log2(1 + ck3 S j
k (f)), where Ckj is
the subchannel set that allocated to PBO header Hk by RSUj ,
ck3 = −(ck2 ln(BER
f
k/c
k
1 )), and BERf
k is the bit error rate [18].
C. Matching Function Definitions
An RSU divides all PBOs into two disjoint finite sets of
players for a particular content γk ∈ Γ = {γi}|Γ|i=1 in a time in-
terval T , i.e., clients Θk = {θki }
|Θk |
i=1 and servers Ξk = {ξki }
|Ξk |
i=1 .
The server can provide data for multiple clients; however, each
requester only needs one provider offering the data. In addition,
considering the selfishness of the node, clients pay servers
with vehicle coins in exchange for information. Therefore, it
can be modeled as a one-to-many matching with transfer [19].
The one-to-many matching is defined as Ψk : {Θk}
⋃
{Ξk} →
({Θk}
⋃
{Ξk})× R+, k ∈ φγ that satisfies the conditions de-
scribed as follows (where φγ = {1, . . ., |Γ|} indicates the index
sets of Γ):
1) Ψk(θki ) ⊆ {ξj′ ∈φθk ∈ Ξk} and |Ψk(θki )| � qik imply that
member θki can be matched to multiple members of Ξk.
Where φθk
= {1, . . ., |Θk|} denotes the index sets of Θk
and qki ∈ N indicate the maximum of θki may fill.
2) Ψk(ξki ) ⊆ {θk
i′ ∈φξk
∈ Θk} and |Ψk(ξkj )| ∈ {0, 1} denote
that each client ξki ∈ Ξk can be matched to at most one
server. Similarly, φξk denotes the index sets of Ξk.
3) Ψk(θki ) = (ξkj , p
k
ij) ⇔ Ψk(ξkj ) = (θki , p
k
ij) indicates that
if θki ∈ Θk is matched to ξkj ∈ Ξk with unit transaction
price pkij for data γk, ξkj is also matched to θki with pkij .
We denote our matching function Ψk with a three-tuple
Ψk : (Θk,Ξk,qk), where qk = {q1
k, q
2
k, . . ., q
|Θ|
k }. For nota-
tional purposes, θ0 and ξ0 are defined as the dummy members of
Θ andΞ, respectively. θ0 and ξ0 can be matched to multiple mem-
bers with no transaction [19]. Then, the (i, j)th element ζkij in the
matching matrix M is defined as ζkij = 1, if Ψk(ξi) = (θj , p
k
ij),
i ∈ φθ, j ∈ φξ. Otherwise, ζkij = 0.
D. Problem Definition
The purpose of our matching system is to maximize the overall
welfare of data sharing. In a transaction, what a client cares about
are the vehicle coins, the cost of energy, the quality of the data
received, and the wait time to receive the message. We define
the satisfaction level of requesteri while requesting for data γk
from providerj as
Qξki
(θkj , γk) =
1
1 + e
−ϑ[R
ξk
i
(θk
j ,γk)−REXP
ξk

(γk)]
(6)
where Rξki
(θkj , γk) = ςRj→i + τ
Sγk
T kj
r
implies the combination
of information reliability and delay, where ς and τ represent the
weights of information reliability and transmission delay, Sγk
is
the size of γk. Qξi(·) is the Sigmoid function [20] that has been
widely used for estimating the satisfaction level of users with
respect to service quality in wireless communications [18]. The
utility of requesteri is defined as
UREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p
k
ij) = μQξki
(θkj , γk)− pkijSγk
− υPi
rSγk
(7)
where Qξi is the satisfaction level, p indicates the cost, Pr is
the reception power, and μ, υ ∈ R+ are coefficients with unit
revenue per requester satisfaction and reception power cost.
The utility of a server is related to the vehicle coins it receives
and the energy it consumes per trade. Therefore, the utility
function of providerj is defined as
UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk, p
k
ij) = pkijSγk
− νPj
t Sγk
(8)
which reflect the monetary gain of the provideri and trans-
mission cost. Pt is the transmitting power, μ ∈ R+ is a fixed
coefficient with unit revenue per provider transmission cost.
Therefore, the objective function of our trading system is

V. ASSIGNMENT GAME ALGORITHM
In this section, we will introduce the assignment algorithm,
which is an improved version of the algorithm proposed in [19],
to solve the optimization problem in (11).
The system initialization is depicted in Algorithm 1 lines 1–3.
Note that not only is the requester selfish, but also the provider.
The provider matches the requester only if its utility is greater
than 0, that is, UPRO

> 0.
Consider the initial price is set as pk,tmin j ≥ νPj
t . To judge
whether the matching is complete or not, we construct the list
of all the servers and clients that remain to be matched denoted
by MATLISTs = {θj}|Θ|
j=1, MATLISTc = {ξi}|Ξ|
i=1, whenever
a node completes its matching, it will be moved out of the set.
The clients’ demand for information is depicted in lines 4–12.
Providers that remain to be matched issue their price allocation
offer Pk,t
j = {pk,t1,j , p
k,t
2,j , . . ., p

in each interaction t. After that, all the requesters determine their
demand set as follows:

(12)
Each requester prefers to request content from a provider that
maximizes its utility function. Therefore, the demand set for
requesteri is defined as the providerj that maximize the utility.
Note that the acceptable utility of a provider is greater than 0,
which indicates that all the dealer will not trade at a loss. If
providerj = S(pk,ti,j ), the requesteri will bid for the providerj
with price pk,ti,j , i.e., bk,ti,j = 1.
After the requester indicates its wish, the information provider
makes a matching choice. To maximize social welfare, in each
iteration, we make a match decision for only one requester. The
providers’ decision making is shown in Algorithm 1 lines 13–20.
During each interaction, a provider may receive no bids from any
requesters (case 1), receive bids from multiple requesters (case
2), or receive one bid (case 3).
Case 1 (lines 15–20) indicates that there are no requesters
that choose current providerj as their best match, but there
are several requesters (�k
j = {ξki }, i = argi∗∈Ξk b
k,t
i∗,j = 1) bid
for providerj in the last interaction. In case 1, the provider
will choose requesteri∗ that with highest reputation toward
providerj , i.e., i∗ = argmaxξi∈�k
j
Rj→i as its customer, in
this way, providerj is matched with requesteri∗ , Ψk(θkj ) =
(ξki∗ , p

i∗,j ). Case 2 (lines 21 and 22) indicates that there are
multiple requesters that choose current providerj as their best
match. The provider will increase its price by ε. Case 3 (lines
23–28) indicates that there is ONE requester that chooses current
providerj as their best match, i.e., |�k
j | = 1. In this algorithm,
it is different from the one-to-one matching, providers will not
leave the matching system until |Ψk(θkj )| = qkj .
The main differences between Algorithm 1 and the algorithm
proposed in [19] are as follows.
1) We created collections for both the requesterMATLISTc
and the provider SLISTs. Once a node pair is matched,
the two nodes will move out of the collection.
2) When multiple requesters compete for a node at the same
time, the competing node will select the requester with

the higher reputation value to match, instead of randomly
selecting
3) The end condition of the algorithm is simpler than the
previous version: as long as one of the two sets is empty,
the match is completed.
VI. RATIONALITY ANALYSIS
A. Vehicle Group Division
We deploy our simulation on a three-line scenario, assuming
that the initial position of the vehicles on the lane i(i = 1, 2, 3)
follows a uniform distribution with average node density λi.
Then, the number of vehicles located in an interval of length
l on the lane i follows the Poisson distribution. To evaluate
the number of vehicles in each group, we conduct a statistical
experiment on a specific road segment with a length of 2 km.
Fig. 7 shows the cluster changes with different vehicle densities.
These vehicles are divided into 5–7 consortia, and the number
of vehicles in each cluster increase with the increase in density.
To make the clustering structure more intuitive, we drew a
schematic diagram of the vehicle distribution and clustering
result. From the violin diagram, it can be seen that the variances
of the number of clusters and the number of users in each group
was small, and the clustering result of the system was relatively
stable.
B. Matching Stability and Complexity
In a matching game, there are two kinds of obstruction that
may impact the stability of the system: individual block and
pair block [21]. A matching Ψk is block by an individual if
∃ i, j, UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk, p
k
ij) < 0,Ψk(θkj ) = (ξki , p
k
ij)
or ∃ i, j, UREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p
k
ij) < 0,Ψk(ξki ) = (θkj , p
k
ij) (13)
which indicates that a match is completed with UPRO < 0 or
UREQ < 0. But, in fact, a node has a disposition to remain single
if U < 0. A matching Ψk is block by pair if
∃ i, j1, p1
ij UREQ
ξki
(θkj1 , γk, p
k
ij) > UREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p

and UPRO
θk

(ξki , γk, p

where Ψk(ξki ) = (θkj , p
k
ij) and j1 �= j
Ψk(θkj1) = (ξki∗ , p
k
ij) and i∗ �= i (14)
which indicates that both parties that complete the matching
tend to leave their current partner and match with other nodes.
A matching theory tutorial [19] defined that a matching Ψ is
defined as stable if it is not blocked by any individual or any
pair. Based on this definition, our system converges to stable
matching. First, all nodes are self-centered. A transaction can
only be completed if the utilities of both sides are positive.
1) Each buyer will only match with a seller in its demand set,
and the demand set is calculated by (12), with restrictive
conditionUREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p
k,t
i,j ) � 0, which ensures that the
matching utility is not negative.
2) Each seller does not trade at a loss, and pk,tmin j
is defined as pk,tmin j = νPj
t in line 3, by which
minp UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk, p
k
ij) = 0, and their utility
increases with the subsequent price increases, i.e.,
inf UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk, p
k
ij) = 0.
In [18], the theorem a matching is group stable if it is stable
is proved. Similar, in our model, assume that there exists ξki and
θkj such that
∃p1
ij UREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p
k
ij) > UREQ
ξki
(Ψk(ξki )1, γk)
and UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk, p
k
ij) > UPRO
θk
j

(15)
where Ψk(ξki ) = (θkj∗ , p
k
ij),Ψ
k(θkj ) = (ξki∗ , p
k
ij), and p1
ij �= pij .
Here, we have to prove that such p1
ij does not exist. Note
that UPRO
ξki
is a monotone increasing function about pij , to
satisfy condition UREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk) > UREQ
ξki
(Ψk(ξki )1, γk), p

pij . However, UREQ
θk

is a monotone subtraction function about
pij , to satisfy condition UPRO
θk
j
(ξki , γk) > UPRO
θk
j
(Ψk(θkj )1, γk),
p1
ij < pij . Evidently, there is a contradiction between p1
ij < pij
and p1
ij > pij .
Note that ξi will bid for θj only whenUREQ
ξki
(θkj , γk, p
k,t
i,j ) � 0.
Conversely, if ∀j, UREQ

(θkj , γk, p

(17)
Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the bargaining time changes with
different number of clients and price raising step ε. In Fig. 8(a),
we set ε = 0.5, and then, conducted a statistical experiment with
the number of providers ranging from 30 to 150. As the number
of requesters increased, the bargaining time increased as well
due to more clients competing for resources. The increase in
the number of requesters will raise the probability that multiple
clients bid for one server (case 2), i.e., p(
∑
i bi,j > 1), where
ξi ∈ SLISTs, θj ∈ MATLISTc. Under this circumstance, the
providers that received bids for multiple requesters will increase
their price, which leads to higher bargain times. And then, this
server will increase its unit price bk,ti,j of data k toward requesters
by ε. A too small price raising step ε will increase the bargaining
times. Only after several iterations, can the provider choose the
best matcher. From the figure, we can see that a larger ε leads to
smaller variation in iteration times.
For a more comprehensive analysis, we simulate the effect
of the price step and the number of requesters on the iteration
times in Figs. 9 and 10. As shown in Fig. 9, when the ε is small,
a small increase in the price raising step will greatly reduce
the number of competitors. However, as the step size increases,
the probability that the requesters’ utility function less than 0

Fig. 11. Social welfare changes.
[UREQ
ξi
(θj , γk, p
k
i,j) < 0] will increase, thus reducing the num-
ber of iterations. When the step ε is large enough, the increase
of ε will have less impact on the requester’s bids. As a result, the
magnitude of the reduction is smaller. For different number of
clients, as stated previously, the iteration times will increase with
the client increase because more clients may compete for ONE
server. When the number of requesters is much smaller than the
provider, the iteration times approximates linear growth. When
the number of both parties is relatively close, the growth rate of
bargaining times is obviously faster. As the number of requesters
increases, the growth rate of iteration times will gradually slow
down. The fewer the vacancies, the slower the growth rate. It
is worth noting that when the number of requesters is just one
more than the providers, as shown in Fig. 10, the bargaining
times will be slightly smaller.
C. Social Welfare
Fig. 11 shows the social welfare changes versus the number
of requesters/providers. We first evaluate the utility curve with
the number of requesters (the number of providers is set to
80). When the number of requesters is less than the number
of providers, both the client’s and server’s utility increase with
the number of requesters. Since the requester chooses to match
the node with the highest client’s utility, it grows faster than
the requester’s utility. When the number of requesters is greater
that of providers, the utility of the requester will drop slightly.
(The reason for this phenomenon will be described later.)

Fig. 12. Total welfare of different match scheme.
Fig. 13. Requesters’ utility changes.
For the server, the utility will increase with the requester, because
when the number of requesters increases, there may be more
clients competing for the same provider, which results in the
price increment and leads to the server’s welfare growth.
To highlight the superiority of the matching method, we
compared our matching method with random matching. Fig. 12
depicts the comparison of total social welfare with different
number of participants. At the beginning, the total utility was
proportionate to the number of requesters/providers. But when
the ratio of the supply and demand reached 1, the total utility
remained unchanged.
Fig. 13 illustrates the requesters’ utility versus the number
of requesters/providers. We simulated the case of several dif-
ferent vacancies. Vacancy indicates the maximum number of
clients that can be matched. 50 vacancies indicated that there
were 50 suppliers, and the maximum number of positions the
supplier may provide is 1 or 25 suppliers with two positions,
i.e.,
∑
j q
k
j = 50. Note that not all nodes had the same quota. It
is observed that the requesters’ utility was proportionate to the
quantity of requesters. As the number of requesters increased,
the total utility increased as more requesters were matched to
providers with positive utilities. However, but when the quantity
of clients was greater than that of vacancies, the utility of all
requesters decreased slowly, which is attributed to the fact that
multiple demanders requested for a small number of resources,
Fig. 14. Impact of initial pricing on system performance.
i.e., supply fell short of the demand. In each iteration, several
clients may compete to match with one provider, and in such a
situation, suppliers will increase their transaction price. In other
words, competition between requesters reduces overall utility. It
also clearly indicates that the changes in the utility is related
to the providers’ vacancies available. Similarly, there was a
positive correlation between total requesters’ welfare and the
number of providers. But once the number of providers reached
50 (/80/100), the growth rate of welfare slowed down slightly.
At the stage where the number of providers was greater than
that of the requesters, the requesters had more choices, they can
match the nodes that benefit themselves even more.
In addition, we also evaluated the requesters’ utility versus the
initial pricing. As shown in Fig. 14, with initial price increase, the
users utility decreased because they had to pay more. If the utility
of a node was negative, the node preferred to be unmatched,
which brought about an unsatisfied client. The requesters’ utility
first decreased near linearly with increasing initial price, and
the amplitude of utility decrement decreased with the boosting
price. The reasons behind such phenomena are lower individual
returns and lower matching rate. When the unit price is high
enough, a significant amount of buyers would prefer to remain
single. This induces the total utility to drop to almost zero. It is
remarkable that our simulation was set in a one-to-one situation
(there were as many vacancies as there were requesters).
D. Matching Rate
The matching rate is a significant performance index of any
matching system. It is directly proportional to the total number
of matched information holders that can raise their benefits
by offering information. Before each transaction is completed,
sellers will price the messages that they are going to share.
Fig. 15 illustrates the relation between initial pricing and the
number of unsatisfied users for various requester quantities. The
system performed with nearly 100% matching rate when the
initial price was less than 14 vehicle coins per unit. Intuitively, as
the initial price grows, the number of unsatisfied users increase.
From Fig. 15, we can observe that when the initial price was
higher, the curve will show significant fluctuations. At each
inflection point, there were more vehicles just at the critical
point of matching. If the initial price was less than the point,
more requesters preferred to match with a server; otherwise,
they remained single. The position of the wave inflection point
was also related to the definition of the utility function. If the

proportion of the price, i.e., υ, is reduced, the entire curve will
stretch to the right.
E. System Security Analysis
The blockchain-based content trading system can defend
against many traditional security attacks.
1) Hypocritical Message Release: We embed an RES in
information trading, i.e., publishing false messages can damage
the reputation of the node. The client node will not request
content from a node with a low reputation value, thereby, sup-
pressing the revenue of the malicious node.
2) Single Point of Failure: The OBUs can trade data in a P2P
manner without a third party, and the system will not be damaged
by one node failure.
3) Privacy Leakage: Since all accounts are pseudonymous
by multiple wallet addresses, the account security can be en-
sured. At the same time, during trading, the participants only
submit their bid prices to the auctioneer without private infor-
mation, which protects identity privacy.
4) False Transaction: All transaction records are publicly
audited and authenticated. Only the node-approved transaction
records can be packed into a block, and then, stored in the
blockchain.
F. Application Scenario
In IoV, there are two main applications of content sharing:
safety-related and nonsafety-related information. The demands
for information transmission in each scenario are different.
On one hand, the drivers can share safety-related information,
such as traffic accident and sudden braking. Here, the client is
more concerned with the reliability of the information than the
delay in transmission. In this case, the requester can increase
the weight of reputation. On the other hand, when passengers
require for nonsafety-related information, such as video about
live broadcast or music, the client may pay less attention to
the information reliability. The users can adjust the relative
weight of reputation and delay for different demands. Our secure
content-sharing scheme is more suitable for highway scenes,
where the relative position of vehicles is relatively fixed. In the
case of a rapid change in vehicle topology, the members of the
underlying blockchain would change dramatically, which makes
the accounting more complicated.
For example, the vehicles on the highway may request for
traffic conditions on different road sections. However, some
nodes may want traffic situation of road section A, but it only
has that of road section B. This node will send an Interest that
contains its desire to meet the needs. This Interest will be spread
within the group. If the request is not satisfied, the data that it
holds, along with its requests, will be sent to the header. After
that, the RSU will collect the requests and data content, and then,
does matching for both sides. Then, the requester will request
for information about traffic situation of road section A to the
matcher and pay for the content. Finally, the data sharing is
completed.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this article, we tackled the VNDN data sharing problem,
which broadly addresses the reputation management, informa-
tion security, and the data supply and demand matching. We
built a double-layer blockchain trading system for the VNDN
local area information transmission. To achieve a wider range
of data sharing, RSUs act as data aggregators for supply and
demand collection. After that, a one-to-many matching game
model was built. To prevent malicious nodes from spreading fake
messages, we designed a reasonable RES that was embedded
in the matching model. In our future work, besides taking the
client demand and server supply into account, we will extend our
one-to-many assignment game to matching with externalities,
and further, explore the data sharing issue to facilitate the content
retrieval with a combined matching problem.
