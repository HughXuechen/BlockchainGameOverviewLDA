1 Introduction
The goal of this paper is to explain the stable in the sense for the existence
of consensus equilibria for mining gap games by using one new concept called
consensus games (CG) under the framework of Blockchain Ecosystems which
mainly mean the economic activities by taking into the account of three types
of different factors which are expenses, reward mechanism and mining power for
the work on blockschain by applying consensuses including the Proof of Work
due to Nakamoto in 2008 as a special case.
By a fact that both equity and currency tokens are typically two kinds of
initial coin offerings (ICOs) like Bitcoin or Ethereum based on the platform of

Blochchains to provide a particular product or service, it is very important to
study the mechanism of Blockchain Ecosystems. It is well known that in the
Bitcoin world, all miners following the so-called Nakamoto’s consensus protocol
(2008), and work in a number of different groups (pools) to mine for Bitcion.
Work on the block in a process called “mining” is successfully and approved
due to the majority of miners applying key consensus called “Proof of Work”,
as each miner or pool may work in different ways, we need to thus deal with
the so-called “Pool-Games” of miners (also use the term, “Mining Pool Game”)
with their working (mining) behaviors as an individual or in a group (pool)
by following either cooperative or non-cooperative ways. In order to so do, we
will introduce a new notion called “Consensus Games” which will be used to
establish the general existence of consensus equilibria for consensus games to
describe mining behavior for Blockchain Ecosystems in Fintech. In particular,
we will focus on the general discussion for the mechanism of the phenomenon
called “Mining Gap Behavior” (in short, “Gap Games”) for miners under the
framework of general incentives consensus in which miners would avoid mining
blocks when the available fees are insufficient (in particular, if incentives come
only from fees, then a mining gap behavior would happen, for more in details,
see Carlesten et al. [3], Tsabary and Eyal [25] and related references wherein).
The idea to consider the mixture of both Nash and cooperative equilibria
together was originally studied by Zhao [29] under the name called “Hybrid
Solution”, and supported by recently work under Yang and Yuan [27], we are
able to establish a new tool by “Consensus Games” in topological vector spaces
without ordered preferences from the viewpoint of Blockchain in Fintech (see
also Di et al. [9,10])
Briefly, the “Consensus Game” is a new concept which allows us to discuss
if there exists an acceptable (may or not be “optimal”) collaborative strategy
which consists of a partial cooperative strategy and a partial noncooperative
strategy under a given consensus rule in which some participants are based on
cooperative, or non-cooperative game strategies by following such as mining
“Longest Chain Rules (LCR)” due to Nakamoto [20] consensus (see also Biais
et al. [1], Nyumbayire [22] and reference wherein) for the discussion with or with-
out occurring forks for blockchain acting as a platform called the “Blockchain
Ecosystems” or “Consensus Economics”). Thus, when comparing with the tra-
ditional cooperative and non-cooperative game, the consensus game is a natural
extension for a consensus economy, especially under the framework of the Bit-
coin ecosystem associated with Nakamoto’s consensus protocol. We note that
mining pool games were extensively studied by Bonneau et al. [2], Eyal [11],
Eyal and Sirer [12], Kroll et al. [18], Sapirstein et al. [23] and references wherein.
By applying the new concept called “Consensus Game” discussed by Di et al.
[9,10], the aim of this paper is to discuss he following issue which is one of the
most fundamental questions for consensus economics in Fintech:
“Is it possible to have a general consensus (for example, the Nakamoto’s one)
to lead the Mining-Pool Game stable in supporting the Blockchain ecosystem to
run (even with existing attacker) in terms of two issues below:
The Framework of Consensus Equilibria for Gap Games 47
(1) there always exists honest miners maintaining the Mining Longest Chain
Rules (LCR) (given the plausibility of mining pool attacking); and
(2) Bitcoin ecosystem always works (or, majorities of miners do not collude
to break it; here the term “collusion” means an attempt to violate the LCR and
for a high reward block)?”
2 The Meaning for the New Concept “Consensus Games”
By following the consensus protocol due to Nakamoto in year 2008, it is expected
that the way to follow a set of rules formulated by the consensus protocol truth-
fully for each miners (agents) from mining pools should correspond a prefer-
ence mapping (e.g., see the profit function discussed in next section) under the
framework of so-called the abstract economy model (see Yuan [28] and refer-
ences wherein), it thus is very important to study the existence (and stability)
of Blockchain consensus in the perspective of the existence for equilibria of min-
ers (from mining pools) to follow the so-called “LCR” (see the discussion in
Sect. 3 below) while with or without occurring of forks for blockchain of Bitcoin
ecosystems.
Based on the idea of the consensus mechanism associated with blockchains,
a mining pool game can be regarded as a problem to find a (game) strategy
under which some group of miners (called, “honest miners”) in the mining pools
(for Bitcoins) to apply for “LCR” consensus respect to either non-cooperative
or cooperative game’s behaviors though maybe some miners may take “selfish
mining” or “mining pool with attacking” strategies, this situation by the mixing
of both cooperative and non-cooperative game behaviors is indeed the concept
for so-called a “Consensus Game”.
For a given consensus G, by following Di et al. [10], let N = {1, 2, · · · , n0},
the set of players (or say, agents), and p = {N1, · · · , Nk0}, the partition of N .
For each i ∈ N , the mapping ui : X ⇒ R is a payoff function for i associated
with the rules of the consensus G, a normal form of a “Consensus Games”
is defined by the form: CG := (G, N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N ). Thus, a consensus game
(in short, CG) is defined by
CG := (N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P )
where N is the set of players (miners); p := {Nr|r ∈ R}, a partition of
N ; X(t) is the strategy space of player t; and X :=
∏
t∈N X(t),X(S) =∏
t∈S X(t),X(−S) =
∏
t�∈S X(t),∀S ∈ N ; and P (t, ·) : X ⇒ X is its prefer-
ence mapping of player t.
A point x∗ ∈ X is a consensus equilibrium of CG if for any Nr ∈ p and any
S ∈ Nr, there exists no y(S) ∈ X(S) such that
{y(S)} × X(Nr − S) × {x∗(−Nr)} ⊂ P (t, x∗), ∀t ∈ S.
We will use the consensus equilibria for consensus games in Sect. 4.

3 The Consensus Equilibria of Mining Gap Games
In order to discuss the general existence and stability problems related the study
from a number of literatures for mining pool games of Bitcoins consensus prin-
ciple introduced by Nakamoto [20] in Year 2008, we first give the description for
the Mining Gap Game.
1) The Concept of General Gap Games for Miners
As discussed by Tsabary and Eyal [25], the repeated search for the blocks
becomes a series of independent one-shot competitions, in each only one miner
gets the reward but all miners pay expenses. The reason to consider the expected
revenues, rather than considering the individual iterations we consider a one-shot
game played by the miners. A player’s strategy is the choice of start times of
all of her rigs: when each rig is turned on. The choice of start times are made
a-priori by all players. We define the profit function Pi(t) for the miner i (but the
corresponding utility of a player to be her/his expected profit), which is her/his
expected income minus her/his expected expenses at a given time t.
Here we recalled that a “Gap Game (GP)” indeed is a set of miners N :=
{1, 2, · · · , n} with a partition N1, N2, · · · , Nk of N which is a system (consisting
of n mining rigs controlled by k players), each Nj is a player, where j ∈ K =
{1, 2, · · · , k}: The player j controls the set of rigs with indices Rj .
We use “Block-Interval” to denote the expected block time interval achieved
by the protocol, let sj be the start time of each rig j, and using ŝj :=
sj
Block−Interval to represent the normalized start time.
Throughout of this paper, for the convenience, we assume that once a rig
is turned on, the time the rig requires to find a block following an independent
exponentially distributed with parameter μ(ŝ)), and ŝ denotes the vector of
increasing order n rigs′ start times. By assuming all rigs are identical (i.e., with
the computing power), thus each mining rig costs “Ccap” per time unit for the
ownership explained as the capital cost (for example), and “Cop” per time unit
if it is turned on explained as operation cost.
Without loss of the generality, we assume that the fees reward accumulation
over time to use a linear regression to model (see Tsabary and Eyal [25]). Thus,
total block reward is modelled as a linear function and denoted by λt as the “fees
accumulation rate”, and λ0 as the “base reward”, we have following notations
by defining “Expected-Total-Fees” being the expected total fees accumulating
during the expected time to find a block, namely,
Expected-Total-Fees := Block-Interval · λt,
and also define EBRR := λ0
Expected-Total-Fees .
By the fact that we assume any miner has only one option either joining or
leaving the system, and for the simplicity, we may suppose the cost of Cop and
Ccap are a fixed amount.
Next we discuss the profit function Pi(t) for each i = 1, 2, · · · , k at time t,
which allow us to establish the general existence of consensus equilibria for Gap
Games described in next section.
The Framework of Consensus Equilibria for Gap Games 49
2) The Miner’s Profit Function for Mining Gap Games
For a given miner i = 1, 2, · · · , k , assume a single rig j ∈ Ri with start time sj ,
the random variable in time for this rig to find a block is denoted by Bj , then
Bj is drawn from the shifted exponential distribution with parameters si and
μ((̂s)). For any time t and any player i, the active sets activei(t) and active(t)
are defined by activei(t) := {j ∈ Ri : sj ≤ t} and, active(t) := ∪k
i=1Ri. By
defining αi(t) := |activei(t)|
|active(t)| as the ratio of player i′s active rigs out of all the
active rigs at time t, then we know that the ratio αi(t) is continuous in t, and is
also the expected factor of player i′s portion of the total reward.
We also recall that players in general have two kind of expenses: The first
one may be called “Capex”, would be explained for the capital cost such as for
“owning a rig”; and the second one called “Open”, for example, which would be
explained for the operation cost such as for “keeping a rig active”. By a fact that
the Capex for all rigs is controlled by the player (whether turned on or not), it
follows for each rig, the Capex it imposes by time t is the quantity: Ccap · t.
Then for each miner i, we have the following profit function (e.g., see Tsbary
and Eyal [25]):
Pi(t) = αi(t)(λ0 + λt · t) − Ccap · |Ri| · t − Cop · Σj∈activei(t)
(t − sj) (1)
4 The Consensus Equilibria of Gap Games
Now for a given mining gap game, where i ∈ N = {1, 2, · · · , n}, without loss of
generality we may assume that Ti assigned a big enough value in the real line
R for time, and we define Xi := [0, Ti] and X :=
∏n
i=1 Xi. Then Xi and X are
both compact and convex subsets of the real line R and Rn for i ∈ N . Based
on the notations of a gap game introduced above, and incorporating with the
profit function Pi(t) for i ∈ N at time t defined in Xi, then it is easy to see
that a gap game indeed is a consensus game CG := (N,K, (Xi, Pi)i∈N ), where
N = {1, 2, · · · , n} , K = {1, 2, · · · , k} with the k′s partition N1, · · · , N2, · · · , Nk
of N as mentioned above.
We now have the following general existence results for consensus equilibria of
Gap Games in supporting the stability for Blochchain Ecosystems as applications
of general consensus game model established in Sect. 2 above.
Theorem 4.1 (The Consensus Equilibria for Mining Gap Games). For
a given general Mining Gap Game (which is indeed a consensus game (in short,
CG) if the profit function Pi (defined above) is concave from [0, Ti] �→ R for
each i ∈ N = {1, 2, · · · , n}, then the Gap Game CG has at least one consensus
equilibrium.
Proof. Note that for each i ∈ N , Pi is continuous in t, plus we assume that Pi is
concave, thus Pi is continuous and concave. All assumptions of Theorem 2.2 of
Di et al. [10] are satisfied, and the conclusion follows and the proof is complete.
Theorem 4 says that for a given consensus and a miner i, if its Profit function Pi
is reasonable well (see below for each special case), the consensus game theory
50 L. Di et al.
allows us to deal with the general framework for Gap games, thus we are able
to claim the existence for honest miners to keep “Mining Longest Chain Rules
(LCR)” under a reasonable consensus (e.g., such as Nakamoto [20]) which indeed
answer the following question in affirmatively:
“The stability for Blockchain ecosystems is there due to the existence of
the honest miners keeping “Mining Longest Chain Rules (LCR)” under a given
reasonable consensus, and thus we would claim the following statements:
(1): there always exists honest miners keeping “Mining Longest Chain Rules
(LCR)” (though maybe with or without either “Occurring Gap Behavior, or
Fork Chain” for blockchains), plus the plausibility of mining-pool attacking; and
(2): Bitcoin ecosystem always works (as the majorities of miners do not col-
lude to break it).”
As applications of Theorem 4, we have the following Remark 4 by assuming
the operation cost for the Gap Game’s system being zero.
Remark 4.1 (The Mining Pool Game is Stable without Operational
Cost).
Indeed, for each miner i, by (1) it follows that the Profit function Pi(t) has the
following form:
Pi(t) = αi(t)(λ0 + λ · t) − Ccap · |Ri| · t.
By the fact that the term “−Ccap · |Ri| · t′′ play a huge negative role for player i’s
income in terms of profit function Pi at time t, thus one way to reduce the loss for
the system (in terms of Pi(t)) is to make the ratio αi(t) as bigger as possible at time
t. If assume miner i′s computing power is mi for i ∈ N , then one of the possible
best options (strategies) for player i is to run all rigs, and thus activei(t) = mi
and so we have αi(t) = mi
Σk
j=1mj
for any time t ∈ [0, Ti]. Thus the ratio αi(t) is
independent of t and thus concave, therefor the concavity assumption is satisfies,
which implies that the system for the gap game without operational cost always
has at least one equilibrium with the mining’s starting time for miners at zero (thus
in the situation without operational cost, the pool games in general has no “Gap”
phenomenon as all miners like to start mining with starting time zero (due to the
fact without any expense of the operational cost).
When the system of mining pool games has no capital and operational cost,
then we have the following general result for mining pool game without the
phenomenon of the Gap game behavior to occur.
Theorem 4.2 (The Ming Gap Games without Capital and Operational
Cost). For a given general Gap Game with both Capital and Operational Costs
are zero, if assume the ratio function αi(t) is concave in t for each i ∈ N =
{1, 2, · · · , n}, then the mining pool game has at least one consensus equilibrium,
and no phenomenon of gap game behavior.
Remark 4.2. When both Cop = 0 and Ccap(t) = 0, by considering the Profit
function Pi(t) = αi(t)(λ0 + λt · t). The best way to increase the value of Pi(t) is
to fully run rigs, thus it is best at the beginning to have αi = mi
Σk
j=1mj
, where mi
The Framework of Consensus Equilibria for Gap Games 51
is the mining power for miner i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. In this way, αi(t) is a constat,
thus all assumptions of Theorem 4 are satisfied, which leads the system has at
least one equilibrium.
5 The Conclusions
We wish to point out that the study on the existence of Mining Gap games and
related stability for mining-pools games by applying consensus games show that
the concept of consensus equilibria would play a key role for the development of
fundamental theory for consensus economics. Indeed, the concept of consensus
games can also be used to establish the general fundamental results in supporting
existence and related stability for mining pool games of Bitcoin economics, and
the study for data trading of IoTs and related consensus management (see Di
et al. [10], Kang et al. [16] and references wherein).
We also note that problems related to smart contracts related Blockchains,
