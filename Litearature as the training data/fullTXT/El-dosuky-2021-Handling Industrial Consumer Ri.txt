Abstract. The main objective of this research paper is to propose a business
model to dealwithwarranties of products bought by clients and present a prototype
implementation for a vehicle supply chain. Many customers have fake warranties
which reduce customer loyalty to large companies. Therefore, the blockchain
features can be used here as a technical solution. It can connect each device data
and product lifetime to preserve consumer rights, by arranging companies with
the highest guarantee under the blockchain. Furthermore, a proposed blockchain
business model (BBM) is presented that regulates the life cycle of any product, the
manufacturer under the control of the blockchain. The paper provided a case study
for vehicle industry. After implementing blockchain structures, it was proven and
observed that the blockchain is scalable to huge number of devices. This leads
to obvious results and transparency among the giant companies in the interest of
the client, and eliminating consumer rights issues such as black market and over
prices.

1 Introduction
Blockchain offers business value in 3 main areas that are value transfer, smart contract,
and recordkeeping [1]. Recordkeeping considers creating immutable records under a
consensus protocol without reliance on a third party.
Governments can adopt blockchain to start a cycle of trust in the legal and financial
system, in areas such as identity management, voting and protecting sensitive data [2].
This paper proposes a business model that regulates the life cycle of the consumer
with governance of the Ministry of Industry and the manufacturer under the existence of
blockchain. Blockchain can be used as a preservation of consumer rights and customer
satisfaction feedback.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes an overview
of interdisciplinary blockchain and supply chain governance. Section 3 is the proposed
business model in details and its implementation, and showing blockchain structure.
Finally, Sect. 4 contains conclusion and future directions.
2 Overview
2.1 Blockchain Basic Concepts
Blockchain is basically a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of transactions,
without a central authority [3].
There are four types of blockchains as shown in Fig. 1 [4]. Public permissionless
blockchain can be read, written and committed by anyone such as Bitcoin. Public per-
missioned blockchain can be read by anyone, written and committed by authorized
participants such as supply chain ledger for retail brand. Consortium blockchain is read
by a restricted set of participants, written and committed by authorized participants such
as a set of banks with a shared ledger. Private permissioned blockchain can be read,
written and committed by network operator only such as an external ledger shared by
an enterprise and its subsidiaries.

Despite the supremacy of blockchains and their potential, there are threeweaknesses,
namely scalability, privacy and governance [3]. The paper in hand focuses on governance
problem for two reasons. First, governance problem emerges after the collapse ofwidely-
advertised platforms. Second, many solutions are proposed to scalability and privacy
problems but they all seem to need “some degree of centralization” of governance as in
a “Masternode” [3].

2.2 Blockchain-Based Governance
There are twelve principles of blockchain-based governance [5]. First, for ages the State
and bureaucracy have been a remedy of scaling problem in order to achieve consen-
sus and coordination. Second, State as a hierarchical organization can be modeled as
a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), which means that the failure of a component yields
to the failure of the entire system. Third, distributed architectures introduce trust-by-
computation concept. Forth, Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs) in which
relationships between individuals and the State can be automated by “a series of instant
atomic interactions.” Fifth, a nation can be put on the blockchain in a Starbucks-style
public administration. Sixth, globalized government services without borders that inter-
act with each others in order to achieve citizen satisfaction. Seventh, blockchain can help
achieving direct democracy. Eighth, futarchy in which individuals vote twice, one for
general outcomes, then for proposals to achieve those aforementioned outcomes. Ninth,
decentralized services are still based on the authority of the State. Tenth, a new social
contract characterized by DACs, with no need for the State as a novel direction affecting
the citizen culture. Eleventh, franchulates that is amixing of “franchise” and “consulate”,
which means availability of the blockchain anytime anywhere. Twelfth, authority float-
ing freely that is already happening in information industry, in which works operate in
open areas.
2.3 Blockchain for Supply Chain
A Supply Chain consists of all stakeholders involved in achieving a customer’s request
[6]. Figure 2 shows the product journey from order to delivery.
Blockchain has a great impact in achieving supply chain six objectives of cost, speed,
dependability, risk reduction, sustainability, and flexibility as narrated in [7]. However,
there are many supply chain due diligence challenges regarding to blockchain such
as supply chain fragmentation, the traceability of goods flow, transparency and risk
information [8].
Challenges of adapting blockchain are divided into a dichotomy of technical and non-
technical [8]. Technical ones consider asset digitization, interoperability, and privacy ver-
sus transparency. Non-technical ones consider data model standardization, governance,
embedding responsible business conduct and including informal actors.
2.4 Blockchain as a Business Model (BBM)
Blockchain can disrupt the existing business models by three ways [9]. First way is by
authenticating traded goods. Second way is by facilitating disintermediation. Third way
is by enhancing operational efficiency.
Appropriateness of BBM is based on many conditions [3]: such as verification of
both transactions and data is required; feasibility of disintermediation in a technical and
economical way; many users need data sharing; and business processes need trust in
transactions.

Furthermore, there are five best BBMs that are [10]:
1. Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) which is the most popular business model;
2. Utility token business model which involves driving the functionality in business
through the use of tokens, such as Ripple and Stellar;
3. Blockchain-based software products, where any business should buy and integrate
a blockchain solution, such as MediaChain from Spotify;
4. Blockchain professional services;
5. Peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain business model.
3 Proposed Blockchain Business Model
3.1 Stakeholders and Information Flow
Figure 3 shows the stakeholders of the proposed blockchain business model, in which
blockchain is a backbone acting as the single source of truth. On one side there is the
business as usual showing the flow of goods from the factory to the consumers through
distributers. On the other side is the representative of bureaucracy such as the ministry
of industry and the chamber of commerce.
Figure 3 also shows the information flow. The factory can publish production details
such as location, time and quantity. Distributers can publish shipped product details

while in transit. Both warehouse and retailers can publish store details. Consumers can
publish anonymous feedback on the products.
Figure 3 shows vehicle supply chain with arbitrary bar codes. A factory may use
Global Location Number (GLN) to identify a location of products. An exporter/importer
can use Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) to identify logistics units. A warehouse
Fig. 3. Vehicle supply chain with accumulative blockchain bar codes

can use Universal Product Code (UPC) usually in USA. The Japanese version of UPC
is Japanese Article Numbering (JAN), while the European version is European Article
Numbering (EAN). Finally, the retailer may use QR code.
Mining blockchain for consumers is composed of accumulative blockchains of all
the factory, importer, warehouse and retailer.
3.2 Mathematical Model
The owner and curator of the blockchain is “Gov” which keeps track of all transactions
of products. The key activities are adding and validating blocks. A factory “F” can add
blocks regarding the production of product “P”. Then, an importer “I” can add blocks
regarding the importing process of the product “P”. Then, a warehouse “W” can add
blocks regarding the warehousing process of the product “P”. Finally, a retailer “R” can
add blocks regarding the retailing, selling, and reselling process of the product “P”.
This can be modeled as shown in Eq. 1:
Gov ← R(W(I(F(P)))) (1)
This can be easily implemented as aggregation in any object-oriented programming
language such as Java.
Any block contains a data “D”, and a hash “H”. The data accumulates all product
data and labels.
3.3 Proposed Blockchain Business Model (BBM)
Figure 4 shows proposed blockchain business model depicted as a business model
canvas. The key partners are internet service providers. The key activities are adding
and validating blocks. The value propositions are tracking products from production to
delivery.
The customer relationships are mainly for warranties. The targeted customer seg-
ments are any customer having access to the Internet. The cost structure is mainly for
blockchain server operation and Internet access. Revenue streams are mainly taxes.
3.4 Blockchain Structure Implementation
Implementation of the blockchain means blockchain mining procedure. The private
blockchain implementation can be later extended into another blockchain type. This is
an acceptable limitation to build a prototype that is programmed by using Java language.
Figure 5 shows Graphical User Interface (GUI). Product form, for instance, encapsu-
lates product details which are: ID, name, type, price, manufacturer, bar code, quantity,
production date, and expiry.

3.5 Comparing Proposed BBM with Traditional Supply Chain
Figure 6 shows blockchain structure mining. It composes all supply chain phases. At the
first run, the genesis block is created. Adding any subsequent block that encapsulates
the data shall generate a hash to the previous block.
Table 1 shows an observed comparison between proposed BBM with traditional
supply chain. Traditional supply chain has loose integration and separated phases, while
proposed work is accumulative. Proposed BBM is verifiable, easily to trace, and trans-
parent. ProposedBBMhas no over price fromblackmarket. It can also eliminate brokers.
Table 2 shows hash and time of creating 10 blocks for 10 products (vehicles).

4 Conclusion and Future Directions
A blockchain business model (BBM) that regulates the life of the consumer with a
government unit is proposedwhich can be used to preserve consumer rights and customer
satisfaction feedback. The paper proposed a prototype design of a business model that
eliminates consumer rights issues by using blockchain. After applying the proposed
model, interactions are verifiable and transparent.
In the future, many directions may focus on enhancing the security of the proposed
model. Another possible direction is to integrate tokens in the implementation. Another
direction may consider measuring supply chain performance [11–14]. Another direction
may be considering security of blockchain [15].
