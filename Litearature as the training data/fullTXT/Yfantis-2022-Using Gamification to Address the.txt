Abstract—The rising issue of corruption in the public sector could be solved
by adopting an innovative technology, such as blockchain, which offers data
transparency and immutability. We present the opportunities of using
blockchain technology in the transactions of the public sector of education and
a conceptual approach for the adoption of this technology by the staff of the
University of West Attica. Our research has practical value for the information
technology managers of the public sector who wish to integrate blockchain
into public organizations because we also suggest gaming features for the
main public sectors.
Key words: Blockchain, e-government, gamification, octalysis, technology
adoption, transparency
INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN
THE public sector is a collection of
institutions that coordinate the
demands of numerous groups who
request public activities of various
kinds in a variety of ways (Lane,
2000). The United Nations
Classification of Functions of
Government, which categorizes
governmental functions according to
their functions and goals, appears to
have taken hold as the global
standard for the different types of
public sectors based on functions
(Roness, 2017). Listed here are ten
primary categories of activity (United
Nations, 1991):
1) general public services;
2) defence;
3) public order and safety;
4) economic affairs;
5) environmental protection;
6) housing and community
amenities;
7) health;
8) recreation, culture, and religion;
9) education;
10) social protection.
Current public transaction systems
mainly include organizations, such as
governments that operate as
trustworthy, and central third parties
to authenticate operations. This also
places them as single points of failure
in the event of a natural disaster,
cyberattack, or perhaps other type of
disturbance. This fact poses a
significant challenge to the
sustainability of the delivery of public
services and the records they
store. Blockchain technology may be
able to aid the public sector in this
sector with some of its perceived
issues. The benefit and future
prospect of blockchain are in the
creation and improvement of
automated and decentralized
transaction systems that do not
require centralized
governmental authorities but still
guarantee authenticity and
transparency. Moreover, the history of
transactions and information is
unchangeable because, inside the
blockchain network, digital data
cannot be altered without leaving any
obvious trace of such activity.

Blockchain has the following
essential attributes in general
(Batubara et al., 2018).
Decentralization: Unlike a traditional
transaction, which is validated by
a central trusted agency, every
node in the network can validate
transactions and has a copy of
the ledger (Kshetri, 2017).
Security: With the use of a consensus
protocol, a timestamp, and a
cryptographic mark, inaccurate
transactions are not permitted,
and it is no longer easy to alter,
remove, or duplicate transactions
that have already been registered
in the blockchain (Peck, 2017).
Anonymity: Interactions based on the
blockchain systems occur
between two individuals who use
public-key cryptography to mask
their identities.
Auditability: All activities in a
blockchain are preserved
chronologically along with the
hash of the previous block and
the hash of the current session,
which is implied to link up the
next block when created.
Governmental organizations are
already looking into using blockchain
to store highly secured identities as
well as other confidential material,
including record keeping from the
land registry (Themistocleous, 2018)
and customs’ statements (Belu,
2020). Additionally, the use of
blockchain creates new possibilities
for data exchanges with citizens and
even amongst multiple agencies.
GAMIFICATION AND BLOCKCHAIN
ADOPTION
According to a global survey
conducted by the renowned
consulting firm BDO with participants
from the public sector: 43% of
respondents are researching
blockchain use cases, 35% are
experimenting with potential
blockchain implementation, and only
8% are implementing blockchain
applications in their public institutions
(BDO, 2020). A new technology may
bring changes to their business or
financial status, so it is very
important to manage the concept of
“change” inside the personnel for the
potential adoption of the new
technology. A method to tackle the
issue of technology’s adoption is to
find a way to affect the motivation of
the users in order to adopt
blockchain technology. Motivation is
divided into intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000).
Intrinsic motivation is a term that
refers to the intention of someone to
perform an action because the
person feels that this action is
enjoyable. However, extrinsic
motivation is the implementation of
an action due to external factors
(Mekler, 2015).
Gamification is the use of game plan
features (e.g., points, badges,
missions, etc.) to attract individuals in
nongame settings (Huotari & Hamari,
2017). Gamification is a concept that
mainly aims at the promotion of
motivation (McGonigal, 2011) and
embeds both types of motivation
(Richter et al., 2015) with elements,
such as badges, points, and others
(Muntean, 2011). Below, you can find
an example that shows how
gamification looks in practice
(Figure 1): The “Memrise” app is a
gamified language learning tool that
utilizes a variety of gamified
strategies (including a gamified
graphical user interface) to teach a
language. In this app, the user is an
astronaut embarking on a mission to
discover a new language. The more
the user learns the new language,
the more game levels increase, and
also several accompanying gamified
characters, such as alien cartoons,
evolve depending on the learning
progress of the user.
Many nations have included
gamification into their electronic
government. It appears that the
majority of governments are from
developed nations: Australia, Great
Britain, Singapore ([Yen et al., 2019];
[Pluntke & Prabhakar, 2013]), and
Spain (Garcia et al., 2019) are some
examples (Purwandari et al., 2019).
However, it also occurred in
developing nations, such as
Indonesia (Rahayu et al., 2017) and
Malaysia (Wei & Anwar, 2017). In
Stockholm, a speed camera lottery
fostered driver safety by enrolling
individuals who drove within the
speed limit in a lottery pool funded by
drivers who had received traffic fines.
Over the duration of a three-day

experiment, traffic speed was
reduced by 22% (UNDESA, 2016).
Gamification, as a tool, has not been
fully adopted by the public sector due
to the related challenges (Tolmie
et al., 2014). For instance,
since making an activity into a game
makes it more challenging to access,
this is a major challenge when
applying gamification to government
services (Mahni�c, 2014). On the
other hand, there is empirical
research data, which proves that
engagement games create trust in
the government and participation in
political processes ([Hassan, 2017];
[Kahne et al., 2009]). Summarizing
these findings, we believe that a
gamification design framework is
required to motivate public servants
to adopt blockchain technology.
The gamification of the adoption of
blockchain technology requires a
suitable design framework. Mora is a
scholar who reviewed the literature
and wrote a paper about the available
design frameworks for gamification
(Mora et al., 2015). The process that
the authors followed included the
identification of 21 design frameworks
and ending up with 18 frameworks.
The final 18 frameworks were
discussed by focusing on 5
dimensions:
1) economic;
2) logic;
3) measurement;
4) psychology;
5) interaction.
DESIGN OF THE GAMIFICATION
FRAMEWORK
In order to test the potential of using
gamification to encourage the adoption
of blockchain in the public sector, we
chose education as a sector and the
authentication of academic degrees as
themain issue to solve. In particular, our
interest lies in themanipulation of
academic records. Themanipulation of
academic records is common and
ubiquitous. AccreditedOnline Colleges
organization estimates that over
1 00 000 degrees are simply purchased
annually in theUnited States
(AccreditedOnlineColleges, 2020); this
could includemore than 50% of all
PhDs (Ezell &Bear, 2012). As a shared,
singular version of the truth, blockchain
technology in education has the
greatest value. Credential transfers,
academic record transfers, the creation
of credential equivalencies, and even
university administration processes
might all be automated, thanks to
blockchain’s combined authentication
and smart contract features (OECD,
2021). Blockchain technologies use
cutting-edge encryption in conjunction
with digital signatures to authenticate
both the origin of a credential (which
institution provided it) and the approved
recipient (OECD, 2021).
For the implementation of gamification,
we chose amotivation-oriented design
framework from among the 18 design
frameworks that Mora suggested (Mora
et al., 2015) becausemotivation has
been shown to improve trust and
adoption of information systems
([Akhlaq &Ahmed, 2013];
[Alalwan et al., 2015]). In this case, the
gamification aspect has the potential to
build trust among public servants and
influence their intention to use
blockchain technology. Therefore, the
design framework that was chosen
since it is motivation oriented is
Octalysis by Yu-kai Chou (Chou, 2019).
Octalysis is a gamification framework
consisting of all the gaming elements
found in games and implementing them
in real information systems.
According to Yu-kai Chou, Octalysis
includes eight core drives from the
design perspective (Figure 2).

This is the core drive where the player
feels that he was picked to
accomplish something very
important.
2) Accomplishment
This is the core drive where the player
expects to advance, create aptitudes,
and face challenges.
3) Empowerment
This is the core drivewhen players
attempt to take care of issues by
utilizing a diverse blend of knowledge,
so theymust be innovative.
4) Ownership
This is the core drive where the
players feel that they possess
something and can improve it.
5) Social Influence
This core drive incorporates all the
social components that impact the
player, including companionship,
social reactions, and rivalry.
6) Scarcity
This is the core drive where the
players need something since they do
not have it accessible right now.
7) Unpredictability
This is the core drive when the user
stays concentrated on the
progression of the system since he/
she does not have the foggiest idea
what will occur straightaway.
8) Avoidance
This is the core drive, which refers to
the evasion of a negative incident. The
system’s usermay be scared of losing
information, except if he acts quickly
with respect to a specialized issue.
The next step is to determine how to
apply the Octalysis framework to real-
world systems. According to Yu-kai
Chou, the founder of the Octalysis
model, any successful system will
often have at least one of the
eight core drives. The implementation
of the Octalysis consists of two
stages.
1) The assessment of the existing
system in relation to its capacity
of the eight core drives.
According to how powerful these
gaming elements are, each edge
of the Octagon will either extend
or shrink.
2) The modification of the system
by adding or removing gaming
features depending on the
Octalysis core drives that need to
be strengthened or weakened.
EXISTING SYSTEM’S
ASSESSMENT
In order to test the application of the
blockchain in theUniversity ofWest
Attica (UNIWA), we decided to
incorporate theOctalysis framework in
our system andmotivate the users to
adopt blockchain. The application of the
Octalysis was done in an educational
testing environment to identify the
advantages and disadvantages of the
system before its actual operation. First
of all, we ran an anonymous
assessment of the existing systemby
asking 20 people working in the
Information TechnologyDepartment of
the UNIWA for their evaluation of the
system in accordancewith the
presence of theOctalysis core drives in
the current system.We ended upwith
Figure 3, which depicts the capacity of
the UNIWA system in relation to the
Octalysis framework.
The result displays a good balance
between intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation (right and left sides of the
octagon), which means that the
university’s information system
includes gamification features that
can influence the overall motivation of
the users to adopt it. However, we
notice that the edges of the bottom
core drives (scarcity, avoidance, and
unpredictability) are expanded. The
bottom core drives are considered by
Yu-kai Chou as negative motivators
or black hat gamification because
they motivate the user in a negative
way (e.g., people act in fear of losing
something). Since our aim was to
make the users adopt the new
concept and the technology adoption
is associated with “positive”
motivation (Parapanos &
Michopoulou, 2022), we decided to
reduce the negative motivators and
add positive ones in the new design.
To that end, we removed from our
present design gaming features, such
as “countdown timer,” “progress loss,”
and “dangling,” and increased the
presence of positive motivators, such
as “badges.”
NEW SYSTEM’S TESTING
IMPLEMENTATION
Although there has been some
research on the use of gamification to
promote the adoption of blockchain
technology (Kenta et al., 2021);
(Treiblmaier & Zeinzinger, 2018), there
has only been a limited amount of use
of this paradigm in the public sector
(Carrasqueiro &Monteiro, 2019).
Regarding the implementation and
adoption of the gamified blockchain in
Greece, there is an interesting
approach by Siassiakos and other
researchers who propose the
combination of gamification,
data analytics, and blockchain
(Siassiakos et al., 2020). Inspired by
this work, we decided to create and test
a protype of a gamification approach to
adopt blockchain at theUNIWA. The
idea led to the creation of amobile app
that gamifies the personnel’s task of
verifying a student’s degreewho has
graduated from the university. In other
words, obtaining a degree from the
university is considered as a blockchain
transaction that has to be verified by the
public servants that act asminers.
The adoption of the gamified
blockchain environment by theUNIWA
personnel was tested by using a survey.
In particular, the application was
evaluated through the use of a
questionnaire based on theUnified
Theory of Acceptance andUse of
Technology (UTAUT)model. The
UTAUTmodel, developed by

Venkatesh and other researchers,
combines eight of themost influential
research theories on how people adopt
information technology, all of which are
based on social cognitive theory
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). Due to the fact
that we aremostly interested in the
effect of gamification, we adjusted our
model and ended up in the form, which
is displayed in Figure 4.
We handed out an anonymous
questionnaire to 30 members of the
university’s personnel, and then we
outsourced the task of the analysis to
statistics experts. After simplifying the
results of the survey’s Likert scale so
that they would be readable by
decision makers, we created Table 1
with the factors that affect the
adoption of blockchain.
The results of the surveywere
successful and proved that gamification
is themost importantmedium that could
influence the adoption of the blockchain
technology. Of course, the strong
influence of the social factor reveals the
challenge (due to privacy risks) of
incorporating social elements into the
system aswell. Probably, in the next
phase of the system’s improvement, we
may experiment with the incorporation
of Octalysis social gaming features,
such as “group quests.”
EPILOGUE
The successful implementation of
blockchain in public organizations
requires loyalty and acceptability from
the public servants, otherwise; the
devoted fundswill notmeet the goals of
the government. Our academic effort
specializes in suggesting a conceptual
design framework for gamification that
has an impact onmotivation for the
adoption of technology.
We tested a gamified blockchain
system at theUNIWAby using the
Octalysis schema, and the adoption by
the personnel was positive. However,
our testing was implemented on a small
scale andwith a small sample

population. Before the actual usage of
the gamified blockchain system, we
plan to test ourmodel further and
extend the number of theOctalysis
features that we used. To that end, we
plan to expand our research in future
papers and this work acts as an initial
step in the adoption of gamified
blockchain in the public sector.
Our research for the blockchain’s
adoption was applied in the public
sector of education. Regarding the
implementation of gamified
blockchain (through Octalysis) into
the other public sectors, we suggest
the following core drives that are
displayed as follows.
1) Public sector: General public
services
Suggested core drive:
Accomplishment
Reasoning: This is a sector
offering general services, so an
approach of offering challenges
would create creative challenges
for the personnel as well.
2) Public sector: Defence
Suggested core drive: Epic
meaning
Reasoning: The importance of
the sector’s content requires
gaming features that make the
personnel feel important as well.
3) Public sector: Public order and
safety
Suggested core drive: Epic
meaning
Reasoning: For the same
reason mentioned in the
“Defence” section.
4) Public sector: Economic affairs
Suggested core drive:
Ownership
Reasoning: Since economics is
a sector with a risk of losingmoney,
we attract users by offering them
gaming features, such as virtual
funds.
5) Public sector: Environmental
protection
Suggested core drive: Epic
meaning
Reasoning: For the same
reason mentioned in the
“Defence” section.
6) Public sector: Housing and
community amenities
Suggested core drive: Social
influence
Reasoning: The community
nature of the housing services
would require social gaming
features to motivate the users to
adopt blockchain.
7) Public sector: Health
Suggested core drive: Epic
meaning
Reasoning: For the same
reason mentioned in the
“Defence” section.
8) Public sector: Recreation,
culture, and religion
Suggested core drive:
Avoidance
Reasoning: The recreational
nature of this sector
requires gaming features to
prevent public servants from
distraction.
9) Public sector: Social protection
Suggested core drive: Social
influence
Reasoning: For the same
reason mentioned in the
“Housing and community
amenities” section.
Although these are conceptual
suggestions, we strongly
believe that gamification, due to
its motivating character, is a
medium that the public sectors
should make use of to introduce
new and innovative technologies.
In the case of the Octalysis
schema, there are plenty of
gaming features that are useful for
adoption, and the more the gaming
technology changes, the more the
number of available features
increases.
