*e power trading system has the characteristics of nonlinearity, dynamics, and complexity. Part of the business data in the
trading system needs to be exposed to numerous external business systems. *e traditional centralized power trading model has
some problems, such as low data security and trust crisis of regulators. Blockchain technology provides prominent ideas for
solving these problems. Firstly, the improved AdaBoost algorithm is used to predict the supply and demand gap of power trading
nodes. Secondly, based on the fact that the information on the blockchain is only open to the power supply side, a two-stage game
model of asymmetric information between the power supply side and the power user is constructed to capture the price
competition behavior between them in order to find the Nash equilibrium price in two stages. Finally, the US PJM market
electricity market data are used to carry out an example analysis to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and model.
1. Introduction
With increasing economic development, the demand for
energy source and electricity increases continually [1]. At
this stage, the main form of China’s electric energy trading is
centralized trading. In the centralized spot market, medium-
and long-term transactions are financial contracts, which are
purely bilateral contracts. In principle, the trading center
may not play a role. Foreign medium- and long-term
contracts are often completed through over-the-counter
transactions or future exchanges. In the spot market stage,
economy, real-time power balance, grid constraints,
climbing constraints, ancillary service constraints, etc., must
be considered comprehensively. Dispatching and trading are
inseparable. *erefore, in a centralized power market, dis-
patching and trading agencies are often the same main body.
According to the Power Reform No. 9 document, “Separate
the transaction business originally undertaken by the power
grid company from other businesses, and realize the rela-
tively independent operation of the transaction agency.” If
the dispatch and the transaction agencies are separated, how
to solve the real-time power imbalance will be a big problem.
*e distributed power market adopts the electricity
market model, which is mainly based on medium- and long-
term physical contracts. Both the generator and the con-
sumer determine the daily electricity consumption curve by
themselves in the day-ahead stage, and the deviated elec-
tricity is adjusted through day-ahead and real-time balance
transactions. *e market model that combines distributed
power market and centralized power market is the main-
stream model of foreign markets, and it also meets the
current development needs of China’s power market. *e
combination of large-scale centralized multiparty transac-
tions and decentralized bilateral market transactions is now
a relatively mature market transaction model in the world.
*is model gives users the right to independently choose
transaction objects, electricity and prices, and enables users
to select appropriate transaction entities based on their own
electricity consumption, power quality requirements, and
other factors, which further amplifies the decisive role of the
market in resource allocation and meets the characteristics
of China’s electricity market. *e feasibility of the distrib-
uted power market is relatively strong in the short term. *e

market are the basic models of the distributed spot power
market. In addition, the distributed transaction method also
has the advantages of energy saving and environmental
protection, high energy conversion rate, high operational
reliability, small equipment scale, etc.
However, in order to achieve real-time equilibrium in
the power market, in addition to integrating distributed
transactions in the power trading mode, breakthroughs need
to be made at the technical level to ensure the reliability of
transactions while realizing distributed power transactions
between power energy suppliers and users.
*e power trading system is a kind of nonlinear
complex system. As a trading platform for the public, it
covers the whole process of market management, trading
declaration, and market settlement. With the reform of
electric power system, electric power trading system will
conduct business with more external business systems due
to business needs. In this process, it is inevitable to carry
out a large amount of data interaction, and it involves
various data types and large amounts of data. At this point,
the importance of data security is highlighted. Data security
is the premise of transaction reliability. *e main business
of the power trading system is all around the sensitive data
such as electricity price. *e business data contain the real
declaration, volume, and transaction price information of
market participants in market transactions. If the data are
not properly stored and leaked through some links, it may
cause huge economic losses. *e traditional centralized
power transaction mode has low data security and cannot
guarantee the reliability of the transaction. With the rapid
development and wide application of big data, many data-
driven approaches for analyzing management problems
have emerged [2]. Blockchain technology is one of the most
advanced technologies out there and has potential in many
fields [3]. *e problem of data security and transaction
reliability can be solved by introducing blockchain tech-
nology into power transaction and using intelligent con-
tract to store and manage the information of power
transaction. Because the transaction data on the blockchain
node can be updated in real time, it greatly reduces the
information asymmetry between transaction subjects and
can improve the security and transparency of transaction
behavior, effectively control transaction costs and credit
costs, and achieve features such as customized electricity
sales plan, peer-to-peer transaction, and automatic
settlement.
Blockchain is a new application mode of computer
technology, such as distributed data storage, point-to-
point transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption
algorithm. Its data storage method is distributed, which is
consistent with the design principle of distributed trans-
action mechanism. *e distributed transaction process
based on blockchain technology reflects the flow rela-
tionship between energy flow, information flow, and value
flow among transaction subjects. Distributed transactions
often involve distribution network operators, distributed
generation aggregators, energy storage operators, major
power users, and decentralized power users. In actual
operation, each transaction subject has a platform network
service interface, through which the transaction platform
publishes information flow while electricity demanders
upload their own demand information. Under the trans-
action network constructed by the blockchain, various
types of transaction methods and clearing mechanisms are
programmed to form smart contracts. *e transaction
node in the blockchain sends the purchase and sale orders
corresponding to the trading period to the network
through the service interface to form an order book table,
and selects the corresponding transaction method
according to its own needs. *en, the order book table
automatically clears the market according to the clearing
mechanism corresponding to different transaction
methods in the smart contract. *e clearing result is
further confirmed and checked by the authorized node to
complete the transaction matching and pass the clearing
result to the user through the service interface. After the
actual delivery, the smart meter uploads the measured
energy flow to the trading platform through the service
interface, so as to ensure the accuracy of measurement, and
then the transaction is settled. *e value corresponding to
the transaction will be automatically settled and paid
between the matched transaction users. *e authorized
node is responsible for adding the transaction record to a
new block and packaging it on the chain, and at the same
time publicizing the viewing authority to the relevant
node. For the unsuccessful matching transaction in the
distributed transaction process and the power deviation
generated in the actual delivery, it needs to be balanced by
the upper grid. *erefore, it is necessary to establish a
deviation assessment and guaranteed power supply
mechanism, and the corresponding transaction contracts
and prices should also be embedded in the market
mechanism in the form of smart contracts.
In summary, the core variables of a distributed power
trading system based on blockchain technology are the
energy flow, information flow, and value flow of the
transaction, and the value flow is judged based on the energy
flow and information flow. *e connotation of value flow in
this article mainly includes forecasting transaction nodes,
electricity supply and demand gaps, and game pricing
strategies among transaction entities. *e core value of the
value stream of transaction behavior lies in its predictive
ability. Using historical information of transaction nodes to
build models to predict the relationship between power
supply and demand and provide decision-making infor-
mation for power suppliers is the fundamental way to op-
timize transaction efficiency.*is paper expands the relevant
research on the application of blockchain technology in the
field of energy system. *e algorithm is innovatively im-
proved to adapt to the data evolution characteristics of the
distributed power system, and the characteristics of general
information asymmetry in the power market are fully
considered when analyzing the formation of power price, so
that the price of the distributed power system is more
consistent with the market reality. For the first time, the
applicability of the model is verified by using the data of
electricity market in the United States.*e main structure of
this article is as follows:

2. Literature Review
Blockchain is a term in the field of information technology.
In essence, it is a shared database. *e data or information
stored in it has the characteristics of unforgeable, traceable,
open and transparent, and collective maintenance. Based on
these characteristics, blockchain technology greatly en-
hances credibility, reduces the cost of business cooperation,
and has broad application prospects. *e study in [4] be-
lieves that blockchain technology has proliferated in almost
all industries, but to varying degrees. Specifically, he found
that some industries such as transportation, communica-
tions, electricity, and new energy have a high degree of
technological integration and a wide range of application
scenarios. *e study in [5] gave a prospective on using
Blockchain as a secure, distributed cyber infrastructure for
the future grid. Firstly, the basic principles of Blockchain and
its state-of-the-art are introduced. *en, a Blockchain-based
smart grid cyber-physical infrastructure model is proposed.
Afterward, some promising application domains of Block-
chain in future grids are presented. Following this, some
potential challenges are discussed. In contrast, the appli-
cation of blockchain technology in finance, insurance, real
estate, and other industries is in the stage of theoretical
innovation, with few concrete application examples. For
most industries, the application field of blockchain tech-
nology still has a large room for expansion, especially in the
power and energy industries.
*e new technological revolution is fundamentally
changing the form and development of the world energy
industry. *e increase in energy demand and the change in
energy structure require a great improvement in energy
supply capacity, which often requires a huge cost.*e energy
system based on block chain technology can greatly reduce
the management cost of energy supply and energy demand.
*e study in [6] discusses the impact of blockchain on the
US power industry, and analyzes and evaluates pilot projects
that have been launched. *e research results show that the
block chain technology can improve the power supply
elasticity of distributed generation, stabilize the supply ef-
ficiency of power grid, and thus improve the energy
transaction efficiency. *e study in [7] analyzed and com-
pared the four mainstream trading modes of China’s power
market. On this basis, he integrated block chain technology,
proposed the basic development ideas of smart grid, and
emphasized the important impact of smart grid on power
demand management. Blockchain technology can improve
the efficiency of energy trading, and it has also dramatically
changed the transaction mode of the energy industry. *e
study in [8] took the photovoltaic industry as an example
and found that the production efficiency, product com-
petitiveness, market share, and innovation ability of com-
panies adopting blockchain technology have all been greatly
improved. Although many theories and proof-of-concept
studies on energy blockchain have been published, many of
them are not supported by large-scale real data. *e study in
[9] made a deep analysis of 131 energy blockchain projects
and found that the energy blockchain in the real world is
highly dependent on the participation of power grid oper-
ators, engineers, and energy suppliers. *e results of the
systematic analysis also show that the real-world energy
blockchain is developing very rapidly, with an exponential
growth year-on-year. However, the content of the infor-
mation-sharing agreement for energy transactions has be-
come the biggest point of contention. Based on a block chain
of photovoltaic on the given transaction mode, the authors
of [10] set up the benefit function of photovoltaic power
users and distributed photovoltaic aggregators, used
Stackelberg game model to determine the internal prices,
made optimal utilization planning through the calculation of
edge, and designed local consumption and transaction
mechanism based on credit scoring which punish the users
who consume low electricity and encourage the users to
consume through a moving load.
*e above literature comprehensively introduces the
combination mode and combination degree of block chain
technology and energy system from the aspects of energy
supply and demand management cost, energy trading mode,
and the development status and constraints of the energy
block chain in real world. *e core of blockchain-based
distributed energy transactions is smart contracts, which
require the power generation and energy storage capacity of
blockchain transaction nodes to meet the real-time supply
and demand balance. *erefore, it is particularly important
to predict the power supply and demand gap and use the
operation information to adjust the gap.
*ere are many ways to predict the gap between power
supply and demand. Power supply is often related to
macroeconomic environment, output decisions of power
supply manufacturers, and relevant government policies.
Power supply mode is divided into integrated, distributed
and integrated distributed. *e main types of distributed
power generation are photovoltaic power generation, wind
power generation, and biomass energy power generation,
mainly providing renewable energy. *e supply decision of
distributed power supplier is mainly based on cost-benefit
analysis. Various mathematical models for measuring costs
have been proposed. Among them, the most commonmodel
is the learning curve, also known as the experience curve,
which represents the relationship between unit cost and
power generation, and is also used as a common method for
planning energy development and policy analysis. *e study
in [11] focused on the relationship between the cumulative
R&D expenditure and cumulative installed capacity of
Complexity 3
renewable energy. Due to the different costs of renewable
energy generation, the author finds that there are some
differences in the shapes and inflection points of different
learning curves by comparing the differences in the learning
curves of wind power generation, solar power generation,
and hydro power generation. *e carbon tax policy in cli-
mate policy is broadly binding. *e study in [12] used a
stylized electricity market numerical model to analyze the
problems of carbon tax and electricity supply, and found that
carbon tax can adjust energy prices to varying degrees,
increase the price of nonrenewable energy, and expand the
market demand for renewable energy. In addition, it was
found that the decarbonization policy of the electricity
market can promote the development of renewable tech-
nologies, thereby improving overall social welfare. *e re-
ality that renewable energy is volatile and uncertain makes it
difficult to predict the power supply accurately. How to
quantitatively describe the distribution of wind power
output is the focus of [13]. Based on the assumption that
wind speed is a random variable that satisfies the normal
distribution and the nonlinear relationship between wind
speed and wind power, the authors of [14] established the
distribution model of wind power prediction from the
viewpoint of the physical mechanism.*e study in [15] used
the improved whale optimization algorithm to form the
bidding strategy model for maximizing the power supplier’s
profit and Weibull and Beta distribution functions for
modeling the stochastic characteristics of wind-speed profile
and solar-irradiation, respectively. *e proposed technique
was tested and clarified with an IEEE-30, IEEE-57, and
practical 75-bus Indian system.
Electricity demand involves nonlinear data. *e fore-
castingmethods include: time series method, neural network
algorithm, fuzzy logic algorithm, support vector machine
algorithm, and adaptive boost algorithm (AdaBoost). *e
time series method comes from Econometrics, and forecasts
are mainly based on the context of time series. *e work in
[16] used two different time series methods to study the
prediction problem of monthly peak demand for electricity
in north India, one was seasonal ARIMA method, and the
other was Holt exponential smoothing method. *e em-
pirical results show that the seasonal ARIMA method is
superior to the Holt exponential smoothing method in terms
of square error and absolute error. Similarly, *e work in
[17] used multiple regression time series to predict power
demand in Nigeria, and took electricity consumption and
national grid data as independent variables of the model.
Although the time series method has prediction ability to
some degree, its prediction accuracy is often not high. *e
work in [18] used the neural network to predict the monthly
electricity demand of Spain. He found that the electricity
consumption had a cyclical characteristic and this cyclical
behavior can be predicted through Fourier series.*e results
show that the neural network with Fourier series is superior
to ARIMA and other neural networks. Fuzzy algorithms are
often used to describe inaccurate or fuzzy data and make
decisions based on fuzzy data. *e study in [19] used fuzzy
prediction method to predict the demand of Huatacondo
renewable energy microgrid of Chile, and compared the
model with the adaptive neural network. *e results show
that the fuzzy model has better predictive ability. Similarly,
[20] also uses fuzzy methods to predict the demand of the
distribution system. Based on historical data, the author used
the fuzzy system to predict the future power demand. And,
through iterating the prediction error step by step, the fuzzy
system obtains higher prediction ability. Support Vector
Machine (SVM) is a machine learning method developed by
[21]. It has the ability of classification and regression and
belongs to unsupervised learning. *e study in [22] used the
SVM model to predict the power demand in Northeast
China. By applying the first-order moving average, a smooth
data set that does not consider seasonal changes was gen-
erated. *is data set was used as the training sample of the
SVM model to predict the power demand. Compared with
SVM, AdaBoost algorithm belongs to supervised learning,
and the output index has a clear classification label, which
reduces the uncertainty of the system. In order to obtain
higher power demand prediction accuracy, [23] compared
the weak classifier weight-setting methods of static weight
and dynamic weight. In order to improve the adaptability of
the classifier, the weight is adjusted according to the simi-
larity between the predicted output and the real output
during each iteration. Afterward, [24] combined Gaussian
process regression (GPR) algorithm and AdaBoost algo-
rithm, introduced preset threshold from the perspective of
statistics, and determined the weight of the final classifier
after two layers of training, thus obtaining a high prediction
accuracy. *e study in [25] presented a new hybrid adaptive
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and functional link
neural network (FLNN) trained by adaptive cubature Kal-
man filter (ACKF) for forecasting day-ahead mixed short-
term demand and electricity prices in smart grids. *e
proposed model comprises a linear ARMA-FLNN obtained
by using a nonlinear expansion of the weighted inputs. *e
nonlinear functional block helps introduce nonlinearity by
expanding the input space to higher dimensional space
through basis functions. To train the ARMA-FLNN, an
ACKF is used to obtain faster convergence and higher
forecasting accuracy. In [5], the study proposed a support
vector machine (SVM) forecasting model based on rough set
(RS) data by combining the rough set attribute reduction
and the support vector machine regression algorithm. In
[26], the authors proposed a learning method, which con-
sists of a deep learning algorithm with LSTM networks, and
tested the validity of the proposed method successfully on
the prediction of the load and price by using data collected
from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), the
Spain electricity markets, and Iran. *e study in [27]
presents a generic optimization framework (ANNEX
model), including three alternative algorithms for the
electricity market-clearing process in order to optimally
determine the annual energy mix of a power system. *e
study in [28] introduces a new short-term electricity price
forecasting approach called SASVQR, which is based on
support vector quantile regression (SVQR) optimized by
simulated annealing algorithm. *e study in [29] solved the
problem of increasing the energy efficiency of urban elec-
trical networks based on identifying factors affecting power
4 Complexity
consumption, developed a forecasting model on the basis of
seasonal schedules of electricity consumption by household
consumers, and proposed a control algorithm based on the
proposed seasonal power consumption schedules by
household consumers.
*e above literature collates and discusses various
methods of measuring power demand and supply, so as to
predict the gap between electricity supply and electricity
demand. *e power trading system based on block chain
technology needs to meet the real-time power supply and
demand balance. In addition to improving their own ca-
pacity, power suppliers can also balance the gap between
power supply and demand through price, which involves a
game process between power suppliers and power de-
manders. *e classical game model can be divided into static
game and dynamic game in terms of time limit, and can also
be divided into complete information game and incomplete
information game in terms of information uncertainty. *e
main application value of blockchain is to reduce the un-
certainty of information between the two sides of the game.
*erefore, incomplete information model has been widely
applied by many scholars. *e authors of [29, 30] creatively
introduced the multi-agent system and then established a
cooperative game model among power grid operators, en-
ergy suppliers, and users, which characterized the mutual
game relationship among energy trading participant and
provided a basic model reference for subsequent scholars.
*e study in [31] preliminarily explored the multimodule
collaborative autonomy model of the energy Internet under
the blockchain framework, and proposed the key technol-
ogies for the development of the energy Internet. He believed
that most of the researches explored and analyzed the ap-
plication of blockchain technology in the energy system
from the perspective of application mode and overall
framework, and rarely involved the solution of specific
problems. On the basis of the above studies, [32] analyzed
the relationship between the block chain technology and the
competitive game in the power market from five aspects:
information transparency, decentralization, dynamics, se-
curity, and rewards and punishments. He established the
local multi-microgrid market competition game model
under the blockchain technology and explored the practical
application mode of the block chain technology in the power
market. In addition, the authors of [33] used the nonco-
operative static gamemodel to study the market competition
relationship between power grid companies, newly added
power supply entities, and users. In order to solve the
limitations of the static game model, [34] established dy-
namic games of complete information in active distribution
network with multi-stakeholder participation while taking
the demand side response into consideration. *e study in
[35] proposed a trading model of PVmicrogrid cluster based
on cooperative game theory. On this basis, the researchers
also extended the traditional game theory. For example, the
authors of [36] studied the bilateral contract transactions
between generation companies and large consumers by
using the master-slave game model, and the authors of [37]
introduced the gray game theory to establish the gray game
model of auxiliary binding strategy in the power market.
*e above gamemodels are all carried out on the premise
that the decision-making participants are completely ra-
tional. But in fact, for the actual power market game, various
random factors will affect the final strategy, and the par-
ticipants in the game usually have only finite rationality. In
this context, evolutionary game theory is gradually applied
to power grid operation analysis. *e authors of [38]
combined evolutionary game theory with coevolutionary
game algorithm and analyzed the economic benefits of in-
teractive operation of microgrids and distribution networks.
However, there are few researches on the power market
operation mechanism of active distribution network by
using evolutionary game theory, and the algorithm to solve
the evolutionary game model still needs to be further
studied.
*is paper innovates in the following two aspects. First,
the AdaBoost algorithm is improved by adjusting the
updated sample centralization weight to the characteristics
of electricity market trading data, and then the research of
solving evolutionary game model is advanced. Second, a
two-stage incomplete information game model between the
power supplier and the demander is constructed to, re-
spectively, formulate the optimal pricing strategy.
3. Algorithms and Models
Realizing live power supply and demand balance is the key
problem of distributed power trading based on block chain
technology. *is section first uses the improved AdaBoost
algorithm to predict the electricity supply and demand gap at
the transaction node. And then, the manufacturer can
conduct a two-stage game with electricity consumers based
on this supply and demand relationship, thus formulating an
equilibrium price that is in line with the interests of both
parties.
3.1. AdaBoost Algorithm
3.1.1. ,eoretical Basis. *e AdaBoost algorithm has been
proven to be an effective and practical and representative
boosting algorithm. AdaBoost algorithm was improved by
Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1995, whose algorithm
principle is to select the weak classifier with the lowest
weight coefficient from the trained weak classifier and
combine them into a final strong classifier by adjusting the
weight of the sample and the weight of the weak classifier.
*e weak classifier is trained based on the training set. *e
next weak classifier is obtained by training on different
weight sets of samples. *e weight is determined by the
difficulty of each sample to be classified, which is estimated
by the output of the classifier in the previous step.
AdaBoost is an iterative algorithm. *e core idea is to
train different weak classifiers for the same training set, and
then combine these weak classifiers linearly to form the final
strong classifier. *is process involves an iterative change of
the two weights. *e first is the weight of the sample, the
initial value is uniformly distributed, and the new weight of
the sample is calculated through the iteration of the weak
classifier. *e iteration direction is described as a decrease in
Complexity 5
the weight of the correctly classified samples and an increase
in the weight of the wrongly classified samples.*e second is
the weight of the weak classifier. According to the classifi-
cation error of the current weak classifier, its weight in the
strong classifier can be calculated. With the increase of the
number of iterations, the weak classifier with smaller clas-
sification error has a larger weight and plays a more decisive
role in the final classification function. *e weak classifier
with larger classification error has a smaller weight and plays
a smaller role. Finally, the final strong classifier is obtained.
3.1.2. ,eoretical Derivation. AdaBoost algorithm is a for-
ward-distributed addition algorithmmodel, which is divided
into two steps: addition model and forward distribution
algorithm. *e final classifier is defined as
f(x) � 􏽘
M
m�1
αmGm(x), (1)
where Gm(x) is the basic classifier (weak classifier) and αm is
the weight coefficient of the basic classifier,m � 1, 2, . . . , M.
*e loss function of forward distribution algorithm is de-
fined as the exponential loss function:
L(y, f(x)) � e
− yf(x)
. (2)
Suppose the iteration starts with m � 1,
f1(x) � α1G1(x),
f2(x) � α1G1(x) + α2G2(x),
. . .
fm−1(x) � α1G1(x) + α2G2(x) + · · · + αm−1Gm−1(x).
(3)
After m − 1 round of iteration, fm−1(x) is obtained.
According to the forward distribution algorithm, fm(x) can
be obtained:
fm(x) � α1G1(x) + α2G2(x) + · · · + αm−1Gm−1(x) + αmGm(x)
� fm−1(x) + αmGm(x).
(4)
*e goal is to minimize the exponential loss of fm(x) on
the training set, using fm−1(x) and Gm(x) obtained by the
forward distribution algorithm, namely,
Loss � min 􏽘
M
m�1
exp(−yf(x)) � min 􏽘

exp −yifm(x)( 􏼁

exp −yi · fm−1(x) + αmGm(x)􏼂 􏼁,(
(5)
where, 􏽧wm,i � exp(−yi[fm−1(x)]) can be regarded as the
sample weight of each round of iteration, which depends on
the sample weight of the previous round.*e above equation
is equal to
� 􏽘

exp −yifm−1(x)( 􏼁 · exp −yiαmGm(x)( 􏼁􏼂 􏼃

Minimizing Loss, that is, taking the derivative of loss

yields

Based on the above setting of loss function and classifier
weight, the algorithm flow of AdaBoost forward-distributed
addition model is as follows. Set T � (x1, y1), (x2,􏼈 y2), . . . ,
(xn, yn)}, i � 1, 2, . . . , N, yi ∈ ± 1, where, (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is
the input set, which can reflect the power demand index on a
node of the block chain at a certain time, and
(y1, y2, . . . , yn) is the output set, which reflects the power
supply and demand gap of the node:
Step 1: initialize the weight, D1 � (w1,1, w1,2, w1,3 , . . . ,
w1,n), which follows the uniform distribution,
w1,i � 1/N.
Step 2: use the sample data set with weight Dm for
learning, construct weak classifier Gm(x), where

Step 3: calculate the weight coefficient αm of Gm(x) in
the strong classifier based on equation (7).

3.1.3. AdaBoost Algorithm Improvement. *e above basic
AdaBoost algorithm has two important problems. First, the
composition of the weak classifier is often based on the
single-layer decision tree, which is too simple to be suitable
for unbalanced data classification. However, the transaction
data in the power market tend to be highly volatile, which
will greatly reduce the efficiency of the weak classifier.
Second, when the training sample set contains some samples
that are difficult to distinguish, the sample weight will in-
crease due to themisclassification of the weak classifier in the
last iteration. If a certain target classification set contains too
many samples that are difficult to distinguish, the sample
data distribution of the next selection training will be dis-
torted and the algorithm will fail. *is section will improve
the performance of the weak classifier by adjusting the
updated sample centralization weight.
*is part will focus on solving the problem of supply and
demand prediction of block chain nodes. Now, the supply
and demand gap only have two directions, so the weight of
its loss function needs to be adjusted again and selected as
the category function of positive and negative. Suppose h(xi)
is the predicted output of the weak classifier to the sample xi.
*e loss function lt(xi) after the t rounds iteration is defined
as
lt xi( 􏼁 �
0, h xi( 􏼁 � yi,
1, h xi( 􏼁≠yi.
􏼨 (11)
Its complement function is: It(xi) � 1 − lt(xi). As-
suming that at the tth iteration, the training sample drawn
from the random distribution of the sample is Tt, then the
complement of the training set is 􏽥Tt � T − Tt. *e weight of
this iteration is updated to
lt �
1
zm
􏽘
xi∈Gm(x)
xj ∉ Gm(x)
lt xi( 􏼁lt xj􏼐 􏼑 − 􏽘

It can be seen that lt reflects the ability of the weak
classifier to classify samples belonging to class Gm(x) and
samples not belonging to class Gm(x), which ensures the
robustness of correct classification. For this paper, when
i � 1, 2, the rule of weight updating above is

Correspondingly, the weight coefficient αm of the pro-
portion of Gm(x) in the strong classifier is

*e traditional AdaBoost algorithm is a classification
problem of symmetric distribution of accuracy, that is, the
classification error rate of positive samples and the error rate
of negative samples are in a uniform and equal position
throughout the training process. However, the regional
electricity consumption data studied in this paper does not
conform to the above rules. For example, there is a big
difference in the variation of the relevant indicators of
electricity demand data and the relevant indicators of
electricity supply between regions, which makes the sample
set to excessively focus on a certain category after training,
thus leading to an increase in the error rate. In this section,
the classification performance of different types of samples is
used to adjust the specific weights of training samples on the
whole data set. When the weak classifier classifies the power
supply and demand relationship in a certain area correctly, lt
increases by 1. And, when the classification is wrong, lt
decreases by 1. *erefore, the imbalance of the classification
error ratio will affect the classification and its integration.
3.2. Bilateral Game Model Based on Incomplete Information.
Given the above research, we canmore accurately predict the
power supply and demand gap of each node on the
blockchain by AdaBoost algorithm. Based on the gap be-
tween supply and demand, power producers can make
decisions such as pricing and scheduling, energy storage
planning, and coordination and scheduling. According to
the characteristics of the distributed power generation,
power consumers can use electricity and sell electricity.
*ere are both competitive relations and cooperative rela-
tions among the trading entities in the power market, which
conforms to the basic setting of game theory. *erefore, this
section applies the incomplete information dynamic model
to the game between power producers and consumers.
Usually, the blockchain types in the power grid are
divided into public chain, alliance chain, and private chain
according to the target audience. Because the power system
is related to people’s livelihood and national security, the
blockchain of the power system is mainly aimed at large,
state-owned power service manufacturers, and has the
characteristics of partial decentralization. *erefore, this
section focuses on league chain. *ere are power supply side
and power demand side under the framework of alliance
chain.
3.2.1. ,e Profit Function of the Trading Entities. Based on
the AdaBoost algorithm, the gap between supply and de-
mand of power trading nodes is predicted. According to the
characteristics of the alliance chain, the information about
the gap is only known to the power market suppliers but not
to the demand side. *e trading rules in the power market
are as follows: after all buyers and sellers submit bids, the
market matches from the lowest selling price according to
the pricing rules, and the final successful matching price is
the market-clearing price. *erefore, the essence of the
power market transaction is the asymmetric information
game between the power supplier and the demand side,
Complexity 7
which is a process of mutual correlation and restriction of
bilateral income.
In the two-stage game, neither the supply side nor the
demand side knows the pricing strategy that the other side
may adopt. Since the supplier can predict the supply and
demand gap of a certain trading node, the supplier has the
first-mover pricing advantage in the first stage. After ob-
serving the pricing strategy proposed by the supplier, the
power consumers have two strategies: accepting prices or
not accepting prices. When the consumer refuses, the game
goes to the second stage; the consumer comes up with the
price plan first. Similarly, the supplier can choose to accept
or not to accept. If the supplier chooses to accept, the
transaction will be concluded. If the supplier chooses not to
accept, the transaction will be cancelled, and both parties
shall bear corresponding losses, respectively.
(1) *e profit function on the supply side
*e profit of the power supplier depends on the net
profit per unit and the amount of transaction. As-
suming that the transaction power Qs,t is the power
supply in time t, and ps,t is the price scheme provided
by the supplier, ct is the marginal power generation
cost of the power supplier. If the power demand is
equal to the power supply when the transaction is
concluded, and the consumer accepts the price of the
power supplier, then the power supplier’s profit
function Is,t is
Is,t � Qs,t ps,t − ct􏼐 􏼑. (15)
If the electricity consumers do not accept the sup-
plier’s price plan, then they will put forward their
own price pd,t in the second stage of the game. If the
supplier agrees with the scheme, then the transaction
is concluded. In this case, the profit function of the
power supplier Is,t is
Is,t � Qd,t pd,t − ct􏼐 􏼑. (16)
It is worth noting that the power supply side knows
the demand quantity of the demand side, so Qd,t �
Qs,t in the above equation. If the two parties do not
reach an agreement after the two-stage game, the
corresponding loss is to be borne by the power
supplier is Qs,tct.
(2) *e profit function on the demand side
*e demand-side profit function is similar to the
supply side return model. In the first stage, if the
transaction is concluded, that is, the consumer ac-
cepts the price scheme of the power supplier, where
the implied condition ispd,t >ps,t, then the corre-
sponding income is
Id,t � Qs,t pd,t − ps,t􏼐 􏼑 + R ps,t􏼐 􏼑, (17)
where R(ps,t) is the income after electricity purchase,
and R> 0, R′ < 0. If the power consumers do not
accept the supplier’s price scheme, they will put
forward their own price pd,t in the second stage of
the game, where the implicit condition is pd,t <ps,t. If
the supplier agrees with the scheme, then the
transaction is concluded. And, the profit function of
the power demand side is
Id,t � R pd,t􏼐 􏼑. (18)
If the two parties do not reach an agreement after the
two-stage game, the corresponding loss is to be
borne by the power demander is R(pd,t).
3.2.2. Solution of Bilateral Game Decision Model Based on
Nash Equilibrium. *e game describes the decision-making
process of two or more players pursuing their respective
goals. *e four elements of game are decision-maker,
strategy, payment function, and equilibrium solution. Nash
equilibrium also provides decision-makers with the con-
sistent prediction of the possible outcome of the game, that
is, the optimal decision result of rational decision-makers,
thus pointing out the direction of strategy making.
In any game model, the existence of Nash equilibrium is
particularly important. When the game strategy is a non-
empty, bounded convex set in the Euclidean space, the
reward function is continuous and upper quasi-convex in
the sub-strategy space. In this case, the game model has pure
strategy Nash equilibrium. For the game model studied in
this section, the strategy space of bilateral games obviously
satisfies the characteristics of nonempty, bounded, and
convex sets. And, because the pricing strategy is continuous,
the profit function is also continuous, and satisfies the upper
convex condition that the first derivative is not zero and the
second derivative is not less than zero. *erefore, the two-
sided game model considered in this section has Nash
equilibrium solution.
Suppose the set of decision makers is P1, P2, . . . , Pn􏼈 􏼉,
the set of adopted policies is S1, S2, . . . , Sn􏼈 􏼉, and the cor-
responding set of payment functions is I1, I2, . . . , I3􏼈 􏼉, where
n is the number of participants. *is section only involves
the supply side and the demand side of the power market, so
we denote the set of decision-makers as Ps, Pd􏼈 􏼉, where Ps
represents the power supply side and Pd represents the
power demand side.*e payment function of the two sides is
Is, Id􏼈 􏼉. *e supply side and the demand side need to de-
termine their respective power purchase price in two stages,
and the set of strategies is ps, pd􏼈 􏼉.
*e equilibrium equation is as follows, where p∗s and p∗d
represent the final Nash equilibrium solution respectively.
For the power supplier, given the optimal pricing strategy p∗d
of the demander, the power supplier chooses the optimal
pricing p∗s to maximize their profits. Similarly, for the power
supplier, given that the optimal price of the supply side is p∗s ,
the optimal pricing of consumers maximizing their profits is
p∗d :

8 Complexity
Based on the above analysis, in the two-stage game
model, the backward method is usually used to solve out the
Nash equilibrium. *e specific steps are as follows:
Step 1: establish the framework of two-stage game
model, and define the strategy space and reward
function of power supplier and demander in each stage.
Step 2: starting from the second stage, the power de-
mander Pd formulates the price plan, and Pd needs to
compare the profit function of Ps under two states of
agreeing to the price plan and disagreeing to the price
plan. *erefore, the optimal price p∗s is obtained when
the payment under the two states is equal.
Step 3: discount the payment of both parties in the
second period to the first period. Similarly, when the
power supplier Ps makes the price plan, Ps needs to
compare the profit function under the two states of Pd
agreeing to the price plan and disagreeing to the price
plan. *erefore, the optimal price p∗d is obtained when
the payment under the two states is equal.
4. Example Analysis
4.1. Forecast Power Supply and Demand Gap. *is section
takes the electricity market data of the PJM market in the
United States as an example, and the time-segment data of 9
regions from July 29th to 30th, 2020, are selected to forecast
the power supply and demand gap. Electrical load measures
the sum of the electrical power taken from the electrical
equipment of the power users to the power system at a
certain time. *e PJM data provide the actual and predicted
electrical loads. If the real power load is greater than the
predicted value, the power demand will be greater than the
supply, and the power supply and demand gap will be
negative. If the real power load is less than the predicted
value, the power demand will be less than the supply, and the
power supply and demand gap will be positive. Take a certain
period on July 30, 2020, as an example. And the S&D gap are
shown in Table 1.
Combined with the calculation rules of the S&D gap in
the theoretical model, we can use the Ababoost algorithm to
predict the S&D gap in the region. Take the voltage, system
energy price, actual regional marginal price, peak price, and
marginal loss price of the region as input index xi in the
sample set, and the S&D gap as output index yi in the sample
set, and make the following provisions: if the S&D gap is
positive, it is represented by the categorical variable +1, and
vice versa.*e sample interval is from 0 : 00 to 12 : 00 on July
30, 2020. *e data sets required in this experiment are
summarized in Table 2.
After calculation, when we use the actual regional
marginal electricity price as the input indicator, the sample
weight is [0.1, 0.125, 0.125, 0.1, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125, 0.1, 0.1,
0.1, 0.1], the optimal classification threshold is 0.5, the error
rate is 0.5, and the predicted value of the output index is [1,
−1, −1, −1, −1, −1, sum −1, −1, −1, −1, −1, −1, −1, −1]. When
the peak electricity price is used as the input index, the
sample weight is [0.08, 0.125, 0.125, 0.104, 0.125, 0.125, 0.104,
0.104, 0.1], the optimal classification threshold is 3.5, the
error rate is 0.4, and the predicted value of the output index
is [−1, −1, −1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. When the marginal loss price is used
as the input index, the sample weight is [0.119, 0.132, 0.105,
0.095, 0.132, 0.132, 0.095, 0.095, 0.095], the optimal classi-
fication threshold is 1.5, the error rate is 0.475, and the
predicted value of the output index is [−1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1]. It can be seen that the error rate of taking peak
electricity price as input index is the lowest.
4.2.OptimalPricing Strategy. *is section uses the electricity
market data of the US PJM market on July 30, 2020, for
empirical demonstration. *e profit function of the elec-
tricity supplier involves transaction power, transaction price,
and power generation cost. Generally, the transaction power
can be used as a function of the transaction price, that is,
Q(p). For easy calculation, let Q(p) � a − bp. According to
the sample data, ps ∈ [16.51, 25.34] and pd ∈ [16.51, 25.34],
where the measuring unit of ps and pd is USD/KWH.
Using the backward method, the profit function of the
power demander in the second stage is
Id � (a − bpd)(pd − p∗s ) + R(pd). *e first-order condition
can be obtained as a − 2bpd + bpdp∗s + R′(pd) � 0. *ere-
fore, the optimal pricing of the power demander is

5. Conclusions
Power trading system is a nonlinear complex system, which
has huge functions and complex business, and involves
various types of data and huge amount of data. And, part of
the business data in the power trading system need to in-
teract with many external business systems, but the security
of the data and the reliability of the transaction cannot be
guaranteed. So, it needs to be addressed specifically.*e core
technology of a distributed power trading system based on
blockchain technology is to achieve real-time power balance
and provide preconditions for smart contracts, which en-
sures the reliability of power trading and data security. Using
historical information of transaction nodes to build models
that predict the relationship between power supply and
demand and provide decision-making information for
power suppliers is the fundamental way to optimize
transaction efficiency. *is paper expands the relevant re-
search on the application of blockchain technology in the
field of energy system. *e algorithm is innovatively im-
proved to adapt to the data evolution characteristics of the
distributed power system. In this paper, the improved
Adaboost algorithm is used to predict the supply and de-
mand gap of power trading nodes, and then the prediction
ability of the algorithm is tested by the time-sharing data of 9
randomly selected regions of the PJM market in the United
States. Specifically, the input indicators in the sample set are
the region’s voltage, system energy price, actual regional
marginal electricity price, peak electricity price, and mar-
ginal loss price, and the output indicator of the sample set is
the direction of the supply and demand gap. *e peak
electricity price can be obtained by the AdaBoost algorithm
as the input indicator with the smallest error rate. *e
characteristics of general information asymmetry in the
power market are fully considered when analyzing the
formation of power price, so that the price of the distributed
power system is more consistent with the market reality.
Secondly, the essence of the power market transaction is the
asymmetric information game between the power supplier
and the demander because the information on the block-
chain is only known to the power supplier. A two-stage game
model is constructed in this paper to describe the price
competition strategy between the power supplier and the
power demander. *e Nash equilibrium solution of the first
stage and the second stage of the model can be obtained by
the backward method, so that the decision-making opti-
mization of the distributed power transaction under the
blockchain framework is realized. Finally, the applicability of
the model is verified by using the data of electricity market in
the United States.
