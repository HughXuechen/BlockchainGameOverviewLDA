Abstract
Decentralised gambling applications are a new way for people to gamble online. Decentra-
lised gambling applications are distinguished from traditional online casinos in that players
use cryptocurrency as a stake. Also, rather than being stored on a single centralised server,
decentralised gambling applications are stored on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain. Previous
work in the player behaviour tracking literature has examined the spending profiles of gam-
blers on traditional online casinos. However, similar work has not taken place in the decen-
tralised gambling domain. The profile of gamblers on decentralised gambling applications
are therefore unknown. This paper explores 2,232,741 transactions from 24,234 unique
addresses to three such applications operating atop the Ethereum cryptocurrency network
over 583 days. We present spending profiles across these applications, providing the first
detailed summary of spending behaviours in this technologically advanced domain. We find
that the typical player spends approximately $110 equivalent across a median of 6 bets in a
single day, although heavily involved bettors spend approximately $100,000 equivalent over
a median of 644 bets across 35 days. Our findings suggest that the average decentralised
gambling application player spends less than in other online casinos overall, but that the
most heavily involved players in this new domain spend substantially more. This study also
demonstrates the use of these applications as a research platform, specifically for large
scale longitudinal in-vivo data analysis.
Introduction
Decentralised gambling applications are a new form of online gambling which use cryptocur-
rency technology to process payments and calculate game outcomes [1]. These applications
vary in terms of the games they provide, and the cryptocurrencies they use. This work focuses
on simple casino type games of chance, like dice rolls and coin flips, available through several
applications operating atop the Ethereum cryptocurrency network. The Ethereum network is
the oldest and most popular by market capitalisation of cryptocurrency networks which explic-
itly support smart contracts (see https://www.coinbase.com/, accessed 12/11/2019). These con-
tracts, which are computer programs, are the core technology enabling these applications [2].

Understanding the behaviours of users of these applications is important for understanding
how this technology is affecting the public in comparison with existing online gambling plat-
forms [3]. It is also important for understanding the prevalence of patterns of problematic
spending [4] among its users. No existing work has contributed to understanding decentra-
lised gambling application players using their transaction data. This work begins addressing
this gap in the literature by analysing three such applications operating atop the Ethereum net-
work. We begin by briefly describing relevant existing work in this domain.
Background
Player behaviour tracking is a subset of gambling research which aims to better understand
how people gamble using actual betting data. Historically, this field has been limited by the
availability of large scale, real-life observational data [5] given its commercial sensitivity and
personal nature. On top of this, many existing studies have only had access to daily aggregate
data, as opposed to individual transaction level data. This means that although methods do
exist specific to more granular data, for example Fiedler’s work on poker play [6], little exists
specific to casino game play. The use of cryptocurrencies for gambling challenges this status
quo, offering data access at previously inconceivable granularity. This access invites analysis of
player spending in this new domain, as this paper explores.
All transactions of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are recorded on public
ledgers known as blockchains. Decentralised gambling applications involve the wagering of
cryptocurrencies. When individuals place wagers using a decentralised gambling application,
their transactions are therefore recorded on these public ledgers. This means every transaction
to and from these applications is publicly available. This represents a paradigm shift in terms
of data availability for gambling researchers, and invites a new branch of player behaviour
tracking research focused on the use of this data for understanding player spending. Further-
more, the psuedo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions means the data is publicly
available in an already anonymised form, mitigating many of the limitations associated with
the use of personally identifiable information for academic research. These factors, public
availability and pre-anonymisation, mean decentralised gambling applications may find use at
the heart of data-driven gambling research in the future, over industry collaborations com-
monly found in existing literature [5, 7].
Existing work on decentralised (gambling) applications of any kind has been limited [7, 8].
Early work by Gainsbury [1] describes their existence and potential to revolutionise the provi-
sion of gambling services online. However, little has been done to capitalise on their data trans-
parency and public availability described above. Literature on the analysis of cryptocurrency
transactions in general terms has also been sparse, with none to the authors’ knowledge explor-
ing their use for gambling research specifically. This paper is the first to explore such applica-
tions through the lens of gambling studies, using established methods to examine player
spending.
Literature exploring the use of online gambling transaction data for gambling research
however, does exist [5], and provides a foundation upon which methods of exploration can be
built. A collection of behavioural measures have been described by the first series of papers to
explore online gambling. This began with LaBrie et al.’s 2007 study on the gambling behav-
iours of sports bettors [9]. In this study, temporally oriented measures such as duration and
frequency of play, financially oriented measures such as mean bet size and total expenditure,
and loss oriented measures like net loss and percentage loss (of total amount wagered) were
calculated. They found, using descriptive statistics across cohorts of players, that differences in
behavioural measures between cohorts existed, and that an empirically determined group of

heavy bettors spent more, and more frequently, across both fixed odds and live action betting.
In a similar vein, a further paper by LaPlante et al. explored the individual behaviours of poker
players, again calculating behavioural measures using their transaction data [10]. Presenting
descriptive statistics in a similar way, they were able to provide a baseline further researchers
such as Fiedler [11] could build upon, extending our knowledge of online gambling in general,
and in this case poker play in particular. Finally, and most relevantly, LaBrie et al. computed
identical measures to their earlier paper [9], instead applying them to casino game players.
Once again, differences were found between cohorts of players using an empirically deter-
mined split (95%:5% by total amount wagered), laying a foundation for developing an under-
standing of gambling behaviour in a previously unknown domain.
As noted earlier in this section, prior work has established baseline measurements of vari-
ous behavioural factors in domains as diverse as poker play and sports betting. However, no
such quantification of player behaviour in the crypto-gambling domain exists. Replicating this
analysis on new cryptocurrency data would help establish a baseline from which further
research could be conducted, and offer novel insights into player behaviours in this technolog-
ically sophisticated domain. This also addresses several recent reviews which have called for
work to develop our understanding of the use of new technologies for gambling [5, 12].
Finally, work applying more advanced analytical tools to player transaction data, such as
Percy et al.’s use of supervised machine learning models [13] to predict self-exclusion, and Phi-
lander’s exploration of data mining procedures [14] to identify high-risk gamblers, each build
on the measures calculated in the papers described in this section. Establishing a descriptive
baseline is therefore an important first step in the development of more advanced analytical
algorithms.
Hypotheses
Previous work on the analysis of in vivo gambling transactions has varied between game type
and cohort characteristics [5]. As none have focused on the use of decentralised applications
for gambling of any kind—except work by Gainsbury [1], which used high level usage statistics
—we expect to find gambling behaviours consistent with analyses on casino game players
whose gameplay is most similar to that of the applications described in detail below. We
include a table from one such study by Labrie et al [9] in the appendix for quick comparison.
Secondly, we do not expect the data gathered directly from the Ethereum cryptocurrency net-
work to be usable for player behaviour research without first applying some data cleaning
methods. Of highest importance is the potential for the presence of non-human players,
known as bots, in the data set. Bots may exist here for a number of reasons—for example, to
artificially inflate the perceived popularity of the applications they are transacting with, or to
attempt to win the jackpot from an application once it becomes statistically worthwhile to pur-
sue. We cannot infer the reasoning behind bots’ existence, but can build evidence to identify
their presence by assessing how much typical ‘player’ behaviour from each game deviates from
those of other similar games.
Present study
This work describes the behaviour of a large cohort of decentralised gambling application
users over a 583 day period, spanning from the creation of each application’s smart contracts
up until the 9th March 2020 (see Figs 1 and 2). By using cryptocurrency transaction data gath-
ered directly from the Ethereum cryptocurrency blockchain we are able to calculate beha-
vioural measures using individual bet level data as opposed to aggregates of any kind, e.g.
daily/weekly. Behavioural measures, including descriptions of the typical (median) player of

each of the games available through each of the applications is described. We perform four dis-
tinct analyses following identification of likely non-human players: (i) a statistical comparison
between human and bot players’ behavioural measures; (ii) an epidemiological description of
the gambling behaviour of (human) players of decentralised gambling applications; (iii) a sta-
tistical assessment of the relationships between existing behavioural measures of players in this
new domain, and (iv) an epidemiological description of the gambling behaviours of empiri-
cally-determined heavily involved players as found in LaBrie et al.’s original work [4].

at the University of York, application reference: Scholten021219.
Data sample
Data gathered for this study includes transactions to and from three decentralised gambling
applications operating atop the Ethereum cryptocurrency network. These applications were
selected based both on their rank on an officially recognised application ranking service Sta-
teOfTheDApps, available at https://stateofthedapps.com, and on the subjective technical sim-
plicity of their smart contracts. This simplicity is dependent on the author’s understanding of
the Solidity programming language, as encoded transactions to these contracts require decod-
ing in order to extract the sizes of bets and player outcome selections. A deeper understanding
of the language these contracts are written in would increase the number of applications that
could be analysed. However, given the youth of this technology, our goal here is to first under-
stand a small sample.

The first such application is Etheroll, described as ‘an Ethereum smart contract for placing
bets on [a] provably-fair dice game using Ether with no deposits or sign-ups. Each dice roll is
provably random and cryptographically secure thanks to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain’
(description taken from https://etheroll.com/#/about). The second application is Dice2Win,
which offers both single and double dice rolls, coin flips, and 1-100 rolls, all through a smart
contract in the same way as the Etheroll application. Finally, the FCK application offered a col-
lection of simple casino games such as roulette, guess-the-suit, guess-the-number, etc. The
FCK application ceased operation on the 8th July 2019, yet with 349,195 transactions since its
creation (December 10th 2018) it provides substantial data for the present study, and imple-
ments a (technically) simple contract in terms of transaction decoding. The Ethereum smart
contract addresses associated with each of these applications at the time of data gathering are
presented in Table 1. Summary statistics of the data collected from these applications is pre-
sented in Table 2.
Data cleaning
Transactions to and from the contracts associated with each of the applications, gathered from
the start of their operations until 9th March 2020 (see Fig 2), yield a total of 2,232,741 bets orig-
inating from 24,234 unique addresses. Of these addresses, 14,466 transacted with the FCK
application, a further 7,868 with the Dice2Win application, and a final 3,086 with the Etheroll
application (see Fig 1). Fig 3 plots the cumulative value of the bets placed both in each applica-
tion alone, and combined across the duration of this study.
The transaction data for each of these applications was gathered using the Etherscan API,
which offers an interface through which transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can be
directly inspected. The Etherscan API can be found at https://etherscan.io.
As the raw dataset is publicly available via the Ethereum blockchain, the data repository
associated with this work contains the matched bets used to calculate the measures below in an
accessible format (CSV). This data includes the hashes (unique identifiers) of both the bet
placement and payout transactions such that the sums of the costs to and from each unique

Measures
The psuedo-anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency transactions from which the present
data set was drawn mean that no demographic information such as age, gender, or income, is
available for any of the unique cryptocurrency addresses in the set. As such, no demographic
analysis was possible—this aligns with existing literature where demographic data was not
found to be of particular interest in comparison to behavioural measures based on the transac-
tion data alone [9].
The variables computed as part of this study are based on those calculated by LaBrie et al.’s
seminal investigation into internet casino games. These include the duration of betting, which
is calculated as the time elapsed (in days) between the placement of the first bet and the place-
ment of the last. This is rounded up to the nearest day in cases where bets were made across a
midnight boundary, for example, the placement of bets both at 22:00 on a given day and again
at 09:00 on the following day, are counted as having a duration of two days even though they
are within 24 hours of one another. Using this we could compute the frequency of betting
activity by taking the total number of days in which one or more bets was placed and dividing
it by the duration of betting. This yields a percentage, with value of 100% equating to betting
every day for the known duration of the use of the decentralised gambling application.
As in the original work, we calculated the average bets per day by dividing the total number
of bets made by each player, by the total number of days on which a bet was placed (as used
when computing the frequency above). The total amount wagered (in ETH) for each player is
also retrieved, along with the total losses they incurred (also in ETH), from which their net loss
is calculated. Finally, the percentage loss for each player is determined by dividing the net loss
by the total amount wagered, and multiplying by 100. As in LaBrie et al.’s original work, the
large sample size (n = 23,365) of the players of the three decentralised gambling applications
gathered in this work mean that the practical significance of any statistical differences between
any of the measures calculated may be limited.
In order to promote reproducibility in our work, and to encourage further studies in this
domain, the code used to calculate these measures across each of the unique addresses is

Results
Non-human players
Before presenting descriptive statistics for cryptocurrency gamblers, we must first ensure that
the transactions used originate from human players. Given the lack of established methods in
making this distinction, a naïve approach, inspired by LaPlante et al.’s use of the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test [10], is to quantify the differences between the distributions of each of the beha-
vioural measures for players across each of the games. We reason that if the majority of unique
addresses’ transactions originate from human players, collections of addresses transactions’
which deviate significantly from this norm may be non-human in origin. This reasoning finds
support in the fictitious scenario where an auto-betting algorithm with few parameters is used
by many accounts, as this would create groups of behaviourally similar transaction sequences
which would stand out. Fig 4 illustrates this theory, with a smaller peak indicating human play-
ers in a population with non-human players, and a second peak indicating non-human player
behaviours.
To this end, we first split the collection of all gathered transactions by application, and then
again by game. This resulted in 9 distinct transaction sets, each for a single application-game
combination—for example; coin-flip players on the dice2.win application, two-dice players on
the fck.com application, etc. The dice2.win and fck.com applications each offer 4 games, plus
etheroll.com’s 1-100 roll, yields 9 different games in total. From here, a two sample Kolmogo-
rov-Smirnov test (K-S II)—which quantifies the likelihood that two samples have been drawn
from the same distribution—was computed for each pair of measures, across each of the applica-
tions. This resulted in a 9x9x8 matrix of coefficients, with axes; application-game combinations
(9), application-game combinations again (9), and behavioural measures (8). Algorithm 1 shows
the design of this pairwise behavioural measure comparison, a Python implementation of which
is available at www.gamba.dev. It should be noted that performing this many K-S II tests without
correction limits their individual descriptive power. That considered, the uncorrected coeffi-
cients of these tests can still be used to broadly assess differences between the distributions.

Table 3 shows a single slice of this coefficient matrix corresponding to the behavioural mea-
sure of duration for each application-game combination described in Fig 1. From this slice
alone it is clear that the coin-flip game on the fck.com application stands out against almost all
others in terms of the size of the K-S II coefficient. Following the scipy library’s description of
the K-S II test; if the K-S statistic is small or the p-value is high, then we cannot reject the hypoth-
esis that the distributions of the two samples are the same, it is likely that players of the fck.com
coin-flip game are not similar to those of almost any other game. It is therefore possible that if
the players of the other games are human, then fck.com coin-flip players are not. The results of
these tests across each of the behavioural measures in the matrix appears to indicate non-zero
differences between the fck.com coin-flip players against players of all other provider-game
combinations. Add to this that the fck.com coin-flip game amassed 13,877 unique players over
it’s lifespan of 209 days compared to 567, 293, and 396 players among its other three games, it
appears unlikely that the majority of transactions to this game are human in origin.

The two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results between the dice2win coin flip players
and the fck.com double dice players are also higher than any other non fck.com pair. Yet with
no other pairs indicating distributional differences with this group this may be an artefact of
the choice of game, or may be coincidental given the number of tests conducted. In each case,
this anomaly invites further exploration but is considered out of scope of the present study.
Under the assumption that each of the remaining provider-game pairs’ transactions origi-
nate from human players—which we found no evidence to refute—we discarded the fck.com
coin-flip transactions. This left 8 application-game combinations of interest, whose 10,357
unique players’ behavioural measures—using 1,743,478 transactions—were combined into a
single data set, as performed in existing work in gambling behaviour analysis. A graphical
breakdown of these application-game combinations is provided in Fig 1. As with the matched
transactions described above, the table of behavioural measures calculated for each unique
address in this study is available through https://osf.io/8bfyj/.
Cryptocurrency gambling behaviours
Table 4 presents the behavioural measures described in the Measures section above for the
cohort of players in the remaining transaction set. The majority of the measures have heavily
skewed distributions, which limits the descriptive power of the parametric statistics presented.
This table therefore extends LaBrie et al.’s original metrics [3] by including the inter-quartile
ranges of each of the measures, plus the coefficients of a one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
for normality as reported by LaPlante et al. [10].
We find that with a median duration of 1 day and frequency of 100%, the typical player of
decentralised gambling applications bets in a non-commital, and non-intense way. This con-
trasts LaBrie et al’s original findings on regular casino players, who with a median duration of
246 days and frequency of 7% bet across a much longer term. This contrast may be explained
in part by the youth of the applications studied here. Add to this a median bet count of 11 and
we may assume that this typical player would play for one short session on a single application
and then cease play or move to another application. This considered, the inter-quartile range
for the duration indicates a portion of players remaining engaged for over a week of play.
Combine this with the inter-quartile ranges for both the frequency and number of bets mea-
sures and we observe a wide range of possible behaviours between the 25th and 75th percen-
tiles of the sample, across the measures calculated. This sentiment is shared in the number of
bets placed per betting day, which, with a median of 6 and IQR of 21, encapsulates a wide
range of possible behaviours for the majority of the sample.

The top four behavioural measures also present the highest one sample K-S test statistics of
all of the measures. This is most likely an artefact of the heavily skewed nature of these mea-
sures, with thorough investigations of outliers across each measure representing an interesting
area of future work.
The financially oriented measures, including the ETH per bet and the total amount wagered
show similar oddities to the results regarding duration and frequency. With a median bet size
in ETH of 0.11 (approximately equivalent to $14, see https://www.coinbase.com/price/
ethereum for exchange rate data used throughout this work) and total amount wagered of 1.40
ETH (approximately $200), the typical player’s spending is high considering the short duration
of play. The granular and longitudinal nature of the transaction data prepared as part of this
work mean that questions surrounding this behaviour can be explored in greater detail in fur-
ther work, but are not expanded upon here.
The most comparable measure presented here with other gambling activities is the net and
percentage loss measures, which with median values of 0.04 (ETH) and 5.3% respectively indi-
cate modest losses for the typical player. As with other financially oriented measures, when
framed in terms of the median duration this equates to a loss of 5.3% of the total amount bet
per day.
Unlike the top four measures presented, the financially oriented measures do not present
such high K-S test statistics, so are likely drawn from less extreme distributions. That consid-
ered, with test statistics of 0.504, the ETH per bet and total amount wagered measures still can-
not be effectively described using parametric methods. As such, the means and standard
deviations for each of the measures are reported in line with existing literature, but in this
domain do little to develop our understanding of typical transactional behaviour.
Relationships between behaviours
As with previous work exploring the behavioural measures used in this work [9, 10], heavily
non-normal distributions mean that rank-order correlations are preferred over their paramet-
ric equivalents. Table 5 presents Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients between all of
the behavioural measures calculated for players of all games combined, excluding the fck.com
application’s coin-flip players.
Of particular interest in these coefficients are those of substantial magnitude, as highlighted.
We find that, as expected, frequency is negatively correlated with duration—this makes sense
as given a larger number of possible days on which to place a bet, the probability of a player
not placing one on a given day naturally increases. The measure of duration does not appear

substantially correlated with any remaining measures, with moderate values for both number
of bets and total amount wagered. These each loosely support notions that the longer an indi-
vidual uses a decentralised gambling application, the more bets they will place and the greater
their total amount wagered will become. These each also make logical sense in the context of
the gambling games these applications present.
Apart from its correlation with duration, the measure of frequency does not appear to relate
to any other measures in any substantial way. With a coefficient of 0.46, its correlation with
the number of bets an individual makes also makes intuitive sense. The more frequently a
player places bets, the more bets they are likely to place over their gameplay career.
The number of bets appears strongly correlated to both the number of bets per day and the
total amount wagered for users of decentralised gambling applications. With a coefficient of
0.93—the strongest of all pairs—it is clear that the number of bets an individual places over
their duration of play directly relates to the number of bets they are likely to place on a given
day. The number of bets measure also relates strongly (0.84) to the total amount wagered.
Unsurprisingly, the number of bets an individual places on a given day is also strongly corre-
lated (0.78) with their total amount wagered. As with other relationships between measures,
this makes intuitive sense in the context of gambling games but nonetheless contributes to
establishing a baseline for human players of such games.
The final coefficient of interest, and that of most potential scientific significance, is that
between the ETH per bet and the total amount wagered. With a reported coefficient of 0.78,
our results suggest that those who place larger bets are more likely to wager larger total
amounts over the duration of their betting careers. The implications of this finding are
deferred to the discussion. However, this appears to suggest that this measure may be an
important predictive indicator in the cryptocurrency domain. It may assist in terms of identi-
fying the potential for financial harm via unsustainable spending among players—a finding in
line with existing work in player behaviour tracking research [5].
Both the measures of net loss and percent loss do not appear meaningful in relation to the
other measures reported in this work, so will not be discussed in detail. We now move on to
report descriptive statistics regarding the most heavily involved bettors in the data set, and
contrast them to the majority of low and moderately involved bettors.
Heavily involved bettors
Heavy involvement by any of the behavioural measures used here may be detrimental to the
individuals affected. For example, those most heavily involved in terms of the duration of their
play will naturally have less time for other commitments, or those with large net losses may
face financial repercussions should their income not support such expenditure. We explore
heavy involvement with respect to total wagered, as it has the most obvious financial repercus-
sions for the individuals in the cohort. This follows LaBrie et al.’s rationale for exploring the
same measure in a cohort of casino gamblers. We include LaBrie et al’s original figures for
quick comparison in S1 Table, although such comparisons are heavily nuanced given the dif-
ferences between decentralised and regular online casinos.
Table 6 presents each of the descriptive statistics for each of the behavioural measures, for
both the top 5% most heavily involved bettors by total wagered, and the remaining 95% of the
sample. Parametric statistics for both cohorts are not reported given their heavily skewed
nature as described in the previous section.
Our results begin with substantial differences in the typical duration of play between those
most heavily involved and the remaining 95% of the sample. Whilst the typical player in the
majority only plays for a single day, placing approximately 9 bets in total, the typical heavily

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240693 October 28, 2020 11 / 18
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240693
involved bettor plays for over one month, placing over 600 bets. Furthermore, the typical
heavily involved bettor appears to spread these bets over the month, betting approximately
every other day, just under 70 times. The difference between the typical bets per day multiplied
by the typical number of betting days per month (70×15 = 1050), and the typical number of
bets alone (644), indicates a difference in the range of behaviours these players are exhibiting.
Exploring these differences represents a key area of future work.
Each of the bets of the typical heavily involved bettor are also not insignificant in size, being
almost 20 times higher than the typical player in the majority of the sample—a median 1.84
ETH (roughly $200) compared to 0.1 ETH (roughly $10). The most dramatic difference, and
most concerning for the players affected, is the difference between the median total amount
wagered between the most heavily involved bettors and the remaining players. With a median
of almost 1,000 ETH (equivalent to approximately $100,000), it dwarfs the median 1.1 ETH
$110) presented by the majority of bettors. This proportional difference is consistent with LaB-
rie et al’s original study on regular online casino gamblers (see S1 Table), but appears to ampli-
fied in decentralised gambling application use. This difference of an almost 1000× greater total
amount typically wagered by heavily involved players compared to the majority of players is a
key finding of this work.
As with the behavioural measures reported for the entire sample in Table 4, the inter-quar-
tile ranges of each of the measures leaves a wide range of potential transaction behaviours for
those in the top 5%. This includes the duration measure, with players engaging with the decen-
tralised gambling applications across a range of over 35 ± 120 days or more. This holds for the
frequencies, with some heavily involved players betting every day throughout the duration of
use, and some betting only a few times with large wagers. Most varied in terms of non-finan-
cially oriented measures is the number of bets placed, which presents an inter-quartile range of
over 1,600 for the top 5% compared to 47 for the majority. This is of particular interest regard-
ing the use of this data for transaction pattern analysis, a potentially fruitful area of research
extending this work, and discussed in more detail below. With so comparatively few transac-
tions made by the majority of players, further studies using this data should use behavioural
measures which account for this difference.
Other widely varying measures include the total amounts wagered and the net loss. The
median values of total amount wagered are 986 and 1.1 with inter-quartile ranges of 1759 and
11 respectively between cohorts. Net loss shows similar ranges with medians of 10.3 and 0.04
with inter-quartile ranges of 103 and 58 respectively. This develops the previous finding that
among the top 5% of most heavily involved players, a wide range of potential patterns exist,

confirming the existing idea that there is no single behaviour indicative of heavy involvement,
rather a spectrum of potential patterns and behaviours which each result in large total
expenditures.
Lastly, with respect to the descriptive statistics presented, the percent loss between the most
heavily involved players and the majority presents a counter-intuitive result. With a larger
total amount wagered, the losses one may anticipate for the typical heavily involved individual
would be high, although, in decentralised gambling applications it appears to be the opposite.
With a median percent loss of just 0.9 and an inter-quartile range of 7.6, the typical heavily
involved bettor does not appear to lose the amount they wager in as varied a fashion as the
other 95% of the sample. These values align with Labrie et al’s original work, which also reports
lower percent losses for heavily involved bettors (2.5%) than for the majority of the population
(5.9%). This may be an artefact of the provable fairness of these games as described in the Data
Sample section above, where players can be certain of the amount the ‘house’ is taking from
each bet, or it may be a result of extensive repeated play, where the range of potential losses is
effectively smoothed by the larger sample available for each player. In the case of the majority
of players, a median percent loss of 6.6 and inter-quartile range of 57.6, suggests large relative
wins and losses for the relatively small bets they place. This finding differs from the original
work, but makes logical sense given the non-commital and non-intense behaviours described
above for the typical player of decentralised gambling applications.
The one sample K-S statistics reported for the behavioural measures of the heavily involved
portion of players and the remaining 95% indicate several measures of interest for future
work. Specifically, the differences between the first four measures (duration, frequency, bet
count, and bets per day) do not appear substantially different from one another. The differ-
ences in distributions between the total amounts wagered however are vastly different, with a
coefficient of 1.00 (to 2 decimal places) for heavily involved bettors compared to 0.50 for the
majority. This may be a fruitful area of further exploration, as the underlying distributional dif-
ferences for these measures may be used in conjunction with other measures to predict heavy
involvement.
Discussion
This study presents the first ever analysis of decentralised gambling transactions on the Ether-
eum blockchain. Decentralised gambling, and the contract components of their architectures,
present significant regulatory challenges [1], whilst simultaneously offering rich transaction
level data for research. Whist this transaction level data exists in large quantities, we have
shown that the entire set is not immediately useful for research given the likely presence of
non-human players. This means that although a large, publicly available, in-vivo data source
for player behaviour research has emerged, scholars must take care when using it to solve exist-
ing problems, especially when exploring issues around disordered transaction patterns and
player behaviour clustering.
Non-human players in decentralised gambling applications
Our first distinct analysis involved employing statistical tests to detect differences between
transactions of (likely) human and non-human origin. To this end, we found that performing
two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between behavioural measures, and between games
provided by decentralised gambling applications, can be effective for detecting the presence of
players whose transactions stand out against those in other games. This simple method invites
improvements, but shows that relying on distributional differences between human and non-
human players is enough for meaningful distinction at this early stage.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240693
Importantly, we hold the assumption that of the nine application-game combinations we
explored, the one that stands out as different is not being transacted with by human players, as
opposed to the other way around. Under this assumption, we may suggest that the reason it
differs so substantially from others is that the majority of the players are in fact not human, but
instead are cryptocurrency spending/betting algorithms designed to transact with the applica-
tion, potentially to inflate perceived popularity. Exploring motivations behind algorithmic
trading with these applications presents an interesting but tangentially related area of future
work.
Cryptocurrency gamblers and behavioural relationships
The second and third analyses described in the Present Study section above aimed to describe
the gambling behaviours of users of decentralised gambling applications, and assess the rela-
tionships between these measures. Our results suggest, as with similar existing work, that the
distributions of all behavioural measures are significantly skewed, and therefore benefit from
the application of non-parametric statistics. Applying such statistics, and without break-ing
down the sample of players into meaningful sub-samples, the typical user of decentralised
gambling applications does not appear to be heavily involved, and does not appear to place a
substantial number of high of bets. However, this description fails to capture the most impor-
tant aspect of the findings in this study, which are that those most heavily involved in the use
of decentralised gambling applications appear to spend significantly more than both the
majority of the population, and more than heavily involved gamblers in other types of online
gambling. Exploring this relationship further and breaking down differences in terms of the
behavioural measures calculated for each player, presents a fruitful area of further work if find-
ings building on previous studies are to be translated to this new domain.
Furthermore, this study’s design draws heavy inspiration from early work describing online
casino game players. The data available to the original researchers took a daily aggregate form.
This means that the behavioural measures they devised to describe cohorts of players perhaps
do not capture the depth of insight available when using individual transaction level data as
available via cryptocurrency transactions. There may therefore be behavioural measures which
appear inaccessible at the daily aggregate level, such as average gambling session length or
average rate of spending. To the author’s knowledge, studies in the field of player behaviour
tracking have not yet explored such granular measures, nor applied them to data sets across
different types of online gambling. That considered, measure-oriented work such as Kainulai-
nen’s [15], which describes a new measure of risk taking specific to gambling, presents the
opportunity to apply new techniques to gain deeper insight on player behaviours.
Heavily involved cohort characteristics
Our final analysis aimed to provide an epidemiological description of the gambling behaviours
of an empirically determined group of heavily involved gamblers. The results regarding this
cohort of players, identified as heavily involved by total amount wagered, suggest a number of
important discoveries. Firstly, although the typical heavily involved player spends the equiva-
lent of over $120,000 during a 35 day period, the losses they typically incur as a percentage of
their amount wagered are under 1%. This means that although their expenses dwarf the major-
ity of players by over 1000×, they do not appear to be losing as much proportionally as the
majority of players, who, when placing approximately $105 worth of bets in total over a one
day period typically lose under 6%, or $7. It is important to note that this difference in losses
between heavily and non-heavily involved players is not unique to decentralised gambling
applications, as evidenced by LaBrie et al’s original findings (S1 Table).
PLOS ONE Inside the decentralised casino

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240693
Another important result of the analysis regarding heavily involved bettors is the typical dif-
ference in bet size, with heavily involved players wagering just under 20× more than their low
to moderate counterparts. This result can be used to inform further research on the use of
cryptocurrencies for gambling, and the analysis of their transactions, for the early detection of
unsustainable spending, for example. This is just one of many possible—and much needed—
avenues of work extending these findings into the domain of responsible gambling analytics.
Limitations
The analyses performed here are subject to many of the same limitations of the use of online
gambling data for behaviour tracking research generally [5]. These include issues surrounding
the generalisability of findings. In the context of the use of cryptocurrencies for gambling—
specifically through decentralised gambling applications—is unclear whether the analysis
undertaken here will have similar results across other comparable applications. Furthermore,
it may be the case that the behavioural patterns uncovered here are incomplete as true player
gambling behaviour may be spread across several unobserved applications in addition to the
applications discussed here.
Such fundamental limitations can not be completely negated through experimental design.
However, future work should focus on increasing the sample size, both to more applications
and more players, which may address the issue of generalisablity regarding decentralised gam-
bling applications.
An additional point may be made regarding the transaction matching process performed
which pairs incoming and outgoing transactions. The data that this analysis was conducted
over involves a complete record of each player’s ingoing and outgoing transactions. However,
it does not contain a reliable temporal ordering for this data. In order to create a more useful
data set than the incoming and outgoing transactions in isolation, they can be matched such
that an outgoing transaction chronologically following an incoming transaction from the same
address can be taken to be the payout of a previously placed bet, but that other candidate trans-
actions may be considered in the case that one transaction is completed ahead of another.
Transaction matching, as described above, is unnecessary for the methodology used in this
paper, as all behavioural measures computed use the aggregation of an individual’s ingoing
and outgoing transactions. For example, the behavioural measure of percentage loss for a
given player only requires the sum of their bets and the sum of their payouts. However, one
might imagine the calculation of more sophisticated behavioural measures that do require
matched data in order that more sophisticated analyses might take place. For example, one
might attempt to calculate the phenomenon of ‘chasing losses’ by measuring the extent to
which players place larger bets after losing money on a prior bet. Such an analysis is not possi-
ble using the data set outlined above, as any given payout could not be conclusively matched to
a single bet. This matching process is briefly mentioned here as it will be essential for future
work in this area at the individual bet and risk analysis levels—both techniques are considered
out of scope of the present study.
Other limitations relate to the nature of the applications themselves in comparison to other
online gambling platforms. Specifically, each of the applications used here—and all decentra-
lised applications atop cryptocurrency networks—must use cryptocurrencies or similar tokens
by design. This means that although the real world value (e.g. in US$ or GBP) for any amount
of cryptocurrency can be determined in real terms, it is unclear whether or not this relation-
ship affects wagering, and in what way. An area of future work exploring this relationship may
investigate the distributions of bet sizes, and may uncover more detailed findings in terms of
how decentralised gambling differs from other online gambling. These studies may also help

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240693
in understand how the use of virtual goods and currencies affects the behaviour of players with
respect to spending. In this vein, comparisons with other uses of cryptocurrency technology,
such as the development of crypto-games [16], may provide a useful basis for comparison.
The differences between these applications and other online gambling providers also inher-
ently affects the populations who use them. This means that the sample of players considered
in this work is a sub-population of individuals who have purchased cryptocurrencies—a vola-
tile [16] and technologically sophisticated means of facilitating e-commerce [1]. How the per-
sonal characteristics of this sub-population differ from the general population is largely
unknown—especially with respect to gamblers—and represents an important avenue of future
work.
A final limitation of this work, given the context of recent advances in player behaviour
tracking research, is that it only explores simple behavioural measures based on those used to
explore casino gamblers. It therefore does not reach into more advanced analytical methods
for describing, classifying, or predicting player behaviours. This includes work by Fiedler
which explores more granular behavioural measures [6, 11], multiple studies by Percy [13] and
Dragičević et al. [17], which employ neural networks and other machine learning methods for
responsible gambling, and other data mining procedures for identifying high risk gamblers as
done by Philander [14]. In order to apply supervised machine learning as in these studies,
labelling heuristics for players should also be explored.
Future work
The analysis presented here recreates that of a series of papers originating from Harvard Medi-
cal School [9, 10]. Since that series was first published, a number of other descriptive measures
have been used such as the intensity, variability, frequency, and trajectory of a player’s bets [3],
and more specific variables such as the number of betting sessions and total time spent betting
[11]. Extending the present study by exploring player behaviours across these dimensions
would give a more complete picture of the player base of decentralised gambling applications,
and would give stronger grounds on which these transactions may be compared with other
types of gambling.
A second avenue of research extending the descriptive and test statistics reported here is the
use of this data for identifying and predicting high risk gambling. Existing work has identified
transaction patterns and behaviours to be markers of high-risk play [4, 18]—exploring such
methods in this new domain may therefore help identify those at risk, and better describe the
way these applications are used. The development of such identification methods may spur
regulators and policy makers to further explore cryptocurrency exchanges, whose operations
provide financial access to these applications. An obvious and useful first step would be for-
mally requiring transaction reporting for responsible gambling analysis.
Finally, the findings presented here may be tentatively mapped to other forms of gambling
in which similar work has been reported. Generalisations drawn from such mappings may
require further data gathering from both additional cryptocurrencies, such as the EOS net-
work, and more applications on the Ethereum network as described in this paper and else-
where. Increasing the sample size of players, both human and otherwise, represents a strong
second step in creating reliable and generalisable findings, which extend this work.
Conclusion
In this study, 2, 232, 741 transactions to and from three decentralised gambling applications,
originating from 24, 234 unique cryptocurrency addresses, were gathered, and four distinct
analyses performed. Our findings suggest that not all transactions to decentralised gambling

applications originate from human players, making data cleaning crucial in all further aca-
demic work concerning this type of data. We found a pairwise two sample Kolmogorov-Smir-
nov test across players behavioural measures to be effective in distinguishing non-human
players. Of transactions believed to originate from human players, we found that the beha-
vioural measures computed naïvely describe non-intensive but moderate spending over a
short duration for the typical player. This description was then found to mask a small portion
of heavily involved bettors, whose typical bet size appears to be almost 20× larger than their
non-heavily involved counterparts, and their total amount wagered appears to be over 1000×
larger over their duration of play. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold; the work pre-
sented primarily illustrates the power and scale of transaction data that decentralised gambling
applications can provide gambling researchers. Secondly, it describes a large cohort of players
from three such applications, and uncovers extreme behaviours, such as large bet sizes and
substantially larger total wagering among heavily involved players. This work should draw
attention to cryptocurrency transactions as a tool for large scale in-vivo gambling research,
and presents a robust foundation upon which multiple avenues of further analyses can be
performed.
