Abstract: In the process of accounts receivable financing under supply chain finance, the phenomenon
of accounts receivable forgery and default have caused great pressure on the supervision of financial
institutions. We consider the integration of blockchain technology with a supply chain finance
platform around the fraudulent default phenomenon in supply chain finance receivables financing
and construct a three-party stochastic evolutionary game model among financial institutions, core
enterprises, and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Firstly, we use Itô’s stochastic
differential equation theory to analyze the conditions for the stability of the behavior of game subjects.
Secondly, we use numerical simulations to quantitatively analyze the impact of the regulatory
strength of financial institutions, the information sharing of the blockchain platform, and the change
of incentive parameters on the strategy choice of game subjects. Through the above analysis, we
conclude that the information-sharing incentive coefficient promotes financial institutions to choose
to connect to the blockchain platform, and the information-sharing risk coefficient and the regulatory
intensity have the opposite effect on the blockchain platform construction. Meanwhile, the allocation
of incentive shares has a significant influence on the core enterprises. Finally, we give priorities and
directions for adjusting the relevant parameters to provide recommendations for financial institutions
to regulate the financing process more effectively.

1. Introduction
As an important part of China’s market economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enter-
prises (MSMEs) play an important role in the process of China’s economic development.
However, due to their qualifications, credit credentials, and proof of property, MSMEs
often have difficulties in obtaining low-cost loans from formal channels due to their low
credit assessment ratings in commercial banks and other financial institutions. As the up-
stream of the supply chain, MSMEs are often short of funds for their production activities,
and their inability to obtain financing seriously affects their liquidity, which can easily
lead to a break in their capital chain and thus affect the operation of the entire supply
chain [1]. The emergence of supply chain finance has brought a solution to the problem
of financing difficulties for MSMEs in the supply chain. Through a secured credit model
based on real trade, the core supply chain enterprises guarantee their partners, and the
MSMEs thus obtain loans from financial institutions or fintech companies [2]. However,
even with a guarantee from the core enterprise, new problems, such as slow information,
high costs, and the risk of fraudulent lending, arise. Due to the multi-level structure of
the supply chain, there are information barriers and information silos for enterprises at
the tail end, data are often poorly transmitted, the intermediate offline process is complex

and inefficient, the cost of seeking evidence is high, and MSMEs and core enterprises may
falsify transaction information for fraudulent lending. For example, from September to
November 2016, Genertec Dalian Machine Tool falsified its transaction information with
BYD by falsifying accounts receivable, forging contracts and official seals, and so on, to
obtain CNY 600 million from Zhongjiang Trust.
The features of blockchain can be a good solution to several problems that arise in
supply chain finance and in theory can reduce the risks currently faced by supply chain
finance [3]. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology established in a
non-secure environment, which allows all participants to become a node in the chain,
and each node can keep accounts on it and pack all the accounting information into a
data block by cryptographic algorithm records in the chronological order of accounting,
using cryptographic technology and asymmetric encryption to ensure the security of the
data [4]. To verify the validity of the information, all the nodes in the chain will confirm
the authenticity of the data block information together. The blockchain platform integrates
the asset cooperation, trade transactions, and closely related proof and evidence of each
enterprise in the supply chain into one chain, breaking through the existing three-party
credit model, achieving a decentralized and intermediary purpose, improving the efficiency
of capital operation, reducing transaction costs, and improving the convenience of financing.
For example, ICBC has built the ICBC e-Credit network financing and financial services
platform to mitigate risk through the automatic execution of smart contracts and a new and
reliable supply chain credit system. Tencent Cloud integrated blockchain technology with
warehouse receipt pledge financing scenarios, solving the problems of forgery, multiple
pledges, and false collateral in the traditional warehouse receipt pledge financing process,
realizing data-based management of the pledge transaction process.
In the above context, the application of blockchain technology in the receivables
financing process of supply chain finance is quite important. However, the development
and application of blockchain technology are still in the fumbling stage in domestic industry
due to the cost of information and the inefficiency of information exchange. In reality,
several problems concerning blockchain technology and supply chain finance need to be
solved. In this article, we explore the following issues:
(1) What factors influence whether financial institutions require supply chain companies
to interface with blockchain technology platforms?
(2) What factors influence the repayment of core enterprises and MSMEs?
(3) How should financial institutions work with supply chain enterprises?
To solve the problems, we construct a three-party stochastic evolutionary game model
between financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs and transform blockchain
features into parameters to be added to the mathematical model. We introduce stochastic
disturbance factors and quantitatively analyze the impact of changes in key parameters
on the strategy choice of game players through numerical simulations to explore the
evolutionary game path of the decision makers in supply chain finance. We find that the
information-sharing incentive factor promotes financial institutions to choose to connect to
the blockchain platform, while the information-sharing risk factor and regulatory effort play
the opposite role in blockchain platform building. Meanwhile, the allocation of incentive
shares significantly impacts core enterprises. We further give the priority and direction of
regulation for the adjustment of relevant parameters to provide suggestions for financial
institutions to regulate the financing process more effectively.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the
related literature. Section 3 constructs a three-party evolutionary game model for accounts
receivable financing under supply chain finance with blockchain technology. Section 4
introduces stochastic factors, constructs a three-party stochastic evolutionary game model,
and conducts stability analysis on the evolutionary equilibrium solution of the model.
Section 5 performs a stochastic Taylor expansion of the model and parametric analysis of
the model using numerical simulations. Section 6 summarizes our conclusions.

2. Literature Review
The emergence and development of supply chain finance have effectively solved
the problem of difficult financing for small and medium-sized enterprises [5]. In 2000,
Timme and Williams-Timme [6] first proposed the concept of supply chain finance, which
is a financial instrument led by core enterprises to provide a guarantee for upstream and
downstream enterprises to obtain external financing through their credit. On this basis,
Lamoureux [7] redefined supply chain finance as a process of systematic optimization of the
availability and cost of capital, led by the core enterprises. In 2004, Lambert [8] proposed a
receivables financing model based on upstream suppliers. However, in the actual financing
process, due to the redundant network of upstream and downstream enterprises in the sup-
ply chain, collusive fraud is hidden and difficult to investigate [9]. The occurrence of several
collusive frauds and defaults indicates that there are incalculable hidden risks in the pledge
financing model of accounts receivable. Some scholars believed that information asymme-
try is the most important risk faced by supply chain finance [10,11]. Gatteschi et al. [12]
argued that blockchain’s smart contract technology can effectively improve the efficiency
of financial institutions and core enterprises in providing guarantees and discounting to
financiers. Some scholars pointed out that blockchain technology features can effectively
fit in with the development of supply chain finance [13–16]. Zhou and Liu [17], through
a bibliometric data-driven analysis technique, found that the blockchain technique has
substantial applications in the field of cross-border e-commerce supply chain, whose con-
tributions mainly focus on a cross-border e-commerce platform, supply chain operations,
and data governance and information management. While Hofmann [18] analyzed the
characteristics of blockchain technology that can help financial activities, he also argued
that its tamper-proof nature can cause certain hidden dangers.
The supply chain finance market is characterized by a distinctly game-like nature.
Scholars have conducted a large number of game studies in the context of supply chain
finance. Bu and Li [19] constructed a two-subject evolutionary game study between fin-
tech companies and regulatory authorities and found that the strategy choice of fintech
companies was influenced by factors, such as extra profits for non-compliant innovation,
incentives, and penalties for compliant innovation. The strategy choice of regulatory au-
thorities was influenced by regulatory costs, social evaluation, and negative externalities.
Wang et al. [20] constructed a three-party evolutionary game among financial institutions,
core enterprises, and MSMEs, analyzed the equilibrium points of the three-party dynamic
evolutionary model and its asymptotic stability, and found that the strategy choice of
MSMEs was influenced by the cost of default and expected benefits. Zhang [21] analyzed
the supply chain financial service model and blockchain incentive mechanism, respec-
tively, from the perspective of the game and gave targeted solutions and countermeasure
suggestions for the development of blockchain-driven supply chain financial innovation.
Using game theory ideas, Deng and Li [22] firstly modeled and analyzed the automated
execution mechanism of smart contracts from the perspective of blockchain node activity
technology. In addition, they analyzed the three-party game of supply chain factoring
financing process, considering the influence of blockchain from the perspective of supply
chain business subjects’ decision making.
In earlier studies, some scholars have already captured the existence of high uncer-
tainty in the objective world and taken it into account in the study of game theory [23,24].
Xu et al. [25] used stochastic evolutionary game models to study the stability of the be-
havior of strategic alliance subjects and solved the sufficient conditions for the alliance to
remain stable and disintegrate, respectively, as a way to explain the effectiveness of strategic
alliances. Miao et al. [26] also applied the Itô’s stochastic differential equation containing
white noise in studying the game behavior of owners and contractors in major engineering
projects and provided relevant decision-making suggestions for the risk management of
interest subjects in major engineering projects. Li et al. [27] built a three-party stochastic
evolutionary game model of local government, reporting enterprises, and intermediaries
around the phenomenon of R&D manipulation in the declaration of high-tech enterprises,
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 4 of 20
used Itô’s stochastic differential equation theory to analyze the stability conditions of the
behavior of game subjects, and quantitatively analyzed the influence of key variables on
the subjects’ strategy choice.
From the existing literature, firstly, most of the research on the accounts receivable
financing model is based on the traditional accounts receivable financing model, and there
is less research on the accounts receivable financing model based on supply chain finance.
It is mostly two-entity game research, and there is less research on three-party evolution
games. On this basis, we have constructed a three-party evolutionary game model for
analysis. Secondly, the supply chain finance model proposed by scholars has not departed
from the foundation of traditional supply chain finance. Most of the literature studies the
combination of blockchain and supply chain finance from the qualitative perspective and
application design perspective, and fewer studies explore the application of blockchain
technology from the perspective of quantitative analysis. We transform blockchain features
into parameters to join the model and consider its impact on the game subjects. Finally,
most of the literature ignores the impact of external factors’ interference on the strategies of
game subjects and cannot reflect the impact of realistic stochastic interference factors on the
decisions of each participating subject. We introduce random disturbance factors to make
the evolutionary process close to reality.
3. Evolutionary Game Model
The traditional supply chain finance receivables financing model is shown in Figure 1.
In the receivables financing model of supply chain finance, MSMEs are upstream suppliers,
and core enterprises usually purchase from MSMEs in the form of credit. At this time,
MSMEs, which mainly rely on cash to maintain their normal operations, need funds to
purchase raw materials but are unable to obtain financing from financial institutions due to
factors such as small scale, few collateralizable assets, few free assets, weak risk resistance,
and low credit rating. After reaching a deal, the core enterprise issues an accounts receivable
document to the MSME, which pledges the document to the financial institution. If the
core enterprise agrees to use its creditworthiness to guarantee the financing for the MSME,
it submits proof of the accounts receivable document and a payment guarantee to the
financial institution, which receives it and finances the MSME. At this point, the claims
on the receivables are transferred from the MSME to the financial institution, and the core
enterprise needs to repay the receivables by the due date.
Figure 1. Traditional supply chain finance accounts receivable financing model.
The supply chain finance receivables financing model under blockchain is shown
in Figure 2. In the actual transaction process, core enterprises and MSMEs may falsify
transaction information and accounts receivable to financial institutions for fraudulent
lending, and the successful fraudulent lending enterprises may obtain additional spec-
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 5 of 20
ulative benefits or even run away with the money. Financial institutions need to audit
the authenticity of transactions and accounts receivable, but due to the numerous supply
chains, varying degrees of information technology, and cumbersome audit processes, finan-
cial institutions have to pay high audit costs and spend a lot of time. After the introduction
of blockchain technology, docking to the blockchain platform will significantly improve the
efficiency of financing. The blockchain consensus algorithm makes the data on the chain
self-timestamped. Even if the data are tampered with, there is still a trace, avoiding asym-
metry of information from multiple parties. Therefore, in the transaction process, the core
enterprises cannot falsify the transaction information after the introduction of blockchain.

3.1. Model Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs are all finite rational
decision makers who learn to maximize their own utility in the game process.
Hypothesis 2 (H2). The information shared on the blockchain by the participants in the game is
real information.
Hypothesis 3 (H3). Information on the blockchain cannot be tampered with; thus, core and
MSMEs cannot conspire to defraud and falsify accounts receivable.
3.2. Analysis of the Game Model
Consider a game model consisting of a financial institution, a core enterprise, and an
MSME in a receivables financing model under supply chain finance. In this supply chain
finance model, the core enterprise acts as the financing initiator and provides guarantees
for the MSMEs, the financial institution provides loans, and the core enterprise is the final
repayer. The blockchain platform built by financial institutions can significantly reduce
the audit cost of financial institutions, reduce the risk of business default, and improve
the efficiency of financing. However, financial institutions may not choose to dock to a
blockchain platform because of the high upfront investment costs. As the ultimate repayer,
the core enterprises may not repay the loan due to financial constraints or seeking investment
interests, on the one hand. On the other hand, it is worried about the pressure of public
opinion and penalties from financial institutions if its non-payment behavior is exposed or
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 6 of 20
investigated. After obtaining financing, MSMEs may, on the one hand, choose to default
and use the funds for investment to obtain additional returns due to insufficient production
capacity, but it will face penalties and media exposure from financial institutions and core
enterprises. On the other hand, MSMEs will use the funds to purchase raw materials for
normal production activities and maintain the normal operation of the supply chain.
The optional strategies for each of the three-party game players are: the strategy for
the financial institution is {non-docking, docking} with probability x, 1− x; the strategy set
for the core enterprise is {non-repayment, repayment} with probability y, 1− y; and the
strategy set for the MSME is {default, keep promise} with probability z, 1− z.
Assume that the loan amount of the MSME is A, and the interest rate of the loan is
r. Before docking to the blockchain platform, for a financial institution, the regulatory
cost of the financial institution is γc1, and γ is the regulatory effort factor. The financial
institution’s gain from handling pledged receivables financing is Ar, and the loss due to
the core enterprise’s non-repayment is A(1 + r). Since the blockchain is not used, the core
enterprise and the MSME conspire to falsify the receivables, the fraud success rate is 1− γ,
and the loss caused by the falsified receivables to the financial institution is denoted by Rm.
For core enterprises, the gain from financing through pledging accounts receivable is W1,
the gain from reinvestment without repayment is W2, the additional gain from colluding to
falsify accounts receivable for investment is Wm, the penalty from the financial institution
for non-repayment is p1, the penalty from the financial institution for falsifying accounts
receivable is p2, and the penalty goes to the financial institution. For the MSME, the gain
from financing through accounts receivable is S1, the gain from defaulting to reinvest is
S2, the additional gain from colluding to falsify accounts receivable for investment is Sm,
the penalty from the financial institution for its default is p3, the penalty from falsifying
accounts receivable is p4, and the penalty goes to the financial institution and the core
business, respectively. If the MSME chooses to keep its credit and the core enterprise
chooses to repay, both receive an incentive V from the financial institution, of which the
core enterprise’s share is β1. If one party defaults, the incentive goes to the other party.
The cost of building a blockchain platform for financial institutions is C. After docking
the blockchain platform, the cost of using the blockchain platform is C. The core enterprise
and the MSME cannot conspire to falsify the receivables. If the core enterprise repays on
time and the MSME keeps its promise, they jointly receive a blockchain incentive G, of which
the core enterprise accounts for β2. If one party defaults, the incentive goes to the other
party. After docking, K1, K2, and K3 indicate the shared information absorption capacity of
a financial institution, core enterprise, and MSME, respectively, and Q1, Q2, and Q3 indicate
the information sharing volume of financial institutions, core enterprise, and MSME, respec-
tively, such as loan product information, enterprise credit, warehouse receipt information,
etc. Meanwhile, information sharing may trigger risks; δ denotes the risk coefficient of
information sharing, and α denotes the incentive coefficient of information sharing.
3.3. Analysis of Payoff Matrix
The scenarios of the different strategic choices of the three subjects are analyzed in the
context of the constructed tripartite game scenario.
When the financial institution chooses to dock, the core enterprise chooses to repay,
and the MSME chooses to keep its promise, there are no risk costs and benefits arising
from fraud and default for the three parties. Therefore, the financial institution’s return is
Ar + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− C, the core enterprise’s return is W1 + β1V + β2G + (α−
δ)Q2 + K2(Q1 + Q3)− Ar, and the MSME’s return is S1 + (1− β1)V + (1− β2)G + (α−
δ)Q3 + K3(Q1 + Q2).
When the financial institution chooses to dock, the core enterprise chooses to repay,
and the MSME chooses to default, the MSME will be penalized for default and will not
receive the blockchain incentive or the trustworthiness incentive, but it will receive the
investment return. The core enterprise still needs to repay the loan without receiving the
goods and cannot return the funds, cannot obtain the financing income, and obtains all
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 7 of 20
the trustworthiness incentives and blockchain incentives. Thus, the financial institution’s
return is Ar + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− C + p3, the core enterprise’s return is V + G +
(α− δ)Q2 + K2(Q1 + Q3)− A(1 + r), and the MSME’s return is S2 + (α− δ)Q3 + K3(Q1 +
Q2)− p3.
When the financial institution chooses to dock, the core enterprise chooses not to repay,
and the MSME chooses to keep its promise, the core enterprise defaults and is penalized
for the default and does not receive the blockchain incentive or the trust incentive, but it
receives the investment return. The MSME receives the financing proceeds and receives
the full compliance incentive and the blockchain incentive. The financial institution cannot
recover the loan, so the financial institution’s return is p1 + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)−
A(1 + r)− C, the core enterprise’s return is W2 + (α− δ)Q2 + K2(Q1 + Q3)− p1, and the
MSME’s return is S1 + V + G + (α− δ)Q3 + K3(Q1 + Q2).
When the financial institution chooses to dock, the core enterprise chooses not to repay,
and the MSME chooses to default, the financial institution is unable to recover the loan, and
the core enterprise is unable to carry out productive activities to return funds for reinvestment
because the goods have not been received. Thus, the financial institution’s return is p1 +
p3 + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− A(1 + r)− C, the core enterprise’s return is (α− δ)Q2 +
K2(Q1 + Q3)− p1, and the MSME’s return is S2 + (α− δ)Q3 + K3(Q1 + Q2)− p3.
When the financial institution chooses not to dock, the core enterprise chooses to
repay and MSME chooses to keep its promise, they are unable to obtain information-
sharing gains and blockchain incentives from the blockchain platform. Core enterprises
and MSMEs can fraudulently obtain loans from financial institutions by falsifying their
accounts receivable, and financial institutions penalize them regardless of whether the
fraud succeeds or fails. The financial institution’s return is Ar + p2 + p4− γc1− (1− γ)Rm,
the core enterprise’s return is W1 + β1V + (1− γ)Wm − p2 − Ar, and the MSME’s return is
S1 + (1− β1)V + (1− γ)Sm − p4.
When the financial institution chooses not to dock, the core enterprise chooses to repay
the loan, and the MSME chooses to default, the MSME will be penalized for default and will
not receive the blockchain incentive as well as the trustworthiness incentive, but it receives
the investment return. The core enterprise still needs to repay the loan without receiving
the goods, cannot return the funds, and cannot obtain the financing benefit and obtain
the full trustworthiness incentive. Thus, the financial institution’s return is Ar + p2 + p4 +
p3 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm, the core enterprise’s return is W1 + V + (1− γ)Wm − p2 − A(1 + r),
and the MSME’s return is S2 + (1− γ)Sm − p3 − p4.
When the financial institution chooses not to dock, the core enterprise chooses not
to repay, and the MSME chooses to keep the loan, the financial institution cannot recover
the loan. Therefore, the financial institution’s return is p1 + p2 + p4 − A(1 + r)− γc1 −
(1− γ)Rm, the core enterprise’s return is W2 + (1− γ)Wm − p1 − p2, and the MSME’s
return is S1 + V + (1− γ)Sm − p4.
When the financial institution chooses not to dock, the core enterprise chooses not to
repay, and the MSME chooses to default, the financial institution’s return is p1 + p2 + p3 +
p4 − A(1 + r)− γc1 − (1− γ)Rm, the core enterprise’s return is (1− γ)Wm − p1 − p2, and
the MSME’s return is S2 + (1− γ)Sm − p3 − p4. The payoff matrix of financial institutions,
core enterprises, and MSMEs is shown in Table 1.

3.4. Replication of Dynamic Equations
Assuming that the expected return of a financial institution adopting a “non-docking”
or “docking” strategy is U11 and U12, respectively, the average expected return of a financial
institution is U1, with:
U11 =yz[p1 + p2 + p2 + p3 + p4 − A(1 + r)− γc1 − (1− γ)Rm]
+ y(1− z)[p1 + p2 + p4 − A(1 + r)− γc1 − (1− γ)Rm]
+ (1− y)z[Ar + p2 + p3 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm]
+ (1− y)(1− z)[Ar + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm]
U12 =yz[p1 + p2 + p3 + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− A(1− r)− C]
+ y(1− z)[p1 + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− A(1− r)− C]
+ (1− y)z[Ar + p3 + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− C]
+ (1− y)(1− z)[Ar + (α− δ)Q1 + K1(Q2 + Q3)− C]
U1 =xU11 + (1− x)U12,

The replication dynamic equation for the financial institution is obtained as follows:

= x(1− x)[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)].

Assuming that the expected returns of the core enterprise adopting the “non-repayment”
or “repayment” strategy are U21 and U22, respectively, the average expected return of the
core enterprise is U2, with:
U21 =xz[(1− γ)Wm − p1 − p2]
+ x(1− z)[W2 + (1− γ)Wm − p1 − p2]
+ (1− x)z[(α− δ)Q1 + K2(Q1 + Q3)]

Assuming that the expected returns of MSMEs adopting the “default” or “keep
promise” strategy are U31 and U32, respectively, the average expected return for MSMEs is
U3, with:
U31 =xy[S2 + (1− γ)Sm − p3 − p4]
+ x(1− y)[S2 + (1− γ)Sm − p3 − p4]
+ (1− x)y[S2 + (α− δ)Q1 + K3(Q1 + Q2)− p3]
+ (1− x)(1− y)[S2 + (α− δ)Q1 + K3(Q1 + Q2)− p3]
U32 =xy[S1 + V + (1− γ)Sm − p4]
+ x(1− y)[S1 + (1− β1)V + (1− γ)Sm − p4]
+ (1− x)y[S1 + (α− δ)Q1 + K3(Q1 + Q2)
+ (1− x)(1− y)[S1 + (1− β1)V + (1− β2)G + (α− δ)Q1 + K3(Q1 + Q2)]
U3 =zU31 + (1− z)U32,
(5)
The replication dynamics equation for MSMEs is obtained as follows:

dt
=z(U31 −U3)
=z(1− z)[S2 − p3 − S1 −V + (1− y)β1V − (1− x)G + (1− x)(1− y)β2G].
(6)
Since 1− x, 1− y, and 1− z are non-negative and do not affect the outcome of the
evolutionary game, we transform the replication dynamic equation into the following form:
dx =x[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)]dt
dy =y[(1− z)(W2 −W1 − β1V) + z(A−V) + Ar− p1 − (1− x)zG− (1− x)(1− z)β2G]dt
dz =z(1− z)[S2 − p3 − S1 −V + (1− y)β1V − (1− x)G + (1− x)(1− y)β2G]dt.

4. Construction of a Stochastic Evolutionary Game Model
4.1. Random Factors Perturbing the Three-Party Game
During the operation of supply chain finance, the core enterprise, the MSME, and the
financial institution face greater uncertainty. On the one hand, in addition to the production
and operating conditions of enterprises, the changing sentiment and risk appetite of each
group will directly influence the strategies of participants. On the other hand, external
factors, such as changes in the supply chain financial system and macroeconomic policies,
will also interfere with the behavior of participants. Therefore, the original evolutionary
game cannot truly reflect the strategic adjustment process of each participant. To overcome
this shortcoming, we add stochastic factors to the evolutionary game model. Gaussian
white noise is introduced into the replicated dynamic equations as follows:
dx(t) =x(t)[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)]dt (8)
dy(t) =y(t)[(1− z)(W2 −W1 − β1V) + z(A−V) + Ar− p1 − (1− x)zG
− (1− x)(1− z)β2G]dt + σy(t)dω(t)
(9)
dz(t) =z(t)[S2 − p3 − S1 −V + (1− y)β1V − (1− x)G + (1− x)(1− y)β2G]dt
+ σz(t)dω(t)
. (10)
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 10 of 20
In Equations (8)–(10), σ denotes the strength of the random disturbance, and ω(t)
denotes the one-dimensional standard Brownian motion. Brownian motion is a stochastic
fluctuation phenomenon that captures the effect of random disturbances on the subject
of the game well. Gaussian white noise is dω(t). When t > 0 and the time step h > 0,
ω(t + h)−ω(t) ∼ N(0, h).
4.2. Stability Analysis of Evolutionary Equilibrium Solutions
Assuming an initial state of t = 0 and initial values of x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0,
we can find x(t) = 0, y(t) = 0, and z(t) = 0, which are equilibrium solutions to replicate
the dynamic equations. In other words, in the absence of external interference, the system
will always remain at the point where the financial institution chooses “docking”, the core
enterprise chooses “repay”, and the MSME chooses “keep promise”. However, due to
the high level of uncertainty in the real world, this ideal situation is usually impossible to
achieve, and each player in the game is subject to more or less random factors. Therefore,
it is necessary to consider the impact of stochastic disturbances on the stability of the
system [28].
Theorem 1. For the stochastic differential equation is shown below:
dx(t) = f (t, x(t))dt + g(t, x(t))dω(t), x(t0) = x0, (11)
let x(t) = x(t, x0) be a solution to the equation given a continuously differentiable function
V(t, x) and positive numbers; there exists c1|x|p ≤ c2|x|p, t ≥ 0. Let LV(t, x) = Vt(t, x) +
Vx(t, x) f (t, x)+ 1/2g2(t, x)Vxx(t, x): (1) If there is a positive number γ which satisfies LV(t, x) ≤
−γV(t, x), t ≥ 0, then the zero solution of the equation with p-th moment exponent is stable and
E|x(t, x0)|p < (c2/c1)|x0|pe−γt, t ≥ 0. (2) If there is a positive number γ which satisfies
LV(t, x) ≥ γV(t, x), t ≥ 0, then the zero solution p-th moment of the equation is unstable and
E|x(t, x0)|p ≥ (c2/c1)|x0|pe−γt, t ≥ 0.
For the replicated dynamic Equations (8)–(10) of the stochastic evolutionary game
we have created, let (t, x) = x, V(t, y) = y, V(t, z) = z, c1 = 1, c2 = 1, p = 1 and γ = 1;
LV(t, x) = f (t, x), LV(t, y) = f (t, y), LV(t, z) = f (t, z). If the zero solution of the equation
with p-th moment exponential is stable, it needs to satisfy:
x[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)] ≤ −x
y[(1− z)(W2 −W1 − β1V) + z(A−V) + Ar− p1 − (1− x)zG− (1− x)(1− z)β2G] ≤ −y
z[S2 − p3 − S1 −V + (1− y)β1V − (1− x)G + (1− x)(1− y)β2G] ≤ −z
(12)
Since x, y, z ∈ [0, 1], the conditions for satisfying the above equation are:
[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)]x ≤ −x
[(1− z)(W2 −W1 − β1V) + z(A−V) + Ar− p1 − (1− x)zG− (1− x)(1− z)β2G]y ≤ −y
[S2 − p3 − S1 −V + (1− y)β1V − (1− x)G + (1− x)(1− y)β2G]z ≤ −z
(13)
The zero solution p-th moment exponential is stable when all three conditions are met.
This means that over time the proportion of non-cooperative strategies (financial institu-
tions choosing “non-docking”, core enterprises choosing “non-repayment”, and MSMEs
choosing “default”) will decay exponentially to zero. At this point, the only evolving and
stable strategy is the cooperative strategy (financial institutions choose “docking”, core
enterprises choose “repayment”, and MSMEs choose “keep promise”).
5. Numerical Simulation and Analysis
5.1. Stochastic Taylor Expansions of Replicating Dynamic Equation
Since the replica dynamic equations are nonlinear Itô’s stochastic differential equations
for which analytical solutions are not directly available, the equations are solved numer-
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 11 of 20
ically using the stochastic Taylor expansion. The following Itô’s stochastic differential
equations are first discussed:
x(t) = f (t, x(t))dt + g(t, x(t))dω(t). (14)
In this equation, t ∈ [t0, T], x(t0) = x0, x0 ∈ R and ω(t) denotes one-dimensional
standard Brownian motion. Let h = (T − t0)/N, tn = t0 + nh, and the stochastic Taylor
expansion of the equation is as follows:
x(tn+1) = x(tn) + h f (x(tn)) + ∆ωng(x(tn)) +

2
h2[ f (x(tn)) f ′(x(tn))] +

2
g2(x(tn)) f ′′(x(tn))] + R
. (15)
In the above expansion, R is the residual term. We use the Milstein numerical method
to solve the equations [29]. In the Milstein method, the stochastic Taylor expansion is
truncated to a first-order expression, and the residual term is discarded. As a result, the
equation is modified as follows:
x(tn+1) = x(tn) + h f (x(tn)) + ∆ωng(x(tn)) +

[

]
g(x(tn))g′(x(tn)). (16)
Therefore, using the Milstein method to solve the SDEs (8)–(10), we can obtain:
x(tn+1) = x(tn) + hx(tn)[C + p2 + p4 − γc1 − (1− γ)Rm − (α− δ)Q1 − K1(Q2 + Q3)] + ∆ωnσx(tn)

5.2. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
We use R software to simulate the stochastic evolutionary game model, focusing on
the impact of regulatory effort, information-sharing risk coefficient, information-sharing
incentive coefficient, and incentive share on the choice of subject strategy. The relevant
variables were taken as follows: A = 6, r = 0.01, c1 = 2, Rm = 1, W1 = 11, W2 = 8, p1 = 12,
p2 = 2, p3 = 7, p4 = 3.5, S1 = 8, S2 = 9, V = 20, C = 3, G = 2.5, K1 = 0.5, Q1 = 10,
Q2 = 20, and Q3 = 20. All the initial values of the coefficients were set to 0.5. In the
comparative analysis of the correlation coefficients, a low value of 0.1 and a high value of
0.9 are taken as controls.
5.2.1. Information Sharing Factor
With other parameters being held constant, the impact of changes in the information-
sharing risk factor δ and the information-sharing incentive factor α on the evolutionary
path of strategies for financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs are analyzed.
The simulation results are shown in the subplots a–f of Figure 3. Letting δ = 0.1, 0.5,
and 0.9, respectively, at t = 0.03, for financial institutions, the proportion of financial
institutions that choose not to interface with the blockchain platform increases significantly
as the information-sharing risk factor increases. The larger the information-sharing risk
coefficient, the greater the risk faced by the financial institution and the more inclined the
financial institution is not to dock. However, the increase in δ does not have the same
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 12 of 20
impact on core and MSMEs. As δ increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the proportion of core enterprises
choosing not to repay decreases, as do MSMEs. Letting α = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9, respectively,
at t = 0.03, for financial institutions, as the information-sharing incentive factor increases,
the proportion of financial institutions choosing not to interface with blockchain platforms
changes less, and the impact of changes in the information-sharing incentive factor on
financial institutions is insignificant. However, the increase in α does not affect core and
MSMEs in the same way. When α increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the proportion of core enterprises
choosing not to repay the loan decreases significantly, as do MSMEs.
In terms of the speed of convergence of the strategies, increasing the information-
sharing risk factor δ and the information-sharing incentive factor α from 0.1 to 0.9 has in-
consistent effects on financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs. When δ = 0.1, the
moment when the proportion of financial institutions adopting the non-docking blockchain
platform strategy first reaches 0 is t = 0.21, the moment when the proportion of core
enterprises adopting the non-repayment strategy first reaches 0 is t = 0.42, and the moment
when the proportion of MSMEs adopting the default strategy first reaches 0 is t = 0.29.
When δ = 0.9, the proportion of financial institutions adopting the non-docking blockchain
platform strategy at the moment when it first reaches zero is t = 0.53, an increase of 0.32,
the moment when the proportion of core enterprises adopting a non-repayment strategy
first reaches zero is t = 0.23, a shortening of 0.19, and the moment when the proportion of
MSMEs adopting a default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.18, a shortening of 0.11. Thus,
the change in the information-sharing risk factor δ has a significant impact on the speed
at which financial institutions and core and MSMEs reach zero. There is a contradiction
between the speed of convergence of the firm strategy to zero. When α = 0.1, the moment
when the proportion of financial institutions with a non-docking blockchain platform
strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.3, the moment when the proportion of core enterprises
with a non-repayment strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.42, and the moment when the
proportion of MSMEs with a default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.29. When α = 0.9,
the moment when the proportion of financial institutions with a non-docking blockchain
platform strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.32, an increase of 0.02, the moment when
the proportion of core enterprises adopting a non-repayment strategy first reaches zero is
t = 0.23, a shortening of 0.19, and the moment when the proportion of MSMEs adopting
a default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.18, a shortening of 0.11. Thus, the change in
the incentive coefficient for information-sharing α has a significant impact on the speed at
which financial institutions and core, MSMEs reach zero. There is a contradiction between
the speed of convergence to zero of the firms’ strategies.
In terms of the degree of change in strategy, the proportion of financial institutions
choosing not to dock reaches a maximum of 79.61% at t = 0.03 when δ = 0.9, but when
δ = 0.1, this proportion is 29.91% at moment t = 0.03, a decrease of 49.7%. For core
enterprises, the proportion choosing not to repay reaches a maximum of 68.71% at moment
t = 0.03 when δ = 0.1. When δ = 0.9, this proportion drops to 32.89%, a decrease of
38.82%. For MSMEs, the proportion choosing to default reaches a maximum of 55.21%
at moment t = 0.02 when δ = 0.1, and this proportion drops to 31.07% when δ = 0.9, a
decrease of 24.14%. When α = 0.9, the proportion of financial institutions choosing not to
dovetail reaches a maximum of 63.62% at t = 0.03, but when δ = 0.1, this proportion is
39.26% at moment t = 0.03, a decrease of 24.36%. For enterprises, the proportion choosing
not to repay reaches a maximum of 68.85% at moment t = 0.03 when α = 0.1. When
α = 0.9, this proportion drops to 32.82%, a decrease of 36.03%. For MSMEs, the proportion
choosing to default reaches a maximum of 55.23% at moment t = 0.02 when α = 0.1, and
this proportion drops to 31.03% when α = 0.9, a decrease of 24.2%.
The larger the information-sharing risk factor δ, the more financial institutions tend
not to match, the more core enterprises tend to repay, and the more MSMEs tend to keep
their credit. The larger the information-sharing incentive coefficient α, the more financial
institutions tend not to dock, the more core enterprises tend to repay, and the more MSMEs
tend to keep their credit. Financial institutions are sensitive to the information-sharing
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3084 13 of 20
risk coefficient and less sensitive to the information-sharing incentive coefficient, and core
enterprises and MSMEs are equally sensitive to the information-sharing risk and incentive
coefficients. This indicates that financial institutions are more concerned about the risk
of information leakage they will face when interfacing with blockchain platforms, and
they are likely to choose to share less information and more inclined not to interfere with
blockchain platforms.

5.2.2. Regulatory Efforts
Holding other parameters constant, we analyze the impact of changes in the regulatory
intensity of financial institutions γ on the evolutionary path of the strategies of financial
institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs when not docked to the blockchain platform. Let
γ = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9, respectively, and the simulation results are shown in the subplots a–c
of Figure 4. At t = 0.03, for financial institutions, the proportion choosing not to dock to
the blockchain platform increases significantly as regulation increases. The increase in γ
has the opposite effect on core and MSMEs; as γ increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the proportion
of core enterprises choosing not to repay decreases significantly, as do MSMEs. This may
be because when not connected to a blockchain platform, financial institutions strengthen
regulation and pay more for regulation, and the less likely core enterprises and MSMEs are
to choose to collude in fraud because the expected return from such collusion is reduced. As
a result, the expected loss for financial institutions is lower. Therefore, increased regulation
can achieve the same effect of reducing fraud and default risk for financial institutions as
when connected to a blockchain platform.
In terms of the rate of convergence of the strategy, increasing the regulation γ from 0.1
to 0.9 has an inconsistent impact on financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs.
When γ = 0.1, the moment when the proportion of financial institutions with a non-
docking blockchain platform strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.23, the moment when the
proportion of core enterprises with a non-repayment strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.42,
and the moment when the proportion of MSMEs with a default strategy first reaches zero
is t = 0.42. When γ = 0.9, the proportion of financial institutions with a non-docking
blockchain platform strategy at the moment when it first reaches zero is t = 0.29, an increase
of 0.2, the moment when the proportion of core enterprises with a non-repayment strategy
first reaches zero is t = 0.23, a shortening of 0.19, and the moment when the proportion
of MSMEs with a default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.18, a shortening of 0.11. Thus,
the change in regulatory intensity γ has a significant impact on the convergence of the
strategies of financial institutions and core and MSMEs to zero at a rate that is contradictory
to each other.
In terms of the degree of change in strategy, the proportion of financial institutions
choosing not to dock reaches a maximum of 70.54% at t = 0.03 when γ = 0.9, but when
γ = 0.1, this proportion is 34.84% at moment t = 0.03, a decrease of 35.7%. For core
enterprises, the proportion choosing not to repay reaches a maximum of 68.79% at moment
t = 0.03 when γ = 0.1. When γ = 0.9, this proportion drops to 32.89%, a decrease of
32.85%. For MSMEs, the proportion choosing to default reaches a maximum of 55.22%
at moment t = 0.02 when γ = 0.1, and this proportion drops to 31.05% when γ = 0.9, a
decrease of 24.17%.
Therefore, when not interfacing with a blockchain platform, financial institutions’
regulation γ has a significant impact on the strategy choice of core and MSMEs, with
priority regulation γ for core enterprises and second regulation γ for MSMEs. When
financial institutions have invested enough regulatory costs, they are less inclined to
interface with blockchain platforms. Financial institutions need to make a good trade-
off between technology and human costs before deciding on the level of regulation. As
financial institutions pay higher sunk costs when they do not connect to a blockchain
platform, they are less inclined to pay the additional cost of connecting to a blockchain
platform, even though connecting to a blockchain platform will reduce this portion of
regulatory costs.

5.2.3. Incentive Share
Holding other parameters constant, we analyze the impact of the core enterprise share
of credit-keeping incentives β1 and blockchain incentives β2 on the strategy choice of core
enterprises and MSMEs. The simulation results are shown in the subplots a–d of Figure 5,
respectively. When β1 increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the proportion of core enterprises choosing
not to repay the loan decreases significantly, while the proportion of MSMEs choosing
to default does not change significantly. Let β2 = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 respectively, when β2
increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the proportion of core enterprises choosing not to repay decreases,
and the proportion of MSMEs choosing to default decreases, with insignificant changes.
In terms of the speed of convergence of the strategy, increasing the proportion of core
enterprises with a trustworthy incentive β1 from 0.1 to 0.9 has a greater impact on core
enterprises. When β1 = 0.1, the moment when the proportion of core enterprises using the
non-repayment strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.63, and the moment when the proportion
of MSMEs using the default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.21. When β1 = 0.9, the
moment when the proportion of core enterprises using the non-repayment strategy first
reaches zero is t = 0.17, a reduction of 0.46, and the moment when the proportion of
MSMEs using the default strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.27, an increase of 0.46. The
moment when the proportion first reaches zero is t = 0.27, an increase of 0.06. Thus, there
is a contradiction between the change in the proportion of core enterprises incentivized
by trustworthiness and the rate at which the core and MSME strategies converge to zero.
Increasing the blockchain incentive core enterprise share β2 from 0.1 to 0.9 has a greater
impact on core enterprises and a smaller impact on MSMEs. When β2 = 0.1, the moment
when the proportion of core enterprises adopting a non-repayment strategy first reaches
zero is t = 0.44, and the moment when the proportion of MSMEs adopting a default
strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.29. When β2 = 0.9, the moment when the proportion
of core enterprises adopting a non-repayment strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.22, a
reduction of 0.22, and the moment when the proportion of MSMEs adopting a default
strategy first reaches zero is t = 0.19, a shortening of 0.1.
In terms of the degree of change in strategy, for core enterprises, the proportion
choosing not to repay reaches a maximum of 97.21% at moment t = 0.18 when β1 = 0.1.
When β1 = 0.9, this proportion drops to 2.58%, a decrease of 94.63%. For MSMEs, the
proportion choosing to default reaches a maximum of 50.37% at moment t = 0.02 when
β1 = 0.1, and this proportion falls to 34.65% when β1 = 0.9, a decrease of 15.72%. For core
enterprises, the proportion choosing not to repay reaches a maximum of 69.28% at moment
t = 0.03 when β2 = 0.1. When β2 = 0.9, this proportion drops to 32.48%, a decrease of
36.8%. For MSMEs, the proportion choosing to default reaches a maximum of 54.88% at
moment t = 0.02 when β2 = 0.1, and this proportion drops to 31.28% when β2 = 0.9, a
decrease of 23.6%.
When the proportion of core enterprises with creditworthiness incentives β1 increases,
core enterprises are more inclined to repay the loan, and MSMEs are almost unaffected
by the change in the proportion of creditworthiness incentives. Therefore, when financial
institutions regulate the creditworthiness incentive, they should give priority to regulating
the impact of β1 on core enterprises.
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, when financial institutions are committed to increasing
the rate of convergence of subject strategies to reach a fully cooperative state more quickly,
financial institutions are more sensitive to the information-sharing risk factor, and core
enterprises are more sensitive to the share of creditworthiness incentives. When financial
institutions are more concerned about the degree of change in subject strategies, financial
institutions are highly sensitive to the information-sharing risk factor, and core enterprises
are highly sensitive to the share of trustworthy incentives. Therefore, improving the security
of blockchain information sharing and increasing the share of trustworthy incentives for
core enterprises can significantly reduce the time to reach a steady state.

6. Conclusions
Based on the traditional three-party evolutionary game model for receivables financ-
ing in supply chain finance, we transform blockchain features into parameters to join
the mathematical model, analyze the stability of strategy choice of game subjects under
stochastic situations by constructing a stochastic evolutionary game model among financial
institutions, core enterprises and MSMEs, and further quantitatively analyze the influence
of regulatory strength, credit sharing risk coefficient, credit sharing incentive coefficient,
and incentive share on subjects’ strategy choice. We have drawn the following conclusions
from our study of the impact of blockchain technology on the receivables financing deci-
sions of financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs: Firstly, blockchain technology
ensures open and transparent information for all parties involved in receivables financing,
and information sharing will bring certain risks and incentives to each participating entity.
When the risk and incentive of information sharing brought by the interfacing blockchain
platform are high, the likelihood of core enterprises and MSMEs keeping their trust in-
creases because as the information sharing among participating parties becomes deeper,
the probability of being punished for non-compliance increases, and the positive incentive
brought by trustworthiness motivates enterprises to continue to choose trustworthiness
in the next cooperation. However, for financial institutions, continuing to interface with
blockchain platforms is difficult to achieve when the risk of information sharing is high,
even if information sharing provides them with some incentive.
Secondly, when not connected to a blockchain platform, financial institutions pay extra
regulatory costs to audit the authenticity of transactions and receivables. When financial
institutions are more heavily regulated, core and MSMEs are more likely to be trustworthy,
as their non-compliance is then more likely to be detected and thus penalized. At the same
time, financial institutions tend not to interface with blockchain platforms because the
gains from blockchain technology are smaller under sufficiently strong regulation, and the
costs required to build a blockchain platform are higher. Thirdly, for core enterprises and
MSMEs, the act of keeping trust will bring incentives, and they will obtain extra incentives
when they choose to keep trust after connecting to the blockchain platform. When a core
enterprise or MSME chooses to keep its trust during the cooperation process, it will be
trusted by financial institutions, which grant it certain preferential policies, such as lower
interest rates on loans. When the incentive to keep trust increases, the likelihood of core
enterprises keeping trust increases significantly, while there is little chance for MSMEs. As
the originator of receivables financing and the ultimate repayer, when MSMEs default, the
core enterprises still have to repay the loan without downstream capital inflows, and even
if they default, they cannot earn investment returns. In contrast, when the core enterprise
defaults, the MSME still receives a grant from the financial institution. Therefore, the
benefits from the credit compliance incentive are more important to the core enterprises.

Financial institutions can formulate more favorable policies to increase the credit-keeping
incentive and strengthen the cooperation with core enterprises to promote the long-term
operation of supply chain finance. In this paper, the following aspects will be further
investigated in depth in the course of subsequent research. Firstly, we have used numerical
simulations to study the three-party game, which will be more convincing if we collect
enough data to support them with real cases. Secondly, the operation process of supply
chain finance is disturbed by many complex random factors, and the explanation of random
factors in this paper is not comprehensive enough. Finally, we have limited the financing
process of supply chain finance to the pledged receivables financing model and only
considered three participants, namely financial institutions, core enterprises, and MSMEs,
and more complex scenarios can be considered in the next study.
