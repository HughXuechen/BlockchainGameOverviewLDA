Non-fungible tokens (NFT): a safe and effective
way to prevent plagiarism in scientific publishing
Hamid Reza Saeidnia and Brady D. Lund
Introduction
Plagiarism and non-fungible token
Researchers make huge strides in
advancing essential knowledge. Those
achievements can save lives, change the
way we understand the world and
improve our quality of life. When a
researcher is ready to share this
knowledge, they prepare an academic
publication like a journal article,
proceedings paper or book chapter
(Murziqin et al., 2020). The long
process of creating and disseminating
new knowledge has reached its end and
recognition through reads and citations
will follow or so the researcher thinks.
Plagiarism, copying, theft of findings
are real risks that rob the researcher of
their deserved credit. Over the years,
laws and methods have been established
to prevent this from happening, which
were somewhat successful, but these
research misconduct issues still exist,
and each year a large number of
researchers’ scientific findings are used
immorally (Maurer et al., 2006).
Using new technologies, these
issues may be abated. New digital
technologies, such as blockchain and its
unique product and non-fungible token
(NFT), can offer a different solution for
publishing digital files (Dowling, 2021).
The NFT, a digital asset that cannot be
reproduced, is a form of cryptography
based on blockchain technology (Wang
et al., 2021). In recent years, the market
for NFTs has grown rapidly. It was
originally developed as a token standard
for Ethereum, aiming to distinguish
tokens with distinctive signs (Dowling,
2021). This type of token can be bound
with virtual/digital properties as their
unique identifications (Hong et al.,
2019). With NFTs, all marked
properties can be freely traded with
customized values according to their
ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. (Dowling,
2021).
Probabilities considered: non-fungible
tokens in other areas
Non-fungibility renders each object
as a unique asset, which means that the
originally produced object – in this
case, a scholarly article and its content –
is protected as a unique asset, even if it
has not yet been published in a journal.
This feature has caused researchers and
experts to seek solutions for the use and
introduction of NFT technology in their
respective fields. One of the most
tangible applications of NFT can be
found in the world of art (Franceschet
et al., 2021; Kugler, 2021). With digital
art, artists and creators are able to
transform their digital artworks into
unique assets that can be bought, sold
and traded with effective ownership
transfers (Kugler, 2021). Using
cryptographic keys, each tokenized
artwork is created directly by the artist.
The work can be downloaded by
anyone, but without owning the
corresponding NFTs, it cannot be
owned or acquired. As a result,
ownership of the work is always
reserved (Kugler, 2021). Currently,
NFT is being studied by researchers in
many fields. The field in which NFT has
been most studied and paid attention to
is the field of the digital economy
(Hofstetter et al., 2022). The reason for
this is well known because the
importance of protecting financial and
monetary capital is very important. It
should be noted, however, that the
protection of assets such as the scientific
findings of a researcher in the form of a
digital object (text, audio, photo or
video) will have spiritual and material
importance, so pay attention to the high-
level protection of these resources. As a
result of the studies conducted so far on
NFT technology for its introduction and
use in various fields, it can be concluded
that each of these fields emphasizes the
importance of NFT’s non-fungible
features (Dowling, 2021; Wang et al.,
2021; Hong et al., 2019; Franceschet
et al., 2021; Kugler, 2021; Hofstetter
et al., 2022). Paying attention to the
issue that valuable digital objects can be
made non-fungible using NFT increases
the security of a digital object, an issue
that will definitely affect the future of
most professions.
New possibility
Non-fungible token technology may be
used to reduce plagiarism
Digital objects such as real images that
are taken with a camera or graphic images
that are created with the help of software,
the text of a book that has been written
(poem or novel), a sheet of a page that has
been scanned and has the ability to be
digital and/or the musical work that was
created and stored on a platform, all of
them can be a non-fungible work. Of
course, this characteristic of being non-
fungible is a personal matter and the
individual himself decides whether to
convert his work into a non-fungible
object or not. The decision to be non-
fungible can also be true for scientific
writing and scientific findings. Imagine
that the scientific findings of a study that
the author recognizes make them a non-
fungible property. It can be said with this
method that the uniqueness, non-fungible
and non-stealing characteristics of the
author’s scientific findings will be
guaranteed.
Currently, digital object identifiers
(DOI) are used to identify academic,
professional and government information
such as journal articles, research reports,
data sets and official publications (Liu,
2021). A DOI is a fixed identifier or
category used to uniquely identify various
objects, developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (Liu,
2021). With DOI, you can identify and
record an object (e.g. an article) as a first-
class entity, with a unique code that will
18 LIBRARY HI TECH NEWS Number 2 2023, pp. 18-19, VC Emerald Publishing Limited, 0741-9058, DOI 10.1108/LHTN-12-2022-0134
http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/LHTN-12-2022-0134
never change (Prodi and Out, 2022).
Uniform resource identifiers (URL) are
commonly used in DOI metadata to
describe objects (Liu, 2021). In this case,
why do we need NFT? There is probably
a question in your mind about this. We
need to understand how NFT works to
answer this question.
Essentially, NFTs are created
through a blockchain-based process
called minting. The minting process
involves creating a new block, verifying
the NFT information with a validator
and recording the information. In this
process, intelligent metadata is often
incorporated that assigns ownership and
manages the transferability of NFTs
(Dowling, 2021; Wang et al., 2021;
Shaarma, 2022). As a result of this brief
overview of how NFT works, two of its
most important features, that is, the use
of blockchain and intelligent metadata,
are very important, because
identification like DOI does not use
blockchain or intelligent metadata.
Certainly, with blockchain, NFT creates
a more secure platform and provides
more ownership details on the
intelligent metadata than other identifier
codes (such as DOI and URL).
Another thing that can be noted is that,
unlike the DOI that is given to an entire
document, NFT can be given to any part of
the article that the author wants, for
example, one NFT to figures, one to the
statistical data and one to the main
findings. It is very attractive and
interesting to imagine that a publisher can
offer an author’s scientific article with the
author’s personal signature as intelligent
metadata or any special proprietary feature
such as a password or a logo.
Conclusion
From this paper, we can conclude that
by using NFT technology to prevent
plagiarism, both publishers and authors
(researchers) will benefit. Large publishers
can use NFTs as a basis for a new structure
in the publication of scientific findings and
results. With this new structure, scientists
could create unique scientific discoveries
and prevent their own findings from being
stolen.
