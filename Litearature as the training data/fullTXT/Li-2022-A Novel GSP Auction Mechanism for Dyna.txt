Abstract—Bitcoin is gaining ground in recent years. In the Bitcoin system,miners provide computing power to confirm transactions in
pursuit of transaction fees, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. This process is in essence analogous
to online ad auctions, where advertisers bid for more prominent ad slots. Therefore, inspired by ad auction research, we propose to apply
the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auctionmechanism in the dynamic confirmation game on Bitcoin transactions. Our model is
targeted to deal with the problems caused by instability and low efficiency in the currently-adoptedGeneralized First Price (GFP) auction
model in Bitcoin confirmation games. Besides, we use the “rank-by-cost” rule to replace the “rank-by-fee” rule, where each transaction’s
cost is calculated by the user-submitted fee and the waiting time. Aiming to probe users’ equilibrium strategy, we first discuss theGSP
gamewith complete information under synchronous submissions, and show that it has the Locally Envy-Free equilibrium. Then, we study
the GSP gamewith incomplete information under asynchronous submissions, and define two types of strategies, i.e., the Farsighted
Balanced (FB) strategy and the Instant Balanced (IB) strategy. The FB strategy is in line with users’ practical needs of determining fees so
as tomaximize the long-term payoffs; however it cannot generate a stable equilibrium. Alternatively, the IB strategy focuses on the instant
payoff maximization, and if all users follow the IB strategy, their equilibrium fees can finally converge to a stable profile. Finally, we design
computational experiments to validate our theoretical models and analysis. Our research findings indicate that this novel GSP
mechanism is superior to the currently adopted GFPmechanism. Besides, the convergence of the GSP game under the IB strategy has
also been illustrated by the computational experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION
OWING to the desirable features of peer-to-peer decentrali-
zation, trustlessness, tamper-resistance, anonymity and
auditability [1], [2], [3], blockchain technology has attracted
intensive research interests andwitnessedphenomenal devel-
opment in recent years [4], [5]. The most well-known block-
chain system is Bitcoin, which generates an online economy
of multi-billions of dollars [6], [7], [8]. Bitcoin uses the Naka-
moto consensus protocol to secure and update its underlying
ledger of linked blocks [9]. Typically, new blocks are created
via miners repeatedly solving puzzles, that is, to find a spe-
cific random number utilizing a brute force approach. This
process is calledmining [10]. The miner (individual or group)
winning the mining competition has the right to confirm
transactions packaged by him/her and record them into the
newblock. Then, the blockwill be appended to themain chain
of previously agreed blocks, and the miner will get paid the
block reward (i.e., 12.5 bitcoins currently) and transaction fees
[11], [12]. In this process, transaction fees play the key role as
the economic incentive to stimulate miners contributing their
computing power to mine blocks and confirm transactions
[13], [14]. As a result, revenue-maximizing miners will pre-
ferentially confirm those transactions with higher fees [3],
forcing users to increase their transaction fees for faster confir-
mation, or otherwise queue and wait for a longer time. Since
both the Bitcoin block generation rate and the block size are
limited, the transaction confirmation rate is also restricted,
which causes fierce competitions among users and in turn
high required fees, especially in case of transaction surge.
Therefore, there is a critical need in the individual-level
for users to optimize their transaction fees, and also in the
system-level for Bitcoin blockchain to improve its transaction
fee auction mechanism, with the aim of reducing the inflat-
ing transaction fees and enhancing the system efficiency.
However, the unique features of Bitcoin transaction confir-
mation game make the Bitcoin transaction fee management
very challenging. Different from the traditional dynamic
game, currently Bitcoin fees should be decided by users
simultaneously with their transaction submissions, to com-
pete for the perishable block space rather than storable
objects. Once fees are determined, it is typically impossible
for users to make the real-time adjustment. However, the
unconfirmed transactions will continue to participate in the
following games for each block until they are confirmed
finally. This setting endowers the blockchain-powered
Bitcoin transaction confirmation game with the unique char-
acteristics of “dynamic environment coupled with static
strategies”. As such, users are required to be farsighted
when determining the optimal fees to maximize the long-
term payoffs gained overmultiple rounds of games.

Currently, a large majority of Bitcoin transactions are proc-
essed in a pipelinewith the ranking rule defined by the “rank-
by-fee” mechanism and the pricing rule defined by the “pay-
at-bid” mechanism, which is known as “Generalized First
Price (GFP)” auction [15], [16], [17]. That is: transactions with
higher fees will be confirmed first and users need to pay their
submitted fees tominers.
From the perspective of users, the simple rule of GFP
mechanism will lead users to pay unnecessarily high fees to
maintain a desirable rank of their transactions. Generally,
the higher is the required transaction fee, the longer a trans-
action could reside in the memory pool before being consid-
ered dormant [18]. In particular, when the memory pool
encounters transaction congestions, users need to pay extra
high fees for faster confirmation [19], which will partially
weaken the enthusiasm of users to submit fees [20]. Transac-
tion fees usually account for only a small percentage of the
bitcoins transferred by transactions; however, it is possible
that transaction fees might reach or even exceed the trading
bitcoins, especially in micro-payment scenarios [21]. For
this consideration, the exorbitant transaction fees resulting
from the GFP mechanism will lead to transaction fee infla-
tion and thus harm users’ experience [22], [23].
From the perspective of miners, the unstable fee gener-
ated by the GFPmechanism cannot guarantee reliable incen-
tives for them to keep mining as well as confirming
transactions. The GFP mechanism has been proven to be
unstable in dynamic scenarios, because it encourages ineffi-
cient investments in gaming the system [24]. Under certain
conditions, users will be engaging in cyclical fee adjust-
ments, and equilibrium fees may follow a cyclical pattern
with price-escalating phases interrupted by price-collapsing
phases [25]. As such, it generates volatile prices that in turn
cause allocative inefficiencies. In general, the Bitcoin system
should have simple, practical fee mechanism designs to
encourage miners to provide suitable security guarantees
against cheating [16]. However, the current Bitcoin fee mar-
ket has failed to yield stable revenues for miners, because the
current fee mechanism cannot keep users’ rational behaviors
aligned with the goal of paying enough fees (i.e., buying
enough security) for the entire system [17] and lead to the
absence of strategy equilibrium of the GFPmechanism [15].
The market practice in the Bitcoin system has also proven
the existence of the above-mentioned problems resulting
from the GFP mechanism. First, the GFP mechanism causes
Bitcoin users to pay unnecessarily high fees for faster confir-
mation. For example, in December 2017, the Bitcoin memory
pool was stuffed with over 180,000 transactions, which leads
to severe transaction congestion. Under that situation, users
even need to wait for several days to get their transaction
confirmed, and the transaction fee of a typical transaction
even costed up to 20 dollars.1 Besides, the empirical analysis
shows that transaction fees collected by each block are dis-
tinctly different and the daily transaction fees also have great
variance, which causes high volatility of miners’ revenues.
To conclude, the GFP mechanism fails to be a well-appli-
cable auction mechanism for the Bitcoin transaction confir-
mation game. In this paper, we are motivated to deal with
the above-mentioned problems resulting from the currently
adopted auction mechanism in the Bitcoin system, and pro-
pose a mechanism that incentivizes the non-strategic behav-
iors of users as well as guarantee the allocation efficiency of
the Bitcoin system.
Existing online ad auction practices, especially the spon-
sor search auctions (SSA), have provided us with good refer-
ence models. In the SSA market, advertisers bid for more
prominent ad slots, which is essentially similar to the Bitcoin
transaction fee auction process. The GFPmechanismwas the
original design for SSA since 1998, but has been replaced by
the Generalized Second Price (GSP) mechanism due to the
obvious shortcomings revealed by the market practice,
which is introduced by Google in 2002. Each year, Google
earns over 90 percent of the revenues from the keyword auc-
tions on the GSP basis. Nowadays, almost all the online ad
auctions, including SSA, real-time bidding and header bid-
ding, etc., adopt the GSP mechanism, and it has created a
considerably large global market of more than 110 billion
dollars in 2019. 2 The GSP mechanism has been proved to be
much more user-friendly and less susceptible to gaming,
and thus is more stable and has higher allocative efficiency
[24], [26], [27]. Inspired by the evolvement of the SSAmarket
from theGFPmechanism to theGSPmechanism,we propose
to apply the GSP mechanism in the Bitcoin system. Actually,
it can be tailored to the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin
transaction fee auction. GSP insists that users offer a single
fee for each transaction; consequently, even though users
participate in the multi-objective game, their valuations can
be properly represented by one-dimensional types [24]. Dif-
ferent from online ad auctions, one fee per transaction can be
sufficiently expressive to fully convey users’ preferences,
because they need to independently determine the transac-
tion fee for each transaction.
In early stages of Bitcoin, 50 KB out of 1 MB in each block
was reserved for the priority transactions without fees, and
these priority transactions’ ranks are mainly determined by
the waiting time.3 That means the transaction confirmation
are conducted in two separate pipelines, where one pipeline
is for transactions with fees, and the other pipeline is for pri-
ority transactions without fees. However, with the average
transaction size growing, the reserved 50 KB turns out to be
insufficient to deal with the confirmation of those priority
transactions. Besides, since Bitcoin Core v0.12 is launched,
the priority rule is no longer performed by default.4 Then,
some of priority transactions deviate to submit fees aiming
to compete for better rank in the fee pipeline. If we keep the
ranking rule in the fee pipeline regulated uniformly by trans-
action fees, on the one hand, the priority rule will not work
any more, which is not in favor of the priority transactions’
benefits; on the other hand, transactions originally with asso-
ciated fees are faced with more fierce competition, which
will lead to those with low fees be ranked lower and thus
experience longer delay. Therefore, we consider to deal with
these two kinds of transactions through one uniform pipe-
line, and propose a new ranking mechanism incorporating
both transaction fees and thewaiting time.

Since studying the equilibria of a novelmechanism is often
necessary andmeaningful, we also try to study fee-determin-
ing strategies adopted byusers aiming tomaximize their pay-
offs in the GSP auction. We model the Bitcoin transaction
confirmation game as the multi-round game, explicitly con-
sidering the dynamic nature of the game environment. Our
analysis begins with the case of synchronous submissions,
then we connect it to the single-round static game described
by Edelman et al. [24], and prove the existence of Locally
Envy-Free equilibrium under the setting of complete infor-
mation. Further, we proceed to discuss the case of asynchro-
nous submissions, and show that if all users follow the
newly-defined Instant Balanced Strategy, the gamewill even-
tually converge to a fixed equilibrium fee profile.
To summarize, our major contributions in this paper are
to propose a novel GSP mechanism for Bitcoin transaction
fee auctions, where transactions are ranked by costs instead
of submitted fees; and also to study its equilibrium strategy.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 establishes
the basic GSP auction model for the transaction confirma-
tion game. Then, we discuss users’ equilibrium fee strategies
under synchronous submissions in Section 4 and asynchro-
nous submissions in Section 5, respectively. Section 6 con-
ducts computational experiments to validate our theoretical
models and analysis. Section 7 summarizes this paper and
discusses the futurework.
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
Currently, the research efforts devoted to understanding the
transaction fee auction in the Bitcoin system are still quite
limited. In view that the fixed transaction fee is equivalent
to setting a maximum block size instead [28], the auction-
based mechanism could be a better choice. Lavi et al. [17]
argued that Bitcoin’s current fee market does not extract
revenue well for miners when blocks are not congested.
Also, according to Houy [28], if transaction fees are totally
determined by a decentralized market and the maximum
block size is not constrained, transaction fees will eventually
go to zero and miners will not have sufficient incentives to
keep mining, and hence to keep Bitcoin viable. Huberman
et al. [11] analyzed the implied congestion queueing game,
calculated each user’s trade-off between transaction fees
and delay costs, and concluded that each user’s equilibrium
transaction fee equals the externality imposed by his/her
transaction. Thus, equilibrium transaction fees coincide
with the payments that result from selling the priority of
service in a VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction.
For the fee mechanism design in the Bitcoin transaction
confirmation game, there are only limited studies. Lavi et al.
[17] proposed two alternative auction mechanisms: the
monopolistic price mechanism, and the random sampling
optimal price mechanism. They proved that the monopolis-
tic price mechanism extracts revenue better from users. Yao
[16] further proved that the monopolistic price mechanism is
nearly incentive compatible for any independently identi-
cally distribution as the number of users grows large. Basu
et al. [15] proposed an alternative fee settingmechanism, and
proved that it is free from manipulation as the number of
users increases. However, they ignored the dynamic feature
of the Bitcoin fee auctions. Our previous work on the GSP
auction mechanism in the static full-information Bitcoin
transaction confirmation game has proven that it is superior
to the currently adopted GFP mechanism in formulating sta-
ble fee level and improving transaction confirmation effi-
ciency [29].
In theoretical researches, multiple advantages of the GSP
mechanism have already been confirmed and documented.
Conceived as a natural extension of the Vickrey-Clarke-
Groves (VCG) auction, GSP allows bidders to pay at themin-
imum price that can maintain the current rank [30], and it is
simple and works reasonably well [24]. Moreover, the GSP
mechanism is much more user-friendly and less susceptible
to gaming compared to the GFP mechanism, and thus is
more stable and has higher allocative efficiency [24], [26],
[31], [32]. It is well known that user’s valuation on each trans-
action is very critical in the transaction fee auction. However,
GSP is not incentive-compatible, and it has no guarantee that
users submit their true valuations. As such, under the GSP
mechanism, users are forced to undertake the complicated
task of choosing a fee strategy. The first economic analysis of
GSP is formulated by Edelman et al. [24] and Varian [33], and
they proposed the Locally Envy-Free Equilibrium and the
Symmetric Nash Equilibrium for the GSP auction with com-
plete information, respectively. In both equilibria, the
bidder’s position and payment are equal to those in the dom-
inant-strategy equilibrium of VCG auctions, respectively.
VCG is a more theoretically effective mechanism encourag-
ing bidders to bid on their true valuations. However, it is
very hard to apply the VCGmechanism into the practice due
to its high computing complexity, especially for the multi-
object auction scenarios [34]. As such, GSP surpasses VCG to
become themainstream auctionmechanism in practice.
Considering the good applicability of the GSP auction
model to the Bitcoin transaction confirmation game, as well
as its advantages proven in both the theoretical research
and the online auction practice, we believe that employing
the GSP auction model to replace the currently adopted
GFP auction model is a timely and meaningful research
innovation for the Bitcoin system. In the following sections,
we will establish the GSP model for Bitcoin transaction fee
auctions, and also analyze users’ equilibrium decisions on
transaction fees.
3 THE BASIC MODEL
Typically, the basic process of the transaction confirmation
game in the Bitcoin system is described by Fig. 1. At the
beginning of each round, new transactions pending for con-
firmation with associated fees are submitted simultaneously
by users, and they will enter the memory pool. Then, miners
rank them according to the predetermined rule, and those
ranked at top positions will be confirmed and recorded into
the new block. Correspondingly, the confirmed transactions
should transfer a certain amount of fees to miners. Mean-
while, those transactions failing to be confirmed will stay in
the memory pool and continue to participate in the next
round of game.
We begin with establishing the basic GSP auction model
for the Bitcoin transaction confirmation game. Notations of
this paper are listed in Table 1.

Suppose there are n risk-neutral users participating in
the dynamic game. The dynamic games are conducted mul-
tiple rounds at a fixed time interval following the block gen-
eration rate. We consider these games adopting the GSP
mechanism. Suppose each user only submits one transac-
tion at each round. For the transaction iðtÞ submitted by the
user i in the round t, it is usually accompanied by a fee bi,
aiming to win a desired position in the block with the expec-
tation to get the transaction confirmed. Suppose the valua-
tion of the transaction is vi. For simplicity, we assume that
all transactions have the same fixed size. Accordingly, the
number of positions in one block per round is exogenously
determined as x.
We propose to rank the unconfirmed transactions with
the cost ~bi, which is calculated by their associated fees and
the waiting time. Here, the time cost is incorporated to com-
pensate users waiting until their transactions are confirmed.
Due to the rule of rank-by-cost, even the users cannot afford
the fee required by the available position at the submission
round, they still can resort to the higher costs accumulated
from long waiting time and win a position in the future
rounds. If several transactions have the same cost, they are
ranked randomly. In the round t 2 T ¼ f1; 2; :::g, we calcu-
late the cost by the equation
~bti ¼ bi þ bwt
i; (1)
where b is the weighted factor and wt
i is the waiting time.
Here, wt
i ¼ ðt� tiÞt, and t is the fixed time interval of each
round. Generally, we have b � 0. Without loss of generality,
we do not give the detailed formulations of b. However, we
can establish different formulations according to the specific
design targets without affecting the soundness of our theo-
retical analysis. For example, we can determine the fixed b
to make sure all the retained transactions can be compen-
sated equally according to their waiting time, or we can set
that b increases with the waiting time getting longer to
avoid over-long retention of unconfirmed transactions.
Accordingly, the top position is allocated to the transac-
tion with the highest cost, the second position to the transac-
tion with the second highest cost, down to the position
minfnt; xg, where nt is the number of unconfirmed transac-
tions participating in the round t.
Generally, the transaction’s valuation to the user does not
depend on the position in which it is confirmed and then
recorded to the blockchain, yet the position does influence
the confirmation sequence and the user’s waiting time of
completing the confirmation in each block. In view of this,
we consider that being ranked in different positions within
a round will result in different “internal” temporal utility,
and we denote the “internal” temporal utility of the position
j 2 X ¼ f1; . . . ; xg as aj. In the Bitcoin transaction confirma-
tion game, positions are lined in descending order, and
higher positions correspond to higher “internal” temporal
utility. That is: for any j and jþ such that j < jþ, we have
aj > ajþ. Similarly, we do not give the detailed formulation
of the “internal” temporal utility; however, different formu-
lations can be established as long as the above condition is
satisfied, and they will not influence the correctness of the
following analysis in this paper.
In the round t, if the transaction is allocated to the posi-
tion j, the fee transferred to miners under the formulated
GSP mechanism is
pti ¼ pj;ti ¼ ~bjþ1;t
i � bwt
i; (2)
which represents theminimum fee that canmaintain the cur-
rent position. If the transaction does not win a position, there
is no need to pay any fee in this round. Besides, the uncon-
firmed transaction will continue to bid for an available posi-
tion with the originally submitted fee. For the special case of
x � nt, the last transaction’s payment px;t equals zero.
In the Bitcoin system, transactions are accomplished inde-
pendently, so the user needs to optimize the fee individually

establish the instant payoff function of the submission iðtÞ in
the round t as

Here, ti ¼ t represents that the transaction is confirmed in

In practice, Bitcoin transactions will eventually be con-
firmed. As such, users are committed to maximize their
long-term payoffs in the multi-round games, which can be
given as follows.

where 0 < d � 1 is the discount factor, representing the
“external” temporal externality as a result of the delayed
transaction confirmation.
In the following sections, we will discuss users’ equilib-
rium strategies in the cases of synchronous submissions
and asynchronous submissions.
4 SYNCHRONOUS SUBMISSIONS
First, we study the case that all users submit their transac-
tions in a certain round synchronously. The transaction con-
firmation process under this case is described in Fig. 2.
Here, we have v1 > ::: > vn and V ¼ fv1; ::; vng. Obviously,
all transactions’ ranks are determined in this round and will
not change any more, and they will be confirmed in order at
the rate x per round.
As it should be, the temporal utility of a specific position
at different round will be unequal. More formally:
a ¼ ða1; ::; ax;axþ1; ::; a2x; . . . ;aðt�1Þxþ1; . . . ;atx; :::Þ
¼ ða1; ::; ax; da1; . . . ; dax; . . . ; dt�1a1; . . . ; dt�1ax; :::Þ;
(5)
where, for any t, we have dtax > dtþ1a1.
If the submitted transactions exceed the available posi-
tions, i.e., nt > x;8t 2 T , the multi-round dynamic game
with complete information is equivalent to the single-round
static game with mx positions described in [24]. It has been
proven to have the Locally Envy-Free (LEF) Equilibrium,
where no user can improve the payoff through exchanging
fees with the one ranked just one position above him/her,
that is:
ajðvj � pjÞ � aj�1ðvj � pj�1Þ; 8i � tx: (6)
Consequently, the equilibrium fee strategy profile can be
described by the following recursive function:
b�i ¼

vi � ai

ðvi � biþ1Þ; if i 2 f2; . . . ;mxg
vi; if i 2 fmxþ 1; . . . ; ng

(7)
In conclusion, under the case of synchronous submis-
sions, our formulated dynamic GSP game with complete
information has the LEF Equilibrium, which results in the
payments identical to that of the VCG mechanism.
In what follows, we give an example to illustrate the
aforementioned case.
Example 1. Let x ¼ 2, d ¼ 0:9, a1 ¼ 1, and a2 ¼ 0:95. We
consider the game takes 2 rounds, and 5 users submit trans-
actions pending for confirmation at the very beginning of
the game. Suppose these 5 users’ valuations are v1 ¼ 10,
v2 ¼ 9, v3 ¼ 6, v4 ¼ 5, and v5 ¼ 2, respectively. Then, this
case is equivalent to that 5 users compete for 4 positions,
which have the temporal utility of a1 ¼ 1, a2 ¼ 0:95,
a3 ¼ 0:9, and a4 ¼ 0:855, respectively.
If all users follow the LEF strategy, their equilibrium fees
will be b�1 2 ð2:685; 10�; b�2 ¼ 2:685; b�3 ¼ 2:353; b�4 ¼ 2:15; b�5 ¼ 2,
and the corresponding payoffs will be R�
1 ¼ 7:315; R�
2 ¼
6:315; R�
3 ¼ 3:465; R�
4 ¼ 2:565; R�
5 ¼ 0. Accordingly, transac-
tions of the user 1 and 2 will be confirmed at the first round
and transactions of the user 3 and 4 will be confirmed at the
second round; while the user 5 cannot get his/her transac-
tion confirmed in this two-round game. Under the LEF
strategy, no user can improve payoffs by deviating from
his/her equilibrium fee.
In addition, it is easy to prove all users’ paid fees equal
the counterpart under the VCG mechanism.
5 ASYNCHRONOUS SUBMISSIONS
In this section, we discuss the transaction confirmation game
under the case of asynchronous submissions, and its process
is shown in Fig. 3. We suppose a set of n users keep partici-
pating in the multi-round games, and each user submits one
new transaction in each round. Identical to the former case,
transactions will be confirmed in order at the rate x per
round. Assume that each user has the identical valuation of
all submitted transactions, i.e., vti ¼ vi. With the knowledge
of their own private valuations, users independently deter-
mine the associated fee for each transaction. At the end of
each round, users’ fees, costs aswell as the position allocative

results will be made public. Denote the weighted valuation
as ~vti ¼ vi þ bðt� tiÞ, and ~vt1 > ::: > ~vt
nt
.
Under this case, the number of engaged transactions in
the round t is
nt ¼ nþ ðt� 1Þðn� xÞ; (8)
among which, the number of new submissions and old sub-
missions are nt
d ¼ n and nt
o ¼ ðt� 1Þðn� xÞ, respectively.
Notice that for any t, we have nt > x.
Generally, the old userswith t < t and t � t cannot adjust
the fee any more, but their costs ~bt keep increasing due to the
prolonged waiting time. For the modeling purpose, we sup-
pose at most one old submission can be confirmed in each
round. Under this setting, if a new submission wins the last
available position x while the position xþ 1 is taken by an
old submission at a certain round, it is possible to have
bxi < b̂xþ1. If we keep following the rule of paying at the sec-
ond highest fee, the user will need to pay higher than his/
her submitted fee. To avoid this situation, we alternatively
let pxi ¼ bidþ1, where bidþ1 is the submitted fee of the new sub-
mission ranked just second to it.
In this paper, we are motivated to make the aforemen-
tioned assumptions for the following reasons: 1) In our game-
theoretical research, we need to assume a fixed set of partici-
pants to theoretically simplify the equilibrium analysis. This
kind of assumption is common in other game-theoretical anal-
ysis. Also, the equilibrium analysis of the multi-player game
is inherently complex, especially in the multi-round dynamic
games. These motivate us to formulate the assumptions,
including the fixed number of arriving and confirmed trans-
actions as well as the repeated valuations in each round, to
simplify the theoretical analysis. 2) As mentioned above, Bit-
coin users should submit the deterministic fees and be unable
to make further adjustments on submitted fees any more. In
view of this, we focus on the strategy analysis of new submis-
sions, and set the assumption of ”at most one old submission
can be confirmed at each round” for simplicity. Actually, if
we relax these assumptions, the theoretical equilibriumanaly-
sis will be much more complex and intractable. 3) The analy-
sis on real-world data generated by the Bitcoin system also
indicates that the number of arriving and confirmed transac-
tions can be relatively stable during a certain period. Espe-
cially, each Bitcoin block has the upper-limit, which restricts
the number of transactions that can be recorded into one
block; as the average block size keeps stable during a certain
period, it is reasonable for us to consider a fixed confirmation
rate. 4) As Bitcoin transactions are basically transfer transac-
tions, it is natural to use the transaction amount to represent
the transaction’s value to the user [29]. In practice, excluding
those outliers with large transaction amount, the distribution
of transaction amounts for each block can be very similar over
a period of time. The real-world transactiondata onDecember
21, 2017 are good examples of these observations.
5.1 Farsighted Strategy
As mentioned in Section 3, users usually view high of the
long-run payoffs. The difficulty lies in the prediction of the
new submissions’ fees not only of the next round but also
multiple later rounds. It is the most simple but a natural way
for them to consider competitive users’ fee decisions will be
same with that at the immediate previous round. Based on
these considerations, we give the following definition.
Definition 1 (Farsighted Best-Response (FBR) Strategy).
A farsighted best-response strategy is to determine a fee for the
transaction newly submitted in the round t by the user i, with
the purpose to maximize its total payoff over the following
rounds, on the basis of retained old transactions’ fixed fees bt�io
as well as the predicted new competitive fees b�id .
Formally, given the competitive fees bt�i ¼ ðbt�io
; b�idÞ, the
farsighted best-response strategy is bt�i 2 argmaxbi Riðbi; bt�iÞ.
The FBR strategy is applicable to the situation that there is
one old transaction getting confirmed in each round. First,
users in the round t utilize the FBR strategy to target the opti-
mal position for their new submissions. With consideration
of the payoff over the followingmultiple rounds, the optimal
position will no longer necessarily within the round t. Given
bt�i, the new submission has the targeted optimal position lt
�
,
representing the l�th position in the round t�.
If t� > t, it means that the user chooses to rank lower
than the position x in the rounds ½t; t� � 1�. Since there is
only one old submission getting confirmed in each round,
we can deduce that lt
��1 ¼ xþ 1. However, the backward
recurrence is not feasible for the former rounds ½t; t� � 2�.
Getting the position l� ¼ xþ 2 in the round t� � 2 cannot
guarantee a position l� in the round t�, because the newly
coming submissions in the next round t� � 1 may take up
his/her desired position xþ 1. In conclusion, it is very hard
for the user to target a long-dated optimal position by the
FBR strategy. As such, we consider users only target their
optimal positions among those in the round t and tþ 1.
Accordingly, the payoff function will be
Ri ¼ rti þ drtþ1
i : (9)
Under this setting, the user having t� ¼ tþ 1 should target
the position l� ¼ xþ 1 in the round t.
After targeting the optimal position, then the user needs
to determine a proper fee b
0t 2 ðpl�;ti ; pl
��1;t
i Þ for it. In order to
figure out which specific fee the user should choose, we
learn from [31] to further propose the following strategy.
Definition 2 (Farsighted Balanced Strategy). The far-
sighted balanced (FB) strategy first targets the optimal position
l� ¼ argmax

and then chooses a proper fee b

conditions:
If l� � x, we choose b

(12)
As for the special case of l� ¼ 1, we pre-define that a0 ¼ 2a1,
and then the user will choose b

i ¼ ðvi þ p1i Þ=2.
Then, we analyze the property of the FB strategy.

Theorem 1. The FB strategy cannot lead to a stable assignment
for our formulated dynamic GSP auctions of transaction fees.
Proof. If the user i targets the position xþ 1 as the optimal
position, the submitted fee b
0t
i can be figured out following
the definition of the FB strategy. Under the above assump-
tions, once the original fee b
0t
i is determined, the cost in the
round tþ 1 is also fixed as b
0t
i þ bw. Then, the user can pre-
dict its position ltþ1 in the round tþ 1. Accordingly, we
obtain the following conditions:
ajvi � bjþ1 < dðal;tþ1vi � blþ1;tþ1 þ bwÞ; 8j 2 X
+
dbw > ajvi � bjþ1 � dðal;tþ1vi � blþ1;tþ1Þ; 8j 2 X
+
dbw > max
j2X
ðajvi � bjþ1Þ � dðal;tþ1vi � blþ1;tþ1Þ:
(13)
If there exists the competitive transactions�i also satis-
fying the above condition described in Equation (13), they
will also target the position xþ 1 as the optimal one and
submit a fee as b
0t
�i. If b
0t
i < b
0t
�i, the user iwill win the posi-
tion, however, this assignment is not stable, because the
competitive users have incentives to submit the fee
slightly under b
0t
i to swap the position with�i, which will
further push the user i to reduce the fee. The adjustment
of fees will be conducted alternately between these com-
petitors until it reaches the following threshold _b.
_b ¼min

ðb0ti j max

ðajvi � bjþ1Þ � dðal;tþ1vi � blþ1;tþ1 þ bwÞÞ:
(14)
As per the predetermined setting of the dynamic
games, with the game continuing, there will be more
retained old submissions and their costs will increase as
well. Then, it is possible to have _b � ~bxþ2. If _b < ~bxþ2, these
users cannot successfully get the targeted position xþ 1
and have incentives to re-target a new optimal position;
and if _b ¼ ~bxþ2, a slightly higher fee is required for the
position xþ 1, but it will trigger new round of alternate
adjustment of their strategies. tu
The following example will provide a more illustrative
explanation of the property of the FB strategy.
Example 2. Let x ¼ 2, d ¼ 1, a1 ¼ 1, and a2 ¼ 0:95. We
consider there are 4 users submitting transactions pending
for confirmation at each round, and their valuations are
V ¼ f10; 7; 5; 2g. Suppose the time interval of each round is
600 seconds, and we set b ¼ 0:002.
Set fees of old submissions at the immediate previous
round as b ¼ f10; 7; 5; 2g, then the two transactions with fees
equal to 5 and 2 will continue participating in the game, and
their costs at the current roundwill be ~b3o ¼ 6:2 and ~b4o ¼ 3:2.
Consider all new submissions with fees determined by
the FB strategy, users first target the optimal position and
then determine the proper fees.
If users prefer their transactions to be confirmed at the cur-
rent round, their equilibrium fees will be b�1d ¼ 8:5; b�2d ¼
6:24; b�3d ¼ 5; b�4d ¼ 2, and the corresponding payoffs will be
r�1d ¼ 3:76; r�2d ¼ 0:76; r�3d ¼ 0; r�4d ¼ 0.
If they are farsighted to maximize the long-term payoffs,
the user 1 and 2will target the position 3 at the current round
as their optimal position, aiming to win the top 2 positions at
the next round. Following the FB strategy, their fees will be
b1d ¼ 6:01; b2d ¼ 5:86; b3d ¼ 5; b4d ¼ 2, and the corresponding
payoffs will beR1d ¼ 3:933; R2d ¼ 1:14; R3d ¼ 0; R4d ¼ 0.
However, this equilibrium is not stable, because the user
1 has incentives to adjust his/her fee to 5:8 < b1d < 5:86,
aiming to get a higher payoff generated from the next
round, which will further leads to the user 2’s adjustment. It
is easy to find that their alternate adjustment of fees cannot
converge in the interval ð5:8; 5:86Þ. The threshold _b is 5,
however this fee cannot guarantee a successful confirmation
in the next round.
5.2 Instant Strategy
In view of the shortcomings of the FB strategy, we then pro-
pose an alternative strategy which deals with users’ instant
payoff in their submission round. Because most users can
get transactions confirmed in the submission round in prac-
tice and they view high of instant payoff. Similarly, we first
introduce the instant best-response (IBR) strategy, and its
definition is given as follows.
Definition 3 (Instant Best-Response Strategy). An instant
best-response (IBR) strategy is to determine a fee for the trans-
action newly submitted in the round t by the user i, so as to
maximize its instant payoff in this round, on the basis of
retained old submissions’ fixed fees bt�io
as well as the predicted
new competitors’ fees bt�id
.
Formally, given bt�i ¼ ðbt�io
; bt�id
Þ, the IBR strategy is
b�ti 2 argmaxbi r
t
iðbi; bt�iÞ.
Since the farsighted decision is very challenging for users,
it is reasonable for them to alternatively determine the fee so
as to maximize the instant payoffs in the submission round.
The basic idea behind the IBR strategy matches well with
this consideration. Owing to the tremendous difficulty to
make fee predictions, it is natural for users to use public out-
comes of the immediate previous round to serve as the pre-
dictor of newly submitted competitive fees. Accordingly,
there is bt�id

; . . . ; bt�1

Þ.
Given bt�i, if the user i utilizes the IBR strategy to target
the position j�, the submitted fee will be b
0t 2 ðpj�;ti ; pj
��1;t
i Þ.
Similarly, with the purpose to determine the specific fee for
the user, we further propose the following strategy.
Definition 4 (Instant Balanced Strategy). The instant bal-
anced (IB) strategy first targets the optimal position
j� ¼ argmax
j�jt�1

Then it chooses a proper fee b

For the special case of j� ¼ 1, we assume that a0 ¼ 2a1, and
the user will then determine b
0t ¼ ðvi þ p1i Þ=2.
First, we study the case that there is no old submis-
sion can be confirmed at any round. Then, the competitive

submissionswill only include the newly submitted ones, that
is bt�i ¼ bt�id
. Under this case, the multi-round dynamic
games described in this section will be equivalent to the
repeated game with a fixed set of users formulated by Cary
et al. [31]. Accordingly, we have the following remark:
Remark 1. When there is no old submission can be con-
firmed in any round, if the dynamic GSP games have all
new submissions with fees determined by the IB strategy,
it will reach a fixed point, where miners allocate x posi-
tions in order of decreasing values. Moreover, the equilib-
rium fee profile is

vi � ai

ðvi � biþ1Þ; if i 2 f2; . . . ; xg
vi; if i 2 fxþ 1; :::g:
8><
>: (17)
Then, we consider that there is one old submission con-
firmed in the position g � x in the round t. Under this case,
users need to re-target the optimal position ĵ� for each new
submission, on the basis of the original optimal position j�
in the case of bt�i ¼ bt�id
.
Lemma 1. Users will re-target the optimal positions for new sub-
missions according to the following equation
ĵ� ¼

j�; if j� ¼ g � 1; vi � aj� ~bg;t � agbgþ1;t

(18)
Proof. The newly submitted transaction with j� ¼ x will be
squeezed out of the position x and lose the game. Conse-
quently, the user will submit a fee equal to its valuation.
For the new submissionwith j� ¼ g, sticking to the orig-
inal optimal position will lead to a zero payoff; and for the
new submission with g < j�i � x� 1, the original optimal
position will be taken up by the one just ranked higher
than it. As such, the user should re-target a new optimal
position ĵ� lower than j� for the new submission with
g � j� � x� 1. Inwhat follows, we prove that ĵ� ¼ j� þ 1.

Following the same way, we can finally prove that
aj�þ1ðvi � bj
�þ1;tÞ > ajðvi � bj;tÞ; 8j 2 fj� þ 2; . . . ; xþ 1g:
(20)
The new submission with j� ¼ g � 1 is forced by ig;to to
pay more for j�. Then, the re-targeted optimal position
should be ĵ� 2 fj�; gg, because the lower position
g þ 1 � j � x needs to be won with the payment higher
than the case described in Remark 1. Since the fee of ig;to has
been determined in the previous rounds, the position allo-
cation in the round t will be determined by the new sub-
mission. The user prefers the position j� to g if and only if
aj� ðvi � ~bg;tÞ � agðvi � bgþ1;tÞ

:
(21)
The new submission with 1 � j� < g � 1 has no
incentive to deviate from j�, because the required pay-
ment for the position g � 1 � j � x has been raised by
the cost of ig;to . As such, its associated fee keeps identical
to that calculated by the Equation (17). tu
Theorem 2. When there is one old submission getting confirmed
from a certain round, if the GSP games have all new submis-
sions with fees determined by the IB strategy, it will converge
to a fixed point, where the equilibrium fee profile is as follows.

Proof. Since the number of retained old submissions grows
with the rate n� x while the number of confirmed old
submissions keeps to be 1 from a certain round, the high-
est cost and weighted valuations of these retained old
submissions necessarily get higher as the game continues.
Eventually, this will finally lead to the improvement of g
to the first position.
According to Lemma 1, if g ¼ 1, we have ĵ� ¼ j� þ 1.
As such, the game will reach a fixed point that these
users winning all positions in the set X form a stable set,
where the first position belongs to the old submission,
and the positions f2; . . . ; xg are allocated in order of
decreasing valuations of newly submitted transactions in
that round.
Moreover, since the old submission fails to be con-
firmed in the round to, the equilibrium fee will be equal
to its valuation. As for new submissions winning posi-
tions in the setX, their equilibrium fees can be calculated
according to the Equation (17). tu
Corollary 1.When there is one old submission getting confirmed
from a certain round, users’ equilibrium payment profile in our
proposed dynamic GSP games can be described as follows

Proof. According to the equation (2), we can simply calcu-
late the equilibrium payment of users getting positions
f2; . . . ; x� 1g as b�iþ1.
Besides, the user obtaining the position x will pay at
b�idþ1 according to the setting in Section 5.
Since we propose to rank transactions by their costs,
and the equilibrium payment of the old submission get-
ting the first position is b�2 � bwt
1. However, because the
old submission is mainly beneficial from the cumulative
waiting time to get the highest cost of this round, it is
possible that there is b�2 � bwt
1 < 0. If it happens, then
the user does not need to pay. tu
Through the following examples, we illustrate the prop-
erties of the IB strategy.
Example 3. Let x ¼ 2, d ¼ 0:9, a1 ¼ 1, and a2 ¼ 0:95. We
consider there are 4 users submitting transactions pending
for confirmation in each round, and their valuation set
is V ¼ f10; 7; 5; 2g. The time interval of each round is 600
seconds.
Suppose old submissions in the immediate previous
round t� 1 have fees as bt�1 ¼ f10; 7; 5; 2g, then the two
transactions with fees equal to 5 and 2 will continue to par-
ticipate in the game.
� First, we set b ¼ 0.
In the round t, the transaction fee auction will go on in
the group including not only the newly submitted transac-
tions but also the retained old submissions from the round
t� 1, and their weighted valuations are

Under this case, no old submissions can be ranked in top 2,

the first position, and the transaction 2ðtÞ will win the sec-
ond position, and they will be confirmed in this round.

In the round tþ 1, the participants include not only the

Under the case that one old submission gets confirmed, if
all users utilize the IB strategy, their equilibrium fees in this
round will be b�tþ3
d ¼ ð7:15; 7; 5; 2Þ: Then, the old submission
2ðtþ 2Þ will win the first position, and the new submission
1ðtþ 3Þwill win the second position.
When the game goes to the round tþ 6, the old transac-
tion with highest weighted valuations will be ranked at the
first place among all transactions. Then the multi-round
transaction confirmation gamewill converge to a fixed point,
where all users following the IB strategy will have the equi-
librium fees as b�d ¼ ð7:15; 7; 5; 2Þ.
6 EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we conduct computational experiments to
validate the aforementioned theoretical analysis. Computa-
tional experiments are the applicable method for the case

without perfect real-world data [14], [35]. It has been proven
that the work using synthetic data usually has no significant
difference when compared with real-data-based work by
data scientists [29]. We use the Bitcoin transaction data dur-
ing December 2017 as our experimental database, because
the amount of submitted transactions are of high demand,
and almost all the mined blocks are full during this period.
First, we investigate whether our formulated GSP mecha-
nism is more user-friendly and more stable compared to the
currently adopted GFP mechanism. We rank all transactions
in each block according to their costs ~b. Because the size s is
different for each real transaction, we take it into consider-
ation to define ~b ¼ b=sþ bw. However, we calculate the total
fee transferred by each transaction instead of the unit fee to
serve as the basis of comparative analysis on the GFP and
GSP mechanisms.
Since the difference of fees paid by users under the GSP
mechanism and GFP mechanism does not follow the normal
distribution, we use the Wilcoxon test to confirm whether
the difference of fees under these two mechanisms is signifi-
cant. We first assume that there is no difference between the
daily fees paid by users in the current GFP game and under
the GSP equilibrium, and theWilcoxon test results show that
Z ¼ �4:860 and the progressive significance (bilateral)
p ¼ 0:000, which confirms the significance of difference of
fees under these two mechanisms. The Wilcoxon test also
confirms the significant difference between the daily fees in
the current GFP game and under the GFP allocative results
in the GSP game.
During December 2017, the daily saved fees by the GSP
mechanism under the GFP allocative results and GSP equilib-
rium are shown in Fig. 4. In practice, the average daily trans-
action fee under the GFP mechanism is 616.7604 bitcoins
(BTC). Keeping the user-submitted fees and the existing allo-
cative results in the GFP game unchanged, the GSP mecha-
nism can lead to an average saving of 3.3251 BTC per day for
all winning users. If the dynamic transaction confirmation
game under the GSP mechanism can reach the equilibrium
described in Theorem 2, the daily saved fees for users will be
much higher, and it is up to 24.5985 BTC on average and can
even exceed 103 BTC (e.g., on December 22, 2017). The experi-
mental results confirm that the proposed GSP mechanism is
more user-friendly and can help Bitcoin users save fees.
Fig. 5 illustrates the daily difference on variance of paid
fees under GFP and GSP mechanism during December 2017.
From it, we can see that the variance of paid transaction fees
in the GFP game is 1.9464 on average, which is significantly
reduced by the GSP mechanism, especially when the GSP
game can reach the equilibrium by the IB strategy. Under the
GFP allocative results, the variance of transaction fees col-
lected in each block is reduced by 0.0144 BTC2 per day on
average; while the counterpart under the GSP equilibrium is
much higher and equal to 0.4511 BTC2 (i.e., 23.18 percent).
Besides, the reduced variance can even exceed 1.0000 on
some days, e.g., December 23-26. The experimental results
show that transaction fees are more averaged over multiple
blocks in the GSP game, which means the GSP game can
decrease the variability and increase the stability of miners’
revenues generated fromdifferent blocks.
Second, we endeavour to validate the theoretical conclu-
sion that the proposed GSP mechanism can achieve stable
equilibrium in the dynamic transaction fee auctions. With
this purpose, we design the following computational experi-
ments. In these experiments, we consider that 100 users
participate in transaction fee auctions under the case of asyn-
chronous submissions. Their valuations, initial fees, as well
as waiting time are randomly generated. Here, we relax the
assumptions in the computational experiments, including
variable valuation sets and unfixed number of old transac-
tion confirmation at each round. To ensure the reliability of
experiments, we run 1000 independent experiments with
randomly generated parameters.
Fig. 6 shows convergence of user-submitted fee by the IB
strategy in one set of computational experiments. This out-
come is a typical result of our computational experiments.
In this set, after 308 rounds of games, the associated fees of
all new submissions have reached the equilibrium profile
described in Theorem 2 in this paper.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Considering the unique features of transaction fee auctions
in the Bitcoin system, we propose a novel GSP auction
mechanism to tailor to its practical requirements of dealing
with the problems caused by the currently-used GFP mech-
anism, including unnecessarily high fees and instable equi-
librium fees.
In the proposedGSPmechanism,we incorporate the user-
submitted fee and the waiting time to formulate the cost as

the transaction rank basis. We first discuss the case of syn-
chronous submissions, and find that the dynamic GSP game
with complete information has the LEF Equilibrium. Then,
we study the case of asynchronous submissions, and define
two kinds of strategies to help users determine their optimal
fees, which are the FB strategy and the IB strategy. We then
show that although the FB strategy meets the requirements
of users in the Bitcoin system to make farsighted fee strate-
gies, it cannot lead to a stable equilibrium. Aiming to deal
with the shortcomings of the FB strategy, we further alterna-
tively define the IB strategy, and show that if all users utilize
the IB strategy, the dynamic transaction confirmation games
will converge to a fixed point and thus have the stable equi-
librium. Finally, our designed computational experiments
have proven that the formulated dynamic GSP game is more
user-friendly and stable, and can achieve the convergence
following the IB strategy.
Our research can not only provide good support for the
mechanism design of the Bitcoin transaction fee auction,
and help understand users’ transaction fee decisions, but
also support the transaction management in other block-
chain-powered systems.
One limitation of our theoretical analysis is the simplified
assumptions, which is the theoretical abstraction to real-
world auctions on Bitcoin transaction fees. Due to the
assumptions, our theoretical model can be applied to charac-
terize and explain the dynamic transaction fee auction prob-
lem under specific stable environments, e.g., in a settingwith
relatively stable set of users with fixed values. In the practical
Bitcoin system, however, the auction sessions are intrinsi-
cally complex. As such, we conduct computational experi-
ments in this research aiming at validating our model and
analysis via relaxing the assumptions, and we also plan to
extend our theoretical model in our future work to analyze
the auction game and its equilibrium in more complicated
dynamic environments.
