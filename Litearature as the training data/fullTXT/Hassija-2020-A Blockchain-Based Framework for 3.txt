Abstract—The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network is, where the
battery-powered vehicles provide energy to the power grid, is highly
emerging. A robust, scalable, and cost-optimal mechanism that can
support the increasing number of transactions in a V2G network is
required. Existing studies use traditional blockchain as to achieve
this requirement. Blockchain-enabled V2G networks require a high
computation power and are not suitable for micro-transactions due
to the mining reward being higher than the transaction value itself.
Moreover, the transaction throughput in the generic blockchain
is too low to support the increasing number of frequent transac-
tions in V2G networks. To address these challenges, in this paper,
a lightweight blockchain-based protocol called Directed Acyclic
Graph-based V2G network (DV2G) is proposed. Here blockchain
refers to any Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and not just the
bitcoin chain of blocks. A tangle data structure is used to record
the transactions in the network in a secure and scalable manner.
A game theory model is used to perform negotiation between the
grid and vehicles at an optimized cost. The proposed model does
not require the heavy computation associated to the addition of
the transactions to the data structure and does not require any
fees to post the transaction. The proposed model is shown to be
highly scalable and supports the micro-transactions required in
V2G networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
DUE TO a lack of non-renewable energy resources, revolu-
tionary changes are taking place in the energy sector in or-
der to generate renewable energy. Huge developments have been
recently witnessed in Renewable Energy Resources (RES), such
as wind and solar photovoltaic panels. The issue with RES is that
their power generation fluctuates as per the weather and climate
conditions, and the exact prediction of the amount of generated
energy is not easy. Thus, traditional power generators face un-
predictable fluctuations in their power demand due to the uncer-
tainty in RES. The smart grid is anticipated as a next-gen power
grid that can help distribution companies provide local resources
to their customers, to overcome this problem. With smart grids,
information can be exchanged between consumers and the grid,
and energy flow can take place between consumers and different
parts of the smart grid. In this context, Electric Storage Units
(ESUs) [1] are enabled using smart grids that store excess energy,
available at customers. Local neighborhood demands and other
internal demands for energy can be met using these storage units.
The smart grid makes the interaction between power sources that
are situated in different places possible. Since many consumers
are capable of generating energy, trading the excess amount of
energy with other consumers seems plausible. For example,
neighbor A can sell the surplus of clean, renewable energy
generated from the solar panel on his/her rooftop to neighbor B.
To meet the energy demand and to efficiently use the generated
renewable energy, it is important to generate possibilities of en-
ergy trading among all consumers and producers. Without such a
model, some consumers will continue to face energy deficiency,
and some producers will have to waste the extra generated energy
without any monetary benefits. The concept of Vehicle-to-Grid
(V2G) was recently introduced to solve these problems [2]. Also,
the Electric Vehicle (EV) [3] is emerging in the energy market,
which aims to ease the load imposed on the traditional grid by
applying such as Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and V2G. Here, V2G is
defined as the provision of energy and other necessary support
from an EV to the electric grid. Meanwhile, V2G can be seen
as one step ahead of smart charging. In V2G networks, EVs
use bi-directional charging and can sell/buy energy to/from the
grid depending on the situations [4], [5]. A V2G technological
scheme was introduced in Lombok and Utrecht to illustrate the
opportunities that EVs provide.
V2G is a suitable solution for better resource utilization and
revenue maximization, since vehicles remain parked for an

average time of 96% throughout the life of the vehicle [6]. EV
can interact and trade energy with other traders, and it can also
work independently by participating in energy trading with the
grid based on its battery status [7]. The only condition imposed
here is that the vehicles and the other traders and grid should be
within the same network. Many smart, sustainable, and green
solutions have been developed in the last decade, to consume
the energy produced in an environmentally sustained way [8].
For example, residential areas are deployed with Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) [9]. To manage the electricity in the
grid effectively, various demand response energy management
services were established in [10]. Figure. 1 shows a pictorial
representation of the scenario under consideration.
The traditional method of storing every single energy transac-
tion on central servers is not feasible for such micro-transactions.
Using cryptocurrency is a promising alternative for registering
each energy or data transaction. Distributed Ledger Technology
(DLT) plays a major role in storing these cryptocurrency-based
transactions. For storing all transaction data in a distributed stor-
age, the concept of blockchain is widely explored in the energy
market [11]. Blockchain allows a secure Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
transaction platform. In the P2P platform, no utility company
acts as an intermediary and any individual node in the network
can act as a buyer or a seller. In such a scenario, households
can be consumers, as well as prosumers, i.e., entities that can
produce and consume their electricity themselves and can also
sell excess electricity [12]. Recently many researchers have
focused their work towards using blockchain-based ledger tech-
nology for creating a P2P platform for energy trading [13], [14].
Such a transition is due to the following major advantages of
blockchain, or any DLT, over traditional centralized systems.
1) Blockchain provides decentralized and distributed ledger
for the storage and processing data, there is no payment
to any central authority required to get data storage and
organizing facilities [15].
2) There is no need to trust any third party because the state
of the chain is decided by the majority of participants
agreeing on the smart contract.
3) Records of transactions are tamper-resistant and account-
able.
4) Self-executing lines of code can be added as a smart con-
tract to prevent all kinds of disputes among the involved
parties.
5) The complete control of the asset movement is with the
smart contract and transactions can be immediately pro-
cessed using cryptocurrencies.

However, the generic blockchain algorithm suffers from some
fundamental drawbacks such as the latency of transaction confir-
mation, the scalability limitations, and the probabilistic nature
of consensus algorithms [16], [17]. Microtransactions cannot
be added in normal blockchains as the incentive given to the
miners for such transactions ends up to be higher than the actual
transaction value. Processing fees of transactions are increas-
ingly high and the size of the block is constrained due to which
implies that a large number of transactions can’t be handled,
making traditional blockchain less practical [18]. Various works
propose the use of other consensus algorithms such as Proof of
Stake (POS), Proof of Burn (POB), or Proof of Elapsed Time
(POET) to overcome the limitations of the generic blockchain.
However, all these consensus algorithms follow the Proof of
Work (POW) algorithm. The network development and the
distribution of currency depend on the POW algorithm only [19],
and the other algorithms can be applied only after using POW
for a considerable time. A new distributed application cannot be
created using the POS consensus process as none of the nodes in
the network has any stake or cryptocurrency to burn. Therefore,
in this paper Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based IOTA ledger
is used to perform P2P transactions in V2G energy trading [20].
Unlike normal blockchain, IOTA-based blockchain ledger does
not have any miners to process transactions [21]. However, the
facilities provided by the normal blockchain, such as distributed
and transparent transaction records, are fulfilled by IOTA-based
blockchain [22]. Moreover, the IOTA network is not susceptible
to distributed denial of service attacks as no single node is given
any unique privilege to create or maintain the data structure.
Therefore, IOTA-based blockchain is the right option for trading
energy in a P2P domain in the V2G network.
A. Research Contributions of This Work
We summarize the main contributions of this work as follows:
1) We propose a unique and secure energy trading platform
in V2G network.
2) It is based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) which uses
tangle data structure to store transactions.
3) We implement the tip selection algorithm which allows
buyers and sellers to add new transactions in tangle with-
out needing any miners.
4) The proposed energy trading model uses game theory for
selecting sellers and price at which sellers will trade energy
with buyers.
5) The use of game theory ensures nash equilibrium among
buyers and sellers thereby maintaining the energy selling
price.

II. RELATED WORK
Many researchers are working on the idea of trading energy
from V2G using EV and smart grid. A three-party architecture
was proposed to achieve effective RES in the power system using
EVs, smart grid, and ESUs in [23]. The architecture involves a
flexible and complex exchange between EVs and the smart grid,
where a framework is proposed to manage energy effectively and
intelligently in a power system. In [31], a response scheduling
algorithm to accommodate more EVs was introduced. In this
work, a framework to regulate the performance of the V2G
network in an efficient manner were proposed. According to
their dispatch algorithm for EVs, remote signals are used for
switching charging stations on and off.
Authors of [25], w5 devised a non-cooperative nash game
scheduling techniques for discharging and charging of EV. The
problem of overload of the grid at peak hours due to the high de-
mand of charge by EVs is considered. A centralized optimization
problem aiming to minimize the squared Euclidean distance be-
tween the instantaneous energy demand and the average demand
of buildings by controlling the charging and discharging sched-
ules of Plug- in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) is formulated.
Meanwhile, the authors of [25] proposed an aggregative game
model that helps in the scheduling of EVs optimal charging.
Quadratic programming is used to calculate the nash equilibrium
of the game model in an optimized way. Meanwhile, Woongsup
Lee et al. [32] have analyzed price competition between the
newly developed Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs)
and Renewable Power Generators (RPGs) using game theory.
Auction-based game-theoretic approaches have been intro-
duced by the authors of [24], which can be used for bargaining
the price of energy traded between EVs and market and solve
the coordination problems arising from charging EVs. The con-
vergence of the auction process to the nash equilibrium with the
help of a numerical example was also demonstrated. The authors
of [33] developed an auction mechanism that can determine
the price for trading energy between EVs and smart grids.
Simulation results show significant improvements in the average
utility when compared with a greedy approach. In [34], authors
proposed a Bayesian Coalition Negotiation Game (BCNG) and
achieved a nash equilibrium for managing and trading energy in
the V2G environments. A Secure Payoff Function (SPF) to avoid
the misuse of consumed energy was proposed. Protection from
attacks while distributing power and mutual authentication is
also provided in the proposed scheme. Finally, the authors of [35]
proposed charging and discharging cooperation of PHEVs in
V2G networks using a game-theoretic approach in their research
work. The significant reduction of peak-valley difference in
the smart grid’s electricity load was obtained in the simulation
results.

All the above works more or less depend on centralized
architectures. Such architectures suffer from some fundamental
defects, such as a single point of failure, security issues, and
scalability issues [36]. Few recent works have shown interest
in creating a distributed P2P network for energy trading using
traditional blockchain. Authors of [26] proposed a method of
consortium blockchain which uses P2P energy trading among
EVs. To illustrate the operations taking place in energy trading,
they proposed a method known as P2P Electricity Trading
System with Consortium Blockchain (PETCON). Along with
the PETCON method, the issue of energy pricing and the amount
of energy traded among EVs was solved using iterative double
auction game theory. Andoni M. et al. [29] discussed the key
features of DLTs needed for trading energy, with a focus on
distributed consensus algorithms, taxonomies of blockchain
architecture, and the suitability of those algorithms in smart
grid-based networks. Along with that, the challenges that are
going to come in the way of developing an energy trading
platform for the V2G network were discussed.
For trading energy in the V2G environment, authors of [30]
discussed a hierarchical authentication mechanism based on
blockchain. In their work, they used elliptic curve cryptography
(ECC) for hierarchical authentication. ECC can be used for
preserving EVs’ anonymity and for supporting mutual authenti-
cation among charging stations (CSs) and EVs. The protection
against different attacks has been validated using the Auto-
mated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications
(AVISPA) tool. Esther Mengelkamp et al. [28] simulated the
blockchain-based local energy market (LEM) and have dis-
cussed the advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain
for energy trading. They implemented a closed double auction
mechanism via a smart contract using blockchain. The authors
of [27] implemented the blockchain-based energy trading sys-
tem, showing the process by which a producer and consumer
nodes complete their exchange transactions. The interaction
between the producer and consumer nodes and implementation
of an energy trading system is shown using Savoir (python-
based JsonRPC module). Although the generic blockchain-
based frameworks help provide a secure distributed environment
for P2P energy transactions, such frameworks also have some in-
built limitations. Normal blockchain frameworks cannot support
micro-transactions between a large number of nodes. Also, the
forking and pruning issues in generic blockchain result the effi-
ciency of the framework. Therefore, in this work an IOTA based
P2P distributed network that can support micro-transactions
with a large number of nodes is proposed. The proposed model
is free from forking and pruning issues, and no mining fees are
involved while validating the transactions. In the next Section,
the prelims of the IOTA network and the proposed network
model are discussed.
III. NETWORK CREATION AND PRELIMINARIES
IOTA ledger turns out to be a feasible option, to record and
process the large number of frequent micro-transactions in the
V2G network. IOTA is a DAG-based distributed ledger, where
a DAG is referred to as a tangle in IOTA [20]. IOTA tangle
provides interesting features such as fee-less micro-transactions,
asset transfer, and trusted identities. When all the devices get
connected to the IOTA network, they act as nodes in the network.
The devices can securely transfer data and perform transactions
directly with each other without involving any centralized third
party. The EVs, when parked, can buy energy from nearby malls
or offices, or can use the extra energy to power the street lights
nearby at night.
A. Digital Identity
One of the most important building blocks for any DLT is
digital identity. Digital identity is used to ensure the level of
trust among the parties involved in energy transactions. Re-
cently, the IOTA community has developed a digital biometric
identification in which a person’s palm vein pattern is used to
identify him/her, namely the IAMPASS biometric palm vein
authentication for digital identity in IOTA [37]. Centralized and
traditional identification methods often fail to secure user data
that is growing at a tremendous rate. Therefore, verified digital
identity, stored on a distributed ledger, is an innovative alterna-
tive. Also, digital identity verification methods are free from fee
expenses charged by third-parties for providing authentication
and verification services.
Each smart device has its own pseudo-anonymous, a virtual
and private wallet that stores IOTA tokens used for making
transactions. To use an IOTA network, the user has to create
a secret password called seed (a string of 81 trytes) [38]. Each
seed can create 957 addresses and private keys. Users can send
messages and tokens to other users using the address field in
the transaction which is public. To withdraw IOTA tokens from
addresses, bundles are signed using unique private keys.
B. Tip Selection Algorithm
In generic Blockchain, to verify whether the user is making
an authentic transaction or not, computing power is a major
factor. Miners are used to validate normal blockchain, where all
transactions are to be added in the next block. The task of mining
in the traditional blockchain is done by new transactions in
IOTA, i.e., approval of transactions is done by the participation of
all the nodes directly or indirectly present in the network, thereby
making miners and participant nodes indistinct. This prevents
the IOTA network from distributed denial of service (DDOS)
attacks. Whenever a new transaction comes in the tangle, it
has to select and approve two previous transactions. An edge is
created between the selected transactions and the newly added
transaction. The new transaction has to solve a cryptographic
puzzle, to approve an existing transaction. Once this is done,
the new transaction waits for its approval by another upcoming
transaction. Unapproved transactions in a DAG are referred
to as a tip. The tip-selection algorithm decides how the tip
gets validated by new transactions [20]. Hence, the transaction
confirmation latency depends on tip-selection algorithms and
the rate at which new transactions are added in the tangle. The
frequency of transactions that can get added in the IOTA network
is very high compared to the ten minutes waiting time to add a
new block in normal blockchain.

Fig. 2. Energy trading between electric vehicles and grids.
The tip selection algorithm gives a special rating to each
transaction, which is equal to the number of transactions that
reference it. The larger the weight of a transaction the more
important it is. The aim of this implementation is to select two
non-conflicting tips for the verification of the newly arrived
transaction. The cumulative Weight (CW ) of any transaction
X is given as its own weight plus the weight of transac-
tions that approved it directly or indirectly. For example if
X2, X3, X4, . . .., XN are the transactions that approve X1 di-
rectly or indirectly, and the weight of X1 is WX1 and while the
weight of X2, X3, X4, . . .., XN is WX2,3,4,...,N , then
CWX1 =
N∑
i=1
WXi (1)
But when the size of the tangle is very large, it becomes really
difficult to recompute the weight of all the transactions in the
past. Therefore to overcome this challenge, a new algorithm has
been proposed to calculate the cumulative weight of the trans-
actions using a fixed section of the DAG called subgraph [39].
C. Consensus Mechanism
Generating a level of trust among the nodes for the authenticity
of the transactions is imperative for every distributed ledger
technology. Since we want to trade energy, we will exchange
currency in return. Also, to exchange highly sensitive data, we
have to be sure that whether we want to depend on these trustless
networks or not. In the traditional blockchain, the consensus is
reached using a deterministic approach, i.e., the transaction will
be valid in blockchain when a number of blocks are added in the
chain. In IOTA, the consensus is reached i.e., tangle eventually
is stochastic (or probabilistic). When almost all the participants
in an IOTA network say that your transaction is more valid than
this other transaction, then consensus will be achieved.
In the IOTA, the consensus is distributed in the tangle, and for
placing one’s own transaction in the network, the participant has
to validate two past transactions, as discussed above. Apart from
securing IOTA from the tip selection algorithm and cumulative
weight-based consensus mechanism, a new security layer has
been added to overcome the issue of conflicting tips. This
security measure is called the shimmer, and it is a voting-based
mechanism. Shimmer overcomes the drawbacks faced by tradi-
tional voting schemes. In this, the consensus for conflicting tip
is achieved by proactive communication between the nodes.
IV. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Fig. 2 shows the detailed overview of the proposed V2G
model. Initially, after the vehicles and grid join the network,
they start with a message passing process. These messages are
recorded on the IOTA tangle.
1) The first box shows the first step where the message
passing takes place between the EVs and the grid users.
The EVs can ask for energy from the grids or may offer
for selling energy to the grids.
2) The second box shows the tangle creation to securely
store the information that is being exchanged between
the vehicles and the grid. The different transaction colors
specify their cumulative weight. Once the transaction is
verified by new transactions, the color becomes green.
Initially, the color is kept as grey until the transaction is
not verified.

3) The third box shows the process of Evolutionary Game
Theory (EGT) being applied among the grids based on
the energy price offered by the electric vehicles.
4) The fourth box shows the application of the Non-
Cooperative Game Theory (NCGT) among the electric
vehicles based on the selection probability given by grids.
5) Finally, a Stackelberg Game Theory (SGT) is applied to
associate the best possible electric vehicle with the best
possible grid, as shown in box 5 and 6.
A. Structure of V2G Network
In the proposed system model, a residential area, comprising
of smart homes, EVs, smart supermarket, smart hospitals or any
smart IoT device which can produce energy with the help of
solar or wind panels, is considered. Every device, vehicle or
grid, acts as a prosumer (both producer and consumer) in the
model. The user acts as a buyer when he/she is in need of energy
and is unable to meet the demand due to high consumption or
unsteady generation. The seller, on the other hand, is one that
has a surplus amount of energy. While generating and consuming
electricity, expenses vary due to:
1) Climatic conditions: More electricity is consumed in the
cold weather, and more of electricity is generated in the
summer by PV panels.
2) Time of the day: Demand is increased in the morning when
users are at home, and the output from PV panels is at its
peak during midday.
3) Balanced electricity grid: To meet the high consumption
requirements during peak-time, expenses should be higher
than in off-peak time.
Every prosumer, either grid or vehicle, consists of a load and
solar panel (SP). The SP of a prosumer is connected to the ac
(Alternating Current) system and load through SP inverter (ac/dc
converter). If a prosumer has both battery and SP installed, then
can be connected via ac-coupled or dc-coupled topology. The
battery is connected through the ac/dc converter to the ac side of
the SP inverter in case of ac-coupled topology. In the dc-coupled
topology, the battery is connected through the ac/dc converter at
the dc side of the SP inverter.
All the vehicles and grid present in the residential area act
as nodes of the IOTA network and can communicate with each
other. A digital protocol known as the smart contract will be in-
stalled on the IOTA network, which will enforce the prosumer’s
energy management (PEM). Every time a user requests data
or shares energy, the smart contract will run and facilitate the
transaction. The data consisting of energy transactions, gen-
eration, and consumption of every prosumer, is stored at the
IOTA network itself. The smart contract can be seen as an agent
whose duty is to operate and store information regarding all the
transactions that occurred during trading energy and the number
of IOTA tokens sent during each transaction. We assume that the
transmission cost and losses are very low or negligible since the
amount of energy trading taking place in the V2G network is
small. The main goal of this research is to develop an algorithm
that assists in trading energy in the V2G network.
LetA = {1, 2, 3, . . . , i, . . . , A} be the set ofA � |A| number
of prosumers in a residential area with i ∈ A. It is assumed that
the total time of action is divided into equal intervals i.e.,Δt = 1.
Let T = {1, 2, 3, . . . , t, . . . , T} be the set of T � |T | number
of time slots.
The solar power production profile of a prosumer i during a
day can de defined as follows.
Psp,i =
{
P 1

where P 1
sp,i refers to the solar power production by prosumer
i in the first time slot. The consumption profile of prosumer i
during that same time period is given as follows.
Ci =

, i ∈ A (3)
where C1
i is the power consumption by prosumer i in the first
time slot.
B. Electric Storage Units
Let Et−Δt
i and Et
i be the energy level of the ESU of prosumer
i at the beginning and end of the assumed time slot. Take Bt
cp,i
as the charging power of the ESU of prosumer i at time t and
let Bt
dp,i be the discharging power of the ESU of prosumer i at
time t. It is assumed that the charging and discharging power of
the ESU remain constant and the self-discharge of the ESU is
neglected during time t. Let the Charging and discharging effi-
ciency of the ESU for prosumer i be ηtcp,i and ηtdp,i respectively.
Binary variables for prosumer i charging and discharging in time
t are denoted by αt
i and βt
i , respectively. To avoid concurrent
discharging and charging of the ESU, the sum of both the binary
variables should be less than or equal to 1 i.e.,
αt
i + βt
i ≤ 1 (4)
The energy stored during charging and discharging of the ESU
is represented by φt
i and ϕt
i, respectively and is mathematically
modeled as follows [30].

energy stored in the ESU can be modeled as:
Et
i = Et−Δt
i −
(
ϕt
i − φt
i
)
(7)
In practical scenarios, size of SP inverter decides the max-
imum and minimum limit of charging power and discharging
power and the limits are given as follows:
0 � Bt
cp,i � Bmax
cp,i , 0 � Bt
dp,i � Bmax
dp,i (8)
In the above equation, the maximum charging power is repre-
sented by Bmax
cp,i and the maximum discharging power is repre-
sented by Bmax
dp,i . The cost of the ESU, the vehicle’s wear and
tear cost and the cost of purchased energy are the three primary
factors in the computation of the cost of the V2G network. The
use of ESUs will benefit V2G networks if and only if the ESU’s
cost per day i.e., CD is less than the corresponding cost saving.

TABLE II
LIST OF ACRONYMS
If the total saving done in a day is not more than the daily cost,
use of ESU will not be justified. The CD is given as:
CD =
1
Yd
[
MC +
(1 + r)lr
(1 + r)l − 1
× CU
]
(9)
where Yd represents tthe number of days in a year, MC repre-
sents the cost of maintaining the ESU annually, r is the interest
rate for financing ESUs, l is the ESU’s lifetime in years and CU
is the combined cost of converter and ESU. The EV’s wear and
tear cost in V2G can be calculated as the degradation cost ω [40]
due to extra running time:
ω =
CU
LT
(10)
where LT is the ESU’s lifetime throughput energy and is given
as:
LT = DD ∗ Et
i ∗ l (11)
Depth-of-dischargeDD is another factor that describes the depth
of the ESU’s discharge. DD should remain above a certain level
at all time to increase the overall ESU’s lifetime.
C. Classifying Buyers and Sellers
LetM andN denote the seller and buyer at time t respectively
where index m ∈ M, n ∈ N and i ∈ A. M � |M| and N �
|N | gives total number of sellers and buyers respectively at given
time t.
The production-to-consumption ratio ζti for prosumer i ∈ A
at time or in the time interval t ∈ T is given as:
ζti =
P t
sp,i
Ct
i
(12)
where ζti is greater than 1 for sellers and lower than 1 for buyers.
The amount of power that prosumerm ∈ M can sell andn ∈ N
can buy at time t are respectively given as:
Bt
s,m = Ct
m
(
ζtm − 1
)
(13)
Bt
b,n = Ct
n
(
1 − ζtn
)
(14)
In the proposed system model, we are considering only ve-
hicles as sellers and grids as buyers, i.e., only V2G exchange
is considered. However, a similar model can be used to accom-
modate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), grid-to-vehicle (G2V), and
grid-to-grid (G2G) communications and trading. At any time t
when the grid wants to consume energy from the vehicle, various
constraints are to be considered. The minimum amount of energy
that an EV m ∈ M should always have is represented by ϑt
min.
The amount of energy the EV m ∈ M is carrying at time t is
denoted as ϑt
m. Hence, the amount of energy delivered to grid
Vt is calculated as follows.
Vt = DD
(
ϑt
m − ϑt
min
)
(15)
Also, the amount of energy required by the grid Gt at time t is
obtained as:
Gt = 
− 
tn (16)
where the total capacity of the grid is 
 and the storage level of
the grid at the time of energy trade is denoted as 
tn.
D. Utility and Welfare Function for Prosumer
Behaviour of each entity could be independent based on time,
price, etc., in V2G system. Different parameters such as elec-
tricity price, weather conditions, and time of the day determine
the energy demand of each user. The energy demand also varies
with the type of user i.e., industrial users and residential users can
have different opinions on the same electricity price. The utility
function can analytically model the response of users to different
prices. Let U(p, ξ) be the utility function for V2G network
where p represents the user’s level of power consumption and
ξ represents a parameter that varies according to prosumers.
The level of happiness or satisfaction when a user consumes
some power is represented by a utility function. Consumers
are generally modeled using quadratic utility functions [41],
[42] and logarithmic utility functions [43]–[46]. To calculate the

V. GAME THEORY IN V2G NETWORK
In the proposed model, the smart grid acts as multiple buyers
and EVs as multiple sellers. The Evolutionary Game Theory
(EGT) model is used to select the best possible EV to buy
energy from. EGT focuses more on the dynamics of change
in the strategy. There is a competition among the grids, and to
resolve the competition, EGT is used as the grids are constantly
changing strategies to earn more profit. Another level of compe-
tition lies between the EVs. A Non-Cooperative Game Theory
(NCGT) model is used to settle this competition. All the EVs
are competing with each other to sell the energy to the grid at the
best possible price. There is no cooperation among the EVs, and
therefore NCGT is the best suitable model for this interaction.
Further, a Stackelberg Game Theory (SGT) model is used for the
interactions between the buyers and sellers. In the Stackelberg
game model, the leader moves first and, based on the move of
the leader, the follower decides its move. Therefore, to cater the
interaction between EVs and the grid, a Stackelberg game is
used.
A. Selection of Appropriate EV Using EGT
The population group n ∈ N in the proposed EGT model
consists of all smart grids and they act as buyers. Once the EVs
display their prices, each grid chooses an EV from which it will
buy energy. The selection strategy of a grid is gradually adjusted
and the EV is selected by the grid in an independent way during
the process of selection. The probability that the EV m ∈ M
is chosen by the grid n ∈ N in the tth hour is given by Qt
m.
The ratio of supply and demand for EV m at time t is given as
follows.
Rm =
Bt
s,m
Dm
(19)
where Dm is the energy demand coming to EV m from the
grid and i ∈ A. The value of Dm used in the above equation is
calculated as follows.
Dm = Qt
m
M∑
m=1
pt∗i (20)
where
pt∗i = argmax
pt
i
W
(
pti, ξ

)
(21)
when the value of Rm is less than 1, then the true value of the
power that the grid buys from the EV is
pti,true = Qt
mRmpt∗i (22)
and when the value of Rm is greater than or equal to 1, then the
true value of the power that the grid buys from the EV is:
pti,true = Qt
mpt∗i (23)
The sum of the welfares of all grids obtained from EVm gives
the net utility of grid n. When Bt
s,m is greater than or equal to
the demand Dm, the net utility is given as:
ut
m =
1
2
M∑
m=1

and when Bt

given as:

(

+ Z (25)
where
Z = P t

We design replicator dynamics to depict the buyers’ selection

)
(27)
where ut is defined as the average utility obtained as:
ut =
M∑

m (28)
At stable conditions, the probability of selecting a seller will be
fixed and the net utility of each EV will be equal to the average
utility ut. Hence,
∂Qt
m
∂t

Using equation (26), (27) and (28), we get:

Hence

m = 1 and Lyapunov theory can prove the
stable condition stated in equation (28) using the dynamics
designed in equation (26). The equilibrium state in EGT is
represented by:
Qt∗ =

(31)
The approximation of replicator dynamics can be found in
an iterative manner with the help of discrete the replicator as

B. EVs Using NCGT for Maximizing Own Benefit
Since EVs run independently and do not form coalitions with
other EVs, they use NCGT and behave reasonably. When Bt
s,m
is less than or equal to the demand Dm, then welfare function
of EV is given as
W
(
ptm, ξtm
)
= U
(
ptm, ξtm
)
+t
mBt
s,m (34)
and when Bt
s,m is greater than the demand Dm, the welfare
function of EV is given as
W
(
ptm, ξtm
)
= U
(
ptm, ξtm
)
+t
mDm (35)
The total electricity sold and its price is included in the solution
of the game and is also called as Nash equilibrium (NE). There
are some set of conditions that need to be satisfied for the NE
to exist in the NCGT. First, the set of players should be finite.
Here we have M EVs, so this condition is always satisfied. For
a fixed value of price i.e., t
m, the welfare W(ptm, ξtm) changes
and buyers can purchase all the power available for export. If
Bt
s,m is greater than the demand Dm, then
∂2W(ptm, ξtm)

When Bt
s,m is less than or equal to the demand Dm, then

When all the demand of energy coming to EVDm is completed
or all the power Bt
s,m is sold, the game is stopped. Using

end for
equations (35) and (36), we can say ∂2W(pt
m,ξtm)
∂(�t
m)2 � 0. Hence, the
welfare functions are quasi-concave and continuous. Therefore,
we come to the conclusion that the NE among EV exists in
NCGT.
C. SGT Between EV and Grid
SGT can be used between the EVs as multiple leaders and
the grids as multiple followers. The output of the EGT i.e., the
probability of selecting a seller and the output of the NCGT
i.e., the price for energy are the inputs to the NCGT and EGT,
respectively. This relationship between EGT and NCGT is estab-
lished using SGT. An EV announces the price which is received
by all the grids and they participate in EGT. The output of the
EGT gives the probability of selecting a seller which is used by
EVs to acquire a NE and update their prices. The NE can’t be
obtained analytically since EVs are using NCGT and all the EVs
are unknown to each other. Therefore Stackelberg equilibrium
(SE) in SGT and NE among EVs is reached with the help of an
iterative algorithm. The strategy followed by EV m to update its
price is given as:
t
m(y + 1) = t
m(y) + σ2
(
Dm(y)−Bt
s,m
)
(38)
The criteria for its termination is given as:
∣∣t
m(y + 1)−t
m(y)
∣∣ < C (39)
Equation (39) can also be written as:
∣∣Dm(y)−Bt
s,m
∣∣ < C (40)
where C is a small positive number, σ2 is an adjustment
parameter, and y is the number of iterations. The first step in
energy trading is EVs announcing the price of energy, which is
then received by the grid, and then they play the EGT. Grids
reach equilibrium for the price announced by EVs using EGT,
and they send this information back to EVs. When EVs receive
this strategy from grids, they engage in a NCGT to update their
prices, and this is repeated until equilibrium is obtained. This is
how V2G energy trading takes place using game theory in an
effective manner.

VI. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
A. Simulation Settings
For assessing the performance of energy trading in the V2G
community, the simulation results are presented in this section.
In our model, we have considered a community of 3 grids and
10 EVs. Each EV is equipped with a PV solar system and can
trade energy with grids in exchange for iota tokens. For one day
T = {1, 2, . . ., 24} is time under consideration. The production
profiles and load of EVs and grids are taken from [47]. The
buying and selling prices of electricity are detremined based
on the actual prices of electricity in the USA. Charging and
discharging power limits of the ESUs are set to 3 kW. The
charging and discharging efficiency of the ESUs are set to 0.6
and 0.4, respectively.
B. Performance Evaluation
Results generated by the methods used in the paper are
compared and evaluated in this section. Fig. 3 shows the Power
Consumption Ratio (PCR) of all Electric Vehicles at each hour
of the day. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 shows the PCR of all grids at
each hour of the day. It is important to study the PCR values
in order to understand the actual time when the model will be
highly in use. The demand and supply of energy and the rate
at which the energy has to be sold or bought is also dependent
on the production and consumption of energy. Electric Vehicles
can sell the excess energy when the value of PCR > 1 at any
time slot t ∈ T for i ∈ A. Grids can buy energy from EVs when
the value of PCR � 1 at any time slot t ∈ T for i ∈ A.
Fig. 5. Total power that Electric Vehicle can export.
Fig. 6. Total power imported by grids.
Fig. 5 shows the total amount of power (in kW) that Electric
Vehicles can export at any time t of the day. The amount of
energy over time that Electric Vehicles can sell to grids depends
on the amount of energy present with Electric Vehicles after
they meet their own requirements. It can be observed from the
graph that different electric vehicles have a different amount
of energy that they can sell at different times of the day. It
depends on the energy generated by the EV and its require-
ments. Taxi vehicles might have less energy to sell compared
to personal vehicles that are used less often. Fig. 6 shows the
amount of power (in kW) that grids imported from Electric
Vehicles. The amount of energy over time that the grid buys
from Electric Vehicles depends on the requirement of the grid.
Also, the grid can meet certain requirements by itself as it
also has its own generation from the PV panels installed on
buildings, roofs.
Fig. 7 shows the convergence characteristics of EGT versus
the number of iterations. It can be observed from the graph
that the Electric Vehicles initially change their energy price
over a few iterations and then stop changing the prices. The
change in price becomes stable once the EVs reach maximum
possible utility. The change in price by Electric Vehicles is due
to a change of their selection probability by the grid. Once the
price provided by the EVs becomes stable, the grid submits
the selection probability to the EVs, and the non-cooperative
game starts between the EVs to trade energy with the grid.
Fig. 8 shows the variations in the selection probability of a
grid for energy trade versus the number of iterations. It can be

observed from the graph that, in contrast to Electric Vehicle, the
probability that the grid selects Electric Vehicle 1 is increasing
as the iterations increases. This is so because the change in price
by Electric Vehicle 1 is more convenient to the grid compared
to the change in price by Electric Vehicle 5. This makes the
grid increase the probability of selecting Electric Vehicle 1,
and decrease the probability of selecting Electric Vehicle 5.
The traditional schemes do not have the option of changing
the prices as per demand and supply, and therefore the overall
revenue of both parties is low compared to the proposed scheme,
where both parties are allowed to choose the best possible
option.
Fig. 9 shows the change in supply to demand ratio of three
different Electric Vehicles versus the number of iterations. The
supply of energy is adjusted by the electric vehicles in such
a way that the supply to demand ratio Rm increases with the
iterations. The increase in the supply to demand ratio increases
the selection probability of the EVs and also increases the overall
revenue of the EVs.
Fig. 10 shows a comparison of the price given by five Electric
Vehicles in the first bid auction and proposed model. It can be
observed that the price given by electric vehicles is reduced
in the proposed model, which results in the welfare of the grid.
Since the genuine price is being offered by the EVs, the selection
probability by the grid increases. Therefore, the overall welfare
and revenue of the EVs are also enhanced.

Fig. 11 shows a change in price given by Electric Vehicles
versus the probability of Electric Vehicle selection versus the
number of iterations. It can be observed from the graph that as
the price given by Electric Vehicles decreases, the probability
of getting selected by the grid increases and vice-versa. The
values on the color map show the change in color on the graph
with the change in the value of price by EVs.The yellow color
shows the maximum price and minimum selection probability,
and the dark blue color shows the minimum price and maximum
selection probability.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a scheme for trading energy in
V2G networks using iota as the distributed ledger. Three game-
theoretic models were applied for price competition among
EVs and negotiation of selection between grids and EVs. A
tangle data structure is used for the purpose of recording all the
transactions in a secure manner. Moreover, evolutionary game
theory is proposed, which uses an iterative algorithm that helps
grids choose a suitable EV for energy trading. Meanwhile, a
non-cooperative game is used to allow the EVs to compete with
each other. Finally, Stackelberg game is used to allow negotiation
between the grid and EVs. In this context, a Nash Equilibrium is
acquired using these game-theoretic models. Simulation results
presented prove that the proposed algorithm helps EVs and
grids achieve a stable state, where the revenue of both parties is
enhanced. The work can be further extended to G2V, G2G, and
V2V networks.
