Abstract. City parking is increasingly complex and available parking spaces
are scarce. Being able to identify a space to park their cars can lead many drivers
to drive around the intended parking area several times, increasing traffic density
and pollution. In this research we propose a collaborative blockchain solution
with gamification for parking. Users collaborate to report free spaces and receive
free parking minutes for their service to the community. In parallel, this
approach can be used to collect beacon information from the parked vehicles
and create a low-cost collaborative approach for managing a parking control
process platform Blockchain that can handle this distributed process and the
gamification platform increases users’ participation.

1 Introduction
Parking is one of the major concerns in the cities due to the reduced availability of
space and the time-consuming process for finding a parking place. Several studies show
that in the majority of cities about one-third of traffic is generated by drivers on the
search for a parking space, which corresponds to average times of 10 min [1]. Drivers
cover, on average, a distance of 4.5 km to find a parking place [1], which corresponds
to an average of 1.3 kg of CO2 per month, or about 100 km per month, and to an
additional estimated cost of about 10€ per month. In the Lisbon region (Portugal’s
capital), for example, the average number of vehicles per day is of 250 to 300 thousand
[2]; if one considers that the demand for parking spaces affects part of this number of
vehicles, an estimate of 100 thousand vehicles could be removed from the roads. In this
scenario, it can also be estimated 1 M€ per month of additional expenses and additional
production of 130 tons of CO2 that could be avoided. Considering only the example of
Lisbon, the annual distance traveled in search of parking place (4.5 km-day � 230
days annual work � 100 000 cars) would allow to take about 2800 rounds to the planet

and represents about 36 000 h of work lost. In the city, inner zones parking spots are
difficult to find. It is often that trucks looking for cargo unloading spots find that those
spots have been used by another driver (not involving logistics). This scenario stresses
the need for solutions to identify if a parking spot is free and, consequently, guide the
driver to those places. One such conventional system in closed environments (an
example of parking spaces at malls) has sensors at each parking spot with a light that
indicates if it is available or not. The same approach can be applied to street parking,
and this data can be transferred to a driver’s App, but the cost of this solution is
prohibitive and involves high maintenance cost. For example, Avenida Liberdade, in
Lisbon, has around 1.1 km and a solution with parking sensors was implemented with
an investment value of 80 K€ with the associated annual maintenance cost of 10 K€.
The proposal in this research aims at avoiding these costs (investment and mainte-
nance) and is based on a collaborative approach to detect if parking spaces are occu-
pied, along with a gamification incentive.
2 State of the Art
2.1 Sensors
Many parking systems have been proposed in recent years. These work based on
installed sensors that collect information about each individual parking spot. These
sensors detect the presence of a vehicle or other objects. They can range from a simple
ultrasonic sensor that detects a vehicle based on a threshold distance or RFID chips that
are activated based on distance to complex optical sensors. These sensors can be
divided into two main categories: intrusive and non-intrusive sensors [3]. Intrusive
sensors are sensors that are typically installed in holes on the road surface, including
active infrared sensors, inductive loops, magnetometers, magneto-resistive sensors,
pneumatic road tubes, piezoelectric cables, and weigh-in-motion sensors. The main
problem of these sensors is the installation and maintenance cost. Non-intrusive sen-
sors, by their nature, do not have the installation problem and encompasses microwave
radar, passive acoustic array sensors, passive infrared sensor, RFID, ultrasonic, BLE
beacons and video image processing. Non-intrusive sensors can be easily installed and
maintained and do not affect the surface involved in the process.
Active infrared sensors detect vehicles based on infrared energy. These can detect
the amount of energy reflected, and most of the installation effort is based on multiple
beams that can measure the vehicle position, speed and class [3, 4]. The main working
problem is its sensitivity to weather conditions (examples are fog or snow).
The Inductive Loop Detectors are used mainly for getting accurate occupancy
measurements based on wire loops with frequencies ranging from 10 to 50 kHz. This
frequency oscillation changes with vehicle presence, and it is one of the most used
sensors to detect the presence of a vehicle in a spot. The main issues are the installation
and maintenance costs and the fact that these sensors are sensitive to water, especially if
the pavement is cracked.
Fluxgate magnetometers work by detecting a perturbation in a magnetic field and
have as main advantage being insensitive to weather condition such as snow, rain, and
4 J. C. Ferreira et al.
fog. They are also more accurate and less susceptible to traffic stress than loop
detectors. Among the disadvantages of using fluxgate magnetometers are the small
detection zones in some models that require that multiple units are needed for full lane
detection as well as the close proximity required for accurate detection [3, 5].
Magnetometer Induction or search coil magnetometer identifies the presence of a
vehicle in a spot by measuring the change in the magnetic flux lines caused by the
moving vehicle according to Faraday’s Law of induction [3, 6]. Some models can be
installed without the need for pavement changes and have the advantage of being
insensitive to weather conditions.
The magnetoresistive sensor is in general light and small, allowing versatile
installation, low cost and are able to work in all temperature registers in earth surface
[7]. They work by simply being energized with constant current [6].
Piezoelectric sensors are created from a material that is able to convert kinetic
energy into electrical energy when subjected to vibration or mechanical impact, so it
can detect when the vehicle is on and can detect speed and vehicle distance axle. For
parking situations, it has the disadvantage of the need to use multiple detectors to detect
a vehicle presence in a parking spot.
There is also a diversity of others sensors like: Pneumatic road tube, Weight-in-
Motion (WIM) sensors, Microwave radar, Passive infrared sensors, RFID and Ultra-
sonic sensors.
There is also the possibility of using CCTV systems with the drawback of some
incident position of the working system. This approach works well in closed envi-
ronments, but on streets there is the problem of the sunlight reflecting at the beginning
and end of the day. They are based on advanced digital signal processing (DSP) that
transforms video cameras into intelligent counting sensors. Its stand-alone design
enables it to detect and count vehicles utilizing video received from an IP and/or analog
video cameras. The software even stabilizes the video image by removing the camera
and vibration effects. Advanced background algorithms then ignore any nuisance
images, such as shadows or lighting changes uncertain limits. Once an object is
detected, a filter is applied to avoid counting nonvehicle items, such as humans and
luggage, or vehicles not moving in the desired direction.
Sensors implanted, in general, are expensive to deploy and maintain (e.g., [8] cost
USD$500 per system for each parking space, and [9] cost USD$400 per system for
each car). These sensors may underperform in extreme weather conditions. Using
mobile phones is cheaper, more convenient, and more flexible.
There is a new type of sensor devices that opens several business opportunities in
healthcare, sports, beacons, security, monitor and home entertainment industries, the
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors. A BLE sensor is a wireless personal area
network technology that once compared to the Classic Bluetooth is intended to provide
much-reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communica-
tion range. Bluetooth is a low-cost, short-range wireless technology with small foot-
print, small power consumption, reasonable throughput and hence suitable for various
small, battery-driven devices like mobile phones, PDAs, cameras, laptops, etc. Also in
this context, there are beacons with around 3-5 cm, a small hardware radio device that
broadcasts data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE operates a spectrum band
(2402-2480 MHz), divided in 40x2 MHz physical channels and uses GFSK variation,
A Blockchain and Gamification Approach for Smart Parking 5
attaining a data rate up to 1 Mbps. Typical ranges of the radio signal are up to 20 or
100 m (60–300 ft.), and it is easy to fit it in many applications and contexts. Beacons
offer the versatility of being placed anywhere - indoors or outdoors position. The
challenge arises when beacons are deployed in environments that are disposed to
weather conditions such as rain or humidity. Also, beacons can be managed centrally
without the need of going physically to where they are located.
Additionally, it is very easy to interact BLEs with mobile devices sensors, like
GPS, Accelerometer, and gyroscope creating a continuous monitoring process since
users carry mobile devices all the time. This generates massive data (big data).
2.2 Parking Solutions
Most of the parking solutions implement the concept of reservation and the evaluation
of available places based on the information in video cameras or sensors, to detect the
occupation of the parking place. From the diversity of existing systems many are in the
sense of allowing the reservation of place and the consequent elimination of search for
a parking space in the private car park. For example, the Reservation of places with
recourse to short message services (SMS) [10], or the New “Smart Parking” System
Based on Resource Allocation and Reservations. [11], which implements the concept
of seat reservation with the problem of another driver taking the reserved seat because
he arrived first. This mechanism can in itself be a barrier to the dissemination of the
system, since depending on the parking regulations and operational models of the
management companies, the concept of reservations in street places is difficult to
implement or simply impracticable. Hence there is the need for a concept that is not
dependent on the concept of the reserve, but which optimizes the search for a vacant
place. Other examples are: An Intelligent Parking Guidance and Information System by
using the image processing technique. [12] and Intelligent Parking Management Sys-
tem Based on Image Processing. [13], which, based on video image processing, allow
us to determine whether the place is vacant or not. Another example is the Automatic
Parking Management System and Parking Fee Collection Based on Number Plate
Recognition [14]. This solution is more management oriented and not so operational,
therefore not giving the necessary support to the end user and, consequently, self-
limiting the dissemination of the concept.
2.3 Collaborative Approach - Gamification
Mobile devices allow accurate tracking of world-related information and (physical)
activities of citizens by taking advantage of people willing to collaborate toward a
continuous data harvesting process called crowdsensing. According to [15]: “While
crowdsourcing aims to leverage collective intelligence to solve complex problems by
splitting them into smaller tasks executed by the crowd, crowdsensing splits the
responsibility of harvesting information (typically urban monitoring) to the crowd”. In
other words, crowdsensing is the process where people or their mobile devices act as
sensors and actuators to continuously harvest data and take actions upon the results
[15]. It is a challenging task since several socio-technical issues may occur, such as the
quantification of the sensing density. The users’ participation and cooperation are
6 J. C. Ferreira et al.
essential in crowdsourcing [16], but users’ participation consumes their resources such
as battery and computing capacity [17]. This problem leads to an inevitable fact that
many users might be reluctant to participate, which is a major obstacle to mobile
crowdsourcing [13]. To avoid this, an incentive mechanism is needed to ensure users’
participation.
Geo-referencing is available through GPS on mobile devices, and the mobile app
only receives the beacon signal. Rinne et al. [18] presented the pros and cons of mobile
crowdsensing. As observed, parking can be made smart, then it can be gamified. Some
gaming thoughts and techniques can be added to make this parking process more
exciting and safe. To gamify the parking process, the concept is introduced for pro-
viding points to drivers. The greater the number of points the more will be the chances
of winning. This gamified version of parking can create a process of virtual learning to
the drivers who have just started their driving duty.
3 Proposed Approach to Control Parking Process
The present proposal intends to work with the problem of the management of places in
open spaces using probabilistic calculation on data history, and the collaboration of the
users, which allows to determine in which places have a higher probability of being
empty. The use of probabilities allows dealing with the uncertainty associated with this
process through past data analysis (data history), which allows reducing uncertainty
using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. This uncertainty will also be incorporated
into the route optimization algorithms, allowing to indicate optimal paths to find the
desired parking place function of the probability functions associated with the location.
For example, it is possible that the optimal path is not related to the higher probability
of a vacant place, but rather the route of maximizing the different probabilities. From
the research done by the authors of this idea, it is innovative and has not yet been
implemented in any solution of this type. Figure 1 shows the developed approach for
mobile device application. It is possible to control parking spots based on the use of
BLE beacons in vehicles. These beacons transmit an identification signal that can be
captured by mobile devices, which can add a GPS position and be transmitted to a
central system.
The current proposal is distinguished by the involvement of users, by analyzing the
data history to determine the probability of empty space, by combining the concept of
carpooling and by not implying the installation of any infrastructure, which increases
complexity and makes any solution more expensive.
We implemented in a test environment a Steemit (www.steemit.com) that allows
the account the distributed user inputs about free parking places and associated points
(free parking minutes) in a gamified approach. Each street we define a number of inputs
needed for system work proper, when a number of inputs are bellow we point increased
and when are above points decrease. The platform allows this flexible configuration,
and in a big implementation scenario (not available yet) we can explore the power of
this approach.
To incentive users’ participation, a reward mechanism based on free parking is
introduced. First-time drivers should register and request for a beacon. Being part of
A Blockchain and Gamification Approach for Smart Parking 7
http://www.steemit.com
this network allows them to have reduced parking fees. In order to monitor parking
activity, our proposal is the installation of a beacon in each vehicle (it costs around 3€,
with a battery lifetime span of 2 years). These requirements should be reinforced by
law and maintenance should be the responsibility of the owner of the vehicle. This
works like an electronic plate number that allows vehicle identification. To avoid the
creation of infrastructure and networking, our approach is innovative as it uses citizens
and their mobile devices. In this model, users get rewards for each different beacon
picked and transmitted to the central parking application. This reward could be free
parking time (for instance, 5 min parking for each transmission) and the reward could
be increased if an infraction is identified. This process is performed centrally, where the
beacon ID is used to check if the vehicle-parking place was previously paid for or not.
This is performed by an App (in the case of Lisbon the e-parking App from EMEL
(epark.emel.pt)). This ad hoc transmission checks the beacon ID and verifies if it is paid
for. Infraction data can be immediately sent to the nearest parking agent who can then
issue an infraction ticket, or the central system can send the invoice directly to the
vehicle’s owner. Figure 1 shows the overall working idea for the main system with
beacon signals captured by mobile devices and position is added and transmitted to a
central server. This information is used to check if the parking spot is reserved or not.
To avoid errors, because users can receive beacons from a moving vehicle in front of
the parking place, the system waits for a second notification from a different user before
proceeding with the identification of a violation.

investment costs using an ad hoc network of user mobile device collaborative process.

In terms of communication, Fig. 2 illustrates the process, with a local Bluetooth
communication with a range of 20–30 m between vehicle beacon and mobile user
device and a HTTP connection from the mobile device to the central server.
4 Identification of Free Parking Slots Based on User Input
We developed an interface to allow an easy report on the number of free parking places
in a street or to alert that the booked parking place will be free within x minutes. This
collaborative process only requires power from users’ mobile devices and consumes
network communication, but since we are transmitting data in usual communication
packages, this communication process does not have any impact on prices. This col-
laborative reporting can be performed by: (1) drivers in a car using NLP (Natural
Language Processing), where the application asks about the number of identified
available places the driver saw. The application is calibrated to understand numbers in
different languages (we tested in English and Portuguese); (2) Pedestrians, who give
feedback about a number of places available on the street. Geo-referencing is available
through GPS on mobile devices. Under these conditions, the user needs only to
introduce an estimation of the number of free places he remembers on that street.
Figure 3 shows the automatic voice recognition process implemented.
These two crowdsensing approaches are complementary, and users are incentivized
to participate by the reward mechanisms introduced. Every input performed that match
average performed in a pre-defined window time (this is to avoid spam inputs without
any sense) gives free parking minutes in a city.
For drivers, it is possible to integrate mobile devices into the vehicle’s infotainment
systems, it is possible to create an easy interface for drivers to give feedback about
empty parking places while driving.
We tested several approaches regarding the reward. We tested using a population of
90 information providers (60 drivers and 30 pedestrians) in a three months test.
Fig. 3. Users inputs of free space using a voice to text recognize the system
A Blockchain and Gamification Approach for Smart Parking 9
In a first scenario, every input gave 5 min of free parking in a green zone (low-cost
parking area). During the test period, we had an average of 43 notifications per day
(monthly notification divided by the working days). This rewards gave around 3.6 h of
free parking in a green zone per day;
In a second scenario, every input gave 1 min of free parking in a green zone.
During the test period, we had an average of 9 notifications per day. This reward gave
around 9 min of free parking in a green zone. This meant we should increase the
reward.
In the third and last scenario, every input gave 10 min of free parking in the green
zone. During the test period, we had an average of 58 notifications per day. Perhaps this
is too much.
As a model, the system depends on the numbers of users versus the number of
notifications received. Lisbon has about half a million people living, a surface of 100
thousand km2 and around 1500 streets [19].
To be able to work in peak times (9am to 6pm), the system needs notifications with
a periodicity of 5 min; we need around 108 notifications per street. In the remaining
hours of the day: (1) 6pm to 12am and 6am to 9am, we need notifications with a
periodicity of about 10 min, which gives 90 notifications per street; and (2) the
remaining time, from 12am to 6am, only hour to hour notifications are required. This
gives the need for 200 notifications per day per street, which is about 300 thousand per
day. Estimating a goal of 50 notifications per user per day, the system needs 6000
users. Figure 4 illustrates this process.
To avoid spam we need more notifications to extract the average, deviations are
treated as spam, and those users can be removed from the system. To avoid the creation
of different logins, users are validated based on the fiscal number.

5 Eco-Parking Development
We incorporate the most advanced techniques of data visualization, especially for what
concerns the ease of discrimination of the target of interest vs. the rest of the picture.
The application is developed in the Java language and available for installation on
devices with the Android operating system. The application can be obtained through
the following link [20].
The Google Firebase platform was used to create a NoSQL Cloud Firestore data
base with great flexibility, with the possibility of performing very complex database
queries with minimal server performance. An authentication system has been created in
the application that is interconnected with the Firestore database that establishes the
connection between the user and the entries in the database that the user performs. The
Maps API, was used to implement the map in the application, and with extensive API
exploration, it was possible to modify and add features. The search was used as a
reference to the Autocomplete Places of Google that presents suggestions related to
search criteria entered by the user. An internal link has been implemented between the
search module, map module, and database module so that they can communicate
seamlessly with each other.
The application requires that location permissions be given, as it collects infor-
mation from the user’s current geo-location. When you start the application for the first
time, you will be prompted to give these permissions. The application requires regis-
tration since it is necessary to identify the users who contribute the information. In
addition, to better organize and structure the database, it was also decided to record the
database data. If you already have an account, you can log in by clicking the “Log In”
button at the bottom of the screen, see Fig. 5. All fields are required. If during the
registration process the user does not fill in one of the fields, it will be duly identified
with a red color. If you already have an account, this login screen will have to identify
you with the email and password that you used during the registration process. During
confirmation of the personal data between the server and the application, a progress bar
will be displayed. If there is a failure in authentication, a notification balloon will be
presented to the user. Otherwise, the application will proceed to the main screen of the
application. The main application screen consists of the map and the menu bar that
contains a search bar. Since it is an application that presents the user with the location
of the searched place and presents information on the number of available parking
places, it has been chosen to simplify as much as possible so that the user can get the
desired result without having to click and navigate a lot in the application until you get
the result. In the lower left corner is the button that centralizes the map at the user’s
current position. In the bottom right corner the zoom feature. The search bar is centered
on the menu bar containing the button that expands the menu (left button) and the voice
search button. Clicking the menu button displays the screens available in the appli-
cation. To simplify the use of the App, the whole focus was given to the main screen
(“Search for Parking”), (see Fig. 6(a)). If one wants to enter information about the
number of vacant spots in a particular location, he can do so by selecting the “Insert
Parking” menu option. The Developer Board is only used by the application developer
to facilitate the tests he needs to perform. For identification purposes, the user data is
A Blockchain and Gamification Approach for Smart Parking 11
displayed at the top of the menu (name and email that was used during the registration
process). During the search process, entering characters into the search bar will give the
user suggestions about what the user has entered. A limitation was applied in the
survey in relation to Country (Portugal) and city (Lisbon), since the focus of the test
was only the city of Lisbon. When choosing one of the search suggestions/results, the
screen centers the selected location by placing a pin in that location. During the search
process, entering characters into the search bar will give the user suggestions about
what the user has entered.

parking space with a time window and (d) screen of a user input about free places in a street
12 J. C. Ferreira et al.
If the user selects the “Statistics” button (see Fig. 6(b) and (c)), the list of existing
information will be displayed with the number of vacancies identified with the time it
was entered. If the option to register the number of vacant posts from the “+” button is
chosen from the side menu, the following screen will be displayed identifying the
location in question and the field of insertion of the vacancy number. By submitting
information (see Fig. 6(d)), it will be sent to the server and can be instantly queried by
performing a search.
6 Conclusion
We show a collaborative network of beacon data collection to implement a parking
control approach without the existing of a dedicated solution and also a collaborative
approach to marking empty park space. Users win free minutes parking places,
authorities saves on control process and also users receive information about free
parking places., save time and money on looking for then.. also CO2 is decrease
because less Km were performed by drivers in the parking process. We implemented
one of the first approach using blockchain platforms to handle this collaborative
transaction. Users can participate in this process and collect free parking minutes for
their own usage. This proposal needs a complete electronic solution for parking pay-
ment and needs beacons that are not implemented in every vehicle, but the economic
benefits are considerable because there is not the need of a dedicated infrastructure. The
current payment solution can be adapted for the connection between vehicle plate
number to a beacon reference. Identification of free parking places is essential infor-
mation to handle the problem of guidance of drivers to free parking places. Again, a
significant advantage of this system is that it can work without large investments on
sensors or other related equipment.
Future Work - A large scale testing will be explored to explore the potential of
gamification with a large number of involved users.
