Abstract: Nowadays, many organizations and individual users are employing cloud services ex-
tensively due to their efficiency, reliability and low cost. A key aspect for cloud data centers is to
achieve management methods to reduce energy consumption, increasing the profit and reducing the
environmental impact, which is critical in the deployment of leading-edge technologies today such
as blockchain and digital finances, IoT, online gaming and video streaming. In this review, various
clustering, optimization, and machine learning methods used in cloud resource allocation to increase
the energy efficiency and performance are analyzed, compared and classified. Specifically, on the
one hand, we discuss how clustering methods and optimization techniques are widely applied in
energy management due to their capacity to provide solutions for energy consumption reduction.
On the other hand, we study how multi-objective optimization methods focus on reducing energy
consumption as well as service level agreement (SLA) violation, and improving quality of services
(QoS) simultaneously. Also, we discuss how optimization methods such as the firefly algorithm,
whale optimization algorithm (WOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm
(GA) provide the highest performance in the field. Moreover, we analyze how machine learning
methods such as deep neural network (DNN), random forest, and support vector machine (SVM)
are applied to the prediction of energy consumption in the cloud, showing an accurate performance
in this prediction. Nevertheless, we study how the existing methods still have limitations of low
convergence, trap into local optima and overfitting.

1. Introduction
Cloud computing is an important platform for providing reliable and secure services
and it is considered by many organizations as well as individual users due to its reliability,
cost and scalability [1–3]. Especially in IT services, cloud computing is the predominant
approach to reduce costs for computing consumers. This approach influences the method
and technology used for processing, constructing and managing IT within the enterprise
and the service provider. Particularly, cloud computing encompasses four main entities
such as virtual machines (VM), physical machines (PM), resource allocators and clients.
Clients request access to resources such as CPU, memory and physical memory to the

cloud, and the cloud provides the services and the resources for the users based on the
SLA to perform the user task [4,5]. Typically, VMs are allocated in PMs in the cloud to
provide the services to the users. VMs require the estimation needed to provide the given
workloads and QoS to improve the resource efficiency and reduce the cost [6]. Data centers
hosting the cloud services require massive power, contributing high carbon footprints to
the environment. Thus, energy consumption reduction is required in the cloud data centers
to improve the profit for the cloud service provider (CSP), and reduce cost to the users and
environmental impact [7,8].
Moreover, a trade-off solution for low energy consumption and high performance
is required to achieve dynamic consolidation of VMs. The PM utilization must be kept
low to reduce the overloading of hosts for future resource needs [9,10]. This causes poor
resource utilization and underutilization servers consume more energy. The VM migration
is a solution to the problem and an optimal level of performance needs to be selected
to save energy [11,12]. Typically, cloud consumers are billed for used resources and
time, not the consumed energy in the cloud services and thus the CSP needs to reduce
the energy consumption in the infrastructure to increase the profit [13,14]. Hence, the
energy consumption must be reduced while maintaining the QoS to support green cloud
computing [15].
Part of this research is focused on the analysis of the relation between the cloud re-
sources (CPU, RAM and disk) to energy consumption [16–18], and SLA violation [19,20].
A mathematical model describes the network activity that helps to apply the optimization
methods and provide an effective solution to reduce the energy consumption. Generally,
there are three types of method applied in the cloud data center to reduce the energy con-
sumption, namely clustering, optimization and machine learning. The clustering methods
are usually applied to cluster the workloads to reduce the energy consumption and SLA vi-
olation for the resource allocation in the cloud data center. For example, the SCOOTER [21]
method is applied to maintain the trade-off between the energy consumption, SLA and
QoS. The k-means clustering methods [22–25] are the commonly applied methods for
the resource allocation in cloud data centers. The hybrid method of k-means, imperialist
competition algorithm (ICA) and decision tree methods are applied in the cloud to provide
effective performance in resource allocation [22]. Two real cloud datasets were used to test
the hybrid method and results showed that the hybrid method has higher performance in
resource allocation. The main limitation of k-means clustering is the random allocation of
the cluster center and k-means ++ method is applied to overcome this problem.
The optimization methods [26–34] are the most commonly applied techniques in the
cloud data center to reduce the energy consumption and SLA violation. The optimization
methods analyze the cloud parameters of mathematical models and provide an effective
solution for the energy consumption. The firefly algorithm [27], whale optimization
algorithm [28], heuristic method [29], and cat swarm optimization [30] are applied in
the cloud for resource allocation, energy consumption, VM migration, SLA and QoS.
These optimization methods focus on the single-objective of resource allocation, energy
consumption and SLA violation. However, the models need to focus on the multi-objective
that also includes improvement in QoS, simultaneously along with reduction in energy
consumption, and SLA violation. Therefore, multi-objective optimization methods [32–37]
are applied to simultaneously improve the QoS, to reduce energy consumption and to
decrease SLA violation. The NSGA-II is one of the notable optimization methods used in
the cloud data centers, which provides effective performance. The NSGA-II with ANN [33]
was applied to handle the cloud resource and it delivered an effective performance. The
IBBO method [36] showed effective performance in energy consumption, resource load
balance, average resource utilization and availability. Therefore, optimization methods are
important in the cloud data center to provide effective solutions and the multi-objective
optimization methods handle the trade-off between various parameters.
Another taxonomy in the cloud energy consumption is the machine learning meth-
ods [38–40] and this is applied to predict higher energy consumption and SLA violation.
Energies 2021, 14, 5322 3 of 18
The resource allocation is provided based on the predicted results of the machine learning
to avoid higher energy consumption and SLA violation. The commonly applied machine
learning methods are the support vector machine (SVM) [38,39] and deep neural network
(DNN) [40]. The DNN model shows better prediction performance compared to the SVM.
Machine learning models require the historical data to train the network and apply it for
the classification. Some research involves applying the machine learning and optimization
model for resource allocation, which results in a highly effective performance.
Hence, three types of model are used for energy management in the cloud resource
allocation: clustering, optimization and machine learning. Each strategy follows different
ways to reduce the energy consumption, such as clustering methods, which select the
cluster heads, optimization that finds the suitable parameter settings, and machine learning
techniques, which predict the risk of high energy consumption. Existing surveys are unclear
about the cluster, optimization and machine learning taxonomy in cloud energy manage-
ment and its suitability in the cloud environment. This study discusses the advantages and
limitations of models in the cloud energy management for resource allocation.
Optimization methods apply energy models and perform the search for various input
parameters like VM migration, resource allocation, etc. to find suitable parameter settings
for lower energy consumption. On the other hand, clustering methods involve selecting
the cluster heads for the similar tasks and nodes to perform the task with less energy
consumption. The clustering methods do not perform a search process or change the input
variable for cloud energy consumption. Machine learning models utilize the features of the
cloud parameters for training the model and predict the risk of high energy consumption
in the future. Basically, optimization methods perform a search to find suitable input
parameters, clustering models select cluster heads to perform tasks, and machine learning
models are used for prediction of high energy consumption risk.
The recent increase in the number of cloud applications such as streaming services,
database management, digital finances, and cloud gaming motivates many researchers to
work in the fields of energy management and VM allocation in the cloud. Various methods
are applied in the cloud data centers for the optimization of energy consumption. Various
strategies of models were carried out to optimize the cloud data centers in terms of energy
and SLA. The contributions of this paper are discussed as follows:
1. This paper reviews the recent methods in the clustering, optimization and machine
learning in energy management for resource allocation in the cloud. Various models’
advantage and limitations in cloud environment are discussed.
2. Various optimization models applied in existing cloud for energy management and
their limitations are reviewed. The review shows that most of the optimization models
suffer from local optima and poor convergence.
3. This paper focuses not only on energy consumption, but also on SLA violation and
QoS, simultaneously. The review shows that multi-objective optimization models
handles the better tradeoff in the output parameters.
4. A review of machine learning models shows that DNN often provides the higher
prediction performance and thus, it has the capability of predicting risk of high energy
consumption.
5. Limitations in the existing methods are discussed in this study. Furthermore, this
review provides the potential solution to overcome such limitations in the cloud
energy management.
This paper is organized in the following manner: applications of energy consumption
in cloud data centers are described in Section 2; a review of the energy consumption by
clustering, optimization and machine learning models is discussed in Section 3; the recent
methods of energy management in cloud are reviewed in Section 4; the problem definitions
of the existing methods are provided in Section 5; the future scope of the research are given
in Section 6; and the conclusion is stated in Section 7.

2. Applications of Energy Consumption in Cloud Data Centers
The optimization, clustering and machine learning methods applied in cloud data
centers are required in many applications to fulfill the objectives of energy consumption
reduction, SLA violation reduction and QoS improvement, etc. Some of the important and
recent applications which are now in demand are discussed below.
1. Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime etc., are providing users with flexible
streaming and QoS. Streaming services require the optimization method to provide
the optimal parameter settings such as resource allocation, bandwidth limit etc., to
provide effective performance and reduce energy consumption [8]. Machine learning
methods are required in the streaming services to provide the effective resource
allocation to fulfill high demand, and high energy consumption in the cloud.
2. Large companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google are deploying
their cloud for the public cloud infrastructure [2]. Optimization methods are applied
in this cloud to handle the energy consumption and demand.
3. Diverse works [5,10] show that cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Elastic Compute cloud (EC2), Microsoft’s Photo Gallery face recognition, Facebook
automatic face tagging, Google glass object recognition, and Google Goggles required
an energy optimization model to improve the performance.
4. Furthermore, machine learning methods are applied in the cloud services for the
detection of attacks such as distributed denial of services (DDoS), and blocking the
victim infrastructure, to protect the users [2].
5. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest developing fields and highly adaptive
in many industries for monitoring and control [3,5]. IoT stores and processes the
data in cloud computing to provide excellent performance. Energy optimization in
cloud-IoT is required in the industry to provide ideal performance and profit [3].
6. Generally, cloud computing provides three types of service known as software as a
service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) [4,6].
Optimization methods are required in all these three types of services for the resource
allocation, energy consumption and SLA violation.
7. Blockchain and digital finances are leading technologies today, which are currently
limited by the huge energy required in many implementations with a high economic
impact [4,6].
3. Review of Energy Consumption in Cloud Data Centers
Energy optimization in cloud data centers helps to increase the profit for the cloud
service providers (CSP) and also reduce the cloud cost for the users and environmental
impact. Important energy optimizations in the cloud are based on the CPU, storage, disk
and VM allocation for the users and they are considered in this work. Specifically, the
more extended techniques applied for the energy management in the cloud are clustering,
optimization, and machine learning techniques. The difference from the existing survey
and the current summary is provided in Table 1, which highlights the current importance
of this work.

The common key objectives of the methods applied in energy management in the
cloud are discussed as follows:
1. Clustering techniques are mainly applied to select the cluster head or similar types
of workload to effectively apply the resources to the users. The clustering method

recognizes a similar group of workloads and analyses the resource availability for the
resource allocation.
2. Optimization methods involve in the analysis of the network parameters such as
CPU, RAM and disk availability related to the energy consumption and SLA for the
allocation. Optimization methods are used as an attempt to find the solution for the
allocation based on objective rather than similar types of workload.
3. Machine learning methods involve identifying the risk factors such as high energy
consumption or high SLA violation based on the historical data. These prediction
results were used to avoid the high energy consumption and high SLA violation in
the cloud resource allocation.
The energy management can be classified as static and dynamic energy management.
Machine learning models are applied in static energy management based on the cloud data
centers’ historical data. The dynamic energy management is classified into component-
based and node-based models. The component-based models apply optimization methods
to find suitable parameter settings for a cloud component. The node-based models involve
in applying a clustering method to find similar nodes to perform the task with less energy
consumption. The clustering methods involved in the allocation of the resources are based
on node data. The optimization methods focus on the reduction of energy consumption,
SLA violation, and improve the QoS. The machine learning methods help to make the
decision of the allocation based on the past network data to provide effective allocation.
The proposed taxonomy of the methods for energy management in the cloud is shown

overfitting and imbalance data problem in the risk prediction. A deep learning model 
generates more features that create overfitting problems and fewer instances for high 
energy consumption in the dataset creates an imbalance data problem. In dynamic en-
ergy consumption, optimization methods easily trap local optima and poor convergence.

model.

to present the considered energy models. In this sense, it must be said here that logic

3.1. Static and Dynamic Energy Model
Before going into the insights of energy consumption in resource allocation, it is key to
present the considered energy models. In this sense, it must be said here that logic circuits
of complementary metal oxide semi-conductor (CMOS) power consumption are used to
derive the static and dynamic energy consumption. The CMOS microprocessor is the sum
of capacitive power and leakage power of a short-circuit. The factors that affect the CMOS
power consumption are power-dissipation capacitance, output loading, input voltage level,
input rise time, and output voltage.
CMOS power consumption is classified as:
1. Static Power Consumption
2. Dynamic Power Consumption
Energies 2021, 14, 5322 6 of 18
Static Power Consumption: Generally, CMOS devices have low static power con-
sumption and circuits are not in the charging state due to all the input detained at a certain
logic level of validity, which commonly occurs in CMOS power consumption. A leakage
current is the main cause of power consumption and the product of supply voltage Sv and
leakage current Lc is static power consumption Pstatic, as given in Equation (1).
Pstatic = ∑(Lc × Sv) (1)
Dynamic Power Consumption: This occurs by the CMOS shifting to high frequency.
Dynamic power consumption Pdynamic denotes the power consumption of capacitive-load
Pcl , the sum of transient power consumption Pt and overall power consumption, as given
in Equation (2) [43–45].
Pdynamic = (PTransient + Pcl) (2)
Transient power consumption PTransient denotes the current flow that occurs in switch-
ing transistors devices that switch from one logic state to another state. This requires
charging of internal nodes and current flow from the voltage common collector (VCC) to
ground (GND). The PTransient is calculated using Equation (3).
PTransient =
(
Cpd ×V2
cc × fin × Nsw
)
(3)
Transient power consumption is denoted as PTransient, supply voltage is denoted as
Vcc, input signal frequency is denoted as fin, number of bits to be switched is denoted as
Nsw, capacitance of dynamic power-dissipation is denoted as Cpd. If they are switching
and output has the same load at same output frequency, then capacitive load power
consumption Pcl is measured using Equation (4),
Pcl =
(
C1 ×V2
cc × f0 × Nsw
)
(4)
where power consumption of capacitive load power is denoted as Pcl , the frequency of
output signal is denoted as f0, the load capacitance is denoted as Cl , and the number of
output switching is denoted as Nsw. The energy consumption of an application (Eapp) in
parallel execution mode is given in Equations (5) and (6).

of tasks to be executed is denoted as n, the product of number of switch and frequency is
denoted as a, the supply voltage is denoted as vi, the total time taken for i task execution is
denoted as ti.
3.2. Energy Consumption
Energy consumption is computed in cloud data centers based on the CPU, memory
and disk storage [16–18]. Energy consumption is usually calculated based on the CPU
utilization in the cloud. The linear model is one of the most common energy consumption
models that involves measuring the linear correlation between the energy consumption
and CPU utilization. The energy consumption EC definitions are given in Equations (7)
Energies 2021, 14, 5322 7 of 18
and (8) based on the kth server with static coefficient ρ at time t. The energy consumption
of server Hk in the process is denoted in Equation (8).
ECk(t) =

where PCk denotes the power consumption by the kth server. The CPU utilization changed
at time t according to independent variable U of workload. Then, the mathematical
Equation (9) is used to compute the total energy consumption of a cloud data center with s
nodes as follows:

3.3. Service Level Agreement (SLA) Violation
The SLA is used to define QoS in the cloud datacenters and this measures the services
provided to the users [16,19,20]. If a user places excessive demands on the data centers, an
SLA violation occurs. The computer performance is significantly reduced if a host is re-
signed. The VM migration process consumes additional resources. The system availability
and reliability are measured in the degree of SLA violation. Various metrics are used to
measure SLA violation, as shown in Equations (10)–(12).

computing power. The Cj is defined as CPU power of VM j.
3.4. Clustering Method in Energy Management
Some researchers apply the clustering method for the cloud data centers to the energy
efficiency in resource allocation. This sub-section provides the details of the clustering
methods applied to the energy consumption in the cloud. The overview of the clustering
method in energy management is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Overview of clustering method in energy management. 
Gill and Buyya [21] proposed a method named as SCOOTER for the 
self-management of cloud resources and the execution of cluster workloads to minimize 
the energy consumption, SLA violation and improve the QoS of the services. The per-
formance of the SCOOTER method is evaluated in the cloud environment and analyzes 
the metrics of cost, energy consumption, and QoS. The result shows that energy con-
sumption and SLA violation is reduced, and increased the QoS based on optimal alloca-
tion of VM. The random initialization of the SCOOTER clustering method affects the 
performance of the developed method in energy optimization. 
Shahidinejad et al. [22] presented a hybrid solution to handle the resource allocation 
for a workload in the cloud environment. The k-means clustering and ICA method is 
applied to the resource allocation. The decision tree method also applied in this research 
to decide the efficient solution for the resource allocation. The two real workloads in the 
cloud are used to test the efficiency of the hybrid method. The hybrid method has higher 
performance in optimization of cloud. The model performance is tested on the less 
workload and decision tree method has instable performance. 
Haghighi et al. [23] introduced a hybrid method of resource allocation for mapping 
task and dynamic consolidation. The micro-genetic algorithm is applied to improve the 
performance of the optimization in the clustering process. The CloudSim simulation is 
used to test the performance of the developed method for energy efficiency. The devel-
oped method provides a good trade-off between the energy consumption and quality of 
services (QoS). The clustering method has the random initialization and optimization 
method has lower convergence in the analysis. 
Mydhili et al. [24] proposed multi-stage parallel K-means ++ clustering algorithm 
with balanced clustering for energy efficiency in the cloud. Various conventional meth-
ods were applied for the data collection, aggregation and communication. The NS2 tool 
was used to test the efficiency of the developed method. The clustering method had the 
highest performance in energy efficiency and cloud management. The parameters such 
as CPU, storage, and VM migration were not considered for the optimization. 
Haseeb et al. [25] presented the Secure Sensor Cloud Architecture (SASC) for IoT 
network to improve the network scalability. The unsupervised machine learning was 
applied to group the network nodes and exploit weighted based centroid networks. The 
NS3 tool was used to develop and test the performance of the SASC method in the cloud. 
The SASC method has higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption, network life-
time and packet drop ratio. The SLA and QoS parameters are not considered in this 
method for the optimization in the cloud.

Alarif and Tolba [26] proposed a reinforcement method of adaptive Q-learning 
(AQL) to reduce the energy and overhead tradeoff in the IoT network. The AQL method 
selects the cluster head and perform a forward selection in the network. AQL improve 
the inter and intra communication cluster for optimization of the network. The simula-
tion shows that the AQL has the highest efficiency in the optimization of the network in 
terms of energy consumption. Priya et al. [27] proposed the energy-efficient cloud-based 
IoT and the wind-driven optimization method is applied to reduce the energy consump-
tion. The firefly algorithm is applied to select the optimal cluster head in the method. The 
developed method has higher performance compared to the artificial bee colony (ABC), 
genetic algorithm (GA), and adaptive gravitational search algorithm.  
Peng et al. [28] presented the whale optimization method for the optimal task 
workflow scheduling process for the dynamic scaling and frequency scaling technique. 
The joint optimization involves providing a tradeoff between the energy consumption 
and performance of the network. The WOA method has higher efficiency in terms of 
energy consumption and cost. Yadav et al. [29] proposed an adaptive heuristic method 
for the minimization of the energy consumption and improving the performance. The 
developed method analyzes the CPU utilization based on the resource utilization, VM 
selection and SLA violation. The developed method was tested in the CloudSim and

(WOA), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), BAT, cat swarm optimization (CSO), and particle
swarm optimization (PSO) for the energy efficiency, load balancing, and better resource
allocation in the cloud environment. The developed WOA method has the highest efficiency
compared to the other optimization method.
Reddy et al. [32] introduced a bi-objective optimization technique to increase the
energy efficiency and performance of data-parallel processing. The global parent optimal

performance of energy management.
Azizi, et al. [34] presented a heuristic algorithm focused on energy consumption and
resource wastage in the cloud. The proposed MinPR method prioritizes the power-efficient
nodes and reduces the number of active physical machines to reduce the energy consump-
tion. The resource usage factor model is developed to manage VM allocation using reward
and penalty method. The heuristic algorithm has the highest efficiency in Amazon EC2 in
terms of energy. Abohamama and Hamouda et al. [35] proposed a improved permutation-
based GA method and a multidimensional resource aware best fit allocation strategy to
reduce the energy consumption in the cloud. The CPU, RAM and bandwidth were consid-
ered in this method for the resource allocation. The result shows that the hybrid method
achieves the balanced usage of the active user that reduces the energy consumption. Liu
et al. [36] consider four objectives for the virtual clusters to reduces the energy consumption
and improve the performance. The four objectives are energy consumption, resource load
balance, average resource utilization and availability. The improved binary biogeography-
based optimization (IBBO) method is applied to improve the performance in the cloud. The
IBBO method has the highest efficiency in optimization in terms of energy consumption.
Saeedi et al. [37] proposed Multi objective PSO method consider four parameters such
as energy, cost, makespan and reliability. The non-dominated solutions can apply to the
multi-objective PSO in equilibrium state. The results show that the multi-objective PSO has
the higher efficiency in optimization of the cloud.
The firefly algorithm, GA, PSO, and WOA provide efficient performance in optimiza-
tion in terms of energy consumption. Existing optimization methods have the limitation of
lower convergence and easily trap local optima.

5. Summary of Challenges from Reviewed Studies
From the review of recent methods in energy efficiency in cloud data centers resource
allocation some important issues have been discussed in this section:
• Most studies consider the energy consumption and QoS as the parameters to analyze
the energy efficiency in resource allocation. The SLA violation, reliability and makespan
are also need to be considered in the methods for effective cloud performance.
• Clustering methods are applied in the existing research to choose the cluster nodes
and perform resource allocation. The random initialization in the clustering method
affects the performance of the cluster model.
• Evolutionary optimization methods like WOA, PSO, GA, and the firefly algorithm
have efficient performance in energy management. Existing optimization methods
have the limitations of lower convergences and easily trap local optima.
• The SVM and random forest methods are applied for the prediction of energy con-
sumption in the cloud and allocate the resource to improve the energy efficiency. The
SVM method has the lowest performance in the data imbalance problem. Random
forest has overfitting problems when the number of trees is high in the model and has
lower performance when number of trees is low.
• The DNN model has the highest performance in the prediction of energy consumption
in the cloud data center. The DNN model has the limitation of the overfitting problem
due to the feature process in the model.
6. Future Scope
As studied, management in resource allocation is a key aspect in energy efficiency,
and the improvement is generally achieved by various soft-computing methods. It is
observed that existing limitations in energy management demands the need for creating
new innovative methods to improve the cloud performance. In particular, the following
aspects should be considered:
1. Multi-objective optimization methods are needed to handle the energy consumption,
QoS and SLA violation. NSGA-II has provided higher performance in multi-objective
optimization and poor convergence. Multi-objective methods with high convergence
are needed to improve the efficiency of the model.
Energies 2021, 14, 5322 16 of 18
2. The k-means clustering proper initialization needs to be provided to achieve higher
performance in cluster the workloads in the various scenarios of the cloud. The
k-means clustering random initialization does not guarantee the best solution in
various scenarios.
3. DNN with effective feature selection technique needs to be applied to improve the
efficiency of the model and to overcome the limitation of overfitting problem. DNN
has the overfitting problem that affects its performance.
4. Apart from the DNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) delivers efficient performance
in handling the sequence of data and provides efficient classification. The LSTM has a
higher potential in prediction of energy consumption and SLA violation.
5. Time efficiency is one of the important factors that most of the existing researches
did not consider in the analysis. Time efficiency in the cloud technology must be
maintained to facilitate smooth operations of the real-time cloud systems to get an
edge over the competitors.
7. Conclusions
In this review, various methods of clustering, optimization, and machine learning
methods for the energy management in cloud resource allocation were discussed, and a
taxonomy was proposed. As analyzed, on the one hand, most of the clustering methods
applied the k-means based method. The k-means based methods have the limitation
of random initial cluster that affects the efficiency of the model. On the other hand,
optimization methods such as the WOA, firefly algorithm, PSO and GA methods has
higher efficiency in terms of energy. Optimization methods have the limitations of the
lower convergence and easily trap into local optima. Machine learning methods such
as DNN, SVM, and random forest were applied for the energy consumption prediction
and allocate the resource based on the prediction. The DNN method has the limitation of
overfitting problem and the SVM method has lower performance in the imbalance dataset.
Some of the existing research that displayed higher performance in the energy management
employed the WOA, and DNN methods. Also, the NSGA-II optimization method is highly
efficient for multi-objective optimization to optimize the energy consumption. Mostly,
the optimization methods have limitations of being trapped in local optima and poor
convergence. In the future, statistical methods should be applied to provide a better
convergence and to increase the exploration and exploitation of the optimization methods
in cloud energy management for resource allocation.
