Abstract
Digitalization, automatization, and social media interaction do not only influence
our everyday lives but also change the way we think (Naughton, J. The internet: Is
it changing the way we think? The Guardian, 2010) and especially, how we solve
complex tasks. People search and find answers to complex questions via Google,

Apple Siri, Amazon Echo, and all different types of expert-platforms. The more
complex the questions are, the more often online-based answers are searched, and
it seems to work in a lot of cases: in 2011, “IBM’s Watson question-answering
system won the TV gameshow Jeopardy” (Jurafsky and Martin 2017). This
analysis is about a special sort of jeopardy. It is about one of the most dominant
topics for entrepreneurs and self-employed people: the tax system. In the follow-
ing, the complexity of tax regimes will be discussed within the frame of its
digitization ability and with a modern interpretation of the concept of disruption,
an economic concept by twentieth-century economist Josef A. Schumpeter (Pyka
and Andersen 2013): What can be digitized will be digitized – sooner or later. By
analyzing digital tax administration, this analysis is an academic contribution to
the ongoing debate of digital facilitation versus digital disruption, how far digital
applications should be used to make old systems just more efficient or can only be
efficient, if used to design new disruptive digital systems. In near future, digital
end-to-end tax systems might replace today’s complex preregistration tax regimes
for entrepreneurs and self-employed people. Online tax accounts eliminate the
problem of “unreported income” and can make the tax declaration of individuals
(employees or self-employed) and of companies (particularly of small-sized and
medium-sized enterprises) much easier and cheaper, because then public tax
authorities also would provide new services and service qualities. In addition,
there is a need for an Epistemic Tax Policy, which offers opportunities to see,
whether the designed and applied tools in taxation meet the test of reality; this
furthermore leads to routes of further improving tax systems.

Introduction
This analysis is a contribution to the discussion on how cyber-development and
digitalization will change the way how public administrations deal with their
residents. Citizenship and monetary participation are linked since the third millen-
nium BC. Documents of that time show that in Egypt administrators called for a
harvest tax and a Nile-tax (Klinkott et al. 2007). Today, federal and local budgets are
still tax based. But over the time, tax systems and regimes became more and more
complicated. It has gotten so complex that there is a ranking of the “easiest and most
complex jurisdictions in the world for accounting and tax compliance”. The “Finan-
cial Complexity Index 2017” (The Financial Complexity Index 2017), published by
the “Netherlands-headquartered TMF Group,” examines “the varied complexities of
maintaining accounting and tax compliance across 94 jurisdictions worldwide.” But
with new digital structures and mobile applications, there are new possibilities to
raise tax-income without raising taxes.

Digitalization of Tax Regimes: The Macroeconomic Dimension
A study of the University of Chicago showed that in 2012 Greek self-employed
workers and freelancers hid almost half of their income in front of the financial
authorities in 2009. According to the study, the deducted taxes amounted to 11.2
billion euros. If freelancers and self-employed honestly pay their taxes, the country
would be far better off, the study concludes (The Financial Complexity Index
2017).
Tax fairness has a lot of dimensions, but it is a macroeconomic truth that when
everyone pays taxes, everyone pays less taxes (Smith 1776; Wagner 1880;
Neumark 1970). For that reason, the IMF started to consider the implementation
of electronic devices in different developed states and evaluated the results (IMF,
WP/15/73).
After several administrations implemented electronic fiscal devices (EFDs) in
their tax system for sales and value-added tax (VAT), the IMF concluded that it hakes
“effort and has costs both for the administration and for the taxpayers that are
affected by the requirements” and “despite their widespread use, and their consid-
erable cost, EFDs can only be effective if they are a part of a comprehensive
compliance improvement strategy that clearly identifies risks for the different seg-
ments of taxpayers and envisages measures to mitigate these risks” (Casey and
Castro 2015).
The IMF summed up EFDs “as with any other technological improvement
the deployment of fiscal devices alone cannot achieve meaningful results, whether
in terms of revenue gains or permanent compliance improvements” (Casey and
Castro 2015).
After considering these experiences by the IMF, one can say that EFD imple-
mentation would be more effective with the use of an online tax account system
communicating with mentioned fiscal devices. EFDs, like electronic tax registers,
are more effective when they are not stand-alone-units but work together with fiscal
data applications of governments (tax administrations). Information exchanges
between tax administrations and companies lead to better tax transparency, easier
tax collection, and tax fairness.
Digital Facilitation Versus Digital Disruption
Today, especially tax consultants are responsible for tax transparency. In many cases,
they are the link between the tax administration and tax payers, particularly when
they are companies or self-employed people. But tax consultants may face the end of
their business basis when tax administrations start to implement digital tax systems
to generate more information, payment, and legal security. From the time when the
process of digitalization started in the 1990s, traditional tax consultants have tried to
implement more online services in their customer relations business. But the ques-
tion is, if this will be enough to compete with the possibility to a digitalized tax
administration in future.
6 Digitalization of Tax: Epistemic Tax Policy 89
Digital Facilitation
Germany is one of the top-rated countries when it comes to tax consulting. Tax
consulters state that a large share of the whole worldwide literature that is being
published on tax is actually being published in the German language. But since
digitization has advanced, German tax consultants face huge competition with
digital tax consulting platforms, where clients get and receive personalized tax
advice via the Internet. “Data and evaluations are exchanged via the secure entre-
preneurial portal, the accounting is done in the cloud” (felix1.de AG 2017). Tradi-
tional German tax consultants are not used to face any sort of business-threatening
competition. What happened in Germany some years ago, in the field of tax
consulting, was some type of transformation of service: from human interaction to
digital facilitation. Online tax consultants for companies, entrepreneurs, and private
individuals facilitate tax management via online collection of data (incomes, reve-
nues, expenses, salaries) by OCR-scanning (optical character recognition) applica-
tions or input by hand. Since online-tax-applications gained market shares,
traditional tax consultants have to deal with the change of their business and try to
develop new business areas for themselves using client consulting software (dpa in
Handelsblatt 2016). It is pretty clear that all potentials of facilitation of online tax that
consultants use today, could also be used by federal tax administrations, so:
– What if governments and tax administrations begin to digitalize their tax regimes?
– Is a future thinkable where individuals and small-company owners have the
possibility to interact with tax administrations like with banking houses: having
an always-on account?
Estonia already integrated digital signatures and electronic tax claims that have
already lowered bureaucracy and facilitated tax management. “In Estonia 98% of
companies are established online, 99% of banking transactions are made online and
95% of tax declarations are filed online” (e-estonia 2017). But Estonia is not the only
country in Europe, changing the way of generating tax.
In the UK, the government’s plan “to make it easier for individuals and businesses
to get their tax right and keep on top of their affairs” is called “Making Tax Digital.”
The UKs “Making Tax Digital roadmap” was published in December 2015 and will
be implemented completely in 2020. “By 2020, customers will be able to see a
comprehensive financial picture in their digital account, just like they can with online
banking” (UK Government 2017).
Since 2016, in Austria, taxable businesses are required to issue receipts via electronic
cash registers to all customers for payments made in cash, by bank cards, credit cards, or
debit cards and also electronic payments (paypal, mobile phone). All payments that are
being made are registered by an electronic recording system in the cash register. This
cash register requirement is mandatory for businesses with a minimum net annual
revenue of 15,000 Euro or if annual cash transactions exceed 7500 Euro. The register
collects data in a data collection log and since April 1, 2017, electronic cash registers
have to have an electronic signature to be protected against any kind of manipulation.
90 D. F. J. Campbell and G. Hanschitz
Every receipt has a signature with a machine-readable code (in the form of a QR code),
which is attributable to a certain data-record in the machine. So, as a consequence, all
incoming payments can be followed by the tax administration.
It is likely that cash register obligations were only a first step in a direction of
business (VAT) and corporate tax administration. The electronic cash register has
been designed as an instrument for verifiability sales; the state has created an
opportunity to examine the taxed turnover of companies with the help of IT systems.
At the moment, the use of the registration system by the state ends with the
verifiability of sales. But there are more possibilities by implementing digital end-
to-end systems in tax regimes.
Digital Disruption
With the possibility of internet connected cash registers, sending information about
turnover and sale volumes directly to the federal tax office, it would also be possible
to deduct tax instantly after a business deal from an online tax account. Corporate tax
obligations could be deducted automatically from a corporate tax account.
In 2012, the Austrian government started to automatically deduct taxes of stock
exchange gains administrated by stock market platforms and banks that have a
mandate and obligation to send volume, buyer, and seller information directly to the
federal tax office (BMF 2017). The gain tax coming from stock exchange business is
directly deducted from the account of the business practitioner who gains capital in the
selling process. The result: full payment of tax obligations and legal security.
In other business activities, the tax prepayment is used to tax corporations
(Casapicola 2016) which means that depending on revenue, managers and owners
are obliged to send monthly or quarterly forecasts and tax payments to the federal tax
office, including all problems concerting business volatility.
By linking the electronic accounting systems of companies (including all cash
registers) with the online accounts that the companies have with the tax administra-
tions, all tax obligations resulting from turnover could be received directly. The
accounting system also includes tax-deductible items like fixed costs, social insur-
ance, or payments to employees in the overall tax evaluation. Like a second bank
account, with incoming and outgoing obligations, the tax-application becomes an
integrated part of the daily accounting business.
Small- and medium-sized companies in particular would benefit from digitiza-
tion, as they frequently do not have in-house tax experts, and furthermore, for self-
employed persons, the implementation of such a digitalized turnover system would
be a huge advantage: a virtual account that bundles all revenue, payments to social
security system and pension funds. Economically, a direct link between turnover and
tax via electronic applications would mean a reduction of current administrative
tasks of companies and self-employed persons, particularly in the calculation of
income taxes for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
An online tax account for the self-employed would also reduce bureaucratic
hurdles of self-employment. The importance of taxes in entrepreneurial decisions
6 Digitalization of Tax: Epistemic Tax Policy 91
were also part of academic studies: “An irrational strong importance of taxes in
an individual’s decision-making behavior is one of the most popular assump-
tions about the behavioral effects of taxation” (Hundsdoerfer and Sichtmann
2008). In 2008, a study about the importance of taxes in entrepreneurial deci-
sions showed that “tax aspects are over weighted in entrepreneurial decision-
making” (Hundsdoerfer and Sichtmann 2008). A reduction of administrative
tasks like tax accounting would also influence entrepreneurial decisions in a
positive way.
The Development of Online Tax Accounts and Just-In-Time
Taxation
How far are we away from digital “just-in-time taxation”? Tax administrations
around the world are developing theirs regimes faster than companies may
think.
Finland has created an income register that should be introduced at the end of 2018:
The description of the project by the Finnish Tax Administration was, in May 2017, as
is: “From 1 January 2019, the information contained in the Incomes Register will be
used by the Tax Administration, the Social Insurance Institution (Kela), the Unem-
ployment Insurance Fund and earnings-related pension providers. From 2020, the
register will also be used by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment’s
administrative branch, Statistics Finland, the Education Fund, non-life insurance pro-
viders, unemployment funds and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Information can be submitted to the Incomes Register through software interface, user
interface or, on special grounds, on paper” (Vero.fi 2017).
All Finnish people will get a personal user account for taking care of taxes
and receive updates on a monthly basis. The idea is that companies send “tax
details directly from their accounting software without any manual labour”
(Kotilainen 2015).
As described before, also Estonia (E-Estonia 2017) experiences already an
advanced digital tax administration: “There is a central shared platform for all
government agencies and large banks; data on taxable events is collected from
employers and other third parties; and citizen identification is secure and robust,
enabling the Estonian Tax and Customs Board to provide pre-populated tax returns,
which take just minutes to approve and submit with a digital signature. However,
there is some digital exclusion among older citizens and in remote areas with poor
internet connectivity” (Meall 2017).
Tax digitalization in Brazil: Brazil’s tax transparency already reached a level “that
the ongoing need to file annual indirect or direct tax returns may soon be redundant,
or at the very least turn into simple reconciliation events” (Kielstra 2015). How did
that happen? For tax transparency reasons, Brazil has imposed two main changes in
its tax regime:
92 D. F. J. Campbell and G. Hanschitz
– “First, all billing for goods and services must now take place through one of
several electronic processes. Each of these involves, as an early step, communi-
cation of the invoice to the government. Tax authorities must evaluate and
approve the information on it before the transaction it covers can proceed.
In effect, the authorities now know of every sale before it is legally completed
and can block ones where they dispute the level of indirect tax” (Kielstra 2015).
– “Second, Brazil now requires companies to use a standardized public digital
bookkeeping system (SPED) with separate subsystems for accounting
and tax. These replace traditional bookkeeping ledgers and, at the end of
each year, companies must submit their complete SPED files – a detailed
record of every single business transaction – to the authorities” (Kielstra
2015).
Brazil’s development attracted attention and so another American state initiated
electronic audits; Mexico’s tax authority is considered to be at the forefront
of “digitizing and automating taxation” by launching electronic audits based on
information filed electronically by taxpayers: “All correspondence will be conducted
electronically through taxpayers’ registered email accounts, and documents
will be made available to taxpayers in an electronic drop-box” (Mingram and
Grosselin 2016).
Just-in-time taxation: “Global taxation is moving to a just-in-time environment.”
(Mingram and Grosselin 2016). And as another Ernst & Young tax digitalization
study shows, Brazil and Mexico are not the only countries digitalizing their tax
regimes (EY Center for Tax Policy. EYG no. YY3818. 2016).
Data Security: The Most Critical Aspect of Tax Digitalization
On-time-tax-data may be one of the most confidential data of individuals, cor-
porations, and organizations that Governments will (may) have in near future.
Data leaks then could easily be used by hackers, industrial espionage, and stock
exchange speculation. Therefore, consulting companies around the world
develop big data solutions that provide the security needed for public just-in-
time applications.
In February 2017, the consulting corporation McKinsey & Company (2017)
exhibited a possible solution for the risk of unauthorized access and data manip-
ulation by “using blockchain to improve data management in the public sector”
(see Box 1). In their model, “each person or organization would have all relevant
data stored in a dedicated ledger within an encrypted blockchain database”
(Cheng et al. 2017). Government tax enforcement via blockchain technology is
even one of the top-rated blockchain application scenarios that the consulting
company Ernst & Young reported in 2016 for the next years. The main reason for
this assessment is the level of security that blockchain provides.

Ernst & Young explains the security of blockchain because of their nature being
“distributed databases containing records of every transaction ever made among
participants in a given network, encrypted into time-stamped blocks via a cryptographic
hash function. Each block’s hash result is a unique identifier and is incorporated into the
next block for integrity verification. Blockchains further protect data integrity by
distributing a full copy of the database to each participant; revisions must be agreed
to by a majority of participants. Blockchain’s hash function plus its majority consensus
approach add up to a powerful new approach to information security” (Flynn 2016).
Another consulting company providing blockchain security models for gov-
ernments and public administrations is IBM. On January 11, 2017, IBM Watson
Health announced a collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to study the “Use of Blockchain Technology for Secure Exchange
of Healthcare Data” (IBM Watson Health 2017). And on July 29, 2017, the
Chinese electronic taxation enterprise “Miaocai Network” announced on its
official website that it develops a “tax electronic invoice system and social
tax-collecting service” for China: “The Chinese government will utilize
blockchain technology for social taxation and electronic invoice issuance mat-
ters” (Du 2017). From an analytical standpoint, it appears likely that blockchain
technology will be the enabler or potential enabler of public just-in-time appli-
cations worldwide.
Outlook
Cyber-development and digitalization will lead to just-in-time services of public
administrations. By implementing online services, the tax administration will lose
complexity and new digital applications will make it easier to handle tax accounts
and to raise tax-income without raising taxes. As different countries digitalize their
tax regimes, one of the biggest issues is data security. With the implementation of
blockchain technology in public administration services, it appears likely (or at least
possible) that one of the biggest hurdles for implementing just-in-time tax adminis-
tration can be solved in the near (or next) future.
In the following, the analysis on the digitalization of tax and taxes should be
complemented by referring finally to the following issues and challenges. This opens
up perspectives for further discussion opportunities:

1. Online tax accounts for employment-based and self-employment-based
incomes of individuals (individual income tax returns): The creation of online
tax accounts by (and for) individuals (self-employed or also employed in a
standard setting) implies that tax authorities know about these incomes and that
because of this, this is a declared income and by definition no “black money.”
Based on the flows through these online tax accounts, tax authorities either
automatically could create taxes or report possible taxes but should also inform
the individuals (or tax payers) about options of tax deductions (for now or later).
Tax authorities also could automatically repay a possible overpay in tax. The
advantage here is that individuals do not have to consult expensive tax consul-
tants and do not have the risk to have “unreported income.” Taxation (and
reporting) of self-employed income then would also not be more complicated
than the taxation of employment-based income.
2. Online tax accounts in support of small businesses: Should companies (here
particularly the small- and medium-sized enterprises) create such online tax
accounts, for example, for their employees, this also may imply that administra-
tive work is taken from these enterprises, because the public tax administrations
are then in a position to provide such services. The risk of failure in reporting then
also would be with state (the public) and not with the (private) enterprises.
3. Online tax accounts to be taught about at schools: The installment and use of
such online tax accounts (by and for individuals, but also for companies) could be
part of the public school curriculum, meaning that pupils (as future mature
citizens) are receiving here information and training of practical relevance for
their lives.
4. Companies should pay taxes based on “where” the revenues are being (have
been) created: One current problem in tax systems is the different taxation
treatment of individuals in comparison with the tax options of the bigger com-
panies (corporations). Individuals must pay taxes on the basis of their actual
residence and/or location of their work place. What matters here is the real
residence and real location of the work place. Corporations can create “tax
headquarters” in selected countries or regions, based on specific tax incentives,
meaning to finally set up headquarters there, where the tax shares are lowest. This
may lead to completely artificial constructions. This also puts tax systems under
comparative pressure and has led to situations of creating complex corporate
structures for the purpose of minimizing the payment of taxes by exactly these
corporations. Therefore, the one crucial argument here is that companies should
pay their taxes there, where the revenues actually have been created. Digital tax
regimes can provide tools for more precisely identifying and locating the “loca-
tion of revenue.”
5. The possible use of tax reporting for developing statistics on the funding and
funding trends of research and innovation: It would be interesting, if public
authorities would use (anonymized) information on taxes and tax revenues for
creating new statistics. For example, information on research-related tax deduc-
tions could serve as an input for estimating aggregated expenditure on research
(R&D) that is being generated by a multitude of companies and the business
6 Digitalization of Tax: Epistemic Tax Policy 95
enterprise sector as a whole. Perhaps also tax-based statistics on innovation
activities would be possible.
6. Epistemic tax policy: The further evolution of tax regimes always is being
challenged by new trends and further developments. As one possibility, uncon-
ventional types of companies may emerge, for example “academic firms” (Camp-
bell and Carayannis 2016a). Furthermore, global tax regimes are also arising. So
how can the taxation of individuals or of companies be made easier that live or
that operate in different countries (more than one country) at the same time?
Therefore, tax regimes and tax policy should also be “epistemically” sensitive, in
the sense that there must be a continuous reflection about the validity and
reliability of the designed and applied tools in taxation: Do they fit reality and
what are options for improvement (Campbell and Carayannis 2016b)? Epistemic
Tax Policy moves here forward in a strategic sense and clearly offers crucial
opportunities.
