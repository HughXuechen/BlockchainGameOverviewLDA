Abstract: Enterprises in low-carbon supply chains have been exploring blockchain technology in
order to make carbon data transparent. However, there is still some opaque information in the
market, such as the value-added service efficiency. How do supply chain members make decisions
between information sharing and blockchain adoption? This study considers blockchain adoption
and information sharing in a low-carbon supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer.
The retailer has private information about value-added services and decides how to share it with the
manufacturer. We examine six combined strategies comprised of blockchain scenarios and informa-
tion sharing formats (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and mandatory sharing). The results indicate
that supply chain members prefer blockchain technology under no sharing and voluntary sharing.
Under mandatory sharing, supply chain members have incentives to participate in blockchain when
the value-added service efficiency exceeds a threshold value. While the manufacturer prefers to
obtain the value-added service information, the retailer decides to share information depending
on the value-added service efficiency. Besides, supply chain members’ attitude toward the sharing
contract also depends on the value-added service efficiency.

1. Introduction
Low carbon has always been a hot topic in supply chain management and low-carbon
operations are essential to the sustainability of supply chains [1]. In recent years, low-
carbon products have become increasingly popular in the market. Consumers with low
carbon preferences are willing to pay higher prices for low carbon products [2,3]. Carbon
Labels are an important identification tool for low-carbon products [4], and consumers
choose low-carbon products through carbon labeling. An information tag represents a
unique digital cryptographic identifier [5]. Hence, carbon labels become a key measure
that can record, calculate, and trace the carbon emissions of products. Still, there is a
greenwashing phenomenon in the market, which will present misleading challenges to
consumers with strong low-carbon preferences in the selection of products. To avoid these
misleading claims, it is necessary to be transparent about carbon emissions.
Blockchain contributes to the transparency of information on carbon emissions and
market demand. A critical challenge to achieving low carbon is the opacity of carbon emis-
sions. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of blockchain in low-carbon
supply chains and discussed some factors that affect blockchain adoption as shown in

Table 1. Blockchain adoption in the low-carbon supply chain mainly focuses on the concep-
tual framework and system design based on the distributed ledger or smart contract [6]. In
practice, blockchain technology has also been applied to carbon emissions. For example, the
“Tianmu fruit bamboo shoots” from China’s Zhejiang province introduce a digital carbon
label, which can trace the carbon footprints of products in the production process. All car-
bon data is recorded and stored in the blockchain [7]. Blockchain technology enhances the
transparency of carbon emissions and strengthens consumer trust in carbon labels, eliminat-
ing “greenwashing” concerns. Furthermore, demand uncertainty also causes considerable
challenges to supply chain operations. Suppliers can obtain more accurate demand signals
when retailers record their sales in the blockchain [8]. Transparency of demand information
benefits the supply chain, which improves operational efficiency. Therefore, it is critical to
research the application of blockchain in the low-carbon supply chain.

This paper value-added service efficiency low-carbon supplychain
Low carbon consumers consider not only the low carbon but also the value-added
service when choosing products. As reported by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and
AliResearch, there is a growing interest in value-added services among consumers [18].
Therefore, some enterprises provide value-added services to attract low-carbon consumers.
In general, cost data associated with value-added services is often considered private
information for retailers [19]. In practice, supply chain members usually possess private
information that is unknown to outsiders, so they are inclined to protect their cost informa-
tion to maximize profits [20]. Asymmetry in value-added service efficiency affects optimal
price decisions and service investments [19,21]. Thus, the question arises as to whether
retailers will share information about value-added services with manufacturers. Most of
the previous research about information sharing only focuses on sharing or no sharing.
Few studies pay attention to the case that demand and value-added service efficiency
are uncertain. Motivated by Jiang et al. [22], we consider three formats of information
sharing about value-added service efficiency (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and manda-
tory sharing). Differently, this study proposes the mandatory sharing contract where the
manufacturer will share the cost of value-added service if the retailer shares value-added
service efficiency with the manufacturer. This paper simultaneously considers double infor-
mation sharing of demand uncertain and value-added service efficiency in the low-carbon
supply chain, which is rarely seen in previous research. Moreover, we examine how the
value-added service efficiency affects blockchain adoption in the low carbon supply chain.

Thus, it raises several questions: (1) What are the supply chain members’ preferences as to
the three sharing formats? (2) What is the difference between the supply chain members’
preferences in blockchain? (3) How does the value-added service efficiency affect supply
chain members’ decision on blockchain adoption?
To solve the above problems, we examine a vertical low-carbon supply chain composed
of a single retailer and a single manufacturer. The supply chain members have the option
of adopting blockchain technology (Scenario B) or not adopting blockchain technology
(Scenario N). The retailer has private value-added service efficiency and market demand.
When the supply chain adopts the blockchain, the manufacturer will produce the low-
carbon products with carbon labels, and store all the carbon data in the blockchain. The
retailer also records the demand information into the blockchain. While the retailer does
not record the value-added service efficiency in the blockchain and determines how to
choose the information sharing formats of value-added service efficiency. Note that the
market demand and value-added service efficiency are both uncertain in this paper. When
the supply chain adopts the blockchain, the manufacturer can obtain the market demand
information. As for the information sharing on value-added service efficiency, this depends
on the retailer’s decision regarding the sharing format.
The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the manufacturer and retailer
are inclined to adopt blockchain technology under no sharing and voluntary sharing.
Interestingly, only when the value-added service efficiency is higher than a threshold
would the manufacturer and retailer benefit from the adoption of blockchain technology
under mandatory sharing. Second, the manufacturer always prefers voluntary information
sharing, which is consistent with practice. The retailer is reluctant to share value-added
service information with the manufacturer when service efficiency is lower than a threshold.
Finally, the manufacturer and retailer have the same attitude towards the sharing contract.
When the value-added service efficiency is lower than a threshold, supply chain members
will choose the sharing contract.
2. Literature Review
Our research mainly relates to the literature on blockchain technology, information
sharing, and value-added services.
Blockchain technology has been widely adopted in an increasing number of supply
chains. The most important applications of blockchain are traceability and information
transparency, which are becoming a fundamental differentiator advantage of market com-
petition. Generally, traceability is defined as the process of tracking and tracing information,
which can be applied to the transparency of the supply chain [23]. Song et al. [24] pointed
out that blockchain contributes to improving the transparency, traceability, and auditability
of materials flow throughout the supply chain. Saberi et al. [25] indicated that blockchain
has the potential to guarantee the reliability, traceability, and authenticity of the information.
Considering the traceability awareness of consumers, Fan et al. [17] studied the optimal
pricing strategies of the supply chain in two scenarios about whether adopt blockchain
technology. Biswas et al. [26] pointed out that blockchain technology can provide high
traceability to resolve the distrust of the product quality. Niu et al. [8] studied the incentive
alignment opportunities of pharmaceutical supply chain members to adopt blockchain
technology through which customers can verify the authenticity of medicines. Based on
the theory of technology-organization-environment, Naef et al. [27] investigated the factors
influencing blockchain adoption and low carbon performance. Furthermore, blockchain
technology also has some other functions introduced by the industry. For example, Choi
and Luo [28] investigated how blockchain can improve the data quality of sustainable
fashion supply chains. Choi [12] proved that adopting blockchain technology may bring
a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. De Gio-
vanni [11] held that blockchain technology can mitigate business risks and transaction
costs, but implementing blockchain is not always economically convenient. Paul et al. [29]
found that blockchain has a significant positive effect on the tea supply chain and can
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2233 4 of 23
effectively contribute to the global tea supply chain industry’s sustainability. Vafadarnikjoo
et al. [30] proposed an action plan framework for identifying barriers to the implementation
of blockchain technology based on the neutrosophic analytic hierarchy process (N-AHP).
Yang et al. [15] explored the values and impacts of blockchain on food supply chains with
platform operations. Liu et al. [31] analyzed the pricing and coordination of the vaccine
supply chain based on blockchain technology and reveal the positive impact of blockchain
on the vaccine supply chain. Woo et al. [32] pointed out that blockchain technology con-
tributes to the carbon credit market in the building sector, and Bao et al. [33] suggested
that blockchain can solve the traceability of carbon emission quotas’ records by Carbon
Emission Trading and Green Certificate. In this paper, our study focuses on the applica-
tion of blockchain technology in the low carbon supply chain. Nevertheless, a significant
difference between their work and ours is that we also study how the value-added ser-
vice efficiency affects supply chain members’ preference for blockchain under different
sharing formats.
Most studies focus on the incentives for uncertain information exchange among supply
chain members. One stream of the literature investigates the demand uncertainty. Shamir
and Shin [34] studied horizontal demand information sharing in trade association settings
between multiple retailers. Yu et al. [35] showed that demand information sharing can
significantly reduce the “wasted emission”. Yu and Cao [36] investigated the incumbent
retailer’s decision on information sharing format considering the manufacturer’s capa-
bility to reduce carbon emissions and demand uncertainty. Nie et al. [37] examined the
information sharing of market demand when a manufacturer produces both new and
remanufactured products. Cohen et al. [38] pointed out that demand uncertainty adversely
affects consumer surpluses in many cases. In an empirical analysis of longitudinal data
on Australian manufacturing, Bakhtiari and Breunig [39] show that new outsourcing and
demand uncertainty has an asymmetric relationship. Some other studies investigate the
cost uncertainty in the supply chain. Typical literature on cost information asymmetry
includes Chen and Li [40], Liu et al. [41], Oh et al. [42], and Mukhopadhyay et al. [43].
Liu et al. [41] studied contract suppliers’ corporate social responsibility cost information
asymmetry of the two-stage supply chain. Chen and Li [40] examined a green building
supply chain considering the manufacturer’s private information about production cost
and unobservable effort. Oh et al. [41] examined how cost uncertainty affects the pricing
decisions of the risk-averse service provider. Considering the uncertainty of value-added
cost, Mukhopadhyay et al. [42] provided one method for eliminating channel conflict.
Besides, there is other literature about information sharing in the supply chain. For ex-
ample, Ghoshal et al. [44] showed that strategic customer data sharing across competitors
may improve both parties’ profitability. The above studies focus mainly on sharing and
non-sharing under uncertain information. Jiang et al. [22] investigated three information
sharing formats (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and mandatory sharing) of demand in a
distribution channel, while the format of mandatory sharing merely pointed out potential
scenarios, and not specific sharing measures. Differently, we examine double asymmetric
information relating to demand and value-added services in the low-carbon supply chain.
Furthermore, this paper proposes a mandatory sharing contract of value-added services
information, which has been addressed in few previous studies.
As consumers’ demand for value-added services increases, a growing number of
academics have begun to examine the impact of value-added services on supply chain
operations. Xie et al. [45] addressed how different contracts affect the decisions and
profitability considering value-added service in a service-oriented manufacturing supply
chain. Zhang et al. [46] investigated the information asymmetry of value-added service
quality from a product life cycle perspective. Dan et al. [47] examined the value-added
service competition, which is affected by three types of warranty service strategies between
a manufacturer and a retailer. Hong et al. [48] studied how value-added service influences
profits and decisions in a closed-loop supply chain. Liu et al. [49] studied the impacts of
conspicuous customers on quick response and value-added service by pricing and strategy
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2233 5 of 23
comparisons in a luxury market. Begen et al. [50] showed that when cooperative advertising
solutions exist, the information sharing of value-added service between the traditional
retailer and the manufacturer will result in a win-win situation, and it will also benefit the
whole supply chain. Liu et al. [18] explored the e-tailer’s decisions on information sharing
when providing value-added service for fresh products. Based on theory and preliminary
testing, scholars Soinio et al. [51] studied how logistics service providers can provide
value-added services to SMEs. Zhang et al. [52] investigated the cooperation strategy of an
online travel platform that offers value-added service under demand uncertainty. Zhang
et al. [53] discussed the influence of the cross-network externality strengths on the optimal
decisions and value-added service of the third-party platform. Unlike previous literature,
we not only investigate the value-added service information uncertainty in the low-carbon
supply chain, but also discuss three information-sharing formats (no sharing, voluntary
sharing, and mandatory sharing) regarding value-added service information. Furthermore,
this study also explores the impact of value-added service uncertainty on the adoption of
blockchain technology.
3. Model Framework
3.1. Model Description
We consider a low-carbon supply chain comprised of a manufacturer (denoted by M),
and a retailer (denoted by R). The manufacturer produces the low-carbon products and
sells them to the retailer at a unit wholesale price w. The retailer provides the value-added
service value level s to the low-carbon products and then sells them to the market at a unit
retail price p, as illustrated in Figure 1. The manufacturer produces low-carbon products
that are attached with carbon labels, which can be used to record and trace the carbon
emissions of products throughout their production process. All the carbon data can be
stored in the blockchain. Consumers with low-carbon preferences select their products
by scanning the carbon labels on their smartphones in a competitive market. When the
supply chain adopts the blockchain, the retailer will record the demand information into the
blockchain. As a result, the manufacturer will obtain the full of market demand information.

This section may be divided into subheadings. It should provide a concise and pre-
cise description of the experimental results, their interpretation, as well as the experi-
mental conclusions that can be drawn. 
3.1. Model Description 
We consider a low-carbon supply chain comprised of a manufacturer (denoted by 
M), and a retailer (denoted by R). The manufacturer produces the low-carbon products 
and sells them to the retailer at a unit wholesale price w . The retailer provides the value-
added service value level s  to the low-carbon products and then sells them to the market 
at a unit retail price p , as illustrated in Figure 1. The manufacturer produces low-carbon 
products that are attached with carbon labels, which can be used to record and trace the 
carbon emissions of products throughout their production process. All the carbon data 
can be stored in the blockchain. Consumers with low-carbon preferences select their prod-
ucts by scanning the carbon labels on their smartphones in a competitive market. When 
the supply chain adopts the blockchain, the retailer will record the demand information 
into the blockchain. As a result, the manufacturer will obtain the full of market demand 
information. 
Table 2 shows the notations in this paper. Let ,i N B= denote the scenarios 
with/without blockchain technology, respectively. Supply chain members decide whether 
to introduce blockchain technology. In scenario N, the supply chain members do not 
adopt blockchain technology in the low carbon supply chain. The manufacturer cannot 
obtain accurate demand information, and carbon data cannot be guaranteed to be authen-
tic. Therefore, low-carbon products will not be well recognized in the market. In scenario 
B, the supply chain members introduce blockchain technology in the low carbon supply 
chain. The manufacturer can obtain accurate demand information due to the retailer re-
cording the demand in the blockchain. Customers can access accurate carbon data by scan-
ning the carbon label of low-carbon products, which increases consumer trust and stimu-
lates market demand. As a result, low-carbon products will have larger market potential.

3.2. Inverse Demand Functions
Motivated by Niu et al. [8], we assume the market potential in scenario N and scenario
B are denoted as 1, α, respectively. α > 1 represents that the market is expanded in
scenario B. Moreover, we assume that the market potential α is large enough, a similar
assumption can be found in Yao et al. [21]. The random variable µ represents market
demand uncertainty, which has a mean of zero and variance σ2. The retailer has accurate
demand information because of familiarity with the market. The inverse demand functions
are as follows:
pN = 1 + s− qN + µ (1)
pB = α + s− qB + µ (2)
Without loss of generality, we set the marginal production cost and blockchain opera-
tions cost as zero. In addition, this study does not consider the sunk costs associated with
adopting blockchain technology. The value-added service cost function is strictly convex
followed by Liu et al. [19] and Yao et al. [21], c(s) = ηs2/2. η represents the value-added
service efficiency, which is uniformly distributed, η ∼ U[η − ε, η + ε]. The average value-
added service efficiency and deviation are η, ε, respectively. The retailer has the private
value-added service efficiency and decides how to share information with the manufacturer.
Motivated by Jiang et al. [22], we consider three sharing formats for value-added service
efficiency: no sharing (denoted by N), voluntary sharing (denoted by S), and mandatory
sharing (denoted by M). Differently, we introduce the contract {η, φ} in the mandatory
sharing. Let j = N, S, M denote three sharing formats. φ is the manufacturer’s proportion
of value-added service costs. Besides, to make the outcomes interesting and avoid trivial
discussion, we assume that (1) 0.6 < φ < 1, which makes our study about the sharing
contract interesting; (2) 4ε2 < 4η2 − η, which denotes deviation is small enough. Similar
assumptions can be found in Ji et al. [54] and Xu et al. [55].
3.3. Profit Functions
We use the superscript iN, iS, and iM (i = N, B) to denote three information dis-
closure strategies of value-added service efficiency in two scenarios, respectively. The
expected profit functions of supply chain members are as follows:
(1) No sharing in scenario N (Model NN)
In Model NN, the retailer decides not to share the value-added service efficiency with
the manufacturer. The manufacturer has to predict the value-added service efficiency and
market demand. Thus, the supply chain members’ expected profits are as follows:

(2) Voluntary sharing in scenario N (Model NS)
In Model NS, the retailer shares the value-added service efficiency with the manufac-
turer voluntarily. The manufacturer only needs to predict the market demand in scenario
N. Hence, the expected profits are as follows:

(3) Mandatory sharing in scenario N (Model NM)
In Model NM, the retailer signs the contract {η, φ} and shares the value-added service
efficiency with the manufacturer. Similar to Model NS, the expected profits are as follows:

(4) No sharing in scenario B (Model BN)
In Model BN, the retailer records the demand in the blockchain, but does not share
value-added service efficiency with the manufacturer. The manufacturer has full knowledge
of market demand in scenario B and only predicts the value-added service efficiency. Hence,
the supply chain members’ expected profits are as follows:

(5) Voluntary sharing in scenario B (Model BS)
In Model BS, the supply chain members adopt blockchain technology and the retailer
shares the value-added service efficiency voluntarily. The manufacturer has accurate
demand and value-added service efficiency. Therefore, the expected profits are as follows:
Max

(6) Mandatory sharing in scenario B (Model BM)
In Model BM, the retailer signs the contract {η, φ} and records the demand in the
blockchain. Similar to Model BS, the manufacturer does not need to predict information.
The expected profits are as follows:

The sequence of events is shown in Figure 2. In stage 1, supply chain members decide
whether to adopt blockchain technology. In stage 2, the retailer decides how to share
value-added service information with the manufacturer. There are three formats how to
share value-added service information with the manufacturer. After the retailer chooses
among the three formats of value-added service efficiency, in stage 3, the manufacturer
determines the wholesale price. In stage 4, the retailer decides the retail price and value-
added service level based on the wholesale price simultaneously. Finally, the market
demand will be realized.

4.1. The Decision of Blockchain Adoption
In this subsection, we first compare three sharing formats with/without blockchain,
and then investigate the optimal strategy for blockchain adoption.
Proposition 1. The optimal wholesale prices and order quantities in scenario B are higher than
those in scenario N (i.e., E[wBj] > E[wNj], E[qBj] > E[qNj], j = N, S, M).
This reflects the intuition that blockchain adoption attracts consumers with low-carbon
preferences, improves their green trust, and expands the market demand. Thus, the demand
for low-carbon products increases in scenario B, and the manufacturer’s pricing powers
are enhanced no matter how the retailer shares the value-added service efficiency with the
manufacturer. As a result, the retailer’s purchase costs increase as wholesale prices rise,
while the benefit from expanded demand offsets these costs.
Based on the above analysis, the market demand for low-carbon products increases
with the application of blockchain technology. The retailer is willing to order more quanti-
ties to increase their sales profits. Therefore, the equilibrium order quantities in scenario B
are higher than in scenario N.
Proposition 2. For Model iS and Model iN (i = N, B), the manufacturer and retailer always
prefer the adoption of blockchain technology.
We examine the supply chain members’ preferences on blockchain technology in Model
iS and Model iN (i = N, B). Both the retailer and the manufacturer prefer blockchain
technology to trace emissions and enhance competitiveness in the low-carbon consumer
market. Define the optimal choice strategy T∗ ∈ {M + R(N/S), R(N/S), R(N), R(S)}. R(S)
denotes that the retailer benefits from blockchain under voluntary sharing. R(N) denotes
that the retailer prefers blockchain technology under no sharing. R(N/S) denotes that the
retailer prefers blockchain technology under the above two sharing formats. M + R(N/S)
denotes that supply chain members prefer to adopt blockchain technology under the above
two sharing formats. The supply chain members’ participating decision on blockchain
technology is shown in Figure 3. The supply chain will adopt blockchain technology in the
strategy M + R(N/S).

denotes that the retailer prefers blockchain technology under no sharing. ( )R N S  de-
notes that the retailer prefers blockchain technology under the above two sharing formats.
( )M R N S+ denotes that supply chain members prefer to adopt blockchain technology 
under the above two sharing formats. The supply chain members’ participating decision 
on blockchain technology is shown in Figure 3. The supply chain will adopt blockchain 
technology in the strategy ( )M R N S+ . 
According to the assumptions in Section 3, the market potential α  is large enough 
under the adoption of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the manufacturer can obtain 
accurate market demand information through the blockchain. Thus, there is no doubt that 
the manufacturer is inclined to adopt the blockchain technology under Model iS  and 
Model ( , )iN i N B= . Why does the retailer also prefer blockchain technology? In order to 
explain the underlying reasons more clearly, we characterize the retailer’s profit differ-
ence in Model iS  as follows:

Since the market potential α  is large enough, the retailer’s retailing profit gain can 
offset the information value loss and value-added service cost gain. In other words, alt-
hough the retailer loses the demand information value and the value-added service cost 
increases, the retailer’s retailing profit increases. The Model iN  is similar to Model iS . 
Therefore, the retailer is willing to participate in the blockchain technology under no shar-
ing and voluntary sharing.

Similar to the Proposition 2, we characterize the manufacturer’s profit difference as 
follows:

According to the assumptions in Section 3, the market potential α is large enough
under the adoption of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the manufacturer can obtain
accurate market demand information through the blockchain. Thus, there is no doubt
that the manufacturer is inclined to adopt the blockchain technology under Model iS and
Model iN (i = N, B). Why does the retailer also prefer blockchain technology? In order to
explain the underlying reasons more clearly, we characterize the retailer’s profit difference
in Model iS as follows:

Since the market potential α is large enough, the retailer’s retailing profit gain can offset
the information value loss and value-added service cost gain. In other words, although
the retailer loses the demand information value and the value-added service cost increases,
the retailer’s retailing profit increases. The Model iN is similar to Model iS. Therefore,
the retailer is willing to participate in the blockchain technology under no sharing and
voluntary sharing.
Proposition 3. When mandatory sharing exists, the manufacturer’s participating decision depends
on the value-added service efficiency.
(i) When η > (α−1)(2φ−1)
(1−φ)2(α2+σ2−1)

(ii) When η < (α−1)(2φ−1)
(1−φ)2(α2+σ2−1)

follows:

As shown in Figure 4, the wholesaling profit gain and value-added service cost gain
both are decreasing in η. The information value gain is positive and independent of
η. The manufacturer’s profit difference is first negative and then positive. In general,
the manufacturer should prefer blockchain for obtaining accurate demand information.
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2233 11 of 23
However, the manufacturer should consider the share of value-added service cost in
Model iM (i = N, B). When the value-added service efficiency is lower than a threshold
value, the manufacturer’s value-added service cost gain is higher than the total wholesale
profit gain and information value gain. Therefore, the manufacturer is unwilling to adopt
blockchain technology. When the value-added service efficiency exceeds a threshold value,
the manufacturer can obtain the information value gain, and the wholesaling profit gain
can offset the value-added service cost gain. As a result, only when η exceeds the threshold
value will the manufacturer be more inclined to adopt blockchain technology.

The manufacturer’s profit difference is first negative and then positive. In general, the

Since the market potential α is large enough, retailer’s value-added service cost gain is
higher than its retailing profit gain when value-added service efficiency is lower than the
threshold value (see Figure 5 for illustration). The information value gain is negative and
independent of value-added service efficiency. Therefore, the retailer has few incentives to
participate in blockchain technology. When η exceeds the threshold value, the retailer’s
retailing profit gain is higher than the value-added service cost gain. At this time, the
retailer’s profit in scenario B is higher than in scenario N. Hence, the retailer prefers
blockchain technology only when η is higher than the threshold value.

ative and independent of value-added service efficiency. Therefore, the retailer has few 
incentives to participate in blockchain technology. When η  exceeds the threshold value, 
the retailer’s retailing profit gain is higher than the value-added service cost gain. At this 
time, the retailer’s profit in scenario B is higher than in scenario N. Hence, the retailer 
prefers blockchain technology only when η  is higher than the threshold value.

Based on proposition 3 and proposition 4, it is easy to know that the supply chain

Proposition 5. By comparing the wholesale prices and order quantities under two sharing formats 
in scenario B and scenario N, we find 
(i) The wholesale prices are higher under no sharing if 1η η>  (i.e., we have ] ][ [BN BSE w E w>
, ] ][ [NN NSE w E w>  given 1η η> ). Otherwise, wholesale prices are lower if 1η η<  (i.e., 
we have ] ][ [BN BSE w E w< , ] ][ [NN NSE w E w<  given 1η η< ). 
(ii) The order quantities are lower under no sharing if 1η η>  (i.e., we have
[ ] [ ],  [ ] [ ]BN BS NN NSE E E Eq q q q< < , given 1η η> ). Otherwise, order quantities are higher 
if 1η η<  (i.e., we have [ ] [ ],  [ ] [ ]BN BS NN NSE E E Eq q q q> > , given 1η η< ). 
The value-added service efficiency is inversely proportional to the value-added ser-
vice level. Retailer adds more value-added service values to the low-carbon products 
when η  is lower. Regarding no sharing, the manufacturer will have full knowledge of 
Figure 5. Impact of η on the retailer in Model iM (i = N, B). (α = 2.2, σ = 0.2, φ = 0.68).
Corollary 1. In Model iM (i = N, B), the supply chain members will participate in blockchain
technology only when η > (α−1)(2φ−1)
(1−φ)2(α2−3σ2−1)
.
Based on Proposition 3 and Proposition 4, it is easy to know that the supply chain
members will adopt the blockchain technology only if η is higher than the threshold value.
4.2. The Value of Value-Added Service Sharing
Then, we analyze the sharing value of value-added service efficiency between volun-
tary sharing and no sharing. For ease of simplified calculation and exposition, we define
η1 = 2ε
ln
(
η+ε
η−ε
) .
Proposition 5. By comparing the wholesale prices and order quantities under two sharing formats
in scenario B and scenario N, we find
(i) The wholesale prices are higher under no sharing if η > η1 (i.e., we have E[wBN ] > E[wBS],
E[wNN ] > E[wNS] given η > η1). Otherwise, wholesale prices are lower if η < η1 (i.e., we
have E[wBN ] < E[wBS], E[wNN ] < E[wNS] given η < η1).
(ii) The order quantities are lower under no sharing if η > η1 (i.e., we have E[qBN ] <
E[qBS], E[qNN ] < E[qNS], given η > η1). Otherwise, order quantities are higher if
η < η1 (i.e., we have E[qBN ] > E[qBS], E[qNN ] > E[qNS], given η < η1).
The value-added service efficiency is inversely proportional to the value-added service
level. Retailer adds more value-added service values to the low-carbon products when η is
lower. Regarding no sharing, the manufacturer will have full knowledge of the retailer’s
value-added cost information under voluntary sharing. As a result, there is a incentive for
the manufacturer to enhance wholesale prices in order to capture more profit from value-
added service values under voluntary sharing. Therefore, the wholesale prices are higher
under voluntary sharing when (see Figure 6 for illustration). As wholesale prices rise, the
retailer reduces its order quantity under voluntary sharing (i.e.,E[qiS] < E[qiN ], i = B,N).
Interestingly, when η exceeds the threshold value, wholesale prices decrease under vol-
untary sharing. The reason is that retailer adds fewer value-added service values to the
low-carbon products. After obtaining accurate information about value-added service
efficiency, the manufacturer has incentives to reduce the wholesale prices for stimulating
the order quantities under voluntary sharing.

the retailer’s value-added cost information under voluntary sharing. As a result, there is 
a incentive for the manufacturer to enhance wholesale prices in order to capture more 
profit from value-added service values under voluntary sharing. Therefore, the wholesale 
prices are higher under voluntary sharing when 1η η<  (see Figure 6 for illustration). As 
wholesale prices rise, the retailer reduces its order quantity under voluntary sharing (i.e.,
[ ] [ ],  ,iS iNE E i B Nq q< = ). Interestingly, when η  exceeds the threshold value, wholesale 
prices decrease under voluntary sharing. The reason is that retailer adds fewer value-
added service values to the low-carbon products. After obtaining accurate information 
about value-added service efficiency, the manufacturer has incentives to reduce the 
wholesale prices for stimulating the order quantities under voluntary sharing.

Lemma 1 shows that the order quantities in Model iS  and Model ( , )iN i N B=  are 
both decreasing in η . When the value-added service efficiency increases, the retailer will 
reduce the value-added service values, and as a result, the market demand decreases. 
Thus, the retailer will weaken the incentive to order more products from the manufac-
turer, order quantities decrease correspondingly. 
Proposition 6. The manufacturer always prefers to obtain value-added service efficiency to max-
imize its profits with/without blockchain in two scenarios. 
Intuitively, the manufacturer would be inclined to gain full knowledge of the re-
tailer’s value-added services, thereby strengthening its pricing power. As a result, manu-
facturer prefers voluntary sharing to make better decisions about the wholesale price. 
Proposition 7. For Model iS  and Model ( , )iN i N B= , the retailer is inclined to no sharing if 
1η η<  (i.e., [ ] [ ],  [ ] [ ]BN BS NN NS
R R R RE E E Eπ π π π> > ). Otherwise, retailer tends to share information 
if 1η η>  (i.e., [ ] [ ],  [ ] [ ]BN BS NN NS
R R R RE E E Eπ π π π< < ). 
As shown in Figure 7, the retailer’s profit differences both decrease as value-added 
service efficiency increases. When value-added service efficiency is lower than the thresh-
old value, the retailer adds more value-added service values to the low-carbon products. 
At this stage, the retailer is inclined to preserve the value-added service information to 
maximize its profit. According to proposition 5 above, the wholesale prices are lower and 
the order quantities are higher under no sharing. Therefore, the retailer tends to protect

Lemma 1. ∂(E[qiN ])
∂η < 0 and ∂(E[qiS ])
∂η < 0, i = B, N.
Lemma 1 shows that the order quantities in Model iS and Model iN (i = N, B) are
both decreasing in η. When the value-added service efficiency increases, the retailer will
reduce the value-added service values, and as a result, the market demand decreases. Thus,
the retailer will weaken the incentive to order more products from the manufacturer, order
quantities decrease correspondingly.
Proposition 6. The manufacturer always prefers to obtain value-added service efficiency to maxi-
mize its profits with/without blockchain in two scenarios.
Intuitively, the manufacturer would be inclined to gain full knowledge of the retailer’s
value-added services, thereby strengthening its pricing power. As a result, manufacturer
prefers voluntary sharing to make better decisions about the wholesale price.
Proposition 7. For Model iS and Model iN (i = N, B), the retailer is inclined to no sharing
if η < η1 (i.e., E[πBN
R ] > E[πBS
R ], E[πNN
R ] > E[πNS
R ]). Otherwise, retailer tends to share
information if η > η1 (i.e., E[πBN
R ] < E[πBS
R ], E[πNN
R ] < E[πNS
R ]).
As shown in Figure 7, the retailer’s profit differences both decrease as value-added
service efficiency increases. When value-added service efficiency is lower than the threshold
value, the retailer adds more value-added service values to the low-carbon products.
At this stage, the retailer is inclined to preserve the value-added service information to
maximize its profit. According to Proposition 5 above, the wholesale prices are lower and
the order quantities are higher under no sharing. Therefore, the retailer tends to protect
its private information to obtain higher profits. When value-added service efficiency η
exceeds the threshold value, the retailer adds fewer value-added service values to the
low-carbon products. The retailer’s profit under voluntary sharing is higher than no
sharing. The wholesale prices are higher and the order quantities are lower under voluntary
sharing. Hence, retailer prefers voluntary sharing to achieve a win-win situation with the
manufacturer when η exceeds the threshold value.

exceeds the threshold value, the retailer adds fewer value-added service values to the low-
carbon products. The retailer’s profit under voluntary sharing is higher than no sharing. 
The wholesale prices are higher and the order quantities are lower under voluntary shar-
ing. Hence, retailer prefers voluntary sharing to achieve a win-win situation with the man-

In this subsection, we compare the sharing strategies of value-added service effi-

(ii) Comparing the order quantities, we can get ] ],  ] ][ [ [ [BS BM NS NME q E q E q E q> > . 
As shown in Figure 8, the wholesale price difference increases as η  increases, but 
the difference is always negative. It means that the wholesale prices in Model 
( , )iM i N B= are higher than those in Model iS . Conversely, the order quantities are 
higher in Model iS . This is mainly because when the retailer signs the contract { ,η φ }, the 
manufacturer will share the value-added service cost. Thus, the manufacturer has the in-
centives to raise the wholesale prices in Model iM . Correspondingly, the retailer deter-
mines the order quantities and retail prices based on the wholesale prices. The order quan-
tity difference is decreasing in η , while the difference is always positive. The improve-
ment of wholesale prices will result in a decrease in the number of orders. As a result, the 
order quantities are lower in Model. iM .

Propositions 8 and 9.
Proposition 8. The optimal wholesale prices and retail prices satisfy the following relations:
(i) Comparing the wholesale prices, we can get E[wBS] < E[wBM], E[wNS] < E[wNM].
(ii) Comparing the order quantities, we can get E[qBS] > E[qBM], E[qNS] > E[qNM].
As shown in Figure 8, the wholesale price difference increases as η increases, but the
difference is always negative. It means that the wholesale prices in Model iM (i = N, B)
are higher than those in Model iS. Conversely, the order quantities are higher in Model
iS. This is mainly because when the retailer signs the contract {η, φ}, the manufacturer will
share the value-added service cost. Thus, the manufacturer has the incentives to raise the
wholesale prices in Model iM. Correspondingly, the retailer determines the order quantities
and retail prices based on the wholesale prices. The order quantity difference is decreasing
in η, while the difference is always positive. The improvement of wholesale prices will
result in a decrease in the number of orders. As a result, the order quantities are lower in
Model iM.

Lemma 2 shows that the wholesale prices in Model iS  and Model  ( ,  )iM i N B=
are both decrease in η . When η  increases, it means less value-added service value, so 
the market demand continues to shrink. Therefore, the manufacturer has an incentive to 
lower the wholesale price in order to stimulate orders. Lemma 1 also indicates that the 
wholesale price difference between Model iS  and Model iM  decreases as η  increases. 
Since caring more about value-added service costs, the manufacturer has fewer incentives 
to raise the wholesale price in Model iM .

Proposition 9 states that supply chain members will sign the sharing contract only 
when value-added service efficiency is lower than a threshold value. When η  is lower 
than the threshold value, the retailer adds more service values to the low-carbon products, 
resulting in the value-added service cost being higher. The retailer wants the manufac-
turer to share the value-added service cost, and the manufacturer wishes to benefit from 
the value-added service. Hence, supply chain members are inclined to sign a sharing con-
tract to achieve a win-win situation. However, when value-added service efficiency ex-
ceeds the threshold value, the retailer adds fewer value-added service values to the low-
carbon products. In order to earn the manufacturer’s trust, the retailer is willing to share 
value-added service efficiency voluntarily. The manufacturer also prefers voluntary shar-
ing from the retailers in order to acquire more market information. Similar to the propo-
sition 2, we characterize the difference of retailer’s profit in scenario N as follows:

The retailing profit gain and value-added service cost gain are decreasing in value-

is lower than the threshold value, the value-added service cost gain is higher than retailing
profit gain. Therefore, the retailer prefers the sharing contract and wants the manufacturer
to share the value-added service cost. When value-added service efficiency is higher than
the threshold value, the retailing profit gain is higher than the value-added service cost
gain. As a result, the retailer will choose voluntary sharing. The manufacturer’s decision is
the same as the retailer in scenario N.

Similar to scenario N, the supply chain members’ attitude towards the sharing contract is first sup-

scenarios, the profit difference curves have different threshold values (see Figure 10 for illustra-
tion). Furthermore, supply chain members are more concerned with the scenario with blockchain 
technology. The threshold value in scenario B is smaller than scenario N. Thus, supply chain mem-
bers are more likely to prefer the sharing contract when value-added service efficiency is lower.

Based on Proposition 9, the manufacturer and retailer both prefer the sharing contract
{η, φ} when η is lower than a threshold value. By comparing the two threshold values, it
is easy to know that the supply chain members will sign the sharing contract only when
η < 4φ−φ2−2

5. Conclusions
This paper examines the tradeoffs between three sharing formats of value-added
service efficiency (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and mandatory sharing) and blockchain
adoption in a supply chain composed of a single manufacturer and a single retailer. The
Mathematics 2022, 10, 2233 17 of 23
retailer has private information about demand and value-added service efficiency. Supply
chain members decide whether to adopt blockchain, and the retailer determines how to
share the value-added service efficiency. We examine supply chain members’ preferences
for sharing formats and blockchain adoption. The main findings of this paper are as follows:
First, we examine the equilibrium outcomes in different blockchain scenarios. The
wholesale prices and quantities are higher in scenario B, which indicate that blockchain
technology results in higher procurement cost. From the perspective of sharing formats,
we investigate supply chain members’ preferences for blockchain technology. The results
show that the manufacturer and retailer are inclined to adopt blockchain technology under
no sharing and voluntary sharing. Only when η exceeds a threshold will the manufacturer
and retailer benefit from the adoption of blockchain technology under mandatory sharing.
Second, we analyze the sharing value of value-added service efficiency between
voluntary sharing and no sharing. In contrast with voluntary sharing, wholesale prices
are higher under no sharing when η is higher but quantities are lower. Furthermore,
the quantities are decreasing in value-added service efficiency. The manufacturer always
prefers voluntary sharing, which is consistent with practice. While the retailer is reluctant
to share value-added service efficiency with the manufacturer when η is lower than a
threshold. As for the manufacturer and retailer’s preferences for the sharing contract, the
manufacturer and the retailer have the same attitude toward the sharing contract. When
the value-added service efficiency is lower than a threshold, supply chain members will
choose the sharing contract.
This study provides useful insights to the retailer and manufacturer in the low-carbon
supply chain. In general, the manufacturer prefers to adopt blockchain technology in
low carbon products, but the manufacturer needs to consider additional value-added
service costs under sharing contract. The following are some suggestions in practice: (1)
we suggest that the manufacturer and retailer should adopt blockchain in low-carbon
products under voluntary sharing and no sharing. The manufacturer should try to obtain
the retailer’s value-added service information. (2) When value-added service efficiency
exceeds a threshold value, the retailer should consider sharing the value-added service
efficiency. (3) Under mandatory sharing, we suggest that supply chain members participate
in blockchain when value-added service efficiency exceeds a threshold value and choose
the sharing contract when value-added service efficiency is lower than a threshold value. It
is possible to further enrich this contribution in several directions. First, the manufacturer
is the leader in this paper, but the retailer as the leader is also an interesting direction.
Second, we assume the adoption of blockchain is promising and the market potential is
large enough. If relax these to other ranges or assume that the manufacturer accounts
for less than 60% of value-added service cost, whether the results here apply to other
situations? Furthermore, this study does not take into account the risk aversion in the
low-carbon supply chain. The above issues can be interesting in the future.
