ABSTRACT
The beginning of 2020 is associated with the emergence and spread
of the COVID-19 disease. The characteristics of this virus, such
as high transmission power and lack of definitive treatment have
caused problems in all aspects of organizational economics. Re-
strictions that were imposed to deal with the virus affected the
global economy. Fear of being exposed to the virus, quarantine and
lockdown led to a massive increase in online shopping. However,
people’s concern about the health and authenticity of the products
offered online and their incompatibility with consumer standards
raised concerns about the reliability of the existing e-commerce
models. Fraud, counterfeit products, ethical sourcing and product
safety are some of the concerns that affected online business ac-
ceptance. To address these challenges, we examine the use of a
blockchain-based e-commerce approach to guarantee authenticity
through blockchains trace and trace capabilities. In this approach,
we evaluate the profit gains achieved through addressing consumer
concerns on safety and authenticity. To examine these benefits, we
use a game theory leader-follower approach. We evaluate the prof-
itability of e-commerce in three scenarios, including when non of
seller and e-commerce website use blockchain, only when the seller
uses the blockchain and when both the seller and the e-commerce
websites use blockchain. The evaluation results show that the situa-
tion in which both the seller and the website use blockchain has the
highest profitability for the seller due to the maximum reduction
of customer concerns.

1 INTRODUCTION
Due to the high transmission rate of COVID-19, it has been declared
a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March
2020 [5, 34]. To combat this virus outbreak, different countries have
put in place restrictions including social distancing, quarantining
infected people, closing public places and shops, cancelling meet-
ings and events, and restrictions on travel. These policies caused
social, financial, political, and economic impacts in societies and
the global economy. Direct impacts include significant population
losses due to the disease, and indirect impacts include severe social
and economic crises.
The COVID-19 pandemics have inadvertently affected businesses
and organizations worldwide and disrupted the classical supply
and demand market models. COVID-19 has disrupted all the opera-
tional assumptions of economic models and has shown that these
models are not resistant to such crises [9, 18, 35]. This disorder is
caused by the over-concentration of global supply and production
chain networks and the fragility of the global economy [14]. A high
percentage of people lost their jobs due to the closure of public
places such as restaurants and shops, tourist centers and reduced
industrial production [6, 22]. Due to quarantine and self-isolation,
people’s consumption, demand, and utilization of products declined.
As a result of this decrease, companies’ revenue declined resulting
in the dismissal of some of their workers to make up for lost rev-
enue. The high number of unemployed increased poverty for the
first time since 1998 [2]. Another critical factor that has reduced
the performance of companies during the pandemic is the problems
caused by the supply chain [19, 33]. More than 75% of companies
in the United States say that pandemics have disrupted their supply
chains [36]. These disruptions particularly affected exporting coun-
tries, due to the lack of output for their local firms, and importing
countries, due to the unavailability of raw materials. To respond
to the challenges created by COVID-19, company managers must
consider new strategies for their business.
According to a survey of 3,450 executives in 20 countries, busi-
nesses’ priorities, and running policies in the post-pandemic era

will be different and will require an intelligent combination of
information technology, cost management, cybersecurity, and orga-
nizational agility [3]. The majority of these issues can be resolved
through the use of decentralized E-commerce [13, 20]. Decentral-
ized E-commerce solves not only the problem of supply but also the
problem of demand in enterprises [15, 32]. Using this technology,
companies can procure the raw materials they need online and
compare products online without being exposed to viruses. Addi-
tionally, businesses can offer their products through online stores,
which according to research, can restore 94% of the damage caused
by pandemics [3]. This approach has proven to be a robust business
model in the face of crisis, and organizations are increasingly using
this method to recover their business after a pandemic [36]. On
the other hand, because people’s behavior patterns have changed,
they will turn to e-commerce more than high street shopping in
the coming years.
Emerging technologies such as blockchain [26, 41] can improve
E-commerce services by creating a secure, transparent, and decen-
tralized platform. Blockchain shows great potential to increase trust
and improve the user experience over time[31]. Although various
companies are looking for ways to recover from financial damage
caused by COVID-19, the role of blockchain-enabled E-commerce
has been properly investigated in the literature. In this article, we
propose a model of decentralized E-commerce business in which all
participants connect using a public peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain.
Using blockchain, sellers and buyers can come together securely
without third parties and intermediaries to control and extract
value from a decentralized marketplace. We assess this blockchain-
enabled E-commerce approach with the aim of reducing the impact
of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. Evaluation results
show that this approach can reduce the financial shocks caused by
the demands and supply fluctuations. This is achieved by allowing
businesses to select the products they need by directly checking
suppliers and comparing prices. Using smart contracts reduces the
risk of delays and low side costs. Blockchain properties speed up
business transactions and enhance their overall efficiency by elimi-
nating the need for institutions to refer to centralized institutions.
The rest of this article is structured as follows. Section 2, presents
background information and related works about the economic
crisis during the pandemic, blockchain, and E-commerce roles in
tackling these problems. Section 3 provides our methodology. Sec-
tion 4 discusses the results of the study. Section 5, concludes the
work and provide future research directions.
2 BACKGROUND & RELATEDWORK
Pandemics have devastating effects on the economy. Federal Re-
serve data show that the pandemic has caused the worst drop in
production since 1940 [4]. For this reason, much research has been
done on various aspects of the pandemic effects on the economy
[9, 12, 38], and also in Artificial intelligence, Machine learning,
blockchain, and the Internet of things[27, 44, 46]. This section, pro-
vides a brief overview of the existing research on the economic
issues caused by pandemics and e-commerce and blockchain appli-
cations in this context.
2.1 Negative economic impact of COVID-19
The Pandemic has had many effects on the economy, specifically
small and medium size companies [14, 36]. These effects are in
the form of changing production rates [6], demand rates [29], and
product distribution [16]. This pandemic, especially in the early
days of the outbreak, has set records in the agriculture sector. In
[11], the authors argue that various factors such as declining de-
mand and labor shortages are causing a recession in this sector.
Many European countries depend on the fruit and vegetable in-
dustry, which requires a very high labor force. Labor shortages led
to declining production and financial losses. Quarantine and the
closure of public places have drastically reduced the demand for
food consumed in cafes, restaurants, and even parties.
Another important area that affects economic conditions is the
supply chain. The supply chain is more complex and interdepen-
dent today because of globalization, making them vulnerable to the
pandemic [11, 16]. Around 75% of companies in the USA reported
disruptions in their supply chain. These disruptions impact both
exporting and importing countries [14]. Guan and colleagues [16],
examined the impact of different lockdown scenarios on the supply
chain. Their goal was to identify the most critical aspects of lock-
down, including strictness, duration, and recurrence of lockdowns
and their influence on supply chains. Their research results show
that supply chain losses largely depend on the number of countries
imposing lockdown restrictions and these restrictions duration.
Although all companies are at risk, SMEs are more vulnerabilities
to risks [22]. In [8], the authors assert that to respond to the COVID-
19 crisis, corporate executives must change their business model
and look for new ways to sell. Accordingly, the authors proposed a
framework for SEM in post-pandemic. In their proposedmodel, they
insist on the role of digital transformation in meeting productivity
challenges.
In [23], the authors examine the impact of the economic reces-
sion caused by the pandemic on older people (over 65). This group
of citizens often have financial constraints. Retirees have lower
incomes and pandemic inflation may cause them economic hard-
ship. Also, the pandemic may have devastating impacts on older
workers who have fewer working years left to pay off debt and
rebuild savings. These people may be less able to use technology to
work remotely than young ones, making them more unemployed.
Given the problems mentioned, the authors consider the role of the
government and authorities to be vital for economic recovery.
2.2 E-commerce and COVID-19
E-commerce refers to a business model that allows companies and
individuals to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet.
Today, all the goods and services are available through e-commerce
transactions, including houses, books, music, tickets, financial ser-
vices, etc. The e-commerce process includes more than one party
for data exchange or financial transfers for processing transactions.
It helps businesses gain access to a broader market by providing
cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products
and services [30].
COVID-19 significantly impacted e-commerce increasing its
overall value [1]. This pandemic has changed people’s behavior
patterns and made them rely on e-commerce as part of their daily
106
Blockchain-based E-commerce for COVID-19 ICFNDS 2021, December 15–16, 2021, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
habits. For instance, Walmart grocery e-commerce increased to 74%
[10]. Following this pandemic, it is estimated that its e-commerce
sales will reach $6.5 trillion by 2023 [10].
In the following, we give a brief overview of the research done on
e-commerce during the pandemic. In [40], researchers found that
executives are looking to run an online sale offer a unique platform
to improve customer satisfaction consistently and over time. The
authors of this paper examine a model of the perceived effective-
ness of an e-commerce platform (PEEP) for economic benefits and
sustainable consumption under conditions of pandemic fear. Find-
ings show that companies need to create a PEEP with an effective
mechanism for protecting personal data, online transactions, and
economic proposals to increase customer consumption in times of
pandemic fear. The authors in [30] examine e-commerce readiness
in Indonesian organizations during pandemics. A company’s readi-
ness is measured in an unstable environment, and the pandemic
period is a good time for that. E-commerce readiness is evaluated
based on technological readiness, organizational readiness, and en-
vironmental readiness. According to their assessments, technology
readiness has the most critical impact on the ability of companies to
cope with fluctuations and environmental readiness encourage busi-
nesses to adopt e-commerce. On the other hand, the organization’s
readiness does not affect the readiness of E-commerce.
In related research [7], a case study was conducted on a food
distribution company called Grub Hub. Launched in 2004, the com-
pany has grown by 53% in e-commerce. Pandemic has affected all
aspects of the company, including restaurants, customers, and de-
livery personnel. In a pandemic, managers must meet the needs
of their customers and have a better relationship with the stake-
holders. The company’s success in pandemic management depends
on three factors: timely innovative solutions to meet the commu-
nity’s needs in times of crisis, addressing stakeholders’ concerns
by implementing various policies and supporting employees.
2.3 Blockchain and COVID-19
A blockchain is a general ledger distributed between nodes in a
computer network[43]. All transactions between these nodes are
stored in the general ledger and are available to all nodes with the
aim to verify transactions[21, 43]. Blockchain allows individuals or
organizations to trade in a completely secure way without a third
party. A blockchain collects transactions and data into groups called
blocks. Blocks hold a collection of information. The header block
contains block hash, previous block hash, block version, nonce,
Merkle tree root hash, timestamp, and difficulty target [28]. All
blocks have a previous hash block and are thus connected.
To process transactions in the blockchain, transactions are first
published on a P2P network. Network members check transactions
validity, and if they are valid, they are placed in blocks and published
in the network[45]. Once the block is authenticated, the transaction
is completed, and a new block is added to the general ledger [39].
In recent years, much research has been done on blockchain
as a tool to improve digitalization [37]. Many researchers have
also considered blockchain during the pandemic period, and in
the following, we will give a brief overview of these efforts. In
[28], the authors present a blockchain and AI-based model for
combating COVID-19. This model consists of 4 layers. In its initial
step, the relevant data is collected from laboratories, clinics and
hospitals. Then, this data is securely transferred to the next layer by
blockchain and analyzed by tools offered by the blockchain, such
as an outbreak monitoring, safe day-to-day operations, medical
supply chain, and donation tracking. AI tools can process these
data for outbreak estimation, coronavirus detection, coronavirus
analytics, vaccine/drug development [17]. Finally, Stakeholders can
use the result. The authors advocate that unreliable medical data,
low accuracy, and time-consuming system to detect the COVID-19
virus lead tomore epidemics. Hence, their proposedmodel improves
the problem.
Torki et. al [39] proposed a P2P-mobile application for detect-
ing positive COVID-19 cases. This application uses blockchain-
based platform with blockchain’s inherent features, such as a time-
stamping and decentralization to verify and detect positive cases.
The platform uses four components, including Infection Verifier
Subsystem (IVS), a Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application,
and Mass-Surveillance System, to work. IVS stores the data of
infected people and the places where they are infected in the
blockchain. For protecting the privacy of infected people, regu-
lar expressions are used to find the pattern of infected places by
the patient. The surveillance system is adopted to trace the users in
these places. Another feature that blockchain provides is the ability
to share information securely. This information can be medical
records, files, and data of researchers or companies. Medical infor-
mation is susceptible and should be securely distributed among
insurance companies, pharmacies, and hospitals.
The authors of [24] propose a model based on artificial intelli-
gence (AI) and blockchain to share COVID-19 data securely. The
authors suggest an application based on AI and blockchain, de-
signed for self-testing at a low cost. AI is used to diagnose the
disease, and blockchain is used to collect and share it safely. An-
other important application of blockchain in a pandemic is vaccine
supply chains. In [25], the authors propose an IoT and blockchain-
based vaccine supply chain model. This model, named Go-Win,
uses an IoT monitoring system, such as temperature sensors, to
manage the condition of the vaccine doses during transportation
or when they are stored. Also, blockchain is adopted for supply
chain management, for instance, sharing data, authentication, and
security. The above research is a short part of the applications of
blockchain in combating this pandemic. Still, it also provides its
vast potential to solve this problem and overcome the challenges
resulting from COVID19.
3 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Figure 1, describes a blockchain-based e-commerce. In this design,
companies offer their products online in the form of websites for
the convenience of people under pandemic conditions. We consider
a situation where these companies use a reputable site (such as
Amazon) to launch their products. One of the advantages of using
reputable e-commerce sites is that people trust them more [7]. In
addition, these sites usually sell various products that give cus-
tomers more choice [3]. When a sales company intends to use an
e-commerce site, a contract must be reached between them.We con-
sider a profit-sharing agreement [42] . In this type of contract, the
profit is divided between the seller and the website, but the method

of distribution and allocation of this profit must be determined.
Therefore, a smart contract is created between them, and all the
details of the agreement, including the ID of the parties, the type
of product, the type of contract, and how to allocate percentages
are specified.
According to our model, the e-commerce system is based on
blockchain, and all information is recorded in all stages of prepara-
tion, maintenance, and distribution of products in the blockchain.
When the seller company presents the products to the site, all in-
formation, including product preparation steps, storage conditions,
transfer, which are recorded in the blockchain. The e-commerce
website then issues a valid certificate for the product after verifying
the product information and registering it in the blockchain. In this
way, customers can be informed by examining how products are
prepared, maintained, and distributed.
It is important to note that implementing blockchain is costly
for the e-commerce website vendor. Using game theory, we exam-
ine under what conditions the profit and satisfaction of the seller,
e-commerce website and customers are maximized. This model
represents the seller with S , the e-commerce site with E, and the
customers with C . The preparation price of each product in this
model is equal to u. Sellers sell each product directly (without in-
terfaces) at the cost ofW , but if the site is used because the profit
must be divided between them, we consider the price of each unit
of product P , where P >W > U . We show the customer’s desire to
108
Blockchain-based E-commerce for COVID-19 ICFNDS 2021, December 15–16, 2021, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
buy a product in binary 0 and 1. Since the customer’s willingness
to buy a product is variable, we denote it by the f (x) function.
We consider two factors that cause people to worry in times of
pandemic that affect their willingness to buy. One of these cases
is the contamination of products during production, maintenance,
and distribution, which we represent as c1. The second factor is
people’s concern about the authenticity of these products on the
Internet, which we represented as c2. The value of each of these
worries can be between 0 and 1. To alleviate these concerns, we
considered a situation where blockchain records complete product
information. Customers can ensure products’ safety by reviewing
this information in this situation. We represent this characteris-
tic as V 1. In addition, the e-commerce site issues a certificate to
the seller after receiving the seller’s data and authentication and
registers it in the blockchain. In this case, customers make sure
that product information is not fake, which is represented as V 2.
The blockchain implementation is costly for the vendor company
and the e-commerce site. Therefore, we examine in which case the
sales parties receive the highest profit simultaneously as customer
satisfaction.
We define the expected performance for product sales as follows.
If customers have fewer concerns, they will buy more and be more
satisfied, increasing the efficiency of better and more involved
factors.
E =
∫ 1
((c1+c2)−v1−v2)−p
f (x)dx = 1− ((c1+ c2) −v1−v2) −p (1)
If customers have fewer concerns, they will buy more and be more
satisfied, increasing the efficiency of better and more involved
factors. The total cost of applying the blockchain is 2b(v1 + v2),
equal to bv1 for the seller and bv2 for the e-commerce site. This
cost is for blockchain hashing, mining, and so on.
In this model, we use the full underlay Nash equilibrium method.
This is a dynamic method for analyzing the multilateral competition
of companies, where inverse inference is used. In this way, first,
the leader company makes the best decision, and then the follower
makes the best decision based on the follower’s decision. In this
model, the seller company is the leader, and based on his decision
to use or not to use blockchain, the e-commerce website decides
whether or not to adopt blockchain. We consider the following
three scenarios to evaluate the profit.
S1 =None of the parties to the seller company and the e-commerce
site should use blockchain. Obviously, the profit for the seller and
the site is calculated as follows.
US = (w − u)(1 − (c1 + c2) − p) (2)
Uw = (p −w)(1 − (c1 + c2) − p) (3)
S2 = In this case, only the seller registers the product informa-
tion in the blockchain, including preparation, maintenance, and
distribution. Still, the e-commerce site does not certify the informa-
tion and does not issue a certificate. The status of this certificate is
unknown. The profit from the sale is as follows:
US = (w − u)(1 − ((c1 + c2) −v1) − p) − bv1 (4)
UW = (p −w)(1 − ((c1 + c2) −v1) − p) (5)
In this case, only the seller has used blockchain and pays for the
implementation. Still, because the blockchain-based e-commerce
approach has been used, both the seller and the site benefit from re-
ducing people’s anxiety and increasing their willingness to buy. This
means that it is not feasible for the seller not to use the blockchain
to record information but for the website to issue a confirmation
certificate. This information is a prerequisite for certification.
S3 = The last scenario is where both the vendor company and
the e-commerce website use blockchain. And their profit will be as
follows.
US = (w − u)(1 − ((c1 + c2) −v1 −v2) − p) − bv1 (6)
UW = (p −w)(1 − ((c1 + c2) −v1 −v2) − p) − bv2 (7)
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this model, we define O ∈ {w,p,v1,v2}, M ∈ {S1, S2, S3}.R =
arдmaxU (X ,M), when R is the best response. Thew,p,v1 and v2
arguments are first calculated to maximizeUs andUw in each sce-
nario. Then, the values ofUS ,UW are calculated using the obtained
values. The seller is the leader, and the e-commerce website is the
follower.
For solving problems under different scenarios, we use the back-
ward decision approach. In this method, the e-commerce website
assumes that the seller has made his decision before, and therefore,
the value ofw is considered a constant number as a predetermined
value. Firstly, we calculate the derivative from the website’s profit
to obtain p based onw . We place the value of p obtained in terms of
w in the seller’s profit equation. In this case, the exact value ofw is
obtained. We place the value ofw obtained in Uw to calculate the
actual value of p. Then, the exact amount of profits is obtained by
placing the values obtained in the seller’s profit equations and the
e-commerce site. We illustrate this process for finding optimized
value in each scenario is the following.
Scenario S1: We use the backward decision method to calculate
the values. In this method, we first, assume that the seller considers
the value ofw . Therefore, assuming the value ofw , we use the local
derivative of the e-commerce website profit equation to calculate p.

Using the p andw values obtained from Equations 9 and 10 and
placing them in Equations 2 and 3, the seller’s profit values and the
e-commerce website one will be as follows.

(12)
Scenario S2: In the second scenario, the values of p and w are
obtained as in the first scenario. Based on Equations 8 and 9 and
their placement in equation 4, we calculate v1. Since the seller
reduces people’s health concerns about products by adopting a
blockchain, we must calculate the derivative of Us to find the v1
value.

By using calculated values of p,w ,andv1 based on Equations 13,
14 and 15 the Us and Uw for scenario S2 are calculated in Equa-
tions 16 and 17.

Scenario S3: In scenario S3, we adopt the backward decision
method just like former scenarios. For this purpose, at first, we
calculate the derivative of Equation 7 for p. According to Equa-
tion 19, we reposition the value of p in Equation 7 and calculate the
derivative to obtain the value of v2.

Then, we obtain the value of w by placing the value of v1 in
Equation 6 and derivative from this equations.

By placing the calculated values from Equations 18 and 19 in Equa-
tion 6 the values of v1 and w can be obtained, that is shown in
Equation 20.
In the last step according to Equations 22 and 23 using this values
we can calculate theUs andUw for scenario S3.
Us =

According to the obtained values, more profit will be received
if both the seller and the website have used blockchain. On the
other hand, the use of blockchain on both sides reduces customers’
concerns about the authenticity and health of the product, mak-
ing customers more satisfied. It should be noted that the use of
blockchain only on the seller side reduces some of the customer
concerns. It is observed that it is in the second degree of profitability,
while scenario S1 is in the lowest stage of profitability.
5 CONCLUSION
In the last two years, COVID-19 caused unprecedented global eco-
nomic crisis. Unlike previous economic problems, this crisis is
caused by pandemic. Although e-commerce can alleviate this eco-
nomic crisis, it should be borne in mind that people’s concerns
about the safety and authenticity of products will reduce their pur-
chases. We, therefore, examined the blockchain-based e-commerce
approach to address these two concerns. Using the complete under-
play Nash equilibrium game theory method, we examine the profit
and satisfaction of customers, the seller company, and the website.
For evaluating our proposal, we considered three scenarios where
none of them use blockchain, only the vendor company uses it,
and when both vendors and the website use it. The results analysis
show that the situation in which both parties use the blockchain,
due to the further reduction of public concern, will bring more
profit to both parties. In future research, we will examine the role
of circular economy in improving the economic challenges posed
by the pandemic for sustainable economic growth.
