Abstract—As data traffic in terrestrial-satellite systems surges,
the integration of power allocation for caching, computing, and
communication (3C) has attracted much research attention. How-
ever, previous works on 3C power allocation in terrestrial-satellite
systems mostly focus on maximizing the overall system through-
put. In this paper, we aim to guarantee both throughput fairness
and data security in terrestrial-satellite systems. Specifically, we
first divide the system implementation into three steps, i.e., data
accumulation, blockchain computing, and wireless transmission.
Then, we model and analyze the delay and power consumption in
each step by proposing several theorems and lemmas regarding 3C
power allocation. Based on the theorems and lemmas, we further
formulate the problem of 3C power allocation as a Nash bargaining
game and construct an optimization model for the game. Last,
we solve the optimization problem using dual decomposition and
obtain the optimal period of the satellite serving the ground stations
as well as the optimal 3C power allocation solution. The opti-
mal solution can provide guidelines for parameter configuration
in terrestrial-satellite systems. The performance of the proposed
terrestrial-satellite architecture is verified by extensive simulations.
Index Terms—Nash bargaining game, fairness, security, 3C,

I. INTRODUCTION
T ERRESTRIAL-SATELLITE systems [1]–[5] enable
seamless coverage for ground users in a wide area [6].
This makes it very promising in the next generation of networks,
especially in the scenarios of Internet of Things (IoT) and
vehicle network, etc. Existing research on the performance of
terrestrial-satellite systems has mostly focused on improving
throughput [7], [8] by relatively fixed allocation of caching,
computing, and communication resources.

However, from the perspective of enhancing user experi-
ence in terrestrial-satellite systems, fairness [9]–[11] and se-
curity [12]–[18] are two critical issues that should not be
overlooked. Especially, 3C (caching, computing [19], [20], and
communication [21]) resource allocation involved in terrestrial-
satellite systems providing fair and secure services is a hot topic
effecting system performance.
Several existing works [9]–[11] have employed Nash bargain-
ing game to provide user throughput fairness in wireless net-
works. Gao et al. consider user fairness based on Nash bargain-
ing in a multiuser resource allocation game [9], where users with
different quality of service (QoS) requirements achieve different
throughput. This can effectively motivate users to cooperate to
obtain a fair and improved network service for all. Ni et al.
provide the joint channel and power allocation optimization
in a wireless network based on Nash bargaining game [10].
Zhang et al. further consider imperfect wireless channel state
information in a Nash bargaining game [11]. Bairagi et al. solve
the issue of coexistence between two wireless systems based on
a Nash bargaining game [22]. Xu et al. employ Nash bargaining
to guarantee user fairness in mobile social networks [23]. These
works focus on the performance of system throughput with
fairness awareness. The impact of 3C resource management on
the system performance is not considered.
In terms of data security in wireless systems, blockchain [12],
[13], [15]–[17], [24] has attracted extensive attentions from
both the academia and the industry. Tschorsch et al. intro-
duce the development history of blockchain [24]. Fu et al.
employ blockchain to guarantee data security in IoT [14].
Although 3C resource allocation and blockchain based data
caching are studied in [14] to guarantee data security, integrated
terrestrial-satellite system is not considered. Yang et al. propose
a trust management mechanism for vehicular networks based
on blockchain [12]. However, the above works focus on the
blockchain based security mechanism, where the impact of
3C resource management on the blockchain based integrated
terrestrial-satellite system is not considered.
Although many existing works have contributed to user fair-
ness and data security in wireless systems, power allocation for
each of the 3C is generally studied separately. However, for
terrestrial-satellite systems, such separate 3C power allocation
may lead to low resource utility decreasing the performance,
considering the long distance between ground stations and
satellites.
Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel
terrestrial-satellite network architecture with fairness and

security awareness, and formulate a joint optimization of satel-
lite serving period and 3C power allocation in this paper. Specif-
ically, we first formulate a terrestrial-satellite model, where low
earth orbit (LEO) satellites will collect traffic data from ground
stations periodically. In this paper, one period of the satellite
serving the ground stations may contain multiple LEO satellite
period around the earth.
Then, we divide the system implementation into three steps:
traffic accumulation, computing, and wireless transmission, cor-
responding to caching, computing, and communication in 3C,
respectively. In the traffic accumulation step, data is collected
and accumulated as one data block. In the computing step, the
ground station will continually calculate the hash value of the
block with a random variable called “nonce”. When the hash
value is smaller than a threshold, the block can be reported to
the LEO satellite in the wireless transmission step and added
to the blockchain. We study the relationship between the delay
in the three steps and the power consumption of 3C. Moreover,
we can formulate the overall system power consumption under a
maximal power constraint. Under the maximal power constraint,
the period of the satellites serving the ground stations and the
3C power consumption will be jointly optimized.
Furthermore, we formulate the Nash bargaining framework
for the considered terrestrial-satellite system. In the proposed
model, Nash bargaining game guarantees fairness in the 3C
power allocation. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness
of the Nash bargaining solution in the formulated game to find
the bargaining solution using dual decomposition.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
� We reveal the relationship between the power consumption
of 3C and the corresponding delay in the terrestrial-satellite
system. We study that how the power allocation of 3C
effects each other, considering fairness and security in the
system. We provide several theorems and lemmas on 3C
power allocation to explore the insights in optimizing the
system performance.
� We propose a novel terrestrial-satellite architecture with
fairness and security awareness. We formulate a Nash
bargaining framework based optimization model for the
considered terrestrial-satellite system.
� We obtain the optimal period of the satellites serving
the ground stations and the optimal 3C power allocation.
The solution provides guidelines for both the engineering
implementation and the theoretical analysis of a fair and
secure terrestrial-satellite system.
It is notably that besides fairness and security in an integrated
terrestrial-satellite system, several other system performance
evaluation criteria [25]–[28] should also be considered such
as placement of controllers and gateways [25], service offload-
ing [28], etc. In this paper, we do not consider these criteria
due to the limited space, which will be considered in our future
work. On the other hand, although the solving methods used in
this work have been used in several existing works, such as the
methods solving bargain game in [10], [11], the optimization
problem considered in this work is totally different with the
existing works.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II presents the system model and the problem formu-
lation. Section III solves the considered model by dual decom-
position. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the
proposed architecture and solution in terms of user fairness and
data security in Section IV. We conclude the paper in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. LEO Satellite Orbit Model
The LEO satellite orbit is shown in Fig. 1. The circular orbit is
assumed in this paper. N ground stations are located at ground,
which are served by the same satellite. Denote the radius of
earth by rE . We assume that the distance between the satellite
and all ground stations is identical and equal to L. Similarly, the
minimal elevation angle V and the geocentric angle α from any
ground station to the satellite are also identical. Then, it can be
shown that α is
α = arccos
(
rE
L+ rE
cosV
)
− V. (1)
In Fig. 1, the satellite can serve the ground station continuously
up to 2α range of the geocentric angle. According to the Kepler’s
second law, the orbital period of the satellite around the earth,
T LEO, is
T LEO = 2π
√
(L+ rE)
3
μ
, (2)
where μ = 398, 601.58 km3/s2 is the Kepler constant. Then,
the available continuous serving time, referred to as the time
window, of the satellite in each orbital period is
T̃ =
2α
2π
T LEO
= 2
(
arccos
(
rE
L+ rE

)
− V
)√

. (3)
In practice, each ground station connects to multiple data
gathering devices. The data gathering devices accumulate traffic
data and send the data to the ground station, which plays the role
of as the data gateway. After data processing, the ground station
transmits the data to its serving satellite in its time window

periodically. In this paper, one serving period of the satellite
can be a multiple of its orbital periods, i.e. T LEO. Moreover, the
satellite can serve at most one of the N ground stations in each
orbital period. On average, each ground station is served in an
orbital period with a certain probability. We will discuss this in
details in Sub-section II-B.
B. Blockchain Model
Blockchain can effectively enhance data security in a network.
The user data can be stored and relayed in the satellite network
to meet the traffic demand across the network. Take IoT data as
one instance: the categories of IoT companies include the raw
material acquisition, manufacturing process, production trans-
portation, and production transactions. The IoT data generated
by each company is gathered by the ground station serving the
company and sent to the corresponding satellite. Thereafter, the
data will be recorded into the blockchain at each satellite to
guarantee the data security [14] in the satellite network.
The structure of the blockchain is shown in Fig. 2. Each block
contains the caching address of the data block, a hash value, a
nonce, and a hash value in the previous block. In practice, the
block data may be stored and relayed in different satellites. The
blockchain contains only the caching address of the data block
instead of the whole data block itself. However, the generation
of the hash value is still based on the data block, the nonce, and
the hash value in the previous block. Note that satellite relay can
be used when a ground station is out of the coverage area of a
LEO satellite. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper,
and we may study this in our future works.
3C in the blockchain is shown in Fig. 3. The ground station
contains data loading cache for accumulating the block data.
The computing servers are employed for blockchain computing,
where the larger capacity of the computing servers can lead to
the lower computing delay. The block is generated by the correct
nonce, based on which the hash value should meet the hash
threshold. Then, the block will be cached in the data transmission
cache for wireless transmission when the satellite serves the
ground station. The cache resource is limited by the wireless
transmission capacity that we will discussed later, the computing
resource is limited by the demand of blockchain computing, and
the wireless transmission power is limited by the LEO satellite
orbit as in Section II-A.

Fig. 4. System steps.
The three system steps can be described as in Fig. 4. For
ground station i, the system steps can consist of the traffic
accumulation with TA
i seconds, blockchain computing with TC
i
seconds, and the wireless transmission with TW
i seconds. In
order to avoid data overflow in the cache, we have TC
i ≤ TA
i
and TW
i ≤ TA
i . Since the wireless transmission must be in
the time window, we have TW
i ≤ T̃ ≤ TA
i , considering that a
transmission service can happen every several orbital periods.
Obviously, the three steps have the same period TA
i .

In terms of caching in the 3C [29]–[34], the data loading
cache is used to store the traffic data at the ground station. The
demanded capacity of caches in the three steps should be the
same as the length of the block for wireless transmission. We
assume that the wireless channel bandwidth of the ground station
is B Hz, where the Gaussian white noise power is σ2 watt (W).
Assume that the wireless channel gain from the ground station
i to the satellite is |hi|2, and the wireless transmission power
of the ground station is PW
i . Then, the transmission rate of the
ground station i, Ri, is
Ri = B log2
(
1 +
PW
i |hi|2
σ2
)
, (4)
and the length of the block sent in the transmission time TW
i
is RiT
W
i . The implementation of data processing is continuous
and circulatory. After the data is accumulated to RiT
W
i bits in
the data loading cache, the data will be cached in the computing
server for generating the block. Finally, the block will be cached
in the data transmission cache for wireless transmission as in
Fig. 3.
In practice, the amount of cache in usage can be configured
based on the maximal length of the data block. We denote the
power consumption of caching by PS W/bit, and the maximal
average power consumption at each ground station by Pmax. We
know that the maximal continuous wireless serving time of the
ground stations is T̃ . Then, the size of the required cache is
the same in the three steps in Fig. 4. We introduce Lemma 1 to
derive the length of cache.
Lemma 1: The maximal length of cache per step configured
at the i-th ground station is
Ki = T̃B log2
(
1 +
PmaxT
LEO|hi|2
T̃ σ2
)
.
Proof: With the maximal average powerPmax during TA
i , the
maximal length of the cache per step in Fig. 4 can be determined
by the case of maximizing the average user throughput:
Ri =
BTW
i
TA
i
log2
(
1 +
PmaxT
A
i |hi|2
TW
i σ2
)
,
where T LEO ≤ TA
i and TW
i ≤ T̃ . Next, we optimize TA
i and
TW
i to obtain the upper bound of Ri. It can be proved that Ri
is monotonously decreasing with TA
i , and thus we have TA
i =
T LEO for maximizing Ri. Likewise, we can further prove that
Ri is monotonously increasing with TW
i , then, we can have
TW
i = T̃ for maximizing Ri. Therefore, the length of the cache
per step configured at the i-th ground station is
Ki = T̃B log2
(
1 +
PmaxT
LEO|hi|2
T̃ σ2
)
.
In the above equation, PmaxT
LEO is the total energy consump-
tion in one orbital period, and thus PmaxT
LEO/T̃ is the upper
bound of power consumption for wireless transmission in T̃ .
This equation indicates the upper bound of cache in each step,
because that Pmax is used for caching, computing, as well as
communication, other than only for caching. �
Based on Lemma 1, the overall power consumption of the
cache in the ground station i is
P
S
i = 3PSKi = 3PS T̃B log2
(
1 +
PmaxT
LEO|hi|2
T̃ σ2
)
. (5)
In practice, P
S
i is the upper bound of the caching power con-
sumption. In this paper, the cache with capacity 3Ki is config-
ured to rapidly caching the traffic data as an simplification in
the system model. This approximation is based on the low cost
of cache resource in practice. The caching power consumption
based on the real-time cached data size and queuing theory will
be studied in our future work.
In terms of computing in the 3C [35]–[37], the computing
delay for generating the correct nonce to report the block is
TC
i . The variable nonce is generally found from a mathematical
problem, and its value can be changed iteratively [12]. When the
hash value of the block and the nonce value is below the pre-
determined hash threshold, the block in the computing server can
be transmitted to the satellite by the ground station. We define the
threshold of the hash value by M0 for each ground station, and
the computing capacity of the i-th ground station by Ci cycles
per second (cps). Obviously, the hash value M for generating and
transmitting the block to the satellite should meetM ≤ M0. This
leads to the fair opportunity of generating the correct nonce with
the same hash algorithm in each ground station. In this paper,
we assume that the average number of iterations to generate
the correct nonce meeting M ≤ M0 is the same in each ground
station and denoted byω. We denote the average number of CPU
cycles in the computing server demanded for solving the hash
function at a time by CH cycles. Then, TC
i meets
TC
i =
ωCH
Ci
. (6)
Considering that TC
i ≤ TA
i , we have
Ci ≥ ωCH
TA
i
. (7)
In terms of communication in the 3C, we focus on the wire-
less transmission of the ground stations in this paper. As in
eq. (4), the transmission rate of the ground station i is Ri in the
transmission time TW
i per period of the transmission TA
i . This
indicates that the average power consumption of the wireless
transmission is
P
W
i =
PW
i TW
i
TA
i
, (8)
where the period of the wireless transmission (i.e., serving
period) should meet
TA
i = niT
LEO, ni ≥ 1, ∀i. (9)
In eq. (9), ni is a positive integer meeting ni ≥ 1. The ground
station may transmit the wireless data once in every multiple
orbital periods of the LEO satellite. Eq. (9) guarantees that the
time of the wireless transmission at the ground station can always
fall into its time window. Besides, by eq. (9), we have
TW
i ≤ min
(
TA
i , T̃
)
= T̃ .

because TA
i = niT
LEO ≥ T LEO > T̃ .
In order to determine the TW
i (0 ≤ TW
i ≤ T̃ ) that maximizes
the wireless transmission throughput, we introduce Lemma 2.
Lemma 2: The optimal TW
i that maximizes Ri is TW
i = T̃ .
Proof: When the energy of the ground stations is fixed, the
transmission power consumption in the time TW
i is PW
i =
E
TW
i
. The corresponding amount of transmitted data can be
expressed by
R
(
PW
i , TW
i
)
= TW
i B log2
(
1 +
E|hi|2
TW
i σ2
)
,
where B is the wireless bandwidth. It can be proved that
R(PW
i , TW
i ) is increasing with TW
i . This suggests that when
TW
i = T̃ , R(PW
i , TW
i ) can be maximized. �
From Lemma 2, we have TW
i = T̃ . This derives that P
W
i =
PW
i
˜T
TA
i
.
Next, we study the average power consumption of the com-
puting server P
C
i . Assume that the power of the computing
server is PC W/cps. Then, the average power consumption of
the computing server is P
C
i =
PCCiT
C
i
TA
i
. To further determine
the variable Ci in P
C
i , we introduce Lemma 3.
Lemma 3: P
C
i = PCwCH
TA
i
, and Ci =
ωCH
TA
i
.
Proof: It can be proved that P
C
i =
PCCiT
C
i
TA
i
= PCwCH
TA
i
. Be-
sides, the computing resource denoted by Ci should be min-
imized to save system cost. According to (7), we have Ci ≥
ωCH
TA
i
, which indicates that Ci =
ωCH
TA
i
is the minimal value
of Ci. �
In eq. (9), we first relax the integer variable ni to a continuous
variable ñi. After the optimization, the real number ñi can be
dealt as the average number of T LEO for the satellite serving
the ground station i. By the maximal average power constraint
at each ground station Pmax, we can obtain the constraint
(10) as
P
S
i + P
C
i + P
W
i = 3KiPS +
PCωCH
ñiT LEO

Besides, considering that the satellite can serve at most one
ground station in each orbital period and ñi ≥ 1, we can obtain
the following constraint:
N∑
i=1
1
ñi
≤ 1. (11)
Since the satellite can serve at most one ground station in each
orbital period, 1/ñi denotes the probability that the satellite
serves for the ground station i in an arbitrary orbital period of the
satellite. By the constraints (10) and (11), the power allocation of
caching, computing, and the communication can be integrated
by the maximal available power Pmax.
C. Nash Bargaining Game Based Terrestrial-Satellite
System Model
In this paper, we formulate the system objective by the
Nash bargaining game model. Let Ω be a closed and
convex subset denoting the set of feasible allocations that
the players can obtain if they cooperate. We denote the utility
function of the i-th player in game by Ui (1 ≤ i ≤ N̂ ). Define
Umin = (Umin
1 , Umin
2 , . . . , Umin
̂N
) as the minimal gains of the
N̂ players. Then, (Ω,Umin) constitutes the N̂ -player Nash
bargaining game. The key issue in Nash bargaining game is to
find a Pareto efficient solution, from which no improvement for
a subset of users can be attained without decreasing the utilities
of other users. [11], [34]. Nash bargaining game has a unique
fair Pareto optimal solution catering for the following axioms
in Definition 1.
Definition 1 ([11]): Define S(Ω,Umin) as the Nash bargain-
ing game solution. Then, the properties of the Nash bargaining
solution (NBS) φ = S(Ω,Umin) are given by the following six
axioms:
1) φ is Pareto optimal.
2) Feasibility, i.e., φ ∈ Ω.
3) φ guarantees the minimal utility Umin.
4) φguarantees the fairness by the independence of irrelevant
alternatives. This indicates that if φ ∈ Ω′ ⊂ Ω, and φ =
S(Ω,Umin), then φ = S(Ω,′ Umin).
5) Independence of liner transformations. For a linear scale
transformation �, �(S(Ω,Umin)) = S(�(Ω), �(Umin)).
6) φ guarantees the symmetry. Define the i-th player pos-
sesses the NBSφi inφ. If the i-th player and the j-th player
have the same minimal utility in Umin, i.e., Umin
i = Umin
j ,
then, φi = φj . This effectively guarantees that all the
players have the same priorities.
Axiom 5) indicates that the NBS is scale invariant. Axiom
6) suggests that the players with the same minimal demand
of utility and the utility function will obtain the same utility.
This guarantees fairness among the players. Hence, by Nash
bargaining game, we can provide the ground stations with fair
service.
Next, we design the system model maximizing Nash bargain-
ing throughput in terrestrial-satellite system. We define ξi =
1/ñi, where ξi can be regarded as the time-sharing factor [11],
i.e., the proportion of time that the ground station i occupies the
time window of the satellite in an arbitrary orbital period. We
also define P̃W
i = ξiP
W
i leading to PW
i =
˜PW
i
ξi
. Then, we can
design the system objective as

where ξ = {ξi}, PW = {P̃W

mal required average throughput of the ground station i.

Eq. (C2) indicates that each orbital period of the satellite can
serve at most one ground station. Since ξi and P̃W
i are nonneg-
ative, we have
ξi ≥ 0, and P̃W
i ≥ 0, ∀i. (C3)
In eq. (C3), the ground station i never transmits to the satellite
if ξi = 0. Then, the system model can be formulated by
max
ξ,PW
Υ, (13a)
s.t. (C1), (C2) and (C3). (13b)
Theorem 1: The problem (13a) is a convex optimization
problem.
Proof: It can be proved that the Hessian matrix of Υ in
eq. (13a) over {ξ, PW } is negative semidefinite. This sug-
gests that the objective in eq. (13a) is concave. Besides, we
can also prove that the constraints (C1), (C2) and (C3) are all
convex. Hence, problem (13a)–(13b) is a convex optimization
problem. �
By Theorem 1, the utility in (13a) is concave and injective.
Besides, all the intersetion of the convex sets in (13a) is also
a convex set. Then, it is proved that the proposed optimization
model in (13a)–(13b) caters for the 6 axioms in Definition 1.
Therefore, the proposed optimization model (13a)–(13b) meets
Nash bargaining game theoretical architecture, and a unique
Nash bargaining solution exists. Furthermore, we can employ
dual decomposition to obtain the optimal solution.

In this section, we solve the optimization problem in (13a)–
(13b) by dual decomposition method. Since the duality gap
between the optimization model in eqs. (13a)–(13b) and its
dual problem is zero, we can just solve the dual problem [11].
We define the Lagrange multiplier vectors X = {Xi} and the
Lagrange multiplier Y . Obviously, the Lagrangian of the func-
tion in eqs. (13a)–(13b) can be formulated by eq. (14) shown at
the bottom of this page. Moreover, in this paper, to solve eq. (14),
we can first solve the inner layer problem in eq. (15) to obtain
the resource allocation policy, and then solve the outer layer
problem in eq. (15) to compute the dual variables iteratively,

Ψ(ξ,PW ,X ,Y) can be optimized by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions. The optimal dual variables X and Y can be
obtained by the ellipsolid and subgradient methods, etc.
We can obtain the optimal P̃W

using the following result.

This proves Theorem 2. �
By Theorem 2, we can obtain the optimal power allocation
P̃W
i . Likewise, by taking the first derivative ofΨ(ξ,PW ,X ,Y)
with respect to ξi, we can obtain the optimal ξi in Theorem 3.
Theorem 3: We define Ç(ξi) = ∂Υ

. Then, Ç(ξi) has its in-
vertible function Ç−1(·) when Ri ≥ Rmin

ξi = Ç−1

Ç(ξi) > 0 and ∂Ç(ξi)

< 0. Hence Ç(ξi) is strictly decreasing
with ξi, and its invertible function Ç−1(·) exists. By the first
derivative of Ψ(ξ,PW ,X ,Y) in eq. (16) with respect to ξi, we
have ξi = Ç−1(Xi
PCwCH
T LEO + Y). �
B. Determine the Dual Variables
By eq. (15), the subgradient of Xi and Y can be represented
by (
Pmax − 3KiPS − PCξiωCH
T LEO
− P̃W
i T̃
T LEO
)
,
and (
1 −
N∑
i=1

)
,
respectively.
Given P̃W
i and ξi based on Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, the
outer layer primal problem in eq. (15) can be solved by the
gradient method. Then, the dual variables can be updated as
follows:
Xi (l + 1) =
(
Xi(l)− �1(l)
(
Pmax − 3KiPS
− PCξiωCH
T LEO
− P̃W
i T̃
T LEO
))+
, ∀i, (19)
Y (l + 1) =
(
Y(l)− �2(l)
(
1 −
N∑
i=1
ξi
))+
, (20)
where �1(l) and �2(l) are the positive step size at the iteration
l. Since the optimal objective (13a) is concave, the iteration can
converge to the global optimal solution with an appropriate step
size [11].
C. The Algorithm Implementation
By Theorem 2, Theorem 3, and eqs. (19)–(20), we can obtain
the global optimal {PW
i } and {ξi} in an iterative manner. We
propose the corresponding algorithm in Algorithm 1, called
adaptive period of transmission (APT) algorithm.
By Algorithm 1, the satellite serving period and 3C power
allocation can be optimized in an integrated process.
The convergence of the subgradient method based Algo-
rithm 1 depends on the specific function, the number of variables,
as well as the selection of step size, etc. In this paper, we can
implement Algorithm 1 because that the number of variables is
relatively small. More details about the computational complex-
ity of subgradient method can be found in [38].
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In the simulation section, we set the noise temperature to be
260 K, and Rmin
i = R0/i, ∀i, where R0 is a constant given in
Table I. We employ the path loss model
L = 92.44 + 20 × log10(L) + 20 × log10(f) dB,
where f is the system operating frequency and f = 2 GHz.
The unit of the distance L is kilometer (km), and the unit of
the frequency is GHz in the path loss model. We assume that
L = 100 km. We consider the fast fading as complex Gaussian
distribution CN (0, 1 dB), and the Shadow model as log-normal

distribution C(0, 8 dB). Unless otherwise specified, in the simu-
lation section, the parameters are set as in Table I. In this paper,
we compare the performance of the APT algorithm with that
of the case ξi =
1
N (∀i), called fixed period of transmission
(FPT) algorithm. FPT algorithm corresponds to the case that
the wireless transmission of the ground stations takes place in
turn. By FPT algorithm, the ground stations occupy the satellite
orbital period with an equal probability. Moreover, we call the
APT with Rmin
i = 0, ∀i, as APTZ algorithm, and the FPT with
Rmin
i = 0, ∀i, as FPTZ algorithm.
To measure the fairness of throughput among the ground
stations, we use the Jains fairness metric formulated as follows.

(21)
In Fig. 5, we focus on the impact of R0 on the system perfor-
mance. In the simulation, when several ground stations cannot
achieve its minimal throughput demand, the algorithm stops, and
the throughput in this sample is zero. We re-run the simulation
in multiple channel realizations and measure the average system
performance in a long time. In Fig. 5(a), as R0 increases, APTZ
outperforms APT, and FPTZ outperforms FPT, respectively.
This is because that increasing R0 reduces the feasible solution
space. As R0 further increases, we find that the throughput of
APT and FPT becomes zero, because a very large R0 leads to
infeasible 3C power allocation. Besides, from Fig. 5(a), we can
observe that the APT based schemes can basically achieve larger
throughput than that of the FPT based schemes. This confirms
the effectiveness of the joint optimization of {PW
i } and {ξi}.
In Fig. 5(b), the fairness among the ground station throughput
is given. As R0 increases, the fairness goes down because the
probability that the ground stations not be served increases.
In Fig. 5(c), we define G = 1
N
∑N
i=1 ñi, and we give G under
different R0. For APT and FPT, As R0 increases, G decreases,
because the largerR0 can increase the probability that the ground
stations not be served in a long time. On the other hand, the
increased R0 leads to more frequent wireless transmission of
the ground stations corresponding to the decreased G. Besides,
G = 10 for the cases of APTZ and FPTZ when R0 = 0, because
N = 10 ground stations are assumed. However, when R0 	= 0,
FPT possess G < 10, because the ground stations may not be
served when the samples of the wireless channel quality is very
poor, where G = 0 in this case.
In Fig. 6, we focus on the impact of Pmax on the system
performance. As in Table I, R0 = 2 × 104 bps for APT and FPT
in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6(a), as Pmax increases, the system throughput
gradually increases. When Pmax is large enough, the constraint
on R0 becomes inactive, where APT is equivalent to APRZ, and
FPT is equivalent to FPRZ. This is because R0 can be achieved
when Pmax is large enough. In Fig. 6(b), we can observe that
the fairness of the ground stations gradually increases with Pmax
as well. This is because that the increased Pmax can provide
the ground stations with better service. In Fig. 6(c), as Pmax
increases, the performance gap of G between APT and APTZ,
as well as the performance gap of G between FPT and FPTZ
gradually narrows. This is because that the increased Pmax can
effectively weaken the impact of R0 on the system performance.
One interesting phenomenon in Fig. 6(c) is that unlike the cases
of APT, FPT, and FPTZ, G of APTZ gradually decreases asPmax
increases. This is because that when Pmax is relatively small, G
should be large enough to decrease the {ξi} for meeting the
power constraint in (C1). As Pmax increases, G in APTZ can
be decreased to increase the corresponding {ξi} for improving
the system objective in eq. (13a). It is worth mentioning that
when Pmax is relatively small, G of APT is smaller than the G of
APTZ because in several samples, the system cannot meet the
constraint of Rmin
i and stops working, where the average value
of G decreases. Likewise, when Pmax is relatively small, G of
FPT is smaller than the G of FPTZ. Besides, we can observe
that in Fig. 6(b), unlike the cases of the throughput and G, the
fairness performance gap between the APT and APTZ, as well as
the gap between the FPT and FPTZ do not apparently decrease.
This is because that the measurement of the fairness between
the ground stations depends on whether R0 = 0 as in eq. (21).

In Fig. 7, we further explore the throughput performance with
the system parameters N, V, and L. In Fig. 7(a), as the number
of ground stations N increases, the throughput monotonously
decreases. This is because that the increased N may activate more
ground stations with poor channel quality under the constraint
on Rmin
i . In Fig. 7(b), the impact of the minimal elevation angle
of the satellite to the ground stations V on the system throughput
performance is studied. As V increases, the throughput perfor-
mance monotonously decreases because a larger V corresponds
to a smaller T̃ . According to Lemma 2, less throughput will be
obtain by the same transmitting power with a the smaller T̃ . In
Fig. 7(c), as the distance between the satellite and the ground
stations L increases, the system throughput will monotonously
decreases due to a larger path loss. Another observation in
Fig. 7(c) is that the throughput performance of APT and FPT
gradually approaches to each other as L increases. The same
phenomenon also exists in the throughput performance of APTZ
and FPTZ. This is because as L increases, the distance between
the satellite and the ground stations dominates the channel gain,
which makes {ξi} equally for the ground stations. This indicates
that the effectiveness of the adaptive adjusting {ξi} gradually
reduces as L increases. The third observation in Fig. 7(c) is that as
L further increases, we find that FPTZ outperforms APT because
by FPTZ, the satellites can serve the ground stations without the
constraints of Rmin
i .
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the joint optimization of satellite
serving period and 3C power allocation in terrestrial-satellite
systems considering user fairness and data security. Based on
Nash bargaining, we improved the throughput of users while
guaranteeing fairness. Besides, we also employed blockchain to
guarantee data security. First, we divided system implementation
into data accumulation, blockchain computing, and wireless
transmission. Then, we revealed the relationship between the
satellite serving period and the 3C power allocation through
several theorems and lemmas. Last, we solved the Nash bargain-
ing game based optimization problem with 3C power constraint
using dual decomposition. Through extensive simulations, we
have demonstrated the proposed optimal satellite serving period
and the optimal 3C power allocation.
