Abstract. In CRYPTO 2011, Sakumoto et al. presented a 3-pass identi-
fication protocol whose security is solely based on the MQ problem. This
identification protocol was extended to a threshold ring signature scheme
by Petzoldt et al. via Fiat-Shamir transformation in AAECC 2013. In
this paper, we present a multivariate based Γ-protocol based on Saku-
moto et al.’s work, and extend it to a threshold ring signature scheme
by applying Γ-transformation (TIFS 2013). Compared with Petzoldt et
al.’s work, our scheme reduces signature length and rounds by 21% and
29% respectively to achieve 80-bit security. What’s more, our scheme has
higher level provable security, enjoys much better performance on power
limited devices, and can be flexible deployed in interactive protocols. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first application of Γ-transformation
in post-quantum cryptography.

1 Introduction
The MQ (short for multivariate quadratic) problem, which is to solve a set of
multivariate quadratic polynomials over a finite field, is a popular topic in post-
quantum cryptography. It has been proved to be a NP-Complete problem [4]
and no known polynomial time quantum algorithm can solve it [8]. However,
the security of most existing multivariate schemes are not only based on MQ
problem but also another problem called Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP for
short) problem [3], whose security is not as strong as initially thought. To put
it simply, the IP problem is to recover affine transformations from the trapdoor
of a multivariate polynomials system.
Related Work. In 2011, Sakumoto et al. [7] presented a 3-pass identification
protocol whose security is solely based on the conjectured intractability of the
MQ problem. Petzoldt et al. [6] extended this protocol to a threshold ring signa-
ture scheme by applying Fiat-Shamir transformation [2]. The signature length of
Petzoldt et al.’s scheme is independent of the number of real signers and linear in
the number of group members, and it’s at least twice shorter than lattice-based
[1] and code-based[5] threshold ring signature schemes, despite more rounds are
needed to achieve the same level security. In 2013, Yao and Zhao [9] proposed

A New Multivariate Based Threshold Ring Signature Scheme 527
a new transformation approach called Γ-transformation. Compared with Fiat-
Shamir transformation, Γ-transformation keeps all its advantages, has higher
level provable security and overcomes several major disadvantages such as inflex-
ible deployment in interactive protocols and public/private storage limitation.
Our Contributions. In this paper, we present a multivariate based Γ-protocol,
and extend it to a threshold ring signature scheme by applying Γ-transformation.
Our (threshold ring) Γ-protocol is a zero knowledge argument of knowledge with
cheating probability 2/3 whose security is solely based on the intractability of
MQ problem, and our threshold ring signature scheme is strongly existential
unforgeable under concurrent interactive attack.
As to efficiency, the signature length of our scheme is independent of the
number of real signers and linear in the number of group members. Compared
with [6], our scheme reduces the cheating probability from 3/4 to 2/3. To
achieve 80(100)-bit security, our scheme has 21(25)% shorter signature and needs
29(33)% less rounds, while the public/private key size are the same.
Our scheme also enjoys the benefits of Γ-transformation over Fiat-Shamir
transformation, such as flexible deployment in interactive protocols, better per-
formance on power limited devices. To the best of our knowledge, our work is
the first application of Γ-transformation in post-quantum cryptography.
2 Multivariate Based Γ-Protocol
MQ Problem. Denote by MQ(n,m, IFq) a set of multivariate quadratic poly-
nomials F (x) = (p1(x), . . . , pm(x)), in which
pl(x) =
∑n
i=1
∑n
j=i p
(l)
i,jxixj +
∑n
i=1 p
(l)
i xi + p
(l)
0
where x = (x1, . . . , xn) and p
(l)
i,j , p
(l)
i , p
(l)
0 ∈ IFq for l = 1, . . . ,m. Given a F ∈
MQ(n,m, IFq), find a vector x = (x1, . . . , xn) such that F (x) = 0 is called the
MQ problem. It has been proved to be NP-Complete [4].
In this section, we extend the 3-pass identification protocol in [7] to a multi-
variate based Γ-protocol (refer to Figure 1). The private input of the Prover is
s ∈R IFn satisfying v = F (s), where F ∈ MQ(n,m, IFq) is a system parameter.
(F, v) serve as the public key.
Theorem 1. The Identification protocol in Figure 1 is a Γ-protocol for MQ
problem under the e-condition that Re(d, e, d
′, e′) = 1 iff d = d′ and e �= e′.
Proof. According to the definition of Γ-protocol [9], we need to show that our
protocol satisfies following properties.
– Completeness. If P, V follow the protocol, the verifier always accepts.
– Perfect SHVZK. With the knowledge of public key v, a random d and an
arbitrary challenge Ch, the PPT simulator S works as follows: it first selects
the response Rsp = (ri, tj , êk) uniformly at random, in which i, j, k ∈ {0, 1}
are determined by Ch, then it picks a random ri⊕1 from IFn uniformly.
a = (c0, c1, c2) can be computed from (d, ri, ri⊕1, tj , êk), and S outputs

will be accepted and s = r0 + r1 is distributed uniformly over IFn.
– Knowledge-extraction w.r.t. e-condition. Given two transcripts (a, d, Ch,Rsp)
and (a, d′, Ch′, Rsp′), where d = d′ and Ch �= Ch′. If either Ch or Ch′ is 0,
r0 and r1 can be derived from Rsp and Rsp′, then we can get s = r0 + r1.
If neither Ch nor Ch′ is 0, t0, t1 and r1 can be derived from Rsp and Rsp′,
then we can get s = r1 + t0 + t1.
Theorem 2. The Identification protocol in Figure 1 is a zero knowledge argu-
ment of knowledge, with a cheating probability of 2/3, if the commitment scheme
Com is statistically hiding and computationally binding.
Proof. The proof can be deduced from Theorem 2 and 3 of [7] directly.
3 Multivariate Based Threshold Ring Γ-Protocol
In a (t, N)-threshold ring identification protocol, at least t out of a larger group
of N members are required to prove that they really know their secret keys. For
the sake of simplicity, we just take the case of exactly t provers as example.
However, not each of the t provers interacts with the verifier directly. In-
stead, a leader is randomly selected before the interaction, he gathers the other
provers’ commitments and computes commitments for non-provers and himself,
then sends the master commitment to the verifier. After receiving challenge from
A New Multivariate Based Threshold Ring Signature Scheme 529
the verifier, the leader sends the challenge to the other t− 1 provers. At last, the
leader computes the master response and sends it to the verifier. Besides check-
ing the correctness of the master response, the verifier also validates whether the
number of real provers is at least t.
To enable the leader to compute commitments for non-provers without know-
ing their real secret keys, we require that the public key for every member in
the group to be 0. By doing so, the leader can take 0 as each non-prover’s secret
key (MQ(0) = 0) when computing commitments for them.
Denote U as the set of N members and P the set of t provers, our protocol
works as follows.
1. Each prover Pi ∈ P chooses r
(i)
0 , t
(i)
0 ∈ IFn, e
(i)
0 ∈ IFm, then sends the com-
mitment values c

2. The leader computes c

3 , c
(i)
4 for the non-provers, chooses a per-
mutation Σ ∈R UN which re-arrange the N members to meet the source
hiding property and d ∈R D, and computes the master commitments C0 =
Com(c

0 , ..., c
(N)
0 ), C1 = Com(Σ, c

C3 = Com(Σ(c
(1)
3 , ..., c
(N)
3 )), C4 = Com(Σ(c
(1)
4 , ..., c
(N)
4 )). Then sends
C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, d to the verifier.
3. The verifier chooses the challenge Ch ∈R {0, 1, 2} and sends it to the leader.
Then the leader sends Ch, d to the other provers.
4. The t− 1 provers send their responses Rspi to the leader respectively.
If Ch = 0, Rspi = (r
(i)
0 , t
(i)
1 , e
(i)
1 ⊕ d)
If Ch = 1, Rspi = (r

(i)
1 ⊕ d)
If Ch = 2, Rspi = (r
(i)
1 , t
(i)
0 , e
(i)
0 ⊕ d)
5. The leader computes Rspi for the non-provers and himself, computes the
master response RSP and sends it to the verifier.
If Ch = 0, RSP = (Σ, Rsp1, . . . , RspN)
If Ch = 1, RSP = (Rsp1, . . . , RspN)
If Ch = 2, RSP = (Σ, Rsp1, . . . , RspN ,Σ(c
(1)
3 , . . . , c
(N)

6. The verifier checks the correctness of the commitments.
If Ch = 0, he parses RSP into Σ, r

4 Multivariate Based Threshold Ring Signature Scheme
In this part, we construct a threshold ring signature scheme by applying Γ-
transformation on our threshold ring Γ-protocol. As our threshold ring Γ-protocol
has a cheating probability of 2/3, we need to run our scheme number of rounds
to guarantee the security, here we denote by #rounds the number of rounds to
be executed, and our scheme works as below.
1. The leader gathers commitments of the other signers and generates commit-
ments for non-signers and himself, then computes the master commitments
COM = (COM (1), . . . , COM (#rounds))
in which COM (i) = (C
(i)
0 , . . . , C
(i)
4 ) for round i.
2. The leader computes d = (f(COM (1)), . . . , f(COM (#rounds)) and the master
challenge CH = h(m)(1)−(#rounds), where f is modelled as random oracle and
h : {0, 1}∗ → {00, 01, 10}(#rounds)) is a hash function, then sends d, CH to
his co-signers. We require that the leader should publish f(d) to the verifier
before receiving the message to be signed. Notice that we use f(d) instead of
d here to reduce the signature length and the verifier checks the correctness
of f(d), not d in the step 5.
3. The leader gathers responses from the other signers and generates responses
for non-signers and himself, then computes the master responses RSP =
(RSP (1), . . . , RSP (#rounds)). For round i,
If CH(i) = 0, RSP (i) =
(
Σ, Rsp1, . . . , RspN , C0, C4
)(i)
.
If CH(i) = 1, RSP (i) =
(
Rsp1, . . . , RspN , C1, C3, C4
)(i)
.
If CH(i) = 2, RSP (i) =
(
Σ, Rsp1, . . . , RspN , Σ(c
(1)
3 , ..., c
(N)
3 ), C2
)(i)
.
4. The leader sends the final signature σ = (f(d)||RSP ) to the verifier (actually
only RSP is sent as f(d) is already sent in Step 2).
5. The verifier parses σ into f(d), RSP (1), . . . , RSP (#rounds), and computes
the master challenge CH . For each round i ∈ {1, . . . ,#rounds}, the ver-
ifier parses RSP (i) to get each user’s response, then computes the master
commitments
C̃OM
(i)
= (C̃
(i)
0 , C̃
(i)
1 , C̃
(i)
2 , C̃
(i)
3 , C̃
(i)
4 ) and d̃(i) = f(C̃OM
(i)
)
At last the verifier checks f(d)
?
= f(d̃(1), . . . , d̃(#rounds)).
According to the property of Γ-transformation, our threshold ring signature
scheme is strongly existential unforgeable under concurrent interactive attack.

5 Security Analysis
In this section, firstly we want to show that our threshold ring Γ-protocol is a
zero knowledge argument of knowledge with cheating probability 2/3, which can
be proved by three properties: Completeness, Soundness and Zero Knowledge.
Then we show that our threshold ring signature scheme is unconditionally source
hiding. The Completeness is straight forward as the verifier will always accept a
correct interaction from the prover.
Theorem 3 (Soundness). An attacker who is able to pass r rounds of our
protocol without detection with probability > (2/3)r, can either break the binding
property of the commitment scheme or extract t vectors si1 , . . . , sit ∈ IFn\{0}
satisfying Fij (sij ) = 0, where i1, . . . , it are t indices from {1, 2, . . . , N}.
Proof. Assume that an attacker is able to pass r rounds of the threshold ring
identification scheme with probability > (2/3)r, he must be able to answer all
three challenges in at least one round correctly. Denote c̃
(i,j)
k as the value of c̃k
the verifier computes for user i and challenge j. Due to the binding property of
the commitment scheme we can get that
c̃
(1,1)
0 = c̃
(1,2)
0 , . . . , c̃
(N,1)
0 = c̃
(N,2)
0 (1a)
Σ(0) = Σ(2), c̃
(1,0)
1 = c̃
(1,2)
1 , . . . , c̃
(N,0)
1 = c̃
(N,2)
1 (1b)
c̃
(1,0)
2 = c̃
(1,1)
2 , . . . , c̃
(N,0)
2 = c̃
(N,1)
2 (1c)
Again due to the binding property of the commitment scheme, (1a),(1b),(1c)
can deduce following equations, ∀i = 1, . . . , N
(r̃
(i,1)
1 ,−Fi(r̃
(i,1)
1 )−Gi(t̃
(i,1)
1 , r̃
(i,1)
1 )− ẽ
(i,1)
1 )) = (r̃
(i,2)

0 )

(r̃
(i,0)
0 − t̃
(i,0)
0 , Fi(r̃
(i,0)
0 )− ẽ
(i,0)
1 ) = (t̃
(i,2)
0 , ẽ
(i,2)
0 ) (2b)
(t̃
(i,0)
1 , ẽ
(i,0)
1 ) = (t̃
(i,1)
1 , ẽ
(i,1)
1 ) (2c)
Then we can get s̃i = r̃
(i,0)
0 + r̃
(i,2)
1 . Otherwise, if any one of (2a),(2b),(2c) doesn’t
hold, the binding property of Com is broken.
Next we show that at least t of the solutions are not 0.
To pass Ch = 2, there must be at least t indices i1, . . . , it satisfying that
c̃
(Σ(2)(ij),2)
3 �= c̃
(Σ(2)(ij),2)
4 . As Σ(0) = Σ(2) =: Σ, there is c̃
(Σ(ij),0)
3 �= c̃
(Σ(ij),2)
4 , ∀j =
1, . . . , t, which is equivalent to r̃
(Σ(ij ),0)
0 �= r̃
(Σ(ij),2)
1 , ∀j = 1, . . . , t.
Till now, the attacker has found t vectors s̃Σ(ij) = r̃
(Σ(ij),0)
0 + r̃
(Σ(ij),2)
1 ∈
IFn\{0} satisfying FΣ(ij)(s̃Σ(ij)) = 0, ∀j = 1, ..., t.

Theorem 4 (Zero-Knowledge). The threshold ring Γ-protocol is statistically
zero knowledge if the commitment scheme Com is statistically hiding.
Proof. Let S be a simulator of the leader who doesn’t know the private keys of
the group, and show that S can pass the scheme with probability 2/3.
S chooses a value Ch∗ ∈R {0, 1, 2} as a prediction, of the challenge value
that the verifier will not choose. For the group of N users, S chooses s̃i ∈R IFn
with at least t of the secret keys s̃i �= 0, and chooses r̃
(i)
0 , t̃
(i)
0 ∈R IFn, ẽ
(i)
0 ∈R

(i)
2 , c̃
(i)
3 , c̃
(i)
4 for each user, then uniformly at random chooses a permutation
Σ and a value d̃ from D to construct the master commitments.
Till now, S finishes Step 1 and Step 2 of the threshold ring identification
protocol, the other steps are remained the same, then waits for the challenge
from the verifier. If Ch∗ �= Ch, the response from S will be accepted.
Theorem 5. The threshold ring signature scheme is unconditionally source hid-
ing.
Proof. For all challenge values 0, 1 and 2, the response of both signers and
non-signers are completely indistinguishable, since r0, t0, e0 are chosen uniformly
at random and therefore the responses are random too. As to the verification
for challenge value 2, actual signers and non-signers are mixed by a random
permutation Σ, the verifier is not able to identify the actual signers although he
knows which users (after permutation) have non-zero secret.
6 Efficiency
Table 1 compares our threshold ring signature scheme with Petzoldt et al.’s
scheme [6], lattice-based [1] and code-based [5] threshold ring signature schemes.
And we use the same parameters as [6] for our scheme, i.e. IF = GF (2), (m,n) =
(80, 80) for 80-bit security and (m,n) = (100, 100) for 100-bit security.

A New Multivariate Based Threshold Ring Signature Scheme 533
Compared with [6], our scheme has 29% reduction in round number and 21%
reduction in signature length for 80-bit security, 33% reduction in round number
and 25% reduction in signature length for 100-bit security. Compared with[1] and
[5], our private key and signature are pretty small, especially compared with [1].
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a Γ-protocol whose security is solely based on MQ
problem, and extend it to a threshold ring signature scheme by applying Γ-
transformation. Our threshold ring signature scheme offers higher level provable
security and better efficiency compared with [6], and enjoys the benefits of Γ-
transformation such as flexible deployment in interactive protocols and better
performance on power limited devices.
