Abstract. Renewable energy cooperatives were found to facilitate the uptake
of renewable and distributed energy resources and require the willingness of
participants to trade energy within their local community. To gather user
requirements for the design of such scenarios, we conducted two focus groups
with potential participants. Prosumers (n = 7) and consumers (n = 9) worry
about regulatory conditions and potential taxes applied on energy trading. We
found that in particular consumers demanded for secure energy supply, while
prosumers wanted to keep control of their energy production. Prosumers
expressed their interest in detailed consumption and sales information, while
consumers were interested in the legal matters of the contract and the energy
source. Furthermore, the concept of connectedness was valued as the most
important gamification approach for self-consumption communities, followed
by the development of competence, in particular important for consumers.

1 Introduction
The combustion of fossil resources accounts for two third of carbon emissions worldwide
[3] and therefore progressively contribute to climate change [4]. In order to face eco-
logical challenges, a changeover from the traditional, centralized power grid to an inte-
gration of renewable and distributed energy resources (DER) is needed [1]. DERs enable
demand response, grid stabilization and reduce the transmission costs. Consequently, the
integration of DERs applies for being more energy-efficient [2]. Different technical
solutions are suggested to realize reliable trading of distributed produced energy, for
instance the use of blockchain technology seems to be promising [6, 7].
Besides the technical design, user research can contribute to a usable implemen-
tation of solutions for locally produced energy and its trading. On a social level,
renewable energy cooperatives were found to facilitate the uptake of DERs [5] in
general. But the question remains: Which requirements need to be fulfilled to
encourage people to participate in a local energy community in short- and long-term?
Therefore, we conducted two focus groups with pro- and consumers.

2 Related Work
2.1 User Research for Smart Grids
The involvement of active con- and prosumers in terms of optimal production and
consumption of energy provides many opportunities for new, smart energy models
facilitating the integration of DERs. The willingness of people to participate is one
main contributor to the adoption [8] and success [11] of these models, as the devel-
opment and transition to energy communities based on renewables in Denmark [16],
Austria [18] and Norway [17] already have shown. Hence, the integration of user
requirements, preferences and barriers is of fundamental importance in the design
process [8, 9]. One of our previous studies [10] showed that pro- and consumer differ in
their acceptance of energy scenarios involving DERs. Especially with regard to a self-
consumption community scenario, consumers criticized the complexity and the
uncertainty of costs, whereas prosumers favored the innovativeness of a Peer-to-Peer
approach.
A field trial in Austria – the HiT Housing Project [18, 19] – showed that users were
disappointed especially about the benefit-cost ratio. Eight residential buildings (129
apartments) were equipped with a heating system consisting of a biogas-based unit, a
heat pump, and an energy storage. Residents perceived their effort to adjust their
behavior as high, but the financial benefit was rather low. With regard to informational
demand, they mentioned an interest in what kind of energy source was used, in order to
adjust their consumption to locally produced solar power [19]. A promising suggestion
for a possible user interface indicating availability of green power was made by
Schrammel et al. [20]. Research shows that the implementation of energy communities,
which are enabled with local production and supply, need the integration of user-
oriented and social approaches to start and continue the transition to DER integration.
2.2 Gamification for Motivating Active Participation
Most concepts, which promote sustainable energy behavior, incorporate people as
individuals motivated by self-interest [11]. As local energy approaches of production
and consumption involve small communities, group-based approaches addressing
motivational aspects of participation are interesting as well. In the field of human-
computer-interaction, there is one motivational design strategy covering a range of
individual and community interests, called gamification. It is defined as “the use of
video game elements, to improve user experience and user engagement” [21]. Gam-
ification uses elements that target the basic pillars of intrinsic human motivation.
Namely autonomy, competency and relatedness. Within our two focus groups, we want
to identify if and what kind of gamification strategy would be suitable for a user
interface in a local energy community. The focus groups aimed at contributing to the
user-centered design of a self-consumption community scenario. Therefore, we
investigated which requirements do pro- and consumers have for a self-consumption
community scenario in terms of energy?

3 Method
We decided to conduct two separate focus groups, one for pro- and one for consumers
as a homogenous group composition is known to facilitate a common basis in the
discussion [12]. A focus group is a qualitative survey instrument [12] and a moderated
process in which a small group of 6 to 9 users [13] is stimulated to discuss a specific
topic [12]. This informal technique helps to assess users’ needs and feelings [13].
3.1 Sample
The consumer focus group was conducted with 9 consumers (4 female), who were on
average 50 years old (M = 50.33; SD = 16.60). The majority (5) indicated to have a
university degree as their highest level of education, followed by a PhD (2). In the
mean (Mdn = 5.00) they lived in a city with “100.000 to 500.000” inhabitants. We had
7 participants in the prosumer focus group (one female) with a mean age of M = 48.00
years (SD = 12.22). Again, the majority held a university degree (6), here followed by
one participant, who indicated an apprenticeship. On average also the prosumers’ place
of residence has “100.000 to 500.000” (Mdn = 5.00) inhabitants. The consumers
“slightly” and prosumers “largely” agreed being affine to technology (Mcon = 4.29;
SDcon = 0.49; Mpro = 4.65; SDpro = 0.73), least lies above the standard value [14].
3.2 Procedure and Materials
The focus group notifications were sent out via email to the participant panel of our
research group. The two groups of interest were described as follows: 1. Prosumers:
“people, who produce electricity themselves, e.g. with a photovoltaic plant”; 2. Con-
sumers: “people, who purchase electricity”. The final invitation included an intro-
duction to the topic and a description of the self-consumption scenario (Annex 1). First
of all, the participants were asked to sign the consent form and a demographic ques-
tionnaire was handed (including age, gender, level of education, size of the city or place
of residence, affinity for technology interaction [14]). Additionally, prosumers were
asked to indicate the age and a description of their energy plant. Participants then
received a briefing on the NEMoGrid research project [15] and the scenario. We then
questioned openly about the potential advantages and disadvantages of the scenario and
the desired information of the pro- and consumers in such a scenario. Keywords from
the participants’ statements were noted and placed on a table. Afterward, participants
rated the importance of the collected information individually (Fig. 1). Therefore, they
had to allocate max. 9 colored dots (red = “I personally do not need this information.”,
yellow = “That’s good to know, but I’m sure I just check it every once in a while.”,
green = “Very important, I always want to have quick access to this information.”).
Subsequently, we focused on the development of gamification concepts. Therefore,
the pro- and consumers should complement three different sentences individually: 1.
“In order to strengthen my competence in dealing with energy, I would like, within the
framework of my self-consumption energy community, that…”; 2. “To strengthen my
132 S. Döbelt and M. Kreußlein
sense of autonomy within my self-consumption energy community, I would…”; and 3.
“In order to strengthen my sense of connection with other energy producers and
consumers in my self-consumption community, I would…”. Eventually, participants
briefly presented their best idea to the group. Every participant received a remuneration
of 50 € (approx. 55 $). The maximum duration was 2 hours.
3.3 Data Collection and Analysis
Qualitative Data. One research assistant took notes to document the group discus-
sions. Additionally, we used a dictaphone to gather original quotations. We classified
notes into positive feedback and concerns. For the qualitative data collected on an
individual level (completions of phrases on gamification strategies), the written
answers of each participant were split up into single statements. In a first step, the
assignment to the available gamification approaches was reviewed. After that, a cate-
gory system was built bottom-up. Descriptive frequencies per approach and category
are reported to indicate major tendencies.
Quantitative Data. Firstly, we summated the number of dots indicating the impor-
tance of information needs and determined a weighted value per information require-
ment. Therefore, we took the colors of the dots into account (3 for one green dot, 2 for
yellow, 1 for red). Secondly, we relativized this weighted value per information to the
weighted total value of all requirements mentioned. Third, we generated a ranking of
the requirements named in each focus group.

4 Results
4.1 Scenario Evaluation
Consumer Concerns and Positive Feedback. The warm-up discussion revolved
mainly around ensuring the security of supply and the regulatory framework. The
participants doubted storage capacities and volatile energy sources to be sufficient for a
continuous supply. Consumers rated the applicability of this scenario as more likely to
be in rural areas, due to the installation of space-consuming infrastructure. In their
opinion, the high taxes on energy would certainly be passed on to the energy com-
munity. Participants in the scenario were expected to face bureaucratic hurdles for
trading electricity. Furthermore, costs and effort were addressed critically. Some con-
sumers feared that people with less affinity for technology would be excluded. In
addition, they worried about the time required and had doubts as to whether the
scenario is more cost-effective because new costs will emerge, e.g. for the algorithm,
infrastructure, and maintenance.
On the positive side, the consumers stated that the scenario is innovative and can be
combined with new technologies such as electric vehicles. Furthermore, one participant
mentioned the environmental benefits. But one participant replied that the integrated
blockchain technology is very energy-intensive and should be taken into account.
Prosumer Concerns and Positive Feedback. The main topics of the discussion were
the installation costs and again expected regulatory difficulties. The prosumers con-
sidered the concept, it’s infrastructure and administration as too demanding for com-
munities of smaller producers and consumers. They additionally mentioned
bureaucratic difficulties, with regard to the billing in apartment buildings and the
separation of the own consumption. They worried about intensive maintenance costs
that possibly would exceed profits. The principle of independence of the community
was evaluated as a positive aspect by the prosumers.
4.2 Information Needs in a Self-consumption Community
Consumers Information Needs and its Importance. The consumers mentioned nine
different aspects they would like to be informed about: 1. Security of supply (rela-
tivized weighted importance: 15.65); 2. Exit/Termination option (14.97); 3. Drafting of
contracts (14.92); 4. Assessment of producers (11.56); 5. Power source (11.56); 6.
Installation effort (10.88); 7. Definition of locality (8.84); 8. Information about grid
stability (6.12); 9. Electricity mix (6.12). Table 1 illustrates the three most important
needs with an exemplary quotation from both focus groups.
Prosumer Information Needs and its Importance. We gathered 14 different infor-
mation needs: 1. Priority for self-consumption (13.04); 2. Consumer related informa-
tion (12.07); 3. Definition of thresholds (10.43); 4. Power composition (7.83); 5.
Taxation (6.96); 6. Temporal consumption information (6.96); 7. Sales overview
(6.96); 8. Variable prices (6.96); 9. Price information (6.96), 10. Information about grid
stability (6.09); 11. Data protection (5.22); 12. Comparative prices (4.35); 13. Weather
forecast (3.48); 14. Sunshine duration (1.74).

4.3 Gamification and Motivating Extensions
Consumer Individual Ideas. Most of the overall 22 consumer statements (9) can be
assigned to the approach connectedness with others, followed by the competence
(8) and at least to the autonomy (5) approach. We formed categories for ideas men-
tioned more than once. The connectedness approach subsumed ideas on “physical
community activities” (mentioned 4 times) and “enabling exchange with others” (2).
The competence approach triggered the ideas “offering topic-related learning” (3);
“making expert knowledge accessible” (2) and “recommendations for behavior” (2).
Under the autonomy approach only “ensuring security of supply” (3) was mentioned
more than once.
Creating or maintaining a sense of community was considered the central core of the
concept. This could be achieved, for example, by information that creates a positive
image of the community. At the same time, the formation of a community and the
organization of coordination processes, e.g. with joint investments, was seen as the
biggest hurdle. In the discussion on competence-promoting measures, the participants
underlined a need for accessible, empirical knowledge. In addition, action-relevant
information (times for favorable electricity prices) was desired. Autonomy related
objections were mentioned as a kind of counter-argument to ideas on the topic of
connectedness and had been discussed less in the group.
Prosumer Individual Ideas. The overall 21 individually written statements equally
(7) distributed along the three gamification approaches. The built categories for con-
nectedness again entailed “physical community activities” (3). Additionally, prosumers
considered “formulating common objectives” (2) as interesting. The competence
approach subsumed ideas dealing with “making electricity information accessible”
(3) and “making expert knowledge accessible” (2). For autonomy, we formed two
categories: “reduce bureaucratic hurdles” (2) and “create individual control/influence
possibilities” (2). Example quotes for the most frequently named categories are illus-
trated in Table 2.
Table 1. Three most important information needs, illustrated by an example quotation and its
relativized weighted importance (RWI).
Information need Example quotation RWI
Consumer
Security of supply “My question is about the security of supply. How does this
relatively small system guarantees that nothing can happen?
Neither what can happen because our storage is empty, nor
that the person who sells says: ‘Well, I’m not selling at these
prices today. I will wait half a year.”
15.65
Exit/Termination
option
“If I have to make investments at the beginning, for example,
another meter or something else. What options do I then have
for getting out of the investment? […] if I participate […] and
it does not correspond with my ideas, I would like to have the
possibility to get out of such a concept and without great
effort.”

In the subsequent discussion, ideas on the topic of connectedness were in the fore-
ground. Here, social activities that reduce anonymity in the community were mentioned.
The participants considered it as interesting getting to know the other consumers and
producers personally and promoting the exchange among them. During the discus-
sion, it was emphasized that fairness within the community should be ensured.

Information need Example quotation RWI
Drafting of
contracts
“Let’s put it this way: For me it shouldn’t be any different

year I see what I have to pay and in the best case that’s
cheaper than what I pay now.”
14.29
Prosumer
Priority for self-
consumption
“How much I sell and when; I’d like to be able to influence
that by myself. Not that I would then sell more than I
consume and then have to buy electricity. That should be
realized in a way that I don’t have to do anything.”

“I lie in my hospital bed and I see when my wife turns on the
dishwasher. That’s interesting.”

During the discussion of autonomy-based approaches, the participants emphasized that
they highly appreciate the self-determination of energy supply. Competence-based
approaches had hardly been discussed.
5 Conclusion and Discussion
Initially, the discussions in both focus groups naturally concentrated on hurdles,
especially with regard to the functional and organizational implementation of a self-
consumption community. Positive feedback was on a more general level. These results
are in line with our previous research [10]. Here the innovativeness of the community-
based approach was appreciated in contrast to the suspected increased effort and the
diminished security of supply. The least concerns were especially mentioned from the
consumers, as they are more depending on a secure supply. Indicated information
needs underlined consumers’ interest in the basic security of supply. Consequently,
confidence-building information about producers in their community are considered
important.
Furthermore, we conclude that local, community-based energy supply should be
offered to consumers as an additional (and not exclusive) option to the “normal” grid-
based supply. Accordingly, prosumers mentioned interest in functionalities that ensure
control. This underlines their avoidance of the feeling of being overruled [10]. As
prosumers showed a strong interest in detailed consumption and sales information, we
recommend implementing user interfaces that entail information and control options.
Gamification approaches that promote connectedness with other community
members have been considered as central by pro- and consumers. Social activities have
been discussed in particular. Jans, Boumann and Fielding [11] underlined in this
context already the importance of social identity theory. It promotes that interactions
contribute to group forming and the definition of group identity. Further, the emphasis
on similarities and differences to other groups will foster group definition. In addition,
our results revealed that for consumers, building competence, e.g. by access to expert
knowledge, is demanded. Therefore, we conclude that a combination of: 1.) Infor-
mation about community members enabling to identify similarities and 2.) Possibilities
to exchange competence, knowledge and therefore form a group identity can contribute
to the motivation to share energy within a self-consumption community.
Our results contribute to requirements collection from the pro- and consumer
perspective so that future work could build interface design for local energy commu-
nities upon it. Furthermore, future work can enhance requirements forming by the
aggregation of individual and/or quantitative research.

Annex 1: Description of the Self-consumption Community Scenario
for the Pro- and Consumer Group
Imagine…
… You draw your electricity mainly from your local grid/your own photovoltaic
(PV) system at home and you form a self-consumption energy community together
with your neighbors. The energy supplier and distribution system operator considers
this community to be a single entity. Within the community, you can trade energy with
your neighbors at prices that are cheaper than those of the energy supplier. You have
paid for the PV system installed in your household and the grid connection. In addition,
a smart meter is installed in your home and you are connected to a storage facility that
is also used by other people from the neighborhood. Furthermore, there is a storage
facility that is used by you and your neighbors. Users can rent the storage from the
energy supplier and charge it with the energy surplus from their PV system.
The essential part of this scenario is the trade of your surplus energy with your
neighbors. Trading is automated by an algorithm that is realized via a double auction
mechanism. This means by buying energy, the buyer is making an offer for the energy
that a prosumer wants to sell. At the same time, the seller/prosumer also makes an offer
for the price at which he wants to sell his energy. This means by selling energy, you
submit your desired price for the energy as a prosumer, while the buyer makes a bid
simultaneously. Trading is carried out using blockchain technology. A blockchain is a
distributed database that manages an ever-growing list of transactions. The database is
expanded chronologically linear, similar to a chain. In the end, new elements are
constantly added (hence the term “block chain” = “blockchain”). When one block is
complete, the next one is created. Each block contains a checksum of the previous
block. Energy prices in your community (at the local market) are lower than real-time
prices in the grid. However, you can still get energy from the grid. The price you get for
the PV surplus you produce in your community is higher than the real-time prices in the
grid and the feed-in tariff. Furthermore, the additional PV price is more attractive than
self-consumption. The difference between the selling price and the levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE) is your revenue. The LCOE is the average minimum cost at which
your electricity must be sold to reach the breakeven threshold.
Costs for the construction and operation of a power plant during an assumed
financial cycle of life and use. The energy supplier takes care of the P2P market’s
management. There is a monthly invoice consisting of five components: You pay…
1. … the share for the use of network services (transmission and distribution of
electricity). However, there is a discounted rate for your share of use.
2. … the price you offered in the auctions for the electricity you used. The money you
pay is lower than a real-time price for electricity from the grid./… the amount of
electricity you have drawn.
• If you use your own PV generated electricity, you pay a levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE).
138 S. Döbelt and M. Kreußlein
• If you trade the PV surplus, the earnings depend on the auction. However, the
money you receive is higher than a feed-in tariff or the real-time price of
electricity on the grid.
Costs for transmission and distribution of P2P trading electricity are excluded. You
can draw energy from the grid at any time, which is more expensive.
3. … the power storage facility. This storage battery can either be rented or purchased.
Monthly rental rates or one-off purchase costs, therefore, do incur.
4. … the algorithm that fixes local (energy) bottlenecks and offers the ability to obtain
cheap energy via auctions.
5. … the share for the P2P management carried out and set up by the energy supplier
and distribution system operator.
By trading (locally) in your community, the energy transmission fees are lower.
Although there are costs for the P2P (management) algorithm, these costs are less than
the total profits. The advantage for consumers/prosumers are that, as a flexible con-
sumer, he or she can obtain energy from a prosumer at a lower price than the network
price/they sell their surplus energy to a flexible consumer at a higher price compared to
the distribution system operator. You can reduce the payback time of your PV system
and thus lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
In short, you pay your energy bill, including additional shares for storage and
the algorithm.
