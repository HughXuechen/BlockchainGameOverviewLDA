Abstract—This paper presents the case of the blockchain-based
game CryptoKitties (Axiom Zen, 2017), more specifically, one
particular way of making game tokens potentially more valuable
by labeling them ‘vintage’. Firstly, I show how the meaning
of ‘vintage’ was collectively constructed by the community of
players and negotiated online until it was acknowledged by the
owners of the game. Secondly, I measure the influence of the
‘vintage’ label on the game market in the first six months of 2018.
I base my measurements on open market data available through
such services as KittyHelper, Etherscan and the Chrome plug-in
CKBox. I conclude that ‘vintage kitties’ did not acquire surplus
market value even after they became a publicly recognized part
of the game: breeding them resulted in losses for the majority
of players. However, their retro aesthetics inspired creativity of
many players and signified the social status of “the new rich”.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain technologies have enabled a new way to design
scarcity of digital goods [1] and, potentially, construct new
forms of market value based on it. This idea has found
practical realisation in a number of digital media projects,
from Cryptopunks [2] to Care Bears on blockchain [3] and
initiated the current boom of NFTs on the art market [4] [5].
In these projects, game assets and collectible items exist as
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on blockchain and can be traded
for cryptocurrency. CryptoKitties [6], the subject of this study,
is the first game of this kind that saw considerable popularity
and even larger media attention at the end of 2017.
CryptoKitties is a browser game about breeding and trading
digital pets. Players purchase NFTs, visualised as cute-looking
kitties, and breed them with each other with the purpose to
obtain new, potentially rare and beautiful cats and sell them
to other players. CryptoKitties have many blockchainless pre-
decessors such as Neopets [7], Ovipets [8], as well as popular
monster breeding simulators such as DragonVale [9] and My
Singing Monsters [10]. Despite the scalability problems that
put the Ethereum platform to halt in 2020 [11] and particularly
high volatility of cryptocurrencies in 2018 and 2021, the game
still goes on, functioning as a relatively successful experiment
in gamification of blockchain [12].
This research was conducted with crucial support from the Evald and Hilda
Nissi Foundation for PhD students involved in commerce studies.
The innovative aspect of the game lies in its open peer-
to-peer marketplace where players can trade the pets that
they have bred for cryptocurrency Ether. To be fair, same
can be done e.g. in OviPets with in-game currency, but there
is no built-in possibility to cash out earnings. Cashing out
in traditional virtual worlds is usually limited due to money
laundering [13], gambling [14] and in-game economic crises
[1]. What makes CryptoKitties truly different from its prede-
cessors is the opportunity to turn in-game value into real-world
value by using cryptocurrencies. Since 2018, more similar
‘play-to-earn’ blockchain games have entered the market, such
as Axie Infinity [15]. These games claim to empower their
players [16] and are even recommended to children [17]. Such
claims call for investigation of already mature blockchain-
based marketplaces and the typical practices of their players.
Blockchain-base games exist in the environment of ubiq-
uitous speculation on cryptocurrency markets [18] [19], and
the marketplaces of NFTs demonstrate the same behaviors
[20]. Most ‘crypto games’ are predominantly games of chance,
which invites comparison to gambling [21]. Abundance of
NFTs available for purchase puzzles newcomers: it becomes
very difficult to understand which ones are valuable (which
often benefits more experienced traders). However, such games
can provide enjoyable leisure time to a responsible and well-
informed player [22], and many gaming practices are indeed
collective initiatives of their active and pro-social players,
rather than top-down decisions made by game publishers. In
this article, I analyze one such communal practice of collecting
‘vintage kitties’ in CryptoKitties.
II. WHAT CONSTITUTES ‘VINTAGENESS’?
A. The rules of the game
Following the common heuristics of virtual economies [1],
the initial project of CryptoKitties’ economy is based on
artificial scarcity. Its best realization can be found in the com-
plicated ‘genetic makeup’ of digital cats. Particular snippets
of computer code work as different ‘genes’ associated with
certain attributes in the appearance of the ‘kitty’. The full
genetic composition of CryptoKitties has been deciphered by
its players, who treated it as another game puzzle, within the
first year of the game’s existence [23]. By breeding ‘kitties’
with different attributes, the player can achieve a mutation
- a ‘kitty’ with a new attribute of a higher level. Higher

Fig. 1. A breeding scheme for base color attributes. Keywords stand for
particular colors and shades of the body of a ‘kitty’ that can be inherited with
the corresponding ‘genes’. Attributes marked red are ‘vintage’: shadowgrey,
greymatter, koala, cloudwhite and onyx are different shades of grey. Similar
charts exist for the color of eyes, highlights and accents, as well as for all
other attributes.
level traits are derived from lower level traits with decreasing
probability: the chance of mutation is 14% for levels 1 and
2 and 7% for levels 3 and 4. Such a complicated breeding
system was created to ensure that higher level traits remain
relatively scarce. For instance, there is a 7% chance to breed
a ‘kitty’ of the rare color titled ‘firstblush’ if its parents are
colored ‘hotcocoa’ and ‘shamrock’ and have optimal sets of
corresponding ‘genes’ (Fig. 1). Playing the game requires a
solid understanding of probabilities and can be compared to
the practice of professional gambling [24]
This particular study only deals with the color of ‘kit-
ties’, represented by four variable traits: eye color, base
color (body), highlights and accents. Generally, the palette
of computer-generated ‘kitties’ is limited: there are 31 color
options for each variable trait, and some colors are much
more common than others. Same as with other traits, these
31 options are hierarchically organized into four levels based
on the logic of breeding and mutation.
Another way to control scarcity is to limit the issue of
particular tokens. Despite the commonly repeated marketing
message, blockchain-based games are not decentralized: their
developers have sufficient control over the processes of value
creation and extraction in them [25]. In the case of CryptoKit-
ties, Generation 0, or Gen 0 ‘kitties’, stand for such ‘artificially
scarce’ resources. These tokens are created by the automated
‘smart contract’ named Kitty Clock. It is executed by the
account that belongs to the owners of the game. All other
‘kitties’ in the game descend from this ‘generation zero’, and
their price drastically decreases with every next generation.
Gen 0 tokens were only generated during the first year of the
game’s existence. The developers publicly sold them to players
by descending clock auction (the buyers would wait until the
price of the token would decrease enough to correspond to
their perceived value). Initially, 50,000 of such tokens were
planned for distribution, and this number is hardcoded into
the smart contract of the game [26]. However, according to
the developers only around 38,000 Gen 0 ‘kitties’ had been
generated and sold to players between November 23, 2017,
and November 30, 2018, when the metaphorical Kitty Clock
stopped [27] 1). To be fair, the limit of 38,000 tokens does not
make them particularly scarce in the game that has consistently
had only a few thousands of monthly active players throughout
most of its lifespan [12]; still, as we will see, these tokens
retain a relatively high value and are generally resellable on
the second hand market.
The idea of so-called ‘vintage kitties’ is of particular interest
in this regard, because it goes against the rational logic of
artificial scarcity. It embodies a playful, rather than calculated,
attitude that originated from the community of players as
opposed to the game design implemented by the developers.
The only condition for ‘vintage’ is that the ‘kitty’ should look
more or less monochrome: all four possible different colors in
its design should be black, grey or white, regardless of their
level or other secondary characteristics.
B. The origins of vintage
According to the definition collectively established by the
game community on Discord, ‘vintage kitties’ are ‘kitties’ only
colored in different shades of black, white, and grey, some-
times with slight tints of other colors, which makes them look
like characters in a black and white film. Monochrome ‘kitties’
existed long before the concept of ‘vintage’ was established,
and they were sometimes distinguished for their aesthetic
qualities. As of January 31, 2021, there were at least five
monochrome kitties born or traded before April 11, 2018 who
were renamed “Shades of Grey”, and two monochrome kitties
renamed “Greyscale” because of their appearance. There were
also hundreds of less appealing monochrome tokens in the
game before the players gave them a collective name.
The idea of ‘vintage’ as a recognized part of the game
took its shape in a discussion on Discord on April 11, 2018.
This day was established as the official date of birth of
the ‘vintage kitties’. One of the most active members of
the community even bought a special ‘kitty’ and renamed it
after this memorable date - it is still available in the game,
symbolically valued 4.11 Ether [29].
The idea of a perfectly monochrome ‘kitty’ initiated some-
times heated discussions about the exact attributes and colors
1The actual number may be even smaller, according to KittyHelper.com
[28]

that should be considered ‘true vintage’. The community
remembers one particular person who was the first to sys-
tematically describe and codify the attributes that ‘vintage’
kitties should have, in a shared Google document [30]. This
player’s identity was known to some players; however, I will
further refer to them by a random made up name Judy. The
first definition of ‘vintage’ was not complete: the game had
been online for only four months at that time, and developers
of the game were still introducing new attributes, some of
which appeared to be monochrome later (see Table I).
Today, the indicator of ‘vintageness’ can be seen in the
community-made Chrome extension CKbox used by most
players to enhance the official game interface. Table I lists all
‘vintage’ attributes, according to this semi-official extension.
If all four colored traits of a ‘kitty’ are from this list, CKbox
labels the token in the game as ‘Community fancy’ - ‘Vintage’.
To illustrate distribution and relative scarcity of ‘truly vintage’
attributes, the total number of ‘kitties’ with each trait has
been calculated as of January 31, 2021. The total number of
‘vintage’ kitties at that time was 3031.
Table I demonstrates that ‘vintage’ involves attributes of
varied scarcity, from very common ‘thundergrey’ eyes to
rather rare ‘koala’ and ‘cyborg’ colors. Also, this classification
preserves the evidence of a typical community dispute: the
‘lilac’ secondary color was initially rejected because of its
vibrant shade. Nevertheless, it became a part of the ‘vintage’
canon later and is recognized as ‘vintage’ by CKBox [31].
Other traits that were absent from Judy’s canon only started
appearing in the game after April 11, 2018, gradually intro-
duced by the developers of the game.
The players have put considerable effort into making ‘vin-
tage’ tokens a meaningful part of the game experience. But did
it translate into other forms of value, such as market value?
After exploring the origins of ‘vintage’, I collected the market
data to answer the following research questions:
Q1. What effect did the concept of ‘vintage’ have on the
supply and the prices of the corresponding tokens?
Q2. What kind of value did the concept of ‘vintage’
generate?
III. THE STATE OF THE ‘VINTAGE’ MARKET
This study is based on the data related to 766 NFTs -
playable and collectable blockchain-based tokens (‘vintage
kitties’) and the transactions that involved them between
January 11, 2018 and July 12, 2018. This period of time was
selected to adequately compare time periods before and after
the introduction of the concept of ‘vintage’ on April 11, 2018.
January 11, 2018 is the day when the first monochrome token
appeared in the game.
Altogether, there are 455 ‘vintage kitties’ that appeared
in the game from its very beginning to April 10, and 311
new ‘vintage kitties’ between April 11 and July 12, 2019.
This suggests that active discussions in the community may
not have translated into the regular practice of breeding and
trading ‘vintage’ kitties in the game soon enough (Fig. 2). To
further investigate this issue, I obtained the market data on
Fig. 2. The total number of new ‘vintage kitties’ that appeared in the game
before and after the official establishment of the concept. Gen 0 ‘kitties’ are

contract of the game. Visualization by Excel 2016.
each individual ‘vintage’ token within the observed period.
The data used in this paper includes the date when each token
appeared in the game, dates of the sales involving these tokens
across the mentioned period, the value of each transaction in
ETH, and all sellers’ Ethereum wallet addresses. All this data
is available as open data on Ethereum and can be accessed
through a variety of Ethereum analytics.
The data was obtained from the free open service Kit-
tyHelper.co [28]. I manually went through the history of
transactions for each ‘vintage kitty’ via the CKBox Chrome
plugin [31] and double-checked dubious cases on Etherscan
[21]. By collecting the data manually, I was able to obtain
additional qualitative data and sometimes observe meaningful
off-chain events, such as the transactions on an external market
OpenSea, use of ‘wrapping’ services and changes in the names
of tokens. The principal data collection was finalized on
January 31, 2021, and minor corrections were added on June
30, 2021.
The initial inspection showed a rather active second hand
market: the most resold token in the sample changed hands
six times. However, only 226 of 689 (33%) of the ‘kitties’
bred by players in the sample have been sold at least once. Of
77 Gen 0 tokens generated and sold by the game developers,
all have been sold at least once (from developers to players),
and 31 of these 77 (40%) have been sold at least twice, thus
entering the second hand market.
At the stage of cleaning, I excluded several dimensions
from my data to focus on my research questions, which also
delineates the limitations of my study. Two most important
areas of uncertainty are transaction fees and multiple accounts.

A. Transaction fees
Every transaction on Ethereum is accompanied by a fee
in Ether paid from the wallet that initiates the transaction.
The fees are calculated case by case and can range from an
equivalent of several US cents to practically limitless amounts
of Ether as a result of the trader’s mistake [32]. The data
about all factual transaction fees can be obtained from the
analytical platform Etherscan; they are excluded from this
paper because of the technical limitations and the additional
level of complexity it would add. For the needs of this article,
I acknowledge the existence of fees but do not calculate them.
The fees are, at least, partially in control of traders, if we
assume that they are acting rationally: such traders would
make decisions about preferred transaction fees based on the
estimation of future profits. As we will see, a rational trader
would not get involved with ‘vintage kitties’ at all in the
described case.
B. Multiple accounts
Based on the transactional data alone, the economy of
‘vintage’ looks almost like a gift economy (Mauss, 2000):
many gift transactions can be observed [33]. In most cases,
it is the same person transferring tokens between multiple
accounts. Accessing the game through multiple wallets is
the most common way to manage one’s identity online.
These wallets are used for different purposes of play and
communication, such as organizing tokens into collections,
representing a ‘brand’ on the marketplace, and, in rare cases,
deception and market manipulation. Sometimes the actual
trade happens elsewhere to minimize transaction fees on the
Ethereum platform. Finally, some players actually give their
assets away for free for a variety of reasons (and contributing
to the case of ‘vintage’ may also be one of such reasons).
I excluded gift transactions from my data, because they are
not relevant to the economic value created on blockchain in
particular.
Existence of multiple and shared wallets affects data collec-
tion, as contextual knowledge is required to find out whether
two or more wallets are in fact the same person. In case
of multiple wallets (and potentially owners), I only refer to
the addresses of the wallets that received the payment for
the token, ignoring any gift transactions that happened in
between. In the words of the crypto personality Lark Davis,
”The moneymaking only happens in crypto when you press
the ’sell’ button” [34]. This is sufficient for my goals here,
because we can only measure the surplus value when it is
already in the wallet of the seller. This also means that I focus
on tokens instead of individual players: in this way, I utilize the
inherent affordances of blockchain. Each token is unique and
presumably indestructible, and all blockchain transactions that
involve it are recorded in the immutable ledger. Each ‘kitty’
has its own ‘digital destiny’ that can be easily reconstructed
from the open data on blockchain, - and ‘vintage kitties’ are a
very particular class with shared aesthetic properties, similar
trajectories on the market and, potentially, comparable value.
C. Are ‘vintage kitties’ a worthy investment?
If ‘vintage kitties’ are valuable in the community, is it
possible to gain profit by trading them? Do their aesthetic
qualities translate into higher prices on the market? If true, this
would mean that the concept of ‘vintage’ can generate market
value in the simplest financial terms (Q2). Theoretically, the
tokens would be resold for higher prices on the second market
after they had been labeled ‘vintage’, and we would be able to
measure, or at least, to register the surplus value in the market
data.
Unfortunately, the market data appeared to be far too
irregular for statistical analysis. Firstly, the ‘kitties’ bred by
players should be separated from Gen 0 ‘kitties’ that were
generated and sold by the developers. The distribution of sale
prices for these two categories is radically different (Fig.4.
Generally, Gen 0 tokens constitute a separate category of
game assets that are mostly traded with much higher profit
than any other tokens in the game, although their average price
has slowly declined with time (Fig.4).

Fig. 3. Differences in distribution of sale prices for Gen 0 and player-bred
‘kitties’. Visualisation by RStudio.
In the current sample, the average price of a Gen 0 ’vintage’
kitty sold between January 11 and July 12, 2018, was 0.2487,
and the median price was 0.1976. According to the statistics
preserved at the community-built service KittyExplorer [35],
the average price of a regular (not necessarily ‘vintage’) Gen
0 within the same period of time would be ETH0.2463. The
median price of all 23,202 Gen 0 tokens sold within the period
of 6 months is not meaningful in this context.
Generally, Gen 0 ‘kitties’ are about ten times more ex-
pensive than player-bred ‘kitties’ with similar attributes, and
‘vintage kitties’ are not much different. For comparison, the
average price of a ’vintage kitty’ bred by players (Gen 1 and
later) within the same period was 0.0393 (6.33 times cheaper),
and the median price was 0.0129 (15.32 times cheaper).
Paradoxically, ‘vintage’ is in fact much more scarce than Gen
0. Only 0.15% of all tokens were ‘vintage’ (3,031/1,993,821)
as of January 31, 2021, while around 1.8% (36,260/1,993,821)
were Gen 0. The historical reason for the relatively high price
of Gen 0 is their fixed supply. Potentially, it is possible to breed
an endless number of ‘vintage kitties’, but it is technically
impossible to breed another Generation 0 ‘kitty’ (unless the
developers release more of them).
D. The concept of ‘vintage’ and the market prices
Did the concept of ‘vintage’ influence the market, and
especially the market of ‘kitties’ bred by players? Observable
differences in prices of ‘vintage kitties’ before and after their
acknowledgement by the community could help locate the po-
tential surplus value of ‘vintage kitties’. However, the numbers
tell the opposite: before April 11, 2018, the average price
of a player-bred (non-Gen 0) ‘vintage kitty’ was ETH0.0333,
and the median price was ETH0.012. Starting from April 11,
2018, the average price would decrease to ETH0.0262, and
the median price to ETH0.01. On average, ‘vintage kitties’
surprisingly became cheaper after their idea had been approved
by the community, which, most likely, reflects the general
downward trends in the prices in the game [36], unrelated
to the idea of ‘vintageness’.
Another possible indicator of surplus value could potentially
be found in increased revenue per transaction. For the needs
of this article, revenue per transaction is calculated as the
difference between the sale price and the birth fee or the
buy price in the previous transaction with the same token.
Transaction fees were ignored. Negative revenue represents a
loss. 2
For all sales of all player-bred ‘kitties’, average revenue
per transaction was 0.0024 across the entire observed period,
which would hardly cover the fee for one transaction on
Ethereum in 2018. The median revenue equals the birth fee
and is actually the loss of -0.008 Ether, because most kitties
bred by players were never sold. Calculated for the period of
time between January 11 and April 10, the average revenue
from a transaction that involved a player-bred ‘vintage’ kitty
amounted to approximately ETH0.0043 per token. Average
revenue since April 11 was actually the loss of -0.0006 Ether
after the ‘vintage’ kitties were introduced. Median revenue
was -0.008 in both cases, because the majority of transactions
in the sample can be described as breeding a kitty, paying the
birth fee of ETH0.008 and never getting any returns on this
investment. One possible explanation of sinking profits may be
the game’s resemblance to gambling: even more people would
breed ‘kitties’ without realising the odds, ending up with the
‘kitties’ that they did not want (the players who were not on
Discord might not even know about the concept of ‘vintage’).
Even more likely, this is yet another sign of market stagnation
in general: the supply of ‘kitties’ by far outgrew the demand
at this point [36] [37].
However, the second hand market of Gen 0 kitties generated
sustainable revenue per transaction. The average revenue per
transaction on a second hand market involving a Gen 0 ‘kitty’
was ETH0.0583, and the median revenue per transaction was
ETH0.0282. In comparison, the average revenue for any other
‘kitty’ within the same period would be 25.35 times less
(ETH0.0023) and the median revenue would be a loss of -
0.008 Ether. There are not enough sales of Gen 0 ‘vintage
kitties’ to observe a statistically meaningful change in their
prices before and after the introduction of ‘vintage’, but these
prices were most likely in line with the market of Gen 0 tokens
in general.
E. Whose profits are these? Developers vs. players
A closer look into revenues per transaction can reveal how
revenues are distributed between different types of transactions
and, eventually, traders. The most privileged category is the
developers themselves: they seem to be the only actors on
the virtual marketplace who managed to generate considerable
and consistent revenue during the observed period. As it has
been described in the section “The origins of vintage”, Gen 0
‘kitties’ were the ’kitties’ sold by the developers themselves,
and this is also true for ‘vintage’ Gen 0 tokens. When players
bought Gen 0 tokens from the Kitty Clock, they generated
2The breeding fee remains ETH0.008 across my sample, although it
changed several times, reaching 0.032 as of January 31, 2021

revenue for the game owners and developers (see [26], p.
7 Section 2.4 A sustainable revenue model). As the address
of the Ethereum wallet is public, it is possible to calculate
that, in total, ‘vintage’ Gen 0 kitties born between January
11 and July 12 generated the revenue of ETH18.3853 for the
game developers. It must be noted, though, that the developers
cannot fully control The Kitty Clock, and the combinations of
colors in the ‘kitties’ it produced were fairly random.
The second largest total volume of revenues per transaction
belongs to the resellers of Gen 0 ‘kitties’, especially those
who managed to ‘flip’ these tokens, or sell them quickly
enough before the prices went down. The total sum of all
revenues (and also, losses) on the secondary market of Gen 0
specifically amounts to ETH2.3337, with considerably higher
revenue per transaction, as we have already seen. However,
trading on this segment of the second hand market requires
much larger investments, as well as perfect timing, which can
be achieved, for example, by using trading bots. Almost all of
the revenue was made by the traders who were able to buy a
Gen 0 ‘kitty’ from the ‘smart contract’ for a particularly low
price and then quickly resell it. Approached in such a way,
the game becomes a profit-oriented ‘play-to-earn’ enterprise
rather than an intrinsically playful and joyful activity.
The least profitable occupation in the observed period
appeared to be breeding and reselling player-bred ‘kitties’. The
sum of all revenues and losses by all players who participated
in market transactions with player-bred ‘vintage kitties’ (Gen 1
and higher) during the observed period of six months amounts
to 1.7254 Ether. On the average, substantial losses of many
players were compensated by rare but high revenues of other
players who used speculative strategies. Eventually, ‘vintage
kitties’ did not generate any profits for regular amateur traders,
apart from the common ‘flipping’ of Gen 0 ‘kitties’ that went
on regardless of ‘vintageness’. This is in line with other studies
on profitability of CryptoKitties in general [36].
IV. EXAMINING THE SUPPLY OF ‘VINTAGE’ TOKENS
It is almost impossible to list all potential factors that
influence the prices of ‘kitties’. After all, CryptoKitties is a
game, with its own unique culture, seasonal and promotional
marketing campaigns, random occurrences and ‘black swan’
events, and a number of rich and famous ‘celebrity players’.
One such player is of particular importance to this study: he
was the wealthiest player in the game, a so-called ‘crypto
whale’, back in 2018. He was not affiliated with the game
developers and owners; other active players on Discord gen-
erally knew his identity, but, normally, he did no harm and
refrained from using his enormous stake in the game against
the community. He also had an unrestrained spending habit
and tended to over-indulge in chance mechanics. I will further
refer to this player by a random made up name Silver Mustang.
Having public access to all transactions in one’s Ethereum
wallet, we can see that Silver Mustang has spent ETH1.3341
specifically on ‘vintage kitties’ within the observed period of
time. This sum was spent on breeding 150 ‘kitties’ (ETH0.008
each time), and buying one kitty for ETH0.1341. His revenue

-1.2576 Ether. 3 It was often speculated in the chat that Silver
Mustang owned at least 20 % of the game assets in general.
Indeed, from 689 ‘vintage’ kitties born between January 11
and July 12, 150 were bred by Silver Mustang, which equals
22 %. Besides, his active participation in the game coincided
with the peaking ‘birth rate’ among ‘vintage kitties’ both
before and after establishment of the concept. As it can be
seen from Fig.5, Silver Mustang alone influenced the birthrate
in the ‘vintage’ population much more than the introduction
of the concept of ‘vintage’: 64 ‘vintage kitties’ were born in
his estate before April 11, and 86 such ‘kitties’ on and after
April 11. Based on this, Silver Mustang might have put at
least some effort into breeding this particular type of ‘kitties’
after the community gave them a name. However, he only
sold 6 out of 150 ‘vintage kitties’ that he bred, he was not
even trying to sell the rest, and he rarely engaged in playful
activities described in Section V.
V. VINTAGE AS ‘SYMBOLIC CAPITAL’
Are ‘vintage’ kitties essentially worthless? Or is it just
a different form of value (Q2)? Based on the qualitative
observations obtained while collecting the data, I suggest that
the gain is creative, not financial. This part of the game can
be described as a collective playful practice that generates
value outside of the marketplace. Of course, ‘kitties’ are not
created by players themselves. Their unique sets of attributes
are algorithmically generated in a randomized manner, based
on the computer code of their ‘parents’. The creative process
of making new ‘kitties’ is carried out in cooperation between
human players and self-executing ‘smart contracts’. Neverthe-
less, the resulting tokens only obtain their value in circulation
between human players who ascribe meaning to them (and
there are also non-human players, e.g. breeding and trading
bots). After the meaning of ‘vintage’ has been established,
some players invest a lot of their time and creativity, not just
money, into collecting, ‘breeding’, describing and organizing
these tokens into custom collections.
The first example of such playful activity is the account by
the name of Vintage Kitties that supposedly belonged to Judy.
Two first ‘vintage’ tokens were transferred to this account in
a gift transaction on March 17, 2018, three weeks before the
community caught up with the idea. The account was actively
trading ‘vintage kitties’ with other members of the community
during the following year. For instance, on April 12, 2018,
Vintage Kitties bought 3 kitties for ETH0.01 each, renamed
them Vintage and later sold them for ETH0.0059, ETH0.0067
and ETH0.0069, with total loss of ETH0.0105 not counting
the fees. Within the observed period, this account bred 15
vintage kitties and cumulatively gained ETH0.0578 in sales.
Meanwhile, their investments into the idea of ‘vintage’ by far
3We may speculate that the same player also bought a second Gen 0
‘vintage’ for ETH0.0827 when he was logged in through his other wallet,
and immediately transferred it to his main wallet, but we do not have a hard
proof that these two wallets belong to the same person, apart from a single
weird gift transaction of an item worth $111.67 at the time, according to
Etherscan.com [21]).
surpassed the revenues: Vintage Kitties bought 10 ’vintage’
kitties on the second hand market for a total of ETH0.0949. All
but one purchase were made before the community recognized
the concept of ’vintage’. They also bought three vintage Gen
0 kitties for a total of ETH0.5847: however, these tokens can
be sold with profit regardless of their ’vintageness’ and should
not be written off as losses in the long term. More importantly,
the idea of ‘vintage’ kept this player active for a considerable
amount of time, and initiated many transactions on the market
and discussions on Discord. Even if the idea did not generate
profits, it connected the player with some of the notable buyers
such as the ‘crypto celebrities’ Jimmy.Eth, Alan Falcon and
Queen Cryptoria, well known in the blockchain community.
Another notable case is the account named RareKitties
Vintage. It only became active in March 2019, which tech-
nically makes it out of scope of this particular paper. This
player accumulated a wealth of ‘vintage kitties’ in 2019 and
2020 (180 as of June 30, 2021). Most of these ‘kitties’ were
given custom names and carefully arranged into collections.
Their latest collection, Vintage HaCKatao [38] , was mostly
assembled at the end of 2020, following the collaboration
between CryptoKitties and the artist duo Hackatao from Milan
[39]. The tokens in this collection are both ‘vintage’ and
decorated by Hackatao (Fig. 6).
‘Vintage’ kitties do not differ from all other ‘kitties’ by
their origin or age: the only difference is aesthetic. Their
appearance seems to satisfy a particular need of players who
embellish their accounts with monochrome collections. The
multi-colored world of CryptoKitties is, for the most part,
rather ugly, as the colors and other features of CryptoKitties
are generated and combined in a random manner. The acciden-
tal monochrome of ‘vintage’ subverts the tawdry palette of this
algorithmically generated world. It provides a visual remedy
against ‘digital weariness’ that repetitive virtual worlds cause
with their ”finitude and banality” [41].
This unintentional effect of authenticity and exclusiveness
is conveyed by appealing to pre-digital, black and white
photography and cinema - ‘the silver screen’. This metaphor
was picked up by the owners and developers of the game [42]
and inspired several players who renamed their ‘kitties’ after
film stars of the past. As of January 31, 2021, there were at
least two most prominent ‘cinematic’ collections, owned by
Jimmy.Eth and by CryptoKitties Vintage.
Are contemporary ’crypto gamers’ really nostalgic about
the classic black-and-white movies of the 40s? Making the
distinction between nostalgia and retro, Veronika Pehe uses the
term ’retro’ to designate ’a memory regime devoid of affect or
lived memory’ [43]. It allows the trendsetters to freely mix and
reinterpret the aesthetics of the past for contemporary cultural
consumption.
I suggest that the value of ’vintage kitties’ can be best
explained through the concept of cultural capital and taste
proposed by Pierre Bourdieu. According to Bourdieu, a class
structure of society postulates itself through systematic differ-
ences in lifestyle and taste. Representatives of higher classes
are expected to share exquisite taste for cultural products,

[40]
including art, literature and cinema. Moreover, they counter-
pose their ’ascetic’ aesthetic preferences to the hedonistic pop
culture of the masses [44]. Signifiers of belonging to ‘high
culture’ may change as new cultural oppositions emerge: for
example, although black and white Hollywood films were
considered ‘low culture’ at the time of their production,
they became associated with realism and artistry after color
television took over the USA and Europe in the late 1960s
(Thompson, 2010), thus becoming a sign of exquisite taste.
Remixing the references to black and white cinema and
treating it as ‘high art’, ’vintage kitties’ embody this ’ascetic’
trend in the high society of ’crypto celebrities’ such as Queen
Cryptoria or Jimmy.Eth.
VI. CONCLUSION: EMPOWERING THE HIGH SOCIETY
‘Vintage kitties’ can be described as a collective art project.
At the first stage (January 11 - April 10, 2018), ‘vintage
kitties’ come into being as ‘found objects’: they exist before
the definition of ‘vintage’, and they acquire new meaning after
the definition of ‘vintage’ is established in the community
on April 11, 2018. At the next stage, these tokens may or
may not obtain surplus value on the market: the market data
demonstrates no significant changes or trends that are specific
to ‘vintage’, apart from occasional trades within a limited
group of players, sometimes brought together by the very
idea of ‘vintage’. During this period, players start rearranging
tokens into collections and renaming them to highlight their
newly assigned symbolic properties. Then, the market for
‘vintage kitties’ stagnates, leaving behind the ‘digital traces’
of precious activities, such as authored collections and de-
scriptions. The third stage is signified by the comebacks of
‘vintage’ kitties in 2019 and 2020, when players start reusing
them in new contests and activities. It happens because of their
aesthetic qualities and symbolic connection to ‘high culture’,
not because of the market value of ‘vintage’.
How is value created on the markets of NFTs? The quantita-
tive part of this study explored the market data to answer two
research questions: “What effect has the concept of ‘vintage’
on the game market?” (Q1) and ”What kind of value did
the concept of ‘vintage’ generate?” (Q2). The results were
counterintuitive, but they clearly showed that the markets of
NFTs may not operate as advertised. Basic market analysis
demonstrates that ‘vintage’ tokens have generated losses rather
than profits in the first six months of their existence. The
only actors on the market who made a substantial revenue
of ETH18.3853 on ‘vintage’ Gen 0 alone were the owners

and developers of the game. Meanwhile, the players who bred
‘kitties’ for sale found themselves in a much more vulnerable
position: they paid the breeding fee of ETH0.008 and, in most
cases, never sold the resulting tokens. Some profits have been
made by early and quick speculation with Gen 0 tokens, even
though such tokens are still much less common than Gen 0
tokens. In other words, relative (but not artificial) scarcity of
‘vintage’ kitties did not contribute to their value on the market,
unlike less scarce Gen 0 tokens whose supply was artificially
limited by the developers.
To sum it up, the concept of ‘vintage’ did not make
a positive impact on neither supply nor the prices of the
corresponding tokens (Q1). The prices demonstrated a strong
negative trend that can be explained by external factors such
as, generally, breeding more cats but selling less of them, as the
novelty factor was wearing off. As for the supply, it appeared
that casual participation of a single extremely wealthy player
influenced the supply of ‘vintage’ tokens more than anything
else - and had almost no effect on the market as well, because
this player did not have the intention to sell his tokens. Even
if the idea of ‘vintage’ has made an impact on the market, it
was most likely obliterated by other factors and events on a
larger scale.
The second research question concerns the nature of value
created by the concept of ‘vintage’. In my qualitative ob-
servations, I have connected ‘vintageness’ to the notion of
‘cultural capital’ in a playful environment of ‘crypto games’.
There is a widening gap between ‘the rich’ and ‘the poor’
in ‘crypto gaming’, and, as quantitative research by Jiang and
Liu has shown, the game of CryptoKitties has been dominated
by ‘the rich’ since 2018 [36]. The ‘ascetic’ look of ‘vintage
kitties’ and their association with classical Hollywood cinema
corresponds to the exquisite taste that the members of a high
society are expected to have. In contemporary conditions,
cryptocurrencies are a new form of financial capital, and its
holders express their status through new forms of cultural cap-
ital, such as NFTs and ‘crypto art’ in general. Most likely, we
are observing the birth of ‘the new rich’ from the community
of cryptocurrency traders, and collectable NFTs, as well as
other forms of ‘crypto art’, may be seen as expensive, and
somewhat eccentric, signifiers of their ‘crypto wealth’ (Q2).
This fascinating new world, however, is neither democratic nor
empowering for those who cannot afford the most expensive
leisures of blockchain.
