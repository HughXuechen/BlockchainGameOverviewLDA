1 Introduction
Healthcare is an important field that requires a continuous enhancement. One of its
components is nursing human resource. Skilled nurses are considered as a primary pillar
of healthcare success.Healthcare faces daily issues.Nursing shortage is a crucial problem
in the globe [1]. This issue has been acknowledged by the World Health Organization
and other health centers and organizations in all over the world. The shortage is caused
by an increased demand for nurses, while fewer people are choosing nursing as a job.
As technology advances, so does its influence in healthcare too. Thus, technology
may provide a solution to the problem of nursing shortage through new trends such
as cloud computing, internet of things, and the emergence of blockchain technology
that could be a technical solution to such common problems. Moreover, blockchain
technology can support transparency and accountability of stored data.
Therefore, this paper aims at democratizing healthcare service by providing health-
care as a service, which can be achieved by developing medical devices with sensors

for healthcare and connecting them to the network of medical physicians and nurses
through a cloud is utilized. Blockchain is used to store patients’ records.
The following sections present a synthetic literature review on the use of blockchain
in healthcare, the proposed methodology, and conclusion and future work.
2 Previous Work
Blockchain can be considered as a distributed and secured database in which each block
has a hash to the previous block. An enormous body of literature embraces the use of
blockchain in healthcare.
In 2014, bitcoin was cleverly proposed in medical research [2]. In 2015, blockchain
popularity was increased to be a new economic model [3] and decentralizing privacy
[4].
In 2016, blockchain evolved [5], Electronic Patient Record systems (EPRs) [6], to
empower the patient-physician relationship [7]. A notable application is Medrec that
utilizes blockchain for managing permission in medical domain [8]. Blockchain can
be also useful for Interoperability [9]. Blockchain can provide protocols for medical
trustworthiness [10] and for transparency [11] as well.
In 2017, blockchain has been evolved rapidly [12]. It has contributed for health
care applications [13–15]. That contribution was proven to be very vital for health
care [16], thus empowering e-health [17]. Many previous works address challenges
and opportunities of blockchain in e-healthcare such as [18–20].
Metrics for blockchain-based healthcare decentralization are [21]:
M1. Compliance of workflow with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA)
M2. Scalability through huge populations of participants
M3. Cost-effectiveness
M4. Supporting for Turing-complete operations
M5. Supporting for user identification
M6. Supporting for structural interoperability
M7. Supporting of patient-centered healthcare
In 2018, blockchain gained its fame as a remedy for security and privacy of e-
healthcare [22]. Many systems were proposed such as Blochie [23], FHIRchain [24] and
Mistore [25].
We notice that most researchers are rushing to build blockchain-based health systems
without integrating IoT. Others worked with a different perspective using IoT without
using blockchain. Therefore, this paper is proposed to handle this issue.
This research paper integrates these two technologies to improve healthcare in
general, and the process of equipping patients in particular.
3 Proposed Methodology
In this section, we present the stakeholders of proposed system. And move towards a
mathematical model with operational framework. Furthermore, a brief discussion of how
to construct temperature sensing circuit is presented.
Using IoT and Blockchain for Healthcare Enhancement 633
The stakeholders are the patients with sensors, their relatives, nurses, physicians and
ambulances. Figure 1 illustrates the stakeholders of the proposed system.
Fig. 1. Stakeholders of the proposed system
The proposed system proposes that the patient is equipped with sensors. Physicians
and nurses are linked to monitors to track the status of the patient. In emergency cases,
the system sends a message to the ambulance and/or patient’s relatives.
To make is easy for pondering the communications among sets of stockholders,
Table 1 shows cardinality of stakeholders.
Table 1. Nomenclature
Stakeholder set Cardinality of:
B Beds
D Physicians/Doctors
N Nurses
P Patients
Assume that there are P patients, N nurses, and B beds in hospital. There are many
scalability dimensions for example from beds to patients (BP Scalability, the B÷P ratio),
and from patients to nurse (PN Scalability, the P÷N ratio).
BP Scalability does not concern us, as it defines the physical capacity of hospitals.
PN Scalability, however, can scale up and be enhanced with the technology presented
in this paper.
Figure 2 shows a proposed framework, inspired by [26]. At the beginning, CARE
can be redefined to stand for medical Countermeasure (C), based on Analysis (A) and
Repository (R) of Events (E). Nurses are tracking the status of enrolled patients. All
events are stored in the blockchain repository. Events undergo an analysis process which
is recursive by nature. This means that most operational time is attributed to the analysis
phase. Analysis log data are stored in the blockchain repository too. Countermeasure
corresponds to the action to be taken.

Figure 3 shows temperature sensing circuitry. The components are ARDUINO Uno
board, breadboard, temperature sensor, Wi-Fi, wires and resistors, Light Emitting Diode
(LED), and Micro-USB cable. To build the circuit, there is a good tutorial [27].

Fig. 3. Temperature sensing circuit
The IoT circuit for temperature measurement is connected to internet. A channel in
thingspeak.com is created and linked to the circuit to get readings from the ARDUINO
device. ARDUINO device is more available and durable in the market rather other
devices according to regional market.
Figure 4 shows the architecture of the proposed system. The first run of blockchain
will be mining the Genesis block. Then the proposed system displays the hash of the
Genesis block.
After that, the system interactively asks about somedata and encapsulates the answers
in the blockchain. These data are:
a) Patient’s Full Name
b) Patient’s Address
c) Hospital
d) Disease
e) Medication given
f) Final Bill Amount

4 Experiments and Results
The implementation of the private blockchain is achieved in Java as listed in the appendix.
Figure 5 shows the blockchain structure.
The first run of blockchain will be mining the Genesis block. Then the proposed
system displays the hash of the Genesis block, which happens to be:
00000d99d5b74ae4083b0dc72eb037911c7e4fc3b57cdf96
It has 5 leading zeros (nonce).
After that, the system interactively asks about some data and stores the
answers/patient records in the blockchain.
For the first patient, a block is mined, with hash:
000007e79730cbf13d1d35cf7138b6248b2df3e6093583e6
It has 5 leading zeros. For the second patient, a block is mined, with hash:
00000b632ec77b8a4eae6c78b08932624e84ab3814e13dc9
It has 5 leading zeros. After each data entry, the blockchain can be validated.

Extensa laptop, running 32-bit Windows 8.

For testing a sensor-based data for randomly generated 100 patients, the results show
that the average of creating blocks is about 6 s per patient. This is compared to manually
temperature measurement time which is 24 s per patient. With large scale of patients,
this accumulative difference will make a noticeable significant. This proposed system
does not validate its scalability by minimizing the elapsed time for measuring patient
temperature but also handling the nurse shortage noticeable.
5 Conclusion and Future Works
This paper proposed healthcare-as-a-service using IoT and blockchain. A temperature
sensing circuit is designed and linked to thingspeak.com by using wi-fi. Nurses are
tracking the sensing signal on monitors. The paper also presented how the blockchain
is used to store the health records. The proposed system is enhanced by time reduction
and minimizing nurse human resource. It is very easy to use integration of other medical
data such as pressure and, vital signs in general.
A possible future direction may integrate big data and mobile based application to
monitor the patient’s status with the IoT equipment to come.
Other possible directions are to secure the blockchain [28] and to investigate the
integration between the IoT and the blockchain [29].
