Abstract—A Smart city is an area that practice several kinds of 
automated Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to gather 
information and then make efficient use of perceptions 
acquired from that information to organize resources, services 
and assets proficiently. The primary purpose of Smart cities 
was to refine and enhance the life style of the people, encourage 
development without affecting the resources for the future 
generations and advancement of the functionalities in urban 
areas. With the rapid acceleration in the development of smart 
devices, security and privacy problems have turn out to be a 
main task that needs efficacious counter actions. Majorly, this 
survey commences with an outline of smart cities to offer a 
cohesive framework. After that, there is discussion about the 
privacy and security problems in present smart systems 
through the various necessities for making of a steady and safe 
smart city. To conclude, we review the present security 
techniques and as well inspirit others to further research more 
this evolving ground. 
Keywords-Internet of Things(IoT), security, privacy, 
Blockchain, Cryptography, Game Theory. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
There is no globally recognized definition to the question 
“What is a smart city?”. It varies from people to people. This 
concept, therefore, differs from state to state and from 
country to country. Every government on the globe 
understands and works for smarter cities in different ways. 
Even in one country, say India, there is not one definition to 
‘Smart cities. The reason for this definition to vary is 
dependent on the fact that no state or no country is alike, 
every state in every country has its own potential, carry a 
pace of development and different requirements. A smart 
city is generally a wish list of the services and infrastructural 
development according to the country’s scope of 
development and requirement of the development. To fulfil 
the needs of the people, the state developers plan to develop 
the whole urban eco-system, which rely further on four 
pillars of development in the fields of – institutional, 
physical, social and economic infrastructure. This together 
works in incrementing the level of ‘smartness’ of cities. 
This conception of smart cities has managed to grab the 
attention of both the people and the industries because of the 
increasing urban advancement and infrastructural growth. 
According to recent reports, it is estimated that around 66 
percent of the total population of the world will start to live 
in the urban surroundings by the year 2050 [1], that may 
result in burdening the environment and lead to climatic and 
environmental degradation. To solve this problem, different 
governments are aiming at development of the smart cities in 
an intelligent and sustainable way. Cisco has announced the 
investment of one billion dollars for the growth of smart 
cities, China also has around 200 smart city plans in 
implementation [2]. In Figure 1, it shows security is being 
increased at every level by the IoT services in their devices. 
 
 
Figure 1.          Security Levels of IoT devices  
The development of ‘smart things’ being deployed in the 
smart cities is increasing rapidly and so are the range of 
susceptibilities that can be used for the exploitation of people 
by cyber criminals. Though development of smart cities 
focuses on the rise of productivity and efficiency, but they 
can be vulnerable spots for serious risks for people when the 
cyber security is not taken care of properly. These are some 
common attacks and their countermeasures adapted till now: 
� The middle man attack: In this kind of attacks, a 
person breaches and attempts to interrupt the 
connection or communications between two 
systems. For example, these men can breach into the 
smart locks of the houses and cause burglary or other 
crimes. These are controlled by using proper 
authentication and double encryptions. 
� Fake identity attack: The EV charging stations, 
camera for surveillance and the parking garages are 
some of the smart city infrastructures which are 
unprotected and the data generated from these can be 
used as a fuel to the cyber attackers providing 
confidential private information that can be used for 
frauds or identity theft. These are prevented by 
Authentication, encryption and managing access 
controls. 
� Device hacking: In this kind of attack, the attacker 
hacks the device and takes over the control of the 
device and further use the device for personal 
benefits without regarding the privacy of the initial 
owner and attempts to exploit the privacy of the

owner. These kinds of attacks are more reportedly 
occurring than the others and many attempts are 
being made for controlling and minimizing such 
risks. Strong device identification and concerned 
access controls are provided to the users for 
prevention. 
 
This paper aims at providing a reality check to the 
audience about the security and privacy concerns in the IoT 
devices equipped smart cities. These cities are well equipped 
to provide luxury to the people and therefore attract large 
number of people and industries to it but a negative aspect 
which is not so much enlightened are the security threats and 
risks, this technology brings along. This paper also focusses 
on the challenges faced by the technology in solving these 
security issues and the threats it offers to the mankind.   
II. ARCHITECTURE OF INTERNET OF THINGS FOR SMART 
CITIES 
By the pace of growth of smart cities and to compete 
with pace, several architectures have been introduced [3]. 
There is a lack of uniformity in these IoT architectures. As 
per the purpose of this study is to review safety and privacy 
problems in smart cities. The following planning is built on 
three-layer architecture proposed et al K. Angrishi [4]. The 
architecture consists of layers described briefly below, as 
shown in Figure 2. 
� Perception Layer: This is the physical layer, as well 
identified as the sensing layer, which has sensors for 
sensing and collecting data. It’s the lowest layer in 
the architecture. The primary objective of the 
perception layer in IoT is to gather information, the 
security challenges in this layer emphasis on the 
imitating gathered information and terminating 
perception devices. 
� Network Layer: This is the layer accountable for 
connecting to other smart devices, networks, and 
servers. It identifies itself as the core layer of the IoT 
architecture which rely on simple links. Its 
characteristics are used for transmission of 
information gathered from the perception layer and 
processing sensor information.  
� Support Layer: This layer works hand-in-hand with 
the application layer and providing support to the 
necessities of various applications via smart 
computing methods. 
� Application Layer: It is uppermost layer in the 
architecture joining from client side. It provides an 
interface between the end devices and the complete 
system. It is responsible for delivering specific 
services required by applications based on user 
requirements.

III. APPLICATIONS OF IOT IN SMART CITIES 
 
The idea to create devices smart enough to decrease man 
work to nearly nil. The concept of interlinked devices where 
the technology is smart enough to exchange data with us, to 
cloud based technology and to each other (device to device). 
The illustration of the emerging smart applications of smart 
cities [5] are described below in Figure 3. 
A. Smart Homes 
Smart home devices, also often stated to as homebased 
mechanization. It is the residential extension of building 
automation and comprises the control and automation of all 
its embedded technology. A smart home is one in which the 
several electric and electronic appliances are connected to a 
central computer control system so they can be controlled by 
the user easily through some application like either be 
switched on and off at certain times. Smart home offers, 
security, energy efficiency, small functioning expenses and 
suitability. Installation of smart appliances deliver ease and 
save time, money and energy.[6] 
B. Connected Cars 
The Internet of things breakthrough the grounds of car 
industry by presenting completely new layers to the 
traditional method of cars. Connected car technology depend 
on a wide network of sensors, antennas, embedded software, 
and communication technologies to steer in our multiplex 
world. It has to make sensible choices with precision, 
momentum and reliability.[7] These necessities will become 
even more hypercritical when people renounce control of the 
steering wheel and brakes to the self-directed automobiles 
that are being positively tested on our highways now.   
C. Smart Farming  
Smart farming is an evolving idea that signifies to 
managing fields using technologies like IoT, robotics, drones 
and AI to increase the production and quality of crops while 
improving the human labour required by production. It can 
be done by monitoring the crop growth using digital sources. 
This will offer the precise values of several constraints upon 
which the growth depends. It will help the agriculturalist to 
monitor more than one agricultural field at the same period. 
Growth in business productivity by procedure automation. 
By the use of smart devices, you can systematize several 
procedures across your process of production, e.g. pest 
control, irrigation, or fertilizing.[8] There is a smart

agriculture sensors equipped product known as 
GreenIQ which is fascinating product. that uses smart 
agriculture sensors. It is a smart sprinklers regulator that lets 
you to achieve your irrigation and lighting systems remotely. 
D. Smart Environment 
 Two things determine the building and process of smart 
cities: gathering information from the environment and 
permitting individuals to use that information in a productive 
manner—sometimes to change behaviour.[9] Smart 
environments goal to gratify the involvement of individuals 
from every environment, by substituting the harmful labor, 
physical labor, and tedious jobs with automated agents. By 
implementing technical supervision gears, smart 
environment has potential to keep track of energy 
consumption, air quality, traffic congestion and bring the 
pollution and waste rate in consideration [10].  
E. Smart Industry 
This Smart Industry tendency is fetching about an 
essential alteration in the technique factories and workplaces 
work, to make them secure, more effective, more versatile 
and more nature friendly. The Industrial IoT is the root for 
the Industries, which mentions universally to bring 
automation and data exchange into the practice for 
manufacturing, also using robotics, system 
integration, cybersecurity, the Cloud, data analytics, and 
augmented reality. These methods are defined to make a 
“smart factory” where machineries, systems, and people 
communicate with each other in accordance to manage and 
observe development along the assembly line.[11]  
 
Figure 3.  Applications of Smart Cities 
IV. SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES IN SMART CITIES 
In a smart city, the data produced by people living there 
over years could well be far more treasured than the property 
on which they are living. If information is not effectively 
protected and privacy is not promised, smart cities could 
change from user-centric vision into groups that pose 
substantial danger. In past years, some issues have been 
found in various execution situations. For example, in the 
framework of smart homes and healthcare, smart machine 
producers and facility providers might get their hands on the 
private information [12]. Some of the newest problems 
caused by the swiftly evolving smart applications are listed 
below. 
A. Botnet Threats 
A botnet can be described as a group of internet-based 
applications, which includes computers, servers and Internet 
of Thing (IoT) machines contaminated and succeeded by a 
mutual kind of attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), 
DDoS, phishing outbreaks [13]. Bots distinguish from 
common malware, in which they consist of a network of 
commute with their makers, permitting them to give 
instructions to their system of bots (i.e., Zombies) and thus 
creating botnets multipurpose when it comes to their usage 
[9][10].   
B. Autonomous Cars as a Threat 
Self-driven cars are the future of transportation, these 
advanced automobiles are potentially vulnerable to an entire 
multitude of security problems. This swiftly developing 
technique has been realized as a foremost safety problem as 
when an AV is hacked, both life protection and information 
security will be in jeopardy.[14] Explicitly, hackers can 
manipulate the safety to govern remotely controlled strikes. 
C. Security vulnerabilities in smart cities 
The main fears concerning smart cities and the people 
living there is that the gears and the instruments that transmit 
information which can be hacked with no trouble. The 
hacker can then access the private information of the users 
and cause application collapse, can cause all kinds of wide 
scale signal loss, such as shutting down of tunnels or 
vaccinating toxins into the main water source.[15] 
D. Artificial Intelligence threats 
 Artificial intelligence devices show crucial parts in 
numerous smart applications, such as automated customer 
support, personalized shopping experience, etc. 
Nevertheless, the increasing usage of Artificial Intelligence 
also constitute some security risks.[16] For an instance, Self-
governing weaponries are AI systems that are automated to 
slaughter. In the hands of the wrong individual, these 
weaponries could simply cause mass casualties. 
V. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
IoT security is the technology zone apprehensive with 
protecting linked devices and grids in the internet of things 
(IoT). Permitting systems to link to the internet unlocks them 
to numerous of significant vulnerabilities if they are not 
correctly secured.[17] Therefore, IoT security assists 
maintaining information integrity and preventing information 
by hackers. All transmission with your IoT applications 
should be validated using powerful password, validation 
protocols or time-based validation tokens.[18] 
A. Validation and Privacy 
 Validation is a primary prerequisite for secure 
implementation of a smart system and is desirable to 
demonstrate characteristics and guarantee the clients with 
authorization can acquire facilities across an assorted scheme 
[19]. Explicitly, IoT machines installed in smart cities can 
validate the system, other junctions, and the communications 
from administration.

B. Key Functional Blocks 
 IoT safekeeping solutions require to execute the 
functional blocks explained below as interrelated parts, not 
in separation, to reach the IoT measure, information safety 
and device trust.[20] 
a) Device Reliance: Creating and handling Device 
Distinctiveness and Veracity. 
b) Information Safekeeping: Strategy determined end-
to-end information safety, confidentiality from 
conception to feasting. 
c) Operationalizing the Assurance: Systematizing and 
interfacing to the ideal based build, verified 
machineries. 
C. Lightweight invasion recognition and forecasting 
To discovering a security community to share risk 
intellect and hardening resources, a smart system is 
considered to be safe only if it can monitor the complete 
process and keep record of timely events and to notice any 
kind of unusual actions in an any event. The intrusion 
detection system (IDS) is extensively used in 
monitoring.[21] An IDS helps in safety like firewalls and 
antivirus to frequently analyze network traffic compared to 
known malicious movements. 
 
VI. CURRENT SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION 
TECHNOLOGIES 
This segment highlights the present and important 
technologies used to manage safety and privacy dreads in the 
smart cities.[22] 
A. CRYPTOGRAPHY 
Cryptography is a very essential technology which is 
used for safeguarding the information that travels over the 
WWW. Encryption is used to prevent the content of the 
emails, newsletters, chats, calls, web transactions and 
different forms of media shared over the internet from being 
stolen and mishandled. Cryptography makes sure to fulfil its 
role in providing authentication, authorization, 
confidentiality, integrity and nonrepudiation of the 
information to the author. Cryptographic algorithms play a 
vital role in jobs such as data encryption, digital signatures. 
The public key infrastructure systems (PKIS) are used for 
designing the cryptographic keys that encrypt the data 
transient among the useful characteristics like email 
addresses, domain name system addresses, etc. The 
cryptographic algorithms are now being used in an 
incrementing ratio of devices to ensure high security. In the 
IoT field, cryptographic algorithms are the majorly used 
privacy protection methods allowing a large number of tools 
to be applied practically.  
The old-style algorithms and encryption methods are not 
much fit for the high technology-based devices used now 
because of the increased complexity levels and varying 
energy consumption requirements. In this way the 
lightweight encryption methods comes to limelight and used 
for applying the cryptographic technologies. For the 
protection of users’ communication from both ends from the 
DDoS attacks. Mahmood et al introduced a lightweight 
authentication mechanism that targets to provide safety to the 
smart city applications. 
Another method that has attained increasing importance 
in the past years is Homomorphic encryption (HE) that 
performs calculations on the encrypted data. The 
homomorphic encryption method focusses on preventing the 
sensitive information from being decoded while performing 
the calculations.  
Zero-knowledge proof is one of the more improved 
cryptographic method that allows one group to substantiate 
something to the other parties, without revealing the 
encrypted data. For example, Dousti et al. [23] developed an 
authentication protocol using zero-knowledge proofs for 
smart cards. 
B. BLOCKCHAIN 
Blockchain at a very basic level can be called as a chain 
of blocks but not technically. The word “block” actually 
refers to the digital information and the word “chain” is 
referring to the database in which it is stored. This database 
is public.[24] The digital information mainly comprises of 
three parts: i) These blocks stores information about your 
transactions like the time, date, and amount of the most 
recent transaction in dollars. ii) blocks store information 
about the participant in the transaction in the form of the 
digital signature which acts as a unique username. iii) lastly, 
they store data that is used to differentiate it from other 
blocks by using a unique ‘hash’ code, which are 
cryptographic codes created using cryptographic algorithms. 
For new data to be added to the Blockchain, four steps have 
to happen, that are: i) a transaction must take place, ii) the 
same transaction must be verified, iii) that transaction must 
be stored in a block, iv) a unique hash code must be given to 
the block. 
A copy of every Blockchain is available to all the 
computers in the network and all the copies are identical to 
one another, that makes the manipulation of the information 
very difficult. So, for manipulation of one piece of 
information, the hacker would need to manipulate all the 
copies of a particular Blockchain on the network. Therefore, 
Blockchain is also termed as “distributed ledger”. 
This clearly increases the reliability of users on the 
Blockchain for multiple applications’ security, but it is still 
primary stage in the field of IoT. 
C. BIOMETRICS 
Biometrics is one of the most used authentication 
techniques used in the IoT based systems. Biometrics are the 
physical human characteristics which digitally identify a 
person to provide access to devices or systems or data. Facial 
patterns, voice and fingerprints are the mostly used biometric 
identifiers. Biometrics have potential to secure devices and 
data more effectively than other techniques and methods. 
According to recent studies, biometrics are ranked as 
‘effective’ and ‘very effective’ for securing data and 
protecting the data stored in cloud. 
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:41:04 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
 
240 
 
For biometric techniques to be effective, the 
implementation, maintenance and usage of these techniques 
should be proper, otherwise the risk of leakage of data can 
increase. 
D. MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING 
Machine Learning is like making the computers learn 
without being particularly programmed. The ability to learn 
makes the computers much like humans. Machine learning 
has been a great success in detecting intrusions which helps 
in protecting the networks from attacks to a great extent. The 
WSNs (Wireless sensor networks) have become an essential 
element in this smart arena. Machine learning focuses on the 
development computer programs that uses the data to learn 
and train themselves for similar data predictions. 
Data mining is phenomenon that transforms the raw data 
into important information, generally used by companies. It 
helps in the development of business by learning more about 
their customers. Data mining helps in the development of 
more effective strategies of marketing, increase sales and 
decrease costs. Data mining involves the exploration and 
analysis of data to gather possible patterns and inclinations. 
E. GAME THEORY 
Game theory is now an emerging powerful tool that is 
successfully applied in the cybersecurity fields and security 
domain of smart homes. Game theory is the study of 
mathematical models of calculated communications between 
the rational decision makers. Its applications are used in all 
the fields of logical and computer science. 
John von Neumann gave the proofs for the modern game 
theory using the zero-sum games. Many mechanisms have 
been developed from various studies by linking game theory 
with other security and protection of privacy-based 
technologies, like differential privacy. Moreover, game 
theory is also a powerful mechanism to maintain the 
protection intensity and utilization of the data. Although 
game theory is not much implemented by studies and not 
much applications are present in this technology, major 
development is yet in the field IoT security. But hopes for 
game theory to develop and be more improved and 
implemented in the smart world are high.  
 
VII. CHALLENGES FACED BY IOT IN SMART CITIES 
We are now living in a reality that was just an 
imagination once and all thanks to the Internet of Things 
(IoT) for it. It is IoT which developed the concept of smart 
cities and fulfilled it and brought the world to this stage. 
Obviously, it was not an easy journey. It faced many 
challenges and is still facing more as the technology 
grows.[25] Some of the challenges are mentioned here: 
� Infrastructure: Smart cities use sensors for 
information gathering, analysis and utilization of 
other types of energy resources. It is already very 
difficult to remove all the old hard-wired 
infrastructure with the new sensor based wireless 
infrastructure. Along with that, the security of the 
devices is also to be maintained using these sensors. 
Internet is considered to be fault resistant but one 
breach in the network can lead to interruption in the 
privacy of all the connected devices. 
� Driverless Car threats: The autonomous vehicles 
are stealing all the attention these days. They are 
being worked upon for reducing the traffic accident 
rates and to build a smarter society. But they can be 
proved to be very risky if the AVs (autonomous 
vehicles) are hacked. The hackers can threaten the 
life inside and outside the vehicle at ease. 
� Household appliances: The smart devices have 
reduced the privacy of the houses even more. There 
is no house now with no smart devices in any room, 
be it kitchen, living rooms, garages, or the bedrooms. 
These devices are of great help but once hacked can 
be fatal. The mobile phones if hacked can use 
cameras and exploit the privacy of people, the smoke 
sensors in houses or the microphones in the 
televisions can also be hacked.

To solve such issues, more and more money and minds 
are invested to come up with better and safer devices with 
are more trustable and adaptable in people’s lives to protect 
users against hacking and cyber-crimes. Better and stronger 
encryption techniques are used to increase the security in 
new applications of IoT brought into the world of smart 
cities. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
The extensive usage of smart devices has induced several 
safety and privacy problems. The growth of more innovative 
safety models is important and vastly required in both 
business and educational domain. Inspired by these reasons, 
we surveyed the modern strategies and developments in 
corresponding actions from the perceptions of several plans. 
To find the solution for the security issues for the swiftly 
emerging smart devices, it is rational to forecast that in the 
succeeding years, alleviating the existing problems will be 
the prime responsibility of smart city associated studies.
