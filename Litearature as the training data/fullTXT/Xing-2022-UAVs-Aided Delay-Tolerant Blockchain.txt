Abstract—Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural
disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building
a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the
solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain
technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the
prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing
works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobil-
ity, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to syn-
chronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can
result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper
proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the
security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions
when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks.
By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging
electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we
design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions
to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In
addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game
based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to partici-
pate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By
suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of
offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using
extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme
can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively im-
prove the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional
schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION
V EHICULAR networks deployed in the areas with fre-
quent natural disasters may face with the problems of
the paralyzation of communication networks, in which the
road infrastructures (i.e., base stations (BSs) [1], roadside units
(RSUs) [2], etc.) are broken [3]–[6]. With the advantages of
high mobility, deployment flexibility and low deployment cost,
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are significant in building an
edge computing based decentralized communication network
in post-disaster vehicular networks to address the communi-
cation dilemma of ground users [7]–[9]. In the UAVs-aided
post-disaster vehicular networks, ground users can obtain in-
formation through the air-to-air (A2A) communications and
air-to-ground (A2G) communications even if the cloud server
is disconnected [10], [11].
In such kind of temporary network, communication security is
a critical issue since the lack of supervision from an authoritative
third party [12]–[14]. Blockchain is a promising technology
in addressing such security concern with strong cryptographic
strength and specific decentralized method [15], [16]. Current
works study blockchain technology in the UAVs rescue network
in recording data and behaviors to protect the data manage-
ment [17], [18]. From recording the data transactions and users’
behaviors, UAVs based blockchain can facilitate the trustworthy
interactions among ground users in the infrastructure deficient
decentralized networks.
However, a salient challenge of applying the blockchain in
UAVs network is the high mobility. Specifically, due to the dy-
namics of network, high mobility and distributed UAVs cannot
timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain trans-
actions [19]–[21]. Current works are weak to address the prob-
lem that the delay of transaction verification and synchronization
is high in such environments, which may cause sever security
issues [22]–[24]. Since the participants in the transactions are
both offline, timely verification of authenticity of transaction is
difficult. The malicious attacker may execute various attacks
to obtain illegal profits, e.g., an attacker may hold a forged
deposit account to perform offline transactions, and a speculative
user may buy different merchandises using a same sum of fund
(which is also called double-spending attack [25]), etc.
The blockchain offline transactions are expected to achieve
the delay-tolerant transactions when the participants are both

offline [26]–[28]. By locking a number of deposits in the online
account, the blockchain users can establish the blockchain of-
fline channels to complete transactions with others when they
are offline. The offline transaction records are cached by users
and will be published to the online network to finish the block
verification and generation processes after a period of time [29].
With blockchain offline transactions, users do not need to wait
for the consensus of transaction and the synchronization of
blockchain, which is a promising solution for such dynamic
network [30].
Nevertheless, the offline transactions technology in UAVs
based blockchain is still an open and vital issue to be designed
by addressing following challenges. First, current works are
limited in addressing above attacks in the UAVs based envi-
ronments since they do not consider the mobility and the energy
limitation of UAVs. Second, few works in blockchain offline
transactions consider the optimization of deposits change in
the offline transactions. For the reason that the ground users
are selfish individuals, they are not willing to participate the
offline transactions when they cannot obtain profits right away.
In this way, an appropriate incentive scheme is required to
motivate ground users to participate the blockchain offline
transactions.
To address the above problems, this paper focuses on the case
of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transaction among electric
vehicles (EVs), and proposes an incentive and UAVs based
scheme for delay-tolerant blockchain secure offline transactions
between EVs in post-disaster vehicular networks. Fig. 1 shows
the architecture of our design, in which we establish the offline
blockchain channel among EVs and present the optimization
from two aspects. On one hand, the UAVs-aided penalty algo-
rithm is designed to address the security issues. On the other
hand, the Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is proposed
to obtain optimal utility to users.
Specifically, based on the hashed time locked contract
(HTLC) technology [31], the effective offline transactions can
be enforced for the UAVs-aided disaster environment. Different
from current works on blockchain offline channels, this paper
addresses above security issues by the presented UAVs-aided
penalty algorithm with accountable assertions, which can help
verify the authenticity and validity of transactions, and avoid
various kinds of attacks. Moreover, the blockchain offline trans-
action between charging and discharging EVs is formulated as
a Stackelberg game. On one hand, the EVs are encouraged to
improve their trust values in daily performances to obtain higher
utilities in the offline transactions. On the other hand, through
the incentive, EVs have higher positivity in participating the
blockchain offline transaction of V2V charging.
In a nutshell, the main contributions of this work includes:
� Framework design: As the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to study the blockchain offline transaction
in UAVs-aided post-disaster vehicular networks, which is
delay-tolerant, can satisfy the security demand and real-
ize deposits change optimization. The blockchain offline
channel is established between charging and discharging
EVs, which enables EVs to perform a series of transactions
although they are offline. By leveraging the character of
HTLC in enforcing the contract, the charging and dis-
charging EVs do not have to wait for the confirmation of
transactions.
� Security design: To protect users from malicious attackers
or speculative users, UAVs deployed by the government
can help verify the effectiveness of transactions. Based on
the accountable assertions by EVs, a UAVs aided penalty
algorithm is designed, from which the abnormal actions of
EVs (e.g., forging fake deposits, double-spending a same
deposit) can be effectively detected through the informa-
tion sharing among UAVs.
� Trust design: The trust values of the charging and dis-
charging EVs are integrated in the deposits and the utility
functions of them, through which the EVs are motivated to
behave more honestly and actively to improve their trust
values. In this way, EVs with higher trust values can use
a large portion of their deposits, and can obtain higher
utilities in the V2V charging offline transactions.
� Incentive design: To stimulate EVs to participate in the
V2V charging, we formulate the interactions between the
charging and discharging EVs as a Stackelberg game. By
analyzing the optimal charging power quantity and optimal
unit charging price for the charging and discharging EVs,
the utilities of the two participants can be maximized.
� Effectiveness verification: Simulations are carried out to
verify the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed scheme.
The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively
protect the security of blockchain offline transactions and
improve the utilities of EVs, compared with other conven-
tional schemes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the related works. Section III introduces the system
model of UAV assisted blockchain offline transaction of V2V
charging in post-disaster vehicular networks. In Section IV,
the blockchain offline transactions among EVs is presented.
The Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is formulated in
Section V. In Section VI, we provide and analyze the simulation
results. Finally, in Section VII, we conclude the paper.

II. RELATED WORK
A. UAV-Aided Disaster Rescue in Vehicular Networks
A number of works have been studied about the UAVs aided
disaster rescue in vehicular networks. Dong et al. [32] use several
neural networks, such as YOLOV3, YOLOV3-MobileNetV1,
and YOLOV3-MobileNetV3 to train the UAVs based survivor
detection models. The optimal points based on the sensitivity
of the convolutional layer are founded to decrease the compu-
tation complexity, which can balance the inference time and
accuracy. Su et al. [17] propose a UAV-aided data sharing
framework for disaster rescue based on lightweight vehicular
blockchain, which can effectively promote high-quality data
sharing. Demiane et al. [33] consider the situation that the com-
munication infrastructures are broken. Through the seamless
collection of the received signal strength indicators, UAVs are
utilized to search survivors by accurately planning the trajectory.
Du et al. [34] study the routing protocol in UAV-assisted vehicu-
lar networks. Chen et al. [35] investigate the age of information
aware resource management in UAV-assisted systems. Both of
the two schemes are delay-tolerant which can effectively reduce
the network ahead or energy consumption. Wang et al. [36]
propose a UAV-assisted relay transmission scheme through com-
putation offloading which can provide jamming to malicious
nodes. However, these works ignore the privacy of nodes when
cellular links cannot be connected. Different from these works,
our work uses the rescuing UAVs to be the verifiers in the
blockchain offline transactions in the proposed V2V charging
framework, which can promote the security of blockchain offline
channels.
B. Blockchain Transactions Based on Offline Channels
There are a large body of works on blockchain offline transac-
tions in recent years. Elkhalil et al. [37] present a blockchain on-
line/offline signcryption of heterogeneous systems to protect the
information interaction between the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
and internet servers, which can reduce the computational cost
and energy consumption for more than 60 %. Thakur et al. [26]
propose a decentralized social Internet of Things (SIoT) plat-
form, in which the devices can only perform transactions with
their neighbors. Such platform is privacy-preserving and can be
applied into large-scale networks. Tochner et al. [27] present
an off-chain transaction scheme which can identify and analyze
denial of service attack based on attracting route. Kraft et al. [38]
introduce the new protocol for off-chain interactions of players
in private games, which can be performed without the participant
of public blockchain to protect the privacy of the players in the
game. However, the above works are weak in addressing the
deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks in our pro-
posed blockchain offline transactions for V2V charging among
EVs since there lacks of verifier in the transactions. By contrast,
this paper focuses on addressing above problems.
C. Incentive Schemes in Vehicular Networks
There also exist plenty of works focus on the incen-
tive schemes to encourage selfish users in the wireless
communication networks. Xiong et al. [39] propose a data
forwarding incentive scheme in the social networks based on
Fig. 2. UAV assisted blockchain offline transaction of V2V charging in post-
disaster vehicular networks.
the equivalent exchange, which abstracts the message exchange
as a transaction model. In this way, the delivery ratio of messages
can be improved. To promise the trusted communication in
vehicular networks, Wang et al. [40] present a reputation based
incentive model to solve the security and efficiency issues of
the consensus protocols in blockchain. Such model can encour-
age both noemal and abnormal nodes to participate in good
behaviors. Lai et al. [41] introduce an incentive scheme to
motivate autonomous vehicles to execute sensing tasks in order
to update the real-time map, from which the optimal profits of
the scheme can be achieved while ensuring the data reliability
sensed by the autonomous vehicles. To realize a more energy
efficient travel and mobility decisions in the transportation sys-
tems, Xiong et al. [42] design an incentive based model by
integrating behavioral modeling, which can realize significant
energy saving. As the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
study the incentive scheme in the blockchain offline transactions
among EVs.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
Fig. 2 represents the UAV assisted blockchain offline trans-
action of V2V charging in post-disaster vehicular networks. We
first propose the network model, followed by the motion model,
communication model and the V2V charging model. Table I
summarizes the key parameters utilized in this work.
A. Network Model
In the post-disaster vehicular networks where the road infras-
tructures are broken, the electrical power system and the cellular
networks are paralyzed. A set of UAVsU = {1, 2, . . ., u, . . ., U}
are deployed by the government after the disaster happened.
The UAVs will execute various tasks such as detection, sens-
ing, data collecting, life searching, etc. A set of charging EVs
C = {1, 2, . . ., c, . . ., C} is in urgent need of charging since the
charging station is shut down. Another set of discharging EVs
D = {1, 2, . . ., d, . . ., D} that have redundant power can provide
it to such EVs by V2V charging. Suppose all the charging
EVs in set C and discharging EVs in set D have joined the

blockchain network before the disaster. The process of proposed
UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions for V2V charging
is as follows:
� The charging EV c and discharging EV d make a deal of
V2V charging through Stackelberg game at time slot t,
an HTLC HTLCc,d is created by establishing an offline
transaction channel.
� UAV u in the communication range of EV c and d is chosen
to be the verifier of such transaction, the HTLC HTLCc,d
and the assertion of the transaction asstc will be forwarded
to u.
� UAVs will supervise the assertions of transactions, i.e.,
they will detect and punish malicious EVs by executing
Algorithm 1.
� Once the assertion is verified authentic, u will broadcast
the offline transaction once flying back to the area with
communication network connection. After the consensus
of such transaction is concluded by other blockchain nodes,
the transaction will be added to the blockchain, and the
account information of the charging EV c and discharging
EV d will be updated.
B. Motion Model
The set of UAVs U = {1, 2, . . ., u, . . ., U} are deployed to
execute the sensing tasks for the disaster rescuing as well
as to communicate with the ground nodes through A2G link
(In this paper, we only consider the situation that UAVs com-
municate with EVs to assist the verification and broadcasting of
blockchain offline transactions among EVs). To maximize the
utilization of UAVs and reduce the deployment cost, each UAV is
responsible for a specific area and the responsible areas of them
do not overlap each other. UAVs are equipped with sensors with
the maximum sensing angle α to execute sensing tasks. At time
slot t, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system of the
location of UAV u is denoted as Lt

over, let D be the maximum transmission distance of A2G link,

The average velocity of EVs in UAV u’s coverage is denoted
by v. According to the study in [43], the number of EVs in
the coverage of UAV u is considered to follow the Possion
distribution. In this way, the number of EVs arriving at the
coverage of UAV u in each time slot can be denoted as

each time slot can be updated by

C. Communication Model
The wireless channel of A2G link between the UAV and EV
is dominated by the line-of-sight (LoS) link [44]. The channel

where κ is the channel gain associated with a unit reference
distance.dtu,i is the Euclidean distance between UAVu and EV i.
ς > 1 is the path loss exponent of LoS link.
According to the Shannon bound, the uplink transmission rate
between UAV u and EV i at time slot t can be modeled as

, (6)
where εtu,i is the allocated spectrum bandwidth between UAV u
and EV i at time slot t. pu denotes the transmit power of UAV u.
τ 2 is the power spectrum density of noise.
D. V2V Charging Model
V2V charging is critical in post-disaster vehicular networks
for the reason that in post-disaster, EVs that urgently need to
charge may face with the charging problem because of the
broken of charging station. The emergency power is hard to
be transmitted from the outside world to such area since the
road to the area from the outside world was cut off. In this
way, V2V charging is an appropriate solution, which uses the
Bi-directional DC-DC converters in V2V technology for energy
transfer between two electric vehicles (EVs) [45], [46]. EVs with
urgent need of charging can maintain the continuation of the
journey. Besides, EVs with redundant power can obtain profits
by charging other EVs.
At time slot t, the charging EV c will announce the power
quantity requirement qtc,d to discharging EV d, which satisfies
0 ≤ qtc,d ≤ min
(

, (7)
where Qt
c and Qt
d denote the power quantity of EV c and d,
respectively. Qmax
c is the total battery capacity of EV c. Qmin
d is
the reservation power quantity that d keeps for itself. The state
of charge (SoC) is used to denote the ratio of the remaining
capacity of a battery to its fully charged state. SoC = 0 denotes
that the battery is fully discharged, and SoC = 1 denotes that
the battery is fully charged. The SoC of the charging EV c and
discharging EV d in time slot t+ 1 (i.e., after the V2V charging
between c and d) can be depicted as⎧⎨

IV. BLOCKCHAIN OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS AMONG EVS
In the above disaster environment, we consider the energy
transaction using blockchain offline channel between the charg-
ing EV c and discharging EV d.
A. Trust Based Deposits in Blockchain Offline Transactions
We use Bitcoin network that uses the online digital
cryptographic currency to support the transactions in the
blockchain [47], [48]. For any blockchain user who wants to use
the blockchain offline channel, a specific amount of deposits
should be locked in the user’s online account. In this paper,
we adopt the time-locked deposits which can promise that the
corresponding blockchain users are unable to access the funds
in the deposits until a predefined expiry time.
Suppose that the charging EV c has created a deposit with the
amount of bitcoins Bc. To avoid malicious EV who repudiates
a debt, we restrict the amount of bitcoins the EV can use in its
account, which is denoted by Bc. In this case, the amount of
bitcoins that EV c can use in the blockchain offline transactions
cannot exceed Bc, and we have
Bc = Bcςc, (10)
where ςc is the trust value of EV c, which varies from [0, 1]. ςc =
1 means that EV c is fully trusted. On the contrary, ςc = 0 means
that EV c is malicious. The trust value of an EV is related to its
behaviors in the interactions with others, and each EV has a table

XING et al.: UAVS-AIDED DELAY-TOLERANT BLOCKCHAIN SECURE OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS IN POST-DISASTER VEHICULAR NETWORKS 12035
of other EVs’ trust values, which updates ordinarily [49]. Due to
space limitations, this paper does not focus on the design of EV’s
trust value. The expiry time of such deposit is Tc, which is high
enough to promise that the deposit would not lose efficacy until
the verification and generation of new blocks are completed.
According to [50], such deposit can be locked and protected
by the Bitcoin script command CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
Specifically, EV c sends the amount of bitcoinsBc to the Bitcoin
network, and following script will be executed:
Tc + ι CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
PUc CHECKSIG
Here the command CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP can
ensure that the deposit is not spendable until the predefined
expiry time, ι is a safety margin. The command CHECKSIG
ensures that only the offline transactions signed by the public
key PUc of c can spend the deposit.
B. Blockchain Offline Channels
The blockchain offline channel established between the charg-
ing EV c and discharging EV d have the following advantages:
On one hand, once the channel is established, the transaction
can be completed although both the two parties are offline. On
the other hand, both EV c and EV d do not have to wait for
the confirmation of transaction. To protect the profits of the
transaction parties, HTLC is created between the charging EV c
and discharging EV d. The core technology of HTLC is that both
parties in the transaction need to enforce the contract transaction
within the contract time [51]. The process of blockchain offline
transaction between EVs c and d are as follows:
� Creating offline channel: Both EV c and d have the de-
posit addresses ADDc and ADDd, respectively. They will
exchange their deposit addresses and sign each other’s
address to establish an offline channel between the two
addresses.
� HTLC creation between EV c and d: First, input the avail-
able amount of bitcoins Bt
c in the deposit account of charg-
ing EV c to the HTLC established between EV c and d,
i.e., HTLCc,d. Here t is the current time slot. Second, the
discharging EV d creates a random keyRd and correspond-
ing Hash value Hd, EV d will send Hd to EV c. Third, the
transaction is concluded between EV c and d, i.e., a specific
amount of bitcoins Bt
c,d will be transferred from ADDc to
ADDd at time slotTc,d, whereTc,d = t < Tc. After the of-
fline transaction is broadcasted to the online blockchain, the
above transmission process will be executed automatically
if EV c does not claim objection before Tc,d by producing
Rd.
� Closing offline channel: The offline channel is closed once
HTLCc,d is broadcasted to the online blockchain. If the
offline channel cannot be closed before time Tc,d, EV c can
claim the amount of bitcoins Bt
c,d.
C. Security Issues to the Blockchain Offline Channels
The blockchain offline channel between EV c and d may face
with the following security problems:
� Forged deposit address: Since both EV c and d are offline,
it is hard for the discharging EV d to verify the authenticity
of EV c’s deposit address. In this way, a malicious charg-
ing EV may forge a fake deposit address to participate a
large amount of blockchain offline transactions which will
impact the benefits of other normal users.
� Double-spending attack: A charging EV has a true deposit
address, however, it is speculative in the blockchain offline
transactions, which means that it may forge the current
available amount of bitcoins in the deposit account. In this
way, it can buy different merchandises with the same sum
of bitcoins.
D. UAVs-Aided Penalty Algorithm with Accountable
Assertions
Accountable assertions in the blockchain offline channels
allow the participants to assert statements in order to account for
the conflicts. Specifically, a charging EV will create a statement
that attach to the HTLC about each offline transaction. Such
statement contains the available amount of bitcoins in the deposit
account before and after the transaction, respectively. If two
statements of a charging EV are detected conflict, it will be
punished by extracting all the bitcoins from its deposit account.
In this paper, we propose a UAVs-aided penalty algorithm with
accountable assertions, as shown in Algorithm 1. The complex-
ity of Algorithm 1 isT (n) = O(n · |C|), wheren is is the number
of all time slots, and |C| is the number of charging EVs.
To design the algorithm, we present the following assumption:
all UAVs deployed to the post-disaster vehicular networks have
obtained the latest information about the deposits of EVs in such
area from the online network, i.e., the first assertion stated by
an EV will not be conflict to the initial information that UAVs
obtain. Based on the assumption and the definition in [52], the
accountable assertions of the blockchain offline channels in this
paper can be defined as follows:
Definition 1: The accountable assertions contain the gener-
ation of keys, the assertion of charging EV, the verification of
UAV, the extraction of malicious EV’s deposit:
� Generation of keys: Before state assertion, the charging
EV c will generate the keys for the verification, denoted by
Gen(c) → (PUc, PRc). PUc and PRc denote the public
key and private key of c, respectively. It is noted that for
each public key, there is only one private key correspond
to it.
� Assertion of charging EV: After the blockchain offline
transaction with discharging EV d, EV c will state an
assertion attached to the HTLC about the transaction. The
assertion is denoted by
asstc = Ass
(
PRc, HTLCc,d, sta
t
c
)
, (11)
where statc = (Bt
c, B
t
c,d) is the statement to the available
amount of bitcoins in EV c’s deposit account before and
after the transaction, respectively. The assertion will return
to the output asstc.
� Verification of UAVs: EV c and d will ask UAV u in their
communication range for verification. By using the public

key PUc provided by EV c, UAV will verify the validity
of asstc, denoted by
vertu,c = V er
(
PUc, ass
t
c, HTLCc,d, sta
t
c
)
. (12)
Specifically, UAV u will verify the authenticity of keys,
statements, etc. If the assertion is verified validity, the
verification will return to 1, i.e., vertu,c = 1. Otherwise,
we have vertu,c = 0.
� Extract of malicious EV’s deposit: UAV uwill share vertu,c
with other UAVs in the post-disaster vehicular networks.
Then, all statements of EV c will be compared. For ex-
ample, statc = (Bt
c, B
t
c,d) and stat
′
c = (Bt′
c , B
t′
c,d′) are two
adjacent statements of EV c in two transactions, i.e., t′ > t,
and there is no transaction between time slot t to t′. If
Bt′
c > Bt
c,d, a conflict is generated. UAVs in the network
will inform other EVs to refuse the transaction with EV c.
Moreover, once return to the area with cellular connection,
UAVs will execute the extraction process to extract the
private key of EV c, furthermore, extract all the bitcoins in
c’s deposit account. The extraction process can be denoted
as:
PRc = Ext
(
PUc, ass
t
c, ass
t′
c , HTLCc,d,
HTLCc,d′ , statc, sta
t′
c
)
. (13)
With the UAVs-aided penalty algorithm, the above security
issues can be well addressed. On one hand, attacker with a forged
deposit account will be recognized by UAVs since they carry
the deposit information of users in the post-disaster vehicular
networks. On the other hand, it is not worth to perform double-
spending attack for a speculative EV because such attack will
be detected and the EV will be punished by extracting all the
bitcoins in its deposit account.
V. TRANSACTION OPTIMIZATION AMONG EVS
In the offline transaction between charging EV and discharg-
ing EV, both of them aim to maximize their profits, the discharg-
ing EV wants the charging EV to buy more power to obtain
more profits, and the charging EV wants the discharging EV to
decrease the price of charging. Moreover, the transmission loss
of V2V charging will effect the quality of experience (QoE)
of charging EV. Therefore, there is a competition between the
charging EV and discharging EV. In this section, we formulate
the competition between the charging EV and discharging EV
as a Stackelberg game to analyze the optimal strategies and
maximize the utilities for them.
A. Utility Functions
We first introduce the utility function of the charging EV. As
for EV c who wants to buy the power of EV d at time slot t, the
utility of EV c at time slot t can be obtained by
Φt
c = St
c,d − P t
c,d, (14)
where St
c,d is the satisfaction of charging EV c with the quantity
of charging power to the quantity it demands, which can be

where β is the satisfaction parameter of power quantity, and qtc,d
is the power quantity that EV c wants to buy from EV d. P t
c,d is
the total charging price that EV c should pay for EV d, which is
denoted by
P t
c,d = γptc,dq
t
c,d, (16)
wherepc,d is the unit charging price, andγ is the price adjustment
parameter. Since the blockchain transaction is performed offline,
the discharging EV d demands the verifier to promise it can
obtain the bitcoins in the transaction. Therefore, the utility of
discharging EV is related to the price it can obtain from charging
EV c, the transmission cost of V2V charging, and the price it
should pay for the verifier, the utility function of EV d can be
obtained by

where θ is the adjustment parameter, and ςd is the trust value
of discharging EV d. Λu
c,d is the data size of HTLC produced
between EV c and d. In this paper, we suppose Λu
c,d is a fixed
value. Moreover, since EV c and d are in the same place, we
haveϕt
u,c = ϕt
u,d. To simplify the computing, we will uniformly
adopt ϕt
u,c in what follows.
F t
d is the transmission cost of V2V charging between the
charging EV c and discharging EV d, which can be obtained
by

qtc,d, (19)
whereω is the adjustment parameter to the cost. δc,d is the power
transmission loss of the V2V charging between c and d defined
in Section III-D.
B. Stackelberg Game Analysis
Based on the utility functions of the charging EV c and
discharging EV d, the offline transaction between EV c and
d can be formulated as a Stackelberg game denoted by G =
{(qtc,d, ptc,d); (Φt
c,Φ
t
d)}. Both of the two players in the Stack-
elberg game aim to maximize their utilities by selecting the
optimal strategies. Specifically, as the leader in the Stackelberg
game, the discharging EVd determines the optimal unit charging
price ptc,d to maximize its utility. Moreover, the charging EV
c, as the follower in the Stackelberg game, chooses the power
quantity buying from EV d to maximize its utility. It is noted
that although their exist a leader and follower in the game, the
strategies of the two participants are made at the same time to
avoid the first-mover advantage. In this way, the following two
optimization problems of the charging EV c and discharging EV
d are formulated as follows.
Problem 1: The maximization problem for the utility of EV
c can be denoted by
max
qtc,d
Φt
c = St

Problem 2: The maximization problem for the utility of EV
d can be denoted by

Φt
d = P t
c,d − Pu
c,d − F t
d
s.t. ptc,d ≥ 0, Qt
d > Qmin
d . (21)
The goal of game G is to find a Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE),
denoted by (qt∗c,d, p
t∗
c,d). In such SE point, none of the two players
has the possibility to deviate from the equilibrium. To find the
SE, following condition should be satisfied:
Φt
c

qt∗c,d, p

c,d
) ≥ Φt

d
(
qt∗c,d, p
t∗
c,d
) ≥ Φt
d
(
qt∗c,d, p
t
c,d
)
. (23)
In the Stackelberg game, the game parameters are public for
the two participants. To obtain the SE of game G, the backward
induction method is adopted to analyze such game. Specifically,
the strategy of the follower, i.e., the charging EV c, is analyzed
first. After determining the optimal transaction power quantity
for EV c, the optimal unit power price by EV d is then decided
by analyzing the strategy of the leader, i.e., the discharging
EV d.
The optimal strategy of the charging EV: We first analyze the
optimal decision of the charging EV c, the utility function of EV
c at time slot t can be rewritten by

Since

∂qtc,d
is a monotonic decreasing function, the
values of (29) and (30) will effect the position of extreme point

that different values of ptc,d will cause different distributions of
the extreme point.
a) If the unit charging price is high enough, i.e., ptc,d ≥ βk

we have

The optimal strategy of the discharging EV: Next, we analyze
the optimal strategy of the discharging EV d, based on Theorem
1, we will consider the following three cases.
Case 1: High pricing by the discharging EV d, i.e., for

Case 2: Low pricing by the discharging EV d, i.e., for 0 ≤

function of EV d in this case can be rewritten by

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the simulation setup is first introduced, fol-
lowed by the simulation results and discussions to verify the
efficiency of the proposed scheme.
A. Simulation Setup
In the evaluation scenario, we consider a post-disaster ve-
hicular network of 200 square kilometers. Since only some of
the obstacles on arterial roads have been cleared, we consider
the average velocity of EVs in such area as a low value, i.e.,
30 km/h. The number of UAVs deployed to the area is between
50 and 200, and the number of EVs in each UAV’s coverage nt
u
is between 5 and 20. The remaining power quantity Qt
c of the
charging EV at time slot t is changed between 1 and 5 kWh,
where the total battery capacity of EV is set as 30 kWh. The
power transmission loss of V2V charging changes between 1 %
and 10 % [46]. The Euclidean distance between UAV and EV
is randomly distributed between 5 m and 25 m, and the flying
altitude of UAV is set as 5 m [53]. The channel gain associated
with the reference distance of 3 m is set as 9.7 × 10−4, and the
power spectrum density of noise is set as 10 W/Hz [54]. The
setting of other parameters is based on [1]. In a nutshell, the
parameters used in the simulations are summarized in Table II.
To show the superiority of the proposed UAVs-aided penalty
algorithm (UAPA) in detecting attacks, we compare the UAPA
with other two detection schemes, i.e., the verifiable random
sortition algorithm (VRSA) and none-verifier scheme (NVS).
� VRSA [55]: In this algorithm, the EVs with high trust
values are selected as verifiers to verify the effectiveness
of transactions and exchange assertions.
� NVS [52]: No verifiers are selected in this scheme, the
discharging EVs will hold the assertions and exchange
them with other discharging EVs.
TABLE II
SIMULATION PARAMETERS
Fig. 3. Detection rate of attacks vs. ratio of malicious EVs, in UAPA with
different number of UAVs.
Moreover, to verify the feasibility of the proposed incentive
scheme, we employ the following two conventional schemes for
comparisons.
� Random scheme: In this scheme, the discharging EV se-
lects a random unit charging price and the charging EV
randomly determines the charging quantity of power.
� Auction scheme [56]: In this scheme, a number of EVs will
compete with each other by the auction game, the EV that
provides the lowest unit charging price is selected as the
discharging EV, and the charging EV randomly decides the
charging quantity of power.
B. Performance Comparison
In this subsection, we first evaluate the performance of the
proposed UAPA in detecting attacks with different ratio of ma-
licious EVs, as shown in Fig. 3. The number of UAVs deployed
in the post-disaster vehicular networks is changed from 50,
100 and 150. We can see from Fig. 3 that with the density of
UAVs in the area increases, i.e., the increase of the number of
UAVs, the detection rate of attacks increases. This is because
when the density of UAVs is low, the probability of a UAV to
meet another UAV to exchange the assertions is low. In this

way, some attacks cannot be detected due to the difficulty in
forwarding information. The results also show that when the
ratio of malicious EVs is lower than 50 %, the detection rate is
high, which proves the effectiveness of UAPA since it is almost
impossible for the situation that more than half of the users are
malicious.
Accordingly, we compare UAPA with other two detection
schemes, i.e., VRSA and NVS, the comparison results are shown
in Fig. 4, both the UAPA and VRSA perform high detection
rate of attacks when the ratio of malicious EVs is lower than
50 %, while the performance of NVS is bad. The reason is
that NVS faces with the collusion attacks between EVs when
exchanging assertions. UAPA and VRSA can avoid such attacks
since verifiers in VRSA are randomly selected, and verifiers
in UAPA (i.e., UAVs) are trustworthy. Although both the three
schemes are ineffective when the ratio of malicious EVs is higher
than 70 %, the chance of such circumstance happening in reality
is very slim.
Since both UAPA and VRSA can get good performance in
detecting attacks, we compare the detection efficiency of the two

algorithms, as shown in Fig. 5. We can see from the comparison
results that no matter the number of verifiers is low or high,
the average delay of attacks detection of VRS is much higher
than UAPA. This is because that UAVs are more flexible when
moving, and compared with the air-to-air communications, the
V2V communication links are easy to be blocked by buildings,
which will effect the information forwarding efficiency.
Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate the comparison results between the
proposed incentive scheme and other two conventional incen-
tive schemes. Fig. 6 shows the utility of the charging EV
with different quantity of charging power. With the increase
of Qt
c, the utilities of charging EV in both the three schemes
increase. The reason is that a higher remaining power quantity
means the EV has more patience to wait for a better charging
scheme. In addition, the proposed scheme can obtain the highest
utility because in the random scheme, the price and quantity
are determined randomly which is not the optimal choice, and
in the auction scheme, the auction will consume the patience

(i.e., Qt
c) of charging EV when waiting for EVs to join the
auction. Fig. 7 depicts the utility of discharging EV with different
power transmission loss. The lower power transmission loss
of the discharging EV will obtain higher utility for it in both
the three schemes. And the proposed scheme can obtain the
highest utility for the discharging EV, the reason is the same as
above-mentioned.
Fig. 8 depicts the unit charging price for the charging EV in
different power quantity of it, while its trust value is changed
from 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. From the results, we can see that an
EV with higher trust value can obtain charging service with a
lower unit charging price. In this way, EVs in the networks are
encouraged to behave more honestly and actively to improve
their trust values. Moreover, a charging EV with higher surplus
power quantity will obtain a higher unit charging price, for the
reason that the power quantity requirement announced by the
charging EV is lower in such case, which is not economic for
the discharging EV because of the power transmission loss.
Therefore, the discharging EV will improve the unit charging
price to enhance its utility.
Fig. 9 illustrates the verifying price that the discharging EV
should pay for the selected UAV in different distance between
them, while the trust value of the discharging EV is changed from
0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. The results show that a lower distance between
UAV and the discharging EV will lead to a lower verifying price,
and the higher trust value of discharging EV is, the lower the
verifying price is. The reason is similar to the above results. In
this way, the EVs are motivated to improve their trust values to
obtain a lower verifying price in the verifying process of V2V
charging, and to obtain a higher utility.
Fig. 10 shows the utility of discharging EV in different dis-
tance between the EV and UAV, and in different number of EVs
in a UAVs coverage. On one hand, a higher distance between
the EV and UAV means a higher A2G communication overhead.
On the other hand, a higher number of EVs in a UAVs coverage

between the UAV and discharging EV, and trust value of discharging EV.
Fig. 10. Utility of the discharging EV in different distance between the EV
and UAV, and different number of EVs in a UAV’s coverage.
means a higher load of the UAV. Thus, both of the two conditions
will produce a higher verification price, which will decrease the
utility of discharging EV.
VII. CONCLUSION
Applying the blockchain in UAV networks represents a pop-
ular and fundamental framework to provision data security.
However, due to the dynamics, interferences and intermittent
connections of nodes, timely and reliable synchronization of
transactions to the blockchain networks can be infeasible, lead-
ing to potential security threats. The issue has been neglected
in literature. While establishing blockchain offline transaction
framework by leveraging the HTLC in UAV networks, this paper
addresses the issue from two aspects. First, considering the secu-
rity demand, a UAVs-aided penalty algorithm with accountable
assertions has been designed, from which the deposit forging
attacks and double-spending attacks can be avoided. Second,
due to the selfishness of users, an incentive scheme based on

Stackelberg game has been formulated between the charging
and discharging EVs, through which the optimal deposits change
can be obtained in the HTLC among EVs. Moreover, simulation
results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of
proposed scheme. For the future work, we will further consider
the utility of UAV by analyzing the interactions between the
UAV and the charging, discharging EVs. We also consider the
artificial intelligence (AI) technology such as deep learning in
analyzing characteristic of the accountable assertions to detect
attacks in the blockchain offline transactions.
