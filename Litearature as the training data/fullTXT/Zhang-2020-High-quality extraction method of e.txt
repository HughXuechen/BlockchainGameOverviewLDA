1 Introduction
Since the start of IT informatization construction in education departments, education
data have shown explosive growth, accumulated for so many years, formed a large
amount of data already, and naturally formed “education big data”. The core goal of
data governance is to sort out and standardize education data, solve possible problems,
and establish unified, real-time and accurate authoritative data resources for all depart-
ments and functional units to share. This paper studies the high-quality extraction model
of education resources, brings the national advantageous education resources into the
dispatching scope, and combines the information fusion and big data analysis technol-

design of related education resources. In the high-quality extraction and scheme design
of education resources, the dispatching model design is the key. The statistical analysis
model of high-quality extraction of education resources is established. Combined with
fuzzy information fusion and optimization method, the operational research analysis
theory [1] is adopted to carry out the high-quality extraction and game planning design
of education resources [3]. This paper proposes a high-quality extraction scheme of
education resources based on block chain trusted big data. Firstly, a spatial distributed
resource scheduling model is adopted to design a mathematical model for high-quality
extraction of education resources. Secondly, an optimal optimization parameter design
for high-quality extraction of education resources is carried out. Combining with the
concentration of block chain trusted big data distribution information, the fitness level
and equilibrium level of high-quality extraction of education resources are analyzed. The
root game equilibrium optimization algorithm realizes the optimization of high-quality
extraction of education resources. Finally, the simulation test analysis shows the superior
performance of the method in improving the high-quality extraction ability of education
resources [4].
2 Mathematical Model and Parameter Analysis for High Quality
Extraction of Education Resources
2.1 High Quality Extraction Model of Education Resources
In order to realize the scheduling optimization of education resources, a mathematical
model design for high-quality extraction of education resources is carried out in combi-
nation with an adaptive optimization method [5]. A quadratic programming model for
high-quality extraction of education resources is established. The distribution center (i, j
= 0) using high-quality extraction of education resources has K (K = 1,…, K) schedul-
ing paths, N(i, j= 1,…, N) scheduling points, and the initial load capacity of each group
of education resources is Q.
Define the following variables and parameters: xkij =
{

gi: Required distribution quantity of education resources characteristic distribution
point i.
ui: Distribution service order of education resources characteristic distribution point

Using the model correlation variable analysis method, the multi-objective function
for high-quality extraction of education resources can be determined as follows:

As shown in the above formula, there are three optimization objectives for the high-
quality extraction of education resources [6]. By adopting a linear programming scheme,
the constraint conditions for obtaining the shortest high-quality extraction distance, the
lowest cost and the largest safety factor of education resources are as follows:

Where, xkij ∈ {0, 1}; yik ∈ {0, 1}; ui >0
Under the constraint conditions, the process of education resources distribution is
optimized. Ant colony spatial planning algorithm is adopted to obtain the education
resources scheduling scheme with K scheduling paths. Combined with the adaptive
optimization method, high-quality extraction and spatial planning design of education
resources are carried out [7].
2.2 Parameter Optimization for High Quality Extraction of Education Resources
The convergence judgment of the high-quality extraction process of education resources
is carried out by combining a linear programming scheme, a statistical analysis model
for high-quality extraction of education resources is established, emergency parameter
optimization design of education resources is carried out [8–10], the number of ants in
ant colonies for high-quality extraction of education resources is set to be m, the spatial
planning path distribution constraint parameter from the characteristic distribution point
I of education resources to the characteristic distribution point j of education resources
is ηij,
↔
d ij is taken, Indicates the shortest path from the feature distribution point I of

education resources to the feature distribution point J of education resources. Combined
with the intensity analysis of pheromone concentration, automatic optimization of high-
quality extraction of education resources is carried out. The spatial planning model for
high-quality extraction of education resources is obtained as follows:

In the above formula, allowedk(t) = (1, 2, . . . , n)− tabuk indicates the convenient
point for high-quality extraction of education resources. Ant K is allowed to select the
next point. Obtaining a search list tabuk (k = 1, 2,…, m) for high-quality extraction of
education resources, and obtaining a diversity space analytic function for high-quality

(9)
q0 ∈ (0, 1) is the spatial distribution constant for high-quality extraction of edu-
cation resources, and q is a random number between 0 and 1. When q > q0, the
optimization threshold j for high-quality extraction of education resources satisfies the
convergence condition [11], and the global information update formula for high-quality
extraction of education resources is as follows:
τij = (1 − ρ)τij + ρ	τ bestij , ρ ∈ (0, 1) (10)
	τ bestij = 1/Obest (11)
In the formula, Obest is the global optimal target value for current ants to perform
high-quality extraction of education resources. ρ is the pheromone concentration. After
obtaining the optimal solution for high-quality extraction of education resources by
combining ant colony optimization method, in the spatial distribution vector set [12],
the distribution center optimization parameters for high-quality extraction of education
resources are obtained as follows:
τij = (1 − ξ)τij + ξτ0, ξ ∈ (0, 1) (12)
In the formula, τ0 is constant, τ0 = 1/

thresholds. Based on the above analysis, a parameter optimizationmodel for high-quality
extraction of education resources is established to improve the optimal scheduling and
access capability of education resources [13].

to realize optimization design of high-quality extraction of education resources [14],
game control of high-quality extraction of education resources is carried out according
to the distribution relevance of block chain trusted big data, and the game model of

In the formula, τij(t) and pkij(t) respectively represent the pheromone intensity on
the connection line between node I and node j of high-quality extraction of education
resources at time t, and the conditional distribution probability of high-quality extrac-
tion of education resources represents the relative importance of ant k trajectory; ηij(t)

of ant K, taduk represents the pheromone concentration recorded by ant K for optimiza-
tion, set represents the ant colony variability of high-quality extraction of education
resources, and adopts ant colony optimization method to obtain the information amount

the pheromone intensity of education resources emergency, and k is constant. Accord-
ing to the above analysis, an ant colony optimization model for high-quality extraction
of education resources is established, and spatial planning and design are carried out
according to the ant colony optimization results [15].

of high-quality extraction of education resources is transformed into a Traveling Sales-
man Problems (TSP), according to TSP problem, the optimized planning model is as
follows:

quality extraction of resources is expressed, the game control for high-quality extraction
of education resources is carried out according to the association of trusted large data
distribution in the block chain, and the fitness level and equilibrium level for high-
quality extraction of education resources are analyzed in combination with the concen-
tration of trusted large data distribution information in the block chain. The algorithm
