Abstract—During the past few years, medical Internet-of-
Things devices have experienced a massive growth and they are
currently generating tremendous volumes of data every day,
which are highly valuable as they can be of great importance to
all stakeholders within the healthcare industry. In this context,
many blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to mit-
igate the siloed burden in different healthcare systems which
prevented achieving a patient-centric, transparent, and secure
data sharing. However, when multiple independent entities try
to share their data, trust is not necessarily guaranteed. The
scope of this paper is to explore the impact of verification
on the level of trust among the different entities of the
health data-trading system by proposing an evolutionary game
theoretic model. We also present the numerical analysis of
the evolution of trust in terms of different game parameters
adopted to evaluate their impact on eliminating malicious (i.e.,
untrustworthy) players from the system.
I. INTRODUCTION
medical Internet-of-Things (MIoT) has recently
emerged as a new wave of IoT technologies with
the main goal of supporting the e-healthcare industry by
enabling a closer and efficient medical care and diagnosis
to a larger population, precisely, for patients with chronic
diseases requiring long-term and day-to-day monitoring [1].
MIoT has proven its great potentiality in improving the over-
all care and delivery of healthcare services, however, one of
the major challenges faced by these systems is their lack of
open and cooperative data sharing. Even though there exist
a tremendous amount of medical sensor devices deployed
everywhere, they often only communicate with a centralized
cloud-based server and are bound to a single organization.
Moreover, health service providers are susceptible to share,
without consent, patients’ personal health data (PHD) with
other second care providers, big data analytics companies,
or cloud service providers [2].
In point of fact, the security and privacy of patients’
health data are two crucial aspects that need to be taken
into account while managing these data [3]. In this context,
several blockchain-based approaches have been designed to
meet these requirements, blockchain as a new emerging
technology, is seen as the appropriate solution for tackling
the challenges of sharing health data [4], [5]. However,
sharing PHD through a blockchain-based framework does
not always guarantee the credibility of these data, precisely
if participants are more incentivized to behave opportunisti-
cally, which motivates us to study trust within a blockchain-
based PHD-sharing framework from an evolutionary game
theoretic perspective.
In this paper, we first propose the design of our
blockchain-based health data trading framework, we then
use evolutionary game theory (EGT) to define a data-
trading trust model. EGT has been used widely to study
cooperative dilemma such as knowledge-sharing in supply
chain and blockchain mining [6], [7]. However, there exists
few research that has been on modeling trust [8], [9], not
to mention that studying trust within a blockchain-based
PHD-trading framework was seldom investigated. In our
proposed trust model, players can be either data generators
(i.e., patients) or data requestors (e.g., research institutions,
pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, etc.). Each
generator or requestor has the choice to be either trustworthy
or untrustworthy, leading to a game with four different
strategy profiles: trustworthy patient (TP), untrustworthy
patient (UP), trustworthy requestor (TR), and untrustworthy
requestor (UR). The main contributions of this paper are
summarized as the following:
1) We introduce the design of a secure blockchain-based
PHD-trading system for patients and health institutions.
2) We propose a trust model consisting of four types of
players and examine the development of trust in the so-
called health sharing market from an EGT perspective.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The related
work is discussed in Section II. In Section III, we introduce
the components of the proposed blockchain-based PHD-
trading framework. In Section IV, the proposed game model
is formulated with a theoretical and numerical analysis on

the evolution of trust. We then conclude this paper in Section
V.
II. RELATED WORK
The traditional centralized approach for managing health
data relying on the cloud computing paradigm has been
used for nearly a decade. For instance, Thilakanathan et al.
[10] presented a cloud-based platform which enables the
monitoring of patients by doctors through a secure sharing
of health data. In addition, the work in [11] utilized the
cloud computing paradigm for the collection, processing and
storage of health data, the proposed platform is assumed to
be fully trusted by all participants. However, this traditional
centralized approach for managing data suffers from some
limitations including its security vulnerabilities, such as
hijacking and distributed denial of service attacks, as well
as data breaches.
Meanwhile, blockchain has attracted the attention of many
researchers, precisely to decentralize the process of data
management in a health data sharing context. Fore instance,
to deal with the heterogeneity of health data, Kaur et
al. [4] combined blockchain and the cloud paradigm to
ensure a secure process of sharing health data without any
third parties. Furthermore, in [5] the authors proposed the
design of a role-based access control smart contract to
manage the access to the medical records in a decentralized,
transparent, and auditable manner. Nevertheless, practical
and trustworthy data trading models to build a healthcare
data trading market for patients and researchers are seldom
investigated.
III. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PERSONAL HEALTH
DATA-TRADING SYSTEM
With the volume of data generated from MIoT and body
sensors explosively increasing, it is quasi-impossible to rely
on cloud approaches for a secure storage and management
of all these data. In this regard, our proposed PHD-trading
system includes multiple local consortium blockchain plat-
forms distributed geographically and near the source of data,
Fig. 1 illustrates the system we propose which is composed
of the entities explained in the following subsections.
A. Patients
Patients in our proposed framework are individuals who
are willing to be part of the platform by contributing with
their own PHD generated from MIoT devices or body
sensors. For instance, if we take the scenario of a patient
monitoring his health in a smart home, this one is expected
to generate a huge amount of data (e.g., blood sugar level,
temperature, heart rate, weight, activity, etc.) that can be
leveraged in precision medicine to provide better health
services. In order to motivate patients, these ones can get
some rewards in the form of health tokens in case they
accomplished any improvement in terms of their health.
Fig 1 Blockchain-based health data trading system.
Thus, in the proposed PHD-trading system, patients play the
role of data generators and they have the right to either share
their data or not while taking into account the risk it might
indulge (i.e., privacy concerns, untrustworthy requestors)
and rewards.
B. Data Requestors
With the new emerging era of the big healthcare data,
pooling the shared PHD has a tremendous potentiality for
the improvement of patients’ well-being, anticipate epi-
demics outbreaks, acquire new insights, prevent diseases,
reduce the cost of health services, and ameliorate the con-
ditions of life as a whole. For instance, if we take the
scenario of a pharmaceutical company trying to improve its
products, it can track the overall performance of a patient
undergoing a certain treatment and see if there were any side
effects and measure the effectiveness of the treatment based
on analyzing the PHD generated by the patient using his
MIoT devices. Requestors are also responsible for rewarding
patients in order to encourage them to share more their data,
by considering PHD as the patients’ assets constituting a
sustainable and dynamic health data market.
C. Sealers
In our blockchain-based trading system, sealers work as
mining nodes to process the shared data, manage trading-
related activities, access control policies, provide closer
computing and artificial intelligence services. They are
managed by health authorities and use the proof-of-authority
consensus mechanism, which does not require any mining
but instead is based on authorized peers, hence, supporting
a high-speed communication between participants with no
computational overhead.

IV. EVOLUTIONARY TRUST STUDY OF THE
DATA-TRADING SYSTEM
The notion of trust is tremendously important as it is
the fundamental base of our social and human interactions,
ethics, culture and relationships, precisely when considering
managerial and trading decision-making [12]. The widely
known version of trust games revolves around the interac-
tion of a trustor and a trustee. Fundamentally, the game
represents a two-player game where the trustor (i.e., patient)
would generate his data to share it with the requestor. Later,
the trustee (i.e., data requestor) must analyze the data and
reward the patient based on his progress.
TABLE I Notations.
Symbol Definition
Rp,r Reward from being trustworthy for patient or requestor
Cp,r Payoff from cheating for patient or requestor
Lp,r Expected loss to patient or requestor
Pp,r Penalty for untrustworthy patient or requestor
fp,r Frequency of verification for patient or requestor
Vp,r Cost of verification for patient or requestor
A. Problem Formulation and Assumptions
In our proposed health data-trading blockchain-based
framework, patients and requestors are gaming with each
other most of the time. Precisely, patients are sharing their
monitored health signs in order to get some rewards from
the different data requestors part of the trading scheme, both
patients and requestors can decide to be either trustworthy
or untrustworthy. Obviously, trust within information shar-
ing is a continuous process impacted by the environment,
social norms, policies, and intercourses between patients
and data requestors, making trust an evolutionary process.
Hence, analyzing the factors influencing the spread of trust
within this PHD-trading population can be achieved after
the construction of the EGT model which is based on the
assumptions defined below:
1) Players: In our proposed model, we consider the case
of two agents gaming with each other, which are a patient
and a data requestor. The players are self-interested, with
symmetric information of each others’ strategy choices and
decide following a sequential order.
2) Space of strategies: Agents can pick from a strategy
space of [T, U], where T refers to being trustworthy and U
means the opposite.
3) Verification: In order to enforce trustworthiness we
assume there is a way to verify the credibility of each agent,
but this comes with a cost of verification Vp,r. Also, the
players don’t verify continuously at each round the behavior
of the other party but they do so based on a frequency
that we note as fp and fr. Since the proposed system
is blockchain-based and the state updates are stored on
the immutable data structure, this provides an avenue for
implementing the verification mechanism.
4) Parameters: The rest of notations and parameters used
in our model are detailed in Table I.
Based on the previous assumptions made and parameters
defined above, we can deduce that there exist four strategy
profiles that the players can choose: [T, T], [T, U], [U, T],
[U, U] and the utility matrix of the game is detailed in
Table.II.
TABLE II Payoff matrix.
GS TR UR
TP Rp − fpVp, −(1 − fp)LP − fpVp,
Rr − frVr (1 − fp)Cr − fpPr − frVr
UP (1−fr)Cp−frPp−fpVp, (1−fr)Cp−frPp−(1−fp)Lp−fpVp,
−(1 − fr)Lr − frVr (1−fp)Cr−fpPr−(1−fr)Lr−frVr
Based on Table.II, by setting the rate of trustworthy
requestors and trustworthy patients as x(t) = x and y(t) = y
respectively, with x, y ∈ [0, 1], we get the utility of a patient
with a strategy (T) as:
UP (T ) = x[Rp−fpVp]+(1−x)[−(1−fp)LP −fpVp] (1)
And the utility of a patient with a strategy (U) as:
UP (U) = x[(1 − fr)Cp − frPp − fpVp]
+ (1− x)[(1− fr)Cp − frPp − (1− fp)Lp − fpVp]
(2)
With (1) and (2), we can get the expected utility function
of a patient as:
UP = xyRp + (1− y)[(1− fr)Cp − frPp]
− (1 − x)(1 − fp)Lp − fpVp
(3)
Similarly, the utility functions of a requestor with a
trustworthy/untrustworthy strategies and the expected utility
are also obtained.
B. Evolutionary Equilibrium Analysis
Following the Malthusian dynamic equation [13], the
growth rate of a player’s (i.e., patient or requestor) trust-
worthiness is directly proportional to the difference between
the utility of a trustworthy strategy and the expected utility.
Hence, from (1) and (3), the RDE of a patient (noted later
as RDEP ) is expressed as:
dy
dt
= y(UP (T )−UP ) = y(1−y)[xRp−(1−fr)Cp+frPp]
(4)
Similarly, the RDE of a requestor (noted later as RDER)
is obtained. Thus, the optimal strategy choices of the players
are as follows:
x = 0, x = 1, y = y∗ =
(1− fp)Cr − fpPr
Rr
(5)
y = 0, y = 1, x = x∗ =
(1− fr)Cp − frPp
Rp
(6)
Hence, the local equilibrium points that exist are (0, 0),
(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), and (x∗, y∗). In order to analyze whether

(a) Case I. (c) Case III.(b) Case II.
Fig 2 Evolution path diagrams
a point is stable the Jacobian matrix [14] can be utilized,
which is defined as follows:
Mjac =
(
∂RDER(x)
∂x
∂RDER(x)
∂y
∂RDEP (y)
∂x
∂RDEP (y)
∂y
)
Based on the stability theorem, if the following conditions
Tr(Mjac) < 0 as well as Det(Mjac) > 0 are met,
the stability of the studied local equilibrium point can be
concluded, with Tr being the trace of the matrix Mjac and
Det the determinant.
For ease and without loss of generality, we assume that
Rp = Rr = R and so it goes for the rest of the parameters.
Hence, from (5) and (6), if R < (1−f)C−fP , then x∗ > 1
and y∗ > 1. Which is inconsistent with our assumption.
Hence, the only equilibrium points that exist are (0, 0), (0,
1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).
Case I: if fP < (1−f)C meaning that the penalty from
being untrustworthy is lower than the payoff from cheating,
the stability of the system equilibrium points is analyzed
in Table. III and the dynamic phase of evolution between
patients and requestors is shown in Fig. 2a. The results show
that regardless of the primary strategy profile choices made
by the players, the point (0, 0) is an evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS) meaning that the game will evolve to both
parties choosing the non-cooperative strategy U.
TABLE III Equilibrium points stability (Case I).
Equilibrium point Tr(Mjac) Det(Mjac) Local stability
(0, 0) - + ESS
(0, 1) + - Unstable
(1, 0) + - Unstable
(1, 1) + + Unstable
If R > (1− f)C − fP , then x∗ < 1 and y∗ < 1. Which
is consistent with our assumption. Hence, the equilibrium
points that exist are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), and (x∗,
y∗).
Case II: if fP < (1−f)C meaning that the penalty from
being untrustworthy is lower than the payoff from cheating,
the stability of the system equilibrium points is analyzed
in Table. IV, and the dynamic phase of evolution between
patients and requestors is shown in Fig. 2b. The results show
that when x∗ > 0 and y∗ < ((1 − fp)Cr − fpPr)/Rr,
whatever initial strategic choices made, the evolution of the
sharing game would lead to an untrustworthy population.
However, when x∗ > ((1− fr)Cp − frPp)/Rp and y∗ < 1
the game will evolve towards a trustworthy population.
TABLE IV Equilibrium points stability (Case II).
Equilibrium point Tr(Mjac) Det(Mjac) Local stability
(0, 0) - + ESS
(0, 1) + + Unstable
(1, 0) + + Unstable
(1, 1) - + ESS
(x∗, y∗) 0 - Saddle point
Case III: if fP > (1−f)C meaning that the penalty from
being untrustworthy is higher than the payoff from cheating,
the stability of the system equilibrium points is analyzed
in Table. V and the dynamic phase of evolution between
patients and requestors is shown in Fig. 2c. The analysis
shows that by setting the reward of being trustworthy higher
than the payoff of being untrustworthy and by setting the
penalty higher than the cheating payoff, the game will evolve
towards a trustworthy population as the players are more
incentivized to behave in a trusted manner.

C. Numerical Analysis
In order to validate the theoretical evolutionary path of
both strategy choices (i.e., trustworthy or untrustworthy) and

visualize how certain parameters of the game influence the
evolutionary stability, we utilized Python for the simulation
of the evolution process by giving a fixed value to each
parameter of the payoff matrix defined in Table. II as
follows: R = 20, C = 30, L = 10, P = 15, V = 5. Even
though we assigned the parameters in a random way, this has
no effect on the results of our simulations. We then further
discuss the impact of the frequency of verification as well
as the initial distribution of trustworthy players in particular
on the evolution of trust within the sharing population. For
ease and without loss of generality we opted to study the
symmetric case, hence, the evolution of x(t) (i.e., rate of
trustworthy requestors over time) is similar to y(t) (i.e., rate
of trustworthy patients).
In Fig. 3a we have set the initial distribution of requestors
as 80% TR vs 20% UR and the frequency of verification
under 0.22 which satisfies the fist case. Hence, even if
the initial population contains more trustworthy players the
game will evolve towards an untrustworthy population by
the end which verifies the theoretical results. In Fig. 3b
we fixed the value of the frequency of verification at 0.5
which satisfies the second case, and we evaluated the impact
of the initial population on the evolution of trust. If we
start with an initial distribution of requestors as 30% TR vs
70% UR the population will move towards an untrustworthy
behavior. However, if we start with a 50%/50% population,
trustworthy requestors will end up prevailing in the game.
Finally, Fig. 3c represents the evolution under the third case,
with a frequency of verification equal to 0.8 and even if we
only start the game with a trustworthy population equal to
10% the game will evolve in favor of trust, which matches
the theoretical results obtained.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the design of a blockchain-
based framework to guarantee a secure and auditable sharing
of health data generated from MIoT devices, which also
provides an efficient trading market for patients and data
requestors in order to promote better health care and data
analysis. We then studied trust within this framework from
an EGT angle, we defined theoretically the conditions under
which a trustworthy population would prevail in the long
run, and we validated the obtained results using simulations.
