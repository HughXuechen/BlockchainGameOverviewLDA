Abstract
We introduce economic research on blockchains and its recent advances. 
In particular, we highlight the (i) unifying concepts on blockchain as a 
decentralized consensus and its core benefits, (ii) equilibrium characteri-
zations and allegedly irreducible tensions among consensus formation, 
decentralization, and scalability, (iii) major issues including network 
security, overconcentration, energy consumption and sustainability, 
adoption, multi-party computation and encryption, smart contracting, 
and information distribution and aggregation, and (iv) future directions 
concerning blockchains and their applications such as informational 
and agency issues, as well as game-theoretical and mechanism design 
approaches to blockchain protocols.
Keywords: Bitcoin; Consensus protocol; Cryptocurrency; Distributed 
ledger; Smart contracts.

2 Information for Efficient Decision Making
1. Introduction
The advancement in technology has made us increasingly connected in 
this digital age. Also undeniable is the corresponding increase in the 
demand for peer-to-peer interactions that are instantaneous and open, 
which can transform how people work, consume, and invest. Some of the 
most valued companies in the world such as Amazon, Alibaba, and 
Facebook all connect dispersed users and product/service providers. They 
also give rise to the so-called “gig/sharing economy” wherein on-demand 
labor gets instantaneous payments instead of relying on long-term 
employment contracts that are confined by geography and legal 
jurisdictions.
Integral to this development is digitization of information, which can 
be broadly interpreted to include digitization of assets too because a digi-
tal asset such as a Bitcoin is in principle a string of numbers and alphabets 
(or 0s and 1s) after all. Because digitized information is non-rival and can 
be transferred, used, and reproduced almost costlessly, it transcends tradi-
tional boundaries of firms and organizations and physical locations, dras-
tically increasing the quantity and quality of economic activities and 
reshaping business organizations.
While digital technology helps overcome limits in offline markets, 
digitization alone is insufficient. While smartphones and online apps pro-
viding instant access to goods together with virtually unlimited access to 
wireless high-speed broadband connections all seem to exponentially 
grow connectivity and lower the cost of segmentation for many industries’ 
production processes (e.g., Fort, 2017), successful platforms and produc-
tion organizations still depend heavily on payment and contracting inno-
vations (e.g., Taobao and eBay) as the lack of trust among anonymous 
agents or in an open system is the key obstacle for economic exchanges.
Recently, instead of relying on financial systems that are often 
arranged around a series of centralized parties like banks and payments, 
clearing and settlement systems, blockchain-based cryptoapplications 
attempt to resolve the issue by creating the financial architecture for peer-
to-peer transactions and interactions and reorganizing society into a series 
of decentralized networks. By providing decentralized consensus, block-
chains allow peers distant from and potentially unknown to one another to 
interact, transact, and contract without relying on a single centralized 
trusted third party. It also holds the potential to better coordinate and 
organize oft-segmented individuals and groups, thus fully unleashing the

latent productivity hidden in traditional economies due to localized infor-
mation and geographical constraints.
Technically speaking, blockchain is just one of the many distributed 
ledger technologies. It first became popular due to the emergence of the 
cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It has since manifested itself in various other 
forms, often with the ability to store and execute computer programs. This 
gave rise to applications such as smart contracts, featuring payments trig-
gered by a tamperproof consensus of contingent outcomes and financing 
through initial coin offerings. Among many other applications, Maersk 
and IBM used blockchain for tracking and better logistics in freight ship-
ping and trade credit; Walmart also worked with IBM for supply chain 
delivery; Stellar and Ripple have revamped the payment and remittance 
system; Ant Financial implemented blockchain-based cross-border trans-
fers in 2018 and electronic receipts in medical insurance in 2019, among 
others (Luohan Academy, 2019). Blockchains have also found applica-
tions in the areas of healthcare and insurance (Yermack, 2017; Yue et al., 
2016; Raikwar et al., 2018). Media articles and research papers such as 
those by Chiu and Koeppl (2019), Cong and He (2018), and Reese (2017) 
contain other examples of blockchain applications. We neither repeat the 
existing and potential applications of the technology nor elaborate on the 
technical details that computer scientists have discussed extensively. 
Instead, we focus on the key economic issues brought forth by the tech-
nological innovations and associated applications.
A discussion of blockchain invariably appears incomplete without 
talking about cryptocurrencies and tokens. Indeed, there is as much novel 
economics in the use of cryptotokens as there is in the blockchain infra-
structure and architect. We leave it out for separate discussions for two 
reasons. First, we want to correct the misconception that cryptocurrency 
and blockchain are equivalents or interchangeable. Second, a fast-emerg-
ing literature studies cryptocurrencies and cryptotokens, either jointly 
with blockchain or independent of the technical aspects of decentralized 
ledgers. In some regard, cryptocurrencies and tokens are also closely 
related to the literature on monetary economics, banking, and platform 
economics. It is impossible to reproduce a complete list of relevant arti-
cles here and doing so would take too much focus away from our main 
topic. We therefore refer the readers to studies such as those by Cong et al. 
(2018b), Chod and Lyandres (2018), Liu and Tsyvinski (2018), Cong 
et al. (2019), Gan et al. (2019), Lyandres (2019) and the references 
therein for further discussion. In particular, the study by Halaburda and

Sarvary (2016) gives an excellent overview of digital currencies and that 
by Cong (2019) provides a concise introduction to the economics of 
tokens and digital currency.
Our paper is not meant to be a survey of research on blockchains. 
Instead, our goal is to first clarify from an economic perspective what 
blockchains are (or envisioned to be) and why they are (or would be) use-
ful and then introduce a generalized concept of desirable features together 
with a conjecture of their irreducible tension. We then highlight key eco-
nomic issues surrounding blockchains before pointing out future research 
directions and challenges to tackle in practice. For more comprehensive 
surveys, interested readers may consult Townsend (2019) for an insightful 
overview of DLTs; Hilary and Liu (2018) for a general survey of research 
on blockchain economics; Tschorsch and Scheuermann (2016) and Conti 
et al. (2018) for discussions on security privacy issues; Biais et al. (2019b) 
and Liu et al. (2019) for game-theoretical analyses on blockchains; and 
Halaburda and Haeringer (2018) for economic and computer science 
 studies specifically related to Bitcoin.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines 
the general concept of blockchain and explains its main advantages over 
traditional systems. Section 3 introduces protocol games and design 
before highlighting the three desirable features of blockchain design and 
the seemingly irreducible tension among them. Section 4 examines key 
economic issues surrounding the technology, such as network security, 
energy consumption, and adoption limitation, with a particular effort to 
underscore two hitherto underexplored information-related dimensions 
i.e., information distribution and aggregation in decentralized systems, as 
well as the innovation of permissioned blockchains in enabling better 
multi-party computation and information exchanges. Finally, Section 5 
summarizes promising future directions for research and for industry 
development.
2. Blockchain as Decentralized Consensus
To start to comprehend blockchain economics, one has to first understand 
the general definition of blockchains, their main functionalities and 
advantages, and the major tradeoffs in achieving all desirable features 
associated with it. Not surprisingly, the myriad definitions in popular 
media and emerging economic literature do not help. We aim to provide a

coherent version that facilitates our discussions on the key economic 
issues related to blockchains.
2.1. What is blockchain?
Technically speaking, blockchain is a distributed system that stores time-
ordered data in a continuously growing list of blocks. Each block contains 
information on transactions and business activities, and the entire network 
uses a consensus algorithm to reach an agreement on which block will be 
attached to the current recognized chain of blocks, thus the name 
“blockchain”.
The blockchain technology is a manifestation of the more general 
distributed ledger technology (DLT), which embodies the infrastructure 
and process for a network to generate a consensus record of state changes 
or updates to a synchronized ledger distributed across various nodes in the 
network. Another popular form of DLT is the directed acyclic graph 
(DAG), often considered to be a rival technology to and an enabler for 
blockchain. Unlike blockchains that organize records in an unalterable, 
chronological order, DAGs represent networks of individual records 
linked to multiple other transactions. In technical jargon, a blockchain is 
a linked list, whereas a DAG is a tree, branching out from one record to 
another, and so on.1 While the discussion to follow often applies equally 
to other DLTs, we encourage the readers to focus on blockchains for con-
creteness. In that sense, “blockchain” can be viewed as a general reference 
for systems of decentralized consensus.
Blockchains can be public (also referred to as open or permissionless), 
permissioned, or private. The distinction is more about who gets to partici-
pate in the consensus formation process, rather than the users of particular 
applications. Public blockchains typically allow any agent to potentially be 
a consensus recordkeeper via the protocol and randomization; permis-
sioned blockchains have a prespecified group of recordkeepers; and private 
blockchains retain their irreversibility and tamper resistance property, but 
are mostly proprietarily maintained. Most cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) 
1 DAG accommodates larger numbers of users and faster transaction times, but does not 
establish a strict ordering of transactions and would require additional layers of 
protocols.

are based on public blockchains, whereas many enterprise applications 
rely on permissioned/consortium blockchains.
Blockchain enthusiasts argue that the technology provides many func-
tions, such as secure data storage and anonymity. Because solutions to 
these problems are abundant outside of the blockchain space, the impact 
of blockchain along these dimensions, although material, is somewhat 
incidental. In our opinion, the core functionality of the technology lies in 
the provision of decentralized consensus. Consensus here refers to agree-
ments not only on transactions but also on protocols for conflict resolu-
tion, history of events, institutional memory, etc.
The concept of consensus is not alien to economic and social func-
tions. It is the informational basis for agents of divergent preferences and 
beliefs to agree on the states of the world or behave according to a com-
mon set of protocols. Its benefits for and empowerment of everyone 
 sharing and trusting the same ledger are apparent: Settlements in some 
cases no longer take days, lemons problems and frauds can be mitigated, 
and the list goes on. Traditionally, centralized parties such as courts, gov-
ernments, and notary agencies provide such consensus, but in a way that 
could be labor intensive, time consuming, and prone to tampering and 
monopoly power. Blockchains provide an alternative, decentralized way 
of generating consensus information. It is important to recognize that 
decentralization here entails both the way consensus is generated and the 
way it is distributed and stored. For example, Bitcoin mining under proof-
of-work generates consensus, and information about the newly appended 
block is also stored on multiple (if not all) nodes representing network 
participants’ computers.
All blockchains, to a large extent, aim to create an infrastructure for 
decentralized or multi-centered agents or institutions to interact and 
jointly record and maintain information, with no individual party exercis-
ing persistent market power or control. One defining feature of blockchain 
architectures is therefore their ability to allow decentralized recordkeepers 
to maintain a uniform view on the state of things and the order of events — 
a decentralized consensus (Cong and He, 2018). We should reckon that 
decentralization is a matter of degree. Public blockchains tend to be com-
pletely decentralized by freely admitting users and recordkeepers. In con-
trast, permissioned or consortium blockchains have a restricted set of 
recordkeepers and may have restrictions on who may use the blockchain 
or access information therein. Nevertheless, it could be more decentral-
ized than traditional systems such as individual banks.

A Brief Introduction to Blockchain Economics 7
In a broader sense, blockchains aim to provide a trusted system or 
environment for economic agents to interact. “Trusted” in computer sci-
ence means carrying out transactions in a fault-tolerant way. The consid-
eration of blockchain economics and its link with trust brings a whole 
new perspective. For example, a decentralized trustworthy system may 
allow better search and matching in storage sharing or world computing 
without high intermediary costs (Filecoin and Dfinity are among current 
attempts); it may also coordinate various interested parties without con-
cerns on who runs the show or whether a particular political/legal frame-
work has ulterior motives (Libra and Ethereum which do not belong to 
any particular country or company are some cases in point despite the 
fact that Facebook or Vitalik Buterin are taking a lead in the 
development).
2.2. Benefits of decentralization
If centralized systems such as governments and large IT firms have tradi-
tionally supplied trusted systems and digital platforms/exchanges, why do 
we need decentralized consensus in the first place? To this question, many 
articles provide a misleading or incomplete picture, overemphasizing 
transparency or anonymity. While Bitcoin is well-known for its anonymity 
and thus associations with illegal activities such as money laundering and 
drug dealing, anonymity is a design feature rather than a defining charac-
teristic of blockchains in general. We attempt to give a definitive answer 
and highlight the three core benefits of decentralization. Note that in many 
cases and applications, decentralization manifests itself in the form of 
multi-centers.
2.2.1. Preventing single point of failure
It is widely accepted that a decentralized system prevents or reduces what 
is called “single point of failure” (SPOF). SPOF is a part of a system that, 
upon failing, prevents the entire system from functioning. SPOFs are 
undesirable in any system requiring continuity and reliability, be it a busi-
ness practice or software application. By having irreversible records dis-
tributed to decentralized notes, blockchains in a sense help mitigate 
SPOFs because no single node’s failure is likely to disable the entire 
 network and consensus process.

8 Information for Efficient Decision Making
While this benefit seems to contradict the observed hacking of crypto 
exchanges and the DAO attack of a former decentralized autonomous 
organization, we remind the readers that these incidents happened to cen-
tralized wallets and accounts. If the system were truly decentralized and 
peer-to-peer, such massive failures would be less likely to occur even 
when a few nodes are hacked. In that regard, it is not whether a decentral-
ized system mitigates the problem of SPOF, but about whether a system 
is decentralized, a topic we visit in Sections 3 and 4.
Because hash-pointers give immutability (with time stamping) and 
tamper resistance, no single party can go back in history to change the 
records or the sequence of events. This is useful for maintaining a consist-
ent global consensus history, which can be used for contingency refer-
ences for smart contracting. There are costs though, as we point out in 
Sections 3 and 4. For one, storing duplicate copies of entire history of 
transactions could be costly. Decentralized consensus protocol may also 
entail excessive energy consumption.
More importantly, we argue that the concept of SPOFs should be 
more broadly interpreted. Beyond technical SPOF, such as the breakdown 
of a computer, or wiping out of corporate facilities due to natural disas-
ters, SPOF here can refer to economic incentives. For example, it is easier 
to bribe a single judge for a court case than bribing an entire panel of 
judges. Hack and theft of credit card data target a specific database or an 
individual. Facebook’s leakage of data to Cambridge Analytica and 
Google’s fine of 57 million euros for failing to comply with GDPR 
(https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-
fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/) are also examples of SPOF in 
business in which the action or negligence of a centralized platform leads 
to system wide debacles. Had the consensus process on how to handle 
data belonged to a decentralized set of agents, such violations may have 
been prevented by a majority of agents who are more sensitive to data 
privacy issues.
2.2.2. Reducing market power and enabling stakeholding
Another popular argument for adopting the blockchain technology centers 
around disintermediation. This is at best a misnomer. In fact, decentral-
ized systems could allow intermediaries to thrive because they also allow 
more efficient search and match for intermediaries with end customers. 
What people have in the back of their minds is that blockchain systems are

typically open, which allows easier entry and more competition to 
improve efficiency and reduce intermediary rent. Moreover, it could ena-
ble P2P transactions that would be infeasible under traditional systems 
and therefore filling in missing markets. This is a point Townsend (2019) 
belabors, for good reasons.
Another warranted clarification is that even though decentralized sys-
tems such as blockchains reduce market power, it is a matter of degree. 
It certainly does not imply that the market would be perfectly competitive. 
In fact, Cong et al. (2018) show that even mining pools enjoy some local 
monopoly. Similarly, while the openness nature of many blockchain sys-
tems would blur the boundary of legal jurisdictions or physical geography, 
it is most likely that regional regulations are still relevant (a case in point 
is the ban on cryptocurrency exchanges by China and South Korea). The 
relevant question is to what extent do they matter. More importantly, what 
is novel relative to traditional centralized systems is that the consensus 
mechanism (specifically node leader elections) leaves little room for any 
single party to have persistent market power or governance authority over 
time.
The reduction in market power concentration also reflects in a novel 
fashion on the consensus mechanism that existing studies and media arti-
cles rarely touch on. In many business-to-customer (B2C) businesses, 
consumers or platform users generate invaluable information and network 
externality that the business platforms tap without explicitly compensat-
ing the end users. For example, Facebook and Google monetize users’ 
social interactions and emails, yet it is often difficult for users, especially 
early adopters, to share the economic surplus of such business behemoths. 
Greater competition would lead businesses to seek alternative ways to 
attract users and early adopters.
Traditionally, a platform would provide tools to empower network 
participants. For example, Alibaba’s Tmall Innovation Center (TMIC) 
began in 2016 to help brands design products for consumers by utilizing

One novel way is to have users be stakeholders of the future prosper-
ity of the businesses or platforms. Blockchains enable a trusted way of 
distributing digitized securities or cryptotokens to early adopters and 
users, even when the distributing businesses are still little known.

This enables businesses to return value to consumers for the contributions 
they make on platforms or open-source projects.
2.2.3.  Enabling value exchange, asset traceability, 
and information interaction
It is crucial to recognize that we live in a digital age with abundant data. 
In that sense, a trust system for interaction concerns not only the 
exchanges of value or objects but also the exchanges of information. 
Blockchain provides the building blocks for a trust system based on digi-
tal information and algorithms.
Because permissioned blockchains and private blockchains do not 
have open access, many economists question whether a lot of the excite-
ment about blockchain is merely excitement about database upgrade.2 We 
would like to point out that even permissioned and private blockchains 
represent important innovations rather than mere database upgrades for 
the following reasons: the consensus generation process, though not fully 
decentralized, is often more decentralized than traditional systems; more 
importantly, the immutability of blockchain records coupled with proper 
encryption algorithms can enable proprietary databases (permissioned 
nodes or private blockchains) to interact to produce useful information 
aggregation, verification, and exchanges, all without sacrificing data pri-
vacy.3 This was difficult to achieve before the introduction of secure 
multi-party computation, one of the most important developments in com-
puter science over the past few years. It also allows us to enhance trace-
ability of offline assets/products by recording their origination and path of 
ownership in a tamperproof manner (e.g., Alibaba’s IoT Global Origin 
Traceability Plan; Luohan Academy, 2019).
Through smart contracts (e.g., using Solidity, a popular programming 
language used on Ethereum), programs that run on blockchains, one 
ensures that only transaction parties can execute the transaction using 
digital signature based on asymmetric keys, without the intervention of 
2 See, for example, https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2018/article/blockchain-s-
weakest-links and Halaburda (2018).
3 Data privacy is particularly important in, for example, healthcare and financial services 
(Yue et al., 2016; Raikwar et al., 2018).

any trusted third party. This further allows agents in a blockchain network 
to exchange digital assets or share the surplus generated through informa-
tion aggregation or exchange. In a similar vein, blockchains, whether open 
or not, can potentially allow exchanges of offline objects when combined 
with internet of things (IoTs) (Popov, 2016; Ali et al., 2018; Bakos and 
Halaburda, 2019).
To be concrete, Section 4.5 provides an example of blockchain archi-
tecture for collaborative auditing (Cao et al., 2018). Encryption algo-
rithms such as the zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) on top of blockchains 
allow auditing firms to exchange encrypted information so that they can 
audit transactions while preserving client firms’ proprietary information. 
R3 has developed ready-to-use permissioned blockchain infrastructure 
that can integrate with clients’ Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) sys-
tems with a reasonable adoption cost. Promising start-ups such as the 
Oasis Lab and Duality are other examples of blockchain applications in 
multi-party computations (MPCs).
It is worth mentioning that all three advantages of the blockchain 
system together enable it to be an ideal infrastructure for non-profit and 
social projects.4 Blockchains’ three benefits also create “liquidity” for 
many hitherto illiquid assets or items. For example, the reliable and timely 
recording of receipts and account receivable in a decentralized network 
imply that agents in the system can use these assets for collateral or trans-
fer of value in ways that a traditional system fails to achieve (just think 
about how long it takes for a travel reimbursement to be deposited into 
your account before you can use the resource). This would affect banks’ 
rehypothecation business as well.
3. Consensus Generation and Economic Tradeoffs
Consensus protocols are essentially the rules of the game for agents in 
distributed computing and multi-agent systems, so that they can agree on 
records that are needed to achieve overall system reliability in the

presence of agent heterogeneity (faulty nodes or processes are just special 
examples). For blockchains, the best-known consensus protocol is proof-
of-work (PoW), which is behind Bitcoin’s design.
True to the Stigler’s Law of Eponymy, the ingredients and principles 
for Bitcoin were introduced much earlier, and Nakamoto’s innovation 
truly lies in putting it altogether (Narayanan and Clark, 2017). Early 
attempts at cryptocurrencies lacked a proper incentive system for decen-
tralized nodes to properly record transactions, either because they needed 
some oversight (e.g., entity to have final decision on penalties) or 
because they did not constrain coin issues (uncontrolled inflation) 
(Halaburda and Sarvary, 2016). This leads to double-spending issues that 
would invalidate the digital currency in question. Nakamoto introduced 
the concept of bitcoin mining (essentially the PoW), in which independ-
ent computers (miners) dispersed all over the world spend resources and 
compete repeatedly for the right to record new blocks of transactions, 
and the winner in each round gets rewarded. Independent miners have 
incentives to honestly record transactions because rewards are valid only 
if their records are endorsed by subsequent miners. The avoidance of 
double spending in turn validates bitcoins as a form of payment in the 
network.
In this section, we start with a discussion on PoW before introducing 
alternate protocols and important tradeoffs among various desirable fea-
tures of blockchain.
3.1. Games under consensus protocols
Consensus protocols have been studied for decades in the field of com-
puter science. While in computer science and modern cryptography we 
typically make assumptions on the actions of the agents (an honest node 
behaves honestly; a faulty node always misbehaves), economists tend to 
make assumptions on the primitives such as agents’ utility functions and 
then analyze their strategic behaviors in equilibrium. What economics 
brings to the table for consensus protocols are the concepts of equilibrium 
(and potential multiplicity), incentive compatibility (Bitcoin’s mining 
protocol is an instance of incentive compatible protocol), and mechanism 
design. These in turn allow us to talk about incentives in a large or open 
system, in order to achieve general resilience and feasibility of the decen-
tralized systems.

A Brief Introduction to Blockchain Economics 13
3.1.1. Proof-of-work protocol
Agents in the economy are not machines, and therefore providing them 
the right incentives for proper recordkeeping is crucial. PoW at present is 
the predominant protocol for generating decentralized consensus. 
Recordkeepers here are the miners around the world who compete for the 
right to record a brief history (known as a block) of bitcoin transactions. 
The winner gets rewarded with a fixed number of bitcoins (currently 12.5 
bitcoins), plus any transaction fees included in the transactions within the 
block (Easley et al., 2017). Miners utilize computation power to solve 
cryptographic puzzles in order to win the competition, which resembles 
effortful mining activities.
Two features are common in PoW protocols. First, the difficulty of the 
cryptopuzzles dynamically adjusts so that the speed of block generation 
and thus recording is limited. In the case of Bitcoin, one block is gener-
ated on average every 10 min. This means that recordkeeping is an arms 
race: devoting more computation power improves the chance of winning 
the recordkeeping right but does not increase social surplus. Moreover, 
there is necessarily usage congestion because the system throughput is 
limited. Although not optimally designed, difficulty adjustments are not 
ad hoc and do serve the purpose of network security and are essential for 
raising revenue from users to fund miners provision of infrastructure 
(Huberman et al., 2017).
Second, in addition to getting newly minted native tokens, miners in 
many PoW blockchains also receive fees attached by users. In the case of 
Bitcoin, there is the transition from mining new bitcoins to getting market-
based fees (Easley et al., 2017). Given the rising importance of transaction 
fees and that fee structure could also lead to instability of the system 
(e.g., Carlsten et al., 2016), how to determine them in a market mecha-
nism as part of the protocol design constitutes an interesting problem. 
Basu et al. (2019) were pioneers of such a discourse.
Nakamoto envisioned that when appending blocks, the winning miner 
would append to the longest chain, thus the “longest chain rule”. Here is 
the heuristic argument: Because miners receive block rewards and fees in 
native tokens and the receipt is only valid if others continue building from 
the block they build, miners have incentives to properly record because 
otherwise others will not follow the block record. Forking out on her own 
is also not attractive because she is in a tournament with the entire mining 
community and it is highly likely that a fraudulent branch would be

shorter than the one that the rest of the community accepts. There are also 
other heuristics practiced in the blockchain community such as the “first-
seen rule” which says that all miners add blocks to the heaviest chain of 
which they know, using the first branch it has heard of as tiebreaker. What 
is implicit in these folk theorems is a vague notion of equilibrium.
Kroll et al. (2013) were among the earliest to study whether following 
the longest chain rule is a Nash equilibrium. Biais et al. (2019a) further 
fully formalized the strategic actions of players involved and demon-
strated that even without majority computation power, a miner can attack 
the system to make it unstable. Having forks also delays consensus 
because persistent forking eventually leads to the splitting of the block-
chain, as seen in the case of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic or Bitcoin 
and Bitcoin cash.
Consistent with the finding of equilibrium multiplicity by Biais et al. 
(2019a), Eyal and Sirer (2014) discuss how successful miners hide their 
success and start mining the second block without competition while hon-
est miners are still busy mining the first block. If they succeed mining the 
second block, they will collect two block rewards, and their chain is the 
longest block. Even if the honest blockchain finds the first block before 
the selfish miner finds the second, the selfish miner could release its block 
immediately to compete for the reward.
Nayak et al. (2016) and Kiayias et al. (2016) consider generalization 
and optimal forms of selfish mining strategies in Eyal and Sirer (2014) to 
include stubborn mining such as forking (building private branch).
One main takeaway from these studies is that equilibria under PoW 
are far from being well understood. Because of the network security 
implications and the intellectual curiosity of understanding protocol 
games, one would expect further studies from both computer scientists 
and economists along this line of work.
3.1.2. Alternative protocols
The largest blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) employ PoW, but PoW 
possesses significant shortcomings such as energy cost or bandwidth 
limit. Various alternatives have been proposed. In fact, PoW is not even 
among the first consensus protocols. For one, computer scientists have 
long worked on consensus protocols in a closed or permissioned environ-
ment where the number of members is not too big and the members are 
known. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol (Castro and Liskov, 2002)

is well studied and understood when applied to such an environment.5 
Roughly speaking, PoW offers good node scalability but poor perfor-
mance in terms of processing capacity, whereas variants of BFT offer 
good performance for small numbers of replicas. They often lack scalabil-
ity in open environments that blockchains applications typically entail. 
Practitioners are actively exploring protocols such as practical BFT 
(pBFT), hybrid BFT, delegated BFT, obfuscated BFT, simplified BFT, and 
VBFT that combine proof-of-stake (PoS, which we introduce shortly), 
verifiable random function, and BFT. The recent Facebook Libra stable 
coin also utilizes a version of BFT as part of the consensus protocol. 
Game-theoretical models on BFT-based protocols also constitute an 
important area of research (Amoussou-Guenou et al., 2019).
Another popular alternative to PoW is PoS. In PoS-based blockchains, 
the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random 
selection and wealth (in native tokens) or age (i.e., the stake). The study 
by Saleh (2019a) provides the first formal economic model of PoS and 
establishes conditions under which PoS generates consensus. A suffi-
ciently modest reward schedule not only implies existence of an equilib-
rium in which consensus is obtained as soon as possible but also precludes 
a persistent forking equilibrium. The latter result arises because PoS, 
unlike PoW, requires that validators hold stake. Importantly, Saleh (2019a) 
dispels the myth of “nothing-at-stake” (malicious nodes lose nothing 
when behaving badly) through endogenizing native token prices.
Another protocol, proof-of-burn (PoB), has seen recent applications. 
To win the right to record new blocks, one has to “burn” tokens by sending 
them to invalid public addresses so that no one can ever use them again. 
While practitioners probably did not have the following in mind, PoB hap-
pens to speak to PoW’s exceptional price volatility. Exceptional price 
volatility arises because PoW implements a passive monetary policy that 
fails to modulate cryptocurrency demand shocks. Saleh (2019b) theoreti-
cally formalized the aforementioned point. PoB implements an active 
albeit ad hoc monetary policy that modulates cryptocurrency demand 
shocks. PoB is an example of supply-side management of cryptocurren-
cies, which potentially reduce the welfare loss in PoWs compensating 
those updating the blockchain through an arms race while facilitating free 
entry among them. A related study is that by Cong, Li, and Wang (2019), 
5 Readers are encouraged to read more about the Byzantine General’s problem.

3.2. Blockchain impossibility triangle?
It should be apparent to readers that one goal of the blockchain technology 
is to achieve more decentralization. But for the blockchains to receive 
wide adoption and application, they also have to ensure that the consensus 
provision is accurate and scalable. Public blockchains such as the Bitcoin 
blockchain achieve decentralization and consensus record at the same 
time, but doing so reduces their scalability. Traditional payment process-
ing tools such as Visa and Mastercard achieve consensus record and scal-
ability, but lack decentralization. Records made in large scales with 
decentralization are hard to synchronize and achieve consensus. It seems 
that global consensus, decentralization, and scalability are hard to achieve 
at the same time.
Vitalik was among the first to put forth the scalability trilemma that is 
widely recognized among practitioners (Ometoruwa, 2018). The trilemma 
describes how it is difficult to achieve decentralization, security, and scal-
ability at the same time. Security refers to the level of defensibility a 
blockchain has against attacks from external sources of linear-order com-
putation power. In fact, Brewer (2000) conjectured even earlier in a talk 
that it is impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously pro-
vide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. This was proven 
later by Gilbert and Lynch (2002).
Abadi and Brunnermeier (2018) gave an insightful and more compre-
hensive discussion of a similar trilemma from an economic perspective. 
When a blockchain is decentralized and correct, the lack of dynamic rent 
by various recordkeepers necessarily implies that the system is costly; 
when the system is decentralized and maintained at low cost, record-
keepers may misreport; when the consensus is correct and maintenance of 
the system is cheap, the outcome is incompatible with free entry and 
information portability (compared with traditional reputation-based sys-
tem) conditions.
The concept of “security” is just one aspect of consensus, in the sense 
that the whole system agrees on the state of the world and that agreement 
cannot be attacked. The tradeoffs do not necessarily involve dynamic con-
siderations as in Abadi and Brunnermeier (2018) either. Moreover, there 
are more than three dimensions of tradeoffs in the blockchain technology,

such as transparency, immediacy, level of adoption, which constitute a 
rich avenue for future research. Nevertheless, we argue that almost all 
tradeoffs can be interpreted as manifestations of the tension among decen-
tralization, scalability, and consensus (formation). We conjecture that 
there is such a general impossibility triangle (Figure 1) and discuss below 
how this can be a useful framework to think about various tradeoffs in 
blockchain innovations. As we walk you through the irreducible difficul-
ties that arise when one tries to achieve all three, we also mention how 
practitioners are still actively working on layer 1 protocol innovations and 
layer 2 business model innovations to resolve the seeming impossibility 
triangle.
3.2.1. Decentralization
Decentralization in our context means a significant degree of distribution 
of a system’s information, governance, ownership, etc. When decentral-
ized agents jointly make decisions, intuitively it takes a clever design to 
reach agreements. The more decentralized the system is, the greater the 
potential failure for reaching a global consensus. Moreover, decentralized 
storage of global consensus necessarily leads to duplication, be it storage, 
queries, recordings, etc. In either case, consensus accuracy or system pro-
cessing capacity would be compromised.
Layer 1 protocol innovations on consensus protocols often come at 
the expense of decentralization. For example, the variants of conventional

18 Information for Efficient Decision Making
BFTs allow a high number of messages in that every node multi-casts its 
messages to every other node. Functional separation of leader election and 
transaction validation allow localization (Eyal et al., 2016). Bitcoin runs 
verification and leader election at the same time, but Bitcoin NG is for-
ward-looking and uses key blocks to elect a leader first who validates 
transactions in microblocks in the next 10 minutes. Other solutions 
include forming a committee to vouch for new blocks through BFT (e.g., 
ByzCoin (Kogias et al., 2016)) and sharding (e.g., Elastico (Luu et al., 
2016)). Sharding makes sense, but requires something called Atomic 
Cross-Shard Commitment Protocol. All these involve some local consen-
sus formation within a preselected committee instead of open consensus 
all the time.
3.2.2. Consensus (formation)
Note that the consensus we have in mind is global consensus that can be 
used in various applications. This is hard to achieve. In fact, Fischer et al. 
(1982) show that there is no guarantee that an asynchronous network can 
agree on a single outcome.
One way is to sacrifice efficiency and scalability to wait for a decen-
tralized system to reach consensus. Many permissionless blockchains do 
this, which we discuss shortly in the next subsection. Another way to 
overcome the consensus problem is to synchronize from a single point, 
but this means centralization. We believe that sacrificing some decentrali-
zation is a promising direction and enterprise blockchains are going to be 
the major trend for blockchain applications. Trust combined with effi-
ciency can disrupt existing business models and relationships.
It is worth mentioning that DAG, an alternative architecture to ensure 
decentralization and scalability, instead sacrifices consensus. In fact, there 
may not be a global consensus at any given point in time. A hybrid of 
DAG and blockchain is being explored to enforce collective consensus 
generation, minimizing the monopolitic power of the round leaders 
(Abram et al., 2019).
3.2.3. Scalability
Bitcoin only processes less than five transactions per second, whereas 
VISA and Mastercard process thousands, not to mention Alibaba’s Tmall 
processes 100 billion RMB worth of transactions under 2 hours on

China’s single’s day.6 For blockchains such as the P2P payment Bitcoin 
network to be widely adopted, they have to effectively scale. Two obvious 
solutions are increasing the block size or decreasing the block intervals. 
Increasing the size decreases fairness in that large miners have an advan-
tage (law of large numbers would not play out). It also requires more 
storage space and network bandwidth, not to mention that it requires more 
verification time (which is not an issue for simple transactions in bitcoin, 
but could be an issue when verifications are more complicated). In addi-
tion, increasing the block size still does not solve the problem of miners 
strategically partially filling the blocks (Malik et al., 2019). What about 
decreasing block interval? It would imply that it requires lower computa-
tion to attack unless participants increase the confirmation lags corre-
spondingly, leading to more forks and stale blocks all of which result in 
network instability and inaccurate or unreliable consensus.
Most current applications of blockchains have decentralization and 
consensus and are battling the scalability issue. Multi-chain solutions 
increase throughputs at the expense of security; for merge mining, agents 
share mining power as in the case of Namecoin, where store and computa-
tion loads on each node increase, which is similar to block size increase. 
Other solutions include cross-chain layer 2 innovation, of which Ripple’s 
interledger is a leading candidate, off-chain; state channel, with the best-
known example being the Lightning Network, Casper; Sharding “parallel 
processing”, e.g., Ethereum Casper, Zilliqa (open-source); Segwit, DAG.
It should be recognized that depending on the application, we do not 
need to achieve all three objectives at the same time. Besides exploring 
solutions to the challenge of the impossibility triangle, another fruitful 
path could be to clearly identify the need in particular applications and 
design the protocols and business models correspondingly.
4. Key Economic Issues
Mechanism design and protocol innovations to achieve decentralization, 
consensus, and scalability have received increasing attention from com-
puter scientists and economists. In this section, we highlight that the

specific designs of consensus protocols can have general social economic 
implications. These have to be taken into consideration in designing the 
protocols too.
We start with the well-known discussion in computer science on net-
work security and end with an emphasis on the role of information — an 
important topic that is inappropriately relegated to the backseat, if not 
neglected entirely, in many studies.
4.1. Network security
The earliest discussions on blockchains took place in the computer 
 science field and largely concern network security. This is very much 
related to our earlier discussions on protocol games. Once we fix the 
 consensus protocol, there could be a number of strategies that attackers/
malicious nodes in the network could deploy. Consider PoW for example. 
Below, some of the well-known attacks are described.
In denial-of-service (DoS) attack and its derivatives such as distributed 
DOS, a malicious cyber threat prevents legitimate users from accessing 
information systems, devices, or other network resources, so as to lower 
other players’ (typically mining pools’) profits (Johnson et al., 2014).
Besides direct attacks, there could be other forms of instability driven 
by decentralized miners’ incentives. For example, without newly minted 
bitcoins, miners may extend the blocks with the most available transaction 
fees rather than to follow the longest chain, causing instability of the net-
work (Carlsten et al., 2016).
A much studied case is selfish mining, in which malicious miners or 
pools withhold the mined blocks. Honest miners then waste their compu-
tational power in finding blocks already mined, and malicious miners 
increase their probability of finding the next block. This leads to majority 
attack. It is often mentioned that with 51% of the global hash power, one 
can be a dictator on recordkeeping. What is often the case is that as long 
as an attacker amasses a large percentage of the global hash power, the 
system’s security is at risk (Sapirshtein et al., 2016; Bahack, 2013).
Network security in the blockchain setting can be viewed as robust 
consensus, and there often features a tension between a more decentral-
ized structure and scalability. Overall, network security issues remain an 
active area of research for blockchains. Taking a game-theoretical 
approach has been tremendously helpful for understanding the behaviors

of agents and robustness of the system for a given consensus protocol. We 
anticipate more mechanism design approach in future that has network 
security as part of the objective to optimize over candidate designs.
4.2. Overconcentration
In addition to network security, the blockchain community has been 
extremely concerned with overconcentration. For a system with a suffi-
ciently large processing capacity, the incentives for consensus generation 
seem to lead to an industrial organization with a perceived tendency for 
concentration. This is aggravated by the emergence of mining pools that 
combine an individual miner’s hash power to solve cryptographic puzzles 
in PoW and then distribute the rewards. An open blockchain’s optimal 
functioning relies on adequate and sustainable decentralization that can-
not be taken for granted. In fact, over time some pools gain a significant 
share of global hash rates (a measure of computation power), with the 
mining pool GHash.io briefly reaching more than 51% of global hash 
rates in July 2014. Therefore, the rise of mining pools in many, presuma-
bly distributed cryptocurrency-mining activities calls into question the 
stability and viability of such systems. Overconcentration therefore runs 
counter to blockchain advocates’ ideology of decentralization.
The study by Cong et al. (2018) shows that risk sharing constitutes a 
natural force against decentralization and gives rise to mining pools. 
Ferreira et al. (2019) show that application-specific integrated circuits 
(ASICs) that are used for mining could lead to concentration in ASIC 
production market which then affects the mining pool concentration.
Figure 2 illustrates the evolution of the distribution of hash rates 
among Bitcoin mining pools. Clearly, overtime mining pools gradually 
dominate solo mining: mining pools represented less than 5% of the 
global hash rates at the start of June 2011 but have represented almost 
100% since late 2015. This phenomenon suggests that natural economic 
forces tend towards centralization within a supposedly decentralized sys-
tem. But an equally interesting fact is that, while large pools do arise from 
time to time, none of them grow to completely dominate global mining. 
This observation hints at concurrent economic forces that suppress 
overcentralization.
Indeed, Cong et al. (2018) demonstrate that diversification across 
pools and the industrial organization of mining pools naturally moderate

Notes: This graph plots (1) the growth of aggregate hash rates (right-hand side vertical axis, in log scale) starting from June 2011 to today; and (2) the size evolu-
tions of all Bitcoin mining pools (left-hand side vertical axis) over this period, with the pool size measured as each pool’s hash rates as a fraction of global hash 
rates. Different shades indicate different pools, and white spaces indicate solo mining. Over time, Bitcoin mining has been increasingly taken over by mining 
pools, but no pool seems to ever dominate the mining industry for long. The pool hash rates data come from Bitcoinity and BTC.com, with details given in Cong 
et al. (2018).

overconcentration of mining power. Intuitively, larger pools have more 
market power because the risk-sharing benefit it provides is larger. 
Therefore, pool owners charge higher fees, leading to a smaller percent-
age growth in pool size. Empirical evidence supports the theoretical pre-
dictions. Every quarter, the authors sort pools into deciles based on the 
start-of-quarter pool size and calculate the average pool share, average 
fee, and average log growth rate for each decile. They show that pools 
with larger start-of-quarter size charge higher fees and grow slower in 
percentage terms. They investigate these relationships in three 2-year 
spans (i.e., 2012–2013, 2014–2015, and 2016–2017, as shown in Figure 3) 
and find that almost all of them are statistically significant with the signs 
predicted by their theory.
The insights from this chapter can be extended to other protocols such 
as PoS, because miners in PoS systems also form coalitions (e.g., Brunjes 
et al., 2018).
4.3. Energy consumption and sustainability
The issue surrounding blockchains that has received the most attention is 
arguably the energy implications for PoW-based blockchains. The pur-
ported advantages of Bitcoin are dwarfed by the intentionally resource-
intensive design in its transaction verification process which threatens 
the environment integral to our survival.7 Environmental science and 
engineering studies have estimated the detrimental environmental 
impacts of cryptomining (e.g., Li et al., 2019; de Vries, 2019; Truby, 
2018). Again, this is a manifestation of the impossibility triangle: for a 
large-scale decentralized system, generating consensus could be very 
costly.
A number of economic studies also recognize that the mining game in 
PoW-based blockchains is essentially an arms race due to difficulty 
adjustments in many of the consensus protocols. Basically agents acquire 
more computation power to compete in a fixed-sum game because more 
global hash power does not lead to more native coins or tokens being 
minted and distributed to the miners. O’Dwyer and Malone (2014); Chiu 
7 Energy issues are also related to scalability, but they are not exactly the same. For one, 
even if Bitcoin processes way more transactions or way less transactions, energy consump-
tion could be high if coinbase is worth a lot and many miners started competing.

A Brief Introduction to Blockchain Economics 25
In particular, Benetton et al. (2019) found empirical evidence that 
cryptomining crowds out other economic activities and may result in net 
welfare loss. Using data from various cities in China and New York State, 
the authors found large negative externalities of cryptomining on the local 
economy, such as distortion to local wages and electricity price. As the 
study by Benetton et al. (2019) points out, local taxes would only drive the 
problem elsewhere, akin to the phenomenon of corporate profit shifting to 
tax-friendly geographies, while worldwide levy is hard to coordinate.
Given that the current designs for Bitcoin and the like entail a large 
social welfare loss, but can be improved with more efficient design, prac-
titioners have attempted to channel the computation to scientific prob-
lems. For example, in proof of useful work or resources (PoUWR), the 
mining computation is used for performing stochastic gradient descent for 
neural network training (Bottou 1991). Not all scientific computation 
problems are NP-complete, which is required for many PoW protocols, 
the energy problem remains.
Most studies hint at cryptocurrency price and mining cost as the big-
gest drivers on the global mining activities. Intuitively, the higher the 
Bitcoin price, the more entry and greater computation power miners use, 
which leads to a higher energy consumption. This is only an incomplete 
description in that in the long run, compensation is driven by system con-
gestion and market fees attached by the users. If Bitcoin is worth more, 
users just attach less number of bitcoins. In that regard, Bitcoin price can-
not be the long-term and only driver for the high energy consumption.
This is where mining pool is included in the discussion. For the same 
amount of monetary rewards, if miners’ risk-bearing capacity is greater, 
then they devote more mining power — another key insight in Cong et al. 
(2018). Figure 4 demonstrates that when mining pools help miners to 
share risk, the aggregate mining could easily double for realistic parame-
ters for Bitcoin mining. For further discussion on the dynamic evolution 
of distribution of miners and reward schemes in mining pools, we refer the 
readers to Liu et al. (2018) and Fisch et al. (2017). It is yet to be seen how 
consensus protocol innovations resolve the issues created by mining 
pools.
4.4. Adoption
In some sense, blockchain’s scalability is reflected by endogenous user 
adoptions. Without user adoption, most blockchain applications cannot

survive over the long run. Athey et al. (2016) carried out one of the earliest 
studies that take users’ adoption into consideration, with an emphasis on 
the role of learning in agents’ decisions to use Bitcoins. While Athey et al. 
(2016) did not consider users’ network externality, Cong et al. (2018b) 
took network externality and blockchain platform’s productivity into con-
sideration to analyze token pricing and the roles of tokens. They derived 
a fundamental token pricing formula and showed that adoption of block-
chain platforms crucially depends on the underlying technology and trans-
action needs.
Hinzen et al. (2019) also demonstrated that a limited adoption prob-
lem arises endogenously in PoW blockchains. Increased transaction 
demand increases the fees, which induce recordkeepers to enter the net-
work (for permissionless blockchains). The increased network size then 
protracts the consensus process and delays transaction confirmation. 
Users adopt only if they possess extreme insensitivity to delays, limiting a 
PoW payments blockchains widespread adoption. The authors then argue 
that permissioned blockchain can overcome this problem because there is

no difficulty adjustments or free entry of recordkeepers. However, valida-
tors may still collude, which can be solved by a stake-based voting rule.
4.5. Multi-party computation and permissioned blockchains
Multi-party computation (MPC) has been extensively studied for decades 
because it enables computation with correctness while preserving privacy. 
Its implementation has been challenging because the strong assumptions 
on agents’ honesty means in practice it is prone to SPOFs (such as DoS 
attacks), not to mention that scaling in a large (often open) system is 
costly (Zyskind et al., 2016). As described earlier, one of Nakamoto’s 
innovations lies in introducing incentives into a consensus system. This 
way, the blockchain technology offers a form of incentive compatibility 
that mitigates both problems.
Specifically, blockchains can potentially serve as a trusted settlement 
layer to discipline malicious behaviors (through verifying transcripts of 
computations). They also allow introducing some randomization of com-
mittee selections (sometimes referred to as quorums) at a low cost, which 
can potentially scale MPC networks efficiently. Alex Pentland, the founder 
of MIT Media Lab and one of the most prominent data scientists, was 
quoted as saying, “[With blockchains, now] you can get insights across 
countries, across data holders, without exposing individual data and with-
out disobeying either privacy or data localization laws” (MIT, 2018).
Permissioned blockchains are widely used as a distributed database 
system that could enable MPC. Many industries, such as auditing and 
financial report, can potentially benefit from the technology. Auditing has 
its unique need for a customized system to protect clients’ information 
privacy. Such a need leads many auditors to develop permissioned block-
chains independently as a database upgrade (Tysiac, 2018). Yet, with up-
to-date and immutable historical record, auditors can easily verify the 
transactions on blockchain ledgers (either because the transactions are 
public or because they are on an auditor’s proprietary blockchain or other 
private blockchains that auditors have access to) instead of asking clients 
for bank statements or sending confirmation requests to third parties. 
Moreover, communications across auditors could greatly improve audit-
ing efficiency if the auditors automate information verification of clients’ 
transaction with minimum sharing of their clients’ information with other 
auditors, thanks to zero-knowledge protocols that preserve data privacy 
and integrity.

Cao et al. (2018) provide a blueprint for such collaborative auditing 
using a federated blockchain which reduces auditing costs not only for 
transactions recorded on their proprietary databases but also for cross-
auditor transactions. Figure 5 provides an illustration. Specifically, infor-
mation providers in this federate blockchain system technically do not 
share any client transaction information except for providing a confirma-
tion to information requesters. Other auditors cannot infer any informa-
tion about the clients or the transactions from the request or the 
confirmation. This collaboration among auditors does not require a third 
party to monitor or intermediate. Once auditors request information 
through this federated blockchain framework, it is difficult for any auditor 
or outside hackers to intentionally revise or delete the information because 
the information is distributed to all auditors. Such immutable nature of 
information also makes it easier for the regulator to inspect auditors’ 
auditing process.
The authors then model auditor competition for clients, allowing endog-
enous audit quality and clients’ misstatement, before discussing regulatory 
policy in a unified framework to understand the implications of blockchain 
for auditing. They find blockchains lead to more real-time verification of 
transaction records on blockchains, forcing firms to misreport more in 
Figure 5:  Transaction verification on a P2P federated blockchain.

off-blockchain records. The reduction in auditing cost allows auditors to 
respond by inspecting a higher fraction of off-chain records and discretion-
ary accounts. Overall, auditors spend less on auditing and reduce misstate-
ment risk. Auditors charge competitive fees to attract clients, which are 
lower when using federated blockchains. But fees depend on both the trans-
action volume and counterparties’ auditor association. Auditors’ adoption of 
the technology also exhibits strategic complementarity in the sense that one 
auditor’s adoption encourages others to adopt. To rule out the inefficient 
outcome where no auditor adopts the technology, a regulator can encourage 
or require adoption to enhance welfare and reduce regulatory costs.
In general, building multi-party computation using the blockchain 
infrastructure remains a promising avenue for blockchain innovations. 
Data Market Austria (https://datamarket.at/en/ueber-dma/) is a recent 
large-scale endeavor in that direction. That said, while permissioned 
blockchains allow scalability, they do so at the expense of partial 
decentralization.
4.6. Smart contracting
Smart contracts have received much media hype. While a universally 
accepted definition for smart contracts has yet to be reached, their core 
functionality is clear: transfer at little cost or even automate value trans-
fers based on a decentralized consensus record of the states of the world. 
Cong and He (2018) define them as digital contracts allowing terms con-
tingent on decentralized consensus that are tamperproof and typically 
self-enforcing through automated execution. Other similar definitions can 
be found in Szabo (1998) and Lauslahti et al. (2017).
To the extent that contract terms are contingent on outcomes that can 
be recorded on blockchains (potentially via IoTs, or “oracles” feeders of 
information from the offline world onto the internet), smart contracts fore-
most reduce the contracting frictions and costs of a trust system. It allows 
contracting parties to more easily reach consensus which is robust to 
agency issues or technical failures of recordkeepers. This enlarges the 
contracting space and makes contracts in practice more complete. 
Moreover, the linked-list structure and time stamping also allow smart 
contracts to commit to no renegotiation. In that regard, smart contracts can 
be robust to renegotiation. Cong and He (2018) and Tinn (2018) formally 
discussed these issues. Gans (2019) and Bakos and Halaburda (2019) 
further described how smart contracts can help overcome holdup issues 
and contracting difficulties, or be integrated with IoT.

30 Information for Efficient Decision Making
Smart contracts’ impact on dynamic moral hazard is unclear and is 
closely related to information design. In particular, more transparency 
or more frequent monitoring/disclosure of information is not necessar-
ily desirable (e.g., Orlov, 2018). The study by Tinn (2018) contains an 
in-depth discussion on how learning can make debt and equity more 
costly and restrictive under moral hazard and relates smart contracting 
to traditional dynamic moral hazard (e.g., Holmstrom and Milgrom, 
1987).
As for broader applications, smart contracts can be designed for 
information-constrained insurance or credit, in addition to being a device 
that facilitates information and mechanism design to overcome the issues 
of rational herding (Cong and Xiao, 2019). Various informational issues 
such as how blockchain helps with coordination are just starting to be 
explored; contracting using digital information is likely an important 
ingredient in the overarching architecture. They, in turn, are related to 
competition and industrial organization. Lyandres (2019) is a recent 
examination of the effects of price commitments via smart contracts on 
firm competition and value.
As much as we are excited about the potential of smart contracting, 
we have to recognize their limitations. First, it cannot enforce the transfer 
of ownership of offline assets, a point also belabored in Abadi and 
Brunnermeier (2018); second, it has been combined with IoTs and oracles 
to acquire information off-chain; third, it is not a panacea for incomplete 
contracting: contingencies traditional contracts cannot specify are also 
hard to program into smart contracts, unless artificial intelligence drasti-
cally changes how smart contracts function.
Once again, consensus for smart contracting at large scale may make 
decentralization difficult due to the implications of information distribu-
tion, a point that we will discuss next.
4.7. Information aggregation and distribution
Closely related to smart contracting is the broader informational implica-
tion of blockchains, an aspect of the technological development that is 
largely neglected. Economists have long understood that information 
distribution or disclosure could lead to undesirable outcomes such as col-
lusions (Bloomfield and O’Hara, 1999). Cong and He (2018) were also 
among the first set of researchers to bring such discussions to blockchains

and point out considerable informational challenges in maintaining a 
decentralized system.8
The main insight in Cong and He (2018) is that in order for a decen-
tralized consensus system to be robust to single points of failure, there has 
to be some degree of information distribution, even encrypted informa-
tion. This is illustrated in Figure 6. But greater information in the public 
domain would lead to market participants to tacitly collude more, hurting 
consumer welfare.
8 A related study is by Aune et al. (2017), who discussed the use of hashing to secure time 
priority without revealing detailed information and disclosing information later, in order to 
prevent front-running a transaction.

Notes: A seller delivers goods to a buyer, with ω~ denoting the contingency of successful delivery. 
Recordkeepers, potentially with real-time IoT sensors, monitor the delivery and submit their reports, 
y~k’s. The protocol of blockchain aggregates these reports to form a decentralized consensus, z~. This 
consensus, together with the smart contract, is stored in the block and then added to the blockchain.

32 Information for Efficient Decision Making
Though the information distribution entailed in decentralized consen-
sus processes could be detrimental, the authors’ message is broader: the 
robust decentralized consensus enables agents to contract on delivery 
outcomes and automate contingent transfers, therefore eliminating infor-
mation asymmetry as a barrier for entry and encouraging greater competi-
tion. Blockchains and smart contracts expand the set of possible dynamic 
equilibria leading to social welfare and consumer surplus that could be 
higher or lower than in a traditional world.
Information transmission is also affected by the technology. For 
example, Chod et al. (2019) show that signaling a firm’s fundamental 
quality (e.g., its operational capabilities) to lenders through inventory 
transactions is more efficient than signaling through loan requests. The 
blockchain technology could enable the verification of fundamentals and 
provide greater transparency into a firm’s supply chain.
Finally, blockchain architecture can also be utilized for crowdsourc-
ing and information aggregation. Indeed, many blockchain-based plat-
forms increasingly use token-weighted voting to crowdsource information 
from their users for content curation, on-chain governance, etc. The role 
of decentralized structure and tokens are yet to be fully understood. For 
example, Falk and Tsoukalas (2019) have showed that token weighting 
generally discourages truthful voting and erodes the platform’s informa-
tion aggregation for prediction.
5. Concluding Remarks and Future Directions
To conclude, we summarize the key takeaways of the discussion thus far. 
Digital technology rebuilds the dynamics and relations among economic 
agents, potentially turning competition to collaboration, integrating seg-
mented markets, and enabling consumers to participate and benefit more from 
business enterprises. Digitized information and functional trust constitute the 
hallmarks of a digital economy. While great progress has been achieved in 
terms of digitization, building trust on digital networks has been challenging. 
Blockchains provide a potential decentralized solution. Against this general 
backdrop, several general themes on blockchain economics stand out.
First, a game-theoretical approach to understanding consensus proto-
cols has proven successful. For example, Biais et al. (2019b) point out 
directions in setting fees and designing throughput capacity, etc. The key 
is to specify preferences and action space, and agents rationally maximize 
their expected utilities. This is different from computer scientists’ typical

approach of directly assuming nodes’ behaviors. One case is the study by 
Manshaei et al. (2018), who studied multiple committee runs in parallel 
to validate a non-intersecting set of transactions (a shard), with both 
Byzantine agents and rational agents. Amoussou-Guenou et al. (2019) 
have analyzed a similar problem in a dynamic setting and showed that 
rational agents can be pivotal instead of merely free ride.
Among the attempts at resolving the various bottlenecks of block-
chain systems, those that involve local consensus, local centralization, or 
local scalability for solving privacy issues, saving storage, increasing 
throughput seem promising (Sharding is an example). Elastico (NUS 
Singapore) is an example. Each committee that uses BFT then submits the 
summaries to the final committee.
Second, besides technical innovations aimed at overcoming the 
impossibility triangle, breakthroughs are likely to come from mechanism 
design approaches to consensus protocols, with clear objectives for spe-
cific applications. For example, some blockchain applications may not 
require scalability, while some do not require global consensus. The pro-
tocol designs would differ correspondingly. Wishful ideology or Utopian 
dreams of full decentralization are not going to effectively propel the 
industry forward, but the right designs incentivizing and empowering 
agents in a decentralized or multi-centered system will.
In particular, protocol design should take into consideration block-
chain governance (not only consensus about transactions but also how to 
resolve conflicts such as forking). One recent attempt related to govern-
ance and voting schemes was that of Barrera and Hurder (2018). A mecha-
nism design approach also allows us to link layer one (decentralized 
consensus) and layer two (business model) innovations. Some designs 
could be useful for both incentivizing consensus generation and incentiv-
izing users, as we elaborate next.
Third, agency and incentive issues remain at the core of blockchain 
economics. The discussion of incentive provision should not be restricted 
to the consensus protocol level, but can be extended to include user adop-
tion, market design, etc., that are at the platform/ecosystem level.
Here, smart contracts coupled with sensors/IoTs would prove useful 
in that they can ensure prompt and guaranteed payments when contingent 
terms are satisfied. Would more verifiable data improve contracting effi-
ciency? A better traceability of product and cash flows may allow firms to 
collateralize their account receivables more effectively and to receive pay-
ments from banks more quickly. They can also be used to compensate

contributors and users on the network for content contributions and the 
like or between organizations such as mining pools and their members.
Speaking of users, their decision-making in a decentralized system is 
less studied, so are entrepreneurial teams that build the blockchain infra-
structures. The interaction of user and consensus provision, and more 
generally, the service provision and demand in a platform economy can 
bring new economic insights for blockchain applications. The use of cryp-
totokens may prove useful in aligning incentives on platforms.9 The work 
by Cong et al. (2018a) serves as an example of a recent study in this 
direction.
Finally, informational exchanges and data issues here started to be 
explored. In initial coin offerings (ICOs) or initial exchange offerings 
(IEOs), how would the informational asymmetry and environment relate 
to misreporting, incentive alignments, and fraudulent activities? How 
should policymakers regulate the markets and mandate information dis-
closures? How do we utilize IoTs and oracles to input information from 
offline environments? How would protocol designs matter for information 
aggregation and distribution?
In particular, the decentralized system seems to offer a solution for 
achieving data privacy and effective use of proprietary databases at the 
same time. Multi-party computation combining blockchain and various 
encryption methods opens new doors for how data are stored and used 
across institutions and individuals in future, which in turn affects eco-
nomic decision-making. One caveat is that blockchains alone are not 
panacea for the problem of offline data authenticity and original data 
quality.
Surveying the past and looking into the future, we can say that if 
information and assets are the blood of a human body, then trust/consen-
sus system (centralized or decentralized) is the vessel. Similarly if big 
data and physical resources are the input for the society’s production, a 
functional digital network is the production function. Distributed systems 
such as blockchains are likely to be an integral part of this broader 
picture.
9 While media discussions focus on cryptocurrencies as a substitute for money, it is equally 
important to understand the fundamental economics of using tokens on platforms or at 
digital market places. A large number of industry projects and academic studies are 
devoted to understanding better tokenomics, which could be just as important as block-
chain protocol designs.
