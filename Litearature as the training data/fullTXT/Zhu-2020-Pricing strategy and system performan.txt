Abstract
Blockchain technology has been enjoying rapid development in numerous areas where trust, safety, and global payments are
deemed important. In this research, we introduce a framework that integrates blockchain technologywith the emerging concept
of cloud manufacturing. It has the potential to dramatically improve the feasibility and applicability of cloud manufacturing.
Our focus is on the pricing strategies for service providers in bidding for jobs in such a system. A scenario is developed based
on cloud additive manufacturing services. A game theoretic approach for pricing simulation is proposed in the research, and
a fuzzy algorithm is employed in the pricing decision. Two pricing policies are considered: one is that the information of
players is unknown to each other, and the other is that the information of players who are within a limit of Euclidean space
is known to each other. The effects of system load and the weight coefficients in KNN recommendation algorithm are also
studied. The results show that the pricing policy has significant effect on revenue generation for providers, and the increase
of system load helps to grow revenue for providers only when the machine utilization is low and job waiting time is short.
In addition, the system seems to be less sensitive to the change of KNN weights in terms of individual provider and system
revenues.

Introduction
The unprecedented developments in information technology,
data analytics, artificial intelligence, supply chain manage-
ment, and manufacturing technology have already made
global production and distribution a reality. One step further,
consumers have started to show enormous interests in per-
sonalized/customized products produced and delivered on a
global scale. For instance, a pair of Nike sneakers (not only
the sneaker midsoles but also the textile uppers) can now
be produced based on customer’s unique foot information
by additive manufacturing technology (Nike News 2019).

Driven by customer needs, a subscription-based services in
a pay-as-you-go model has become increasingly popular in
manufacturing industry (Yao et al. 2019). Benefited from
cloud computing success, the concept of cloud manufactur-
ing was recently proposed. This on-demand manufacturing
service in industry treats everything as service, such as Infras-
tructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS),
and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Wu et al. 2013). Cloud
manufacturing aims to enable the resources spreading across
regions to be utilized in a more efficient manner, and cus-
tomers to be better served. Nevertheless, issues such as trust,
security, and payment remain themajor obstacles that prevent
manufacturing industry from adopting cloud manufacturing.
On the other hand, blockchain technology has shown great
potentials for numerous applications, thanks to its unique fea-
tures on decentralization, trust, security, and crypto-currency.
The issues faced by cloudmanufacturing can be readily tack-
led or mitigated by integrating blockchain technology to
create a synergy. As such, a consensus-oriented blockchain
model is introduced for cloudmanufacturing in this research.
The model allows various cloud resources to be used for
manufacturing activities. A blockchain system is essentially

a distributed ledger, and thus many manufacturing services
and other activities can be realized through consensus in the
model. Meanwhile, additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D Print-
ing) is revolutionizing the entire manufacturing industry. It
greatly simplifies the manufacturing procedure—any com-
plex parts can now bemade by just onemachine, shortens the
supply chain, and is born for on-demand manufacturing and
inherently rooted for making customized goods (Mai et al.
2016). Also, the nature of additive manufacturing is “digi-
tal” in that everything starts from a digital 3D solid model
(Masood and Lim 1995). All those make additive manufac-
turing a perfect pilot application for the cloud manufacturing
system integrated with blockchain technology.
In this study, we first introduce a framework of cloud
additive manufacturing service with blockchain technology.
The framework is featured with value sharing, consensus,
and manageable decentralization. Those features along with
the design of open source service-recommendation make the
framework distinct from the existing related research. More
importantly, we focus on the critical issue of pricing strat-
egy for service providers, and develop a simulation study to
investigate how the pricing strategies affect the system per-
formance. As such, besides the proposed framework, another
major contribution of this study is the adoption of game the-
ory approach to develop the pricing strategies of providers in
the cloud additive manufacturing system.
Literature review
Manufacturing as a service on cloud
Cloud manufacturing is a new computing and service-
oriented manufacturing model, and it has several typical
service platforms, such as, public, private, community and
hybrid platforms (Tao et al. 2011; Puttonen et al. 2019).
The essence of cloud manufacturing is Manufacturing-as-
a-Service (MaaS) on cloud, and a most recent definition
by Kusiak (2020) indicates that MaaS (or service manu-
facturing) includes Process-as-a-Service and Manufacturing
Operations-as-a-Service. The representative works regard-
ing cloud manufacturing and MaaS are briefly summarized
as follows. Wang et al. (2016) propose a resource scheduling
model which contains four indicators of cost, time, quality,
and risk to optimize cloud manufacturing resource manage-
ment. A new swap-shuffled leap-frog algorithm is employed
to simulate the model. Xie et al. (2017) present a seman-
tic model for information resource service modeling. The
model enables automated integrating and distributed updat-
ing in resource service cloud for wheel manufacturing.Wang
et al. (2017) propose a flexible, lightweight plate intelligent
manufacturing system. The system integrates the concept of
cloud computing with the assembly manufacturing process
so that raw materials are saved and the production efficiency
is improved. Coupek et al. (2017) propose a cloud-based
architecture of control systems. All sequential manufactur-
ing and assembly processes are connected by the proposed
architecture that allows for downstream bias compensation
using information from the prior production steps in one of
the next steps. This architecture is applied to the rotor produc-
tion of electric motors in the automotive industry. Mazzola
et al. (2018) propose a novel pragmatic approach to address
a need for agile collaboration among supply chain partners
or different divisions or branches in the same company. This
is achieved by a set of semantic annotations encoded into the
business process model. Ostrosi and Fougères (2018) pro-
pose a method to solve the formation of intelligent virtual
manufacturing units in cloud-based design and manufactur-
ing. It is assumed that a cloud-based cellular manufacturing
design can be referred to as a multi-scale, uncertain and
dynamic service-oriented network inwhich a set of CAD fea-
tures,modeledby a set of features, canbe fabricated in a smart
virtual manufacturing unit. Li et al. (2019) propose a two-
level multi-task scheduling model which is more effective
than the traditional one-level model. The two-level two-
optimization scheme in particular could find better schedule
for both individual task and cloud platform. Talhi et al. (2019)
indicate that efficient collaboration for product lifecycleman-
agement has been a challenge, and the introduction of cloud
manufacturing could mitigate this issue. Further, an ontolog-
ical model is proposed for sharing information among the
stakeholders in cloud manufacturing systems. In the study
of Yuan et al. (2019), the assembly line balancing problem
in cloud manufacturing is formulated into an optimization
problem based on an actual production scenario, and multi-
ple solution algorithms are developed and compared.
Moreover, Lu and Xu (2019) introduce a generic system
architecture, which is based on cyber-physical production
systems and big data analytics for cloud-based manufac-
turing. The initial test indicates that the system is capable
of delivering on-demand manufacturing over the Internet.
Lu et al. (2019) develop a service-oriented product data
model, which relies on semantic web technologies to pro-
mote the make-to-individual production strategy in a global
manufacturing-service network environment. Zheng et al.
(2018) propose a common data-driven network physics
method for personalized, smart, and connected product joint
development in a cloud-based environment. Jin et al. (2018)
also propose a smart service model to solve the challenges
of providing personalized products in the background of
intelligent features and deep integration with the smart envi-
ronment. The model supports smart environment-enabled
features and services-enabled smartness. In addition, Zheng
et al. (2017), based on the adaptable open architecture prod-
uct platform, establish a framework of a personalized product
configuration system. In the framework, a two-stage process
123
Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1985–2002 1987
is presented to ensure the adaptability and scalability of the
product category.
On the other hand, in spite of the aforementioned efforts,
some long standing challenges, such as trust, safety, stan-
dardization, and global payment, remain in the cloud manu-
facturing models. Therefore, new solutions are called for to
address the challenges, and this is why blockchain technol-
ogy is introduced in this context.
Blockchain applications
It is indicated that the cryptocurrency applications of dis-
tributed ledger methods (i.e., blockchains) are now well
established (Anjum et al. 2017). The implications for general
topic are just beginning to be concerned. New applications
are emerging in many fields such as finance, banking, insur-
ance, fraud detection (Cai and Zhu 2016), supply chain, and
production. In the following, the representative works related
to Internet of Things, supply chain, and smart manufactur-
ing are surveyed. Lim et al. (2019) provide a recent review
on digital-twin technology, which is critical to the era of
Industry 4.0. It is indicated that the integration of digital-
twin and blockchain will stimulate the applications in many
new fields. Viriyasitavat et al. (2018) propose a new business
process management concept in Industry 4.0 by integrat-
ing the blockchain technology. Thanks to the capability of
blockchain technology for reliable verification of trustwor-
thiness, the new concept can automate service selection and
facilitate the transparency of interoperations in organiza-
tions. Christidis and Devetsikiotis (2016) indicate that the
combination of IoT and blockchains will lead to significant
transformation for industries, and envision that the workflow
can be automated, sharing of services can be more secure,
and cost savings can be achieved. Kshetri (2017) indicate that
the blockchain-based solutions are superior to the current IoT
ecosystem. To strengthen the IoT, regulators should make it
obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain,
use blockchain to protect privacy by using this technology,
move attention to public–private partnerships and national
government should provide more information to let people
engage in the smart contracts. Lu and Xu (2017) address
the need to trace the origin of products in a complex supply
chain. By introducing blockchain technology, the transpar-
ent, tamper-proof metadata infrastructure could be trusted by
all the involved parties and be adaptable to changing environ-
ments and regulations.Yoo andWon (2018) propose a system
based on blockchain and smart contracts to track the price
portion of supply chain management systems to improve
the transparency of the product distribution structure. Gao
et al. (2018) develop a blockchain-based privacy preserv-
ing payment mechanism for vehicle-to-grid networks. The
mechanism introduces a registration and data maintenance
process based on the blockchain technique. Huang et al.
(2019) introduce an optimal charging scheduling algorithm
for hybrid vehicle charging scenarios and emerging mobile
charging vehicles. The proposed optimal charging schedul-
ing framework based on consortium blockchains ensures the
security and privacy of electricity trading. Muzammal et al.
(2019) propose an open-source system possessing decentral-
ized, distributed and audibility features of the blockchain. It
has quick query processing and well-designed data structure
of the distributed databases. Zhu et al. (2019) propose a cloud
health resource-sharingmodel, in which the blockchain tech-
nology is employed to provide consensus mechanisms and
value sharing to overcome challenges existing in healthcare
delivery.
From the perspective of cloud manufacturing, limited
efforts on adopting blockchain technology have also been
made. Li et al. (2018) propose a new cloud manufactur-
ing architecture, which employs the blockchain technology
to enhance the security, scalability of the cloud-based sys-
tem. Bahga and Madisetti (2016) propose a platform for
blockchain-based Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The
platform employs blockchain technology to provide trust for
cloud-based manufacturing. The limited pioneering works
portray a promising prospect for blockchain technology in
cloud manufacturing. Nevertheless, many issues related to
this broad concept need to be addressed so that blockchain
technology and cloud manufacturing can generate syn-
ergy. One critical issue is the pricing strategies for service
providers in the system, and this is the focal point of this
research.
Order bidding and pricing inmanufacturing systems
Pricing and bidding strategies are critical to manufacturers.
There is a wealth of study in literature on this subject. As
such, only a few representative works are summarized as
follows. Gu et al. (1997) propose a bidding-based approach
that integrates computer-aided design, process planning,
and real-time scheduling. When more than one device is
qualified for the needs, a negotiation mechanism will take
effect. Theodosiou and Katsikeas (2001) study the pric-
ing strategies followed by manufacturing subsidiaries of
multinational corporations. The authors investigate the fac-
tors which play an essential role in determining the degree
of international pricing strategy standardization. Galbraith
et al. (2008) investigate the technical strategies of 44 small
and medium-sized high-tech manufacturing companies in
Scotland and the impact of regional and specific regional
infrastructure requirements on their location behavior. Lim
and Zhang (2012) introduce a currency-based iterative agent
bidding mechanism to achieve an optimized process plan
and schedule by integrating the activities associated with
production planning and control effectively and cost effi-
ciently. As such, the agility of manufacturing systems can
123
1988 Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1985–2002
be enhanced to accommodate dynamic changes in the mar-
ket and production. Kreye et al. (2013) propose an interview
study with industrialists from manufacturing companies fac-
ing the change of market structures towards servitization.
This interview study focuses on exploring the information of
manufacturing companies when competitively bidding for
service. Takano et al. (2014) develop a stochastic optimiza-
tion methodology to obtain the optimal bidding strategy,
which considers the negative effect of inaccurate cost esti-
mate on the pricing. It is indicated that profit margin can be
improved if the markup is set based on the cost estimation
accuracy.
Moreover, Anselmi et al. (2017) propose a three-tier mar-
ket model to study the interaction of price competition and
congestion in the cloud computing marketplace. Capturing a
marketplace with users purchasing services from Software-
as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS)
or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Using these character-
izations to understand the “price of anarchy” of the cloud
marketplace.WangandZhang (2017) comprehensively study
the production strategy of remanufacturers, and decision
models with loan and without loans are constructed to ana-
lyze pricing and profit. Other related studies on pricing
strategies for remanufacturers include Xu and Liu (2017),
where the effect of reference price on remanufacturer’s profit
is investigated, and Jung and Hwang (2011), where the
optimal pricing is determined based on competition and
cooperation. In addition,Meng andXu (2018) provide a clas-
sification of value metrics and metrics for pricing decisions
in the product lifecycle, such as design, manufacturing, and
service phases. Also, a pricing method is proposed to for-
mulate the regression relationship between pricing variables
and prices. Khosroshahi et al. (2019) introduce the impact
of transparency on the demand function, and investigate the
effect of transparency and corporate social responsibility on
the pricing decisions of the members of a supply chain.
Cloud-basedmanufacturing with blockchain
technology
Cloud-based manufacturing service with blockchain integra-
tion is a novel peer-to-peer model, consisting of abundant
interconnected and virtualizedmanufacturing resources. The
system inherits the advantages of cloud manufacturing, and
enhances the core values of cloudmanufacturing by adopting
open source consensus algorithms on all activities, sharing
system value throughout all participants, ensuring trust with-
out reliance on a trusted third party, and enabling low-cost
global payments.
As mentioned earlier, a blockchain system is a distributed
storage system, also called a distributed ledger. This dis-
tributed ledger consists of a technically unlimited number
of blocks which are chained together in chronological order
(Leiding et al. 2016). It enables immutability, and integrity of
data in blocks which contains a record of transactions made
in a system. Those sequential blocks are maintained across
multiple distributed nodes that are linked in a peer-to-peer
network (Viriyasitavat and Hoonsopon 2019). Decentral-
ization, trustful, safety, global payment, and consensus
mechanism are the main characteristics of blockchain sys-
tems. This model features a consortium blockchain structure.
In the model, each participant is pre-proved by a consensus
algorithm based smart contract. Users are not authorized to
create blocks such that block verification is not necessary
to rely on the computing power competition. In this model,
proof of authority (PoA) (DeAngelis et al. 2018) is employed
as the consensus algorithm. POA algorithm reaches con-
sensus among arbitrarily selected trustworthy entities in the
blockchain, and thus this algorithm is efficient and scalable.
In the meantime, the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algo-
rithm is employed to verify the correctness of transactions. A
crypto-currency system, called cloud manufacturing crypto-
currency (CMCC), is born with the proposed system.
Figure 1 shows the schematic of the new cloud-based
manufacturing system. The manufacturing resources such as
machines, computers, and logistics are accordingly regarded
as infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Through open source
consensus algorithms, the manufacturing resources are dig-
italized as virtual machines (VM) or virtual services. The
information of those virtual resources is recorded on the
blockchain. In the system, many platforms provide per-
sonalized services for users according to the open source
consensus algorithm standard. At the same time, many appli-
cations (App), decentralized applications (DApp), and other
software are provided to users. This software as a service
(SaaS) mechanism allows users to access the cloud manu-
facturing resources in a convenient and efficient manner. The
knowledge service in the figure is a support service based on
the decisions by consensus, and it provides the decision sup-
port during the process. Also, in the figure, the purple dotted
lines illustrate the process of a service request being fulfilled.
The brown dotted lines represent the data exchange between
the blockchain based cloud and other components. Mean-
while, the service request flow is extracted and labelled with
process steps, as shown in Fig. 2.
As indicated by service flow steps 1 and 2 shown in Fig. 2,
users submit requests for service via a DApp, and the trans-
action information will be recorded on the blockchain and
the manufacturing data will be uploaded to an Oracle system
which is used to guarantee the data safety. In service flow step
3, each request will be allocated to a signer server according
to the consensus algorithm. Service flow steps 4 and 5 indi-
cate that computing can be organized by the signer server to
recommend a service provider for the request. All devices
with idle computing power can be involved in the comput-

ing. A computing reward will automatically be transferred
to the users who are successfully engaged in the comput-
ing—the reward is paid by system mining rewards (Pass and
Shi 2017). Thereafter, the recommended provider receives
job information with CMCC payment for the job as shown
by service flow step 6. In the meantime, the manufacturing
schedule is updated by the blockchain cloud manufactur-
ing system. Finally, according to the task information and
machine information on the blockchain, logistics will be
arranged andmanufacturedproductswill be delivered as indi-
cated by service flow steps 7 and 8. Meanwhile, Fig. 2 shows
that the signers sign the information of the transaction steps
(1)–(4) in the blockchain peer-to-peer network. For instance,
the costs of recommendation, the production prepayments,
and the cost of logistics all need to be confirmed by consensus
and stored on the blockchain.
In addition, after the product is delivered to the user, the
user can evaluate the service. As shown in Fig. 1, an arbi-
tration committee is available in the system. The service
provider who does not agree with the evaluation from the
user can submit the arbitration request. However, this paid
arbitration request does not guarantee a favored result to the
provider—the arbitration committee members vote based on
the recorded information in the blockchain system.

with blockchain technology can be implemented for many

manufacturing scenarios such as CNC (computer numerical
control) machining, sheet metal forming, injection molding,
etc. However, the arguably most suitable pilot service for
any cloud-basedmanufacturing is the additivemanufacturing
(3D printing) service (Mai et al. 2016; Yao et al. 2016). This
is because additive manufacturing simplifies the manufactur-
ing procedure into a single step production for small batch
production, and it also shortens the supply chain for partman-
ufacturing. Also, additive manufacturing is rooted with the
nature of digital manufacturing, where the digital fabrication
instruction is generated from the digital design of 3D solid
model, and the fabrication is highly automated. In addition,
additivemanufacturingmachines are typically equippedwith
computing resources and network capability. As such, this
study adopts the additive manufacturing scenario to investi-
gate the provider pricing strategies and how they affect the
revenue and efficiency of the individual providers and the
system as a whole.
The peer to peer cloud environment is simulated by
Ethereum which is an open source blockchain system. The
system uses the consortium chain structure which employs
the Proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm to sign the
blocks. Five signers are created with the genesis file which
is the first block and stores the initial configuration of the
blockchain. 100 user accounts are designed to generate the
job requests, and 20 machine accounts are created to mimic
the virtual machine (VM) service. Table 1 shows that the
20 machines belong to 10 types of additive manufacturing
machines, which are all commercially availablemachines for
making functional metal parts. Each machine is also called a
provider. One CMCC is assumed to have an identical value
of one hundred dollars. In this scenario, the arbitration of
service evaluation is not considered. Also, we assume that
each job request only contains the need to fabricate one part.
Additive manufacturing considerations
For simplicity, the manufacturing lead time (in hours) for a
job request (Tpay) is estimated byEq. (1), inwhich,V donates
the volume of task, Rb donates the build rate of provider for
the task, Rmin
b donates the build rate of the smallest machine,
Tp donates the combined pre- and post- processing time of
the provider, Tmin
p donates the base machine preparation and
post processing time, which is assumed to be 1 h in this
study.

The total cost (Ct ) estimation includes material cost
(Cm), machine time cost (CM ), labor time cost (Cl ), and
any additional cost (Ca). Ct can be computed by Eq. (2),
in which, d donates the density of the material, and p
donates the unit material cost, Pmin
m donates the unit machine
time cost (CMCC/h) for the smallest machine, and Pmin
l
donates the unit labor time cost (CMCC/h) of the smallest
machine.

In this simulation, we assume the product quality can be
normalized as a single index which has a range of [0,1] in
which, where 0 represents the worst quality and 1 represents
the best quality. Also, a simplified relationship between the
quality index and build rate (Rb) is assumed, which states
that the decrease of build rate leads to the increase in qual-
ity index, and the quality index will not increase any more
when the build rate is lower than the threshold build rate (Rs)
(Letenneur et al. 2019). Each VM can adopt a quality index
value between the maximum quality index (Qmax) and min-
imum quality index (Qmin). Therefore, the quality index can
be computed based on Eq. (3), in which Rmax is the maxi-
mum build rate of a machine. Each machine is supposed to
employ the largest possible build rate that satisfies the quality
index requirement.

Meanwhile, a simple maintenance policy is considered in
the simulation. Under this policy, a machine will be stopped
for 50 h for maintenance and restoration after every 1000 h
of work, and no machine degradation is considered during
the 1000 h of work.
Provider pricing strategy
As mentioned before, each additive manufacturing machine
is regarded as a service provider. The providers need to
respond to a job request with a bid that consists of a charging
price and an estimated delivery time. The cloud manufactur-
ing system needs to recommend the most suitable provider
for any job request from customers. Here, we assume that
the job requests are always accepted, and the system is the
only place available that provides additivemanufacturing ser-
vices.
The inter-arrival time of generated tasks is estimated by
a Poisson random function. The average task inter-arrival
time (MPoisson) in minute is calculated by Eq. (4), in which
Mcapabili t y donates the average of processing capability,
Mvolume donates the mean of task volume, β is a correc-
tion coefficient for adjusting the mean inter-arrival time, and
hence the amount of job requests in a given time.
MPoisson � Mvolume
Mcapabili t y
∗ β ∗ 60, (4)
Also, the volume and dimension limits of the part design
of each job request are generated by uniform distribution
random functions.
The providers are also called players in a game theoretic
approach. Since the proposed system is consensus-oriented
and aims to provide a fair platform for the participants, it
has the capability to limit the irrational vicious competition
by consensus mechanism. As such, in this study, we assume
that all players are Non-Zero-Sum and completely rational.
A rational degree is signed to each player. The range of the
rational degree is [0,1] in which 0 donates the least rational,
and 1 grants the most intelligent. Two policies are designed.
One is for the situation that the information of other players
is unknown to each other. The other is that the knowledge of
other players is known to the players who are within a limited
Euclidean space. Each player has a range of overhead rate to
make the bidding offer which is related to its rational degree.
Meanwhile, considering the system overall efficiency and
cooperation, a lower limit and an upper limit on pricing are
enforced.
Policy one
Under this policy, the basic information of a machine (e.g.,
themachine specifications and locations) is unknown to other
players. Players consider both their machine capabilities and
their production situation to determine their quotation prices
for service requests. In considering their machine capabil-
ities, it is reasonable to assume the following aggressive
modes,
• Large additive manufacturingmachines would charge pre-
mium price for large size jobs inwhich the part dimensions
are beyond the build size limits of smaller additive man-
ufacturing machines in the system. Meanwhile, they are
willing to make less profit in competing for medium size
jobs, and even less in competing for small size jobs.
• Medium additive manufacturing machines may not have
much room to give in for medium size jobs, but are willing
to bid low for small size jobs.
• Small additive manufacturing machines, due to their dis-
advantage in build size limit, do not have room for price
reduction for small size jobs.
Also, the players consider their production situation in
their pricing strategies. The basic principle is that they have
the incentive to charge less when they are less busy, and vice
versa. The detailed mechanism is shown by the fuzzy algo-
rithm in the next section. In this case, the following pricing
strategies are developed,
• Players prepare low prices by adjusting parameters such
as the overhead rate to increase the chance of winning a

bid when they are not busy, and large and medium sized
machines will be in aggressive mode.
• Players prepare bids which enable them to make a normal
profit when their workload is at a normal level.
• Players adopt “profit making” as the priority and present
high price bids when they are already very busy in produc-
tion and have a long waiting list, and large and medium
sized machines will not be in aggressive mode.
Policy two
Under this policy, the basic information of the machines is
restrictedly known to each other. The aggressivemodes of the
large and middle sized machines are not considered. How-
ever, the pricing is decided based on the history price of near
neighbors of theEuclidean space,which includes four dimen-
sions which are location, size limits, build rate, and history
unit price. The following rules are adopted.
• Players prepare low prices by adjusting parameters such
as the overhead rate to increase the chance of winning a
bid when they are not busy. Such a price is based on the
player’s lowest bid, the average recent price of the near
neighbors, and the player’s rational degree;
• Players prepare bids which enable them to make a normal
profitwhen theirworkload is at a normal level. Such a price
is based on the player’s normal bid, the average recent price
of the near neighbors, and the player’s rational degree;
• Players adopt “profit making” as the priority and present
high price bids when they are very busy. Such a price is
based on the player’s highest bid, the average recent price
of the near neighbors, and the player’s rational degree.
Simulation implementation
Figure 3 shows the flow chart for simulating additive manu-
facturing services based on the aforementionedmodel.When
a job request arrives, the providers (or players, or machines)
123
Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1985–2002 1993
prepare the bid by offering the price and delivery time. The
system employs a recommendation algorithm to select the
most suitable provider. The existing recommendation algo-
rithms, which are supported on a distributed network, have
the potential to be adopted. Such algorithms include collabo-
rative filtering (Feng andHuang 2018),K-medoids clustering
(Deng et al. 2019), genetic algorithm (Nara et al. 1992), prob-
abilistic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (PMOEA)
(Cui et al. 2017), K nearest neighbor (KNN) (Adeniyi et al.
2016), and so on.According to literature (Zhu et al. 2019; Tan
2006;Li et al. 2009;Wuet al. 2019; Teixidor et al. 2015;Chen
and Wu 2017; Samworth 2012), KNN is regarded as a sim-
ple, mature, robust, and popular recommendation algorithm,
which supports the distributed nodes in a peer-to-peer net-
work. As such, in this research, this algorithm is adopted as
the recommendation algorithm. The three nearest neighbors
of the KNN algorithm includes total cost, time, and evalua-
tion (or reputation). The weight coefficients are set as w ∈
{[0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.45, 0.45, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]}, indicating
that we assume that the evaluation (or reputation) carries the
lowest weight. It can be seen that we keep the reputation
weight as a constant and leave the sensitivity analysis on this
weight for a possible future extension. For the eighteen oper-
ation conditions as Table 2, the same duration of time (i.e.,
5000 h) is adopted in all simulation runs for a fair compari-
son. Three levels of demand generation (or system load) are
considered, with the first level being equal to 60% of the sys-
tem capacity in a unit time, the second level being equal to
80% of the system capacity in a unit time, and the third level
being equal to 100% of the system capacity in a unit time.
For each system load level, a total of 20 simulation runs are
executed and averages are taken to gauge the performance of
individual providers and the system as a whole.
Lead time (TL ) of the job is calculated by Eq. (5), where
Ts represents the time needed to finish scheduled works; Tp
represents the production time for the job; Tl represents the
logistic delivery time for the job; V represents the volume
materials of job; Rb is the build rate according to the job qual-
ity requirement; ζ is a normal distribution random variable
which is to estimate the variation of uncertain production
time in real word; η represents a base time for logistics; λ
represents the logistics time increase rate with respect to the
relative distance. Here, it is assumed that the minimum logis-
tic time is 24 h, and the maximum logistic time is 120 h.
Thus, η and λ are set to 24 and 96, respectively; d represents
the distance from the current user to the current provider;
dmin represents the overall shortest distance from the users
to providers in system; dmax represents the overall longest
distance from the users to providers.

A fuzzy algorithm is designed for players to choose the
pricing strategies. Figure 4 shows a membership function for
pricing strategy selection. The membership of pricing strat-
egy has three states: strategy one, strategy two, and strategy
three. The fuzzy output for strategy one would be “1.0 strat-
egy one” up to 70% and go linearly to “0.0 strategy one” at
90%. The fuzzy output for strategy two would be a trape-
zoidal membership function starting at “0.0 strategy two” at
70%, going to “1.0 strategy two” at 90%”, continuing to “1.0
strategy two” at 110%, and then linearly going to “0.0 strat-
egy two” at 130%. The fuzzy output for strategy three would
be “1.0 strategy three” at 100% to 130% and would go to
“0.0 strategy three” at 110%.
For Policy one, aggressive mode is launched by the fuzzy
function. Figure 5 shows a membership function for aggres-
sive mode. The membership of aggressive mode has two
states: aggressive mode and non-aggressive mode. The fuzzy
output for strategy one would be “1.0 aggressive mode” up to
70% and go linearly to “0.0 aggressive mode” at 130%. The
fuzzy output for non-aggressive mode would be “1.0 non-
aggressive mode” at 100% to 130% and would go to “0.0
strategy three” at 70%.

Defuzzification takes the fuzzy output value and converts
it to a crisp value for use in the real world. There are many
methods for defuzzification. In this study, we employ the
center of gravity method (Hellendoorn and Thomas 1993).

The quoted price (q) of each provider under Policy one is
calculated by Eq. (6), in which,Ct is calculated by Eq. (1); f

The quoted price (q) of each provider under Policy two
is calculated by Eqs. (8) and (9), in which, f (V ) is used to
compute the quote of job; V represents the material volume

In addition, providers will receive an evaluation after a
finished job is delivered. In this study, we adopt a simple
metric to calculate the evaluation score (e) of a customer, as

Simulation results and discussion
As aforementioned, for each simulation run, job requests are
generated and processed for 5000 h. Figure 6 shows the total
average revenues obtained under each operation condition
for the system. According to Table 2, condition indices 1–6
represent the cases in which the demand generation equals
to 60 percent of the system capacity; Condition indices 7–12
represent the cases in which the demand generation equals to
80 percent of the system capacity; Condition indices 13–18
represent the cases in which the demand generation equals
to 100 percent of the system capacity. Meanwhile, an odd
number of condition index indicates the adoption of Policy
one, and an even number of condition index indicates the
adoption of Policy two. Some interesting observations are
described as follows.
System revenue and individual provider revenues
First of all, the results show that the increase of demand gen-
eration leads to the increase of average system revenue when
Conditions 1, 7, & 13, or 2, 8, & 14, or 3, 9, & 15, or 4, 10,
123
Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (2020) 31:1985–2002 1995
Fig. 6 Average overall system
revenue under eighteen
operation conditions
& 16, or 5, 11, & 17, or 6, 12, & 18 are compared. This is
expected because more job requests are generated and pro-
cessed by the system in the fixed time. However, the increase
of average total revenue is not linear to the increase of demand
generation– the increase of revenue becomes insignificant
when the demand generation increases from 80 to 100% of
the system capacity. Take Conditions 1, 7 & 13 for example,
when the demand increases from 60 to 80% of the system
capacity, the system revenue increases by 230,018 CMCC,
while the revenue increase reduces to 52,937 CMCC when
the demand increases from80 to 100%of the systemcapacity.
This indicates that after the demand generation reaches 80%
of the system capacity, the extra job requests generated and
accepted by the system do not translate into revenue growth
for the system in the fixed amount of time. In other words,
the system is already very occupied and most of the extra
jobs are added to the queues instead of being processed on
time by the providers.
Secondly, pairwise comparisons from the condition pairs
1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8, 9 & 10, 11 & 12, 13 & 14,
15 & 16, or 17 & 18 indicate that when other conditions are
kept constant, Policy two generate significant higher average
system revenue than Policy one. By shifting from Policy one
to Policy two, the revenue increase ranges from 273,719 to
400,087 CMCC for the 9 comparison pairs, and the average
increase is 339,523CMCC. Itmeans that the revenue changes
as a results of policy change are significant among all pairs
regardless of other conditions. In addition, the effect of KNN
weights can be revealed when Conditions 1, 3, & 5, or 2, 4
& 6, or 7, 9 & 11, or 8, 10 & 12, or 13, 15 & 17, or 14, 16
& 18 are compared. In this case, it can be observed that the
overall influence of the KNN weights is not significant, but
the system revenue seems to slightly increase with theweight
decrease in quoted price and the weight increase in delivery
time. Take Conditions 1, 3, & 5 for example, for the weights
of quoted price at 0.7, 0.45, and 0.2, the system revenues are
1,027,594, 1,055,217, and 1,092,025 CMCC, respectively.
Figure 7 shows the average revenueof individual providers
under the 18 conditions. It is not surprising that there exists
an overall trend among all the 18 sub-figures, that is, the
revenue of a provider increases with the capacity (reflected
by the build rate and build size) of the provider. It should
be noted that many small sized machines (providers) hardly
generate any revenues in the simulation process. In extreme
cases, some of them have zero revenue, such as Providers 2
and 4 under Condition 4. It implies that those providers are
not competitive in the system, and thus their capacities should
not be included in the system capacities. Meanwhile, it can
also be observed that for individual providers, their revenues
generally increase when the demand generation grows from
60 to 80% of the system capacity, while the growth levels off
when the demand generation grows from 80 to 100% of the
system capacity. This again indicates that for most machines
(providers), there are already enough orders accepted and
waited to be processed when the demand generation rate
is high, and any further increase will not bring significant
revenue increase for the individual providers. Also, it can
be discovered that the revenues of individual providers are
fairly close to one another with three different KNN weight
options. As such, the system revenue is not very sensitive to
the KNN weights, and the individual provider revenue is not
sensitive to the KNN weights too.
Waiting time andmachine utilization
Waiting time is another indicator of system efficiency.
More importantly, waiting time can be often used as a
reflection of customer satisfaction. Figure 8 shows the aver-
age waiting time of providers on 18 operation conditions.
The results indicate that all three parameters have signifi-

cant influence on the waiting time of individual providers.
The increase of demand generation most notably causes the
increase of waiting time for the machines. Take Provider 19
for example, when Policy one and KNN weights [0.7, 0.2,
0.1] are adopted, the average job waiting times are about
125, 550, and 980 h at the demand generation equals to 60%,
80%, and 100%of system capacity, respectively.Meanwhile,
the selection of Policy one or two also significantly changes
the job waiting time for many machines. For instance, when
Conditions 1 and 2 are compared, it can be found that the
magnitude and distribution of job waiting time is changed to
certain extent. Comparison of other pairs gives rise to similar
observations. In addition, it is discovered that the choice of
KNN weights also affects the job waiting time of individual
machines. This effect of KNN weights on waiting time is
clearly more significant than those on system and individual
revenues.
To evaluate the performance of the system and individual
machines, machine utilization is another metric to look at.
Figure 9 shows themachine utilization of each provider under
the eighteen operation conditions. When the demand gener-
ation is at 60% of system capacity, 4 or 5 machines already
have higher than 90% of utilization, which in turn leads to
longer waiting time on those machines. With the demand
generation increased to 80% of system capacity, the over-
all machine utilization further grows—the majority of the
machines have close to 100% utilization. Such high utiliza-
tion usually means very long queue for those machines, and
thus the job waiting time increases dramatically, as reflected
in Fig. 8. When the demand generation reaches 100% of sys-
tem capacity, the machine utilization still increases but it has
little room for the vast majority of the machines in the sys-
tem, because it is capped at 100%. However, the very small
increase in this range will still leads to a significant increase
in jobwaiting time for individualmachines, as reflected again
in Fig. 8. Furthermore, it appears that the selection of pric-
ing Policy one or two still has pronounced impact on the
utilizations of most individual machines when the demand
generation is at 60% of system capacity. On the other hand,
it only has significant influence on the utilizations of small
sized machines when the demand generation is at 80% or
higher of system capacity, in that the utilizations of large
sized machines are already close to 100%.
Evolution of transaction price
Figure 10 illustrates the evolution of transaction price and
price limits per unit printing volume under Condition 1 for
Providers 9 and 20, respectively. Recall that this condition
adopts pricingPolicy one,KNNweights of [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], and
the demand generation equal to 60% of system capacity. It
can be observed that the transaction unit price, the minimum
and maximum unit price offerings under consideration are
all dynamic because the job requests generated are random.
The two providers appear to behave differently in pricing.
For Provider 9, it offers a price between the minimum and
maximum unit price considerations for most of time. A care-
ful examination reveals that the price offered and accepted
are overall closer to the maximum unit price instead of the
minimum unit price. The observations are reasonable and
verify the designed pricing mechanism. Figure 8 shows that
Providers 9 and 20 have the average job waiting times of 34
and 130 h, respectively. Figure 9 shows that Providers 9 and
20 have the utilizations of 60% and 96%, respectively. Both
information indicates that Provider 9 has longer idle time,
and is more willing to lower price in bidding, while Provider
20 is consistently occupied, and intends to offer a higher
price in bidding. The behaviors of both Providers 9 and 20
somehow indicate that the system reaches equilibrium.
Conclusions
In this research, we introduce a framework of consensus-
oriented blockchain based cloud manufacturing, in which
the scenario of global additive manufacturing service is con-
sidered. As a new attempt, blockchain technology is used
to address the long-standing problems in cloud manufactur-
ing models. The nature of blockchain technology empowers
cloud manufacturing with distinct features such as consen-
sus, trust and security, and accessible global payments, and
mitigate many issues facing the traditional cloud manufac-
turing models.
More importantly, the critical issue of pricing strategy
for service providers is for the first time investigated in
such a system. In that context, nonzero-sum rational game
is employed for pricing, the load levels at 60%, 80%, and
100% of system capacity are considered, and the sensitiv-
ity to KNN weights (of recommendation algorithm) is also
studied. The system performance is investigated based on
revenue, waiting time, and machine utilization. It is found
that the pricing policy greatly affects the revenue of the sys-
tem and individual providers, and it has modest effect on
waiting and machine utilization. Also, the increase of system
load from 60 to 80% helps to grow the system and individ-
ual revenue modestly, increases the machine utilization to
higher than 90% for majority of machines, and increases
the job waiting time significantly. The further increase of
system load to 100% no longer helps to grow revenue but
continue to increase the job waiting time. On the other hand,
the KNNweight change does not seem to significantly affect
the system revenue, individual provider revenues, ormachine
utilization, while it does affect the waiting time for individ-
ual providers. In addition, the detailed pricing evolution is
examined, which reveals that the system can reach an equi-
librium.

Nevertheless, the concept of cloud-based manufacturing
with blockchain technology has not been realized in any com-
mercial systems to the best of our knowledge. As such, a
major limitation of this research is the lack of data from
real-world operations to validate the system design and pro-
posed mechanisms. This situation will be improved after the
concept has adopted for pilot commercial applications and
then become more mature. Meanwhile, in the future, studies
should be extended for the proposed framework. Issues to be
addressedmay include the crypto-currencydesign, the imple-
mentation of standards in consensus-oriented peer-to-peer
environment, the consensus algorithms for the system, and
the value sharing mechanism. In addition, it is worthwhile
to enhance the blockchain technology for cloud manufactur-
ing applications in terms of privacy protection in distributed
ledgers and development of high efficiency and secure con-
sensus algorithms.
