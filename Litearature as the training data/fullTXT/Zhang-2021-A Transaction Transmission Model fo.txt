A Transaction Transmission Model for Blockchain Channels
 
 
1 
Abstract—Transactions in blockchain networks can be 
transmitted through channels. Existing methods for channel 
transaction transmission depend on transaction routing 
information. If a node randomly chooses a channel to transmit 
a transaction, the transmission may be aborted due to 
insufficient funds (also called balance) or low transmission rate. 
To increase transmission success rate and reduce transmission 
delay across all transactions, this work proposes a transaction 
transmission model for blockchain channels based on non-
cooperative game theory. The model considers the channel 
balance, states, and nodes’ channel preferences. Steady-state 
transmission rates of selected channels are analyzed. The ideal 
solution for the model is found.  
Index Terms—Blockchain channel, transaction transmission, 
insufficient channel balance, channel state, nodes’ channel 
preferences, non-cooperative game 
I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Background 
Blockchains without permission, such as Bitcoin [1] and 
Ethereum [2], allow any participant to join or leave at any 
time. They have gained various applications [3, 4, 5]. They 
replace trusted third parties with a peer-to-peer network in 
which peers may not trust each other. However, their 
scalability is highly limited [6, 7]. For example, a Bitcoin 
system consisting of blockchain nodes takes an average of 
10 minutes to confirm new transactions [8]. Thus, channel 
technology becomes one of the primary methods to improve 
blockchain scalability [9]. Through peer-to-peer channels, 
transactions can be processed off-chain instead of on-chain 
[10]. A channel network is composed of multiple channels 
and nodes, where each channel may have some available 
funds, i.e., channel balance. Channel balances are deposited 
in a multi-signature address that is managed by both nodes 
of a channel. After a transaction is transmitted through a 
channel, the balance in the channel decreases as the 
transmitted transaction and nodes write their final balances 
into their accounts. Nodes can transmit several transactions 
through channels and settle the final balances to the 
blockchain in the end. Hence, channel technology can be 
used to increase the transaction throughput and reduce 
delays, thus effectively improving blockchain scalability. 
B. Typical Channels 
Existing channels mainly fall into payment and state 
ones [11]. 
1. Payment channel: It allows nodes to establish a 
direct point-to-point payment so that nodes can maintain 
and update their ledgers privately. Its examples are as 
follows: a) Spilman payment channel: Spilman [12] 
introduces a channel payment protocol based on a Bitcoin 
system that realizes the instant confirmation of transactions. 
During a channel payment process, the funds for transaction 
receivers always increase and the receivers only publish 
their latest channel states on-chain. The protocol supports 
one-way payment only but not reverse payment one. b) 
Duplex micro-payment channel [13]: It extends Spilman’s 
one-way payment to two-way one to realize high scalability 
for digital payments in a Bitcoin system. The time lock 
function of Bitcoin transactions makes transaction 
transmission through duplex micropayment channels safe. 
However, the use of time lock does not allow channel 
balances to be used until the time lock threshold is reached, 
even if the transmission is complete. Hence, using such a 
channel causes long waiting times for transactions to 
transmit. c) Lightning channel [14]: It is the first one to 
form a payment network (called a Lightning network) with 
payment channels and improves the transaction throughput 
of a blockchain while realizing two-way payment. It can 
transfer payment between two nodes through such a 
channel. Nodes adopt the shortest link algorithm to select a 
path to transmit transactions. However, it fails to consider 
the problems related to insufficient channel balances. d) 
Raiden channel [15]: It can implement complex intelligent 
contracts on Ethereum and supports one-way payments. 
Some smart contracts may block certain tokens of 
counterparties in Raiden, which leads to poor scalability.

2. State channel: It results from the optimization of a 
payment channel by supporting arbitrarily complex smart 
contracts and allowing participants to safely modify the 
locked part of blockchain states. Its examples include: a) 
Sprites channel: Miller et al. [16] propose Sprites channels 
to improve the efficiency of the Lightning network. They 
can minimize the worst-case collateral (channel balance) 
and transmission time costs of off-chain payments. b) 
Revive channel: To handle the problem of insufficient 
channel balances, Khalil et al. [17] introduce a Revive 
channel. They implement a persistent mechanism based on 
linear programming to adjust its balance among 
intermediate nodes in a blockchain network. However, they 
face a computational complexity issue and fail to consider 
nodes’ channel preferences. c) Perun channel: This channel 
creates a virtual platform without interacting with 
intermediate transmission nodes for each payment [18]. 
Dziembowski et al. [19] extend it and introduce a fully 
virtual state channel with arbitrary length, further reducing 
the delay and cost of transaction transmissions through such 
channels. 
The above analysis indicates that channel technology is 
a feasible solution to improve the scalability of blockchains. 
All prior channels face three challenging issues: a) how to 
increase the transmission success rate when there are 
channels with insufficient balances; b) how to decrease the 
transaction transmission delay when there are channels at 
unavailable states (i.e., a channel cannot transmit a 
transaction); and c) how to increase the transmission 
success rate and decrease the delay resulting from nodes’ 
channel preferences. 
C. Motivation 
The motivation of this work is to increase the 
transmission success rate and decrease delays by addressing 
the following three critical issues via a transaction 
transmission model: 
1. Insufficient channel balance: As channel balance 
may be insufficient due to a decrease in its transaction 
transmission, channels may fail to transmit a transaction 
and result in long wait time. This may cause low 
transmission success rate and prolonged transmission delay. 
Channels in [13, 14] face the problem of insufficient 
channel balance and may fail to complete transaction 
transmissions. 
2. Unavailable state: This means that a channel cannot 
transmit a transaction, which may be because a channel is 
busy transmitting another transaction and cannot be 
selected, indicating that other transactions need to wait until 
it is free. If the waiting time is too long, the transmission of 
these transactions may be aborted due to their transmission 
deadline. This may cause long transmission delays and low 
transmission success rates. For channels in [16, 23], the 
worst-case is usually caused by failing to reasonably 
consider the impact of a channel’s unavailable state on 
transaction transmission. 
3. Nodes’ channel preferences: Nodes may prefer 
channels with high transmission probability defined as the 
probability to transmit at least one transaction within a time 
slot. This may cause the preferred channels’ balances to be 
continuously consumed and eventually cause a failure of 
transaction transmission due to insufficient channel 
balances. In addition, multiple transactions may be waiting 
for these channels to transmit, leading to long delays. Both 
can hurt a transaction’s transmission success rate and cause 
delays. The channels in [18, 19] fail to address the problem 
caused by such channel preferences. 
In summary, most existing methods fail to improve the 
transaction transmission performance under insufficient 
balances, unavailable states, and nodes’ channel 
preferences. To solve these problems, we use non-
cooperative game theory [20] for the first time to propose a 
transaction transmission model for blockchain channels and 
make the following contributions: 
1) We formulate a transaction transmission model to 
optimize the transmission performance in channels by 
considering the channel balances, states, and nodes’ channel 
preferences. The model is based on non-cooperative games 
to find each channel’s Nash equilibrium point where the 
channel has its ideal transmission performance; and 
2) We provide theoretical proof of the proposed model 
by analyzing the non-linear characteristics of its function, 
including the existence and uniqueness of its Nash 
equilibrium point. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
proposes a transaction transmission model and analyses it. 
Section III draws conclusions and suggests future work. 
II. PROPOSED MODEL 
A uniform random blockchain channel network is given 
as 
G = < V, E > 
where V and E represent a set of nodes and channels, 
respectively, with N = |V| and M = |E|. 
A. Related Concepts 
In a blockchain channel network, transactions are 
completely independent and broadcast to the network. 
Source and target nodes select channels to establish 
transmission links (a link in brief, which includes one or 
more channels) to transmit a transaction. Transaction 
transmission is a random event that occurs independently in 
disjoint time slots and only happens once over a sufficiently 
small slot. Hence, we assume that transaction arrivals 
follow a Poisson process. Let T
t 
i  be the total time to 
transmit transactions through channel i ϵ {1, 2, ..., m} in a 
random time slot t, where m is the number of channels. Let 
T be the time interval between the end of the current 
transaction transmission and the start of the next through

each channel’s transmission time is assumed to follow an 
exponential distribution. The α
t 
i  is the probability for 
channel i to transmit at least one transaction within the time 
T
t

where i ϵ {1, 2, ..., m}. The channel states can be either 
available or unavailable. a) Available state: This indicates 
that a channel can transmit a transaction. b) Unavailable 
state: This indicates that a channel cannot transmit a 
transaction because it is busy or broken down. Many 
reasons cause channel transmission failure, such as closure 
by one party, insufficient channel balances, and damage due 
to attacks from malicious internal nodes. For a blockchain 
channel network, let Ts be the time slot for channel i to 
transmit a transaction in the available state: 
1
s dT T
m


where Td is the time slot to transmit a transaction through a 
channel in a blockchain network. Based on the two types of

  is the probability that channel i is at the 
unavailable state during time slot t, and Tf is the time slot of 
channel i in the unavailable state. Given a blockchain with 
m channels, if channel i is selected to transmit a transaction, 
the other m–1 channels cannot transmit it over the same 
time slot. 
1. Transmission time 
Let X
t 
i  be the average number of transactions that are 
successfully transmitted from a node through channel i 
during a unit time slot:

where S

2. Channel preference 
The channel preference of nodes can cause them to 
blindly select channels with a high transmission probability 
instead of one with an ideal probability. The ideal solution 
is the transmission probability corresponding to the solution 
as obtained by games. It is noted that this does not 
necessarily equal the highest transmission probability. To 
analyze the transmission success rate and delay, we use an 
indicator denoted as 
t 
i  to measure the deviation of the 
nodes’ channel preferences between the current and ideal 
transmission probability of channel i during time slot t: 

t 
i  = ki  | α
t 
i – γ
t 
i  |               (9) 
where ki is a correlation coefficient for node i’s channel 
preference with ki ≥ 0, and γ
t 
i  is a Nash equilibrium 
solution, i.e., the ideal transmission probability of channel 
i. Thus, a blockchain channel system can optimize the 
transaction transmission performance of channels to 
achieve an ideal transmission performance for the system. 
To increase the transmission success rate, nodes should 
select a channel with the ideal transmission probability. A 
smaller 
t 
i  gives a higher transmission success rate. If 
t 
i  is 
too large, the transmission probability of the selected 
channel may deviate from the ideal case, and the 
transmission may fail. 
The transaction transmission depends on the 
transmission probability of a channel as well as those of all 
its neighbors. The nodes’ channel preferences cause the 
channel network to make several transactions wait for the 
preferred channels to transmit them, which leads to long 
delays. Hence, we use non-cooperative games to avoid this 
problem and decrease the transmission time to achieve the 
ideal transmission performance. 
B. Transaction Transmission Model of Blockchain 
Channels 
A transaction transmission model is proposed based on 
non-cooperative game theory with four basic elements: 
Participants, strategy space, profit set, and Nash 
equilibrium points. Non-cooperative game theory describes 
individual learning and adaptation strategies and can 
provide Nash equilibrium solutions. The model is 
constructed based on the following four basic elements. 
Channels are taken as participants in non-cooperative 
games to optimize transmission performance for 
transactions by adjusting their strategies. Let I be the set of 
participants: 
I = {1, 2, 3, …, m}             (10)

Participants in a game are driven by their profits and 
transmit transactions based on the game results. The 
strategy space of each participant is a set of transmission 
probabilities for channel transactions during time slot t. Let 
𝜒 be the strategy space: 
𝜒= <α
t 
1, α
t 
2, ..., α
t 
i , ..., α
t 
m>          (11) 
where i ϵ I and α
t 
i  represent the transmission probability of 
channel i. Let α
t 
-i = <α
t 
1 , ..., α
t 
i−1, α
t 
i+1, ..., and α
t 
m> be the 
strategy space of the channels except for channel i. We 
propose a utility function to obtain a profit set. Let Ui

the normalized utility function of channel i during time slot 
t:

The profit set of non-cooperative games during time slot t 
is denoted as: 
Ʋ = {U1

where i ϵ I. The normalized utility function of channel i can 
be expressed as Ui
t (α

t 
-i), where (α
t 
i , α
t 
-i) is a strategic 
combination. 
4. Proposed model  
For the normalized utility function, a smaller 
transmission time and nodes’ channel preferences give a 
smaller deviation, which leads to an improved transmission 
performance for channel transactions. Let Θ be the 
proposed transaction transmission model for blockchain 
channels (the proposed model in brief):

where Eqs. (14)–(16) indicate that the transmission 
performance is affected by the transmission time and nodes’ 
channel preferences. It is noted that γ
t 
i  is the Nash 
equilibrium solution of channel i and γ
t 
i = argmin

γ
t 
-i  be the Nash equilibrium solution including the m–1 
channels except for channel i, and let (γ
t 
i , γ
t 
-i) be the Nash 
equilibrium point of the non-cooperative games. 
C. To Solve the Proposed Model 
1. Nash equilibrium points 
For non-cooperative games, the Nash equilibrium is a 
stable state, i.e., no participant can obtain better benefits by 
unilaterally changing its strategies and deviating from the 
Nash equilibrium. 
Definition 1: If the strategic combination (γ
t 
i , γ
t 
-i) is a 
Nash equilibrium point,  i ϵ I and γ
i
t ϵ 𝜒: 
Ui
t(γ
t 
i , γ
t 
-i) ≤ Ui
t(α
t 
i , γ
t 
-i)         (17) 
If Eq. (17) is satisfied, the transmission performance of 
channel transactions is ideal and its corresponding strategic 
combination is a Nash equilibrium point. It is noted that 
there may be more than one Nash equilibrium point. To 
prove that the proposed model has a unique minimum, we 
prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium 
point next.  
2. Simplified model  
Let U
t 
i  be a non-normalized utility function: 
t t t
i i i
U Φ = +                (18) 
As the normalized dimensionless operation does not 
affect the functional characteristics of the original function, 
the model Θ can be simplified as:

where Eqs. (15) and (16) are also the constraint of   . 
C. Obtaining Ideal Solution  
To obtain the ideal solution for the proposed model, we 
have the following results. 
Theorem 1: There is a Nash equilibrium point in the 
proposed model. 
Proof: We see from Eq. (1) that the utility function 
continuously varies with the strategy αi
t. The existence of a 
Nash equilibrium point belongs to the proof of the 
functional characteristics for the proposed model. The Θ 
and Θ′ are equivalent to the same non-linear characteristics. 
Thus, the proof of Θ can be achieved from the proof of Θ′. 
Firstly, we preprocess Eq. (19) of Θ′:

second partial derivative is greater than 0, which means that 
the first partial derivative increases monotonously and U

and is a strictly convex function in the strategy space. 
Therefore, the existence of the minimum makes Θ hold. 
When the utility function has a minimum value, γ
i
t  is a 
Nash equilibrium solution. Therefore, the existence of a 
Nash equilibrium point is proven. This result indicates that 
γ
t 
i  is a Nash equilibrium solution when the utility function 
is minimized. 
Theorem 2: The Nash equilibrium point in the proposed 
model is unique. 
Proof: Let L(α

where λi is a Lagrange factor, g(α

with constraints, and λi ≥ 0. According to convex 
optimization theory, the local ideal solution of a convex 
optimization problem is the global solution. The necessary 
condition that a point is a global minimum is to satisfy the 
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KTT) condition. When the objective 
function is convex, the KKT condition is also sufficient. 
The U

To analyze the distribution characteristics of the Nash

t = 1. Therefore, γ

t is the unique Nash 
equilibrium solution (i.e., the ideal transmission probability) 
of the proposed model and γ
i
t  ϵ (0, 1]. The model has a 
unique Nash equilibrium point at ( γ

t 
-i ). This result 
suggests that γ
t 
i  is the unique Nash equilibrium solution 
giving the ideal transmission probability of the proposed 
model with γ
t 
i ϵ (0, 1]. Thus, the unique Nash equilibrium 
point of the model is (γ
t 
i , γ
t 
-i). 
According to Theorems 1 and 2, the necessary and 
sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution 
for the proposed model is that ∂U

t 
i  = 0. That is, for a 
given α

Θ'' and Θ' are equivalent. Therefore, this work adopts the 
dual decomposition method to obtain the solution of Θ''. 
Firstly, the Lagrange equation of Θ'' is defined as: 
L(α

r 
i , νi ) = U
t 
i  + μ
r 
i (α
t 
i  – γ

i  – 1)    (34) 
where μ
r 
i  is the Lagrange multiplier of the r-th iteration of 
channel i. This gives μ
r 
i  ≥ 0 and νi ≥ 0. For a given μ
r 
i , the 
Lagrange dual-function Ld (α
t 
i , μ
r 
i ) is the maximized L(α
t 
i , μ
r 
i , νi ) about α
t 
i  and μ
r 
i , where (α
t 
i , μ
r 
i ) is a dual variable. Then, 
the Lagrange dual-problem model of Θ'' is defined as Θ‴: 
Θ‴: min{ ( , )} max{ ( , , )}
t r t r
d i i i i i
L L v   =     (35) 
We use an iterative sub-gradient method to obtain the 
solution of Θ‴ and update the Lagrange multiplier to find 
the final invariant Lagrange multiplier μ
r 
i . Given a set of 
non-negative μ
r 
i , the ideal solution for the transmission 
probability of the dual-function of Θ‴ is:

For a set of Lagrange multipliers, the gradient definition of 
the dual-function Ld (α

According to the iterative sub-gradient method, the 
Lagrange multiplier is updated using the gradient as: 
μ

t(αi

          (38) 
where [•]− = min (•), 𝜎 t 
μ  is the step size, ε is the upper 
bound of 𝜎t 
μ with ε > 0, and 𝜎t 
μ = ε/t. The 𝜎t 
μ causes the 
Lagrange multiplier to converge to a constant value of μ
r 
i  
after r iterations. Then, the ideal solution is solved. 
For Θ, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash 
equilibrium point are proven via Θ', which is equivalent to 
Θ. Θ'' is a simplified form of Θ', and Θ‴ is the Lagrange 
dual-problem model of Θ''. Therefore, we obtain the 
solution for Θ by solving Θ‴. As the ideal solution αi
∗ of 
Θ‴ can be obtained, we can obtain the ideal transmission 
probability of Θ to give the Nash equilibrium solution γ
t 
i . 
III. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In a blockchain channel network, we propose a 
transaction transmission model based on non-cooperative 
game theory to optimize the transmission performance for 
transactions. The proposed method considers the channel 
balances, states, and nodes’ channel preferences to improve 
the transmission success rate and decrease delays. The 
existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium point in 
the proposed model are proved. The result can be used to

guide each channel to find the Nash equilibrium point and 
achieve its ideal transmission performance and transmit a 
transaction. For each transaction, the ideal transmission link 
with the ideal transmission probability can be obtained from 
the equilibrium point. The correctness of the proposed 
method is validated through proof. As future work, we plan 
to further optimize the proposed method in terms of 
transmission overhead. We plan to apply the proposed 
model to e-commerce, enterprise systems, smart 
manufacturing, logistics and Internet of Things [21]-[36] 
with optimization technologies [37]-[40].
