Abstract—Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged as one of the
most promising solutions for reducing carbon emissions in smart
cities. However, due to the limited battery life of EVs and the
scarcity of charging stations, EV drivers are not willing to travel
long distances. Thus, blockchain-enabled energy trading (BET) has
lately been used to securely share energy among EVs via wireless
power transfer (WPT) technology. Blockchain is used to ensure the
security and privacy of transactions between untrustworthy EVs in
the WPT process. Nevertheless, previous works on BET have relied
on existing consensus mechanisms built on the requirements of the
cryptocurrency systems. These consensus mechanisms have faced
significant challenges in maintaining high reliability, throughput,
low latency, and network scalability in V2V energy trading that
requires real-time services. To address these issues, we propose a
new consensus mechanism that leverages the benefits of Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Reputation (PoR)
called PBFT-based PoR (PPoR). The energy trading process runs
in a clustered vehicular network, where validator selection, block
generation, and consensus processes are performed in each cluster.
We adopt an incentive mechanism based on a Stackelberg game
model to optimize the utility of sellers, buyers, and validator nodes,
which motivates honest and cooperative nodes. The simulation
results show that the proposed scheme reduces buyers’ costs by
21.1% while increasing the utility of sellers by 18%. Moreover,
compared to benchmarks, the proposed scheme reduces the trans-
action processing delay and increases the throughput by more than
47.1% and 15.7%, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
THE rapid development of intelligent transportation sys-
tems has been crucial in the realization of carbon-free
and environmentally safe smart cities [1]. Over the last decade,
governments, academia, and worldwide industries have given
great attention to reducing urban pollution. Efforts have been
made to advance the vehicular technologies to preserve global
resources. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs), which use renew-
able energy sources such as wind, solar power, and biofuels were
developed. EVs are a promising solution for combating climate
change, reducing harmful exhaust emissions. They are becoming
more common in recent years due to their low carbon emissions,
modest cost, and environmental safety, which makes them more
appealing to buy in general [1], [2]. Moreover, vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communication has gained much attention because of
its significant potential to expand the use of intelligent trans-
portation technologies including safety applications, on-board
entertainment, and resource sharing [3]–[6]. In future intelligent
transportation networks, EVs are anticipated to be one of the
most critical modes of transportation and renewable energy
users [7].
Energy demand has been rising rapidly as a result of the
increasing number of EVs and smart devices embedded in their
systems [8]. Besides, due to their limited battery life and higher
energy requirements for appliances connected to them, EVs must
be re-charged frequently for drivers to travel long distances to
their destination [9]. On the other hand, cities have a scarcity
of charging stations to meet the ever-increasing demand for
EVs charging. Furthermore, the recharging of EVs is difficult
when the vehicles are far from the charging station and have
insufficient energy to reach the charging station. To address
this issue, a vehicular energy network (VEN) has recently been
used in the Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) to facilitate
V2V energy transportation across a broad geographical area by
utilizing wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies [10]–[12].
The V2V energy sharing is a more convenient and flexible
method of EVs charging, and it can help to reduce EV energy
consumption [13]. The design and implementation of a V2V
energy sharing network would dramatically reduce EV range
anxiety while requiring minimal infrastructure investment. It

also offers a valuable service to EV owners, local communities
and municipalities, and the utility grid, particularly as a demand
response tool during peak hours [14]. V2V energy sharing will
allow EVs to dynamically re-charge their batteries from EVs
with extra energy on their board at comparable transfer rates
while both the seller and buyer are in motion [15].
However, the IoEV environment is supposed to be trust-
less, where energy sellers, buyers, and brokers are not honest
enough [16]. The trading parties may have disputes concerning
payments and sharing of energy. Also, due to the potential secu-
rity vulnerability in IoEV, EV users can be attacked by external or
internal adversaries [17]. Furthermore, due to the selfishness of
EVs, it is a significant challenge to optimally charge/discharge
EVs in order to achieve regional energy balance in IoEV. To
address the aforementioned issues, authors in [1], [7], [18]–[20]
introduced blockchain-enabled energy trading (BET) schemes
to achieve secure energy delivery services between energy sell-
ers and buyers. Blockchain is a digital ledger system that allows
untrusted vehicles to keep distributed and transparent transaction
records. It was initially designed for cryptocurrency exchange,
but it is now being used in various industries, including health
care, agriculture, education, resource sharing, and more, to en-
sure the security and privacy of transactions between untrusted
nodes in a chain [21], [22]. The consensus mechanism is a
core element of blockchain to maintain trust between untrusted
nodes [23]–[25]. The efficiency of the blockchain systems con-
siderably depends on the design of consensus mechanisms, and
it strongly impacts the transaction processing rate, scalability,
reliability, and security of the system [24], [26].
In the last decade, researchers have attempted to improve
the efficiency of blockchain systems by developing a novel
consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-
of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), Practical Byzantine
fault-tolerant (PBFT), and Proof-of-Reputation (PoR). How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, consensus mechanisms
designed specifically to improve the efficiency of V2V energy
trading in the IoEVs are still rare. Besides, previous studies on
BET relied on these existing consensus mechanisms designed
for cryptocurrency-based systems. Studies in [3], [26] witnessed
that the current consensus mechanisms are not efficient for
V2V energy trading because they require high computational
resources to find validators, have a lot of communication com-
plexity and cost during the consensus process. Currently, the EVs
are embedded with intelligent devices to run real-time safety
applications, on-road infotainment, and distribute resources in
complex communication environments using their limited re-
sources.
Therefore, we are motivated to design efficient consensus
mechanisms for the BET deployed in the IoEVs to address the
aforementioned problems of the V2V energy trading process. In
this paper, we use a consortium blockchain to enable secure
energy trading between energy requester (buyer) and energy
provider (seller) vehicles. A Stackelberg game model is used to
motivate energy buyer, seller, and consensus nodes as a utility
maximization scheme. The main contributions of this work are
presented as follows:
1) We design the PBFT-based PoR (PPoR) consensus model,
in which the advantage of PBFT and PoR are inte-
grated and harmonized to maintain secure, reliable, and
distributed consensus in the BET system. We use a clus-
tered vehicular network, in which EVs participating in the
energy sharing system are grouped together based on their
current location, speed, and direction. The validator selec-
tion, block generation, and block validation are performed
in each cluster.
2) We adopt a logic-based trust management scheme for
reputation calculation and validator selection in which
validators are easily chosen based on their reputation
rather than solving mathematical puzzles to be selected
as a leader. The logic-based trust management scheme
integrates subjective and objective trust.
3) To improve the utility and revenue of both the energy
sellers and buyers, we use a two-stage Multi-leaders and
Multi-followers (MLMF) Stackelberg game-based model.
This model encourages energy sellers to share their excess
energy with EVs that require energy to reach their destina-
tion. Furthermore, energy buyers can obtain energy with
high quality of service (QoS) at a low cost.
4) We propose a pricing-based incentive mechanism based on
a Stackelberg game model to motivate energy transaction
validators involved in the BET. The proposed incentive
mechanism rewards monetary value and allocates mining
value to the validator EVs in order to encourage honest
and cooperative nodes. Moreover, we perform extensive
simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed
scheme in terms of utility optimization, throughput, la-
tency, and scalability.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we
presented related works. The system model of V2V energy trad-
ing, including network model, cluster formation, blockchain-
enabled V2V energy trading, and problem formulation are de-
scribed under Section III. Section IV discusses the proposed
consensus scheme, and Section V analyzes the performance
evaluation and the simulation results. Lastly, we conclude the
paper in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORKS
This section reviews recent research efforts focusing on en-
ergy sharing in the IoEV and consensus mechanisms commonly
utilized in the BET system.
A. V2V Energy Transfer
Several studies have been conducted in order to present novel
solutions for V2V and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy sharing.
Authors in [17] presented bidirectional direct current to direct
current (DC-DC) energy transfer. Alvaro et al. [20] proposed
V2V energy transfer in a smart grid. Wang et al. [27] pro-
posed a novel charging scheme for EVs in a smart community
integrated with renewable energy sources based on a game
theory approach. However, these energy transfer methods use
an energy aggregator or transmit power between EVs in a
conductive manner via a DC-DC converter, which reduces the

energy transfer efficiency of EVs. Many WPT-based solutions
have been proposed to address this issue. In [28], a direct V2V
power transfer method via WPT was presented that does not
require an energy aggregator. The authors in [29], [30] presented
a review of the WPT technologies applied for EV charging. The
studies in [10]–[12] have proposed V2V charging using WPT
technologies. WPT has recently become very attractive for EV
charging applications in both stationary and dynamic charging
scenarios due to its advancements [12], [31], [32]. According to
recent studies, WPT systems for EVs charging are classified into
three types: stationary (SWPT), semi/quasi-dynamic (QDWPT),
and dynamic (DWPT) [30]. The SWPT charging system which
replaces the conductive charging system, allows EVs to share
energy using an on-board receiving pad and an external charging
pad in the pavement. The QDWPT systems can be deployed
at bus and taxi stops and traffic lights to provide short-term
charging in a dynamic environment. The DWPT systems allow
EVs to charge their battery while they are in motion, increasing
driving range and efficiency [10], [30]. As a result, the DWPT
attracted more interest to use in EVs charging.
Moreover, blockchain technology has been employed in en-
ergy trading to guarantee the security and privacy of transac-
tions kept by untrusted nodes. The authors in [33] presented
an optimal bidding framework for V2G enabled local energy
internet by taking carbon trading into account. Ashfaq et al. [18]
proposed a blockchain-based k-nearest neighbor approach to
energy trading for EVs with the goal of reducing resource
consumption. Sun et al. [19] proposed a blockchain-enabled
and fog computing-based V2V energy trading architecture to
balance the interests of both charging and discharging EVs.
Hong et al. [34] proposed a consortium blockchain-based V2G
energy transaction system. The authors in [35] introduced a
blockchain-assisted V2G energy trading framework. Danish
et al. [36] presented a blockchain-enabled framework for EV
charging services and trusted reservations. Lasla et al. [7] pre-
sented a blockchain-based energy trading architecture, which
is a smart-contract-based trading platform that allows sellers
to supply public charging stations and EVs to obtain energy at
a reasonable price. Furthermore, the authors of [37] presented
a novel permissioned energy blockchain system in VEN to
implement secure wireless energy delivery services for EVs and
energy nodes using distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. The
PoR consensus mechanism is used to assist EVs in reaching
an agreement in energy trading transactions. The blockchain-
enabled studies described above relied on legacy consensus
structures, which are inefficient for providing the high through-
put, reliability, low latency, and scalability that today’s vehicular
technology demands.
B. Consensus Mechanism
Several consensus algorithms have been created to enhance
the efficiency of blockchains after the invention of blockchain
(Bitcoin) in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin uses the PoW
consensus algorithm, which is the most widely used crypto-
currency-based consensus algorithm [38]. PoW is currently
used in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and a variety of other
private blockchains. In PoW, miners compete against one an-
other by solving complex mathematical puzzles to be chosen
as a leader. Solving these puzzles requires more computation
resources and time. As a result, Ethereum proposed the PoS
consensus protocol to address the issues of PoW. In PoS, the
block miner is chosen at random based on the node’s stake in
the system [39]. Nevertheless, PoS is criticized for the centrality
of consensus that occurs when wealthy stakeholders control the
consensus process. As a solution to these issues, the Delegated
PoS (DPoS) consensus protocol is proposed, in which each node
selects a representative to create and approve blocks. DPoS
processes transactions faster than PoS, but the consensus process
is more centralized [40]. Similarly, Gavin Wood proposed PoA,
in which validators stake their authority reputation rather than
coins [41], and New Economy Movement (NEM) proposed
Proof of Importance (PoI), which works similarly to PoS but
adds more metrics to evaluate miner nodes [42]. Moreover,
in [24] proposed PoR, in which validators are chosen based
on their reputation, which is calculated using a subjective trust
model. Furthermore, in 1999, Castro et al. [43] introduced the
PBFT, which is now used in Hyperledger. To keep the net-
work secure in PBFT, nodes involved in the consensus process
must exchange messages with every other node, which in-
creases communication complexity and cost as the network size
grows.
Current research works related to the BET system have been
utilizing the traditional consensus mechanisms designed based
on the crypto-currency system requirements. For instance, the
PBFT-based Delegated PoS (PDPoS) implemented for enhanced
energy sharing in IoEV [19], PBFT for energy trading in V2G
environment [22], and PoR used in [37]. The authors in [44] pro-
posed an Enhanced Proof-of-Benefit (ePoB) consensus scheme
to improve the protocol security and performance of the elec-
tricity exchange system in V2G. A reputation-based delegated
BFT consensus algorithm is proposed in [45] to efficiently reach
consensus in the permissioned energy blockchain. However,
these existing consensus mechanisms are challenged to achieve
efficient consensus in BET scheme. Considering the EVs’ real
problem and the service that the EVs are envisioned to provide
in the building of smart cities, we design an efficient consensus
mechanism called PPoR for the BET system deployed in IoEV
to perform efficient V2V energy sharing. Our proposed scheme
is different from others for various reasons. 1) In our scenario,
the trading takes place in a clustered V2V environment, which
shortens the distance between the energy seller and buyer allows
both the seller and the buyer to consume as a minimum amount
of energy as possible for communication and energy sharing. It
also ensures that the entities in the blockchain share resources
fairly and reasonably. 2) The reputation calculation model is
designed based on both subjective and objective trust manage-
ment schemes to increase fairness in the rating of EV reputation.
3) In PPoR, only the leader node can create a new block at a
time to prevent the fork creation, and the consensus reached by
only selected nodes reduces the communication complexity. 4)
The game-based incentive mechanism designed to motivate the
validator nodes significantly reduces consensus time and ensures

block security. It can also improve the transaction throughput of
the system.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we present a system model as shown in Fig. 1,
where EVs are grouped into three clusters based on their current
mobility information, direction/route, and speed. Each cluster
consists of buyer, seller, and transaction validator. We utilize
a consortium blockchain with a smart contract (SC) to ensure
the security and privacy of the V2V energy trading system. The
consortium blockchain is lightweight technology that has been
used in various sectors, where only selected nodes participate in
consensus process. It allows the energy requester EVs continu-
ally interacts with the system by requesting energy to charge their
vehicle and then, they choose the best reasonable offer among the
submitted bids. When required, the energy seller vehicle can pur-
chase energy at lower prices directly from the electric grid, other
EVs, and other energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, and
so on, and sell it to other vehicles at the best possible price.
The SC is a slice of code deployed into the BET nodes/EVs and
triggered by transactions stored in a BET network. The BET also
keeps the new states of the SC whenever it is executed. In the EV
charging scenario, the SC defines the energy trading logic, which
runs whenever a new transaction to buy or sell energy is sent by
buyers and sellers, respectively. The SC will behave logically
based on its code and guarantee the implementation of terms and
conditions that are agreed by parties. Overall, it can improve all
participants’ accountability, interoperability, and credibility in
such a decentralized environment. Both buyer and seller EVs are
equipped with a smart meter (SM) to report their consumed and
produced energy, respectively. The SM is an essential element of
the system, allowing for tracking the energy transfer between the
buyer and seller concerning the corresponding pre-established
energy purchase agreement.
A trusted authority (TA) is employed to issue the identity of
entities involved in the energy trading system. The TA manages
the network infrastructure, including the deployed SMs, and
ensures their security and privacy. It also maintains the list
of the registered users with their associated SCs, and the SC
is used to enforce the entities to abide by the agreement they
contracted. The charging stations are utilized as energy sources
to provide power to nearby EVs, just like gasoline powers used
for a fuel-based vehicle. Besides, to further improve the V2V
communication network performance, road side units (RSUs)
with wireless backhaul and macro base stations (MBSs) are
deployed to provide wireless connectivity for the EVs. The Soft-
ware Defined Networking (SDN) allows V2V network connec-
tivity services to be programmable, allowing traffic flows to be
dynamically directed and managed for maximum performance
gains. The central SDN controller has a global and aggregated
view of the V2V network.
A. Network Model
We assume that energy sellers, buyers, and transaction val-
idators are clustered during the energy trading process based
on their current mobility information. In VEN, we consider a
number of clusters with EVs/users distributed randomly in their
coverage areas and connected to RSUs. Let j ∈ S={1,2,3,...,S}
be the set of energy sellers, i ∈ B={1,2,3,...,B} denotes the
set of energy buyers, and l ∈ N={1,2,3,...,N} denotes the
set of validators in each cluster. Also, S ∪ B ∪ N = E =
{1, 2, 3, . . .., E} represents the set of EVs in each cluster, and
z ∈ Z = {1, 2, . . ., Z} is the set of clusters. In the consortium
blockchain network, each EV requires a unique identification
address (ID) for identity authentication to be able to participate
in energy trading legitimately. Hence, the buyers, sellers, and
validators must register in the BET to get an account or public
parameters and cryptographic keys that uniquely identify them
in the energy trading system. To obtain the certificate, sellers
must show that they have surplus energy to sell during the
energy trading process, and buyers must also prove that they
have transaction coins (ECoin) in their wallet to purchase the
requested energy. First they get their certificatesCertSj
, CertBi
,
and CertNl
respectively from TA. The Bi can join the energy
trading system using its certificate and obtain the public/private
key pair (PKBi
, SKBi
), and wallet address (AddBi
). The ac-
count of Bi includes BalBi
, certificate CertBi
, current energy
coin value ei, public/private key pair (PKBi
, SKBi
), and wallet
address AddBi
. Similarly, the seller’s account contains its ac-
count balance BalSj
, available energy, public/private key pair
(PKSj
, SKSj
), and wallet address addSj
. To guarantee the au-
thenticity and integrity of information exchange between sender
and receiver, asymmetric encryption technology is applied in the
blockchain [46], and it is expressed as:
DPKx
(SigSKx
(H(m))) = H(m), ∀x ∈ E , (1)
where SigSKx
() is the digital signature of sender x with its
private key, DPKx
() is the decryption function with sender x’s
public key, and H(m) is the hash digest of message m.
Moreover, TA is used as a parameter initializer to provide
entity identity authorization and certificate issuance prior to
running an energy blockchain. TA is in charge of generating
public parameters and cryptographic keys and managing the
identity of vehicles.
The energy provider and requester EVs are assumed to be in
2D space, and their locations coordinate can be expressed as
(xj , yj), and (xi, yi), ∀j ∈ S, ∀i ∈ B, where (xj , yj) denotes

location of jth energy provider, and (xi, yi) represents loca-
tion of ith energy requester. The distance between the energy
provider and requester is considered in the trading process [47].
The Euclidean distance between the EV j and EV i in each
cluster is defined by:
dj,i =
√
(xj,z − xi)2 + (yj,z − yi)2, j ∈ S, i ∈ B. (2)
We consider the impact of cross channel interference (CCI)
in the seller and buyer association problems. The Signal-to-
Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of ith energy requester
associated with the jth energy provider is given as:
�j,i =
SPR(j, i)
IEAgg(j) +N0
, (3)
whereSPR(j, i) denotes the signal power received at the ith en-
ergy requester from the jth provider, IEAgg(j) is the aggregate
interference encountered by the ith requester, and N0 refers the
power spectral density of the Gaussian noise [48]. Furthermore,
the transmission rate from energy provider j to requester i is
expressed as: ρji =W log2(1 +
ℵgji
��2 ), where W denotes the
available bandwidth for each link, ℵ denotes maximum trans-
mission power at each EV, gji denotes the channel power gain
from EV j to EV i for energy transfer, � represents the SINR
gap from the additive white Gaussian noise channel capacity,
and �2 denotes the noise power at the receiving side.
B. Power System Model
In our proposed V2V energy trading system, energy provider
EV j obtains energy from the power grid or other EVs at a
unit price of αb
j and sells it to other EVs at a price of αs
j . The
energy provider constantly adjusts selling prices in the game to
maximize its profit. The energy seller’s pricing strategy must
satisfy the following condition:
0 < αb
j(t) < αs
j(t), ∀j ∈ S. (4)
Let Emin be the minimum battery level threshold, and Ei(t) be
the battery level of EV i at time slot t. When Ei(t) ≤ Emin,
EV i sends an energy demand μi,j(t) and a maximum energy
demand μmax
i,j to the energy provider j that meets the following
conditions [49].
0 ≤ μi,j(t) ≤ μmax
i,j ≤ Ci,j , ∀i ∈ B, (5)
where Ci,j is the battery charging capacity of EV i. During
EV charging, the initial state of charge Eini
i,j , expected state of
chargeEexp, and state of chargeEi,j(t) at time slot t are used to
calculate the amount of charged battery level. When the energy
seller and buyer EVs start charging/discharging, the SM in the
EV i records and reports the initial charge/battery level state.
Each EV aims to be charged to its expected maximum energy
level Eexp while minimizing its total energy purchase costs by
making optimal demand price matching decisions; this should
satisfy the following conditions [27]:
0 ≤ Eini
i,j ≤ Ei,j(t) ≤ Eexp ≤ 1. (6)
A linear model can be used to describe the battery dynamics of
EV i [50] as:
Ei,j(t+ 1) = Ei,j +
Γi,jμi,j(t)Ii,j(t)
Ci, j
, ∀i ∈ B, (7)
where Γi,j ∈ (0, 1) is the battery charging efficiency of EV i.
Besides, Ii,j denotes the indicator function used to present the
EV state. It can be expressed as Ii,j = {0, 1}, where Ii,j = 1
indicates that the EV is in a charging state and has not reached the
expected charging level at time slot t, whereas Ii,j = 0 indicates
that the EV is in an ideal state and has reached the expected
charging level at time slot t.
Electric storage unit: Let Et−Δt
j , and Et
j be the energy level
of the electric storage units (ESU) of energy seller j at the
beginning and end of the expected time slot. The charging and
discharging power of seller j’s ESU at a time slot t is assumed to
be constant and is denoted by Ct
p,j and Dt
p,j . We define binary
variables ϑtc,j and ξtd,j for seller j charging and discharging in
time t, respectively, and ϑtc,j+ξtd,j ≤ 1. The energy stored in the
ESU during charging and discharging is denoted by Ψt
j and �tj ,
respectively, and is expressed as [9]:
Ψt
j = ϑtc,jC

p,je

p,jΔt
etd,j
(9)
where etc,j , and etd,j denote the charging and discharging effi-
ciency of ESU for seller j, respectively, and Δt represents the
length of each time slot. Therefore, the total energy stored in the
ESU of EV j can be expressed as:
Et
j = Et−Δt
j + (Ψt
j − �

The total available energy for seller j is denoted by χ = Et
j −

min, where Et
min is the minimum energy threshold that the
seller j must maintain in its ESU. Besides, for EV j to sell its
surplus energy to EV i, the following inequality must always be

C. Cluster Formation and Cluster Head Selection
In this paper, we apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to
build clusters based on current mobility information, direction,
and speed of EVs, where each cluster has Cluster Head (CH)
and assistant CH chosen by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm [51].
The CH and assistant CH act as an SDN controller to manage the
EVs in the cluster, and in the event of a CH failure, the assistant
CH takes over the controlling service to mitigate controller
failure in the cluster [47]. As it is shown in Fig. 1, EVs in
the BET system are classified into three different clusters. EVs
interested in joining the clusters sends their current and previous
mobility information to the nearby CH, and CH verifies the
request and approves if it is legal. The mobility information
consists of vehicle-ID, cluster-ID, two-dimensional position,
and the vehicle-role in the energy trading process (buyer, seller

or validator). The mobility information of EVs could be directly
integrated into the central SDN controller. The central SDN
controller manages the incoming and outgoing traffic flows of
clusters, while CH controls the flows within each cluster. The
EVs can frequently change their cluster due to their high mobility
and the dynamic nature of the route they pass through. Thus, to
increase cluster stability, we choose clusters to be created based
on the speed and vehicle’s direction extracted from the GPS
integrated within their system. The EVs moving on the straight
line segment in the same direction will be clustered together.
Moreover, the movement of an EV is defined by two random
variables (S, T ), where S is the EV speed, which has an equal
probability of taking one of two possible state values (i.e., a
lower speed Ls and a higher speed Hs). On the other hand,
T represents the period that the EV moves at a constant speed
before transitioning from Ls to Hs or vice versa. EV initially
selectsLs(Hs) and, after T , switches to the other speedHs(Ls)
[52], [53]. We can adjust the time that an EV stays at a certain
speed by changing the transition rate from Ls to Hs and vice
versa and setting the Ls close to or equal to Hs. Therefore, this
would help in determining optimal energy strategies for EVs
while also maintaining cluster stability.
D. Blockchain-Enabled V2V Energy Trading
In this subsection, we describe the framework of BET shown
in Fig. 2, which uses consortium blockchain with smart contracts
as the core of the energy trading system in order to allocate
energy from sellers to buyers optimally. The primary function
of the BET is to maintain trust between all parties without
relying on a trusted third party. This consortium blockchain-
based energy trading integrates the sellers, buyers, TA, and
validators to perform secure, distributed, and efficient block
validation and verification. The vehicles that need to purchase
energy continually interact with the BET system, and validators
facilitate the energy trading between buyers and sellers.
In the BET, only authorized EVs can participate in the con-
sensus and verify the validity of a block. The detailed energy
trading process is summarized as follows:
1) System initialization: The TA initializes the trading system
by issuing unique identifiers to entities involved in the energy
trading process. After passing identity authentication by the
TA, each participant in the BET system becomes an authorized
entity with unique registration information. During system ini-
tialization, an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm [54] and
asymmetric cryptography [45] are used to ensure data integrity
and transaction unforgeability in the BET.
2) Reputation-based validator selection: We apply a
reputation-based validator selection method, in which the val-
idator’s reputation is calculated using both subjective and objec-
tive trust logic models. The subjective trust logic evaluates the
previous transaction validation, verification, and audit records
of the nodes involved in the consensus process by collecting
opinions about each node from all participants. The EV that is
interested in becoming a validator candidate must provide the
TA with identity-related information and obtain the certificate
CertNl
before participating in verification. The TA then verifies
the legality of the consensus nodes/validators by evaluating the
information they provided and issues the certificates to validator
EVs who passed the authentication.
3) Energy trading between buyers and sellers: Initially, Bi
sends an energy request to the cluster head (CH) and the CH
collects, arranges and stores it in the transaction pool. The leader
node computes total energy demands and broadcasts them to the
energy providers. The energy supplier EVs then determine their
initial energy to be sold and the corresponding price using a
pricing scheme designed on the basis of a game theory model
to motivate sellers and buyers. Energy sellers in the blockchain
adjust their pricing strategies non-cooperatively to maximize
their profit, and buyers base their decisions on the prices offered
and QoS estimated by the sellers, and provide responses to
the leader. The buyers also consider the distance, speed, and
direction of the energy provider to make an energy purchase
decision. Vehicles moving in the same direction, speed and close
distance will utilize small amount of energy to perform V2V
charging. The leader then coordinates and orchestrates energy
supply and demand between sellers and buyers. Finally, once the
energy trading agreement is reached, Bi transfers energy coins
from its wallet to the wallet address provided by the Sj based
on smart meter readings.
E. Problem Formulation
In the energy trading system, the buyers purchases energy
from sellers in order to travel long distances to their destination.
However, vehicles with surplus energy may not be willing to
share their energy with other vehicles that have low energy
without some compensation. Therefore, to motivate sellers to
share their excess energy with purchasers, an incentive technique
must be used that allows both buyers and sellers to maximize
their utility. Since both sellers and buyers are rational and selfish
in the process of energy trading, they all seek to maximize their
own benefits. Therefore, a game-theoretic strategy is used to
tune energy demand and supply in our energy blockchain and
achieve optimal energy trading agreements between the sellers
and buyers. We employ a two-stage MLMF Stackelberg game
model to optimize seller and buyer profits.

Let define αi as the price for each unit of energy provided
to the Bi and ηi represents the energy that Bi intends to pur-
chase. The seller also incurs other overhead cost ψ while per-
forming the trading such as maintenance, electricity, hardware
loss and operation costs. The utility function of the sellers is
expressed as:
USj
(α, η) =

αiηi −

where α is the energy price vector with α = [α1, α2, . . ., αB ]
T ,
and η is a vector of energy purchased by buyers with η =
[η1, η2, . . ., ηB ]
T . Note that ∀i, ηi is a function of αi, i.e.,
ηi � f(αi), which indicates that the energy that each buyer
willing to buy depends on its allocated energy price. Also, it
is assumed that the total available surplus energy of the Sj is χ,
i.e., the total allocated energy for all the buyers should not be
larger than χ.
Furthermore, each buyer should also consider its real demands
while purchasing energy to determine the cost of buying energy.
The utility function of buyers is expressed as:
UBi
(ηi, αi) = ωi log2
(
1 +
ηi
μi
)
− ηiαi, (13)
where log2(1 + ηi
μi
) is energy obtainment gains, ωi is a positive
coefficient that is used to convert the energy obtainment revenues
into monetary reward, and ηiαi is the cost incurred by buyer to
obtain ηi energy. The energy obtainment gain is an increasing
function of purchased energy ηi. The log function can also reveal
the degree of satisfaction of buyers when receives ηi energy for
the demand μi.
F. MLMF Stackelberg Game Formulation and Analysis
In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model as a two-
stage MLMF Stackelberg game where sellers act as leaders and
buyers act as followers. Both the sellers and buyers constantly
adjust their strategies to maximize their reward. The leaders
first announce the initial price of the energy to be sold, and the
followers then request the energy based on the leaders’ unit price.
As a result, sellers compete with one another to sell their excess
energy by setting their individual prices and estimate QoS levels
in a non-cooperative manner as shown in Fig. 3. The buyers
then consider the prices and estimated QoS of sellers to make a
matching decision. In addition to the price given by the energy
supplier j, the Euclidian distance dj,i and SINR �j,i between
them are taken into account by the energy requester EV i when
making a matching decision. Under the pricing-based incentive
mechanism, the seller’s objective is to increase its revenue from
selling the energy to the buyers, whereas the buyer aims to
enhance its obtainment by minimizing energy purchasing costs.
Therefore, each leader must determine an optimal price α in
order to maximize utility (revenue) within the constraints of their
available resources. Similarly, each follower decides to optimize
its utility by minimizing costs while maintaining the desired
QoS. In this way, the sellers gain a certain amount of profit from
the buyers, and each buyer can purchase some surplus energy
from the seller and extend their battery to travel a long distance.

This game aims to find the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE)
point(s) where both the leaders and the followers benefit the
most. Let dmax
j,i be the maximum Euclidian distance threshold,
and �min
j,i be the minimum SINR threshold between energy
supplier EV j and buyer EV i. The optimization problems of
the energy trading are presented as below:

(α∗, η∗) is the SE if it satisfies the following conditions.
Equations (18) and (19) show that USj
and UBi
are strictly
concave. Hence, the SE exists in the formulated Stackelberg
game. In this scenario, to achieve SE, Sj sets its decisions of

IV. PROPOSED PPOR CONSENSUS SCHEME
This section discusses the overview of the proposed consen-
sus scheme, validator selection, reputation calculation, block
generation, consensus process, and incentive scheme.
A. Overview of PPoR
The main goal of the PPoR consensus scheme is to achieve
secure, distributed, reliable, and efficient consensus in BET;
and maintain equality and fairness among consensus nodes to
participate in block validation and get rewarded. We investigate
the BET system’s real problem and design an efficient PPoR
consensus mechanism to improve energy sharing between two
EVs (sellers and buyers).
Every energy request is processed within the cluster, which
includes energy sellers, buyers, and validators as members.
Validators are selected in the cluster based on their reputation
value, and they are responsible for reaching a consensus on
a newly generated block in their respective cluster. We adopt
reputation calculation model based on subjective and objective
trust schemes. The evidence and opinion spaces are collected
from EVs in each cluster and recorded in the system to calculate
the reputation value of each node. In our proposed model, EVs’
reputation value is calculated and stored in the chain automat-
ically after the new block is recorded to the BET. The entire
nodes in the blockchain know the validators of the next block.
Besides, to prevent possible attacks such as double spending,
Sybil attacks, and 51% attacks, we adopt the advantages of the
PBFT consensus mechanism. Hence in this scheme, the block is
officially recorded to the chain only when 80% or more validator
nodes verify its legitimacy, which means it tolerates 20% faulty
nodes.
B. Reputation-Based Validator Selection
This subsection explores how block-validators are chosen
to add new blocks to the BET system. In the consortium
blockchain, only selected nodes are responsible for making a
consensus in adding and verifying transactions in the blockchain.
Since the energy trading occurs within the cluster, only three-
fourths of the highly reputable EVs in the cluster are chosen
as validators based on their reputation value. In the process of
block mining, only one node (leader) is accountable for making
a new block and broadcast to other validators, and then validator
nodes verify the new block broadcasted by the leader. In PPoR,
no puzzle solving competition is required to be a leader; instead,
it can be chosen based on EVs’ reputation value. A node with
the highest reputation value is taken as a leader. Our proposed
scheme calculates the reputation value of EVs to determine their
status and incentive. The EVs with higher reputation value can be
validators and incentivized based on their contribution to mining
work.
C. Reputation Calculation
The reputation can be calculated by jointly considering a sub-
jective and objective trust of EVs involved in the energy trading
process. The trust in a V2V network presents the characteristics
of both objective and subjective aspects [55].
1) Subjective trust scheme: Can be calculated by considering
honesty, efficiency, and service score. We assume that honesty
can be gained by comparing the inconsistency to the objective
opinions from other participants. To obtain efficiency, we con-
sider the number of audited transaction, audit result forward
and response time compared with the minimum threshold time
Tt. Total efficiency timeEall = Taudit + Tforward + Tresponse
and the efficiency Ei,j is defined as:
Ei,j = min
(
Tt
Eall
, 1
)
. (21)
Finally, we consider the participation and success rate of con-
sensus nodes as the service score.
2) Objective trust scheme: In V2V energy trading, subjective
trust opinion may be biased or untrustworthy. Therefore, the
objective trust is used together with the subjective trust scheme.
The objective trust can be regarded as a weighted sum of
various trust opinions, and a list of factors that determine the
weights. At this point, to reflect the features of V2V networks,

we mainly consider participation, maturity, success rate and
earned mining value. Let π ∈ [0, 1] is number of tasks validator
participated, ν ∈ [0, 1] represents the earned mining value, and
ζ ∈ [0, 1] denotes the successful validation made by the consen-
sus node. Thus, the participation and success rate of validators
expressed as:
πl =
πl
t
, ζl =
ζl
πl
, (22)
where t is the total block validation task. Besides, the earned
mining value of validators can be calculated as:
νl =
νl∑N
i=1 νl
. (23)
To obtain a precise reputation value, a three-weight subjec-
tive logic enabled reputation management scheme is used. In
this reputation management scheme, the evidence space and
opinion space between buyer i and seller j can be described as
{Φi,j , βi,j , ϕi,j} andwi,j := {bi,j , di,j , ui,j}, respectively. The
opinion space can be mapped to the evidence space as shown in
Equation (24), where Φi,j , βi,j and ϕi,j denote the numbers of
positive behaviors, negative behaviors, and uncertain behaviors,
correspondingly. Similarly bi,j , di,j , and ui,j show the proba-
bilities of “belief,” “distrust,” and “uncertainty,” respectively.
Let bi,j , di,j , ui,j ∈ [0, 1] and bi,j + di,j + ui,j = 1. Then, we
can calculate the possible reputation value based on subjective
opinion as in Equation (24) and (25).⎧⎪⎨

ui,j =

Φi,j+βi,j+ϕi,j
(24)
ρsubl = bi,j + εui,j . (25)
Then, we can define the subjective opinion space as wsb
i,j =
{bsbi,j , dsbi,j , usbi,j} and the objective one aswob
i,j = {bobi,j , dobi,j , uobi,j}.
Furthermore, the total opinion space wtotal

{btotali,j , dtotali,j , utotali,j } can be expressed as:⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨

Finally, we calculate the reputation value ρtotall based on both
subjective and objective opinion spaces as in Equation (27), in
which ε is a predefined constant reflecting the degree of influence
of uncertain behaviors on the trust value.
D. Block Generation Process
We create a block data structure to meet the needs of energy
trading in a clustered trading environment. The cluster infor-
mation (CI) field has been added to the block data structure to
improve transaction execution time, overall block production
time, and system scalability. As shown in Fig. 4, a block data
Fig. 4. PPoR block data structure.
consists of two sections: the block header and the transaction sec-
tion, with the block header section containing the block height,
version, CI, timestamp, previous block hash, and signature,
and the transaction section containing the transaction Merkle
root. The block generation process begins with the creation of
transactions, in which buyers send energy purchase requests to
the blockchain. When an energy transaction request is sent to the
BET, the CH node collects and stores it in the transaction pool.
The leader then begins to coordinate the process of reaching a
consensus.
E. PPoR Consensus Process
In a blockchain, all records are publicly verifiable and avail-
able to each node in the network. After successful transaction
validation via a consensus mechanism, a block is added to
the chain in chronological order. A linked list structure of a
block makes each block references its parent through its unique
cryptographic hash links to ensure the security and immutabil-
ity of energy transaction records. The hash is formed through
the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm, which helps to identify
each block. The consensus mechanism ensures all participating
nodes’ mutual agreement for transaction validation, updating,
and synchronization in a digital ledger. In the BET, EVs need
to agree on a set of energy transactions to add in a block
using an efficient consensus algorithm. In this scheme, block
validation can be performed by a group of consensus nodes
located in the same cluster. The aim of grouping nodes into
different clusters is to allow nodes to reach consensus in a
faster and more reliable manner, where nodes in the local group
exchange votes and reach consensus locally. The leader will then
upload the local consensus to the global chain. To synchronize
the block in the global chain, leaders of each cluster involves
in block validation. As illustrated in Fig. 5, each round, the
cluster leader collects transactions based on the current loca-
tion and path of the energy requesting EV, packs them into
blocks, timestamps, and broadcasts to other authorized consen-
sus nodes in the cluster with its signature for validation and
verification.
These consensus nodes check the validity of the block data re-
ceived from the cluster leader and broadcast their audit outcomes
to other validators with their signatures for joint supervision and
assurance. After receiving the audit results, each consensus node
compares its work with others. If the transaction is legal and the

signature is correct, they will vote on the transaction block and
sends a reply to the cluster leader. This reply consists of the
node’s audit result, comparison result, signatures, and records
of received audit results. The leader analyzes the received re-
sponses from consensus nodes.
Suppose the leader node receives a valid vote from three-
fourth or above of the consensus nodes. In that case, it will
append the block to the global chain and sends updates, in-
cluding current audited block data and a corresponding sig-
nature to all authorized validator nodes for storage in their
local chain. The detailed consensus process of PPoR is shown
in Algorithm 2.
After the block is stored in the consortium blockchain, energy
coins are awarded to the consensus nodes based on their contri-
bution to the block mining and increment each node’s mining
value who successfully validated the block.
F. Incentive Mechanism
In this paper, we adopt a game theory-based pricing incentive
scheme to motivate honest and cooperative vehicles involved
in block validation process. The game theory strategy is an ap-
plied mathematical theory that models and analyses the systems
where each node attempts to find the best strategy selected by
others to reach consensus [56]. The proposed scheme rewards
monetary incentives and mining value for cooperating nodes and
punishes misbehaving malicious nodes. The SC integrated with
the blockchain ensures that the service level agreement signed
by task owners (TOs) and validators is obeyed. The two-stage
Stackelberg game is formulated as MLMF, where TOs act as
leaders and block validators act as followers to maximize their
reward by actively participating in block mining activities. The
TOs in this game are both EPs and ERs who pay a mining
incentive for the transaction they initiated. The set of TOs is
denoted by f ∈ F = {1, 2, . . ., F}, and each TO f strategizes
its pricing to maximize its utility.
In the first stage, for N ≥ 2 nodes qualified for participating
in consensus, TO f announce reward/price for unit of mining
task σ > 0 and the total available task Υ, motivating nodes to

during maintenance, electricity, hardware loss and operation can
be considered. Thus, the utility of TO is expressed as:
In the second stage, each validator EV l ∈ N strategies its
mining task to maximize its own utility. The TOs’ strategy is their
reward, whereas each validator decides its participation based on
the TOs’ reward. The consensus plan of node l is represented by

assume that each participating validator node is available during
the consensus task, and all its activities are equally valuable
to the consensus process. If consensus plan τl = 0, it indicates
that node l is not willing to participate in the block validation
process. Let N validators are involved to validate task τl, the

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

benchmark schemes: PoW, PoS, PoR, and PBFT. We implement
the simulations using Python 3.6 environment on a computer

∑
l∈N τl < (Q− δ) then
5: The TO increase the price by Δγ;

with a Core i7 CPU running on a processor speed of 2.4 GHz and
16 GB RAM. The simulation considers the standard parameters
to assess a system’s performance like throughput, latency, EV’s
utility, and scalability. We consider a V2V network that consists
of three clusters connected with wireless links to a single MBS
via RSU. The EVs are clustered based on their current location,
speed, and direction. Each cluster has 10 to 30 seller and buyer
EVs and 10 to 70 validator EVs. The diameter of each cluster
is from 0 to 2 km. The RSUs have a transmission radius of 300
meters, and each EV has a speed range of 45 to 50 miles per
hour, with a 22KWh charging rate [51]. The Euclidean distance
between EV j and EV i range 5 to 100 meters and �min
j.i is
set to 5 dB. The blockchain system is implemented with the
Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The energy block size is set at
1.0 MB, with a 0.42 seconds block propagation delay. The size
of each transaction in the block ranges from 0 to 0.000573 MB.
We consider TOs with a range of 5 to 30 and validators with a
range of 10 to 70. The average transaction fee is set at 0.000062
ECoin. The simulation parameters are summarized in Table III.

SIMULATION PARAMETERS
B. Performance Analysis
The achievements of the PPoR consensus mechanism are
evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, utility optimization,
and scalability by considering three different scenarios.
First, we consider a clustered energy trading environment
with an increasing number of buyers and sellers. Second, we
assess the achievements of our proposed scheme in the non-
clustered trading environment as the number of sellers and
buyers increases. Finally, the achievement of PPoR is evaluated
by comparing it with benchmarks such as PoW, PoR, and PBFT.
The simulation results are analyzed as follows:
1) Throughput: It is the number of transactions processed by
the nodes in a network commonly expressed as transaction per
second (TPS). As the simulation results are shown in Fig. 6(a),
deploying PPoR in a clustered scenarios increases throughput by
9.91% from non-clustered one and slightly decreases when the
number of validators grows. Similarly, the simulation outcomes
shown in Fig. 7(a) reveals that the PPoR scheme yields more
throughput than PoW, PBFT, and PoR by 456.39%, 50.09%,
and 12.75%, respectively.

scenarios. (a) Cost of buyers. (b) Profit of sellers.
2) Latency: It is the time difference between the energy
request sent to the chain and the response received by the
energy buyers. The simulation outcomes presented in Fig. 6(b)
shows that the PPoR scheme decreases transaction processing
latency by 44.22% when it is used in a clustered energy trading
environment. Besides, as shown in Fig. 7(b), the transaction
processing latency of PPoR is reduced by 90.60 %, 66.20 %,
and 51.74 % compared to PoW, PBFT, and PoR, respectively.
3) Utility optimization: We evaluate the average profit gain
of energy sellers and average cost energy buyers incurred to
purchase energy.
The cost of energy buyers increases by 13.2% when the
number of competitor vehicles grows in the system, as shown
in Fig. 8(a). However, if the PPoR is used in a clustered energy
trading scenario, the cost increment is not significant. As shown
in Fig. 9(a), when we compare PPoR with other schemes, it
performs better to optimize energy buyers’ cost, where it de-
creases by 78.3%, 42.0%, and 21.1% from PoW, PBFT, and
PoR, respectively. Fig. 8(b), on the other hand, shows that the
gain of energy sellers increases as the number of buyers in
the trading system grows and decreases when the number of

sellers increases. Nonetheless, when PPoR is used in a clustered
trading environment, the profit decreases slightly. As shown in
Fig. 9(b), PPoR outperforms PoW, PBFT, and PoR to optimize
energy sellers’ profits by 42.1 %, 25%, and 18 %, respectively.
The simulation results also show that the proposed scheme
can effectively support buyers and sellers in energy trading to
balance the cost and profit of both parties.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive
scheme is assessed in terms of utility optimization. We assessed
the utility of TOs in light of the increasing number of TOs.
Compared to PoW, PBFT, and PoR, the PPoR improves the
utility of TOs by 28.01%, 19.10%, and 4.98%, respectively,
as shown in Fig. 10(a). In addition, we evaluated the utility
of validators in relation to the growing number of TOs. The
simulation result shown in Fig. 10(b) shows that the PPoR
scheme optimizes the utility of validators by 37.00%, 29.13%,
and 6.5% over PoW, PBFT, and PoR, respectively.
4) Scalability: It can be measured in terms of transaction
throughput and latency changes as the network size increases.
Also, Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 7(a) shows that the throughput of
PPoR and PoR decreases slightly with the increase of network
size when we compare them with PBFT, yet in PoW, the
throughput does not decrease significantly. However, the average
throughput of PPoR is higher than the benchmark schemes.
Furthermore, latency increases when the network size increase,
as shown in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 7(b). Our proposed scheme’s
transaction latency remains below 5 seconds when the network
size increases from 10 to 70 EVs, while it is higher than 5
seconds in PoR, PBFT, and PoW. This shows that the PPoR
consensus scheme is more scalable V2V energy trading than
the benchmarks. Thus, the simulation results show that our
scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in all metrics used
to compare their performance in the V2V energy trading system.
Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the proposed
scheme is more efficient under a clustered V2V energy trading
scenario.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed the PPoR consensus mechanism to
improve the efficiency of V2V energy sharing in the IoEV. The
consortium blockchain with SC is used to ensure the security
and privacy of the V2V energy trading system. The entities
participating in the trading process are clustered based on their
mobility information to shorten the consensus process and bal-
ance node involvement in the block validation. The two-stage
MLMF Stackelberg game is formulated to maximize the bene-
fits of both sellers and buyers. In addition, we also proposed
a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism that rewards
monetary incentives and mining value for cooperating nodes
while punishing misbehaving and malicious nodes to ensure the
system’s security. The simulation results show that the proposed
method improves throughput, transaction latency, and utility
optimization in the V2V energy trading. Furthermore, the PPoR
scheme can ensure the security and scalability of energy sharing
in the IoEV. Future work will improve the PPoR scheme by
incorporating cryptography and machine learning techniques to
enhance the system’s privacy and efficiency.
