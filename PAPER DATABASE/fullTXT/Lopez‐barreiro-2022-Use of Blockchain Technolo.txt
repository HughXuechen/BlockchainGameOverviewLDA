Abstract: Blockchain technology provides a distributed support for information storage and trace-
ability. Recently, it has been booming in a wide variety of domains: finance, food, energy, and health.
In the field of physical activity, physical exercise, sport, and active ageing, this technology could
also originate some interesting services introducing support for reliable repository of results, for
gamification, or for secure data interchange. This systematic review explores the use of blockchain in
this context. The objective is to determine to which extent this technology has fulfilled the potential of
blockchain to bring these new added-value services. The authors explored 5 repositories in search of
papers describing solutions applied to the above-mentioned frame. 17 papers were selected for full-
text analysis, and they displayed diverse applications of blockchain, such as Fitness and healthcare,
Sport, and Active ageing. A detailed analysis shows that the solutions found do not leverage all the
possibilities of blockchain technology. Most of the solutions analyzed use blockchain for managing,
sharing, and controlling access to data and do not exploit the possibilities of Smart Contracts or
oracles. Additionally, the advantages of the blockchain model have not been fully exploited to engage
users using approaches such as gamification.
Keywords: health promotion; DLT; training; sport activity; eHealth; fitness
1. Introduction
A new paradigm in the storage and management of data burst forth in 2008 under the
name of Blockchain (BC). In an article signed under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto,
a revolutionary technology to store and manage information in a P2P framework with
high-trust levels was introduced [1].
This innovative step forward is making possible a new paradigm in a broad spectrum
of domains [2–6] beyond cryptocurrencies, its best-known application. Among these new
areas of application, it is worth mentioning some examples such as stock management,
financial management, traceability of operations, or the processing of health records. The
latter area mentioned is one of the most significant application niches in the domain of
eHealth [7]. This work aims to explore to what extent BC may be a game changer in the
context of physical activity for health improvement and active ageing, in a broad sense.
From the point of view of the authors, this area can take advantage of this technology
as it provides with features such as decentralization, transparency, open source, autonomy,
immutability and anonymity [8]. Using these features, it would be possible to implement
services that may play a relevant role in this area, such as, the secure storage of sport results
without the need of a reliable third party involving (or not) decisions and consequences;
supporting gamification techniques, defined as “the use of game design elements in non-
game contexts” [9], among peers; triggering alerts in a fully automatic and decentralized

manner on data from sports or from biomedical sensors; and others interesting services
that may still be waiting to be discovered by the researchers of the domain. Nevertheless, it
must be kept in mind that its inherent drawbacks, such as the difficulty of data deletion or
the lack of privacy, should also be properly dealt with. Actually, there are several works
that show its application in medicine for the management of electronic health records
(eHR) [5,10,11] and how it is possible to make significant contributions in this domain
bearing the existing constraints.
The arrival of BC can be categorized as a major revolution in the frame of services on
the Web. This new model offers the possibility of outsourcing the reliable storage of data
and the support for its traceability without the need for trusted third parties [12].
After its introduction, this technology grew in momentum at high speed. Various
milestones were fulfilled and support for new advanced features were developed: new
networks with support for information storage of a more diverse nature such as Ethereum,
the introduction of complete Turing machines in the network itself through the use of Smart
Contracts (SC) [13], the provision of support for this technology through the BC as a service
(BaaS) model or the inclusion of oracles that allow the gathering of data from the “real
world” to be inserted in the “virtual world” for these networks [14–16]. These features
support a wide variety of services for the final user such as cryptocurrencies, traceability
records in the food industry or digital identity management.
“Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording
transactions and tracking assets in a business network” [17]. This information, due to the
nature of the system itself, becomes immutable. To this end, it relies on a P2P structure
in which the nodes that form part of the net collaborate with each other to guarantee the
inviolability of the data and its high availability, which is not dependent on the failure of
any particular server [8,12]. This last aspect, the non-dependence on a particular server and
therefore under the management of a third party, allows it to become the right tool when it
is better not to rely on any third party. All the agents in the network themselves validate
the records and add them to a chain of data blocks (hence the name of the technology) that
constitutes the aforementioned ledger of records [18].
Each time an agent involved in the system intends to introduce a new block in this so-
called main ledger, it is necessary for all the nodes of the network to reach an agreement on
the validity of this new block. This is done by means of a specific protocol that establishes
the objective criteria for the acceptance or rejection of a block in the chain. This protocol,
called consensus algorithm, can rely on different features or require different conditions to
the nodes proposing the inclusion of a new block in the chain. Among the most popular
algorithms of this type, there are two that account for most of these systems. The most
common one is the so-called Proof of Work (PoW) [19], which requires nodes (or miners in
this model) to solve a complex mathematical problem to justify the inclusion of the new
block in the network. This would be the model chosen for the famous Bitcoin network.
Also, it is quite common to use the Proof of Authority (PoA) [20] as a consensus algorithm.
Under this model, the inclusion of new blocks of records are based on the relevance of
the node proposing the new block. This second model is much more efficient in terms of
energy consumption (as no complex mathematical problem needs to be solved) but, on the
other hand, it can be considered “less democratic” as it privileges certain pre-selected nodes
whose privileges are different from the other nodes on the net. Also, in addition to these
models mentioned, there are a myriad of different algorithms. Among the most prominent,
it is worth mentioning Proof of Stake (PoS) [19], Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), PoB
(Proof of Burn) [21], Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) [22], Istanbul Byzantine
Fault Tolerance (IBFT) [23], or the Raft Consensus [24]. It can be considered that the design
of new algorithms for this purpose is an area of active research.
Besides allowing data storage using this distributed information paradigm, BC net-
works offer other technical features that can provide value-added services. In particular, it
is convenient to highlight two remarkable tools in this environment:
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 3 of 19
• Smart Contracts (SC): This feature provides to these, in principle, “passive” informa-
tion storage networks with the possibility of proactively making decisions in the face
of changes in their environment. By means of these scripts, the network is provided
with the possibility of carrying out transactions and making decisions autonomously.
In other words, the network nodes themselves carry out the planned operations on
the data. This operation does not only fulfill without any human interaction but, as a
matter of fact, no human intervention may prevent them from being executed even if
they want to [13].
• Oracles: These agents are in charge to capture data from the real world and to introduce
it in the ledger of the blockchain platform considered. This way, SCs are able to also
use that information for taking the decisions implemented on their code. These agents,
whether software or hardware, are considered to be trustable and, usually, require no
human intervention for capturing and inserting data [16].
In the frame of this technology and due to the features already mentioned, a new
concept was introduced recently. As a way to assign unique or non-fungible items to a
certain user, the so-called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) were introduced. These units of
data stored on the BC prove that a certain user is in possession of a token that is unique,
trackable, and interchangeable. Even though they can be considered as a speculative asset
in certain contexts, it may be quite useful in some scenarios, for example, to reward users
in gamification contexts [25].
This new paradigm also is quite adequate for the delivery of the final solutions using
non-conventional approaches. As a matter of fact, in order to fully exploit the potential of
this model, it is common to make use of the so-called Decentralized Applications (DApps),
either for mobile environments or for conventional ones. These apps may be hosted on a
P2P environment using BC (or other P2P network) as the backend for data and for logic,
relying on rules codified as SC [26,27].
These enhanced capabilities may make BC preferable to other alternatives that have
been known for a long time, such as relational databases or NoSQL models. These tech-
nologies, as the reader may note, just provide support for data storage but are deprived of
the additional features of BC already described in Section 1. However, it is important to
note that these technologies are not mutually exclusive, i.e., in many contexts the combined
use of several of these technologies leads to interesting outputs for the project. It may
be also noted that in many environments the use of BC technology does not seem fully
justified. This is due to the fact that the specific services offered by BC are not fully used
and the additional cost derived from the complexity required by this type of solutions is
not justified.
Practitioners of the domain have also to face an issue regarding privacy. Due to the
nature of the BC, all nodes in the P2P network are aware of the data included in each
block of data. If countermeasures are not considered, this may pose an issue regarding
ethical and legal constraints. In particular, General Data Protection Regulation, for the
European domain (GDPR) [28], Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act., in Canada (PIPEDA) [29], Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act., in
USA (HIPAA) [30], and Personal Information Protection Law, in China (PIPL) [31] present
some mandatory features and services that must be considered in any solution presented to
be used in their correspondent scopes. This may not be something obvious. As a matter of
fact, some authors claim for a reconsideration of these schemes in the light of the potential
problems with this technology [32].
Also, a noteworthy obstacle that may prevent its adoption is the low maturity of this
technology. The fast rate of obsolescence of tools and protocols versions may be an issue
for the maintenance of solutions, given the low number of professionals properly trained
in this technology. Nevertheless, presently, cloud-based services for BC are becoming more
and more popular [33]. As a matter of fact, in recent times, it is possible to host a BC under
the model Blockchain as a Service (BaaS). This way, the setting and managing of the BC net
is completely externalized from the project [15].

By focusing efforts within the area of eHealth in a broad way and knowing the health
benefits produced by the practice of physical activity, the aim of this systematic review is to
explore to what extent and how this technology has been leveraged in relation to physical
exercise (PE), physical activity (PA), sport and active ageing (AA).
These terms have been misunderstood over time. Therefore, the following are defi-
nitions of each of them. PA is classically defined as any bodily movement produced by
skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure [34]. PE is a subset of PA that is planned,
structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an intermediate objective the improvement
or maintenance of physical fitness [34]. Sport is any human physical and intellectual activ-
ity, competitive in nature, and governed by institutionalized rules [35]. And finally, AA
as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), “Active ageing is the process of
optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security in order to enhance quality
of life as people age. Active ageing applies to both individuals and population groups” [36].
The motivation for this study arises from its obvious potential for a world with an
increasing average age, material possibilities for preventive and health-oriented sport
practice, as well as a high penetration of Information and Communication Technology
(ICT). In particular, it is intended to address the problem posed in a generic way, through
the research questions shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Research question aimed to answer through this systematic review.
Research Question Statement
RQ1
To what extent has the use of blockchain-related solutions been
explored so far in the fields of physical exercise, physical activity,
sport, and active ageing?
RQ2 From the identified use cases, what are the benefits (actual and
potential) derived from this technology?
RQ3 To what extent have the identified use cases taken advantage of
the technical possibilities of blockchain?
RQ: research question.
To answer these questions, the scientific literature was surveyed to identify the published
articles since 1 January 2018 that discuss novel research targeted at the introduction of BC in
the field of PE, PA, sport, and AA. This study would ultimately serve to highlight the potential
of BC in the already explored or unexplored field of PE, PA, sport, and AA; to detect existing
gaps, and to provide the groundwork for new lines of research in this domain.
Section 2 of this document discusses the methodology and tools applied to identify
the relevant scientific literature to answer the research questions posed. Section 3 describes
the results of applying this methodology, namely the identification of 17 relevant articles
fulfilling the requirements established in Section 2. Section 4 shows the analysis of the
articles selected. Finally, Section 5 offers the conclusions drawn from this systematic review
2. Materials and Methods
This review was driven by the general principles of the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [37]. According to this approach, a
search strategy was defined, eligibility criteria were established, and a selection process
was followed. As a result, a corpus of documents was obtained that will allow us to obtain
results in terms of the proposed search.
2.1. Search Strategy
The following normative databases were used to conduct the search process for the
PRISMA start-up phase on 20 October 2021: Web of Science (WoS), ProQuest, Pubmed,
Scopus and SportDiscus.
The objective of the search was to locate studies that addressed (1) the use of blockchain
technology and (2) applied in the field of PE, PA, sport, and AA.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 5 of 19
According to the search requirements, the standard query consisted of two blocks of
terms, one for each condition above, linked by logical AND operators. Within each block
the terms related to the search condition were linked by logical OR operators:
(“Blockchain” OR “DLT” OR “Hyperledger”) (1) AND (“endurance training” OR
“strength training” OR “resistance training” OR fitness OR growth OR “growing up” OR
“healthy life” OR “older people” OR “elder people” OR elderly OR aging OR sport OR
exercise OR “physical activity” OR “physical activities” OR “ageing”) (2)
Query results from the databases considered, filtered by title and abstract, were
uploaded to Zotero.
An informal search of external sources was also conducted. In particular, papers
available on Google Scholar, Slashdot, The Verge, and Reddit were investigated. The results
of this process were also incorporated into Zotero.
2.2. Eligibility Criteria
Only articles written in English and published from 1 January 2018 to 20 October 2021
that were relevant to answering the research questions were considered.
The following exclusion criteria were used:
1. Works not clearly focused on the field of PE, PA, sport, or AA.
2. Systematic review articles.
3. Doctoral theses.
4. Articles focused on the technical characteristics of the BC protocol itself.
2.3. Selection Process
The files corresponding to the searches in each database were imported using the
JabRef program to eliminate duplicates. Once these were eliminated, the complete list
was exported to a spreadsheet to manage the review of each one of them. The articles
were divided into two blocks for their first analysis. In this phase, each of the articles was
reviewed by two specialists, one from the technical field and one from the health field.
In the screening phase, based on the information contained in the title and abstract,
the relevance of each article to answer the research questions was evaluated, labeling each
article on a scale from 0 (not relevant at all) to 3 (totally relevant), as done in another
review [38]. Articles with an average of 2.5 or 3 points, made it directly to the next phase.
Articles with an average of 0, 0.5 or 1 point, were discarded. Correspondingly, the articles
rated with an average of 1.5 or 2 points were evaluated again to decide whether they finally
entered the full-text analysis phase or were discarded.
Afterwards, the articles considered for the next phase, full-text analysis, were again
assigned to pairs of reviewers from the ICT and health fields, but avoiding the reviewers
assigned in the first phase. Again, in case of discrepancies in the scoring, another pair of
reviewers would take part again to resolve the decision.
3. Results
As above mentioned, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review, based
on the PRISMA methodology, to analyze and combine the results of selected studies on
the novel use of BC technology in the field of PE, PA, sport, and AA. As shown in Figure 1,
during the initial search, 2100 articles found in the selected databases and 52 articles found
in other sources, 48 of them from Google Scholar using a similar search query, were added.
After elimination of duplicates, 1347 articles were screened by title and abstract and rated
between 0 and 3 according to their relevance to the research. After rating, in the mean
score, 1278 articles received less than 1 point, 40 articles were rated with 2 points, 13 works
received 2.5 points and 16 received a 3-point score.

query, were added. After elimination of duplicates, 1347 articles were screened by title 
and abstract and rated between 0 and 3 according to their relevance to the research. Af-
ter rating, in the mean score, 1278 articles received less than 1 point, 40 articles were rat-
ed with 2 points, 13 works received 2.5 points and 16 received a 3-point score. 
The works rated with an average of 2.5 or 3 points, made it directly to the next 
phase. Correspondingly, the articles rated with an average of 1.5 or 2 points were evalu-
ated again to decide whether they finally entered the final phase or were eliminated. Fi-
nally, 29 papers rated with 2.5 or 3 points, and one paper rated with 1.5 or 2 points, were 
included in the next phase after being reevaluated by the other pair of reviewers. In total 
30 papers were selected for full text reading. Among these 30 papers, 13 were finally 
eliminated because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Four papers were eliminated 
under the label “Not related to PE, PA, sport, or ageing” [32,39–41], six under the label 
“Focused on the BC properties, not applications” [32,42–46], and finally four papers 
were removed for other reasons (preliminary theoretical proposal, mechanisms for 
avoidance of fraud in the soccer transfer market, theoretical explanation) [47–50]. 
 
Figure 1. Flow diagram of the systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. 
Finally, 17 articles were selected [51–67], and analyzed in depth, focusing mainly on 
extracting information on: (1) scope; (2) service proposal; (3) Technology readiness level 
(TRL); (4) information stored; and (5) use of BC properties.

On Table 2 it is shown the definition for each TRL according to the European Union
TRL definition [68]. Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of the articles that made it
to the final phase. The reader can check the key aspects of each paper and set a starting
point for future research in the field of the application of BC technology in the world of
PE, PA, sport, and AA. The papers are grouped under three labels according to the field of
application “Fitness and healthcare”, “Sport” and “Active ageing”. Under “Fitness and
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 7 of 19
healthcare” we find four works (23.5%), “Sport” includes six papers (35.3%) and “Active
ageing” comprises another seven papers (41.2%). TRL is a scale for estimating the maturity
of technologies during the acquisition phase of a program based on a scale from 1 to 9, with
9 being the most mature technology. The TRL level assigned to each paper is based on the
interpretation of the authors, as it is not explicitly specified in any of them, obtaining a
range between level 2 and 6.

Regarding the contribution of the BC to store data (one the main features of BC), two
options were identified: “Actual data”, i.e., information is directly stored on the BC as it
is gathered; and “Pointers and hash of actual data”, i.e., information is stored elsewhere,
and BC is used to ensure the invariability of information. Fourteen (82.4%) of the selected
studies were included in the first case [51–59,63–67], and the remaining three (17.7%) fit
on the second option [60–62]. This decision is highly related to what extent advanced
properties of BC are deployed in each particular case. As the reader can note, some works
use different properties in line with the actual goal aimed at. The reader can check this
in the last column of Table 3 where it can be measured the contribution of the properties
applied from BC with the service offered on each work.
In order to provide a more in-depth description of the works included, the following
analysis is provided. It specifies the proposal for each paper, the use of BC features and
performance analysis if available.
A number of contributions may fit under the label “Fitness and Healthcare”. This
way, [51] proposed a platform to boost physical activity and promote a healthy lifestyle
through gamification and rewarding users for meeting their goals with cryptocurrencies
managed in a BC platform. This could help to promote a more active life by improving
the health of users. Regretfully, as the authors mention, malicious users could be able to
manipulate the platform to obtain undeserved rewards.
In [53], health data from users is stored in electronic health records (eHR) to make
diagnosis and treatment easier and more cost effective. As a limitation of the work, authors
report performance issues using the PoW consensus algorithm on Raspberry Pi 3. To
enhance the performance, PoA was the final decision as consensus algorithm. Using Jetson
TX1, both algorithms work correctly but the energy consumption increases a lot.
Finally, [55,56] assigned training and diet programs to each user based on anthro-
pometric and body composition data. Both used BC to provide security and integrity
to sensing data. Furthermore [56] allowed the transfer of user profiles stored in the BC
between different sports centers. They reported some issues with throughput and latency
when peers and transactions increased. Ref. [55] states that their developed system using
permissioned BC network solves some inherent issues, such as data scalability, security,
and identity. Also, the SC integrated inference engine used significantly enhances system
performance in terms of throughput and resource utilization.

Referring to the category devoted to sport, some works has shown to be relevant for
this study. In [67], authors developed a model to improve and guide training using athletes’
physiological data. According to the authors, such a data collection system stored on a BC
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 9 of 19
platform can make manage transactions in an open and transparent manner. Regretfully,
as in other works, no assessment on the system performance is included. The model
developed by [52] can capture data and predict performance to improve training programs.
The work is focused on prediction accuracy but not performance information is included.
In [58], the users walking patterns obtained from wearable sensors to design running
auxiliary training programs. BC technology was used to design a data transmission and
storage plan for the protection and analysis of the user’s personal privacy data. The authors
report increases in latency times as security requirements increase. In [59], a model for
storing data regarding belt promotions in Taekwondo was developed to keep track of
scores and to bring transparency and immutability to that information. Regretfully, they do
not mention any performance test or analytic data in this regard. In other similar work, [63],
proposed a system for real-time capture and management of athlete fitness data. In this
work, BC is used to make data private; regretfully, performance tests are not mentioned.
Lastly, [54] captured player performance data to make tactical decisions on the spot and in
time. They designed a BC system so, according to the authors, professional sports teams
can apply Big Data analysis. Again, no performance analysis is included.
In the frame of active ageing, [65] proposed an application to promote active ageing
and assess the level of physical activity practice and quality of life. BC was used to provide
privacy, control, and ownership over users’ data; and to support dynamic source reputation
and consistent quality of service in complex sensor networks. In [57], it is developed
a system that provides alerts if normal patterns of behavior change. They introduced
BC to protect data and prevent scams or frauds that might jeopardize people’s privacy.
Additionally, [66] proposed a system to persistently control the informed consent in studies
powered by BC technology to ensure transparency. None of the above-mentioned papers
reported any performance tests.
Following with the authors who researched on active ageing, [61] developed a system
to control smart home devices using gesture recognition. They used BC to provide security,
trust, digital identity, and privacy preservation. In their work they had latency problems
due the high throughput of the gesture tracking algorithm. This data, once captured, is
parsed, and sent to the private, permissioned BC, which approves the transaction and
add the data to the IPFS storage. The complexity of the model produces an expected
larger latency. In [64], physiological data from patients is captured and secured using a BC
platform. According to the authors, although there was a small increase in the access time
to medical data, it was not significantly impacted by their privacy control based on BC. In
other work, [62] determined the risk factors for falls and developed a model to predict them
through SCs. By mean of these SCs, they manage the risk values and the priority against
each risk factor, then the risk for falls is calculated and alerts sent to interested agents if it is
necessary. They used BC to address security and privacy challenges for the data exchange.
No report of performance is included. And finally, in [60], a model to assign therapies
according to the treatment needs of the users is presented. BC was used to preserve the
therapeutic data privacy, ownership, generation, storage, and sharing. Authors conclude
that the mean processing delay increases as the number of users increases.

3.1. BC Platform Used, Access Policy and Deployment Scheme, Consensus Algorithm and
End-User Delivery Support
As shown in Table 5, regarding the BC platform used, the most popular one is Hyper-
ledger Fabric (HF) with eight works (47.1%), followed by Ethereum with five works (29.4%)
and, finally, Vexanium with one work (5.9%). Five of the included studies do not report
the BC platform used (29.4%). Regarding access policy and deployment scheme, nine
(52.9%) of the studies use permissioned BC (i.e., only can be accessed by authorized users),
of which five works (29.4%) stated that use a permissioned private BC; one work (5.9%)
uses consortium BC (i.e., multiple organizations govern the P2P network hosting the BC),
and three studies (17.7%) do not specify; and one study (5.9%) uses public BC (i.e., access
available for all Internet users). The remaining seven works do not report the access policy
and deployment scheme (41.2%). Regarding the consensus algorithm, two of the papers
(11.8%) use DPoS, two use PBFT, and one paper (5.9%) uses PoW or PoA; another one
(5.9%) uses PoW or DPoS; and the last one (5.9%) uses Raft Consensus. Ten of the included
papers (58.8%) do not report the consensus algorithm used. Referring to the end-user
delivery support, there are different options: applications through web browsers (Web
App) and through smartphones (Mobile App); and decentralized applications through web
browsers (Web DApps) and through smartphones (Mobile DApps). Of these options, three
contributions (17.7%) use Web and Mobile App, another two ones (11.8%) use a Web App,
two papers (11.8%) use Web and Mobile DApp, and another one (5.9%) uses a Web DApp
and a Mobile App. Nine of the studies (52.9%) do not report the end-user delivery support.

3.2. Level of Use of BC Specific Properties
Regarding the specific properties of BC, nine studies (52.9%) use SC [51,53,55–57,60–62,66]
and the remaining eight (47.1%) do not indicate their use. The 17 included studies justify
the use of BC by supporting its special properties such as decentralization, transparency,
open source, autonomy, immutability, and anonymity [8]. None of them reported the use
of oracles.
3.3. Proposal Validation Level
Table 6 shows the proposal validation level. The level of validation of the proposal
of each study has been labeled under four tags, from lowest to highest level of validation.
“Theoretical proposal”, “Laboratory tests”, “Real-life testing” and “Real-life use in real
situations”. “Theoretical proposal” refers to the theoretical explanation of the operation
without verifying it, “Laboratory tests” refers to testing by simulating operation, without
acquiring data in real situation, “Real-life testing” refers to performance testing by capturing
data in a controlled laboratory environment and, “Real-life use in real situations” refers to
the implementation in real situations of the developed technology. We categorized four
(23.5%), eight (47.1%), two (11.8%) and two (11.8%) studies respectively under each label.
Only one study (5.9%) did not describe the validation level adequately.

3.4. Relevant Contributions Identified
Table 7 shows the remarkable contributions to be assessed in the included studies. On
the on hand, we found features belonging to the technological domain and on the other
hand belonging to the physical exercise, physical activity, sport, and active ageing domain.
One (5.9%) of the 17 studies makes use of cryptocurrencies as an incentive for users [51].
All the 17 studies make use of the special features of BC to provide security, immutability,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 13 of 19
and transparency of the data. Four (23.5%) of the studies use algorithms to predict future
events [52,55,56,62]. Six (35.3%) of contributions capture real-time data [54,57,60,61,63,64].
And thirteen (76.5%) of papers focus on health maintenance and AA [51,53–58,60–62,64–66].
Finally, four (23.5%) of the selected works focus on sport performance [52,59,63,67]. It
should be noted that no study includes NFTs to reward users, nor do they use training
programs, diets, or healthy recommendations based on scientific evidence.
3.5. Level of Compliance with Data Protection Laws
Regarding compliance with data protection laws, only four (23.5%) of the studies
explicitly report compliance. One study (5.9%) complies with HIPAA [60], two studies
(11.8%) comply with GDPR [65,66], and one paper (5.9%) states that it complies with data
protection laws but does not detail which one [62]. The remaining 13 studies (76.5%) do
not explicitly report compliance with any of the regulating laws governing data protection.
The results of the present review may provide important implications for future
research with respect to BC technology in the field of PE, PA, sport, and AA.

4. Discussion
In this section, we present a discussion of the data retrieved from the 17 publications
analyzed. We proposed three research questions (Table 1), which are discussed here:
1. RQ1: To what extent has the use of blockchain-related solutions been explored so far
in the fields of physical exercise, physical activity, sport, and active ageing?
In this systematic review, we explored publications from 1 January 2018 to 20 October
2021 in the top databases and gray literature, using the search query mentioned in Section 1.
Despite performing this search in October 2021, that year contributed the largest number of
publications to our final selection, as shown in Table 3, with eight publications. This may
suggest that the relationship between PE, PA, sport, and active ageing with BC technology
are still in their first steps of development, agreeing with previous reviews conducted in
similar fields [2–6].
Regarding the level of development and use of BC technology, as shown in Table 3,
we can see that it is at a very early stage of development as indicated by the TRL and the
limited use of the special properties that BC offers.
It is, therefore, remarkable the lack of concrete application of the specific features of BC
such as decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and immutability; process automation
through SC; or reliability in the data included into the network through oracles [16]. In the
opinion of the authors, the use of SC to automate processes and the possibility to insert
data into the chain of blocks in a reliable and objective manner by oracles are differentiating
elements that may play a paramount role in the near future. Another recent systematic
review [7] focused on the field of healthcare and BC also tells us about the few papers
found related to health education and training as well as the early stage of development of
BC technology in different fields related to healthcare.
2. RQ2: From the identified use cases, what are the benefits (actual and potential) derived
from this technology?
Regarding the service offered, as shown in Table 3, they range from simply providing
an immutable database for data recording [59], capturing real-time data in sport to make
decisions based on them [54,63], using algorithms to predict the future performance of
athletes based on data stored in the BC [52] or, to predict the risk of falls [62]. Among the
various advantages, we also find other works such as [51] that encourages users to lead a
healthy lifestyle and meet their goals of PA through rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.
In the same line is oriented the work of [65] that proposes using BC technology to capture
data through questionnaires and different sensors to promote AA and assess different
factors related to physical well-being. Referring to the special properties of BC, we find
works ranging from the most basic, providing immutability, transparency, reliability, and
security to the data; other works in which access to the data is restricted only to certain
agents; to a full use to support cryptocurrencies to be used as an incentive.
Table 5 also shows the end-user delivery support referring to Web Apps, Mobile Apps,
Web DApps and Mobile DApps. Only three papers use DApps. This may suggest that the
full potential of this technology has not yet been fully exploited. As the reader may note,
BC technology gets more interesting when DApps make the most of BC features. This way,
DApps can be completely hosted in the BC P2P system and operate without the need for
human intervention for decision making in the backend for business logic, since they rely on
rules coded as SC [26,27]. This indicates to us, just as reported in RQ1, that this technology is
in its early stages of development and its full potential has not been yet reached.
On the other hand, the inherent characteristics of BC technology also have certain
drawbacks such as limited data privacy and the consequent difficulty in complying with
various data protection laws. As shown in Table 8, only four of the 17 final papers included
indicate that they are compliant with data protection laws in their corresponding frames.
Another paper claims compliance with data protection law but does not mention which
one [62]. Two of the works that claim to be compliant with data protection laws make it by
storing the pointers to the data and its hash in the BC and the data payload in the distributed
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 16 of 19
storage [60,62]. Another one relies on the use of firewalls, user/device authentication and
communication service based on HTTPS [65] and a final one with a BC platform for consent
management that allow users to monitor and manage their consent in real time and with
granular variable control [66].
Table 8. Compliance with data protection laws.
Compliance with Data Protection Laws References
Yes [60,62,65,66]
Not reported [51–59,61,63,64,67]
These gaps in data protection laws compliance may be due to the novelty of this
technology. It might be appropriate to also assess the need for an update of these laws to
adapt to technological advances as stated in [32]. Although the current trend is focused
on the possibility of designing SC that revoke access making the data inaccessible by third
parties once the data retention time has expired; the data is modified and the updated data
is saved in a new block; or for any other reason [64,69,70]. Another alternative that has
been discussed is the use of irreversible encryption, i.e., when the retention time of the data
has expired, it can be permanently encrypted so that it cannot be reversed and retrieved. In
both options, the data is not erased, it remains stored, but in an unreadable form [69].
3. RQ3: To what extent have the identified use cases taken advantage of the technical
possibilities of blockchain?
Table 7 shows the noteworthy contributions of the 17 studies, in which we can see that
all the papers use BC to give data security and transparency. One of the works incentivizes
its users to carry out a healthy life through gamification, and cryptocurrencies. According
to [71], money has a significant impact on people’s behavior. But it is remarkable the
inexistence of a feature that is booming in the context of this technology such as the use of
NFTs to give “medals” or “rewards” for achievements or goals of PA practice, for example.
This could encourage, as in the case of [51], the practice of PA and the achievement of the
proposed training goals. This lack of use of NFTs may be due to the low development of
Web Apps or Mobile Apps proposed in most of the works instead of DApps. As indicated
by [27], tokenization requires the implementation of DApps that enable modeling different
goods in a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) system as digital assets that can be issued
and transferred according to a predefined set of rules.
5. Conclusions
This systematic review aimed to identify the level of penetration of blockchain as a sup-
porting technology in the considered domain. The promising potential of this technology
led to considering it as a suitable tool in added-value services. After the research conducted,
it is possible to state that the rise of BC technology is at an early stage of development and
its implementation is very limited. However, some first concrete proposals for the use of
this technology in this area were identified.
Most of the proposals analyzed have a very low level of technological development and
provide little information about the low-level details of implementation and deployment.
Also, most of them do not take advantage of specific BC features such as SC, oracles or
NFTs. Scientific evidence is not used to provide training programs or healthy lifestyle
recommendations. Gamification, a feature very suitable in the frame of this technology, is
not leveraged to “trick” and “engage” users.
Most of the solutions reviewed are far from making the most of the potential benefits
from this technology. The use of DApps, the benefits from SC, the inclusion of reliable
oracles, the advanced support of gamification, or data verification possibilities are not yet
fully exploited. Researchers and practitioners still have room to improve the solutions and
to bring the promises of BC to actual implementations in this field. New generations of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8129 17 of 19
DApps are to be developed and introduced in the society to support the new and promising
features of BC.
