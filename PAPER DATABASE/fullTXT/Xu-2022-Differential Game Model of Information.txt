Abstract: In the development of traditional supply-chain finance, the information asymmetry of all
parties in the supply chain has become the primary problem hindering its development. Blockchain
technology is an effective method to solve the problem of information silos. Based on differential
game theory, this paper constructs a game model of supply-chain financial information-sharing
behavior based on blockchain technology. Three scenarios of independent decision, the cost-subsidy
mechanism of financial institutions, and dealers and collaborative decisions are studied, and the
theoretical model is verified through a simulation algorithm. The results show that information
sharing in supply-chain finance based on blockchain technology is much higher than that of tradi-
tional supply-chain finance, and the use of blockchain technology can promote more sustainable
development of supply chains. Blockchain technology can effectively solve the information-silo effect,
and the information sharing cost-subsidy mechanism can effectively relieve the cost pressure of
information sharing and optimize the supply-chain structure. In addition, the amount of information
and benefits shared among the three parties of supply-chain finance based on blockchain technology
and the overall benefits show an increasing and stabilized trend over time. This study provides a
reference for supply-chain finance members to reasonably choose the optimal strategic behavior.
Keywords: supply-chain finance; block chain technique; amount of information shared; differential
game; sustainable supply chain
1. Introduction
Since 2016, Chinese ministries and commissions have repeatedly mentioned the con-
struction of innovative supply-chain finance. In 2021, the chip crisis occurred in the United
States, and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the director of the National Economic
Council hosted a chip industry summit to discuss the lack of cores that have brought U.S.
auto production to a standstill. Although the ministry had called on companies in different
industrial sectors to submit commercial data on their supply chains, many companies
refused. They fear that the ministry might request confidential pricing information and
fail to improve supply transparency, resulting in the shutdown of car production. Because
of the complexity of the supply-chain system and the concern of commercial disclosure
among enterprises, the information-silo effect is inevitable. Therefore, in order to promote
effective communication among supply-chain members and improve the transparency of
the supply chain, it is urgent to reform the traditional model of supply-chain finance.
Supply-chain finance mainly relies on the credit endorsement of core enterprises to
obtain more financing opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It can
effectively solve the problems of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-
sized enterprises. However, with the development of technology such as logistics, the
supply-chain finance system has developed into a more diversified and complex cross-
regional financial system. Globalization, diversification of regulatory policy, and different

cultures and human behavior in supply-chain networks make the evaluation and risk
management in the complex network information nearly impossible [1]. The information-
sharing problem of supply-chain finance has become more prominent. The traditional
supply-chain financing model cannot adapt to the rapid development of the market, and a
highly complex supply chain, resulting in further deterioration of the original information-
sharing problem [2]. As a result, the following two problems have emerged.
The first problem is the information-silo effect of the supply chain. The supply-chain
system involves many enterprises, and the transaction information is scattered among
many enterprises. The complexity of the system requires rigorous auditing for information
access, and the emergence of a multi-layered supply chain leads to the further extension
of audit time. Therefore, core enterprises cannot quickly access the information of each
enterprise. The high cost of information transmission also seriously hinders the flow rate
of information, resulting in the fragmentation of supply-chain financial information. The
costs of reliability and transparency design complicate the traceability management in
supply-chain finance, causing further issues such as reputational competition [3].
The second problem is information asymmetry. As an open economy, supply-chain
finance performs less well than cluster enterprises [4]. Product manufacturers have a natural
advantage in controlling and hiding the quantity, accuracy, and type of products. The
conflict of interest among supply-chain members causes manufacturers to hide information
from other members. This highly controlled information flow also hinders the efficiency of
information sharing and supply-chain finance [5,6]. In order to solve the problems caused
by information silo and information asymmetry, supply-chain finance has to focus on core
functions and develop toward cooperation such as outsourcing, advanced value chain, and
open innovation [4].
With the emergence and development of blockchain technology, its decentraliza-
tion and high transparent characteristics have attracted the attention of many scholars.
Blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed ledger technology based on computer
programs [7]. Its essence is to jointly maintain the reliability of the database through
decentralization and distrust, with the advantages of good credit and high security. Many
experts and scholars have studied the development of blockchain technology. They analyze
the advantages of blockchain technology and the limitations of the current development of
supply-chain finance, making them closely associated. Blockchain technology combines
the characteristics of decentralized “untrusted” databases. It ensures the immutability
of data and the public accessibility of data flows, allowing transactions on a global scale,
disintermediation of processes, and multi-party decentralization. In this way, the problem
of information silo in supply-chain finance can be effectively solved. Furthermore, the new
decentralized tracking capability system of blockchain technology can support the visibility
of products at the logistics stage through appropriate real-time information sharing under
product security. The information asymmetry can be reduced, and the efficiency, reliability,
and transparency of the entire supply chain can be improved [8–16]. Blockchain technology
also reduces the risk of information sharing and data systems, bringing more security to
the flow of information between all supply-chain finance participants.
In the context of global sustainability, the selection of suppliers has become more
multidimensional and complex to ensure a green and efficient supply chain [17,18]. In ad-
dition to solving the problem of information silos within the supply chain financial system,
blockchain technology can also promote the sustainable development of the supply-chain
system in the natural, social, and economic fields [11,19]. First, blockchain technology can
select appropriate supply-chain participants according to the green performance of compa-
nies. The green and safe driving behavior of logistics drivers, ecological design, and envi-
ronmental performance of the whole supply chain are systematically monitored. Alongside
the improved transparency of carbon credit through the trust mechanism, carbon-emission
trading mechanisms within the supply chain can be promoted [20–22], thus enhancing the
circularity of the supply-chain system [23–26]. Second, the supply chain provides credit
loans to many SMEs that cannot be financed by banks to solve their financial problems,
Sustainability 2022, 14, 7139 3 of 21
providing a large number of jobs for society and reducing the unemployment rate. The ap-
plication of blockchain technology further improves the work efficiency, security, and health
of the supply chain and avoids corruption among participants with high transparency [27].
Third, blockchain technology can quickly and accurately track the transaction of the supply
chain in the first place. It improves the transparency and efficiency of the supply chain and
the accessibility and quality of information, effectively preventing commercial corruption.
A healthy and transparent enterprise can increase the brand reputation and profits, leading
to improved supply-chain economics [28–30].
At present, most studies on blockchain technology in supply-chain finance adopt
various analytical methods such as literature analysis, qualitative analysis, and evolutionary
game [23–38]. These studies analyze the application of blockchain technology in the supply-
chain finance models, development situations, and the benefit distribution of supply-chain
members. Regarding the ecosystems and costs of the supply chain, these studies have
ignored the importance of information sharing in supply-chain finance and the mechanism
of blockchain technology in the game process. The decentralized characteristics and
open thinking of blockchain technology can effectively improve the accuracy of financial
information sharing in the supply chain and the benefit of each member of the supply
chain [31–38]. However, the advantages of blockchain technology in sharing financial
information in the supply chain and the mechanism of blockchain technology are not
analyzed with intuitive data. Differential game theory is usually applied to fields such as
dynamics and environmental problems [39–42].
This paper analyzes the information-sharing problem using differential game theory in
the context of the traditional supply chain and blockchain-based supply chain. The mecha-
nism of blockchain technology is analyzed based on the non-cooperative game, Stackelberg
master-slave game, and Nash game. Furthermore, this study discusses the technology
to solve the information-sharing problem and explores the optimal decision of the three
parties of supply chain finances, thus ensuring the adequacy, security, and efficiency of
information sharing. The findings of this study can improve the transparency of the supply
chain, optimize the structure of the supply-chain system, improve the endogeneity of the
supply-chain financial system, and promote its sustainable development.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a supply chain
financing model based on blockchain technology; Section 3 establishes the differential
game model of information sharing behavior; Section 4 is the numerical simulation and
sensitivity analysis; Section 5 presents the discussion and conclusions.
2. Supply Chain Financing Model Based on Blockchain Technology
For the convenience of study, this paper only considers the supply chain finance system
with one supplier, one distributor, and one financial institution. The supplier is a small
and medium-sized enterprise, and the distributor is the core enterprise. The core of the
supply-chain financing model embedded with blockchain technology is the supply-chain
system. With the natural distributed characteristics of blockchain, it effectively integrates
logistics, business flow, and capital flow into the system. The problem of financing credit
investigation for SMEs can be solved, thus realizing an efficient and transparent supply
chain. Its basic framework is shown in Figure 1. Core enterprises and financial institutions
register and input information into the blockchain and obtain electronic signatures. They
can check the transaction process, repayment situation, and other information through
electronic signatures. Technical support parties insert pre-defined terms into the blockchain
to form smart contracts that fully automate the transaction process and reduce the risk of
human intervention. Core enterprises issue digital payment promises to SMEs (suppliers)
on the blockchain, and suppliers can split the promises and transfer some promises to
the next level of suppliers, enabling the decentralized financing method. When the target
amount of financing is fully completed, the smart contract can automatically transfer the
raised funds to the SMEs. After each transaction is completed by SMEs, the information

is transferred to the blockchain to realize the bookkeeping by core enterprises, financial
institutions, and SMEs, ensuring the timeliness of the information.

and reduce the risk of human intervention. Core enterprises issue digital payment prom-
ises to SMEs (suppliers) on the blockchain, and suppliers can split the promises and trans-
fer some promises to the next level of suppliers, enabling the decentralized financing 
method. When the target amount of financing is fully completed, the smart contract can 
automatically transfer the raised funds to the SMEs. After each transaction is completed 
by SMEs, the information is transferred to the blockchain to realize the bookkeeping by 
core enterprises, financial institutions, and SMEs, ensuring the timeliness of the infor-
mation.

3.2. The Revenues Model of Supply Chain Members
1. The total amount of information shared throughout the supply-chain finance is a
dynamic process that changes over time. The change in the amount of shared information is
mainly determined by the number of participants in the supply-chain information sharing
at the time t. Therefore, the change in the total amount of shared information can be
expressed by the differential equation below:
.
x(t) = αeR + βeS + γeF − ρx(t) (1)
where x0 is the initial amount of shared information.
2. Traditional supply-chain finance
Sustainability 2022, 14, 7139 5 of 21
In addition to the basic income, each member of the traditional supply-chain finance
system also needs to pay high credit-investigation fees. Therefore, the income function of
enterprise participants in supply chain finance can be expressed as:
Suppliers:
πR = A + ηRx(t)− 1
2 dRe2
R(t) (2)
Distributors:
πS = B + ηSx(t)− 1
2 dSe2
S(t) (3)
Financing institutions:
πF = C + ηFx(t)− 1
2 dFe2
F(t) (4)
3. The application of blockchain technology in supply-chain finance is to realize the
efficiency and transparency of supply chain finance by uploading information to the block
by users and using the distributed characteristics of blockchain. Under the premise of
ensuring information security, increasing the amount of information sharing can guarantee
the efficient operation of the supply chain and maximize the benefits of the whole supply
chain. In addition, the high cost of information sharing is considered. Therefore, the
revenues function of enterprise participants in supply chain finance can be expressed as:
Suppliers:
πR = A + ηRx(t)− 1
2 kRe2
R(t) (5)
Distributors:
πS = B + ηSx(t)− 1
2 kSe2
S(t) (6)
Financing institutions:
πF = C + ηFx(t)− 1
2 kFe2

3.3. Different Decision-Making Situations of Traditional Supply-Chain Finance Members
3.3.1. Independent Decision-Making of Supply-Chain Finance Members
When each participant in supply-chain finance makes independent decisions, suppli-
ers, distributors, and financial institutions will decide to share information to maximize
their interests. The equilibrium decision combination obtained after the three-party game
is the static feedback Nash equilibrium.
The objective functions of suppliers, distributors, and financial institutions are:

Theorem 1. When the three-party enterprises in the supply chain are in a non-cooperative state,
the information shared by each party are e∗R1, e∗S1, e∗F1, the Nash equilibrium revenues function of all
parties are V∗R1, V∗S1, V∗F1 and the overall revenues V∗1 are as follows:

Proof. Based on the optimal control theory, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations
satisfied by suppliers, distributors, and financial institutions are as follows:
δVR = max
{
A + ηRx(t)− 1
2 dRe2
R(t) + V′R(αeR(t) + βeS(t) + γeF(t)− ρx(t))
}
δVS = max

{
C + ηFx(t)− 1
2 dFe2
F(t) + V′F(αeR(t) + βeS(t) + γeF(t)− ρx(t))
} (10)
The maximum values for suppliers, distributors, and financial institutions are obtained.
Afterward, setting the partial derivative of the right end of the HJB equation to, the
following equation can be obtained:
(eR, eS, eF) =

When it is substituted into the HJB equation, the following equation can be obtained

when the above equations are substituted into eR, eS, eF and optimal linear functions
VR, VS, VF, the following equation can be obtained:

3.3.2. Stackelberg Game Under Financial Institutions and Distributors Information Sharing
Cost Subsidies
In the supply chain system, SMEs (suppliers) should be encouraged to actively par-
ticipate in information sharing. Core enterprises (distributors) and financial institutions
should provide incentives for SMEs, thus enhancing the probability of information sharing
to reduce the probability of default. In this study, this incentive mechanism is formulated as
an information-sharing cost subsidy from strong enterprises (core enterprises and financial
institutions) to weak enterprises (SMEs). In this case, financial institutions play a leading
role by providing financing and subsidies. Financial institutions first decide the amount of
information sharing and subsidy coefficient θ1, and core enterprises decide the amount of
information sharing and subsidy coefficient θ2(θ1 + θ2 < 1) based on the decisions made
by financial institutions. Finally, SMEs make decisions based on the decisions of financial
institutions and core enterprises, thus maximizing their interests. The equilibrium decision
combination obtained by the three parties after the game is a dynamic feedback Stackelberg
equilibrium.
The objective function of suppliers, distributors, and financial institutions is:

Firstly, the information sharing quality of SMEs (suppliers) is solved by retroduc-

partial derivative of the right end of the HJB equation is set to 0, the following equation
can be obtained:

of maintaining the blockchain platform replaces the cost of information sharing among
supply-chain participants. Therefore, the following theorems and corollaries are obtained
according to the differences of the three game scenarios.

3.5. Comparison
Corollary 7. e∗R < e∗∗R , e∗S < e∗∗S , e∗F < e∗∗F , x∗1(t) < x∗∗1 (t), x∗2(t) < x∗∗2 (t), x∗3(t) < x∗∗3 (t).
The above inference shows that when blockchain technology is integrated into the
traditional supply-chain financial system, the amount of information provided by all parties
in the supply chain will increase significantly as the cost of blockchain maintenance is much
lower than that of information sharing.
Corollary 8. e∗R1 < e∗R3, e∗S1 = e∗S2 < e∗S2, e∗F1 = e∗F2 < e∗F2, When ηR
2 < ηF < ηR + ηS,
e∗R1 < e∗R2 < e∗R2.
Corollary 8 shows that when the supply chain system collaborates, the amount of
information sharing by suppliers, distributors, and financial institutions is higher than
that in the case of independent decision-making and the Stackelberg game with the sub-
sidy mechanism of distributors and financial institutions. In the case that distributors
and financial institutions subsidize suppliers’ information-sharing costs, the amount of
information sharing between distributors and financial institutions is the same as that in the
case of independent decision-making. However, when ηR < 2ηF, i.e., when the revenues to
suppliers per unit of information shared by blockchain are less than twice that to financial
institutions, the supplier’s amount of information sharing in the case that distributors
and financial institutions subsidize suppliers’ information sharing costs is higher than
that under independent decision-making. When ηF > ηR + ηS, i.e., when the revenues of
blockchain sharing per unit of information to financial institutions are greater than the sum
of those to suppliers and distributors, the amount of information shared by suppliers in the
case that distributors and financial institutions subsidize suppliers’ information sharing
costs is higher than that under supply-chain cooperation, which is often not the case.
Corollary 9. V∗1 < V∗3 and V∗2 < V∗3 . When ηR < 4ηSηF
ηR+2ηS−2ηF
, V∗1 < V∗2 .
Corollary 9 indicates that when the supply-chain system operates cooperatively, the
overall benefit of the system could be maximized if the collaboration among supply chain
participants is optimal. When ηR < 4ηSηF
ηR+2ηS−2ηF
, each unit of information on blockchain
brings small benefits to suppliers. To encourage information sharing by the suppliers,
financial institutions and distributors will subsidize the cost. The overall revenues of the
system under the subsidy mechanism are greater than those under independent decision-
making. Therefore, from the perspective of information sharing, the cooperation of the
three parties in the supply chain system is the Pareto optimality, the financial institutions
and distributors subsidizing the cost of supplier’s information sharing is the secondary
Pareto optimality, and the efficiency of independent decision-making in the supply chain
system is the lowest.
Corollary 10. In the Stackelberg game with the subsidy mechanism of distributors and financial
institutions, when 2ηRηS
ηR+2ηS
< ηR < ηF, V∗R1 < V∗R2.
Corollary 10 suggests that when the revenue to financial institutions per unit of
information shared by blockchain is greater than that to suppliers, the overall revenue of the
suppliers under the subsidy mechanism increases compared with that under independent
decision-making. When ηF > 2ηRηS
ηR+2ηS
, V∗S1 < V∗S2. The large subsidy coefficient θ1 in
the two cases above indicates that financial institutions receieving high income from
information sharing tend to relieve suppliers of the information sharing costs and reduce
the subsidy pressure from distributors to suppliers. Thus, suppliers and distributors can
obtain higher income under the subsidy mechanism. When ηS > 2ηR,V∗F1 < V∗F2, i.e., when
each unit of information shared by blockchain brings twice the revenues to distributors as
Sustainability 2022, 14, 7139 13 of 21
it does to suppliers, the revenues of financial institutions under the subsidy mechanism
increase compared with that under independent decision-making. The higher subsidy
coefficient of distributors to suppliers θ2 suggests that distributors receiving high revenues
from information sharing tend to ease suppliers’ pressure of information sharing costs
and reduce the subsidy pressure from financial institutions to suppliers. Thus, financial
institutions can receive higher revenues under the subsidy mechanism.
To sum up, whether from the perspective of information-sharing amount or economic
interests, supply-chain system collaboration pushes the overall revenue to Pareto equilib-
rium and prevents the risk of some enterprises becoming “free riders”. In the meantime,
sharing the whole information cost of the supply-chain system can improve the amount of
information sharing and maximize the revenues of the system.
4. Numerical Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis
A numerical analysis of the above optimal decision was performed in Python. Given
the few blockchain-based supply-chain financial institutions at present, only the “One
Enterprise Chain” platform of Ping An Bank was studied, considering the operation
mechanism of supply-chain finance, the characteristics of model variables, and the actual
situations. To rationalize the fitting image, the benchmark parameter is set as follows: A =

Finally, the following numerical analysis results were obtained.

supply chain finance system, the amount of information provided by the supply chain 
increases significantly as the blockchain maintenance cost is far lower than that of infor-

information sharing in the system tends to stabilize. As the information discount rate in-
creases, the amount of information sharing decreases gradually. When the information 
discount rate gradually approaches 1, the amount of information sharing also approaches 
0. Therefore, the higher information discount rate discourages the parties of the supply 
chain from sharing information, while the lower information discount rate encourages 
them to share information and improve their revenues.

5. Conclusions
Based on the dynamic changes in the amount of information sharing over time, this
study considered the independent decisions in the supply-chain system, the cost subsidy
of information sharing by financial institutions and distributors to suppliers, and the
cooperative supply-chain system. A differential game model was established to obtain the
feedback Nash equilibrium solution. The findings showed that the amount of information
sharing in blockchain-based supply chain finance was much higher than that of traditional
supply chain finance. When the per-unit-information benefits brought by blockchain to
the suppliers were small, the information sharing cost-subsidy mechanism can achieve
Sustainability 2022, 14, 7139 19 of 21
Pareto improvement of information sharing degree and economy. However, the supply-
chain system cooperation was optimal both in information sharing degree and overall
economic revenues. Information discount rate had a certain impact on information sharing
degree and the overall revenue of the supply-chain system, indicating the importance of
information-sharing efficiency. The increase in the discount rate also decreased the present
overall revenue of the supply-chain system, indicating that the model conformed to the
economic patterns. Based on the game analysis of information sharing behaviors of all
parties in the supply chain system, this study effectively evaluated the practicability of
blockchain to solve the supply-chain financial information-sharing problem and described
the influence of information-sharing degree on the revenues of the supply chain system
and all the parties. Too little information sharing led to information asymmetry among all
parties in the supply chain and affected their revenues. Excessive information sharing did
not increase the revenues of all parties in the supply chain but led to the risk of confidential
information theft. In the meantime, the information shared within the supply-chain system
and the revenues of all parties tended to stabilize as the cooperation time increased, which
was consistent with the long-term economic stability of the market.
Due to space limitations and simplified calculation, the model in this paper was not
ideal as it simply divided the whole supply chain system into suppliers, distributors, and
financial institutions. Some descriptions of the complex supply chain system may have
deviated. In the meantime, although the actual situation was considered in the numerical
analysis data, some deviations remained. Changes in the amount of information sharing
within the supply chain system not only related to time, the amount of information sharing
among all parties, and the information discount rate but also deviated in the discussion of
information sharing behavior of all parties. Therefore, the game model for the amount of
information shared among all parties in the supply chain system still needs further study.
