Strict food regulations, high-quality product demand, and fierce market competition
urge food enterprises to focus on the optimization strategy of product safety and
traceability recall in the food chain. To better meet customers' safety and quality
expectations and reduce the loss of problematic products that fail to be recalled in
time, the paper establishes a two-level food supply chain consisting of a single manu-
facturer and supplier, uses the Stackelberg game to explore the interaction between
traceability recall and product safety optimization in the food chain, and finds the
best food safety investment and product traceability recall strategy. And we consider
the case of the former investing in the latter's product safety efforts. The results
show that the food safety premium sharing rate determines the optimal decision of
manufacturers and suppliers when each member is faced with the difference
between the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit and the traceable recall cost coeffi-
cient. In addition, the higher safety investment cost factor increases the burden on
the entire supply chain and reduces the safety benefits of the food chain. Moreover,
higher security investment cost factors increase the burden on the entire supply
chain and reduce the safety benefits of the food chain. Interestingly, suppliers can
take advantage of the increased cost per unit of unrecalled products to obtain higher
safety investments when manufacturers implement recall measures for problematic
foods. We also introduced blockchain technology and discovered Pareto optima for
food safety. When the supplier bears part of the problem of food loss, food safety,
quality, and investment are high. The conclusions show that product traceability
recall is beneficial to the overall welfare of the food chain.
1 | INTRODUCTION
China's economic development has brought new challenges in food
safety and quality to companies and policymakers. The scale and com-
plexity of supply and production chains are growing, and rising con-
sumer incomes mean that consumer demand is upgrading and
diversifying. At the same time, social media has also increased the
public's attention to food safety issues. However, food safety inci-
dents continue to occur, causing public anxiety. According to statistics
from the World Health Organization, more than 400,000 people die
from contaminated objects each year, and about 10% of the popula-
tion suffers from diseases due to food safety issues (Xu et al., 2022).
On the other hand, various food scandals exposed by the media, such
as the milk incident in China, the Listeria contaminated cantaloupe in
the United States, the outbreak of Escherichia coli in Germany, and the
“food theft” scandal in India, have greatly endangered the health of
the general population. Enhance consumers' confidence in food safety
and quality. Most of these incidents are caused by human factors,
such as insufficient training, lack of technical knowledge and standard
knowledge, or fraud and violations for financial gain. The challenge for
corporate executives and regulators comes from the highly fragmen-
ted nature of the food industry-small pastures; farms and companies
occupy the main part of China's food production, processing, whole-
sale, and trade (Niu et al., 2016).

As Chinese consumers pay more attention to their health, they
are paying attention to the ingredients and sources of the food they
buy. More consumers are loyal to brands they trust and willing to pay
more for safer, better food. The government is aware of the impor-
tance of integrity in the food industry. The new national food safety
regulations will impose new food safety regulations on manufacturers,
distributors, retailers, and even online stores. The law will increase
fines for violations and require a food traceability system.
Consumers and national attention to green health food and the
food market of iteration constantly improve food safety in the form of
began to separate from traditional food supply chain members, driven
by now in the food market competition, many members of the food
chain choose vertical coordination patterns, such as production con-
tract and agriculture. This is because upstream farmers or suppliers
tend to be smaller, with less efficient production and management
technologies and less developed infrastructure such as transport, cold
storage, and information channels (Wang et al., 2014). By signing con-
tracts with stronger downstream processors or producers, suppliers
gain access to better technology and inputs from larger companies,
improving their productivity and product quality. For example, poultry
growers in India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh receive feed and veteri-
nary assistance provided by downstream procurement companies,
and Indian dairy growers can obtain high-quality raw materials, seeds,
equipment, and chemicals provided by large downstream manufac-
turers under technical standards imposed by them (Dai et al., 2017).
The latter also provided technical training and other consulting ser-
vices as part of the contract (Niu et al., 2016). Therefore, signing con-
tracts with large processors or manufacturers is one of the ways to
enter the high-end market and obtain higher returns to improve their
welfare (Bellemare, 2012). In addition, contracts provide a stable and
consistent supply for downstream food processors and consumers,
giving processors more control and food traceability and reducing
losses from problematic food. The purchase contract enables the
party with advanced economic strength or technology to actively pro-
vide safety investment support for the party with weak conditions
and resources, while also being able to obtain products with a higher
degree of safety, and to obtain product premiums paid by consumers
who prefer food safety.
From a practical point of view, the supply chain of the food indus-
try is relatively complex. The sources of food safety risks at the pro-
duction end include smallholder operations, lack of agricultural
technical knowledge, contaminated soil and water, and excessive pes-
ticide use and residues. In addition, food recalls are caused by a lack
of safety and quality assurance during production and processing by
one or more supply chain partners and may affect a large number of
long-manufactured products (Chao et al., 2009). In a recent Ford
report, 76% of a company's quality problems came from its tier-one
supplier (Sun & Wang, 2019). Therefore, food safety incidents and
product recall caused by products with low safety and quality will
cause unnecessary costs, sales decline, reputation loss, and litigation
disputes for enterprises (Dai et al., 2017; Thirumalai & Sinha, 2011).
At the same time, the cost and scale of problematic food recalls
require a deeper understanding of how to manage safety
improvement incentives for supply chain partners to ensure higher
food health. Therefore, downstream enterprises will sign purchase
contracts with upstream suppliers whose own economic, technical,
and management problems make it difficult to improve the safety of
food raw materials. The latter will receive subsidies for food safety
investment from the former to obtain higher quality food and con-
sumer product premium. However, the impact of the sharing of safety
premiums on the decision-making of the upstream and downstream
sides of the food supply chain and how to obtain the optimal supply
chain benefits and social benefits are also the focus of this paper,
which has great practical significance.
For manufacturers, in addition to continuously improving the
safety of upstream products in food production, they also need to
invest in food traceability throughout the supply chain to reduce the
loss of goodwill and policy penalties caused by problematic products
on the market. Although it is the optimal strategy to sell safer foods to
customers in a food supply chain (FSC) with a high level of traceability,
considering the improvement and improvement of product safety and
supply chain traceability level, both of them pose great challenges to
enterprises' economic investment ability and scientific and technologi-
cal support and breakthrough. Therefore, in real life, it is difficult to
have both. Manufacturers need to rationally allocate resources for
food safety investment and supply chain traceability under the con-
straints of their resource limits and investment capacity and strategi-
cally formulate the optimal strategy between high-quality food
premiums and low recall product losses. Especially when the market
environment and its conditions change, how food manufacturers will
choose between the benefits of the two has very important research
significance and management innovation.
From a theoretical perspective, most of the current literature
related to food quality management and traceability focuses on prod-
uct quality testing and management (Yao & Zhu, 2020), production
efforts (Bondareva & Pinker, 2019), and quality improvement (Zhu
et al., 2007) and traceability tracking and product recall cost-sharing
(Dai et al., 2021). Further discussed in this article, from the perspec-
tive of the vertical coordination of the food supply chain, the coopera-
tion model is formed by considering the mutual capacity limitations
between the upstream and the downstream; the latter invests in the
safety of the former to help the latter improve the safety and quality
of food. The innovations of this article have not yet been studied in
most of the literature. At the same time, we inherited the traditional
literature on traceability recall in the food supply chain. From the per-
spective of safety investment, how to coordinate the distribution of
traceability and food safety in the supply chain is also an interesting
topic. Finally, the optimal decision scheme of each member of the
food chain is analyzed from multiple perspectives, which provides
some reference significance for the risk management and quality man-
agement of the food supply chain in the future.
In this paper, the supplier's safety improvement work is affected
by moral hazard and does not participate in the financial burden of
the loss of recall of problematic food. The leading manufacturer of the
entire supply chain shall be responsible for the loss of food recall and
non-recall caused by food safety events caused by food safety and

quality. Considering the food supply chain structure of a single
supplier and a single manufacturer, and based on the premium sharing
ratio of the purchase contract, we propose the following research
questions for the best effort decision made by the two in the food
supply chain:
1. How can food producers balance the relationship between safety
investment and traceability recall to achieve the optimal food
safety strategy when there is resource upper limit constraint.
2. What degree of safety efforts will upstream suppliers make
between the share ratio of product safety premium agreed in the
procurement contract and the manufacturer's safety investment?
3. When the loss cost of unrecalled food varies with the policy and
market environment, has the entire food supply chain's approach
to improving product safety changed? Is it more inclined to trace
or improve food quality?
4. In the face of the current problems facing the food chain, how can
companies and governments deal with them to more effectively
improve the status quo of the food supply chain and welcome a
healthy future?
In the next section, we will introduce the innovations and contri-
butions of this article in the context of existing supply chain literature
on quality management and risk management. We then introduced
the basic modeling framework and assumptions of our model in
Section 3. Section 4 analyzes the safety investment and traceable
recall strategy that this article focuses on in detail. We presented an
extensive numerical study in Section 5, which examined the equilib-
rium thresholds for the efforts and benefits of manufacturers and sup-
pliers. Section 6 extends the sharing of recall costs. And Section 7
outlines our findings and future research directions.
2 | LITERATURE REVIEW
Aiming at the interaction between traceability in food supply chain
quality management and product safety investment optimization, our
paper involves the following three research directions: (i) food supply
chain, (ii) traceability or recall capability, and (iii) supply chain coordi-
nation management.
2.1 | Food supply chain
Food safety is a pervasive issue that challenges regulatory agencies,
the food industry, and consumers around the world. Managing food
safety risks is particularly difficult because of the size, complexity, and
opacity of the food supply chain. Food safety incidents happen every
day around the world. Therefore, a large number of scholars put for-
ward their own opinions on the product quality and safety of food
safety incidents. Levi et al. (2020) analyzed how quality uncertainty,
supply chain dispersion, and detection sensitivity jointly affect the
activity of speculation in the production of low-quality food on farms
and developed a model framework to examine its risk to reduce the
possibility of foodborne diseases. Through the food safety risk test of
aquatic products, Jin et al. (2021) evaluated the distribution of regula-
tory resources in the food supply chain to achieve the goal of manag-
ing food safety and adulteration risks. On the other hand, due to the
double moral hazard problem of food safety often occurs, Mu et al.
(2016) use the competitive power between milk stations to solve the
deliberate adulteration and free-riding behavior of dairy farmers and
convert the harmful effects (quality reduction) caused by competition
into beneficial effects (quality improvement). Considering the linear
market demand, Liu et al. (2012) showed that both manufacturers and
suppliers could improve product quality through efforts and proved
the existence of Nash optimal equilibrium solution of the decentra-
lized supply chain by using the upper mode game theory. Zhu et al.
(2007) also believes that when different members of the supply chain
invest in improving quality, the revenue of the entire supply chain will
be most affected. In addition, Cao et al. (2020) coordinated the opti-
mal green agricultural product effort decisions jointly determined by
cooperatives and enterprises through cost-sharing contracts and buy-
back contracts. Therefore, internal integration and supplier integration
of the agricultural supply chain becomes the key to improving product
quality (Wang et al., 2021).
The above literature explored the sources and improvement
approaches to food quality problems from different perspectives such
as detection and supervision and sought the optimal quality balance
solution from the perspective of the overall benefits of the supply
chain. Our work has supplemented the relevant literature on the food
supply chain from two aspects. First, based on the food safety issues
mentioned above and the cooperative relationship among the mem-
bers of the supply chain, a model has been proposed in which one
party can improve the safety and quality of products in the food chain,
while the other party has the willingness to invest in the safety of the
former. This is a very interesting and novel exploration, and it is also
different from the research mentioned above that both sides have the
same way to improve quality. Then, we combine the traceability recall
with the safest investment of the food supply chain to explore the
optimal balance between the two, which also has great practical and
research significance.
2.2 | Traceable recall supply chain
The agri-food regulations provide traceability throughout the supply
chain to ensure consumer safety and product quality. This has
prompted producers and retailers to consider opportunities to
improve company reputation and consumer confidence by implement-
ing traceability systems that are not only designed to meet legal
requirements but also track product quality by optimizing the supply
chain. Aiello et al. (2015) evaluate and summarize traceability and
implementation methods of food supply chain and processing stage
based on recall effect, traceable resource unit, and comprehensive
granularity. By conducting regression analysis and testing of model
construction on the Italian fishery supply chain, Asioli et al. (2014)

explored the relationship between traceability level and expected and
actual traceability costs and benefits. Sun and Wang (2019) use a joint
contract approach to address information asymmetry in purchasing
decisions in the food supply chain, enabling buyers to obtain a higher
level of traceability from suppliers. Moreover, traceability elements
used in products can also improve the trust index of consumers
(Matzembacher et al., 2018). In addition, traceability is a tracking
capability used to identify the source of many quality problems. It is a
powerful solution to food safety issues (Sun & Wang, 2019); improv-
ing the traceability of the food supply chain to deal with potential
food security incidents is very important. Product recalls, for example,
have become an important feature of the supply chain. Based on the
accuracy of pollution source identification in the traceable supply
chain, Piramuthu et al. (2013) identified the appropriate level of visi-
bility and recall strategy, taking into account the allocation of respon-
sibilities between the different players in the perishable goods supply
network. Thirumalai and Sinha (2011) evaluated the financial conse-
quences of product scope, sales, growth prospects and capital struc-
ture of enterprises from recalls related to medical devices and
persistent quality problems, and explored and found by analyzing the
sources of device recalls that the more comprehensive the product
portfolio focused on R&D and development, the more likely the com-
pany is to recall devices. Blockchain technology is an emerging tech-
nology developed in recent years, with a powerful information
traceability function. This technology plays an important role in moni-
toring product quality and dealing with product safety issues. Fan,
Wu, et al. (2020) explored the adoption of blockchain traceability in
the supply chain, based on consumers' awareness of traceability and
the technical cost of using blockchain. Hastig and Sodhi (2020) said
that traceability systems under blockchain can deter illegal activities,
improve sustainability performance and operational efficiency, and
enhance supply chain coordination.
However, compared with the existing retrospective literature,
our work has a different purpose: As traceability becomes a key ele-
ment in supply chain management, we are interested especially in
safety-sensitive sectors such as food and pharmaceuticals, and con-
sumers also place high expectations on the safety of the food supply
chain (FSC) (Casino et al., 2020). Exploring the interaction between
traceability and product safety investment optimization in the food
supply chain is of great practical significance, and we further analyze
the optimal balanced recall strategy and safety efforts of each mem-
ber of the food chain from the perspective of a collaborative supply
chain.
2.3 | Supply chain coordination management
In supply chain relationships, collaborative arrangements become an
important way for various internal and external stakeholders to
improve organizationally and supply chain performance and to
improve the sustainability of the food supply chain (Krishnan
et al., 2021). Through the acceptance sampling test model under the
condition of uncertain product quality, Chen et al. (2014) proved that
a decentralized supply chain structure may lead to distortion of prod-
uct quality and that different pricing and regulatory options under ver-
tical control can affect product quality and distribution of total profit
of supply chain. When contract farming agreements become an
important driving force, it is an important driving force to improve
farmers' production efforts (such as purchasing agricultural machinery
or using new farming techniques). Niu et al. (2016) examined how dif-
ferent types of cooperation affect the effort and utility coordination
of channel members and enable farmers to achieve systematic optimal
production efforts. Ma et al. (2021) studies the design of price coordi-
nation mechanism of automobile manufacturers under the condition
of government intervention and finds that appropriate government
intervention can maximize social welfare. In addition, Zhu et al. (2007)
believe that the fact that manufacturers and suppliers share warranty
costs when selling substandard products is conducive to encouraging
both sides to invest in product quality improvement. In the face of
product recall events with quality problems, Zhang et al. (2020) found
that quality management cooperation and supplier qualification were
positively correlated with product recall ability by combining case
study and quantitative investigation. Dai et al. (2020) indicate that
both suppliers and manufacturers can reduce the probability of recall
events through recall efforts, and the degree of both parties' efforts is
related to the initial expected unit recall cost and the potential market
size. Fan, Ni, et al. (2020) reveals the impact of product liability cost
allocation and channel leadership structure on the quality decisions of
supply chain members and the corresponding profitability of each
member and the entire supply chain. Lee et al. (2013), however, fully
harmonized the supply chain through quality compensation contracts,
which compensate manufacturers for faulty products that retailers
inadvertently sold to consumers. Bhaskaran and Krishnan (2009) stud-
ied the subtle interaction between the cost investment and effort
sharing mechanism of two different enterprises jointly developing
new products the degree of revenue sharing and the type of projects
between companies. Ziggers and Trienekens (1999) believe that the
specific market and production characteristics of the food supply
chain are the motivation for vertical coordination to obtain competi-
tive advantages. The quality assurance system can only play a promot-
ing role, and its actual competitiveness will depend on the ability to
develop successful partnerships. Xie et al. (2020) study the coordina-
tion of two-level supply chain. The results show that the buyback con-
tract is sufficient to coordinate the supply chain when the seller has
high bargaining power and can control uncertain returns. Ma and Sun
(2018) study nonlinear mixed oligopolies game based on Production
Cooperation. The results show that system uncertainty will affect the
profit of cooperation. Bao et al. (2020) studied the game behavior of
duopoly automakers producing pure electric vehicles and fuel vehi-
cles. Considering consumers' low-carbon preferences and government
subsidy schemes, the optimal decisions under three game strategies
of supply chain coordination, namely, non-cooperative game, coopera-
tive game, and cost sharing contract, are compared and analyzed. The
study found that the price of electric vehicles is more dependent on
reducing carbon emissions and government subsidies than electric
vehicles.

A two-level supply chain in which upstream manufacturer and
downstream retailer share product liability costs caused by quality
defects is studied. Study found that when product liability cost share
by the retailer to the manufacturer, when the manufacturer is in the
lead, manufacturers can not improve the quality of products, with
higher wholesale prices will increase the cost of product liability all
transferred to the retailer, but when the manufacturer is in the lead,
retailers will reduce the retail margin to encourage manufacturers to
improve product quality (Fan, Ni, et al., 2020).
Fan, Wu, et al. (2020) study the three-level supply chain
composed of suppliers, manufacturers and retailers, and studied the
optimal pricing strategy of the supply chain in two cases considering
consumers' traceability awareness. The results show that there are
conditions for the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply
chain, which are related to the traceability awareness of consumers,
the production costs of suppliers and manufacturers, and the costs of
using blockchain technology.
However, when the upstream and downstream members of the
food supply chain cooperate, one party accepts the safety investment
of the other party to improve product safety and quality and shares
the benefits of safety premium, while the latter not only gains profits
but also reduces the liability cost of defective products. This is some-
thing the aforementioned competitive food recall efforts and produc-
tion efforts did not involve in the supply chain. And how traceability
in the food chain is affected by cooperation between upstream and
downstream has not received much attention so far. We also consider
the impact of non-recall liability cost and safety premium sharing ratio
on safety efforts and recall strategies throughout the food supply
chain.
Zhao et al. (2021) study the impact of agricultural supply chain
integration on agricultural product quality and financial performance.
The results show that internal integration and supplier integration are
the key factors to improve product quality in agricultural supply chain.
In addition, product quality plays a completely mediating role between
internal integration and financial performance, and between supplier
integration and financial performance.
Throughout the existing literature, existing articles discuss the
impact of traceability technology investment on upstream and down-
stream enterprises in the food supply chain system. Traceability tech-
nology can help improve the safety of food raw materials, meet
consumers' demand for safe food, and reduce the negative impact of
food safety uncertainty on food manufacturers in the food supply
chain, however, investment in traceability technology may lead to
conflict of interest between suppliers and manufacturers in the supply
chain; how to coordinate the conflicts between the two is an essential
problem. Reasonable distribution of the costs and benefits brought by
traceability technology is also the top priority to ensure the maximum
benefits of traceability technology. Therefore, this paper innovatively
discusses the impact of traceability technology investment on
upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain and con-
siders the two coordination mechanisms of cost sharing and revenue
sharing are established to promote the win-win situation of the supply
chain system. At the same time, this paper also innovatively considers
the impact of blockchain technology on the backtracking of agricul-
tural supply chain.
3 | MODEL
3.1 | Model description
We have constructed a two-level food sales supply chain composed
of a single supplier and a single manufacturer. Under the purchase
contract signed between the two, the leading producer will purchase
all the food raw materials of q output provided by the upstream food
supplier, produce and process them into food, and sell them to
retailers or consumers in the market. Here, we collectively refer to
them as buyers. As consumers pay more and more attention to food
safety, buyers tend to have a higher preference for the safety and
traceability of the food they buy. In reality, many large manufacturers
or retailers take the initiative to provide food safety investment assis-
tance to partners with weak resources to better meet consumers'
food safety needs and improve the market share of their products. On
the other hand, to prevent the production of inferior food and the sale
of contaminated food, manufacturers choose to establish a food
traceability recall system between the upstream and downstream of
the supply chain, timely detection of problems, and the maximum
number of recalls of problematic food. Under the safety investment of
the manufacturer, the upstream suppliers make e safety efforts of the
purchased food raw materials to reduce the probability of safety inci-
dents in the food supply chain and improve the safety utility of con-
sumers for food to obtain higher income. Therefore, according to Liu
et al. (2018), we establish inverse demand function p¼A�qþαe,
where A represents the current market size of food sales, q represents
the food output sold, αe represents the product premium paid by con-
sumers to the food safety efforts made by suppliers, and α represents
the perceived strength of consumers to food safety efforts. Based on
the existing reality, this paper focuses on how manufacturers invest in
suppliers to improve the safety level of the food supply chain and
improve the traceability ability to reduce the cost of loss caused by
problematic products. Therefore, similar to Chao et al. (2009), this
paper assumes that regardless of inventory and out-of-stock costs,
the food output q provided by upstream suppliers is fixed, and the
food price sold in the market can be simplified as p¼ p0þαe, where
p0 ¼A�q.
Figure 1 displays the structure of the secondary food supply chain
with a single supplier and single producer, the manufacturer's decision
variable is the optimal level of traceability for constructing the food
supply chain and the optimal level of investment in upstream sup-
pliers' safety efforts, and the supplier's decision variable is the optimal
level of food safety efforts based on the safety investment provided
by the manufacturer.
Figure 2 shows the event sequence, the cooperative parties first
sign a food purchase contract through negotiation, and the manufac-
turer purchases all the food with fixed output q from the supplier and
produces the food at the wholesale price w0þ 1�θð Þαe throughout

the whole cycle, where w0 represents the wholesale purchase price
agreed by both parties without the support of safety investment by
the manufacturer and 1�θð Þ is the share of premium income paid by
the consumer for food safety that the supplier can obtain when safety
effort is e. A higher value of θ indicates that the consumer premium
earned by safety efforts in the food supply chain is owned by the
manufacturer in a higher proportion. Afterward, according to their
interests, both parties will make expensive efforts to improve the food
safety level and traceability level to reduce the losses caused by food
safety incidents. After the manufacturer determines the upstream
food safety investments and the traceability recall level t of the whole
food supply chain, the supplier decides the safety effort level e of the
raw material products based on the safety investment intensity of the
manufacturer. Similar to Chao et al. (2009), the measurement of effort
in modeling research assumes that it conforms to the quantitative
expression of the interval [0, 1].
Below, we introduce the basic structure of our model:
Hypothesis H1. We assume that the food raw mate-
rials produced by q are provided by the supplier to the
manufacturer for production and processing. When
food safety incidents such as food problems or food
contamination, the latter will recall the food in time and
bear the responsibility for losses caused by the recall
and the defective products.
Hypothesis H2. We will only consider the cost of loss
caused by each unit of food that cannot be recalled and
ignore the cost of food recalls that can be implemented
by recall measures, such as transportation and inventory
costs. This is mainly due to the unique attributes of the
food supply chain. Compared with the defective food
that can be recalled, the unrecalled part will cause more
serious damage to the goodwill of the enterprise, the
reduction of product market share, and the punishment
of food health-related policies (Dai et al., 2021).
In the food supply chain, there are often loopholes and uncer-
tainties in the detection system of natural factors, food contamina-
tion, quality and safety problems, and recall events. According to the
traceability recall level t� 0, 1ð Þ, the quantity range of recalled prod-
ucts in food safety incidents is modeled as a function of the traceabil-
ity recall level of the food supply chain. According to Dai et al. (2021),
define f tð Þ as the scale of problematic products that can be recalled in
a food safety incident, f 0ð Þ¼1, f 1ð Þ¼0 and f 0 tð Þ<0, f 00 tð Þ<0. When
t=0, it means that the manufacturer has not performed food trace-
ability, which means that the manufacturer is responsible for any
goodwill or penalties caused by all possible bad foods in the market.
f0 tð Þ< 0 means that the higher traceability level leads to more recalls
of defective products and thus reduces further losses. This assump-
tion is reasonable and realistic. In f eð Þ¼1� 1� f eð Þð Þ, it is found that
e and 1� f eð Þ have a one-to-one enantiomer relationship. For simplifi-
cation, we assume that f eð Þ¼1�e and the above parameter design
has been referred to in the literature.
Based on the effort level e� 0, 1ð Þ of suppliers, the probability of
food safety events that may occur in the process of processing, pro-
duction, and sales of the supply chain is modeled as a function of food
safety effort level by referring to Chao et al. (2009). Manufacturers
can reduce the probability of recall events by reducing the initial value
of 1�e�λ to 1�e�λ 1�eð Þ by investing in suppliers. Note that in

practice, λ is usually very small, and therefore, according to Taylor's
formula, 1�e�λ 1�eð Þ is approximately equal to λ 1�eð Þ. This paper
focuses on the decision-making of safety efforts. Because the value of
λ is robust, it is not involved in the analysis in the formula below. In
practice, when food safety causes serious consequences to con-
sumers, delaying the decision of recall will bring a high risk of safety
responsibility to the manufacturer, so we assume that the manufac-
turer immediately takes action to initiate a recall when a food safety
incident occurs.
3.2 | Parameter interpretation
Table 1 lists the parameters related to model establishment and the
meaning of symbols.
3.3 | Model building
In our model, the manufacturer and the supplier sign a purchase con-
tract at the agreed wholesale price and security premium sharing ratio.
Among them, the former provides sufficient incentives for the latter,
such as the investment support for suppliers on the safety level of
food raw materials and the sharing of premiums paid by consumers
due to the improvement of safety efforts at the end of the sale.
Therefore, suppliers have the motivation to improve food safety
efforts, while producers can obtain premium income from consumers
for high safety and quality food, reduce the probability of food safety
incidents, and reduce the compensation losses caused by problematic
foods. For this purpose, we respectively formulate the best-effort
strategy for the two in pursuit of maximizing returns.

In reality, the occurrence of food safety problems will lead to a
decrease in the performance of the whole supply chain, and the
profits of each member of the chain will be affected to varying
degrees due to food issues. Due to asymmetric information between
channels, low information transparency, imperfect traceability system,
and management problems, the responsibility of food events cannot
be fairly distributed, making the large producers or processing retailers
of production terminals bear all the losses of food events alone. As
mentioned above, TESCO's horsemeat scandal and retail giant Wal-
Mart bear all the losses of the contaminated product recall. This arti-
cle, the loss of product recall, waste treatment, customer after-sales
compensation, and the cost of food, recalls such as transportation and
inventory for recall measures in the process of sales are defined as
unit cost C1. However, the negative impact (like brand reputation,
consumer market share decline, and safety penalty) caused by the
unrecalled food is recorded as C2 and borne by the dominant manu-
facturer. Due to the unique attributes of the food supply chain, com-
pared with the food that can be recalled with problems, the
unrecalled products cause more serious damage to the goodwill of the
enterprise, the reduction of the market share, and the punishment of
the food health-related policy (Dai et al., 2021). Considering that this
paper mainly studies the equilibrium optimization of food safety effort
and traceability level, it is robust to ignore the small negative loss cost,
and the conclusion of this paper remains unchanged. To simplify the
model, we only consider the unrecalled and penalized loss cost, C2,
which has a large impact and a wide range of serious losses. There-
fore, the revenue function of the producer is updated as

such as considering the limited material, economic strength, and

sized that the cost of obtaining a high level of effort would be prohibi-

model negotiability and are widely used in economics and operations
research literature (Dai et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2014).
The solution sequence in this paper is as follows. We use reverse
induction to solve this problem. First, we solve the food supplier's
optimal safety effort decision, e, and obtain the supplier's response
function to the manufacturer's investment. Then, the manufacturer
makes a decision based on the supplier's response function and
decides its own optimal investment level s and optimal traceability
level t, to maximize its income. To simplify, let p0 ¼w0 ¼0. Stackel-
berg game is widely used in supply chain modeling (Ma et al., 2020;
Ma & Xu, 2022).
Among them, we get the Hessian matrix of the profit of the food
manufacturer under the food traceability recall level t and the invest-
ment s in the supplier s as follows:

4 | ANALYSIS
In this section, we attempt to propose an optimal product effort strat-
egy for safety effort and traceability levels in the food supply chain by
addressing the producer and retailer issues described in Section 3,
where s�, t�, and e� are, respectively, the optimal investment level,
product recall strategy, and safety effort strategy of food manufac-
turers and suppliers in pursuit of the maximization of their interests.
The complex formula in the formula is simplified. Note that
p�wð Þ� 1�eð Þ 1� tð ÞC >0, this can be interpreted to mean that the
manufacturer's marginal profit is non-negative, even if the manufac-
turer does not work hard to trace the product. The following theo-
rems illustrate game analysis of safety effort and traceability level
strategy in the food supply chain.

enthusiasm of manufacturers in food traceability recall level will
decrease with the increase of the share proportion of safety effort
premium; then, it will increase beyond a certain threshold.
Theorem 1 gives a closed-form expression of the optimal food
safety effort and recall strategy for both upstream and downstream
manufacturers and suppliers in the food supply chain for the problem
parameters and obtains the relevant threshold strategy. When the
technical cost coefficient of traceability level in the food supply chain
is large and higher than the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit, simi-
lar trends emerged in best safety efforts and product recall strategies
for both manufacturers and suppliers. In other words, as the propor-
tion of consumer premium brought about by safety improvement in
the procurement contracts of producers and suppliers in the food sup-
ply chain changes, the optimal safety strategies of both parties change
from positive (negative) correlation in the early stage to negative (pos-
itive) correlation in the later stage, presenting a convex (concave)
change form. To reduce the loss of food products purchased and pro-
duced from upstream suppliers when they are sold in the market, food
manufacturers will establish a product traceability system for the
whole food supply chain and try to recall all the problematic products
as soon as possible on the largest scale. If the cost coefficient of food
traceability level is large and higher than the loss caused by failure to
recall defective food in time, the profit-oriented manufacturers will be
less enthusiastic in food traceability and more inclined to improve
product safety.
After signing the purchase contract with the supplier, the manu-
facturer will determine the sharing proportion of consumer premium
after the improvement of food safety efforts. We can know that if the
large manufacturer has a strong voice in the whole food supply chain,
it requires a large proportion in revenue sharing. It will reduce the
enthusiasm of suppliers in improving the level of food safety so that
the food safety degree of the whole supply chain is not high, the
probability of selling problematic food is higher, and the safety pre-
mium of products will also be reduced. This has further prompted
manufacturers to reduce their investment in supplier safety and focus
on improving product traceability across the food chain. Conversely, if
the giant manufacturer can share the premium benefits of more food
safety efforts, the supplier's safety efforts will be more profitable, and
the motivation to improve its safety efforts will be stronger, which
will lead to higher food safety efforts. It has also encouraged
manufacturers to invest in upstream safety and to devote more
resources to improving supplier safety rather than the traceability
level of recalled food. Therefore, if the share ratio of food safety pre-
mium is too high, although it is conducive to the improvement of
traceability level, it reduces the enthusiasm of suppliers to improve
food safety and fails to improve the health and safety level of the
whole food industry.

When the unit loss cost of unrecalled food was higher than the
traceability cost coefficient of the supply chain, what makes us feel
interesting is that both sides showed opposite conclusions about the
optimal food safety decision and recall strategy. With the increase of
the premium proportion of food safety effort shared in the purchase
contract between manufacturer and supplier, we have observed that
upstream suppliers in the food supply chain are less motivated to pay
for product safety efforts. This is because when suppliers get only a
fraction of the premium paid by consumers for their food safety
efforts, there is no strong will to improve the safety level of their
products even if they get the safety investment from downstream
producers. It is counter-intuitive that food producers' investment in
the safety of their upstream suppliers always increases as the propor-
tion of the consumer premium for safety improvements increases. We
can understand that when the sharing ratio of safety premium is low,
even if suppliers are not enthusiastic about improving food safety,
producers will try their best to improve the food chain in terms of
safety investment and food traceability when they are faced with
higher cost unrecalled food losses. As producer investment increases
gradually and the safety of the upstream exceeds a certain threshold,
even when the safety premium sharing ratio is high, the supplier can
more efficiently improve food safety and obtain benefits with the help
of the downstream, and manufacturers will also reduce the

improvement of traceability and further increase their security invest-
ment in suppliers.
Consumers and governments of all countries attach great impor-
tance to food safety in the market; there will be a more strict policy of
food safety, food and health problems of merchants have severe pun-
ishment measures, and problems existed in food businesses for its
reputation on the market, stock price, and product sales caused
extremely serious blow (Hastig & Sodhi, 2020). This has led large
downstream manufacturers to both improve their traceability and
cooperate with suppliers with higher product safety and quality. And
when they find high-quality suppliers, they will invest in food safety
upstream as much as possible to improve product safety. Suppliers
need to accept a higher share of the security premium too.

When the traceability cost coefficient of food supply chain is
higher than the loss of unrecalled products, it can be found that
the share premium ratio θ of both producers and retailers with
safety efforts meets a certain threshold, within which the benefits
of both increase with the increase of θ, and then decrease with the
increase of θ. Counterintuitively, suppliers' profits did not decrease
when the share of the premium for early security efforts increased,
but their profits increased. The reason is that although the distribu-
tion proportion increases the premium, means that the supplier's
security efforts in terms of food safety more share to the down-
stream producers, but the latter will also give more security invest-
ment to help the former and reduce the cost of the former in
promoting food safety and technology such as burden to gain
higher food safety efforts. High-quality food reduces the probability
of food safety incidents and the requirements for the traceability of
the food supply chain. Manufacturers can devote more resources
from building food traceability capabilities to the safety investment
of upstream suppliers. This has played a positive effect in a two-
way cycle. The increase in the share of the premium for safety
efforts θ has made the food supply chain appear a win–win situation.
But the security premium share ratio of the two sides is a win–win sit-
uation with a certain threshold of constraints; when it is more than
suppliers within the scope of its power to improve food security, pro-
ducers of the former investment enthusiasm also reduce and choose
to put more resources into food traceability. This behavior of exces-
sive exploitation of win-win benefits brings losses to the interests of
both sides and makes the overall supply chain benefit lower than
before. It is suggested that the two parties in cooperation should
make a reasonable distribution of the gains obtained, to maximize the
mutual benefit of both sides.

If the loss cost of unrecalled defective products is higher than the
cost coefficient of the traceability level of the food supply chain con-
sumers or food regulators prefer safe food and have a low tolerance
for defective products or food safety incidents cause large losses. It
can be observed that the profit function of the manufacturer is the
same as when the loss cost of the previous problem product is low. It
starts to increase with the increase in the premium ratio of the safety
effort within a certain range and then exceeds the critical value; it
decreases with the increase of the distribution proportion. However,
the supplier's profit will always decrease as the premium distribution
ratio increases. This phenomenon is very interesting. How to under-
stand how manufacturers make optimal decisions to recall products
when the compensation loss of unrecalled products is high, and why
suppliers' profits keep decreasing? We make a deeper analysis of this.
When the former bears the higher liability costs caused by the defec-
tive products, as the leader of the food supply chain, it tends to take a
higher proportion in the premium income of safe food to offset the
losses caused by the defective products to maximize their interests.
Manufacturers will make more safety investments for the latter to
incentivize them to increase the level of food safety efforts. This
allows suppliers to obtain higher safety investment and pay more
safety efforts; the overall marginal income decreases because the pre-
mium sharing ratio of the purchase contract signed by both parties is
too low. As the leader, the producer can obtain higher profits from
the advantage in the initial premium distribution ratio. The increase in
distribution requires the manufacturer to provide higher investment
support to upstream suppliers to maintain higher food safety levels.
Although the former can save the cost of the retrospective recall and
obtain a higher proportion of sharing, the requirement of safety
investment is higher at this time. By contrast, the sum of cost-saving
and premium income is lower than the expenditure on safety invest-
ment, and the total income of the final manufacturer is reduced com-
pared to before. It shows that when the unit does not recall the
problematic product and the loss is high, the manufacturer needs to
take the initiative to share more premium income to the upstream
supplier and make a safe investment in the latter according to its
actual situation.

In a nutshell, h is the cost coefficient for constructing the product
traceability recall level in the food traceability recall supply chain, and
c is the loss compensation caused by the problem product in the food
supply chain. The relationship between the two depends on the value
in different environments, that is, the difference in economic cost in
management. When the development of retrospective recall technol-
ogy is relatively slow and more resources are invested, the capital bur-
den on food companies is heavier. Therefore, compared with the risk
loss caused by low-quality products, companies are more inclined to
choose to give up the improvement of retrospective recall technology.
Conversely, for companies with strong scientific and technological
strength and markets where consumers pay more attention to food
quality, how to reduce the loss of problem food by further improving
the level of retrospective recall, that is, pay more attention to the risk
loss caused by problem food. It is a wise decision for the food com-
pany. To sum up, the relationship between the two is the cost differ-
ence that occurs according to changes in the environment such as the

Theorem 3.1 shows that when the unit loss cost caused by defec-
tive products in the food supply chain increases gradually, both the
safety investment intensity of the manufacturer and the safety effort
level of the supplier increase first and then decrease. The traceability
level of the entire food supply chain increases with the increase in the
unit loss cost of the unrecalled products. This makes us intuitively feel
that when a food safety incident occurs, as the loss cost of unrecalled
food increases, enterprises will further improve the traceability level
of the supply chain, and at the same time, they will make more invest-
ment in safety and improve the food safety level while taking respon-
sibility for the unrecalled products. However, companies are
constrained by their inherent resources and within the range of
affordability, when faced with low losses of unrecalled food per unit,
producers will make safety investments to suppliers to encourage
them to establish higher safety efforts to obtain more food safety pre-
miums for consumers and higher profits for the food chain. When the
loss cost of unit non-recall increases gradually, facing the dilemma of
higher and higher safety investment demand and the premium bene-
fits of safe food, manufacturers are more inclined to improve the
traceability level of the food supply chain to reduce the loss of defec-
tive products and maintain their profit maximization. Suppliers are
also forced to make lower level safety efforts when manufacturers
reduce their safety investments. Therefore, higher unit non-recall
product losses can promote the establishment of a traceability system
in the food supply chain but may not be conducive to improving the
safety and quality of food chain products.

With the increase in the unit loss cost of the unrecalled food
safety incidents, manufacturers tend to make more safety investments
in upstream suppliers to reduce compensation costs caused by food
safety at the beginning. Manufacturers continue to improve the trace-
ability level of the food chain at this time, which makes the overall
profit of the manufacturer decrease as the unit loss of unrecalled
products increases. On the contrary, after receiving the manufac-
turer's investment in safety, suppliers can implement a higher level of
food safety, which will increase the supplier's revenue without
increasing the unit cost of the recall. This is a counter-intuitive situa-
tion. The so-called “free rider” phenomenon occurs when the
upstream supplier gains from the loss compensation of the down-
stream manufacturer in the face of traceability failure. Then, the
increase of unit unrecalled losses reduces the enthusiasm of manufac-
turers to improve the safety and quality of products, reduces the
safety investment of suppliers to save their costs, and instead puts
resources into product retrospective recall to reduce the loss of prob-
lematic products. This encourages manufacturers to make more secu-
rity investments and have higher returns than before. With the
reduction of manufacturers' safety investment, suppliers' initiative in

The theorem shows that the increase in the safety investment
cost coefficient of the food supply chain means that suppliers need to
invest more resources to obtain the same investment effect as before,
which intensifies the safety investment burden of the enterprise. This
reduces the initiative of suppliers to improve the safety efforts of the
food chain when the safety investment is reduced. However, manu-
facturers will choose to focus on food traceability recall when faced
with high food safety investment and low effects, in an attempt to
reduce the safety loss incurred in the food safety incident.
5 | NUMERICAL SIMULATION
In this section, to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed
propositions and inferences, matlab2019 is used for numerical simula-
tion analysis. To ensure the generality of the various values, refer to
Chao et al. (2009) and Dai et al. (2020, 2021); numerical examples are
used to intuitively illustrate the results of this article. The following
figure focuses on the impact of different parameters on the food sup-
ply chain. Among them, the safety effort premium sharing ratio, the
unit's unrecalled food loss cost, and the safety investment cost coeffi-
cient on the manufacturers, suppliers in the food supply chain,
research on the impact of the best product safety efforts and product
recall strategies on business decisions is discussed.
Figure 3 respectively shows the relationship between food safety
investment decisions, recall level, and product safety efforts of manu-
facturers and suppliers under different circumstances and the propor-
tion of food safety premium sharing. The figure on the left shows that
when the unit's loss of unrecalled products is lower than the tracking
recall cost coefficient of the food supply chain, the increase in the
share of the safety premium has a win–win effect in the early stage.
Manufacturers are more interested in investing in the food safety of
upstream suppliers, who also have the motivation to improve product
safety efforts. In addition, manufacturers can reduce recall costs by
reducing the level of traceability in the supply chain. Once the share
ratio of safety premium exceeds the threshold, it can be found from
the image that even though the safety investment of producers is
increasing, the enthusiasm of suppliers to improve safety efforts
begins to decline, which makes the producers have to increase the
traceability level to offset the negative effect of reducing safety
efforts in the food supply chain. However, with the further imbalance
of sharing ratio, safety efforts continue to decrease, and manufac-
turers' willingness to invest in safety has also begun to weaken, turn-
ing more investment resources into improving the level of food
traceability. Therefore, the conclusion in the theorem is verified again.
When the sharing proportion of safety premium exceeds a certain
range and the difference of profit-sharing is large, both parties will be
disadvantageous and become losers.
Figure 3, right, shows when the unit cost of unrecalled products
is higher than the tracked cost factor. Through the intuitive discovery
of the right, in order to manage the risks caused by low-quality food,
the manufacturer chooses to invest in the safety of the supplier from
the beginning. The initial safety investment failed to meet the needs

of suppliers, and the increase in the share of food safety premiums
has made suppliers less motivated to improve product safety. The fur-
ther increase in safety investment by manufacturers stimulates sup-
pliers to improve their product safety efforts. The former reduces the
investment in retrospective recall while improving food safety. It can
be understood that members of the food chain are more inclined to
devote more resources to improving food safety, rather than improv-
ing the traceability of product recalls. They realize that for the food
supply chain that focuses on safety and quality, the improvement of
traceability is a temporary solution but not a permanent cure. The key
is to improve the safety and health of food, and they can also obtain
the benefits of higher safety premiums.
Figure 4 analyzes the relationship between the income of each
member in the food supply chain and the share ratio of safety pre-
mium. Through comparison, it is found that the overall trend of manu-
facturer's profit with the proportion of safety premium sharing has
little change in the difference between the traceability cost coefficient
and the loss per unit of unrecalled product. This is because the manu-
facturer should always maintain a balanced relationship between
safety investment and traceability level while ensuring the maximiza-
tion of their interests. When safety investment intensity is large, the
requirements for traceability level will be reduced. Conversely, a
higher level of traceability means less investment in safety. Therefore,
the leading producer in the early stage can obtain a higher proportion
of the profit of food safety premium. While in the later stage, their
overall profit declines due to the reduced enthusiasm of suppliers to
improve food safety and the high loss of unrecalled products.
However, we find that the utility function of suppliers varies
under different circumstances. If the traceability cost coefficient is
higher than the loss per unit of unrecalled product, the supplier's reve-
nue will increase with the share of the safety premium, and the image
will appear convex. Even though the dominant players receive more
food safety premiums, the benefits of high-safety investment are
more conducive to suppliers to improve food safety and increase their
profits. When the benefits of safety investment fail to further moti-
vate suppliers, the latter will be less enthusiastic about food safety
efforts, resulting in a negative circular effect. The reduction in food
safety efforts and the high share of safety premiums have made sup-
pliers' revenues fall even faster. If the loss cost of unrecalled products
is large, although the manufacturer always increases the upstream
safety investment, the latter also continuously improves the food
safety efforts. However, leaders will occupy more consumers' pre-
miums for safe food, driving down the revenue of suppliers. There-
fore, when large-scale production companies face more severe food
safety incidents, their upstream suppliers are often more severely
affected.
Figure 5 shows that the increase of the loss cost of unrecalled
food makes the manufacturer continuously improve the traceability
level of the food chain and strive to recall the food on the largest scale
to reduce the loss caused by food safety incidents. Moreover, to pun-
ish food enterprises with quality problems to a certain extent has the
motivation to promote the improvement of food safety. However,
when the punishment is too heavy and exceeds the range that enter-
prises can bear, manufacturers will often neglect the improvement of

product safety due to the loss of recall. Therefore, when the unit's loss
of unrecalled food gradually increases, the manufacturer will simulta-
neously invest in safety and improve the level of a product recall, and
the overall profit will drop by a large margin. The increased punish-
ment of the problem food and the high requirement of safety invest-
ment force manufacturers to be inclined to improve the traceability
recall of the food supply chain. However, in terms of loss cost, safety
investment cost, and traceability input, the overall cost decreases, so
the overall profit increases.
The revenue curve of the supplier in Figure 6 shows that when
the loss of the unit without recall increases, its revenue also increases.
This is a “free rider” behavior. Through high-penalty food safety poli-
cies, suppliers can get more premium benefits from consumers' safety
efforts under the manufacturer's high-level safety investment. When
the latter chooses to reduce the safety investment and increase the
recall investment to reduce the loss of the unrecalled part, the free-
riding effect disappears and the supplier's income declines. Therefore,
we know that food safety policy has a significant impact on the
decision-making of food enterprises.
As shown in Figure 7, when the cost of safety investment
increases, the producers of the food supply chain will reduce their
safety investment on upstream suppliers, and the latter will also make
low-level safety efforts under the condition of reduced investment
support. When suppliers can obtain more safety investment from
manufacturers, they can provide consumers with food with higher
safety efforts. Higher quality products mean lower incidences of food
safety incidents and lower traceability requirements for the overall
food supply chain. Finally, the former chooses to reduce the losses
caused by the problem food by investing in traceability recall of the
food chain.
As shown in Figure 8, the increase of food safety investment cost
makes the food enterprises in the food supply chain tend to focus on
product recall, but give up the improvement of food safety, and the
income of each member also decreases. For the overall optimization
of the food chain, how to reduce the cost of food safety investment
and technical problems has become an urgent target for the govern-
ment and food enterprises.

With the development of the social economy, agriculture is gradually
transforming to digitalization, trying to optimize the industrial struc-
ture by taking digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, big
data, and blockchain as the core. As a digital layer, blockchain has the
characteristics of data tamper-proof, traceability, and enhancing peer
trust among nodes (Wang et al., 2021), which can provide consumers
and other members of the supply chain with reliable and trustworthy
products' source and product information (Kamble et al., 2020).
Besides, it can effectively improve consumers' trust in product quality
and expand market demand. Meanwhile, the decentralized database

technology can prevent information from being tampered with and
the data information is authentic and reliable. The traceability function
of data information of each node can help solve the mistrust among
manufacturers in each link of the supply chain (Salah et al., 2019),
shirk each other's responsibility, and achieve a fair and clear distribu-
tion of responsibility (Hastig & Sodhi, 2020) to optimize the supply
chain, downstream manufacturers introduced blockchain traceability
for product recalls. The information sharing on the chain can identify
the source of the problem food, and the upstream supplier needs to
bear the responsibility for the loss of the problem food. Combining
the above model assumptions, we analyze the optimal strategy of
each member of the food chain under the condition that the supplier
and the manufacturer share the loss cost of the unrecalled products.

manufacturer has an optimal decision-making solution for retrospec-
tive recall and safety investment in the food supply chain, s� and t�.
Then, the supplier's optimal decision is obtained by substituting the
manufacturer's optimal decision into the supplier's response function.
As the result of the solution is too complicated, we use numerical
examples to display the results numerically.
Figure 9 shows safety investment and traceability recall under
cost-sharing. After the introduction of blockchain technology in the
agricultural product supply chain, due to information sharing, suppliers
need to bear a portion of the loss of unrecalled products in food
safety incidents. It can be found that suppliers in the food chain are
more motivated to increase product safety efforts with clearer
responsibility for food safety issues, indicating that information shar-
ing is conducive to promoting food safety and quality. When the man-
ufacturer shares the loss of unrecalled products with the upstream, it
will increase the safety investment of suppliers to help them better
improve the safety and quality of products. Besides, considering that
the upstream will work hard to improve products when faced with
food safety penalties, manufacturers will reduce their investment in
food retrospective recalls. With the increase in the share of the pro-
portion, after the safety investment reaches the upper limit of the
threshold, the manufacturer chooses to reduce the safety investment.
Because it has higher requirements on the supplier to bear more
losses of food safety events, the manufacturer can take a “free ride”
from the supplier at this time.
Figure 10 shows the safety decision of investment and effort
under the cost-sharing ratio. We considered the situation where the
two companies share the problematic food loss when the manufac-
turer does not implement a retrospective recall strategy (the dotted
line in Figure 10 is t = 0; that is, the system has no traceable recall). It
can be understood as a benefit-sharing and cost-sharing model in
which the upstream and downstream of the food supply chain jointly
face the food safety incident. Manufacturers' investment in down-
stream food safety gradually decreases with the increase of the pro-
portion of sharing. The increase in the loss of unrecalled food prompts
suppliers to improve food safety to reduce the punishment. When the

share ratio continues to increase, the marginal benefit brought by
food safety improvement decreases, and the motivation of suppliers
to improve safety also decreases. Therefore, suppliers' safety efforts
show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Therefore, for-
mulating an effective food safety sharing mechanism is conducive to
further improving food safety quality and optimizing the overall bene-
fits of the food supply chain.
7 | CONCLUSIONS
7.1 | Conclusions and management suggestion
With strict food monitoring and consumers' emphasis on safety and
health, product safety and quality have gradually become a problem
to be solved in the food supply chain. In addition, advances in technol-
ogy, such as blockchain and RFID technology, have made the trace-
ability system an important function of the supply chain, aiming to
solve the problem of product recalls. Different from traditional quality
improvement measures, such as improving the food's safety, which
helps reduce the probability of food product recalls. Supply chain
traceability helps reduce product recalls that cannot be determined to
be safe due to the proportion of products recalled. Besides, in prac-
tice, the investment cost of a traceability system can be the variable
cost of equipping each product with equipment or information
records, while the safety investment cost of food products is usually a
large company's weaker upstream or downstream cooperation, which
includes the fixed equipment cost or technology cost raised by the
supplier. Therefore, the efficiency of managing recalls in the supply
chain is determined by the interaction of traceability, the safety
investment of partners, and the optimization of product safety efforts.
This article uses a game theory model to capture the total interaction
between a single manufacturer and the supply chain and consumers
and considers the relationship between the traceability investment of
large downstream companies and the upstream safety efforts regard-
ing the sharing of food safety premiums. The interaction between
product safety efforts and the optimization of retrospective recall
capabilities in the food supply chain is studied. Through the analysis
of the safety premium sharing ratio, the loss cost of unrecalled prod-
ucts per unit, and the investment cost coefficient, the best product
safety efforts and traceability capabilities in the food supply chain are
found. Finally, we find that there is Pareto optimal condition in food
chain retrospective recall strategy compared with no recall strategy.
Retrospective recall of defective products is beneficial to improve the
optimal strategies of the food supply chain and improve the overall
welfare. At the end of the paper, the management suggestions and
strategies suitable for food enterprises are given.
This article summarizes the main findings and enlightenments
from different aspects. First, for each member of the food supply
chain, there is the only optimal food safety effort, following ability,
and safety investment in a closed expression. The share of the con-
sumer premium brought by product safety improvement among mem-
bers of the food chain affects the optimal decision of both parties is
found. When the loss cost of a unit's unrecalled products is lower than
the traceable cost coefficient, the manufacturer has more product
safety premiums that are conducive to the optimization of the entire
food supply chain. However, when the share ratio of the safety pre-
mium is too large, the supplier's enthusiasm will be reduced. The
safety and quality of food chain products are negative, and more
resources are invested in the recall system for problematic products.
On the other hand, when the cost coefficient of retrospective recall is
low, manufacturers will choose higher retrospective capabilities, and
suppliers face a higher share of the security premium, and only when
the downstream investment exceeds a certain threshold, will they
have the motivation to increase product safety and quality. In addi-
tion, the high cost of loss of unrecalled products has prompted the
food supply chain to abandon the improvement of food safety and
choose to invest in the retrospective recall function. Besides, when
the cost of the unit's failure to recall the product is low, the supplier
can use the supervision and punishment of the manufacturer to obtain
a higher level of investment in safety, resulting in a “free rider” phe-
nomenon. Finally, the increase in the food safety investment cost
coefficient has increased the burden on the overall food supply chain,
which is not conducive to the improvement of the safety of food
products, and the income of various food companies has also
declined.
7.2 | Contribution and management suggestions
On the one hand, the food industry's policies and regulations on food
safety and quality need to be formulated according to the company's
affordability. When the product safety and quality requirements of
food companies are too high and the punishment is too heavy, it will
often have counterproductive effects. Companies in the food chain
are more inclined to solve problem products by building a traceable

of their products. On the other hand, manufacturers need to share as
much food safety premium revenue as possible with upstream
suppliers to incentivize them to improve product safety. Otherwise,
manufacturers need to make more safety investments to help their
suppliers maintain the motivation to improve product quality. In addi-
tion, suppliers can also cooperate with manufacturers to cope with
the increase in safety investment costs and unrecallable food losses,
to obtain the optimal strategy and maximum benefits for higher social
benefits.
7.3 | Future research directions
This article is the first attempt to analyze the interaction between
traceability, food safety, and investment optimization under the coor-
dination of upstream and downstream. In this article, the impact of
food safety efforts on consumer utility is only considered. In addition,
in real life, there are a large number of consumers concerned about
whether there is traceability in the food supply chain. Therefore,
future research will further divide the consumer groups in terms of
traceability and explore the equilibrium relationship between them. In
addition, there is no specific analysis and discussion on the part of the
cost that can be recalled. The following will conduct research on the
high recall cost and the high penalty cost of non-recall loss. Moreover,
because of the current development of traceability technology, its
tracking ability can accurately locate the source of the product's prob-
lem and determine the specific responsible party. Therefore, the cost-
sharing of the recall strategy caused by different reasons is the next
issue that I want to study. Finally, extending this interaction between
traceability and security investment to a multi-channel supply chain
and exploring the differences in the results are of very practical inter-
est and research significance.
