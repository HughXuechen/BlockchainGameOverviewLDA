Abstract—The integration of blockchain and Industrial Inter-
net of Things (IIoT) results in a new model of supply chain in
which blockchain provides common platform to record the data
whereas IIoT facilitates connectivity of the devices. The temper-
proof record, traceability, and verification of each step (trans-
parency) from manufacturing to final availability of the product is
made possible through blockchain which results in a transparent
supply chain. However, the high-level transparency also increases
the risk of disclosure of business-related and personal information
(minimum privacy) such as business secrets, intellectual property,
and special incentives to adversaries. Consequently, a trade-off
between transparency and privacy is established. Therefore, this
work proposes a blockchain-based supply chain management
in the context of IIoT known as SM-IIoT which discusses this
transparency-privacy trade-off. Furthermore, the trade-off prob-
lem is turned into a Game in which the participants act as players
whereas the transparency and privacy leakage are the payoff and
loss, respectively. Consequently, the players compete to maximize
their payoffs but minimize their individual losses due to privacy
leakage. Nash equilibrium gives the solution for the Game which
optimizes the payoffs of the players (e.g., maximum transparency
and minimum privacy leakage). The scenario is implemented
through Hyperledger fabric (HF) blockchain. Moreover, the
results suggested that the proposed SM-IIoT outperforms the
game theory based privacy preserving analysis approach in big
data (GB-PPABD) in terms of transparency. Furthermore, the
comparison with other similar works revealed that SM-IIoT owns
the key attributes of the supply chain including transparency-
privacy trade-off, fairness, and competitive behavior modeling of
the participants.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a distributed data structure with the features
of transparency, security, and immutability due to which it has
been adopted in various domains including health, Internet
of Things (IoT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), smart grids, smart
cities, and communication networks [1], [2]. The integration
of blockchain and IIoT enables a consortium of supply chain
(such as manufacturer, distributor, and retailer) where the
blockchain provides the common platform to record and share
different operations (manufacture, transport, and distribute)
across the network and IIoT provides the connectivity of var-
ious industrial devices [3]–[5]. Most importantly, blockchain
facilitates tracking of the origin of source, i.e., from man-
ufacturing to market availability for valuable products such
as food items, electronic equipment, and jewelry across the
supply chain through granting access to all information related

to products. The food industry and agriculture are practical
examples of traceable supply chains.
The transparency of data is to measure the degree to which
the participants can see or access the origin or sequence
of operations performed on the data. However, in a semi-
trusted environment of supply chain, a 100% transparency will
result in disclosure of sensitive information such as business
plans, intellectual property, incentives, and financial status to
adversaries and business rivals which is not acceptable in
practical scenarios [6]. The reason is that each participant in
the supply chain has its private data (incentives, intellectual
property, business secrets) which is not always shared with the
rest of the network. For example, Table I shows calculation
of transparency and privacy for a supply chain consisting
of manufacturer, distributor and retailer. In this example, the
data such as number of items sold is shared between them
and transparency is taken as: No. of participants allowed to see it
Total No. of participants
. For
instance, 3/3 = 1 means that all operations are visible to all
participants of the supply chain. As a result, the privacy is
minimum.
Consequently, it is evident from Table I that a trade-off
between transparency and privacy is established, i.e., when the
privacy is maximum then the transparency is minimum (least
of calculated values) and vice versa. As a result, increasing the
visibility of operations performed by individual participants of
supply chain will increase the risk of their privacy disclosure
to their rivals or adversaries in the same network. Here, we
discuss privacy with differential privacy technique because it
is accepted as a de facto standard for privacy definition [7].
Applying differential privacy to data decreases the accuracy
or utility of data. The privacy level is defined by a parame-
ter called differential privacy budget ε. Previously, privacy-
utility trade-off problem is heavily discussed in literature
[8]. For example, Table II shows the privacy-utility trade-
off for sales data. Here, the privacy is equivalent to the
value of ε, whereas utility or accuracy of data is defined

defined as:
|actual No. of items sold-perturbed No. of items sold|
actual No. of items sold
. Table II
shows that increasing the ε increases the accuracy or utility
of the data and vice versa.
It is evident from Table II that the privacy-utility trade-off
discussed in literature balances the trade-off between privacy
and utility in the context of data sharing/publishing. However,
the effect of transparency on privacy, i.e., transparency-privacy
trade-off has not been considered so far. Moreover, Table I
shows that increasing the transparency significantly impacts
the privacy which raises the question that what is the high-
est level of transparency which simultaneously protects the
privacy of individual participants, and which is acceptable
to all stakeholders in blockchain-based supply chain in the
context of IIoT? Therefore, in this work, we investigate the
transparency-privacy trade-off problem to answer the above
question. Hyperledger fabric blockchain is adopted to au-
tomate the transactions and contracts through its chaincode
(smart contract) between supply chain participants [9].
Our contributions in this work are summarized as follows.
We develop a blockchain-based supply chain model in the
context of IIoT using HF blockchain which is called SM-
IIoT. Differential privacy is integrated into the chaincode
(smart contract) to guarantee privacy preservation. Finally, the
trade-off problem is turned into a Game between semi-trusted
supply chain participants. In our game model, participants
of supply chain act as players whereas the transparency and
privacy leakage are considered as payoff and loss, respectively.
Furthermore, we evaluate the Nash equilibrium for the game
which optimizes the payoff for each player. Moreover, the
proposed SM-IIoT is compared with the traditional privacy-
utility trade-off approach of [8], and other similar works to
reveal its novelty in terms of transparency and other key
attributes of the supply chain, respectively.
The rest of the paper is organized according to the following
sequence: in Section II, a literature review of previous works
in the related domain is presented. In Section III, we present
the proposed model SM-IIoT in detail. Similarly, Section IV
presents the evaluation and simulation results. Finally, Section
V concludes this work.
II. RELATED WORK
In [10], a blockchain-based food supply chain is proposed
which is called TrustChain. TrustChain consists of three layers
which are data, blockchain, and application. A reputation mod-
ule is integrated into blockchain which evaluates scores based
on the authenticity of data and entities in the blockchain. In
this way, it avoids false information generation and improves
trust across the supply chain. Furthermore, it was found that
TrustChain achieves trustworthiness through the incorporated
reputation module while keeping the throughput and latency
at the same level. In [11], a new blockchain-based framework
for recording of product-related data over different stages of
its life cycle is proposed which is called carbon footprint chain
(CFC). CFC enables tracking of carbon footprint through the
fine-grained collection of product-related data at all stages. In
CFC, the whole supply chain is divided into private clusters
which represent individual stages of the product’s life cycle.
Furthermore, through evaluation, authors showed that CFC
achieves high throughput, and minimum transaction processing
time as compared to traditional blockchain network.
Similarly, a lightweight blockchain-enabled RFID-based au-
thentication protocol (LBRAPS) for supply chain management
has been proposed in [12]. LBRAPS is basically a blend of
AI, mobile edge computing (MEC), blockchain, and RFID
technologies. The proposed model consists of blockchain
nodes which read RFID tags as the product moves from
manufacturing to consumption stage. In this way, each stage
of the product’s life cycle is verified and authenticated. More-
over, it was found that the protocol resists many privacy
attacks and achieves high efficiency in terms of communication
and computation. In [13], a new consensus mechanism for
blockchain-based food supply chain (FSC) scenario has been
proposed which is known as Proof of Object (PoO). PoO
suits the supply chain scenario because it is based on the
proof of physical object to win the mining race rather than
a computation task in PoW which is virtual. RFID tagging
has been adopted to read a food package and record is flow
across the supply chain. Similarly, in [14]–[16], blockchain
has been adopted to increase the transparency, enable privacy
preservation, and share data to incentivize each other in the
context of IIoT. Apart from this, in large-scale sensor networks
such as industrial environment, accurate real-time data is
needed to control various processes (i.e., in manufacturing
and designing) [17]. However, cloud computing has several
challenging problems such as service composition [18], [19],
minimum transparency, and security.
It is evident from the existing literature that the main focus of
these works is on transparency, privacy, provenance, security,
and verification. However, the transparency-privacy trade-off
problem has not been discussed so far. Furthermore, in a
consortium of supply chain participants, each participant needs
different privacy level which results in a semi-trusted envi-
ronment. Consequently, it is challenging to adopt the existing
blockchain without solving the transparency-privacy trade-off
problem.
III. PROPOSED WORK: SM-IIOT
This Section presents the proposed work (SM-IIoT) in
detail.
A. Preliminaries
1) Game Theory: Game theory provides a framework to
model the interactions and decision-making process between
1124

supply chain (SM-IIoT).
the players involving in conflicting interests over the outcome
of a decision process [20]. Furthermore, games can be divided
into two broad categories known as cooperative and non-
cooperative games.
In cooperative games, the players have a common goal which
is achieved through utilization of individual contributions.
Therefore, this type is also called coalition games or group-
oriented games. In non-cooperative games, the players do
not coordinate and nor have a common goal. Consequently,
each player takes decision in order to increase only its own
outcome. In this work, we adopt non-cooperative game model.
The reason is that the players in supply chain are rational
and tries to increase transparency (payoff) while decrease their
individual privacy leakage (loss). As a result, non-cooperative
game model is suitable to analyze the interaction between
players and find the optimized decisions. Our proposed non-
cooperative game model is presented in Section III-C.
2) Differential Privacy: Differential privacy has been ac-
cepted as a de facto standard for privacy definition [7]. In
differential privacy, a calibrated noise is added to the true
value of data before sharing/publishing. As a result, the data
receiver extracts the required knowledge from the shared data
while the true value is hidden. In this way, the privacy of the
data holder is protected. According to [7], differential privacy
can be defined as following:
Definition 1: A randomized algorithm Z satisfies ε-differential
privacy if for all datasets D1, D2 which differs in at most one
record, and for all O ⊂ Range(Z), the following inequality
holds [7]:
P [Z(D1) ∈ O] ≤ eε × P [(Z(D2) ∈ O] (by [7]) (1)
Here, Range (Z) denotes the range of all possible outputs of
algorithm Z. ε is known as differential privacy budget which
satisfies ε > 0 . Moreover, a greater value of ε represents less
privacy while a smaller value represents high privacy.
We adopt differential privacy model for privacy preservation
because it gives a mathematical definition of privacy, and it
considers an adversary with strong background information.
Consequently, any dataset which satisfies differential privacy
guarantees privacy preservation.
B. System model of SM-IIoT
The proposed system model consists of a supply chain
scenario based on HF blockchain network as shown in Fig.
1. In the proposed scenario, a general supply chain model
is considered which consists of manufacturer, distributor, and
retailer. The detail of various components and data sharing is
given below.
1) Composition of system model of SM-IIoT:
a) Node: Each node in the chain represents a full or-
ganization or company which has various Industrial devices
equipped with sensors (e.g., RFID sensor, temperature senor,
and location sensor) connected through wireless media. The
node is capable of recording the data, i.e., blocks of data.
b) Channel: It represents a sub-network which limits the
visibility of transactions to members of the channel [9]. Fur-
thermore, transactions in each channel in HF are maintained
in a separate ledgers which are only accessible to its members.
c) Transaction: It consists of various types of transac-
tions in HF including financial, query, read, write, and update
transactions. Furthermore, the query transaction is used to
request data recorded on the ledger of a different channel.
d) Chaincode: The smart contract of HF is known as
chaincode [9]. Moreover, it automates interaction between
various nodes of the blockchain through the implementation
of read, write, query and update operations on the blockchain
ledger.
1125

e) Differential privacy function: It consists of a function
which implements differential privacy using Laplace mecha-
nism [8]. Furthermore, the function is installed on the peer as
part of the chaincode.
2) Data Sharing in SM-IIoT: In the proposed scenario, the
data consists of two types which are data of the same HF
channel and data from a different HF channel. To increase
the transparency, the data between different channels is shared
through query transactions. Moreover, we only consider shar-
ing of statistical data such as number of products sold or
received and discounts rates as private information of the node.
The reason is that its disclosure to competitors results in heavy
loss and significant effect on the business interests of rivals.
Furthermore, it is to be noted that private information can
be extended in the same fashion to include other sensitive
data such as secret plans, intellectual property etc. Therefore,
query transaction consists of a statistical query such as what
is the total number of items sold? The node tries to protect
its sensitive information while contributing to transparency of
the supply chain.
To protect the sensitive information, the node uses differential
privacy function of the chaincode, i.e., the query is evaluated,
and a perturbed response is generated which is then returned to
the requesting participant. Therefore, the overall transparency
in the proposed scenario, is to increase the visibility or access
of the data of the same as well as different HF channel.
C. Game Model of SM-IIoT
The participants in the supply chain shown in Fig. 1 are
interested to increase the transparency of operations across the
supply chain in order to satisfy consumers, improve the quality,
and reduce frauds through tracking. However, the disclosure
of operations by individual participants can leak sensitive
information to competitors and adversaries. Consequently,
each participant is rational to maximize the transparency
but minimize the disclosure or leakage of its own sensitive
information. Therefore, game theoretic model is suitable to
analyze such kind of supply chain. We consider z such nodes
or participants in the supply chain model for our analysis
and develop game between two of them. The game consists
of a single round (non-iterative game) in which the players
constitute a competition to select strategies so that their pay-
offs are maximized. We first define transparancy and privacy
leakage with their mathematical representations and then we
define our game model. We adopt the definition of blockchain
transparency from [1] and formulate its mathematical form as
following:
Definition 2: In a supply chain of z nodes, if q is the number
of nodes which can see or allowed to see all the operations
across the supply chain then the transparency T is given as
following:
T = q/z (2)
Here, T denotes the transparency of supply chain. Further-
more, for given z nodes, higher q will give more transparency
and vis versa. In the considered scenario, transparency refers
to the accessibility/visibility of overall supply chain opera-
tions including transactions, certificate sharing, composition of
products and delivery locations etc. Furthermore, it is strongly
related to channels in HF, i.e., if two participants are on
the same channel then the transparency is maximum whereas
participants in different channel has minimum transparency.
Since, we propose two player game model (as discussed in
the start of this Section), therefore, the range of T can be
identified, i.e, if both participants are on the same channel,
then both can see the supply chain operations and hence q
z = 1
otherwise, only one of them will see the operations and hence,
q
z = 0.5. Consequently, the range of T is Range(T) ∈ [0.5,
1]. Therefore, 0.5 represents minimum transparency whereas
1 represents the maximum transparency.
In the proposed scenario, guarantee of privacy protection of
sensitive information is achieved through differential privacy.
Therefore, we adopt the definition of privacy from [21] and
modify it to formulate the definition of privacy leakage of a
node in supply chain as following:
Definition 3: The differential privacy leakage of a supply
chain participant can be represented as a monotonically
increasing function in privacy budget ε. let C be real number
such that C > 0 then the privacy leakage P can be denoted
as following:
P = Cε (by [21]) (3)
Here, ε > 0, P denotes the privacy leakage of a supply
chain participant, and C is real number which represents
weight constant for privacy defined by each participant. More
specifically, the data owner (a supply chain participant in our
scenario) which needs strict privacy, i.e., they don’t want to
take risk of privacy leakage and prefer privacy protection
over transparency will use comparatively high value of C.
Consequently, for same value of ε in equation 3, the value of
P will be comparatively high for the participant with the high
value of C, i.e., the privacy leakage will be high. Therefore,
the participants select the privacy weight C according to their
preferences. Furthermore, the privacy leakage is maximum
(P = 1) when the ε value exceeds the maximum allowed
differential privacy budget εmax for a participant, i.e., beyond
that maximum value of ε, data is no more differentially
private because the noise added is negligible. Therefore, from
equation 3, C = 1
εmax
. For example, for typical large value of
εmax = 3, C = 1
3 . As a result, εmax = 3 gives maximum
privacy leakage. Furthermore, the privacy leakages of two
players will be C1ε1, and C2ε2. Here, C1 and C2 are weight
constants whereas ε1 and ε2 are differential privacy budgets
for both players.
1) Non-Cooperative Game for SM-IIoT: In this Section, the
formulation of our non-cooperative game model is presented.
We describe our game model as follows:
a) Players: Two supply chain participants, i.e, distributor
and retailer are the players (any two of the nodes can be
selected as players) of the non-cooperative game as shown
1126
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 08:30:38 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
in Fig. 1. Distributor is represented as p1 and retailer is
represented as p2.
b) Strategies: The strategies for p1 and p2 consist of the
set of values for differential privacy budget ε. In the considered
system model, for both p1 and p2, εji ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1} whereas
j ∈ {p1, p2} and i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
c) Payoffs: The payoff for each player is given as the
difference of transparency T and privacy leakage P. The reason
is that the transparency is considered as gain whereas the
privacy leakage is the loss or cost for each player. According
to definitions 2 and 3, the payoff U1(ε1i , ε2j ) of p1 is given
as U1(ε1i , ε2j ) =
q
z +C2ε2j −C1ε1i . In U1(ε1i , ε2j ), the term
q
z represents the overall visibility of transactions between two
channel members, term C2ε2j denotes the privacy leakage

of p2 and C1ε1i represents the privacy leakage (loss) for p1.
Similarly, for p2, payoff is given as U2(ε1i , ε2j ) =
q
z+C1ε1i−
C2ε2j . Here, the terms definitions are same as for U1(ε1i , ε2j ).
2) Game Analysis and Nash Equilibrium: In the game
analysis, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium, which
is the solution of the game, i.e., the Nash equilibrium consists
of strategies profile having one strategy for each player of
the game which gives maximum payoff for each player given
that other player does not change its strategy [20]. In the
proposed scenario, a Nash equilibrium of the game means
that all supply chain participants are satisfied, i.e., it fulfills
the needs for improved transparency and privacy protection.
To prove that the proposed game has a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium, the payoffs of both players need to satisfy the
following two conditions [8], [20], i.e., for p1, ∂2U1
∂2ε1i
≤ 0 and
∂2U1
∂ε1i∂ε2j
≥ 0. Similarly, for p2, the conditions are ∂2U2
∂2ε2j
≤ 0
and ∂2U2
∂ε2j ∂ε1i
≥ 0. We prove both conditions for p1 as
following.
∂U1
∂ε1i
= −C1 (first order partial derivative of U1) (4)
∂2U1
∂2ε1i
= 0 (second order partial derivative of U1) (5)
Similarly, taking the partial derivative of the result in equation
4 with respect to ε2j yields:
∂2U1
∂ε2j∂ε1i
= 0 (Since, C1 is a constant) (6)
Therefore, the above result of equation 6 completes the proof
of second condition for the existence of at least one pure
Nash equilibrium. In the same fashion, both conditions are
verified for p2 as following.
∂U2
∂ε2j
= −C2 (first order partial derivative of U2) (7)

Similarly, taking the partial derivative of the result in equation
7 with respect to ε1i yields:
∂2U2
∂ε1i∂ε2j
= 0 (Since, C2 is a constant) (9)
Hence, the outcome of equation 9 completes the proof.
In this way, the pure strategy profile which results in Nash
equilibrium is represented as a pair (ε∗1i , ε
∗
2j ) where ε∗1i =
BR1(ε
∗
2j ) and ε∗2j = BR2(ε

1i ), and BR stands for Best
Response.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The performance of proposed SM-IIoT is evaluated by
simulating a blockchain-based supply chain scenario using
HF blockchain. Furthermore, to witness the superiority of
our proposed SM-IIoT, we compare it with the state-of-the-
art works in two ways. Firstly, it is compared with the game
theory based privacy preserving analysis approach in big data
(GB-PPABD) of [8] to witness its superiority in terms of
transparency consideration. Secondly, it is compared with the
similar works of [13]–[16] to witness its superiority in terms
of transparency-privacy trade-off, fairness, and competitive
behavior modeling of participants.
The software setup includes Fabric software under test (SUT)

with SDK version 1.4.11 and Ubuntu-18 64-bit operating
system whereas Caliper version 0.4.0 is used for evaluation of
SUT [22]. Similarly, the hardware setup includes Intel(R)Core
(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.6 GHz processor with 8 GB of
installed physical memory. The differential privacy budget is
taken according to εji ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1}. The solution of the
game (that is Nash equilibrium) is evaluated to identify best
strategies (ε∗1i , ε
∗
2j ) for both players. Other evaluation param-
eters include privacy preservation, throughput and latency of
transactions.
A. Best response strategies
The payoffs for both players are evaluated using the con-
figured setting with weights C1 = 0.3, C2 = 0.2 for p1 and
p2, respectively. The values of weights are not fixed and can
be changed accordingly for any node of the network. In the
evaluation, we consider different weights for players and the
evaluation for equal weights are not included. Furthermore,
z = 2, q ∈ {1, 2} is configured. Here, the value of q depends
on whether p1, p2 are on the same channel. The payoffs are
calculated, and the results are inserted into a matrix. p1 is
represented as the row player whereas the p2 is represented
as the column player in the matrix. Finally, the dominant
strategy row and column elimination method is used to find the
(ε∗1i , ε
∗
2j ) [20]. The results are given in Tables III and IV. The
values highlighted with bold fonts (e.g., (0.99, 1.01) and (0.49,
0.51)) in Tables III and IV represent the maximum payoffs
using best response strategies (ε∗1i , ε
∗
2j ) for both players. As a
result, these strategies optimize the payoffs, i.e., transparency
T under the constraint of differential privacy for both players.
Furthermore, the maximum payoffs in Table III, i.e., (0.99,
1.01) are greater than in Table IV, i.e., (0.49, 0.51) because
in Table IV, the players are on different channels for which
q
z = 0.5 rather than 1. The mathematical steps to execute the
game are given in algorithm 1.
B. Privacy preservation in SM-IIoT
The comparison of protected and unprotected data sharing is
evaluated by taking ε = 0.1. The reason is that ε = 0.1 results
in high value of payoffs for both players as shown in Tables
III and IV. Furthermore, a total of 500 write transactions were
sent to initialize the ledger. Similarly, 500 query transactions
were sent in order to share data between two blockchain
nodes. The results are presented in Fig. 2. It demonstrates
that the beneficial knowledge has been retained in the shared
data (minor difference in actual and perturb curves) while the
privacy protection equivalent to ε = 0.1 is guaranteed in the
proposed SM-IIoT. As a result, at the equilibrium state of
the game, the players get maximum payoffs and achieve high
transparency for minimum privacy leakage.
C. Throughput and Latency of transactions in SM-IIoT
The throughput and latency of transactions in the blockchain
network were evaluated by varying the input transactions rate

from 10 tran/sec to 50 tran/sec. Two types of transactions
were considered which are write and query transactions. The
results are presented in Fig. 3. The throughput is increasing
for both write and query transactions with increase in the
input transactions rate as shown in Fig. 3a. The reason is that
the range of input transaction rate (10-50 tran/sec) lies within
the processing capacity of the blockchain network (SUT) due
to which more input transactions result in high throughput.
Similarly, the latency of both types of transactions shows a
decrease until the input transaction rate of 40 tran/sec whereas
beyond this point, the latency for query transactions shows
sudden increase as depicted in Fig. 3b. The reason is that
the maximum capacity of transaction processing of query
transactions is reached until 40 tran/sec due to which further
increase causes increase in the latency.
D. Comparison of SM-IIoT with GB-PPABD of [8]
It is evident from the results of Tables III and IV that
the players get maximum payoffs at the equilibrium state of
the game. In the proposed case, the payoff is transparency
on the cost of privacy leakage (i.e., as evident from the
mathematical form of U1 and U2). Therefore, maximum payoff
means high transparency on the cost of less privacy leakage
(i.e., transparency-privacy trade-off). In the proposed scenario
of two blockchain participants (game players p1 and p2), the
transparency-privacy trade-off is evaluated for the proposed
approach SM-IIoT and GB-PPABD of [8]. Here, transparency,
privacy and utility were compared in which transparency for
p1 was calculated using q
z + C2ε2j , privacy was evaluated
as (1-C1ε1i ), and utility was evaluated as (1-average relative
error in the perturbed query responses) by varying the privacy
budget of p2 according to ε2j ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1}. Furthermore, to
represent the transparency in percentage, relative value was
taken which is transparency
maximum transparency
over the range of privacy
budget. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 4.
It is evident from Fig. 4 that the proposed approach has the
same level of utility and privacy as compared to GB-PPABD
in which the utility has increased from 98.71% for ε2 = 0.1
to 99.23% for ε2 = 1. Similarly, the privacy has decreased
from 97% for ε2 = 0.1 to 70% for ε2 = 1. The reason is
that both approaches use differential privacy for perturbation
with Laplace mechanism. However, in terms of transparency,
the proposed SM-IIoT outperforms the GB-PPABD for all
values of ε2 as shown in Fig. 4. The transparency for SM-
IIoT is always higher than GB-PPABD, i.e., zero. The reason
is that SM-IIoT considers the transparency and visibility
of block contents associated with blockchain participants in
the channel. Conversely, GB-PPABD did not consider the
transparency and visibility of block contents in the channel.
Therefore, the transparency value is zero over the range of
privacy budget. Furthermore, the transparency for SM-IIoT
has increased from 85% for ε2 = 0.1 to 100% for ε2 = 1
because increasing the privacy budget ε2 of p2 increases the
chances of p1 to get exact private data of p2. It is also evident
from Fig. 4 that the achieved transparency through SM-IIoT
did not impact the privacy and utility of the system. i.e., the
privacy and utility for SM-IIoT and GB-PPABD are on the
same level.
E. Comparison of SM-IIoT with state-of-the-art mechanisms
In this Section, SM-IIoT is compared with four state-of-
the-art mechanisms which are blockchain empowered collab-
orative architecture for data sharing between multiple par-
ties (BCA-MP) [14], distributed k-means clustering (DKC)

[15], blockchain-based RFID (BC-RFID) [13], and Ethereum
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [16]. All
these mechanisms have adopted blockchain to enable a smart
and secure supply chain model in the context of IIoT. Fur-
thermore, the comparison is performed in terms of six key at-
tributes of the supply chain network which are i) transparency-
privacy trade-off ii) optimal strategy selection ii) competitive
behavior modeling, iv) private data sharing, v) accuracy or
utility of data, and vi) fairness.
The comparison over six key attributes is summarized in Table
V. It is evident from the results that the proposed SM-IIoT
outperforms other state-of-the-art mechanisms. The reason is
that SM-IIoT owns all the required key attributes of the supply
chain network as compared to others. None of the previous
mechanisms possesses all the key attributes of the supply
chain network which witnesses the superiority of the proposed
mechanism SM-IIoT.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we presented a game theoretic approach
to solve the transparency-privacy trade-off problem in
blockchain-based supply chain in the context of IIoT which is
called SM-IIoT. First, a blockchain-based (HF) supply chain
scenario is presented and then the trade-off problem is turned
into a non-cooperative game. The players are considered as
rational in achieving transparency across the supply chain at
the cost of their privacy leakage. Furthermore, it was found
that a pure Nash equilibrium exists in the game which gives the
solution by identifying the maximum payoffs of the players.
The proposed SM-IIoT outperforms the GB-PPABD approach
by considering the transparency along with privacy and utility
of data. Moreover, the comparison with other similar works
revealed that the proposed SM-IIoT owns all the key attributes
of the supply chain.
