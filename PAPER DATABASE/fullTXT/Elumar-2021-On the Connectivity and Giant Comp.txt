On the Connectivity and Giant Component Size of Random K-out
Graphs Under Randomly Deleted Nodes

Abstract— Random K-out graphs, denoted H(n;K), are gen-
erated by each of the n nodes drawing K out-edges towards K
distinct nodes selected uniformly at random, and then ignoring
the orientation of the arcs. Recently, random K-out graphs
have been used in applications as diverse as random (pairwise)
key predistribution in ad-hoc networks, anonymous message
routing in crypto-currency networks, and differentially-private
federated averaging. In many applications, connectivity of the
random K-out graph when some of its nodes are dishonest,
have failed, or have been captured is of practical interest. We
provide a comprehensive set of results on the connectivity and
giant component size of H(n;Kn, γn), i.e., random K-out graph
when γn of its nodes, selected uniformly at random, are deleted.
First, we derive conditions for Kn and n that ensure, with
high probability (whp), the connectivity of the remaining graph
when the number of deleted nodes is γn = Ω(n) and γn = o(n),
respectively. Next, we derive conditions for H(n;Kn, γn) to have
a giant component, i.e., a connected subgraph with Ω(n) nodes,
whp. This is also done for different scalings of γn and upper
bounds are provided for the number of nodes outside the giant
component. Simulation results are presented to validate the
usefulness of the results in the finite node regime.

I. INTRODUCTION
Random graphs are widely used in modeling and analysis
of diverse real-world networks including social networks [1],
economic networks [2], and communication networks [3]. In
recent years, a random graph model known as the random
K-out graph has received interest in designing secure sensor
networks [4], decentralized learning [5], and anonymity pre-
serving crypto-currency networks [6]. Random K-out graphs,
denoted H(n;K), are generated over a set of n nodes as
follows. Each of the n nodes draws K out-edges towards K
distinct nodes selected uniformly at random. The resulting
undirected graph obtained by ignoring the orientation of the
edges is referred to as a random K-out graph.
In the context of sensor networks, random K-out graphs
have been used [4], [7], [8] to analyze the performance
of the random pairwise key predistribution scheme [9] and
its heterogeneous variants [10], [11]. The random pairwise
scheme works as follows. Before deployment, each sensor
chooses K others uniformly at random. A unique pairwise
key is given to each node pair where at least one of
them selected the other. After deployment, two sensors can
securely communicate if they share a pairwise key. The
topology of the sensor network can thus be represented

by a random K-out graph; each edge of the random K-out
represents a secure communication link between two sensors.
Consequently, random K-out graphs have been analyzed
to answer key questions on the values of the parameters
n,K needed to achieve certain desired properties, including
connectivity at the time of deployment [4], [12], connectivity
under link removals [7], [8], and unassailability [13].
Despite many prior works on random K-out graphs, very
little is known about its connectivity properties when some
of its nodes are removed. This is an increasingly relevant
problem since many deployments of sensor networks are ex-
pected to take place in hostile environments where nodes may
be captured by an adversary, or fail due to harsh conditions.
In addition, random K-out graphs have recently been used to
construct the communication graph in a differentially-private
federated averaging scheme called the GOPA (GOssip Noise
for Private Averaging) protocol [5, Algorithm 1]. According
to the GOPA protocol, a random K-out graph is constructed
on a set of nodes of which an unknown subset is dishonest.
It was shown in [5, Theorem 3] that the privacy-utility trade-
offs achieved by the GOPA protocol is tightly dependent on
the subgraph on honest nodes being connected. When the
subgraph on honest nodes is not connected, it was shown that
the performance of GOPA is tied to the size of the connected
components of the honest nodes.
With these motivations in mind, this paper aims to fill
a gap in the literature and provide a comprehensive set of
results on the connectivity and size of the giant component of
the random K-out graph when some of its nodes are dishon-
est, have failed, or have been captured. Let H(n;Kn, γn) de-
note the random K-out graph when γn of its nodes, selected
uniformly at random, are deleted. First, we provide a set of
conditions for Kn and n that ensure, with high probability
(whp), the connectivity of the remaining graph when the
number γn of deleted nodes is Ω(n) and o(n), respectively.
Our result for γn = Ω(n) (see Theorem 3.1) significantly
improves a prior result [14] on the same problem and leads
to a sharp zero-one law for the connectivity of H(n;Kn, γn).
Our result for the case γn = o(n) (see Theorem 3.2) expands
the existing threshold of Kn ≥ 2 required for connectivity
by showing that the graph is still connected whp for Kn ≥ 2
when o(
√
n) nodes are deleted. We then derive conditions on
Kn that leads H(n;Kn, γn) to have a giant component with
an upper bound on the number of nodes allowed outside the
giant component. This is also done for both cases γn = Ω(n)
and γn = o(n). Finally, we present simulation results when
the number of nodes is finite and compare the results with
an Erdős-Rényi graph with same average node degree.

II. NOTATIONS AND THE MODEL
All random variables are defined on the same probability
space (Ω,F ,P) and probabilistic statements are given with
respect to the probability measure P. The complement of an
event A is denoted by Ac. The cardinality of a discrete set
A is denoted by |A|. All limits are understood with n going
to infinity. If the probability of an event tends to one as
n → ∞, we say that it occurs with high probability (whp).
The statements an = o(bn), an = ω(bn), an = O(bn), an =
Θ(bn), and an = Ω(bn), used when comparing the asymp-
totic behavior of sequences {an}, {bn}, have their meaning
in standard Landau notation. The asymptotic equivalence
an ∼ bn is used to denote the fact that limn→∞
an
bn
= 1.
The random K-out graph is defined on the vertex set V :=
{v1, . . . , vn} as follows. Let N := {1, 2, . . . , n} denote the
set vertex labels. For each i ∈ N , let Γn,i ⊆ N \i denote the
set of Kn labels corresponding to the nodes selected by vi.
It is assumed that Γn,1, . . . ,Γn,n are mutually independent.
Distinct nodes vi and vj are adjacent, denoted by vi ∼ vj if
at least one of them picks the other. Namely,
vi ∼ vj if [j ∈ Γn,i] ∨ [i ∈ Γn,j ]. (1)
The random graph defined on the vertex set V through
the adjacency condition (1) is called a random K-out graph
[4], [15], [16] and denoted by H(n;Kn). It was previously
established in [4], [12] that random K-out graph is connected
whp when K ≥ 2 and not connected when K = 1; i.e.,
lim
n→∞
P [H(n;K) is connected] =
{
1 if K ≥ 2,
0 if K = 1.
(2)
Next, we model random K-out graphs under random
removal of nodes. As already mentioned, our motivation
is to understand the properties of the underlying network
when some nodes are dishonest, or have failed, or have been
captured. We let γn denote the number of such nodes and
assume, for simplicity, that they are selected uniformly at
random among all nodes in V . The case where the set of
dishonest/captured/failed nodes are selected carefully by an
adversary might also be of interest, but is beyond of the scope
of the current paper; see [13] for partial results in that case.
A related model of interest is the random K-out graph under
randomly deleted edges. The connectivity and k-connectivity
under that case have been studied in [7], [17], [18].
Formally, let D ⊂ V, |D| = γn denote the set of deleted
nodes. We can then define H(n;Kn, γn) on the vertex set
R = V \D and the corresponding set of labels NR, such that
distinct vertices vi and vj (both in R) are adjacent if they
were adjacent in H(n;Kn); i.e., if [j ∈ Γn,i] ∨ [i ∈ Γn,j ].
For each i ∈ NR, the set of labels adjacent to node vi in
H(n;Kn, γn) is denoted by Γn−γn,i ⊆ NR \ i.
Definition 2.1 (Connected Components): A pair of nodes
in a graph G are said to be connected if there exists a path of
edges connecting them. A component Ci of G is a subgraph
in which any two vertices are connected to each other, and no
vertex is connected to a node outside of Ci.
A graph with n nodes is said to have a giant component
if its largest connected component is of size Ω(n).
III. MAIN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our main results are presented in Theorems 3.1 − 3.4
below. Each Theorem addresses a design question as to how
we should choose the parameter Kn such that when the
given number γn of nodes are deleted, the remaining graph
satisfies the given desired property (e.g., connectivity or a
giant component with a specific size) whp.
A. Results on Connectivity
Let P (n,Kn, γn) = P [H(n;Kn, γn) is connected].
Theorem 3.1: Let γn = αn with α in (0, 1), and consider
a scaling K : N0 → N0 such that with c > 0 we have
Kn ∼ c · r1(α, n), where r1(α, n) =
log n
1− α− logα
(3)
is the threshold function. Then, we have
lim
n→∞
P (n,Kn, γn) =
{
1, if c > 1
0, if 0 < c < 1.
(4)
The proof of the one-law in (4), i.e., that
limn→∞ P (n,Kn, γn) = 1 if c > 1, is given in Section IV.
The zero-law of (4), i.e., that limn→∞ P (n,Kn, γn) = 0
if c < 1, was established previously in [14, Corollary 3.3].
There, a one-law was also provided: under (3), it was
shown that limn→∞ P (n,Kn, γn) if c > 1
1−α , leaving a
gap between the thresholds of the zero-law and the one-law.
Theorem 3.1 presented here fills this gap by establishing a
tighter one-law, and constitutes a sharp zero-one law; e.g.,
when α = 0.5, the one-law in [14] is given with c > 2,
while we show that it suffices to have c > 1.
Theorem 3.2: Consider a scaling K : N0 → N0.
a) If γn = o(
√
n), then we have
lim
n→∞
P (n,Kn, γn) = 1, if Kn ≥ 2 ∀n (5)
b) If γn = Ω(
√
n) and γn = o(n), and if for some sequence
wn, it holds that
Kn = r2(γn) + ωn, where r2(γn) =
log(γn)
log 2 + 1/2
is the threshold function, then we have
lim
n→∞
P (n,Kn, γn) = 1, if lim
n→∞
ωn =∞ (6)
Random K-out graph was known [4], [12] to be connected
whp when Kn ≥ 2 (viz. (2)). Theorem 3.2 extends this result
by showing that Kn ≥ 2 is sufficient to have the random K-
out graph remain connected whp when o(
√
n) of its nodes
(selected randomly) are deleted.
B. Results on the Size of the Giant Component
Let Cmax(n,Kn, γn) denote the set of nodes in the
largest connected component of H(n;Kn, γn) and let
PG(n,Kn, γn, λn) := P[|Cmax(n,Kn, γn)| > n−γn−λn].
Namely, PG(n,Kn, γn, λn) is the probability that less than
λn nodes are outside the largest component of H(n;Kn, γn).

Theorem 3.3: Let γn = o(n), λn = Ω(
√
n) and λn ≤
b(n− γn)/3c. Consider a scaling K : N0 → N0 and let
r3(γn, λn) = 1 +
log(1 + γn/λn)
log 2 + 1/2
be the threshold function. Then, we have
lim
n→∞
PG(n,Kn, γn, λn) = 1, if Kn > r3(γn, λn), ∀n.
We remark that if λn = βn with 0 < β < 1/3, then
r3(γn, λn) = 1 + o(1). This shows that when γn = o(n),
it suffices to have Kn ≥ 2 for H(n;Kn, γn) to have a
giant component containing Ω((1−β)n) nodes for arbitrary
0 < β < 1/3.
Theorem 3.4: Let γn = αn with α in (0, 1), λn = o(n),
and λn = ω(1). Consider a scaling K : N0 → N0 and let
r4(α, λn) = 1 +
log(1 + nα
λn
) + α+ log(1− α)
1−α
2 − log
(
1+α
2
)
be the threshold function. Then, we have
lim
n→∞
PG(n,Kn, α, λ) = 1, if Kn > r4(α, xn), ∀n.
Due to space limitations, we only provide a proof of
Theorem 3.1 here. Proofs of all results are available in [19].
C. Simulation Results
To check the usefulness of our results when the number n
of nodes is finite, we examine the probability of connectivity
and the number of nodes outside the giant component (i.e.,
n − γn − |Cmax(n,Kn, γn)|) in two different experimental
setups. The first setup is to obtain the results for the case
where γn = αn, with α in (0, 1). We generate instantiations
of the random graph H(n;Kn, γn) with n = 5000, varying
Kn in the interval [1, 25] and several α values in the
interval [0.1, 0.8]. Then, we record the empirical probability
of connectivity and λn from 1000 independent experiments
for each (Kn, α) pair. The results of this experiment are
shown in Fig. 1 (Left) and Fig. 2.
Fig. 1 (Left) depicts the empirical probability of con-
nectivity of H(n;Kn, γn). The vertical lines stand for the
critical threshold of connectivity asserted by Theorem 3.1.
In each curve, P (n,Kn, γn) exhibits a threshold behaviour
as Kn increases, and the transition from P (n,Kn, γn) = 0
to P (n,Kn, γn) = 1 takes place around Kn = logn
1−α−logα ,
validating the claims of Theorem 3.1.
In Fig. 2, we plot the maximum number of nodes outside
the giant component observed in 1000 experiments for each
parameter pair, and compare these with our result, namely
the upper bound on n−γn−|Cmax| obtained from Theorem
3.4 by taking the maximum γn value that gives a threshold
less than or equal to the Kn value tested in the simulation.
As can be seen, for any Kn and γn value, the experimental
maximum number of nodes outside the giant component is
smaller than the upper bound obtained from Theorem 3.4,
reinforcing the usefulness of our results in practical settings.
We ran a second set of experiments for the case where
γn = o(n). As before, we generate instantiations of the

5000 calculated from 1000 experiments. The vertical lines are the theoretical
thresholds given by Theorem 3.1. (Right) Maximum number of nodes outside

H(n;Kn, γn) for n = 5000 and γn = 0.1n, γn = 0.2n cases (Left); and
for n = 5000 and γn = 0.4n, γn = 0.6n cases (Right), obtained through
1000 experiments along with respective plot of theoretical n−γn−|Cmax|.

H(n;Kn, γn) for n = 50, 000 and γn = 10 cases (Left); and for for n =

along with the plot of theoretical n− γn − |Cmax|.

component of a random K-out graph H(n;Kn, γn) and an Erdős-Rényi
graph with same mean node degree when n = 5000, γn = 0.4n (Left);
and when n = 50, 000 and γn = 500 (Right). Each data-point is obtained
through 1000 experiments.
random graph H(n;Kn, γn), with n = 50, 000, varying Kn
in [2, 5] and varying λn in [10, 2000]. For each (Kn, γn)
pair, we generate 1000 experiments and record the maximum
number of nodes seen outside the giant component; in
some case no nodes are seen outside the giant component
indicating that the graph is connected. The results of this
experiment are shown in Fig. 1 (Right) and Fig. 3.
In Fig. 1 (Right), the maximum number of nodes seen
outside the giant component in 1000 experiments is depicted
as a function of Kn. The plots for γn = 10 and γn = 100
correspond to the γn = o(
√
n) case in Theorem 3.2a. As can
be seen, there is only one node outside the giant component
in the worst case for γn = 10 and γn = 100 when Kn = 2,
2574

roughly in line with Theorem 3.2a which expects the graph
to be connected. The plots for γn = 1000 and γn = 2000
correspond to the γn = w(
√
n) and γn = o(n) case in
Theorem 3.2b. The thresholds on Kn for these γn values,
obtained using Theorem 3.2b are r2(1000) = 6.79 and
r2(2000) = 7.37, rounded to two digits after decimal when
the ω(1) term in Theorem 3.2b is ignored due to n having
a finite value in the simulations. As can be seen, the graph
becomes connected for γn = 1000 when Kn ≥ 4, and for
γn = 2000 when Kn ≥ 5. Hence, we can see that graphs
for γn = 1000 and γn = 2000 are connected when Kn is
selected above the theoretical threshold obtained from 3.2b,
supporting Theorem 3.2b.
In Fig. 3, the maximum number of nodes seen outside the
giant component in 1000 experiments is plotted as a function
of Kn. The corresponding theoretical plots are obtained by
the upper bound on n − γn − |Cmax| asserted by Theorem
3.3. For any Kn and γn pair, the experimental values are
smaller than the theoretical values, supporting the usefulness
of Theorem 3.3 in the finite node regime.
D. Discussion
In Theorem 3.1, we improve the results given in [14] by
using tighter upper bounds on the probability of not being
connected. With this, we close the gap between the zero law
and the one law, and hence establish a sharp zero-one law
for connectivity when γn = Ω(n) nodes are deleted from
H(n;Kn, γn).
In Theorem 3.2, we establish that the graph H(n;Kn, γn)
with γn = o(n) is connected whp when Kn ∼ log(γn); and
when γn = o(
√
n), Kn ≥ 2 is sufficient for connectivity.
The latter result is especially important, since Kn ≥ 2 is
the previously established threshold for connectivity [12],
we improve this result by showing that the graph is still
connected with Kn ≥ 2 even after o(
√
n) nodes (selected
randomly) are deleted. We also note that Theorem 3.3 and
3.4 constitute the first results concerning the giant component
size of random K-out graphs under randomly deleted nodes.
To put these results in perspective, we compare them with
an Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p), which is connected whp if
p > log n/n. This translates to having an average node
degree of < k >∼ log n [20]. The < k > required for the
random K-out graph to be connected whp is much lower,
with < k >= O(1) when o(
√
n) nodes are removed, and
< k >∼ log(γn) when γn = Ω(
√
n) nodes are removed.
For a better comparison, we examine the experimental
maximum number of nodes outside the giant component out
of 1000 experiments of a random K-out graph H(n;Kn, γn)
and an Erdős-Rényi graph G(n, p) with same mean node
degree when γn random nodes are removed from the graph.
Since these graphs are defined using different parameters (p
for Erdős-Rényi and K for random K-out), to achieve the
same node degree, p in the Erdős-Rényi graph is selected as
p = 2Kn/n. The results are given in Fig. 4 for n = 5000,
γn = 0.4n on (Left), and n = 50, 000, γn = 500 on (Right).
As can be seen, the random K-out graph has less maximum
number of nodes outside the giant component than the
Erdős-Rényi graph and this difference is more pronounced
when γn is smaller. From these plots for the finite node
regime, and also comparing the Theorems given in our paper
with the relevant literature on ER graphs, we can conclude
that random K-out graphs are more robust to random node
removals than Erdős-Rényi graphs in the sense of probability
of connectivity and size of the giant component being larger.
This reinforces the efficiency of the K-out construction in
various distributed network applications including federated
averaging [5], [21] where it is desirable to maintain connec-
tivity in the event of node failures or adversarial capture of
nodes.
IV. A PROOF OF THEOREM 3.1
We start by defining a cut.
Definition 4.1 (Cut): [22, Definition 6.3] For a graph G
defined on the node set V , a cut is a non-empty subset S ⊂ V
of nodes isolated from the rest of the graph. Namely, S ⊂ V
is a cut if there is no edge between S and Sc = V \ S.
Definition 4.1 implies that if S is a cut, then so is Sc.
Recall from Section II that we defined H(n;Kn, γn) as the
graph when the set D of nodes is removed from the graph
H(n;Kn). Namely, the vertex set of H(n;Kn, γn) is given
by R = V \ D. Let En(Kn, γn;S) denote the event that
S ⊂ R is a cut in H(n;Kn, γn) as per Definition 4.1. With
Sc = R/S, the event En(Kn, γn;S) occurs if no nodes in
S pick neighbors in Sc, and no nodes in Sc pick neighbors
in S. Note that nodes in S or Sc can still pick neighbors in
the set D. Thus, with NS , NSc denoting the set of labels of
the vertices in S and Sc, respectively, we have
En(Kn,γn;S) =
⋂
i∈NS
⋂
j∈NSc
({i /∈ Γn−γn,j}∩ {j /∈ Γn−γn,i})
Let Z(xn;Kn, γn) denote the event that H(n;Kn, γn) has
no cut S ⊂ R with size xn ≤ |S| ≤ n − γn − xn where
x : N0 → N0 is a sequence such that xn ≤ (n− γn)/2 ∀n.
Namely, Z(xn;Kn, γn) is the event that there are no cuts in
H(n;Kn, γn) whose size falls in the range [xn, n−γn−xn].
Lemma 4.2: [11, Lemma 4.3] For any sequence x : N0 →
N0 such that xn ≤ b(n− γn)/3c for all n, we have
Z(xn;Kn, γn)⇒ |Cmax(n,Kn, γn)| > n− γn − xn. (7)
Lemma 4.2 states that if the event Z(xn;Kn, γn) holds, then
the size of the largest connected component of H(n;Kn, γn)
is greater than n−γn−xn; i.e., there are less than xn nodes
outside of the giant component of H(n;Kn, γn). Hence, we
can see that H(n;Kn, γn) is connected if Z(xn;Kn, γn)
takes place with xn = 1. Thus, the one-law will be estab-
lished if we show that limn→∞ P[Z(xn;Kn, γn)c] = 0 with
xn = 1. From the definition of Z(xn;Kn, γn), we have
Z(xn;Kn, γn) =
⋂
S∈Pn: xn≤|S|≤bn−γ
2 c
(En(Kn, γn;S))

where Pn is the collection of all non-empty subsets of R.
Complementing both sides and using union bound, we get

where Pn,r denotes the collection of all subsets of R
with exactly r elements. For each r = 1, . . . , b(n− γ)/2c,
we can simplify the notation by denoting En,r(Kn, γn) =
En(Kn, γn; {v1, . . . , vr}). From the exchangeability of the
node labels and associated random variables, we have
P[En(Kn, γn;S)] = P[En,r(Kn, γn)], S ∈ Pn,r.
|Pn,r| =

Remember that En,r(Kn, γn) is the event that the n−γn−r
nodes in S and r nodes in Sc do not pick each other; but
they can pick from the γn nodes from D. Thus, we have
P[En,r(Kn, γn)] =

Letting PZ = P [Z(1;Kn, γn)c], xn = 1 and γn = αn with
0 < α < 1 in (9), and using the standard bounds
(

≤
(nek )k and 1− x ≤ e−x, we get

We will show that the right side of the above expression goes
to zero as n goes to infinity. Let

We write
PZ ≤

An,r,α +

r=bn/ lognc
An,r,α := Q1 +Q2,
and show that both Q1 and Q2 go to zero as n → ∞. We
start with the first summation Q1.
Q1 ≤

Next, assume as in the statement of Theorem 3.1 that
Kn =
cn log n
1− α− logα
, n = 1, 2, . . . (10)
for some sequence c : N0 → R+ such that limn→∞ cn = c
with c > 1. Also define
an := (1− α)en · eKn log(α+ 1
logn )−Kn(1−α− 1
logn )
= (1− α)en · e−cn logn
1−α−log(α+ 1

1−α−logα

logn log(1+ 1
α logn
)+1
1−α−logα = O(1)n1−cn
where we substituted Kn via (10) and used the fact that
log n · log(1 + 1
α logn ) ≤ 1
α . Taking the limit as n → ∞
and recalling that limn→∞ cn = c > 1, we see that
limn→∞ an = 0. Hence, for large n, we have
Q1 ≤
bn/ lognc∑
r=1
(an)
r ≤

r=1
(an)
r

1− an
(11)
where the geometric sum converges since limn→∞ an = 0.
Using this once again, it is clear from the last expression
that limn→∞Q1 = 0. Now, similarly consider Q2.
Q2 ≤
b(n−αn)/2c∑
r=bn/ lognc
(
(1− α)e log n · eKn log( 1+α
2 )−Kn 1−α
2
)r
Next, we define
bn := (1− α)e log n · e−Kn( 1−α
2 −log(
1+α
2 )) (12)
Substituting for Kn via (10) and taking the limit as n→∞
it can be seen that limn→∞ bn = 0 upon noting that 1−α
2 −
log( 1+α
2 ) > 0 and limn→∞ cn = c > 1. With arguments
similar to those used in the case of Q1, we can show that
when n is large Q2 ≤ bn/(1−bn), leading to Q2 converging
to zero as n gets large. With PZ ≤ Q1 + Q2, and both Q1
and Q2 converging to zero when n is large, we establish that
PZ converges to zero as n goes to infinity. This result also
yields the desired conclusion limn→∞ P (n,Kn, γn) = 1 in
Theorem 3.1 since PZ = 1−P (n,Kn, γn). We direct readers
to [19] for proof of other Theorems presented in Section III.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive set of results on
the connectivity and giant component size of H(n;Kn, γn),
i.e., random K-out graph with randomly selected γn nodes
deleted. Computer simulations are used to validate the results
in the finite node regime. Using our results, we compare
random K-out graphs with Erdős-Rényi graphs with the
same mean node degree and same number of deleted nodes,
and show that random K-out graphs are either connected
with higher probability or have a larger giant component.
This reinforces the usefulness of random K-out graphs in
various distributed network applications including federated
averaging [5], [21]. Our results can help design networks
with desired levels of robustness or tolerance to nodes failing,
being captured, or being dishonest in many applications
including wireless sensor networks and distributed averaging.
