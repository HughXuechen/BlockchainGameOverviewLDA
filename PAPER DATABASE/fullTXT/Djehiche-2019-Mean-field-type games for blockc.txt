Abstract. In this paper we examine mean-field-type games in
blockchain-based distributed power networks with several different enti-
ties: investors, consumers, prosumers, producers and miners. Under
a simple model of jump-diffusion and regime switching processes, we
identify risk-aware mean-field-type optimal strategies for the decision-
makers.

1 Introduction
This paper introduces mean-field-type games for blockchain-based smart energy
systems. The cryptocurrency system consists in a peer to peer electronic payment
platform in which the transactions are made without the need of a centralized
entity in charge of authorizing them. Therefore, the aforementioned transac-
tions are validated/verified by means of a coded scheme called blockchain [1].
In addition, the blockchain is maintained by its participants, which are called
miners.
Blockchain or distributed ledger technology is an emerging technology for
peer-to-peer transaction platforms that uses decentralized storage to record all
transaction data [2]. One of the first blockchain applications was developed in
the e-commerce sector to serve as the basis for the cryptocurrency “Bitcoin”
[3]. Since then, several other altcoins and cryptocurrencies including Ethereum,
Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, Solarcoin, Bitshare etc have been widely adopted and
are all based on blockchain. More and more new applications have recently been
emerging that add to the technology’s core functionality - decentralized stor-
age of transaction data - by integrating mechanisms that allow for the actual
transactions to be implemented on a decentralized basis. The lack of a central-
ized entity, that could have control over the security of transactions, requires

the development of a sophisticated verification procedure to validate transac-
tions. Such task is known as Proof-of-Work, which brings new technological and
algorithmic challenges as presented in [4]. For instance, [5] discusses the sus-
tainability of bitcoin and blockchain in terms of the needed energy in order to
perform the verification procedure. In [6], algorithms to validate transactions
are studied by considering propagation delays. On the other hand, alternative
directions are explored in order to enhance the blockchain, e.g., [7] discusses how
the blockchain-based identity and access management systems can be improved
by using an Internet of Things security approach.
In this paper the possibility of implementing distributed power networks on
the blockchain and its pros and contras are presented. The core model (Fig. 1)
uses a Bayesian mean-field-type game theory on the blockchain. The base inter-
action model considers producers, consumers and a new important element of
distributed power networks called prosumers. A prosumer (producer-consumer)
is a user that not only consumes electricity, but can also produce and store elec-
tricity [8,9]. We identify and formulate the key interactions between consumers,
prosumers and producers on the blockchain. Based on forecasted demand gen-
erated from the blockchain, each producer determines its production quantity,
its mismatch cost, and engages an auction mechanism to the prosumer market
on the blockchain. The resulting supply is completed by the prosumers auc-
tion market. This determines a market price, and the consumers react to the
offers and the price and generate a certain demand. The consistency relation-
ship between demand and supply provides a fixed-point system, whose solution
is a mean-field-type equilibrium [10].
The rest of paper is organized as follows. The next subsection presents
the emergence of decentralized platform. Section 3 focuses on the game model.
Section 4 presents risk-awareness and price stability analysis. Section 5 focuses
on consumption-insurance and investment tradeoffs.
2 Towards a Decentralized Platform
The distributed ledger technology is a peer-to-peer transaction platform that
integrates mechanisms that allow decentralized transactions or decentralized and
distributed exchange system. These mechanisms, called “smart contracts”, oper-
ate on the basis of individually defined rules (e.g. specifications as to quantity,
quality, price, location) that enable an autonomous matching of distributed pro-
ducers and their prospective customers. Recently the energy sector is also moving
towards a semi-decentralized platform with the integration of prosumers’ market
and aggregators to the power grid. Distributed power is a power generated at
or near the point of use. This includes technologies that supply both electric
power and mechanical power. In electrical applications, distributed power sys-
tems stand in contrast to central power stations that supply electricity from a
centralized location, often far from users. The rise of distributed power is being
driven by broader decentralization movement of smarter cities. With blockchain
transaction, every participant in a network can transact directly with every other
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 47
network participant without involving a third-party intermediary (aggregator,
operator). In other words, aggregators and the third parties are replaced by the
blockchain. All transaction data is stored on a distributed blockchain, with all
relevant information being stored identically on the computers of all partici-
pants, all transactions are made on the basis of smart contracts, i.e., based on
predefined individual rules concerning quality, price, quantity, location, feasibil-
ity etc.
2.1 A Blockchain for Underserved Areas
One of the first questions that rises in blockchain is the service to Society. An
authentication service offering to make environment-friendly (solar/wind/hydro)
energy certificates available via a blockchain. The new service works by connect-
ing solar panels and wind farms to an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled device
that measures the quality (of the infrastructure), quantity and the location of
the power produced and fed into the grid. Certificates supporting PV growth
and wind power can be bought and sold anonymously via a blockchain platform.
Then, solar and wind energy produced by prosumers in undeserved areas can
be transmitted to end-users. SolarCoin [11] was developed following that idea,
with blockchain technology to generate an additional reward for solar electricity
producers. Solar installation owners registering to the SolarCoin network receive
one SolarCoin for each MWh of solar electricity that they produce. This dig-
ital asset will allow solar electricity producers to receive an additional reward
for their contribution to the energy transition, which will develop itself through
network effect. SolarCoin is freely distributed to any owner of a solar installa-
tion owner. Participating in the SolarCoin program can be done online, directly
on the SolarCoin website. As of October 2017, more than 2,134,893 MWh of
solar energy have been incentivized through SolarCoin across 44 countries. The
ElectriCChain aims to provide the bulk of Blockchain recording for the solar
installation owners in order to micro-finance the solar installation, incentivize
it (through the SolarCoin tool), and monitor the install production. The idea
of Wattcoin is to build this scheme for other renewable energies such as wind,
thermo, hydro power plants to incentivize global electricity generation from sev-
eral renewable energy sources. The incentive scheme influences the prosumers
decision because they will be rewarded in WattCoins as an additional incentive
to initiate the energy transition and possibly to compensate a fraction of the
peak-hours energy demand.
2.2 Security, Energy Theft and Regulation Issues
If fully adopted, blockchain-based distributed power networks (b-DIPONET) is
not without challenge. One of the challenges is security. This includes not only
network security but also robustness, double spending and false/fake accounts.
Stokens are regulated securities tokens built on the blockchain using smart con-
tracts. They provide a way for accredited investors to interact with regulated
48 B. Djehiche et al.
companies through a digital ecosystem. Currently, the cryptocurrency industry
has enormous potential - but it needs to be accompanied properly.
The blockchain technology can be used to reduce energy theft and unpaid
bills by means of the automation of the prosumers who are connected to the
power grid and their produced energy data is monitored in the network.
3 Mean-Field-Type Game Analysis
Fig. 1. Interaction blocks for blockchain-based distributed power networks.
This section presents the base mean-field-type game model. We identify and
formulate the key interactions between consumers, prosumers and producers
(see Fig. 1). Based on the forecasted demand from the blockchain-based history
matching, each prosumer determines its production quantity, its mismatch cost,
and use the blockchain to respond directly to consumers. All the energy produc-
ers together are engaged in a competitive energy market share. The resulting
supply is completed by the prosumers energy market. This determines a mar-
ket price, and the consumers react to the price and generate a demand. The
consistency relationship between demand and supply of the three components
provides a fixed-point system, whose solution is a mean-field equilibrium.
3.1 The Game Setup
Consumer i can decide to install a solar panel on her roof or a wind power
station. Depending on sunlight or wind speed consumer i may produce surplus
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 49
energy. She is no longer just an energy consumer but a prosumer. A prosumer
can decide to participate or not to the blockchain. If the prosumer decides to
participate to the blockchain to sell her surplus energy, the energy produced by
this prosumer is measured by a dedicated meter which is connected and linked
to the blockchain. The measurement and the validation is done ex-post from
the quality-of-experience of the consumers of prosumer i. The characteristics
and the bidding price of the energy produced by the prosumer are registered
in the blockchain. This allows to give a certain score or Wattcoin to that pro-
sumer for incentivization and participation level. This data is public if in the
public blockchain’s distributed register. All the transactions are verified and val-
idated by the users of the blockchain ex-post. If the energy transaction does not
happen in the blockchain platform, the proof-of-validation is simply an ex-post
quality-experience measurement and therefore it does not need to use the heavy
proof-of-work used by some crypto-currencies. The adoption of energy trans-
actions to be blockchain requires a significantly reduction of the energy con-
sumption of the proof-of-work itself. If the proof-of-work is energy consuming
(and costly) then the energy transactions is kept to the traditional channel and
only proof-of-validation is used as a recommendation system to monitor and to
incentivize the prosumers. The blockchain technology makes it public and more
transparent. If j and k are neighbors of the location of where i produced the
energy, j and k can buy electricity off him and the consumption needs recorded
in the blockchain ex-post. The transactions need to be technically secure and
automated. Once prosumer i reaches a total of 1 MWh of energy sold to its
neighbors, consumer i gets an equivalent of a certain unit of blockchain cryp-
tocurrency such as Wattcoin, WindCoin, Solarcoin etc. It is an extra reward
to the revenue of the prosumer. This scheme incentivizes prosumers to partic-
ipate and promotes environment-friendly energy. Instead of a digitally mined
product (transaction), the WattCoin proof-of-validity happens in the physical
world, and those who have wind/thermo/photovoltaic arrays can earn Wattcoin
just for generating electricity and serving it successfully. It is essentially a global
rewarding/loyalty program, and is designed to help incentivize more renewable
electricity production, while also serving as a lower-carbon cryptocurrency than
Bitcoin and similar alternative currencies.
Each entity can
• Purchase and supply energy and have automated and verifiable proof of the
amounts of green energy purchased/supplied via the information stored on
the blockchain.
• Ensure that local generation (and feasibility) is supported, as it becomes pos-
sible to track the exact geographical origin of each energy MWh produced.
For example, it becomes possible to pay additional premiums for green energy
if it is generated locally, to promote further local energy generation capac-
ity. Since the incentive reward is received only ex-post by the prosumer after
checking the quality-of-experience, the proof-of-validity will improve the fea-
sibility status of the energy supply and demand.
50 B. Djehiche et al.
• Spatial energy price (price field) is publicly available to the consumers and
prosumers who would like to purchase. This includes production cost and
migration/distribution fee for moving energy from its point of production to
its point of use.
• Each producer can supply energy on the platform and make smart contract
for the delivery.
• Miners can decide to mine environment-friendly energy blocks. Honest miners
are entities or people who validate the proof-of-work or proof-of-stakes (or
other scheme). This can be individual, a pool or a coalition. There should be
an incentive for them to mine. Selfish miners are those who may aim to pool
their effort to maximize their own-interest. This can be individual, a pool
or a coalition. Deviators or Malicious miners are entities or people who buy
tokens for market and vote to impose their version of blockchain (different
assigns at different block).
The game is described by the following four key elements:
• Platform: A Blockchain
• Players: Investors, consumers, prosumers, producers, miners.
• Decisions: Each player can decide and act via the blockchain.
• Outcomes: The outcome is given by gain minus loss for each participant.
Note that in this model, there is no energy trading option on the blockchain.
However, the model can be modified to include trading at some part of the
private blockchain. The electricity price dynamics regulation and stability will
be discussed below.
3.2 Analysis
How can blockchain improve the penetration rate of renewable
energy?
Thanks to the blockchain-based incentive, a non-negligible portion of prosumers
will participate to the program. This will increase the produced renewable energy
volumes. A basic rewarding scheme is that simple and easy to implement is a
Tullock-like scheme, where probabilities to win a winner-take-all contest are con-
sidered, defining some constest success functions [12–14]. It consists of taking a
spatial rewarding scheme to be added to the prosumers if a certain number
of criteria are satisfied. In terms of incentives, a prosumer producing energy
from location x will be rewarded ex-post R(x) with probability hj(x,aj)∑n
i=1 hi(x,ai)
if
∑n
i=1 hi(x, ai) > R(x) > 0, where hi is non-decreasing in its second component.
Clearly, with this incentive scheme, a non-negligible portion of producers can
reinvest more funds in the renewable energy production.
Implementation Cost
We identify basic costs for the blockchain-based energy system need to be imple-
mented properly with largest coverage. As the next generation wireless com-
munication and internet-of-everything is moving toward advanced devices with
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 51
high-speed, well-connected and more security and reliability than the previous
version, blockchain technology should take advantage of it to decentralized oper-
ation. The wireless communication devices can be used as hotspots to connect
to the blockchain as mobile calls are using wireless access points and hotspots as
relays. Thus, a large coverage of the technology as related to the wireless cover-
age and connectivity of the location. Thus, the cost is reflected to the consumers
and to the producers from their internet subscription fees. In addition to that
cost, miners operations consume energy and powers. Supercomputers (CPUs,
GPUs) and operating machines cost should be added to.
Demand-Supply Mismatch Cost
Let T := [t0, t1] be the time horizon with t0 < t1. In presence of blockchain,
prosumers aim to anticipate their production strategies by solving the following

• The stock of energy ejk(t) of prosumer j at power plant k at time t is given
by the following classical motion dynamics:
d
dt
ejk(t) = incoming flowjk(t) − outgoing flowjk(t), (2)
The incoming flow happens only when the power station is active. In that
case, the arrival rate is xjk(t)1l{k∈Aj(t)} where xjk(t) ≥ 0, and the set of
active power plant of j is defined by Aj(t), the set of all active power plants
is A(t) = ∪jAj(t). D(t) is the demand on the blockchain at time t.
In general, the demand needs to be anticipated/estimated/predicted so that the
produced quantity is enough to serve the consumers. If the supply S is less than
52 B. Djehiche et al.
D some of the consumers will not be served, hence it is costly for the operator.
If the supply S is greater that D then the operator needs to store the exceed
amount of energy. It will be lost if the storage is enough. Thus, it is costly in both
cases, and the cost is represented by l(·,D − S). The demand-supply mismatch
cost is determined by solving (1).
3.3 Oligopoly with Incomplete Information
There are n ≥ 2 potential interacting energy producers over the horizon T . At
time t ∈ T , producer i’s output is ui(t) ≥ 0. The dynamics of the log-price,
p(t) := logarithm of the price of energy at time t, is given by p(t0) = p0 and

where
D(t) :=

ui(t),
is the supply at time t ∈ T , and Bo is standard Brownian motion representing
a global uncertainty observed by all participant to the market. The processes B
and N describe local uncertainties or noises. B is a standard Brownian motion,
N is a jump process with Lévy measure ν(dθ) defined over Θ. It is assumed
that ν is a Radon measure over Θ (the jump space) which is subset of Rm. The
process
Ñ(dt,dθ) = N(dt,dθ) − ν(dθ)dt
is the compensated martingale. We assume that all these processes are mutually
independent. Denote by FB,N,Bo
t the natural filtration generated by the union
of events {B,N,Bo} up to time t, and by (FBo
t , t ∈ T ) the natural filtration
generated by the observed common noise, where FBo
t = σ(B0(s), s ≤ t) is the
smallest σ-field generated by the process B0 up to time t (see e.g. [15]).
The number η is positive. For larger values of the real number η the market
price adjusts quicker along the inverse demand, all in the logarithmic scale.
The terms a, σ, σo are fixed constant parameters. The jump rate size μ(·) is in
L2
ν(Θ,R) i.e. ∫

μ2(θ)ν(dθ) < +∞.
The initial distribution of p(0) is square integrable: E[p20] < ∞.
Producers know only their own types (ci, ri, r̄i) but not the types of the others
(cj , rj , r̄j)j �=i. We define a game with incomplete information denoted by Gξ. The
game Gξ has n producers. A strategy for producer j is a map ũj : Ij → Uj
prescribing an action for each possible type of producer j. We denote the set of
actions of producer j by Ũj . Let ξj denote the distribution on the type vector
(cj , rj , r̄j) from the perspective of the jth producer. Given ξj , producer j can
compute the conditional distribution ξ−j(c−j , r−j , r̄−j |cj , rj , r̄j), where
c−j = (c1, . . . , cj−1, cj+1, . . . , cn) ∈ R
n−1.

Producer j can then evaluate her expected payoff based on the expected types
of other producers. We call a Nash equilibrium of Gξ Bayesian equilibrium as.
At time t ∈ T , producer i receives p̂(t)ui − Ci(ui) where Ci : R → R, given
by
Ci(ui) = ciui +

is the instant cost function of i. The term ûi = E[ui | FBo
t ] is the conditional
expectation of producer i’s output given the global uncertainty Bo observed in
the market. The last term 1

i , in the expression of the instant cost Ci, aims
to capture the risk-sensitivity of producer i. The conditional expectation of the
price given the global uncertainty Bo up to time t is p̂(t) = E[p(t) | FBo
t ]. At the
terminal time t1 the revenue is − q

where λi is a discount factor of producer i. Finally, each producer optimizes her
long-term expected revenue. The case of deterministic complete information was
investigated in [16,17]. Extension of the complete information to the stochastic
case with mean-field term was done recently in [18]. Below, we investigate the
equilibrium solution under incomplete information.
3.3.1 Bayesian Mean-Field-Type Equilibria
A Bayesian-Nash Mean-Field-Type Equilibrium is defined as a strategy profile
and beliefs specified for each producer about the types of the other producers
that minimizes the expected performance functional for each producer given
their beliefs about the other producers’ types and given the strategies played by
the other producers. We compute the generic expression of the Bayesian mean-
field-type equilibria.

The proof of the Bayesian Riccati system follows from a Direct Method by
conditioning on the type (ci, ri, r̄i, ξ).
Noting that the Riccati system of the Bayesian mean-field-type game is differ-
ent from the Riccati system of mean-field-type game, it follows that the Bayesian
equilibrium costs are different. They become equal when ξ−j = δ(c−j ,r−j ,r̄−j).
This also shows that there is a value of information in this game. Note that the

3.3.2 Ex-Post Resilience
Definition 1. We define a strategy profile ũ as ex-post resilient if for every type
profile (cj , rj , r̄j)j , and for each producer i,
argmaxũi∈Ũ i
E
∫
Ri,T (p0, ci, , ri, r̄i, ũi, ũ−i)ξ−i(dc−idr−idr̄−i | ci, ri, r̄i)
= argmaxũi∈Ũ i
ERi,T (p0, ũi, ũ−i).
We show that generically the Bayesian equilibrium is not ex-post resilient. An
n−tuple of strategies is said to be ex-post resilient if each producer’s strategy is
a best response to the other producers’ strategies, under all possible realizations
of the others’ types. An ex-post resilient strategy must be an equilibrium of every
game with the realized type profile (c, r, r̄). Thus, any ex-post resilient strategy
is a robust strategy of the game in which all the parameters (c, r, r̄) are taken.
Here, each producer makes her ex-ante decision based on ex-ante information,
that is, distribution and expectation, which is not necessarily identical to her
ex-post information, that is, the realized actions and types of other producers.
Thus, ex-post, or after the producer observes the actually produced quantities
of energy of all the other producers, she may prefer to alter her ex-ante optimal
production decision.
4 Price Stability and Risk-Awareness
This section examines the price stability of a stylized blockchain-based market
under regulation designs. As a first step we design a target price dynamics that
allows a high volume of transactions while fulfilling the regulation requirement.
However, the target price is not the market price. In a second step, we propose
and examine a simple price market dynamics under jump-diffusion process. The
market price model builds on the market demand, supply and token quantity.
We use three different token supply strategies to evaluate the proposed market
price motion. The first strategy designs a supply of tokens to the market more
frequently balancing the mismatch between market supply and market demand.
The second strategy is a mean-field control strategy. The third strategy is a
mean-field-type control strategy that incorporates the risk of deviating from the
regulation bounds.
4.1 Unstable and High Variance Market
As an illustration of high variance price, we take the fluctuations of bitcoin
price between December 2017 and February 2018. The data is from coindesk
(https://www.coindesk.com/price/). The price went from 10 K USD to 20 K
USD and back to 7 K USD within 3 months. The variance was extremely high
within that period, which implied very high risks in the market (Fig. 1). This
extremely high variance and unstable market is far beyond the risk-sensitivity
index distributions of users and investors. Therefore the market needs to be
re-designed to fit investors and users risk-sensitivity distributions.

Fig. 2. Coindesk database: the price of bitcoin went from 10K USD to 20 K USD and
back to below 7 K USD within 2–3 months in 2017–2018.
4.2 Fully Stable and Zero Variance
We have seen that the above example is too risky and is beyond the risk-
sensitivity index of the many users. Thus, it is important to have a more stable
market price in the blockchain.
A fully stable situation is the case of constant price. For that case the variance
is zero and there is no risk on that market. However, this case may not be
interesting for producers, and investors: if they know that the price will not vary
they will not buy. Thus, the volume of transactions will be significantly reduced
which is not convenient for the blockchain technology which aims to be a place
of innovations and investments.
Electricity market price cannot be constant because demand is variable on
a daily basis or from one season to another within the same year. Peak hours
price may be different from off-peak hours price as it is already the case in most
countries.
Below we propose a price dynamics that is somehow in between the two
scenarios: it is of relatively low variance and it allows several transaction oppor-
tunities.
4.3 What Is a More Stable Price Dynamics?
An example of a more stable cryptocurrency within similar time frame as the
bitcoin is the tether USD (USDT) which oscillates between 0.99 and 1.01 but
with an important volume of transactions (see Fig. 2). The maximum magnitude
variation of the price remains very small while the number oscillations in between
is large, allowing several investment, buying/selling opportunities (Fig. 3).
Is token supply possible in the blockchain?
Tokens in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are generated by blockchain algo-
rithms. Token supply is a decision process that can be incorporated in the algo-
rithm. Thus, token supply can be used to influence the market price. In our
model below we will use it as a control action variable.

4.4 A More Stable and Regulated Market Price
Let T := [t0, t1] be the time horizon with t0 < t1. There are n potential inter-
acting regulated blockchain-based technologies over the horizon T . The regula-
tion authority of each blockchain-based technology has to choose the regulation
bounds: the price of cryptocurrency i should be between [p
i
, p̄i], p
i
< p̄i. We
construct a target price ptp,i from an historical data-driven price dynamics of i.
The target price should stay within the interval [p
i
, p̄i] target range. The market
price pmp,i depends on the quantity of token supplied, demanded and is given
by a simple price adjustment dynamics obtained from Roos 1925 (see [16,17]).
The idea of the Roos’s model is very simple: Suppose that the cryptocurrency
authority supplies a very small number of token in total, it will result in high
prices and if the authorities expect these high price conditions not to continue
in the following period, they will raise the number of tokens and, as a result,
the market price will decrease a bit. If low prices are expected to continue, the
authorities will decrease the number of token, resulting again in higher prices.
Thus, oscillating between periods of low number of tokens with high prices and
high number of tokens with low prices, the set price-quantity traces out an oscil-
latory phenomenon (which will allow large volume of transactions).
4.4.1 Designing a Regulated Price Dynamics
For any given p
i
< p̄i one can choose the coefficients c, ĉ such that the target
price ptp,i(t) ∈ [p
i
, p̄i] for all time t. An example of such an oscillatory function
is as follows:
ptp,i(t) = ci0 +
2∑
k=1
cik cos(2πkt) + ĉik sin(2πkt),
with cik, ĉik to be designed to fulfill the regulation requirement. Let ci0 :=

to stay between 0.98 USD and 1.02 USD we set p

= 0.98, p̄i = 1.02. Figure 4
plots such a target function.

Note that this target price is not the market price. In order to incorporate
a more realistic market behavior we introduce a dependence on demand and
supply of tokens.
4.4.2 Proposed Price Model for Regulated Monopoly
We propose a market price dynamics that takes into consideration the market
demand and the market supply. The blockchain-based market log-price (i.e. the
logarithm of the price) dynamics is given by pi(t0) = p0 and
dpi(t) = ηi[Di(t) − pi(t) − (Si(t) + ui(t))]dt
+
(
σidBi(t) +
∫
θ∈Θ
μi(θ)Ñi(dt, dθ)
)
+ σodBo(t), (5)
where ui(t) is the total token injected to the market at time t, Bo is standard
Brownian motion representing a global uncertainty observed by all participant
to the market. As above, the processes B and N are local uncertainty or noise.
B is a standard Brownian motion, N is a jump process with Lévy measure ν(dθ)
defined over Θ. It is assumed that ν is a Radon measure over Θ (the jump space).
The process
Ñ(dt, dθ) = N(dt, dθ) − ν(dθ)dt,
is the compensated martingale. We assume that all these processes are mutually
independent. Denote by (FBo
t , t ∈ T ) the filtration generated by the observed
common noise B0 (see Sect. 3.3). The number ηi is positive. For larger values of
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 59
ηi the market price adjusts quicker along the inverse demand. a, σ, σo are fixed
constant parameters. The jump rate size μ(.) is in L2
ν(Θ,R) i.e.
∫
Θ
μ2(θ)ν(dθ) < +∞.
The initial distribution p0 is square integrable: E[p20] < ∞.
4.4.3 A Control Design that Tracks the Past Price
We formulate a basic control design that tracks the past price and the trend. A
typical example is to choose the control action uol,i(t) = −ptp,i(t)+Di(t)−Si(t).
This is an open-loop control strategy if Di and Si are explicit functions of time.
Then the price dynamics becomes
dpi(t) = ηi[ptp,i(t) − pi(t)]dt
+σidBi(t) +
∫
θ∈Θ
μi(θ)Ñi(dt, dθ) + σodBo(t).

Figure 5 illustrates an example of real price evolution from prosumer elec-
tricity markets in which we have incorporated a simulation of a regulated price
dynamics as a continuation of real market. We observe that the open-loop con-
trol action uol,i(t) decreases the magnitude of the fluctuations under similar
circumstances.

4.4.4 An LQR Control Design
We formulate a basic LQR problem to a control strategy. Choose the control
action that minimize E{(pi(t1) − ptp,i(t1))2 +
∫ t1
t0
(pi(t) − ptp,i(t))2dt}. Then the
price dynamics becomes
dpi(t) = ηi[Di(t) − pi(t) − (Si(t) + ui(t))]dt
+σidBi(t) +
∫
θ∈Θ
μi(θ)Ñi(dt, dθ) + σodBo(t).
(7)
60 B. Djehiche et al.
4.4.5 A Mean-Field Game Strategy
The mean-field game strategy is obtained by freezing the mean-field term
Epi(t) := m(t) resulting from other cryptocurrencies and choosing the control
action that minimizes
Eq(t1)(pi(t1) − f(t1))2 + q̄(t1)[m(t1) − f(t1)]2
+E
∫ t1
t0
q(t)(pi(t) − f(t))2 + q̄(t)[m(t) − f(t)]2dt.
(8)
The mean-field term Epi(t) := m(t) is a frozen quantity and does not depend
on the individual control action umfg,i. Then, the price dynamics becomes
dpi(t) = η[Di(t) − pi(t) − (Si(t) + umfg,i(t))]dt
+σidBi(t) +
∫
θ∈Θ
μi(θ)Ñi(dt, dθ) + σodBo(t).
(9)
4.4.6 A Mean-Field-Type Game Strategy
A mean-field-type game strategy consists of a choice of a control action umftg,i
that minimizes
Lmftg = Eqi(t1)(pi(t1) − ptp,i(t1))2 + q̄i(t1)[E(pi(t1) − ptp,i(t1))]2
+E
∫ t1
t0
qi(t)(pi(t) − ptp,i(t))2 + q̄i(t)[Epi(t) − ptp,i(t)]2 dt.
(10)
Note that here the mean-field-type term Epi(t) is not a frozen quantity. It
depends significantly on the control action umftg,i. The performance index can
be rewritten in terms of variance as
Lmftg = Eqi(t1)var(pi(t1) − ptp,i(t1)) + [qi(t1) + q̄i(t1)][Epi(t1) − ptp,i(t1)]2
+
∫ t1
t0
qi(t)Var(pi(t) − ptp,i(t))dt
+E
∫ t1
t0
[qi(t) + q̄i(t)][Epi(t) − ptp,i(t)]2 dt.
(11)
Then the price dynamics becomes
dpi(t) = ηi[Di(t) − pi(t) − (Si(t) + umftg,i)(t)]dt
+
(
σidBi(t) +
∫
θ∈Θ
μi(θ)Ñi(dt, dθ)
)
+ σodBo(t),
(12)
The cost to be paid to the regulation authority if the price does not stay
within [p
i
, p̄i] is c̄i(1−1l[p
i
,p̄i](pi(t))), c̄i > 0. Since the market price is stochastic
due to demand, exchange and random events, there is still a probability to be
out of the regulation range [p
i
, p̄i]. The outage probabilities under the three
strategies uol,i, umfg,i, umftg,i can be computed and used as a decision-support
with respect to the regulation bounds. However, these continuous time strategies
may not be convenient.
Very often, the supply of tokens decision is made in fixed times τi and not
continuously. We look for a simpler strategy that is piecewise constant and takes
a finite number of values within the horizon T . Since the price may fluctuates
very quickly due the jump terms, we propose an adjustment based on the recent
moving average called the trend: y(t) =
∫ t
t−τi
x(t′)φ(t, t′)λ(dt′), implemented at
different discrete time block units.
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 61
Different regulated blockchain technologies may choose different ranges
[p
i
, p̄i], so that investors and users can diversify their portfolios depending
on their risk-sensitivity index distribution across the assets. This means that
there will be an interaction between the cryptocurrencies and the altcoins.
For example, the demand D =
∑n
i=1 Di will be shared between them. Users
may exchange between coins and switch into another altcoins. The payoff of
the blockchain-based technology i is Ri = p̂iDi − c̄i(1 − 1l[p
i
,p̄i](p̂i(t))), where
p̂i(t) = E[pi(t) | FBo
t ] is the conditional expectation of the market price with
respect to FBo
t .

5 Consumption-Investment-Insurance
A generic agent wants to decide between consumption-Investment-Insurance [19–
21] when the blockchain market is constituted of a bond with price p0 and several
stocks with prices pk, k > 0 and is under different switching regime defined over
a complete probability space (Ω,F ,P) in which a standard Brownian motion
B, a jump process N , an observable Brownian motion Bo and an observable
continuous-time finite-state Markov chain s̃(t) representing a regime switching,
with S̃ being the set of regimes, and q̃s̃s̃′ a generator (intensity matrix) of s̃(t).
The log-price processes are the ones given above. The total wealth of the generic
agent follows the dynamics
dx = κ0(r0(s̃) + μ̂0(s̃))xdt
+

(15)
where L = l(s̃)x.
62 B. Djehiche et al.
In the dynamics (15) we have considered per-claim insurance of uins. That is, if
the agent suffers a loss L at time t, the indemnity pays uins(L). Such indemnity
arrangements are common in private insurance at the individual level, among
others. Motivated by new blockchain-based insurance products, we allow not
only the cryptocurrency market but also the insurable loss to depend on the
regime of the cryptocurrency economy and mean-field terms.
The payoff functional of the generic agent is
R = −qe−λt1{x̂(t1) − [x(t1) − x̂(t1)]2} +
∫ t1
t0
e−λt log uc(t) dt,
where the process x̂ denotes x̂(t) = E[x(t) | F s̃0,Bo
t ]. The generic agent seeks
for a strategy u = (uc, uI , uins) that optimizes the expected value of R given
x(t0), s̃(t0) and the filtration generated by the common noise Bo.
For q = 0 an explicit solution can be found. To prove it, we choose a guess
functional of the form
f = α1(t, s̃(t)) log x(t) + α2(t, s̃(t)).

The optimal uc is obtained by direct optimization of e−λt log uc−α1
x uc. This is
a strictly concave function and its maximum is achieved at uc = e−λt
α1
x, provided
that α1(t, ·) > 0 and x(·) > 0.
This latter result can be interpreted as follows. The optimal consumption
strategy process is proportional to the wealth process, i.e., the ratio uc(t)
x∗(t) > 0.
Mean-Field-Type Games in Distributed Power Networks 63
This means that the blockchain-based cryptocurrency investors will consume
proportionally more when they become wealthier in the market. Similarly, the
insurance strategy uins can be obtained by optimizing
− 1
x
(1 + θ̄(s̃))E[uins(s̃)] + log(x − (L(s̃) − uins(s̃))) +
1
x
(L(s̃) − uins(s̃))],
which yields that
1
x − L + uins
=
1
x
(2 + θ̄).
Thus, noting that we have set L(s̃) = l(s̃)x, we obtain
uins(s̃) =
[
l(s̃) − 1 + θ̄(s̃)
2 + θ̄(s̃)
]+
x = max
{
0, l(s̃) − 1 + θ̄(s̃)
2 + θ̄(s̃)
}
x.
We observe that, for each fixed regime s̃, the optimal insurance is proportional to
the blockchain investor’s wealth x. We note that it is optimal to buy insurance
only if l(s̃) > 1+θ̄(s̃)
2+θ̄(s̃)
. When this condition is satisfied, the insurance strategy
is uins(s̃) :=
[
l(s̃) − 1+θ̄(s̃)
2+θ̄(s̃)
]
x which is a decreasing and convex function of θ̄.
This monotonicity property means that, as the premium loading θ̄ increases, it
is optimal to reduce the purchase of insurance.
The optimal investment strategy uI
k can be found explicitly by mean-field-
type optimization. Incorporating all together, a system of backward ordinary dif-
ferential equations can be found for the coefficient functions {α(t, s̃)}s̃∈S̃ . Lastly,
a fixed-point problem is solved by computing the total wealth invested in insur-
ance to match with m̄.
6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper we have examined mean-field-type games in blockchain-based dis-
tributed power networks with several different entities: investors, consumers,
prosumers, producers and miners. We have identified a simple class of mean-
field-type strategies under a rather simple model of jump-diffusion and regime
switching processes. In our future work, we plan to extend these works to higher
moments and predictive strategies.
