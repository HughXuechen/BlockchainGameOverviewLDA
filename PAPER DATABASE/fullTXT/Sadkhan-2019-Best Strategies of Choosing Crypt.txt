Abstract— One of the most important strength features of 
crypto-system’s is the key space. As a result, whenever the system 
has more key space, it will be more resistant to attack. The 
weakest type of attack on the key space is Brute Force attack, 
which tests all the keys on the ciphertext in order to get the 
plaintext. But there are several strategies that can be considered 
by the attacker and cryptographer related to the  selection of the 
right key with the lowest cost (time). Game theory is a 
mathematical theory that draws the best strategies for most 
problems. This research propose a new evaluation method which 
is employing game theory to draw best strategies for both players 
(cryptographer & attacker) . 
Keywords— game theory; security evaluation; crypto-system;  
key space . 
I. INTRODUCTION  
In cryptology, there are three types of sciences 
(cryptography, cryptanalysis, evaluation) [1]. What 
distinguishes the cryptographer from the cryptanalyzer is the 
possession of the key. While the first converts the plaintext to 
ciphertext using a secret key and cryptosystem, the second 
converts the ciphertext to the plaintext using the same 
cryptosystem without having the key, and this requires  an 
extraordinary effort.  
On the subject of evaluation, it is defined as the systematic 
acquisition and assessment of information to provide influence 
useful feedback about some object [2] and evaluation is an 
independent and supportive phase for cryptography. 
 The understanding of any problem and knowledge of the 
stages of the problem and what variables that affect the 
problem and the weight or impact of each variable can be 
considered a kind of evaluation. Therefore, game theory was 
chosen as a mathematical tool that accurately contributes to the 
analysis of the problem and to know the effect of each variable 
on the problem as a whole. In order to formulate any 
conflicting positions mathematically, game theory provides a 
general and accurate framework to describe the best behavior 
of players involved in such situations. One of the lawyers said, 
when I am getting ready to reason with a man, I spend one-
third of my time thinking about myself and what I am going to 
say and two-thirds about him and what he is going to say [3]. 
this indicate to, that game theory is applied in our life without 
feeling it. Depending on the type of crypto-system, specific 
security evaluation’s model  can used. In order to evaluate  
security of crypto-system using various models, different  
particles (elements) of the crypto-system are dealt with. For 
example, in [4] the outputs of the crypto-system are sometimes 
used as in the evaluation of the stream cipher using statistical 
tests. Also, in [5],  inputs (plain space & key space) and output 
(cipher space) of crypto-system are employed for  information 
theory  to evaluate the security of symmetric crypto-systems.  
Game theory is an effective and an accurate tool, so it can 
be used as a security evaluation model. It reveals what are the 
best behaviors for players involved in the game (problem), by 
reaching a state of balance in which each player is convinced of 
what he has, and there is no intention to change his state. The 
first player is convinced of the minimum profit he earns and 
the second player is convinced of the maximum loss he loses. 
Game theory explains the best behavior for cryptographer and 
attacker during choosing their keys from key space in order to 
achieve their goals with minimum cost (time) [6].  
Various researches are used the game theory in the 
evaluation process such as researcher in [7] showed a survey 
on using game theory for network security. Also, an attractive 
chapter showed a detailed source about using game theory in 
network security can be found in [8]. Researchers suggested an 
evaluation security model of crypto-systems, has been 
employed game theory (diagonal game) and information 
theory,  can be found  in [9]. Also, another evaluation model 
for crypto-system security which is employed game and 
information theories is suggested by researchers in [10].In  this 
paper, security evaluation is applied on the key space of crypto-
system using only game theory as a new evaluation model. 
In this paper gambit software (software tools for game 
theory graphical interface, Version 15.1.1), is used to solve the 
matrix game[11]. 
The structure of this paper includes an overview of 
cryptography and cryptanalysis is showed in section II, specific 
type of game theory related to the proposed model is clarified 
in section III, section IV consists of two sections handles the 
basic steps of the proposed mathematical model and case study. 
Results of the proposed model are showed in section V. and 
conclusions in the last section.

II. AN OVERVIEW OF CRYPTOGRAPHY AND CRYPTANALYSIS 
Under the umbrella of cryptology, there are three types of 
sciences: cryptography which is related to making secret codes,   
cryptanalysis which is related to breaking secret codes and 
evaluation which is related to evaluate the security of secret 
codes. Theses secret codes are also known as crypto-systems 
[1]. In Cryptography, two parities (sender and receiver) are 
securely intended to communicate with each other using 
crypto-systems over insecure channel. In cryptanalysis, parities 
other than sender and receiver are securely access the channel 
and trying to get information about what is being sent. 
The purpose of applying cryptography is to achieve the 
following objectives: confidentiality (keeping information 
secret from unauthorized parities), data integrity (keeping 
information unaltered by unauthorized parities), entity 
authentication (verifying the identity of entity), non-repudiation 
(preventing an entity from denying its previous commitments). 
The basic component that makes cryptography, 
cryptanalysis and evaluation under one umbrella is the crypto-
system. The crypto-system consists of: plaintext space, 
ciphertext space, keytext space, encryption algorithm and 
decryption algorithm [12]. Cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs 
was stated its principle related to cryptography: A crypto-
system should be secure even if everything about the system, 
except the key, is public knowledge [13], and this saying 
indicates to the security of crypto-system heavily depending on 
keytext space. 
In cryptanalysis, attacker  analyzes crypto-system, taking 
advantage of weaknesses in the crypto-system that he can 
detects, to restore plaintext and/or key from ciphertext. This 
weakness can be interpreted as (statistical properties of 
plaintext’s language, internal structure of encryption system 
(software or machine), information that is believed to be 
contained in the plaintext(cribs)) [14].  
Information theory provided an important model to prove 
the security of the crypto-system called provable security. 
There is no crypto-system throughout the ages that verifies 
provable security except one-time pad which was invented by 
engineer Gilbert Vernam in 1917.  One-time pad was proved to 
be provable secure in 1947 by scientist Claude Shannon. This 
leads to the fact that there is no secure developed crypto-
system unless it achieves the provable security concept and 
consequently it can withstand the attacks [15]. At each time 
different crypto-system was appeared and on the other hand, 
there was an attack to thwart it, e.g. In classical cipher such as 
transposition cipher ( scytale, column transposition, keyword 
columnar transposition ), where the letters of the plaintext are 
rearranged in order to get a ciphertext and key must has 
information about how to get back plaintext from ciphertext. 
Transposition cipher was exposed to divide and conquer attack. 
Substation cipher such as, viginere cipher, is exposed to 
statistical attacks (index of coincidence). Hill cipher was 
exposed to attack exploiting the linearity of the underlying 
cipher. Weakness of codebook ciphers concentrated around 
preserving the codebook and it also exposed to statistical 
attacks. 
In world war II, different ciphers such as enigma, purple 
and sigaba were appeared in German, Japan and America 
respectively. One of the weaknesses in these machine ciphers 
was the key space, i.e. engima is monoalphabetic substitution 
cipher with permutation representing by the initial setting of 
enigma. Germans were confident that the system was 
unbreakable because it had a large key space (2366), but in fact 
the effective key space (277) was far less effective than they 
thought, and thus the system was broken [16]. 
Consequently, modern crypto-systems have tended to 
increase the effective key space to ensure that the system 
would not be broken. E.g. when applying brute force attack 
using a supercomputer to crack the 128-bit AES key, it would 
take 1 billion billion years i.e. more than the age of the 
universe (13.75 billion years). If one uses a supercomputer to 
recover a DES key in a second , it would takes 149 trillion 
years to crack a 128-bit AES key using the same 
supercomputer [17]. 
In this paper, the relation between attacker and 
cryptographer in choosing the appropriate key from the key 
space will be investigated using game theory. 
III. TWO-PERSONS ZERO-SUM GAME ( GAME THEORY) 
Game theory is a mathematical theory that examines 
situations involving conflict over limited resources by two or 
more competitors. These competitors or so-called players are 
characterized by being rational, i.e. every player tries to 
achieve the greatest profit for himself and avoid the least lost. 
When the game theory consists of one player, it is called 
decision theory. Game theory  differs from decision theory in 
which the decision-maker, the first player, makes a decision 
versus an irrational player (nature), the second player, who 
makes his decisions randomly. 
There are three formulations of games in game theory: 
characteristic function game, extensive form game and 
strategic form game. In this paper, the simplest type, strategic 
form game or so called matrix game is used. 
In order to formulate a problem or competitive situation in 
strategic form game, four elements must be specified: 
1) Number of players. 
2) Strategies of each player. 
3) Payoff table, the entries of payoff table 
representing the payoff for each combination of 
players’ strategies. 
4) Utility function to compute the payoff value in the 
payoff table. 
Two-persons zero-sum game, as its name stated, consists of 
two non-cooperative players. The profit for one player 
considers as a loss for the other and consequently their 
summation is zero [6][18].  
In order to formulate the problem of this research as two-
persons zero-sum game, two players are represented by 
attacker (guesser) and cryptographer (chooser). The attacker 
continuously guesses what is the used key by the cryptographer

to encrypt the plaintext and get the available ciphertext. At the 
other side, the cryptographer chooses only one key to encrypt 
the plaintext from a position in the key space that makes its 
competitor (attacker) in a confused state. 
Game theory accurately determines what is the best 
situations for attacker and cryptographer to choose their keys 
from the key space of any crypto-systems. 
IV. A PROPOSED MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR STUDYING THE 
BEHAVIOR OF CRYPTO-SYSTEM’S PLAYERS BASED ON GAME 
THEORY 
A. Basic Steps to describe The Proposed Mathematical Model 
The proposed system employs one of the important 
mathematical theories, namely the game theory. This system 
examines the behavior of both cryptographer  and attacker in 
how to choose the appropriate key to encrypt plaintext or to 
decrypt ciphertext related to a particular crypto-system . 
1) Choose a specific crypto-system (Affine, Additive, 
Multiplicative) and specify its own key space. 
2) Choose how many times the key space is divided. 
3) Determine the type of the game that will be used in 
order to study Player’s behavior. 
4) Define the players of the game . 
5) Define players’ strategies  . 
6) Determine how the payoff function is calculated. 
7) Build a game matrix that contains payoff values for 
both players. 
8) Solve the game based mixed strategies (using gambit 
software). 
B. Case Study 
1) Assuming that the chosen crypto-system is the affine, 
so the key space is equal to 312, since E(x) = (ax+b) 
mod m, the key space of  a=12 the key space of  
b=26, so total key space =312. 
2) Suppose the key space is divided into three parts (the 
number of divisions is determined as the evaluator 
wants), so that each part contains 104 keys. i.e. key 
space 
K={(1,2,…104),(105,106,…,208),(209,210,…,312)} 
3) Two-person zero-sum game is used to build the 
proposed mathematical model. 
4) The players of the game are the attacker and the  
cryptographer. The cryptographer has one key to 
encrypt plaintext. The attacker  has no specific key 
and needs to think about strategy that make him 
choose the right key with minimum cost (time). 
5) The two players have the same three strategies (the 
number of strategies are as much as the number of 
divisions in the key space ) .  
Referring to TABLE I., The three strategies of the players 
are the extent to which the player chooses the key. The first   
strategy is to experiment the keys sequentially within the range 
of 104 to 1. The second strategy is to experiment the keys 
sequentially within the range of 208 to 1. The third strategy is 
to experiment the keys sequentially within the range from 312 
to 1.

Because both the functions of the cryptographer and the 
attacker are completely different, the number of attempts to 
select the key is different. Where the cryptographer knows the 
section of the key space in which  the key will be chosen. Also 
he knows what is the key needed to convert the plaintext to the 
ciphertext.  Conversely, the attacker does not know what is the 
key. Also, he does not know in which section of the key space 
he must searches the keys (i.e. what is the strategy has been 
used by the cryptographer), as shown in TABLE II. .

6) To calculate the Payoff function , one must consider 
the number of attempts of both players and whether 
these attempts led to access the correct key or not. 
Payoff function= A+R+P                    (1) 
Where variable A is the number of attempts without access 
to the right key. Due to  the nature of two-person zero-sum 
game  which requires the amount of what the first player earns 
is a loss for the second player. The variable  A  will take 
positive sign for cryptographer and negative sign for attacker. 
The variable R  means a reward for getting the right key 
and the variable  P  means a punishment for losing the right 
key. The variables  R   and  P  must have the same values, but 
one of them is negative when it is a punishment P and a 
positive when it is a reward R. In addition, these values are 
imposed on the condition that their values are higher than all 
the values in the TABLE III., here it is imposed as much as the

These values showed that the payoff for one player is the

values (0.7301, 0.1356, 0.1343) indicate to the probabilities 
that the first player (cryptographer) must be  followed in 
order to achieve the available payoff. Assuming that the 
number of attempts to be made by the first player is n, the 
game theory shows that the best behavior of the first player 
is to choose his or her keys from the range of the first 
strategy with a number of attempts equal to n*0.7301, from 
the range of the second strategy with a number of attempts 
equal to n*0.1356  and from the range of the third strategy 
with a number of attempts equal to n*0.1343. The  same 
thing for the values (0.1356, 0.1032, 0.7612) which are 
indicate to the probabilities that the second player (attacker) 
must be  followed in order to achieve the available payoff.

second  player's strategies vary from the greater value to the 
small value for the strategies third, first, second and fourth. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS  
Since   the security evaluation of crypto-system is an 
important subject, a new mathematical model based game 
theory is proposed. Game theory draws the best behavior (i.e. 
nash equilibrium) of choosing key from the key space for 
both players (cryptography and attacker). Since the modern 
approach to achieve the security of the crypto-system based 
on increasing the key space, it was necessary to create a 
mathematical model to evaluate the security of the crypto-
system concentrating on the used key space. The proposed 
model draws for both players, the best strategies that must be 
followed. Suppose a specific cryptosystem exposes to brute 
force attack, instead of an attacker employs its hardware 
abilities to search the all the key space of specific 
cryptosystem, he/she can concentrate on specific section of 
the key space using the same abilities. And consequently, 
he/she can achieve his/her goal with minimum time. The 
same thing for cryptographer who wishes to follow a strategy 
that leaves attacker with worst case. It is necessary to said 
that when the number of divisions in the key space increase, 
it will be useful to determine best strategies for both players.
