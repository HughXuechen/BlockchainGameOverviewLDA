Abstract—With the development of big data and machine
learning techniques, medical data sharing for the use of disease
diagnosis has received considerable attention. Blockchain, as
an emerging technology, has been widely used to resolve the
efficiency and security issues in medical data sharing. However,
the existing studies on blockchain-based medical data sharing
have rarely concerned about the reasonable incentive mechanism.
In this paper, we propose a cooperation model where medical data
is shared via blockchain. We derive the topological relationships
among the participants consisting of data owners, miners and
third parties, and gradually develop the computational process
of Shapley value revenue distribution. Specifically, we explore the
revenue distribution under different consensuses of blockchain.
Finally, we demonstrate the incentive effect and rationality of the
proposed solution by analyzing the revenue distribution.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays big data and machine-learning techniques have
been widely applied in the healthcare field[1, 2], where a
huge number of medical data resources can be transformed
into valuable knowledge contributing to scientific decisions.
Some Artificial Intelligence(AI) companies have been able
to utilize medical data, such as medical images, to construct
prediction models, and alliance with medical institutions to
provide diagnostic services for patients. Thus, they pay much
attention on the problems of medical data collection.
Generally, the medical data applied to construct prediction
models is kept separately in various hospitals or other medical
institutions, which poses a huge challenge to the quality and
efficiency of medical data sha,ring. As for the existing data
sharing schemes, the peer-to-peer network and cloud environ-
ment cannot completely avoid the risk of single point of failure
and the potential attacks on the centralized storage[3–5]. On
the other hand, the providers of diagnostic services have to
access to numerous storages for more medical data to improve
the accuracy of the prediction models, which increase the
difficulty of data sharing and the requirements for the network
environment [6, 7]. The burgeoning blockchain technology
has been effectively applied in data management [8–10] and
elegantly solves the above problems [11–13]. The advantages
of blockchain in the medical information field are remarkable,
especially embodied in the following aspects:

• The distributed blockchain system provides users oppor-
tunity to access data shared by scattered institutions.
• The features of “de-centralization” and “tamper-resistant”
solve the problems of data security and integrity.
• It is able to achieve data transactions and bilateral agree-
ments between data owners and service providers through
the digital currency application of blockchain[14].
The service providers play the role of third parties who build
the bridge between medical institutions and patients in medical
diagnosis. However, the behavior of data sharing and service
providing must be profit-driven. There is no such research on
the incentive mechanisms of data sharing based on blockchain.
In this paper, we explore the application of Shapley value in
distributing revenues among the data sharing participants, and
demonstrate the incentive effects and rationality of the pro-
posed solution by discussing the laws of revenue distribution.
To summarize, our contributions are the following:
• We propose a basic business model for medical data
sharing based on blockchain system and construct a
diagnostic service cooperation model.
• To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt
to explore the incentive mechanism of blockchain-based
medical data sharing. The incentive solution we present is
reasonable and effective for data and service transactions.
• We also propose a novel Shapley value scheme which
apply to the data sharing scenario.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II intro-
duces the background of blockchain and Shapley value. Sec.
III explains the problems in data sharing cooperation. Revenue
distribution is developed in Sec. IV. Sec. V demonstrates the
effect of our solutions. Sec. VI reviews the related work. We
present the conclusion in Sec. VII.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Blockchain
Blockchain is considered to be a distributed database that
maintains a continuously growing list of data records that are
hardened against tampering and revision[15]. Some excellent
features and functions of blockchain facilitate secure data
sharing and trusted information interaction.
The study of e-Health on blockchain is in its infancy.
Azaria et.al proposed MedRec, a decentralized record man-
agement system for electronic medical records(EMRs) using

blockchain, providing a secure access to medical data and
comprehensive, immutable log [11]. Xia et.al proposed a
blockchain-based data sharing framework that ensured sen-
sitive shared data by employing the secure cryptographic
techniques and controlled users access to EMRs in shared
repositories through blockchain [12]. They also presented
MedShare, a blockchain-based system that solved the problem
of medical data sharing among medical big data custodians in
a trust-less environment [13].
For our decentralized blockchain system of data sharing,
the blocks are jointly recorded and verified by all nodes in
the blockchain network. The characteristics of decentralization
and immutability in the blockchain settle the problems of
performance and trustless in conventional centralized systems.
Our data sharing system adopts the consortium blockchain
which is accessed only by the members within the coalition.
Consensus is a mechanism that achieve the reliability of
blockchain system in the presence of fault. Besides the binding
powers, the primary function of consensus is to incentivize
nodes to keep order. In Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc, participants
continually create new blocks through “mining” under the
incentive of the token rewards. The concept of “mining” is
broadly defined as a behavior of recording blocks here.
B. Shapley value
Considering a set of participants denoted as N where |N |
denotes the number of participants. We call any nonempty
subset S ⊆ N a coalition of the participants. We denote v(S)
as the worth function of coalition S, which measures the total
revenue produced by the coalition. Specifically, v(N ) is the
revenue of the whole set N . Let SPi(S) denotes the income
earned by the participant i for coalition S, then we have:
v(N ) =
∑
i∈S
SPi(S). (1)
Thus we can measure the contribution of each participant
to a coalition through the worth function v as follows.
Definition 1. The marginal contribution of participant i to
a coalition S ⊆ N\{i} is defined as
Δi(v, S) = v(S ∪ {i})− v(S). (2)
The Shapley value, proposed by Lloyd Shapley [16], serves
as a mechanism to share revenues generated by a coalition.
In practice, the revenue changes with each participant joining
the coalition. We calculate the Shapley value depending on the
change in the worth function v as Definition 2.
Definition 2. The Shapley value is defined by
ϕi(N , v) =
∑
s∈Si
w(|s|)Δi(v, s) ∀i ∈ N , (3)
where w(|s|) = (|N |−|s|−1)!|s|!
|N |! can be considered as the
weighting factor and Si denotes a collection of all subsets
of N excluding the participant i. Note that the Shapley value
defined above satisfies the property of effectiveness:
∑
i∈N
ϕi(N , v) = v(N ). (4)
The Shapley value reasonably assesses the revenue each
participant is entitled to by accumulating the marginal con-
tribution. Our main work is to utilize Shapley value theory in
distributing revenues to cooperators who take part in medical
data sharing on the blockchain. There are some solutions
based on Shapley value applied to other industries. Ma et.al
made great efforts to explore the cooperative settlement of
Internet service providers by using Shapley value [17]. Cai
and Pooch applied Shapley value in wireless mobile ad hoc
networks to encourage cooperative works by rewarding service
providers according to contributions [18]. Zheng et.al used
the modified Shapley value method to solve the allocation
problem of the closed-loop supply chain under the third-party
reclaim mode [19]. The novel achievements of our work is
the optimized Shapley value solution for medical data sharing
cooperation. The revenue distribution principle we propose
is based on the difference of data contributions and roles in
the coalition, which can greatly encourage the cooperation of
medical industry.
III. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
A. Business model
In the blockchain schemes, medical data sharing is real-
ized securely and efficiently. Data owners, such as hospi-
tals, publish their medical data via blockchain transactions.
The authorized third-party research institutions access to the
available data to train their respective diagnostic models by
applying some cognitive computing technologies, such as big
data analysis, machine learning and data mining, and aim to
earn revenues by providing diagnostic services.
Fig. 1. The Business Model of Medical Data Sharing.
Fig.1 depicts the blockchain-based data sharing business
model for EMRs. It illustrates how to achieve data sharing
and revenue distribution through information interaction and
capital flow. Data owners hold various types of medical data.
As the third parties put forward requests for medical data, the
data owners share their data on the blockchain network. In gen-
eral, the medical data is encrypted before uploaded to protect
privacy [20]. After the third parties acquiring data and serving

the patients who have paid, the payments are finally distributed
to the data owners who furnish the related data and the third
parties who provide the services. We utilize smart contracts to
control the revenue distribution automatically. Smart contracts
can be considered as the trusted intermediaries that execute
payment terms and manage money flows. Under the business
model, participants are continually paid as new revenues flow
into the coalition. This form of revenue distribution seems
more reasonable for the reason that it incentivize participants
to be responsible for the result of the cooperation. In practice,
a huge number of blockchain transactions are required for
sharing medical data.
B. Cooperation model
Data owners and third parties respectively serve as senders
and receivers of medical data in the blockchian-based data
sharing system. Besides, miners contribute to the cooperation
as they play an irreplaceable role of recording data on the
blockchain. It is necessary to facilitate information interaction
by incentivizing miners to participate in cooperation.
Fig. 2. Cooperation Model on Blockchain
We categorize participants as three types: third parties,
miners and data owners. The participants is defined as N =
T ∪ M ∪ H, where T = {T1, · · · , T|T |} denotes a set of
third parties, M = {M1, · · · ,M|M|} denotes a set of miners,
and H = {H1, · · · , H|H|} denotes a set of data owners. We
denote R = {1, · · · , R} as the set of services provided by T .
The elements in R represent the sequence number of services
and R is the number of service types. The set of services
provided by Ti is denoted by Ri ⊆ R. Similarly, we denote
D = {1, · · · , D} as a set of different types of medical data.
The elements in D are corresponding to those in R, thus we
have D = R, and the number of data types D satisfies D = R.
The types a data owner Hj shares are in Dj ⊆ D. When Ti
provides the service r ∈ Ri and Hj shares the data of type
d ∈ Dj that satisfies d = r, it means that Hj shares type d data
to Ti. There may be more than one type of data shared by Hj
matching the request of Ti. Such relationship is represented
by a connection, which goes through a group of miners. Fig. 2
shows a cooperation model where |T | = 3, |H| = 4, |M| = m
and R = D = {1, 2, 3}. All the miners in group M act the
same functionally and only one works at a time.
The revenue of the system consists of multiple payments.
We define the payment SP r
i as follows:
SP r
i = αrx
r
i ∀Ti ∈ T , (5)
where αr is the charge for each service r and xr
i denotes
the number of times that third party Ti provides service r in a
period time (equals zero if Ti does not provide service r during
the period or r /∈ Ri). The payment SP r
i is the periodical
charge produced by Ti providing service r. If service r is out
of the business of Ti, we have SP r
i = 0 for xr
i = 0. We
assume that all third parties charge the same amount for the
same service so that they compete fairly in business.
IV. REVENUE DISTRIBUTION
In this section, we step through the Shapley value revenue
distribution for data sharing participants. We consider the
contribution of data owners and the importance of various roles
in the coalition. Fruthermore, the detailed rules of revenue
distribution among miners is developed.
A. Revenue distribution among data owners
The purpose of this subsection is to measure the con-
tribution among data owners. In terms of the quality of
service, the performance of prediction models can be evaluated
by these commonly used metrics: Precision, Recall and F1-
score[21, 22]. However, there has often taken F1-score, which
quantifies the tradeoff between Precision(P ) and Recall(R),
as the overriding evaluation parameter (F1 = 2 P∗R
P+R ). In
the scenario where cooperators provide only one diagnostic
service, we extrapolate each data owner’s contribution to the
revenue from the F1-score of the prediction model trained by
its data.
We assume that all data owners Hi ∈ H meet the demand
of service r, i.e. Di = {r}. The total revenue belonging to the
group of data owner is represented by v(H). Assuming that
all the data owners have positive effect on the coalition. We
focus on the F1-score of the prediction model trained on the
data provided by an arbitrary subset of H.
We quantify the contribution to the F1-score of each partici-
pant by Δi(F1, s) = F1(s∪{i})−F1(s), where F1(s) is the
F1-score of the prediction model trained on the data provided
by the coalition s. It is similar with the marginal contribution
Δi(v, S) defined in Equation (2).
For any canonical system (H, v), we present the Shapley
value based on F1-score as
ϕi(H, v) =
∑
s∈Si
w(|s|)Δi(F1, s)
F1(H)
v(H) ∀i ∈ H, (6)
where Si = {s|s ⊆ H/{i}} denotes a collection of all subsets
of H excluding the participant i. As we utilize a unitization
method of dividing by F1(H) in Equation (6), the property
denoted in Equation (4) is satisfied, i.e.
∑
i∈H
ϕi(H, v) = v(H).
115

We define ϕHi
as the Shapley value revenue distributed to
Hi. The following theorem shows the Shapley value revenue
distribution for data owners.
Theorem 1 (SHAPLEY VALUE FOR DATA OWNERS). We
consider a set of data owners, H, sharing a single type of
medical data. We define Si
H = {H′|H′ ⊆ H/{Hi}} as a
collection of all subsets of H excluding the data owner Hi.
In terms of the marginal contribution to F1-score, the Shapley
value revenue for each data owner is the following:
ϕHi(H, v) = ϕi
H(H)v(H) ∀Hi ∈ H, (7)
where the normalized Shapley values {ϕ1
H , · · · , ϕ|H|H } are:
ϕi
H(H) =
∑
H′∈Si
H
w(|H′|)ΔHi(F1,H′)
F1(H)
∀Hi ∈ H. (8)
The normalized Shapley value ϕi
H can be considered as the
percentage of total revenue v(H) received by data owner Hi.
It is essentially an accumulation of the marginal contributions
ΔHi(F1,H′).
B. Revenue distribution in cooperation model
Before exploring the revenue distribution in cooperation
model, we construct a unit model where coalition provides
a single service, which is illustrated in Fig.3. The unit model
contains three groups of participants. The data owner group
and the third party group form a complete bipartite graph,
where all the connections go through the group of miner.
Fig. 3. Unit cooperation model.
Under the unit model, the coalition N = H ∪ M ∪ T
provides service r and |T | = 1. The income is from the service
generated by the only third party T0, i.e. v(N ) = αrx
r
0.
We define ϕHi , ϕMk
and ϕT0 as the Shapley value revenues
distributed to Hi, Mk and T0 respectively.
Theorem 2 (SHAPLEY VALUE FOR UNIT MODEL). We
consider a group, T , containing a single third party T0, a set
of miners, M, and a set of data owners, H. For the data owner
group, we define SH = {H′|H′⊆H,H′ �=∅} as a collection
of all non-empty subsets of H and Si
H ={H′|H′⊆H/{Hi}}
as a collection of all subsets of H excluding Hi. For the miner
group, we define SM={M′|M′⊆M,M′�=∅} as a collection
of all non-empty subsets of M, and Pk as the probability of
miner Mk mining a block. Assuming all data owners share the
medical data of the type d, which satisfies d = r. The Shapley
value revenue for each participant is in the following form:
ϕHi
(H,M, T ) = ϕi
H(H,M, T )v(N ) ∀Hi ∈ H,
ϕMk
(H,M, T ) = Pk|M|ϕM (H,M, T )v(N ) ∀Mk ∈M,
ϕT0
(H,M, T ) = ϕT (H,M, T )v(N ),
where the normalized Shapley values ϕi
H , ϕk
M and ϕT are:
ϕi
H(H,M, T)=
∑
H′∈Si
H
|M|∑
m=1
(
|M|

)
w(|H′|+m+1)

ϕM (H,M, T)=
∑
H′∈SH
w(|H′|+1)
F1(H′)
F1(H)
,
ϕT (H,M, T)=
∑
H′∈SH
|M|∑
m=1
(
|M|
m
)
w(|H′|+m)
F1(H′)
F1(H)
.
In the formula of Shapley value ϕMk
, we consider Pk|M|
as the “Expectation” of the weight of miner Mk. We derive
the normalized Shapley value from Equation (6). Third parties
and miners have no effect on the F1-score, but are necessary
for cooperation. It makes sense to compute F1-score only if
three types of participants exist in the coalition, otherwise the
value of F1-score is 0. Therefore, we remove all zero-value
marginal contribution and deduce the above formulas.
We extend the unit model to a complete cooperation model
shown by Fig.2. We distribute the total revenues in this model
by aggregating the result of all contained unit models. Thus,
the revenue of the complete cooperation model is denoted as
v(N ) =
|R|∑
r=1
|T |∑
j=1
SP r
j . (9)
In the following, ϕHi
, ϕMk
and ϕTj
denote the Shapley
value revenues distributed to Hi, Mk and Tj respectively.
Theorem 3 (SHAPLEY VALUE FOR COOPERATION MOD-
EL). We consider a coalition with a set of data owners H, a
set of miners M and a set of third parties T . Each third party
Tj provides a set of services Rj ⊆ R and each data owner
Hi shares a set of medical data Di ⊆ D. The data owner Hi
is connected to the third party Tj only if Rj ∩Di �= ∅, and
all connections go through the group of miners. The Shapley
value revenue for each participant is in the following form:
ϕHi
(H,M, T ) =
∑
r∈Di
|T |∑
j=1
ϕi
H(Hr,M, {Tj})SP r
j ,
ϕMk
(H,M, T ) = Pk|M|
∑
r∈D
|T |∑
j=1
ϕM (Hr,M, {Tj})SP r
j ,
ϕTj
(H,M, T ) =
∑
r∈Rj
ϕT (H,M, {Tj})SP r
j ,
where ϕi
H , ϕM and ϕT are introduced in Theorem 2. The
revenue SP r
j generated by third party Tj is supposed to be
distributed to miners proportionally, and paid to data owners
who provides data of type d, where d = r.

C. Mining revenue
In this subsection, we focus on revenue distribution between
miners under the Blockchain network applying different con-
sensus mechanisms. We assume that the size of data shared on
blockchain is huge enough, so that revenue distributed to each
miner can be close to ideal value in practice. In the following,
we consider several most common consensus mechanisms.
1) Proof of Work(PoW): Under the PoW mechanism,
miners compete for recording blocks by costing a great deal of
calculations. Hashrate, whose unit is hash/s, can measure the
computing power of miners. We define ck as the hashrate of
the miner Mk. The revenue proportion of each miner actually
equals the probability of mining a block. Thus, the revenue
proportion can be represented as follows:
Pk = ck/
|M|∑
i=1
ci ∀Mk ∈M. (10)
2) Proof of Stake(PoS): There are also competitions for
recording blocks in PoS mechanism. Miners who hold more
stakes are more likely to gain the right, which is determined by
the number of tokens and coin age. We assume that a miner
Mk holds wk tokens and the coin age on this point is ak,
so the stake of this miner is wkak. However, the coin age
will be reset when the miner wins a competition. Assuming
the interest rate is I , a miner with wk tokens and ak days
of coin age will be paid wkakI/365 tokens when he mines
the current block. For each miner, the increase in coin age
is synchronous. As a result, the increment of miners’ stakes
keep proportional with the number of their tokens. We infer
the revenue proportion of each miner Mk as
Pk = wk/
|M|∑
i=1
wi ∀Mk ∈M. (11)
3) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance(PBFT): The
PBFT algorithm was proposed to solve the Byzantine gen-
eral problem. It is a consensus that applies to consortium
blockchain. Under PBFT, nodes take turns being the leader
node and sending current message to all other nodes. After
messages being synchronized between nodes, the blocks are
generated. In view that all the nodes have the same chance to
be the leader node, all normal nodes should be paid equally.
Nevertheless, the fault nodes and malicious nodes ought not
to be rewarded. We assume that n blocks are generated in a
period, and we define Ak ⊆ {1, · · · , n} as the set of sequence
number of the round that the node Mk becomes a normal
node. We also define qi as the number of normal nodes in the
ith round. That is,
qi =
|M|∑
k=1
1{i∈Ak} ∀i ∈ {1, · · · , n}, (12)
thus the revenue proportion of each node is
Pk =
1
n
∑
i∈Ak
1
qi
∀Mk ∈M. (13)
Our work is to explore the optimal distribution scheme of
revenues under various consensus mechanisms. Other consen-
sus mechanisms not mentioned above are able to be applied
to the scenarios as well, which is to be studied in the future.
V. ANALYSIS
In this section, we discuss the laws of revenue distribution
under the models developed in the previous section, and
explore the incentive effect and rationality of the incentive
mechanism.

scores. (a) Undifferentiated data owners in the model; (b) Differentiated data
owners in the model.
Fig. 5. The Shapley value revenue under the unit model with a variable size
of the data owner group.
A. Data contribution effect
We first explore the impact of the data contribution on the
revenue distribution result by fixing the size of each group and
changing the F1-score of the data owners for a certain service.
Considering a unit model that |H| = 2, |M| = 5 and |T | = 1.
We define φH =
∑
Hi∈H
ϕHi
,φM =
∑
Mk∈M
ϕMk
and φT = ϕT0
as the aggregate Shapley value for the group of data owner,
miner and third party respectively. Fig.4 illustrates how the
values of φH, φM and φT change with the overall contribution
of the shared data changing. We first consider the situation that
the two data owners contribute equally to F1-score. Fig.4(a)
eliminates the differences between the two data owners by
synchronize their F1-score (F1({H1}) = F1({H2}) = F0).
We observe that the Shapley value of data owners decrease and
that of miners and the third party increase when the F1-score
ratio F0/F (H) increases. As for a general situation that the
F1-score of each data owner changes diversely, we find that
the aggregate Shapley value revenues of each group are only
related to the sum of F1-scores, i.e. F1({H1}) + F1({H2}),
117

which is illustrated in Fig.4(b). The observation is the same
in the case of more data owners in the coalition. The result of
revenue distribution will not change when the sum of F1-score
ratios of all subset of data owners remains unchanged.
The trend of revenue distribution can be understood in terms
of the importance of cooperation. When the participation of
data owners greatly effect the F1-score of the system, more
revenues should be distributed to them.
B. Motivation and Rationality
The revenue distribution under the complete cooperation
model obeys the laws in each unit model. In a general
case, data owners must be incentive to participate in more
sharing process for revenues. In terms of data quality, they
can increase the proportion of their incomes by providing
real and effective data, which is revealed in the elements of
Shapley value formula in Theory 2. The motivation for third
parties to cooperate with more data owners is twofold. On
the one hand, valuable data contributes to the accuracy of
their prediction models, which may attract more customers.
On the other hand, third parties can get more revenues from
the coalition with more data owners, which can be studied in
Fig.5 by fixing the number of miners (|M| = 5) and setting
all F1-scores to the same value. Miners can only benefit by
participation. They are responsible to record the shared data
and make it credible. There is no doubt that third parties are
motivated to participant in a coalition with more miners for
the consideration of information security.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a Shapley value solution to incen-
tivize the cooperation of medical data sharing on blockchain.
We describe a blockchain application in medical service and
design a cooperation model that reflects the relationships
among the participants. We make a first attempt at the in-
centive mechanism of blockchain-based medical data sharing
by proposing a novel Shapley value scheme which apply to
the scenario and study the impact of consensus on miners’
income. Finally, theoretical verification and analysis are given
to prove that our solution can incentivize participants to per-
form actively in cooperation. In the future, we plan to further
investigate other factors affecting contribution and distribution
and evaluate the effect of incentive mechanism in practice.
