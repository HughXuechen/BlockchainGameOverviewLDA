Abstract
Blockchain technology is touted as a game-changer. Many experts consider blockchain tech-
nology as one of the disruptive innovations. Following significant success in the banking and
finance sector, blockchain technology has found significant success in all fields, including
health, manufacturing, transportation, disaster relief operations, and many others. Recently,
the academician has contributed significantly towards understanding blockchain technology
and its application in the management field. To understand how the literature on blockchain
technology in the supply chain has progressed, we undertook an extensive review of the liter-
ature published in peer-reviewed journals using databases such as SCOPUS.We have further
classified our literature into four stages (pre-adoption, adoption, implementation, and appli-
cation). Finally, we synthesized the findings of the study and proposed a research framework
to explain how an organization can build supply chain resilience and enhance supply chain
performance with the help of blockchain technology. Finally, we have noted the limitations
of the study and future research directions.

1 Introduction
Blockchain Technology (BT) is a technology blessed with a decentralised storage system that
is distributed, contracts that are digital and smart and asymmetric encryption whilst enabling
visibility, transparency, traceability, and security to a network employing BT (Dutta et al.,
2020; Katsaliaki et al., 2021). As a result of its decentralised, verifiable, and immutable

character, it has already disrupted or is on the path to disrupt a wide range of indus-
tries/areas/sectors such as banking, copyright, energy (renewable), healthcare, insurance,
operations, real estate, and supply chains in general (Fosso Wamba et al., 2020a; Hald &
Kinra, 2019; Pandey et al., 2022; Tandon et al., 2021). The enormous potential of blockchain
to alter every step of SC, from the acquisition of raw materials to the delivery to customers,
is well known (Babich & Hilary, 2020). The buzz around blockchain applications is still
there, and we may be a few years away from their commercialization, but the future of this
technology is bright (Pournader et al., 2020).
Previous studies by Hald and Kinra (2019) focused on BT’s effect on supply chain perfor-
mance by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on 48 articles. Through this study,
they were able to report different blockchain identities. Similarly, Pournader et al. (2020)
conducted SLR along with bibliometric and co-citation analysis on 48 articles to study BT
applications in SCs, transport and logistics. They discussed emerging themes along with the
application of BT in SC, transportation, and logistics. Taking it further, Dutta et al. (2020)
conducted SLR on 178 articles to study BT integration, application, and challenges in SC
operations. They pertinently mentioned that all the major industries could be revamped with
BT by targeting business process management and visibility.
However, this study stands different from past literature by exploring and conduct-
ing an in-depth investigation on BT adoption, implementation and future application
through a self-developed guiding framework that specifically categorizes articles into four
themes/perspectives and provides a fresh outlook on the literature by identifying and
establishing the four distinct themes. Therefore, the present study provides the following
contributions. First, as one of the first studies to attempt the categorization of BT literature
in supply chain (SC) for understanding the perspectives of technology adoption and imple-
mentation, this study enlists key theories, and BT features utilised in each of the themes
identified. Second, this study develops a relationship between blockchain and its impact on
supply chain resilience (SCRES) by exploring the studies reviewed as per the review proto-
col. Past studies also indicate that BT plays a pivotal role in enhancing the SCRES (Dubey
et al., 2020; Iftikhar et al., 2022) while SCRES itself presents as an area of interest for many
scholars and industry experts since its strategies provide ways to thwart disruptive events
(Tukamuhabwa et al., 2015). Third, the study proposes research agenda based on Whetten
(1989) “5W and 1H approach” i.e., “what, who, why, when, where and how” and develops
a comprehensive research framework for BT and its identified features from the literature.
The framework lays the foundation for the future empirical testing.
There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of research being done in this field from
2017 onwards (Dutta et al., 2020), while research projects focused on BT’s impact on SC
started to pick up by 2018 (Zhang et al., 2022). Thus, this study develops a comprehensive
dataset of literature published from the year 2017–2022 based on a systematic literature
search process. This study provides fresh insights on the current state of blockchain in SC
and sets the stage for future research. Hence, the following objectives have been framed to
execute this literature review study.
RO1 To identify the themes, areas, and industries discussed in the BT in SC literature.
RO2 To study if and how blockchain impacts SC Resilience (SCRES).
RO3To develop future research agenda and a comprehensive framework of BT and identified
themes for future empirical testing.
We develop and follow a guiding framework that divides the study into four themes Refer

2 Methodology
The study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) as per the Denyer and Tranfield
(2009) and Tranfield et al. (2003) protocol and consequently adapted Dutta et al. (2020)
search methodology. We established a rigorous procedure to include and exclude the articles
starting with a set of search strings by evaluating the previous literature. The initial search
keyword resulted in the generation of 2934 articles conducted in the Scopus database which
is considered to be one of the world’s most reliable and comprehensive database for peer-
reviewed journals (Tandon et al., 2021; Varriale et al., 2021). On further filtering, we set
certain inclusion criteria. We only included articles that include discussion about BT in SC
domain, and are published in top-peer reviewed journals, and the number was reduced to
1,382 and by selecting “English” as the only, the number went down to 1346. By limiting the
subject areas to Business, Management and Accounting; Computer Science and Decision
Sciences, the number went down to 1019. We then limited the journals to the top peer-
reviewed journals. We arrived at a list of 390 articles upon this search category (as of 31
May 2022). Upon ensuring the availability and reading of full text articles, we arrived at the
final count of 292 articles. Figure 1 represents the search methodology. Table 2 presents the
inclusion and exclusion criteria.

3.3 Industry-wise classification
Based on the data, we observed that food industry that includes fish, wine, tea, dairy, etc. had
the most interest of authors followed by a combination of multiple industries; manufacturing;
supply chain and logistics; agriculture; fashion and healthcare. Food SCs have been the focal
application area of blockchain when it comes to traceability and transparency (Casino et al.,
2021; Kittipanya-ngam & Tan, 2020; Treiblmaier & Garaus, 2022; Vu et al., 2021). Table 4
lists industry-wise classification.
3.4 Country-wise classification
We establish two tables for country-wise classification. Table 5 represents the Country of Ori-
gin which mentions the origin of research being published while Table 6 represents Country
of Focus which mentions the country in which research has been conducted. China followed
by UK, USA and India are four most publishing nations while India followed by China, USA
and UK are the countries in which has been conducted.

3.5 Methodological classification
We adapt Saunders et al. (2019) onion model for methodological classification along with
adaptation of Sharma et al. (2017). Figure 3 presents the methodology-based classification
of the selected research papers. It can be observed that 19% are modelling-based studies
(employing Stackelberg game-theoretical analysis, stochastic optimization, Nash bargain-
ing, mixed-integer programming, etc.), 15% are case studies (employing interview, content
analysis, etc.), 15% are conceptual or theoretical works, 15% are exploratory or interpretive
in nature (employing MCDM tools such as ISM, DEMATEL, BWM, etc.), 12% are surveys
followed by 11% of mixed methodology-based studies. Figure 3 shows the methodological
classification.

4 Findings
In this section, we discuss the content analysis of the selected articles. This section henceforth
leads to the findings from the content analysis and then the discussion as a subsequent section.
In the findings, we construct tables for citations based on themes, the BT features explored
in that theme and the theories utilised in the themes.
4.1 Classification of articles based on identified themes
This section classifies the articles as per the perspectives regarding conceptualization, design-
ing, adoption, implications, and future applications, and hence, generates four major themes
or perspectives viz a viz pre-adoption, adoption, implication of implementing and applica-
tions of blockchain technology in SC. Table 21 summarises the four themes.
4.1.1 Pre-adoption theme/perspective
This theme/perspective relates to the pre-requisites/requirements for the adoption of BT,
designing and execution of any pilot projects and to understand the intentions of SCmanagers
whether they are eager to undertake the adoption of BT in SC. Under this theme, we have
classified 62 articles as shown in Table 7. Table 8 represents theories utilised under pre-
adoption theme. Table 9 represents BT features explored under pre-adoption theme.
Treiblmaier (2018) discussed about structurisation and management of SC that would
incorporate BT. The study utilised principal agent theory (PAT), transaction cost analysis
(TCA), resource-based view (RBV) and network theory (NT) for recommending BT integra-
tion in a SC. Chang et al. (2019) provided conceptual guidelines concerned with designing
and implementation of practical business system design. The study proposed a novel BT
based real-time process and tracking of logistics that would reduce costs related to cash
backlogs. Thus, study presented an opportunity of mitigating inefficiencies by improving
transparency, speedy payments, tracking, and improved convenience. Queiroz and Fosso
Wamba (2019) utilised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to
understand BT adoption behaviour and usage of individuals. The survey identified a distinct

existence of differences in adoption behaviours of individuals from India and USA. Follow-
ing this study, Queiroz et al. (2021) empirically validated UTAUT proposed model in Brazil
and found effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and trust are the most
critical constructs that directly affect behavioural intention to adopt BT. Kamble et al. (2019)
statistically validated a model based on technological acceptance model (TAM), theory of
planned behaviour (TPB) and technology readiness index (TRI) to understand perception
of users on BT adoption. The study found that constructs of TRI have no significant effect
on TAM constructs of perceived ease of use and usefulness while behavioural intention was
significantly affected by perceived usefulness, perceived behavioural control and attitude.
Similarly, Karamchandani et al. (2020) analysed perception of enterprise BT among service
industry professionals using technological acceptance model (TAM) theory. The results were
promising as the professionals of Indian Service Industry believed in practicality of enter-
prise BT especially in quality of information, quality of service, reliability of delivery, mass
customisation and customer relationship. The study by Jain et al. (2020) tested the effect
TAM theory constructs on the behavioural intentions of online consumers towards BT. The
study found a direct impact of three constructs of TAM on the behavioural intention which
further had direct impact on actual behaviour towards using BT. Moving away from TAM,
study by ) adopted technology, organisation and environment (TOE) framework to study
behavioural intention of users in Malaysian Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The study
123
Annals of Operations Research
found out that complexity, cost, competitive pressure, and relative advantage had significant
effects on behavioural intention. Innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and institutional theory
(IT) too have been utilised to check the intention to use the BT in industries (Hartley et al.,
2022; Hew et al., 2020). Wamba and Queiroz (2022) applied a set of five theories to empiri-
cally study intention to adopt BT. They empirically validated that there were differences in
variables affecting adoption intention of users from India and USA. The study by Kamble
et al. (2021) used machine learning to predict BT adoption in SC. Hastig and Sodhi (2020)
identified six major business requirements and six critical success factors for successful
implementation of SC Traceability systems in pharmaceutical and cobalt mining industries.
Identification of such factors would help in conducting case based research and inspire many
other empirical works. Van Hoek (2019) adopted Reyes et al. (2016) framework and reported
that factors from the framework are indeed relevant when it came to BT consideration for
SC. The study found leadership engagement, customer demand, leadership commitment, etc.
to be the factors that favour pilot development projects in case of BT implementation in SC.
Kayikci et al. (2022a, 2022b) in their review paper reported that under the umbrella of PPT
(people, process, and technology), there were clear opportunities and impediments in case
of people and technology. Massive benefits that arose out of implementing BT in SC espe-
cially in Food SC outweighed the risks. The study outrightly mentioned security and need of
massive infrastructure as the boosters of usage and implementation of BT. Van Hoek (2020a,
2020b) adopted multiple case study method to explore the knowledge gained by the early
adopters of BT in SC. Insights gained from case studies indicated possibility of developing
pilot projects with a concern for swift launches by scoping existing pilots in a planned man-
ner with engagement of all stakeholders. Erol et al. (2021) evaluated the feasibility of BT
using fifteen indicators while comparing between seven industries using AHP and TOPSIS.
The study found that industries of logistics and SC along with healthcare and finance were
the most feasible options for BT projects while need for improved traceability, visibility and
reduced fraud turned out to be the most important indicators. Wang et al. (2021a, 2021b,
2021c, 2021d, 2021e) reported a 2-year study of smart contract initiative by engaging in
DSR (design science research). The study further utilised theory of business model along
with sensemaking theory to give shape to future BT deployment in SC and addressed prob-
lems SC transparency and provenance. Oropallo et al. (2021) designed circular BT platform
using integrated Triple Retry Framework. The study utilised in-depth case study and con-
ducted face-to-face interviews along with direct observation and results highlighted role of
BT as a technological capability which could improve the controlled waste movement and
activities related to product return. Chowdhury et al. (2022) proposed a BT decision frame-
work that would be used to assess the feasibility of BT adoption in contexts related to risk
management. For such a framework, the study used TAM predictors, VUCA constructs and
resilience to understand their effect on intention to adopt BT. The survey results showed that
all the constructs positively affected the managers intention to adopt BT. Oh et al. (2022)
proposed a framework based on seven dimensions that offer conceptual guidance on design-
ing a BT enabled SC. The seven dimensions network, governance, data processing, database,
data, value transfer and platform were stacked into 3 different design decision perspectives:
configural, operational and strategic. Büyüközkan et al. (2021) proposed a customer-focused
BT design by utilising group decision making (GDM) approach. The study was conducted in
a qualitative way and generated critical factors to help in design of an effective BT enabled
SC structure. However, a study by Sodhi et al. (2022) explained the adoption experience of
emerging technologies (such as BT) by studying the perception of managers utilising affor-
dance theory. The study reported there is no connection between the characteristics of the
123
Annals of Operations Research
technology and the users’ expectations at the early stages of adoption. Such an initial discon-
nect between characteristics of technology and the expectations of managers could explain
inflated expectations that were followed by a low of disappointment concerning emerging
technology as explained in the Gartner Hyper Cycle since most of the users of emerging
technology focus on attainment of similar benefits for SC like the old ones.
It is important to note that pre-adoption theme has predominantly mentioned TAM, DSR,
TOE theories that are related to either intention to adopt or to the designing of BT based
SC in case of DSR. Since, BT is still in its nascent stage, and studies on intention to adopt
are very scant. Hence, it becomes pertinent to study the perception and intention of its users
before adopting the technology to understand the expectations it has generated among the
masses.
4.1.2 Adoption theme/perspective
This theme/perspective relates to the early adoption projects, enablers of adoption, barriers of
adoption and the decisions related to adoption of BT. A total of 78 papers have been classified
under this category as shown in Table 10. Table 12 presents theories utilised under adoption
theme. Table 13 presents BT Features explored under adoption theme.
Saberi et al. (2019) identified and categorised four types of barriers to adoption of BT i.e.,
intra-organizational barriers, inter-organizational barriers, system-related barriers, and exter-
nal barriers. The study focused on successful adoption of BT for tracing sustainable practices
in aSC.Kamble et al. (2020) identified andestablished relationships between thirteen enablers
of BT adoption in agriculture supply chains (ASCs). They employed interpretive logic on the
BTenablers and used Interpretive StructuralModelling (ISM) andDecision-MakingTrial and
Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology (Samad et al., 2022; Yadav et al., 2021) to
establish otherwise complicated causal relationships. They found traceability (Sharma et al.,
2021a, 2021b) to be the most important enabler followed by immutability and provenance.
Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) utilised TOE and force-field theories alongwithDEMATEL to iden-
tify, classify and establish barriers to BT adoption. The study found technological barriers to

have the most prominence specifically security, negative perception and immaturity to be the
prominent barriers. Fosso Wamba et al. (2020b)through a survey established that BT adop-
tion is significantly affected by trading partner pressure and the knowledge sharing while BT
adoption significantly improves transparency and hence, SC performance. van Hoek (2020b)
empirically studied the adoption rates, drivers, and barriers by conducting a series of work-
shops. This study went beyond the normal exploration of pilots and uncovered the adoption
progress of BT in industry. Improving data and product security, visibility and SC processes
were the top-rated drivers while lack of understanding about integration, potential benefits
and costs including ROIwere the top-rated barriers. Guo et al. (2021) explored early adoption
determinants and found opportunistic behaviour of managers to be the reason for early adop-
tion. Mathivathanan et al. (2021) identified and analysed BT adoption barriers using Total
Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied
to Classification (MICMAC) analysis. The study identified lack of familiarity with BT and
lack of business awareness as the top-most influential barriers to adoption. Vafadarnikjoo
et al. (2021) analysed BT adoption barriers in manufacturing SC and found transaction- level
uncertainties as the most prominent barrier. Ali et al. (2021) utilised multiple case studies in
Malaysian Halal Food SC to build a framework related to BT adoption opportunities/drivers
and challenges. The study found complexity and capability, cost, and competitive advantage,
change management and external pressure, and regulatory capability as key challenges to
BT adoption. In a survey by Nayal et al. (2021), the influence of factors such as SC risk,
SC integration, cost, top management support, etc. was tested using SEM and all the factors
positively influenced the adoption of BT. Baharmand et al. (2021) investigated enablers and
barriers to BT adoption in humanitarian SC. The study also utilised a case study to reveal that
BT added value by increased traceability, visibility which meant increased transparency. Bai
et al. (2022) evaluated BT enablers in African Cocoa industry by utilising TOE framework
and best–worst method (BWM) and found smart contracts, security and tracking as major
enablers. Galati (2022) explored the role of social capital in adopting BT. The study utilised
multiple case studies and identified BT adoption to be dependent on relational capital as a
necessary but not a sufficient condition.
However, Wu et al. (2021) analysed strategies for BT adoption in case of fresh product
SC. They found that BT adoption isn’t an optimal decision as it depends on traceability
cost proportion allocation between SC members, product deterioration rate and consumers
product acceptance degree without BT. He et al. (2021) in a similar setting found BT adoption
non-beneficial to supplier and retailer. Li et al. (2021b) showed that the decision to adopt
BT for authentication purposes in a luxury SC depended on the cost difference between a
manual technology and BT. The results showed that decision to adopt BT was positive when
the cost difference was small. Anastasiadis et al. (2022) proposed that a decision to adopt
BT as a traceability system could stir the adoption of circular economy and sustainability
practices (Tsolakis et al., 2022). Ji et al. (2022) found that decision to adopt BT in SC if
and only if sensitivity of consumer exceeds the minimum requirement level along with the
consideration of reaping big profits in themanufacturers case whowill adopt the BT.Wu et al.
(2022) further proposed that BT adoption depends on consumers awareness about traceability
and cost-sharing of BT-based traceability betweenmanufacturer and retailer. Fan et al. (2022)
reiterated that BT adoption depends on consumers awareness about traceability and the cost
of using BT along with production cost of supplier and manufacturer. Naef et al. (2022)
argued that for successful adoption of BT in a bigger network of SC, centralised leadership
was the key. Kumar et al. (2022a) proposed a BT 4.0 based framework for an agricultural
SC. The study focused on enhancing transparency, traceability, and sustainability of SC by
adopting BT. Song et al. (2022) utilised game theory to understand BT adoption behaviour

or BT adoption cost is low.
A total of 23 studies have focused on barriers of adoptionwhile 15 are focused on enablers.

4.1.3 Implication of implementing theme/perspective
This theme/perspective relates to the outcomes of implementing BT either through virtual
platform, a simulation or in real word scenario. This sub-section also discusses whether the
outcomes are positive and whether they meet or go beyond the expectations at pre-adoption
and adoption stage. A total of 87 studies falls under this theme as listed in Table 14. Table
15 lists theories utilised in implication of implementing theme. Table 16 lists BT features
explored under implication of implementing theme.
Choi (2019) utilised game theory while comparing the traditional retail jewellery oper-
ations with the BT backed ones and found that BT generated higher benefit to both
manufacturer and consumer by utilising diamond authentication and certification. Mar-
tinez et al. (2019) investigated effect of BT through resource base view lens while being
implemented on customer order management process and found that BT improved process
efficiency, order traceability, and further reduced the number of operations while saving
average order time. Ivanov et al. (2019) analysed the impact of BT as a track and trace tech-
nology on SC. The study found that an advanced track and trace system like BT increased
SC visibility, enhanced real-time identification of events which lead to a decrease in disrup-
tion risk and hence, reduced chances of ripple effect. Choi (2020) proved that BT-enabled
SC considerably faced lower operational risk (Chaudhuri et al., 2021) than the normal SC.
Dubey et al. (2020) argued that BT could be successfully utilised to enhance transparency,
swift trust, and further improve collaboration along with improved supply chain resilience
(SCRES) in a humanitarian SC. In line with the effect of BT on SCRES and ripple effect,
Lohmer et al. (2020) utilised agent-based simulation model to analyse the impact of BT on
disruptions and SCRES. The simulation indicated that BT successfully promotes SCRES and
its aligned strategies if smart contracts were employed for collaboration under risk. Manu-
pati et al. (2020) while being focused on the sustainability developed a BT based distributed

ledger for monitoring SC performance and further aimed at optimising operational costs and
emission levels. The study utilisedMixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model
and found that BT ensured the minimisation of the objectives. Pan et al. (2020) reported that
BT implementation had significant effect on enterprise organisational capabilities such as
asset turnover rate and reduction of sales expense rate. The study further proposed that BT
introduced a trust mechanism along with an improvement in decentralized operations and
data integrity. Rogerson and Parry (2020) conducted multiple case studies-based interviews
from food industry. They reported empirical evidence of BT leading to an increase in SC vis-
ibility, provenance, and a protection against counterfeits. Similarly, Köhler and Pizzol (2020)
utilised multiple cases based study to check impact of BT implementation in food SC. The
study found that food BT had enhanced transparency, visibility traceability in SC and hence,
lead to an increase in trust. Khan et al. (2021) based on a survey concluded that BT posi-
tively impacted green SC practices which lead to a positive organisational performance. Qian

and Papadonikolaki (2021) argued that BT implementation provides solutions for enhanced
contracting, data tracking and resource transferring in SC which in turn enhance trust from
various sources in a SC. Keeping a hold onto trust is crucial for any SC Finance firm and
BT can help in that direction removing information asymmetry and inequality (Du et al.,
2020). Brookbanks and Parry (2022) argued that BT implementation doesn’t introduce trust-
less disintermediation. Instead, the study argued that new trustworthy intermediaries had
to be introduced who could be trusted. In sync with the information sharing issues, Nandi
et al. (2020) reported that firms implementing BT are focused on improving operational-
level capabilities such as coordination and information sharing capabilities) rather than on

strategic ones such as collaboration and integration as such improvements lead to better SC
performance parameters based on the type of industry such as reduced cost, quality improve-
ment, increased flexibility and process improvement. Liu et al. (2021b) through their case
study method argued that IoT and BT together (Gopal et al., 2022) were more effective
in mitigating information asymmetry issues and hence, dilute SC finance risks leading to
appraised value creation as well as value appropriation (Ning & Yuan, 2021). In a surprise
turn of events, Shen et al. (2020) reported that on an online marketplace platform BT was
preferred for selling second-hand products that are low in uniqueness and low in quality
but not for high quality products. BT also reportedly improved horizontal integration which
improved SC’s overall profit. However, Niu et al. (2021a, 2021b) utilised mathematical mod-
elling to understand impact of BT and reported BT to be double-edged sword. On one hand,
it increased firms wholesale profit but reduced its retailing profit and tax benefits on the other.
Mangla et al. (2021) investigated societal impact of BT in context of sustainable milk SC
using systems theory. The study argued that BT had positive impact on social parameters
related to milk SC such as improved food security, decreasing food fraud, assisting healthy
food access, etc. Xu et al. (2021b) argued that BT made products greener, and brought about
SC coordination whilst bringing manufacturer and the platform more profits. Wang et al.
(2021a) through their multimethod study comprising of an experiment and case study found
that BT adoption specifically as tracing system improved product sales, SC transparency,
process management and significantly decreased product returns. In a very unique study by
Bai et al. (2021), results indicated a huge improvement in trust and transparency when trust
values from sensors were recorded in BT in the green SC. Erol et al. (2022) argued that BT’s
traceability, improved coordination and collaboration along with improved trust alleviate the
123

effect of barriers to circular economy (CE) adoption i.e., BT could act as an enabler of CE.
Kshetri (2022) analysed multiple case studies of BT in mineral/metal industry and found
that BT increased the flow of authentic information in the SC. Shen et al. (2022) modelled
a situation aimed at combating copycats. It was found that the firm deploying BT tended
to reduce the quality of products (Tao et al., 2022) as more quality didn’t bring more prof-
its as the consumer already differentiated between an imitation and a genuine product as a
consequence of BT. Paul et al. (2022a) via their event study reported that BT enabled SC
firms during Covid-19 pandemic stayed safe from significant valuation loss and volatility of
market. Paul et al. (2022a, 2022b) through their survey in tea industry found BT impacted
transparency, traceability positively which further improved goal of having circular SC and
high performance. Philsoophian et al. (2022) surveyed about the impact of BT on SC perfor-
mance. The study found that two features of BT transparency and security highly impacted
mediating role of BT between knowledge sharing and SC performance. Kusi-Sarpong et al.
(2022) also reported BT successfully mediated between intellectual capital and sustainable
production. Tan et al. (2022a) employed case-study method with underlying theoretical base
of agency and institutional theories in case of Halal SC in Malaysia. They found out that
the firms utilising BT were able to ensure transparency and traceability throughout SC as
BT helped firms within the SC to access and manage transaction details without any delays.
In addition to that, firms ensured that halal religious requirements were met using a smart
contract and sensors or RFID tags. Tian et al. (2022) conducted field experiments and found
that BT solved issues related to operational efficiency by utilising features of immutability
and traceability. Treiblmaier and Garaus (2022) conducted two experiments in food SC and
identified that BT’s traceability helped to establish product quality in consumers perception
and lead to a purchase intention.
This theme has seen several works focused on game theoretical modelling, simulations,
experiments, real word case studies from industry and results have been extremely promising.
From improving trust, transparency, traceability to SC performance (Philsoophian et al.,
2022) and increase in profits, BT provides a fresh look at how a technology can be significant
by moving beyond its stereotypical features of tracking and tracing.
4.1.4 Application theme/perspective
This theme/perspective relates to the applications of BT in SC while also integrating with
newer technologies. It also explores phenomena such as resilience, sustainability, green,
circular SCas the future application areas. Thepotential SCapplication areas forBTdiscussed
in the literature are Food SC (Behnke& Janssen, 2020; Bumblauskas et al., 2020; Kittipanya-
ngam & Tan, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Vivaldini, 2021a), Agricultural SC (Hu et al., 2021; Liu
et al., 2020; Mishra & Maheshwari, 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2021), SC Risk Management
(Choi et al., 2019;Manupati et al., 2022;Rauniyar et al., 2022; Shashi et al., 2020), Sustainable
SC (Gong et al., 2022b; Khan et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2021c; Wang et al., 2022; Xia et al.,
2021), etc. 65 studies fall under this heading as listen in Table 17. Table 18 lists major areas to
be explored under the application theme. Table 19 lists theories utilised under the application
theme. Table 20 lists BT features mentioned under application theme.
Min (2019) proposed supply chain resilience (SCRES) as a potential application area
According to the study, BT has the potential to alleviate risks and uncertainty and enhance
SCRES with the help of its features of immutability, traceability, risk management and smart
contracts. Wang et al. (2019a) argued that future research on BT application in SC would
focus on extending the provision of automated visibility/transparency, traceability (track
and trace) (Kumar et al., 2022b) to all the relevant stakeholders in SC to build trust by

removing any disintermediation especially in SC’s related to crucial artifacts such as vac-
cine, diamonds, luxury items, etc. This is because as the implementation scale increases so
does the need to be transparent and traceable. Behnke and Janssen (2020) propounded BT
as a highly efficient information traceability system. The study proposed a set of bound-
ary conditions so that the implementation of BT becomes practical. Schmidt and Wagner
(2019) suggested to explore the effect of BT implementation on relationship structures, dis-
intermediation through various theoretical lenses such as agency theory and network theory.
Cole et al. (2019) listed out numerous application areas such as product safety and secu-
rity, quality management, reduction of counterfeiting, automation of contracts, new product
development, and reduction of intermediaries. Pournader et al. (2020) in line with Saberi
et al. (2019) and Babich snd Hilary (2020) proposed few application areas such as procure-
ment, contracting, trust in buyer–supplier relationship, SC governance, SC risk management,
sustainable SC, etc. Bumblauskas et al. (2020) suggested that food distribution as the target
area of application specifically the egg SC in case of Europe. The study proposed use of
Hyperledger Sawtooth by utilising proof of elapsed time consensus mechanism and thus,

hopes to contribute to food traceability domain. Montecchi et al. (2019) argued enhancing
provenance could be a potential application area as it focuses on reducing the uncertainty
about authenticity, custody, intergrity and orgin. Dutta et al. (2020) through their literature
review identified various industries that could be revamped by implementing BT such as agri-
culture, energy, finance, food, shipping, etc. They argued that improvements in transparency,
traceability, business processes, etc. would revamp the listed industries. Counterfeits, clones
are a huge problem in cross border e-commerce trade and as such present an application
area for BT to solve the problem (de Boissieu et al., 2021; Liu & Li, 2020). Hald and Kinra
(2019) posit that BT can solve the problems related to contract management, SC governance,
structural complexity, SC coordination, and data inconsistencies. Rodríguez-Espíndola et al.
(2020) explored the possibility of applying BT along with other technologies such as arti-
ficial intelligence in humanitarian logistics. The study suggested that BT due to its features
of immutability, decentralised character, smart contracts present a very attractive application
area alongwith other leading technologies while having a strong case of improving data accu-
racy needs, accountability, tracking ability and real-time transparency. Kopyto et al. (2020)
predicted that by the year 2035 BTwill be applied to SC. The study discussed howBTwill be
applied to SC by developing and discussing the projections that were rated by Delphi experts
depending on factors such as probability of desirability, impact, and occurrence. Asante et al.
(2021) argued that BT demonstrates huge potential to improve cyber-resilience, traceabil-
ity, transparency, trust while integrating with other technologies in data-driven operations.
Bechtsis et al. (2021) argued that data-driven technology such as BT provide an impetus
to improve SC operations, security, resilience, and sustainability. Kayikci et al. (2021) pro-
posed that BT application of immutability, traceability, transparency, and smart contracts
could lead to operational excellence, effective collaboration, reduction of risks (Rauniyar
et al., 2022), increased responsiveness and flexibility. Rejeb et al. (2021) argued facilitat-
ing accountability, auditability, data consistency, transparency and traceability are the main
focal application areas of BT in future SC’s. The study pointed out a need for enhanced col-
laboration while overcoming vulnerabilities related to legacy technologies. Continuing with
vulnerabilities and disruptions, Raj Kumar Reddy et al. (2021) pointed out that BT could
address issues related to uncertainties in automotive SC by enabling and enhancing trace-
ability, transparency, visibility for an effiicient automotive SC. Karamchandani et al. (2021)
conducted a survey in manufacturing SC and found that blockchain would play a greater
role in reliable delivery and mass customisation of products. Friedman and Ormiston (2022)
posit that BT favours sustainability and fairer SC with better food traceability. However,
Khan et al. (2022b) reported that BT doesn’t directly impact SC sustainability but could be
indirectly achieved through SC Integration (Wang et al., 2022) and SC Mapping. Hrouga
et al. (2022) assert that BTs features of immutability, transparency and smart contract would
impact strategic SC partnership efficiency and growth which would further impact the SC
performance and, hence, report SC partnerships as an area of application of BT. Khan et al.
(2022a) reported that BT application in agricultural SC could enable integrity and trust, fraud
and counterfeit prevention, traceability and transparency along with reliable data retrieval.
Gong et al. (2022a) argued that BT presents a potential application in recycling SC for debris
management and sustainability as its features of high traceability and transparency with the
application of smart contract would be effective in establishing a global recycling network.

4.2 Blockchain technology and SC resilience (SCRES)
PONOMAROVandHolcomb (2009) define supply chain resilience (SCRES) as the “adaptive
capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to disruptions, and
recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at the desired level of connected-
ness and control over structure and function”. Tukamuhabwa et al. (2015) summarised a set
proactive and reactive strategies of SCRES. Among the most prominent SCRES strategies

use of information technology to enhance connectivity, visibility, collaboration, flexibility,
agility, creating risk management culture, building security, and creating appropriate con-
tractual agreements were discussed. Table 22 lists 12 studies that have explored BT in context
of SCRES.
Min (2019) proposed SCRES as a potential application area of blockchain technology
(BT). According to the study, BT has the potential to alleviate risks and uncertainty and
enhance SCRES with the help of its features of immutability, traceability, risk management

and smart contracts (Iftikhar et al., 2022). Dubey et al. (2020) argued that BT could be
successfully utilised to enhance transparency, swift trust (Shayganmehr et al., 2021), and
further improve collaboration along with improved supply chain resilience (SCRES) in a
humanitarian SC. Lohmer et al. (2020) utilised agent-based simulation model to analyse the
impact of BT on disruptions and SCRES. The simulation indicated that BT successfully pro-
motes SCRES and its aligned strategies if smart contracts were employed for collaboration
under risk. Casino et al. (2021) proposed a BT-enabled traceability framework. The study
implied that utilising BT had several benefits that include efficiency (minimisation of cost,
more automation, and less paperwork); trust (accountability, auditability, and immutability);
quality (process, product, and verifiability) and resilience (business continuity, decentralisa-
tion, and security). The study further accounts for SCRES by offering more benefits such as
removing systemic and geographic boundaries while also enabling integration of different
traceability data in SC. Nandi et al. (2021) call for creating BT capabilities and resources
to improve SCRES. The study aims at developing L–A–D capabilities (localization, agility,
and digitalization) by integrating BT-enabled circular economy system. The L–A–D capabil-
ities then help in establishing SCRES as it provides a mechanism to respond to disruptions.
Mukherjee et al. (2021) listed building SCRES as one of the benefits of BT-enabled SC. For
SC to be resilient, accurate forecasting capabilities, visibility and real-time information shar-
ing (Wong et al., 2021) are necessary and it in this respect, BT is instrumental in establishing
enhanced anticipation, visibility and adaptable capabilities among stakeholders in SC (Pan
et al., 2020). Vivaldini and de Sousa (2021) enlisted BT connectivity inhibitors that affect
SCRES and SC interaction. In this aspect, the study lists 3 major inhibitors: coordination,
technology understanding, and resources involved, and called for improving SCRES via BT
enabled SC Interaction. Sharma et al. (2021a) derived twelve BT-enabled resilient strategies
from the literature to enhance efficiency, survivability, and performance of food SC. The
study found that BT based strategies such as flexibility, visibility and the change in network
structure are the most effective strategies to fight disruption and enhance SCRES. Razak
et al. (2021) propounded traceability system such as BT as an enabler of SCRES. The study
mentioned the direct and indirect impacts of traceability on SCRES. In the direct impact
case, BT-enabled traceability could be used as risk-identification tool while as BT-enabled
traceability exhibits indirect role by enhancing formative elements of SCRES such as col-
laboration, flexibility, velocity and visibility. Bechtsis et al. (2021) argued that data-driven
technology such as BT provide an impetus to improve SC operations, security, sustainability,
and ultimately SCRES (Kazancoglu et al., 2022). Narwane et al. (2021) identified improv-
ing SCRES as one of the enablers of BT adoption. This is due to the fact that BT is a
risk minimising disruptive technology (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2021). This was further supported
by Chowdhury et al. (2022) who mentioned SCRES as one of the constructs that creates
managers behavioural intention to adopt BT for managing risks.
Through this discussion, the study argues that there is a huge opportunity to empirically
explore effect of BT on SCRES, and explore how SCRES can act as one of the motivations
to implement BT in SC. This can be achieved by conducting empirical investigations to fill
void in the literature.
5 Discussion
This study aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature by conducting
systematic literature review (SLR) on the lens of blockchain (BT) application in supply
123
Annals of Operations Research
chain. While conducting the review, it was found that blockchain in SC research has recently
evolved as a highly researched area from 2017 (Dutta et al., 2020). The study shortlisted all
the relevant studies based on the set review protocol and hence, developed a profile of top
peer-reviewed journals along with the articles published in such journals. The study con-
ducted descriptive analyses along with a rigorous content analysis of the articles to showcase
the knowledge in a comprehensive yet in-depth manner. Hence, this led to a synthesis of
knowledge that encapsulates journey of BT in SC from ideation to the implementation and
the future application. Furthermore, the study explored the probable effects of BT on SC inte-
gration, collaboration, resilience, sustainability, and performance that provide directions for
significant research opportunities to the researchers while also shedding light on significant
managerial implications.
5.1 Theoretical contributions
This study contributes by proposing a guiding framework to identify studies that involve
latest technologies such as blockchain (BT) and fitting them to a set of four specific themes
or perspectives of the evolution of research in the domain. Such classification could be critical
to understand the state of technology in academia and industry i.e., whether the technology is
still in its nascent stage or if it has matured into an industry-wide accepted and implemented
technology. In case of BT, the technology is still in its initial acceptance and implementation
phase and promises to be an industry disruptive technology (Pournader et al., 2020). The
study also identified top peer-reviewed publishing journals which also ensures the relevance
of the research domain as most of the top journals are publishing the content on BT in SC.
The study further contributes by identifying the leading industries of the world employing
BT in their SC. It was identified that food industry has found its application in traceability,
provenance, food security and establishing trust and transparency. The study established
that very less empirical based survey studies have been conducted. This identification of
gap has led to propositions and a conceptual framework for the future empirical testing and
hence, provides a future research direction as well at the conclusion of the article. While
many articles have talked about BT enablers/drivers and barriers, and explored them using
interpretive logic, it becomes pertinent to understand the actual impact of these factors on
BT enabled SC. So, the study proposes an industry wide organizational point of view to
study the impact of such factors and go beyond just identification. Furthermore, the study
identified theories utilised in the literature as well as the features of blockchain that are most
talked about in articles. While going through the theories, it was found game theory, TAM,
TOE, etc. as the most utilised theories and they have been utilised in context of adoption
and possible implications of implementing BT in SC. This indicates that BT in SC research
is attracting researchers apply a diverse set of theories and stimulates further research by
applying theories to understand the impact of BT on SC Integration, SC Collaboration, SC
Resilience (Cui et al., 2022) and ultimately SC Performance. In case of features, traceability,
transparency, and trust are the most talked about ones. While traceability and transparency
are usual suspects in case of food SC, trust happens to be the epitome of the BT enabled SC
(Yavaprabhas et al., 2022).
5.2 Managerial implications
Our study has the followingmanagerial implications: first, it provides an insight and direction
to practitioners to understand the state of their industry in case of BT adoption and hence,
123
Annals of Operations Research
utilise four perspectives ranging from pre-adoption perspective (focused on intention of man-
agers and the requirements of adoption) to the future research applications (focused on future
research empirical studies, industries, features, sustainability, resilience and performance).
Second, it provides impetus to exploring industry wide BT enabled trust mechanisms for
managers while exploring applications in traceability, risk management, and transparency.
Third, it enables managers to take the decision of adoption based on their requirements
and critical success factors (the drivers or the barriers) along with the focus on reducing
their adoption costs and increasing profits from utilising the BT while increasing the SC
Performance, and SC Resilience to act as an anti-disruption technology. Fourth, the study
contributes by enabling managers to understand whether the BT features identified in the
four themes match their industry requirements and hence, provide a direction towards the
adoption and implementation of BT in their firms.
6 Conclusion and limitations
This study provides a thorough review of 292 articles over a period of 5 years (2017–2022)
by utilising SLR. The main objective of this was to identify the state of articles published in
leading journals in context of BT in SC with year wise, journal wise, industry wise classi-
fications, etc. while offering the future research direction as well. The study proposed four
theme/perspective framework. This framework helps to understand the state of BT in SC
both academically and industry wise. The study identified that very few pilot projects have
been undertaken in industry while food industry has been the leading industry to employ BT
in their SC for traceability and transparency purposes. Furthermore, the nature of findings
highlights a need to have studies focused on trust, risk management, and development and
implementation of smart contracts in SC. Each of the four themes summarises the BT features
explored, theories discussed and utilised and the findings of the articles under each theme.
Application theme itself caters to the future research possibilities and lends a good direction
to scholars in identifying future key BT features as well as their application in critical SC
areas. This study also adds value by summarising the possible application areas such as SC
risk management, SC Integration, SC Collaboration, Circular Economy, Sustainability, SC
Resilience and SC Performance. However, our study has a few limitations. The study didn’t
consider grey literature, conference papers and books which at times could also contain
advanced knowledge regarding the blockchain. The self-developed guiding framework is not
absolute. However, it provides a pathway to understand the evolution and application of any
new technology in industry and research.
7 Future research agenda
Based on the critical analysis of literature of BT in SC, this study proposes future research
agenda to continue the advancement of the discipline and to address the unanswered questions
for both management scholars as well as the practitioners. Our extensive review emphasizes
that BT has a huge potential in changing the way actors manage a SC especially in tracking
and tracing of products, ensuring transparency, building trust, managing risks, and developing
a secure SC environment. The critical review further expands the horizon of application of
BT and going beyond the tracking and tracing in different industries such as construction,
retail, pharmaceutical, waste management, etc.

To organize our research agenda, we utilise Whetten (1989) “5W and 1H approach” i.e.,
“what, who, why, when, where and how”. Table 23 summarises the agenda.
• What. This section proposes to explore the enablers/drivers and barriers related to BT
adoption and implementation specifically with regard to areas of sustainability, circular
economy, resilience and SC integration (Chowdhury et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2022a;
Oropallo et al., 2021; Tsolakis et al., 2021). This would address the question, “What critical
factors would drive or inhibit an organization to adopt and implement BT to address the
issues of sustainability, circular economy and resilience?”. It also addresses the question,
“What are the motivations and intentions of the SC managers to adopt BT?”. Furthermore,

Annals of Operations Research
a dearth of empirical investigations on impact of BT on SC leads us to believe that there
are numerous opportunities to develop constructs along with the empirical measures to
characterize impact of BT constructs on SC constructs and moving beyond the exploration
of drivers and barriers.
• Why: Through this section, the study draws up questions related to the motivational
factors behind the adoption and implementation of BT as well as the implications on
socio-economic fabric. One of the prime reasons to adopt and implement BT is to ensure
trustworthiness to improve SC relationships and integration, no matter how debatable the
topic itself is. It is further accompanied by the need of information transparency that
is rather decentralized. Individuals today tend to shy away from traditional centralized
scheme of authority especially in situations of crisis and are keen to get access to sensitive
or well-kept information by the powerful entities (Lumineau et al., 2021). Such access to
decentralized, transparent schema exudes a sense of trust that BT brings in. Another moti-
vation to adopt and implement BT is minimization of risk and frauds. Hence, scholars can
explore questions such as “Why would BT generated transparency and trust lead to better
SC relationships, SC integration and SC performance?”. To answer the questions, scholars
can explore various theories to address the issues of “causality, explanation, prediction and
generalization” from various disciplines such as information sciences and utilise theories
such as social exchange theory (Wang et al., 2021b), institutional theory (Hartley et al.,
2022), resource based view (Wamba&Queiroz, 2022), transaction cost economics (Roeck
et al., 2020), etc. (Dubey et al., 2022).
• How: This section directs our attention to questions related to conduct of investigations
related to underlying processes explaining impact of BT on SC i.e., methods and method-
ologies. There is a debate on the privacy, security, confidentiality vs transparency issue of
BT (Xu et al., 2021a). Pandey et al. (2022) reported that BT helps in managing risks but
didn’t come up with the explanation for it. Furthermore, there is a deficit on understanding
of mechanism of smart contract established trust (Oropallo et al., 2021). Thus, we propose
following questions arising from this section.
1. “How are managers going to tackle the issue of privacy vs transparency issue arising
in BT-enabled SC?”
2. “Does implementation of smart contracts establish trust, if yes then how?”
3. “How does BT enhance risk management in a SC?”.
Clearly, we lack empirical studies that address such questions. We also see scope of
utilising multiple or mixed methods to generate both qualitative as well as quantitative
data to address these questions.
• Who: An important aspect of blockchain is that it brings those people into collaborative,
trustworthy environment that are essentially strangers to build an interorganizational trust
(Yavaprabhas et al., 2022). This has a huge potential for certain actors who seek enhanced
cooperation, coordination and collaboration to solve crisis situations especially in case of
humanitarian concerns that require swift-trust among the stakeholders (Dubey et al., 2020).
Going away with the intermediaries is a benefit of BT and smart-contracts (Christidis &
Devetsikiotis, 2016). Thus, first question for scholars is, “Who will feel a higher impact of
BT adoption and implementation, intermediaries or the rest of the stakeholders?”. Second,
“Will BT adoption and implementation adversely affect the existing relationships between
the stakeholders in a SC?”. Such questions need to be addressed as BT could also adversely
affect the existing business models.

• When: It is an important decision for any firm to decide on the timing of adoption and
implementation and as suchmore critical to decide when not to. It should also be noted that
BT is not necessarily a standalone technology and as such, would do better if integrated
with other industry 4.0 technologies (Kamble et al., 2019). For the scholars, questions to
address are 1) "When is it right for the firms/organisations/entities to adopt and implement
BT?” 2) “When should BT be integrated with I4.0 technologies?”. Furthermore, studies
focus too much on traceability and transparency features of BT especially in food SC
(Kittipanya-ngam & Tan, 2020; Razak et al., 2021). However, BT has the potential to
go beyond this tracking and tracing. Hence, following question needs to be addressed as
well, “When will organisations look beyond tracking and tracing properties of BT?”. This
question sounds more critical because BT has been touted as the “potentially disruptive
technology” (Sengupta et al., 2021) which is however, yet to be established.
• Where: This section reflects the context and the application areas of BT while considering
geographical, technological infrastructure, political, socio-economical, cultural, and legal
structure influence.Montecchi et al. (2019) argued enhancing provenance could be a poten-
tial application area as it focuses on reducing the uncertainty about authenticity, custody,
intergrity and orgin. In a similar way. Cole et al. (2019) listed out numerous application
areas such as product safety and security, quality management, reduction of counterfeit-
ing, automation of contracts, new product development, and reduction of intermediaries.
Keeping in mind the factors that could dictate application of BT, following question needs
to be addressed, “Will the PESTLE dimensions influence and dictate the application of
BT in SC?”. Another question that needs to be answered is, “Which new application areas
are to be identified where in legacy technologies can either be replaced or supplemented
with BT?”.
This study also calls for and develops propositions represented as a consolidated concep-
tual framework/theoretical model for future empirical testing because of two reasons: (1) the
infancy of BT research in this domain (Queiroz et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019a) and (2) a
lack of empirical evidence in BT in SC domain (Caldarelli et al., 2021; Chowdhury et al.,
2022; Cole et al., 2019; Roeck et al., 2020).
Although, many studies have argued and proposed the benefits of implementing BT
in SC, few have been able to empirically validate them. Studies have proposed that BT
leads to improved traceability (Erol et al., 2022; Hald & Kinra, 2019); security (Min, 2019;
Philsoophian et al., 2022); transparency/visibility (Dubey et al., 2020; Pournader et al., 2020);
risk management (Lohmer et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2022), provenance (Montecchi et al.,
2019; Roeck et al., 2020); and privacy (Fosso Wamba et al., 2020a; Shen et al., 2022).
Montecchi et al. (2019) argued that BT enhanced provenance reduced uncertainty about
authenticity, custody, intergrity and orgin which meant an establishment of trust is achiev-
able. It was also observed that better risk management (Laeequddin et al., 2009), improved
privacy and security instill trust among the partners of a SC (Oropallo et al., 2021). Köhler and
Pizzol (2020) posited that enhanced transparency and traceability lead to trust which in turn
lead to increased SC Collaboration (Erol et al., 2022), SC Integration (Zhang & Huo, 2013)
and SC Resilience (Dubey et al., 2020). Chunsheng et al. (2020) argued that SC integration
had high effect on SC Resilience while also impacting the SC performance. M. Chowdhury
et al. (2019) proposed that SC resilience is likely going to enhance SC performance. Cao
and Zhang (2011) indicated that SC collaboration had a bottom-line on a firm’s performance.
Khan et al. (2022b) mentioned that BT doesn’t directly impact SC sustainability. However,
it could be indirectly achieved through SC Integration (Wang et al., 2022).

Fig. 4 Theoretical model
Since, there is a lack of empirical evidence in case of effect of BT on the features discussed
and the effect of BT-enabled trust on SC integration, collaboration, sustainability, resilience,
and performance, we propose the following set of propositions based on the above discussion
and develop a theoretical model based on the propositions. Figure 4 presents the theoretical
model.
P1: Blockchain technology (BT) implementation in SC enhances security, trans-
parency/visibility, traceability, risk management, provenance, and privacy.
P2: BT features of immutability, security, transparency/visibility, traceability, risk manage-
ment, provenance, smart contract, and privacy have a positive impact on trust.
P3: BT-enabled trust and application of smart contracts positively impact SC Collaboration.
P4: BT-enabled trust positively impacts SC Integration.
P5: SC Collaboration and SC Integration as a consequence of BT enabled trust positively
impact SCRES and SC Performance.
P6: BT-enabled SCRES positively influences SC Performance.
P7: BT-enabled SC Integration can induce motivations for sustainability.
