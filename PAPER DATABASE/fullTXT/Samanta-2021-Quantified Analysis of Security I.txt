Abstract. Storing data in the Blockchain is indeed one of the good security mea-
sures for data. However, blockchain itself could be under different types of security
threats. The mining of the block into the longest chain is a constrained task. Typ-
ically, the nodes having high investments are selected as potential miners in the
blockchain. A miner or a pool of miners is assigned for this mining job. The
challenge lies in working with the honest miners against the continuous negative
influence of dishonest miners. There have been considerable efforts in the existing
literature that tries to overcome such security threats. Game theory is used and
incorporated towards this by many researchers. This manuscript aims to analyze
different security threats of blockchain mining and the possible approaches that
have claimed to overcome these. We also analyzed and correlated some of the
selected well-cited solution approaches that uses game theory and presented a
comparative performance analysis among those.

1 Introduction
Security and transparency of data are among the primary aspects behind introducing
the blockchain (BC) technology. Using the blockchain technology the distributed, pair
to pair ledger is made available to all the authorized users within the network in a
secured manner. Blockchain technology is used by blending multiple technologies like
pair to pair network, distributed and decentralized network technology, cryptography,
etc. [3]. A blockchainmay be public or private. The transactions are generated as a block.
Subsequently, the blocks are verified before these are appended to the longest chain in the
network. Each block contains a block header. The block header contains a hash function.
This hash value is the main building key-window of blockchain technology. The hash
value of the block itself is one of the main security issues as well as a solution to the
network. Transactions done by the users are stored within the blockchain. The writing

responsibility of the block is normally assigned to the selected nodes of the network
called miners or set of miner pools. The miners are selected depending upon the various
protocols and consensus algorithms. Theminers are also interested towrite the block into
the blockchain for their incentives. The transaction fees paid by the transaction blocks
are the main incentives of the miner blocks [12]. The security issues of the blockchain
are quite much dependent on the performance of the miners. The question arises that at
what extent the miners are trustable. Different protocols and consensus algorithms, used
in blockchain, are indeed quite matured to identify any dishonest miner, at the instant of
any mining process. However, the major threat to blockchain security could be due to
the selection of a dishonest miner pool for the process of mining.
The intensive and the deep study give us a specific idea about the security attack
experienced by the blockchain at the time of mining of the block. In this particular
paper, we analyzed a different kind of security threats faced by the blockchain and
also different approaches to overcome this threat using game theory. We also tried to
correlate the result of paper [4] and paper [6] and also analyzed the possible outcomes.
The comparative analysis of both the paper is presented at the end.
2 Existing Security Issues in the Blockchain
The prime objectives of blockchain technology are the security, transparency, and trust-
worthiness of transactions and data. Based on the detailed and intensive study on the
blockchain, we infer that blockchain is still suffering from various security issues that
are presented below.
2.1 Security Issues
2.1.1 51% Vulnerability Issue
The mining power is assigned to the selected nodes in the blockchain network, based on
a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). If the strength of a mining pool
increases more than 50% of the entire selections, then the said pool becomes the miner
controlling pool of the chain. If the dishonest miners achieved a majority of 51%, then
the hashing control would be a serious security threat for the chain [6, 9].
2.1.2 Double Spending Issue
The mining process (PoW based) is time-consuming. In case of bitcoin, the average
mining time of a transaction block is 10 min or more. The dishonest users of the network
generally used the same currency (or cryptocurrency) for multiple transactions. This
double-spending attack has a fairly high probability of chances due to the short time
interval between the two transactions and a long time interval between the receiving of
mining acknowledgment of the transactions [11].
2.1.3 Mining Pool Attack Issue
This kind of attack increases the time interval of assigning mining control to the selected
miners. The internal pool is attacked by dishonest miners to collect more rewards. The
Quantified Analysis of Security Issues and Its Mitigation in Blockchain 5
miner then functions maliciously. In case of an external mining pool, the dishonest miner
applies higher hashing power to organize a double attack [7, 8].
2.1.4 Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) Issues
In the blockchain, the target of theDDoS attack is to retardate the efficiency and activities
of theminer pool so that their operation can be disturbed or made to function at a reduced
level [4, 5].
2.1.5 Client-Side Security Threats
Theblockchain networksmaintain public andprivate keyvalues tomanageuser accounts.
The loss of private keys is also a threat to client-side security [7].
2.1.6 Forking Issue
The software that supports the blockchain framework usually requires system up-
gradation from time to time. The upgradations may be in terms of hardware, change
in the policy of software, or may change in rules of the blockchain. The existing nodes
in the network adopting the new upgraded policy and rules form a new blockchain.
The nodes that did not upgrade themselves remain in the old chain. There is a lack of
compatibility, mutual agreement, and stability between the old and new versions of the
chains. That is also a threat to the entire blockchain system [2].
2.1.7 Private Key Security Issues
The private key of the users is one of the security measures in blockchain technology.
It describes the credibility of the user. The loss or theft of private keys is a threat to the
user as well as the blockchain, as it is not possible to recover the private key by any
alternative measure [2].
2.1.8 Criminal Activity Issues
Blockchain suffers from so many criminal threats like bribing, hacking transactions, and
extortion money by incorporating “Ransomware” etc. [2].
2.2 Game Theory
“A game is any situation in which players (the participants) make strategic decisions
- i.e., decisions that take into account each other’s actions and responses” [1]. All the
strategic decisions have connected pay-offs that result in rewards or benefits for the
players. The players are the decision-makers of their own and always choose strategies
towards optimization of payoffs by utilizing the available sets of strategies. In-game
theory, it is also considered that the players are rational and their decisions are also
rational. Some of the well-known game types are mentioned below.

1. Non-Cooperative Game    2. Cooperative Game 
3. Splitting Game       4. Mean-Payoff game 
5. Stochastic Game      6. Cournot Game 
7. Stackelberg Game      8. Sequential Game 
9. Repeated Game       10. Coordination Game 
3 Literature Review
In paper [3], a dynamic Bitcoin (BTC) mining process is proposed. The mining powers
(electricity) are invested by respective miners. In this paper, one block is mined by a
particular miner. The proposed process is described by incorporating the game theory.
The miner writes the block into the chain wins the game among all miners. The co-
operative and non-cooperative strategies are used by the miners for the mining process.
Three dynamic components of game theoretical models are proposed to find the solu-
tions. These three components are Social optimum, Nash equilibrium, and myopic Nash
equilibrium.
a. Social optimum
The co-operation strategy is taken by each miner separately or in the pool to consume
the energy to compute. The incentive (pay-off) is distributed equally among each miner
in the pool.
b. Nash equilibrium
The non-co-operation (selfish mining) strategy is adopted to maximize the gain of each
miner and the pay-off is calculated accordingly.
c. myopic Nash equilibrium
Multiple players (miners) can participate in this dynamic game tomaximize one’s pay-off
with the negligible influence of the present state of the miners.
The consumed electric power is invested jointly by all the miners to participate in
the mining process. The wasting of the electrical power by all the miners excluding the
miner that owned the game and writes the block into the longest chain. The wastage of
electricity (power) consumed is the main problem definition in this paper during mining
as the main threat. The proposed solutions claimed that the profit of the miners at an
optimum level in case of a cooperative game strategy.
The miner nodes in the mining pool increase their outputs either by cooperating with
the mining pool or by investing additional resources and the addressing of the threat of
DDoS in the blockchain is done in paper [4]. How the dishonest mining pools stimulate
to degrade the efficiency of the actual mining pools to build the confidence of the next
PoW has been analyzed. This is done either by increasing the resource of dishonest
minor pool or in some other menacing ways. To analyze the fact, non-cooperative game
theory has been chosen. Two different sized mining pools are considered as the two
players - S (small) and B(big) pool respectively. The strategical pay-off matrix has been
calculated and the best strategy is described through Nash Equilibrium. The result of
the paper states that the incentive is much more for attacking B-pool by removing one
or more miners from the pool than by attacking the S-pool. (Large pool attack = 63%,
Quantified Analysis of Security Issues and Its Mitigation in Blockchain 7
Small pool attack = 17%), i.e. the S-pool makes a higher gain by attacking the B-pool
than the gain B-pool makes by attacking S-pool. This paper describes the primary focus
of to reduce the performance and hampered the effectiveness by DDoS attack.
1. The operation of the computing mining pool slower down.
2. Encourage individual miners to associate with the dishonest mining pool.
In the proposed model the baseline cost of failure the attack in blockchain mining
has been discussed. The impact of the miners of the choice of different investment has
also been analyzed.
In paper [5], a long term mining strategy of blockchain through repeated games has
been introduced. The objective is to give incentive to an honest miner and simultaneously
penalize a dishonest miner. After each iteration of the game, the “reputation” of the
miners are measured. This paper primarily addresses the DDoS attack of the type.
1. Block withholding attack: where the dishonest miner provides a partial solution
of verifications. The total solution is provided to the entire pool with a partial
contribution to each and earns the incentive without effective investment.
2. Selfish mining or Stubborn mining: a miner (or group of miners) increases their
revenue by strategically withholding and releasing blocks to the network. Typically,
we expect aminer to announce a block as soon as theyfind it. If the block is confirmed,
they will get the block reward.
3. Eclipse attack: the attack aims to obscure a participant’s view of the peer-to-peer
network, to cause general disruption or disturbed the performance.
A concept of aminer manager is introduced in this model. Theminer manager invites
the subset of the miner pool for mining. The Nash equilibrium is reached by eliminating
the strictly dominating strategy.
In paper [6], a model of sequential game theory is developed to address the DDoS
attack on the mining pool. The model describes the short term as well as the long term
attacking effects of mining pools. The threshold value of non-attacking incentives and
the passive intensive of partial attacking is calculated. The conditions of no-incentive
(attack) and incentive (no-attack) are calculated accordingly. This model is calculating
the cost (fixed cost as well as variable cost) of the attack. A defensive mechanism is
incorporated to calculate the unit cost of attacking. After each round, the miner can
migrate from one pool to another according to its regaining strategies. In each round,
the miner can go for the attack to lose its incentive as a short term effect. The miner
can go for a long-term migration effect to give consistency for the next round, to reach
a steady-state of Nash equilibrium. On violating that when one miner is attacking the
other one, the Nash equilibrium deviated.
In paper [7], a punishment mechanism is proposed to the devices of edge networks
rather than the miner pool of Blockchain. When a request or DoS attack on the server is
encountered by a device of edge network, the server may give the output of the request
or punish the device. Amodel is developed for this punishment mechanism through non-
cooperative game theory. Both the device and the server can adapt its strategy depending
on the history recorded in the blockchain. This model states that to achieve themaximum
8 A. K. Samanta et al.
gain both the players (edge device and server) will not attack each other, because of the
extensive punishment mechanism. This non-attacking response brings the game to the
horizon of the Nash equilibrium.
In paper [8], a decentralized protocol of mining is proposed where the validator
does not consider the Proof of Work (PoW). The validator is chosen from a random set
and size to overcome Benzamine 1/3 (one-third) fault tolerance to minimize the attack.
Game theory has been used to resolve the problem. The validators were not selected
previously. The efficiency of the transaction is enhanced by allowing some of the miners
to mining work among the group of selected validators. Most of the emphasis has been
given on the selection procedure of the miners to a trade-off between the efficiency and
security of the chain.
In paper [9], a bribing aspect of a smart contract using the electronic voting system is
analyzed. The incentive (gain) is achieved by themining nodes bymining the transaction
of the smart contract of cryptocurrency. The transfer of bitcoin from one user to another
user in a smart contract is considered as bribes. The game theory used here is the “Smart
contract bribe game”. The type of risks are handled through a proposed election voting
model in two ways.
1. The identification of honest and dishonest bribers (mining nodes) function as the
miner of transactions of the smart contract.
2. The threshold budget value of bribers to achieve more than 50% vote is only possible
if the bribers control more than 20% of the Nash equilibrium.
In paper [10], the incorporation of the evolutionary game has been done. This paper
has explored the sharingmechanism tomaintain an optimumsecurity level in datamining
in smart contract applications. The strategy of handling of sharing of data (data mining)
using evolutionary game theory. The proposed model handle three situations.
1. Neither of the player sharing the data or not taking part in mining.
2. Both the player taking part in data sharing.
3. One player taking part in data sharing and the other user is not involving in data
sharing.
In paper [11], the Game theory is applied to Smart contract security enhancements.
This model proposed to make it decentralized under the strict vigil of its validator to
combat the challenger of validation. The paper analyzes and validates “Differentiated
Services Code Point (DSCP)” using the tool of smart contract “BITHALO’. The tool
has been designed by applying traditional mathematical methods and game theory. The
double-spending attack is primarily countered in this paper using game theory. This
protocol is used to the vigil at the time of deposit. It verifies the pre-requisite payment
amount exceeds the value of the goods to counter the double payment threat.
Authors in paper [12], have proposed to analyze the participation of the miner.
It analyses where the incentives are high for participating miners and marginally low
incentives for non-participants in the mining process. In a real sense that affects the
security measures of the blockchain. The analysis mechanism done here aims to find
out the gap in the mining process by incorporating “Gap Game”. The game contributes
Quantified Analysis of Security Issues and Its Mitigation in Blockchain 9
to finding out the average time quantum required for a miner to become active for the
honest mining process. The average incentive is assigned to the mining block. It assumes
a quasi-static system in which no miner can join or can go out of the respective pool
to reach the equilibrium system. The fixed set of miners controls an individual rig (the
mechanism used for the mining process, requires electrical power for its function). The
start of the rig is determined with a timestampmarking the point of time of conversion of
the status of the miner from inactive to active. This paper mainly deals with the mining
gap of the blockchain. The gap model considers only the operational expenses. The
block size in the blockchain is unbounded; the mining process includes all the pending
transactions in the process. When a block is generated, there would not be any pending
transactions and unclaimed fees. However, there would not be any incentive due to
the mining of the previous block, as there is a gap between the generation and mining
between the previous and next block of the blockchain. The findings of papers 3 to paper
12 are illustrated in the tabulated format in Table 1 below.
The Proof ofWork (PoW) is a complicated consensus algorithm, used for the mining
process of blockchain. It is used for data validation of legitimate transactions to avoid
security threats like DDoS and double-spending. In the selfish mining process, the com-
plicacy and energy-consuming amount of PoW is for hash generation. The miners are
competing with each other for their incentives. The complicacy and energy consumption
of the PoW system is much greater. The minimum time required to generate a block in
the PoW system is more than 10 min. That causes security threats as well.
4 Open Research Issues on Blockchain Security for Data Mining
The Blockchain uses the successful PoW consensus algorithm to secure the blockchain
network. Several new consensus algorithms have already been proposed and developed
meanwhile. Every algorithm has its own merits and demerits. The aspects are important
to understand which consensus algorithm is to be chosen for a specific case.
The study finds that each proposed model has merits and demerits. Our objective is
to propose such amodel where themaximum identified disadvantages can be eliminated.
The blockchain still has the following open research issues related to its security and
data mining concerned:
4.1. The security threats are regulated by honest and dishonest mining. Therefore there
is always a tussle between secure and insecure environments. Game is also a
competition of winners and losers. There may be a zero-zero status in between.
Hence a suitable game form needs to be proposed for suitable solutions. Therefore
we can explore avenues to sort out the maximum security issues of blockchain
through suitable game forms.
4.2. Themodelmaybe consideredwithout PoW.Alternately, theProof of Stake (PoS) or
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) or Proof of Capacity (PoC) or Proof of Authority
(PoA) or Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) or Proof of Importance (PoI) or some other
factor may be considered for future research work.
4.3. The blockchain contains multiple nodes in the network. The game form that will
be considered to overcome the security threats needs to be a multiplayer (nodes)
game.

[3] In reality, the miner has to work under security threat and the pay-off is much less in
this proposed model. In dynamic systems, past record PoWs are considered. The
model is silent about the present state action of the dishonest miner. The difference
between Nash equilibrium and Greedy Nash equilibrium in the non-cooperative
method is kept silent.
[4] In this proposed model, a player will use those strategies which are in binary mode.
The player either goes for mining or for DDoS attack to reduce the performance. The
model does not discuss the case where any player keeps silent without selecting any
strategy and hence does not conclude about how the Nash equilibrium will be affected
for the silent players. In case if the value of R is large enough the computational
pay-offs for both for the big(B) and small(S) miners ( B
(B+S+R)
and
S
(B+S+R)
respectively) will be reduced. So another problem is to determine the value
of R and how the Nash equilibrium will be maintained in respect to R. In the best
response strategies, if S goes for the DDoS attack then B’s best strategy also will be
the DDoS attack, that contradicts the actual mining interest of the blockchain.
[5] The introduction of a mining manager is also a good concept for extra vigilance. The
introduction of a mining manager will increase mining timing. What strategy will be
taken if the mining manager becomes dishonest; how it will affect the Nash
equilibrium have not been discussed. The result through any experimental setup or
simulation has not been stated for any set of data.
[6] The concept of the model that the big pool(B) will ways go for mining and the small
pool(S) always goes for the attack. This concept contradicts the denial attack of 51%
dishonest nodes. Migration from S to B increases the size of the mining pool, B.
When the migration happens from B to S the rate of DDoS will increase. In the case
of B becomes the dishonest pool then also the security threat will increase. What
strategy will be taken in this situation to combat security issues?
[7] The figures in Theorem-2 and Theorem-4 (fig-a and fig-b) show that the utilities or
actions of the server process also diminish along with the diminishing of the
performances of the device when the device is punished. In that case, the other read
operations of the server for miming will be affected (due to the reduction of
performance of the server). How this could be mapped with the security measures of
the blockchain? In the case of a multiple payer environment, the Nash equilibrium
may be violated.
[8] The type of risk or the threat that can be combated using the proposed algorithm is
also not cleared in the paper. What will be the criteria of a selection of actual miners
among the honest mining pools?
[9] In case of a successful smart contract less than Pj (bribing price), no solution is
provided. However, it is not clear how the figure of more than 20% control of the
overall budget is reached for a briber to conduct a 51% attack and how Nash
equilibrium will be affected.
(continued)

Ref no. Observations
[10] There may be another case of threat to the system where both the players participate
either with one player as honest and the other as dishonest or with both the players as
dishonest.
[11] The mechanism of addressing the double payment issue is silent in this paper.
[12] The equilibrium point in the quasi-static system cannot be maintained. Joining or
leaving cannot be restricted in a real scenario. The inclusion of the time component in
the incentives of the miner is a positive contribution to enhancing the security
mechanism in mining.
4.4. The introduction of a miner manager or validator leader in a mining process
increases the security measures [4, 8]. A suitable alternative also needs to be
considered in case of the dishonesty of the miner manager or validity leader.
4.5. Among the honest mining pools, some selected nodes will be allowed for mining
work [8] by applying a suitable strategy. This will increase mining efficiency.
4.6. A suitable methodology needs to be adopted so that the honest miners can gain
some incentives and the dishonest miner can get the punishment. It also needs to
record the silent player who is not taking part in miner voting and consider such a
player as a partially dishonest miner.
4.7. To increase the mining efficiency only some miners within the mining pool need
to be allowed for mining.
4.8. A strategy needs to be determined that allows threshold limit of the attack and to
determine a strategy in case the limit is crossed
4.9. The findings of other mining gaps and the introduction of time constraints can
enhance the security features and mining efficiency in blockchain technology. The
inclusion of time constraints also strengthens the desired model.
The authors feel that there’s a strong need for an efficient security model that
addresses, if not all, then most of the issues identified above. In Sect. 5, we have taken
two interesting existing models for further study.
5 Analysis of Simulation Result
After a thorough study,we try to analyze the result outputs of the above-mentioned papers
with their respective outcomes. In particular, we have considered two models proposed
by B. Johnson, A. Laszka and that are described in [4] and [6]. We have analyzed using
simulation and tried to present a critical comparison of these two models [4, 6]. A brief
definition of these models is included in Annexure 1 for the sake of completeness.
We recapitulate some of the definitions used in the two models [4, 6] for better
understanding of the simulation and for proper interpretation of the results. The big
and small size mining pools are represented by B and S respectively. R represents the
rest of the bitcoin mining market. The rate of increase in computation power is ε. The

Let, M ∈ [0, 1] be the rate of migration and C ∈ [0, 1] is the unit cost of attack. AB

Here, AB, AS ∈ [0, 1]∧ AB +AS ∈ [0, 1]. S(k)

5.1 Discussion on Simulation Result
The payoffmatrix of Table 3 [4] is converted into the corresponding data value for further
analysis. Figure 1a and Fig. 1b shows the graphical representation of the corresponding
data (Shown in [13]). It can be stated that in the Nash equilibrium strategy both B and
S will attack each other. However, the best strategy obtained whenever the ratio of B
and S is 80:20,70:30, 60:40 and even 50:50. The mining cost is best either S involved
in computing or B involved in computing. The value of mining incentive is much better
for B:S is 90:10 when the value of ε changes from 0.1 to 0.2.

In the enhanced model of [4] as stated in pay-off in Table 4, it is seen that (Fig. 2a,
Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c) the highest rate of attack incurredwhen the S go for computing and B
go for the attack. The attack in the enhanced approach is reduced in the CDs component.
However, the DCB component of mining of B is get reduced. In general concept, the
tendency of attack is increased in the respective areas of DDs and DDB which was nil
in the previous case. The computation value of S is decreasing for each size of S with
the increasing probability of attack (σ = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) respectively.
In the peaceful equilibrium in the proposed model [6], the unit cost of attack due to
migration has been shown in Fig. 3a (where, As = 0.2, AB = 0.3, as = 0, aB = 0 and
using Eq. 3a). The attacking cost is maximum (near about .6) when the migration rate is
0.1. The rate of the cost of attack reduces with the increased rate of migration until the
migration rate is 0.7. After this threshold value (0.7) of the migration rate, the attacking
cost remains the same.

In the case of one side attack equilibrium, the unit cost of attack slightly increases
with both the cases whether the attacker size as = 1(where As = 0.2, AB = 0.3, aB =
0 and using Eq. 3b) or the attacker size aB = 1 (where As = 0.2, AB = 0.3, as = 0 and
using Eq. 3c) shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c respectively.
The value of C is remained equal in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c after the migration rate is
0.7. The value of C is slightly higher in Fig. 3c (aB = 1) than that of Fig. 3b (aS = 1)
for the same set of values of As = 0.2, AB = 0.3, and M (i.e., migration rate is same in
both the figure).

Table 2. Critical comparison of models proposed in [4] and [6]
Sl. No Descriptions Proposed model [4] Proposed model [6]
1 Addressing issue(s) DDoS (by slowing down the
performance or motivating
the minor to be dishonest).
DDoS attack on the mining
pool is addressed.
2 Type of Game Theory
incorporated
A non-cooperative game is
used.
A sequential Game is used.
3 Mining Strategy PoW (increases either by
cooperating with other
miner or investing extra
power).
The computation utility
value U (k)
B and U (k)
S are
used after each round of k by
B and S respectively shown
in Eqs. 1a and 1b.
4 Pool Size of mines Arbitrarily chosen Big
honest pool (B) and small
dishonest pool (S). The
variation of size is not
reflected in the proposed
model.
The relative size of the
honest pool (S(k)
B ) and
dishonest pool (S(k)
S ) is
considered after each
iteration(k).
5 Cost incurred It is assumed that the cost to
invest or cost to attack is
negligible with respect to
the revenue of bitcoin.
The pay-off cost of B and S
is shown in Table 3.
The unit cost of the attack is
calculated.
The cost of an attack, non-
attack and partial attack are
also calculated.
6 Migration of B to S or
S to B pool
The migration or the
attraction of migration is
not considered distinctly.
After each round, the miner
can migrate from one pool to
another pool. At a particular
round k, the size of the miner
B and S are defined by
Eqs. 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d after
migration.
7 Attacking cost or other
evaluations
The attack is assumed to be
negligible concerning the
revenue of bitcoin.
The unit cost of an attack is
calculated in terms of fixed
and variable costs
8 Nash Equilibrium (NE) NE is both B and S will
attack each other.
NE is expressed through
Eq. 3b and 3c.
9 Efficiency The enhanced proposed
model reducing the overall
mining efficiency by
introducing DDoS attacks in
a different stage of mining.
The efficiency can be
achieved through a peaceful
equilibrium where there is no
size of the miner in attacking
strategy.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have analyzed some of the security solutions for blockchain mining
that have used different game theory approaches. We have presented graphical results
for simulation. We have also changed the values for the rate of increase in computation
power, ε from 0.1 to 0.2 (in case of the model represented in [4]) and the probability of
attack σ from 0.1 to 0.2 and 0.3 (in case of the model represented in [6]) to find out the
change in the behavioral response of the said models. The results are evident in Sect. 5.
With the increase of investment of mining resources, the profit increases up to a certain
limit before it saturates In a process of the non-cooperative game theory approach, we
have seen that the cost of computation is high when B goes for computing and S go for
attack for all combinations of B and S (80:20,70:30, 60:40, 50:50) excepting 90:10.With
the introduction of the probability of attack the mining value decreases. The introduction
of the pool manager and its invitation to the set of potential miners provide the extra
vigil to the mining security. It is shown that the unit cost of an attack decreases with the
increasing rate ofmigration to the attacking pools. In fact, after crossing a threshold value
of migration, the cost of attack does not change. In case of increasing the punishment
rate to the dishonest miner, the utility rate does not change. In future, we plan to focus
on the policy of selection of miners using game theory and also shall put an effort to find
out the threshold mining and attacking cost to eliminate the security threat of blockchain
mining in an improved way.
