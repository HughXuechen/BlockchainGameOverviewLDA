Clean energy projects have difficulties accessing finance. The transition to clean energy 
and accelerating investments in green projects require a game-changing approach, 
groundbreaking infrastructure, and pioneering green financing strategies. This article 
discusses the potential of blockchain technology in filling the green investment gap. Use 
cases related to the application of blockchain in green projects are analyzed. Blockchain 
technology can provide security, transparency, auditability, and traceability and help fill 
the green finance gap. 
I. Introduction   
Since the emergence of distributed ledger technologies 
(DLTs), including blockchain technology, the financial in-
dustry has witnessed a revolution as they promise innov-
ative decentralized solutions that could improve efficiency 
and transparency in many aspects (Centobelli et al., 2021; 
Naderi, 2021; Zhou et al., 2022). Blockchain technology has 
shown the potential to digitize the entire financial ecosys-
tem. Integrating blockchain-enabled tokenization and fi-
nance could lead to a more green and sustainable future. To 
accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set 
by the United Nations, new sources of finance and a broad 
spectrum of investors are required. Strategies on green fi-
nancing must be changed, and the capability of new tech-
nologies needs to be taken seriously. 
Green finance includes many financial products and ser-
vices, such as green bonds, green investment funds, carbon 
market, and energy trading, alongside initiative financial 
institutions, including green banks and green funds 
(Taghizadeh-Hesary & Yoshino, 2019). Since public bud-
gets in green finance are insufficient, the market must 
change its approach to accelerate the flow of capital and 
investments to green projects. Therefore, finance flows to 
green and sustainable investment should seize the atten-
tion of policymakers. Innovative financial instruments and 
new capital sources are needed to enable green finance to 
achieve global green targets. The importance of green fi-
nance is highlighted in the wake of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, since the world is experiencing a drastic drop in new 
investments in green projects. Blockchain-based solutions 
can mobilize and scale private capital and facilitate crowd 
collaboration and retail investments in green projects by 
increasing security, transparency, auditability, and trace-
ability (Yoshino et al., 2021). It is imperative to understand 
that these investment circumstances should not be ham-
pered by conventional financial challenges such as ineffi-
ciency, lack of transparency, and complex procedures. 
The G20 countries are expected to provide $97 trillion 
by 2040 for green infrastructure improvements and sus-
tainable developments (UNOPS, 2019). Even before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, sustainable investments were insuffi-
cient and much lower than the required amount. Since the 
pandemic, in the case of developing countries, the $2.5 tril-
lion annual SDG financing gap is predicted to increase due 
to global economic uncertainty (OECD, 2020). 
The energy sector has severe challenges in the current 
expedition to power the globe in the post-COVID-19 era. 
The main challenges include high greenhouse gas emis-
sions due to dependence on fossil fuels, difficulties in ac-
cessing finance due to the various risks associated with 
green projects, and the lower rate of return in green energy 
projects compared to fossil fuel projects. The practical 
adaptation of blockchain technology can address the diffi-
culties in accessing finance, the most significant disruptor 
since the emergence of the Internet (Dorfleitner et al., 
2021; Kowalski et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Potential use 
cases of blockchain in green finance with an emphasis on 
tokenizing green bonds will lead the market to greater ef-
ficiency and transparency in green investments. Tokenizing 
green assets and crowdfunding will involve retail investors

or donors in climate adaptation and sustainable finance. 
This paper aims to fill the literature gap on these issues. 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion II answers the question of how blockchain can power 
green finance. Section III explains how blockchain-based 
firms nurture green finance. Section IV illustrates the to-
kenization of green assets and green bonds. Section V an-
alyzes the challenges of the new approaches to green fi-
nance. The last section concludes the paper and provides 
policy recommendations. 
II. How Blockchain Powers Green Finance       
Blockchain technology, as fintech, provides various so-
lutions for green finance and sustainable development 
(Schulz & Feist, 2021). Blockchain ensures the better track-
ing of green finance flows in real time. It takes sustainable 
finance to a new level through fund distribution. It also 
expands microfinancing and provides a matchmaking plat-
form for investors and green project developers, helping 
green investment projects become a huge success. 
In addition, blockchain can improve the carbon asset 
transaction system and provide global investors with a 
seamless and frictionless transaction solution. It can also 
make trading schemes more efficient through new ap-
proaches to price carbon credits and connect distributed 
carbon markets, besides decentralizing the trade of renew-
able energies and carbon credits. The efficient use of smart 
contracts in the process will also facilitate automation, 
high-speed execution, traceability, and transparency. 
A. Blockchain Solutions in Green Digital Finance        
III. Blockchain-Based Firms Nurturing Green      
Finance  
The financial sector is quickly evolving. Many firms and 
initiatives are emerging and influencing green finance and 
sustainable growth, mainly providing innovative fintech so-
lutions, tokenized green bond issuance, peer-to-peer re-
newable energy trading, carbon credit trading, and climate 
finance through crowdfunding (Cao et al., 2021). The fol-
lowing are some of the prime blockchain-based initiatives 
analyzed in the literature that accelerate green finance and 
sustainable investments. 
Stockholm Green Fintech   is a non-profit organization 
conceived to strengthen green finance and investments 
through groundbreaking fintech solutions. High ambitions 
in green finance and sustainable investments support inno-
vations and emphasize solutions within the green fintech 
community. This independent platform stimulates, con-
ceives, and promotes solutions for the green transforma-
tion of the fintech industry. 
Climate Chain Coalition   is an accredited observer orga-
nization whose commitment is to advance collaboration. 
It engages a multi-stakeholder group to mobilize climate 
finance; facilitate networking, research, governance, and 
demonstrations; and support the DLT applications and re-
lated fintech solutions to address climate change. 
Project Genesis  is a green bond issuance prototype 
launched by the Bank of International Settlements Inno-
vation Hub and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. It is 
a digital platform combining DLT to tokenize assets infra-
structure focused specifically on governments green bonds. 
It is based on a private blockchain that offers a transparent 
secondary market for retail investors, so that anybody can 
download an app and easily access safe government bonds 
that will develop a green project. 
Green Asset Wallet   is the first blockchain platform for 
validating and reporting financial impact. The platform is 
exclusively designed to provide transparency, efficiency, 
and trust in the green debt market. It bridges sustainable 
investors with green investment privileges through 
blockchain. By scaling the green debt supply, Green Asset 
Wallet makes sustainable investments accessible for poten-
tial investors. 
WePower is a platform that establishes robust connec-
tions among energy suppliers, corporate buyers, and energy 
producers by providing effortless green energy transac-
tions. With the power of blockchain, it makes energy sourc-
ing as simple as online shopping. The platform provides a 
high degree of flexibility in signing direct energy contracts. 
WePower sees blockchain and renewable energy as the next 
mighty couple of the energy market. 
Green Digital Finance Alliance    is a combined effort of 
Ant Financial Services and the United Nations Environment 
Programme to unleash the potential of the fintech sector 
a) Reliable transaction recording:   One of the first 
reasons to incorporate blockchain technology into 
the financial sector is that it bestows an efficient and 
reliable platform to carry out and record transactions 
in the most authentic way possible. It enables asset 
ownership tracking. To be precise, blockchain makes 
energy trading less complex and highly credible. 
b) Elimination of intermediaries:   The smart con-
tract in a blockchain automatically validates transac-
tions that occur in renewable energy finance. This 
avoids the need for third parties in the process. It 
streamlines the shared trading platform for physical 
and financial trading with an assorted range of re-
newable energy commodities. 
c) Regulatory reporting and compliance:    At pre-
sent, regulators in the sector demand renewable en-
ergy trading entities to submit comprehensive data 
to identify noncompliance and other regulatory defi-
ciencies. With the available tools and methods, gath-
ering and cleaning the data are an arduous task, and 
there is also substantial risk that the data could fall 
into the wrong hands. To eliminate all the troubles 
mentioned above, blockchain comes into play. It pro-
vides the utmost transparency, immutable data, and 
ideal ownership rights. 
d) Global supply network:   Under the current sys-
tem, it is impossible to have an all-inclusive perspec-
tive of end-to-end processes in the sector. DLTs al-
low entities to share high-speed, productive, tamper-
proof, and transparent information on an open plat-
form without the anxiety of having their confidential 
and business-crucial information compromised.

by streamlining the requirements for sustainable develop-
ment. The allies of pioneering financial and sustainable 
development institutions collaborate to provide timely ac-
tions with scaled opportunities. 
IV. Tokenizing Green Assets and Green Bonds        
Notwithstanding the significant growth in the green 
bond market, lack of transparency is one of investors’ main 
concerns. Utilizing blockchain technology as a financial in-
strument will streamline the process of green finance with 
the utmost trust, transparency, cost reduction, mobiliza-
tion, and immutable traits. Banks can list tokenized green 
assets in the primary or secondary market and make them 
accessible to small/retail investors through a public 
blockchain exchange or a stock exchange that supports se-
curity token trading. There will be no difference in the costs 
for bonds on the blockchain between a $10 and a $10 mil-
lion investment, which will open up the green bond market 
to a broader investor base (HSBC & Green Digital Finance 
Alliance, 2019). 
Tokenizing green assets and bonds will engage a wide 
range of investors in the market and make it possible to 
involve more individuals interested in sustainable invest-
ment. A couple of related solutions in green finance are an-
alyzed in this paper, as follows. 
Bonds as a service:    Many platforms provide do-it-your-
self (DIY) bonds, which permit the issuers to build their 
own blockchain-based green bonds at reduced cost. DIY 
bonds allow investors to build and manage their portfolios 
without intervention or guidance from a professional finan-
cial advisor (HDFC Bank, 2022). The new platforms can of-
fer these bonds via the issuance of security tokens. They 
help small or medium-sized enterprises or communities to 
issue green bonds without a bank’s traditional costly ser-
vices. 
Fractional asset ownership:   One of the greatest use 
cases of tokenizing green assets is it provision of fractional 
asset ownership. Green bonds and other assets can be con-
verted into smaller units and owned by the investors. Amal-
gamating fractional asset ownership with automated re-
porting, small investors will be able to supervise the 
real-time progress of their investments. 
V. Challenges of the new approaches to green         
finance  
One of the main challenges in the renewable energy 
sector is the lack of accurate regulatory frameworks. The 
lack of competitiveness pushes these projects to be highly 
dependent on regulations. For instance, commitments to 
high-priced payments, priority access to electricity grids, 
essential infrastructure investments, and the guaranteed 
purchase of the outputs are critical reasons why the pro-
jects depend on the regulatory frameworks to proceed. 
Governments must develop and enact regulatory frame-
works to make sustainable finance more efficient and trans-
parent, since this is one of the significant challenges in 
developing green digital finance, particularly in tokenizing 
green assets. In addition, excessive risk taking, overseeing 
the operation of markets, fraudulent activities, and tech-
nology-related risks are other crucial grounds for the un-
certainties. The prevailing frameworks were designed with 
conventional securities, and brand-new classes of renew-
able energies and their trading applications therefore re-
main unclear. 
VI. Conclusion and policy recommendations      
Blockchain technology provides viable solutions to en-
hance and stimulate sustainable investments. Though one 
part of the world likes the taste of cryptocurrencies, the 
tech community, on the flip side, is exceptionally motivated 
to take part in a more sustainable world that ensures trans-
parency, accountability, and a high sense of emergency. 
Green digital finance is quickly evolving as many initiatives 
emerge and influence green finance and sustainable 
growth. However, most of them are at the early stages of de-
velopment. Still, if they are supported by appropriate regu-
lation, they can effectively facilitate and improve green in-
vestments, especially in the areas mentioned in this paper, 
such as mobilizing private green finance, tokenizing green 
bonds, expanding the coverage of microfinancing, directing 
private capital to the best-matched green investment pro-
jects, bringing transparency to the system and reducing un-
certainties, improving the carbon asset transaction system, 
supporting the tracking and reporting of carbon emissions, 
facilitating the trade of renewable energies, and enhancing 
financial flows. 
Policymakers and financial regulators should establish 
an international framework for applying blockchain in sus-
tainable finance, such as tokenizing green assets and issu-
ing green bonds, trading carbon credits and renewable en-
ergies in a decentralized and transparent ecosystem, and 
decentralizing crowdfunding for green projects. Blockchain 
can pave the way for initiatives in this field and bring about 
greater certainty and acceptability for investors. 
The recommendation for future studies is to run an em-
pirical analysis using real data to assess the effectiveness of 
blockchain technology in reducing finance costs and risk in 
the green sector.
