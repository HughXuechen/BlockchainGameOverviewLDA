Aiming at the problems in the performance improvement of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain, in this article, the author
defines the constraints on the performance improvement of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain and determines the demand
to improve performance in quality and safety, logistics traceability, resource integration, and benefit distribution. In addition, this
article conducts coupling analysis on the characteristics of blockchain technology, such as intelligent contract, information
sharing, traceability, and performance improvement requirements. -e author embeds the alliance chain in the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain and designs the blockchain information platform model from four levels: application layer, contract
layer, network layer, and data layer, with the purpose of optimizing and improving the performance of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain. What is more, the Stackelberg game model between the supplier and the e-commerce platform was constructed to
study and compare the profit changes of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain before and after the application of the blockchain
information platform. Finally, the result of Stackelberg game is numerically simulated by Matlab software. -e results show that
blockchain technology is a booster for the development of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain to a higher stage of the whole
industry chain management, coordination, and integration. Investing in the blockchain system within a certain budget range can
not only improve the reliability of products, but also improve the performance of each main component of the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain, as well as the overall performance. Results can offer a theoretical guidance for producer and retailer in
investing in BIP, pricing decision, and supply chain coordination after applying BIP.
1. Introduction
Fresh food e-commerce, also known as fresh agricultural
product e-commerce platform, is an information technology-
based e-commerce platform that retails fresh products such as
vegetables, meat, and aquatic products. In the meantime,
there are also other business formats and corporate activities
[1]. According to the data in the “2020 China Agricultural
Products E-Commerce Development Report,” China’s fresh
food e-commerce transactions in 2017–2019 were 141.8 bil-
lion yuan, 215.8 billion yuan, and 350.6 billion yuan. With the
rapid increase in transaction volume, on the one hand, fresh
food e-commerce companies have “increased” accordingly,
and on the other, there is a “development bottleneck” in fresh
food e-commerce. During the 15 years of development of
fresh food e-commerce, more than 20 fresh food e-commerce
companies will lose money and close down every year. In
2019, 27 stores, such as Yiguo Shengxian, Mini Shengxian,
and Xian laiduo, closed down due to losses. Fresh food
e-commerce is rapidly expanding, but with poor supply chain
collaboration, lack of integrity, long industrial chain, and large
losses. And it did not form a “network chain” dominated by
four chains, including industrial chain, supply chain, value
chain, and blockchain, which in turn affects the overall
performance of business operations and the fresh food supply
chain. -erefore, the performance improvement and healthy
development of fresh food e-commerce has become an urgent
problem to be solved.

At present, the core competitiveness of price discounts
and distribution services is not enough to support the long-
term development of fresh food e-commerce. In the
“Outline of Digital Village Development” in 2019, the role of
blockchain in promoting e-commerce of fresh agricultural
products was emphasized. -e Central Document No. 1 in
2020 focuses on the issues of “agriculture, rural areas, and
farmers” and emphasizes the application of blockchain in
the agricultural field [2]. Just as SARS promoted the de-
velopment of Jack Mas e-commerce in 2003, the 2019-nCoV
epidemic is also an opportunity for fresh food e-commerce
companies to enter a new stage of digital development. -e
core of competition for fresh food e-commerce companies
lies in the strength of the supply chain behind them.
Blockchain technology can solve the internal and external
factors affecting performance such as the information
asymmetry of members in the fresh food e-commerce supply
chain, product quality and safety, and logistics service
quality. -ere are multiple couplings between the infor-
mation sharing, smart contracts, and traceability charac-
teristics of blockchain technology and the overall
performance improvement needs of the fresh food e-com-
merce supply chain. -is is of great significance to the in-
come increase and healthy development of fresh food
e-commerce.
In view of this, this article starts from the application of
blockchain technology to the fresh food e-commerce supply
chain to improve overall performance. First of all, by ana-
lyzing the existing relevant literature on the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain and blockchain, the coupling
between the characteristics of blockchain technology and the
demand characteristics of fresh food e-commerce perfor-
mance improvement was summarized. In addition, the
author designed a fresh food supply chain information
platform based on the consortium blockchain to realize the
demand to improve performance of each member of the
fresh food e-commerce supply chain, thereby promoting the
performance improvement of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain. -en, the paper uses game theory to study the
performance improvement of the fresh food supply chain in
the context of blockchain, explores the application of
blockchain technology in the fresh food supply chain, and
puts forward practical and feasible performance improve-
ment suggestions for fresh food e-commerce companies.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Research on Restrictive Factors of Fresh Food E-Commerce
Supply Chain Performance Improvement. Supply chain
performance is the result of the execution of supply chain
strategy [3]. -e ultimate goal of the supply chain is to
increase the supply chain performance; therefore, improving
the overall performance of supply chain is the purpose of
performance optimization in this paper. -e overall profit
improvement of the supply chain is the purpose for this
article to analyze the performance optimization. Different
from the traditional agricultural product supply chain, the
fresh food e-commerce supply chain is based on modern
Internet information technology, with fresh food
e-commerce companies as the leading enterprises, con-
necting the various components, including a series of links
such as production, procurement, service, sales, and dis-
tribution [4]. -ere are not many studies on the factors
affecting the performance of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain at home and abroad. -ey can be roughly
divided into two types: theoretical researches that propose
performance optimization countermeasures to the devel-
opment status and empirical researches that explore the
impact of various factors on performance through evalua-
tion models.
-e basic theoretical researches include the following:
Van der Vorst emphasized that fresh products have special
characteristics such as perishability, short shelf life, seasonal
production, variability in quality and quantity, long pro-
duction throughput time, and special transportation re-
quirements [5].With fresh food e-commerce as the last “blue
ocean” in the e-commerce field, the driving factors that affect
its supply chain performance include not only external
factors such as industry characteristics, technologies, and
customers, but also internal factors such as processes,
partnerships, and supply chain strategies [3]; Joby George
and Pillai pointed out that the main factors affecting supply
chain performance are supply chain structure, inventory
control, policies, information sharing, customer demand,
forecasting methods, preparation time, and review period
length [6]; Zan et al. conducted a comprehensive review of
the development history of domestic fresh food e-commerce,
put forward hindering factors such as the difficulty of
building fresh food e-commerce brands, high operating
costs, vicious competition on the supply side, and friction
with the traditional market, and suggested refining pro-
curement standards and improving the degree of infor-
matization, etc. [7].
Empirical researches on the performance evaluation and
optimization of the fresh food supply chain include the
following: based on five performance criteria, Moazzam et al.
summarized the SCOR model suitable for the performance
and risk analysis of the fresh agricultural product supply
chain by reviewing existing performance evaluation systems
and frameworks. Environmental sustainability, food quality,
flexibility, value at risk, and other indicators were added in
the selected reliability, responsiveness, agility, cost, and asset
attributes, and through the case of New Zealand dairy
products, the superiority of the analysis framework was
verified through [8]; in the three-level fresh agricultural
products supply chain, Odongo et al. used trust, commit-
ments, information sharing, coercive force, noncoercive
force, dependence, and conflict to represent the structure of
supply chain relationship quality and explored the influence
of supply chain relationship quality on supply chain per-
formance. It was found that, in the upstream of fresh ag-
ricultural products, trust, commitment, coercive force,
noncoercive force, dependence, and conflict were the most
important attributes; in the downstream core enterprises,
trust and conflict were the most important attributes, and
customers believed that trust, dependence, and coercive
force were the important attributes [9]; Yadav et al. de-
veloped a data-driven agricultural supply chain performance
2 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
measurement framework based on the Internet of -ings
and added sustainability indicators to provide references for
improving agricultural supply chain performance [10];
Yadav and Garg shared information at all levels of the
agricultural product supply chain in real time through
cloud-based information technology systems, solved the
asymmetry of power distribution within the fresh supply
chain, and improved supply chain fairness and perfor-
mance [11]; Kaipia et al. studied how to use information
sharing to reduce waste and to improve sustainable per-
formance in the three fresh food supply chains of milk,
fresh fish, and poultry [12]; Yeh et al. studied how the
integration of the supply chain of small- and medium-sized
enterprises affects the relationship stability of the supply
chain, thereby affecting the supply chain performance. It is
concluded that internal integration, supplier integration,
and customer integration have positive impacts on rela-
tionship stability, relationship stability has a positive im-
pact on supplier performance, and environmental
uncertainty only moderates the impact of internal inte-
gration on relationship stability [13].
2.2. Research on the Application of Blockchain Technology in
the Fresh Food E-Commerce Supply Chain. -e character-
istics of blockchain technology are decentralization, open-
ness and transparency, incorrigibility of data, security and
credibility, anonymity, traceability, etc., so it is widely used
in the fields of finance, education, medical care, and supply
chainmanagement. As the underlying technology of Bitcoin,
blockchain is essentially a chained data structure that links
data blocks in chronological orders, a decentralized dis-
tributed database, or electronic account book that is tamper-
resistant, secure, and transparent protected by cryptography
[14].-e data block is mainly composed of the block headers
and the block bodies. -e block headers include the version
number, the hash value of the block, the hash value of the
previous block, the random number of the solution of the
previous blocks consensus process, the timestamp, and the
Merkle root node. -e block bodies include the current
transaction records and all previous transaction records that
have been successfully verified [15].
-e research on the application of blockchain technology
in the supply chain of fresh agricultural products is divided
into four aspects.
(1) -e researches on the safety traceability systems of
fresh products are the fields that currently combine
the most blockchain with the fresh supply chain.
Zhou and Zheng built a four-level system framework
(physical layer, core layer, data layer, and application
layer) with e-commerce platform as the core for the
current management of the whole industry chain
after the food supervision reform and analyzed the
traceability operation process [16]; Salah et al. pro-
posed a tracking and tracing technology for soybeans
in the agricultural supply chain based on the
Ethereum blockchain, using smart contracts to
control and manage the transactions and interac-
tions of all participants [17]; Salah et al. propose an
approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain
and smart contracts efficiently perform business
transactions for soybean tracking and traceability
across the agricultural supply chain [17]; Alzahrani
proposed a decentralized anticounterfeiting supply
chain using NFC and blockchain technology [18].
(2) In the logistics circulation of fresh agricultural
products supply chain, the strict requirements for
logistics efficiency in the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain is another research hotspot. Li designed
the three-tier blockchain deployment of the initial
layer, the middle layer, and the consumer layer in
response to the low circulation efficiency, low
timeliness controllability, and high circulation costs
of fresh agricultural products in China. Finally, the
feasibility of the scheme was verified through em-
pirical research and simulation [19]; Park explored
the influencing factors of the application of block-
chain technology in the logistics industry and
pointed out that blockchain technology makes
supply chain logistics more efficient and more
competitive [20]. Based on the cold chain logistics of
rural agricultural products, Mei aimed at the cold
chain logistics of rural agricultural products, based
on blockchain technology to construct a cold chain
logistics model that encompasses the whole process
from origin to sales [21].
(3) applications in supply chain finance, Tang and
Zhuang constructed a blockchain debt-to-credit
platform based on blockchain technology for supply
chain financial credit problems and compared the
advantages and disadvantages of the newsboy model
with the traditional model; finally they verified the
advantages of the blockchain debt-to-credit platform
through numerical analysis [22]; Gauthier system-
atically studied the factoring business model based
on blockchain smart contract technology and pro-
posed a supply chain “intelligent factoring” system
with simple design and operation, low operating
costs, and convenient financing advantages [23].
(4) In the aspect of fresh food supply chain performance,
most of them are empirical studies on various effi-
ciency improvements brought by the addition of
blockchain into the supply chain. Nandi et al.
pointed out that the current work of supply chain
system supporting blockchain technology focused
more on improving the ability of the business level
(information sharing and coordination) than the
ability of the strategic level integration and collab-
oration capabilities, such as compliance and quality
improvement, process improvement, flexibility, re-
duced costs, and reduced process time, so as to
improve its supply chain performance [24]; Nandi
et al. aimed to explore how firms’ efforts to integrate
blockchain technology (BCT) into their supply chain
systems and activities enable certain supply chain
capabilities and, consequently, improve their supply
chain performance [24]. Hald and Kinra showed the
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 3
important and complex Janus-faced implications of
embedding BCT in supply chains and demonstrated
how organizational theory can be applied to explore
the relationship between blockchain and SCM [25].
Combined with the above literature, it is found that
the application of blockchain technology in the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain has a good founda-
tion. However, most of the research results of
blockchain are in the stage of improvement and the
implementation is not strong.
By conducting a comprehensive analysis on the above
literature, we found that (1) combining the industry
characteristics of fresh food e-commerce and existing
research literature of supply chain performance,
according to external factors, such as industry charac-
teristics, technology, and customers, and internal factors
such as processes, partnerships, and supply chain strat-
egies, it can be summarized that the constraints on the
performance improvement of the fresh food supply chain
studied in this article include food quality and safety
issues, supply chain partnerships, supply chain collabo-
ration and integration, customer experience, information
technology, and other internal and external factors. (2)
-ere are multiple couplings between the technical
characteristics of the blockchain and the demand for
performance improvement of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain. -e partial application of blockchain in the
fresh food e-commerce supply chain has achieved some
results. For example, the quality and safety traceability
system, the logistics circulation system, and the financing
credit system have been optimized, but most of the results
are in the stage of improvement and there are few practical
applications. (3) Some domestic and foreign scholars have
conducted empirical research on blockchain technology
and the performance of fresh food e-commerce supply
chain, which has laid a theoretical foundation for this
article based on blockchain technology to integrate and
coordinate the entire chain, improve the overall perfor-
mance of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain, and
increase the supply chain surplus.
In view of this, this article couples the technical
characteristics of the blockchain with the performance
constraints of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain,
designs a blockchain-based fresh food e-commerce supply
chain optimization model, integrates the resources of each
node, strengthens information sharing, and promotes the
integration and coordination of the supply chain to form a
green and sustainable community of integrated fresh food
e-commerce supply chain bearing the risk and sharing the
profit, so as to improve overall performance. -en, this
article uses game theory to verify whether the character-
istics of the blockchain technology can promote the per-
formance improvement of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain, explores the supply chain performance
changes before and after the application of blockchain
technology in the fresh food supply chain, provides
guarantee for the implementation of blockchain technol-
ogy, and puts forward suggestions for the development of
fresh food e-commerce.
3. Optimization Model of Fresh Food
E-Commerce Supply Chain Based on
Alliance Chain
3.1. Blockchain Technology and Performance Optimization
Demand Coupling. -e performance of fresh food
e-commerce supply chain is affected by multiple factors.
After analyzing the literature, we found that fresh food
quality and safety issues, partnerships in the supply chain,
supply chain collaboration and integration, customer ex-
perience, and information technology and other internal
and external factors affect the improvement of fresh food
e-commerce supply chain performance. Based on the ex-
ternal driving factors, i.e., customers, and internal driving
factors, i.e., partners, cost, and information, we select
quality and safety, logistics traceability, relationship
quality, resource integration and benefit distribution, and
other factors that affect the performance of fresh e-com-
merce supply chain and analyze the coupling with the
technical characteristics of blockchain. -e customers in
the fresh food e-commerce supply chain are the source of
profit in the fresh food supply chain, and at the same time,
they also represent the market trend. Product quality,
service flexibility, and customer experience are the main
influencing factors for performance. -e quality of the
relationship with the partner has a significant impact on
performance. A good partnership in the supply chain is a
win-win cooperation, and it has the advantages of reducing
costs, increasing profits, forecasting accuracy, and con-
trolling inventory. It can maintain the stability at the supply
side and ensure the sustainability of the supply chain. Cost
is an important input in the fresh food supply chain. -e
circulation cost and operating cost of fresh products, as well
as the loss, are all important factors that affect performance.
Information sharing is the key competitiveness of fresh
food e-commerce supply chain. Sharing information can
reduce the uncertainty of the fresh food supply chain,
increase agility, reduce information asymmetry, increase
trust, and improve the efficiency and performance of the
fresh food e-commerce supply chain.
According to the restrictions on participating nodes,
blockchains can be roughly divided into three types: public
chain, similar to Bitcoin blockchain, where everyone can
participate in checking transactions, obtaining consensus,
and anonymous verification; private chain, which is for-
mulated according to the rules of private organizations and
requires organization authorization for reading and writing
and consensus; the alliance chain, similar to China Ledge
and Hyperledger, which formulates read and write per-
missions and obtains a consensus process according to the
rules of the alliance. -e data in the chain can be public or
private and is limited to alliance members.
4 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
At present, the consortium blockchain is suitable for ap-
plying in the fresh food e-commerce supply chain. Blockchain
technology is decentralized (all network nodes have equal rights
and obligations and share andmaintain databases together); the
data cannot be tampered with (asymmetric encryption and
consensus mechanism ensure the safety of data and cannot be
tampered with, and 51% of nodes need to be controlled to forge
data). It is safe and trustworthy (the technologies such as hash
algorithm, electronic signature, and digital certificate in
cryptography are adopted to ensure the data security of block
transaction). It also has the characteristics of smart contract and
traceability. -ere are multiple couplings between the per-
formance optimization requirements of the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain (quality safety, logistics traceability,
relationship quality, resource integration, and benefit distri-
bution) and the characteristics of the blockchain technology
(smart contracts, information sharing, data that cannot be
tampered with, traceability, and decentralization), as shown in
Figure 1. -e application of blockchain technology to the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain can weaken information
asymmetry, improve the fairness between supply chain
members, enhance their collaboration, and improve supply
chain stability. -e integration of suppliers, customers, and
other node resources helps fresh food e-commerce to form an
integration and enhance competitiveness. -e sharing of in-
formation reduces the uncertainty of the fresh food e-com-
merce supply chain, enhances customer loyalty, forms the
standard of branding, and promotes the integration of the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain. In this way, the overall per-
formance of fresh food e-commerce has been improved.
3.2. Constructing an Optimization Model for the Blockchain
Information Platform of the Fresh Food E-Commerce Supply
Chain. In order to solve the problems that hinder perfor-
mance improvement in the fresh food e-commerce supply
chain and promote the overall performance improvement
and sustainable development of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain, we build a blockchain information platform
with the help of blockchain technology to help the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain move towards a standardized and
integrated high-end model.
-e consortium blockchain is a blockchain jointly orga-
nized and managed by multiple entities, institutions, or en-
terprises. -e accounting node is preselected in advance, and
the generation of new blockchain is jointly verified by the
preselected nodes. Although it abandons complete decentral-
ization, it is more in line with the needs of the industry. Based
on the Byzantine consensus algorithm, the system records
transactions quickly. Only when each member of the group
agrees together can they establish their own guidelines of the
system. In the field of fresh food e-commerce supply chain, the
blockchain system is composed of five levels of data, network,
consensus, contract, and application. We only design the basic
architecture of the blockchain information platform in view of
four levels (application layer, contract layer, network layer, and
data layer) (see Figure 2). -e application layer is a kind of
encapsulation at the end of the client, which is for users to trace
and check, supply chain members (manufacturers, logistics
providers, fresh food e-commerce, etc.) to manage and query
information, and regulatory authorities to inspect.-e contract
layer is a variety of smart contracts of enterprises, policies, and
laws and automatic execution contracts such as script codes
and algorithms, as well as programmable foundations. In the
network layer, the P2P network structure is the basis of dis-
tributed storage. It also has a transmission mechanism to
broadcast new transaction data and blocks to the whole net-
work and the verification mechanism implemented according
to the predetermined agreement. -e data block at the data
layer is mainly composed of the block head and the block body.
-e block head includes the version number, the hash value of
the block, the hash value of the previous block, the random
number of the solution of the previous blocks consensus
process, the timestamp, and the Merkle root node. -e block
body includes the current transaction record and all previous
transaction records that have been successfully verified. It is the
basis for data not to be tampered with and traceable.
-e main participants in the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain include producers (individual farmers, fresh
food bases, etc.), processing companies, wholesalers, logis-
tics companies, fresh food e-commerce platform companies
and consumers, etc. At present, there are many fresh
electricity business enterprises, including O2O mode of
Hema fresh, B2C of Yiguo fresh, and epidemic induced
community group Meituan preferred and other electricity
business models. For example, in the supply chain link of
selected fresh food e-commerce for tadpoles, suppliers (fresh
food bases, manufacturers and distributors, etc.) transport
goods to e-commerce enterprise warehouses, and e-com-
merce enterprises complete logistics distribution. For most
fresh food e-commerce supply chains, see Figure 3.
At present, fresh food e-commerce companies have weak
control over the upstream of the supply chain. Most of the
suppliers are farmers and agricultural cooperatives, whose level
of informatization is not high, and it is difficult to guarantee
production standardization and product quality. During the
circulation of fresh products, packaging and logistics costs are
relatively high. Most of the manufacturers and wholesalers
undertake logistics and transportation by themselves. -e lo-
gistics enterprises are also chaotic, showing many, small,
scattered characteristics. It is not possible to form a situation of
cooperative development, which restricts the efficiency of cold
chain operations. In the fresh food e-commerce supply chain,
the rights and information of each subject are asymmetrical,
and there is a lack of trust mechanisms and information
sharing. -e quality of the partnership is not high, lacking
integration and coordination capabilities. -e actual customer
experience is poor, and the price of fresh products is not easy to
accept by customers. -e value concept needs to be trans-
formed. -e consortium blockchain is quite in line with the
development direction of coordination, integration, and
standardization of fresh food e-commerce supply chain.
-erefore, we build a fresh food e-commerce blockchain in-
formation platform based on the consortium blockchain to
achieve controllable product quality, traceability of logistics,
trust building, information sharing and reasonable distribution
of benefits, etc., so as to improve the performance of the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain (see Figure 4).

6 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
-e construction of the blockchain information platform
for the fresh food e-commerce supply chain must unite the
various components of the supply chain (suppliers, pro-
cessing companies, logistics companies, e-commerce com-
panies, etc.), fresh food industry associations, government
regulatory agencies, and financial institutions, and the core
enterprises of fresh food e-commerce should take the lead to
build a consortium blockchain with multiple types of
companies and departments as nodes. -e blockchain in-
formation platform is divided into three parts: data col-
lection, data processing, and client applications.
In the data collection stage, various enterprise systems
and contracts are formulated in accordance with unified
standards. -e composition subject of the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain collects and uploads production
information (product variety, growth environment, drug
utilization and growth time, etc.), processing information
(processing unit, processing flow, quarantine results, etc.),
logistics information (carrier, vehicle information, delivery
route, cabin temperature and estimated time, etc.), ware-
housing information (product quantity, storage time, stor-
age humidity, temperature and product freshness, etc.), sales
information (sales time, sales price, sales quantity, product
warranty period, etc.), and transaction information (con-
sumer order time, payment information and purchase
category, etc.) through technologies such as Internet of
-ings technology (wireless sensors, radio frequency, and
GPS), video surveillance, and QR codes, and each subject is
distributed and linked in the blockchain through P2P net-
working. After the information is uploaded, it will be
broadcast on the whole network. After it is verified, the data
is stored in each node in a distributed manner, and RFID
tags or QR codes can be generated at each stage to facilitate
data collection and query. -e decentralized and distributed
storage method has transformed the traditional trust
mechanism from trusting people to trusting machines.

transactions through the nodes they control, which will be
hashed to generate a digital summary and digitize the in-
formation. -e node digitally signs the digital summary and
broadcasts it to the entire network. Other nodes generate a
summary by hash algorithm and verify the authenticity of
information by comparing the decrypted digital summary.
-rough the Byzantine consensus algorithm, the three-phase
consensus is pre-prepared, prepared, and submitted. After
the verification node is time stamped, the successfully
verified data is input into the blockchain. After the data is
successfully verified, the smart contract of the system will
automatically execute all verified agreements (including
transaction price, benefit distribution, risk sharing, and
other agreements). Asymmetric encryption, hash algorithm,
and consensus mechanism ensure that the information can
not be tampered with and is safe and reliable. -e chain
structure of the block, timestamp, and Merkle tree make it
possible to trace the data from the source to the end.
-e applications at the client end serve consumers,
enterprises and regulatory authorities, etc. Each participant
obtains a public key and a private key through registration
and is assigned different access. Consumers can trace the
source of product information through the client end,
monitor the operation of the blockchain network, and
perform credit ratings on sellers, etc. Enterprises canmanage
and release corporate information, realize information
sharing, coordinate and integrate corporate operations, and
integrate resources to form a rapidly reorganized and re-
active supply chain. -e use of smart contracts can reduce
transaction costs between enterprises and promote the es-
tablishment of long-term contractual relationships between
enterprises. -e regulatory authorities supervise and spot-
check whether fresh products meet standards through the
client end and supervise corporate credit and the signing of
smart contracts. When necessary, they can enforce the
implementation of smart contracts such as benefit sharing
and risk sharing.
-e consortium blockchain has technical features such
as information traceability, smart contracts, and information
sharing, which can promote the horizontal integration and
vertical coordination of fresh food e-commerce, so that it
can develop in the direction of integration and improve
overall performance. First of all, the founding members of
the consortium blockchain (core companies, various de-
partments and institutions, etc.) work together to formulate
the strategic goals of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain
and generate smart contracts, which is added to the
blockchain. -at is, to formulate unified industry standards,
enterprise operation systems (benefit distribution system
and reward and punishment system) and collaboration
integrate the degree and scope to meet the individual needs
of customers, enhance consumer experience, and maximize
customer value. Secondly, with the help of blockchain de-
centralization, distributed storage, and consensus mecha-
nism, we can build trust among the main bodies of the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain and promote the horizontal
integration of all links in the fresh food e-commerce supply
chain. In this way, it can not only reduce disorderly com-
petition, integrate and share various resources and
information, and form a large-scale operation, but also
obtain large-scale economic effects and improve competitive
position. -rough the trust mechanism and information
sharing provided by the blockchain, the main enterprises of
the fresh food supply chain can coordinate vertically.
Companies with different complementary capabilities can
join forces and sign contracts to gain advantages in a
competitive environment, thereby achieving common vision
and goals. Finally, according to the formulated unified in-
dustry standards and system specifications, we can use the
properties of blockchain technology such as nontampering,
traceability, information sharing, smart contracts, and con-
sensusmechanisms to build a blockchain information platform,
ensure the safety and control of product quality in the fresh food
e-commerce supply chain, achieve traceability of logistics in-
formation, promote the improvement of the quality of rela-
tionships between enterprises, and achieve resource integration
and benefit distribution. As a result, the overall performance of
fresh e-commerce supply chain can be improved.
4. Supply Chain Performance Analysis before
and after Applying Blockchain
In order to study the changes of supply chain profits before
and after the application of blockchain information platform
(BIP) in the fresh e-commerce supply chain, we have
simplified the fresh e-commerce supply chain into a sec-
ondary supply chain which was composed of fresh suppliers
and e-commerce platforms in this section. In addition,
suppliers could receive first-hand information such as
freshness and production time in this two-level supply chain
system, so they would like to obtain more contracts when
misreporting product information. -is study has set the
research objects with the manufacturer as the leader and the
e-commerce platform as the follower in decentralized supply
chain. In the Stackelberg game model, the supplier releases
the raw product with quality, safety, and reliability of βwhen
not using BIP and then sends the wholesale price ω and false
production time ct to the e-commerce platform, so that the
e-commerce platform could determine the order quantity Q
based on the wholesale price ω along with the retail price P.
4.1. Variable Description. When fresh e-commerce sec-
ondary supply chain has acted as a profit system, the pursuit
of profit maximization, consumer order quantity will be
affected by price, freshness, and safety. As shown in Figure 5,
variables in the corresponding basic model are assumed as
follows: P is the unit retail price of the e-commerce platform;
ω is the unit wholesale price of raw products provided by the
supplier; cs is the unit production cost and transportation
cost of the supplier; cr is the unit storage and distribution
cost of the e-commerce platform; t is the production time of
real fresh products (c is a misreporting factor, and c ∈ [0, 1];
then the misreporting of production time is ct); θ(t) and θ(ct)
are the freshness of real fresh products and product freshness
under false reporting behavior, respectively (according to
Chenet al. [26], freshness of raw products θ(t) � 1 − t2/Τ2,
0≤ t≤Τ, Τ is the life cycle); β is the quality reliability of fresh
8 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
products; cos and cor are the costs of suppliers and e-com-
merce platforms after using BIP, respectively; Q and Qo are
the order quantities of retailers under false reporting and true
freshness, respectively; D and Do are market demand forecast
under false reporting behavior and true freshness, respec-
tively; the e-commerce platform would place orders to sup-
pliers according to the demand forecast, so Q � D, Do � Qo.
-e supplier lied about freshness and the reliability of
product quality was low when not using BIP. -e reliability
coefficient was represented by λ (0≤ λ≤ 1). While blockchain
technology will reduce misreporting after using BIP, therefore
improving trust relationship and increasing consumer pur-
chasing power, then reliability coefficient would reach λB＞λ
and PB is the unit retail price of the e-commerce platform
after using BIP; ωB is the unit wholesale price of fresh
products provided by the supplier after using BIP; QB � Qo is
the order quantity of e-commerce platform after using BIP; πr
and πs are the profits of suppliers and e-commerce platforms
when not using BIP; πB
s and πB
r are the profits of suppliers and
e-commerce platforms after using BIP.
4.2. Model Assumptions
Assumption 1. -e supplier provides a fresh product for the
e-commerce platform with sufficient production capacity.
Both parties aim at maximizing their own interests which are
risk-neutral and completely rational.
Assumption 2. Supply chain members need to improve food
quality and safety partnership through blockchain infor-
mation platform; consumers are willing to pay the right
amount for safe, reliable, and fresh products.
Assumption 3. Fresh product order demand is affected by
price, freshness, and reliability. According to the literature of
Zeng et al. [27] and Pan Liu [28], the demand function is
assumed to be as D � a − bp + λβθ(t); a is the market size,
and b is the price sensitivity coefficient (a and b are constants
greater than 0; we set a and b as 1, for better calculation so
that the simplified demand function is Q � 1 − p + λβθ(t)).
4.3. Model Building and Solving
4.3.1. Set Up Decision Model When Not Using the Blockchain
Information Platform (BIP). -e supplier conceals the raw
product information to the e-commerce platform when
not using BIP, prompting the e-commerce platform to
increase the order quantity. At this point, the demand
function is
Q � 1 − p + λβθ(ct). (1)
At this point, the profit function of suppliers and fresh
e-commerce platform are
πs � ω − cs( 􏼁 · Q, (2)
πr � Ρ − ω − cr( 􏼁 · Q
o
− Q − Q
O
􏼐 􏼑 · ω. (3)
Based on equations (1) and (3), we have solved this
problem by inverse induction. Firstly, the second derivative
of Q in (3) α2πr/α2Q � −2＜0, so there is an optimal so-
lution. Set the first derivative to be απr/αQ � 0, and the
optimal values are
Q

1 + 2λβθ(ct) − λβθ(t) − ω − cr
2
, (4)
Ρ∗ �
1 + λβθ(t) + cr + ω
2
. (5)
Substitute equations (4) and (5) into equation (2).
-e second derivative of ω is α2πs/α2ω � −1＜0, so there
is an optimal solution. Set the first derivative
to be απs/αω � 0, and the optimal value of ω is obtained
as
ω∗ �
1 + 2λβθ(ct) − λβθ(t) − cr + cs
2
. (6)
Substituting equation (6) into equations (4) and (5), the
optimal order quantity and retail price can be obtained as
follows:
Q
∗
�
1 + 2λβθ(ct) − λβθ(t) − cs − cr
4
, (7)
P
∗
�
3 + 2λβθ(ct) + λβθ(t) + cr + cs
4
. (8)
Finally, put Q∗, P∗, and ω∗ into equations (1) and (2),
respectively, to solve the optimal profit of the supplier and
the e-commerce platform; then the profit of the whole chain
is, respectively:

Proposition 1. he improvement of freshness θ(ct), the profit
of suppliers π∗s will increase when not using BIP, the profit of
e-commerce platform π∗r will decrease, and the overall profit of
fresh e-commerce supply chain π will decrease.
Proof. Calculate θ(ct)for equations (9) and (10) to obtain the
first derivative. Combined with equations (6)–(8), it can be
seen that

-e value of function π∗s would increase with the
expanding of θ(ct), and the value of π∗r and the value of
function π would decreases. -en Proposition 1 will be
proved.
4.3.2. Set Up Decision Model When Applying Blockchain
Information Platform (BIP). Misreporting behavior will be
resolved when using BIP, and the cost consumed by the
supplier and the e-commerce platform is reduced to cB
s and
cB
r (cs＞cB
s , cr＞cB

e-commerce platform is

We also take the first derivative and the second deriv-
ative with respect to QB by backward induction. Firstly,
α2πB
r /α
2QB � −2＜0, so there is an optimal solution. Set the
first derivative to be απB
r /αQB � 0, thus acquiring QB∗ and
ΡB∗. Substitute QB∗ into equation (15), and calculate the first
and second derivatives of ωB, α2πB
s /α2ωB � −1＜0, so there is
an optimal solution. Set απB
s /αωB � 0, and the optimal
wholesale price when using BIP is obtained as

Substituting equations (17)–(19) into equations (15) and
(16), it can be obtained that the profit of the supplier and the
profit of the e-commerce platform after using the blockchain
information platform are (20) and (21), respectively:

Proposition 2. With the improvement of product reliability
coefficient λB and freshness θ(t), the profits of all parties in the
supply chain of fresh e-commerce suppliers and the overall
profits would increase.
Proof. Find the first-order partial derivatives of λB and θ(t)
with respect to equations (20)–(22), and then combine
equation (18); we can obtain

Proposition 3. When cor + cos＜min(μ1, μ2), the whole

increase with the application of the blockchain information
platform.
Proof. πB

-erefore, when cor + cos＜min(μ1, μ2), all parties and

Proposition 4. With the increase of the product reliability
coefficient λ, before and after the application of BIP, the
wholesale prices of suppliers and the retail prices of retailers in
the fresh food e-commerce supply chain both increase.

-erefore, as the freshness λ of fresh products increases,
the retail prices of fresh food supply chain suppliers will
increase before and after the application of BIP, and the
retail prices of fresh food e-commerce platforms will also
increase. It proves that people are willing to pay higher prices
for products with a high level of greenness and product
quality.
It is found that the behavior of suppliers hiding
product freshness information will damage the profit of
the e-commerce platform and the overall performance of
the supply chain through game analysis on the changes of
each member and overall profit of fresh e-commerce
supply chain before and after application of blockchain
information platform. When using the blockchain in-
formation platform, the application cost is within a cer-
tain range, which can enhance the trust among members,
increase the reliability of product information, and inhibit
the behavior of misreporting. It can not only improve the
profit of suppliers and e-commerce platform, but also
promote the overall performance with the overall profit of
the fresh supply chain.
When using the blockchain information platform, the
application cost is within a certain range, which can
improve the trust among members, increase the reli-
ability of product information, and suppress false
reporting behavior. It can improve not only the profits of
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 11
suppliers and e-commerce platforms, but also the overall
profits of the fresh supply chain. It will also increase and
improve the overall performance of the fresh e-com-
merce supply chain. According to Fu, Yonggui, and
Jianming Zhu (2021), blockchain technology will provide
new ideas for the fresh food e-commerce supply chain
[29]. According to Karamachoski (2020) blockchain
technology will bring a disruption in plenty of industries
and businesses [30].
5. Numerical Analysis
Assuming that a manufacturer and an e-commerce platform
form a secondary fresh e-commerce supply chain, they will all
adopt BIP and the market demand will be greater than zero,
while the actual situation will be modified after referring to the
literature data of Zeng Youxin [33] and Pan Liu[34]. If setting
β� 3, θ(t) � 0.2, θ(ct) � 0.25, cs � 0.13, cr � 0.15, cos � 0.01,
cor � 0.02, cB
s � 0.01, cB
r � 0.03, combining with (9), (10), (20),
and (21), we can see from Figure 6 that, in the two models
without using BIP and after using BIP, suppliers and (retailers)
fresh e-commerce platform revenue would increase with the
improvement of the reliability coefficient λ of raw product
quality information. -eir benefits after using BIP are greater
than those without using blockchain information platform (the
investment cost of blockchain is within the range of Proposition
3). Besides, the great trust relationship between consumers,
e-commerce platforms, and suppliers will be improved when
using blockchain information platform. Consumers are more
assured about the products and platform, and the platform is
more convenient for the management and cooperation.
Moreover, their overall profits would increase with the im-
provement of product reliability coefficient and freshness, thus
enhancing supply chain efficiency. Blockchain technology has
brought improvement to the performance of the whole supply
chain.
-e reliability of the product after using BIP is greater
than that without using it based on the assumed infor-
mation, so we assumed λB � 0.6 and λ� 0.4. At the same
time, considering the function of the optimal demand in
both the unused and applied BIP models, we obtain
Figure 7, which shows the trend of diversification as the
cost of investing in BIP would increase; see the chart
below. As the BIP cost paid by retailers and suppliers
increases, the order quantity and the revenue of retailers
will decrease. -ese results suggest that if retailers and
manufacturers want to gain more revenue after using BIP,
they should minimize the cost of investment in BIP and
reduce the cost of technology as much as possible.
Blockchain landing applications need to make progress
immediately to reduce costs and make the front and back
ends of the supply chain acceptable.
As shown in Figure 8, suppliers and e-commerce platforms
will continuously increase their wholesale prices and retail prices,
respectively, with the increase in BIP investment costs of fresh
suppliers and e-commerce platforms. Both wholesale price and
retail pricewould change from low to high before and after using
BIP.-erefore, the cost of BIP investment needs to be shared by
all members.-e decrease of order quantity with the increase of
investment cost is also directly related to the change of price.
-erefore, since fresh e-commerce supplier is the core enterprise
in the supply chain, it should actively coordinate the information
between the members, promote the implementation of infor-
mation sharing+cost sharing contract, make the investment
BIP cost-effectively reduced, so as to increase the supply chain
surplus and conduct appropriate pricing decisions.

sustainable stage. -e core competitiveness of price dis-
counts and distribution services is not enough to support the
long-term development of the fresh food e-commerce
supply chain. With the development and maturity of
informatization and digital technology, the digitization and
informatization of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain
is an important direction for fresh food e-commerce to
improve quality and efficiency. -e application research of
blockchain technology in various fields is gradually
strengthened. With its features such as tamper-resistant
data, traceability, information sharing, smart contracts, and
consensus mechanisms, it can optimize internal and external
factors such as food quality and safety issues, supply chain
partnerships, supply chain collaboration and integration,
actual customer experience, and information technology,
ensure the safety and control of product quality in the fresh
food e-commerce supply chain, achieve traceability of lo-
gistics information, promote the improvement of the quality
of relationships between enterprises, and achieve resource
integration and benefit distribution. As a result, the overall
performance of fresh e-commerce supply chain can be
improved.
-is paper analyzes the coupling relationship between
the characteristics of the blockchain technology and the
factors that affect the performance improvement of fresh
food e-commerce and designs a fresh food supply chain
information platform based on the consortium blockchain
to achieve the overall performance improvement of all
parties in the chain. By constructing a Stackelberg game
model between suppliers and e-commerce platforms, this
article analyzes how blockchain technology affects the re-
liability of fresh product information and how it affects
suppliers behavior of concealing the freshness of fresh
products and studies and compares the profit changes of
fresh food e-commerce supply chain before and after the
application of blockchain information platform to verify the
effect of blockchain technology on the performance im-
provement of fresh food e-commerce supply chain.
According to the research results, when the cost of investing
in a blockchain information platform is controlled within a
certain range, it can not only improve the reliability of fresh
products, but also restrain the behavior of concealment and
improve the profit and overall performance of the main
participants of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain.
