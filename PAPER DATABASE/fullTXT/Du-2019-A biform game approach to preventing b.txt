ABSTRACT
In proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain network, the blockchain miners publish blocks by contributing computing power
to solve crypto-puzzles. Due to the weak computing power of single miner, miners tend to join a mining pool and share the
profits from the mining pool according to the contribution proportions of the miners. However, some miners may initiate block
withholding attack which may result in wasting computing power, even threatening the efficiency of the blockchain network. To
address this problem, in this paper, we use the biform game model to optimize the miners’ strategy choices. We firstly formulate
the mining process as a non-cooperative–cooperative biform game model. We use the model to exhibit miners’ strategy choices
(non-cooperation stage) and the cooperation mining process (cooperation stage). Then we set the conditions to maintain the
voluntary honest behavior of miners. After that, we employ the semi-CIS (semi-the center of imputation set value) value to
compute the solutions of the cooperative games in the cooperation stage, and optimize miners’ strategy choices to prevent the
block withholding attack. Hence we can ensure the blockchain network is secure. Finally, the validity and applicability of the
proposed model and method are verified by a numerical example.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, blockchain technology has received extensive atten-
tion due to its auditability, immutability, security and anonymity.
But strictly speaking, the technology is immature. There are many
security problem. As the typical application, bitcoin has been run-
ning steadily formany years. However, the blockchainmining secu-
rity issue is remain tough. With the increasing popularity of the
blockchain technology, the blockchain mining has attracted more
and more attention. And the proof-of-work (PoW) is a commonly
used consensus mechanism for blockchain mining. Its operation
principle is as follows: miners publish blocks by contributing com-
puting power to solve crypto-puzzles and acquire profits when solv-
ing successfully. Since the blockchain system generates one block
about 10 minutes, it is difficult for most miners to produce a
block in a given period of time. In order to increase the possibil-
ity of obtaining stable profits, miners will choose to join the open
mining pool for computational share (i.e., cooperative mining).
Specifically, the miners acquire profits through accepting the less
difficult tasks released by the mining pool manager and submit-
ting the PoWs to the mining pool manager. However, in the
mining pool system, there are some miners may initiate block
withholding attack. This attack is an action that the attackers only
submit partial PoWs (PPoWs) to the mining pool manager as the

computational share. They will not submit the integral PoWs, but
discard them when they find the integral PoWs. When the min-
ing pool manager detects that the mining pool is suffering from
block withholding attack, it is very difficult to identify the attack-
ing miners. So without contributing the integral computing power,
the attackers obtain profits from the mining pool, which result
in reducing the profit of the mining pool and wasting comput-
ing power, even threatening the efficiency of the blockchain net-
work. To address this challenge, Sarker et al. [1] and Tosh et al.
[2] researched the solutions to this problem from the perspective
of mining rewards model improvement. Siamak and Maria [3] and
Chang and Park [4] improved the timestamp technology to pre-
vent the block withholding attack. Meanwhile, to prevent block
withholding attack, a solution to model the mining process as a
stochastic game has been investigated [5], which used the rein-
forcement learning method to simulate the mining pools how to
launch the block withholding attacks. Wang et al. [6] researched
the mining process with a two-stage game model and analyzed the
existence conditions of the Nash equilibrium and strategy choice
stability. Tang et al. [7] applied non-cooperative iterated game to
analyze miners behaviors, and resorted Zero-Determinant (ZD)
strategy to design strategy mechanism to solve the tragedy of the
commons problem in mining pool. Similarly, Hu et al. [8] applied
the ZD strategy to analyze the strategy choices of arbitrary twomin-
ing pools to stop block withholding attack, and the application con-
ditions of ZD strategy was given and the validity of the method was

verified. Wu et al. [9] employed pure strategy and hybrid strategy
to prove that information hiding mechanism which can increase
information asymmetry can reduce the occurrence of block with-
holding attack. Bag et al. [10] proposed cryptographic commitment
schemes combined the hash function to counter block withhold-
ing attack. According to the above analysis, we can learn that the
non-cooperative game or the evolutionary game method is gener-
ally used to avoid the block withholding attack in the mining pool.
In actual mining process, miners are not just the single relation-
ship of competition or cooperation. The relationship among them
is showing the interweaving of competition and cooperation. That
means cooperation in competition and competition in coopera-
tion. So a single non-cooperative or cooperative game approach
is not well used to demonstrate the essence of the mining prob-
lem. In view of this, we adopt the concept of the biform game that
was firstly proposed in 2007 by Brandenburger and Stuart [11] to
research the strategy optimization of miners to avoid block with-
holding attack. This kind of game is mainly divided into two stages:
the first stage is the non-cooperative game, the players in the game
choose strategies and form the strategy situations, but the strategy
situations only form the competitive environment of the second
stage, not directly generate payments; the second stage is the coop-
erative game, the players cooperate and form coalitions in the strat-
egy situations which formed in the first stage. Moreover, this stage
distributes benefits among the players, and the benefit allocation
values are as the payments of the players in the first stage.
Generally, the non-cooperative game and cooperative game are
used to solve different problems. The non-cooperative game is to
solve the strategy choice problems. Specifically, it is to study how
the players make decisions to maximize their own benefits in the
interactional situation. And it does not consider whether the play-
ers cooperate with each other and how to distribute cooperative
incomes. While the cooperative game is to solve income distribu-
tion problems. It studies how to distribute the benefits among peo-
ple when they reach cooperation. And the cooperative game does
not consider the strategy choice problems. In reality, the miners
want to obtain the benefits brought by the strategy when they make
strategy choices. The biform game realizes the combination of the
non-cooperative game and cooperative game. So it can be used
to solve the game problems including both strategy selection and
profit distribution. That is to say, the miners can obtain the strat-
egy and the benefits brought by the strategy at the same time, rather
than just acquiring one of the two.
Since the introduction of the biform game theory, its theoretical
and applied research has been in the ascendant. Such as, Ryall
and Sorenson [12] analyzed the competition problem of agents in
the framework of biform game. Gui et al. [13] used the biform
game approach to construct an incentive mechanism to encour-
age producers to participate in the design of recyclable products.
Mahjoub and Hennet [14] applied the biform game to describe
the supply network design problem under the market expecta-
tion price elasticity demand. Feess and Thun [15] researched the
biform game model based on the Shapley value, and used it to
solve the strategy choice and revenue distribution problems in
the supply chain. Kim [16] solved the low flexibility and adapt-
ability problem of wireless body area network (WBAN) by build-
ing a WBAN resource sharing reverse-biform game model. In this
paper, we formulate the mining process as a biform game model
to optimize miners’ strategy choices. For the two stages of the
non-cooperative–cooperative biform game, we employ the semi-
CIS (semi-the center of imputation set value) value to compute the
solutions of the cooperative games in the cooperation stage. And
the obtained benefit allocation values are as the payments of the
players in the non-cooperation stage. Then the pure strategy Nash
equilibrium solution in the non-cooperation stage is obtained. Spe-
cial emphasis on one point: the biform game method can always
guarantee to be the pure strategy Nash equilibrium solution, while
the Nash equilibrium of the non-cooperative game is a mixed strat-
egy in most cases. Due to the fact that the mixed strategy cannot
be implemented or applied well in practical problems, we apply the
biform game model to better instruct miners to choice strategy.
Finally, we achieve the goal of preventing block withholding attack.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs
the mining pool biform game model. This section describes the
problem of miners strategy choices in the non-cooperation stage,
the problem of miners mining in cooperation stage and the charac-
teristic functions of cooperative games. On the basis of the defini-
tions and properties of the semi-CIS value in the cooperation stage
and the Nash equilibrium solutions in the non-cooperation stage,
the solvingmethod and procedures of themining pool biform game
model are summarized in Section 3. In Section 4, the validity and
applicability of the proposed model and method are verified by a
numerical example. Finally, the conclusions are stated in Section 5.
2. SYSTEM MODELS
2.1. Miner Strategy Choice in
Non-Cooperation Stage
There are nminers in amining pool, where theminers are regarded
as the players. LetN = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} be the finite miner (i.e., player)
set, where i (i ∈ N) is the ith miner and n ≥ 3. For the block with-
holding attack, the strategy choices of miners can be expressed as
two types: the malicious strategy which means the miners discard
the integral PoWs when they find them and share the profit from
the mining pool with submitting the partial PoWs, and the hon-
est strategy which means the miners honestly mine and submit
completed PoWs to the mining pool manager. When a small part
of miners choose the malicious strategy but other miners do not
choose this strategy, they can continuously acquire mining prof-
its. That is, miners can initiate block withholding attack to increase
their own profits. But the profits of theminers with the honest strat-
egy are reduced due to the attack action. Besides, it is worth noting
the available computing power of themining pool decides the prob-
ability of the mining pool to gain a profit. If all the miners choose
the malicious strategy, they will get nothing. Therefore, miners will
make strategy choices to maximize their own profits during the
mining process. Let Gi = {0, 1} denote the miner i’s strategy set,
and Sk =
(
gk1, gk2, … , gki, … , gkn
)
∈ {0, 1}n denote the kth situ-
ation, where the miner i ∈ N, and gki ∈ Gi = {0, 1}. gki = 0
means the miner i chooses the malicious strategy in the situation k;
while gki = 1means the miner i chooses the honest strategy in the
situation k.
All of theminers will form 2n situations when nminers respectively
choose their own strategies. Such as, there are threeminers 1, 2, and
3 in the mining pool, and there will form 23 = 8 situations. The
details are shown in Table 1.
X-L. Du et al. / International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 12(2) 1353–1360 1355
The situation S1 = (0, 0, 0) denotes all the miners choose the mali-
cious strategy. And the situation S2 = (0, 1, 0) means the miner 2
chooses the honest strategy while both the miner 1 and miner 3
choose themalicious strategy. Thus, themeaning of other situations
can be interpreted by the similar way.
2.2. Problem and Method in Cooperation
Stage
The first stage is non-cooperation in biform game model which is
different from the two-stage game model due to payoffs unknown
a prior. We have cooperation rather than non-cooperation second-
stage games for the following reasons.
In the mining pool system, the mining pool manager divides the
mining task into a number of subtasks which are less difficult and
sends them to theminers. Then theminers receive the subtasks and
submit the completed PoWs to the mining pool manager, which
means that the miners participate in cooperative mining. So how to
pay profits to the cooperativeminers is a cooperative gameproblem,
where theminers are regarded as the players. Another reason is that
the benefits ofminers participating inmining cooperation aremore
than those they do alone.
In addition, the payoff values of the two-stage game can be directly
determined in the first non-cooperation stage, while those of the
biform game are computed based on the calculation results of sec-
ond cooperation stage.
In this paper, the cooperative game is expressed as (N,V (Sk)),
whereV (Sk) denotes the profit function (or characteristic function)
in the situation Sk. Stated as above, miners may choose honest or
malicious strategy. Thereby, considering the influence of the min-
ers with the honest strategy, the profit function is constructed as the
following rule. That is, the greater the number of the miners with
the honest strategy in the mining pool, the higher the probability
for the mining pool to mine successfully, and the higher probability
for themining pool to win amining competition with other mining
pools in the blockchain network. To prevent miners from choosing
themalicious strategy, we restrict miners behaviors by adjusting the
cost per unit computing power. The details are given as follows: for
any coalition T ⊆ N, the profit function V (Sk) (T) of T in the situ-
ation Sk can be expressed as
V (Sk) (T) = (R + 𝜃s) 1w

The definitions of the parameters used in Eq. (1) are listed in
Table 2. 
Further, 𝜔ih = 𝜔i and 𝜔jm = 𝜔j, where 𝜔i is the computing power
of theminer i determined by the built-in chip of itsminingmachine
and 𝜔j is the computing power of the miner j. By using the sub-
subscripts m and h to denote the miner’s strategy choice. Then the
costs of cooperative mining for the miner iwith the honest strategy
and theminer jwith the malicious strategy are denoted by 𝜆𝜔ih and
𝛾𝜆𝜔jm , respectively. 𝜔G = ∑
i, j∈N
(
𝜔i + 𝜔j
)
denotes the sum of the
computing power of all the miners in the mining pool. That is, it
is the computing power of the mining pool, which can be obtained
by the mining pool detection technology. In this study, we consider
is the situation of a single mining pool. So we can take it as constant
when the mining pool is determined and the number of miners in

Theorem 1. Assume that (R + 𝜃s) /𝜔 is constant. Then, for any
coalition T ⊆ N, the more miners with the honest strategy in
the coalition, the more profit of the coalition obtain if 0 < 𝜆 <
[(R + 𝜃s)𝜔l] / (𝜔𝜔G), where 𝜔l = min {𝜔i}.
Proof. Give a miner p
(
p ∈ H ⊆ T
)
with the honest strategy in the
coalition T, then the profit of the coalition T is

If the miner p changes the strategy to the malicious strategy, then
the profit of the coalition T is

where,H′ = H \p. The strategy choice of theminer p is changed, but

If 0 < 𝜆 < [(R + 𝜃s)𝜔l] / (𝜔𝜔G), where 𝜔l = min {𝜔i}, we can
obtain Vm (Sk) (T) – V′m (Sk) (T) > 0, which means the more min-
ers with the honest strategy in the coalition, the more profit of the
coalition obtained.
For example, a coalition U (U ⊆ N) which has b
(
b ≤ |U|
)
miners
with the honest strategy can obtain the profitV (Sk) (U). If the num-
ber of the miners with the honest strategy is decreased to b – 1, the
profit of the coalition U is V′(Sk)(U), then we have V (Sk) (U) >
V′ (Sk) (U).
If T = {i}, there is only one miner in the coalition, then the profit of
the coalition is

when the miner i chooses the malicious strategy.
If T = N, i.e., the grand coalition consists of all the miners, then the
profit of the grand coalition is

𝜔 (R + 𝜃s) – 𝜆𝜔G,
when all the miners choose the honest strategy.
Simultaneously, the profit of the grand coalition is

𝜔 (R + 𝜃s) – 𝜆𝛾𝜔G,
when all the miners choose the malicious strategy.
3. MODEL SOLVING METHOD AND
PROCEDURES
In this section, based on the analysis of the definitions and prop-
erties of the semi-CIS value in the cooperation stage and the Nash
equilibrium solutions in the non-cooperation stage, the solving
method and procedures of the mining pool biform game model are
proposed.
X-L. Du et al. / International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 12(2) 1353–1360 1357
3.1. Semi-CIS Value
The semi-CIS value is one of important single-valued solutions of
cooperative games. It first assigns each player (i.e., miner) to indi-
vidual worth, and then distributes the remaining income of the
grand coalition equally among all players [17,18].
Definition 1. For a n-person (i.e., miner) cooperative game
(N,V (Sk)), where Sk is the situation, N = {1, 2, ..., n} is the finite
player (i.e., miner) set and V (Sk) is the characteristic function,
the semi-CIS value is a n-dimensional vector, i.e., SCIS (V (Sk)) =
(SCIS1 (V (Sk)) , SCIS2 (V (Sk)) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk)))T .
Here, for any player i ∈ N, there is
SCISi (V (Sk) = 𝛼i [V (Sk) ({i})] +
1
n {V (Sk) (N)
– ∑
j∈N,j≠i
𝛼j [V (Sk)
(
{j}
)
]}
(2)
where 𝛼j ∈ [0, 1] is the selfish level which indicate the participation
cooperative possibility of any player j ∈ N in the game. Eq. (2) is the
semi-CIS value of any player i in the cooperative game (N,V (Sk)).
The calculation of the semi-CIS value is only related to the values of
the grand coalition and the individuals, not related to other inter-
mediate coalitions’ values. This is similar to the real miner’s profit
calculation, which the miner’s profit concerns only about the com-
puting power of each miner contributing and the entire computing
power of the mining pool.
The semi-CIS value satisfies collective effectiveness. Namely,
∑
i∈N
SCISi (V (Sk)) = V (Sk) (N) .
Definition 2. For any players i, j ∈ N and i ∈ M, j ∉ M,M ⊆ N,
the maximal complaint of the player i ∈ M over another player
j ∉ M at the payoff vector SCIS (M,V (Sk)) is defined by the maxi-
mal complaint among coalitions containing the player i, but not the
player j. That is,
mv
ij (𝛼, SCIS) = max { ̂e (M, SCIS)
= ∑
i∈M
SCISi (V (Sk) (M)) – ∑
i∈M
𝛼i [V (Sk)
({i})] |M ⊆ N, i ∈ M, j ∉ M} ,
where SCISi (V (Sk) (M)) is the real profit allocation value of the
player i in the coalition M, and 𝛼i [V (Sk) ({i})] is the proportion
allocation value of the player i in the coalitionMwhen it does alone.
Moreover, for any players i, j ∈ N, if mv
ij (𝛼, SCIS) = mv
ji (𝛼, SCIS),
then the semi-CIS value satisfies equal maximal complaint
property.
Definition 3. Assume that there exist two cooperative games
(N,V (Sk)) and (N,W (Sk)) such that they satisfy 𝛼i [V (Sk) ({i})] ≥
𝛼′i [V (Sk) ({i})], where i ∈ N. If SCISi (V (Sk)) ≥ SCISi (W (Sk)),
then the semi-CIS value satisfies semi individual monotonicity
property.
Definition 4. Assume that there exist a 𝛼–inessential games
(N,V (Sk)) = ∑
i∈N
𝛼i [V (Sk) ({i})] , |N| ≥ 2, where i ∈ N. If
SCISi (V (Sk)) = 𝛼i [V (Sk) ({i})], then the semi-CIS value satisfies
semi inessential game property.
According to Definitions 1–4, it is straightforward to prove the fol-
lowing conclusion, i.e., Theorem 2 (Here we omit the proof).
Theorem 2. The semi-CIS value is the unique value, which satisfies
efficiency, equal maximal complaint property, linearity, semi inessen-
tial game property, and semi individual monotonicity.
3.2. Nash Equilibrium Solutions in
Non-Cooperation Stage
Definition 5. For a biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V), where m is the
total number of situations that can be formed and N = {1, 2, ..., n}
is the finite player set, Gi is the strategy set of any player i ∈ N
and V (Sk) is the characteristic function, we assume there exists
a situation Sk∗ = (s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., sik∗ , ..., snk∗ ) , (k∗ ∈ {1, 2, ...,m}),
where sik∗ is the strategy of the player i ∈ N in the situation
k∗ and sik∗ ∈ Gi, for each player i in any situation (ri, s–ik∗ ) =(
s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., si–1,k∗ , ri, si+1,k∗ , ..., snk∗
)
, where ri ∈ Gi and s–ik∗ =(
s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., si–1,k∗ , si+1,k∗ , ..., snk∗
)
in G–i, if the following inequal-
ity is valid
SCISi (V (Sk∗ )) = 𝛼i [V (Sk∗ ) ({i})] +
1
n [V (Sk∗ ) (N)
– ∑
j∈N,j≠i
𝛼j [V (Sk∗ )
(
{j}
)
] ≥ SCISi (V (ri, s–ik∗ ))
then Sk∗ = (s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ) is called the pure strategy Nash
equilibrium of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V). And the cor-
responding Nash equilibrium value SCISi (V (Sk∗ )) is the profit
of the player i ∈ N in the situation Sk∗ . Hereby, the Nash
equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) is
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))}.
Definition 6. Sk∗ ∈ {S1, S2, ..., Sm} is the effective strategy sit-
uation of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) if V (Sk∗ ) (N) =
max
1≤k≤m
{V (Sk) (N)} .
Obviously, Definition 6 means the profit of the grand coalition
reaches the maximum value in the effective strategy situation.
Further, we can prove the following three conclusions by using Def-
initions 1–6.
Theorem 3. Assume that the characteristic function
of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) satisfies efficiency
and equal maximal complaint property. For any strategy
ri ∈ Gi (i = 1, 2, ..., n), if V (Sk∗ ) (N) ≥ V (ri, s–ik∗ ) (N),
where Sk∗ = (s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ), (k∗ ∈ {1, 2, ...,m}), then
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) .
Corollary 1. For any strategy ri ∈ Gi (i = 1, 2, ..., n), if
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V),
then we can obtain V (Sk∗ ) (N) ≥ V (ri, s–ik∗ ) (N).

Theorem 4. Assume that the characteristic function of
the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) satisfies Independence
property (ID) and No coordination property (NC). If
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V), then
Sk∗ = (s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ) is an effective strategy situation.
Theorem 5. Assume that the characteristic function of
the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) satisfies ID. If Sk∗ =
(s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ) is an effective strategy situation, then
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V).
Corollary 2. Assume that the characteristic func-
tion of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) satisfies
V (Sk)
(
{j}
)
= V (ri, s–ik∗ )
(

) (
j = 1, 2, ..., n
)
and NC. If
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V),
then Sk∗ = (s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ) is an effective strategy situation.
Corollary 3. Assume that the characteristic function of
the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V) satisfies V (Sk)
(
{j}
)
=
V (ri, s–ik∗ )
(
{j}
) (
j = 1, 2, ..., n

and NC. If Sk∗ =
(s1k∗ , s2k∗ , ..., snk∗ ) is an effective strategy situation, then
{Sk∗ ; (SCIS1 (V (Sk∗ )) , SCIS2 (V (Sk∗ )) , ..., SCISn (V (Sk∗ )))} is the
Nash equilibrium solution of the biform game (S1, S2, ..., Sm;V).
3.3. Solution Steps
From the above discussion, the solution steps of the mining pool
biform game model are summarized as follows:
Step 1. (the non-cooperation stage): All the miners in the mining
pool choose strategies and execute strategy combinations to form
strategy situation Sk (k = 1, 2, ...,m).
Step 2. (the cooperation stage): For any strategy situation
Sk (k = 1, 2, ...,m) formed by the miners, we construct the cooper-
ative games. Simultaneously, according to Eq. (1), we construct the
characteristic functions.
Step 3. (the solution of cooperation stage): We calculate the semi-
CIS SCISi (V (Sk)) of each miner i (i = 1, 2, ..., n) in the situation
Sk (k = 1, 2, ...,m) by using Eq. (2).
Step 4. (the solution of non-cooperation stage): The semi-CIS
SCISi (V (Sk)) value obtained in the third step is used as payment
vector value of each miner under the strategy situation Sk in the
non-cooperation stage. Then we construct the non-cooperative
game and solve the Nash equilibrium solutions. That is to analyze
and solve the Nash equilibrium solutions in the non-cooperative
game.
According to the pure strategy Nash equilibrium solutions in the
fourth step, we can determine the strategy choice of the entire min-
ing pool. That is to say, we can get a mining pool strategy to max-
imize the profits (or utilities) of each miner and the entire mining
pool.
4. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Let us consider a simple example: there are three miners (i.e., play-
ers) 1, 2, and 3 in a mining pool. In order to obtain high profit, the
miners 1, 2, and 3 have to make strategy choices. Stated as earlier,
they have two strategies to choose: the malicious strategy (remark
0) and the honest strategy (remark 1). We set system parameters as
follows: R + 𝜃s = 15, 𝜔 = 200, and 𝛾 = 0.3. The miners’ com-
puting powers are 𝜔1 = 3, 𝜔2 = 5, and 𝜔3 = 2, respectively.
So the entire computing power of the mining pool is 𝜔G = 10.
It is easily to get 𝜔l = min {𝜔i} = 2. And we set 𝜆 = 0.01 ≤
(1 – 𝛾) [(R + 𝜃s)𝜔l/ (𝜔𝜔G)] = 0.0105. The selfish levels of themin-
ers are 𝛼1 = 0.8, 𝛼2 = 0.2 and 𝛼3 = 0.6, respectively.
4.1. Solving the Cooperative Game Stage
The above example is related both strategy choices (non-
cooperation stage) and mutual cooperation (cooperation stage)
among the miners 1, 2, and 3. Consequently, it can be seen as a
biform game problem. We can use the solution steps in Section 3.3
to solve this problem.
Stated as earlier, the strategy situations formed by the miners 1, 2,
and 3 are shown in Table 1. According to Eq. (1) and Table 1, we cal-
culate the coalitions profits (or utilities) in every strategy situation
as shown in Table 3 (This article only lists the profit values of the
grand coalition and the individual miner coalition). Remark:When
the calculation result is negative, we take 0.
4.2. Solving the Non-Cooperative
Game Stage
According to Eq. (2), we calculate the semi-CIS value SCISi (V (Sk))
of eachminer i (i = 1, 2, ..., n) as shown inTable 4.We can see all the
miners’ profits are zero if all of them choose the malicious strategy.
Then taking the semi-CIS values in Table 4 as the corresponding
profit values of the miners in various strategy situations. For each
strategy situation, we calculate the sum of the profit values of all the
miners, i.e., calculating the total profit value in the situation, which
is expressed as
SCIS (V (Sk)) (N) = ∑
i∈N
SCISi (V (Sk)) (N) .
The calculation results are shown in Table 5.
In the following, we take the maximum value of SCIS (V (Sk)) (N),
i.e., max {SCIS (V (Sk)) (N)}. According to Theorem 4 and
Theorem 5, we analyze whether the strategy corresponding
to the maximum value is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium
solution. Then we analyze the sub-maximum. We repeat the
above steps until there are no other pure strategy Nash equilib-
rium solutions. Specifically, we firstly sequence the total profit
values SCIS (V (Sk)) (N), (k∗ ∈ {1, 2, ...,m}) for all situations
according to Tables 3 and 4, then we take the maximum value
max
1≤k≤8
{SCIS (V (Sk)) (N)}. The sequence of the total profit values
is shown as follows: SCIS (V (S8)) = 0.6712 > SCIS (V (S6)) =
0.5782 > ... > SCIS (V (S3)) = 0.0166 > SCIS (V (S1)) = 0.
And the maximum value is max
1≤k≤8
{SCIS (V (Sk)) (N)} =
SCIS (V (S8)) = 0.6712, i.e., the profit of the entire min-
ing pool reaches the maximum value when all the miners
choose the honest strategy to form the strategy situation
S8 = (1, 1, 1). And the corresponding semi-CIS value

Thereby, the solution of the biform game is
{S8; (SCIS1 (V (S8)) , SCIS2 (V (S8)) , SCIS3 (V (S8)))} =
{(1, 1, 1) ; (0.2355, 0.2322, 0.2035)}.
Further analysis can obtain that V (S8) (N) ≥
V
(
ri, s–ik∗,8
)
(N) (i = 1, 2, 3), which is consistent with the conclu-
sion of Theorem 4. That is, when a player in the game changes its
strategy and the other players do not change their strategies, its
profit value will be less than that in the current strategy situation.
Hence, the strategy situation S8 = (1, 1, 1) is the pure strategy Nash
equilibrium solution of the non-cooperation stage in this biform
game model.
Analogously, the corresponding strategy situation of sub-
maximum value SCIS (V (S6)) = 0.5782 is S6 = (1, 1, 0),
and the corresponding solution of the biform game is
{S6; (SCIS1 (V (S6)) , SCIS2 (V (S6)) , SCIS3 (V (S6)))} =
{(1, 1, 0) ; (0.2072, 0.2038, 0.1672)}.
BecauseV (S8) (N) ≥ V (S6) (N), the strategy situation S6 = (1, 1, 0)
does not satisfy Theorem 4. It is not the pure strategy Nash equilib-
rium solution of the non-cooperation in this biform game model.
Repeat the above steps until all pure strategyNash equilibrium solu-
tions are obtained.
Through the above analysis, we can conclude that S8 = (1, 1, 1)
is the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the biform
game. So the mining pool and each miner get the optimal
profits when all the miners choose the honest strategy. The
corresponding Nash equilibrium value is (0.2355, 0.2322, 0.2035).
That is, the mining pool biform game model solution
is {S8; (SCIS1 (V (S8)) , SCIS2 (V (S8)) , SCIS3 (V (S8)))} =
{(1, 1, 1) ; (0.2355, 0.2322, 0.2035)}
5. CONCLUSIONS
In order to preventminers from initiating blockwithholding attack,
this paper models the mining process as a biform game, wherein
the miners might choose whether to attack or not. And we set con-
straints to maintain the voluntary honest behavior of miners dur-
ing the cooperation stage. Though analyzing and researching the
numerical example, we can conclude that the biform game can
well solve the miners strategy choices and benefits distribution
problems, and can prevent the block withholding attack effectively.
Moreover, the biform game can make up for the shortcomings
of using the single cooperative game or non-cooperative game
method. Specifically, it makes up the deficiency of non-cooperative
game that the players only care about strategy design without
considering the payoff distribution of coalitions. Simultaneously,
it also remedy the cooperative game only analyze the coalition
1360 X-L. Du et al. / International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 12(2) 1353–1360
formation and its payoff distribution without taking into account
strategy design and selection. Besides, the solutions of the biform
gamemust be the pure strategy Nash equilibrium solution, so it can
better guide the miners strategy choice.
In this paper, we propose the semi-CIS value, which can guaran-
tee the existence and uniqueness of the solution in the cooperation
stage, to solve the payoff values of cooperative game. And the exis-
tence conditions of the solution of the biform game are given. In
summary, this paper not only provides a new solution to the min-
ers’ action of initiating block withholding attack problem, but also
enriches the application research of the biform game method.
This study only considers the influence of computing power on the
profit of the mining pool, but there are many other factors to affect
the profit of the mining pool such as mining machine, mining pool
site. And this study is only applicable to the case that the number of
miners in themining pool is constant. Not considering the dynamic
change in the number ofminers in themining pool. Sowewill carry
out the above researches in the future.
