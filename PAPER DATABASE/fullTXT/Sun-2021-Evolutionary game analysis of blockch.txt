Abstract: Because of the risks existing in supply chain finance, taking accounts receivable factoring
business as the research object, this paper uses the evolutionary game method to analyzes the factors
affecting the decision-making of the participants in supply chain finance, constructs an evolutionary
game model between small and medium-sized enterprises and financial institutions, and analyzes
the mechanism of blockchain to solve the financial risks of the supply chain by comparing the
changes of evolutionary stability strategies before and after the introduction of blockchain technology.
This paper aims to reduce financing risks by analyzing the mechanism of blockchain technology
in supply chain finance. It is found that, firstly, blockchain technology can reduce the credit risk
of financial institutions and solve financing problem. Credit risk plays a decisive role in whether
financial institutions accept financing business decisions. Blockchain technology can reduce the
operational risk of financial institutions and improve the business income of financial institutions.
Secondly, the strict regulatory environment formed by blockchain technology makes the default
behavior of small and medium-sized enterprises and core enterprises in a high-risk state at all times.
No matter the profit distribution proportion that small and medium-sized enterprises can obtain
through collusion, they will not choose to default, which effectively solves the paradox that small
and medium-sized enterprises cannot obtain loans from financial institutions despite the increased
probability of compliance. Then, the evolutionary game between financial institutions and small and
medium-sized enterprises is balanced in that financial institutions accept business applications, small
and medium-sized enterprises abide by the contract, and the convergence effect is better. Therefore,
blockchain technology not only reduces the financing risk of financial institutions but also helps to
solve the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.

1. Introduction
The increasing competition forces enterprises in the supply chain to establish business
alliances based on the commonality of commodity flow, capital flow, and information flow,
aiming to reduce costs and improve competitive strength [1]. However, in the transaction
process of the alliance, the increased difficulty of risk control caused by information
asymmetry has led financial institutions to raise the threshold for enterprises to finance,
thus increasing the difficulty of financing for alliance enterprises [2]. Supply chain finance
(SCF) originates from this background, which provides a new way to solve the financing
difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reduce the financing risk of
financial institutions.
Although SCF provides a feasible way to solve the financing difficulties of enterprises,
the problems such as insufficient information penetration in the whole chain, weaken-
ing data quality, low payment and settlement efficiency, and shallow credit transmission
levels [3], increase the credit risk of financial institutions. Therefore, financial institutions

must pay more credit investigation cost to evaluate the credit status of enterprises before
lending [4]. The basic features of blockchain technology such as decentralization, traceabil-
ity, tamper-proof, and smart contract [5,6] have effectively broken the information barriers
within and between organizations [7] and provided a new idea for preventing and solving
the risk issues in SCF [8]. Relevant research has shown that there are four main ways
for blockchain technology to promote the development of SCF: (1) distributed records
solve information asymmetry; (2) data traceability improves enterprise supervision; (3) the
decentralized characteristics increases the efficiency of clearing and settlement; (4) smart
contract technology resolves operational risk [9]. SCF has three financing modes: accounts
receivable, inventory pledge, and prepaid accounts. In different financing businesses,
the mechanism of blockchain technology is different [10]. However, the research on the
utilization of blockchain technology in SCF mainly focuses on mechanism design [11,12],
application optimization [13–15], and technology optimization [10,16–18]. In addition,
some studies have analyzed the mechanism of blockchain technology to optimize SCF in
combination with specific cases, and designed new financial management solutions, which
confirmed that blockchain technology is beneficial to improving the efficiency of business
operations [19,20]. The research on the mechanism of employing blockchain technology to
prevent risks in SCF is not sufficient.
SCF mainly involves three subjects: SMEs, core enterprises, and financial institutions.
As the supplier of traded commodities, SMEs initiate financing business applications
to financial institutions after the core enterprises confirm the receipt and form accounts
receivable vouchers. Therefore, SMEs are also the demand side of funds. As the demanders
of traded commodities, core enterprises issue accounts receivable vouchers and provide
financing guarantees for SMEs. Financial institutions are the suppliers of funds in SCF.
After evaluating the credit level of SMEs and core enterprises, they decide whether to
provide funding. The decision-making behavior of each subject in SCF is a dynamic
and repeated process. On the one hand, the default of SMEs will have an impact on
whether the core enterprises continue to cooperate with them in the later stage, and then
affect the performance choice of SMEs. On the other hand, whether financial institutions
are willing to make loans depends not only on whether SMEs have core enterprises as
guarantees and the credit situation of core enterprises, but also on the early credit situation
of SMEs. Therefore, each subject needs to make repeated choices based on historical data
and realistic conditions so that the system may eventually present various equilibrium
states. There are mainly credit risks and operational risks in this process. Different types
of risks will have different degrees of impact on the decision-making. In combination
with the decision-makers different behavior tendencies, clarifying the mechanism and
conditions of blockchain technology to reduce risks and to affect the decision-making of
participants is the premise for the rational application of blockchain technology. Based
on the limited rationality of participants, the evolutionary game emphasizes the dynamic
process of equilibrium evolution. By analyzing equilibrium solutions, the evolutionary
game can provide a reliable method for studying the action mechanism of blockchain
technology in SCF.
At present, there are many game studies on the application of blockchain technology
to SCF by starting with pledge business [21], and this paper will also follow this practice.
Accounts receivable factoring is a common product in SCF. It has important practical value
for solving the shortage of operating funds of enterprises. Accounts receivable factoring
business can effectively make up for the SME’s funding gap [22]. The factoring business of
accounts receivable can be divided into two modes: with recourse and non-recourse. Some
studies have built a non-recourse factoring financing model for accounts receivable [23].
Most studies show the impact of account receivable factoring business on supply chain
performance and SMEs financing strategies [24–27]. However, the existing research ignores
the sequence of repayment date and due date of accounts receivable in the process of real
pledges, as well as the differences between core enterprises or SMEs, which violates the
embodiment of the practical value of SCF. In addition, most existing studies sort out the
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2826
influencing factors of financing participants’ decision-making in a static way [28], ignoring
the sequence between financial institutions’ credit investigation and their decision-making,
and did not highlight the action mechanism of blockchain technology in the game process.
Therefore, this paper takes the accounts receivable factoring business as the research
object, applies the evolutionary game analysis method, divides the default behavior of
SMEs into two types: unilateral default and collusion with core enterprises, and analyzes
the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) between financial institutions and SMEs. By
comparing the stability of the equilibrium strategy before and after introducing blockchain
technology, this paper defines the main factors affecting the decision-making process and
the mechanism that how blockchain technology makes the system stable by resolving risks.
The rest parts of this paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, the basic problems
studied in this paper are described, and assumptions are presented. Game models before
and after the introduction of blockchain technology into SCF are established and analyzed
in Section 3. A numerical example in agricultural supply chain ASC are presented in
Section 4 to verify our results from the models. Section 5 concludes the paper and puts up
the main conclusions.
2. Problem Description and Basic Assumptions
2.1. Problem Description
In the factoring business of accounts receivable (with right of recourse), SMEs transfer
accounts receivable certificates issued by core enterprises to financial institutions and the
claims on accounts receivable are transferred. The business process is shown in Figure 1.

(5) confirm transfer
Figure 1. The process of accounts receivable factoring business.
There are 7 main procedures in the process of accounts receivable factoring business
in the SCF.
(1) The SME signs up supply contract with the core enterprise;
(2) After the SME delivered the goods, the core enterprise confirms the receipt, and
signs the accounts receivable;
(3) The SME initiates factoring business with the financial institution, transfers the
accounts receivable and opens factoring collection accounts;
(4) The SME notifies the core enterprise to confirm that the creditor’s rights in the
accounts receivable have been transferred;
(5) The financial institution confirms to the core enterprise;
(6) The financial institution reviews contracts and invoices, then issues payments after
confirming that the transaction exists;
(7) The core enterprise pay the amount in full on the due date.
The factoring business of accounts receivable mainly involves credit risks and opera-
tional risks as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Risks in factoring business of accounts receivable in SCF.
The consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology can reduce risks and provide
low-cost financing services for enterprises in the supply chain [8]. As the main risk source,
credit risk mainly includes three aspects.
(1) Low credit level of the core enterprise. The essence of the factoring of accounts
receivable is that the core enterprise uses its credit as the guarantee for credit endorsement.
Financial institutions accept SMEs financing services based on the operating conditions and
credit ratings of core enterprises. The risks generated by core enterprises stem from their op-
erations and their credit level. Therefore, when there is a problem with the core enterprise’s
operating ability or credit level, it often brings the basic risk to the whole business.
(2) Operational risks of SMEs. In the factoring business of accounts receivable, al-
though there is credit endorsement with the accounts receivable of core enterprises as
collateral, the main body of loan repayment is still SMEs. If the debt repayment capabilities
of SMEs is low, SMEs may choose to default because they are unable to repay the payments,
and the financing risk of financial institutions increases. Therefore, the debt repayment
capabilities of SMEs will affect the recovery of loan amounts.
(3) Principal-agent risk of the system. When the core enterprise grant loans, SMEs
might collude with the core enterprise to conceal the real cooperative relationship and
credit status, and then forge false contracts, bills, and certificates to defraud bank funds.
The problem of information asymmetry makes it difficult for financial institutions to
accurately evaluate their business, and thus wrongly grant loans to the high-risk business
as a low-risk business.
Operational risks in the accounts receivable factoring business mainly include manage-
ment risks and accidents that may occur during the business promotion. The complexity
of the business transaction process makes its processing is highly dependent on manual
completion, which has the problems of high business cost, high operational risk, and
low income.
Credit risks and operational risks caused by information asymmetry make it diffi-
cult for financial institutions and SMEs to determine whether their choice optimize their
returns [29,30]. Therefore, financial institutions might choose to accept or decline the ap-
plications of SMEs’ factoring business by considering credit risks and operational risks,
and SMEs may choose to comply to maximize their profits or not. In addition, the credit
of the core enterprise also plays an important role. It may not pay to the bank-designated
account by the payment promise, but choose to collude with SMEs. Therefore, the “not
comply” of SMEs includes two possibilities: SMEs themselves default and collude with
core enterprises.
Blockchain technology is based on the transaction accounting rules generated between
mutually distrustful nodes, which strengthens the credit value of the supply chain structure
and effectively resolves the credit risk and operational risk in the factoring business of
accounts receivable. On the one hand, blockchain technology can reduce manual interven-
tion. It digitizes paperwork-dependent procedures through smart contract technology, so
as to improve business efficiency and reduce operational risk. On the other hand, for the
credit risk in the business, if the enterprise changes the data or tampers with the existing
information after default, it will pay a high cost. If an enterprise’s breach of contract is
found, the whole-network broadcasting characteristics of blockchain technology will cause
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2828
huge losses to the enterprise’s reputation. Moreover, blockchain technology provides
strong proof for the transaction of new funds. The transaction records generated will
permanently exist in the credit history of the enterprise. If SMEs apply for financing again
after default, it will be difficult to be trusted again. Thus, the essence of SCF risk is the
existence of information asymmetry. Blockchain technology can effectively solve the prob-
lem of information asymmetry. It only needs fewer platform use fees, so that participants
can obtain the benefits brought by information sharing. Specifically, financial institutions
relying on blockchain technology can reduce credit investigation costs, improve business
efficiency, reduce financing risks, and then reduce operation costs and risk losses. And,
SMEs improve the availability of loans by standardizing their behavior.
2.2. Basic Assumptions and Model Parameters
The loan repayment behavior of SMEs can be divided into compliance and non-
compliance [22], but the reasons why SMEs choose to default is still not clarified. Although
a non-recourse account receivable financing model has been constructed [23], most finan-
cial institutions will choose a recourse account receivable financing model due to risk
considerations. In addition, the existing research ignores the sequence between financial
institutions’ credit investigation and their decision-making, and does not highlight the
action mechanism of blockchain technology in the game process. Therefore, according to
the factoring process in SCF, we make the following assumptions.
(1) In real business, accounts receivable financing mostly occurs in the upstream of
the supply chain [31]. Therefore, we only discuss the business system composed of SMEs,
core enterprises, and financial institutions in the upstream of the supply chain.
(2) The financial institution has two strategies: accept or decline the accounts receivable
financing application of the SME. Let the probabilities be x and 1− x, respectively. The
SME also has two strategies: compliance or non-compliance. Suppose the probabilities
are y and 1− y, respectively. When the SME chooses to abide by the contract, it fulfills the
contract with the core enterprise and supplies products to the core enterprise on time with
qualified quality and quantity. When the SME chooses not to abide by the contract, it may
construct a false transaction contract with the core enterprise to defraud loans (assuming
the probability of occurrence is α), or it unilaterally fails to perform or fully perform the
supply contract with the core enterprise (assuming the probability of occurrence is 1− α).
(3) Suppose the total amount of accounts receivable is R. When the SME applies for
factoring financing of accounts receivable to financial institutions, financial institutions
first conduct credit audits on the SME and the related core enterprise. Assuming that the
cost of credit review is Cb. After the audit, if the financial institution chooses to accept the
factoring financing business of accounts receivable, it will pay a loan of kR (k generally
70–80%) to the SME. At the same time, the SME transfers accounts receivable vouchers
to financial institutions, and the creditor’s rights have been transferred. If the financial
institution chooses to decline the factoring financing business of accounts receivable after
credit investigation for the SME and the related core enterprise, the financial institution
can use the amount of kR for other businesses (such as short-term loans), and the yield is
assumed to be rb.
(4) It is assumed that the rate of return of the SME during normal production is rp. The
cost of producing the goods required by the contract is C. The SME may default or abide
by the contract after receiving loans from financial institutions. When the SME defaults
and jointly defrauds loans with the core enterprise, the benefit distribution ratio obtained
by SME is assumed to be P(0 < P < 1). If the SME defaults unilaterally, the core enterprise
will repay the debt in an amount lower than the nominal value, and the SME will pay the
remaining amount (based on the recourse of the financial institution). The default of the
SME will cause it to lose the opportunity of follow-up cooperation with the core enterprise.
Suppose that the total cost paid by the SME is Cp.
(5) Blockchain technology can carry out transaction endorsement and guarantee
verification beyond the third party, and pass the credit of core enterprises layer by layer,
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2829
so as to help the SME finance and improve the income of the whole supply chain. Driven
by the blockchain, the information is highly transparent, and the information acquisition
cost of each subject in the supply chain is almost zero. Therefore, it is assumed that the
default cost of SMEs after using blockchain technology is C′p and C′p → ∞. Moreover, in
this situation, the financial institution does not need to pay the credit investigation cost Cb.
Instead, the financial institution needs to pay the construction and maintenance cost M of
the blockchain platform, but M� Cb.
Based on the above assumptions, related symbols and definitions are further described
as follows:
R: the amount of accounts receivable;
k: the bank pledge rate;
rp: the return rate after successful financing of SMEs;
Cp: the default costs of SMEs;
C′p: the default cost of SMEs driven by blockchain technology;
C: the production costs of SMEs;
Cb: the credit investigation cost of financial institutions;
r′b: the deposit rate of financial institutions;
rb: the loan interest rate of financial institutions;
x: the probability when financial institutions choose to accept the factoring application;
y: the probability of SMEs choosing to keep the contract;
α: the probability that SMEs choose to collude when they do not comply;
P: the ratio of profit distribution to SMEs in collusion;
M: the blockchain platform maintenance fee.
3. The Model
3.1. Before Applying Blockchain Technology
3.1.1. Construction of the Game Matrix
In this game, the financial institution has two actions: accept or not accept the business
application. The SME will or will not comply with the contract. In addition, the SME
may or may not collude with the core enterprise when the SME does not comply with the
contract. Therefore, there are 6 possible results in this game.
Result 1: When the financial institution accepts the factoring application, the financial
institution will pay the credit investigation cost Cb and the deposit interest kRr′b within the
corresponding period. If the SME delivers the goods according to the contract (abide by
the contract), the factoring business is carried out normally, and the financial institution
recovers the accounts receivable according to the factoring business at maturity, resulting
in income (1− k)R. Therefore, the net income of the financial institution is (1− k)R− Cb −
kRr′b in this case. On the other hand, the SME obtains loans kR for production. The income
generated is kR(1 + rp) and the production cost is C. Therefore, the net income of the SME
is kR(1 + rp)− C in this case.
Result 2: When the financial institution accepts the factoring application, but the goods
delivered by the SME fail to be produced according to the contract standards, so that the
core enterprise cannot carry out normal processing. The core enterprise will only deliver
the amount lower than the book value to the financial institution, and the insufficient part
needs to be paid by the SME which will be included in the default cost Cp. Therefore, in
this case, the net income of financial institutions is not affected, but the net income of the
SME will decrease. Their net income is (1− k)R − Cb − kRr′b and kR(1 + rp) − C − Cp,
respectively.
Result 3: When the financial institution accepts factoring applications, and the SME
and the core enterprise jointly defraud loans, the transaction contract is false and the
transaction background does not exist. At maturity, the loan becomes bad debt and the
financial institution cannot recover it. In this case, the financial institution will lose the debt
of kR paid when accepting the business application and the deposit interest kRr′b within
the corresponding period. Due to false transactions, the SME does not need to submit
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2830
commodities to core enterprises, so they have no corresponding production cost C, and
will obtain the part of production income kRP(1 + rp) generated by the loan. Therefore,
the income of the financial institution and the SME are −kR(1 + r′b)− Cb and kRP(1 + rp),
respectively.
Result 4: When the financial institution decides to decline the factoring application
after the credit investigation, but the SME delivers the goods according to the contract
(abide by the contract), and the core enterprise pays the payment by the due date. The
income generated by the loan kR that the financial institution should have paid is kR(rb −
r′b), but the credit investigation cost Cb needs to be paid, so the net income of the financial
institution is kR(rb − r′b)−Cb. The SME recovers the loan R at maturity, so their net income
is R− C.
Result 5: When the financial institution decides to decline the factoring business
application after the credit investigation, the SME unilaterally breaches the contract. At this
time, the goods cannot be produced according to the contract standard. The core enterprise
will repay the loan in an amount lower than the nominal value, and the rest will be borne
by the SME, which will be included in the default cost Cp. Therefore, the income of the
financial institution and the SME is kR(rb − r′b) and R− C− Cp, respectively.
Result 6: When the financial institution decides to decline the application for factoring
business after credit investigation, and there is no joint loan fraud between the SME and the
core enterprise, the earnings of the financial institution and the SME are kR(rb − r′b)− Cb
and zero, respectively.
To sum up, the return matrix of the financial institution and the SME under different
situations before applying the blockchain technology is concluded in Table 1.
Table 1. The return matrix before introducing blockchain technology.

Collusion(α) Non Collusion (1− α) (y)

N Decline kR(rb − r′b)− Cb kR(rb − r′b)− Cb kR(rb − r′b)− Cb
K (1− x) 0 R− C− Cp R− C
3.1.2. Replication Dynamic Equation of the Financial Institution
Let E(x) be the financial institution’s expected return when accepting the factoring
business application and E(1−x) be its expected return when not accepting. And Ēx be its
average return. Then,
E(x) = y[(1− k)R− Cb − kRr′b]
+ (1− y){α[−kR(1 + r′b)− Cb] + (1− α)[(1− k)R− Cb − kRr′b]}
(1)
E(1−x) = y(kR(rb − r′b)− Cb)
+ (1− y){α[kR(rb − r′b)− Cb] + (1− α)[kR(rb − r′b)− Cb]}
(2)
Ēx = xE(x) + (1− x)E(1−x) (3)
Replication dynamics equation is
F(x) =
dx
dt
= x(E(x) − Ēx)
= x(1− x)(yα + 1− k− krb − α)R
(4)
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2831
Solve F(x) = 0, we can get the stationary point of the differential equation as follows:
x∗1 = 0, x∗2 = 1 (5)
y∗ =
k + krb + α− 1
α
(6)
Equation (6) indicates that
∂F(x)
∂x
= 0 always holds when the probability of the SME
choosing to abide by the contract is y∗. That is, the state will not change due to external
changes. In this case, no matter what value x takes, it is always the solution of the equation
F(x) = 0, and all x are equilibrium points. That is, all states are stationary.
According to the stability of the differential equation, if y 6= y∗, the evolutionary
stability strategy needs to satisfy F(x∗) = 0 and F′(x∗) < 0 at the same time.
When y > y∗, F′(1) < 0, so x = x∗2 = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy. That is,
when the probability of the SME choosing to keep the contract is greater than y∗, the system
will eventually evolve into the equilibrium state of the financial institution accepting
factoring business application.
When y < y∗, F′(0) < 0, so x = x∗1 = 0 is an evolutionary stable strategy. That is,
when the probability of the SME choosing to keep the contract is less than y∗, the system
will eventually evolve into the equilibrium state of the financial institution declining
factoring business application.
The core of replication dynamics is that the number of individuals who adopt more
successful strategies in the group will gradually increase. It can be seen from Equation (6)
that the choice of the financial institution has nothing to do with the cost of credit investi-
gation, that is, the key to whether the financial institution accepts factoring applications is
credit risk. Therefore, although blockchain technology improves the income of financial
institutions by reducing operational risk, the key to the decision of financial institutions
lies in the impact of blockchain on credit risk.
It can be further found from Equation (6) that the pledge rate k of the financial
institution is positively correlated with the probability y that the SME chooses to abide by
the contract. This is because the pledge rate of the financial institution mainly depends
on the credit degree and business terms of the SME. On the one hand, the SME with high
credit has low risks, the financial institution is more willing to accept factoring applications,
and the pledge rate is increased. On the other hand, considering long-term cooperation,
the SME will also choose to standardize their behavior in order to maintain their high
credibility in financial institutions. In addition, the collision probability α is negatively
correlated with y. When α increases, the probability of the SME choosing collusion to
defraud loans increases, but the possibility of the SME choosing to abide by the contract
decreases. This also shows that collusion plays a decisive role in credit risk, and the
occurrence of a breach of contract is mainly caused by collusion.
3.1.3. Replication Dynamic Equation of the SME
The expected return of the SME is assumed to be E(y) when they are fully compliant,
and E(1−y) when they are not. The average return is denoted as Ēy.
E(y) = x[kR(1 + rp)− C] + (1− x)(R− C) (7)
E(1−y) = x{α[kRP(1 + rp)] + (1− α)[kR(1 + rp)− C− Cp]}
+ (1− x)[(1− α)(R− C− Cp)]
(8)
Ēy = yE(y) + (1− y)E(1−y) (9)
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2832
The replicator dynamics equation is
F(y) =
dy
dt
= y(E(y) − Ēy)
= y(1− y)
{
x[αR[k(1 + rp)− 1]− αkRP(1 + rp)] (10)
+ Cp + αR− αC− αCp
}
Let F(y) = 0, then
y∗1 = 0, y∗2 = 1 (11)
x∗ =
αR− αC + (1− α)Cp
αR[kP(1 + rp)− k(1 + rp) + 1]
(12)
Therefore, Equation (11) and Equation (12) is the stationary point of the differential
equation. Since x > 0, then P > 1− 1
k(1 + rp)
.
Equation (12) indicates that
∂F(y)
∂y
= 0 always exists when the probability of the
financial institution accepting the application is x∗. That is, the state will not change due
to external changes. In this case, no matter what y takes, it is always the solution of the
equation F(y) = 0, and all y are equilibrium points. That is, all states are stationary.
According to the stability of the differential equation, if x 6= x∗, the ESS needs to
satisfy F(y∗) = 0 and F′(y∗) < 0.
When x < x∗, F′(1) < 0, so y∗ = 1 is an evolutionary stable strategy, that is, when the
probability of the financial institution accepting the factoring application is less than x∗,
the system will eventually evolve into the SME choosing to abide by the contract.
When x > x∗, F′(0) < 0, so y∗ = 0 is an evolutionary stable strategy, that is when the
probability of the financial institution accepting business application is greater than x∗, the
system will eventually evolve into the SME defaulting.
In addition, when P > 1− 1
k(1 + rp)
, it can be seen from Equation (12) that when
α is smaller, x is larger. Therefore, if the financial institution is risk-averse, the financial
institution is less likely to accept the factoring business application of the SME. However,
if the financial institution is still willing to accept the business application, the SME will
tend to seize the opportunity. The SME will consider comprehensively the long-term
benefits generated by subsequent cooperation and choose to abide by the contract. When
the financial institution is more likely to accept the factoring application of the SME, the
SME will decide to default under the temptation of the high-profit distribution obtained
by collusion.
It can be further found from Equation (12) that both Cp and rp are positively correlated
with x. The increase of rp means that the profits of the SME after obtaining loans are greater.
At this time, in order to improve the loan willingness of the financial institution, the SME
is more likely to provide real transactions. If rp decreases, the profits of the SME after
obtaining loans will also decrease. When profits are getting smaller and smaller, the SME
is more and more inclined to conceal or cheat and provide false business transactions. At
this time, in order to ensure the authenticity of accounts receivable provided by the SME,
the financial institution will increase the punishment to enterprises. However, in order
to improve x (that is, to improve the probability that the SME provides real business), rp
needs to be reduced and Cp needs to be increased. Therefore, when the risk loss caused by
concealment or fraud by the SME is greater than the income, the SME will not easily make
concealment or fraud after comprehensively considering its actual operation status and
repayment ability. At this time, if the SME is aware of its poor operating conditions, it will
not choose to obtain loans through the way of accounts receivable factoring with recourse,
which also reduces the credit risk of the financial institution.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2833
On the one hand, through the replication dynamic differential equation of financial
institutions, it can be concluded that the probability of the SME choosing to abide by the
contract is small, and the risk-aversion financial institution tends not to accept business
applications. On the other hand, through the replication dynamic equation of the SME,
it can be concluded that the smaller the probability of the financial institution accepting
business applications, the greater the probability of the SME choosing to abide by the
contract. Therefore, this means that the smaller the probability of the SME choosing to
abide by the contract, the larger financial institutions will accept business applications.
This is a paradox that is contrary to the decision-making of the financial institution. This
is because it is difficult for the financial institution to supervise due to the problem of
information asymmetry. When the compliance probability of the SME increases, the credit
of the SME increases, and the financial institution is more and more inclined to accept
business applications. However, when the proportion of income that can be distributed
by the SME in collusion increases, the SME can obtain higher profits through collusion.
Therefore, it will take risks to choose default, the probability of compliance gradually
decreases, and the possibility of the financial institution accepting the business application
decreases again. This has formed a strange circle of “the financial institution does not accept
business applications→ the probability of compliance of the SME increases→ the credit
of the SME in the financial institution increases→ the financial institution tends to accept
the business application→ the proportion of benefits distributed by the SME collusion
increases→ the probability of default of the SME increases→ the financial institution does
not accept the business application”. This circle makes the system unable to stabilize.
3.1.4. Analysis of Equilibrium State and Stability Strategy of Evolutionary Game
Based on the above analysis, the evolutionary game system has five equilibrium
points: E1(x∗1 , y∗1), E2(x∗1 , y∗2), E3(x∗2 , y∗1), E4(x∗2 , y∗2), E5(x∗, y∗).
Taking the derivatives of Equation (4) and (10) respectively, we can get the following
Jacobian matrix.

∂y
= (1− 2y)[x(k(1 + rp)− 1)αR− xαkRP(1 + rp) + Cp + α(R− C− Cp)] (17)
Next, we calculate determinant value detJ and trace value matrix trJ of equilibrium
points E1, · · · , E5, and to judge the stability of the equilibrium point of the evolutionary
game. The results are shown in Table 2.

It can be seen from Table 2 that the system may not reach stable equilibrium through
long-term evolution. Whether it can achieve the ESS combination that the financial in-
stitution accepts the factoring application and the SME abides by contracts depends on
factors such as interest distribution ratio P, joint loan fraud probability α, return on normal
production rp, and default cost Cp.
3.2. After Applying Blockchain Technology
After introducing blockchain technology in SCF, the main changes include: first, the
blockchain platform maintenance cost M replaces the credit investigation cost Cb of the
financial institution. Second, the blockchain increases the default cost of the SME, denoted
it as C′p.
The return matrix of the financial institution and the SME under different situations
after applying blockchain technology is concluded in Table 3.

Similar to the above analysis process, after the introduction of blockchain technol-
ogy, the game system has five equilibrium points: E1(x∗1B, y∗1B), E2(x∗1B, y∗2B), E3(x∗2B, y∗1B),

3.3. Comparative Analysis
By comparing the system equilibrium states before and after the introduction of
blockchain technology (Tables 2 and 4), the following results can be found.
(1) The introduction of blockchain technology has cracked the paradox in SCF.
Before applying blockchain technology, when the profit distribution ratio P generated
by the collision of the SME is low, the possibility of the SME choosing collusion is low.
Therefore, the default probability of the SME decreases. At this time, the financial institution
is more likely to accept the factoring application. However, the financial institution lacks
positive means to prevent the occurrence of joint loan fraud. In this case, the risk aversion
mechanism may fail. It means that when P > Pu, the strategy that the financial institution
accepting mortgage applications and the SME abiding by the contract is no longer stable.
Moreover, the larger the profit distribution ratio P obtained by the SME, the stronger its
willingness to collude and the greater the possibility of default.
Due to the existence of information asymmetry, the penalty cost formulated by finan-
cial institutions tends to be below, and it is easy to treat the high-risk business as a low-risk
one. Default cost Cp indirectly reflects the regulatory environment of financial institutions.
Blockchain technology increases Cp to improve supervision by resolving the problem of
information asymmetry. In this situation, the conspiracy will be in a high-risk state. No
matter what the proportion of collusion distribution of the SME is, it will always be within
the range of [Pl , Pu].
Therefore, blockchain technology creates a strict regulatory environment by increasing
default costs, thus controlling the proportion of collusive distribution of the SME and
preventing the paradox of SCF. The beneficent cycle is: “the financial institution does
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2836
not accept business applications→ the compliance probability increases→ the financial
institution accepts the application→ the distribution proportion of benefits obtained by the
SME collusion increases→ the compliance probability increases→ the financial institution
accepts business applications”. The mechanism of blockchain technology to resolve credit
risk is shown in Figure 3.

Note: The cycle from 1 to 6 is the paradox before applying blockchain technology to SCF. The circle from 2 to 4 is
the core beneficent cycle after applying blockchain technology to SCF.
Figure 3. The mechanism of blockchain technology to resolve credit risk.
(2) The default cost Cp of the SME plays a key role in the formation of stable strategy.
From Table 2, Pu can be rewritten as
Pu = 1−
αC− (1− α)Cp
αkR(1 + rp)
(23)
Hence, when Cp increases until Cp >
α
1− α
C is established, the condition P < Pu is
easier to exist. However, in reality, the default probability α of the SME is usually high,
so it is difficult for Cp to reach
α
1− α
C before the application of blockchain technology.
This makes P < Pu difficult to exist. In addition, when the rate of return rp obtained by
the production of the SME increases, P < Pu is easier to exist. The larger rp is, the greater
the profit of the SME. In order to improve the willingness of the financial institution to
accept factoring applications, the SME is more likely to choose to abide by the contract.
The greater the default cost Cp of the SME, the lower its default probability. At this time,
the financial institution is more willing to accept factoring applications. If rp is reduced,
the profits obtained by the SME after obtaining loans will also be reduced, and the SME
tends to cheat and increase the possibility of providing untrue business applications. In
this case, in order to ensure the authenticity of accounts receivable provided by the SME,
the financial institution will increase the punishment to the SME, and the possibility of
default of the SME will be reduced. To sum up, default cost Cp plays a key role in the
formation of stability strategy.
At present, existing studies have only concluded that blockchain technology reduces
the probability of SMEs choosing to default and improves the financing efficiency of
SMEs [10,12,14,19]. However, it did not analyze the reasons for the reduction in the proba-
bility of default, and the mechanism of blockchain technology. Compared with the existing
research, this paper not only explains the mechanism of blockchain technology to resolve
credit risk but also finds the reason why the system cannot reach equilibrium before apply-
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2837
ing blockchain technology. And found the critical value of the collusion distribution ratio
in the case of default.
4. A Numerical Example
In this section, based on the case in [32], we discuss the impact of the introduction of
blockchain technology in (ASC) finance to verify the relevant conclusions of this paper.
4.1. Background
The ASC is characterized by regionality, seasonality, the scattered connection of market
subjects, uncertain output, many hierarchical nodes, and asymmetric information [33,34],
which leads to the lengthening of the accounts receivable cycle of agricultural products
farmers and the obvious tendency of subject immobilization.
In ASC, SMEs are mainly farmers who are responsible for the production and supply
of agricultural products. After the harvest of agricultural products, they are regularly
purchased and sold by the core enterprise. Since the production of agricultural goods have a
long cycle, the core enterprise usually provides a guarantee for farmers to obtain loans from
financial institutions (commercial banks) to encourage farmers’ sustainable reproduction.
Based on the data of a real transaction, it is assumed that the book value of accounts
receivable R is 1 million yuan. With the book value of accounts receivable as a pledge,
farmers apply to commercial banks for factoring business. The deposit interest rate r′b of
commercial banks is 2%, the loan interest rate rb is 4%, the credit rate k is 80%, and the credit
investigation cost Cb is 0.01 million yuan. After the introduction of blockchain technology,
commercial banks need to pay platform construction and cost M of 100 yuan. In addition,
the yield rate rp of farmers in normal production is 30%, and the corresponding production
cost C is 0.6 million yuan. If the farmers unilaterally breach the contract, the core enterprise
will repay part of the debt in an amount lower than the nominal value. The remaining part
will be paid by the farmers. Moreover, farmers’ breach of contract will result in the loss of
opportunities for re-cooperation with core enterprises or other enterprises. At this time,
the total price Cp paid by farmers is 0.7 million yuan.
4.2. Stability Analysis of Accounts Receivable Financing Mode before Introducing
Blockchain Technology
Before the introduction of blockchain technology, it is assumed that the possibility of
joint loan fraud between farmers and core enterprises is 90%. In this way, according to the
calculation results of Pl and Pu, we take P as 30% for evolution simulation. The results are
shown in Figure 4.
It can be seen from Figure 4 that at the beginning of the evolution period, commercial
banks tend to decline farmers’ pledge applications to avoid risks due to farmers’ breach
of contract. At this stage, the probability of commercial banks accepting pledge business
converges to 0. With the advancement of system evolution and the gradual standardization
of farmers’ behavior, commercial banks choose to accept farmers’ pledge applications to
obtain higher income. At this stage, the probability of commercial banks accepting pledge
applications converges to 1, and the probability of farmers’ compliance converges to 1 as
well. The system realizes evolutionary stability.

Figure 5. System evolution track before introducing blockchain Technology (P = 53%).
It can be found from Figure 5 that due to the high proportion of benefit distribu-
tion obtained by collusion between farmers and core enterprises, farmers have a strong
willingness to choose collusion. Therefore, commercial banks are less willing to accept
farmers’ pledge applications at the earlier period. In this case, farmers began to restrict
their behavior to improve their credit to obtain loans from commercial banks. Commer-
cial banks are more willing to accept business applications, but it also correspondingly
improves the income that farmers can obtain by choosing collusion. After weighing the
cost of default and the profit of loan fraud, more and more farmers will choose to default
again. Therefore, the system is difficult to achieve stability in this case. In the reality that
joint loan fraud can not be controlled easily, the cost of default Cp must be large enough to
realize a stable state in which farmers choose not to default and commercial banks choose
to accept pledge applications.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2839
4.3. Stability Analysis of Accounts Receivable Financing Mode after Introducing
Blockchain Technology
The highly transparent information under the blockchain technology and the non-
tamperability based on timestamp technology make the punishment of farmers’ breach
of contract infinite. No matter what the benefit distribution ratio P generated by farmers’
collusion is, farmers will not choose to breach the contract, and commercial banks are more
willing to accept the application for factoring business. The default cost of farmers here
is assumed to be 10 million yuan. After the introduction of blockchain technology, the
dynamic evolution track of the cooperation strategy combination between farmers and
commercial banks in accounts receivable factoring business is shown in Figure 6 (P = 30%)
and Figure 7 (P = 53%).

It can be seen from Figures 6 and 7 that after the introduction of blockchain technology,
no matter what the profit distribution ratio of collusion P is, the strategic choices of farmers
and commercial banks converge to 1, that is, farmers choose to abide by the contract, and
commercial banks tend to accept business applications. The strategy (1,1) becomes the
system evolution stability strategy.
J. Theor. Appl. Electron. Commer. Res. 2021, 16 2840
In addition, by comparing the system evolution trajectory before and after applying
blockchain technology, it can be seen that the evolution path of all parties is more consistent
after the introduction of blockchain technology. On the premise that blockchain technology
is the guarantee, farmers standardize their behavior. Regardless of the external interest
drive and the initial state of the strategy proportion adopted by all parties in the game,
commercial banks and farmers will eventually converge to the strategy combination (accept,
abide). It can be seen from Figure 4 that the convergence effect of the system is better than
that of the evolution path in Figure 6. Therefore, the increase of punishment shortens the
path of commercial banks not accepting applications in the early stage. And the greater the
default cost Cp, the more the evolution path in Case II after the introduction of blockchain
will tend to Case I.
5. Conclusions
This paper makes a game analysis on the dynamic evolution process of accounts
receivable factoring business in SCF. By introducing blockchain technology, we find the
following main conclusions.
(1) Credit risk and operational risk are the main sources of risk in SCF. The key
to whether financial institutions accept factoring applications is credit risk. Blockchain
technology only improves the income of financial institutions by reducing operational risk,
and the key to the decision-making of financial institutions lies in the impact of blockchain
on credit risk. The principal-agent risk plays a decisive role in credit risk, and the breach of
contract is mainly caused by collusion.
(2) The pledge rate of financial institutions mainly depends on the credit level and
loan terms of SMEs. On the one hand, SMEs with high credit have low risks, financial
institution’s willingness to lend has increased, and the pledge rate has increased. On the
other hand, in the case of a certain proportion of collusion distribution, SMEs will choose
to standardize their behavior to maintain their high credibility in financial institutions.
When the profits obtained by SMEs after obtaining loans are reduced, they will tend to
hide or cheat and provide untrue business transactions. At this time, in order to ensure the
authenticity of business, financial institutions will increase the punishment to improve the
default cost of SMEs. In this way, the risk of loss caused by concealment or fraud will be
greater than the benefits. Therefore, SMEs will not easily make concealment or fraud after
comprehensively considering their actual operation status and repayment ability.
(3) Blockchain technology creates a stricter regulatory environment by resolving the
problem of information asymmetry. At this time, no matter how high the credit degree
of SMEs is, and what proportion of profit distribution can be shared by collusion, the
highly transparent business supervision environment built by blockchain technology has
effectively solved the problem that the decision-making between SMEs and financial
institutions can not reach a stable state. Thus, the credit risk in SCF with blockchain
technology is reduced, the system tends to be stable through long-term evolution, and the
decision-making time of subject evolution is shortened greatly. Financial institutions are
more willing to accept business applications, which solves the financing problems of SMEs.
