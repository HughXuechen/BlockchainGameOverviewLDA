Abstract. Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a peer-to-peer electronic payment
system in the paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” [12] in
2009. The payment system introduced in this paper (now known as blockchain
technology) had a big impact on digital data transfer in a point that using
blockchain technology, digital data transfer can be done without having third
parties to give trust to the transfer process. In this paper, we focus on one of the
key components of the blockchain technology, “consensus algorithm”. We
propose a consensus algorithm “Proof-of-Achievement (PoA)” which is an
algorithm optimized for blockchain games, focusing on the number of tasks
achieved in the game. Using the PoA algorithm, we aim to increase the moti-
vation for playing blockchain games. Through a user study, this paper discusses
the effects of the PoA algorithm.

1 Introduction
Blockchain Technology was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the paper “Bitcoin: A
Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” [12] in 2009. Using the blockchain technology,
peer-to-peer data transfers can be done without the trust of third parties.
Recently, many applications are being developed using the blockchain technology
including “blockchain games”, which are games which uses blockchain to “prove the
provenance of specific virtual items” [3]. For example, Spells of Genesis [6] is a
blockchain game which treats some of the cards used in the game as a token on
blockchain, which makes the cards collectible and tradable outside the game, having
the ownership of the card proved by blockchain.
In this paper, we focus on one of the key components of the blockchain technology,
“consensus algorithm”. Consensus algorithms are algorithms which determines who
will generate the block and get the reward. Each blockchain uses a certain consensus
algorithm. For example, Proof-of-Work (PoW) for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Proof-of-
Importance (PoI) for NEM [9] and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake for Lisk. Based on the
consensus algorithm, transactions on the blockchain are gathered and verified to form a
“block”. These blocks form a chain and since “To modify a past block, an attacker
would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch

up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes” as explained in [12], the transactions
will be non-reversible.
However, most of the blockchain games which rank high in trade volume [2] work
on Ethereum blockchain which allows the blockchain game developers to easily deploy
smart contracts, which are proved to be secure and non-reversible by the blockchain.
However, Ethereum being a “decentralized platform that runs smart contracts” [5], it is
not optimized for developing blockchain games. Therefore, we propose the Proof-of-
Achievement algorithm, which is optimized for blockchain games which (A) Motivates
the player to play the blockchain game by giving incentives from the blockchain.
(B) Has a design based on gamification which motivates the user. (C) Realize high-
speed transaction and high scalability.
In this study, we have conducted a user study to investigate the effects of the PoA
algorithm. Through the results of the user study, we discuss if the PoA algorithm could
increase the motivation for playing the blockchain game.
Our final goal is to develop a game platform based on the proposed blockchain
system and be able to trade cards or game items from different games on the same
blockchain.
This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we show some related works. This
includes some examples of consensus algorithms that are related to this paper, an
example of a blockchain game and the explanation of DApps. In Sect. 3, we will
explain our approach. This includes how the Proof-of-Achievement (PoA) works and
how PoA will motivate the blockchain users. Section 4 includes he explanation of our
prototype system. We explain the how the prototype system is implemented and the
what kind of game the participants will use. Section 5 includes the explanation of the
user study and the results. Finally, in Sect. 6 we will conclude the study.
2 Related Work
2.1 Consensus Algorithm
Proof-of-Work
Bitcoin is the first and the most notable cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a “medium of
exchange, created and stored electronically in the blockchain, using encryption tech-
niques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds” [15].
The consensus algorithm used in Bitcoin is Proof-of-Work (PoW). Also, Ethereum
blockchain, which has the third largest market cap in all the cryptocurrencies (as of
January 16, 2019) [4] and many other blockchains such as Litecoin, Monero or Dash
use PoW algorithm. PoW ensures the transactions to be non-reversible by expending
CPU efforts. The blocks can only be redone by expending the same amount of machine
power and generate blocks to catch up with and surpass the longest chain [12].
Therefore, as long as the attacker does not monopolize more than 51% of the total
machine power, the blockchain cannot be attacked and the blocks and the transactions
cannot be reversed.
126 K. Komiya and T. Nakajima
However today, most of the miners (untrusted nodes that provides machine power
to the blockchain), form “mining pools” which are “large pools built out of inde-
pendent entities that place their hashing power under the control of a pool manager
that coordinates their efforts, collects rewards, and redistributes those rewards to the
participants in proportion to their effort” [7]. Because of this mining concentration
problem, in 2014, GHash mining pool actually exceeded 51% of the total mining
power. Also, on January 06, 2019, Ethereum classic was targeted by a 51% attack and
some transactions were reversed [14].
This concentration problem is making the PoW blockchains “not non-reversible”
and has become a serious problem.
Another problem is the concentration of wealth. Since PoW rewards more to the
people who have more machine power, rich people with more machine power become
richer and ends up in the concentration of wealth. In fact, the top 1% of the Bitcoin
holders own 80% of all Bitcoins (starting from 2014) [16].
Proof-of-Importance
Proof-of-Importance (PoI) is a consensus algorithm used in NEM blockchain. This
consensus algorithm is similar to Proof-of-Stake algorithm, which is a consensus
algorithm where the determination of who adds the next block is weighted by how
many tokens (called “stakes”) you have [10]. In addition to the stakes, PoI is also
weighted by the amount “how much they transact to others and who they transact
with” [16]. From to these amounts, the score called the “Importance” is calculated, and
higher your importance is, higher the chance of getting rewarded from the blockchain
will be. Mining in PoI is called “Harvesting” and does not require a large amount of
machine power. Therefore, the reward from the blockchain is distributed also to regular
people who do not have expensive mining machines, which leads to even wealth
distribution and solves the concentration of wealth which occurs with PoW
blockchains.
Figure 1 explains how harvesting works. Instead of having every user generate the
block, each user delegates harvesting to special nodes called Super Nodes (SN) with
certain requirements [9]. Each SN generates blocks depending on the importance of the
users who delegated their harvesting to the SN. Finally, the SN distributes the reward
from the blockchain to the users depending on each user’s importance.
2.2 Spell of Genesis
Spell of Genesis is “the first blockchain-based mobile game ever made” [6]. The game
was first launched in 2017 as a combination of trading card game and point and shot
arcade game. Some cards used in the game are treated as tokens on the blockchain and
called the “blockchain cards”. The screenshot of the game and the blockchain card is
shown in Fig. 2.
Cryptocurrency called BitCrystal was also distributed through an ICO (Initial Coin
Offering). Both the blockchain cards and the Bitcrystals are treated as tokens on a
Bitcoin blockchain through Counterparty, a platform that provides the ability to create
your own tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2.3 DApps
DApps (Decentralized Applications) are applications that most or entire part are
decentralized. The examples of possible aspects of an application that can be decen-
tralized are backend software (application logic), frontend software, data storage,
message communication and name resolutions [1]. Today, most of the blockchain
games which rank high in trade volume [2] are DApps and work on Ethereum
blockchain which allows the blockchain game developers to easily deploy smart
contracts, which are proved to be secure and non-reversible by the blockchain.
In [1], the authors explain the advantages of being decentralized as follows.
1. Resiliency
When the application logic of the application is controlled by a smart contract,
unlike applications that run on a centralized server, DApps will be available as long as
the platform (the blockchain the application is running on) is running.

Fig. 2. Screenshot of gameplay (Left) and the blockchain card (Right) [3]
128 K. Komiya and T. Nakajima
2. Transparency
The code of DApps is allowed to inspect by everyone so no unfair actions can be
done by the game developers.
3. Censorship resistance
Since the smart contracts will be stored on the blockchain, no one, even the
developers can change or undo the smart contracts.
However, as mentioned in the Introduction section, Ethereum blockchain currently
uses PoW as consensus algorithm. Therefore, the final goal of this study is to develop a
blockchain game platform, which works similar to Ethereum blockchain and uses
consensus algorithm optimized for blockchain games.
3 Our Approach
3.1 An Overview of Our Approach
In this paper, we propose a new consensus algorithm optimized for blockchain games.
The aim of the consensus algorithm is to realize a blockchain which avoids problems
such as the concentration problems which can be seen in PoW and uses the reward
from the blockchain to motivate the blockchain game players.
3.2 Proof-of-Achievement
We propose a consensus algorithm named Proof-of-Achievement (PoA). The basic
concept of PoA is “The player who achieves more tasks in the game earns more
reward”. Instead of using machine power as in PoW or PoS, PoA blockchains run by
the achievements of the blockchain game users. The design of PoA gets the idea of PoI
algorithm. However, while PoI determines the reward using “importance score”, PoA
uses “achievement score” to determine the reward. As well as PoI, since PoA does not
use machine power as in PoW, concentration problem can be avoided.
3.3 Monetary Incentive
In most of the blockchains, a reward is given to the nodes when a block is generated, as
a monetary incentive to support the blockchain network [12]. As well as these
blockchains, PoA blockchains will also give blockchain game players rewards when a
block is generated calculated by the number of tasks done in the game, which will work
as a monetary incentive.
Providing monetary incentive is one of the suggested methods to give extrinsic
motivation to users. However, it is indicated that the effects of monetary incentives
widely vary [11]. Therefore, we will evaluate the effects of our method through a user
study.
Increasing Motivation for Playing Blockchain Games 129
3.4 Gamification
In [13], gamification is described as “the use of video game elements in non-gaming
system to improve user experience (UX) and user engagement”. This approach is useful
to give intrinsic motivation to users when it is used properly. The game elements used
for gamification are often achievements (badges), levels, or leaderboards.
In our approach, we add a leaderboard to the mining process to increase the
motivation of mining, which leads to an increase in the motivation of playing the game.
The achievement score of each user will be shown on the leader board. This is possible
because basically, all the data on the blockchain including achievement score is
transparent and visible to everyone (except for some untraceable blockchains like
Monero).
3.5 Tokens in PoA Blockchain
Achievement Tokens
Achievement tokens are used to calculate the achievement score of each node. The
achievement score of a node will be the ratio of the number of node’s achievement
tokens to the total number of achievement tokens distributed. Achievement tokens will
be distributed to the blockchain game players each time a task is achieved by the
player. By handling the achievement tokens on the blockchain, transparency of the
movements of achievement tokens will be provided by the blockchain. This will
prevent unfair actions by certain games (e.g. giving a large amount of achievement
tokens to a certain user to make him/her have partially high achievement score).
Currency Tokens
Currency tokens are cryptocurrency which will be traded on cryptocurrency markets.
The tokens will have some benefits related to the game (e.g. get discount on game items
when paid by the currency tokens) so that the tokens will be in demand and be at a
certain price.
Game Tokens
Game tokens are tokens of game characters, items, or cards used in the game as
explained in the Introduction section. As well as other tokens, game tokens can be sent
and received outside the game.
Trades of game characters or game items can also be implemented on games that run
by the server-client model. However, the trades will have to be done under a certain
rule made by the developers of the game. For example, certain trade fee will be charged
or trade between different games will be unavailable (or very limited). Having the game
tokens on blockchain will provide the player’s control of their trades.
3.6 The Network of the Blockchain with PoA
The network of the PoA blockchain basically functions the same way as the PoI
blockchains as explained in Fig. 1. Each player in the network delegates the mining
process to special nodes, and the special nodes generate the blocks. Finally, the special
nodes distribute the rewards to each node depending on their achievement scores.

4 Prototype System
4.1 Implementation
The game for the experiment was implemented with Android Java and Ruby on Rails.
To make the implementation simpler, our system is implemented using the server/client
model instead of the actual blockchain system. However, there is no difference in UI.
Therefore, using the server/client does not affect the evaluation result.
4.2 Basic System
The game for the experiment is a trading card game originally created for the exper-
iment. To start a battle, the players select the opponent from the menu (Fig. 3). There
are two types of battle, player battle and CPU battle. The difference between the two
types is that for player battle, the player battles against the card deck other players have
created. On the other hand, for CPU battle, the player battles against a deck the
developer has created beforehand (5 different difficulties).
However, every battle in the game is played against computer AI. The player and
the opponent played cards in turn until the hit point of either of the player reaches 0.
The screenshot is shown in Fig. 4.
4.3 Gacha System
Gacha is a well-used way of getting characters or cards in Japanese smartphone games.
To get characters or cards from the gacha, players use in-game points. A Japanese
smartphone game often have 2 types of gachas in the game. One type of gacha uses
points you can get free in the game, and the other uses points you buy with actual
money (or sometimes given free in the game).
In our system, two types of gachas are implemented as well as many of the
Japanese smartphone games. One is “normal gacha”, a gacha you use points you can
get free in the game (we called the points “gacha points”). The other is “rare gacha”, a
gacha you use points you buy with actual money (and given in the game for doing
difficult tasks. The points were called the “stones”). The cards that can be obtained

Increasing Motivation for Playing Blockchain Games 131
from the “rare gacha” is often more powerful than the cards that can be obtained from
the “normal gacha”. However, in the experiment, the participants could not actually
buy stones. Instead, the rewards from the blockchain were automatically converted to
stones and could be used as in-game currency. The actual gacha in the game is shown
in Fig. 5. The amount of points or stones needed to get cards once (5 cards) was 100
points for normal gacha and 50 stones for rare gacha.

4.4 Tasks
There are 2 types of tasks in the game. The tasks are as follows.
Daily tasks: Daily tasks are tasks that can be done each day. Once you do the task,
you will not be able to do the same task again until next morning (5 a.m.).
The daily tasks are as follows,
1. Play player battle 3 times.
2. Play player battle 5 times.
3. Play player battle 7 times.
4. Play player battle 10 times.
5. Play CPU battle 3 times.
6. Play CPU battle 7 times.
7. Play CPU battle 10 times.
The reward for each task is 100 gacha points for task 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 50 stones
for task 4 and 8. In addition, for each task, the player gets 1 achievement point.
One-time Tasks: One-time tasks are tasks that can be done only once throughout
the experiment. The one-time tasks are as follows.
1. Defeat CPU of difficulty “very easy”
2. Defeat CPU of difficulty “easy”
3. Defeat CPU of difficulty “medium”
4. Defeat CPU of difficulty “hard”
5. Defeat CPU of difficulty “very hard”
By completing each task, the player get 100 stones and 10 achievement points.
4.5 Amount of Reward Paid from the Blockchain
How much reward should be paid to the players in the experiment? This is very difficult
to determine considering the following 2 points.
The price of the cryptocurrency: We need to first determine how much the
blockchain will reward the players. However, because of the high volatility of cryp-
tocurrencies today, it is very difficult to determine how much the price of the currency
tokens should be. For example, the price of NEM was about 0.4 dollars on May 1,
2018, while the price was about 0.07 dollars on December 30, 2018 [4].
The number of players: The number of players must also be determined to deter-
mine how the reward from the blockchain should be distributed. 2 times more the
players exist, half the reward for each player will be. However, it is very difficult to
know how many players actually play the game (not the number of devices installed).
Considering these points, we decided to roughly estimate the amount of rewards
and the number of active players. First, we decided to use the price of Lisk. This is
because the consensus algorithm used in Lisk blockchain called DPoS is similar to PoI
thus similar to PoA as well and has a fixed price of reward (4 Lisk for each block
created). In addition, we supposed the number of players to be 1 million considering
smartphone games in Japan with 5 top highest DAU (Daily Active User) reported by
[8] (Fig. 6).
Increasing Motivation for Playing Blockchain Games 133
From these numbers, we calculated the amount of reward as below. (n:4
[Lisk/block], y: 300[yen/Lisk (Sep 2018)], b: 8640[blocks/day], P: 1,000,000[players],
p: 8[number of participants])
n� y� b� P� p � 80½yen�
Therefore, 80 yen were distributed per day to the participants in Group A calculated
by the achievement score of the user and automatically converted to gacha stones. The
conversion between yen and stones was as below.
300 yen ! 50 stones
We did research on a few Japanese smartphone games and found out that the price
of getting a character or cards once from a gacha, costs approximately 300 yen [18–20].
However, as we have mentioned before, we must note that the amount calculated
above is a rough amount and can range very widely. Therefore, in a further study, we
need to do experiments with other amounts of reward.
4.6 Blockchain Menu
Figure 7 shows the blockchain menu and the leaderboard which only the participants in
Group A can see. In the blockchain menu, the participants can see the information of
the recent 5 blocks (achievement score and the actual amount of gacha stones
obtained). The blocks were generated every hour. The leader board shows the
achievement score of the player and other players. The name of other players is not
shown on the leaderboard. Instead, the identifier of the players is shown. This is
1.91 
million
1.76 
million
1.24

0.72

0.45 
million

games in 2018

because, in actual blockchains, the data and the address is public to everyone, but the
actual owner of the address cannot be known. From the leaderboard, the players can
know how much achievement score other players have and the ranking.
4.7 Trade System
Trade system was implemented, and the players could buy and sell cards using stones.
This system was aimed to increase the usage of stones. However, because of the low
usability of the trade system, this system was never used throughout the experiment.
5 User Study
5.1 The Overview of the User Study
Auser studywas conducted using 8 participants (7 male and 1 female, average age: 22.5).
The 8 participants were randomly split into 2 groups (Group A and Group B) with 4
participants each.
We developed a trading card game that can be played on Android smartphones, and
had each participant play the game whenever they wanted to. The experiment was held
for 15 days continuously. The groups differed in the following way,
Group A: The app included the system of PoA. The players earned rewards from
the blockchain based on the PoA algorithm and could see the leaderboard.
Group B: The app did not include the system of PoA. The players earned no
rewards from the blockchain and could not see the leaderboard.
The participants in both groups were not informed that two groups existed.
Therefore, to make the participants in Group B appear on the leaderboards of the
participants in Group A, achievement score for the participants in Group B were
calculated in the same way (without the reward).

Increasing Motivation for Playing Blockchain Games 135
After the experiment, we did an interview to the participants in Group A and asked
questions.
5.2 Results
The basic information of the participants
Table 1 shows the basic information of the participants. This includes the age and the
average time of playing smartphone games per day. A1-4 are participants in group A
and B1-4 are participants in group B.
However, 2 participants (A4 and B4) played the game only once throughout the
experiment. Therefore, the 2 participants are excluded from the results.
Comparison between 2 groups
Figure 8 shows the comparison the of number of plays between group A and group B.
However, the system did not count the number of plays which exceeded 10 times for
each type of battle (player battle and CPU battle) because there are no tasks for playing
more than 10 times. Therefore, the maximum number of plays per day per participant is
20 (10 for player battle and 10 for CPU battle). In addition, the dates are split into 5
sections, 3 days each (1/7-9, 1/10-12, 1/13-15, 1/16-18, 1/19-21). Throughout the
study, the number of plays of group A exceeded group B.
Comparison between the top players from each group
Figure 9 shows the number of plays of the players which played the most in both
groups (participant A3 and B3). From the graph, you can see that participant A3 kept
motivated throughout the study while the motivation of participant B3 declined as the
time passed. You can also see that the participant A3 was motivated by PoA from the
interview which is explained in the later section.
Interview result
We asked th participants in group A the following questions.
1. What did you think about the amount of the reward from the blockchain?
2. Did the reward from the blockchain motivate you to play the game and why?

amount of the reward from the blockchain?”.

Increasing Motivation for Playing Blockchain Games 137
Every participant answered that the amount of the reward from the blockchain was
small. However, the total amount of stones the participants obtained from the block-
chain is shown in Table 3. You can see that none of the participants reach the amount
of stones required for 1 gacha (50 stones).
Table 4 shows the comments to the question, “Did the reward from the blockchain
motivate you to play the game and why?”.
Only participant A3, who obtained the rewards the most, felt himself motivated by
the blockchain. Other participants both mentioned that they were not motivated
because the amount was too small.
Next, Table 5 shows the comments to the question, “Did the leader board motivate
you to play the game and why?”
Participant A3 was motivated by the leaderboard as you can see from the comment
above. However, participant A1 and A2 were not motivated by the leaderboard. They
both mentioned that they could not understand the meaning of achievement score
displayed on the leaderboard (The explanation was written in the manual). Participant
A2 also mentioned that it would have been better if the actual name was displayed.

138 K. Komiya and T. Nakajima
Finally, Table 6 shows the comments to the question “Do you have any comments
about the experiment?”
Every participant answered that it would have been better if there were more trades.
They also commented that the usage of the trading system was not very good. Since no
trades were done by the participants, the usage of the stones was limited to getting
cards from the gacha. Therefore, obtaining stones were less attractive to participants.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
6.1 Conclusion
From the user study, we can see that the PoA algorithm succeeded to motivate one
participant while it failed to motivate 2 others. The reason the 2 participants were not
motivated mainly comes from the amount of the rewards. In addition, the usages of the
rewards of the blockchain was very limited. This made the rewards less attractive to the
participants.
6.2 Future Work
The amount in the user study is roughly calculated as explained in Sect. 4.1, we need a
further study with different amount of rewards. In addition, in the user study, the
rewards from the blockchain were automatically converted to gacha stones. However,
in our proposal, the rewards are meant to be cryptocurrency with many usages (e.g.
exchanging with legal tender, used for trading game items, get special bonus in games).
Therefore, further studies using a system with these functions implemented may have
results.

name was displayed.

myself in the 1st place.
