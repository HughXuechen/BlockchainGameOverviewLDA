Abstract—In proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain networks, the
miners contribute their distributed computation in solving a crypto-
puzzle competition to win the reward. To secure stable profits, some
miners organize mining pools and share the rewards from the pool in
proportion to each miner’s contribution. However, some miners may
exhibit malicious behaviors which cause a waste of distributed compu-
tation resource, even posing a threat on the efficiency of blockchain
networks. In this paper, we propose a new game-theoretic framework to
incentivize miners mining honestly and help to bring about a higher total
welfare of blockchain networks. We first formulate the mining process as
a noncooperative iterated game. We then propose a mechanism in terms
of zero-determinant strategies (ZD strategies) to encourage the coopera-
tive mining and improve the efficiency of mining in PoW-based blockchain
networks. In addition, we theoretically analyze the maximum system wel-
fare of the target pool through the method of optimization. Numerical
illustrations are also presented to support our theoretical results.
Index Terms—Blockchain networks, cooperative mining, game
theory, zero-determinant strategies (ZD strategies).
I. INTRODUCTION
The proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain network is a new
paradigm of distributed computation system where participants con-
tribute their computational resources in exchange for financial
rewards, such as bitcoin. As the most successful application of
blockchain technology, the core security of bitcoin relies on a PoW
consensus algorithm and requires miners solving crypto-puzzles in
the form of a hash computation [1]. During the process of mining,
the difficulty of block generation is adjusted automatically, such that
one block is created every 10 min to the blockchain [2]. Practically, it
is impossible for a single miner using a small computational power to
mine a block for years [3]. Consequently, miners often resort them-
selves into mining pools to secure a stable profit, where all members
mine simultaneously and share their revenue whenever one of them
creates a block.

However, the mining process of blockchain is very resource-
intensive, which results in an intense competition and various dis-
honest mining strategies among miners [4]. A typical example is
the block withholding (BWH) attack, where the infiltrating miners
from other pools only submit partial PoWs (PPoWs) to the target
pool as the computational share. The attacker will not change the
pool’s effective mining power [5]. Yet, the revenue of the attacked
pool is shared with more miners, which gives rise to the fact that
each miner earns less compared to the solo mining mode or the
honest pool participation mode. Consequently, such an attack makes
the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious miners receive
unearned rewards, and even threaten the efficiency of the bitcoin
system greatly. Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective and
fair mechanism to make miners accountable for any dishonest min-
ing behaviors and, thereby, enable efficient distributed computation
of blockchain networks.
To address the challenge, a solution to prevent unfair supervi-
sors and lazy miners from cheating has been investigated [6], where
the technique can be applied to preventing misbehaving miners in
the pool of blockchain networks. In addition, game theory is a
promising theoretic tool for dealing with the problem of distributed
optimization [7], [8], which results in subsequent efforts that have
tried to align game theory to investigate distributed computational
problems [5]. For example, the dynamics of mining pool selection
in a blockchain network has been studied from the view of evo-
lutionary game [9]. Moreover, a game theoretical model has been
employed to show distributed computation in analyzing the security
of pool protocols [10]. However, how to conduct mining effectively
in the blockchain network has not been fully considered where an
optimization problem can be formulated.
Recently, a new class of probabilistic and conditional strategies in
game theory has emerged, which are referred to as zero-determinant
strategies (ZD strategies) [11]. The ZD strategies are employed
in the iterated game to deal with the competition of two-player
games [12], [13] and multiplayer games [14]–[16]. Furthermore,
there are several applications of ZD strategies in competition and
cooperation problems. For example, Zhang et al. applied ZD strate-
gies in wireless communication for the cooperation of resource
sharing in [17] and [18]. Daoud et al. [19] formulated secondary
sharing of the wireless spectrum as an iterated game and applied ZD
strategies to achieve any feasible outcome. Regardless of the strategy
of its opponents, the player with ZD strategies is capable of unilater-
ally setting a ratio between the players and their opponents’ expected
payoff. We thus propose a mechanism in terms of ZD strategies to
prevent misbehaving miners in the pool of blockchain networks, in
which the social welfare of the system is optimized.
In this paper, we develop a theory of multiplayer ZD strategies and
study the problem of cooperative mining in a PoW-based blockchain
network from the viewpoint of game theory. The problem is challeng-
ing due to several reasons. First, each miner is associated with certain
private information which is unknown for other workers. Second,
miners’ decisions are coupled with each other, which results from
one miner’s choice affecting other miners’ payoffs. Third, the inter-
actions among miners are multiple, and all rational miners maximize

their own interests, which makes it difficult for miners to achieve
equilibria with honest mining during repeated interactions without
complete information.
In this paper, we first formulate the mining process as an iterated
game where all miners in the target pool solve a crypto-puzzle to
win the reward. Second, we propose a method in terms of ZD strate-
gies aiming to optimize the efficiency of the blockchain network,
which serves to incentivize the cooperative mining of miners. Last,
we obtain the theoretical solution of the maximum system welfare
through solving an optimization problem. The main contributions of
this paper are summarized as follows.
1) Novel Model: We model the mining process with a group of
miners solving a crypto-puzzle as an iterated multiplayer game,
which allows competitive and self-organized miners making
decisions for their own to address the problem of cooperative
mining in the PoW-based blockchain network.
2) New Optimized Method: We propose an incentive scheme in
terms of ZD strategies to incentivize miners mining honestly
from the viewpoint of optimization, in which the maximum
welfare of the blockchain network can be achieved.
3) Theoretical and Practical Insights: Our analysis helps us to
understand how different miners choose their strategies to
enable the welfare of a blockchain system at a high level.
Furthermore, our analysis provides a clue for designing a new
consensus algorithm of a blockchain system, where the high
efficient distributed computation is achieved spontaneously.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews
the literature on this topic. Section III describes the system model and
formulates the mining process as a noncooperative iterated game. In
Section IV, we propose a mechanism in terms of ZD strategies to
encourage cooperative mining and improve the efficiency of mining
in PoW-based blockchain networks, in which the condition of the
maximum system welfare is analyzed. In Section V, numerical sim-
ulations are carried out for the proposed ZD strategies. Finally, the
conclusions are stated in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
In the literature, several works have focused on the study of the
pool game based on game theory. For instance, Eyal qualitatively
analyzed the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the mining game and gave
the existence conditions of the NE for any number of pools [5].
In [3], the choice of miners was transformed into a cooperative game
model, in which the members of the same pool were regarded as an
alliance. In [9], the evolutionary games were used to study the dynam-
ics of mining pool selection in a blockchain network, where mining
pools may choose arbitrary block mining strategies. In addition, the
blockchain bifurcation loophole was applied to map the mining model
into a random game with complete information [20]. Furthermore,
Johnson et al. [21] employed a series of game-theoretical models to
explore the tradeoff of DDoS attacks between two pools, and found
that pools have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small
ones. However, how to conduct mining effectively with game theory
in the blockchain network has not been fully considered.
Recently, ZD strategies, as a new method in game theory, have
been applied to study the mining problem of PoW-based blockchain
networks. For instance, in our previous work, we analyzed the exis-
tence conditions of the NE and applied ZD strategies to study
the strategies selection during the PoW consensus process [22].
Moreover, we modeled a mining process with two miners as an
iterated game and proposed a subclass of a ZD strategy to alle-
viate miners’ dilemma in PoW-based blockchain networks [23]. In
addition, in [24], an adaptive ZD strategy was proposed to promote
Fig. 1. PoW-based blockchain network, in which pool miners contribute
their computational resources in exchange for financial rewards R. There are
N miners in the target pool, where each miner has two strategies: H (honest
mining) and D (malicious mining). The honest miner joins the pool with a
hash rate w1, the dishonest miner joins the pool with a hash rate w2, and the
total hash rate of other pools is w.
the cooperation of miners between two pools in the process of pool
mining.
In this paper, we focus on optimization of mining efficient from
the viewpoint of game theory using multiplayer ZD strategies. This
paper is different from the previous studies in the following aspects.
First, we model the mining process as a noncooperative iterated multi-
player game, in which the interactions among miners are multiple. We
capture the scenario of repeated multi-interactions for the mining pro-
cess as an iterated quasi-public goods game (quasi-PGG) [25]. This
is different from previous studies in [22]–[24], where the interaction
of game model with two-player was studied and cannot reflect the
practical complex situation among multiple players. Second, we
develop a theory of multiplayer ZD strategies from the viewpoint
of optimization, in which the optimization of system welfare is
achieved spontaneously from bottom to top. This is also different
from [22]–[24], where the focus was on cooperation of miners and
dynamics of strategies.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a PoW-based blockchain network where each pool
generated by different miners solves a crypto-puzzle competition to
win the reward. According to the Nakamoto consensus protocol [1],
only the first pool that accomplishes the PoW will be rewarded. Thus,
we pay attention to the computational competition of the target pool
who is the winner in a certain turn of the crypto-puzzle solving.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider that there are N miners in
the target pool. As we known, the resource of PoW computation is
consumable while the computational competition is intense, which
results in fact that a part of miners present a dishonest mining strat-
egy during the competition mining process. Consider the competitive
computation as the computational power of miners which provides to
the target pool. Thus, we assume that there are two choices for min-
ers in the pool: H and D, where H means miner with honest strategy
(cooperative mining) and D means miner mining with dishonest strat-
egy (malicious mining). Notably, the probability of the pool winning
the reward is positively proportional to the available computational
power of the pool. If all miners act malicious behaviors, they will
probably get nothing. Therefore, there are strategies choosing for all
miners who act strategically to maximize their own profits during the
mining process. This similarity leads to a strong mapping between

elements of mining process in the PoW-based blockchain network
and game theoretical components.
Definition 1: A mining game G in PoW-based blockchain network
is triple (I,A,U), where:
1) I = {1, 2, . . . ,N} denotes the set of players;
2) A = (a1, . . . , ak, . . . , aN) is the strategy profile of all workers
and ak ∈ {H,D} is the strategy of player k;
3) U presents the realized payoffs and uk presents the payoff of
player k.
There are two components of the block reward, that is, a fixed
token-issuing reward and the fees of the transactions packed in the
block [26]. Let L be the current block size. R is the token-issuing
reward and σ is the transaction confirmation price per unit data size.
The transaction fees can be expressed as σL [27]. Furthermore, the
energy cost of hash computation is also considered for all miners.
Let λ be the energy price for maintaining a unit hash rate during one
block process, and n (n ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . ,N}) be the honest miners in
the target pool. Assume the honest miner joins the pool with a hash
rate w1, while the dishonest miner joins the pool with a hash rate w2.
Here, the dishonest miner only provides partial computational power
for the target pool, which results in w2 � w1. Let w be the total
hash rate of other pools. Thereby, the probability for the target pool
to win the reward is
Pwin = nw1 + (N − n)w2
nw1 + (N − n)w2 + w
.
At last, the reward is shared among all N workers which is positively
proportional to the available computational power of the miners pro-
vided. On the other hand, a miner will cost a high mount λw1 with
strategy H; while he will cost a low mount λw2 with strategy D.
Concretely, if the miner k adopts with strategy H (D) in a certain
turn of the game, his expected payoff will be{
uk
H,n = R+σL
N · Pwin · nw1
nw1+(N−n)w2
− λw1
uk
D,n = R+σL
N · Pwin · (N−n)w2
nw1+(N−n)w2
− λw2.
(1)
Since w2 � w1, the probability Pwin mainly depends on the num-
ber of honest miners n and the hash rate of honest miner w1. Thus,
increasing the number of the honest miner n will greatly enhance the
expected payoff of each miner together with the social welfare of
the target pool when the hash rate is fixed. In addition, the dishonest
miner acts as a spoiler who will threaten the benefit of the target pool.
This phenomenon is similar with “tragedy of the commons” of PGG,
where the free riders contribute less but share the final reward [25].
Under the framework of game theory, the honest miners cannot win
in a single-round game. Fortunately, the situation is changed if the
miners interact repeatedly. Since the mining is a persistent process,
we then capture the scenario of repeated interactions for the mining
process as an iterated quasi-PGG, in which each miner needs to con-
sider effects of his action at any round of the game on the future
feedback of the other miners.
IV. COOPERATIVE MINING WITH ZD STRATEGIES
It is known that the long-memory player has no advantage over the
short-memory player when each stage game is identically repeated
infinite times [11]. Thus, we assume all miners have memory of only
one previous move, that is, all miners’ strategies taken in the current
round only depend on the outcome of the previous round. In this
paper, we focus on miners who only consider their own action in the
previous round and the number of honest miners. That is, the miners
do not know the co-miners’ strategies during the mining process.
After finishing one round of the game, the outcome of game, such as
the number of honest miners, can be observed by the system manager.
For N-miner two-strategy games, there are 2N possible outcomes
in each round. We use a mixed strategy sk to express the conditional
probabilities for the cooperative mining as regards every possible
outcome for the miner k (k ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,N}). Especially, the mixed
strategy is a 2N -dimensional vector
sk =
[
sk
1, . . . , sk
i , . . . , sk
2N
]T
(2)
where sk
i represents the conditional probability for the miner k with
honest strategy in the current round conditioned on the ith outcome
of the previous round.
Denote the number of miners with H among the opponents of
miner k in the last round as m (m ∈ {0, 1, . . . ,N − 1}). Note that if
miner k adopts strategy H, then m = n − 1; while miner k adopts
strategy D, then m = n. If the previous action of the miner k is
H (or D), the probability of his adopting H in the current round
is sH,m (or sD,m). Assume that the game is symmetric, such that
payoffs do not depend on which miners are honest, but on how
many honest miners [14]. In such a scenario, the vector sk in (2)
can be represented by a 2N -dimensional vector with 2N independent
variables as
sk =
[
sk
H,0, . . . , sk
H,m, . . . , sk
H,m, . . . , sk
H,N−1
sk
D,0, . . . , sk
D,m, . . . , sk
D,m, . . . , sk
D,N−1
]T
. (3)
It is noticed that there are
(N−1
m
)
terms of sk
H,m and sk
D,m, which
leads to that the number of independent variable reduces to 2N.
Taking N = 3 as an example, there are 23 possible outcomes. That is
{HHH,HHD,HDH,HDD,DHH,DHD,DDH,DDD}, which results
in that sk = [sk
H,2, sk
H,1, sk
H,1, sk
H,0, sk
D,2, sk
D,1, sk
D,1, sk
D,0]T . Here,
both the second and the third elements are sk
H,1 which corresponds
to the outcomes that miner k takes strategy H while exactly one of
his opponents take strategy H, that is, the element sk
H,1 corresponds
to the outcomes HHD and HDH. Similarly, the element sk
D,1 corre-
sponds to the outcomes DHD and DDH. Thus, the mixed strategy
vector sk of miner k can be expressed with six independent variables,
that is, sk
H,j, and sk
D,j(j = 0, 1, 2).
Similarly, the payoff vector Uk of the miner k can be represented by
Uk =
[
uk
H,0, . . . , uk
H,m, . . . , uk
H,m, . . . , uk
H,N−1

D,m, . . . , uk
D,N−1
]T
(4)
where there are
(N−1
m
)
terms of uk
H,m and uk
D,m.
On the other hand, the multiminer game can be characterized by
a Markov chain with a state transition matrix M = [qij]2N×2N [14],
where qij represents the probability of transition from the previous
state i to the current state j. For a state HHD when N = 3 as an exam-
ple, the conditional probabilities that the miners 1, 2, and 3 select
H (or D) in the current round are s1
H,1, s2
H,1, and s3
D,2, respectively.
Therefore, the probability q23 of transition from the previous state
HHD to the current state HDH equals s1
H,1(1 − s2

D,2. Define a
matrix M′ ≡ M − I, where I is the identity matrix. If the transition
matrix M is regular, it will ensure that there is a stationary vector v,
such that vT · M = vT and vT · M′ = 0 [11]. Assume f is the last
column of M′. Then, we get the equation
vT · f = det
(
s1, . . . , sk, . . . , f
)
where (s1, . . . , sk, . . . , f) is a 2N × 2N matrix. Replacing f with
θ1U1 + ∑N
k=2 θkUk − γ 1 by using the Laplace expansion, we can

where Ek is the expected payoff of worker k; γ is a scalar; and
θk(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,N}) are the weight factors of payoff function Uk.

enforce a linear relationship between each miner’s excepted payoff,
that is,
θ1E1 +
∑N
k=1,k �=k0
θkEk − γ = 0. (7)
We call these linear combinations of miners’ payoff vectors as ZD
strategies whose definition results from det(s1, . . . , sk, . . . , f) = 0.
Note that the s̃k0 is the last column of M′, which is determined by
sk0 . Concretely, we denote it as
s̃k0 =

Define the total expected payoff of all miners as the system wel-
fare, that is, Esys = θ1E1 +∑N

θkEk. According to (7), we
know that when the miner takes the ZD strategy regardless of the
behavior of other miners, he can pin the total excepted payoff of
all his opponents at a desired level, that is, γ = Esys. Thus, the
maximum and stable system welfare can be achieved by solving the

γmax = min{WD(m),WH(m) + (1/ψ)} which is independent with
other miners’ strategies. The similarity also fits for the case of ψ < 0,
in which γmax = min{WD(m)− (1/ψ),WH(m)}.
To summarize, when the miner takes the ZD strategy whatever
the strategies of other miners are taken, the system welfare can be
unilaterally maintained at the value of γmax as shown in (13).
Remark 1: It is shown that γmax is a linear combination of payoff
uk
H,m and uk
D,m which rely on system parameters R, L, m, w1, w2, and
w. In fact, R and L only have an influence on the value of γmax, while
m, w1, w2, and w also affect the strategy selection of the miners, that
is, the equilibria of the mining game.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we illustrate the performance of the ZD strate-
gies of the mining game with numerical analysis. To illustrate
the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we compare ZD strate-
gies with other classical strategies, such as average strategy [28]
s = [s1, . . . , si, . . . , s2N ]T (si = 0.5 for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2N});
aggressive strategy [29] s = [s1, . . . , si, . . . , s2N ]T (si = 0 for all
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2N}, i.e., attack all the time); energy-saving strat-
egy [30] s = [s1, . . . , si, . . . , s2N ]T (si = 1 for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2N},
i.e., cooperative mining all the time); win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS)
strategy [31] (cooperate after mutual cooperation and mutual attack
otherwise attack); and Tit-for-Tat [31] (cooperate if at least k co-
miners cooperated in the previous round). Assume that the original

1, . . . , v0
i , . . . , v0
2N ]T , where
v0
i = 0.125 for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2N}.
We first consider the situation when N = 3. Set system parameters
as R = 7, σ = 0.5, L = 2, λ = 0.02, w1 = 40, w2 = 1, w = 5,
θ1 = −0.1, θ2 = 0.2, θ3 = 0.2, and ψ = −0.5. Let one miner
adopts the ZD strategy whose s̃k0 satisfies (6). Fig. 2 shows that an
energy-saving strategy facing energy-saving strategy can result in the
highest system welfare, whose performance is better than the other
strategies’ performance. However, compared to the average-taking
and the aggressive strategies, the miner taking the ZD strategy can
always achieve the higher system welfare when facing an average-
taking miner or an aggressive miner. In Fig. 3, we show that when the
miner adopts the ZD strategy facing the WSLS opponents, the system
welfare converges to a high and stable value at 5.27. However, when
the miner adopts the TFT facing the WSLS opponents, the system
welfare is fluctuated around 3. The similar situation occurs in the
scene of the ZD strategy versus the TFT, in which the welfare with
the ZD strategy is higher than that of welfare with the TFT strategy.
While in Fig. 4, we show the effect of the weight factor on the social
welfare. For convenience, we set θ2 = θ3 = θ . We fix θ1 = −0.1
and vary the value of θ which satisfy (6) to show the effect on the
performance of ZD strategies. It is shown that when the miner takes
ZD strategies, the social welfare converges to stable values which
decrease with the increasing of value θ .
In Figs. 5–7, we illustrate the performance of the ZD strategies
when N = 6. In this case, we set parameters as R = 10, σ = 0.5,
L = 8, λ = 0.02, w1 = 40, w2 = 1, w = 5, θ1 = −0.1, θ2 = 0.2,
θ3 = 0.1, θ4 = 0.2, θ5 = 0.2, θ6 = 0.1, and ψ = −0.5. Let one miner

adopt the ZD strategy whose s̃k0 satisfies (6). Fig. 5 shows that when
the miner takes the energy-saving facing the energy-saving strategy
or the average-taking strategy, the system welfare converges to 5.22
and 5.15, where the performance is better than that of performance
with one miner takes the energy-saving facing aggressive strategy.
Furthermore, when the miner takes the ZD strategy facing the energy-
saving strategy, the system welfare can reach a high and stable value
at 7.29. In Fig. 6, we show the performance of the ZD strategy versus
the WSLS and TFT strategies, in which the performance of the ZD
strategy is better than other strategies. We also show the effect of
the weight factor on the social welfare in Fig. 7. Similarly, we set

different values of θ when N = 6.
θ2 = θ3 = θ4 = θ5 = θ6 = θ . We fix θ1 = −0.1 and vary the value
of θ . Here, parameters also satisfy (6). It is shown that the stable
value of social welfare decreases with the increasing of value θ .
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have considered the problem of cooperative min-
ing for the PoW-based blockchain network. We have modeled the
process of mining as an iterated quasi-PGG which can be considered
as a multitask consensus protocol among rational and selfish miners.
Further, we have proposed the ZD-strategies-based mechanism to ana-
lyze the process of mining, in which the miner is able to maintain the
system welfare at a desired value whatever the strategies of others
are taking. Moreover, we have analyzed the maximum system wel-
fare through solving an optimization problem. In addition, we have
compared the proposed ZD strategies with other classical strategies
in dealing with the cooperative mining problem by the numerical
simulations.
