Abstract
The invention of blockchain technology, coupled with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, 
has given rise to a new form of monetised gaming known as “Play to Earn” (PTE). “Axie Infinity” 
(AI) is currently the most popular PTE game, occupying a large portion of the online gaming market. 
In this paper, we profile the risks and benefits of PTE gaming, with a specific focus on AI. Qualitative 
data in the form of online chat threads was evaluated via a Thematic Analysis (TA) approach. 
The analysis revealed a number of themes including the dominance of extrinsically motivated 
gameplay in conjunction with negative appraisals of game quality, the benefits and costs of 
play, and the potential for PTE scholarship models to be associated with exploitation. The 
results did, however, indicate awareness of potential consumer risks. The findings have 
implications for informing consumer education, regulation, as well as areas of focus in 
future quantitative research.
Keywords Play to Earn · Axie Infinity · Online gaming · Cryptocurrency
“Play to Earn” (PTE) is an emerging branch of online gaming, whereby individuals receive 
monetary rewards for gameplay (Absolute Reports, 2022). In some earlier games (e.g. Diablo 
series and others), this emerged in the form of in-game currencies, enabling players to accu-
mulate value that could be used to purchase various digital items. This was soon followed by 
the ability to buy and sell in-game artefacts or player “skins” on third party sites or use them 
as assets for gambling (Abarbanel et  al., 2019). Increasingly, such gaming assets are being 
deployed using modern blockchain technology (e.g. VGO skins) which has the advantage of 
providing a more secure and definitive ownership model for gaming participants. Such assets 
increasingly take the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or in-game cryptocurrencies (Aguila 
et al., 2022) that can be traded on exchanges in return for fiat currency (e.g. USD and AUD). 
NFTs are non-interchangeable assets that rely on decentralised blockchain technology to main-
tain their digital value (Chohan & Paschen, 2021) and can include characters, avatars, entry 
tickets, tools, or weapons that generate value in the game. The PTE model usually involves

the purchase of a quantity of in-game currency, some quantity of the Layer 1 blockchain cur-
rency (e.g. Solana, Ethereum, or Harmony) for gas/transaction fees, and the purchase of cer-
tain “genesis” NFTs to enable full engagement with the game.
The public’s interest in the potential of PTE and blockchain technology most promi-
nently emerged in late 2017, with the short-lived popularity of Cryptokitties. This competi-
tive PTE game enabled players to earn in-game currency, breed kitties, and trade them via 
the Ethereum blockchain (Jiang & Liu, 2021). The overall concept of PTE gaming is an 
attractive business model from both a consumer and industry perspective. For players, PTE 
provides earning potential which may be particularly attractive for otherwise unemployed 
or low-income earning individuals (Nadini et al., 2021) or those that reside in the Philip-
pines and other third-world nations (Francisco et  al.,  2022). For the industry, money is 
made through the sale of NFTs and appreciation of the in-game currency, which is usually 
privately sold (at a very low price) to early investors and the development team prior to the 
games release. Although there are currently 200 PTE and metaverse games in operation or 
in the early stages of development, the market is largely dominated by a few top perform-
ers. The most popular PTE game within the current market is Axie Infinity (AI), an NFT-
based online game residing on the Ethereum blockchain (Aguila et al., 2022).
Similar to Cryptokitties, AI involves players purchasing NFT characters called 
“Axies” and battling them against each other to earn currency, in this case, Smooth 
Love Potion (SLP). SLP is an in-game currency and the primary source of income 
for AI players, which can be traded or exchanged for real fiat currency (Aguila et al., 
2022). Whilst AI was originally designed by Sky Mavis to be an accessible introduc-
tion to NFT based gaming, its popularity has risen exponentially since late 2020 (The 
Game Statistics Authority, 2022) (see Fig.  1). AI has a market capitalisation (total 
circulating token supply × current market price) of $3.12b USD, which is many times 
larger than its nearest rival, e.g. Illuvium ($500  m), Thetan Arena ($129  m), Gods 
Unchained ($29 m), or Alien Worlds ($93 m). Beyond the financial element, AI’s pop-
ularity can be attributed to its visually appealing graphics and simple card-game for-
mat, attracting a wide audience, irrespective of skill level (De Jesus et al., 2022).

Consumer Issues Relating to PTE Games
Despite PTE games’ popularity amongst consumers, there have been some concerns raised 
about the potential impact of this technology on gaming experiences, as well as its potential for 
harm (De Jesus et al., 2022). The first important issue is whether requiring players to buy NFTs 
contributes to concerns regarding the increasing monetization of gaming (e.g. Darakjian, 2015; 
Macey & Bujic, 2022; Tregel et al., 2020). As these authors point out, when players can pay 
money to improve their in-game performance, skilled play may no longer be the sole determi-
nant of player success. It also means that income and affordability could potentially advantage 
wealthier players and make the game less accessible to lower income groups.1 The second issue 
(harm) relates to whether these games and strongly monetized structures may be more appeal-
ing to higher risk gamblers, who are already experiencing issues relating to internet gaming 
disorder (Delfabbro et al., 2021). Several studies have demonstrated a significant positive asso-
ciation between the purchase of loot boxes and financial harm which suggests that these features 
may be appealing to people with problems relating to gambling (Carey et al., 2021).
In theory, loot boxes are a gambling-like feature included in many current online games, 
in which players earn or buy mystery boxes, which contain various in-game prizes. These 
share some elements in common with PTE gaming, as both are a form of monetization in 
which game assets can be obtained by making expenditures. These kinds of purchases have 
been associated with sunk cost effects, where players feel obliged to continue gameplay due 
to prior investment of time or money (King & Delfabbro, 2018). Although evidence support-
ing a link between loot box participation and higher risk gambling is correlational (i.e. people 
who gamble will be attracted to “gambling-like” features in games rather than being encour-
aged to gamble by playing loot boxes), it is consistently observed that loot boxes are more 
popular amongst gamers who report problems associated with gambling (Zendle & Cairns, 
2018; Zendle et al., 2019, 2020). These individuals generally indicate a stronger involvement 
in the game, as based on willingness to spend money in order to improve game status and 
performance. PTE creates the possibility of individuals being motivated to extend their pur-
chases to NFTs and often highly volatile cryptocurrencies, to fund their gambling. Therefore, 
it is possible that PTE games may be an anathema to many committed gamers who dislike 
monetized features and the idea of “grinding” out micro-rewards (Macey & Bujic, 2022). 
Such games may instead appeal to gamers who are already interested in cryptocurrency, 
although this remains an issue for further research as this market develops.
A particularly important element of PTE games which is a feature of AI is the concept 
of scholarship programs. Similar to the rental system evident in Cryptokitties, scholarship 
programs involve wealthy players known as “managers” lending their Axies to “scholars”. 
This allows gamers, particularly those of a poorer demographic, the opportunity to play for 
free. In return, the managers obtain a portion of the scholar’s gaming income by devoting 
their capital (their NFT or Axie) to obtain a return on the labour of others. Such schemes 
theoretically offer opportunities for those who may not have the funds to pay for the entry 
cost into the game. However, a potential risk of these schemes is that they might lead to a 
form of exploitation in which people from less-advantaged countries provide a cheap form 
of labour and many hours of effort to benefit those with the wealth to afford the NFTs. 
Long hours of play may contribute to fatigue and stress if the scholarship recipients do

across a number of players. Rental and scholarship systems are another method being used.

not meet a certain level of performance (De Jesus et al., 2022), but this is a topic which 
requires additional investigation. Similar concerns have been raised about the so-called 
practice of “gold farming” in which young people have been observed playing games in 
factory like conditions to earn in-game rewards which are sold for profit by the manage-
ment of the operation (see Dubbell, 2015; Tai & Hu, 2018; Woodcock, 2018).
Conversely, the benefits of PTE games is that they may allow players to build an online 
community and socialise without face-to-face interaction (King et al., 2020). This was found 
to be particularly important amidst the global pandemic, with engagement in PTE games iden-
tified as a coping strategy during extended lockdowns (De Jesus et al., 2022). In addition to 
the social benefits, PTE games, by design, present an opportunity for financial gains. Individu-
als residing in third-world countries appear to benefit most from the PTE structure, with the 
potential to attract incomes far greater than the national average wage (De Jesus et al., 2022).
The Present Study
Despite the early insights, relatively little is known about these newly emerging games, the major 
issues that should be considered, and whether they are a topic in need of greater regulatory scru-
tiny and research interest. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to examine player per-
ceptions of PTE gaming using AI as a particular focus. The following research questions were 
examined: (a) What are the risks and benefits associated with engaging in PTE games? (b) What 
attitudes do people have towards PTE gaming and what are their experiences? (c) In what ways 
does PTE differ from traditional online gaming? These insights may provide a starting point for 
more detailed quantitative studies of PTE gaming and provide some early guidance concerning 
potential consumer protection and regulation of this emerging class of activities.
Methods
Data Source
To gain an understanding of players’ interactions with AI, Reddit, Twitter, Bitcoin Talk, Axie Infin-
ity and Smogan: Axie Infinity were utilised. This captured two of the major general online com-
ment sites as well as the relevant game-specific sites. Initially, the subreddit page “r/AxieInfinity” 
was monitored over 2 weeks. From the 5th to the 20th of January 2022, the most popular daily 
threads were collected. Following this, Twitter’s most trending tweets including the phrase “Axie 
Infinity” were collected from the 9th to the 15th of February 2022. To avoid coding the same 
content twice, this excluded several threads which overlapped with previous days’ highest trending 
terms. All threads from the online chat forums “Bitcoin Talk; Axie Infinity” and “Smogan; Axie 
Infinity” were collected from the 5th to the 20th of January 2022. The final data source comprised 
a combined text block of (22,785 words) copied verbatim into a Word document.
Analysis Framework
Data analysis involved an inductive approach to identify key themes, in the absence of pre-
defined theories or assumptions (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Specifically, themes were developed 
International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction 
1 3
at a semantic level, with meaning derived explicitly from the data (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Fur-
ther, an overarching realist epistemological approach was taken, whereby individuals’ experi-
ences and understandings of the world were considered equally valid constructions of reality.
Given the subjective nature of the chosen qualitative research approach, it is important 
to acknowledge the researchers’ potential influence on the data. The first researcher is a 
Caucasian, 21-year-old female university student who has previously worked with chil-
dren with gaming disorders and has insight into the potential impact of PTE gaming. To 
mitigate these potential biases, data was cross-checked with another senior researcher.
Data Analysis Procedure
Braun and Clarke’s (2006) methodological approach to Thematic Analysis (TA) was uti-
lised to guide analysis. This approach was most appropriate as it allowed for flexibility 
of understanding players’ experiences, whilst still organising the data into well-defined 
themes (Pietkiewicz & Smith, 2014). Initially, the entire data set was read multiple 
times, to gain a broad understanding of the content. In this early phase, general notes 
were created, including phrases such as “it looks like many players don’t actually like 
the game” and “there are a lot of players originating from the Philippines”. Following 
this, the transcript was converted into the qualitative data analysis software program 
“NVivo”. This allowed for the next phase of coding, which involved identifying and 
grouping relevant and consistent themes in the data. Due to the absence of preconceived 
theories, multiple passes of the data were required before any codes were identified. 
Consequently, the codes changed significantly from the first to last pass, as with each 
pass new ideas became apparent.
Once codes were developed, a thematic map was created via the software program 
“DisplayR”. This allowed for early insight towards how the codes relate to one another 
and the identification of patterns. Within this phase, numerous codes were reconfigured 
due to their overall insignificance or irrelevance towards the research question.
Ethical Considerations
Despite this study being relatively low risk, ethical precautions were taken. Data collection 
only occurred within platforms where users provided consent to having their responses 
become publicly distributed upon signing up. In addition, confidentiality was maintained 
with all data de-identified and personal information replaced with alpha-numeric codes.
Results
Overview of Themes
In total, fourteen coded themes were identified as listed in Table 1, with the most com-
mon including “Ambivalence”, “Negatively Influencing Mental Health” and “Liken-
ing the Game to a Job’. For example, whilst divergent cases of “Extrinsic Motivation” 
were initially recorded, this code only attracted 0.88% of coverage and was therefore 
deleted. Finally, after numerous passes and restructures, five themes were identified: 
 International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction

“Enjoyability of Gameplay”, “Importance of the Financial Component”, “Scholarship 
Program”, “Mental Health and Wellbeing Outcomes”, and “General Understanding of 
AI and PTE”. To assess the inter-rater reliability of codes, 14% (50 out of 350) of the 
statements and the resultant categories were given to a second rater. Overall, the clas-
sifications were very similar (a mean k = 0.82 was obtained across all the categories as 
based on coding of the statements within or outside of the relevant category) (McHugh, 
2012). More specifically, raters agreed on 41 occasions. To manage the inconsistencies 
and reach consensus, a new, more appropriate sub-category was developed.
Five primary themes along with multiple subthemes were identified within the current 
data (Table 2). These themes best capture the experiences, beliefs, and attitudes expressed 
within the data, directly addressing the research questions.
Theme 1—Enjoyability of Gameplay
One of the most prevalent themes within the data was the discussion of AI’s gameplay. 
Players often exhibited ambivalence, describing both positive and negative elements of the 
game in the same blog post. This was divided into two subthemes: “Enjoy” and “Dislike”. 
Many respondents who posted on Reddit reported disliking the gameplay. For example, 
many regular players drew attention to the structural and visual characteristics of the game 
and described it as basic, repetitive, and often boring.
But then again, matches started to stay very boring, I mean, veeeery boring, idk if the 
SLP prices down have a huge impact in the game felling that I have while playing, or 
the game simply ins’t interesting anymore…
Whilst there were far fewer instances of player enjoyment overall, the Twitter data set 
attracted the most positive comments. These were directed towards enjoyment of AI’s 
graphics and the sense of community PTE games provide.

Quantitative data in the form of a Reddit poll supports the overall trend in the data and 
indicated that 57% (N = 1713) of players did not find AI enjoyable.
Theme 2—Importance of the Financial Component
Money and the financial component of AI was a frequent topic of discussion. The first sub-
theme “Incentive” indicated gaming behaviour was highly reward-driven and extrinsically 
motivated. Therefore, whilst players did find some enjoyment from AI, this was secondary 
to the financial incentive.
The idea of earning while playing has made me like the game itself. When I first dis-
covered it, I was hesitant to put out money since I’m not yet sure how I could make it 
all back but ever since I have purchased it, I didn’t regret it either way
The second subtheme “Income” reflected the financial losses and gains of players. 
Although the profitability of AI was the primary motivator towards gameplay, many play-
ers reported financial losses. Indeed, only 44% (N = 1313) of players on a Reddit poll 
reported making money from the game. As a result, numerous players indicated a level 
of financial harm, desire to break even, chase their losses, or continue playing until prior 
investments were earned back.
I dont wanna quit yet cuz I invested in this game and i wanna have ROI before I quit
Due to the importance of money within AI, wealth or greater financial success often 
appeared to be associated with gaming enjoyment. Money facilitated the purchase of better 
Axies which in turn created a more profitable and enjoyable gaming experience. Equally, 
those who were less financially inclined described a poorer gaming experience, less ability 
to explore different teams, and experiencing greater frustration towards losses.
The main problem with Axie for me is that Axies are too expensive and there is no 
way to test out builds. Due to this reason people are stuck with what they have and 
can’t experiment with builds.
This theme suggests that, although the appeal of PTE games heavily surrounds the 
financial component, many players do not make money, and this may result in negative 
responses from players.
Theme 3—Scholarship Programs
The new concept of scholarship programs attracted divided opinions. These were separated 
into “Risk” and “Benefit” subthemes. Respondents that resided in third-world countries 
or had poor gaming knowledge were identified as most at risk of unfair scholarship splits. 
Whilst the average split was approximately 50/50, these vulnerable players described some 
falling as low as 20/80. This resulted in a strong manager-scholar power imbalance.
I get paid 20% no matter the slp price and if I stop playing for a day a get a warning 
(3 warning and I am out) only so I guess there so different splits
In contrast, some players described the benefits of scholarships and of the ability to earn 
more money within the game than the average national income in their country. Although 
International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction 
1 3
this “Benefits” subtheme was relatively infrequent, some players viewed AI as providing 
unemployed individuals an income, even during the current global pandemic.
The good thing about crypto world (or just internet, since freelancing online is a 
thing since forever) is that you are not screwed by your geographical location -- or 
less screwed, cuz taxes and etc from your online earning is still a thing. But at least 
you are provided with more opportunities to get something than having to rely on 
solely real life job.
This data suggests that, although scholarships do provide an opportunity for players that 
would otherwise not be able to play, these schemes are unregulated and leave open oppor-
tunities for exploitation.
Theme 4—Mental Health and Wellbeing Outcomes
Many comments related to the negative mental health outcomes are associated with game-
play. The “Negative Wellbeing” subtheme reflected descriptions of intense anxiety, stress, 
and fatigue directly associated with AI gameplay. Whilst there are numerous player modes 
within AI, “Arena” appeared to evoke the most anxiety. This may be attributable to the 
increased potential for loss within the Arena which carried greater financial and emotional 
consequences than other play modes.
Playing arena is so mentally exhausting, its not worth getting anxiety attacks just for 
mere cents
Further, players often described unhealthy gaming behaviours. For this study, 
“unhealthy” was defined as extended gameplay which resulted in other areas of the players’ 
life being neglected.
I have played 40 energy for almost 8 months nonstop. Haven’t stopped playing a sin-
gle day even on Christmas day, my birthday etc
Eh, I run and manage 50 scholarships while balancing university, military life, and 
my family. Get about 3 hours of sleep a day (not that I would recommend this)
In addition, players described a particular series of problematic behaviours as catego-
rised under the “Novel Behaviours” subtheme. A number of players likened AI gameplay 
to employment. This included references to AI being a chore, playing being a “job”, play-
ers being “employees”, and managers describing the game as a “company”.
If you are a manager w/ scholar, lets be real, this is a company w/ employees. And 
the last thing we want to be is turn into a corporation that don’t value their employees
This implied that Conceptualising AI as a job may have been associated with poorer 
mental health outcomes. Specifically, players reported lower enjoyment and attributed 
greater emotional distress towards losses than those who played AI for entertainment.
Theme 5—General Understanding of AI and PTE
The final theme identified within the data set involved players understandings and attitude 
towards the PTE gaming structure, specifically in relation to AI. The “Market Awareness” 
 International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction
1 3
subtheme reflected many players distrust for the cryptocurrency market, expressing caution 
towards its volatile nature.
AXS is the worst performing crypto today as it crashed by 13%. That should give 
you an idea. And yes, things are looking pretty bad for this game and if they don’t 
listen to the community and find a good solution, this game will pretty much die
Player’s knowledge of the market in addition to the significant initial investment and 
ongoing costs associated with AI caused many to feel that the game can take advantage of 
players. This was especially true for unsuccessful players who made little or no returns on 
their initial investment. More extreme examples of this theme were observed amongst the 
second “Ripped Off” subtheme, where players likened AI to a “pyramid scheme”.
Yes, Play to Earn is a lie, for now. Axie infinity is now Win to Earn + Pay to Win so 
it’s on an edge to be a pyramid scheme right now, but it still has potential because we 
“believe” land game is coming
Within this subtheme, some players also expressed feelings of AI the game being 
designed so players were “set up to fail/lose”. This was directed towards specific elements 
of AI, including the 800mmr update and critical strikes (“crits”) in Arena. Further, play-
ers seemed distrustful towards the randomisation element of gameplay and discussed the 
potential for AI to employ deceptive tactics which reduce wins.
I gave up on arena a few weeks ago, it feels rigged. Everytime since the july update 
whenever i started to go past 1000 with my shitty team (with which i was keeping 
around 1300 before) the game starts the "f--k you stay down
Discussion
This exploratory qualitative study aimed to investigate the experiences of PTE gamers by 
profiling the risks and benefits of AI. The results indicated five principal insights. First, it 
appears that player attitudes towards the game are mixed. Although some players expressed 
enjoyment in playing the game and, in particular, opportunities for social interactions, the 
majority reported not enjoying the game. In other words, the level of intrinsic motivation 
to play appears to be low. Second, and related to the first point, it appears that much of 
the gameplay (true the name PTE) is extrinsically motivated, despite the fact that 44% of 
participants in online surveys report not obtaining income from gameplay. Third, although 
scholarship programs presented an opportunity for income, the data suggests that they are 
unlikely to be a viable long-term replacement for conventional employment. In particu-
lar, although players from third-world countries were identified as being the most likely to 
benefit from scholarships, they also were the most vulnerable to being taken advantage of 
by these schemes. A fourth issue was that negative mental health outcomes appear to be 
common, with many players frequently reporting feelings of anxiety, stress, and depres-
sion along with various novel behaviours such as likening gameplay to employment. A 
final insight was that many players exhibited in-depth market knowledge of the game and 
its financial dynamics. This indicated that they were aware of the ways in which the game 
could be unfair or disadvantageous. In other words, players appeared to show some degree 
of consumer awareness and were able to identify the potential risks and benefits associated 
with gameplay.

Theoretical and Policy Implications
Despite the current popularity of AI (Aguila et  al., 2022), the results show that players 
frequently reported a dislike for gameplay and that they were largely playing for extrinsic 
rewards. This observation suggests that the introduction of PTE may lead to differences in 
the nature of gaming interactions, namely, financial returns rather than enjoyment. This 
may pose some potential risks, in that previous gaming research has identified intrinsic 
motivations like enjoyment, as a protective factor against negative mental health outcomes 
(Peracchia et al., 2019). Consequently, players who lack any genuine game enjoyment may 
not obtain the usual benefits of gaming (e.g. relaxation and enjoyment). Instead, their gam-
ing experiences may be increasingly dictated by their performances and outcomes. These 
observations are consistent with issues raised in previous research and commentaries 
(Dubell, 2018; Macey & Bujic, 2022; Tregel et al., 2020).
In addition to such experiences being less likely to alleviate anxiety and depression 
(Peracchia et al., 2019), they may, in fact, only serve to exacerbate these problems. This is 
in line with the Self-Determination Theory which recognises individuals’ need for autono-
mous fulfilment (Mills & Allen, 2020). These findings lead to the potential speculation 
that players increased rates of anxiety and depression might be observed within this style 
of gaming as a result of the differences in motivation and possible dependency of their 
emotional reactions to the game being dictated by factors which they are unable to con-
trol (e.g. more skilled opponents). This may be particularly so if the players have a strong 
financial need to win and earn an income or if they have an existing history of problems 
associated with gambling, involving chasing outcomes to recoup earlier losses or financial 
investments. Surveys suggest that less than half of AI players appear to report making a 
profit, despite the fact that many PTE gamers report, on average, spending 4 h a day for 
2–3 months to receive return on their initial investment (Francisco et al., 2022).
The scholarship programs offered by AI appear to be one of the most contentious areas. 
Although emerging literature has focused primarily on the concepts of scholarships and 
identifying theoretical benefits (Aguila et al., 2022), the current study found that their real-
life application may also attract some potential for harm. Players may initially be attracted 
to these schemes because they liken them to a job, but conceptualising gameplay in this 
way can also cause players to attribute greater emotional distress towards losses than those 
who played AI for entertainment. Unlike real-work-place scenarios, players are not pro-
tected by safeguards, regulations, or any true labour contract. Consequently, exploitation is 
likely to be common, with frequent reports of unfair income splits of as low as 20/80, poor 
working environments, and unrealistic expectations to meet daily quotas (De Jesus et al., 
2022). Players in the Philippines and other third-world countries, for example, were identi-
fied as the highest risk of exploitation, due to the frequency of unfair profit division and 
financial over-dependency on AI. These observations confirm what has been previously 
noted about South East Asia and the issues associated with “gold farming” (Dubbell, 2015; 
Tai & Hu, 2018).
Players also raised concerns about the declining benefits associated with the game. 
This is consistent with similar issues raised about the short-term mania associated with 
the Cryptokitties blockchain game in 2017–2018. As Jiang and Liu (2021) observed, this 
game only proved to be profitable for the majority of players for a very short period of 
time. The game was quickly flooded by too many players and kitties (many players left 
soon afterwards), income declined, the costs of using the Ethereum blockchain became too 
expensive, and the game became overly dominated by high value players and considerable

inequality in the returns achieved. For these reasons, the overall profitability of PTE gam-
ing is an area that requires future research attention.
The fact that AI gamers exhibited high levels of market knowledge or awareness of the 
risks is important, but it is not clear whether this information was available to them when 
they first commenced playing. For this reason, an important consumer protection meas-
ure would be to provide new players with greater access to materials relating to (a) the 
expected returns associated with AI playing, (b) the benefits and costs of the scholarship 
program, (c) insights into the barriers to entry (only early adopters would have been able 
to buy the Axies or NFT animals at a cheaper price), and (d) the potential risks associated 
with excessive playing.
Limitations and Future Directions
The first limitation of this study surrounded the use of online forums. Although Reddit, 
Twitter, and the various other discussion platforms provided easily accessible data in the 
absence of participant bias, it captured only a specific demographic of gamer; that shares 
their experiences of gameplay publicly and is interested in others’ experiences. Due to the 
high frequency of players reporting dislike towards gameplay, it is possible that this cohort 
overrepresents player dissatisfaction and underrepresents gamer enjoyment. Second, due to 
the nature of the data set, information regarding participant age, gender, country of origin, 
culture, and other descriptive characteristics was not accessible. For this reason, it will be 
important that the themes identified in this preliminary qualitative work are extended using 
larger quantitative findings. For example, it would be useful to conduct a survey of gam-
ing forum participants to capture more detailed demographics, measures of gaming disor-
der, motivation, and gaming habits that could be matched up with qualitative data. Using 
this type of quantitative analysis, it would be possible to measure differences in motivation 
associated with PTE games more formally using validated measures and whether these dif-
ferences pose a greater risk for psychological harm and gaming disorder. It would also be 
important to examine whether people who have an existing interest in gambling or who 
report problems with gambling are more likely to be attracted to these activities.
Conclusion
New models of gaming based on blockchain have the potential to benefit players by 
providing a financial return and more definitive ownership over their assets. It may also 
create opportunities for income earning in  situations where no other employment is 
available. However, PTE gaming must also be monitored carefully to avoid the prospect 
of labour exploitation and harmful consequences for vulnerable players, who may be 
tempted to spend time grinding out rewards rather than playing for enjoyment. Profit-
able and ethical business models for PTE games will need to provide greater accessibil-
ity to gaming opportunities for all players, balance the play and earn elements, and be 
mindful of how game structures might lead to excessive gaming or the unethical use of 
the gaming platforms to exploit vulnerable populations.
