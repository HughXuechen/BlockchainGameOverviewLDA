Abstract. The paper presents a mathematical description of the vote
delegation incentive process for funding proposals in a decentralized gov-
ernance system using a blockchain-based voting. Two models of bribing a
delegate by a proposer submitting proposals for funding are considered:
“Rational Delegates” and “Emotional Delegates”. In terms of parameters
describing the voting process, a sufficient condition for a Nash equilib-
rium is found to be as follows: if both a proposer and a delegate do not
intend to participate in bribery. Moreover, it is shown at what share of
the briber’s stake this condition is satisfied. The main practical result of
the paper is the possibility to define what kind of an attacker (in terms of
the bribing capability) we will be able to resist under certain parameters.

1 Introduction
Development of an effective on-chain decentralized governance remains one of
the most complicated issues in blockchain-based systems design. Some solutions
are hybrid off-chain and on-chain systems (e.g., Dash [1]) while others are purely
on-chain governance systems (e.g., Tezos [4], Ethereum Classic [12]). More infor-
mation about blockchain governance can be found in [5,11,13]. The important
part of cryptocurrency governance is a self-funding mechanism, often called a
treasury system, providing a decentralized funding distribution among projects
aimed at cryptocurrency development and growth. One of such funding systems,
called Catalyst, is implemented in Cardano [3]. There is a special platform where
users can submit their proposals on Cardano improvement [2]. The voting pro-
cess is carried out on Cardano blockchain using the special voting protocol that
provides privacy [17].
As we can see from the past Catalyst Funds (rounds of voting), there are
a lot of proposals related to different topics: from development and audit to
marketing and global adoption etc. Obviously, stakeholders cannot be experts

in all proposals’ topics of all Catalyst Funds; they do not have enough time and
expertise to go through hundreds of proposals and vote for them. In this regard,
the problem of constructing an effective delegation incentive scheme arises. Such
a scheme should provide:
– high quality decision-making by professional delegates;
– increased stake participation (stakeholders spend less time and may spend
less effort in Catalyst);
– higher level of security against treasury attacks (harder attacks to takeover
Catalyst control in fully decentralized environment).
So, the proposed delegation incentive scheme aims to satisfy interests of
all honest players, minimize risks arising from malicious behavior and provide
growth of the overall cryptocurrency value.
Construction, description and security rationale of such a complex process as
Catalyst voting [17] requires use of results from various fields of applied math-
ematics. Most of all it is related to various areas in cryptology, since many
symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid cryptosystems, zero-knowledge proofs, secret
sharing schemes etc. are used in the voting process.
One of the most important fields of mathematics employed to build the incen-
tive system in Catalyst is game theory. So, the paper [6] describes a probabilistic
approach to incentives distribution using a kind of lottery. Existence of a Nash
equilibrium for this model is proved, moreover, the proof is constructive, and
various properties of this equilibrium are described.
Contributions. The obtained results are also in the field of game theory, but
they are related only to analysis of the conditions under which a threat of voter
bribery arises.
To analyze the threats related to bribery, we fulfilled the following tasks:
– the mathematical model that fully describes the process of receiving incentives
by delegates was built;
– two models of bribing a delegate by a proposer were considered: “Rational
Delegates” and “Emotional Delegates”;
– all possible conditions of a Nash equilibrium existence for these models were
analyzed;
– in terms of parameters describing the voting process, a sufficient condition
was formulated and proved that a Nash equilibrium exists only if both a
proposer and a delegate do not intend to participate in bribery;
– it was shown at what stake share owned by a briber the above condition is
satisfied.
1.1 Related Work
The problem of voting on the blockchain was studied in many papers. One of the
most fundamental works in this field is [10]. This paper looks into the blockchain
application in electronic voting. It was shown that the blockchain technology can
solve some of the issues of electronic election systems, but there are questions
regarding privacy protection and scalability. Besides, this paper also contains a
large and detailed overview of other papers.
A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives 277
Among other studies dealing with the blockchain-based voting we can list
the following ones:
– [16] – on advantages of using blockchain for voting and additional opportu-
nities related to the blockchain application;
– [14] – on principles for building an anonymous decentralized e-voting system
using a ring signature mechanism and the blockchain technology to ensure
anonymity, integrity and transparency;
– [7] – on distributed protocols that privately compute outcomes of a voting
scheme revealing a limited amount of information.
However, it should be noted that the subjects of these papers do not include
the issue of bribery.
The book [8] studies many aspects of voting including risks related to bribery
using game theory (Chap. 7). Similar issues were discussed in more detail in
[9,15], and each of these papers contains its own specific mathematical model
corresponding to a certain practical task. However, the results obtained in these
papers and recommendations given cannot be used for blockchain-based voting
because of the following reasons:
– absence of a “trusted third party”;
– identification of a stakeholder offering a bribe is challenging due to blockchain
anonymity;
– inability to punish a stakeholder who is bribing because their identity is poten-
tially unknown.
The issues considered in this paper are very different from the above ones
as they are related to a completely new model of Catalyst voting developed
specially for Cardano. We take into account Catalyst delegate selection scheme,
procedure of voting for proposals and stake distribution among voters. So, the
results obtained are original and valuable.
2 Preliminaries
There are the following types of participants with specific goals (regarding honest
players) in the system:
– proposers submit proposals and aim to receive funding for their projects;
– stakeholders (aka voters) can either vote for proposals by themselves or dele-
gate this job to delegates (in order for stakeholder to take part in the voting
process, their stake must be greater than a given threshold, that is necessary for
protection from DoS attacks; the specific value of this threshold is not signif-
icant for further analysis); stakeholders are interested in competent decision-
making regarding funding (that increases the overall cryptocurrency value and
hence the value of their stakes) and rewarding for voting (delegation);
– delegates (aka representatives) are authorized to vote on behalf of stakehold-
ers and are interested in competent decision-making regarding funding and
rewarding for voting.
278 L. Kovalchuk et al.
– experts evaluate proposals and give constructive feedback receiving appropri-
ate rewards for doing this work.

3 Delegation Scheme
A delegation process consists of the following steps.
1. Stakeholders and delegates are registered on a blockchain:
– each delegate Di makes an escrow e on registration;
– decision-making process is supported by experts using their separate plat-
form (currently it is IdeaScale [2]).
A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives 279
2. Stakeholders and delegates vote on proposals:
– to be rewarded, a delegate Di must vote (Yes/No) not less than on a fixed
number of proposals and write a rationale for each voted proposal on a
public resource with its address provided to stakeholders;
– to be rewarded, a stakeholder Vi must do one of the following:
• vote (Yes/No) not less than on a fixed number of proposals;
• delegate their voting power to a delegate who must vote not less than
on a fixed number of proposals;
– the current treasury protocol allows parallel voting providing ballot pri-
vacy both for stakeholders and delegates.
3. Rewards are paid to stakeholders (rv
j ) and eligible delegates (ri):
– a short-term delegate’s reward rs
i is paid immediately after the voting;
– a long-term delegate’s reward rl
i is accumulated and paid at the end of k
funds (e.g., 2 years);
– undistributed delegates’ rewards are sent back to further funds.
4. If a delegate sends no ballot (covering necessary amount of proposals) or gets
no delegation, he gets no reward and a fine (voting liveness protection):
– no delegation at all: amount of A0 of his escrow e is burnt;
– having delegated less than δ (i.e., 1% of the total stake) tokens and no
ballot: amount of A1 of his escrow e is burnt;
– having delegated at least δ tokens and no ballot: amount of A2 delegate’s
escrow e (100%) is burnt.
3.1 Calculation of a Delegate’s Total Reward
To define the value of a bribe that may be interesting for some delegate Di, we
first should define the total reward of Di that he will lose if the fact of bribery
is detected. We assume the following.
– Di loses at least short-term rewards for the nearest k rounds of voting and
one long-term reward, assuming that the long-term reward is paid after every
k rounds of voting.
– The value of money that Di gets now is more valuable than the same value
of money that will be received later, with some coefficient t ∈ (0, 1). More
precisely, if Di gets a short-term reward rs
i in every voting round, then the
value in the nearest voting round is rs
i , in the next voting round this value is
trs
i , then t2rs
i , t3rs
i etc., respectively.
Then the total reward, Ri, for the i-th delegate (Di) for the whole “cycle” (k
voting rounds or the number of rounds between long-term rewards) is:
Ri = rs
i + trs
i + ... + tk−1rs
i + tk−1rl
ik = rs
i
1−tk
1−t + tk−1rl
ik
= αRsi
1−tk
1−t + tk−1(1 − α)Rsik = Rsi
(
α 1−tk
1−t + k(1 − α)tk−1
)
.
(1)
The value of t may be taken, in particular, based on deposit interest. For
example, if there are 3 months between funds, and the annual interest is 4%,
280 L. Kovalchuk et al.
then for every 3rd month the interest is 1%, so t ≈ 0.99 or so. In this case, and
if, for example, k = 8, we get the value of the total reward as
Ri = Rsi
(
α
1 − 0.998
0.01
+ 8 · (1 − α) · 0.99
7
)
= Rsi
(
7.73α + 7.46 · (1 − α)
)
= Rsi(0.27α + 7.46).
4 Bribery Scenario in Pure Strategies
A bribery scenario in pure strategies can be modeled as an asymmetric sequential
game among delegates and proposers. Each proposer may play two strategies:
– (B1) – does not propose a bribe for voting in his interest;
– (B2) – proposes a bribe for voting.
Each delegate may also play two strategies:
– (S1) – refuses to take a bribe;
– (S2) – is waiting for a bribe (after that he votes as a briber wants).
If a proposer plays (B1), i.e., does not try to bribe a delegate Di, then Di
gets a payoff Ri – a total reward (1) for participation in k sequential votings,
taking into account the fact that different parts of the total reward are paid in
different times. But in the case if the delegate was waiting for a bribe, i.e. plays
(S2), he also has some moral suffering κi that his expectations were not met.
Then the payoff of Di is:
ui(B1, S1) = Ri − kei, (2)
ui(B1, S2) = Ri − kei − Ki, (3)
where ei are efforts paid by Di for one voting.
We also assume that a proposer receives some fixed v that may be considered
as the average funding he gets in k funds (we do not care about this value and
may assume v = 0):
uP (B1, ·) = v. (4)
If a proposer plays (B2), a delegate may play two strategies, and his payoff
is:
ui(B2, S1) = Ri − kei + Ki; (5)
ui(B2, S2) = Ci + (1 − q)Ri − Ki, (6)
where all notations were introduced in Notations (Sect. 2).
The payoff of the proposer who plays (B2) is:
uP (B2, S1) = −Ki; (7)
uP (B2, S2) = F − Ki − Ci, (8)
A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives 281
where F = 0 iff a stake ratio si that briber managed to bribe, is not sufficient
to win voting.
The corresponding payoff matrices of the game are:
Mi =
(B1) (B2)( )
(S1) Ri − kei Ri − kei + Ki
(S2) Ri − kei − Ki Ci + (1 − q)Ri − Ki
(9)
payoff for delegate Di; and
MP =
(S1) (S2)( )
(B1) v v
(B2) −Ki F − Ki − Ci
(10)
payoff for proposer.
Note that for case of rational players, we assume κ = 0, hence Ki = 0. From
(9) and (10) we get the following trivial Proposition.
Proposition 1 (Nash equilibrium in pure strategies). The conditions for
a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies are the following.
1. The point (B1, S1) is always a Nash equilibrium.
2. The point (B2, S2) is a Nash equilibrium iff{
F − Ki − Ci > v;
Ci + (1 − q)Ri − Ki > Ri − kei + Ki.
3. The point (B1, S2) is a Nash equilibrium iff
{
Ki = 0;
F − Ci < v.
4. The point (B2, S1) is a Nash equilibrium iff
{
Ki = v = 0;
qRi ≥ Ci + kei − 2Ki.
Note that the described voting system is vulnerable to bribery only in the case
when (B2, S2) is a Nash equilibrium, because in three other points no bribery
occurs. Using Proposition 1 and (1), we can formulate the following Corollary.
Corollary 1. The necessary condition to have a Nash equilibrium (in pure
strategies) in the point (B2, S2) is:
F > v + Ki + Ci > v + Ki + (Ri − kei + Ki − (1 − q)Ri + Ki)
= v + si
(
3κ + qR
(
α 1−tk
1−t + k(1 − α)tk−1
)
− kei
)
or
si <
F + kei − v
3κ + qR
(
α 1−tk
1−t + k(1 − α)tk−1
) .
282 L. Kovalchuk et al.
In other words, the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium in (B2, S2) is
that the stake that a briber needs to buy to win the voting is not larger than
the right part of the equality.
For example, if F = $1, 000, 000; k = 8; α = 0.15; v = $50, 000; κ = 0;
ei = $2250; q = 0.96; t = 0.99; R = $360, 000 we get:
si <
$1, 000, 000 + 8 · $2250 − $50, 000
0.96 · $360, 000 ·
(
0.15 · 1−0.998
0.01 + 8 · 0.85 · 0.997
) ⇐⇒ si < 0.374.
Note 1. According to (7) and (8), to get some profit from bribery, a proposer
should bribe some amount of stake, say not less than s, to win voting. As in our
model, a bribe is proportional to the amount of stake bribed, the optimal case
for him is to bribe delegates Di1, ...,Dik such that:
(i1, ..., ik) = arg min
j1,...,jl
{
l∑
t=1
sjt ≥ s
}
.
5 Bribery Scenario in Mixed Strategies
We consider two models for two different types of players behavior: rational
players and emotional players. Rational players are interested only in increasing
their profit or income and do not pay attention to how moral or how honest their
actions are. Emotional players may also try to increase their income in some
malicious way, but they feel shame if they do this. And vise versa: they may be
proud of themselves if they find strength to resist some profitable proposition
that may increase their income. In the model with emotional players, we consider
that both sides of the game, the delegate and the proposer, are emotional. And
so called “moral price” for them is proportional (with some coefficient κ) to the
delegated stake ratio that corresponds to the delegate that briber (proposer) is
trying to bribe.
In this chapter we first prove some general statements for two-player game
that later we use to obtain results for these two models.
For simplicity, we define elements of the matrices Mi and MP as:
Mi =
(
d11 d12
d21 d22
)
; MP =
(
b11 b12
b21 b22
)
. (11)
For describing a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, we need two auxiliary
lemmas.
Lemma 1. Let a, b ∈ R, a + b �= 0. Define p = a
a+b . Then p ∈ [0, 1] ⇐⇒⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
a + b �= 0;[
ab ≥ 0;
ab ≤ 0.
A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives 283
Proof. Let us consider four cases for a and b.
Case 1: a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, a + b �= 0.
In this case 0 ≤ a ≤ a + b holds that is equivalent to 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.
Case 2: a ≤ 0, b ≤ 0, a + b �= 0.
Define a = −a1, b = −b1. Then p = −a1
−a1−b1
= a1
a1+b1
, when a1 ≥ 0, b1 ≥ 0,
a1 + b1 �= 0 and, according to Case 1, we get 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.
Case 3: a > 0, b ≤ 0, a + b �= 0.
In this case a + b < a and p < 0 (if a + b < 0) or p > 1 (if a + b > 0).
Case 4: a < 0, b ≥ 0, a + b �= 0.
In this case p < 0 if b + a > 0 (or b > −a), or p = −a
−(b+a) = −a
−a−b > 1 if
b < −a.
In what follows, we will consider mixed strategies μ1 = (p1, 1 − p1) for the
Delegate and μ2 = (p2, 1 − p2) for the Briber. For simplicity, we say “point
(p1, p2)” instead of “point (μ1, μ2)”.
Lemma 2. Let payoff matrices Mi and MP be as in (11). Then:

There are no other Nash equilibria in mixed strategies.
Proof. In our notations,
ui(p1, p2) = d11p1p2 + d12p1(1 − p2) + d21(1 − p1)p2 + d22(1 − p1)(1 − p2).
Then, from equality
ui(0, p2) = ui(1, p2)
we get
(d21 − d11 − d22 + d12)p2 = d12 − d22. (16)
Case 1:

d21 − d11 − d22 + d12 = 0.
In this case (16) has no solutions.
Case 2:

or

In this case any p2 ∈ [0, 1] is a solution of (16).

In this case (13) has only one solution
p2 =

Applying the same considerations to the equality
uB(p1, 0) = uB(p1, 1),
we complete the proof.
5.1 Model 1: Rational Players
In this subsection the first model with rational players is considered.
Proposition 2. For Model 1 (with rational players) the conditions for a Nash
equilibrium in mixed strategies are:
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (p1, p2) for arbitrary p1, p2 ∈ [0, 1] iff
{
qRi = F − kei;
F = Ci.
(17)
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (p1, 1) for arbitrary p1 ∈ [0, 1] iff
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
qRi �= Ci + kei;

(18)
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (1, p2) for arbitrary p1 ∈ [0, 1] iff
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
qRi = Ci + kei;
v = 0;
F < Ci.
(19)
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (F−Ci−v
F−Ci
, p2) for arbitrary p2 ∈ [0, 1] iff
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
qRi = Ci + kei;
0 < v ≤ F − Ci;
F > Ci.
(20)
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (1, 1) iff
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
qRi �= Ci + kei;
v = 0;
F < Ci.
(21)
– a Nash equilibrium in the point (F−Ci−v
F−Ci
, 1) iff
{
qRi �= Ci + kei;
0 < v ≤ F − Ci.
(22)
286 L. Kovalchuk et al.
There are no others Nash equilibria in mixed strategies.
Proof. For Model 1 we can rewrite (12) as⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
Ri − kei − (Ri − kei) − (Ci + (1 − q)Ri + (Ri − kei) = 0;
Ri − kei = Ci + (1 − q)Ri;

v = F − Ci
that is equivalent to
{
Ri − kei = Ci + (1 − q)Ri;
F = Ci
or
{
qRi = Ci + kei;
F = Ci.
Next, (13) can be rewritten as⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨

5.2 Model 2: Emotional Players
For Model 2 (with emotional players) we can formulate the following proposition.
Proposition 3. There exists only one Nash equilibrium in the mixed strategies
for Model 2 iff: ⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
0 ≤ v ≤ F − Ci − Ki;
(1 − q)Ri �= Ki − Ci − kei;
qRi ≤ Ci + kei − 2Ki.
(23)
Under the condition (23) the point (p1, p2) is a Nash equilibrium, where
p1 = 1 − Ki + v
F − Ci
; p2 = 1 − Ki
Ci + kei − Ki − qRi
.
Proof. 1. For this Model we can rewrite the first equality in (12) as
(Ri − kei − Ki) − (Ri − kei) = 0,
that does not hold because in this Model Ki �= 0.
Then there are no conditions for a Nash equilibrium in (p1, p2) for arbitrary
p1, p2 ∈ [0, 1].
2. Next, in conditions (13) the second equality can be rewritten as
−Ki = v,
that does not hold as v ≥ 0, Ki > 0.
3. The second condition in (14) can be rewritten as
Ri − kei − Ki = Ri − kei + Ki,
that does not hold as Ki > 0.
4. The condition (15) can be rewritten as
⎧

(Ri − kei − Ki) − (Ri − kei) ≤ 0

⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
F �= Ci;
v ≤ F − Ci − Ki;
−Ci − (1 − q)Ri + Ki − kei �= 0;
Ri − kei + Ki ≤ Ci + (1 − q)Ri − Ki

⎪⎪⎪⎩
F �= Ci;

⎪⎩
v ≤ F − Ci − Ki;
(1 − q)Ri �= Ki − Ci − kei;
qRi ≤ Ci + kei − 2Ki.
In this case
p1 =

v − (F − Ci − Ki) − Ki − v
=
F − Ci − Ki − v
F − Ci

5.3 Sufficient Conditions for a Nash Equilibrium in Terms
of a Delegated Stake Ratio
Here we formulate the condition for a Nash equilibrium in terms of a stake ratio
that a proposer needs to buy to be guaranteed to win the voting. First, we
formulate some general sufficient conditions based on results from 2.4, 2.5.1 and
2.5.2.
Proposition 4. Let condition
{
qRi > Ci + kei − 2Ki;
F < Ci
(24)
hold. Then:
1. if Ki = 0 then:
– (B1, S1) is a Nash equilibrium;
– (B2, S2) is not a Nash equilibrium;
– there are no Nash equilibria in mixed strategies;
2. if Ki �= 0 then the only Nash equilibrium in both pure and mixed strategies is
(B1, S1).
290 L. Kovalchuk et al.
Proof. 1. Let Ki = 0. From Proposition 1 it is easy to see that (B1, S1) is a Nash
equilibrium and (B2, S2) is not due to the condition F < Ci from (24) that
contradicts the first condition F −Ki −Ci > v > 0 from p.2 of Proposition 1.
Next, this condition also contradicts (17), (18), (20) and (22) in Proposition
2.
The condition qRi > ci + kei − 2Ki from (24) contradicts (19) in Proposition
2. And note that the condition (24) entails the fulfillment of the condition
(21) in Proposition 2 that means (B1, S1) is a Nash equilibrium.
2. Let Ki �= 0. Then from Proposition 1 we again see that (B1, S1) is a Nash
equilibrium, and there are no other Nash equilibria in pure strategies.
From Proposition 3 we also see that there are no Nash equilibria in mixed
strategies, because the first inequality in (24) contradicts the third inequality
in (23).
In our notations we may rewrite (24) as
⎧⎨
⎩
si > kei
qR(α· 1−tk
1−t +k(1−α)tk−1)−c+2κ
;
si > F
c
or
si > max
{
kei
qR(α · 1−tk
1−t + k(1 − α)tk−1) − c + 2κ
,
F
c
}
. (25)
In other words, the condition (25) is sufficient to have a Nash equilibrium
only in (B1, S1) and not to have it in (B2, S2) and in the mixed strategies.
6 Numerical Results
Using the formula from Corollary 1, we calculated the values of the maximum
stake share that is necessary for the briber to win voting, under which a bribery
is still profitable for them, for the following parameters:
– the total treasury fund for one voting round Θ = $8, 000, 000;
– the profit that a proposer gets from bribing F = $1, 000, 000;
– the number of voting rounds in one cycle: k = 5, ..., 10 for Fig. 1 and k ∈ [4; 35]
for Fig. 2;
– the share of short-term reward α = 0.15;
– the proposer’s average profit in the case of no bribery v = $50, 000;
– the moral price κ = 0;
– the effort spent for voting on all proposals in one voting round, i.e. one Cat-
alyst Fund, ei = $2250;
– the probability of bribery detection q = 0.96;
– the value of a delegate’s reward t = 0.99;
– the total reward for delegates per one voting round: R ∈ [$136, 000;
$1, 600, 000] for Fig. 1 and R = $360, 000 for Fig. 2.
A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Delegation Incentives 291
The obtained results are summarized in Figs. 1–2.
Fig. 1. Dependency of the maximum stake share that is necessary for the briber to
win voting, under which a bribery is still profitable for them, on R, the total reward
for delegates per voting round (for different k)
Fig. 2. Dependency of the maximum stake share that is necessary for the briber to win
voting, under which a bribery is still profitable for them, on k, the number of voting
rounds in one cycle
Let us look at the Fig. 1 and the curve for k = 8 (the green one). For R =
$440, 000, a Nash equilibrium in the point (B2, S2) will exist only if the delegates’
292 L. Kovalchuk et al.
stake share that a briber needs to buy to win voting is not larger than 0.3057.
That means spending the amount of R = $440, 000 for the total delegates’
reward, we will provide protection of the delegation scheme against a bribery
involving buying more than 30% of delegates’ stake.
7 Conclusions
In this paper we present the mathematical model that fully describes the vote
delegation incentive process for decentralized governance system for funding dis-
tribution that uses a blockchain-based voting. Two models of bribing a delegate
by a proposer submitting proposals for funding are considered: “Rational Dele-
gates” and “Emotional Delegates”.
In terms of parameters describing the voting process, it is stipulated that the
sufficient condition that a Nash equilibrium exists only if both a proposer and a
delegate do not intend to participate in bribery, and it is shown at what stake
share owned by a briber this condition is satisfied. The main practical result of
the paper is the possibility to define what kind of an attacker (in terms of the
bribing capability) we will be able to resist under certain parameters.
