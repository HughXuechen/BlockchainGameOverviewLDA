Abstract. Algorithm is the cornerstone of blockchain application. Blockchain
makes the trust relationship of human society based on algorithm rationality and
has the advantages of abstraction, time dimension and point-to-point, which
gradually changes the production relationship and affects all aspects of eco-
nomic society. In the field of finance, blockchain will change the power contrast,
transparency and supervision mode of financial game, which will make great
changes in the financial industry. To grasp the essence of blockchain algorithm
rationality is the key point to understand and deal with financial reform.

1 Algorithmic Rationality: The Essence of Blockchain Trust
Mechanism
In psychology, trust is a kind of stable belief, which maintains the shared value and
stability of the society. It is an individual & apos;s discourse, commitment and state-
ment to others Trustworthy overall expectations. In management, trust refers to the
belief that the trustor has given up the ability to supervise and control the trusted party,
preferring to expose his weakness and be in a risk environment, and that the other party
will not harm his own interests. Trust plays a very important role in the traditional
economic society [1–3], but with the improvement of information technology and the
arrival of digital economyCome on, the cost of “trust” is getting higher and higher. As
Charlie manger said, “a better system is a seamless, non bureaucratic network of trust.
There are not too many bizarre procedures, only a group of reliable people who have
the right trust with each other. In the Internet economy [4, 5], third party Technology
Trust has been adopted, such as Alipay has solved the problem of mutual trust in online
transactions [6, 7], so it is considered to be the main factor of Taobao&apos;s success,
but its application scope is limited to transactions on the platform, and the third party
becomes the data [8, 9].

2 Advantages of Algorithm Rationality
Algorithmic rationality, with the application of mathematical “axiomatization” and
“Self Justification without proof”, can obtain the greatest degree of recognition of
human society, that is, “consensus”. Consensus is a collection of trust, which can
change the rules of social and economic operation.
(1) Abstraction
The advantage of abstraction is that it can span the physical world and the digital world
and provide trust mechanism. The digital economy is characterized by the emergence
of two parallel fields: the physical world and the digital world, which are linked
through intelligent devices. The physical world and the digital world are mapping each
other more and more. The video, audio, text and pictures produced in the physical
world are recorded by electronic devices. No matter what format and content of
electronic files, they are 0,1 combined sequences at the bottom of the computer, but the
magnitude is different. They can be realized by AI algorithmNow its data value is
realized; and through encryption algorithm, such as the current stable hash algorithm
sha256, we can obtain the unique characteristic value - “digital fingerprint” of 64
numbers. Based on this basic law, asymmetric encryption technology, zero knowledge
proof technology and so on are produced, and the results of these abstract operations
affect the physical world. In other words, this kind of operation mechanism transforms
all kinds of human activities into codes, and then into mathematical languages.
Through stable, safe and reliable mathematical algorithms, the results are mapped to the
code layer, and then affect the physical world.
(2) Time series
The one-way and irreversible feature of time ensures that there is no duplicate record
(reverse) of transactions. Therefore, there is no difference between copies and originals
in the blockchain. All documents are the only originals, because time cannot appear
twice.Blockchain uses a lot of time stamp technology in business applications, that is,
the time value collected on the authoritative time service platform is written into the
block, the data block is labeled with time, and the “data + time” is broadcast to the
whole network to make the whole network synchronous. The data block records the
hash value of the previous block through the block header along the time axis, so that
all blocks are concatenated, which can not be tampered with. As shown in Fig. 1.
(3) Third party risk prevention
The trusted third party deals with electronic payment information, which is inherently
subject to the weakness of “trust based model”. The credit based mode inevitably has a
certain proportion of fraudulent customers. Compared with offline cash (physical cash)
transaction, this transaction mode has a relatively weak function in preventing fraud.
Therefore, it is necessary to create a more reliable online electronic payment system.
The blockchain trust mechanism shut down the entrance of artificial evil from the third
party, so as to minimize the possibility of human intervention and thus the possibility
of evil.

3 The Influence of Algorithmic Rationality on Financial
Game Rules
The Chinese government has repeatedly stressed the importance of growing and
strengthening the digital economy. On May 21, 2018, the China Banking and Insurance
Regulatory Commission issued the guidance on data governance of financial institu-
tions in the banking industry, which clearly defined the principle of full coverage of
data governance. For the first time, it proposed the concepts and guidance of data-
driven and data value realization, which fundamentally laid the tone for the transfor-
mation of financial institutions in the banking industry. At present, many commercial
banks have clearly put forward the strategy of benchmarking to fintech companies,
blockchain As a big data technology, it will directly or indirectly have a profound
impact on the financial business.
(1) Changing the power contrast in the traditional financial game
The trust of the other side of the game exists the problems of information asymmetry
and power contrast between the two sides of the transaction. For this reason, financial
regulators take information disclosure and consumer protection as their own duty to
check and balance these asymmetric and mismatched states. The emergence of algo-
rithmic rationality has changed the unbalanced status of the game brought about by
partial information asymmetry in the way of distributed general ledger. The party in
disadvantageous information can prevent the other party from doing evil to the greatest
extent through various algorithms. Therefore, its risk control ability has been increased,
the cost of adjusting as much as possible has been greatly reduced, and the risk pricing
is more accurate.
1) Information synchronization
Changing transaction information asymmetry, supply is the typical one Chain finance
and asset securitization. In the traditional supply chain finance and asset securitization
products, from KYC to credit audit, a lot of reconciliation and audit work is to judge
the accuracy of customer information, which costs a high cost of financial institutions,
and is afterwards data. The emergence of big data technology has greatly promoted the
operation efficiency of this process. Blockchain is the improvement of big data tech-
nology. It transforms big data into trusted data through distributed general ledger
technology, and solves the underlying asset quality problem from the architecture
(mainly alliance chain). Specifically, it is to form a trusted alliance ecosystem between
upstream and downstream enterprises. As an important part of the ecosystem, financial
institutions participate in the whole process, and multi-party information is syn-
chronous and tamper proof, which fundamentally solves the problem of information
authenticity.
2) Automatic trading
Smart contract with tamper proof contract mode and automatic execution from another
On the one hand, it balances the equal control status of both sides of the game, that is,
the status of both sides of the game does not change before and after capital payment or
product (service) delivery. In the supply chain finance with smart contracts, some
1072 L. Qiang and Y. Zhang
transactions maintain the value flow between upstream and downstream enterprises
through smart contracts, namely Through the automatic execution of smart contract, the
problem of “triangle debt” and “multi corner debt” is greatly reduced without any
artificial change.
(2) To change the reasonable black box rule in the financial game
The banking industry is called the indirect financial institution because the bank has the
power Separating the source of funds and the user of funds, the link between them is a
reasonable and legal black box, and insurance institutions are similar operations. The
reason why this reasonable black box rule has not been questioned is that financial
institutions are generally trusted by the public based on expert system and the game of
“big but not down”. In the era of Internet finance, P2P in form can be achieved, but
there are still black boxes in operation, and capital pool cannot be avoided.
1) Open source information
Open source includes the real-time recording and sharing of information on the
blockchain Show. In the distributed business model, there is no centralized credit
intermediary, all transaction information is open-source, that is, all participants are
given the right to know, that is, the black box is completely opened, all revenue and
expenditure, capital flow are open, and P2P is really achieved. For example, blockchain
mutual insurance institutions publicize each received medical mutual aid fund for
serious illness in blockchain. After the accident, the claims are shared equally from all
accounts or according to certain rules. All revenues and expenditures are recorded on
the blockchain. All participants can supervise and review all transactions in real time,
making the black box become a transparent box.
2) Economic model open source
Breaking the black box not only depends on information open source, but more
importantly, will operate The economic model, that is, the rights and obligations of all
parties involved and their corresponding relations are open in a public chain with
global consensus. For example, in Ethereum, the economic model is embedded in the
public chain or baas layer through the way of smart contract, which cannot be tampered
with and can be automatically executed to ensure the stable rights and obligations of all
parties involved in the transaction.
(3) Changing the rules of cat and mouse game
The lag problem can be improved by the way of blockchain, which can partially
change the dilemma of on-site supervision, and conduct real-time, efficient and low
cost local penetration supervision.
1) Zero knowledge proof
Financial institutions deposit certificates through blockchain and broadcast the hash
value to the nodes of regulators in real time. At the same time of isolating trade secrets,
the method of zero knowledge proof is used to achieve automatic compliance. If the
bank opens an account with a customer KYC records the whole process and records it
Block Chain Algorithm Rationality 1073
in the blockchain, so that the evidence can be solidified. When there is a consumption
dispute, the bank can prove that it has not tampered with the original record at any time.
2) Fund traces
The “copy” function of the Internet is powerful. Due to the existence of timestamps, the
“copy” is removed from the blockchain. At the same time, each transaction is truthfully
recorded through the distributed GL Book technology. In March 2018, the Central
Bank of China released the digital application mode of RMB, which is neither
decentralized nor disintermediated. By using block chain encryption algorithm, the
transfer of funds can be traced accurately. At present, it has been tested on the digital
bill trading platform. Different from bitcoin, this centralized digital legal currency
reduces the audit link, and more is used in the areas where fund flow information needs
to be highly disclosed and supervised, such as targeted poverty alleviation, crowd-
funding, charity, mutual aid, etc.
(4) Change the pattern of financial game
With the influx of financial technology companies, the territory of finance has been
broken, and more and more funds are provided. Therefore, financial institutions have
set up technology companies to compete with them, such as Ping&apos;an technology
of Ping&apos;an group, Jianxin financial technology of China Construction Bank, etc.
Joining the competition of science and technology is the first stage of the change of
financial game. The regulatory agencies put forward that the full coverage of big data
governance is a typical sign of this stage, which officially opened the era of digital
finance.
4 Conclusion
Although blockchain has been popular in recent two years, at present, the prudent style
and strong centralized trust background of financial institutions make the improvement
of blockchain on financial process not bring the commercial effect matching the
popularity. However, the trust based on algorithmic rational support of blockchain is
bound to have the feature of “disintermediation”. As a result, the rules of financial game
have changed. Financial institutions have to reduce the intermediary business and
introduce more financial science and technology service functions, and the financial
science and technology service functions must also be iterated rapidly, which has
become an important factor in the construction of social and economic ecology. In this
process, algorithmic rationality is not only the technical essence of blockchain, but also
runs through the whole process, providing guidance for the development of digital
finance of financial institutions.
