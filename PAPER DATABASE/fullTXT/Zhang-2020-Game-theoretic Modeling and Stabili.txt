Abstract—The emergence of channel technology reduces the 
transaction verification time of blockchains. A channel with a 
stable state is helpful for completing transactions successfully. 
Under the assumption of node bounded rationality and 
replication dynamics of an evolutionary process, this paper 
presents a dynamic evolutionary game model based on node 
behaviors in blockchain channels. The model considers the cost 
of attack, attack success rate, defense, cooperation, and non-
cooperation strategies during the game process. The defense 
strategy can help nodes resist different attacks. Nodes can 
dynamically adjust their own strategies according to different 
behaviors of attackers to achieve effective defense. The 
experimental results show that the proposed method is better 
than a lightning network channel in terms of transaction success 
ratio.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A large number of transactions can be transferred through 
blockchain channels, and ultimately net profit is settled on the 
blockchain to reduce the delay of transaction confirmation [1]. 
Blockchain channels can be linked together to form a channel 
network. Transactions between both parties can usually be 
transmitted through a channel. However, attackers can launch 
attacks on a channel, such as a routing attack [2]. In addition, 
nodes in a channel may also become the target of attacks and 
be captured by attackers. Internal nodes may launch attacks 
from the inside of channels, which is called as internal attacks. 
These attacks may seriously affect the performance of a 
channel and even cause it to be paralyzed. Therefore, 
effectively preventing attack behaviors of internal nodes can 
improve the stability and security of a channel. It also helps 
transactions in the channel complete this work quickly and 
successfully. Based on profits of nodes and evolutionary game 
theory [3], this work proposes a model to analyze evolutionary 
game states in blockchain channels, with a goal to effectively 
improve its stability and security.

II. RELATED WORK 
Blockchain channels enable a large number of transactions 
to be conducted off the blockchain and reduce the dependence 
of transactions on a blockchain. The existing channels are 
mainly divided into two categories: payment and state channels 
[4]. Each channel has its respective transaction type. 
1. Payment channels: They include lightning network and 
duplex micropayment channels [5][6]. Their purpose is to 
establish direct point-to-point payment, allowing both parties 
to maintain and update account book privately. Not each 
transaction needs to be written to blockchain, and legal funds 
can be withdrawn at any time. Payment channel's use can 
greatly shorten transaction time and save transaction cost. A 
lightning network is the first one to form a payment network 
through a payment channel. Through a two-way payment 
channel, transfer between any two nodes can be realized to 
improve transaction throughput of blockchain. Duplex micro 
payment channels can realize high scalability for payment 
based on bitcoin and improve security of transmission. 
2. State channels: Different from payment channels, state 
channels not only support off-chain payments among parties, 
but also allow execution of arbitrarily complex smart contracts. 
The representative ones are Sprites and Revive channels [7][8]. 
Sprites channel solves the problem of high time cost when 
cross channel payment is not successful. It enables transaction 
participants to transfer balance between payment channels 
safely. However, only honest participants lose no funds in the 
process of rebalancing channel funds, but malicious behavior 
of dishonest participants is not considered. 
However, the number of interconnected nodes in a channel 
may reach a large number. Therefore, it is necessary to find a 
transaction path that enables stable and fast transactions. The 
existing channel path selection methods such as Flare [9] and 
Landmark Routing [10] need nodes to obtain all the 
information of a routing process. Regardless of nodes in a 
channel in the case of dynamic joining or exiting, if all nodes 
are willing to cooperate, a payment path can be found through 
a routing algorithm. In practical applications, a channel has the

risk of being attacked [11], which can especially be high when 
attacks are initiated from nodes inside channels. Internal 
attacks may severely affect the performance of a channel and 
even paralyze it. It is more difficult to prevent internal attacks 
than external ones. Traditional signature verification [12] faces 
a problem of invalidation with internal attacks. Hence, to keep 
blockchain channels in a good and stable state of cooperation, 
it is necessary to analyze the stability and security of channels 
under internal attacks. In order to solve the above problems, we 
propose a dynamic evolutionary game model of blockchain 
channels. The paper has the following contributions: 
1. In order to improve stability and security of blockchain 
channels, a dynamic evolutionary game model is proposed 
based on node behaviors. The model considers the cost of 
attack and attack success rate in the case of deploying a 
defense strategy. It allows nodes to resist attack behaviors at a 
certain ratio and decrease non-cooperation behaviors. 
2. Based on the model, an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) 
is derived. Nodes in blockchain channels adopt their own 
strategies according to ESS. They can continuously adjust their 
strategies based on their current profit situations to reach a 
stable state in blockchain channels. 
III. PROPOSED EVOLUTIONARY GAME MODEL 
A. Preliminaries 
The relevant settings of a blockchain channel are as follows： 
1. Node behaviors: There are cooperation, non-cooperation, 
defense, and attack behaviors of a node. a) Cooperation: A 
node agrees on forwarding a transaction. b) Non-cooperation: 
A node refuses to forward a transaction. c) Attack: A node 
launches attacks, such as network topology attack [13][14][15] 
and denial-of-service attack[16][17]. d) Defense: A node 
defends against attacks from other nodes, such as analyzing 
node attacks [18], and building a blacklist of malicious nodes. 
2. Nodes are classified into two types: type-I and type-II 
according to whether they have attack behaviors or not. Type-I 
nodes have defensive behaviors in channels; while Type-II 
nodes have attack behaviors. Note that all nodes have 
cooperation and non-cooperation behaviors.  
3. All irrational nodes, which carry out blind attacks for 
their own profits at all cost, are filtered out according to the 
method in [19]. All nodes have bounded rationality [20][21]. 
It means that nodes only know part of the game state of the 
whole network. Bounded rationality enables type-I and type-II 
nodes to make decisions and constantly adjust strategies 
according to their current profit status.  
B. A Game Model 
To construct an evolutionary game model of blockchain 
channels, three basic elements need to be considered. 
1. Participants 
Participants of a game are composed of type-I and type-II 
nodes. The former’s profits come from forwarding 
transactions, while the latter’s profits come from launching 
attacks or forwarding transactions. 
2. Strategy space 
Let Γ denote the set of strategies adopted by nodes: Γ = 
{cooperation, non-cooperation, attack, defense}, where a 
cooperation strategy denotes that nodes agree on forwarding 
transactions; a non-cooperation strategy denotes that nodes 
may refuse to forward transactions; an attack strategy denotes 
that nodes may perform malicious non-cooperation or attack 
to obtain profits; and a defense strategy denotes that nodes 
may defend against malicious non-cooperation or attacks.  
Based on Γ, the strategy space of type-I and type-II nodes is 
obtained according to their definitions, respectively: 
S1={cooperation, non-cooperation, defense}        (1) 
S2={cooperation, attack, non-cooperation}         (2) 
3. Profit matrix 
a) Parameter definition 
According to characteristics of blockchain channels, related 
parameters are defined as follows: 
R represents profits obtained by each node of both parties in 
a game by successfully forwarding a transaction. CD is the cost 
required if a type-I node adopts a defense strategy. RA 
represents profits obtained by a type-II node that successfully 
performs an attack. CA refers to the cost required by a type-II 
node that carries out an attack. It can be the consumed funds 
with an attack or relevant legal sanction if the attack is 
identified by other nodes. CR represents the cost required if a 
node performs a transaction. It can be the consumption of 
funds. L represents the loss of a type-I node under an attack. P 
is the attack success rate of a type-II node that attacks a type-I 
node adopting a defense strategy. 
From [22], profits of nodes are required to be greater than 
cost. Hence, the following conditions must be met: 
R > RA                                    (3)  
R > CD > CA                                (4) 
R > CR > CA                                (5) 
b) Maximizing profits 
The premise of an evolutionary game [23][24][25] is that 
each participant in a game exhibits bounded rationality at a 
decision-making stage, i.e., participants make strategic choices 
in order to maximize their own profits. The selfishness or 
altruism of participants with bounded rationality can 
maximize the profits of both parties in a game [26].  
c) Profit analysis and profit matrix 
The profit matrices of type-I and type-II nodes are given in 
Tables I and II. To maximize profits for nodes, we require that 
R − CD – P × L ≥ 0, i.e., 
R ≥ CD + P × L                            (6)

From Tables I and II, we know that strategy spaces of both 
types-I and type-II nodes consist of three strategies. Hence, a 
profit matrix with size of 3 × 3 is constructed for each party. 
The profit matrix of a type-I node is denoted as A = [aij]3×3, 
and that of a type-II node is denoted as B = [bij]3×3, where i 
and j denote the i-th and j-th strategy, respectively. For A, 
strategies 1-3 correspond to cooperation, non-cooperation, and 
defense. For B, they correspond to cooperation, attack, and 
non-cooperation. aij represents profits of a type-I node 
adopting strategy i while a type-II node adopting strategy j. bij 
represents the profit of a type-II node adopting strategy j while 
a type-I node adopting strategy i.

C. A Dynamic Evolutionary Game Model 
In order to better describe a dynamic evolution process, we 
use the concept of evolutionary equilibrium [27] to unify the 
ESS concept and dynamic process in evolutionary game theory.  
1) Ratios of type-I nodes adopting different strategies 
Let Ni be the number of type-I nodes adopting the i-th 
strategy at time t. M' denotes the total number of type-I nodes. 
M' = N1 + N2 + N3 and 0 ≤ Ni ≤ M'. Let xi be the ratio of 
type-I nodes adopting the i-th strategy at time t: 
xi = Ni / M'                                      (9)

defense strategies, respectively. yi is similar to xi in terms of its 
definition. 
According to the replication dynamics theory of an 
evolutionary game and strategy ratios, replication dynamic 
equations of type-I and type-II nodes can be obtained:

blockchain channels. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS

The experiments use a 64-bit operating system of Windows 
8, including Intel Core i5 processor, CPU 2.80 GHz, and 8G 
memories. Simulator ONE is used to generate a random 
undirected topology graph with 1000 nodes. Two hundred 
type-II nodes are randomly selected from 1000 nodes. The 
entire simulation time is 40,000 seconds. We set P = 0.5, R=1, 
RA=0.8, CA=0.2, CD=0.3, CR=0.4, and L=1. 
Transaction success ratio (ρ): It denotes the ratio of 
transaction messages that are successfully sent to target nodes 
(i.e. transaction executor) among all messages, i.e., 
ρ = RM/TM                                             (17) 
where RM is the number of transaction messages successfully 
sent to a target node, and TM is the total number of transaction 
messages.  
1. An evolutionary game process of stability analysis 
In Fig. 1, an evolutionary game process is shown with three 
stages, namely the initial, middle, and end stages for a 
blockchain channel system. In the initial stage nodes take [(1/3, 
1/3, 1/3), (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)] as the initial strategy ratios. The 
channel system does not reach a stable state at time t=0, i.e., it 
does not converge to an ESS. In the middle stage, all nodes 
dynamically adjust their strategies to play the game. After 60 
seconds of the game, at the time of t = 60s, strategy ratios of 
nodes change into [(9/10, 0, 1/10), (1, 0, 0)]. The state of the 
system is not stable. Then it continues to play the game. In the 
end stage, after 110 seconds of the game, at the time of t = 
110s, strategy ratios of nodes change into [(1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0)], 
which is is stable.  
2. Transaction success ratio  
Let initial strategies of nodes be [(x
0 
1 , x
0 
2 , x
0 
3 ), (y
0 
1 , y
0 
2 , y
0 
3 )] = 
[(1/3, 1/3, 1/3), (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)].  Each node chooses three 
strategies in its own space evenly, avoiding the influence of 
different strategy proportions on the final results. The 
proposed method is compared with a popular blockchain 
channel: lightning network [29]. Transaction success ratio is 
shown in Fig. 2. In the lightning channels, due to the existence 
of type-II nodes and the lack of security measures, the non-
cooperation behavior causes its transaction success ratio to 
decrease. For the proposed model with a defense strategy, 
type-I nodes can resist different attack behaviors with a certain 
ratio to make the network reach a stable cooperative state. 
Therefore, its transaction success ratio increases. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The analysis of equilibrium stability of an evolutionary 
game is important. Stability is an important indicator of 
blockchain channels. According to characteristics of node 
behaviors in blockchain channels, profit matrices of nodes are 
designed. Based on them, a dynamic evolutionary game model 
is for the first time proposed for blockchain channels. The 
theoretical proof shows that the proposed model has stable 
states. The proposed method achieves better transaction 
success ratio than the existing popular method, i.e., lightning 
network. As future research work, we plan to design a
