Abstract: A blockchain, as a form of distributed ledger technology, represents the unanimity of
replication, synchronization, and sharing of data among various geographical sites. Blockchains
have demonstrated impressive and effective applications throughout many aspects of the business.
Blockchain technology can lead to the advent of the construction of Digital Twins (DTs). DTs involve
the real representation of physical devices digitally as a virtual representation of both elements and
dynamics prior to the building and deployment of actual devices. DT products can be built using
blockchain-based technology in order to achieve sustainability. The technology of DT is one of the
emerging novel technologies of Industry 4.0, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of
Things (IoT). Therefore, the present study adopts intelligent decision-making techniques to conduct a
biased analysis of the drivers, barriers, and risks involved in applying blockchain technologies to
the sustainable production of DTs. The proposed model illustrates the use of neutrosophic theory
to handle the uncertain conditions of real-life situations and the indeterminate cases evolved in
decision-makers’ judgments and perspectives. In addition, the model applies the analysis of Multi-
criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods through the use of ordered weighted averaging (OWA)
and the Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to achieve optimal
rankings for DT production providers based on consistent weighted decision-maker’s judgments
in order to maintain and to assure sustainability. An empirical study is applied to the uncertain
environment to aid decision-makers in achieving ideal decisions for DT providers with respect to
various DT challenges, promoting sustainability and determining the best service providers. The
Monte Carlo simulation method is used to illustrate, predict, and forecast the importance of the
weights of decision-makers’ judgments as well as the direct impact on the sustainability of DT
production.

1. Introduction
Blockchains may lead to unpredictable economic and industrial change on a global
scale. A blockchain is a digitized transaction in the form of blocks that are linked together
on the same distributed ledger. Blockchains and current internet technology differ in
several significant dimensions [1]. Only information and copies of things are transmitted
on the internet; the original information cannot be transmitted. By using a blockchain,
the value represented in a timestamped transaction is kept in a shared ledger in a secure
manner [2]. Blockchains record the digital transactions of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin,
Ethereum, etc.), and the technology is expected to renovate the world’s digital economy [3].
Industry 4.0 aims to enhance industrial developments by focusing on transitional factors

for environmental conditions and related technologies to assist advancements in automatic
industries [4]. Blockchain technology can change the methodologies of production for
industrial construction [5]. Indeed, the impression of any new technological production can
induce strong feelings in an audience due to the deactivation of traditional methodologies.
For example, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was anticipated to disable
the traditional techniques of industry [6]. However, the IBM Blockchain Platform was
developed to handle a full-stack blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) to allow the deployment
of blockchain components for any certain environment. Users are granted privileges in
building, operating, and expanding their own BaaS networks and production. In addition,
building information modeling (BIM) for professionally intelligent modeling, construction,
and engineering are supported by technologies and contracts to generate and manage
digital representations of physical places [6]. The blockchain approach can detect the
proper aspects of applications further from the focused applications for providers to be
constructed and developed.
Blockchain technology supports the development of cryptocurrencies. Hence, blockchain 1.0
is decentralized in transferring values between untrusted entities, mainly considered appli-
cations that support the transactions of cryptocurrency. In contrast, blockchain 2.0 is the
smart connections and extended applications behind the transactions of cryptocurrency,
especially for economic and financial developments [7]. Blockchain 3.0 adopts the main
characteristics of blockchain in the trustless decentralization leger, e.g., transparency, no
intermediates, and immutability, for applications (e.g., currency and investments) devel-
oped according to the technology of blockchain [8]. Indeed, cryptocurrency markets are
decentralized and have no central authority, and thus cannot be predictable either in the
development of technologies or financial systems. Therefore, barriers and risks must be
considered to guarantee the safe development of blockchain technology to promote trust in
competitive environments [9]. However, the building and maintenance of new technology
are costly and difficult to maintain. This study’s focus on DTs is based on blockchain tech-
nology as a substantial technology that can allow industries to be developed and evolve
with high service quality.
The extraordinary propagation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), high-performance
computing technologies, and data analytics is leading to a comprehensive and revolutionary
transition to industry 4.0 [10]. DTs are regarded as a fundamental element of the concept
of CPS, being a virtual representation of a substantial system, process, or smart object.
The vital role of DTs lies in the optimization of industrial operations to provide virtual
manufacturing and physical resources before the process of real manufacturing begins. The
DTs act in the digitized environment in the form of physical twins of real-world physical
objects [11]. The construction of DTs fulfills the gap between virtual considerations and real-
world constraints. DTs can use data generated from sensors to aid proactive maintenance
and construct predictive simulation models [12]. Many industrial processes can achieve
optimization using the digitized creation of DTs based on real instruments such as smart
containers, spacecraft, etc. [13].
In addition, healthcare systems can be directly influenced by improved production of
medical devices using various experiments and examples of operations on real patients
to create DTs. The recent technologies of industry 4.0, AI, and IoT and modeling and
data analytics can be integrated to match real environments with virtual worlds. It was
predicted that by 2020 DTS could be adopted in industrial organizations and become a
prevailing technology for smart industry [1]. The blockchain technology of decentralized
and distributed ledgers can be used with DTs to attain security, privacy, and history
tracking [14,15]. DTs are mainly occupied with uncomplicated centralized tools that lead to
a single point of failure-type vulnerabilities.
The use of DTs based on blockchain technology in business is becoming more and
more popular nowadays as a result of the spread of this technology [2]. Blockchains provide
a complete solution for data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity, where
any overwritten action will be captured and recorded. Today, business models are changing
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 3 of 18
to adapt to the digital economy and evolving consumer demands. This requires new and
existing companies to be equipped with the appropriate supply chain strategy to meet these
standards [16]. DTs can help alleviate the main challenges related to supply chains [17].
The present shift of companies to investing in DTs is based on the significant value of the
product. Additionally, it enables product or asset owners to control and manage their
products or assets across supply chains in more organized ways. The value of DTs can lie
in a scalable product structure or an asset structure in which multiple models can be added
or modified and then linked to enhance cross-functional collaboration [17]. Organizing and
implementing the right digital supply chain management strategies can enable companies
to grow and expand their profit margins.
The production of DTs has various criteria and alternatives that are considered to be
MCDM problems. To our knowledge, the different criteria and alternatives related to DT
production using MCDM technology have not been studied so far. This study provides
a resource for companies that need ideal DT providers in order to achieve sustainability
regarding the challenges of IoT, AI, and Industry 4.0 technologies. As DTs are considered a
new discipline within technologies of IoT, AI, and industry 4.0, the uncertainty and risks
involved are an issue that may threaten sustainability. Therefore, the present study focuses
on the main drivers, barriers, and risks that directly impact the production of DTs. In
addition, it focuses on the optimal methods that can aid decision-makers in reaching ideal
decisions that lead to sustainability [18]. The proposed model is focused on accounting
for decision-makers’ judgments in the quantitative format due to the novelty of the DT
field. Decision-makers’ judgments are very vital and sensitive. Certain perspectives and
judgments are not consistent or ideal due to limited experience or bias on the part of
decision-makers [19].
A neutrosophic set was used in the present study to handle and present the inde-
terminate cases in proper quantitative and qualitative formats [20]. OWA was used to
consider the effect of various risk impacts on the final results. The OWA illustrated random
weights in the problem’s criteria and then obtained the optimum and consistent weights.
Considering the novelty of DT, this study relies on OWA to evaluate risk and benefit
through random weighting to reach the final optimum priorities for criteria. The study
further adopts the TOPSIS method for ideal solutions. The TOPSIS method depends on
computing positive and negative regions to reach relative closeness between solutions for
final optimized ranked solutions.
The structure of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review
on the potential of DTs with respect to blockchain technologies and the achievement of
sustainability; Section 3 presents an analysis of the challenges involved in using blockchains
and their impact on the production of DTs; Section 4 illustrates the proposed model used to
achieve ideal solutions and sustainability using neutrosophic theory, OWA, and TOPSIS
considering the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0, AI, and IoT; Section 5 presents
an empirical study to validate the applicability of the model; Section 6 illustrates the
model using a Marlo Carlo simulation to estimate and predict the outcome of the model;
Section 7 summarizes the conclusions of the paper by highlighting possible future works
and future trends.
2. Literature Review of Blockchain Technology and DT Products
In this section, the management of DTs is described in order to show the need for
blockchain technologies. The main aspects of blockchain technologies that are necessary for
the production DTs in the proposed model are discussed as follows: (1) The management of
DT products; (2) the main technologies of blockchain; and (3) blockchain technology-based
Digital Twins and uncertainty. In addition, the uncertainty associated with blockchains and
their influence on the performance of DTs are discussed.
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 4 of 18
2.1. Management of DT Products
DTs are generally defined as the integration of multi-physics, multi-scale, and proba-
bilistic simulations of a complex product or system to reflect the life of its corresponding
twin [11]. Essentially, the components of DTs are classified as follows: (1) a physical
product, (2) a virtual product, and (3) the connection between the real and virtual prod-
ucts. The connection between the real product and digital/virtual product sustains a vital
influence on industries in various aspects. The direct connection and data transmission
between physical and virtual products support industry 4.0, allowing higher performance,
efficiency, optimization, and maintenance to be reflected in the real product. The DT life
cycle as a product follows the stages of (1) development, (2) growth, (3) maturity, and
(4) decline. Hence, the huge amount of data generated over a product’s life cycle data
should be efficiently handled [2]. Moreover, in order to ensure that all procedures for the
product life cycle are under control, the digital twin approach can perform full monitoring
of production activities over the full product life cycle to optimize production activities
according to the reports of the digital twin simulation [21].
2.2. Blockchain Technologies
A blockchain is an increasing list of records that are linked via cryptography such
that each block has a cryptographic hash for the preceding block, transaction data, and
timestamp. Blockchain records reside in a distributed ledger that cannot be changed until
applying the modifications for all subsequent blocks. Lischke and Fabian analyzed the
network of Bitcoin [22]. The following sections mainly focus on the main technologies for
the development of DTs based on blockchains.
2.2.1. Peer-to-Peer Networks and Blockchains
DTs are developed based on the blockchain behind the technology. Initially, the
blockchain was feigned using a peer-to-peer network to propose a distributed ledger for
cryptocurrency to form an ongoing chain hash to produce unchangeable data records. The
peer-to-peer network is decentralized and each peer, called a node, takes responsibility
for providing the needed services to the network [23]. The block must be validated with
consensus mechanisms and reflected in the updated block in the updated ledger before
residing on the distributed ledger. As a result, all nodes have the authority to access data
and to share and provide data with other nodes.
2.2.2. The Hash Algorithm in Blockchain Technology
The blockchain is composed of linked blocks that form chains of blocks. The structure
of a block in a blockchain consists of a header and a body for each block, the value of
the previous block hash, the timestamp for identifying the time of block creation, the
random root hash for the current block according to the network regulations, and the
body containing encoded and hashed vital transactions; each block can reside in more than
one transaction [2]. Blockchain hash values are unique, such that if any modifications are
applied to any block in the blockchain, the block’s corresponding hash value would be
directly modified [24]. ‘Proof of work’ is one applied mechanism for checking the validity
of a blockchain.
2.2.3. Transactions in Digital Twin-Based Blockchains
DTs have been adopted in the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ to address emerging
issues and challenges. Therefore, this section mainly focuses on blockchain transaction
blocks, which are the basic component for recording and sharing the public key, private
key, timestamp, and product life cycle of a DT. The public key is a shared key unique to all
network members, while each user owns the private key to access his/her cryptocurrencies.
A key pair is used to securely and safely utilize data sharing over the product life cycle.
The timestamp specifies the induction time of a transaction. The data over the product life
cycle are identified with the enterprise that owns the product. Therefore, according to a
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 5 of 18
transaction in the blockchain, any change in the DT will be recorded using the public key
and the private key with different timestamp values as well as the relevant life cycle data.
2.3. Blockchain Technology-Based Digital Twins and Uncertainty
Blockchain technology has obtained a great deal of attention, especially with respect
to cryptocurrencies. In blockchain systems, miners used to use transactions to search for
smart contracts or use existing ones. Each block has only a limited number of transactions,
leading miners to prioritize selection of the most appropriate contract [25], although miners
do not have enough information to decide and can only detect the maximum income from
contact. Therefore, uncertainty in the blockchain environment needs to be addressed with
nontraditional solutions, which decision-makers must aid with a clear vision to enhance
the process of decision-making.
The DT, interrelated with industry 4.0 and IoT, collects information from remote
devices such as sensors, physical models, etc., to optimize the system parameters in order
to achieve optimized results in industrial fields [26]. DT manufacturing is surrounded by
uncertainty factors; Karve et al. have proposed an intelligent planning approach to handle
these uncertainty conditions [26].
2.4. Applications of Blockchain
The blockchain and DT are the main elements that permit continuous data acquisition [27].
Therefore, this section describes blockchain applications according to different fields
of interest. Table 1 shows eight vital applications along with brief explanations and
benefits [7,28,29].

perform the process of elections can reduce cost and
ensure democracy.
Blockchains provide decentralized peer-to-peer technology to
assure confidence in election organizations [34].
3. Internet of Things
As IoT has been widely adopted, IoT applications can
be blended with blockchain technologies to acquire the
needed capabilities for dedicated computation for the
underlying devices [35].
The application of decentralized IoT platforms can support
blockchains (Novo, 2018). Moreover, the IoT can secure data
exchange in multiple context-aware scenarios [36] with
several interconnected smart devices.

credibility of findings in clinical trials and patients’ informed
consent [38].
5. Privacy and security
Blockchains apply asymmetric cryptography to secure
transactions between users, providing users with
enhanced techniques for security, transparency, and
traceability [39].
Privacy and security with blockchains can be applied to
many emerging fields, including big data [40], DNS (The
Decentralized Library of Alexandria, 2015), distributed
networks, and transactional privacy.

3. Enhancing the Production of Digital Twins by Analyzing Challenges in
Blockchain Adoption
Digital twins allow visualization of the current status of equipment as well as predict-
ing trends by analyzing the manufacturing context via learned operating behavior patterns.
Each digital twin has a specific advantage in product lifecycle management [48]. This
section illustrates the main drivers, barriers, and risks that influence the production and
manufacture of DT with respect to Industry 4.0, AI, IoT technologies and the achievement
of sustainable DT production. A detailed description of the related concepts and factors is
provided in Table 2 [3].
Table 2. A detailed explanation of the main drivers, barriers, and risks affecting the manufacturing of DTs.
ID Concept Factors Explanations
D1
Drivers
Security Blockchain records are secured through cryptography [49]. Users across networks exchange their
private and public keys to transactions and act as a personal digital signature.
D2 Anonymity
Unidentifiable personal details are needed between users (sender or receiver) in the blockchain.
In order to perform transactions, only the private and public keys are required, without the need
to reveal any related identity information [50].
D3 No Single Point of Trust In the blockchain, the distributed ledger is decentralized technology to overcome competent
authorities without any third party to a transaction, e.g., a banking transaction [51].
D4 Fraudulence Reluctance It is not easy for invaders to attack or alter any data on a blockchain [14]. Transactions are
executed remotely and smartly without human intervention.
D5 Non-physicality All physical transactions are transformed into digital ones. Digital transactions securely
overcome any bank bills and reduce costs [28].
B1
Barriers
Privacy Unfortunately, the public blockchain has limitations in terms of data privacy. There are no
privileges or grand rules, and all users can access any information in the distributed ledger [52].
B2 Data Storage The huge amount of data generated from transactions and sensors are not suitable for storage on
the blockchain. Public blockchains have restrictions on the amount of data stored [3].
B3 Scalability The blockchain must efficiently detect a wide-scale serialization with applicable scalability
concerns [53]. Blockchain technology can efficiently trouble many users on networks.
B4
High Computation
Power
The blockchain requires a great deal of computational power and electricity. Therefore, many
researchers have focused on novel applications in the field of the energy sector [54].
R1
Risk
Vulnerability
Smart and virtual contracts are conducive to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. The
risks and opportunities of emerging business models are adopted to overcome
vulnerabilities [55].
R2 Private key security The private key is an essential security credential [56]. Therefore, if the private key is hacked or
lost, it is challenging to trace the hacked data to permit recovery [57].
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 7 of 18

ID Concept Factors Explanations
R3 Criminal activity Cryptocurrencies may be used for illegal issues, and competent authorities may not be able to
detect or trace the real parties.
R4 Exposing identity
Hackers can identify and trace the IP address of users, then make illegal modifications that may
lead to the loss of users’ cryptocurrencies; e.g., any payment transaction can change the original
IP address to another to be received in the updated location by the hackers [3].
4. Evaluation Model for DT Products Based on Blockchain
The model for the production of DTs is concerned with the DT architecture, evaluation
methodology, and Monte Carlo Simulation, as mentioned in Figure 1. The DT architecture
includes IoT technologies, AI, and Industry 4.0. The evaluation methodology is built on
the drivers, risks, and barriers to DT architecture. The methodology includes methods and
data in addition to an analysis of MCDM. Monte Carlo simulation is used to reflect the
impact of decision-makers’ judgments as input with the outcomes. A detailed overview of
the proposed model is in Figure 2.
4.1. Methods and Data
The use of blockchain technology as a basis for DT adoption has various drivers and
challenges to attaining sustainability in the production of DTs. The present study integrates
expert surveys to present a general image of the performance of blockchain technology
that could affect the production of DT. The experts’ opinions are specifically focused on
the aspects of blockchain technology drivers, barriers, and risks. As shown in Figure 1,
this represents the model for ranking drivers, barriers, and risks related to DT. Indeed,
the decision-makers’ and experts’ opinions can be characterized as confused, and do not
have any restrictions. Decision-makers’ opinions may produce a consistent or inconsistent
state. Therefore, this study focused on the process of decision-making in the production of
digital twins based on blockchain technology, which can be classified according to three
dependent factors:
• Personality conditions: The personality conditions depend on the decision-maker’s
perspectives, policies, and professional conscience [4].
• Environmental conditions: The uncertain and unclear conditions in real situations
are unpredictable, e.g., changes in economy, technologies, society, epidemics [19],
and crises.
• Multiple criteria and alternatives (MCDM): these are complex situations for decision-
makers and are composed of various forms of factors, either quantitative or qualitative [18].
This study collected specialists’ perspectives based on discussion, meetings, and
qualitative discrete choice experiments [29]. These various decision-making experts were
aggregated through the adoption of the Ordered Averaging Operator (OWA) [58]. MCDM
methods were applied to the decision-makers’ perspectives for criteria and alternatives.
The robustness of the results were checked by a Monte Carlo simulation.
4.2. MCDM Analysis
The current problem has various criteria and alternatives, which are referred to as
MCDM. The MCDM was analyzed and evaluated by a set of experts in academia, industry,
and politics with various functional hierarchies and backgrounds [59]. The experts were
used to evaluate the blockchain technologies for the construction of DT. Figure 2 shows
the overview of the proposed MCDM method in three layers. OWA and TOPSIS can
be analyzed with methods and data in place, and details are presented in Sections 4.2.1
and 4.2.2. In this study, the experts’ evaluations were modeled as quantitative results
using neutrosophic theory [20]. The neutrosophic set can model the indeterminate cases in
real-life situations into a substitute neutrosophic scale. The neutrosophic scale can express
the criteria and alternatives in a descriptive form to reflect their importance and priority
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 8 of 18
from an expert point of view in real-life situations. According to the current problem
definition, this study adopted the triangular neutrosophic scale mentioned in [60].

The use of blockchain technology as a basis for DT adoption has various drivers and 
challenges to attaining sustainability in the production of DTs. The present study inte-
grates expert surveys to present a general image of the performance of blockchain tech-
nology that could affect the production of DT. The experts’ opinions are specifically fo-
cused on the aspects of blockchain technology drivers, barriers, and risks. As shown in 
Figure 1, this represents the model for ranking drivers, barriers, and risks related to DT. 
Indeed, the decision-makers' and experts’ opinions can be characterized as confused, and 
do not have any restrictions. Decision-makers’ opinions may produce a consistent or in-
consistent state. Therefore, this study focused on the process of decision-making in the 
production of digital twins based on blockchain technology, which can be classified ac-
cording to three dependent factors:

4.2.1. Analysing Criteria Using OWA
The aggregation of experts’ perspectives was applied using the OWA operator [61].
The OWA administers a general aspect of operators to diminish the effect of inconsistent
decision judgments. Assume that there are q experts D1, D2, . . . , Dq who participate in a
decision-making problem such that 1 ≤ k ≤ q. The OWA is defined as follows:
Step 1: Create a matrix of decision-making DMK
ij for experts Dk to model the experts’
perspectives on blockchain technology as criteria; the DMK
ij the matrix in Form (1) is in the
form of a neutrosophic triangular scale [20] and is defined as follows [62]:

where xij
k refers to the performance rating of the element of the ith criterion with respect to
f1, f2, . . . , f j the jth criterion x1, x2, . . . , xj from the experts’ perspective, Dk. Note that the
type of xij
k represents the experts’ perspectives according to the neutrosophic scale.
Step 2: The values of the indeterminate case are detected in the uncertainty conditions
for the three main factors of personality conditions, environmental conditions, and MCDM.
In this step, the neutrosophic scale can be converted into real numbers using the score
function presented in [18]. The values for the de-neutrosophic experts’ perspective matrix

where xij refers to the value of fi with respect to xj in the group decision-making matrix
DMij. The OWA operators are calculated xij as follows in Equation (4).

where sjl represents the lth largest xij

The weights can be generated in Equation (5) by applying the following equation: [61]:
wj= Q(j/m )−Q((j− 1)/m), j = 1, 2, ..., m. (5)

e.g., equally significant, slightly significant, very strongly significant, etc.
4.2.2. Analysing Alternatives Using TOPSIS
The MCDM methods are used to support decision-makers in complex problems with
various criteria and alternatives. The TOPSIS method, illustrated in reference [64], is used
to solve various problems. TOPSIS ranks proposed alternatives according to generated
ideal solutions. Assume that there are p alternatives O1, O2, . . . , Op as evaluated from m
criteria x1, x2, . . . , xm. Assume that there are q experts D1, D2, . . . , Dq who participate in
this decision-making problem, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ q. Let w1, w2, . . . , wm be the weighting
vector of m criteria with 1 ≤ j ≤ m, wj ≥ 0 and ∑m
j=1 wj = 1.
Step 4: Create a matrix of decision-making YK
ij for experts Dk to model the experts’
perspectives of blockchain technology as criteria and the effect on the production of DT,
(the YK
ij the matrix in Form 6) and convert it into a numerical form by applying the score
function mentioned in [20]:

where yrt
k refers to the performance rating of Op with respect to xt provided by expert
Dk, 1 ≤ r ≤ p, 1 ≤ t ≤ m, and 1 ≤ k ≤ q. Note that the type of yrt
k represents the experts’
perspectives on the neutrosophic scale.
Step 4: The aggregation of decision-makers’ judgments is achieved using the following
Equation (7):
yrt =
∑m
t=1
(
yk
rt
)
Dq
(7)
where yrt represents the decision-makers’ judgments for alternatives and Dq refers to the
number of decision-makers.
The outcome result is presented as follows in Form (3):

where yrt refers to the performance rating of Op with respect to xt provided by expert Dk.
TOPSIS is based on three main steps: (1) normalization, (2) calculating the ideal
solution in positive and negative regions, and (3) computing the relative distances between
the generated positive and negative regions.
Step 5: The normalization is achieved as follows in Equation (9):
zrt = wj ∗

∑m
t=1 x2
rt
; r = 1, 2, 3 . . . p; t = 1, 2, 3 . . . m (9)
where wj refers to the weights of criteria to generate a normalized weighted zrt matrix
Step 6: Compute the positive and negative regions, as follows, in Equations (10)
and (11):
z+t =
{
〈max(zrt|r = 1, 2, . . . , p)|j ∈ j+〉,
〈min(zrt|r = 1, 2, . . . , p)|j ∈ j−〉
}
(10)
Electronics 2022, 11, 1268 11 of 18
z−t =
{
〈min(zrt|r = 1, 2, . . . , p)|j ∈ j+〉,
〈max(zrt|r = 1, 2, . . . , p)|j ∈ j−〉
}
(11)
where j+ and j− refer to profit and cost criteria, respectively.
Step 7: Calculate the Euclidean distance between positive (d+r ) and negative ideal
solution (d−r ) on study’s alternatives in Equations (12) and (13) to achieve the two optimal
regions of solutions:
d+r =
√
∑m
t=1 (zrt − z+t )
2, r = 1, 2, . . . , p (12)
d−r =
√
∑m
t=1 (zrt − z−t )
2, r = 1, 2, . . . , p (13)
Step 8: Compute the relative closeness by aggregating the positive and negatives
regions of the solutions to achieve ideal solutions, as mentioned in Equation (14):
cr =
d−r
d+r + d−r
; r = 1, 2, . . . , p (14)
Step 9: Recommend the ideal solutions according to the proposed model.
5. Empirical Study
An empirical study is illustrated here to show the applicability of the proposed model.
The case study depends on the analysis of thirteen criteria about drivers, barriers, and risks,
as mentioned in Table 2. The perspectives were collected according to a specialist in the
application of blockchain technologies in the uncertain circumstances of real-life situations
and modeled using Form (1). Decision-makers’ judgments are modeled and expressed on a
triangular neutrosophic scale [4] to convert qualitative expressions into quantitative values
using Form (2). The triangular neutrosophic scale is converted into the numerical form
using the score function [18] in order to be simpler and more readable for researchers. The
general and aggregated form for decision-makers is modeled in Table 3.

The graphical representation for aggregated decision-makers’ judgments is illustrated
in Figure 3. For applying OWA, the weights were assumed as mentioned in Table 4
and represented in Figure 4. Then, the OWA general and aggregated decision-makers’
judgments were generated using Form (3) and Equation (4) and as mentioned in Table 5.
Hence, the new and accurate weights calculated on the generated OWA decision-makers’

Figure 4. The weights representing decision-makers’ perspectives. 
In order to aid the process of decision-makers in uncertain conditions, the case study 
adopts the application of TOPSIS on four different service providers for DT according to 
the final weights for criteria. The four alternatives are: (1) Azure Digital Twins; (2) IBM; 
(3) CISCO; and (4) Oracle. The judgments of decision-makers are collected in a triangular 
neutrosophic scale and converted into numerical values. The aggregated decision makers’ 
judgments of alternatives for criteria are aggregated using Equation (7) and as mentioned 
in Table 7. Apply the three steps for TOPSIS as follows: normalization is applied using 
Equation (9); results are depicted in Table 8. The positive and negative regions are applied 
using Equations (10) and (11), with the results presented in Table 8. Compute negative 
and positive regions using Equations (12) and (13) to achieve the relative closeness using 
Equation (14), as mentioned in Table 9. Figure 5 shows the final ranking as follows: IBM, 
Azure DT, oracle, and CISCO. The final rankings can aid decision-makers to achieve ideal 
DT providers to achieve sustainability with respect to the challenges of IoT, AI, and in-

Monte Carlo simulation is a model used in prediction and forecasting models under 
conditions of risk and uncertainty. The proposed model depends on the evaluation of the 
digital twin according to the weighted judgments of decision-makers. There are many 
ways to adjust weights, e.g., AHP, OWA, Neural Networks, etc. MCDM methods mainly 
depend on ranking alternatives according to certain criteria weights. The present study 
mainly works with the initial weights for criteria and then verifies these with OWA to

6. Model Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a model used in prediction and forecasting models under
conditions of risk and uncertainty. The proposed model depends on the evaluation of the
digital twin according to the weighted judgments of decision-makers. There are many
ways to adjust weights, e.g., AHP, OWA, Neural Networks, etc. MCDM methods mainly
depend on ranking alternatives according to certain criteria weights. The present study
mainly works with the initial weights for criteria and then verifies these with OWA to reach
final accurate weights. Therefore, the study focuses on the robustness of the recommended
alternatives. Zhang et al. used Monte Carlo to make simulations for the robustness of
results [65]. While considering the weights in the perturbation state, a random number
is generated with uniform distribution. The random numbers are achieved by the use
of the RAND ( ) function in business applications or computer packages. Consequently,
normalization is applied to the series of random numbers considering the original sum
of individual weights. The output of the normalization process refers to the relative
importance of criteria. The simulation is applied for 4000 trials, which is efficiently a large
number of trials concerning the number of study criteria and alternatives. The Monte
Carlo simulation is mainly used to test whether the final ranking of alternatives relies
on the weights of criteria to demonstrate the important priorities and weights of criteria,
alternatives, and decision-makers’ judgments, as mentioned in the results [18].
As a result, for the applied methods of OWA, TOPSIS, and Monte Carlo simulations,
the robustness of decisions needs to take into consideration the estimation decision-makers’
judgments of criteria and alternatives to prevent falling to local optimum. The applied
methods present a final ranking according to the input of decision judgments and real-world
situations. Any contradictions cannot be detected from the MCDM methods and must be
fixed with decision-makers according to current real situations. In [60], a consistency rate
for decision-makers’ judgments is applied to check the consistency of decision-making
judgments. The discrepancies and unbiases in decision judgments can be detected to be
further edited and managed by decision-makers and experts according to real-life situations.
Finally, the use of Monte Carlo showed that the perturbation of weights for criteria and
alternatives directly impacts the robustness of the final rankings and recommendations
such that the differences in weights as the input provided by decision-makers can change
the ranking for recommendation results [18].
7. Conclusions
In this paper, blockchain technologies are regarded as a milestone for evaluating the
challenges facing DTs. The model adopts the main drivers, barriers, and risks of blockchain
technologies to be reflected and analyzed in DT production. As the novelty, uncertainty, and
risk situations of DT technology should be handled and modeled with untraditional and
intelligent methods. Our model collected decision-makers’ judgments using neutrosophic
theory to model the indeterminate cases. The model used OWA to achieve consistent
weights for various challenge criteria for analysis. In addition, the model used TOPSIS
to analyze alternatives to ranking the best solutions in terms of sustainability. Finally, a
Monte Carlo simulation was applied to predict and forecast the outcomes in conditions
of uncertainty and risk. Future work could include the use of additional technologies to
analyze the challenges of DT manufacturing to attain sustainability.
