Abstract. The purpose of this work is to analyze the capabilities of automated
barter chains based on decentralized technologies - distributed databases and
peer-to-peer networks. Blockchain technologies are taken as an example. The
authors describe the concept of the so-called game, which is a system-forming
platform of automated barter chains for effective interaction between partici-
pants in economic processes (players) and aimed at the development and
acquisition of wealth of each participant, as well as the disclosure of his creative
and personal potential. As a result of the analysis, the function of the equivalent
in money-free exchange is determined and it is concluded that it is possible to
create a distributed mentoring institute, where every realized talent will take on
apprentices and be responsible for their development. This article provides the
analysis of questions of generalization of the financial paradigm in the transition
to a new socio-economic technological order by changing cultural attitudes to
the model of effective, targeted use of resources in the amount necessary for the
disclosure of the creative potential of each player and in the amount necessary
for his personal sense of happiness and harmony with himself, the surrounding
society and nature (symbiotic, ecological, systematic approach). The presented
concept is proposed as a basis for ensuring sustainable development of society
by redirecting the resource base to the harmonious sustainable development and
interaction of man and nature, the formation of an ecocentric social con-
sciousness that determines the ethical attitude of man to The Earth’s biosphere,
to flora and fauna.

The development of information systems is largely associated with the use of nature-
like technologies and the development of distributed software and hardware solutions.
This can be seen in neural network technologies, where instead of a single central
processor, a set of elementary calculators — neurons is used. This also applies to the
emergence of decentralized algorithms and databases: distributed hash tables (DHTs),
interplanetary file system (IPFS), various mechanisms (Filecoin, Bitswap, BigchainDB,
Ethereum, Swarm), MaidSafe technology, the purpose of which is to provide

decentralized communication throughout the world, and others [1–9]. In peer-to-peer
(p2p) networks, all networked computers have identical client and server functions [10,
11]. All these systems have increased reliability of transactions, calculations, and other
technological processes due to the properties of decentralization and powerful
encryption algorithms. This circumstance leads to a rethinking of the economic models
established around the world [12-15]. Consider a retrospective review of economic
systems and the development of monetary relations based on decentralized networks.
Barter in prehistoric times was considered as a sporadic exchange of products or
services. With the growth of labor productivity and the commodity mode of produc-
tion, there was a need for a universal equivalent, which led to the appearance of money.
In a developed capitalist economy, barter occupies a marginal niche, being used, for
example, in conditions of lack of liquidity. Money is performed including the role of a
value measure and a means of circulation, allowing you to divide in time the moments
of alienation by a participant in the turnover of goods a and the acquisition of goods B,
C, etc., the total cost of which is equal to the cost of goods A. Early views of
economists, philosophers [16] on this issue are associated with the lack of techno-
logical prerequisites at that time.
The development of peer-to-peer networks, technologies based on encryption and
distributed databases has become the basis of a number of new economic models. It is
obvious that the function of money has begun its transformation and this process is
difficult to regulate due to technological progress. This is confirmed by the intensive
development of various cryptocurrencies.
One of the main technologies is the blockchain, which has proven itself as a tool for
economic activity and a tool for distributed information systems (similar to IOTA
technology. Technically, it is a distributed crypto database, which is a chain of
«blocks» stored simultaneously on multiple computers - a growing list of records that
are linked using cryptography. Each such block contains the cryptographic hash of the
previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
The Open Bazaar project is a blockchain-based trading platform. In general, it is
similar to the discussed tools, here it is not barter, but buying and selling for cryp-
tocurrency. There are also known crowdsourcing platforms based on blockchain [9]
and “people’s court” systems based on blockchain – crowdjury.org.
A useful feature of this technology is the ability to capture information and thus
avoid misinterpretations of agreements (guarantee the reliability of the agreement and
the indisputability of transactions). This is an analog of a public digital signature, which
cannot be canceled, because it is stored simultaneously on all devices participating in
the general economic activity.
This paper presents the concept of a recommendation system for managing barter
chains based on decentralized crypto databases and peer-to-peer networks (hereinafter
referred to as the game). The concept is based on the following concepts:
* «Desires» (a goal that allows the player to improve the quality of life, designed
and published as a message of need);
* «Creation» (creative physical and mental activity of the player that brings him
satisfaction and is aimed at improving the game results and benefits the players);
* «Affluence» (having decent housing, freedom and means of movement, a stable
balanced diet, physical and mental health).

2 Materials and Methods
Consider the basic principles of interaction based on automated barter chains. The
game is an automated platform for the direct exchange of values, including goods and
services with a direct targeting system (P2P-Marketplace). It is a decentralized system
of consolidation and mutual assistance; it has a simple interface and is accessible from
electronic devices. Allows you to build self-organizing communities aimed at the
development, interaction and prosperity of the communities themselves. It has an
interface similar to a Bulletin Board with catalogs of products and services published
by users, without any restrictions on their personal pages, which are an evolution of the
card with information about the user.
The automated search for barter chains is based on an abstract scheme of a network
decentralized Game management system - a network graph, each vertex of which-a
participant in the game (a living person, a subject) has two lists: a wish list and a list of
opportunities (including skills). The general algorithm of the “Game” is that the sub-
jects (hereinafter referred to as players, avatars) agree on barter transactions in the
formalism of the Game: the blockchain records the fact of an agreement on a barter
transaction and its completion. Trading operations can be delegated to one or more
avatars for management. To optimize economic activity and logistics, various opti-
mization algorithms are provided for building rational barter chains in the interests of
participants. You can use internal tokens to transfer value or smart contracts [17–19].
The proposed system of smart contracts, organized on the acyclic directed graph
principle for Game implementation, is suitable for flexible management of planning,
design, progress, time reserves, reporting, private asset management, process support,
industrial production, and structuring complex processes in decentralized Autonomous
organizations. Targeting in such a system is based primarily on a direct sales model and
advertising that is interesting to end users (allowed by them to display).
By joining the Game, a new participant contributes a resource to the game society
as a share contribution in accordance with the law on consumer cooperation [20–22].
Resource - a unit or set of intellectual or physical activities. When entering the game, a
person notifies the system about what, in what quantity and in what time period he can
add to the game fund, for example: products, things [23], services, training, develop-
ment, any useful and/or demanded actions. In this case, the share payment is entered
into his personal account and is his property. The player has the right to dispose the unit
fee independently and manage the services of other players, as well as top up the unit
fee of the Deposit and confirmation of qualification.
Resources are distributed among players based on the principle of “resources for
creative potential” to build this potential into a common collective playing field. The
priority is to allocate resources that will directly strengthen the territory of the agree-
ments and the game system as a whole. For this purpose, each user has a personal rating
system and a system of social groups, on the basis of which various privacy settings
can be applied and certain functions can be enabled. It allows you to adjust flexibly the
filtering and security and to provide a comfortable social interaction. Private resources
are resources that represent a manifestation of work or creativity. The Union has the
46 I. V. Stepanyan and M. A. Chirkov
right to transfer part of its experience to a new participant who has joined the Game,
subject to the consent of all members of the Union.
Thus, the game implementation technologies are represented as a convergence of
historical, cultural and scientific heritage, as well as technologies in the field of
telecommunications, marketing, distributed registries, peer-to-peer communication,
queuing, machine learning and social engineering.
For the neuroeconomic modeling of the Game, we use a graph-theoretic approach:
we associate a participant in economic relations (player) with each vertex of the graph,
and the presence of economic interaction with the arcs. The simplest variant of
interaction is that two players enter into economic relations, while the first player
supplies the resource to the second, and the second, instead of monetary settlement
with the first, uses a chain of economic interactions, which is closed to the first player.
Thus, the barter chain functions, ensuring that the needs of the first and second players
are met.
Obviously, within the formalism of the proposed model, the number of feedbacks in
the form of barter chains will determine the level of economic stability of the entire
system. In graph theory, such feedbacks are simple cycles.
For further reasoning, we will create a random growing graph and estimate the
probability of occurrence of simple cycles in it that simulate economic feedbacks.
Consider the algorithm:
1. A set of N nodes (vertices) N = {1,2,3 .... N} is given. Each node is numbered.
2. The initial structure of the graph is set from two connected nodes.
3. Repeat steps 4–7 N times.
4. The structure of the graph is recalculated
5. One of the N nodes is chosen at random and connected to an arbitrary node in the graph
6. The number N of free vertices decreases by one
7. Go to step 3.
8. Stop.
3 Results
For model experiments and estimating the scatter of the statistical values of the
parameters of growing graphs, this algorithm was repeated a hundred times. After each
run of the algorithm, the parameters were calculated and curves were plotted. These
curves were then superimposed on each other to visualize the final results (Fig. 1).
The author’s hypothesis is that the presence of multiple feedbacks makes any
(including economic) system more stable.
Similar effects with feedback are observed in the neural network structure of the
brain of higher animals and humans. In this sense, distributed networking technologies
have biological counterparts, proven by natural selection and evolution.
Neuroeconomic Modeling of Distributed Barter Systems 47
Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, interesting features are observed in the
structure of the graph: the probability of a sharp increase in cyclic structures (by 5 and 7
times) is observed in 2% of cases starting from 83 growth steps.
Consider an example of economic efficiency and comparison with the free market
model. The disadvantages of the modern economic model are clearly visible in the
following typical example. At the beginning of economic activity, one need to take a
loan, then spend money on advertising, marketing and searching for counterparties,
then return the loan in conditions of inflation and systemic crises.
On the other hand, within the framework of the Game concept, the player forms a
desire, and a unique identifier is assigned to the desire. From this moment, the search
mechanism aimed at meeting the needs and desires of the maximum number of par-
ticipants of the barter chain is launched. When the necessary barter chain is found, the
cost of the materials and transport delivery (decentralized, national logistics) is formed
with fixing all the necessary parameters on the blockchain.
Upon delivery of the product to the customer, the integrity of the packaging and
goods is recorded, and compliance with the declared quality and terms of the smart
contract is checked, with the possibility of instant confirmation by online observers, if
everything went well, the smart contract distributes points and fixes the end of the
cycle.

The self-organization of the game allows to optimize not only the economic
component, but also the environmental (non-waste) production principles [24–26]. This
is a redirection of the resource base to the harmonious more sustainable development of
man and nature, the formation of an ecocentric social consciousness, which determines
the ethical attitude of man to the Earth’s biosphere, flora and fauna [27]. Ecocentric
thinking suggests that the biosphere, flora and fauna are not a utilitarian application to
humans, but equal to humanity.
4 Discussion
It should be noted that the goal aimed at obtaining wealth (the concept of the game)
does not coincide with the goal of making profit (the concept of a common economic
model). These are totally different paradigms. Moreover, the proposed model can be
used to make a profit, since it is more general.
The question arises: how can the equivalent function be exchanged without money?
Tokens (points and their various types - ratings of smart contracts) can have this
function, for example, this can be a number of positive reviews. Of course, it is
important to use the correct established contract form (smart contract) [28].
The formation of exchange baskets and transaction conditions should be formalized
very clearly and in detail in accordance with the legislation of the country (unless
otherwise specified in the contract, then it is considered that the goods are considered
equivalent - the contract should be drawn up so that it really should not be otherwise). In
the Russian Federation, this is Article 568 of the Civil Code - a barter agreement [29].
The relevance and prospects of this topic are due to the growth in the speed of
cryptocurrency transactions, which currently reach 50,000 transactions per second
(Table 1), as well as a number of publications on this topic [for example, [30–32].
5 Conclusions
The article demonstrates the paradox of double negation in the historical development
of circulation: direct exchange (barter) - exchange mediated by the universal (mone-
tary) equivalent (commodity - money - commodity formula) - barter in the information
society (smart contracts and barter chains without money).

The software platform within the framework of the described concept allows
achieving a high level of automation with maximum reliability and guaranteeing the
security of transactions.
Software switching and network virtualization technologies with peer-to-peer
connections between users, devices and applications allow implementing the proposed
decentralized microservice architecture using open source. This will contribute to the
sustainable development of society and its harmony with nature.
