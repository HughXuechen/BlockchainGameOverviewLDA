Abstract—The development of smart manufacturing modes,
following the guidelines of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, suggests the
use of new technologies to ensure greater agility, individualization
and personalization. Blockchain technology, as one of the new
technologies, enables decentralization and trustless environment,
however, on the other hand, introduces scalability limitations into
the system. This paper presents an exploratory network analysis
of money flow in blockchain-based Shared Manufacturing. We
conduct an experiment in the form of an online game with people
in order to obtain real data on network of prosumers in the
said concept. We describe a relation between the money flow
network, the supply of services in the market and the state of
occupancy of the blockchain network in blockchain-based Shared
Manufacturing. A greater supply of services in the market and a
more occupied blockchain network causes a tendency for money
flow network to organize like scale-free networks, however, this
claim will be further verified in future work.

I. INTRODUCTION
Advances in fields of digitalization and servitization in past
years have stimulated the development of new modes of smart
manufacturing. The requirements collected under the term
Industry 4.0 have directed manufacturing systems towards
agility, individualization and personalization [1]. One of the
new modes is Shared Manufacturing [2] (SharedMfg). The
main property of the concept is that it cuts vertically into
the structure of production systems, where an individual part
of the production system is placed directly on the market in
the form of a service. It reaches an individual level and thus
increases the sociality of manufacturing, which can benefit
the participants (both consumers and providers) with improved
capabilities and competitiveness, boosting reciprocal business
models.
Blockchain technology has emerged with the arrival of Bit-
coin [3] as an alternative to the traditional monetary systems.
It is a decentralized banking system organized in the form
of a network of nodes that form a distributed database of all
transactions that have occurred on the network. Transactions
are written in blocks that occur in a certain time interval and
the blocks are connected in a chain. The main property of the
blockchain technology is that the network forms a consensus
on confirmed transactions in a decentralized way, so it is not
necessary for users to trust each other [4]. With the evolution
of blockchain technology, different implementations of the
consensus mechanism have emerged, such as Proof-of-Work
(PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and
many more. PoW is the consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin
blockchain networks, presented by Nakamoto [3]. In PoW
nodes compete with each other, trying to solve cryptographic
puzzles in order to add new blocks to the blockchain and earn
themselves a reward. One of the main disadvantages of the
PoW mechanism is power consumption [5], due to the constant
need of computing resources in order to generate new blocks.
PoS was presented as an answer to the mentioned problem,
first introduced by King et al. [6]. In PoS, a block generator
is chosen on the basis of its proportional stake in the network
that is its wealth in terms of that cryptocurrency. The chosen
node uses a digital signature to prove its ownership over the
stake instead of solving a complicated hash problem [7].
The new SharedMfg concept proposes an approach in which
resource sharing is at all levels of manufacturing systems.
Given that this concept allows the integration of smaller
production systems and subsystems that are in traditional
systems connected more locally [8], new connections in the
network will also be formed at the global level. This raises
the problem of how to effectively organize such a large
number of autonomous production units (APUs) that do not
trust each other into a network of prosumers. Solutions have
been proposed where the platform that took care of aggrega-
tion was implemented using blockchain technology [9], [10].
Blockchain technology with its properties allows transactions
between individual entities to be carried out in a decentral-
ized manner without centralized intermediaries. On the other
hand, blockchain technology imposes certain restrictions on
SharedMfg. The problem with blockchain technology is net-
work scalability [11]. The frequency of transaction validation
is limited by the speed at which information is propagated

few highly connected nodes (hubs), which link the rest of the
less connected nodes to the system. Any part of the scale-free
network is stochastically similar to the whole network, and
parameters are assumed to be independent of the system size
[30]. Exploring several large databases describing the topology
of large networks, Barabasi et al. [27] have shown that,
independent of the system and the identity of its constituents,
the probability P (k) that a vertex in the network interacts with
k other vertices decays as a power law, following Equation 3.
P (k) ∼ k−γ (3)
The exponent γ is typically scattered in the range between
2 and 3. In this regime, the first moment of the degree
distribution is finite but the second and higher moments
diverge as n → ∞. Consequently, scale-free networks in this
regime are ultra-small world. For γ > 3, both the first and
the second moments are finite. For all practical purposes the
properties of a scale-free network in this regime are difficult
to distinguish from the properties a random network of similar
size [31].
Power-law distribution: In order to critically evaluate
power-law distribution in empirical data, Clauset et al. [32]
have defined a principled statistical framework for discerning
and quantifying power-law behavior. The evaluation process is
defined in three steps, namely estimation of parameters xmin
in γ by fitting the power-law to the data using the maximum-
likelihood method, calculation of the goodness-of-fit between
the data and the power law, and comparison of the power law
with alternative hypotheses.
A discrete power-law distribution is one described by a
probability density p(x) in Equation 4, where xmin is mini-
mum degree cutoff (xmin > 0) and ζ(γ, xmin) is the Hurwitz
zeta function.
p(x) =
x−γ
ζ(γ, xmin)
(4)
Estimating γ correctly requires a value for the lower bound
xmin of power-law behavior in the data. With the method
of maximum likelihood we can derive maximum likelihood
estimators of the scaling parameter for the discrete case. The
likelihood function is defined with Equation 5.
L(γ) = −n ln ζ(γ, xmin)− γ

Expression for γ̂ (in Equation 6) in discrete case can be
derived using approximation, where xi, i = 1, ..., n, are the
observed values of x such that xi ≥ xmin.

If we wish our estimate of γ to be accurate, we also need
an accurate method for estimating xmin. If we choose too
low a value for xmin, we will get a biased estimate of the
scaling parameter, since we will be attempting to fit a power-
law model to non-power-law data. On the other hand, if we
choose too high a value for xmin, we are effectively throwing
away legitimate data points xi < xmin, which increases both
the statistical error on the scaling parameter and the bias from
finite size effects. There are different methods of choosing
xmin that are structured and work relatively well [33], [34].
In order to calculate the goodness of fit between the data
and the power law, we have to use some kind of measure. Such
measures or tests describes how well statistical model fits a set
of observations. They are based on measurement of the dis-
crepancy (distance) between the distribution of the empirical
data and the hypothesized model. This distance is compared
with distance measurements for comparable synthetic data sets
drawn from the same model, and the p-value is defined to be
the fraction of the synthetic distances that are larger than the
empirical distance. If p is large (close to 1), then the difference
between the empirical data and the model can be attributed to
statistical fluctuations alone; if it is small (e.g. p ≤ 0.1), the
model is not a plausible fit to the data. There are a variety of
measures for quantifying the distance between two probability
distributions, but for nonnormal data the commonest is the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic [35]. The procedure for
performing the KS test is as follows:
• fit the power-law to the data using the maximum-
likelihood method and calculate KS statistics for the fit,
• generate a large number of power-law distributed syn-
thetic data sets with scaling parameter γ and lower bound
xmin equal to those of the distribution that best fits the
observed data,
• fit each synthetic data set individually to its own power-
law model and calculate the KS statistic for each one
relative to its own model,
• count the fraction of the time that the resulting statistic
is larger than the value for the empirical data.
Money flow network in blockchain-based SharedMfg: The
money flow network in blockchain-based SharedMfg concept
is a complex network, in which nodes can be seen as APUs
(players) and edges corresponding to the amount of money
that was transferred between two nodes. In addition, money
can be transferred both ways, therefore network is weighted
and directed (Figure 3a). In some cases, some money can be
transferred from node to itself, thus constructing the loops
in the network (edge Z). The connection between the nodes
is established for two reasons, namely the payment for the
service (edge price) and the transaction fee (edge txFee),
which is distributed during the transaction validation process
(Figure 3b).
RESULTS
The experiment involved 27 players, students at the Uni-
versity of Ljubljana, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering,
who during their studies were introduced to smart modes of
manufacturing systems such as the SharedMfg concept. The
game lasted 90 minutes, players were in remote locations, but
they were allowed to communicate. The web application was

as consumers but could, at the end of the game, only offer
their service on the market. This type of system operation
does not offer an incentive to include new APUs in such a
system and excludes existing smaller players from the system.
Questions arise how can we integrate blockchain technology
in SharedMfg and at the same time ensure the property of
a decentralized platform and thus enable normal operation of
the system for all users. In future work findings presented in
this paper will be verified by an optimized experiment and
also solutions for better integration of blockchain technology
in SharedMfg will be explored.
