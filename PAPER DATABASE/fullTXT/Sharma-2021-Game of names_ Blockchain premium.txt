We examine stock price response around cryptocurrency-related corporate name
change announcements using an event study framework. We find that
cryptocurrency-related name changes generate larger gains in share price and
volume than other corporate name changes. The valuation gains associated with
cryptocurrency-related name changes cannot be explained by standard asset
pricing factors, firm and stock characteristics, industry specific shocks, or by the
presence of outliers. These gains are higher when the announcements happen dur-
ing periods of high sentiment for cryptocurrencies. There is evidence that
shareholders with better access to private information about such name changes
are able to front-run other shareholders.
1 | INTRODUCTION
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that facilitates peer-to-peer
economic transactions without the need for a trusted third party. The
blockchain technology underpins most cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin and Ethereum, with potential applications in a variety of busi-
ness contexts, such as managing supply chains (Kamble et al., 2020;
Tönnissen& Teuteberg, 2020), improving transparency in the insurance
industry (Disparte, 2017), managing employee benefits (Ying
et al., 2018), and settlement of financial transactions (Canaday, 2017;
Guo & Liang, 2016). However, despite the attention and rich discus-
sions around the blockchain technology in academic research and pop-
ular press, in most cases, the purported applications of blockchain
technology remain conceptual expositions. There is little empirical evi-
dence regarding the economic value generated by businesses by using
these purported applications of the blockchain technology. Nonethe-
less, the transformative potential of blockchains has evoked consider-
able interest from the investor community. Some publicly listed firms
have devised a simple strategy to exploit the investor's interest around
cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology—changing their corporate
names to include cryptocurrency-related buzzwords such as “bitcoin”
or “blockchain.”Quite often, these name changes are symbolic without
any material changes to the underlying business but are nonetheless
followed by spectacular gains in their stock prices (Jain & Jain, 2019).
Articles in popular press and anecdotal evidence regarding mis-
leading corporate name changes and the subsequent stock price behav-
ior have engendered some scrutiny from the security market
regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
launched a formal investigation against both Long Blockchain Corp and
Riot Blockchain. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. SEC chairman, Mr. Jay
Clayton, warned companies against changing their corporate names to
imply any association with blockchains without providing adequate dis-
closures to investors about the nature of business changes and the risks
involved. Invoking the Investment Company Act of 1940, which pro-
hibits the use of “materially deceptive or misleading” names, the SEC
forced two exchange-traded funds—Reality Shares and Amplify—to
drop the word “blockchain” from their fund description.
In the absence of a robust regulatory framework prohibiting such
name changes, and with no classification for cryptocurrency firms in
traditional industry classification schemes such as Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC), this game of name change has become common
and surprisingly effective in generating valuation gains. For example,
the stock price of Long Island Iced Tea, a beverage company,
increased by over 500% following the announcement that it will
change its corporate name to Long Blockchain. Bioptix, a medical
equipment manufacturing company, experienced a doubling of its
stock price within a week of announcing a name change to Riot
Blockchain. This practice is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble of the
late 1990s. Cooper et al. (2001) found that firms that included some
internet-related buzzwords such as “.com,” “.net,” or “internet” in
their corporate names during the dotcom bubble earned cumulative
average abnormal returns (CAAR) of 74% for the 10 days surrounding
the name change announcement.
By employing a standard event study methodology, our study
explores the investor behavior around cryptocurrency-related name
change announcements and attempts to answer the following

questions: Are cryptocurrency-related name changes associated with
valuation gains? If there are valuation gains, are they transient or per-
manent? Can standard asset pricing factors explain such valuation
gains around name change announcements? Which group of share-
holders benefits the most from these valuation gains? The study finds
a significant increase in both stock return and trading volume around
the cryptocurrency-related name change announcements. The abnor-
mal returns and abnormal volume accompanying cryptocurrency-
related name changes are larger than those experienced around
other name change announcements, which are unrelated to
cryptocurrencies. This surge in price and trading volume is robust to
deletion of outliers and cannot be explained by standard asset pricing
factors or any industry-specific shock. Only investor sentiment for
cryptocurrencies and the momentum of “bitcoin” returns are posi-
tively related to such valuation gains. Nevertheless, these gains are
transient and not persistent. Identifying the date of name change
announcement as the event day or Day 0, we find evidence of
postannouncement negative drift in cumulative abnormal returns
(CAR) as early as Day +6 (6 days after the event), and the stocks give
up almost all abnormal valuation gains around Day +29. Further, using
Thomson ONE Banker's investor classification, we divide the signifi-
cant shareholders of a firm into two groups, namely, strategic entities
and investment managers.1 We find that strategic entities are able to
derive the greater benefit from this short-term valuation gains accom-
panying cryptocurrency-related name change announcement. Thus,
our results are consistent with the insider trading-information leakage
hypothesis of Keown and Pinkerton (1981), who documented excess
stock returns prior to the first public announcement of planned
mergers.
Our study makes several contributions to the existing literature.
First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that com-
pares the valuation gains observed around cryptocurrency-related
name change with those observed around other corporate name
changes. Some earlier studies document abnormal stock price increase
around cryptocurrency-related name changes (Jain & Jain, 2019).
However, other types of corporate name changes have also been
associated with an abnormal increase in stock prices (Horsky &
Swyngedouw, 1987; Karim, 2011; Kot, 2011). Thus, it is of interest to
examine whether the investor behavior around cryptocurrency-
related name changes is different from that observed around other
corporate name changes. Second, we extend the analysis of Jain and
Jain (2019) in a number of significant ways. The analysis by Jain and
Jain (2019) is based on a sample of only 10 firms that included the
word “blockchain” in their names, which they identify using web
searches. We use the sample of all global equities available on Thom-
son Reuters Datastream database that have changed their corporate
names to include a cryptocurrency-related buzzword, which allows us
to identify a more comprehensive sample of 40 firms. In addition, we
consider a wider range of expected return models to estimate abnor-
mal returns, which ensures that our estimates abnormal returns can-
not be attributed to standard asset pricing factors, industry-specific
shocks, or few outlier firms that generate outsized stock returns
around their name change announcement. Third, unlike previous
works that only focus on stock price response, we also estimate
abnormal trading volume around the cryptocurrency-related change
announcements. Considering both stock price response and the
change in trading volume provides a more complete representation of
investor behavior around name change announcements. For example,
a persistent increase in trading volume after the name change
announcement is indicative of a general increase in investor interest.
Fourth, we provide first evidence that shareholders with better access
to private information about the business are able to front-run other
shareholders by building substantial long positions in the stock in the
pre-announcement period.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides a review of the literature on investor behavior around corpo-
rate name change announcements; Section 3 develops the hypothe-
ses; Section 4 describes the methodology; Section 5 describes the
data used in the study; Section 6 presents the empirical results; and
Section 7 provides the concluding remarks.
2 | LITERATURE REVIEW
The organizational identity literature suggests that name changes can
be used to resolve any discrepancies between a firm's own identity
and its image as perceived by the outsiders (Gioia et al., 2000).
Lee (2001) examined the link between corporate name changes and
shareholder reaction. He noted that name changes act as a market sig-
naling mechanism by which information about a firm's identity can be
passed on to the investors. However, irrespective of the underlying
benefits of the name change decision, it also entails considerable tan-
gible costs, such as advertising and publicity expense, and intangible
costs of foregoing an established name, which has already earned
some reputation and goodwill in customers' mind (Kashmiri &
Mahajan, 2015). In general, the larger the firm, the higher the costs
associated with its name change.
Past works that measure the association between corporate name
changes and shareholder value creation have found mixed results.
Morris and Reyes (1992) and DeFanti and Busch (2011) reported a
positive association; Karbhari and Sori (2004) and Andrikopoulos
et al. (2007) found a negative association; and Bosch and
Hirschey (1989) found no association. The divergence between these
results can be at least partly explained by the differences in sample
and methodology. Karpoff and Rankine (1994) noted that the evi-
dence for valuation effect of corporate name changes tends to be
sample-specific, and it is significantly influenced by the presence of
outliers. In addition, because the costs associated with a corporate
name change are lower for smaller firms, any sample of firms that
announced a corporate name change is likely to be biased towards
smaller firms. Therefore, conventional estimates of abnormal returns,
such as those based on the market model, are likely to be contami-
nated by the size effect (Banz, 1981). The results are also sensitive to
the choice of event window selected around the name change
announcement. For example, DeFanti and Busch (2011) documented
a positive valuation effect; however, they examined only a 7-day

event window around the name change announcement. Bosch and
Hirschey (1989) found a statistically significant 1.62% positive abnor-
mal return for a 21-day period around the announcement day, which
was followed by a postannouncement negative drift, which largely
offsets the valuation gains observed around the announcement.
Nonetheless, there is evidence that name changes engineered to
exploit speculative mania around new “glamour” industries can be
quite successful in generating valuation gains. Most notably, at the
peak of the dotcom bubble, several firms experienced large valuation
gains following the announcement of corporate name changes to
Internet-related names (Cooper et al., 2001; Lee, 2001). Sobel (1965)
documented similar speculative manias in the United States around
mining and railroad stocks in the 1850s and around science and tech-
nology stocks in the 1960s. If the name changes are indeed associated
with valuation gains, shareholders with private information regarding
impending name change announcement can front-run other share-
holders in building long positions in the stock. If the valuation gains
are also transient, this strategy can be classed as a variant of a pump
and dump stock price manipulation scheme, wherein a symbolic name
change announcement is used to inflate the stock price temporarily.
Pump and dump is often characterized by a concomitant short-term
spurt in volatility and trading volume, followed by a long-term price
reversal (Aggarwal & Wu, 2006; Leuz et al., 2017; Putniņš, 2012).
Although any form of pump and dump manipulation is deemed illegal
by stock market regulators, pump and dump schemes are pervasive in
the unregulated cryptocurrency market (Li et al., 2019). For instance,
on January 9, 2018, at the peak of the craze around cryptocurrencies
with bitcoin trading near its all-time high, Kodak announced that it
would create its own cryptocurrency called KodakCoin. The
announcement caused the company's stock to quadruple in 2 days
from $3.10 to $13.48. On January 8, 2018, 1 day before the
announcement, seven members of the nine-member board of direc-
tors awarded themselves large stock grants in the form of restricted
stock units. The company disclosed this in a set of SEC filings made
on January 10, 2018, the day after the KodakCoin announcement.
The filings also indicated that some of the restricted stock units had
already been exercised. After peaking on January 10, 2018, Kodak's
stock price swiftly and steadily declined, and by May 31, 2018, it had
given all the gains in share price experienced due to the hype around
KodakCoin. The initial coin offering of KodakCoin was scheduled on
January 31, 2018, but it was indefinitely delayed after facing regula-
tory scrutiny from the SEC.
3 | BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES
Despite the tremendous costs involved in a corporate name change,
many businesses change their names to signal a new strategic direction
to its customers, investors, and competitors (Koku, 1997). As a corpo-
rate name change is an expensive and unambiguous signal about the
new way of doing business, it is an effective tool to exploit speculative
mania among investors around the “glamour” industries. We posit that
due to the general perception regarding the enormous growth potential
of the blockchains and cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency-related name
changes should be associated with an increase in investor interest.
Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:
H1a. Cryptocurrency-related corporate name changes generate posi-
tive and significant abnormal returns.
H1b. The valuation gains experienced around cryptocurrency-related
name changes are larger than those experienced around name
changes that are unrelated to cryptocurrencies.
A complementary indicator of an increase in investor interest is a
significant and persistent increase in trading volume. Unlike estimates
of abnormal returns that are sensitive to the choice of the expected
return model, the abnormal trading volume estimates are model-free.
Additionally, even if the run-up in stock price is transient, the trading
volume may remain elevated for long periods representing a persis-
tent increase in stock liquidity. We propose the following hypothesis
to examine the effect on cryptocurrency-related name changes on
trading volume.
H2a. Cryptocurrency-related corporate name changes generate posi-
tive and significant abnormal trading volume.
H2b. The increase in trading volumes experienced around
cryptocurrency-related name changes is larger than those
experienced around name changes that are unrelated to
cryptocurrencies.
Because the costs involved in a corporate name change are higher
for large and well-established businesses, it is likely that any sample of
firms that announced a corporate name change is skewed towards
smaller firms with relatively illiquid stocks. We examine whether the
valuation gains accompanying the cryptocurrency-related name
change announcements can be explained by firm characteristics, the
bid-ask bounce effect (Conrad & Kaul, 1993), or a failure to account
for transaction costs involved in illiquid stocks. In addition, we try to
measure the relation between the general sentiment around
cryptocurrencies and the magnitude of abnormal returns observed
around cryptocurrency-related name changes. This leads us to the fol-
lowing hypotheses:
H3a. The abnormal returns experienced around cryptocurrency-
related corporate name changes are not explained by firm char-
acteristics or liquidity of the stock.
H3b. The abnormal returns experienced around cryptocurrency-
related corporate name changes are positively associated with
contemporaneous sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.
Finally, we examine whether insiders are able to exploit the pri-
vate information about impending name change by increasing their
ownership stakes prior to the public announcement of the corporate

name change. In the presence of information asymmetry between dif-
ferent groups of shareholders, that is, if one group of shareholders is
likely to have better access to private business information as com-
pared with another group of shareholders, one would expect the for-
mer to outperform the latter in exploiting the valuation premiums
associated with name change announcements. This leads us to the fol-
lowing hypothesis:
H4. Strategic entities would outperform Investment managers in
exploiting the valuation gains associated with cryptocurrency-
related name change announcements.
4 | METHODOLOGY
To test the abovementioned hypotheses, we employ a hybrid empiri-
cal methodology that rests on the statistical matching methodology
on the one hand and the standard event study methodology on the
other hand. Both these methods are explained below:
4.1 | Matching
As described earlier, we examine the valuation effect of including a
cryptocurrency-related buzzword in the corporate name. To accu-
rately measure this treatment effect, one needs to compare the
impact of such name change announcements on the valuation of sam-
ple firms and the impact of other corporate name change announce-
ments on the valuation of a different set of firms, that is, control
firms. However, greater care should be taken before choosing a com-
parable set of control firms. For example, if there is a significant differ-
ence in market capitalization (ME) between the sample and control
firms, it may confound comparison of valuation effects of name
change announcements because of the size effect (Banz, 1981), that
is, on an average, smaller firms tend to produce larger stock returns
than larger firms. Additionally, for tiny firms with thinly traded stocks
and little investor interest, any new information can have a large posi-
tive effect on their stock prices (Cooper et al., 2001).
Even after controlling for the size of firms, low-priced stocks tend
to behave differently than high-priced stocks due to a difference in
their investor clientele. Recent research suggests that individual inves-
tors prefer low-priced stocks due to their lottery-like characteristics
(Bali et al., 2017; Eraker & Ready, 2015; Kumar, 2009). Birru and
Wang (2016) show that individual investors suffer from a “nominal
price illusion,” wherein they overestimate the upside potential of low-
priced stocks relative to high-priced stocks. Using a dataset of all
stocks traded on U.S. exchanges, Singal and Tayal (2015) found that
after controlling for size, high-price stocks outperform low-priced
stocks by 4.32% a year over the period from December 1962 to
December 2013.
To mitigate these potential confounding factors, we match each
sample firm with a control group firm based on ME, price, and the
number of shares traded, in order to minimize the difference between
the two groups. We use two matching methods—propensity score
matching (PSM) and Mahalanobis distance matching (MDM)—to iden-
tify the matched control group. In addition to the comparison of the
mean values of each characteristic, Ho et al. (2007) and Imai
et al. (2008) recommend a comparison of higher moments of the dis-
tribution of characteristic to obtain a broader characterization of dis-
tributional similarity between the sample firms and the matched
control firms. For each characteristic, we compute the variance ratio
as the ratio of the variance of the sample group to the variance of the
control group. Variance ratios close to 1 are indicative of a good bal-
ance between the sample firms and control firms. Once the matched
control group is finalized, we perform an event study to explore the
impact of corporate name change announcements on both sample
and control group of firms.
4.2 | Event study
The date of the name change announcement is considered Day 0, and
it is referred hereafter as the event date. The event window notation
[−x, +y] corresponds to an (x + y + 1)—day period, from x trading days
before the event date to y trading days after the event date. The daily
abnormal return for stock k is calculated as the difference stock return
on day t, Rk,t, and the expected stock return on day t, E(Rk,t), estimated
using a particular expected returns model.
ARk,t =Rk,t−E Rk,tð Þ
The cumulative average abnormal return over the event window
[p, q] is estimated as follows:
CAARpq =
Xq
t= p
XN
k =1
ARk,t,
where N is the total number of firms and
PN
k =1ARk,t is the average
abnormal return on day t.
To ensure that our CAAR estimates are not sensitive to the speci-
fication of the expected return model, we estimate abnormal returns
using four expected return models, namely, the market model, the
market model with GARCH errors, the Fama–French 3-factor model,
and the Carhart 4-factor model. Using multiple expected returns
models gives us some confidence that our CAAR estimates are not an
artifact standard asset pricing anomalies (Fama & French, 1996). For
example, the CAAR estimated using the Carhart 4-factor model can-
not be explained by traditional asset pricing factors such as market
excess returns, size, book-to-market ratio, and momentum.

Isolating the valuation effect of cryptocurrency-related name changes
is difficult as corporate name changes are usually associated with
abnormal stock price behavior. For example, Bosch and

Hirschey (1989) and Kot (2011) observe a positive stock price reac-
tion to name changes announced due to a business restructuring or a
merger or acquisition. However, they document a postannouncement
negative drift that largely canceled these valuation gains over the long
run. Because our primary objective is to measure the valuation effect
of including a cryptocurrency-related buzzword in the corporate
name, we exercise some precautions to avoid potential confounding
factors that may explain our results.
We identify all publicly listed firms in the Datastream database
that changed their corporate name at least once during the period
from January 2009 to May 2019 and whose latest corporate name
includes one or more cryptocurrency-related buzzwords. We consider
three cryptocurrency-related buzzwords, namely, “blockchain,”
“bitcoin,” or “crypto,” which allow us to identify corporate names sig-
naling some association with cryptocurrencies. This provides us with
an initial sample of 110 firms. Next, we exclude 56 firms from our
sample that already had a cryptocurrency-related buzzword in their
previous corporate name. This ensures that the corporate name
change announcement signals new information to the market partici-
pants regarding the firm's association with cryptocurrencies. Finally,
we exclude those firms from our sample that had any contaminating
events within the longest event window used in our analysis, 30 days
before the name change announcement to 50 days after the name
change announcement. We consider fresh equity offering, merger,
acquisition, spin-off, and going private before the name change as
contaminating events. This removes an additional 14 firms, and the
remaining 40 firms are used as the sample firms in this analysis.
Table A1 describes the step-by-step process used to generate the
sample of firms that have changed their corporate names to include
cryptocurrency-related buzzwords during the period from January
2009 to May 2019.
Because most corporate name changes are associated with abnor-
mal stock returns, we contrast the valuation effect of cryptocurrency-
related name change announcements with that of other corporate
name change announcements. For this comparison, we identify a con-
trol group of 11,949 firms that announced corporate name changes
during the sample period and where the new corporate name was
unrelated to cryptocurrencies. Panel A of Table A2 compares the sam-
ple firms and the control group firms based on three basic characteris-
tics: ME, Price, and Shares traded. ME is the average of daily ME
(dollar-denominated), Price is the average of daily closing price
(unadjusted and dollar-denominated), and Shares traded is the average
daily number of shares traded. All characteristics are calculated using
daily data in the pre-event window [−180, −30]. We find that as com-
pared with the control group firms, the sample firms tend to be con-
siderably smaller with lower-priced and less frequently traded stocks.
The average daily ME is $80.95 million for the sample firms and
$1033.71 million for the control firms. The average daily stock price is
$1.16 for the sample firms and $48.59 for the control firms.
Panels B and C of Table A2 show the difference between the
characteristics of sample firms and matched control firms after PSM
and MDM, respectively. Both matching methods reduce the differ-
ence between the characteristics of sample firms and control firms
considerably. For example, before matching, the average ME is
$80.95 million for sample firms and $1033.71 million for the control
group firms. After PSM (MDM), the average ME of the matched con-
trol firms is $96.86 ($81.2) million. MDM identifies a better-matched
control group than the PSM with a balance improvement of over 99%
overall characteristics.
Both PSM and MDM improve the balance in terms of variance
ratios. In particular, MDM leads to variance ratios that are very close
to 1 for all three characteristics. For each characteristic, the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic measures the maximum distance
between the empirical cumulative distribution functions between the
two groups, with a value of 0 indicating identical distributions and a
value of 1 indicating that there is no overlap between the two
distributions. MDM performs better than PSM with smaller
Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic values for all three characteristics. For
the subsequent analysis, we use the matched control firms identified
using MDM as the matched control group. However, the results
remain qualitatively similar to the matched control group identified
using PSM.
To ensure that the impact of cryptocurrency-related name change
is free from any bias induced by extreme observations, we also com-
pute CAAR of the outlier-adjusted sample firms. The outlier-adjusted
sample comprises all sample firms except those that fall in the top
10% or bottom 10% in terms of the cumulative abnormal return gen-
erated over the period from Day −30 to Day 50.
Hence, we estimate CAAR for three sets of firms: sample firms,
outlier-adjusted sample firms, and matched control firms using four
expected return models as stated earlier. Among them, the Fama–
French 3-factor model and the Carhart 4-factor model require addi-
tional data of three Fama–French factors and the Momentum factor,
which are obtained from Kenneth French's data library at daily interval.
6 | EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
6.1 | Descriptive statistics
Table A3 reports some descriptive statistics for sample firms and mat-
ched control firms around the date of the name change announce-
ment. Considering the event day as Day 0, the pre-event period refers
to the period from Day −30 to Day −1, and the post-event period
refers to the period from Day +1 to Day +30. Unadjusted price ($) is
the daily average of unadjusted dollar-denominated closing price.
Return (%) and std. dev. of return (%) denote the average daily return
and its standard deviation. The table further reports the logarithmic
value of average daily volume of trades along with their standard devi-
ation and the logarithmic value of average daily ME for all sample and
matched control firms. All statistics are calculated using daily data.
The average price of both sample and matched control firms
increases on the event day as compared with the average price in the
pre-event period. However, sample firms experience a much higher
increase in price than the matched control firms. The average price for
sample (matched control) firms increases by 43.1% (10.78%), from an

average price of $1.48 ($1.002) in the pre-event period to $2.119
($1.11) at the end of Day 0. The sample firms also experience a
greater increase in return, volume, and ME on the event day as com-
pared with the matched control firms. A similar pattern is followed in
the post-event period. In the post-event period, the sample firms con-
tinue to experience a greater increase in trading price, return, volume,
and ME as compared with matched control firms.
The result suggests that, in general, corporate name change
announcements have a positive effect on share prices and investor
interest reflected by greater trading volume. This increase in share
price and volume persists for at least some time after the event day.
On an average, cryptocurrency-related name changes generate larger
gains in share price and volume than other corporate name changes.
6.2 | Do cryptocurrency-related name change
announcements generate valuation gains?
Table A4 reports the CAAR generated over different event windows
for all three set of firms. We find that both sample and matched con-
trol firms experience positive and significant valuation gains close to
the name change announcement date. However, these valuation gains
for sample firms are larger and more persistent than those of matched
control firms. To measure these differences statistically, we have per-
formed a Welch t test. Using the Carhart 4-factor model, we estimate
that the sample (control) firms generate 14.2% (13.6%) CAAR for the
event window [−1, +1]. This difference in valuation gains between
these two sets of firms is statistically insignificant (Welch
t stat = 1.051). This evinces that the sample firms are not unique in
generating abnormal positive returns close to the name change
announcement. However, further investigation reveals that for the
control group firms, most of the valuation gains are concentrated only
within the event window [0, +1]. Beyond that, such valuation gains do
not exist for control firms. In contrast, the sample firms continue to
generate positive abnormal returns for several days surrounding the
event day. For example, sample (control) firms generate a CAAR of
23.3% (14.5%), 32.2% (15.9%), and 28.0% (13.4%) in 7, 9, and 11 trad-
ing days surrounding the event date, respectively. The Welch
t statistics computed for these three windows are 1.969, 1.853, and
1.764. These significant differences in valuation gains suggest that the
impact of name change announcements is more prominent for sample
firms compared with that of matched control firms. Figure B1a,b,
which plots CAAR estimates and corresponding t statistics obtained
from the Carhart 4-factor model for the various event windows, fur-
ther corroborates our findings. It is evident from the plots that the
impact of name change announcements of control firms is only signifi-
cant on event date. However, for the sample firms, the impact is much
higher and lasting. Irrespective of the choice of the expected returns
model, CAAR generated in the event window [−5, +5] by the sample
firms is almost twice that of the control firms. Although the estimated
CAAR is positive and significant for both sample and control firms
over the event window [−5, +5]—approximately 2 weeks around the
name change announcement—we find no evidence of long-term
persistence of these valuation gains for either the sample firms or the
control firms.
Over the longest event window, [−30, 50]—approximately
10 weeks around the name change announcement—the CAAR gener-
ated by both sample firms and control firms is positive but statistically
indistinguishable from zero. During these 10 weeks, sample firms gen-
erate CAAR of 5.1% (t statistic = 0.176), and control firms generate
CAAR of 7.2% (t statistic = 0.530). Interestingly, the long-term esti-
mates of CAAR are highly sensitive to the choice of expected returns
model. For example, the CAAR estimated over these 10 weeks is
43.5% (t statistic = 1.826) for the sample firms when abnormal returns
are measured using the market model. This finding suggests that the
sample firms did generate large stock returns over a longer window.
However, most of these returns can be explained by the standard
asset pricing factors. Using expected returns specifications that ignore
these asset pricing factors, such as the market model, may lead to mis-
leading estimates of valuation gains generated over a long horizon.
Kothari and Warner (2004) note that it is important to use size, book-
to-market, and momentum factors to measure the abnormal returns,
irrespective of whether these factors indicate inefficiency or serve as
a proxy for risk. Our findings support their recommendation and sug-
gest that using the market model to measure abnormal returns can be
particularly problematic for long-horizon event studies.
The outlier-adjusted sample produces a similar pattern of CAAR
as that of the sample firms. Immediately following the name change
announcement, the outlier-adjusted sample produces positive and sig-
nificant valuation gains, whereas, over the long run, these gains are
statistically indistinguishable from zero. Thus, there is evidence of
short-term valuation gains around cryptocurrency-related name
change announcements even when we remove the more extreme
observations.
A plausible explanation for observing positive and significant
CAAR could be industry-specific shocks, such as a regulatory change
or a shift in investor sentiment around cryptocurrencies. For example,
19 of the 40 cryptocurrency-related name change announcements for
the sample firms were clustered over the period from October 2017
to February 2018, close to the all-time high price of bitcoin $19,783
achieved on December 17, 2017. It may, therefore, be argued that the
observed valuation gains for the sample firms may be due to a preva-
iling favorable investor sentiment during this period,and not due to
the name change announcement. To remove the effect of the factors
that influence the cryptocurrency industry, we estimate CAAR for our
sample firms using the industry-adjusted market model similar to the
one used by McGuire and Dilts (2008). For the industry-adjusted mar-
ket model, abnormal returns are estimated using a market model
where the market factor is substituted by a cryptocurrency industry
index. The cryptocurrency industry index is calculated as a value-
weighted index of 56 cryptocurrency firms that did not change their
names during the sample period. Because cryptocurrency firms are
not classified under the standard industry classification schemes such
as the SIC or the Global Industry Classifications Standard (GICS), we
use Worldscope's extended business descriptions to identify these
firms.

Using the industry-adjusted market model can be problematic if
the sample firms are considerably different from the firms that com-
prise the cryptocurrency industry index. For example, if sample firms
have much smaller ME than the constituent firms of the crypto-
currency industry index, the estimated abnormal returns could be an
artifact of the “size effect.” To test whether the sample firms have
significantly different characteristics than the firms that comprise
the cryptocurrency industry index, we estimate a logistic regression
to model the likelihood of name change among the set of all crypto-
currency firms. We use a combined sample of 40 sample firms that
changed their names and 56 cryptocurrency firms that did not
change their names during the sample period. The dependent vari-
able is an indicator variable, which equals 1 if the firm changed its
name during the sample period and 0 otherwise. The following firm
characteristics are used as explanatory variables. lnME is the loga-
rithm of the average daily ME (dollar-denominated). lnPrice is the
logarithm of the average of daily closing price (unadjusted, dollar-
denominated). lnVolume is the logarithm of the average of daily
number of shares traded. Volatility is the standard deviation of daily
returns. Profitability is the average return on invested capital, Lever-
age is the average of the ratio of the book value of total debt to
book value of common equity, and Tangibility is the average of the
ratio of net tangible assets to total assets. The exponentiated coeffi-
cients (odds ratios) for the logistic regression are reported in
Table A5. The results suggest that the sample firms are comparable
with the firms that comprise the cryptocurrency industry index in
terms of all firm characteristics, with the exception of lnVolume,
which is lower for the sample firms.
The last row of Table A4 reports the CAAR estimated using the
industry-adjusted market model. We find that the sample firms
comfortably outperform the value-weighted cryptocurrency index,
producing an industry-adjusted CAAR of 17.3% (t statistic = 2.111)
and 21.8% (t statistic = 2.074) over the event windows [0, +1] and
[−5, +5], respectively. The results suggest that the short-term
valuation gains experienced by sample firms cannot be attributed to
some latent industry-wide phenomena.
From Figure B1a,b, we find no evidence of significant abnormal
return generated prior to name change announcement day. Over the
30-day period from Day −30 to Day −1, the estimated CAAR is
12.57% (t statistic = 1.079) for sample firms and −6.59% (t statistic =
−0.751) for control firms. Immediately following the announcement,
both sets of firms experience sharp valuation gains. However, the
sample firms experience larger valuation gains than the matched con-
trol firms. Most of the valuation gain for the matched control firms
occurs on the event day, and their CAAR plot flattens after Day 0. In
contrast, the sample firms continue to experience valuation gains until
6 days after the event day. Over the event window [0, 6], sample
firms and matched control firms generate a CAAR of 29.27%
(t statistic = 2.918) and 14.56% (t statistic = 1.807), respectively. After
Day 6, the sample firms experience a postannouncement negative
drift that largely offsets these short-term valuation gains. The results
support hypotheses H1a and H2a, insofar as cryptocurrency-related
name changes generate much larger valuation gains than other
corporate name changes. Nonetheless, these valuation gains are tran-
sient, and they dissipate almost entirely by Day 29 (refer Figure B1a).
6.3 | Robustness test
Apart from computing abnormal returns for outlier-adjusted sample
firms and sample firms using the industry-adjusted market model,
we have employed additional robustness tests to investigate
the impact of including a cryptocurrency-related buzzword in the
corporate name.
6.3.1 | Effect of cryptocurrency-related name
change announcements on trading volume
For each firm k, we define relative volume on trading day t as the ratio
of the number of shares traded on that day (nkt) to the total number
of shares outstanding (Skt). The raw measures of daily trading volume,
such as relative volume, usually display a significant positive skew.
However, a log transformation yields trading volume measures that
are approximately normally distributed (see, for example, Ajinkya &
Jain, 1989; Cready & Ramanan, 1991). We estimate a daily measure
of log-transformed relative volume, Vkt (hereafter referred to as vol-
ume for brevity), as follows:
Vkt = log
nkt
Skt
� �
:
We use the mean-adjusted daily volume as the measure of abnormal
volume, AVkt.
AVkt =Vkt− �Vk ,
where �Vk is the mean trading volume, calculated as the daily
average of trading volume Vkt estimated over the pre-event window
[−180, −31] (hereafter referred to as the pre-event period).
The cumulative average abnormal volume (CAAV) over the event
window [t1, t2] is estimated as follows:
CAAVpq =
Xt2
t = t1
XN
k =1
AVkt,
whereN is the total number of firms and
PN
k =1AVkt is the AAV on day t.
Table A6 reports the CAAV over the event windows considered
in Table A4. For all three sets of firms, and across all event windows,
the estimated CAAV is positive and significant. Thus, in general, the
trading volume on days around the name change announcement
exceeds the daily average of trading volume during the pre-event
period. However, the CAAV estimates for sample firms are consider-
ably larger than those obtained for the matched control firms, indicat-
ing that the increase in trading volume around cryptocurrency-related
name change announcements is particularly large. Across all event

windows, the CAAV estimates for the sample firms are always close
to or more than four standard errors from 0, whereas for the matched
control firms, they are about two standard errors from 0.
Over a period from Day 0 to Day +1, we estimate a CAAV of
4.018 (t statistic = 4.923) for the sample firms and a CAAV of 1.857
(t statistic = 1.954) for the matched control firms. This suggests that
during this 2-day period, the daily relative volume of sample firms
(matched control firms) is 7.46 (2.53) times of that observed during
the pre-event period. For the longest event window [−30, 50], we
estimate a CAAV of 100.899 (t statistic = 4.684) for the sample firms
and a CAAV of 58.530 (t statistic = 2.133) for the matched control
firms. This suggests that during this 81-day period, the daily relative
volume of sample firms (matched control firms) is 3.47 (2.05) times
that observed during the pre-event period.
Figure B2a plots the daily AAV estimates for all three sets of
firms, and Figure B2b plots the corresponding t-statistics for these
AAV estimates. We find that sample firms begin to experience pos-
itive and significant abnormal trading volume much earlier than the
matched control firms. For example, approximately 5 weeks before
the name change announcement, on Day −25, we estimate an
AAV of 1.302 (t statistic = 3.529) for sample firms and an AAV of
0.512 (t statistic = 1.295). Over the 30-day period from Day −30
to Day −1, none of the 30 AAV estimates for matched control
firms are more than two standard errors from 0, whereas 21 out
of 30 AAV estimates for sample firms are more than two standard
errors from 0.
Both sample firms and matched control firms witness an increase
in trading volume on the event day. However, we find that the trading
volume for sample firms increases much more sharply than that of the
matched control firms. We estimate an AAV of 2.066
(t statistic = 4.751) for sample firms and an AAV of 1.12
(t statistic = 2.334) for matched control firms on Day 0. The relative
volume of sample firms (matched control firms) on the event day is
7.89 (3.06) times that observed during the pre-event period. These
findings are consistent with the hypotheses H2a and H2b. Moreover,
this increase in trading volume is persistent, and it is robust to the
exclusion of outliers from the set of sample firms. For all three sets of
firms, we find the AAV estimates remain positive and significant even
10 weeks after the event day. Thus, there is evidence of a large and
stable increase in investor interest after the name change
announcement.
6.3.2 | Can bid-ask bounce or the prevailing
sentiment towards cryptocurrencies explain the
abnormal returns?
The large valuation gains observed around name change announce-
ments could be due to an upward bias in measuring abnormal returns.
This upward bias may be caused by the bid-ask bounce effect
(Conrad & Kaul, 1993) or by a failure to account for substantial trans-
action costs emanating from wide bid-ask spreads of these relatively
illiquid stocks. To examine the relation between bid-ask spread and
abnormal returns, we estimate the average relative bid-ask spread for
all sample firms. For each day t, the relative bid-ask spread is calcu-
lated as (askt − bidt)/((askt + bidt)/2). The average relative bid-ask
spread is the average of the daily relative bid-ask spread estimated
over the pre-event window [−180, −31]. Then, we estimate the
cross-sectional correlation between CAR generated by sample firms
and their corresponding relative bid-ask spread. The cumulative
abnormal return, CARk, pq, for a sample firm k, over the event window
[p,q] is estimated as follows:
CARk, pq =
Xq
t = p
ARkt:
If the large abnormal returns are caused by upward bias induced by a
bid-ask bounce or by the failure to account for transaction costs, one
should expect a positive association between CAR and relative bid-
ask spread. Table A7 reports the cross-sectional association between
CAR and the average relative bid-ask spread for two event windows:
[0, +1] and [−30, +50]. For both periods, we find no evidence of a
positive and significant cross-sectional association between CAR and
the average relative bid-ask spread. Therefore, the observed valuation
gains are unlikely to be an artifact of microstructure induced upward
bias in the abnormal return estimates. The findings support
hypothesis H3a.
The cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile and prone to
speculative bubbles (Cheah & Fry, 2015; Fry & Cheah, 2016), and
therefore, the investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies varies
considerably over time. Intuitively, one would expect the observed
valuation gains following cryptocurrency-related name change
announcements should be positively related to the investor sentiment
around cryptocurrencies. Specifically, large valuation gains should be
observed in periods in which investors are positive about the pros-
pects of cryptocurrencies. Following Baig et al. (2019), we proxy
investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies using Google Trends
data. Weekly interest over time in the search terms “Bitcoin” and
“Blockchain” was extracted from Google Trends data for the period
from March 1, 2014 to May 31, 2018, which includes all event dates
for our sample firms. The search interest over time is represented as a
normalized index varying from 0 to 100 with 0 (100) representing the
lowest (highest) search interest in the search term over the period
from March 1, 2014 to May 31, 2018. We match each firm's event
date with the closest weekly value of the Google Trend Index. Then,
we define two proxy variables to represent investor sentiment
towards cryptocurrencies close to or at the event date, namely,
lnBitcoinTrend and lnBlockchainTrend. lnBitcoinTrend and
lnBlockchainTrend are the logarithms of the Google Trend Index value
for the search term “Bitcoin” and “Blockchain,” respectively. Table A7
reports the cross-sectional association between CAR and the crypto-
currency sentiment variables for two event windows: [0, +1] and
[−30, +50]. We find that the association between lnBitcoinTrend and
the CAR generated by sample firms is positive and significant for both
event windows. The association between lnBlockchainTrend and CAR
is also positive, although it is weaker in terms of statistical

significance. This suggests that the valuation gains tend to be higher
when the name change announcements happen during periods of high
sentiment for cryptocurrencies. The positive and significant associa-
tion between CAR and sentiment for cryptocurrencies supports
hypothesis H3b.
To estimate or quantify the (treatment) effect of including a
cryptocurrency-related buzzword in the corporate name on firms'
valuation as accurate as possible, a great care should be taken
when defining the determinants of the valuation gains. Because
the valuation gains are measured by positive abnormal returns
earned by these corporates, we have identified various firm level
characteristics and bitcoin momentum that may potentially explain
such abnormal gains. Table A8 explores the determinants of these
valuation gains by regressing CAR on these explanatory variables.
The dependent variable, firm-level CAR, is measured using the
Carhart 4-factor model over different event windows surrounding
the name change announcement. The explanatory variables are
estimated using daily data in the pre-event window [−180, −31].
We use six firm-level characteristics as explanatory variables: lnME
is the logarithm of the average of daily ME (dollar-denominated);
lnPrice is the logarithm of the average of daily closing price
(unadjusted, dollar-denominated); lnSharesTraded is the logarithm
of the average of daily number of shares traded; MoM is the
annualized daily dollar-denominated return, and StdDev is the stan-
dard deviation of these daily returns; and USFirms is an indicator
variable equal to one for the U.S. firms and zero for other firms.
The indicator variable serves as a proxy to examine whether the
prevalence of adding a cryptocurrency-related keyword to corpo-
rate names and the subsequent generation of abnormal returns is a
function of country-specific regulatory oversight. For instance, the
U.S. SEC has repeatedly warned companies with no meaningful
track record in pursuing the distributed ledger technology against
misleading investors by changing their corporate names to capital-
ize on the perceived promise of blockchains. In addition, we use
the pre-event momentum of bitcoin returns, MoMBTC, as the annu-
alized daily dollar-denominated return of Bitcoin estimated over
the pre-event window [−180, −31].
The results suggest that valuation gains generated around name
change announcement are largely unrelated to pre-event stock and
firm characteristics, and they are not significantly different for the
U.S. and the non-U.S. firms. With the exception of StdDev, which
displays a weak negative relation with future CAR, none of the
other pre-event firm-level variables display a significant relation with
future CAR. The regression coefficient for StdDev is negative across
all event windows. However, it is statistically significant for only
two out of the nine event windows we consider. The most reliable
predictor of future CAR in our regressions is MoMBTC, which shows
a positive relation with future CAR across all event windows, and
the relation is statistically significant for seven out of nine event
windows. These results support hypothesis H3b and suggest that
valuation gains around name change announcements tend to be
larger (smaller) when bitcoin returns displayed high (low) momentum
during the pre-event period.
6.4 | Do insiders exploit these valuation gains
better than other groups of investors?
The CAAR plot of sample firms (Figure B1a) is reminiscent of a classi-
cal pump and dump scheme featuring a dramatic short-term increase
in prices till Day +6, followed by a negative drift until almost all of the
valuation gains are reversed around Day +29. If cryptocurrency-
related name changes are indeed a ploy to capitalize on the sentiment
surrounding cryptocurrencies, it is likely that insiders with prior
knowledge of the future name change would be able to outperform
other groups of investors in exploiting these valuation gains.
We classify the largest shareholders of the sample firms into two
groups, namely, investment managers and strategic entities using the
Thompson ONE Banker classification. Table A9 examines the changes
in the positions of investment managers and strategic entities for our
sample firms over different periods surrounding the name change
announcement. Panel A reports the mean position change for the
investment managers and the strategic entities in six periods: during
the two quarters before the event (−Q2 and −Q1), during the second
quarter before the event (−Q2), during the first quarter before the
event (−Q1), during the first quarter after the event (+Q1), during the
second quarter after the event (+Q2), and during the two quarters
after the event (+Q1 and +Q2). Panel B lists the results of equality
tests within the investor group and between the two investor groups
over these periods. Consistent with hypothesis H4, we find that stra-
tegic entities increased their holdings substantially more than the
investment managers during the preannouncement periods. In the
two quarters before the name change announcement, the average
position of strategic entities (β̂1) increased by 16.956%
(t statistic = 3.048), whereas that of investment managers ðα̂1)
increased by 6.074% (t statistic = 1.944), and the difference between
the two groups α̂1− β̂1
� �
is statistically significant. Due to a greater
increase in positions prior to the name change announcement, the
strategic entities stand to gain more than the investment managers
from the valuation gains following the name change announcement.
The position changes in the postannouncement period are much
smaller. In the two quarters after the name change announcement,
the mean position change for investment managers is 0.016%
(t statistic = 0.068), whereas it is 2.198% (t statistic = 1.715) for the
strategic entities. Also, the difference between the two groups
α̂6− β̂6
� �
is statistically indistinguishable from zero. This is expected
as after the name change announcement, the strategic entities have
no informational advantage over other groups of investors.
7 | CONCLUSION
We measure the effect of cryptocurrency-related corporate name
changes on shareholder value. Despite being a costly signaling mecha-
nism, corporate name changes that imply some association with
blockchains and cryptocurrencies engender significant investor inter-
est. We find that cryptocurrency-related name changes generate large
valuation gains. However, these gains are not persistent, and they are

almost entirely reversed within 30 days after the announcement. The
abnormal returns cannot be explained by standard asset pricing fac-
tors, by the firm and stock characteristics, by some industry-specific
shock, or by few outlier firms that generate outsized returns around
their name change announcement. In contrast, we find that the con-
temporaneous sentiment around cryptocurrencies has a positive and
significant association with abnormal returns. More specifically, the
observed valuation gains tend to be higher when the name change
announcements happen during periods of high sentiment for
cryptocurrencies.
On an average, cryptocurrency-related name changes produce a
larger increase in stock price and trading volume than those produced
by corporate name changes unrelated to cryptocurrencies. There is
some evidence that insiders with private information regarding
impending name change announcement can front-run other share-
holders in building long positions in the stock. We find that strategic
entities outperform investment managers in exploiting the valuation
gains associated with cryptocurrency-related name change
announcements.
We hope that the findings of this study will be useful for both
market participants and regulators. Our results suggest that inves-
tors should exercise caution before investing in firms that
announce a cryptocurrency-related corporate name change without
a meaningful track record in the commercial use of blockchain
technology. For example, one of the firms in our sample, Riot
Blockchain, has repeatedly changed its name, even when name
change has material costs for the business. Equity analysts and
investors should critically examine whether such strategic change
implied by a name change would indeed result in a material
improvement in the firm's business prospects. From the perspective
of equity market regulators, our results motivate a need for a for-
mal policy to curb the practice of using deceptive or misleading
corporate names. The stock price behavior around cryptocurrency-
related name changes is remarkably similar to a pump and dump
scheme characterized by a sudden run-up in stock prices due to
false and misleading positive information, followed by a reversal as
stock prices revert to the original value.

APPENDIX A
TABLE A1 Description of the sample
Selection of sample firms:
Publicly listed firms in Datastream that changed their corporate name at least
once during the period from January 2009 to May 2019 and whose latest
corporate name includes one or more cryptocurrency-related buzzwords.
110
Deleted firms that already had a cryptocurrency-related buzzword in their
previous corporate name.
56
Deleted firms that had any contaminating event(s) within the period from 30
days before the name change announcement to 50 days after the name
change announcement
14
Total number of remaining firms 40
Note: This table describes the process used to generate the sample of firms that have changed their corporate names to include cryptocurrency-related
buzzwords during the period from January 2009 to May 2019. We consider three cryptocurrency-related buzzwords, namely, “blockchain,” “bitcoin,” or
“crypto.” Contaminating events include fresh equity offering, merger, acquisition, spin-off, and going private before the name change announcement.
TABLE A2 Identifying control group using matching

Shares traded 76182.80 69356.24 6826.55 85.23 0.9744 0.25
Panel C: difference between treatment and control groups after Mahalanobis matching

Price 1.16 1.07 0.09 99.81 0.9629 0.23
Shares traded 76182.80 76194.53 −11.73 99.97 1.0001 0.03
Note: This table describes the balance between sample and control firms based on three characteristics: ME, Price, and Shares traded. ME is the average of
daily market capitalization (dollar-denominated), Price is the average of daily closing price (unadjusted, dollar-denominated), and Shares traded is the
average of daily number of shares traded. All characteristics are calculated using daily data in the pre-event window [−180, −30]. First two columns report
the mean values for these variables for sample firms and control firms, respectively. Mean difference is the difference between Columns 1 and 2. Column 4
reports the percentage improvement in balance after using a matching method to identify a suitable control group for the sample firms. For a particular
characteristic, the variance ratio column reports ratio of variance of the sample group to the variance of the control group. For each characteristic, the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic measures the difference between the empirical cumulative distribution functions between the two groups, with a value of 0
indicating identical distributions and a value of 1 indicating that there is no overlap between the two distributions. Panel A reports the difference in mean
of market ME, Price, and Volume between sample and control firms before any matching has been done. Panels B and C report the percentage
improvement in balance between these two groups of firms using propensity score matching and Mahalanobis matching, respectively.

Note: This table reports the exponentiated coefficients (odds ratios) for a logistic regression that models the likelihood of name change among
cryptocurrency firms using a combined sample of 40 sample firms that changed their names and 56 cryptocurrency firms that did not change their names
during the sample period. The dependent variable is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm changed its name during the sample period and 0
otherwise. All firm-level explanatory variables are estimated using daily data for the full sample period. lnME is the logarithm of the average of daily market
capitalization (dollar-denominated). lnPrice is the logarithm of the average of daily closing price (unadjusted, dollar-denominated). lnVolume is the logarithm
of the average of daily number of shares traded. Volatility is the standard deviation of daily returns. Profitability is the average return on invested capital,
leverage is the average of the ratio of book value of total debt to book value of common equity, tangibility is the average of the ratio of net tangible assets
to total assets. This table reports the exponentiated logistic coefficients (odds ratios). t statistics are provided in parentheses below the estimated
coefficients.
*Indicates significance at 10% level.
**Indicates significance at 5% level.
***Indicates significance at 1% level.

Note: This table reports cumulative average abnormal volume (CAAV) for all sample firms that have changed their names by including buzzwords like
“blockchain,” “bitcoin,” or “crypto” in between January 2009 and May 2019. The abnormal volumes are calculated for various event windows where the
events are the announcement of name change. Each cell reports the CAAV across all firms for the respective event windows. The table compares the
CAAVs of sample firms with outlier-adjusted sample firms and price, volume, and market cap matched control firms (matched control group) using market
model (MM). t statistics are reported in parentheses.
*Indicates significance at 10% level.
**Indicates significance at 5% level.
***Indicates significance at 1% level.

Note: This table reports the correlation of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) with search interest and average relative spread. The cumulative abnormal
returns (CAR) are measured using Carhart's 4-factor model. Weekly interest over time in the search terms “Bitcoin” and “Blockchain” was extracted from
Google Trends data for the period from March 1, 2014 to May 31, 2018, which includes all event dates for our sample firms. The search interest over time
is represented as a normalized index varying from 0 to 100 with 0 (100) representing the lowest (highest) search interest in the search term over the
period from March 1, 2014 to May 31, 2018. We match each firm's event date with the closest weekly value of the Google Trend Index. lnBitcoinTrend
and lnBlockchainTrend are the logarithms of the Google Trend Index value for the search term “Bitcoin” and “Blockchain,” respectively. For each day t, the
relative bid-ask spread is calculated as (askt − bidt)/((askt+bidt)/2). The average relative spread is the average of the daily relative bid-ask spread estimated
over the pre-event window [−180, −31]. t statistics are provided in parenthesis below the estimated correlation coefficients.
*Indicates significance at 10% level.
**Indicates significance at 5% level.
***Indicates significance at 1% level.
