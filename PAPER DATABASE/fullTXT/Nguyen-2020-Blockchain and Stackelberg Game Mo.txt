Abstract—Roaming fraud is one of the most significant finan-
cial losses for mobile service providers. The inefficiency of current
exchanging data management methods among mobile service
providers is the main obstacle for roaming fraud prevention. In
this paper, we introduce a novel blockchain-based data exchange
management system to address roaming fraud problems in mobile
networks. This system provides a secure and automatic data
exchange service among mobile service providers and mobile
subscribers. In addition, we introduce an emerging Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) consensus mechanism for the proposed blockchain-based
roaming fraud prevention system, which can significantly reduce
the delay in exchanging information as well as implementation
costs for mobile service providers. To further enhance benefits
and security efficiency for the proposed blockchain system, we
develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game. This
game model is very effective in maximizing profits for both the
stakeholders and stake pool and useful in designing a robust
blockchain-based mobile roaming management system. Through
performance analysis and numerical results, we show that our
proposed framework not only provides an effective solution to
prevent mobile roaming fraud but also opens many business
opportunities for future mobile networks.
Keywords- Blockchain, Proof-of-Stake, mobile roaming
fraud, and Stackelberg game.
I. INTRODUCTION
Despite the continuous revenue growth, mobile service
providers (MSPs) have been facing several obstacles, espe-
cially fraud attacks which cause over $32.7 billion annual
loss1. Among many types of fraud attacks, roaming fraud is
the most harmful type which can cause significant losses up
to e40,000 per hour in some incidents2. Roaming fraudsters
often exploit the current inefficient data exchange management
method between two MSPs for free-riding roaming service
usage. In particular, when a subscriber gains access to the
services of the Home Public Mobile Network (HPMN) via
the Visited Public Mobile Network (VPMN), the HPMN may
not be able to charge the subscriber properly due to the long
delay in exchanging data between the two networks. However,
the HPMN still has to pay the VPMN for using the VPMN’s
roaming facilities [1].
Currently, the roaming fraud protection system employs
several countermeasures, such as frequently validating sub-
scriber’s information and limiting service usage, which cause

several negative impacts on the quality of service and cus-
tomer satisfaction [1]. Besides these preventive measures, the
roaming fraud protection system also collects and examines
roaming data, e.g., call records, to detect and respond if fraud
attacks occur. In the current fraud protection system, data
collection is the weakest step due to the significant delay in
data exchange between MSPs [1]. Generally, methods such as
Fraud Information Gathering System [2] and Near Real Time
Roaming Data Exchange (NRTRDE) [3] can be employed
to speed up the data exchanging process. However, the first
method can only support data exchange in a near real-time
manner for a limited number of subscribers, meanwhile the
data exchange delay of NRTRDE is high, i.e., more than 4
hours [3]. In practice, it is reported that a fraudulent SIM
can use up to 18 hours of service on average before being
detected2. Consequently, the significant delay in data exchange
remains a big challenge to the current roaming fraud protection
system.
Recently, blockchain technology has emerged to be a se-
cured and effective solution for data management in many de-
centralized networks thanks to its advantages of transparency,
decentralization, and immutability. Organizations including
Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom3, IBM4, and Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance5 have announced their blockchain-based
solutions for roaming, focusing on identity management, au-
tomating billing processes, and fraud prevention. However,
these solutions are still under development and facing some
challenges. Specifically, most current blockchain-based data
management systems are employing the Proof-of-Work (PoW)
mechanism [4] which relies on a computational power com-
petition between the participants to reach the consensus.
Consequently, the PoW mechanism requires a huge energy
consumption, e.g., the Bitcoin network consumes more energy
than that of some countries6, and has a significant delay, i.e.,
one hour on average [5]. To overcome these limitations, a new
consensus mechanism, namely Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [5], [6],
[7], has been developed recently, in which the consensus can be
achieved only by proving stake ownership. As a result, the PoS
mechanism has many advantages, including negligible energy

consumption and especially very low consensus delay, over
the PoW mechanism [5]. With these advantages, PoS-based
blockchain is expected to be a very effective solution to deal
with roaming fraud for future mobile networks.
In this paper, we develop a novel PoS-based blockchain
framework for mobile roaming service management. Among
the PoS consensus mechanisms introduced recently, we adopt
the Ouroboros consensus mechanism [6] which has several
significant advantages, including low delay (2 minutes on aver-
age7) and the ability to mitigate various types of attacks [5]. In
a PoS-based blockchain network, user participation is crucial
to maintain the network’s operations and security. Therefore,
we propose an economic model based on Stackelberg game to
incentivize user participation by jointly maximizing the users’
profits. Through performance analysis and numerical results,
we then show that our proposed blockchain-based roaming
framework can not only prevent mobile roaming fraud but also
open new business opportunities for future mobile networks.
II. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ROAMING SYSTEM
A. Current Roaming System
The current roaming management system is illustrated in
Fig. 1(a) [1]. In particular, firstly, a roaming pact is established
between two MSPs. Then, when a subscriber wants to use the
service of the HPMN while being in the VPMN, the subscriber
sends a request to the VPMN. The VPMN then queries
the HPMN about the subscriber’s information and subscribed
services. After receiving confirmation from the HPMN about
the subscription, the VPMN grants the subscriber access to
the corresponding services through roaming facilities. The
Call Detail Records (CDRs), consisting of the call duration,
source and destination of the services, are then sent to a Data
Clearing House (DCH). This DCH operates as a middleman to
validate and transmit the CDRs to the HPMN. Once the HPMN
receives the CDRs, it will pay the VPMN in accordance with
the roaming pact [1].
B. Proposed Roaming System
Our proposed roaming system provides a platform for
roaming management which not only supports and automates
complex interactions among the MSPs and subscribers, but it
also provides a universal currency, i.e., blockchain network
tokens, for payments. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the main
procedure of the roaming management platform consists of
seven steps as follows:
• Step 1: Two MSPs negotiate a roaming pact containing
tariff plans for roaming services and payment agreements
between the two MSPs. The roaming pact is then stored
in the blockchain as a smart contract, i.e., a user-defined
program which is automatically enforced when the con-
ditions stated in the smart contract are met [8].
• Step 2: When a subscriber wants to use the services at a
VPMN, the subscriber queries the VPMN to receive the
information about available services and tariff plans.
7https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/proof-of-stake/
• Step 3: If the subscriber decides to use the service,
the subscriber sends a transaction containing a sufficient
amount of digital tokens as defined by the tariff plans to
the smart contract’s address.
• Step 4: The VPMN will grant the subscriber access
to roaming facilities once the transaction in step 3 is
successfully sent to the smart contract.
• Step 5: When the subscriber finishes using roaming ser-
vices, the VPMN sends a transaction containing CDR data
of the services provided to the smart contract’s address.
• Step 6: The smart contract then automatically calculates
and sends the subscriber’s invoice to the HPMN. A trans-
action from the HPMN to the VPMN is also triggered by
the smart contract for the payment of roaming services.
• Step 7: The smart contract sends the remaining tokens to
the subscriber.
C. Security Analysis of the Proposed Roaming System
By adopting the Ouroboros consensus mechanism, our
proposed roaming management system can achieve a very
small delay in exchanging data compared to that of the
current roaming systems. In particular, it takes approximately
20 seconds to add a block to the chain and 3 minutes to
confirm a transaction8. As a result, fraud attacks can be
detected approximately 4 hours earlier compared to that of
the traditional roaming fraud protection system. Moreover,
the Ouroboros consensus mechanism is proven to be secured
against several types of attacks such as double-spending and
grinding attacks [6].
Nevertheless, there is one type of attack, namely 51%
attack [6], that can break most of blockchain networks, includ-
ing both the PoW-based and PoS-based blockchain networks.
Specifically, if an adversary can control more than 51% of
total computational power in a PoW-based network or 51% of
total stakes in a PoS-based network, the adversary can control
all transactions in the network, such as block new transactions
from taking place or being confirmed. Therefore, it is crucial to
attract more participants to the PoS-based blockchain system
in order to increase the network’s total stakes and protect
the system from an adversary in controlling the majority of
network stakes. In the next section, we will introduce an
effective economic model which can jointly maximize profits
for the participants, thereby encouraging them to participate
in the network and thus improving network security.
D. Stake Pools and Stakeholders
In the proposed system, the MSPs and subscribers also can
take part in the consensus mechanism and earn additional
profits for their participation. Specifically, in the PoS-based
blockchain network, a user is selected in advance to create a
block, and a reward, e.g., a number of digital tokens, is paid
to that user for the participation. The probability Pi that user
(stakeholder) i with stake Si is selected to create a block and
obtain the reward in a network of N users is:
Pi =
Si∑N

In (1), a stakeholder with a small Si is less likely to be
selected. Moreover, consensus participation requires a constant
connection to the network, which incurs an operational cost,
e.g., $40 to $300 per month9. Consequently, stakeholders often
pool their stakes together to increase their opportunities to
be selected and share operational costs, which results in the
formation of stake pool [5]. This stake pool formation can be
utilized to attract more users to the network as it can provide
additional profits for the stakeholders, e.g., the subscribers, and
the stake pool (formed by MSPs).
III. STACKELBERG GAME FORMULATION
We consider a PoS-based blockchain network with one stake
pool and a set N of N stakeholders. The stakeholders have
stake budgets B = (B1, . . . , BN ) and individual operational
costs C = (C1, . . . , CN ). The stake pool has its own stake
σ (i.e., the stakes that the pool’s owner invest to the pool)
and a fee α which is the profit margin of the pool’s owner,
e.g., Stakecube, a real-world stake pool, charges 3% of each
stakeholder’s reward10. A stakeholder i can use its budgets
to invest pi stakes to the pool and mi stakes to individually
participate in the consensus process, such that pi +mi ≤ Bi.
The probability Pw that the pool is selected to be the leader
and obtain a block reward R is
Pw =
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn

∑
n∈Np

∑N

, (2)
where Np is the set of stakeholders who invest stakes to
the pool. After receiving the reward R, the pool calculates
each stakeholder’s reward rpi based on the proportion P p
i of
stakeholder i’s stakes in the total stakes of the pool, which is
P p
i =
pi
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn
. (3)
The pool then charges a fee of α percentage from each
stakeholder’s reward before the reward is finally delivered to
9https://forum.cardano.org/t/how-many-stake-pools/16132/12
10https://cryptoshib.com/stakecube/
each stakeholder. Thus, when a stakeholder i invests pi stakes
to the pool, the stakeholder’s expected reward rpi is given by:
rpi = PwP p
i (1− α)R,

∑
n∈Np

When the stakeholder uses mi stakes for individual participa-
tion (i.e., self-mining), its expected reward is
rmi =
mi

∑
n∈Np

∑N
j=1 mj

where
mi
σ +
∑

represents the proportion

network. The total profit of the pool consists of the profit from
its own stakes, which is

and the fees it charges the stakeholders, which is

)
. (7)
In practice, a stake pool usually announces its fee first, e.g.,
the Stakecube pool’s fee is always declared on its website10.
Based on that information, the stakeholders will decide how
much to invest to the pool. Therefore, the interaction between
the stake pool and the stakeholders can be formulated as
a single-leader multi-followers Stackelberg game [9], which
consists of one leader (the pool) who declares its fee, i.e.,
sp = α first, and then the stakeholders, i.e., followers, will
decide how much to invest to the pool and/or for self-mining,
i.e., si(pi,mi). Let Si denote the set of all possible strategies
of follower i, the best response s∗i of follower i is the strategy
set which gives the follower the best payoff given a fixed
strategy sp of the leader, i.e.,
Ui(s
∗
i , sp) ≥ Ui(s
′
i, sp), ∀s′i ∈ Si. (8)

Based on the follower’s best response, the Stackelberg strategy
for the leader is a strategy s∗p such that
s∗p = argmax
sp
Up(sp, s
∗
i ). (9)
The Stackelberg solution then can be defined by a tuple
(s∗p, s
∗
i ), and its corresponding utility tuple (U∗
p , U
∗
i ) is the
Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. The game can be divided
into two stages. At the first stage, the leader announces its strat-
egy. Then, at the second stage, the followers determine their
strategies in response to the leader’s strategy. Using backward-
induction-based analysis, the Stackelberg equilibrium of this
game is determined in the following.
A. Follower Strategy
In this game, a follower’s possible strategies can be divided
into four cases:
• Case 1: Only invest stakes to the pool.
• Case 2: Only invest stakes for self-mining.
• Case 3: Simultaneously invest stakes to the pool and for
self-mining.
• Case 4: Do not invest stakes to the PoS-based blockchain
network.
Although a stakeholder can use any amount within its budget
to invest, we prove in the following theorem that a rational
follower will always invest all its budget to the network.
THEOREM 1. Let s′i denote a strategy where follower i
uses less than its total budget, i.e., m′
i + p′i < Bi, with
corresponding utility U ′
i , and si is a strategy where follower
i uses all its budget, i.e., mi + pi = Bi, with corresponding
utility Ui. For every s′i, si ∈ Si, we always have U ′
i < Ui.
Proof: We consider the Cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 as follows.
• Case 1: When follower i invests p′i to the pool, U ′1
i is
equal to rpi in (4). Now, if the follower invests all the
budget to the pool, its payoff is given by
U1
i =
Bi
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
(1− α)R. (10)
Then, the difference in payoff between the two strategies
is
U1
i −U ′1
i =
Bi − p′i
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
(1−α)R. (11)
Since p′i < Bi, U
1
i − U ′1
i > 0, ∀i ∈ N .
• Case 2: When follower i uses m′
i for self-mining, U ′2
i is
equal to rmi in (5). If the follower self-mines with all its
budget, its expected payoff is given by
U2
i =
BiR
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
− Ci. (12)
The difference in payoff between the two strategies is
U2
i − U ′2
i =
Bi −m′
i
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
R. (13)
Since m′
i < Bi, U
2
i − U ′2
i > 0, ∀i ∈ N .
• Case 3: When follower i simultaneously invests stakes to
the pool and self-mines using less than its total budget,
the expected payoff is
U ′3
i =
m′
i + p′i(1− α)
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
R− Ci. (14)
If the follower uses all the budget invest to the pool and
for self-mining, its expected payoff is
U3
i =
mi + pi(1− α)
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
R− Ci. (15)
The difference in payoff is
U3
i − U ′3
i =
(pi +mi)− (p′i +m′
i) + (p′i − pi)α
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
∑N
j=1 mj
R.
(16)
In (16), (pi+mi)−(p′i+m′
i) = Bi−(p′i+m′
i) is always
positive. Thus, if p′i < pi, U
3
i − U ′3
i is always positive.
• Case 4: In this case, follower i gets a payoff of U4
i =
0, which is less than the payoff of Cases 1, 2, and 3.
Moreover, if the follower does not invest any stake to
the blockchain network, the follower does not have any
impact on the game.
To sum up, in all cases, the follower always gets a greater
payoff by investing all its budget, regardless of the leader’s
strategy and other followers’ strategies.
From Theorem 1, since a follower will always invests all its
budget, the total network stakes becomes a constant, i.e.,
σ +
∑
n∈Np
pn +
N∑
j=1
mj = σ +
N∑
i=1
Bi. (17)
Then, we can determine the best response of each follower as
proven in Theorem 2.
THEOREM 2. A follower’s best response is to use all its
budget either to invest stakes to the pool or for self-mining.
Proof: The expected payoffs of follower i in Cases 1, 2,
and 3 are given by (10), (12), (15), respectively. The difference
in payoff between Case 2 and Case 3 can be calculated by
U2
i − U3
i =
piαR
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
, (18)
which is always positive. Therefore, Case 3 can be removed
from Si. Then, to maximize the profit, the follower can choose
Case 1 or Case 2. The difference in payoff is
U2
i − U1
i =
BiαR
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
− Ci. (19)
As observed from (19), if Ci <
BiαR
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
, the difference
is positive, which means that Case 2 yields more profits than
Case 1, and vice versa. Therefore, follower i’s best response
is to consider its investment threshold Ti which is given by
Ti =
Ci(σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn)
BiR
. (20)
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:40:00 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
In other words, if α ≤ Ti, follower i will invest all stakes to
the pool, otherwise it spends all stakes for self-mining.
Since from Theorem 1 we have p∗i = Bi − m∗
i , we can
represent the best response of follower i by p∗i . From Theorem
2, the best response p∗i can be expressed as follows:
p∗i (α) =
{
0 if α > Ti,
Bi if α ≤ Ti.
(21)
B. Leader Strategy
Based on the best responses of the followers, the Stackelberg
strategy s∗p of the leader can be determined by Theorem 3.
THEOREM 3. The optimal fee α∗ is equal to one of the
investment thresholds of the followers, i.e., α∗ = Tk, k ∈ N .
Proof: The pool’s optimal fee α∗ is the fee that maximizes
its utility, i.e.,
α∗ = argmax
α
(Mp + Up). (22)
As the total network stakes is a constant, Mp becomes con-
stant, and thus it does not need to be optimized. Thus, we only
need to consider the following utility function of the leader
Up =
∑
i∈Np
(
Biα
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
R
)
, (23)
which depends on the participants in Np. Without loss of
generality, we arrange the followers in the following order
Ci
Bi
≤ Ci+1
Bi+1
, ∀i ∈ N . As Np depends on α, i.e., the followers
choose to invest all stakes to the pool or for self-mining based
on α as shown in (21), Up can be represented as follows:
Up =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
∑N
i=1
(
Biα

if α ≤ TN ,
∑N−1

R
)
if TN < α ≤ TN−1,
. . . ,
B1α
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
R if T2 < α ≤ T1,
0 if α > T1.
(24)
In (24), Up is a piecewise function where each sub-function is
defined over an interval of α bounded by Ti (an example of Up
is shown in Fig. 2(c)). Moreover, since each sub-function is a
strictly increasing function of α, the unique maximum of each
sub-function is attained at the upper-boundary of the interval,
i.e., at α = Ti. Thus, the α∗ is equal to the upper-boundary of
a certain sub-function of Up, i.e., α∗ = Tk, k ∈ N such that

∑N
n=1 Bn
)
≥
l∑
i=1
(
BiTlR
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
)
, ∀l ∈ N .
(25)
Since (25) only contains constants, the leader’s Stackelberg
strategy can be straightforwardly determined. Assume that
α∗ = Tk is a Stackelberg strategy of the leader, the Stackelberg
utility of the leader can be determined as follows
U∗
p =
k∑
i=1
(
BiTk
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
R
)
. (26)
C. Existence and Uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium
Since there is a unique maximum of each sub-function
of Up, there exists at least one global maximum of Up. As
a result, there exists at least one Stackelberg utility of the
leader. Moreover, as can be seen from (8), there is a uniquely
defined response of each follower i for every fixed value of α.
Therefore, there exists at least one Stackelberg equilibrium of
this game. Although the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium
is proven, its uniqueness cannot be guaranteed, because there
may exist two or more sub-functions of Up with equal the
highest local maximum. Suppose that there is a Stackelberg
equilibrium at α∗ = Tk, if there exists one j ∈ N such that
k∑
i=1
(
BiTk
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
R
)
=
j∑
i=1
(
BiTj
σ +
∑N
n=1 Bn
R
)
, (27)
then α = Tj constitutes another Stackelberg strategy of the
leader. If there is no such j, the game admits a unique Stack-
elberg equilibrium. In case j exists, although both α = Tk
and α = Tj yield the same utility, they result in different
numbers of followers who invest stakes to the pool. In this
case, we propose to choose the equilibrium with the lowest
α to attract more stakeholders to the pool. Thus, this solution
can guarantee the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
To evaluate our proposed economic model, we first con-
sider a small game, i.e., G1, consisting of one leader and
five followers with parameters C = (0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.6),
B = (13, 5, 10, 8, 6), R = 50, and σ = 10. As can be seen
from Fig. 2(a), if α is lower than the investment threshold Ti
of follower i, the follower’s best response is to invest all its
budget to the pool, i.e, p∗i = Bi. When α increases beyond Ti,
the follower stops investing stakes to the pool and switches to
self-mining. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the utility of follower
i decreases as α increases, and it becomes constant when
α > Ti. Fig. 2(c) shows the pool’s profit Up in G1. As α
increases, Up increases linearly. However, when α becomes
greater than T1, the Up drops. The reason is that at this point,
follower 1 stops investing stakes to the pool, and thus the
pool cannot earn any profit from follower 1. Nevertheless, as
α continues to increase, Up increases again since the fees
the pool charges the remaining followers increase with α.
Similarly, as α continues to increase beyond the investment
thresholds T2 and T3, followers 2 and 3 stop investing stakes
to the pool, and Up changes accordingly. At α∗ = T4, the
leader obtains its global maximum U∗
p , i.e., there is a unique
Stackelberg equilibrium with the leader’s utility U∗
p = 0.87
and the leader’s strategy α∗ = T4 = 6.51% in this game.
When α is higher than T4, Up first drops and then increases,
but it is always lower than U∗
p . Finally, when α > T5, all

followers choose to self-mine and Up = 0. It is worth noting
that at the equilibrium, only followers 4 and 5 invest stakes to
the pool. If the pool tries to incentivize all followers to invest,
it can only achieve a utility of Up = 0.57 at α = T1.
We then consider a more practical scenario, namely G2, with
1000 followers under some parameters generated based on
Cardano (https://stakingrewards.com/asset/ada), a real-world
PoS-based blockchain network. In particular, we generate the
game with R = 1000 and σ = 10, whereas B and C are
generated randomly with normal distribution in the ranges of
[1, 1000] and [0.1, 0.2], respectively. There is a unique Stack-
elberg equilibrium in G2, with α∗ = 8.1% and U∗
p = 56.14.
Moreover, there are 859 followers investing approximately
69.5% of total network stakes to the pool at the equilibrium.
We also analyze the pool’s profit from each follower in Fig, 3.
Generally, the pool’s profit from a follower is proportional
to that follower’s budget and operational cost. However, if a
follower’s budget is very high, the follower will not invest
stakes to the pool, e.g., followers with budgets greater than
600 do not invest stakes to the pool in G2. The reason is that,
the threshold Ti is inversely proportional to the budget Bi.

Therefore, a follower with a high Bi has a low Ti, and thus
the follower is more inclined to self-mine.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a blockchain-based system
to address the roaming fraud problems for future mobile
networks. We have also developed an economic model based
on Stackelberg game to further enhance the benefits for the
users, thereby encouraging more users to participate in the
blockchain system. Then, we have analyzed and determined
the best strategies for the stakeholders and the stake pool to
jointly maximize their profits. In addition, we have proven
the existence and discussed the uniqueness of the Stackelberg
equilibrium in our model. Additionally, numerical experiments
have been conducted to evaluate the system performance under
different networking settings. The results show that our model
can help to attract more investments and increase the profits
of our proposed system.
