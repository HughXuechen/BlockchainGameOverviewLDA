for functionalities.[1,2] Traditional silicon-
based devices are mainly manufactured 
by photolithography, vacuum deposi-
tion, and electroless plating processes. 
However, all these methods suffer from 
several drawbacks, for example, multi-
staged procedures, high-cost invest-
ment, and undesirable polluting waste. 
As alternatives, printing techniques, 
including spin-coating, doctor-blading, 
screen printing, gravure printing, flexo-
graphic printing, roll-to-roll printing, 
and inkjet printing, create a lean, secure, 
and efficient manufacturing way to inte-
grate solution-based inorganic/organic/
biological materials with a wide range of 
substrates from papers, plastics to tex-
tiles or otherwise.[3] Among these, inkjet 
printing, which can digitally deposit 
concocted inks into prescribed arrangements with the non-
impact, maskless approach, and minimal material wastage 
has aroused considerable attention.[4–9] Moreover, this digital 
printing technique with great versatility, adaptivity, and univer-
sality promises not only high potential for industries to import 
inkjet printing into existing production lines but also unprec-
edented opportunities for broader audiences to design and 
customize do-it-yourself (DIY) optoelectronics just in office or 
household. To date, various kinds of inkjet-printed functional 
devices have been realized, such as LEDs,[10,11] displays,[12–14] 
transistors,[15–17] sensors,[18–20] solar cells,[21,22] integrated smart  
systems,[23,24] etc.[25]
Laser, undoubtedly, is the indispensable tool in our daily 
life for communicating, manufacturing, entertainment, and 
medical treatment. Nevertheless, to integrate printing tech-
nique with conventional laser system is challenging due to the 
requirement of rigid resonator cavities with meticulous preci-
sion manufacturing and specific limited materials. On the 
other hand, the random laser system is a potential candidate. 
Random lasing actions occur when the photons via multiple 
scattering in the disordered materials let the gain surpass the 
loss,[26] viz., such mirror-free laser systems can be more easily 
fabricated by the time-saving and cost-effective printing proce-
dures. Besides, significant efforts have been made to realize 
random lasers in diversified materials from inorganic/organic 
to biological system,[27–33] spanning a wide range of wavelength 
Printing technology has led to a multitude of revolutions in design, 
conception, fabrication, and application of optoelectronics nowadays 
especially for wearables and one-off devices. Recent advances range from 
solar cells, batteries, sensors, LEDs, displays, biomedical widgets to smart 
tags. Inkjet-printed random lasers (IPRLs), demonstrated here, fill in the 
crucial but missing piece of the puzzle in printed optoelectronics as well 
as progress in laser research. A broad emission spectrum of IPRL inks 
covering more than 75% gamut of CIE color space is successfully exploited 
and well adopted by commercial desktop inkjet printers. Furthermore, 
based on the digital, ink-efficient, mask-free patterning, and drop-on-
demand printing technique, a series of long-anticipated proofs-of-concept 
including on-chip laser lighting modules, red-yellow-green-blue pixel-based 
laser displays, and ink-crypto/laser-coded security printing technique are 
also demonstrated.

being just a tool for visual information needs into a generator

from ultraviolet to near-infrared and even to terahertz.[34] This 
strong database provides numerous practical examples and 
universal solutions for following researchers to exploit random 
laser system with existing printing techniques and facilities. 
It is also worth mentioning that random lasers hold several 
amazing features, such as dexterity, transferability, tunability, 
flexibility, stretchability, self-healability, recyclability, and tran-
sient capability,[30,31,35–40] which are desirable for wearables, 
one-off gadgets, and Internet of Things (IoTs), yet quite difficult 
to achieve in conventional lasers. Moreover, random laser with 
several exclusive superiorities, such as angle-free emissions, 
lying somewhere between lasers and common illuminants, 
shows high application values in laser illumination, speckle-
free laser imaging, broad-angular laser displays, and integrated 
photonic lab-on-a-chip systems.[26,34,41,42] We believe and foresee 
that such unconventional laser system can and will play a deci-
sive and irreplaceable role in the follow-on laser technology 
advancements and printed optoelectronics industries.
Imagine that, in the near future, lasers can be easily printed 
on anything anywhere by anyone with only one desktop inkjet 
printer. Notably, the inkjet-printed random lasers (IPRLs) dem-
onstrated in this work have successfully let this science fictional 
scenario come into reality (Figure 1 and Figure S1, Supporting 
Information). One layer or several layers of spatially defined 
organic films that emit random lasers with selective colours 
can be deposited on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sub-
strate in the prescribed arrangement by the common inkjet 
printer (more detailed information of inkjet printer setup is 
provided in the Experimental Section). A set of red-yellow-
green-blue (RYGB) monochromatic inks covering a huge 
color gamut more than 75% of colors perceptible to human 
eyes have been successfully designed and concocted. Four 
organic laser dyes, namely, 4-dicyanomethylene-2-tert-butyl-
6-1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidin-4-yl-vinyl-4H-pyra (DCJTB) (red), 
rhodamine 6G (yellow), rhodamine 110 (green), and stilbene 
420 (blue) are selected to be the gain media of the inks of the 
IPRLs. Changing the color of the lasing action is as simple as  
using different colors of inks. Next, to ensure the stability 
and compatibility of ink formula with existent inkjet printers, 
an ink-based precursor for in situ synthesis of self-assembled 
metallic nanoparticles with minimal cost, chemical waste, and 
temperature requirements has been systematically introduced. 
Moreover, several advanced proofs-of-concept including on-chip 
printed laser illuminants, RYGB pixel-based laser displays, and 
ink-encrypted security printings are also demonstrated. In our 
previous work,[42] we used direct dropping or spin-coating tech-
nique to fabricate monochromatic polymer film for on-chip 
laser illuminant modules. However, based on these methods, 
it is quite hard to realize scalable, ink-efficient, additive pat-
terning, and drop-on-demand approaches (more discussions 
are included in Section S1, Supporting Information). Also, 
IPRLs are opening a host of possibilities for lasers in the next-
generation wearable and soft optoelectronics. It is highly antici-
pated that IPRLs can be further applied to photonic integrated 
circuits for communicating and computing,[43] opto-micro-
fluidics for biodiagnostics and biostatistics,[29,44,45] or smart 
prints for identification and authentication.[28,46]
The motivation to introduce organic technology into 
IPRLs is because of several irreplaceable features including 
low-temperature requirement, cost-competitive material, all-
solution process, thin-film coating, etc.[47,48] However, tradi-
tional methods using dielectric scatterers (photonic particles) 
and organic dye solutions suffer from severe competition 
between gain volume and high scattering efficiency.[26,34] This 
problem is important because the ink output of inkjet printer is 
limited. In addition, dye solutions have low resistance to altera-
tions. For example, when the inks are transferred to different 
mediums such as papers or plastics, the interactions between 
inks and substrates may lead to performance-lowering defects 
or uneven distribution of dyes and scatterers. Therefore, syn-
thesis of flexible yet scalable inks with resistance to alterations 
are the key enablers for the realization of IPRLs.
To resolve above-mentioned problems, we develop an ame-
liorated in situ method as shown in Figure 2a. Poly(vinyl 
alcohol) (PVA) is added as resistance-increasing host materials 
and reducing agents for the synthesis of the inks incorporating 
self-assembled silver nanoparticles. Namely, the mixed aqueous 
solutions of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and PVA are preprocessed 
by heating on a hot plate. During this process, PVA plays the 
role of reducing agents as well as solution stabilizers. As a 
result, the mixed solutions turn into a light-yellow precursor. 
We investigate the fundamental properties of the synthesized 
silver nanoparticles by taking transmission electron micros-
copy (TEM) images and measuring the absorption spectrum 
of the precursor. Coating pure precursor on copper mesh, the 
TEM images (Figure 2b and Figure S2, Supporting Informa-
tion) show that silver nanoparticles are distributed evenly and 
randomly within the host materials. The mean diameter of 
silver nanoparticles is around 10 nm, which is estimated and 
averaged by these TEM images. The absorption spectrum of the 
precursor (blue curve) is shown in Figure 2c. A broad absorp-
tion band with a peak centered at around 410 nm is observed 
in the precursor. The position of the peak agrees well with the 
simulated localized surface plasmon spectrum (Figure 2d), 
in which we set the simulated size of silver nanoparticles in 
10 nm. The relatively broad absorption band suggests that the 
synthesized silver nanoparticles are capable of engendering 
strong scattering and electromagnetic field enhancement 
within a wide span of wavelength.
On the other hand, DCJTB, rhodamine 6G, rhodamine 
110, and stilbene 420, as active materials for RYGB lasing, 
are separately dissolved in deliberately selected solvents that 
are mutually soluble with the precursor solution. The optical

properties of these dye solutions, including photoluminescence 
(the solid line) and absorption spectra (the dashed line), are 
measured and provided in Figure 3a–d. The broadband photo-
luminescence emission spectra of RYGB inks with the full 
width at the half maximum (FWHM) of tens nanometers are 
centered at 450, 550, 585, and 660 nm, respectively. Moreover, 
the full range UV–vis absorption spectra of the four different 
laser dyes are provided next to the photoluminescence spectra. 
We observe that there are overlaps between the photolumines-
cence and absorption of dyes (Figure 3) and the localized sur-
face plasmon spectra of the synthesized silver nanoparticles 
(Figure 2c). These results reveal that silver nanoparticles can 
serve as efficient plasmonic scattering centers in these dyes for 
plasmonically enhanced random lasing.[34] In detail, three plas-
monic effects should be considered. First, the scattering effect 
can be greatly enhanced to generate random lasing by plas-
monic nanoparticles. Second, the enhancement of local elec-
tric field can lead to stronger absorption of each gain media. 
Third, the excitation of surface plasmons and their transfor-
mation into propagating photons can enhance the photolumi-
nescence of laser dyes. Briefly summerizing, these effects are 
indeed observed in our system, yet the influence of these three 
effects accounts for different proportions in different laser dyes 
(Figure S3 and Section S2, Supporting Information). Subse-
quently, RYGB random laser inks are prepared as the mixture 
of individual dye solutions and the precursor with carefully 
adjusted mixing ratio. These concocted inks are imported into 
the cartridge of an inkjet printer and deposited on PET to form 
multicolor IPRLs. Taking advantages of this method, active 
mediums with RYGB emissive colors are included to engender 
lasing with a full span of colors. Besides, the compositions of 
the ink are carefully adjusted to optimize its performance on 
PET substrate. More details about the ink formulations are pro-
vided in the Experimental Section.
Random lasers can emit broad-angular light rays using dis-
ordered gain materials. In a random laser system, the reso-
nance occurs as a result of interference between multiple 
scattered light rays and provides the underlying origin for 
coherent light signals. A threshold above which laser starts to 
manifest is typical when the light rays harness adequate optical 
gain from stimulated emission that exceeds the lost. Pro-
vided in Figure 4a–d are the laser emission spectra of RYGB 
monochromatic IPRLs printed on PET and their input–output 
charateristics (more detailed information of the optical meas-
urements are provided in the Experimental Section). In the 
recorded emission spectra, the evolutions from spontaneous 
emission to random lasing are observed. The onset of random 
laser emissions is illustrated by sharp lasing spikes with sub-
nanometer line-widths that emerge randomly on top of the 
emission band. Laser actions are evident as abruptly increased 
emission intensities and severe plunge of FWHM above crit-
ical pump fluences, as observed in the input–output diagrams. 
This remarkable threshold behavior validates our approach. 
By using tiny silver nanoparticles that serve as plasmonic 
scattering centers inside the inks, we managed to bestow 
both high optical gain and efficacious scattering at small par-
ticle sizes. Substantially, random lasers can be realized with a 
wide range of active materials embedded in rather limited ink

output using this method. Based on similar disordered struc-
tures, the thresholds of RYGB IPRLs are pretty close to each 
other, ranging between 17 and 20 mJ cm−2. The homogeneity 
guarantees a balance between different colors, which is impor-
tant for pragmatic applications.
With a matrix of inkjet-printed RYGB 
pixels, random lasers that enable a wide span 
of colors can be realized, including white 
light. The chromaticities of RYGB IPRLs 
and the mixed white emission are carefully 
studied using luminescence spectroscopy 
and CIE 1931 diagram, and the corre-
sponding photos are displayed in Figure 5a,b. 
In the CIE chromaticity diagram, the color 
space indicates the whole gamut perceptible 
to human eyes, and the border corresponds 
to the spectral colors of monochromatic light. 
The emissive colors of four RYGB mono-
chromatic IPRLs are quantitatively depicted 
by the vertices of the quadrilateral. As shown 
in the diagram, the vertices locate very closely 
to the edge of the color space, which suggests 
that monochromatic IPRLs have remark-
ably high spectral purity. It is because of the 
narrow line-width of stimulated emission. 
As a result, the quadrilateral of RYGB IPRLs 
span a color gamut that covers up to 75% 
area of the whole perceptible color space in 
the CIE diagram, which is quite large in con-
trast to industry standard of illumination (see 
Figure S4, Supporting Information). Mean-
while, the chromaticity of carefully mixed 
white emission based on IPRLs and a D65 
standard white point is displayed and com-
pared in the diagram. By carefully adjusting 
the excitation power and pixel area of indi-
vidual films, RYGB IPRLs could be mixed up 
to generate white emission that is very close 
to standard white light (Figure 5b).
Previous reports suggest that lasers 
have a great ascendancy over LEDs or tra-
ditional thermal light bulbs in display and 
lighting, owing to the numerous advan-
tages, such as higher spectral purity, larger 
color gamut, better contrast ratio, and color 
saturations.[49,50] However, such promising 
application is somewhat limited by the 
inherent directional output of laser light. 
As a new prototype of laser source, random 
lasers are different from conventional 
lasers since random lasers exploiting dis-
ordered structures emit stimulated output 
in many directions. This unique feature 
could allow random lasers to serve as an 
efficient alternative for broad-angular laser 
display.[26,34,36] In Figure 5c, the pedes-
trian countdown display, a common traffic 
instruction, is demonstrated on PET sub-
strate by the IPRLs. Displayed in Video S1 
(Supporting Information), under excitation, the little green 
man comes alive and crosses the street within the allocated 
time. When the time is up, the instruction turns to a stood 
red man. In this IPRL-based display prototype, the light is 
bright and clear in different directions, and the color is vivid.

This first demonstration shows that IPRLs could serve as a 
facile approach to not only full-color but also broad-angular 
laser display.
Exhilaratingly, via the individual stimulated emission spectra 
of the random laser, we further attempt to exploit IPRLs in secu-
rity printing engineering.[51,52] As shown in Figure 6, IPRLs

can generate ink-encrypted prints and photonic barcodes/quick 
response (QR) codes, which can not only assist in the short-range 
authorization/encoding/anti-counterfeiting of signatures, docu-
ments, certificates, credit cards, and product labels but also in the 
long-range applications for friend-or-foe identifications, mission-
to-mission interchangeable tactic-markers, and search-and-rescue 
communication.[26,28,34,46,53,54] Remarkably, IPRLs could provide 
double-shield security protection techniques. First, these colorful 
prints/codes recorded by IPRLs are merely invisible at normal 
condition, which can only be read under laser excitation. Second, 
the inks of IPRL can be concocted to perform the specific color 
rendering and laser characteristics only under prescribed excita-
tion laser source and energy densities, such that predetermined 
read conditions become the incontrovertible laser-coded infor-
mation protection. Moreover, the transient capability of IPRLs is 
another highlight. As soon as the mission completes, we can com-
pletely dissolve or selectively disintegrate the strictly confidential 
information/data under triggerable manners with controlled 
rates at prescribed times without no one the wiser, preventing 
any possibility for adversaries to collect, study, and copy. More 
experimental results and process of dissolvability and recyclability 
of IPRL inks are concluded in the Supporting Information and 
Experimental Section. For each color, we conduct the similar dis-
solving and recycling process for at least five cycles. Surprisingly, 
the lasing threshold, intensity, and spectra of each ink shown in 
Figure S5 (Supporting Information) perform a high consistency 
between every trial, truly achieving the possibility of dissolving 
and recycling IPRLs. Besides, the deformability of IPRLs is also 
demonstrated in Figure S6 (Supporting Information).
IPRLs with great versatility, compatibility, and universality 
have been systematically introduced in this work. A sequence 
of RYGB random laser inks covering more than 75% color 
gamut of the visible spectrum are exploited and well adopted by 
most mainstream commercial desktop printers. Furthermore, 
we successfully apply IPRLs for several exciting yet challenging 
prototype applications including on-chip laser lighting mod-
ules, RYGB pixel-based laser display, and ink-crypto anti-
counterfeit prints, which are the long-awaited dreams for laser 
research communities over the past decades. It is believed that 
IPRLs proved here can significantly remedy the inherent short-
comings of laser technology nowadays and open new vistas for 
printed optoelectronics that people previously may not have 
thought possible (Section S3, Supporting Information).
Experimental Section
Solution-Based Silver Nanoparticles Synthesis: 0.5 mg silver nitrate 
(AgNO3) and 1.5 g poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were evenly dissolved in 
100 mL deionized (DI) water. Next, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 
120 min. Finally, with this in situ reduction process, silver nanoparticles 
are naturally formed in this precursor solution.
Red-Ink: DCJTB was dissolved in anisole and 
ethanol with the ratio 4 mg:1 g:1 g. Next, the dye 
solution and precursor solution were mixed with 
the same ratio by weight.
Yellow-Ink: Rhodamine 6G was dissolved in 
precursor solution with the ratio 0.2 mg:1 g.
Green-Ink: Rhodamine 110 was dissolved in 
methanol with the ratio 1 mg:1 g by weight. Next, 
the dye solution and precursor solution were mixed 
with the ratio 1:5 by weight.
Blue-Ink: Stilbene 420 was dissolved in ethanol 
with the ratio 25 mg:1 g. Next, the dye solution and 
precursor solution were mixed with the same ratio 
by weight.

specifications manual. There are four ink cartridges enabling the printer 
to print four different colors simultaneously. The only modification 
to the inkjet printer for IPRLs was to replace the inks from Canon 
original equipment manufacturer with the IPRL inks concocted by the 
authors of this paper. Moreover, the printer heads can be ultrasonically 
cleaned for 10 min in selected solvents and DI water to remove the 
residual inks, which is a simple and straightforward maintenance 
methodology for the IPRL system. 3M Transparency Film PP2900 was 
selected as the substrates of IPRLs, which were ultrasonically cleaned 
for 10 min subsequently in DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol 
(IPA) in sequence to remove any adsorbed contaminant. To prevent 
any unavoidable reflective radiation from the substrate and in turn to 
retain the real color from the IPRLs, HP Laser Jet P2015d was utilized to 
print a thin-layer toner on PET. The printing process was performed at 
room temperature. The minimum line width obtained is ≈3 µm and the 
thickness of the pattern is ≈2 µm. The liquid properties of each RYGB 
ink, such as viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point are provided in

Recycle Experiment of the IPRL: To test the recycling capability, the 
dried RYGB inks of IPRLs were immersed ultrasonically in 1 mL of 
DI water until the inks were totally dissolved. Next, all the solutions 
were dropped on the original substrates and dried at 50 °C to remove 
the residual water. After the emission property was recorded, they were 
dissolved again and the steps as described above were repeated.
Material Characterization: The silver nanoparticles were characterized 
by TEM (Hitachi H-7100). The absorption spectra were measured by 
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer LAMBDA 750).
Optical Measurements: To record the random lasing emission spectra, 
the samples were optically excited by frequency-quadrupled 266 nm 
pulsed Nd:YAG laser (NewWave, Tempest 300) with 4 ns pulse width 
and 10 Hz repetition. The energy of single pulse shot is up to 200 mJ. 
The pumping beam was focused by a cylindrical lens (f = 100 mm). 
A bandpass filter of a 20 nm width was used to block the pump laser 
illumination. The emission properties were spectrally analyzed using 
a high-resolution spectrometer Jobin Yvon iHR550 with gratings of 
300 (spectral resolution 0.1 nm) and 1200 grooves mm−1 (spectral 
resolution 0.025 nm). A synapse thermoelectric cooled charge-coupled 
device (CCD) guaranteed to −75 °C was connected to the spectroscopy 
software SynerJY. Schematic view of the spectroscopic random 
laser setup is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). All the 
measurements were performed at room temperature.
Numerical Simulation: The simulation result is performed using the 
commercial electromagnetic software (Lumerical). The refractive index 
of Ag is from the experimental data of Johnson and Christy,[55] and PVA 
is set as 1.5.
