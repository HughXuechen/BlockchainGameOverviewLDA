Abstract Ever since the invention of the bitcoin cryptocurrency in the year 2009,
many blockchain ledgers have been initiated by several parties, offering over 1600
different types of cryptocurrencies all around the world by them. This increase in
popularity has not only moved the masses toward performing trade using these cur-
rencies but also start earning them through mining with sophisticated computing
hardware. In this article, an analysis is performed to estimate the performance and
the profitability of mainstream gaming consoles, developed by the Sony Entertain-
ment Company and Microsoft Corporation when subjected to mine five different
types of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash). The
article also provides real-time test results on the mining performance and profitabil-
ity of the consoles under study. Although the Microsoft Corporation consoles can
provide amonthly profit of 0.00096 and 0.00319%of the initial investment, an overall
net loss of over 80% of the initial investment is observed in all the consoles.

1 Introduction
The Bitcoin cryptocurrency has been increasingly gaining popularity since its initial
release on January 3, 2009. Due to the immense hike in face value from | 43,247.83
to | 360,055.02 of Bitcoin by the year 2016 [1], the popularity peaked subsequently

and has been growing ever since. According to Statista, Bitcoin is the most valued
cryptocurrencywith a face value of | 731,424 in the year 2020. This gain in popularity
ignited trade to be carried out using this newly accepted currency as a secure source
of payment between two organizations over the Internet, without any third-party lia-
bility. The population that performs trades using the cryptocurrency extended the use
of the same by also starting to earn them. This is done using cryptocurrency mining.
Due to the immense success of Bitcoin in its trade and mining pools, many inde-
pendent and organizational parties have started to introduce their cryptocurrency by
maintaining a public ledger, with over 1600 different types of cryptocurrencies being
used worldwide. With such an increase in the number of cryptocurrencies exchange
available, the miners have started to mine them all over the world by combining their
computing capacity to formmining pools. Out of thesemined currencies, the Litecoin
and the Bitcoin are mined in a majority in the Asia-Pacific subcontinents totalling
up to 52 and 44% of the total mining pool population by the year 2018, according to
Statista [2]. By the year 2020, the size of the Bitcoin blockchain has grown to a size
of 280 gigabytes [3] and a length of 535 million [4]. These observations show that
mining cryptocurrency can be highly profitable with the right investment in suitable
hardware. Out of the hardware considered for mining, the least sought out by the
users is the current mainstream gaming consoles due to their closed systems.
The gaming sector has been an ever-expanding and everimproving industry since
the early 1960s. With exceptional significance in the improvement of hardware used
in the gaming consoles, the gaming systems have improved in performance and
efficiency. With the global gaming console market generating a revenue of | 596,430
crores in the year 2020 [5], the popularity in the use of gaming consoles is at its peak.
Hence, in this article, an analysis is performed to examine the viability of gaming
consoles in mining operations and to examine whether they are capable of producing
a profit, as the major use of these consoles by the users is only gaming and home
entertainment.
2 Cryptocurrency Mining
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of obtaining cryptocurrency incentives for the
successful validation of any transaction occurring in the target network. The network
consists of a digital ledger known as the blockchain, that stores these transactions
once they are successfully validated by the peers present in them. The validation
operation refers to the calculation of each transaction’s fingerprint (hash) and check-
ing if it matches with the target fingerprint. The digital transaction records and the
hash of the previous block are hashed along with a number only used once (nonce)
and are propagated in the network to the users to be validated. The operation of
determining the nonce and hashing them redundantly to obtain the hash that matches
the target hash is known as mining. If a user is successful in determining the nonce
before any other participant, then that user is incentivized with a certain amount of
cryptocurrency based on the amount of work done by the peer. Based on the diffi-
Analysis of Cryptocurrency Mining in Gaming Consoles 359
culty, i.e., the difficulty to solve for the hash, the incentive amount of the currency
varies. Because the solving of the hash algorithm is a tedious and repetitive process,
computing power is utilized. Based on the user’s hardware capability, the speed with
which the hashes are calculated varies. The speed with which the hardware compo-
nent can calculate these hashes is called the hash rate; i.e., higher the hash rate, better
is the performance and profit. Since a stand-alone system may not be able to provide
the hashing power to solve a single block, peers in a network form a combined unit
of computation to solve each block. This is known as a mining pool. The incentive
to each user is assigned based on the amount of computational power contributed to
solving the block.

James Clay et al. in their work “A Power Analysis of Cryptocurrency Mining: A
MobileDevice Perspective” [8] analyze the impact of cryptocurrencymining systems
on the power consumption of mobile devices. In their work, the authors analyze the
ill effects of JavaScript-based web browser mining of websites such as CoinHive on
mobile devices. The authors analyze the power consumption and the network usage
of mobile devices, that is utilized by CoinHive to mine their network as an alternative
for targeted advertisement. The authors show the impact of these mining operations
on a low-powered device such as a mobile phone and how it can ultimately decrease
its battery life. Similar to the approach of the author’s work, this proposed experi-
ment focuses on measuring the profitability of the mining operation in low-powered
devices (locked gaming consoles that do not use extensive hashing peripherals to
mine) and observing the impact of the performances of the native computation unit
in solving block hashes. In the article “Goldstrike™1: CoinTerra’s First Generation
Cryptocurrency Mining Processor for Bitcoin” [9], the authors Javed Barkatullah
et al. analyze the performance and efficiency of the newly designed Goldstrike™1
processor for Bitcoin mining. The processor is analyzed based on the power con-
sumption efficiency during the mining process and its hash rate for a unit of power
consumed. The architecture of the processor is studied to analyze and compare the
hashing power and the power efficiency of the processor to application-specific inte-
grated circuit (ASIC) miners. Similar to the mentioned work, this article analyzes
the architecture of the low-powered processor in mainstream gaming consoles for
performance and profitability. Authors S. G. Iyer et al. in their study “GPU and
CPU Accelerated Mining of Cryptocurrencies and their Financial Analysis” [10]
analyze and compare the performance and the profitability of central processing unit
(CPU)-based and graphics processing unit (GPU)-based mining. In their study, it
is evident that the hash rate of the CPU or the GPU is majorly dependent on the
360 E. Shanmuga Skandh Vinayak et al.
hashing algorithm of the cryptocurrency mined. Their work also reveals that GPU
the is dominant option in a mining system, as it is able to produce 103 times the hash
rate of the CPU for the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Since their study was performed
on Intel® CPU processor, this proposing study is aimed at analyzing the performance
and the profitability of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD®) CPUs.
4 Experimental Analysis
In this article, we assess the usability of four mainstream gaming consoles, in mining
cryptocurrency. The four consoles are, the PlayStation 4™, released onNovember 15,
2013 (USA) and the PlayStation 4 Pro™, released on November 10, 2016, developed
by the Sony Computer Entertainment and the Xbox One™, released on November
22, 2013 (USA) and the Xbox One X™, released on November 7, 2017, developed
by the Microsoft Corporation.
These consoles are selected based on the popularity of use in the overall gaming
industry and their possession of the most sophisticated hardware in the console
industry so far. According to Statista, over 112 million PlayStation 4 units and over
46 million Xbox One units have been installed and used all over the world, in the
year 2019 [6].
The ultimate goal of estimating whether a gaming console can be used to mine
cryptocurrencies and produce a profit (return on investment) is based on the following
factors.
1. Price and Specifications.
2. Cryptocurrency to be mined.
3. Hash Rate.
4. Power Consumption.
5. Lifespan.
4.1 Price and Specifications
The price and the specifications of the console are one of the most preliminary
aspects to be considered before selecting a console, as it plays an important role in
determining the profit that the console produces on the invested capital. Although
selecting the cheapest console appears to be the most prominent option, selecting the
console based on the specifications that would comparatively produce the highest
profit in a short time duration is essential. Tables 1, 2 and 3 describe the price (at the
time of writing this article) in rupees (|) and the specification of the consoles under
study.

The specifications of the console that only aid in the cryptocurrency mining process
are analyzed and specified in the following tables and sections; i.e., the internal
memory, DVD drive, and I/O port specifications of the consoles are not analyzed.
One of the most significant components that enable profitable and worthwhile
mining operations in a non-ASIC mining rig is the GPU. Although the GPU in
the gaming consoles in this study has significantly improved when compared to its
predecessor consoles (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), such as the use of DirectX-12
graphics in the Xbox One X consoles, unlike the predecessor consoles, these gaming
consoles are locked by their respective manufacturing companies and cannot be
hacked or modified to utilize the GPU directly. This prevents the GPU from being
362 E. Shanmuga Skandh Vinayak et al.
used directly by a non-licensed third-party application. Although the PlayStation
consoles possess the ability to install homebrew applications in its platform, no third-
party mining application that can harness the GPU is available at the time of writing
this article. This not only forces the console to an application lessmining environment
but also performs CPU mining. CPU mining is proven to be significantly lower in
efficiency and profit when compared to GPU mining. The CPU core is capable of
executing 4 32-bit instructions per clock (using a 128-bit SSE instruction) or 8 via
AdvancedVector Extensions (AVX) (256-Bit), whereas aGPU like RadeonHD5970
is capable of executing 3200 32-bit instructions per clock (using 3200 ALUs). The
difference in their architectures allows us to understand that, although a multi-core
CPU has a higher clock-rate allocated for each core, the GPU is superior in efficiency
when performing redundant operations such as mining. Although the PlayStation 4
and PlayStation 4 Pro possess 1.84 and 4.20 Tera Floating Points (TFLOPS) AMD
Radeon™GPUs, respectively, and the Xbox One and the Xbox One X possess 1.31
and 6.0 TFLOPS, respectively; they are unavailable for the utilization in these non-
licensed mining operations.
Out of the configurations considered, the RAM specification can be considered as
the least significant parameter in the analysis of mining performance. This is because
all the consoles under study possess 8 times (12 for Xbox One X) the RAM require-
ment for any cryptocurrency to be mined. But this is also analyzed in this article,
as the Operating System (OS) of the console depends on the RAM to optimize ker-
nel operations that are performed along with the multi-threaded mining operations.
The Orbis OS v7.51 (at the time of writing this article) of PlayStation 4 and the
PlayStation 4 Pro is a Unix-based FreeBSD operating system that is highly capa-
ble of internal RAM optimization. This shows that the console may not freeze or
crash due to a shortage of memory if the mining operation succeeds. But unlike the
PlayStation consoles, the Xbox One and Xbox One X consoles possess a Windows
10, initially Windows 8 core as its operating system along with a modified version
of the Hyper-Viridian hypervisor. This utilization of the hypervisor in the Xbox One
consoles allows the consoles to be superior to the PlayStation consoles during the
mining operation. Hyper-V implements and isolates virtual machine partition (log-
ical unit of isolation, supported by the hypervisor, in which each guest operating
system executes) that it creates in x86-64 Windows machines. The Hyper-V is capa-
ble of hardware accelerating the address translation of Guest Virtual Address-spaces,
by using second-level address translation provided by the CPU (EPT), on AMD. The
mining interface utilizes the child partition to perform a hypervisor-based hashing
operation. The Hyper-V utilizes the simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technique
that allows the processor’s resources to be shared by separate, independent threads.
SMT generally offers a modest performance boost to most workloads by paralleliz-
ing computations when possible, thereby increasing instruction throughput. This
allows the Xbox One and Xbox One X consoles to perform multi-threaded mining,
bottlenecked by the hashing capacity of the CPU.

4.2 Cryptocurrency
The cryptocurrency is the reward incentivized to the miner for verifying the trans-
action. Although an exchange face value is available for each cryptocurrency, with
which government-regulated money can be obtained, the difficulty to obtain a sub-
stantial amount of cryptocurrency varies within each cryptocurrency. For this exper-
iment, the console is subjected to mine five cryptocurrencies. The difficulty and the
price of each cryptocurrency (at the time of writing this article) are given in Tables
4 and 5.
The difficulty rates are dependent on the consensus protocol the cryptocurrencies
follow and the volume of participants of the network. Depending on the consensus
rules and the size of the network, the difficulty range of the nonce varies, which is
directly proportional to the amount and the value of the incentive obtained from the
mining operation. The miners are rewarded with the cryptocurrency obtained from
the fee the transaction initiators pay to the network (Table 6).

All the cryptocurrency mined for the purpose of this experiment follows the proof-
of-work consensus protocol, that awards the participants of the network, based on
the amount of computational resources contributed in solving the block hash. The
architecture that follows describes the proof-of-work consensus and the pipeline of
block verification in the network (Fig. 1).
4.3 Hash Rate
The hash rate of a mining rig is the most important aspect to be considered in
calculating the profitability of the mining operation using the system under study.
Any mining hardware is classified based on the rate at which hashes are calculated
by them. The unit with which the hash rate is measured in hashes/second (H/s). The
higher order of the unit is extended as kilo (103) hashes/second (kH/s), mega (106)
hashes/second (MH/s), giga (109) hashes/second (GH/s), tera (1012) hashes/second
(TH/s), etc.
In this section, the expected and the actual hash rate of the consoles based on
their CPU architecture is analyzed. Since the hash rate of the AMD x86-64 Jaguar
processors is unavailable at the time ofwriting this article, the architecture of theCPU
can be taken as a base consideration to be compared with the architecture of similar
AMD CPUs to bring about an approximate hash rate for the consoles. But, unlike
the other AMDCPUs available, the sole purpose of the Jaguar CPU is to provide low
Fig. 1 Proof-of-work architecture

power accelerated processing unit (APU) for the I/Odevices. The cat-line of theAMD
processor that has AMD’s Bobcat APU as the predecessor of the Jaguar APU, which
exhibits 22% fewer instructions per cycle (IPC), like the Jaguar APU, it also does not
possess a hash rate benchmark due to low power operation expected by it. One of the
processors closest in comparison is the x86-64 Atom processor developed by Intel
Corporation. The benchmark hash rate of Intel’s Atom is 146.72H/s for the XMR
- RandomX (XMRig) algorithm. Although a direct comparison can be considered,
Intel’sAtom is superior in termsof performancedue to theCPUconfigured to perform
various tasks in a fully-fledged computer, whereas the AMD Jaguar in the gaming
consoles is required to only render video and synchronize I/O operations. Hence, the
AMD Jaguar of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is expected to perform significantly
lower, with amuch lower hash rate for the same algorithm. However, with an increase
in performance of the AMD Jaguar APUs in the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One
X consoles, the computing capacity of the video render is compared to the Core
i5-3570K, developed by Intel corporation which has a base clock rate of 3.40GHz
boosted to 3.80GHz. Although they are benchmarked to have similar performances
in video rendering capability, they can have highly different performances in mining
with the AMD Jaguar being much inferior. The hash rate of the Core i5-3570K
processor is benchmarked as 1319.65H/s for the XMRig algorithm. Similarly, the
expected hash rate and performance of the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One X are
expected to be significantly lower. For this experiment, the hash rate of the gaming
consoles is observed by mining each of the five cryptocurrencies for a duration of
24h. Unfortunately, the PlayStation 4was unable to start themining operation for any
of the cryptocurrency. Hence, the average/net hash and income of the PlayStation
4 are considered as 0. Similarly, the PlayStation 4 Pro was unable to mine any
cryptocurrency blockchain other than Dash. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the observed
hash rates for a 24h duration in each console.
4.4 Power Consumption
The only factor that determines whether the net mining operation would result in a
profit or a loss is the power consumption cost of the consoles. The mining operation
would result in a profit if the power consumption cost is less than the amount of equity
earned in cryptocurrency, else it would result in a loss. Referring to Table 3, the power
consumption values for each console are considered and the net consumption cost
is calculated in this section. Table7 shows the power consumption cost for each
console, considering the user is under a domestic bimonthly tariff electricity billing
system.
This cost comparison is further analyzed in the results section by determining
whether a return on investment is possible with these gaming console with a consid-
eration of the calculated life span.

4.5 Life Span
In this section, the functional working life span of the gaming consoles under study is
analyzed and estimated based on the user reviews. This data is analyzed to estimate
if the consoles can turn a profit before becoming faulty. Considering the average
working temperature of the consoles, Table 8 shows the life span (prime working
condition) of each console.

mining.
5 Results
Neither of the PlayStation consoles nor the Xbox consoles supports third-party cryp-
tocurrency mining applications. To tackle this, a concept known as web mining is
used. Web mining is a technology that utilizes a JavaScript-based interface between
the host and the website to exchange mining information. Instead of the conven-

tional application-based mining that involved the maintenance of the cryptocurrency
blockchain in the local system, the website only uses the hashing power of the host
system to solve the blockchain and award the user’s account with cryptocurrency
based on the work done by the console. All the consoles under study possess native
web browsers and support Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and an Ethernet
speed of at least 100 Mbps. These requirements are sufficient to perform browser
mining, as the block size is only 1 MB. Since web mining only allows the consoles
to mine as a stand-alone system, the profitability of pool mining cannot be expected
from this solution.
The website CoinPot [7] is used to mine cryptocurrency using the CPU of the
host system. The website provides a user interface to configure the parameters of the
mining such as CPU usage limit, thread limit. The website configurations are set to
utilize high CPU usage and 1 thread per CPU core (Fig. 5). As the cryptocurrencies
are mined, the obtained rewards are subsequently deposited to the account’s crypto
wallet.
The following tables show the summary of expected profit/loss from the consoles
whenmined using them. All the income calculations are based on the currency values
mentioned in Table 5. Since these values are subjected to change, the following
calculations provide an approximate estimation.

From these observations, it can be seen that the Xbox One and the Xbox One X
(for Lite Coin) console can provide a monthly profit. But when considering the life
span expectancy of the consoles, all the gaming consoles provide only a loss to the
investment. These gaming consoles are expected to only perform in their area of
expertise, gaming. These losses can also be accounted for by their closed system-on-
chips (SOCs) that only allow the utilization of the CPU rather than a combination of
their CPU and GPU.

approximate estimate of profit that can be expected from mining using the consoles.
From the conducted experiment, the following conclusions can be drawn.
1. The gaming consoles are extremely poor performers when utilized to mine cryp-
tocurrency.
2. The gaming console will ultimately produce a loss of the initial invested capital
by a large margin.
3. This low performance and efficiency are characterized by the inability of the
gaming consoles to utilize the GPU present in them to mine effectively.
4. The PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 Pro consoles produce a loss of the initial
as well as the periodic (electricity cost) investment.
5. If the initial investment is not considered, then the Xbox consoles produce a small
margin monthly profit.
6. The Xbox One console produces its highest profit of approximately | 20 every
month and the Xbox One X produces its only and the highest profit of approxi-
mately | 134.
7 Limitations
Although this article proposes an approximate estimate of the profits and losses,
they are highly susceptible to change. This is because cryptocurrency exchange rates
are highly correlated with the popularity among the masses that mine the particular
cryptocurrency. This could result in the investment of time and money on the mining
operation for a particular currency, only to produce a futile result with a minimal
amount of low-value exchange rate. Another assumption made in this article is that
the consoles are to perform mining operation every hour of every day. This could
contradict the practicality of carrying out such an operation, considering external
influencing factors such as electricity outage, overheating, system crash, and defec-
tive console.
8 Future Works
At the time of writing this article, the Sony Entertainment Company and Microsoft
Corporation have already confirmed the future release of their next-generation gam-
ing consoles, named PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. These consoles are expected
to have extremely high gaming performances. Although they would be undoubt-
edly futile cryptocurrency miners, it is expected that they would perform better than
the current consoles. Even though the Xbox consoles cannot be fully used to bring
about better mining performance, the existence of homebrew in the PlayStation plat-
form could be utilized in developing software that can take advantage of the highly
sophisticated GPU present in them.
