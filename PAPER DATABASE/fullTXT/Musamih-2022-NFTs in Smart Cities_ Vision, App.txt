Abstract—Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have recently received widespread attention as their market
has experienced massive growth since early 2021. NFTs are blockchain-based tokens used to
represent ownership of digital and physical assets in a manner that is transparent, traceable,
tamper-proof, secure, and trustworthy. Although NFTs have enabled new applications in the gaming
and art industries, their full extent and potential are yet to be explored. In this paper, we outline the
vision of using NFTs in smart cities. We describe the main components of NFTs and how smart city
applications, such as smart governance, smart services, smart economy, smart industry, smart
environment, and smart mobility and transportation, can benefit from them. In addition, we show how
leveraging NFTs can add value to the metaverse. Finally, we discuss research challenges that hinder
the adoption of NFTs in smart cities.
NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS (NFTS) are unique and
non-exchangeable crypto tokens. An asset is fungible
if the owner can exchange it with similar assets with
no change in property or value. For instance, the US
dollar is fungible because a person can exchange any
one-dollar paper currency equivalently with any other
one-dollar paper currency. On the other hand, a student
can not exchange the bachelor’s degree certificate with
any other certificate because each bachelor’s certificate
is bound to a particular student; thus, the bachelor’s
certificate is a non-fungible asset. NFTs are based
on blockchain technology, which is a shared and im-
mutable ledger that records data in decentralized nodes
connected by a peer-to-peer network. Miners are nodes

that maintain the ledger, validate new transactions,
and perform mining of new blocks. The blockchain
ledger is tamper-proof as changing one block requires
a change in all previous blocks stored in all the mining
nodes.
NFTs have gained immense popularity in recent
years. They can act as digital certificates to prove the
ownership of assets. Also, NFT owners can trade them
smoothly by transferring ownership of the token from
the owner’s account to the buyer’s. The most famous
and widely known application of NFTs is digital
collectibles [1], [2]. However, NFTs’ use cases are not
limited to digital collectibles. For instance, the authors
in [3] used NFTs to create wildlife collectibles. The
motivation behind their idea is to sell NFTs to tourists
in return for money that will be used to finance wildlife
conservation efforts. Real-estate NFTs can also facili-

estate auctions, as all bidding against the property is

Nowadays, people living in urban areas exceed
those living in rural areas. More people are migrating
daily from rural areas to cities because of the higher
standard of living and the availability of job opportuni-
ties in cities. The United Nations (UN) estimates that
7 billion people, or 68% of the world’s population,
will live in urban areas by 2050 [5]. Therefore, the
government must plan future cities to be smart and
sustainable. Otherwise, the quality of life in cities will
deteriorate as the number of inhabitants increases with
no proper action from the government. There are many
definitions of “smart cities,” and it isn’t easy to find
a universal definition [6]. Therefore, we try to give
examples of life inside smart cities.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) [7], Internet of Things
(IoT) [8], and sustainable development [9] play a
crucial role in smart cities. In smart cities, devices
are connected via secure and fast internet connections,
and people interact digitally with physical objects
and receive services through digital interfaces. Trans-
portation is improved in smart cities via the use of
clean energy sources and intelligent traffic control.
Cars are self-driving, and home appliances are smart.
Further, government services are more accessible to
the public through digital and smart applications, and
citizens can monitor the government’s performance
through open access reports and statistics [10], [11].

comprises five main layers. First, the sensing layer,

from the sensing layer and transmitting it to the upper
layers via various networking technologies such as
satellite internet, LTE, and 4G. In addition, future
networking technologies such as 5G and 6G can play
an important role in improving the overall performance
of the transmission layer. Moreover, cloud computing
and storage solutions operate at this level to provide
smooth and secure data transmission. Further, central-
ized or decentralized data centers can be facilitated at
this layer to further improve the handling of large data
[13]. Third, the blockchain layer enables data manage-
ment, tokenization, and tasks’ automation in a decen-
tralized, transparent, and secure manner by facilitating
smart contracts and NFTs. Fourth, the processing layer
is responsible for receiving data from lower layers
and processing it using different technologies, such as
Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV), to
produce meaningful and useful information. Finally,
the application layer contains the different domains
of a smart city, which utilize the produced data and
information from the lower layers to improve their
operations and performance.
Although NFTs and smart cities have been ex-
tensively researched in the literature, these two areas
have been researched and studied separately. To the
best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that
reviews the conjunction between these two areas. In
this paper, we envision using NFTs in different smart
city applications. We present the role of NFTs in the
metaverse. We discuss the major challenges to NFT
adoption in smart cities as well as potential solutions.
Finally, we provide future research directions for the
use of NFTs in smart city applications.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 briefly describes smart contracts, decen-
tralized storage, and NFTs. Section 3 describes the
potential applications of NFTs in smart cities. Section
4 discusses challenges that might hinder the broader
adoption of NFTs and their potential solutions. Section
5 concludes the paper, summarizes the main findings,
and points out future research directions.
Background
This section presents a brief description of smart
contracts, decentralized storage, and NFTs.
Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are programs stored in the
blockchain [17]. They include metadata about the
application and the logic governing the smart contract.
The smart contract creator (owner) writes the set of
functions to be called by the user and embeds the logic
controlling the behavior of each function. Then, the
owner deploys the contract to the blockchain network.
A smart contract does not run by itself; a user must call
it, specifying the function to be executed by miners.
To call a function, the caller sends a transaction to
the miners. The transaction includes the function name
along with the function parameter.
Miners validate the transaction before adding it to
a block, execute the specified function with the input
parameter, and store the execution result in the ledger.
A function may contain an infinite loop or take a long
time to finish, stopping miners from processing other
transactions. To avoid lengthy calculations and infinite
loops, each execution step costs a predetermined fee
(gas fee), and the function caller must allocate the
money in advance. If the money allocated runs out,
miners stop function execution and return to the state
before function execution.
Decentralized Storage
The use of centralized cloud storage poses security
and privacy threats to user data because the host
of the centralized storage system can alter, censor,
or even disclose data to third parties without the
data owner’s consent. Furthermore, because they are
typically located in one or a few locations, centralized
cloud storage introduces the single point of failure risk;
thus, they can be easily targeted by malicious users to
compromise the stored data, or in the event of a power
outage, the provided services are paralyzed, and the
stored data is sometimes permanently lost. To address
these issues, decentralized storage systems that store
data in decentralized nodes have been proposed [18].
Each storage node is rewarded based on the amount
of stored data, available time, and other metrics that
ensure fairness among the involved nodes. In addition,
the upload and download speeds are much higher
than centralized storage solutions because a centralized
server might cause a network bottleneck with many
connections. Data is also safe in decentralized storage
systems because it is split up and duplicated, and each
copy is stored on a different node.
NFTs
NFTs are digital assets that reside on the
blockchain with a unique identifier and metadata that
distinguish them from each other. The ERC-721 stan-

dard on the Ethereum blockchain was the first standard
that supported the use of NFTs [19] which was fol-
lowed by a more sophisticated standard that is called
ERC-1155, which was introduced and implemented
for Semi-Fungible Tokens [20]. Such standards are es-
sential for providing the basic functionality for NFTs,
which are tracing, tracking, and transferring NFTs.
Figure 2. The structure and main components of an
NFT
Figure 2 shows the structure and main components
of an NFT. First, the blockchain is the backbone and
core component of an NFT because it contains and
maintains the unique features of the NFT that distin-
guish it from other NFTs. First, each NFT belongs to
a smart contract with a unique contract address that
cannot be replicated, which is necessary to ensure that
users are aware of the authenticity of the NFT smart
contract they interact with. Second, the deployer of
the smart contract is identified by a unique address,
which is referred to as the Unique Creator Address.
Third, a token symbol can be specified within the smart
contract for a certain NFT collection. However, the
symbol alone is not enough to distinguish it from other
NFT collections, and the unique token contract address
is still needed to ensure that the user is interacting with
the correct smart contract. Fourth, each NFT within the
smart contract is identified by a unique token ID that
is generated during its minting event, and it cannot
be duplicated. Fifth, the transaction history of each
NFT smart contract is immutable and permanently
stored on the underlying blockchain, which can be
used to track and trace NFTs. Finally, the metadata
of each NFT can be either stored on-chain or off-
chain, depending on the size of the data involved. In
the former, no external content ID and storage options
are required as the data is directly stored on-chain and
users can inspect the content directly. In the latter, the
metadata is stored on external storage options such
as distributed, decentralized, or centralized storage,
and an external content ID is produced and stored on
the blockchain to make it immutable. However, the
existence of the actual metadata will be completely
dependent on the chosen storage option.
Applications of NFTs in Smart Cities
In this section, we present applications of smart
cities that can benefit from NFTs’ adoption, as illus-
trated in Figure 3.
Smart Governance
Smart governance refers to the process of utiliz-
ing new technologies to develop innovative gover-
nance approaches. In particular, these developments
are aimed at providing evidence-based policymaking
and collaborative governance [24]. In the context of
smart city governance, achieving efficient and effective
policymaking requires the participation of citizens
in the decision-making process transparently, which
creates and maintains a healthy relationship between
the policymakers and citizens [25]. One of the major
challenges facing smart governance in smart cities
is voting fraud, which refers to manipulations that
occur during the voting period that result in misleading
outcomes. Additionally, participation in governmental
proposals lacks transparency as there is no transparent
authentication mechanism for voting. Based on [26],
the use of decentralized authentication mechanisms is
essential for the success of smart cities, and although
this study discusses the importance of decentralized
authentication mechanisms for IoT devices, the same
principles apply for individuals participating in elec-
tronic voting. NFTs can provide a unique identity for
each participant in an electronic voting system, where
only the holders of the NFTs that are issued from
a verified ERC-721 smart contract can participate in
the voting process. Moreover, NFTs inherently ensure
transparency, immutability, and security because they
are part of a blockchain, which provides a decentral-
ized authentication mechanism.
Figure 4 illustrates a potential use case for NFTs
to facilitate a governmental voting process. First, the
government will create and deploy an ERC-721 smart
contract that is identifiable by its unique contract
address, and citizens will be able to own a unique
NFT that makes them distinguishable from each other.
Additionally, the ERC-721 smart contract can be cus-
tomized to make the NFTs non-transferrable to ensure

that the NFTs remain with their original owners.
Second, whenever the government wants to create a
proposal that requires the vote of the NFT holders,
the proposal details will have to be uploaded to off-
chain storage such as IPFS to avoid storing large-sized
files on the blockchain. Voting can be done on the
blockchain or off-chain. In the former, a voting smart
contract can be used to record all the votes of the
participants, which can be then audited in a transparent
and trusted manner. In the latter, the signature of
the voters can be obtained off-chain by having them
sign their vote with their private keys, which allows
the authors to verify if a vote is legitimate or not.
Finally, the voters can have the option to delegate their
votes to someone else whom they believe has a better
understanding and perception of the created proposal.
Smart Services
Smart cities are designed to integrate digital and
physical systems within a city. Therefore, having a
digital identity that represents the people living in
that city is necessary. A digital identity is required
to standardize the way people and systems interact
with each other. Moreover, the identification method
in a smart city has to be secure, private, and portable
to ensure that smart city services are utilized in an

efficient and secure manner. The traditional identifi-
cation method, using government-issued ID cards, is
not ideal as they do not fulfill the requirements of the
identification method in smart cities. Because NFTs
are inherently secure, private, and portable, they can
be used as a replacement for the physical government-
issued ID cards with magnetic stripes.
Figure 5 demonstrates how an NFT can be utilized
as a digital identity. First, citizens will be eligible
to apply for soulbound NFTs. A soulbound NFT is
a non-transferrable NFT that can represent the social
status of an individual [27]. Second, the government
mints a soulbound NFT for each eligible citizen.
Third, the soulbound NFT can carry different types
of information, such as medical records, educational
qualifications, and personal information. Any sensitive
information should be encrypted, and the NFT holder
has the option to grant access to such information off-
chain by using a solution such as Proxy Re-Encryption
[28]. Fourth, authorized institutions will be able to up-
date the records attached to the NFT. Finally, citizens
will be able to use the NFT as a secure and trusted
identity proof in various applications and programs.
Smart Economy
The smart economy refers to the ability to create an
interconnection between the local and global markets
in an innovative way that provides higher productivity
and delivery [29]. Furthermore, the smart economy
seeks to incorporate the concept of sharing economy
by allowing citizens and stakeholders to offer their
work and experience in a seamless and peer-to-peer
manner [30]. In the context of smart cities, having a
prosperous economy where all individuals are capable
of benefiting from it is essential. One of the major
challenges to having a successful sharing economy is
trust and security, because a peer-to-peer marketplace
requires both peers to trust each other [31]. NFTs
are permanently stored on the blockchain, which is
inherently transparent, immutable, and secure. There-
fore, it enables participants to inspect the history and
authenticity of the listed NFT without the need for
a trusted third party. These inherited features from
blockchain technology allow NFTs to have the poten-
tial to overcome the existing security and trust issues
in existing peer-to-peer systems.
Figure 6 illustrates how an NFT-based peer-to-
peer marketplace can function to resolve the security
issues in the existing models. There are two main smart
contracts to facilitate NFT creation and trading, which
are the ERC-721 smart contract and the Marketplace
smart contract, respectively. First, a seller chooses a
storage option for the metadata of the offered product
that produces an external immutable identifier. Sec-
ond, the ERC-721 smart contract is used to mint the
NFT that represents the offered product. Third, the
Marketplace smart contract is used by the seller to
facilitate the listing process of the minted NFT. Third,
an interested buyer places a bid. Fourth, the bid is
either accepted or rejected by the seller. Finally, if the
bid is accepted, the NFT ownership is transferred to
the buyer and the NFT value is transferred to the seller
by the Marketplace smart contract. The use of NFTs
in this context ensures that the transactions related to
a product are immutable, transparent, and secure.
Smart Industry
Smart industry, or industry 4.0, is the integration
of digital assets with the physical world by using
advanced technologies such as digital twins, which
aim to improve efficiency and productivity [32]. The
existing literature reveals various barriers that currently
exist to the adoption of industry 4.0. For example, there
is a lack of secure standards and norms for the integra-
tion of digital assets with the physical world. Another
example is the cyber-security challenges, where the in-
terconnected components can be vulnerable to security
breachs [33]. Furthermore, a case study for the use of
Decision Support Systems (DSS) for the management
of the smart industry has been proposed [34]. The
authors of this study discuss the importance of having
historical data to perform historical-based predictions
to achieve optimal accuracy, and it also shows how
there is currently an open issue with such predictions
because of the lack of historical data, which leads to
poor decision-making models for energy management.
The use of blockchain and NFTs can act as the
backbone of industry 4.0, where all the transactions
are secured by the blockchain, and the digital assets
can be represented in the form of an NFT, which
ensures ownership, transparency, and data provenance.
Moreover, all NFTs are designed using the same ERC-
721 standard, which can be a potential solution to the
standardization issue that currently exists in industry
4.0. Furthermore, energy management is an important
aspect of smart industry, which is highly dependent
on the availability and authenticity of historical data
[34]. Tokenizing assets in the form of NFTs provides a
potential solution to the data availability issue because
NFTs are inherently immutable and their history is

decision-makers with a reliable source of information
to enhance their energy management solutions.
Smart Environment
A smart environment describes how a government
utilizes technology to improve the livability of citizens
and to introduce and implement regulatory and cul-
tural changes that encourage sustainable standards and
practices [35]. The domain of the smart environment
includes environmental data management, pollution
and waste reduction, efficient green energy trading
[36]. An interesting application for NFTs is in the
smart energy chain, where citizens can participate in
a peer-to-peer transaction application in which green
energy is generated and traded. One of the most
common trades that occur in green energy trading is
the trading of green certificates [37]. In such trading,
a major challenge that is currently facing the green
energy sector is tracing and identifying generating
assets, because the larger the number of participants in
the network, the more difficult it is to track and trace.
Moreover, there is no mechanism or method for the
distinction between electrons that are generated from
renewable energy and those from fossil fuels [38]. The
Energy Web Foundation (EWF), a global non-profit
organization that utilizes blockchain technology in the
energy sector, introduced Energy Attribute Certificates
(EACs) which are awarded to renewable energy assets
based on the amount of generated power [37]. Each
EAC includes the source of the power, the geographic
location of the generating asset, the exact amount of
electricity generated, and the date and time. Therefore,
an EAC is considered a non-fungible asset. NFTs
can represent such assets because their design and
standards fit the needs of non-fungible assets. Also,
using NFTs can make it easier to keep track of these
assets and ensure their immutability, data provenance,
and accountability.
Smart Mobility and Transportation
Smart mobility and transportation aim to increase
the quality and efficiency of urban transportation,
adoption of new mobility technologies, and people mo-
bility. Moreover, smart mobility and transportation in-
troduce the concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),
where a smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure
is utilized to connect different actors and entities [39].
A major sector in mobility and transportation is vehicle
management, trading, and sharing [40]. One of the
challenges that faces vehicle users is diagnosing a
problem within their vehicles, and having a full record
of the history of the vehicle can be very beneficial in
diagnosing the problem faster and cheaper. NFTs can

Figure 7. The role of NFTs in Smart City-based metaverse
provide a potential solution to this problem as they
are suited for the representation of non-fungible assets
and can permanently store all the records of a vehicle.
Moreover, having the history of the vehicle fully
recorded in an NFT can provide a solution to the trust
issue in vehicle trading. Finally, some of the hurdles
that face the vehicle sharing market are the limited
access to such a market and the difficulty of sharing
the vehicle key with the customer, which can make
this model bad in terms of the customer experience.
For the former, an NFT marketplace can be developed
where users can list their vehicles for sharing, and an
interested customer can view the history and reputation
of the vehicle owner before renting the vehicle. For
the latter, NFTs can be used as an access key to
the vehicle, where a smart contract can be used to
facilitate the access process by granting a customer’s
NFT access to the vehicle once a successful payment
is made to the vehicle owner.
NFTs in Smart City-based Metaverse
The metaverse is an immersive virtual world that
allows people and entities to interact with each other
through their digital representations using technologies
such as 3D computing, augmented reality (AR), and
virtual reality (VR) [41]. The integration of the real
world with the metaverse requires a secure, trusted,

and decentralized infrastructure to ensure that users
are always protected [42]. Building a smart city-
based metaverse requires the inclusion of all the main
domains of a smart city, such as the economy, gov-
ernance, industry, transportation, and other services.
Figure 7 illustrates the role of blockchain and NFTs in
the integration of the real world with the virtual world
(Metaverse). First, to facilitate monetary transactions,
a digital currency that is backed by a real currency
is needed to ensure that users are able to redeem it at
any given moment. Since a digital currency is fungible,
the ERC-20 standard is needed to facilitate the process
of issuing and exchanging it [43]. Second, any real
asset that needs to be represented digitally will be
based on the NFT ERC-721 standard to ensure that
the records and information about the asset are secure
and immutable. Third, distributed or decentralized off-
chain storage is facilitated for storing large-sized files
that do not fit the blockchain. Finally, general-purpose
smart contracts are utilized to facilitate the process of
trading and using NFTs in different applications such
as marketplaces and asset sharing.
Research Challenges
This section presents the challenges that hinder
the widespread adoption of NFTs in smart cities. We
outline the key causes of each challenge as well as
provide potential solutions, as can be seen in Table 1.
Blockchain-Related Challenges
NFTs use blockchain to persist the data and incor-
porate smart contracts to add the logic and standards
that control the token’s behavior. Therefore, NFTs
inherit blockchain and smart contract issues. For in-
stance, mining a block in blockchain networks takes
time, which is not suitable for large-scale applications
[44]. For NFTs to be adopted and incorporated into
smart cities, the throughput of the blockchain needs to
be high enough to handle such a high transaction rate.
To improve the overall throughput and efficiency
of the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum Foundation
started developing scaling solutions [45]. The scaling
solutions are twofold: First, there is the on-chain
scaling solution, which aims to make direct changes
to the Ethereum protocol’s mainnet, such as Sharding.
Second, off-chain scaling solutions, such as Rollups,
Sidechains, Plasma, and Validium [46]. The recent
Ethereum Merge that changed the consensus algorithm
of the blockchain from PoW to PoS has not directly
impacted the scalability of the blockchain, however, it
made it easier for second layer platforms to be built
[47].
Security and Privacy
Most blockchain networks are public networks
where everyone sees all transactions. They have been
designed to be public to ensure transparency in the
system, making blockchain data transparent, traceable,
and auditable. However, fully transparent systems do
not preserve the privacy of users. In some cases, the
value NFTs add is based on their publicity and visibil-
ity. For instance, an owner of an NFT representing a
patent will undoubtedly prefer that the NFT be visible
to everyone because more users of the patent will lead
to an increase in annual profits.
In other cases, publicly-traded NFTs might not
be preferred by the token’s owner or suitable due to
privacy regulations. For example, a house owner needs
NFT to prove ownership but does not necessarily want
everyone to know his ownership of the house or its
location. Similarly, an NFT that corresponds to the
medical records of a patient should be private due to
privacy regulations, and the sensitivity of the data [48].
A potential solution to the privacy issue is using private
or permissioned blockchain networks instead of public
ones. However, trust in private networks is less than
in public networks due to the lack of transparency.
The security challenges facing NFT developers are
summarized in [49]. Moreover, the data stored on the
blockchain can be encrypted, and the owner of the
NFT can grant access to such data based on his own
will. This can be achieved by utilizing solutions such
as Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) [28].
There are several security risks associated with
the use of NFTs. First, a major NFT security risk is
associated with the fact that NFT trading is currently
being facilitated by third-party platforms that provide
storage capabilities for NFT content, which means that
if the platform goes out of business, users might be left
with NFTs with a broken content identifier. Second, a
major NFT security risk is related to smart contracts,
which can be susceptible to exploits if not coded
and audited properly. Finally, the metadata of NFTs
is sometimes stored on centralized storage, which
exposes the owner of the NFT to critical vulnerability,
where the stored data is lost or changed, making the
NFT worthless.

Table 1. Open challenges impeding NFT adoption and potential solutions
Challenge Domain Challenge Potential Solution
Blockchain-related Challenges
- High transaction fees - Use of private-permissioned blockchain
- Low throughput - Utilizing on-chain and off-chain scaling solutions
- High energy consumption - Choosing a low-energy consuming consensus algorithm
Privacy and Security Challenges
- Storing sensitive and confidential data - Encrypting data before storing it on the blockchain
- Fake and malicious assets - Verifying the unique contract address of the NFT
Rapid Changes and Storage Challenges
- High entry barrier and lack of experts - Organizing awareness campaigns and workshops
- Limited storage space on the blockchain - Utilizing off-chain storage solutions such as IPFS
Law Enforcement Challenges - Regulation frameworks are nonexistent - Establishing and implementing regulatory standards
Rapid Changes and Limited Storage
Although NFTs have recently drawn tremendous
attention, the technology is still in its infancy. There-
fore, crossing the chasm to reach the early majority
and eventually laggards requires the establishment of
standards and regulations. The application developed
today might not work well with the standard set in
the future due to the lack of backward compatibility.
Furthermore, there are no proper development tools
to assist programmers in writing high-quality and
efficient code, and NFTs face interoperability issues
due to different established standards on different
blockchains.
Another critical challenge facing NFTs is the stor-
age problem, because the actual file is not stored
in the blockchain. The metadata of any NFT has a
unique identifier that points to the file stored off-
chain. Thus, the link to the file is permanently stored
in the blockchain and is tamper-proof. However, the
actual file is not tamper-proof and could be changed
by the owner. In fact, the file could be deleted from
the storage location, and the link will be pointing to
nothing [50]. The storage issue is serious since people
are paying money for these tokens. There are currently
solutions such as IPFS and Filecoin that are focused
on providing solutions to this issue [51].
Law Enforcement, Regulations, and Legal
Issues
Since the adoption of cryptocurrencies, there have
been many attempts to regulate them. However, there is
currently no complete regulatory framework for them
[52]. NFTs also face the same issue because there are
no laws that govern usability and protect the rights
of each entity [53]. There is no way to penalize NFT
owners if the object associated with the NFT turns
out to be incorrect or missing. Recently, there have
been a lot of scams where people bought tokens that
turned out to be fake, and the NFT seller ran off
with the money. The absence of regulations affects
NFT owners as well. For example, if a programmer
creates an NFT for a code, the programmer cannot do
anything to other people using the code without their
permission. All the previously discussed applications
of NFTs in smart cities would not work if there is no
legal system that penalizes malicious behaviors. More-
over, the tokenization of physical assets is expected
to implicate governmental laws that address several
legal issues. First, ownership and license rights may
be poorly communicated to the buyer of the NFT.
Therefore, the ownership and license terms should
clearly delineate what the buyer actually owns and
what the buyer can and cannot do with their NFT. Sec-
ond, intellectual property (IP) rights are not necessarily
obtained by minting an NFT that represents content
such as artwork, music, or trademarks, which can
make the NFT owner liable for infringing third-party
IP. Third, volatile and high-value NFTs may be used
to facilitate money laundering, which is considered
illegal and a crime. Therefore, platforms that facilitate
NFT trading must be properly regulated to ensure such
acts do not take place. Fourth, securities law may
apply to NFTs that have security-like features, such
as NFTs granting their holders a share of the revenue
from the underlying asset. Therefore, a proper and
robust regulatory framework and standards must be
implemented to ensure that such NFTs are properly
monitored and managed. Finally, other legal issues
that may be associated with the use of NFTs include
gambling, sanctions, and NFT insider trading.
Conclusion and Future Directions
In this paper, we outlined the vision of using NFTs
in smart cities. We presented the key components
and features of NFTs, and described how they can
be utilized in different smart city applications. We
presented the role of NFTs in the metaverse. We
discussed the key challenges that hinder the adoption
of NFTs in the applications of smart cities and outlined
potential solutions. The findings of our paper can be

summarized into three main points. First, NFTs can
be used to represent digital assets in a smart city that
are required to be immutable, secure, and traceable.
Second, NFTs are not a standalone technology, as they
require a well-configured blockchain and an efficient
off-chain data storage solution in order for them to
function properly and as intended. Finally, there are
several technical and adaptive challenges that must be
overcome to increase the adoption of NFTs in smart
cities. Some future research directions are described
below.
• Concepts such as 5G/6G technologies are expected
to have a massive impact on existing technolo-
gies, including NFTs. Therefore, further research
is required to understand and predict the potential
impact of NFTs and their adoption process.
• The impact of NFTs on various Quality of Service
(QoS) factors that are associated with the domains
of smart cities can be further studied and evaluated.
This might be done by estimating the overall per-
formance of a certain domain in a smart city after
implementing NFTs and comparing it with existing
QoS to decide if it has a substantial impact or not.
• A well-established regulatory framework is required
to protect the users of NFTs and prevent forgeries.
Therefore, more research is required in this field to
come up with the best practices and standards for
NFTs.
• Scalability is one of the major challenges that
hinders the adoption of NFTs and blockchain tech-
nology. The current blockchains that support NFTs,
like Ethereum, can’t handle high network conges-
tion well because gas fees change and transactions
take a long time. This isn’t good for creators or NFT
users in general because it makes the blockchain
less useful.
• NFT-based applications and blockchain-based ap-
plications in general have a hard time getting into
the market because the technology is still new and
most people think it’s too hard to understand. This
keeps them away from using these applications.
