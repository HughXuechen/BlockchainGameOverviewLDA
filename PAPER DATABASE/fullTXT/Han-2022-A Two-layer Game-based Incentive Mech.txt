Abstract—Decentralized crowdsourcing removes the depen-
dence on a trusted centralized platform based on blockchain
and ensures system stability through the consensus of miners.
The lack of centralized supervision requires all kinds of system
nodes to voluntarily participate while their behaviors are profit-
driven and unpredictable, thus introducing challenges to system
performance. Moreover, the nodes in a decentralized crowdsourc-
ing system inherently observe little information about the system
status; therefore, it is difficult for them to discover and adopt
theoretically optimal strategies. Current literature still lacks an
effective mechanism to motivate the participation of all types of
nodes. To this end, this paper employs a two-layer game model
to simulate the interactions in the decentralized crowdsourcing
system for investigating the participation willingness of different
system nodes. Specifically, we apply a Stackelberg game to model
the interactions of a crowdsourcing requester and other nodes,
where the requester decides its reward policy and the others
respond by selecting their roles to play. In addition, the interac-
tion of the bounded rational other nodes is further represented
as an evolutionary game. After analyzing the game model, we
further design an incentive mechanism to maximize the requester
utility while motivating other nodes to actively participate in the
crowdsourcing. Through experimental simulations, we verify the
effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain supports distributed and data-driven autonomous
management [1] by applying a consensus mechanism to get rid
of a trusted central party. Advanced cryptography technology
enables the blockchain with the characteristics of decentraliza-
tion, immutability, traceability, transparency, anonymity. The
properties of blockchain, such as decentralization, immutabil-
ity, anonymity, and anonymity enable it to be widely applied
in many scenarios, where decentralized crowdsourcing (DCS)
is one of them [16] [17].
DCS contains three types of nodes: workers, miners, and
requesters. The requesters would like to collect large-scale
data by requesting DCS service, while the workers collect,
process and store data. The miners collaborate to distributively
maintain and manage the DCS system. The service quality
and system security of DCS significantly rely on the massive
engagement of workers and miners. However, current research
supposes their active participation by default, which is appar-
ently an unreasonable assumption since practical nodes are
rational and profit-driven.
Incentive mechanism applies a variety of internal or ex-
ternal incentives to standardize and relatively immobilize the
expected behavior of system nodes. In DCS, due to the lack
of centralized control, the active participation and cooperative
behavior of nodes is more necessary to ensure the security and
sustainability of the system. However, the dynamic environ-
ment and unpredictable node behavior pose challenges to the
performance of the system. Quality control is a hot spot in
the crowdsourcing system, which should be more carefully
considered in DCS because of the uncooperative behavior
caused by node anonymity and distribution. Concretely, work-
ers may send fake data and miners may refuse to generate
and broadcast blocks. Therefore, a reasonable and feasible
incentive mechanism is badly needed to encourage the active
participation of all nodes and ensure their cooperative and
trustworthy behavior for improving system performance.
Existing incentive mechanisms in DCS are mostly designed
based on game theory [8] and auction theory [18] [9] with
the goal of maximizing the requester utility, or apply service
quality [12] or reputation [7] as an incentive to the cooperation
of workers. Unfortunately, the incentive need of miners is
totally missed in the existing works [6]–[12]. Moreover, the
cryptocurrency-based incentive mechanisms are controversial
for the uncertainty of its practical value.
We are confronting several challenges due to the diversity
and complexity of decentralized scenarios when addressing
the above problems in existing DCS incentive mechanisms.
On one hand, zero trust between a large number of distributed
nodes impedes their active participation, which is essential
to the successful deployment of DCS. The incomplete in-
formation of bounded rational nodes greatly complicate node
interaction. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to select an ap-
propriate model for capturing the node interaction and further
analyze the process of node strategy selection. On the other
hand, the introduction of miners into DCS makes the design
of an incentive mechanism convoluted. The participation of
massive rational miners and workers, which contribute to the
security and service quality of DCS, requires the requesters to
pay additional rewards, compared with a centralized solution.
Undoubtedly, the requesters hope to pay the rewards as low
as possible for profit maximization.
To overcome these challenges, this paper employs the game
theory to construct an incentive mechanism for motivating
various system nodes to actively participate in DCS while978-1-6654-3540-6/22/$31.00 © 2022 IEEE

maximizing the requester utility. Firstly, we design the utility
functions of various nodes to build a proper economic model.
Secondly, we apply a two-layer game to model the interactions
of all system nodes, where a Stackelberg game [3] is adopted
to simulate the interaction of a requester and other nodes and
an evolutionary game [2] is applied to model the strategy
evolution of the other nodes. Thirdly, we employ a backward
induction to analyze this two-layer game, based on the game
theoretical analysis, we propose an incentive mechanism that
can maximize the requester utility and motivate other nodes
to actively work as miners and workers.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews existing incentive mechanisms in DCS. Section III
presents the system model and economic model of DCS,
according to which we design our two-layer game-based
incentive mechanism in Section IV. Section V presents ex-
perimental results and the last section concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
This section reviews existing literature about incentive
mechanisms in DCS and concludes their shortcomings.
Cheng et al. [6] and Xu et al. [7] both adopted reputation-
based incentives for workers. Kadadha et al. [10] employed
smart contracts to establish a fair and transparent incentive
mechanism. However, these three incentive mechanisms do
not consider the incentives to requesters and miners. An et
al. [12] designed the rewards of workers and miners to be
distributed according to their contributions without considering
the requester incentive. Considering long-term high-quality
sensor data collection under budget constraints, Hu et al. [8]
proposed a three-stage Stackelberg game to maximize the
utilities of both requesters and workers. To motivate worker
participation in data collection and sharing, an auction-based
quality-driven incentive mechanism is proposed in [9]. Lai et
al. [11] designed a reverse auction-based incentive mechanism
to motivate vehicles (workers) to participate in perceptual tasks
while maximizing the requester utility. However, the incentive
to miners is still missing. Yin et al. [14] developed a bidding
mechanism based on time constraints and quality requirements
to motivate vehicles to participate in sensing tasks. However,
the implementation method and algorithm flow of the bidding
mechanism are not specific. Li et al. [13] regulated that the
rewards of workers are automatically allocated according to
the evaluation results of their solutions while the evaluation
scheme and reward distribution mechanism are not clear. Feng
and Yan [15] designed that the rewards of both workers and
miners are positively correlated with their credit values, so as
to motivate each node to act honestly. However, the reward
mechanism to miners is unclear and they did not consider to
incent the requester.
To sum up, existing work unrealistically assumes that nodes
are completely rational, which leads to a mismatch between
theoretical analysis and practical strategy selection. Moreover,
most incentive mechanisms ignore the incentive to miners;
however, the miners play an important role in maintaining
system security and reliability. To overcome these deficiencies,
we aim to propose an incentive mechanism that can maximize
the requester utility and motivate the active participation of
workers and miners with bounded rationality.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we present the general procedure of DCS
and summarize our research assumptions, based on which we
further establish an economic model.
We consider a DCS with a requester and multiple nodes
N that behave as workers and miners. The node acts as
a worker and miner is called a hybrid node. The requester
obtains high-quality task completion by providing appropriate
remuneration to workers and miners. There are many types
of worker nodes in mobile crowdsourcing system, such as
data acquisition node, data storage node and data processing
node. They collaborate to perform mobile crowdsourcing tasks
according to protocol. Miner nodes collaborate to maintain and
manage blockchain systems. Fig. 1 shows the structure of DCS
and the procedure of DCS is as follows:
Workers
Miners
Requester
...
Fig. 1. Architecture of DCS.
A requester publishes its task request message while the
miners that receive this message verify the validity of the
task and broadcast the valid task through the blockchain.
After receiving the task request, qualified workers selected by
the requester perform the task and send their bids for this
task. The workers can be further classified based on their
functions and the task types. Then the task-completion quality
of each worker is assessed by the miners. All the task related
information are recorded in blocks. The miners generate and
reach a consensus on blocks to ensure system security. All
nodes do not trust with each other and they cannot be fully
trusted.
This paper considers K types of sub-tasks, which is corre-
sponding to K types of workers. We denote the total number
of nodes of the j-th type of task as Nj . Each node ni ∈ N has
a quality attribute αj,i as a worker and a contribution value
θj,i as a miner for the j-th type of task.
A. Research Assumptions
Before concrete analysis, we summarize our research as-
sumptions herein. To simplify our model, we assume that
there is only one requester and its task is divided into multiple
subtasks according to the task content. We assume the workers
for the same subtask are homogeneous and each node can
only perform one type of subtask considering their equipment

constraints. The contribution of miners is related to their
behavior in system maintenance and management. Each node
will make rational behaviors dominated by its own interests.
The work quality and contribution value will be verified by
miners and recorded on the blockchain, thus no one can
modify them.
B. Economic Model
Let xi ∈ {Mj ,Wj , Hj , Aj} represent the strategy of node
ni ∈ Nj , where Mj ,Wj , Hj , Aj denote the strategy of
being a miner, a worker, a hybrid node and not to par-
ticipate, respectively. IMj
, IWj
, IHj
, IAj
represent node sets
that choose Mj ,Wj , Hj , Aj . The requester provides reward
RT,j at most for the j-th type of subtask, among which the
reward proportion to workers is γj . Below are the node utility
functions.
1) Miner: Considering the safety of the system jointly
maintained by the miners, the reward of a miner depends on
its relative contribution value, θj,i∑
k∈IMj
θj,k
. According to the law
of diminishing marginal cost [4], we use logarithmic function
to model the relationship of the miner cost and its contribution
value. Therefore, the utility of the j-th type of miners is:
Em,j − Cm,j . (1)
Herein, Em,j = RT,j × (1 − γj) × θj,i∑
k∈IMj
θj,k
and Cm,j =
µj × log2(1 + θj,i), where µj is the cost adjustment factor.
2) Worker: The reward of each node is distributed accord-
ing to its work quality and the average reward. Based on
the law of diminishing returns, a worker can get diminishing
returns from unit work quality as its work quality increases.
We adopts tanh [5] to construct the influence of work quality
on reward. The utility of the j-th type of workers is:
Ew,j − Cw,j . (2)
Herein, Ew,j =
RT,j×γj
|IWj |
× tanh((αj,i−αj)×cj)+1
2 and Cw,j =
ρj ×αj,i. αj is the mean work quality of the j-th subtask and
cj is the worker reward regulation parameter. ρj represents the
cost of the j-th type of worker with unit work quality.
3) Hybrid node: As miners will verify the work quality
of workers, the hybrid node can make malicious verification
to reduce the enthusiasm of other nodes to act as worker
nodes and decrease the work quality of other worker nodes. To
alleviate this situation, we set that the income of a hybrid node
for acting as a worker and a miner will reduce considering its
potential malicious behavior. The utility of the j-th type of
hybrid nodes is:
σj,1 × Em,j − Cm,j + σj,2 × Ew,j − Cw,j . (3)
where σj,1 and σj,2 represent the attenuation factors of the
miner income and the worker income, respectively.
4) Node that does not participate: This type of nodes has
no income and without any cost, so its utility is 0.
5) Requester: The requester directly benefits from the
completed task by paying rewards to the other nodes. At
the same time, a high overall contribution value of all miner
guarantees the credibility of work quality, which indirectly
ensures the requester income. The requester gains diminishing
marginal utility from work quality and obtains low benefit
from the contribution values less than a certain threshold, thus,
we use ln and cos to model the relationship of the requester
income and the work quality as well as the contribution
value, respectively. Therefore, the income of the requester
is positively correlated with the work quality provided by
worker nodes and the total contribution value provided by
miner nodes. Let λj,1 and λj,2 be the income regulation
parameters of the requester from the workers and miners, we
can summarize the requester utility in (4).
IV. TWO-LAYER GAME-BASED INCENTIVE MECHANISM
A. Two-layer Game Model
According to the DCS workflow, we model the interaction
between the requester and other nodes as a Stackelberg game.
Considering that the other nodes are bounded rational, we use
an evolutionary game to simulate their strategy selection.
1) Stackelberg game: In the first stage, the requester acts
as a leader by setting its reward pricing with RT,j and γj .
In the second stage, the other nodes respond to the requester
strategy by choosing a role for maximizing their own utilities.
2) Evolutionary game: Considering the bounded rational-
ity of other nodes, their role selection procedure is further
modeled as an evolutionary game. In this game, population
distribution is I = (IMj
, IWj
, IHj
, IAj
).
3) Two-layer game equilibrium: We employ a backward
induction method to analyze the game equilibrium. We first an-
alyze the strategy decisions of other nodes under fixed pricing
parameters to investigate the evolutionary equilibrium. Then
we analyze the influence of RT,j and γj on the evolutionary
equilibrium and discover the Stackelberg equilibrium.
B. Evolutionary Equilibrium Analysis
We first study the node strategy selection process and then
analyze the equilibrium state of the evolutionary game.
1) Game analysis: In each game stage, the nodes select
their strategies based on current strategy population distribu-
tion at the current stage and the requester pricing strategy. We
classify the nodes into risk-averse type and risk-appetite type
according to their risk preference characteristics. To simplify
the analysis, we assume that the same type node has the same
risk preference characteristic. Specifically, the risk-averse node
chooses the strategy with higher utility while the risk-appetite
node would like stay with the current strategy to gamble.
We define the income obtained by predicting the node
change in a strategy set as the risk return fj,k, k ∈
{H,M,N,A}, which can be positive or negative. A large-
scale strategy set poses great risks to its members while the
risk return could be high. The risk return of a risk-averse node
is 0 while that of a risk-appetite node is related to the node
number in the strategy set and the utility of this strategy.

When xi = Mj , if the sum of its utility and risk return is
not less than 0, the node will choose to become a miner. To
facilitate analysis, we assume that the node contribution values
are independent and identically distributed random variables.
Let θj denote the mean contribution value of the j-th type of
miners, then
∑
k∈IMj
θj,k =
∣∣IMj
∣∣ × θj . So the utility of the
miner is:
RT,j × (1− γj)×
θj,i∣∣IMj
∣∣× θj
− Cm,j (5)
Therefore, when xi = Mj , we have
RT,j × (1− γj)×
θj,i∣∣IMj
∣∣× θj
− Cm,j + fj,M ≥ 0, (6)
based on which we can derive the contribution value range of
the miner group under different parameter settings.
When xi = Wj , if the sum of its utility and risk return is
not less than 0, the node become a worker. Similarly,
Ew,j − Cw,j + fj,W ≥ 0. (7)
Therefore, the work quality range of the worker group under
different parameter settings can also be obtained.
When (6) and (7) are both satisfied, the node will choose
to be a hybrid node, namely xi = Hj . If both of them are not
satisfied, the node will choose not to participate with xi = Aj .
We define Ωm,j , Ωw,j and Ωh,j as the contribution value
range of miner group, the work quality range of worker
group, and the contribution value and work quality range
of hybrid group. Therefore, the population distribution of
different strategies is described as follows:
IMj
= {i ∈ Nj |θj,i ∈ Ωm,j}
IWj
= {i ∈ Nj |αj,i ∈ Ωw,j}
IHj
= IWj
∩ IMj
= {i ∈ Nj |(θj,i, αj,i) ∈ Ωh,j}
IAj
= Ij − IMj
∪ IWj
(8)
where Ij = {i ∈ Nj |θj,i ∈ (0, 1] , αj,i ∈ (0, 1]}.
2) Evolutionary stable strategy: The game is divided into
multiple stages. When the equilibrium is reached, no nodes
will change their strategies from the next stage and the popu-
lation distribution of each strategy will remain unchanged.
In our evolutionary game model, both players and their
strategy sets are finite. According to the Nash existence
theorem, there must be at least one Nash equilibrium. There-
fore, the evolutionary game may have multiple equilibrium
states. The initial node distribution can uniquely determine
one stable equilibrium state. Therefore, given any initial node
distribution, the system will eventually evolve to a unique and
stable equilibrium state.
We denote the population distribution of different strategies
at the equilibrium state as I∗
Mj
, I∗
Wj
, I∗
Hj
, I∗
Aj
. The node con-
tribution value and the node work quality follow probability
distributions F1 and F2 and their probability density functions
are presented as f1 and f2 respectively. Therefore, the node
number of each strategy can be expressed as follows:

Herein, Ω∗

Therefore, given the requester strategy and system parameters,
Ω∗

Therefore, the equilibrium strategy can be obtained.
C. Equilibrium Analysis of Stackelberg Game
On the basis of the analysis of evolutionary game equilib-
rium mentioned above, we go back to the first stage of Stack-
elberg game and analyze the strategic choice of the requester
node, so as to obtain the Stackelberg game equilibrium.
1) Game analysis: Based on the evolutionary equilibrium,
the requester, as the leader, controls and adjusts its strategy
to maximize its own utility and enable other nodes to assume
diverse roles. According to (4), the requester utility maximiza-
tion resembles an optimization problem constrained by the
evolution state of other nodes, which can be expressed as (10),
where the utility of the requester is denoted as U(RT , γ, I).
max U(RT , γ, I)
s.t. |IWj
| = ηw,j(RT,j , γj), j ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,K}

RT ∈ [0,MAX]
γ ∈ [0, 1]
(10)
RT = (RT,1, RT,2, . . . , RT,K), γ = (γ1, γ2, . . . , γK), ηw,j
and ηm,j are the mappings between |IWj
|, |IMj
| and RT,j , γj .
MAX represents a finite value, which means that the requester

is budget-constrained. Therefore, the optimal strategy of the
requester can be obtained by solving (10).
2) Proof of equilibrium: Although it is difficult to clearly
express the specific expression of ηw,j and ηm,j and we are
unable to find the closed-form solution of (10), we can still
try to prove the existence of this solution, that is, the existence
of the equilibrium.
Combined with the distribution of the contribution value and
the work quality, we can find that U(RT , γ, I) is a piecewise
function of RT,j , γj , j ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,K}. In each interval,
which divides the piecewise function,
∣∣IMj
∣∣, ∣∣IWj
∣∣ and
∣∣IHj
∣∣
do not change and these intervals are all bounded. The partial
derivative of U(RT , γ, I) with RT,j and γj are calculated as
below.

Hence, ∂U

are constant. Therefore, U(RT , γ, I)
is maximized on the boundary of the interval. The maximum
value of U(RT , γ, I) can be obtained by comparing the
maximum value of each interval. Thus, the existence of the
Stackelberg equilibrium is proved.
D. Two-layer Game Equilibrium-based Incentive Mechanism
Combining the equilibrium analysis of the evolutionary
game and Stackelberg game, we discover that the pricing
parameters of the requester will influence the utilities of other
nodes, thus resulting in different node strategy evolution.
Furthermore, the requester utility is influenced by its pricing
parameters and the evolution results of other nodes.
Therefore, only the requester provides reasonable RT,j and
γj , can it make the other nodes to take an active part in
the miner groups and worker groups while maximizing its
own utility. Theoretically, according to (10), the corresponding

relationship between the strategies of the other nodes at
equilibrium and the pricing strategies RT,j and γj can be
calculated. Thus, the values of RT,j and γj can be obtained
according to the target of the requester, i.e., the specific desired
number of miners and workers.
V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
This section simulates the system evolution by describing
how the evolutionary equilibrium changes with the pricing
strategy and discussing the node distribution at equilibrium.
A. Experimental Settings
We consider a DCS with a requester and 150 other nodes.
To simplify our experiments, we set K = 1, namely only one
type of subtask exists. The contribution value and work quality
of nodes are uniformly distributed on (0, 1]. Table I concludes
the parameter settings of our economic model.
We aim to evaluate the performance of our incentive mecha-
nism with some metrics. The strategy proportions at each game
round are applied to evaluate the existence of equilibrium.
The utilities of all system nodes at equilibrium is used to
evaluate the achievement of individual rationality and fairness.
Each node in the system is a rational stakeholder driven by
individual interests. Individual rationality is to ensure that the
utility of each node in the system is non-negative, so that they
are willing to participate in the system. Meanwhile, the utility
obtained by nodes of different work qualities or contribution
values is used to assess the fairness. Nodes should receive
rewards proportional to their contributions, so as to encourage
them to contribute as much as possible.
We employ the work quality and contribution value thresh-
old of each strategy at equilibrium to evaluate system sustain-
ability. The contribution value of the miner node and the work
quality of the worker node should be greater than a certain
threshold, and the nodes with low contribution to the system
should be screened out to ensure the sustainable development
of the system.
B. Experimental Results and Analysis
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 illustrate the influence of RT on the
number of workers and miners at equilibrium when γ = 0.6. It
is worth noting that if the evolution results of other nodes still
oscillate at the end of the game under the requester pricing
parameter, we set the node number as −1 for simplification.
According to Fig. 2, when RT is small, it will lead to
oscillations. When RT increases to around 2000, almost all
nodes choose to be a miner. The range of RT which makes
the worker node set stationary is much larger than that of the

miner node set in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows that the miner number
grows in a step-wise fashion as RT increases, which verifies
that the miner number and worker number remain constant in
the interval as the theoretical analysis of the requester utility
maximization. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the influence of γ on
the number of workers and miners at equilibrium when RT
is 2000. Their stationary and piece-wise characteristics are
similar to the relationship between the node number and RT .
Combining the results of Fig. 2 to and Fig. 5, the appropriate
pricing parameters can be found to maximize the requester
utility and motivate the participation of a large number of
workers and miners. The above results show the existence of
the bounded intervals that do not change with
∣∣IMj
∣∣, ∣∣IWj
∣∣
and
∣∣IHj
∣∣.
The relationship between the requester utility and RT as
well as γ is shown in Fig. 6. For easy observation, we set the
requester utility with unstable evolution as 0. The more yellow
the color block in the figure is, the higher the requester utility
is. The maximum requester utility, which is non-negative, is
obtained when RT = 1939, γ = 0.602. The edge of color
block in Fig. 6 is jagged because the step of RT,j and γj is
discontinuous.
Fig. 7 describes the strategy evolution of other nodes under
the parameters that maximize the requester utility, which
reaches an equilibrium at the 52nd game round. At the
beginning of the evolution, all nodes work as hybrid nodes.
After that, each node compare the predicted utility of each
strategy in the next stage and change their roles accordingly
for the next stage. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively describe the
utility of each node in the miner group and worker group under
the parameters that maximize the requester utility. All nodes
that choose to participate can gain non-negative utility, thus
satisfying individual rationality. Furthermore, the node utility
increases as the contribution value or work quality increases,
thus satisfying fairness.
Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show the node distribu-
tion of miners and workers at the initial and equilibrium state,
respectively. Comparing Fig. 12 with Fig. 13, all the workers

whose work qualities are in the [0.02, 0.04] and [0.24, 0.26]

give up acting a worker after the game. The worker whose
work quality is in [0, 0.04] still chooses to be a worker after
evolution, since its cost is very low and it does not change its
strategy considering the risk return. We can similarly analyze
the results in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. From the above, we can
conclude that our mechanism meets sustainability.
According to the above results and analysis, a large number
of workers selected by our incentive mechanism have high
work qualities, which can meet the needs of the requester. A
large-scale miner group also ensures the system security. This
verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the pricing incentive
mechanism.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we designed an incentive mechanism for DCS
based on game theory, aiming to motivate the participation
of both workers and miners while maximizing the requester
utility. We employed a Stackelberg game to model the in-
teractions of the requester and other nodes and applied an
evolutionary game to model the strategy selection of the other
nodes with bounded rationality. Furthermore, we designed an
incentive mechanism for DCS to achieve our design goals. We
theoretically proved the feasibility of our incentive mechanism
and verify its effectiveness through experimental simulations.
The results show that our incentive mechanism can motivate a
large number of high-quality workers and miners to participate
in the system while maximizing the requester utility. Regard-
ing future work, we plan to expand our incentive mechanism
by considering delay factors in the evolutionary game, which
could affect the decisions of different nodes. We will also
extend our experimental settings with K > 1 to evaluate
the scalability of our method. Furthermore, we will further
compare the performance of our incentive mechanism with
existing ones to show the advance of this paper.
