Smart government is an important means of optimizing government management, improving the government decision-making
capacity, and pushing forward the public service. When the smart government process applies, the dire straits of collaborative
governance among the different participants could not be ignored usually caused bymaximizing their profits. Based on the current
research, this paper introduces the blockchain technology into the smart government system and establishes a smart government
platform architecture. Meanwhile, to analyse the evolutionary and stable strategies of the three parties under the blockchain
technology, the evolutionary gamemodel including functional departments, local governments, and end users as the main players
is established on account of the bounded rationality. By examining the “blockchain + government service” in Beijing with the
systemic dynamics theory, this paper changes the influencing factors simulated by changing the parameter assignment, to
determine the evolutionary stable equilibrium under different external conditions. ,e results show that local government
supervision plays a leading role in the process of collaborative governance of smart government based on blockchain technology;
meanwhile, effective cost control is a key factor affecting the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS). Besides, the “decentralized”
structure, “distrust” architecture, and “precision” mechanism of the blockchain are verified for the effect of the evolution process.
Among them, precision service and flat management improve the possibility of collaborative governance, but the impact of the
trust mechanism is not obvious. ,erefore, the collaborative governance model of smart government based on blockchain
technology is loaded with far-reaching significance for promoting the modernization of China’s governance capacity and
governance system.
1. Introduction
As science and technology are leaping forward and the
concept of modern governance is advancing, government
departments should take the strategic measure of optimizing
their decision-making ability and elevate their social service
level by exploiting emerging technological means to develop
smart government affairs. Since 2008, IBM proposed “smart
Earth” initially [1]. ,e concept of using novel technological
means to assist government governance decision-making
and optimize public service capacity has been rapidly rec-
ognized worldwide, gradually forging a global upsurge of
pursuing and delving into the development of smart gov-
ernment affairs. As suggested from the 2018 UN survey
report [2], in 2018, there were 36 leading e-government
developing nations (very high EGDI, greater than 0.75). To
be specific, there were 26 European nations, taking up 72%,
and 5 nations in Asia, accounting for 14%; there were two
nations in the Americas and Oceania, taking up 14%, and
one country in Africa, occupying 3% (see Figure 1).
According to the survey results, there are three important
dimensions in the e-government development index
(EGDI), i.e., the online service index (OSI), the data com-
munication infrastructure index (TII), and the human
Hindawi

resources index (HCI). Nations stressed the development of
government affairs information, and each index was im-
proved significantly in 2018, thereby boosting rapid devel-
opment of smart government governance (see Figure 2).
Over the past few years, the Chinese government has
repeatedly proposed to deepen “Internet + government
services,” streamline government processes, improve service
efficiency, and save people’s processing time and other
policies, as an attempt to ensure the steady implementation
of the strategy of “promoting the modernization of national
governance systems and governance capabilities.” Smart
government complies with the development of the times. By
improving the scientific decision-making capacity of the
government, reducing the red tape of business handling,
arousing the initiative of diversified governance, and
building a novel model of accurate governance and multi-
party coordination, the production and life of enterprises
and the public will be ensured to be optimized and con-
venient. However, the implementing effect of smart gov-
ernment is hindered by the high cost of platform
construction [3], system security risks [4], as well as the
ambiguity of the rights and responsibilities of governance
bodies [5]. As suggested by the Internet Service Capability
Development Report of Local Governments in China (2019)
[6], 217 prefecture-level administrative regions in China
have rolled out Internet government service projects. To be
specific, 14 local governments exhibited prominent Internet
service response capability. However, 117 prefecture-level
cities remained, and Internet government services continue
to progress steadily and develop urgently. ,us, under the
existing obstacles, drawing on national policy calls and
guidance only cannot further boost the steady progress of
smart government affairs.
Numerous factors are restricting the implementation of
smart government affairs (e.g., “information island” and
“data chimney” [7]; system loopholes and privacy disclosure
[8]; and risks and benefits of multiple parties and uneven
distribution of rights and obligations [9]). To address such a
restriction, the government employs data collection, data
interoperability, and incentives for business collaboration
and subsequently reshapes government service processes
and other public management methods to boost itself to
achieve informatization [10]. For implementing effects, good
effects have been achieved, among which big data technology
driving [11] and cross-department information sharing [12]
exert the critical effects. Besides, different performance as-
sessment systems and reward and punishment mechanisms
help tackle down the bottleneck problem when promoting
smart government affairs. For instance, the construction of
the intelligent government information ecological assess-
ment system, the influencing mechanism, and functional
relationship among the driving force, the pressure, and the
state and response factors are clarified to enhance the
comprehensive serviceability of smart government affairs
[13]. Given the service quality and satisfaction of smart
government [12], the assessment index [14] for enhancing
the administrative performance of the local government is

set to promote the steady development of smart government.
,e operation mechanism of “Achievement safety area” is
exploited to encourage local governments to implement
continuous “innovative practice,” and then it is applied for
promoting smart government projects [15]. ,e world is
developing rapidly in emerging technologies in information
technology, whereas the technology is slightly inferior in
smart government projects construction. Accordingly,
emerging technologies should be organically combined with
the smart government to form a novel type of wisdom
characterized by the development of the times. ,e gov-
ernment affairs model is imperative, and blockchain tech-
nology presents novel insights into addressing the bottleneck
problems facing smart government affairs.
,e core concept and significance of blockchain tech-
nology refer to data association [16] and a novel distributed
infrastructure and computing paradigm of epoch-making
significance [17]. As highlighted by the World Economic
Forum in Davos, by 2023, 10% of the global GDP will be
stored in blockchain or blockchain-related technologies, and
the blockchain technology will be extensively exploited by
government agencies [18]. Moreover, China has identified
blockchain as one of the nation’s vital strategic frontier
information technologies [19], an important support for
building a digital China [20]. Blockchain technology is
currently involved in numerous fields of public affairs
management (e.g., public services, social security, public
information and communication, artificial intelligence, and
logistics supply chain). ,e premise for the application of
blockchain technology in smart government affairs indicates
that it has economic profit space and is capable of fitting the
expected returns and returns of social capital to achieve the
maximum benefit. ,us, government departments and
platform users are both partners and rational groups pur-
suing the maximization of their respective interests when
participating in the operation of smart government affairs,
complying consistent with the evolutionary game theory in
economics. Subsequently, it is feasible to use evolutionary
game theory to analyse the blockchain technology to enable
intelligent government collaborative governance [21].
,is study answers the following key questions:
(1) Whether blockchain technology can promote col-
laborative governance among smart government
participants. If so, how the smart government sys-
tem applies blockchain technology requires analysis.
Subsequently, for the stability of collaborative
governance and the possibility of the occurrence of
ideal events, the factors should be elucidated.
(2) If blockchain technology enables collaborative
governance of smart government affairs, the fol-
lowing problems will arise.
(3) How does blockchain technology impact the de-
velopment of collaborative governance of smart
government?
(4) Under “blockchain+ smart government,” how should
the participants select the optimal strategy, i.e., active
collaboration or maintaining the status quo?
(5) How to optimize the smart government collabora-
tive governance model with the empowerment of
blockchain technology?
,e rest of this study is organized as follows. In Section 2,
a comprehensive review of the relevant literature on
blockchain technology and smart government is presented.
In Section 3, the characteristics of blockchain technology
and smart government are combined to build a revised
version of smart government platform architecture with
blockchain technology, building a theoretical framework for
relevant research. In Section 4, the evolutionary game model
is adopted to analyse how to achieve the game evolution and
stability strategy of functional departments, local govern-
ments, and end users, as well as how to achieve a tripartite
cooperation equilibrium. In Section 5, the case of “block-
chain + government services” in Beijing is analysed, system
dynamics theory is combined to change the assignment of
external variables, and the influence mechanism of the three
parties is simulated actively using blockchain technology to
deepen the collaborative governance of smart government
affairs. In Section 6, the research findings are summarized
and corresponding policies are formulated.
2. Literature Review
Existing studies on the application of blockchain technology
in government affairs service primarily focus on the mac-
roscopic and microscopic levels. At the macroscopic level,
domestic and foreign scholars analysed the technological
advantages of blockchain application in government services
and studied each policy of “blockchain + government ser-
vices.” When comparing the application of blockchain to
government service policies in a range of nations, the re-
searchers indicated the advantages brought by advanced
technology, analysed the possible defects and proposed the
corresponding suggestions [22–24]. Local governments can
refer to the mentioned studies in their decision-making to
assess the possibility of applying blockchain technology to
government services in their regions. At the microscopic
level, existing studies primarily assessed security concerns in
governmental use of blockchain technology [25], the ap-
plication of blockchain to e-Residency [26], blockchain and
big data combine to elevate the level of urban governance
and social information [12, 27], financial network gover-
nance and freight assessment [28–30], and smart city gov-
ernance [31, 32]. As a research hotspot in the
multidisciplinary field, such a type of research covers most
aspects of the development of “blockchain + government
service,” whereas it lacks systematic and dynamic research
methods.
As demonstrated above, there is little guidance con-
cerning the dynamic evolution of behaviour strategies be-
tween government service participants under the blockchain
technology (i.e., policies and measures aimed at facilitating
collaborative behaviours among participants). Such a type
research combines macro and micro levels and considers
government service participants’ characteristics. Kallstrom
and Mauro analysed a process of citizens’ and stakeholders’
Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 3
engagement promoted by a local authority to codesign the
city vision with multiple actors (e.g., politicians, public
managers, consultants, citizens, and other external stake-
holders). ,ey consider that the players in the game are
completely rational, and the policy is statically implemented
[33]. However, behavioural psychology reveals that deci-
sion-makers are short-sighted and heterogeneous, and all
parties are inclined to bounded rationality [34]. In practice,
China’s e-government service development remains in the
initial stage for the immaturity in core technologies, im-
perfect infrastructure, and cognition of participants [35]. In
online government services, local governments, functional
departments, and end users interact dynamically. ,e three
parties should share their own experiences and modify their
strategies repeatedly by keeping abreast with external en-
vironment changes. Accordingly, the premise of bounded
rationality and dynamic evolution of the evolutionary game
theory comparatively abides by the behaviour rules and
decision-making characteristics of local governments,
functional departments, and end users. For instance, Zhang
and Li studied multiagent collaborative governance for
targeted poverty alleviation based on the evolutionary game
analysis framework [36]. ,ey built a three-agent evolu-
tionary game model of local governments, social organi-
zations, and poor groups, and they investigated the impact of
their behaviour decisions on multiagent cooperative gov-
ernance of targeted poverty alleviation. However, the dis-
cussion on the stability of the cooperative governance system
was ignored. Zhang et al. [37], Xu et al. [38], and Chen et al.
[39] initially carried out evolutionary game modelling to
study the coordinated governance of haze by heterogeneous
governments, heavy metal pollution control in soil, and the
relationship among government, the enterprise, and the
public in environmental governance from the perspective of
stakeholders’ strategy selection. Subsequently, they verified
game models and theoretical results based on numerical
examples, case studies, and empirical analysis, respectively.
Wan and Qie [40] and Hou and Li [41] investigated the
tripartite game between the government smart financial
poverty alleviation ecosystem and the collaborative inno-
vation system of IoT. As impacted by the different research
perspectives and points of departure, the existing studies
failed to consider the optimization effect of emerging
technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, cloud
computing, and blockchain) on smart platform systems, as
well as the interactive decision-making behaviour and
evolutionary stable state of intelligent platform system
participants under the novel technology. ,us, the realiza-
tion of interagent cooperative behaviour and the impact of
external factors on interagent cooperative behaviour are
largely ignored. In practice, the lack of theoretical research
causes weak guidance. To effectively promote the intelligent
platform system empowered by emerging technology and
form the situation of multisubject collaborative participa-
tion, further research is required in China.
As the current smart platform systems are plagued by
system vulnerabilities, privacy disclosure, trust crisis, and
others, a modified smart government platform architecture
is developed here under the blockchain technology and uses
the replicator dynamic analysis method to model the de-
cision-making of the three main participants of smart
government. ,is study explores how the dynamic inter-
action between local governments, functional departments,
and end users impacts the behaviour of participants, while
determining the main factors of the multiagent collaborative
governance in the complex system of “blockchain + smart
government,” which can effectively guide decision-making
of local governments, functional departments, and end
users.
,e differences between this study and the relevant
literature are presented below. ,is study (1) attempts to
explore the architecture of a smart government platform
with blockchain technology, (2) analyses the major stake-
holders under this framework and considers the evolu-
tionary game situation of stakeholders under the condition
of bounded rationality, (3) obtains the stable state, and (4)
draws the key factors for the collaborative governance of
smart government with blockchain technology.
3. Collaborative Governance Model of Smart
Government with Blockchain Technology
3.1. Basic Ideas. ,e smart government refers to the resource
integration and system integration between government
internal business systems and external (parallel/subordinate)
functional departments. It seeks to achieve the reprovi-
sioning and integration of government processes and re-
sources to provide convenient, high-quality, and low-cost
one-stop services to the public and enterprises, to link the
cross-functional departments and system integration to
complete approval in parallel, to carry out the transparent,
clean, and efficient operation of the online administrative
management system, and to build a through service bus that
comprises process engine management, intranet portal,
extranet business, and thematic database and derivative
central database [42]. However, the “blockchain technology-
based collaborative governance model for smart government
affairs” indicates that to solve the obstacles and difficulties
facing existing smart government affairs, the original smart
government affairs technical framework is revised by in-
troducing blockchain technology (see Figure 3). Blockchain
technology features (e.g., “decentralized” structure, “detrust”
structure, and “precision” mechanism) can effectively tackle
down various obstacles facing smart government affairs.
,is architecture corresponds to the blockchain 6-tier
structure to the ISO7-tier structure and modifies it. Given
relational data (e.g., Oracle) and various algorithm tech-
nologies, the consensus layer and the incentive layer are the
core service layers of the blockchain, overlaying end user
service business function scenarios to form an efficient, safe,
and credible government service system. ,e tamper-proof
and asymmetric encryption technology of blockchain can
ensure the security and privacy of data storage. As ensured
by peer-to-peer equality protocol and peer-to-peer trans-
mission technology, the information in the system can be
exchanged, recognized, and transmitted in an unimpeded
manner. Various efficient algorithms to achieve interaction
process fast, short response time, and strong fault tolerance
4 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
are conducive to value themutual recognition and behaviour
consensus. Technology features (e.g., decentralization,
traceability, editability, security, and reliability) ensure that
multiple governance subjects can forge a multiple collabo-
rative governance situation [43]. Accordingly, this model
significantly improves the security, convenience, coordi-
nation, and intelligence of the original system, thereby in-
creasing social capital and economic benefits.
3.2. Stakeholder Analysis. For all stakeholders, in the col-
laborative governance model of smart government with
blockchain technology, the collaborative governance bodies
involved include functional departments, local govern-
ments, and end users. ,e starting point of each subject is
different, so its basic idea of participating in smart gov-
ernment affairs is based on different decision-making
behaviours attributed to different positions and perspectives
of all parties in the process of platform operation. According
to Figure 4, from the perspective of the goals of collaborative
governance entities, the goals of local government depart-
ments, functional gates, and end users are identical. ,ey
overall use blockchain technology to obtain better smart
government operations and use effects, and they achieve
more a considerable number of total benefits. ,is also
complies with the behaviour of “rational people” from the
perspective of economics, i.e., the pursuit of self-interest
maximization. For each subject, the model refers to a Pareto
improvement process. ,e subject's focus is different be-
cause its goal is to maximize self-interests. To be specific,
local governments are concerned with whether the benefits
of social public services can be maximized, functional de-
partments stress whether their business service levels and
performance gains are maximized, and end users are more

concerned with maximizing the overall benefits (e.g., ease of
use, security, and satisfaction). However, through contin-
uous adjustment and optimization under the long-term
contractual relationship of the parties, the respective ad-
vantages can be exploited to lastly achieve the win-win
cooperation of all parties and achieve the maximization of
self-interest under the smart government coordinated
governance with blockchain technology.
3.3. Profit Mechanism. In the application of blockchain
technology for constructing smart government affairs
projects, only when the total revenue of system operation is
greater than the total cost of construction can the project be
implemented. ,us, to ensure the smooth operation and
promotion of blockchain-based smart government projects, the
future direct income and potential income should be balanced
and coordinated after the operation to ensure the realization of
“Pareto optimality” between the incomes of all parties par-
ticipating in collaborative governance, as well as mobilize the
enthusiasm of all subjects maximally. Combined with the
advantages of blockchain technology, the present study makes
an in-depth analysis of the economic benefits in the collabo-
rative governance model of smart government based on
blockchain technology as shown in Figure 5.
3.4. Collaborative Governance Organizational Structure.
,ough in the collaborative governance model of smart
government with blockchain technology, the stakeholders
involved mainly include functional departments, local
governments, and end users. However, the operation of
smart government projects is highly technical, which con-
tinues to operate, exhibits strong externalities, and involves
numerous participants; the relationship between them is
very sophisticated as well, covering third-party companies
(e.g., system development companies, operation and
maintenance outsourcing parties, and blockchain technol-
ogy providers), as well as nongovernmental organizations
(e.g., chambers of commerce and social groups). Based on
the existing research results, the present study analyses and
designs the operation organization structure of the smart
government collaborative governance model with block-
chain technology (see Figure 6).

departments do not choose “blockchain + government ser-
vices” technology, that the local government does loose
supervision, and that end users do not use smart government
platform, respectively.
C4 refers to the cost paid by the functional departments
when they do not choose blockchain + government services
technology strategies. I2 and βS2, respectively, represent the
benefit increase that the functional departments can obtain
by drawing upon blockchain + government services tech-
nology. C3 represents the cost of functional departments
when they comply with blockchain + government services
technology strategy.
C2 denotes cost paid by the local government when
they do not choose strict supervision. C1 represents cost
paid by the local government when they choose strict
supervision. Under functional departments choosing
negative strategy, A1 and αS1, respectively, represent the
benefit increase of the government when the government
follows the “strict supervision” strategies. Under end users
choosing use strategy, P1 represent punishments paid by
the government when the government adopts the “Loose
supervision” strategy.
C5 represents cost paid by the end users when they do
not exploit smart government platform. I3 denotes the utility
increase of the end users when they follow smart govern-
ment platform. When local governments select “Loose su-
pervision” strategies, the end users can suffer P1 from a loss
of privacy.
Under blockchain + government services technology, the
coefficient of improving the precision service level for the
functional departments is β when they follow positive
strategies. ,e coefficient of optimizing the flat management
efficiency of the public management structure for the local
government is α when they select strict supervision strate-
gies. ,e coefficient of empowering trust for the end users is
c when they comply with strategies. According to the actual
situation, we suppose that 0 ≤α, β, c ≤1. ,e corresponding
parameters are listed in Table 1.
4.2. Model Construction. Based on the mentioned model
assumptions, the present study builds a three-party payoff
matrix of functional departments, local government, and
end users. ,e first, second, and third functions represent
the functional departments’ payoff, the payoff of local
government, and the payoff of end users, respectively. ,e
specific form of the payoff matrix of each party is listed in
Table 2.

Subsequently, the evolution and stability strategies of the
three main agents of functional departments, local gov-
ernments, and end users can be discussed.
(1) 9e Asymptotic Stability Analysis of Functional Depart-
ments.,e first partial derivative of the replication dynamic
equation with positive strategy for x can be determined by
equation (10):
zF(x)
zx
� (1 − 2x) C4 − C3 +(y − 1)P2 + yP4 + yzβS2( 􏼁.
(14)
If we set
Πx � C4 − C3 +(y − 1)P2 + yP4 + yzβS2( 􏼁, (15)
and from Πx � 0, the following equation is yielded:
λy �
P2 + C3 − C4
P2 + P4 + zβS2
. (16)
,en, we have Conclusion 1. enun_Conclusion_1
Conclusion 1. When Πx > 0, the positive strategy of func-
tional departments is the evolutionary stability strategy;
when Πx < 0, the negative strategy of the functional de-
partments is an evolutionary stability strategy. Furthermore,
the probability of x increases, while the probability of y and z
is elevated.
Theorem 1. Πx � 0 is the dividing line of the stable state of
functional departments (see Figure 7(a)). According to the
stability theorem of the differential equation, whenΠx > 0 has
F(x)
′ > 0, F(x)
′ < 0, it indicates the stable state of positive
strategy of functional departments, while the negative strategy
is unstable (see Figure 7(b)). Likewise, when Πx < 0 has
F(x)
′(0)< 0, F(x)
′(1)> 0, it indicates that the negative strategy
of the functional departments is in a stable state, while the
positive strategy is unstable (see Figure 7(c)).
When y> λy, (F(x)/dx)|x�1<0, indicating that the evo-
lution stable strategy of the functional departments is x � 1.
In other words, functional departments are inclined to follow
a positive strategy under the probability of y higher than λy.
When y< λy, (F(x)/dx)|x�0<0, indicating that the evo-
lution stable strategy of the functional departments is x � 0.
In other words, functional departments tend to select a
negative strategy when the probability of y is lower than λy.
Likewise, we can prove the relationship between z and x.
As revealed from the results, the decision-making
behaviour of functional departments is affected by nu-
merous factors. According to the formula, the positive
decision (x) of functional departments increases with the
increase in local governments’ strict supervision strategy
(y) and end user use strategy (z). Besides, the smaller the
difference between the cost expenditure of optimizing
smart government business by positively using blockchain
technology and the cost expenditure of negatively using
blockchain technology, the higher the distortion loss of
mass data collection and processing attributed to not
using blockchain technology, and the higher the system
security problem and the precision service income
brought by blockchain technology when local govern-
ments are lax in supervision, the higher the possibility for
functional departments will choose the positive strategy.
(2) 9e Asymptotic Stability Analysis of Local Government.
,e first partial derivative of the replication dynamic
equation with strict supervision strategy for y can be ob-
tained according to equation (11):
zF(y)
zy
� (1 − 2y) C2 − C1 + A1 − xA1 + zP1 + xzαS1( 􏼁.
(17)
If
Πy � C2 − C1 + A1 − xA1 + zP1 + zxαS1, (18)
and from Πy � 0, the following equation is yielded:
λx �
C1 − C2 − A1 − zP1
zαS1 − A1
. (19)
,en, we have Conclusion 2. enun_Conclusion_2
Conclusion 2. When Πy > 0, the strict supervision strategy
of local government is the evolutionary stability strategy;
when Πy < 0, the negative strategy of the functional de-
partments is an evolutionary stability strategy. Moreover, the
probability of y increases while the probability of x and z is
elevated.
Theorem 2. Πy � 0 is the boundary line of the stable state of
local government (see Figure 8(a)). According to the stability
theorem of the differential equation, when Πy > 0 has
F(y)
′ (0)> 0, F(y)
′ (1)< 0, it indicates that the local government is
in a stable state when strict supervision strategy is adopted, while
the loose supervision strategy is unstable (see Figure 8(b)).
Likewise, when Πy < 0 has F(y)
′(0)< 0, F(y)
′(1)> 0, this indi-
cates that local government is in a stable state when it choose loose
supervision strategy, while strict supervision strategy is unstable
(see Figure 8(c)).
When x> λx(dF(y)/dy)|y�1<0, indicating that the evo-
lution stable strategy of the local government is y � 1. In
other words, local government tends to select a strict su-
pervision strategy when the probability of y is higher than λx.
When x< λx, (dF(y)/dy)|y�0<0, indicating that the
evolution stable strategy of the local government is y � 0. In
other words, local government tends to select a loose su-
pervision strategy when the probability of y is lower than λx.
Likewise, we can prove the relationship between z and y.
As revealed from the analysis results, the decision-
making behaviour of the local government is affected by
many factors.,e formula shows that the local government’s
strict supervision (y) and decision-making will increase with
the increase in the positive strategy (x) of the functional
department and the end user strategy (z). Besides, the
smaller the difference between the cost of strict supervision
10 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
by local governments and the cost of lax supervision, the
greater the extra benefit from the irregularities of functional
departments under strict supervision. ,e risk of data se-
curity attributed to government neglect of supervision
damages the credibility of the government and the increase
of the income from the flat management of functional de-
partments actively using blockchain technology to optimize
the public management structure, which will directly affect

make final strict supervision decisions.
(3) 9e Asymptotic Stability Analysis of End Users. ,e first
partial derivative of the replication dynamic equation with
strict supervision strategy for y can be obtained according to
equation (12)
zF(z)

� (1 − 2z) I3 + C5 − (1 − y)P3 + xycS3( 􏼁. (20)
If we set
Πz � I3 + C5 − (1 − y)P3 + xycS3( 􏼁, (21)
and from Πz � 0, the following equation is yielded:
λy �
P3 − C5 − I3
P3 + xcS3
. (22)
,en, we have Conclusion 3.enun_Conclusion_3
Conclusion 3. When Πz > 0, the use strategy of end users is
the evolutionary stability strategy; when Πz < 0, the nonuse
strategy of end users is an evolutionary stability strategy.
Moreover, the probability of z increases while the probability
of x and y increases.
Theorem 3. Πz � 0 is the dividing line of end users’ stable state
(see Figure 9(a)). Under the stability theorem of the differential
equation, when Πz > 0 has F(z)
′(0)> 0, F(z)
′(1)< 0, it indicates
that end users use the smart government platform in a stable state
(see Figure 9(b)). Likewise, when Πz < 0 has
F(z)
′(0)< 0, F(z)
′(1)> 0, it indicates that the end user does not
use the strategy in a stable state, but the use strategy is unstable
(see Figure 9(c)).
When y> λy, (dF(z)/dz)|z�1<0, indicating that the
evolution stable strategy of the end users is z � 1. In other
words, end users are inclined to select a use strategy when
the probability of y is higher than λy.
When y< λy, (dF(z)/dz)|z�0<0, indicating that the
evolution stable strategy of the end users is z � 0. In other
words, end users are inclined to select a nonuse strategy
when the probability of y is lower than λy. Likewise, we can
prove the relationship between x and z.
As suggested from the analysis results, for the end users,
it can be seen from the formula that the use of decision (z)
increases with the increase in positive strategy (x) of
functional departments and strict supervision strategy (y) of
local government. ,e greater the comprehensive income
and the total cost when not in use, the greater the credit
confirmation income and privacy risk loss obtained by the
user when using the blockchain technology and the higher
the possibility of end users choosing the use strategy.

,e evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) for replicating
the dynamic equation system is formulated based on the
local stability analysis of the Jacobian matrix of the system
with the method proposed by Friedman. Moreover, the
12 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
Jacobian matrix of the system is obtained from equation (23)
as follows:
J �
(1 − 2x) C4 − C3 +(y − 1)P2 + yP4 + yzβS2( 􏼁 (1 − x)x P4 + P2 + zβS2( 􏼁 (1 − x)xyβS2

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦.
(26)
According to the replication dynamic equation system
(13), the local equilibrium point is yielded as follows:
ξ1(0, 0, 0), ξ2(1, 0, 0), ξ3(1, 1, 0), ξ4(1, 1, 1), ξ5(0, 1, 0),
ξ6(0, 1, 1), ξ7(0, 0, 1), ξ8(1, 0, 1). By complying with Lya-
punov stability theorem, when all eigenvalues (λ) of the
Jacobian matrix satisfy λ< 0, the equilibrium point is the
asymptotically stable. ,at is the confluence. When all ei-
genvalues of the Jacobian matrix satisfy λ> 0, the equilib-
rium point is unstable, which is the source. Furthermore, for
the Jacobian matrix, the eigenvalues (λ) mixed states. In
other words, some are positive, while others are negative.
,en, the equilibrium point, also termed as the saddle point,
is unstable. First, for the case where the equilibrium point is
ξ1(0, 0, 0), the Jacobian matrix is as follows:
J1 �
C4 − C3 − P2 0 0
0 C2 − C1 + A1 0
0 0 I3 + C5 − P3
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦. (27)
It is therefore indicated that the eigenvalues of the Ja-
cobian matrix are λ1 � C4 − C3 − P2, λ2 � C2 − C1 + A1, and
λ3 � I3 + C5 − P3. With the identical analogy, the 8 equi-
librium points are substituted into the Jacobian matrix (26),
respectively, and the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix
corresponding to the equilibrium points can be determined,
respectively (Table 3).
According to the mentioned analysis, the evolutionary
game system has stability under certain conditions. How-
ever, many parameters are accordingly involved, and the
characteristic value (λ) symbol is determined by the size of
the mentioned parameter values. Under the existing known
mathematical derivation method, the stability of each of the
Nash equilibrium is determined, and the evolutionary game
model cannot effectively lead to the reach steady state
equilibrium. Accordingly, this article further employs sys-
tem dynamics to analyse the impact of various uncertain
factors on the evolution of the game and lays a basis for
formulating relevant policies.

management science and systems science and incorporated
computerized simulation technology into quantitative an-
alyses to develop a system dynamics theory method. It is
primarily adopted to study system problems with high
nonlinearity, as characterized by multivariate, causal feed-
back, and complex time-varying.
,us, to systematically and deeply analyse the strategic
interaction between different agents, the present study uses
the system dynamics theory to build a dynamic model of an
intelligent government collaborative governance system
based on blockchain technology, and the simulation of
system dynamics with VENSIM PLE simulation software is
employed to analyse the evolution of the strategic
interaction.
5.1. Based on the SD Model of “Blockchain +Government
Affairs Service” in Beijing. Since November 2019, Beijing
Municipal Government Service Bureau, Beijing Municipal
Science and Technology Commission, and BeijingMunicipal
Bureau of Economy and Information Technology have led
the implementation of the Action Plan on the application of
blockchain in the field of Government Services. ,e Beijing
Municipal Bureau of Commerce and other departments, as
the responsible units, have vigorously propelled the appli-
cation construction of blockchain in government services in
the four pilot areas of the city. By August 2020, 140 gov-
ernment affairs services have been connected in Beijing, 253
business affairs and 65 human affairs have been settled
online, and 100,000 pieces of administrative materials can be
simplified throughout the year. ,ere have been 121 en-
terprises having used the blockchain system to query and
verify various functions for nearly 7,800 times. ,e reported
data have been down-regulated by 80%, and the average
material has decreased by 40%.
,is study combines the specific application scenarios of
blockchain pilots in Haidian, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Shunyi
and other blockchain pilots in the “Blue Book on the Ap-
plication of Blockchain in Municipal Services in Beijing
(First Edition)” issued by the Beijing Municipal Adminis-
tration in July 2020. Vensim PLE software is employed to
build the system dynamics model of the evolutionary game
between functional departments, local governments, and
end users (see Figure 10).
5.2. Initial SimulationAnalysis. According to the application
practice of the blockchain in the government service field of
Beijing, the initial value of the model is assumed as follows:
INITIAL TIME� 0, FINAL TIME� 20, TIME-
STEP� 0.0625, and Units for Time :Month, and the 16
external variables are assigned as shown in Table 4.
Since the three participating agents of functional
departments, local governments, and end users have two
kinds of strategy choices, 0 and 1, this constitutes 8
strategy combinations, namely, (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0),
(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1). When the
initial states of the three parties are pure strategies, the
system is in equilibrium. At this time, no one party is
willing to actively change the existing strategies, and the
mentioned eight strategy combinations will become the
equilibrium state of the system. However, this state is not
stable, as long as there is a small change in one or more
subjects in the system, and the system will lose the
equilibrium state. We take the combination of (0, 0, 1)
strategy as an example to illustrate, and its evolution
results are shown in Figure 11(a). ,is figure indicates that
the initial probabilities of the functional departments
choosing the positive strategy and the local government
choosing the strict supervision strategy are very low (both
0.01); in the game process, when the participants find that
there are more profitable strategy choices in the system, it
will adjust the original strategy, and through the con-
tinuous learning and imitating between the subjects, the
system can lastly reach a novel equilibrium state.
,e simulation of 8 pure strategy combinations is
summarized as follows.①No matter the positive strategy of
the functional departments starts from 0 to 0.01 or from 1 to
0.99, and its strategy choice will eventually reach an equi-
librium state at 1. It is therefore revealed that in smart
government projects, functional departments actively draw
upon the smart government platform under the blockchain
technology to complete the business, which is the optimal
choice. Only the active use of blockchain technology to
optimize the existing platform workflow can ensure its
maximum revenue. ② Under functional departments
adopting positive strategies, if the local government adopts a
strategy of loose supervision, no matter whether the end
users change from 0 or 1, the final strategy is 1, i.e., (1, 0, 0)
and (1, 0, 1). ,e evolution result of the two strategy
combinations refers to (1, 0, 1) (see Figure 11(b)). If the local
government carries out strict regulation, the end users will
mutate from 0 or 1, and the final strategy will be 1, namely,

combinations is (1, 1, 1) (see Figure 11(c)).

Moreover, it is revealed that the end users have a positive
attitude towards the use of smart government affairs, and
they are willing to use the platform to complete business
transactions. As suggested from the analysis, through the
evolutionary game process of “mutation-adjustment-equi-
librium” of the three agents of the game, the system will
eventually reach the equilibrium state of (1, 1, 1).
5.3. SimulationAnalysis of the Impact of ExternalVariables on
Strategy. Based on the above discussion, the value of each
parameter determines whether each strategy combination is
the equilibrium point to make the system stable state, and
the impact of external variables on the strategy selection of
the game subject is analysed.,e following continues to take
(0, 0, 1) strategy combination as an example to discuss.
5.3.1. Factors of Functional Departments’ Strategy Choice.
In the policy combination of (0, 0, 1), the initial state of
functional departments refers to a negative strategy. It is
assumed that the functional departments start from the
probability of 0.01. As indicated from the simulation, among
the 16 external variables, the cost of a positive strategy C3,
the cost of a negative strategy C4, revenue from precision
services S2, loss of system security risk P2, loss of information
distortion attributed to mass data collection and processing
P4, and the mentioned five external variables will impact the
strategic choice of functional departments. In particular,
accurate service degree coefficient β should be stressed,
which is the use of blockchain technology to enhance the
serviceability of functional departments. By regulating the
value of β, the precision income will be affected. Under other
initial values unchanged, the evolution result of strategy
choice probability of functional departments is analysed (see
Figure 12).
As revealed from the comparison of Figures 12(b), 12(c),
and 12(e), C4, P2, and P4 similarly impact the evolution trend
of positive strategy choice in functional departments. ,e
higher the cost for functional departments to negatively
exploit blockchain technology, the smaller the loss of system
security risk when using blockchain technology, and the
greater the loss of information distortion attributed to mass
data collection and processing when not using blockchain
technology, the more functional departments will be in-
clined to comply with the strategy of positively using
blockchain technology. In addition, according to the
simulation analysis, C3 complexly impacts the strategy
selection of functional departments. Under the extremely
large C3 value, functional departments are inclined to use
blockchain technology negatively; in particular, when the
value is smaller, the faster the functional departments will
reach the stable state of positive strategy. It is also revealed
that when functional departments positively exploit
blockchain technology to complete smart government
business, the cost acts as a critical factor; when the cost is
too high, it will impact the choice of their strategies.

Likewise, the precision service degree coefficient β
brought by blockchain technology to functional depart-
ments also impacts the choice of their strategies.
Figure 12(e) indicates that when the degree of precision
service is improved, the functional departments approach
the positive strategy faster, whereas under the income of
precision service reaching a certain degree, the impact on
convergence turns out to be slight.
5.3.2. 9e Factors of Local Government Strategy Choice.
As revealed from the simulation, the mentioned external
variables will affect the local government’s strategy choice
(e.g., the cost C1 under strict supervision, the cost C2 under
loose supervision, the incentive income A1 under illegal
operation, the credibility P1 under data security risk loss, as
well as the degree coefficient α of flat management) (see
Figure 13). With the decrease in the value of C1 and the
increase in the values of C2, A1, and P1, local government is
more inclined to adopt a strict supervision strategy, and their
evolution path displays an S-type growth trend. Besides, it
can be seen from Figure 13(d) that when the value of P1 is
less than a certain value, the local government will eventually
choose the strategy of loose supervision. As can be seen from
Figure 13(c), the A1 value is the reward income of local
government for discovering illegal operations in functional
departments. Accordingly, the strategy selection of local
governments is influenced by functional departments. Local
governments play a normative and guiding role in the be-
haviour of functional departments. An appropriate increase
in A1 value can promote local governments to choose a strict
supervision strategy. ,e value of P1 is the public credibility
compromised by the data security risk. When loose su-
pervise undermines credibility, local government is
emboldened to go slow.When the credibility of the damaged
government is high, the local government has a sense of

crisis. To maintain their good image, they must strictly
supervise and ensure the reputation of the government.
Likewise, Figure 13(e) indicates that when the value α is the
local government’s strict supervision, the higher the ratio of
the flat public management efficiency, the faster the local
government’s strict supervision strategy will approach to 1.
However, when the ratio of the flat public management
efficiency reaches a certain degree, the impact on the con-
vergence is not so obvious.
5.3.3. 9e Factors of the End Users’ Strategy Choice.
Given the simulation analysis results, the variables (e.g., the
benefits of personalized service received by the end user via
the smart government platform I3, the cost of going to the
hall for business C5, the loss of user privacy and security risk
P3, and the coefficient of users’ trust confirmation) signif-
icantly impact the user strategy choice (see Figure 14).
Figures 14(a) and 14(b) indicate that when users draw upon
the smart government platform for business, the greater the

revenue and the higher the cost of business without using the
platform, the more likely they will be to comply with the use
strategy. According to Figure 14(c), when the local gov-
ernment is lax in supervision and the users cause the loss of
privacy security risk of the smart government platform to be
higher than a certain value, the users’ profit from using the
platform will be damaged, and the users are inclined to choose
to still go to the service hall to handle business. It is therefore
suggested that the strategy choice of users displays a tight
association with the supervision intensity of local governments.
Figure 14(d) suggests that the trust mechanism of blockchain
technology mentioned in extensive studies had slight effects on
the choice of smart government platform with blockchain
technology in this study model. ,is may be explained as the
trust mechanism under blockchain technology is a trust
completely based on machine and logic. Users do not have
intuitive feelings when using, so it slightly impacts users’ de-
cision-making behaviour.

6. Conclusions
Compared with the existing online government affairs opera-
tion model, the smart government affairs collaborative gover-
nance model with blockchain technology is conducive to
building a data credibility mechanism and solving the problems
of trust uncertainty, nontampering, and traceability, while ef-
fectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of multiple participation in
governance, forging a novel situation of collaborative gover-
nance of multiple subjects, and achieving the cooperationmode
of “government-led, market operation, and multiple
participation.” With evolutionary game theory to analyse the
cooperation strategies of functional departments, local gov-
ernments, and end users in the smart government collaborative
governance model with blockchain technology, it is found that
the change of the general equilibrium point (saddle point)
impacts the change of game evolution characteristics and the
stability analysis of the evolutionary game. Based on evolu-
tionary game stability analysis and system dynamics simulation
results, the primary conclusions and limitations are as follows.
First, cost control of collaborative governance is the primary
issue in a blockchain technology smart government system. For

instance, the cost of functional departments participating in the
work of building trusted infrastructure and common underlying
blockchain platforms, as well as the cost of local government
business regulation and technical supervision. On the whole,
they impact the stability of the decision-making behaviour of the
participants in collaborative governance.
Second, information security is a determining factor in
advancing the widespread use of the blockchain smart gov-
ernment system. As indicated from the simulation, when the
immaturity of blockchain technology increases the potential
threat to the information security of the original system re-
placement, this functionwill reduce the comprehensive income
of the smart government system, so functional departments
will not use blockchain technology. Likewise, when end users
use a smart government system that elevates the risk of private
information leakage, they will refuse to use the system and
prefer spending more time going to the lobby to conduct
business.
Lastly, the “decentralized” structure and “precision”
mechanism of blockchain technology can indeed elevate
the level of precision service of functional departments
and the flat management capability of local governments.
However, according to Figures 12(e) and 13(e) of the
simulation, with the coefficient rising to a certain level,
the effect on decision-making behaviour is slight.
However, the impact of blockchain technology’s
“detrust” architecture on the system is relatively weak, as
seen in simulation Figure 14(d), where the increase in
trust factor for end users only changes the smoothness of
the decision curve, whereas it does not affect users’ de-
cision-making behaviour. ,is indicates that in the short
term, the increase in trust level does not noticeably
impact the collaborative governance system.
,ough the research in the present study has certain
practical significance and practical value, there are still limi-
tations and shortcomings. First, the selection of Beijing
“blockchain+ government service” case has its particularity, so
the expansion income is insufficient. Second, based on the
change of external variable assignment to determine the
strategy selection effect, only using case simulation, practical
application should be combined with the concrete situation
which further analysis validation. Lastly, the development of
blockchain technology remains preliminary, and the publicity
and nonprofit nature of government services determine that its
role in the governance process is subject to certain limitations,
requiring in-depth explorations. ,us, further deepening the
model in combination with the reality and more appropriate
simulation and optimization of the smart government col-
laborative governance model with blockchain technology are
the direction of future research.
