)is paper takes the secondary low-carbon supply chain composed of amanufacturer and a retailer as the research object and takes
the government subsidy strategy of low-carbon supply chain as the research theme, the government invests in the construction of
blockchain technology application platform, and supply chain enterprises use blockchain technology for compensation. Under
this background, considering consumers’ low-carbon preference and green trust, a three-stage game model dominated by the
government and followed by manufacturers and retailers under the four scenarios of emission reduction technology input subsidy
and low-carbon product output subsidy before and after the application of blockchain technology is established. By comparing the
optimal social welfare, carbon emission reduction rate, and low-carbon product output under the four scenarios, the optimal
problem of government low-carbon subsidy strategy is discussed. It is found that when the product of consumers’ low-carbon
preference coefficient and green trust coefficient is greater than a certain fixed value, the government can obtain higher social
welfare and promote enterprises’ emission reduction through output subsidies. )e government can always promote the demand
for low-carbon products through output subsidies. When the emission reduction cost coefficient approaches infinity, the demand
for low-carbon products when the government implements output subsidies are four times that when the government implements
technology subsidies. When the single cycle shared cost of the blockchain platform and the unit cost of enterprise application of
blockchain technology are less than a certain threshold, the government’s construction of the blockchain platform can obtain
higher social welfare, promote enterprise emission reduction, and improve consumers’ demand for low-carbon products.
1. Introduction
With the continuous progress of China’s economy and
society, green development has become a national strategy,
and carbon emission reduction is an important measure. Li
Liancheng, an expert from the national development and
Reform Commission, said “the R & amp; D and product
promotion of emission reduction technology improve the
environmental quality of the whole society, which is in-
separable from the guidance of national policies.” )e
government can promote the investment of emission re-
duction technology and increase social welfare through
appropriate low-carbon subsidies to enterprises [1]. As the
representative of the fourth scientific and technological
revolution, blockchain technology is setting off an upsurge
all over the world [2]. In China, blockchain technology has
been officially included in the National Informatization Plan
of the 13th five year plan. )e 2018 white paper on China’s
blockchain Industry issued by the Ministry of industry and
information technology points out that blockchain tech-
nology is gradually infiltrating into physical fields such as
supply chain management. )e introduction of blockchain
technology into low-carbon supply chain can improve the
coordination of low-carbon decision-making of all subjects
in the supply chain and promote enterprise emission re-
duction [3]. In the whole process of emission reduction, the
tamper proof and real-time nature of blockchain technology
can ensure that the government can timely obtain accurate
carbon emission information of enterprises. )e govern-
ment can timely and reasonably adjust the mode and
amount of low-carbon subsidies according to the green
information provided by blockchain, implement green su-
pervision, better restrict enterprise carbon emission, and
encourage enterprise carbon emission reduction [4]. For

example, Shenzhen emission rights’ exchange has cooper-
ated with China energy blockchain laboratory to build a
digital trading platform for green carbon emission reduction
assets based on blockchain, so as to increase enterprise
participation, encourage enterprises to participate in energy
conservation and emission reduction, and consolidate the
achievements of environmental protection. As a tamper
proof, transparent, and reliable database, blockchain has an
impact on the green operation of the supply chain [5]. )e
application of blockchain technology can realize informa-
tion sharing, improve the collaborative operation level and
operation efficiency of the supply chain, and reduce the
period cost [6, 7]. In addition, blockchain technology can
realize product traceability and carbon footprint tracking
and can effectively solve the problem of green trust of
consumers in purchasing green and low-carbon products
[8, 9]. )erefore, it is of great significance to study the
government subsidy strategy of low-carbon supply chain
based on blockchain technology.
At present, the research on the application of blockchain
technology to supply chain is roughly divided into three
aspects. (1) Supply chain finance: Li and He [10] found that
blockchain technology can break the information barrier
between organizations and have a subversive impact on
supply chain financial innovation. Chen et al. [11] used the
newsboy model to compare and analyze the interests of
supply chain members under the blockchain debt transfer
platform mode and the traditional supply chain financing
mode and found that the blockchain debt transfer platform
can increase the output of suppliers and improve the income
of eachmember of the supply chain. (2) Supply chain logistics
information: the government’s low-carbon subsidy policy will
have a great impact on the supply chain emission reduction
decision-making and social welfare. )e government’s low-
carbon subsidies to enterprises mainly include emission re-
duction technology input subsidies (hereinafter referred to as
technology subsidies) and low-carbon product production
subsidies (hereinafter referred to as production subsidies).
)e former is a behavior subsidy to encourage more enter-
prises to invest in R & D of emission reduction technologies,
while the latter is a result subsidy to encourage enterprises
that successfully develop low-carbon products [12]. Existing
studies have found that the proportion change of technology
subsidies has a great impact on the optimal carbon emission
reduction and expected profit of the supply chain and has a
positive change relationship. Production subsidies for low-
carbon products are more conducive to enterprise emission
reduction than taxation for high-carbon products. Some
scholars compared and analyzed the impact of technology
subsidies and output subsidies on social welfare. Dusanee and
Vasileios found that when the technology spillover effect is
high, technology subsidies are conducive to improving social
welfare. When the technology spillover effect is low, the
output subsidy is conducive to improving social welfare. Lee
et al. discussed technology subsidies and output subsidies in
the case of partially privatized duopoly. )e research results
show that output subsidies can bring better social welfare than
technology subsidies, but output subsidies will promote the
government to privatize listed companies. Lu Yali studied the
impact of government technology subsidy policy and output
subsidy policy on social welfare and profits of upstream and
downstream enterprises in equilibrium by constructing a
two-level supply chain game model under the condition of
product R & D by downstream enterprises.
At present, there are many research studies on the ap-
plication of blockchain technology in supply chain and
government low-carbon subsidy strategy, but few scholars
consider the formulation of government low-carbon subsidy
policy under the influence of blockchain technology. In
addition, empirical studies have found that green trust plays
a key role in consumers’ purchase intention of green and
low-carbon products, while the existing literature lacks
quantitative research on consumers’ green trust. )erefore,
considering the impact of blockchain technology application
platform construction cost, blockchain technology appli-
cation cost, consumers’ low-carbon preference, and green
trust on supply chain emission reduction, this paper es-
tablishes a three-stage game model dominated by the gov-
ernment and followed by manufacturers and retailers. By
comparing the social welfare under the four scenarios of
technology subsidy and output subsidy before and after the
application of blockchain technology carbon emission re-
duction rate and output of low-carbon products, we analyze
the impact of blockchain technology application and dif-
ferent low-carbon subsidy strategies on social welfare,
carbon emission reduction rate, and output of low-carbon
products and provide targeted suggestions for the govern-
ment to make low-carbon subsidy decisions under the
background of blockchain technology.
)e rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is
based on the related work. Section 3 contains the model
construction and solution. Section 4 has numerical example,
and Section 5 is the concluding section.
2. Related Work
Collaborative emission reduction is an important way to
improve the emission reduction efficiency of upstream and
downstream enterprises in the supply chain. For example,
Wal Mart promoted the improvement of packaging and
printing processes of 60000 suppliers by integrating supplier
production and supply modes, effectively reducing the carbon
emission of 5% (667000m3) of its total packaging and
printing volume. However, the current supply chain per-
formance optimization mainly depends on the decision-
making of core enterprises. Due to the lack of trust mech-
anism, this centralized network structure makes it difficult to
realize information sharing among core enterprises, noncore
enterprises, and consumers. Information asymmetry is an
important factor affecting the efficiency of supply chain
collaborative emission reduction (Nouira et al., 2016 [1]).
At present, the main method to solve the information
asymmetry is the principal-agent theory. Zhang et al. [5]
pointed out that when the contemporary manager’s infor-
mation is incomplete, the agent has private information, and
the trustee cannot fully monitor the agent’s behavior; it is
necessary to provide an incentive and feasible contract to
control the agent’s behavior. )is method mainly solves the
2 Mobile Information Systems
problem of information asymmetry when the two subjects
participate in emission reduction. For example, Qu et al. [6]
believe that core enterprises usually cooperate with noncore
enterprises to jointly improve corporate social responsibility
awareness (including environmental responsibility aware-
ness). Building a principal-agent model can solve the
problem of how to improve corporate social responsibility
when there is information asymmetry between core enter-
prises and noncore enterprises. Lin et al. [7] build a prin-
cipal-agent model between core enterprises and noncore
enterprises. Core enterprises can effectively promote non-
core enterprises’ emission reduction through incentive
contracts. Hao et al. [8] believe that the information ad-
vantage party (noncore enterprise) prefers to make later
decisions, while the information disadvantage party (core
enterprise) prefers to make decisions first. Information
asymmetry has a certain impact on the decision-making
order of enterprises.
Aiming at the problem of information asymmetry among
multiple subjects in the supply chain, ① when the core
enterprise is the manufacturer and the noncore enterprise is
the retailer, the leading manufacturer is not likely to lie about
its carbon emission information, while the follower retailer
may hide the carbon emission information, and the revenue-
sharing contract can better coordinate the income among the
members of the supply chain. It can effectively force retailers
to disclose their true carbon information [9]. Lin Zhibing
believes that when manufacturers’ estimation of the exter-
nality of green product network meets certain conditions and
retailers will share their own information, which is beneficial
to both manufacturers and retailers. ② When the core en-
terprise is the manufacturer and the noncore enterprise is the
supplier, Chen et al. [11] assumed that the supplier’s emission
reduction rate information is asymmetric, constructed the
supplier andmanufacturer’s supply chain system, and studied
how the manufacturer designs the contract so that single and
multiple suppliers can truly disclose the emission reduction
rate information and further studied how the optimal order
quantity of manufacturers changes under the carbon trading
system, which provides a certain research basis for manu-
facturers’ procurement under information asymmetry. Yu
et al. [13] believed that, under information asymmetry, en-
terprises can identify it suppliers with different capabilities
and improve their efforts by designing the optimal contract
menu. )e information-sharing mechanism based on cen-
tralization in the above research is only one-sided sharing.
)e current research does not involve multiparty information
sharing. Followers only disclose some information or falsely
report information, which still cannot fundamentally solve
the problem of effective information circulation and sharing
among various subjects [14, 15].
Unlike the previous centralized information sharing
mechanisms, the decentralized feature of blockchain can fully
realize the bilateral sharing of information under the con-
dition of ensuring users’ privacy [1], effectively solve the
problem of information asymmetry among multiple subjects
[4], and reduce the risk caused by unilateral information
sharing. )e decentralized tracking system formed by ap-
plying the blockchain to the supply chain system can further
improve the connection degree between nodes and effectively
realize the information sharing degree between nodes [12].
Among consumers, blockchain can enable consumers to
accurately grasp product quality and price information.
Among upstream and downstream enterprises of the supply
chain, blockchain can improve information and resource flow
barriers among enterprises and improve operation man-
agement performance.
By constructing information asymmetry and informa-
tion sharing model, this study compares and studies the
problem of supply chain emission reduction and revenue
optimization under the information sharing mechanism
based on blockchain and reveals the internal mechanism of
supply chain emission reduction under the information
sharing mechanism of “blockchain + collaborative emission
reduction.”
3. Model Construction and Solution
Considering the impact of blockchain platform construction
cost, blockchain technology application cost, consumers’
low-carbon preference, and green credit, a three-stage game
model of government, manufacturers, and retailers is con-
structed. Firstly, the government determines the subsidy
coefficient of emission reduction technology investment
with the fundamental goal of maximizing the total social
welfare level θ or subsidies for unit low-carbon products μ,
constitutes the first stage game. )en, the manufacturer
decides the wholesale price W and carbon emission re-
duction R with the goal of maximizing its own income,
which constitutes the second stage game. Finally, the retailer
decides the retail price p to form the third-stage game with
the goal of maximizing its own revenue.
3.1. Technology Subsidy Model. )e government needs to
determine the technology subsidy coefficient given to the
manufacturer. At this time, the government’s financial ex-
penditure is only the technology subsidy cost to the man-
ufacturer. )e revenue functions of government,

Theorem 1. In the technology subsidy model, there are
optimal subsidy coefficient θ(1)∗, carbon emission reduction
rate r(1)∗, wholesale price w(1)∗, and retail price p(1)∗ to
maximize social welfare and maximize the income of man-
ufacturers and retailers.
It is proved that, according to the reverse solution method,
firstly, we replace equation (1) to obtain the retailer’s income
function, and let (zπ(1)

When k> (β2λ2/4(1 − θ)), it can be seen that −1< 0, the
second-order principal subformula k(1 − θ)> (β2λ2/4), and
the Heather matrix is negative; there is an optimal carbon
emission reduction rate and wholesale price so that the
manufacturer can obtain the maximum benefit. Let
(zπ(1)

equations, we obtain w(1) and r(1):

3.2. Output Subsidy Model. )e government needs to deter-
mine the subsidy for manufacturers per unit of low-carbon
products. At this time, the government’s financial expenditure is
only the production subsidy cost of manufacturers.)e revenue
functions of government, manufacturer, and retailer are

welfare andmaximize the income of manufacturers and retailers.
3.3. Technology Subsidy Model Based on Blockchain
Technology. )e government needs to determine the tech-
nology subsidy coefficient given to the manufacturer. At this
time, the government’s financial expenditure includes the
technology subsidy cost to the manufacturer and the single

cost G/N of blockchain platform construction, emission
reduction cost coefficient k, consumers’ green trust λ and
low-carbon preference β on the optimal social welfare,
carbon emission reduction rate, and output of low-carbon
products. In the four situations mentioned above, the fol-
lowing inferences can be obtained:
(1) Emission reduction cost coefficient k has a negative
impact on social welfare, carbon emission reduction rate and
low-carbon product output, and low-carbon preference β
has a positive impact on social welfare, carbon emission
reduction rate, and low-carbon product output. When the
supply chain does not adopt blockchain technology, con-
sumers’ green trust has a positive impact on social welfare,
carbon emission reduction rate, and output of low-carbon
products. When blockchain technology is adopted in the
supply chain, consumers can accurately know the carbon
emission information of low-carbon products. )e green
trust coefficient λ� 1.)e impact of consumers’ green trust λ
on social welfare, carbon emission reduction rate, and low-
carbon product output reaches the maximum.
It is proved that it is easy to prove that the cost coefficient
of emission reduction k, consumers’ green trust λ and low-
carbon preference β, π(1)∗
g , π(2)∗
g , π(3)∗
g , and π(4)∗
g are
derived: π(1)∗
g < 0, π(2)∗
g < 0, π(3)∗
g < 0, π(4)∗
g < 0;
(zπ(1)∗
g /zλ) > 0, (zπ(2)∗
g /zλ)> 0, (zπ(3)∗
g /zλ) � 0,
(zπ(4)∗
g /zλ) � 0, (zπ(1)∗
g /zβ) > 0, (zπ(2)∗
g /zβ)> 0,
(zπ(3)∗
g /zβ)> 0, and (zπ(4)∗
g /zβ)> 0. Similarly, we can
prove the functional relationship between carbon emission
reduction rate and low-carbon product output on emission
reduction cost coefficient k, consumer green trust λ, and
low-carbon preference β.
(2) Social welfare decreases linearly with the increase of
single cycle apportioned cost G/N of blockchain platform
construction. )ere are thresholds GT and GL for shared
costs. When the government adopts technology subsidies and
meets (G/N)<GL or the government adopts production
subsidies and meets (G/N)<GL, the government can obtain
higher social welfare by adopting blockchain technology.
4. Numerical Example
Referring to the relationship between the parameters in the
actual emission reduction decision-making driven by con-
sumers, the probability of L-type and H-type consumers is
set as px � 0.4 and py � 0.6, respectively, the emission re-
duction cost coefficient of manufacturers is cm � 500, the
emission reduction cost coefficient of suppliers is cs � 600,
the basic market demand is a � 1000, and the investment
cost coefficient of “blockchain + collaborative emission re-
duction” is η � 70. )e revenue coefficients of blockchain
information sharing are km � 21 and ks � 20, the unit raw
material cost is w � 1, the unit raw material price is c � 3,
and the initial product price is p � 50. )e following nu-
merical calculations are carried out by programming with
MATLAB r2012a software.
Figures 1 and 2, respectively, show the income of pro-
ducers and suppliers and the income of supply chain under
information asymmetry. It can be seen that, with the in-
crease of low-carbon preference of H-type consumers, the
income of manufacturers and suppliers gradually increases,
the information rent obtained by H-type consumers grad-
ually increases, and the enthusiasm of H-type consumers to
imitate L-type consumers also gradually increases. )e
manufacturer pays extra information rent to H-type con-
sumers in order to avoid H-type consumers imitating L-type
consumers. )is part of information rent is also the loss cost
of supply chain revenue caused by information asymmetry.
Figures 3 and 4, respectively, show the income of pro-
ducers and suppliers and the income of supply chain under
the information sharing mechanism of “block-
chain + collaborative emission reduction.” With the increase
of cost sharing and information sharing, the income distri-
bution ratio φ increases, the income of manufacturers in-
creases, and the income of suppliers decreases. It can be seen
that the information sharing benefits brought by joining the
blockchain can effectively overcome the costs brought by
sharing the blockchain investment and bring significant

growth in benefits. In the supply chain revenue, there is one
point φ∗ � 0.58 ∈ [0, 1], which makes the supply chain
revenue optimal. Compare Figures 2 and 4. Under the same
parameter assignment conditions, the supply chain revenue
under the “blockchain + collaborative emission reduction”
information sharing mechanism is significantly higher than
that under the information asymmetry. )e blockchain can
effectively improve the overall revenue and effectively solve
the revenue loss caused by information asymmetry under the
condition of multiparty information sharing.
5. Conclusion
)is paper establishes a three-stage game model dominated
by the government and followed by manufacturers and
retailers under the four scenarios of emission reduction
technology input subsidy and low-carbon product output
subsidy before and after the application of blockchain
technology. By comparing the optimal social welfare, carbon
emission reduction rate, and low-carbon product output
under the four scenarios, this paper discusses the optimal
problem of the government’s low-carbon subsidy strategy. It
is found that when the product of consumers’ low-carbon
preference coefficient and green trust coefficient is greater
than a certain fixed value, the government can obtain higher
social welfare and promote enterprises’ emission reduction
through output subsidies. )e government can always
promote the demand for low-carbon products through
output subsidies. When the emission reduction cost coef-
ficient approaches infinity, the demand for low-carbon
products when the government implements output subsidies
is four times that when the government implements tech-
nology subsidies.
6. Future Work
)is paper can be further enhanced at a major level. )e
three-stage game model can be further realized for the
optimal problem of the government’s low-carbon subsidy
strategy.
